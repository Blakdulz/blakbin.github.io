Chapter 3900 Judson's Test Salome's blood vitality was extremely exuberant, thanks to the tonics that Zen had collected before she was born.
<br><br>
With the abundant resources of the Source World, she was born much stronger compared to the children of ordinary warriors.
<br><br>
It was safe to say that in terms of strength alone, she was as strong as the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm in the Eastern Region. In the near future, she would definitely be an outstanding warrior in the Source World and would have a great chance to reach the True God Realm much faster than the others at her age.
<br><br>
With her innate talent, she could obtain twice the expected result with just half the effort. Her cultivation would even be much faster than Geoffrey's.
<br><br>
While Zen was staying in the fairy palace, he told his wives what was happening outside. He knew that they might worry so he tried his best to describe and explain the situation with more optimism.
<br><br>
Margaret, Lavender, and the others didn't think much about it, and just believed whatever Zen told them. However, Letitia immediately sensed that there was something wrong going on.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace, which was considered one of the most powerful forces in the entire Source World, had been destroyed. This would surely entail a drastic change. With this, Zen must be worried about the capability of the Pear Hill to survive the upcoming challenges.
<br><br>
After leaving his inner world, Zen returned to the hall and there he saw his sister, Yan, sitting with legs crossed, with a triangular shaft floating in front of her.
<br><br>
The green figure of the Calculation Civilization kept whispering in her ear as she did what it said.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were also there on the sides, watching Yan with faces full of expectation.
<br><br>
Since the green figure had already fully explained the principles, it would just be a matter of time for her to improve and take the Energy Shaft one level further.
<br><br>
As the Snake Goddess saw Zen return to the hall, she whispered to him, "If Yan can bring the Energy Shaft to level five, it would be a great help to the Pear Hill. We need all the forces that we could acquire right now."
<br><br>
Since the Pear Hill was in dire need of powerful warriors, Yan's breakthrough would be perfect timing.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Zen smiled and responded, "Actually, I have two other great warriors in mind that will be a great help for us. But that's only possible if you and the Human Sovereign are willing to cooperate."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed with intrigue.
<br><br>
Zen clearly understood what kind of opponents were about to attack the Pear Hill. Only those at the Eternal Realm and above would be able to help them.
<br><br>
"I'm talking about the Human Sovereign and you," Zen said straightforwardly.
<br><br>
Fuxi wasn't able to figure out right away what Zen meant, but the Snake Goddess understood it instantly.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace didn't really rely on Zen's strength to resist the Sun Crow race's invasion before. But it became possible because of the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi that was inside Zen's body.
<br><br>
Although the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was only a wisp of energy soul, he could still exert his bloodline power to an extreme extent. Therefore, during the previous battle, his strength far exceeded the power of Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had already known that she and Fuxi were only avatars that possessed their own consciousness.
<br><br>
"So you mean that my real self and the real Fuxi will take control of our bodies, right?" the Snake Goddess asked Zen.
<br><br>
"That's your idea?" Fuxi frowned as he looked at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and answered, "Yes."
<br><br>
In fact, when Zen was still on his way back, he had already discussed this matter with the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
In the case of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he couldn't resist the invasion of his real self because he hadn't woken up yet.
<br><br>
But for the Snake Goddess and Fuxi, the situation was different. They had their own consciousness in the Source World. Thus it wasn't appropriate for them to sacrifice their bodies to their real counterparts. Zen bore this in mind, and tried to be very careful when he proposed it.
<br><br>
He had already expected that they might oppose the idea, so it wasn't a surprise when Fuxi showed expressions of antipathy. But he became hopeful when he saw that the Snake Goddess fell silent and sincerely thought about it.
<br><br>
Currently, in addition to asking Gerald to summon the other two Chaos Ancient Gods, the Snake Goddess also tried to persuade other super forces, which had Eternal Realm warriors, to their side. The Ear Mice and even the Separate Abyss race were included.
<br><br>
Previously, these super forces tended to play it safe. On one hand, they were afraid of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race. They even hoped that the Element Spirit race could take care of them on the Other Shore. On the other hand, they also didn't agree with the Purge Way.
<br><br>
Now was the time for these super forces to make their own choice.
<br><br>
After thinking for quite some time, the Snake Goddess gave a serious look at Zen and said, "I want to talk to my real self."
<br><br>
Zen nodded and looked at Fuxi. However, Fuxi just waved his hand and said, "Leave me alone. I won't allow anyone to control me, not even that guy."
<br><br>
Back when the Snake Goddess and Fuxi knew that they were just avatars, they felt very disappointed. The news came as quite a shock for both of them.
<br><br>
Fuxi had always been conceited and prideful. That was why it was difficult for him to accept Zen's proposal.
<br><br>
Since Zen didn't have the authority to impose, he respected Fuxi's decision.
<br><br>
After that, Zen communicated with the real Snake Goddess, and her energy soul floated out.
<br><br>
As the Cloud Cover Array was activated, the light in the Pear Hill became much dimmer under the thick clouds.
<br><br>
Three days later, at exact noontime, a huge crack suddenly appeared in the clouds, and the sunlight poured in. Everyone in the Pear Hill turned their heads and gazed into the sky.
<br><br>
On the huge crack where the rays of sunlight were shining in, a huge shadow suddenly descended from it.
<br><br>
The creature was so huge and looked like a bradypod. It turned out that it was one of the Chaos Ancient Gods—Judson.
<br><br>
Among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, it was said that Judson was the most discreet one.
<br><br>
Even back in the era when the Chaos Ancient Gods had the most intense conflicts and disputes, he had only appeared and attacked twice.
<br><br>
Splash! Judson's body quickly shrank as he landed beside a pool in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
At the same time, Gerald was there to meet with Judson. His body also shrank a lot. Most of his body was soaked in the pool, and only his head and his poisonous tail were exposed.
<br><br>
"So where's the guy that you're talking about? I want to meet him," Judson said outright.
<br><br>
Gerald mentioned Zen when he was trying to recruit Judson on their side.
<br><br>
Since Judson didn't know Zen, he found Gerald's stories about him quite inconceivable.
<br><br>
Eventually, Gerald called Zen over to meet Judson.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen climbed to the pool, he saw a bradypod-like creature wave his hand at him. At the same moment, he felt a strange wave of spiritual energy rush towards him. In an instant, an illusory world surrounded and enveloped him.
<br><br>
Inside the illusory world, there was no way to know if it was day or night.
<br><br>
There were mazes everywhere and the atmosphere was disharmonious.
<br><br>
'A spiritual attack?' Zen suddenly became vigilant. He perceived that the world he was in was obviously a spiritual illusion.
<br><br>
Although his soul had already reached the Holy Soul Realm, had nine Holy Soul Imprints and was much stronger than those of ordinary Eternal Realm warriors, it still wasn't easy for him to break free from Judson's truth-level theurgy using the strength of his Holy Soul alone.
<br><br>
"Don't you think you oversold this guy?" Judson said to Gerald as he shook his head in disappointment. With all that he heard about Zen, he thought that Zen should be able to easily break free from the illusion that he made.
<br><br>
However, just seconds after, Judson felt unusual vitality burst out from Zen's body. It was supposed to be a kind of soul aura, but he was sure that it came from Zen's body.
<br><br>
While Judson was still confused, he suddenly widened his eyes and felt that the illusion he had created began to collapse. Before he could understand what was going on, the illusory world was completely destroyed by Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3901 The Black Pages The spiritual attack that Judson launched relied on the soul. It was energy in essence.
<br><br>
The abilities of the spiritual level in the ancestry-level bloodline were mostly gathered in the area symbolizing life.
<br><br>
The moment the illusory world enveloped Zen's body, the ancestry-level bloodline started to react. Zen felt a chill rushing up from his back and integrating into his soul. In the blink of an eye, the huge world was broken.
<br><br>
Judson stared at Zen with amazement. "The person you chose is really extraordinary, Gerald," he said just before blotting out the expression on his face.
<br><br>
Gerald took a slight glance at Judson. A moment ago, Judson thought he oversold Zen, but now his attitude changed.
<br><br>
Gerald floated out of the pool. "Zen, this is another Chaos Ancient God, Judson," he said.
<br><br>
He motioned to Zen to come closer for an introduction.
<br><br>
"Master Judson," Zen greeted Judson politely, cupping his hands towards him. It seemed that the spiritual attack Judson had launched was just a test for him.
<br><br>
"You really are an exceptional young man," said Judson as he narrowed his eyes, appearing as if he expected highly of him. "The bloodline you have been infused must be the origin-level bloodline. It happens to be the bloodline that can resist the soul attack, right?"
<br><br>
If the origin-level bloodline that Zen obtained could strengthen his soul, then it made sense that he was able to easily resist Judson's attack.
<br><br>
Gerald chuckled. "Judson, you can try another way," he suggested.
<br><br>
Judson felt strange about Gerald's request, but he did as he was told.
<br><br>
He stretched out his claw towards Zen's head, and an indefectible glazed goblet appeared out of nowhere. It flew towards Zen, trapping him with no escape.
<br><br>
Strong energy engulfed the entirety of the goblet. It was obviously not an ordinary object.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As the energy surged inside the goblet, Zen felt a great debilitating pressure running through his veins and across his body.
<br><br>
If his cultivation base was lower than the Eternal Realm, the energy could have crushed him.
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his finger and lightly tapped the transparent wall, digging a small hole.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The great pressure in the goblet was unleashed from the hole, forming an energy sword. The impact of the pressure then shot the sword towards the pool.
<br><br>
Splash! The calm waters of the pool began to ripple from the aura of the energy sword.
<br><br>
Zen looked at Judson with questioning eyes. He broke the goblet only with a single tap. His strength was evident.
<br><br>
Judson was introverted. However, he was also competitive. 'I don't plan on losing to you, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
The truth-level energy from his claw soared, combining with the energy from the glazed goblet. A blinding blue light was emitted.
<br><br>
Realizing that Judson was unwilling to admit defeat, Zen stretched out his hands and scratched the goblet wall even more vigorously.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! The goblet started to disintegrate from more holes made by Zen's move. It couldn't bear Zen's strength any longer and finally broke into pieces.
<br><br>
"Well..." Judson was rendered speechless.
<br><br>
"If I remember correctly, this Heavenly Glazed Goblet is the strongest thing you have ever made?" Gerald said with a smirk.
<br><br>
"It used to be," Judson replied. "But now it's not."
<br><br>
Among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, Judson possessed the creation truth, the only way that chaotic energy was transformed into any kind of material.
<br><br>
It was similar to the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
However, the creation theurgy which used the power of truth was naturally much stronger than the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
Not only could Zen easily break free from Judson's spiritual attack, but he was also able to destroy the Heavenly Glazed Goblet effortlessly. Such methods were inconceivable for Judson.
<br><br>
In fact, Gerald did not invite Zen to show off his strength.
<br><br>
Judson, Kendrick, and Gerald did not support the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.
<br><br>
Their gathering in the Pear Hill was because they advocated the Finale Way, and they had always hoped to complete it. And now, Zen was the only one who could complete it.
<br><br>
Judson had come all the way to meet Zen.
<br><br>
Now Zen's performance was beyond Judson's expectations, which confirmed that his trip wasn't rather useless. At least, he would firmly stand by the Pear Hill's side.
<br><br>
After leaving the pool where Gerald was located, Zen had to go to the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
On the one hand, Letitia had asked about Geoffrey's current situation, and on the other hand, Ziya would be a great help in the oncoming battle.
<br><br>
Zen tried to activate the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. He was about to enter the Deleting Space when he felt a force of resistance. He was actually being rejected by the Deleting Space! He had entered the Deleting Space for several times, but this had never happened before.
<br><br>
"What happened?" he pondered.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but have a bad feeling. He was wondering and confused at the same time.
<br><br>
After trying and failing for several times, his face darkened.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly spoke, "Don't worry. The change in the Deleting Space might have something to do with Othniel."
<br><br>
Othniel had also participated in the battle this time. It was Othniel's theurgy to delete the space into the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
It was most likely that Othniel had discovered the secret of the Deleting Space, so Ziya might have done something to protect it.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was smart. His guess could somehow be close to the truth.
<br><br>
"That makes sense." Zen nodded as he was feeling a little relieved.
<br><br>
It was a risk to place Geoffrey in the Deleting Space. However, it was his own choice as he was already an adult, but Zen did not intend to tell Letitia about this.
<br><br>
While Zen was in deep thought about the mystery of the Deleting Space, Geoffrey and Ziya were passing through a plain in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
After a long and tiring journey, they reached a spot close to the four huge black pillars. A strange plain with big and small caves suddenly appeared in front of them.
<br><br>
"Could those caves be worlds?" Geoffrey wondered as they walked towards them.
<br><br>
He pulled Ziya into one of the caves. They explored the inside and found that he guessed right.
<br><br>
The worlds were similar to the chaos. There were independent spaces within, which were not as vast as the worlds they knew. They were much smaller.
<br><br>
Just as before, dead silence filled the caves. No living being thrived as there was no evidence of life.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had given up exploring and moved towards the four giant pillars.
<br><br>
At the end of the plain was the nearest black pillar.
<br><br>
After passing through each round cave on the seemingly unending plain, Geoffrey finally saw the huge pillar in front of him.
<br><br>
The pillar seemed to be formed by numerous pages of book. The thick and huge pages were placed in a spiral, forming an upward stair.
<br><br>
Walking to the side of the pillar, Geoffrey reached out his hand and touched a black page. To his surprise, his hand felt that it was not made of paper, but of solid stone.
<br><br>
He blinked his eyes in disbelief and proceeded to step on a stair.
<br><br>
Buzz! The moment he stepped on the stair, a light orange thread appeared and flew into the distant sky.
<br><br>
Geoffrey frowned and looked at the thread, confused.
<br><br>
It seemed that the thread was headed to the direction of the chaos.
<br><br>
Chapter 3902 Changing The Location Geoffrey took a good, long look at the thread but still couldn't figure out its use.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to reach for it in an attempt to pull it closer, a scene flashed in front of his eyes.
<br><br>
He saw a golden beach, picturesque and beautiful, with the cold seawater that constantly surged at the edges.
<br><br>
His pupils contracted as he took in the sight. "Is this the Sea of Truth?" he muttered to himself.
<br><br>
He traced the length of the thread and discovered that it was connected to a grain of sand on the beach.
<br><br>
He found himself filled with awe and confusion. "Could it be that such a long thread connects to a single grain of sand?"
<br><br>
He then remembered Ziya told him that the energy of all Other Shore Tokens came from the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Geoffrey asked him how exactly the energy was transmitted, but Ziya couldn't answer. After all, it wasn't a subject Ziya dabbled in.
<br><br>
The concept of space in the Abstruse Energy World was completely different from that of the chaos. Now Geoffrey perceived this thread was very long, but in fact, it might not be necessarily true.
<br><br>
"A grain of sand connects to a thread. If that is the case, then..."
<br><br>
As he was thinking, he took a step forward and onto the second stair. He was now on the second page and suddenly, dozens of threads appeared.
<br><br>
Geoffrey reached out for the threads and saw every single scene at the end of each one.
<br><br>
"Sand, sand, sand, and sand..."
<br><br>
It was as he had predicted. Each thread connected to a grain of sand on that golden beach. The threads grew in number but the scene stayed almost exactly the same.
<br><br>
Upon the realization that the pages at the bottom might just contain endless sand, Geoffrey decided to draw Ziya and climb up the stairs.
<br><br>
The spiral staircase formed out of the pages. The further he went, the greater the number of threads that appeared was.
<br><br>
Each time he passed by a page, Geoffrey would reach out just to check and found each page was full of sand.
<br><br>
Just as he thought that maybe there was nothing else to see, he finally came upon a new discovery. He had arrived on the tenth page and found that the thread connected to a grain of sand, much like the others, except this particular grain was fused with a creature that had just reached the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
This grain of sand was not on the beach but in a round inner world! The sand was the lowest-level Other Shore Token and contained less than one divine megaton of power. Only a fool would choose to fuse themselves with the sand, yet Geoffrey was encountering such a fool.
<br><br>
He was practically speechless and spent quite a while just staring. After his shock receded, Geoffrey decided to continue his ascent.
<br><br>
Ten pages...
<br><br>
Twenty pages...
<br><br>
Thirty...
<br><br>
After a while, Geoffrey soon climbed a certain height.
<br><br>
The higher he went, the more threads the pages released. After he reached the thirtieth page, tens of thousands of light threads emanated from the page.
<br><br>
On the eightieth page, he was finally able to leave the area of sand as stones began to make an appearance.
<br><br>
"This should be within Stage One of the Other Shore. The power offered by the Other Shore Tokens in Stage One is very weak," Geoffrey remarked.
<br><br>
He wanted to communicate with Ziya, but there was no way Ziya was going to hear him. He could only rely on himself to judge the things he saw.
<br><br>
The items connected to the light threads were arranged by size, from smallest to largest, and there were also a few precious Other Shore Tokens strewn about, hidden in rooms of various shapes and styles.
<br><br>
Geoffrey could only look at them in wonder.
<br><br>
"The rooms on the Other Shore? The Other Shore Tokens in the temples..."
<br><br>
He did not know much about the Other Shore and had to think for a while in order to understand.
<br><br>
After entering the Other Shore, most Source World creatures made it their goal to explore the temples in the hopes of obtaining a decent Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
From here on out, the other ends of the threads connected to multiple inner worlds.
<br><br>
"It seems that the size and shape of the Other Shore Tokens don't really matter," he muttered thoughtfully. "What matters is the place to which the threads connect."
<br><br>
He was a thoughtful young man and as he continued to climb, he could judge the strength of the Other Shore Tokens with just a few details and observations.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Tokens that connected to the outermost threads of the page were often ordinary, while those connecting to the inner ones were more precious.
<br><br>
A bold idea then came to Geoffrey's mind. 'If I change the position of the thread, will the Other Shore Token's nature also change?' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Eager to test his idea out, Geoffrey quickly made his way to the edge of the page. After a bit of careful investigation, he found that the root of the thread was a thumb-sized, square stone embedded on the page.
<br><br>
Geoffrey reached out and tried to dig out this stone! To his amazement, it came loose! "It's moveable!"
<br><br>
Just as he dug out the square stone, the thread that connected to the far distance also disappeared.
<br><br>
At the same time, in an empty corner of Stage Two of the Other Shore, the huge Three-layer Stone suddenly lost its luster.
<br><br>
Everything on the Other Shore, save for the soul pill, soul crystal, and a few other specific things, contained energy.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey took out the stone, he inevitably cut off the thread that connected to the Three-layer Stone and turned it into an ordinary rock. It was no longer an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Afterwards, Geoffrey walked to the inner side of the page and found a large number of black pits of the same size there.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, he stuffed the stone into one of those pits.
<br><br>
Click! The moment the stone was fitted onto the slot, the thread once again appeared and extended onto the Other Shore. Once again, the Three-layer Stone's surface lit up, this time with red-orange light. The amount of power contained within the stone also rose by more than ten times! Two horse-faced creatures that resided in Stage Two sensed the powerful aura that was suddenly released from the distance.
<br><br>
"What in the world happened over there?"
<br><br>
These two were from the Triumph race, a very small group of horse-faced creatures in the Source World. They had no might nor any fame to their name.
<br><br>
They had stayed in Stage Two of the Other Shore all this time because their Souls of Light were nowhere near strong enough to reach the higher stage.
<br><br>
The two of them made the trek towards the Three-layer Stone and could not contain their amazement when they reached their destination.
<br><br>
"Shouldn't a Three-layer Stone normally contain only two or three divine megatons of power?"
<br><br>
"Yeah, but why does this one seem to have dozens of divine megatons of power?!"
<br><br>
"I can feel its scorching aura! It seems to contain some sort of special fire ability!"
<br><br>
"It's at the highest grade!"
<br><br>
Their hearts boiled with excitement. The two of them had spent so many years here in Stage Two, but they suddenly came upon this strange Other Shore Token that could reverse their fortune! Nobody would believe a single word they said about this incident.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Geoffrey, who had seen all of this unfold, felt a strange feeling in his heart. It was when he raised his head to look at the endless black column that he realized it was the overwhelming feeling of omnipotence! Chapter 3903 Trigger The four massive pillars had some sort of a strict ruling in which every thread was not to be touched or moved.
<br><br>
No one was allowed to change their positions without authorization.
<br><br>
Anyone who broke the rule would have to face severe consequences.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey moved one of the threads, at the end of the staircase, a statue suddenly came to life. Its eyes glowed a red light, and its body trembled slightly.
<br><br>
"Anyone..."
<br><br>
Fortunately for Geoffrey, this statue had been asleep for countless years and was practically a few steps away from disintegrating into a pile of dust. If this had taken place a while back, the statue would've leapt into action immediately, killing the intruders on the spot.
<br><br>
However, it was way past its prime. Its stone body had practically melded into the ground it stood upon.
<br><br>
Statues weren't supposed to rot, but this one did. In comparison, the four statues of the Eternal Divine Courtyard were much luckier.
<br><br>
Because of the existence of the Time Lock, they were destined to continue in pristine condition, unlike the statue that angrily flashed its red eyes at Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The statue felt the energy fluctuations coming from the pillar, and desperately tried to free its legs from the ground.
<br><br>
However, it didn't take long before all its energy was used up, and its eyes quickly dimmed till it was lifeless once more.
<br><br>
This whole time, Geoffrey didn't know what was going on above. Upon climbing to the 500th stair, he found that the threads of light here were connected to much more Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Stretching out his hand, he lightly brushed some threads of light closest to him, and had visions pertaining to where the Other Shore Tokens were located.
<br><br>
"This inner world is full of fish," he cried in amusement, as the Other Shore Tokens revealed to him many different inner worlds.
<br><br>
"What a disgusting inner world! There is sticky blood everywhere.
<br><br>
None of these looks enticing..."
<br><br>
Finally, Geoffrey found an inner world full of humans.
<br><br>
"This guy must be a human..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey didn't know whether the owner of this inner world was friend or foe, nor did he care. The only thing on his mind now was his insatiable curiosity with a hint of mischievousness.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, he dug out the square stone under the thread and inserted it into the first black pit on the inner side.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Rose Sect of Pear Hill, the sect leader Emily was leading over a hundred disciples to cultivate a unique cultivation method.
<br><br>
Before, Zen had given enough Chaotic Source Spirits to Emily. With those spirits, she might be the last one to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Additionally, she was the one who helped bring Yan and Zen into the Source World, so she was trained with utmost priority by the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Now, the Rose Sect was the most popular among the small sects of the Pear Hill. Anyone with a discerning eye could see that it wouldn't be long before it became a powerful sect, and Emily would be promoted to the grand sect leader.
<br><br>
"Ah!"
<br><br>
Just then, a beautiful female disciple who had been following Emily shrieked. The other disciples whipped their heads to see where the scream came from, only to find the female disciple trembling slightly, her face as pale as a ghost.
<br><br>
Emily frowned. "What's wrong?"
<br><br>
The female disciple sat there in shock, but answered Emily obediently, "My Other Shore Token seems to have been destroyed."
<br><br>
This disciple had just entered Stage Four, and her Other Shore Token was very ordinary. However, Emily just so happened to be fond of her. Sooner or later, Emily was willing to help her obtain a powerful Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"Destroyed?" Emily's frown deepened. She too was stunned.
<br><br>
The female disciple felt the gaze of the other disciples. Afraid that no one believed her, she summoned her Other Shore Token, a white stone flower.
<br><br>
The stone flower looked pretty ordinary, as though it was a simple decorative paperweight. No energy fluctuations seemed to be pulsating within it.
<br><br>
"Is this Other Shore Token really broken?"
<br><br>
"It doesn't look like its energy has been depleted..."
<br><br>
"How about replenishing it with the divine crystals?"
<br><br>
The other female disciples of the Rose Sect broke into an uproar.
<br><br>
Even the Other Shore Token that had used up all its energy would've reacted. This stone flower truly seemed to be an ordinary object.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore, everything had energy. It was almost impossible to find something devoid of it! Emily's brows furrowed in confusion. She had never encountered such a situation.
<br><br>
Buzz! The stone flower suddenly shook violently in the disciple's hand. A cold aura gushed out from it and enshrouded the entire hall. It seemed the Other Shore Token had been strengthened by at least twenty times in such a short time! "Eh?"
<br><br>
the female disciple grunted confusedly, and even Emily was surprised.
<br><br>
They had never seen Other Shore Tokens become stronger in this way.
<br><br>
Back on the massive pillar, after Geoffrey once again changed the location of a thread, another strand of energy surged out from within the pillar.
<br><br>
At the end of the staircase with one thousand pages, the eyes of the broken statue flickered once more, this time with an even brighter red light.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The statue finally managed to break free from its pedestal and took a step forward.
<br><br>
"Anyone who dares to break in will be killed!" it explained, finally able to complete the sentence it was trying to utter earlier.
<br><br>
This statue was designed to protect the huge pillar.
<br><br>
Once untethered, the statue was actually quite nimble. It rushed down the stairs speedily.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Of course, the sound of the statue running caught Geoffrey's attention.
<br><br>
As the statue closed in on its target, Geoffrey felt a sense of dread welling up within him. Standing at the edge of the staircase, he looked up towards the clamoring sound. Only then did he see the tattered statue rushing down the stairs.
<br><br>
Instantly, Geoffrey realized that the statue was aiming for him.
<br><br>
Not wanting to fight the statue, Geoffrey abruptly turned and ran down the stairs.
<br><br>
However, the statue really was incredibly fast. In just a few moments, the distance between the two closed quickly. Geoffrey was somewhat slow because Ziya was behind him.
<br><br>
Seeing there was no outrunning this statue, Geoffrey whipped around to make Ziya face the statue. Urgently, he patted Ziya on his right shoulder.
<br><br>
All Ziya could see were the dense light dots in front of him. He knew that Geoffrey had climbed up the pillar.
<br><br>
Without the slightest hesitation, he reached out to slap whatever was in front of him.
<br><br>
Boom! Normally, creatures in the Abstruse Energy World wouldn't stand a chance against Ziya's palm attack.
<br><br>
However, the statue on the pillar was by no means ordinary. Even a blow from Ziya just caused it to shake its head in a daze for a moment, but it quickly recovered.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
When Geoffrey saw this scene, his eyes widened in fear. Ziya was probably no match for the statue, at least not in this form.
<br><br>
In a rush, he grabbed Ziya's hand and yanked him towards the edge of the stair. Together, they jumped off the pillar and plummeted to the ground.
<br><br>
Boom! Upon landing on the ground, Geoffrey immediately jumped up and helped Ziya up as well.
<br><br>
Ziya was confused. How did they fall? He didn't recall feeling any sort of impact from the statue's counterattack.
<br><br>
However, when he stood up, he positioned his hands, ready to strike again.
<br><br>
To his surprise, he felt Geoffrey yanking at the rope.
<br><br>
No matter what happened, he had to follow Geoffrey, so he didn't have the time to try attacking again and decided to follow Geoffrey.
<br><br>
The statue was not going to let Geoffrey go. Muttering something under its breath, the statue quickly spiraled down the stairs.
<br><br>
As they ran, Geoffrey kept one eye on the pillar behind him. Then, he narrowed his eyes ruthlessly.
<br><br>
If he couldn't deal with the statue here, he would have to lead it into the real world.
<br><br>
Chapter 3904 The Strength Of The Statue The nearest cave on the plain was only a few hundred feet away. With a few strides, Geoffrey arrived in an instant and went in.
<br><br>
The caves on the plain seemed to be empty, but each one had a very unique and terrifying interior.
<br><br>
There was one which was filled with corrosive liquids, another containing poisonous gases floating within, and another one with a scorching hot interior as if a sun was stored in it.
<br><br>
Closely behind, a statue was chasing after him at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
Before he knew it, the statue was just about ten feet away from him.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, he jumped into the nearest cave, dragging Ziya along.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The statue's goal was to hunt down the intruders. Even after Geoffrey successfully left the pillar, the statue still chased after him and was determined to kill him.
<br><br>
As Geoffrey and Ziya jumped in, the statue followed them.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Thousands of light dots, like a torrential rain, drilled into the cave below.
<br><br>
The two quickly turned into their normal forms, as they continued to fall into the cave.
<br><br>
Ziya instantly analyzed their situation, quickly grabbed the rope around his waist, and pulled Geoffrey towards him.
<br><br>
Just as he steadied himself, a whistling sound came from above. He saw that the statue stretched out its big hand and tried to grab his head.
<br><br>
The statues on the pillars didn't possess extraordinary abilities. However, their bodies were extremely sturdy, and their movements were incredibly fast. With just brute strength and speed to rely on, they still couldn't be underestimated.
<br><br>
Ziya knew that if the statue got a hold of his head, it would be crushed easily.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he was a smart man. He never took his opponents lightly and was always alert at his surroundings.
<br><br>
He instantly realized that the statue was not easy to deal with.
<br><br>
With his quick reflexes, he drew his head back, and the statue missed.
<br><br>
At the same time, he did not waste the opportunity for a counterattack. With a wave of his hand, a golden whip shadow shot towards the statue.
<br><br>
Boom! The moment the God Lashing Whip touched the statue, a deafening explosion resounded.
<br><br>
It was so loud that Geoffrey couldn't help covering his ears as he shouted in pain. Blood started dripping to his fingers that were covering his ears.
<br><br>
Ziya immediately saw Geoffrey's condition so he reached out his hand, grabbed him, and stuffed him into the space channel. Now, he could focus on dealing with the statue with no restraint. The power within his body quickly surged towards the God Lashing Whip.
<br><br>
To his surprise, the statue managed to withstand his attack. Never had he seen such a solid statue before that couldn't be destroyed by his mighty whip.
<br><br>
"Death to the invaders!"
<br><br>
The statue regained its balance after being sent away with the impact caused by the God Lashing Whip. It rushed towards Ziya again, but what waited for it were endless whip shadows.
<br><br>
Golden whip shadows drew an arc of tens of thousands of feet from left to right. They lashed the statue at lightning speed, creating space ripples in rapid succession.
<br><br>
In just a few seconds, Ziya had cracked his whip for more than a thousand times.
<br><br>
The statue's speed became useless in the face of Ziya's attacks. It could do nothing but rely on its sturdy body to withstand the strikes.
<br><br>
Clap! Crack! The loud sound of whipping reverberated throughout the entire cave.
<br><br>
The more Ziya attacked, the more he got surprised.
<br><br>
He knew that the power of his whip was absolute.
<br><br>
In the chaos, no matter how powerful his opponents were, there was no way that they could withstand such an astounding volume of attacks.
<br><br>
The statue wasn't even a special being, but it could actually endure an allout attack for a long time.
<br><br>
'What material is this statue made of?!' Ziya was getting impatient.
<br><br>
Clap! Crack! Ziya continued his furious attacks. Soon, he noticed that the statue was already showing signs of collapse. Eventually, one of its arms got destroyed.
<br><br>
Soon, the other arm, legs, torso, and the head were also torn apart by the golden whip shadows.
<br><br>
Ziya was relieved as he defeated the seemingly indestructible statue. He then grabbed the air and released Geoffrey from the space channel. While he was treating Geoffrey's wounds, he asked with a serious expression, "Did that statue run down from one of the four pillars?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Geoffrey answered as he stared at the remains of the statue that were now nothing but scraps of metal. He knew that the statue was indeed powerful since Ziya took quite some time before he could destroy it.
<br><br>
"Did it attack you as you climbed up the pillar?" Ziya asked. Since he was not aware of the passage of time in the Abstruse Energy World, he didn't know how long Geoffrey had stayed on the pillar.
<br><br>
"Actually, no." Geoffrey shook his head while his brows were furrowed.
<br><br>
"I'm thinking maybe it attacked because I moved something that I shouldn't," he continued.
<br><br>
"Wait. What do you mean? What was on the pillar?" Ziya asked curiously.
<br><br>
Then Geoffrey told him about the pages and the threads of light on the pillar.
<br><br>
"What are you saying? The threads of light here are connected to the Other Shore?" Ziya was so shocked that his mouth remained wide open.
<br><br>
There were actually several various theories about the Other Shore. One of the most popular ones was that its energy was flowing and coming from the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Right at this moment, Ziya finally confirmed this theory.
<br><br>
There were a lot of things that entered his mind as he discovered this secret.
<br><br>
He was kind of trembling and was pacing back and forth.
<br><br>
With this discovery, it meant that all the powerful, sacred, and terrifying forces on the Other Shore actually relied on the four huge pillars.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it seemed that the situation on the Other Shore of the other worlds was just the same.
<br><br>
In Ziya's mind, he couldn't help but think that the four pillars might be the origin of everything.
<br><br>
He was even more puzzled when he heard Geoffrey saying that the positions of the threads of light and the nature of the Other Shore Tokens could be changed at will.
<br><br>
"I remember it clearly. The statue didn't make a move the first time I made changes, but when I did it for the second time, the statue chased after me. I guess there's more than one statue on the pillars," Geoffrey explained. He thought that he could just do whatever he wanted, but it turned out that it wasn't that simple.
<br><br>
Upon seeing his sullen face, Ziya smiled and said, "You can go to the pillar again and lure the other statues down."
<br><br>
Ziya clearly knew about the function of the four pillars, so he didn't want this opportunity to slip by.
<br><br>
"You want me to lure them down? But what if I can't escape?" Geoffrey said in a trembling voice.
<br><br>
The first statue was shabby, and its intellect wasn't so high. If Geoffrey encountered a statue that possessed a high level of intelligence, it might be difficult for him to escape.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. Just deal with them the same way as you did with the first one." Ziya stretched out his hand, and the Truth of Three-Energy Construction began to operate. The rope that tied him and Geoffrey continued to lengthen.
<br><br>
The plan was Ziya would stay behind while Geoffrey returned to the pillars.
<br><br>
If something unexpected should happen, he could tell Ziya immediately through the rope so that he could pull him back instantly.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on the Dark Haze Peak of the Pear Hill, a droplet of blood dripped from the wound on Zen's fingertip.
<br><br>
The droplet of extremely thick ancestry-level blood fell into a clear pool.
<br><br>
As it splashed into the water, the blood continued to sink without dispersing.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the droplet of blood stopped sinking, jumped out of the pool, and rushed back towards the wound on Zen's finger.
<br><br>
Like a small red bug, Zen flicked the droplet back into the pool.
<br><br>
It splashed into the pool again. This time, it wandered around the pool and sank into the bottom.
<br><br>
Immediately after, the temperature within the entire pool rapidly rose.
<br><br>
Due to intense heat, a thick white mist began springing up.
<br><br>
Soon after, the clear water in the pool had completely evaporated.
<br><br>
Chapter 3905 The Problem Of The Ancestry-level Bloodline The Dark Haze Peak was a place of cultivation in the Pear Hill. The pool looked small, but was in fact ten thousand feet deep.
<br><br>
A drop of the ancestry-level blood could instantly cause the water in the pool to evaporate. The heat emanating off of it was not to be underestimated.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The blood at the bottom of the pool began to lengthen before Zen's eyes. It was ten feet long before it stopped. It then drilled into the Dark Haze Peak.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Cracks sounded from within the peak as the blood began to cut the peak.
<br><br>
It had gone rogue just because Zen hadn't accepted it. And at the rate it was going, it looked like it was threatening Zen by saying that it would destroy everything if he didn't accept it.
<br><br>
"Alas..."
<br><br>
Zen was rendered speechless. He was no longer treating it as a drop of blood, but as a living being.
<br><br>
A while later, a neat cut appeared on one side of the Dark Haze Peak.
<br><br>
If given enough time, this drop of blood could hack the Dark Haze Peak to dust.
<br><br>
Zen had no choice but to stretch out his right hand, in order to summon it back.
<br><br>
He then felt a strange fluctuation of the ancestry-level bloodline in his body, as if it was releasing a signal to make that drop of blood return to him.
<br><br>
That drop of blood seemed to have ears. At the summons from the bloodline in Zen's body, it quickly rushed back and drilled into his finger.
<br><br>
Zen had originally planned to accept this drop of blood, but his face darkened as he felt the difference of the ancestry-level bloodline in his body. He flicked his finger once again, sending the drop of blood flying outwards.
<br><br>
How could he allow his blood to master his own body? He had already sensed back in the square that the process of his fusion with the bloodline was slightly different from that of others.
<br><br>
According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, once the bloodline was successfully absorbed, it would become a part of him.
<br><br>
He might not be proficient in using the theurgy bestowed by the bloodline in the beginning. But he would become more and more skillful as time passed and with constant use.
<br><br>
The bloodline was part of the body. It wouldn't cause trouble without reason.
<br><br>
But the bloodline in Zen's body was acting strangely.
<br><br>
He didn't know how to use the ancestry-level bloodline. When he had emerged from the Eternal Scroll Painting, the ancestry-level bloodline had displayed several theurgies according to the situations on its own.
<br><br>
In a nutshell, the ancestry-level bloodline was like a puppeteer while Zen was just a puppet.
<br><br>
It was not easy to obtain the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
But how could he become its puppet? Zen would not allow this to happen! The drop of blood suddenly changed form.
<br><br>
It was only the size of a bean, but in this moment, it turned into a monster's head. It even had a mouth and a vocal organ and was wailing in protest.
<br><br>
Zen felt his body spiral out of control.
<br><br>
It felt like someone else was holding him in his body. He pounced towards the drop of blood, his body stiff.
<br><br>
No matter how he tried to summon his strength and activate the Other Shore Tokens, he was unable to change anything.
<br><br>
He trembled and stretched out a hand to the drop of blood. The monster-like blood finally returned to normal. It got in through his fingertip. It was only then that the force that controlled his body disappeared and his body finally returned to normal.
<br><br>
Once the violent conflict between the two forces disappeared, Zen felt pain in his body. He lost his strength and fell to the ground. He asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven while panting, "This blood..."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was also rendered speechless.
<br><br>
He had felt that something was wrong when the ancestry-level bloodline began to make all sorts of responses.
<br><br>
Since the ancestry-level bloodline was extraordinary and beyond his realm of knowledge, he thought that perhaps this was its own ability and didn't think further about it.
<br><br>
But now, it seemed that the ancestry-level bloodline had its own consciousness and was about to disobey every one of Zen's orders.
<br><br>
"Perhaps you haven't really refined the ancestry-level bloodline yet," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
He was worried, now that he knew the background of the ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
An origin-level bloodline alone was extremely powerful. What would the ancestry-level bloodline that no one had ever completely obtained be like? Zen also realized the seriousness of the problem. "What should we do?"
<br><br>
It was true that the bloodline was powerful, but it wouldn't be worth it if he became a puppet of this bloodline.
<br><br>
"You must find a way to refine it and erase its consciousness. Let me help you," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
Zen didn't know how intelligent the ancestry-level bloodline was, so he didn't say anything. He merely sat cross-legged and conjured an incarnation in his inner world.
<br><br>
Fortunately, there were still a lot of forces that Zen could rely on in his inner world.
<br><br>
Under the arrangements that the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others had made, a red net array was formed in Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
Zen had to refine the ancestry-level bloodline completely to erase its consciousness.
<br><br>
A full six days passed in his inner world.
<br><br>
When, in his excitement, he moved the net array out of his elixir field and activated it, the bloodline in his body began to fluctuate.
<br><br>
The net array collapsed and disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the other human heroes were dumbstruck.
<br><br>
"It has been eroded by a completely opposite energy," the Snake Goddess said awkwardly.
<br><br>
"Things aren't as simple as we think," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, shaking his head. The ancestry-level bloodline could dissolve any kind of energy, and Zen probably wouldn't be able to refine it by himself. "It looks like we'll have to turn to external forces."
<br><br>
"External forces?" Zen repeated thoughtfully. "You mean Gerald's power?"
<br><br>
"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, nodding.
<br><br>
Gerald had mastered the life truth, while Judson had mastered the creation truth.
<br><br>
Zen didn't hesitate. Now that he was facing a formidable enemy, a war would break out at any time. And before that happened, he had to solve this hidden trouble in his body. Gerald was trustworthy.
<br><br>
Zen went to visit Gerald and told him about the bloodline. Gerald was surprised at the weirdness of the story but thought it was understandable.
<br><br>
The bloodline that Zen had obtained was too powerful.
<br><br>
As the Son of Truth who was in charge of the life truth, Gerald was familiar with bloodlines. He thought for a while before turning towards Zen and taking action.
<br><br>
He punctured Zen's back. When the truth energy was injected into his body, it disappeared without a trace, just like the net array.
<br><br>
Although Gerald knew the characteristics of Zen's bloodline, he was still a little unconvinced. He didn't believe that he couldn't suppress the bloodline.
<br><br>
The truth energy was again infused and dispersed into Zen's body.
<br><br>
Gerald became tired but the ancestry-level bloodline in Zen's body remained the same.
<br><br>
The bloodline remained unaffected, seemingly invincible.
<br><br>
Chapter 3906 Gathering Despite having spent so much effort, Gerald had failed to suppress the bloodline within Zen's body—it was rather embarrassing.
<br><br>
All he knew was that Zen had fused with a powerful bloodline, but he couldn't tell the bloodline's grade or rank in the Eternal Scroll Painting, and Zen hadn't given him all the information.
<br><br>
"The power of the bloodline is simply inconceivable." After a moment of being awestruck, Gerald insisted on giving it another go. "I'll call Judson over to help!"
<br><br>
From the looks of it, it seemed he wouldn't stop until he managed to help Zen suppress his bloodline.
<br><br>
After hearing what Gerald asked him to do, Judson also showed great interest.
<br><br>
It was because of their special bloodlines that the Chaos Ancient Gods were all powerful. Naturally, they were highly concerned about other unique and powerful bloodlines as well.
<br><br>
Once Judson came over, he discussed the matter with Gerald. The two then worked together to suppress Zen's bloodline, but with disappointing results.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline remained at the top in terms of energy level, and it could work out energy that restrained the enemy's energy, accomplishing a great task with little effort by clever maneuvers.
<br><br>
Although they tried both the internal and external forces, neither of them worked.
<br><br>
This time around, even the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't know what to do with it.
<br><br>
"When I first entered the Supreme Pure Realm, I encountered over a hundred crises. Sometimes, even after trying every single available means, I still couldn't overcome certain obstacles," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "But at the time, I didn't complain. It was my first time entering the Supreme Pure Realm. Everything was so strange...I needed to explore it all step by step, even fighting with my life..."
<br><br>
Entering a strange domain meant coming across more unknown difficulties and dangers, but he also gained much from it.
<br><br>
Zen's ancestry-level bloodline was truly powerful.
<br><br>
No one in even the Four Spirits Sect had obtained the complete ancestrylevel bloodline.
<br><br>
This 'unknown' served as a great test for Zen, as well as a great opportunity.
<br><br>
As for how to control the ancestry-level bloodline, all he could do was explore step by step.
<br><br>
After returning to the Dark Haze Peak, Zen tried communicating with the ancestry-level bloodline to see if there was any turn of events.
<br><br>
In the Victory Province beside the Pear Hill were many black ships in a row.
<br><br>
The Black Ship's captain stood at the bow along with the Grandmaster of Heaven, followed by the other members of the Black Ship. All of them wore serious expressions.
<br><br>
"Will Othniel play tricks?" the captain asked uneasily.
<br><br>
The pair had made a vow through the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake. According to the vow, Othniel wouldn't attack the Grandmaster of Heaven before they took down the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Instead, their agreement entailed they would attack the Pear Hill together.
<br><br>
But as the Grandmaster of Heaven just arrived with the Black Ship members in the Victory Province, Judson, another Chaos Ancient God, had also arrived at the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Even with two Chaos Ancient Gods guarding the Pear Hill, the Grandmaster of Heaven had still decided to make a move until Othniel stopped him.
<br><br>
According to the latter, the Pear Hill likely had an extremely powerful trump card. Now that it had the two Chaos Ancient Gods supporting them, he was afraid they'd suffer losses if they acted too rashly. At this point, he had already summoned another couple of Chaos Ancient Gods for help— Herbert and Lamont.
<br><br>
The three Chaos Ancient Gods followed the Purge Way, meaning they remained on the Element Spirit race's side.
<br><br>
The three of them gathering meant a great threat to the Nihility race. Even the Grandmaster of Heaven would find it difficult to deal with them—it was rather worrying.
<br><br>
As Othniel called for help, the Pear Hill also called for strong reinforcements.
<br><br>
In the past couple of days, the captain of the Black Ship already felt a few strong space fluctuations—it was obvious that some powerful warriors had arrived at the Pear Hill through space channels.
<br><br>
Among the three parties, they were the only ones lacking strong reinforcements. The longer they waited, the greater their disadvantage was.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven seemed very calm, even a little relaxed.
<br><br>
"The conflict between them is greater," said the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"There is no need for us to rush along and steal the show."
<br><br>
A battle was inevitable between those who believed in the Purge Way and those who believed in the Finale Way—these opposing forces produced the greatest conflict in the Source World.
<br><br>
Initially, the Grandmaster of Heaven descended to the Source World in quite a hurry, but he finally figured things out.
<br><br>
The Nihility race didn't need to be all that anxious about a fight.
<br><br>
While they kept their voices low in the conversation, the Evil God was near enough to pick it up—they hadn't considered having to hide anything from him.
<br><br>
The Evil God seemed focused on finding the tentacle, indifferent to anything else.
<br><br>
But behind his demeanor, he had his own plans.
<br><br>
And he decided it was likely the best time to carry them out.
<br><br>
Everything worked to his advantage now. He had completely got rid of Zen's control and he had devoured Usman. Moreover, he had the chance to take advantage of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
It was his goal to grow stronger in the shortest time possible before finding the perfect opportunity to control everything there, including this powerful being.
<br><br>
The Evil God gazed at the Grandmaster of Heaven from behind, malice filling his eyes.
<br><br>
In the Taoism Province, west of the Pear Hill… The Taoism Province was very close to the Pear Hill and was ruled by the Pear Hill. Many humans lived across the area—it had countries, cities, and villages.
<br><br>
The people of the Taoism Province raised their heads to look up at the sky.
<br><br>
In the boundless blue, they found a twisted silhouette, as though someone had twisted the very sky into a pretzel.
<br><br>
While there was nothing concrete, so long as they looked up, they could feel the pressure.
<br><br>
If someone used Grand Teleportation to get into the space channel for observation, they'd find an enormous body nearly ten million feet high hidden within—it was Othniel hiding in there.
<br><br>
His means of hiding wasn't anything impressive, but he never intended to hide well in the first place.
<br><br>
Herbert and Lamont both rushed over—the moment either of them arrived, Othniel would make a move.
<br><br>
While waiting, Othniel also contacted the Divine Farmer to ask for the necessary support from the Element Spirit race. The latter delivered the Element Spirit race's message, telling him that they would take action at the most critical moment.
<br><br>
But Othniel could sense the bitterness in the Divine Farmer's tone.
<br><br>
While Claire had previously been killed by Gerald's Poison of Decomposition, she hadn't truly died. But it affected Yellow Thearch, nearly killing him.
<br><br>
If the Element Spirit race still wanted to directly participate in the war, the Divine Farmer himself was going to be the next victim—it was definitely not something the Divine Farmer was willing to see.
<br><br>
But at this point, he had no choice.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A strangely-shaped cage suddenly appeared in the air above the Taoism Province.
<br><br>
Its structure was truly exquisite, like a well-crafted artwork.
<br><br>
A space fluctuation emerged from it before a great figure appeared—it was none other than Herbert, one of the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
He had no intention to hide his arrival whatsoever. When his great body left the cage, his aura spread in all directions like an invisible storm, wandering throughout the entire Taoism Province.
<br><br>
The aura contained a form of truth energy that could imprison everything— all the living beings in the entire province were suppressed, left unable to breathe.
<br><br>
"This day arrived earlier than I expected," Herbert said slowly.
<br><br>
His stand was not as firm as Lamont's or Othniel's.
<br><br>
For so long, he had Fuxi trapped, giving him the chance to persuade him to change side, but the latter failed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3907 Yan's Golden Dress Herbert was the most gentle among the six Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
However, he had chosen the Purge Way because, on behalf of the Element Spirit race, the Yellow Thearch had promised him that the chaos would exist forever.
<br><br>
Herbert didn't care much for his own life, but the Yellow Thearch's words piqued his interest.
<br><br>
In the previous round of chaos, most of his clansmen had perished when the Finale Way was being executed. Even his one true love didn't make it out alive. This was one of the main reasons why he wasn't swayed by Fuxi.
<br><br>
In Herbert's eyes, Fuxi indeed had a great talent, but there was almost no possibility of him completing the Finale Way.
<br><br>
"When the end comes, we won't stand a chance," said Othniel gravely.
<br><br>
Once the chaos reached a certain extent, the needle would emerge.
<br><br>
The people who advocated the Purge Way now needed to eliminate anyone who was obsessed with the Finale Way, and then lastly, they needed to exterminate all the other creatures in the Source World.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, they had already started the process of extermination.
<br><br>
Previously, Othniel played a big role in killing creatures in three hundred provinces.
<br><br>
"Well, what're we waiting for?" Herbert was already fully aware of the situation at hand, and had resigned himself to his fate. Thus, he saw no need to hesitate.
<br><br>
Othniel nodded. Just then, a human flew towards them from the ground.
<br><br>
He was a native of the Taoism Province. He had once been to the Pear Hill for further study, and now his cultivation base was at the ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
Facing the huge figures before him, he surprisingly felt calm. Mustering up all his strength, he shouted at the two Chaos Ancient Gods, "Great Chaos Ancient Gods! The chaos created you for the completion of the Finale Way, not the other way around!"
<br><br>
Most of the people who had acknowledged the Finale Way believed that the Chaos Ancient Gods should unite together.
<br><br>
But in the end, things went awry. There was a great divide among the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
Othniel looked at the tiny human expressionlessly. A ray of light suddenly flashed in his huge eye, and the human found that he couldn't move, frozen in the air.
<br><br>
Splash! With a crisp sound, the miniscule human shattered into countless pieces.
<br><br>
Every fragment floated aimlessly in the space.
<br><br>
Herbert frowned at his fellow Chaos Ancient God. As he pointed at the fragments, an invisible cage enveloped what once was the tiny human from the Taoism Province.
<br><br>
When the cage shrank, it skillfully pieced all the fragments together, restoring the human's original shape.
<br><br>
His body was flawless and brought back to normal, but he had lost all his vitality in the process.
<br><br>
"I don't like too much chaos," Herbert commented under his breath.
<br><br>
Othniel sneered disdainfully, "Restoring him consumes more energy, which leads to more chaos."
<br><br>
Suddenly, a wave of incredibly powerful energy surged out of Othniel's body.
<br><br>
The wave rippled all over the Taoism Province, shaking the very core of the earth beneath it.
<br><br>
Every building, mountain, river, and creature disintegrated into mounds of dust under the force of the vibration.
<br><br>
Very few warriors at the Other Shore Realm survived, but they were seriously injured.
<br><br>
Othniel knew these creatures would be killed sooner or later. He had just sped up the process. He felt absolutely no pity for them.
<br><br>
Herbert shook his head when he saw what Othniel had done. Stretching out his slender fingers, he gently waved his hands in the air.
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! Blue pillars rose from the cracked earth, one after another, forming a circle around the Pear Hill. These blue pillars continued to rise until they pierced the very skies.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was a prison now. Everything within it was doomed.
<br><br>
From the other end of the province, the people of the Black Ship could see the pillars rising.
<br><br>
"Herbert has made his move," the captain of the Black Ship said with a nod.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes were also fixed on the rising blue pillars.
<br><br>
"Now that the Pear Hill is being besieged, let's see how they will deal with it."
<br><br>
He was always very calm.
<br><br>
Although the Chaos Ancient Gods were difficult to deal with, he knew what he needed to do.
<br><br>
The six truth-level theurgies had been thoroughly studied. For people like the Grandmaster of Heaven, he was more afraid of the unknown than this.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen, despite looking like the weakest one of the lot, made him anxious.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had been able to control his Fishing Drum. Even now, the Grandmaster of Heaven was still confused as to how he did it.
<br><br>
He clenched his fists as he thought resolutely, 'I need to capture him.' The moment the first blue pillar emerged from the earth, a huge vibration was transmitted into the Pear Hill, and the hill sounded the alarm.
<br><br>
All the mountain leaders and sect leaders ordered their people to return to their positions.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had already briefed them on what was to come when she summoned them.
<br><br>
This was a life and death battle among top masters. Those at the Holy Soul Realm were not qualified to join.
<br><br>
But together, they could form one, massive being using the Cloud Cover Array.
<br><br>
It was only through this that the Pear Hill would stand a chance against the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
At the top of the Pear Hill, a golden magic array floated in the air. Yan stood at the very center of it.
<br><br>
From afar, the complex golden magic array resembled a long, flowing dress that shone brightly, covering her snake tail.
<br><br>
Buzz! The golden array suddenly began to glow.
<br><br>
At the same time, Yan activated the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
"Let's begin," she said, her voice trembling slightly. There was a trace of nervousness in her eyes.
<br><br>
She hadn't spoken very loudly, but as the words left her lips, they traveled with ease towards the bottom of the hill.
<br><br>
"Begin..."
<br><br>
"Begin..."
<br><br>
"Begin..."
<br><br>
Her voice echoed in the ears of every disciple of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill took up almost the whole province.
<br><br>
The people were arranged according to rank in strength. The ones closer to the top were the strongest, and conversely, those at the foot of the hill were slightly lower in rank.
<br><br>
Of course, the grand leaders of mountains and sects were positioned near the top of the Pear Hill, whereas ordinary sect leaders and disciples were located on the mountainside.
<br><br>
The cities built by province citizens and mortals were mostly at the foot of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Upon hearing Yan's voice, the disciples sat cross-legged and channeled their strength into the golden arrays before them.
<br><br>
Each small golden magic array was a branch. The branches converged into the nine arteries, and the power of the nine arteries finally converged into Yan's "golden dress".
<br><br>
As the energy surged along the golden magic arrays, the white clouds that shrouded the Pear Hill rumbled with activity.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
The power contained in the "golden dress" became terrifyingly strong. After a few moments, it had collected all the complex energy of the disciples of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
It was impossible to harness this much energy without the help of the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
Seeing how everyone was doing their part and sending energy her way, Yan gently touched the magic array with her fingers. The second her fingers connected with the magic array, the energy burst upwards and shot towards the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
With the guidance of the Calculation Civilization, her Energy Shaft had been greatly improved in a short period of time.
<br><br>
However, the Calculation Civilization had also told her that this was still not the complete version of the Energy Shaft. If the expected Energy Shaft was actualized, wars would be completely eradicated. Such an Energy Shaft would bring infinite power and infinite strength.
<br><br>
Raising her right hand resolutely, Yan pointed towards the blue pillars in the distance.
<br><br>
"Go!"
<br><br>
she cried.
<br><br>
Obediently, the Energy Shaft above her head shot out a pale golden light, which rushed towards the blue pillars.
<br><br>
Chapter 3908 A Game Of Seesaw These blue pillars were enough to seal the whole Pear Hill. Once they were formed, it would be difficult to break even if Gerald and Judson joined forces to try.
<br><br>
As such, Herbert was very confident it was foolproof.
<br><br>
However, just as the blue pillars were rising into the sky, a faint golden light shot towards them like a streak of lightning.
<br><br>
As soon as he saw the golden light beam, Herbert gasped. He could feel the immense power contained in it. Spreading out his hands instinctively, he released truth energy from his palms and directed it towards the blue pillars.
<br><br>
Then, the blue pillars were coated in a light blue film, which stabilized them.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
As soon as the pale golden light hit the blue pillars, it exploded violently.
<br><br>
The once stable blue pillars immediately shook like toothpicks, and many even collapsed.
<br><br>
Even Othniel was shocked when he felt the power of the golden light.
<br><br>
It was very easy to distinguish the truth energy. This golden light was obviously not a kind of truth energy from Gerald or Judson, nor could it be from the Snake Goddess or Fuxi. However, if that were the case, then who else in the Pear Hill was strong enough to release such energy? Quickly recovering from his initial shock, Herbert snorted, "It won't be that easy to destroy my prison."
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! From the area where blue pillars collapsed, new ones sprung from the earth to quickly replace them, like a hydra.
<br><br>
Herbert might have been the most quiet among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, but he was also the most determined. Once he decided to make a move, he would prepare solutions to deal with every possible situation he might face.
<br><br>
In his eyes, it was futile for the Pear Hill to use powerful energy to stop the prison from forming. He knew that he'd be able to deal with whatever they threw his way.
<br><br>
From the peak of the Pear Hill, Yan smiled as she watched the golden beam knock down multiple blue pillars.
<br><br>
Tens of thousands of living beings of the Pear Hill were here, including her brother, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi...
<br><br>
This was their last stronghold. No way in hell was she going to sit back and watch it be destroyed before her.
<br><br>
"What the--"
<br><br>
When Yan saw the new blue pillars emerging from the ground, the smile was wiped from her face, and her eyes flashed coldly. Through gritted teeth, she muttered, "Let's see if you can grow pillars faster than I can chop them down."
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, she flicked her ten fingers.
<br><br>
Instantly, the energy that had been pulsating in the "golden dress" below her gathered at the Energy Shaft. Under Yan's control, the Energy Shaft shot out many golden light blades.
<br><br>
The ability to control energy was innate to Yan. The first time she condensed the shadow of Snake Goddess, she had instantly mastered it.
<br><br>
This was why the Snake Goddess had chosen Yan to cultivate the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
The golden light rained on the blue pillars. Any pillar that touched the golden light blades instantly collapsed.
<br><br>
However, no matter how many pillars were smashed to pieces, new ones emerged to take their place. For Herbert, summoning blue pillars was as easy as breathing.
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! Even the massive Pear Hill began to shake slightly under the impact.
<br><br>
Occasionally, mountain peaks would collapse and rocks would roll down along the mountain.
<br><br>
However, no one bothered to bat an eyelash at this collateral damage. This was no big deal compared to what they were up against.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, who had been hovering in the air nearby, watched as the golden light beams tore down pillars while new ones sprouted like bamboos. She pursed her lips, deep in thought.
<br><br>
At this point, Herbert's and Yan's moves could only be regarded as a way to test the water.
<br><br>
Yan shouldn't have been the first to fight, since she was one of the Pear Hill's trump cards.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess had arranged for her to be the first one to take action. Her hope was that by doing so, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race would feel intimidated. At the very least, she wanted to give an impression that the Pear Hill was a force to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
The tug-of-war became like a game of seesaw. Two hours of this back-andforth dynamic passed by.
<br><br>
On the one hand, Herbert's truth energy could last long, and he was not afraid of it being consumed by the passing of time.
<br><br>
On the other, Yan relied on the power of thousands of warriors in the Pear Hill. While these warriors were contributing their power, they were also constantly replenishing the divine crystals Before the war began, the Pear Hill distributed all the divine crystals that had been tucked away over the years. Thus, they could hold out for probably a month.
<br><br>
Another six hours passed.
<br><br>
Both sides appeared to be very patient, especially Yan. This was her first time to face a Chaos Ancient God. She wasn't going to risk it all by being careless! Her eyes flashed determinedly, as she continued sending golden beams of light towards the blue pillars.
<br><br>
However, Othniel didn't feel the same way. Exasperated, he saw no point in what Herbert was doing. If even after eight hours they couldn't build a prison, then they should stop wasting time on it! "Buzz!"
<br><br>
Othniel's huge eyeball flashed suddenly, and a huge ball appeared before him.
<br><br>
Then, spikes that spanned a million feet long appeared one after another all around the ball. As they appeared, they squeezed into the ball. In a short while, there were already over ten thousand spikes inside the ball.
<br><br>
"Shrink!"
<br><br>
Othniel spat impatiently.
<br><br>
The ball began to shrink rapidly, and the one-million-foot long spikes inside the ball were also quickly compressed. Soon the ball was roughly the size of a massive boulder.
<br><br>
Then, Othniel stretched out his hands and touched the surface of the ball gently, and a blue square enveloped the ball. Instantly, the ball was teleported into the Pear Hill without a warning.
<br><br>
Through the Cloud Cover Array, Yan could sense if anything had entered the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
As soon as she noticed the presence of the ball, she flicked her finger towards it.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
A golden light blade hit the ball.
<br><br>
The ball by itself was already on the verge of bursting, since it was loaded to the brim with massive spikes.
<br><br>
Even a full blow from an ordinary warrior at the Other Shore Realm could easily shatter it, let alone Yan's golden light blade.
<br><br>
However, the instant the ball shattered, it exploded and sent the onemillion-foot long spikes raining onto the Cloud Cover Array like meteors.
<br><br>
As the spikes swept across the Pear Hill, peaks were sliced off and craters were formed.
<br><br>
If they were to land on a sect in the Pear Hill, the entire sect would be destroyed, and the people inside would also be crushed to a pulp.
<br><br>
Even the arrays set up on the mountains along the way were destroyed by the spikes.
<br><br>
Seeing that his attack was working, Othniel continued. Three more round balls appeared in front of him, and at the same time, more spikes squeezed in.
<br><br>
In a flash of blue light, more balls were sent into the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
But by now, the Pear Hill knew what to expect.
<br><br>
In a flash, Judson appeared in front of one of the balls, and a glazed goblet had appeared in his hand. It was the Heavenly Glazed Goblet.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Judson threw it at the ball. The goblet swallowed it instantly.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The round ball exploded inside the glazed goblet. The countless spikes were effectively blocked by the goblet's shell.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the second ball was swallowed by Gerald, who had appeared just in time.
<br><br>
The spikes might cause damage to Gerald's body, but ordinary injuries were nothing to him.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess handled the last ball.
<br><br>
While she might be inferior to Gerald and Judson in terms of strength, she was still extremely clever and wise. The instant the third ball appeared over the Pear Hill, she had tossed a thin rope towards it. The moment the rope looped around the ball, it was transported into the interior of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The area in the center of the Pear Hill was incredibly vast. Even though the ball exploded inside the Pear Hill, the walls of the mountain were too incredibly thick that the spikes just buried themselves into the mountain after traveling tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of feet in the rock stratum.
<br><br>
Chapter 3909 Compromise This round of attack was blocked, but Othniel sneered as he said, "Can you block the attack every time?"
<br><br>
The attacks from Othniel and Herbert were mainly aimed at destroying the fragile creatures in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
It was a good idea and was working so far.
<br><br>
The energy that Yan's Energy Shaft had released was so powerful that even the Chaos Ancient Gods couldn't bear it.
<br><br>
Only if Othniel and Herbert killed a large number of disciples, sect leaders and mountain leaders in the Pear Hill would Yan's foundation no longer exist.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
Five more huge balls appeared before Othniel. Once a large number of space spikes were compressed in the five balls, Othniel gently raised his hand and sent the five balls to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"Let me deal with this alone!"
<br><br>
Judson's huge figure flashed above the Pear Hill. He was moving so fast that it gave people whiplash.
<br><br>
His figure split into five, each figure holding a Heavenly Glazed Goblet in their hands.
<br><br>
Bang, bang, bang! With five cracking sounds, the Heavenly Glazed Goblets caught the balls pretty accurately.
<br><br>
After the balls exploded, the spikes in the inner part of the balls could do nothing to the Heavenly Glazed Goblets. Judson had single-handedly blocked Othniel's attack.
<br><br>
When Othniel sensed this, he merely snorted but didn't adjust his methods.
<br><br>
He still compressed the spikes inside the spheres, and sent them into the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
But no matter how many spheres Othniel sent in, Judson blocked every single one of them.
<br><br>
In the Pear Hill, the Snake Goddess had returned to the jadeite platform, her eyes gloomy.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had resisted the attacks of the two Chaos Ancient Gods. But this was still way below the Snake Goddess's expectations.
<br><br>
"Othniel is so irritating! We keep defending the Pear Hill, but he is patient and just won't break in!" the Snake Goddess said, frowning.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was powerful. The Snake Goddess had arranged a great counterattack method in the Pear Hill to deal with the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
She wanted to see which one of the Gods attacked first.
<br><br>
Her intuition told her that Othniel would be the first to break in.
<br><br>
But Othniel wasn't stupid. He did what Herbert had done. He seemed to use formidable methods, but it was all a ruse to stall for time.
<br><br>
"They want to wait for the members of the Black Ship to make the first move," said Fuxi, looking at the other side. He could clearly see a row of black ships floating in the air through the Cloud Cover Array.
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship wanted the Chaos Ancient Gods to make the first move and then intended to reap the benefits. The Chaos Ancient Gods had the same thought.
<br><br>
This was often the case when three parties competed against each other.
<br><br>
"Well then. We'll just wait. I'd like to see who is more patient and who buckles first." The Snake Goddess pursed her lips and smiled.
<br><br>
On the Dark Haze Peak, Zen could see golden light blades shooting out and exploding in quick succession.
<br><br>
Yan's strength was so terrifying, and every time a light blade exploded, it shook the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Zen looked serious.
<br><br>
He had just reached the Eternal Realm and couldn't yet control his bloodline.
<br><br>
The strength he could use in a battle of this level was limited, which annoyed him to no end.
<br><br>
If the Chaos Ancient Gods and the Grandmaster of Heaven were to really launch a large scale attack on the Pear Hill, Yan, who was in control of the Energy Shaft, would probably be their first target.
<br><br>
Zen was worried at this thought.
<br><br>
"I can't use the ancestry-level bloodline. All the changes that the ancestrylevel bloodline has made before were only to restrain the external energy to protect itself. I might as well absorb an origin-level bloodline if this is the case," Zen said, helplessly shaking his head.
<br><br>
Soon after he obtained the ancestry-level bloodline and when he left the Eternal Divine Courtyard and passed through the spaces, the ancestry-level bloodline seemed to suddenly become generous. It even allowed Zen to comprehend the structure of the origin-level bloodlines.
<br><br>
If Zen could adjust the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline by himself, he could then change it into an origin-level bloodline.
<br><br>
But ever since he had left the Eternal Scroll Painting, the ancestry-level bloodline had become more and more independent, no longer giving Zen any rights.
<br><br>
When the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard Zen's voice, he knew that Zen was depressed. He was about to persuade Zen, when Zen, after having exhausted his Chaotic Source Spirits, sliced through his arm, creating a wound.
<br><br>
This time, a larger amount of the ancestry-level bloodline was released.
<br><br>
The surface of the ancestry-level bloodline began to undulate, transforming into the shape of a little monster and roaring at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen didn't understand its strange roar, but he still replied seriously, "I don't care what your purpose of hiding in my body is, but I need strength to get through this!"
<br><br>
He pointed into the distance where three golden light blades exploded in the air. The huge sound waves spread throughout Pear Hill, causing the mountains to sway.
<br><br>
"Do you think you are safe?" Zen sneered. "Can you guarantee that there is no member from the Four Spirits Sect behind them? Knowing your base, they would naturally have a way to defeat me and you!"
<br><br>
Zen could roughly understand the simple idea of the ancestry-level bloodline. It gave him the ability to protect himself, and could help Zen subdue everything.
<br><br>
It wasn't concerned with the powerful strength that Zen was pursuing.
<br><br>
"Aww, aww..."
<br><br>
The fist-sized blood beast was still howling, but its voice grew quieter.
<br><br>
Zen was sure that the Four Spirits Sect was the Instant Civilization.
<br><br>
However, the Four Spirits Sect was not one whole, so he couldn't figure out what exactly their standpoint was.
<br><br>
But from what he knew, even the creatures of the Four Spirits Sect were interested in the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"If you help me, they won't catch me. I don't know what will happen if you don't help me," Zen said, threat evident in his voice.
<br><br>
He had barely finished speaking when the blood beast roared again. Zen felt his body stiffen. His blood dragged his legs away, wanting to escape.
<br><br>
He had just taken a step forward when Zen himself erupted with power.
<br><br>
His legs were now tied together, and he fell to the ground.
<br><br>
"How can I let you get what you want?" Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
He stood up from the ground as he spoke. Forced by the blood to run forward, he quietly exerted his strength and tripped himself again.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline could only control Zen's physical body through his blood. But Zen's body still had bones and meridians.
<br><br>
He still had the upper hand in the fight for the control of his body.
<br><br>
Of course, this seemed only a temporary solution. The future was uncertain.
<br><br>
Zen was obviously worried about it.
<br><br>
Perhaps it had completely understood Zen's words, or perhaps it had realized that it couldn't change Zen's mind for the time being. The little blood beast that was still outside Zen's body groaned as if begging for mercy, and jumped onto Zen's shoulder.
<br><br>
It didn't get in through the wound on Zen's right arm, but waited for Zen's permission.
<br><br>
"Are you willing to compromise?" Zen said, smugly overjoyed. "You should at least let me get an origin-level bloodline theurgy."
<br><br>
Chapter 3910 Black Snakes As Zen spoke his last word, the ancestry-level bloodline began boiling within him.
<br><br>
He sensed that it had used six abilities of the life quadrant, as well as the ability of the space-time quadrant, which ranked a bit lower than eightieth in this quadrant. This was very rare.
<br><br>
These seven abilities mixed together to form the bloodline.
<br><br>
"Is this an origin-level bloodline?" Zen froze for a moment as he pondered.
<br><br>
These three hundred and seventy-three abilities might have infinite combinations, but the origin-level bloodlines the Eternal Divine Courtyard had were those in the four spaces.
<br><br>
Zen made an attempt to activate the bloodline ability and almost immediately felt a burning sensation within, as his body began transforming dramatically.
<br><br>
Thin muscles bulged out and quickly morphed into a layer of thick and solid armor which quickly sank and embedded itself on the surface of his skin, tightly enveloping his entire body.
<br><br>
The sight of his own body left Zen in a dismal state. "You didn't provide me with an origin-level bloodline. You did this to prevent me from letting my blood out again!"
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline seemed unwilling to let Zen separate from it and now this disgusting armor had overtaken his body to prevent him from harming himself and allowing any of it to leave.
<br><br>
"This is not enough to fight them.
<br><br>
Aren't you afraid of being found out by them?"
<br><br>
Zen added a few more threatening remarks, but the ancestry-level bloodline just ignored him and didn't move.
<br><br>
Rumble...
<br><br>
The Pear Hill still shook slightly.
<br><br>
Yan's proficiency in attacking with the Energy Shaft was improving greatly and the golden light blades were being released faster and faster. They had now almost dug up an entire moat around the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Herbert continued driving the growth of the blue pillars. However, as Yan sped up her actions, the blue pillars that surrounded the Pear Hill began weakening and a huge gap appeared among them.
<br><br>
If it went on like this, Yan could possibly completely suppress Herbert.
<br><br>
As for the balls Othniel had thrown in, Judson had grabbed them all one by one.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was humongous, but destroying a province was still an easy task for the Chaos Ancient Gods. The energy Othniel and Herbert had released was already enough to destroy the Pear Hill several times.
<br><br>
But under the protection of Yan and the others, the Pear Hill remained unmoved.
<br><br>
On a black ship, the Grandmaster of Heaven finally could take no more and grew irritable.
<br><br>
After all, Othniel and Herbert were just as much his enemies. The only reason they worked together now was because they shared a common goal.
<br><br>
These two Chaos Ancient Gods led an attack on the Pear Hill and were failing; they were obviously wasting time! "Do they intend to keep stalling for time with this pitiful assault?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked, frowning with annoyance.
<br><br>
Taking note of his anger, the captain of the Black ship responded, "Perhaps they need someone to finally break through and turn the tables."
<br><br>
"You mean they're waiting for me to take action?" queried the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"I think so," the captain said and nodded.
<br><br>
"In that case, let me shatter this stalemate..."
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven waved his hand, and the Six Soul Flags floated up into the air.
<br><br>
As he swayed gently, the black flames on the Six Soul Flags flowed out like endless black snakes entangling with his Cyan Misty Sword.
<br><br>
He stretched a finger out to point at the Cyan Misty Sword and the aura of the life truth spread out.
<br><br>
This got the attention of the captain, the members of the Black Ship and even the Evil God as they sensed the aura.
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship were bewildered at how the Grandmaster of Heaven was able to use the life truth, but they then remembered he had used the space truth before and so thought nothing more of it.
<br><br>
None had any idea how the Grandmaster of Heaven had obtained such an ability.
<br><br>
The Evil God, however, had felt the energy of the Truth Crystal from Zen, and its aura was exactly the same as that of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Once the black snakes in the Cyan Misty Sword were infused with the energy of the life truth, they began circling the Grandmaster of Heaven as if they had come to life.
<br><br>
Ten snakes, twenty, thirty, forty...
<br><br>
In a little more than a moment, he had created more than three hundred black snakes.
<br><br>
Buzz! He shook the Cyan Misty Sword gently and flicked his right hand, and many blue space frames appeared on the black snakes' bodies. The Grandmaster of Heaven then sent them into the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"The Black Ship is taking action as well!" the Snake Goddess announced gravely.
<br><br>
They had been paying close attention to the Grandmaster of Heaven as they battled the two Chaos Ancient Gods. After all, he was certainly more difficult to handle than these two.
<br><br>
"I'll deal with the black flames!"
<br><br>
Gerald had been entangled by the black flames before, and by means of the life truth, a unique formula had been created that extinguished the black flames.
<br><br>
He had experience with these black flames and so felt confident facing them again.
<br><br>
But when he let out his spiritual sense and was about to pull the black snakes out, he found himself perplexed. He was unable to detect any traces of the black fire snakes within the range of his spiritual sense! Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were having the same trouble.
<br><br>
The intense energy was usually hard to miss with one's spiritual sense. It now being undetectable was truly strange.
<br><br>
At that moment, inside the Heavenly Shuttle Sect in the middle of the Pear Hill, many members of the Snake Goddess race continued offering the energy they had.
<br><br>
Swish! A black snake appeared seemingly out of nowhere and headed straight for the sect leader.
<br><br>
The leader of the Heavenly Shuttle Sect was a powerful Chaotic Source Realm warrior. She was still going through the test of the Soul City, and was only one step away from the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
She knew this snake coming at her was powerful and immediately employed her Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
But the black snake's speed was beyond what she had expected.
<br><br>
It was too late, because when her Other Shore Token was activated, the black snake had already bitten her on the neck and her body fell lifeless...
<br><br>
"Master!"
<br><br>
"Master..."
<br><br>
The disciples of the Heavenly Shuttle Sect fell into a panic. Some stepped back, some tried to protect the sect leader and some attacked the black snake in vengeance.
<br><br>
However, the black snake was incredibly quick and they could not track it with the spiritual sense.
<br><br>
They stood no chance against it; almost all the Heavenly Shuttle Sect's disciples were killed within 30 seconds. Only a few smart and shrewd disciples managed to escape using the Grand Teleportation technique.
<br><br>
Such massacres were taking place all across the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others couldn't locate the black snakes, but they sensed the hysteria, horror and fear among the commotion.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were getting agitated as their numbers started dwindling.
<br><br>
"All sect leaders and mountain leaders, please do whatever you can to kill those black snakes!"
<br><br>
She issued the order and flashed to the Heavenly Shuttle Sect. Her heart sank and broke when she saw their members fall to the ground, one after the other.
<br><br>
The black snake hunted for a while and now wished to hide in the mountain. But before it could drill into the ground, the Snake Goddess got hold of it! It struggled in her grip and black flames burst out from it, burning the Snake Goddess' white fingers, contorting and charring them. But she seemed to feel no pain. She used the energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess to suppress the snake and smash it to pieces! Chapter 3911 Take The Initiative To Attack Blood splattered across the ground as the Snake Goddess killed a black snake, then she quickly moved to the next place.
<br><br>
She wasn't the only one who attacked. Upon hearing her call, Fuxi, the sect, and mountain leaders also jumped into action and cleared the black snakes in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
However, the area covered by their spiritual sense was much smaller than that of the Snake Goddess. Thus, they could only kill the black snakes near the central area of the Pear Hill. They couldn't reach the black snakes beyond that area.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the spiritual sense couldn't be used to locate the three hundred black snakes, so it was quite hard to kill them.
<br><br>
When they sensed that a warrior of the Pear Hill had died, that was only when they could go to the place and kill.
<br><br>
The wild flames were intense, but the Grandmaster of Heaven had used them to create three hundred black snakes, so the power was divided.
<br><br>
Warriors at the Holy Soul Realm could resist them, as long as they were careful.
<br><br>
Although they killed the black snakes, the Pear Hill had suffered many casualties.
<br><br>
Within five minutes, the entire Pear Hill was in a fix.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess surmised that after the group of snakes entered the Pear Hill, over seven hundred members of the Pear Hill had died, which included many elites.
<br><br>
Although the Pear Hill had many members, all the warriors who died were her members. No one could blame her for feeling devastated.
<br><br>
Soon enough, Yan felt the panic of the people of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
After all, those mountain and sect leaders contributed nearly half of the energy needed. When they left to kill the black snakes, the energy used for the Energy Shaft naturally became unstable.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Yan was quite skilled. She restrained the blue pillars that grew like mad with constant adjustment.
<br><br>
When the mountain and sect leaders returned to their positions, the supply of energy to the Energy Shaft became stable again.
<br><br>
Zen, who was in the Dark Haze Peak, also saw the commotion, but he did not act rashly. Before the war, the Snake Goddess said that she was in command of everything.
<br><br>
Elizabeth, Pearce, and some others were in another main peak and infused energy into the Cloud Cover Array as well, but they also did not participate directly in the battle.
<br><br>
When they returned to the jadeite platform, Fuxi looked calm as usual, but the Snake Goddess was a little worried.
<br><br>
"If everything continued like this, I'm afraid that the Pear Hill won't be able to hold on," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
Fuxi glanced at the Snake Goddess. He knew that she had a kind heart and didn't want to see her people die.
<br><br>
However, it was common for millions of creatures to die in such a largescale war.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid they won't come in," said Fuxi, lost in thought.
<br><br>
According to the Snake Goddess's plan, everything would be successful if they could trick and lure a Chaos Ancient God into the Pear Hill then kill him. Now, it seemed that it was never going to happen.
<br><br>
While Fuxi and the Snake Goddess racked their brains for a solution, the Grandmaster of Heaven, who was in the distance, shook the Six Soul Flags once more, and hundreds of black snakes dived into Pear Hill again.
<br><br>
Five minutes later, it appeared that things just repeated.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and her people killed the black snakes once again, but more than a few thousand disciples of the Pear Hill had died! The core disciples were always few. How could they hold off against such a slaughter? At that moment, the Snake Goddess turned from worried to aggressive. She looked at Fuxi and said, "If we let the real Snake Goddess and real Fuxi take over our physical bodies, we can fight our way out."
<br><br>
After she came back to the Pear Hill, she talked to the real Snake Goddess once.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess quickly accepted her identity as an avatar. She felt the real Snake Goddess's character and real aura. She was the same as the real Snake Goddess, but the real one lived longer and was more knowledgeable.
<br><br>
She didn't mind that the real Snake Goddess occupied her body.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the real Snake Goddess remained trapped in Stage Thirtythree and the one she referred to right now was only an energy soul, so she could not really control her.
<br><br>
However, Fuxi strongly opposed the idea. Even if she begged him in private, he would never compromise.
<br><br>
But now that the people of the Pear Hill were dying one after another and they couldn't find a way to stop it, they had to change their previous strategy and take the initiative to attack.
<br><br>
The safest way to do that was to let the real Snake Goddess and real Fuxi take over their bodies.
<br><br>
"No need." Fuxi shook his head.
<br><br>
"Fuxi." The Snake Goddess stared at her husband. She was begging him.
<br><br>
Of course, she knew that Fuxi was a proud man.
<br><br>
Then again, he was the number one warrior when the Chaos Ancient Gods were excluded and was said to be the strongest warrior at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Even someone as powerful as Yellow Thearch, who had the Element Spirit race's support, was still no match for him.
<br><br>
Now, to let someone occupy his body was ridiculous.
<br><br>
Even if that person was the real Fuxi, he still found it hard to accept.
<br><br>
When he felt that the Snake Goddess had stared at him for a while, he finally felt annoyed. He simply waved his hand and said, "I'll give him only two hours! After that, I will take back my physical body."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven was quite satisfied with his attack method.
<br><br>
In many cases, small tricks often had a good effect.
<br><br>
The people in the Pear Hill guarded the place with all their might, so he naturally wouldn't charge recklessly.
<br><br>
The best option was to force them out step by step while he waited. That was the most effortless way.
<br><br>
When he released the fifth wave of black snakes, the situation in the Pear Hill far away finally changed.
<br><br>
The white clouds that surrounded the Pear Hill quickly dissipated and revealed the vast, green mountain range.
<br><br>
As the Cloud Cover Array was removed, an enormous figure, which was millions of feet high, emerged. It was neither Judson nor Gerald, but the real Fuxi, who had activated the Wild God Body! The corners of his mouth curved up in relief.
<br><br>
"I haven't fought for a long time..."
<br><br>
Then, he spread out his hands, and the blood in his body flowed at insane speeds.
<br><br>
Compared to Fuxi in this round of chaos, the real Fuxi had more power and control over his bloodline! "Clap!"
<br><br>
He clapped his hands, then two marks of Eight Diagrams appeared on his palms.
<br><br>
"You can make a move now!"
<br><br>
As he spoke, he slammed his hands hard on the ground.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Othniel and Herbert were both in the Taoism Province. Suddenly, enormous marks of Eight Diagrams appeared under their feet, and the same happened to Grandmaster of Heaven, who was in the Victory Province.
<br><br>
"This is..."
<br><br>
Upon seeing the big mark, the Grandmaster of Heaven felt a chill run down his spine.
<br><br>
In turn, he quickly grew up to ten million feet high. With a wave of his hand, he sucked the black ship into his long sleeve and suddenly teleported away.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Powerful palm prints immediately fell from the top of the marks of Eight Diagrams, and a bottomless pit appeared on the ground.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven only took away one black ship. The other black ships swiftly turned into thousands of pieces as the palm prints covered them.
<br><br>
Although these black ships could repair themselves, the captain of the Black Ship still felt crushed when he saw that the black ships were destroyed just like that.
<br><br>
Still, the real Fuxi didn't stop attacking, and his large hands continuously slapped the ground. As the palm prints kept coming down, the Grandmaster of Heaven, Othniel, and Herbert had no choice but to move and dodge.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was confused when he dodged and retreated.
<br><br>
He had never seen Fuxi become so powerful when he fought against him before. It seemed that he suddenly became a different person, which reminded the Grandmaster of Heaven of the Fuxi in the past.
<br><br>
This was not a good omen.
<br><br>
Just as Othniel and Herbert still dodged, the real Snake Goddess, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Gerald, and Judson all rushed towards the Victory Province at the same time.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess planned that they would all charge forward to take down the Grandmaster of Heaven first, then deal with the Chaos Ancient Gods next.
<br><br>
Chapter 3912 The Second Truth The marks of Eight Diagrams appeared one after another under the Grandmaster of Heaven's feet while he dodged the palm prints that kept descending from the sky.
<br><br>
The ground behind him was densely packed with palm prints, which formed a wide ditch.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The moment he avoided another one palm print, he became shocked when he saw the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
His spiritual sense always covered an area with a radius of over a hundred million miles. He saw that the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Gerald, and Herbert were fast approaching! "Eastern Emperor Taiyi."
<br><br>
Although it was his first time to descend into the chaos, the Black Ship was always the one that gathered the information from the Source World then sent it to him before.
<br><br>
Of course, he knew that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had defeated Emperor Charm easily.
<br><br>
He also knew that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had gotten trapped in Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
It must be the case that someone had taken over his physical body, which greatly enhanced his strength.
<br><br>
The truth behind it might be a puzzle for others, but the Grandmaster of Heaven easily figured out what had happened.
<br><br>
Now, Fuxi had become much more powerful, and perhaps the Snake Goddess's strength had also increased. They might have let the real Fuxi and the real Snake Goddess take over their bodies.
<br><br>
Since the Grandmaster of Heaven faced them alone, the pressure he felt naturally increased.
<br><br>
Had it been someone else, they probably would've run away by now. He could at least join the two Chaos Ancient Gods who were in the Taoism Province.
<br><br>
Yet, he didn't choose to escape.
<br><br>
Instead of continuing to dodge the palm prints of Eight Diagrams, he suddenly stopped in midair! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Fuxi continued to slap the ground in the Pear Hill, but the palm prints went through the Grandmaster of Heaven's body.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was like a ghost in the air, and he avoided all his attacks.
<br><br>
That was the ability of the Chaos Ancient God Othniel—the Void Illusory World, which could create a unique separate space for him to stay.
<br><br>
"Grandmaster of Heaven, long time no see!" the bright-eyed Snake Goddess exclaimed.
<br><br>
Because it was the real Snake Goddess, she spoke in an unusually confident manner.
<br><br>
"Hmph, it's just as I thought. Even if you have a complete body to use, you still can't bring your full strength into play," the Grandmaster of Heaven coldly shot back.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Snake Goddess spread her fingers and gently lifted them.
<br><br>
In turn, crimson energy filaments burst out from her snow-white skin.
<br><br>
The energy filaments constantly whirled and changed, then finally turned into a gigantic shadow of Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Usually, after the Snake Goddess activated her Wild God Body, her body would grow as high as eight million feet, while her shadow reached up to ten million feet high! This time, however, her shadow extended up to a hundred million feet high.
<br><br>
It covered the sky and the sun, and contained endless energy! The Grandmaster of Heaven, Gerald, and Judson looked very small in front of the shadow of Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"It should be enough to kill you," the Snake Goddess said seriously.
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, her large shadow slammed down the Grandmaster of Heaven's head.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
The Void Illusory World was completely independent from the outside space. Although the shadow of Snake Goddess was powerful, it didn't harm the Grandmaster of Heaven at all.
<br><br>
Still, she was in no way discouraged. The energy beams on the shadow's hands continuously entangled with the Grandmaster of Heaven until they completely wrapped around him.
<br><br>
"It's useless," the Grandmaster of Heaven sneered.
<br><br>
"Really? The Void Illusory World may not be invincible as you think!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, Gerald, who was at the side, released powerful life energy.
<br><br>
Numerous silkworms with wings came out of the dark green fog, and each of them had a pair of sharp teeth that glowed blue on their heads.
<br><br>
They were the World-devouring Silkworms, a kind of creature Gerald had created.
<br><br>
He knew that he would fight against the other Chaos Ancient Gods one day, so he was naturally prepared.
<br><br>
He created the World-devouring Silkworms to deal with Othniel, but he did not expect that the Grandmaster of Heaven had Othniel's ability. Thus, they came handy at the moment.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
The World-devouring Silkworms flapped their wings and flew towards the Grandmaster of Heaven. The sharp teeth on their heads clattered and devoured the space bit by bit. The task looked as easy as eating leaves to them.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't know that Gerald had such a power.
<br><br>
When he saw the World-devouring Silkworms move forward to devour him, he had no choice but to get out of the Void Illusory World.
<br><br>
Just as he came out, however, the Snake Goddess's energy beams were already there to bind him! "Pfft!"
<br><br>
Crimson energy beams quickly corroded his body! Even the body of a warrior at the Eternal Realm could not endure the erosion from the shadow of Snake Goddess. At that point, the Grandmaster of Heaven's skin became charred.
<br><br>
However, it only lasted for quite a short period.
<br><br>
A strong force of life truth suddenly emerged from the Grandmaster of Heaven's body. A green mist rolled out, and not only did it repair his body, but it also left a thick layer of tissue on his skin.
<br><br>
The mist formed the layer of tissue, especially to deal with the energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
As a result, the erosion caused by the shadow of Snake Goddess wouldn't be as strong.
<br><br>
"Life truth? He can also use the life truth! How did he make it?" Gerald said in utter disbelief.
<br><br>
It wasn't a big deal that the Grandmaster of Heaven used Othniel's theurgy, as perhaps Othniel had made an exchange with him.
<br><br>
The big deal was that the Grandmaster of Heaven also exhibited the life truth, which was puzzling.
<br><br>
But now they were in a battle, so Gerald didn't have the time to think about it.
<br><br>
When he saw that the Grandmaster of Heaven was about to forcefully come out of shadow of Snake Goddess, his body suddenly slipped, and his large tail stabbed the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Poison of Decomposition at the end of his tail was incurable. Someone as powerful as Claire still died after she was poisoned, and the Grandmaster of Heaven was no exception.
<br><br>
But of course, the Grandmaster of Heaven knew Gerald better than Claire did.
<br><br>
Thus, he had decided to pay particular attention to Gerald's movements. As soon as he saw the needle stab towards him, he turned over and quickly avoided it.
<br><br>
The second he dodged the tail, a golden sword shadow fell straight towards him.
<br><br>
Without even looking at it, the Grandmaster of Heaven held the Cyan Misty Sword in his hand.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang, Bang..."
<br><br>
The huge swords clashed against each other, and the sword radiance danced in all directions.
<br><br>
Every collision was powerfully destructive. If the creatures in the Victory Province looked up, the dazzling golden light would blind their eyes.
<br><br>
After the Grandmaster of Heaven and the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had exchanged dozens of sword strikes in an instant, the Grandmaster of Heaven suddenly stepped into the void. His big body was like a ghost as he flew south, which was the location of the Taoism Province. His goal was to get the other two Chaos Ancient Gods who were in the Taoism Province involved.
<br><br>
"Go after him!"
<br><br>
At that point, the Snake Goddess, Gerald, and the others followed him closely.
<br><br>
At first, Othniel and Herbert, who were in the Taoism Province, were still panicking when they faced Fuxi's attack.
<br><br>
However, the attacks of the Eight Diagrams and the palm prints came a little delayed as they reached the Taoism Province. Furthermore, it wasn't hard to avoid them with their abilities.
<br><br>
At the same time, the two Chaos Ancient Gods also noticed that the Pear Hill took the initiative to attack the Grandmaster of Heaven! Othniel and the Grandmaster of Heaven were not on the same side. In reality, Othniel was afraid of the Grandmaster of Heaven when it came to strength. Since the Pear Hill had exhibited powerful capabilities, it would be a good thing for them if they took the opportunity to kill the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
After all, the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake didn't require Othniel to help the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
It turned out that all this time, the two Chaos Ancient Gods chose to standby and not interfere. What they didn't expect was that the Grandmaster of Heaven evaded the attacks launched by the people of Pear Hill, then charged straight towards them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3913 A Sneak Attack Eternal Realm masters wouldn't take long to cross an entire province.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven and the people chasing him were far stronger than ordinary Eternal Realm warriors, and as a result, were much faster.
<br><br>
That was why Othniel and Herbert had to make a quick decision.
<br><br>
"Should we avoid them or fight?" Herbert asked, puzzled.
<br><br>
The goal that was Herbert's priority was to subvert the Pear Hill and help the Element Spirit race complete the Purge Way.
<br><br>
He didn't have an opinion about Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, or even Zen. It was purely a matter of stance on the future.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Othniel looked hesitant.
<br><br>
Their previous attack against the Oneness Sky Palace had been a complete failure. The people belonging to all the forces involved, like the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race had died or escaped during the war. Even Claire had been killed.
<br><br>
Now, Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's strength had greatly increased, and with the help of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the other two Chaos Ancient Gods, Pear Hill had become an invincible force.
<br><br>
If the Grandmaster of Heaven were to be defeated or even killed by them, what would await him and Herbert before the Pear Hill? These thoughts lingered in Othniel's mind for a while before he made his decision. "We should fight!" he said eventually.
<br><br>
He had barely finished saying this when blue dust appeared in his huge eye.
<br><br>
If one looked carefully, they'd realize that the blue dust motes were numerous cubes the size of a fist. They only looked tiny like dust before Othniel's huge form.
<br><br>
The blue cubes disappeared from Othniel's eye and appeared to the east of the Taoism Province, floating irregularly in the air.
<br><br>
These cubes were insignificant to the powerful warriors who had activated the Wild God Bodies.
<br><br>
Gerald warned the others as he noticed the sudden appearance of the blue dust. "Be careful! They're inverse spaces released by Othniel!"
<br><br>
The moment Gerald alerted his companions, Othniel activated the cubes.
<br><br>
The blue spaces, originally the size of a fist, expanded rapidly to a width of about one million feet each. These inverse spaces instantly filled up the space at the south of the Taoism Province.
<br><br>
These inverse spaces were a special type of space. There seemed to be nothing inside, but they were, in fact, filled with a special energy.
<br><br>
Gerald, the Snake Goddess, and the others felt like they were running in water the moment they were trapped in these spaces. Their speed slowed down considerably.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was also caught up in an inverse space, but Othniel could control these spaces at will. Under his control, the inverse spaces before the Grandmaster of Heaven quickly turned back into the size of a fist.
<br><br>
Once his path was cleared, the Grandmaster of Heaven regained his former speed and in just a few seconds, had left the Snake Goddess's group far behind.
<br><br>
The real Fuxi, who was in the Pear Hill, became worried as he witnessed this scene unfold. He turned around and told Zen, "I'll leave the great array in your care. I have to go and help them!"
<br><br>
Saying thus, he created a space channel and entered it in a flash. In just a second, he was gone.
<br><br>
The great array that the real Fuxi had mentioned to Zen had something to do with the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse race had always been a force to be reckoned with in the Source World. This race was omnipresent and extremely rich.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch had tried to befriend the Ear Mouse race many times, but the Ear Mice had always stayed neutral. They seemed uninterested in both the Purge Way and the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Every businessman was believed to always be on the fence. Yellow Thearch didn't really care about what the Ear Mice thought as long as they didn't side with the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
But King leuan's real intentions were not what it showed the world.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice's great fortune relied on their huge numbers, making it impossible for them to follow the Purge Way.
<br><br>
A long time ago, the Ear Mice had secretly allied themselves with the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
King leuan was at the Eternal Realm, but its strength wasn't even noteworthy among the other Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
However, no one in the Source World could compete with it in terms of wealth.
<br><br>
The divine crystals that King Ieuan had collected for so many years might account for more than half of the amount in the entire Source World.
<br><br>
These divine crystals contained pure energies. Many people coveted such a great fortune but none of them knew where the Ear Mice hid them.
<br><br>
Even Zen had known nothing about this until recently. He was astonished that all the divine crystals were hidden in the Pear Hill. With her unprecedented talent, the Snake Goddess had used the divine crystals to set up an array, which had turned out to be a huge trap.
<br><br>
Even a Chaos Ancient God would find it hard to escape this trap alive if they were to fall into it.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi had previously wanted to lure Othniel or Herbert into this trap, but neither of them had dared approach the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Because of this, the people in the hill had been forced to leave their field and fight.
<br><br>
Now that Fuxi had left to join the battle, the great array was handed over to Zen.
<br><br>
Once Fuxi left, the lines on the surface of the jadeite platform began to flash, a green light gathering beneath Zen's feet.
<br><br>
Zen had now become the center of the array.
<br><br>
The whole of Pear Hill instantly became translucent in Zen's view, and a massive amount of divine crystals appeared before his eyes.
<br><br>
"There are so many divine crystals!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
The divine crystals were equally distributed around the Pear Hill as they circled around it.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was nearly as broad as the province where it lay, and these divine crystals occupied close to one seventh of its entire surface. Counting these divine crystals one by one would undoubtedly lead to an astronomical figure.
<br><br>
"If we fully activate the energy of these divine crystals, will it be enough to destroy the entire Pear Hill?" Zen asked, dazed.
<br><br>
"There's no need for so many. Ten percent of them will do," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
It was not difficult to invade a defenseless Pear Hill. Any Eternal Realm warrior could do that alone. However, this great array that had been formed by divine crystals had the power to kill even a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
At the center of this great array sat several powerful creatures, King Ieuan of the Ear Mouse race in the lead.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess had asked for help a few days ago, the core members of the Ear Mouse race had come to preside over this great array in succession.
<br><br>
Zen observed the goings-on for a while before he looked around, only to meet his sister's gaze. The siblings exchanged a warm smile.
<br><br>
As the battle went on, the fate of the Pear Hill had now been handed over to them.
<br><br>
An intense fight was taking place in the Taoism Province, while the Pear Hill was strangely quiet in contrast, as if they weren't involved in the war.
<br><br>
The disciples and the other members on the Pear Hill were relieved for a moment.
<br><br>
They couldn't participate in the higher-level battle. All they could do was pray silently as they remained in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
It was then that a huge figure suddenly appeared in the sky above the Pear Hill. It was a creature with white hair all over the body.
<br><br>
The appearance of this creature caused an invisible chill to quickly spread over them from above.
<br><br>
The temperature dropped sharply, and silver white frosts began to spread down from the top of the Pear Hill, like a circular ice ring blooming around it.
<br><br>
Both Zen and Yan raised their heads to try to get a clear look at the figure clearly. Their faces hardened, almost in unison.
<br><br>
This was Lamont, the third Chaos Ancient God who had followed the Purge Way.
<br><br>
Once he arrived at the Pear Hill, he decided to ignore the fight in the Taoism Province and attacked the Pear Hill first.
<br><br>
He probably believed that since Fuxi had left, there was no one left to guard the Pear Hill, and that it would be an easy task to destroy the hill.
<br><br>
The temperature was still dropping rapidly, many rocks in the Pear Hill freezing and shattering into pieces with a cracking burst.
<br><br>
If the temperature continued to drop, all living creatures in the Pear Hill would freeze to death.
<br><br>
Yan wouldn't allow this to happen. She stretched out her hands, and under her control, the Cloud Cover Array worked to block the deadly cold air attacking the Pear Hill from outside.
<br><br>
Chapter 3914 Activate The Array While isolating the freezing air from the Pear Hill, Yan also activated the energy flow of the Cloud Cover Array.
<br><br>
Not only did the members and disciples of the Pear Hill live in the Pear Hill, there were also many mortals there who could not cultivate.
<br><br>
The temperature did not drop all that low when the frigid air reached the edge of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Even so, for those mortals, it would still be a fatal exposure.
<br><br>
Sensing this, Yan frowned and aimed her energy at the huge creature above! The mission Yan had been given by the Snake Goddess was to amass the power of Pear Hill and do all that was needed to protect it.
<br><br>
However, till now, she had been running a defensive movement only.
<br><br>
After suffering fierce attacks for half a day, she finally had the chance to strike back. Naturally, Yan poured out masses of energy without any hesitation! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh… Huge golden light blades formed and shot upwards.
<br><br>
The energy contained within those golden light blades couldn't be underestimated, not even by the Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
Hiss...
<br><br>
Lamont hovered in the sky and suddenly opened his mouth, taking a deep breath. His huge belly bulged even more.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
The air, which had been sucked into his stomach, suddenly spewed forth again.
<br><br>
The cold air erupting out from the huge body was enough to create a freezing hurricane.
<br><br>
However, the chill was not as fierce as the others had feared. Instead, it formed a gentle white zone of cold beneath him.
<br><br>
When the golden blades entered this zone, they lost momentum, slowed down, and finally stopped. The golden light of the blades' surface suddenly dimmed, and the blades completely melted away in this cold band.
<br><br>
The golden blades possessed energy at a fiery temperature. Though they melted, they also reduced the cold air by several degrees.
<br><br>
Yan's face darkened slightly. She flicked her hands, and more golden light blades appeared, shooting outwards.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful the strength of the Chaos Ancient God was, the truth power he possessed was limited. Given the massive divine crystals in the Pear Hill, Yan could naturally squander them at will! The golden light blades surged up like a kaleidoscope of butterflies, quickly melting through the cold area! After completely heating up the cold band, more golden light blades shot towards Lamont with a violent intent.
<br><br>
Lamont merely looked down at Yan in silence. His originally motionless body suddenly disappeared, and then reappeared on the top of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
He was only one million feet away from Yan! Everyone knew that Lamont was ten million feet tall. One million feet was only a small step for him! Whoosh! The instant he appeared, Lamont was already swinging his fist towards Yan's head.
<br><br>
"Yan!"
<br><br>
Seeing this dilemma, Zen was shocked, and the hair on his body stood on end.
<br><br>
Yan was not at the Eternal Realm, so her physical strength was barely stronger than that of an ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warrior.
<br><br>
Not to mention taking a full blow from the Chaos Ancient God, even if she was hit by only one of Lamont's fingers, she would be smashed to pieces! Facing Lamont's attack, Yan didn't panic.
<br><br>
She reached out her hand, gently stroking the golden dress. A golden shield suddenly enveloped her with a protection radius of hundreds of thousands of feet. Zen on the jadeite platform was also enveloped inside.
<br><br>
Bang! Lamont's punch struck the shield, making a booming sound.
<br><br>
The golden shield, which was fortified and sturdy, merely vibrated slightly.
<br><br>
Then Yan waved her hands, and the golden blades fired forth from the Energy Shaft, traveling at great velocity! Because of the small distance, the first three golden light blades instantly ripped into Lamont's chest.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! With three muffled sounds, three huge and bloody holes appeared on Lamont's chest. Blood gushed out from the holes like a triple waterfall, and the smell of blood pervaded the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Lamont clearly hadn't expected the power of these light blades to be so massive. He had no option but to flee far away in pain! Obviously, Yan didn't intend to let him off so easily. As long as he was within the Pear Hill, he was within range of her attack.
<br><br>
The endless light blades hotly pursued Lamont. With these continuous explosions, a series of golden lights bloomed in the sky.
<br><br>
Zen breathed a sigh of relief. The Cloud Cover Array the Snake Goddess had set up was still powerful, and even the Chaos Ancient God wasn't able to destroy it so easily.
<br><br>
But at this point, an old voice suddenly sounded in Zen's ear. "Zen, if Lamont draws near again, we must seize the opportunity to activate the Divine Crystal Array to trap and kill him in the Pear Hill."
<br><br>
The whisper was the voice of King Ieuan.
<br><br>
It indeed presented a great opportunity when Lamont got so close just now.
<br><br>
But while Zen was worried about Yan's safety, he had completely forgotten about it.
<br><br>
Although King Ieuan controlled the entire Divine Crystal Array, it couldn't activate it, and only Zen had the power to do that from the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
King Ieuan could only remind Zen kindly.
<br><br>
"I see." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
From above the Divine Crystal Array in the Pear Hill, King Ieuan also nodded to the other creatures.
<br><br>
The idea of building the Divine Crystal Array had been King Ieuan's proposal, but to perfect and establish it had still depended on the Snake Goddess. Even the Other Shore Tokens of the several creatures that were in charge of the Divine Crystal Array were searched and obtained by the Snake Goddess and Fuxi in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was also due to the combined power of these Other Shore Tokens that the power of the Divine Crystal Array could be swung into play.
<br><br>
Lamont retreated a short distance and roared at the sky. The muscles in his chest wriggled and then healed themselves.
<br><br>
It was obvious that he was not as cautious as Othniel. The human girl wasn't even at the Eternal Realm, but she had actually hurt him. It was proving a great humiliation! Whoosh! Whoosh! A circle of white cold air emanated from Lamont's body. In a moment, an armor of solid ice formed on the surface of his body, and thus armored, he pounced on Yan again.
<br><br>
Despite Yan's golden light blades being extremely powerful, Lamont still intended to fight her head-on! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
When the golden blades collided head-on with Lamont's armor, something strange happened. As the golden light blades impacted on the armor, their lights flashed and disappeared! Other Chaos Ancient Gods might not dare to resist the golden light blades as Lamont did, but his armor was the nemesis of all pure energy.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Yan hurled out over a hundred golden light blades in quick succession, but they were all absorbed by Lamont's solid ice armor.
<br><br>
Seeing Lamont's huge body dashing over, Yan had no choice but to employ the golden shield again.
<br><br>
Bang! The golden shield vibrated, but it was still stable.
<br><br>
Lamont didn't show any mercy at all. He stretched out his fists, and even his fist shadows smashed at Yan from all directions! Bang, bang, Bang...
<br><br>
As tens of thousands of punches landed against the golden shield, the shield trembled more violently.
<br><br>
Yan's face became pale, and panic could be seen flashing in her eyes.
<br><br>
Each punch could obliterate her. If the golden shield was broken, she would definitely perish, and even her brother would not be able to survive.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Yan remembered the Divine Crystal Array...
<br><br>
In a panic, she looked at Zen.
<br><br>
It was not difficult for Zen to activate the entire Divine Crystal Array; however, the one who really controlled it was King Ieuan below.
<br><br>
He sat cross-legged on the jadeite platform, with his hands on it. The green luster of the platform quickly gathered in his hands.
<br><br>
The jadeite platform began to slowly rotate. The entire Divine Crystal Array became like a massive hungry beast that began to devour enormous amounts of divine crystals.
<br><br>
Chapter 3915 The Primordial Energy Cat For such a large amount of divine crystals, it would take a long time to extract all the energies in them.
<br><br>
However, it wasn't a big deal for the Snake Goddess. She already had a plan in mind.
<br><br>
As the jadeite platform spun, all the divine crystals would be crushed in a certain direction and then release the internal energy.
<br><br>
The blue energy that gushed out from the divine crystals flowed towards the center like hundreds of small streams. As they gathered in the center of the platform, they formed an azure river of energy.
<br><br>
The produced river of energy was actually very gentle. Even ordinary people wouldn't get hurt if they came into contact with it. It wouldn't be able to kill a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
However, when the river of energy rushed over, three Holy Soul Realm Ear Mice quickly took action.
<br><br>
Three identical Other Shore Tokens appeared above their heads.
<br><br>
Apparently, these tokens were all from Stage Thirty-three. However, because they were of the auxiliary-type, they were not very suitable for combat use.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, the main purpose of the tokens was to compress the river of energy as they interacted with it.
<br><br>
The river of energy was continuously compressed, and once again turned into crystals.
<br><br>
The divine crystals were originally ores that contained a great amount of energy, but now, they were transformed into pure energy crystals.
<br><br>
The energy contained in a piece of the compressed crystal was equivalent to that of seventy million divine crystals.
<br><br>
In the past, the Snake Goddess also tried to condense all of the divine crystals to such an extent, so that it would be much easier to save and store them in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
However, after being fully compressed, the crystals became very unstable and weren't able to maintain the condensed state for a long time.
<br><br>
The river of energy continued to roll and surge, and the energy crystals that were condensed floated in front of King Ieuan.
<br><br>
Above its head was a peculiar-looking Other Shore Token. It was actually a living Other Shore Token, the size of a palm, and looked exactly like a black cat.
<br><br>
It was known as the Primordial Energy Cat, a magical creature that was found in Stage Thirty-three on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
At first glance, it looked like a ferocious black cat, but it was actually an energy entity. Most times, it was in the form of an energy ball. Only when it was hunting would it turn into the form of a black cat.
<br><br>
The Primordial Energy Cat had a very unique and extraordinary feature. For most Other Shore Tokens and Other Shore creatures, they could only devour and consume a limited amount of divine crystals.
<br><br>
Usually, for Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirty-three, they could easily absorb millions to tens of millions of divine crystals, but that would be their limitation. Any amount higher than that would be difficult for them.
<br><br>
However, that was where the exceptional feature of the Primordial Energy Cat differed from the others. It could absorb an unlimited amount of divine crystals. The more crystals it absorbed, the stronger it would become.
<br><br>
When people discovered this insane characteristic, they all pinned their hopes of realizing the Finale Way on it. Even Fuxi had the thought of subduing it before.
<br><br>
Then, later, they found out that the attack method of the Primordial Energy Cat wasn't even strong. A world existed in its stomach, and the divine crystals that it devoured could only be utilized inside it.
<br><br>
Most people, including Fuxi, got so disappointed, but the Snake Goddess had an idea in mind and gave it to King Ieuan as a gift. Together with King Ieuan, she had set up the Divine Crystal Array, which should come in handy in a critical situation.
<br><br>
This time, before the war with the Chaos Ancient Gods, the Snake Goddess had summoned King Ieuan to help control the array.
<br><br>
"Oakley! Dempsey!" King Ieuan called out in a low voice.
<br><br>
The two Ear Mice, who were standing beside it, hurriedly took out their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
The duo was King Ieuan's capable assistants. They were tasked to trap their opponents in the array for as long as they could.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Lamont was still bombarding the golden shield tirelessly.
<br><br>
As he was busy dealing with the golden shield, he suddenly felt the flowing energy within the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Lamont thought that the flowing energy was used to stabilize the golden shield, so he did not pay much attention to it.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! The golden shield shook more and more violently from Lamont's intense strikes.
<br><br>
The disciples and members of the Pear Hill tried to replenish the divine crystals and infuse their energy into the Cloud Cover Array as fast as they could.
<br><br>
However, their speed wasn't enough to keep up with the rate of how the array consumed the divine crystals.
<br><br>
Every time an attack hit the array, Yan's face turned paler.
<br><br>
But as the primary controller of the Cloud Cover Array, she couldn't move from her position.
<br><br>
At such a crucial moment, even if she tried to flee, she would also die.
<br><br>
"King Ieuan!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
He turned to the jadeite platform with anxiety written all over his face.
<br><br>
"I hear you. We are ready!" King Ieuan replied. "Dempsey, Oakley, attack!"
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! A big crack suddenly appeared on the mountain wall not so far from the jadeite platform. Oakley took out its Other Shore Token. It was a small golden piece called the Heaven Shaking Gold, and it was a one-time type of Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
As Oakley threw the gold out, it was quickly set ablaze. At the same time, beams of golden light shrouded the area.
<br><br>
Amazingly, the golden light was not blinding or dazzling. Instead, it was bright but gentle to the naked eye.
<br><br>
The moment the golden light bloomed, an irresistible spiritual storm appeared with it. No matter how powerful a person was, they were instantly affected by it.
<br><br>
When Yan saw the golden light, her mind suddenly went blank and she lost her consciousness.
<br><br>
Likewise, all the other creatures, who were illuminated by the golden light, experienced the same thing.
<br><br>
Even Lamont was no exception. Although his soul was far stronger than any ordinary Eternal Realm warrior's, it was unable to resist the surge of the spiritual storm.
<br><br>
Among all the people present, Zen was the only exception.
<br><br>
As the whole area was being illuminated by the golden light, he clearly felt the fluctuation of his bloodline inside his body. Before he could figure out what was happening, he saw Lamont stop his movement in midair.
<br><br>
During this critical moment, even a few seconds could be fatal for any warrior like Lamont.
<br><br>
Before they engaged in this battle, King Ieuan and its subordinates had prepared and practiced countless times. The moment Lamont briefly stopped, a stone tablet instantly darted and made a clear hit.
<br><br>
After the stone tablet attached to Lamont's body, it quickly emitted black ripples. The other stone tablet, which was on Dempsey's hand, reacted and emitted white ripples.
<br><br>
When Dempsey saw that the black stone tablet had successfully attached itself to Lamont's body, it threw the one it was holding to King Ieuan.
<br><br>
Then, the Primordial Energy Cat on top of King Ieuan's head leaped and swallowed the white stone tablet in one go.
<br><br>
"Now!"
<br><br>
Dempsey didn't waste any time and activated the pair of stone tablets.
<br><br>
The stone tablets were actually called the Interchange Stone Tablets. Their ability was that they could instantly reverse the positions of the things that they were attached to.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Lamont's body, which was just outside the Pear Hill, suddenly disappeared and was brought into the belly of the Primordial Energy Cat.
<br><br>
At the same time, the white stone tablet, which was swallowed by the Primordial Energy Cat, appeared midair outside the Pear Hill, where Lamont's body originally was.
<br><br>
Zen, who was not affected by the Heaven Shaking Gold, was dumbfounded as he witnessed everything that happened. The swapping ability of the stone tablets didn't even produce space fluctuations. This kind of forcible interchange was very domineering.
<br><br>
After swallowing Lamont whole, the Primordial Energy Cat meowed towards King Ieuan and lay on its shoulder.
<br><br>
From the lazy expression of the Primordial Energy Cat, it was as if it just swallowed an insignificant rodent. In the world in its stomach, a whole bunch of terrifying energy was raging.
<br><br>
Chapter 3916 See The Cold Prison Again Lamont didn't expect that the Pear Hill would have prepared so thoroughly.
<br><br>
Without any defense, he was dragged into the belly of the Primordial Energy Cat.
<br><br>
In Pear Hill, Lamont only took the Snake Goddess and Fuxi seriously. The rest were close to nothing in his eyes.
<br><br>
Little did he know that these nobodies didn't rely on Pear Hill to hold on and struggle for life, but tried to find a chance to kill him.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Lamont could not believe his eyes as he saw countless massive energy windstorms that rotated at high speed.
<br><br>
When he felt the terrifying energy, the contempt in his eyes disappeared and was replaced with an expression of uncertainty and caution.
<br><br>
"Where am I? This place exists in the Source World?" There happened to be many dangerous places in the Source World, but most were only considered dangerous for True Gods and the Other Shore Realm warriors.
<br><br>
As for the powerful masters like Lamont, there was no place in the chaos that they couldn't explore, nor was there any place dangerous enough to threaten their lives.
<br><br>
However, today was a different story. This dangerous place was the last thing Lamont had expected.
<br><br>
His initial reaction was to assume that he was merely hallucinating and that everything he saw was an illusion. However, with one simple distinction, he soon understood that this was real, and so was the roaring energy of this horrific place.
<br><br>
Buzz! A strong space fluctuation burst out from the body of Lamont, who wanted nothing else but to leave the world.
<br><br>
However, because the space was formed in the stomach of the Primordial Energy Cat, his theurgies were completely ineffective.
<br><br>
"This is bad!"
<br><br>
As he realized the gravity of his situation, Lamont had already seen a mass of energy windstorm rolling towards him.
<br><br>
In the past, his solid ice armor could withstand Yan's attack, because any energy that came into contact with it would soon be affected by the armor's extremely low temperature.
<br><br>
The stronger the energy was, the higher its temperature would be. This meant that when the temperature dropped, the energy would grow stagnant.
<br><br>
In conclusion, the solid ice armor was also the standing nemesis of the energy windstorm! However, the strength of the energy windstorm was far from what Lamont had expected. In the beginning, the energy windstorms had been blocked by the solid ice armor, but after the energy windstorms swept across the armor, they managed to leave thin lines across the surface.
<br><br>
At first, there were dozens of lines, which later on became a thousand. The number of the lines increased too fast to even observe! When the number of lines on the armor reached hundreds of thousands, the armor shattered onto the ground.
<br><br>
"Condense!"
<br><br>
Ready for anything, Lamont instantly condensed his disintegrated armor.
<br><br>
Within seconds, the once destroyed armor was good as new, and it attached itself onto his body easily.
<br><br>
Then, the first wave of energy windstorms had dissipated, meaning Lamont withstood it head-on.
<br><br>
But then came the second, the third and the fourth waves of energy windstorms that showed no mercy.
<br><br>
Hundreds of thousands of energy windstorms existed in this world. Even at the edge of the world, more energy windstorms were generated from the thick, pure energy.
<br><br>
Lamont gritted his teeth and held on, observing such a ruthless world. At this point, he felt like he was going crazy.
<br><br>
Even the Other Shore Tokens couldn't release such energy, so how did the Pear Hill even make it? Clatter...
<br><br>
The solid ice armor shattered again.
<br><br>
Although Lamont could condense his armor at will, it still consumed much of the power of truth within him.
<br><br>
As Lamont's power of truth decreased each time the solid ice armor was condensed, the armor grew thinner and more vulnerable to the blows of the windstorms.
<br><br>
But for some reason, though the energy windstorms in the belly of the Primordial Energy Cat raged, it appeared quiet and still.
<br><br>
Just then, it curled up on the shoulder of King Ieuan, as if it was sound asleep.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, King Ieuan pressed its index finger on the Primordial Energy Cat's head. By doing so, it could quickly observe what was happening in its belly.
<br><br>
"Your Highness, what's the situation?"
<br><br>
Dempsey asked politely. Because they had put so much effort into their mission, the handful of Ear Mice were naturally concerned. "I don't think he can hold out any longer," said King Ieuan.
<br><br>
Supposedly, the Divine Crystal Array could kill a Chaos Ancient God according to its initial design.
<br><br>
However, King Ieuan was still nervous. After all, Lamont was in control of the truth.
<br><br>
Oakley and Dempsey nodded in approval and waited silently.
<br><br>
At the very top of Pear Hill, Zen and Yan heard the voice of King Ieuan.
<br><br>
The two of them sighed in relief.
<br><br>
Finally, the Chaos Ancient God had been suppressed.
<br><br>
Zen's state of mind happened to be much calmer than King Ieuan's.
<br><br>
Though Zen was much younger than King Ieuan, what he had faced and conquered was far beyond what King Ieuan had encountered.
<br><br>
Over the many chaotic eras, many Sons of Truth had passed away.
<br><br>
Furthermore, in the Abstruse Energy World, the Sons of Truth meant nothing.
<br><br>
However, Zen and Yan paid close attention to the movements ongoing in the Pear Hill. They knew that before the Chaos Ancient God died, everything could change, so they had to be on guard.
<br><br>
After five minutes passed, King Ieuan slightly frowned and looked down.
<br><br>
Just then, the Primordial Energy Cat opened its eyes.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
The Primordial Energy Cat sensed the strangeness that occurred in its inner world.
<br><br>
But just as it was about to intensify the energy in its body, its stomach expanded to more than two hundred feet wide.
<br><br>
The rapid expanse even knocked King Ieuan, Oakley, and Dempsey out of the way.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
Whoosh... Before King Ieuan could regain its balance, the body of the Primordial Energy Cat swelled up and expanded once again to more than three thousand feet! This space created in the Pear Hill was only five thousand feet high, and more than half of that space was occupied by the Primordial Energy Cat.
<br><br>
The expression on the creature remained innocent despite this, and it let out a roaring whine.
<br><br>
"Your Highness!"
<br><br>
"Why?"
<br><br>
Oakley and Dempsey sensed that something was wrong.
<br><br>
King Ieuan also shook its head in disbelief.
<br><br>
Once again, the body of the Primordial Energy Cat swelled up. This time, it rose to fifty thousand feet wide! Boom...
<br><br>
Under the pressure of the expanding body, the cave inside the Pear Hill cracked and fell apart.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Zen, who watched from the jadeite platform, rose into the air and grabbed Yan. "Let's go!"
<br><br>
"But..."
<br><br>
Yan was in charge of the Cloud Cover Array, so she couldn't just leave without consent.
<br><br>
"If you don't leave, you will die!"
<br><br>
Zen's tone was demanding and almost harsh.
<br><br>
Yan hesitated for a moment and then pointed to a peak in the distance.
<br><br>
"Let's head there first!"
<br><br>
It was the Panoramic View Peak, where the second center of the Cloud Cover Array existed. She then brought the golden dress-like array to the Panoramic View Peak so that she could simultaneously control the entire Cloud Cover Array.
<br><br>
In sheer desperation, Zen hastily agreed.
<br><br>
Just as he took his sister away, the body of the Primordial Energy Cat swelled up again. From fifty thousand feet in width, it rose to three million feet.
<br><br>
The Primordial Energy Cat didn't have the Wild God Body, so its physical ability could not withstand the pressure. Eventually, its round belly exploded with a loud bang.
<br><br>
Lamont's massive body finally escaped and he restored himself into a huge monster. The middle of the Pear Hill was completely overturned by him! Moreover, the strange energy radiated from Lamont's body as a peculiar phenomenon appeared.
<br><br>
The stones and trees that surrounded him seemed to have lost their weight as they hovered around him.
<br><br>
After a moment, these stones and trees morphed into countless white dots of light that flashed dramatically and disappeared.
<br><br>
Yan blinked her eyes as she saw this, surprised with what just happened.
<br><br>
Zen was familiar with this as he had seen something similar in the Blooming Jade Stage. It was the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
With this Cold Prison to protect Lamont, no matter how powerful the energy was, it proved to be no threat to him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3917 Just So-so When any kind of material was trapped or came into contact with the Cold Prison, it would be instantly converted into a different form, and energy was no exception.
<br><br>
No matter how strong the energy in the Primordial Energy Cat's stomach was, it was rendered useless in the face of the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
This turn of events was something that the Snake Goddess and King Ieuan never expected.
<br><br>
They didn't know the existence of the Cold Prison, nor did they see Lamont use such an ability before.
<br><br>
If it was Othniel or Herbert, they were sure that the two would have perished in the Primordial Energy Cat's stomach. Unfortunately, they had to deal with Lamont right now.
<br><br>
Lamont looked down at a crushed stone in the Pear Hill. "King Ieuan, I'm disappointed at you. After colluding with the Pear Hill, this is all you can do?"
<br><br>
King Ieuan stood on the stone and looked up at Lamont with a gloomy gaze.
<br><br>
In the past, it once boasted as the richest creature in the Source World.
<br><br>
However, the massive amount of divine crystals that it had didn't bring any qualitative changes to its race. So, King Ieuan decided to make use of the divine crystals.
<br><br>
With the help of the Snake Goddess and Fuxi, the Divine Crystal Array was flawlessly established. Everything went smoothly—or so they thought.
<br><br>
Then came Lamont. In an instant, the tide of the battle suddenly went against their favor.
<br><br>
All the terrifying energy that swarmed at Lamont turned into mere dots of light that vanished immediately after. Witnessing all that, King Ieuan couldn't begin to imagine how powerful Lamont really was.
<br><br>
"Lucky for me, I have grasped the skill of creating the Cold Prison. If not, I might have died in your cat's stomach. But unfortunately for you…"
<br><br>
As he was still speaking, Lamont stretched out a finger and aimed at King Ieuan below. A white aura began circling on his fingertip. An extreme murderous intent was oozing in his eyes.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A blast of cold air was condensed into a white arrow. It quickly darted off from Lamont's finger and dashed towards King Ieuan.
<br><br>
King Ieuan just stared at the approaching arrow, as if fear and helplessness crippled its entire body.
<br><br>
"My king, get a hold of yourself!"
<br><br>
"You need to run!"
<br><br>
Oakley, Dempsey, and the three other Ear Mice rushed over to King Ieuan as fast as they could.
<br><br>
The five Ear Mice were King Ieuan's most trusted subordinates. Even in the most hopeless situation, their loyalty and passion to protect their king remained undaunted.
<br><br>
"Divine Picture Shield!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, a round purple shield appeared above Oakley's head.
<br><br>
Aside from the Heaven Shaking Gold, the Divine Picture Shield was its most powerful Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
It was a defense-type Other Shore Token from Stage Thirty-three. The power of any kind of attack that came in contact with it would automatically be reduced to one-third of its original strength.
<br><br>
With this, even if Lamont was a high-level Eternal Realm master, Oakley was confident that it would withstand his attack.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Oakley's eyes widened as it saw that the white arrow pierced through the Divine Picture Shield. It didn't stop for one bit, and it drilled into Oakley's chest. Immediately after, Oakley became frozen like an ice sculpture.
<br><br>
Seeing what happened, Dempsey, who was behind Oakley, immediately threw an Interchange Stone Tablet towards the white arrow. The moment it latched onto the arrow, Dempsey activated the stone tablets.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the white arrow disappeared and re-appeared in another direction where it pierced into another huge piece of rock.
<br><br>
The rock that came into contact with the arrow became brittle and instantly shattered into a pile of ice dregs.
<br><br>
King Ieuan came back to its senses and was astonished at Oakley's sudden death. Its face was quickly filled with grief and anger. It abruptly took out two Other Shore Tokens, which were a pair of sharp and shiny knives.
<br><br>
The light reflecting on the knives left countless deep cuts on the surface of the surrounding rubbles.
<br><br>
King Ieuan knew that in one way or another, it was going to be killed by Lamont. So, it chose to fight until death rather than try to escape like a pathetic king.
<br><br>
"Tch. Do you think your bravery will gain you anything? You useless rodent!"
<br><br>
Lamont had no intention of taking King Ieuan seriously. So, he raised his hand and decided to kill the latter in a swift manner.
<br><br>
Just then, several golden light blades came rushing from a distance and rained on Lamont.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Crash! The moment the light blades fell into the Cold Prison, they instantly turned into countless dots of light that eventually vanished.
<br><br>
Standing on the Panoramic View Peak, Yan glared at Lamont with tremendous hostility.
<br><br>
Zen knew the secret of the Cold Prison, and he also knew that at the current level of the Energy Shaft, it would be useless and too weak to break the Cold Prison, let alone damage Lamont.
<br><br>
However, he didn't expect that Yan would suddenly make a move, so he had no time to stop her.
<br><br>
Lamont was initially focused on dealing with King Ieuan, but after Yan's sudden attack, she successfully attracted his attention.
<br><br>
"Human girl, I'd like to commend you for your courage."
<br><br>
Lamont turned towards Yan with a huge ugly smile on his gorilla-like face.
<br><br>
Immediately after, his huge body rushed towards her.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Yan quickly unleashed the golden shield again.
<br><br>
With the efforts of the Ear Mice, the energy of the Cloud Cover Array was replenished to such an extent that the golden shield was quite solid.
<br><br>
Then, Lamont stretched out a finger. In an instant, the shield turned into dots of light and immediately dissipated.
<br><br>
Lamont let out a horrifying laugh. He quickly clenched his fist and attempted to throw a massive punch directed at Yan.
<br><br>
As his fist was approaching her, the Cold Prison touched Yan and dispersed her energy.
<br><br>
She didn't disappear but was transformed into a form under the extremely low temperature. It was actually very similar to the form outside of the chaos.
<br><br>
"B-brother…"
<br><br>
As her consciousness was slowly fading, her instinct made her call for Zen.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen's body expanded as he activated his Wild God Body.
<br><br>
The truth was he didn't want to fight any Chaos Ancient God right now.
<br><br>
Before he had mastered the ancestry-level bloodline, his strength was just comparable to that of an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior.
<br><br>
However, he didn't have much choice right now. In the face of the overwhelming odds, he had to bite the bullet.
<br><br>
In addition to unleashing his own strength, he could only bet on the power of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"I hope you can be smart enough to know what you are doing!"
<br><br>
In a flash, Zen's body expanded to a height of more than four million feet, like a huge mountain, protecting Yan at all costs.
<br><br>
Lamont was over ten million feet tall, so Zen was just half of his size.
<br><br>
As Lamont threw the punch towards Yan, he clearly saw how Zen turned into a giant. A smile crossed his ferocious face and his expression became more intense.
<br><br>
'Come to think of it, is this the guy that Herbert mentioned? They said that they will be capturing him alive.
<br><br>
Ha-ha, they can't blame me. He's the one who walks into his death, ' Lamont thought.
<br><br>
Even Lamont couldn't fully control the Cold Prison. Anything that came in contact with it would be ripped off its energy, and Lamont couldn't restore them either. Trying to protect Yan, Zen rushed into the Cold Prison and approached Lamont's fist by throwing his own massive punch. Lamont couldn't help laughing in his mind because he knew that Zen already fell into the trap, and he would surely end up like the others who became victims of the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
However, Lamont's expression suddenly changed and his eyes widened.
<br><br>
Crash! With a muffled sound, Zen's fist collided with Lamont's. Zen wasn't stopped by the Cold Prison and his energy didn't dissipate either.
<br><br>
Due to the overwhelming force that Zen had put in his fist, Lamont was pushed back and had to take several steps backward.
<br><br>
Lamont's force was undoubtedly more powerful than Zen's. However, he didn't use his full strength just now because he didn't expect that it would be necessary.
<br><br>
As Lamont regained his balance, he stared at Zen with a visibly disorganized expression on his face. He was trying to understand what had just happened. He was thinking if Zen used a certain secret skill that he missed to notice.
<br><br>
"This can't be… You! What the hell did you do?"
<br><br>
Lamont knew very well how the Cold Prison worked, so he was flabbergasted at what just happened.
<br><br>
"What? You're wondering why the Cold Prison didn't work on me?" Zen looked at his slightly stiff fist and brushed off the frost on its surface. "Well, your Cold Prison is only so-so."
<br><br>
Chapter 3918 Strengthen The Cold Prisons in the Blooming Jade Stage were forbidden lands for any creature, and even Zen didn't dare to enter.
<br><br>
Only those who were as supernormal as Pompeo could stay in a Cold Prison.
<br><br>
The Cold Prison had an extremely low temperature. What made it more terrible was that the creatures of the chaos seemed to slowly turn into light dots and then vanish into thin air inside it.
<br><br>
Yet for the creatures of the Abstruse Energy World, the Cold Prison was not so dreadful. Even some relatively weak creatures of the Abstruse Energy World would only be temporarily frozen when they fell into it. Once they left the Cold Prison, they would recover from frozen state, and again return to being energized and vigorous.
<br><br>
Zen had decided to take action because he was worried about Yan.
<br><br>
Although the ancestry-level bloodline could defeat all the energy, the Cold Prison was very special. It could be possible that Zen himself might be destroyed in it.
<br><br>
The moment he came into contact with the Cold Prison, the temperature began to rise unexpectedly. Zen felt it was easily breakable.
<br><br>
"You know this is the Cold Prison? And you are able to break it?" Lamont finally uttered, after a moment of silence.
<br><br>
"There are many Cold Prisons in the Blooming Jade Stage." Zen smiled. As to whether he could break it or not, he didn't need to answer.
<br><br>
Lamont carefully looked at Zen. He had been thinking about whether he should kill him earlier. "It seems that I thought too much. I'm afraid it will take me a lot of energy to defeat you!"
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Lamont tilted his huge body and pounced towards Zen.
<br><br>
He was an old monster that had lived for countless years. His eyes were extremely sharp and he possessed great knowledge.
<br><br>
Indeed, Zen had an incredible method to break the Cold Prison. Even Lamont was convinced that he was capable.
<br><br>
However, he also sensed that Zen's strength was not enough. Lamont's physical body was an advantage; it was no doubt that he could overthrow Zen! When Lamont went to face Zen, a red light flashed from Yan's eyes. Golden light blades appeared, moving in cutting motions towards his head.
<br><br>
Lamont, having suffered from a loss once, drew a huge ice cover enclosing Yan's head. He then grabbed Zen in midair, and ruthlessly smashed him towards the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Zen's more than four million-foot-tall body crashed into a mountain. The impact embedded his body onto the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The originally solid and huge mountain crumbled, almost becoming as soft as mud; it was unable to bear the damage of two giant creatures.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A ray of white light flashed from Lamont's hand. A long and thin ice spike started to form and stabbed towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Zen had no time to dodge and instead reached out his hand to grab the ice spike.
<br><br>
As the ancestry-level bloodline started a surge within Zen's body, the ice spike appeared to have been roasted and instantly melted into a pool of water.
<br><br>
Lamont was stunned again. He frowned as he refused to use the power of truth any longer. He simply drew his fist back and powerfully punched Zen! Boom! Boom! Boom! The sudden vibration reverberated throughout the whole Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The scene wasn't new for many people in the Pear Hill; but the mountain leaders, the sect leaders, the disciples, and the members of the race were unable to participate in such a level of battle. On the other hand, they needed to provide Yan with a steady flow of energy.
<br><br>
Crack! Yan had finally smashed the ice cover on her head into little pieces. She looked for her brother, but when she saw him, her eyes turned red. He was being pressed and attacked on the ground! Buzz...
<br><br>
The Energy Shaft began to shake violently.
<br><br>
The energy gained through the Cloud Cover Array had been released by Yan.
<br><br>
With the help of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, the energy that the Energy Shaft could transform had greatly increased, but there was still a limit.
<br><br>
The energy released by Yan exceeded this limit! Clatter, clatter, clatter...
<br><br>
The huge golden blades spiraled at high speed and flew to hit Lamont.
<br><br>
Overpowered by the golden blades, he immediately employed the Cold Prison again.
<br><br>
The Cold Prison didn't have any effect on Zen, but it could entirely restrain Yan's energy attack.
<br><br>
Without sound, light or vibration, the several huge golden light blades entered the Cold Prison and turned into tens of millions of white light dots before dissipating.
<br><br>
Yan's chest heaved up and down while her face flushed into a strange red.
<br><br>
This kind of energy overuse did great damage to her. Shortly, she became unable to use the Energy Shaft. She could only watch in agony as Lamont kept beating up Zen's body.
<br><br>
Previously, during Zen's communication with the ancestry-level bloodline, the ancestry-level bloodline had massively strengthened him.
<br><br>
However, this strengthening was limited, and was unable to block Lamont's attack.
<br><br>
After the Chaotic Source Spirits fell into fatigue, wounds and injuries began to cover Zen's body. Besides his control of the temperature, Lamont's physical quality also made him become outstanding among the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
At this time, Zen could resist if he used a Civilization Artifact's Inheritance of World. He remembered that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had given him the suggestion.
<br><br>
But this suggestion was rejected by Zen. Even if he activated the Inheritance of World, he might still not be a match for Lamont. After all, Lamont was skilled in dealing with the attacks of energy.
<br><br>
He wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to continue convening the ancestry-level bloodline to come to his aid.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Lamont attacked like a huge gorilla, his thick hands punching on Zen's body. Zen's chest bones cracked as they were broken into pieces.
<br><br>
While Lamont was still launching his constant attacks, a slight confusion struck him.
<br><br>
He felt that although Zen's strength was very weak, he wasn't likely to have given up struggling.
<br><br>
He looked at Zen closely and wondered why under his body, Zen seemed to have stopped resisting.
<br><br>
'What's going on?' Before Lamont could figure it out, something more strange happened. Zen began talking to himself.
<br><br>
"Aren't you afraid of being in another person's hands? If I lose, your situation will become worse! I don't think they will let you go. You're wasting your only chance!"
<br><br>
According to the information from the brush-wielder and the four statues, Zen was the only one who had fused with the complete ancestry-level bloodline and was able to take it away. No one had ever done that before.
<br><br>
Zen's communication with the ancestry-level bloodline distracted Lamont.
<br><br>
Although he didn't stop punching, the agitation in his eyes was evident. It grew stronger and stronger as Zen continued to talk.
<br><br>
Who was he trying to persuade? Was he trying to convince someone who could finish Lamont? Zen's chest suddenly cracked...
<br><br>
Surprisingly, no blood flowed as his broken ribs were exposed, extending to both sides.
<br><br>
The texture of the broken ribs quickly changed and the ribs like two rows of blades directed towards Lamont.
<br><br>
The abrupt transformation broke off Lamont's attack. He felt an instinctive threat.
<br><br>
If he didn't kill this brat, something unexpected would happen! "Go to hell!" he shouted.
<br><br>
He used up all his strength and smashed towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes, mouth, and nose sank, revealing a horrifying appearance. His face was deformed.
<br><br>
As Lamont hit hard, his fist sunk deep into Zen's head with a sunken face.
<br><br>
Out of instinct, Lamont tried to pull his fist back, but he failed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3919 Helpless Zen's head remained latched onto Lamont's hand as if he was biting into it.
<br><br>
Then, Lamont raised his arm and lifted Zen's body with it.
<br><br>
"Let go of me, you bastard!"
<br><br>
Lamont swiftly swung his arm sideways in an attempt to throw Zen into the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
However, Zen remained firmly latched onto his hand. Even though Lamont was knowledgeable and powerful, a strong sensation of anxiety and vexation was creeping beneath his skin.
<br><br>
Since Zen wouldn't let go, Lamont raised him high in the sky and smashed him down to the mountain.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, Lamont didn't feel that Zen was loosening his grip, so he smashed him again and again.
<br><br>
In just a few seconds, several craters appeared on the top area of Pear Hill where Lamont repeatedly smashed Zen's body.
<br><br>
However, even though Lamont felt that he almost used up all his strength, his hand was still unable to get rid of Zen.
<br><br>
Yan grew worried and speechless as she saw her brother being beaten so furiously.
<br><br>
Zen seemed to withstand all of Lamont's attacks, but it wouldn't be good for him to be continuously beaten like this.
<br><br>
Crash! Crash! Crash! As Zen was still being rammed into the Pear Hill, a huge stone about ten feet wide flew towards the side and almost hit King Ieuan, who had just climbed out of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Crack! Before the huge chunk of stone hit King Ieuan, its tail whipped the stone at high speed, splitting it into two halves.
<br><br>
The other Ear Mice also followed King Ieuan and had a clear view of the brutal battle between Lamont and Zen. However, as they watched intently, there was a strange sensation that they couldn't shake off.
<br><br>
Zen was a dear friend of the Ear Mouse race. All of the members present, including King Ieuan, knew all of the miraculous things that he did in the past.
<br><br>
They never even thought that Zen could already fight the Chaos Ancient God after he got out of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"I don't understand what's happening. Zen's current state is pretty strange.
<br><br>
He seems to be seriously injured now, but he can still latch onto Lamont,"
<br><br>
an Ear Mouse told its observation.
<br><br>
King Ieuan nodded at the Ear Mouse's statement and stared at Zen with its soybean-sized eyes. "His body has indeed become very strange. I don't think he is injured. It's as if his body voluntarily became like this..."
<br><br>
"Does that mean that his bloodline affects his physical body this way?" one of the Ear Mice blurted as it was lost in thought. Actually, it was not that unusual for an Eternal Realm warrior to obtain some kind of bloodline that could alter their physical body.
<br><br>
However, King Ieuan explained further, "That's not exactly the point. Did you notice that for a while now, Lamont hasn't used his bloodline power? That's the most exceptional thing so far! Zen might've done something that we couldn't comprehend."
<br><br>
The greatest reliance of Chaos Ancient Gods was their bloodline power, which was known as the truth-level theurgy. This was their basic foundation.
<br><br>
However, when the power of truth became ineffective, they could only rely on their sturdy physical body.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! After launching several consecutive attacks, Lamont finally had enough of it. He grabbed the air with his other hand and summoned a huge ice blade that was formed by thick white mists.
<br><br>
At the back of Lamont's mind, he thought that since Zen had degenerated into this pitiful form, it would be impossible for him to resist his power of truth again.
<br><br>
As the ice blade slashed towards Zen, Zen's strange body didn't react to it and just continued latching himself on Lamont's hand.
<br><br>
However, just as the ice blade was about to touch Zen, one of his hands quickly responded.
<br><br>
It seemed to have an extreme ability of perception, like having an eye of its own. His hand accurately held off the sharp edge of the blade and the blade didn't even cut him.
<br><br>
Immediately after, the sharp ice blade melted completely.
<br><br>
Then, his hand quickly went back.
<br><br>
Lamont felt like he was going insane.
<br><br>
He couldn't get rid of Zen or smash him to death. Moreover, his theurgy was being completely suppressed. There was nothing left that he could do to beat him.
<br><br>
The current situation was something new to Lamont and that was why he was very frustrated.
<br><br>
Lamont never had the intention to take Zen seriously before, but now, he couldn't believe that he would become so troublesome.
<br><br>
"What the hell is wrong with you? Why can't you die?"
<br><br>
Lamont was so exasperated now. He wanted to finish this useless battle as soon as possible, so he began dragging Zen to a mountain nearby.
<br><br>
The peak was like a sharp sword that was soaring into the sky. It turned out to be the Sword Blade Peak, which was apparently guarded by the mountain leader, Dwight Xu.
<br><br>
While on the mountain, Dwight Xu was also silently observing the vicious battle between Zen and Lamont. Upon seeing that the two were headed towards the mountain, he immediately gave an order to all the disciples stationed there.
<br><br>
"All disciples must retreat from the Sword Blade Peak at once!"
<br><br>
There were several mountains around the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
In previous battles, the disciples in the mountains naturally felt their power.
<br><br>
However, even if they tried their best to release their energy, the strong feeling of fear was still there.
<br><br>
After all, it was a Chaos Ancient God that Zen was dealing with. If they were slightly affected, it might cost them their lives.
<br><br>
Therefore, as soon as Dwight Xu gave the order to retreat, all the disciples hurriedly used the Grand Teleportation technique and dispersed in all directions.
<br><br>
Just a moment ago, there were tens of thousands of people on the Sword Blade Peak, but now, it was completely empty.
<br><br>
Lamont dashed in front of the Sword Blade Peak and stopped there. Then, he stretched his hand to pat the peak.
<br><br>
Gradually, as Lamont continued to put his palm on the peak, the Sword Blade Peak became frozen solid and almost impregnable.
<br><br>
Even Fuxi and the Snake Goddess would have a hard time destroying it.
<br><br>
After freezing the peak, Lamont dragged Zen and made a giant leap into the sky.
<br><br>
Upon seeing his course of action, King Ieuan, Yan, Dwight Xu, and the others immediately understood what he was trying to do.
<br><br>
Lamont brought Zen up in the sky and wanted to impale him straight into the Sword Blade Peak.
<br><br>
Right now, this was the best idea that Lamont had thought. He didn't have any other good way to kill Zen on his current state.
<br><br>
Zen might not be able to eliminate Lamont's power of truth, if his physical body fell down at high speed. He would be defeated once his body was successfully impaled through the Sword Blade Peak.
<br><br>
However, just as Lamont aggressively dragged Zen up in the sky, one of Zen's arms suddenly stretched downward and extended as if it had lost all of its bones. It patted the Sword Blade Peak and injected a stream of green energy into it.
<br><br>
Sizzle! The Sword Blade Peak, which was frozen solid just seconds ago, instantly melted. Not only that, the surface of the mountain blossomed into what seemed to be a fairyland, full of various plants all around.
<br><br>
Lamont's jaw dropped while he was still in midair. Obviously, he was shocked at what just happened.
<br><br>
Even the others who saw the scene were utterly surprised.
<br><br>
"Zen, what is this?"
<br><br>
Yan couldn't believe her eyes. "Is this even a battle?"
<br><br>
Zen, a superior human being, and Lamont, a powerful Chaos Ancient God, were two of the most powerful beings in the entire chaos because of their abilities and strength.
<br><br>
But right now, the battle between these two mighty beings was not making any sense.
<br><br>
Lamont stayed in midair for a few more seconds, and then decided to go back down at the Sword Blade Peak. He patted the peak again and infused the power of truth into it.
<br><br>
After quite some time, Lamont noticed that the Sword Blade Peak wasn't freezing.
<br><br>
As he lowered his head, Lamont saw Zen's slender and boneless hand was also touching the mountain, countering the effect of his power of truth.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! What the hell!"
<br><br>
In the distance, Dwight Xu couldn't help but burst out laughing.
<br><br>
King Ieuan and the other Ear Mice on the other side of Pear Hill also laughed out loud.
<br><br>
Even Yan temporarily forgot that her brother was in danger. She just couldn't believe that a vicious battle would turn into a comedy show.
<br><br>
"You bastard!"
<br><br>
Lamont felt that he was going crazy. His angry roar echoed throughout the entire Pear Hill.
<br><br>

<br><br>
An invisible yet tangible chill spread out.
<br><br>
Although Yan tried to block the chill with the help of the Cloud Cover Array, it was much colder than before.
<br><br>
The people on the edge of the Pear Hill were alright, but the disciples in the middle of the hill started to shiver from the cold. Many of them started releasing flames to prevent themselves from getting frostbite.
<br><br>
Three blue spheres began to appear in the sky, one by one. They almost looked like blue suns, but the light they emitted was not warm at all.
<br><br>
Everyone felt as though they had fallen into a cold hell.
<br><br>
With the appearance of the three blue suns, the temperature in the Pear Hill dropped sharply.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Raising his hand above his head, Lamont lifted Zen up as though he were some sort of a sacrificial offering.
<br><br>
"Go to hell! Three Freezing Suns!"
<br><br>
This had been Lamont's most powerful theurgy before he figured out how to create the Cold Prison from the truth power.
<br><br>
The three blue suns flashed an icy blue, and azure arrows made of ice started raining from them, shooting straight towards Zen.
<br><br>
Lamont thought that Zen had some kind of bloodline that could withstand, or even restrain, the coldness. Zen didn't seem to flinch in the face of the coldness, so Lamont was quite frustrated to have him as an opponent.
<br><br>
However, Lamont believed there was a limit to Zen's bloodline power.
<br><br>
With his truth power as a Chaos Ancient God, Lamont was confident in his own strength.
<br><br>
Now that all his bloodline had been activated, he was determined to defeat Zen.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! Countless thick ice arrows shot down towards Zen. Anyone else would have been pierced to shreds in just a few seconds.
<br><br>
However, there seemed to be an invisible energy film on the surface of Zen's body. The ice arrows that touched this energy film bounced off him, leaving him unharmed.
<br><br>
Lamont had already anticipated this, but he believed that the bloodline power within Zen's body would be used up sooner or later. With the Three Freezing Suns, Zen would be exhausted to death.
<br><br>
However, what Lamont did not know was that Gerald and Judson had already tried this method. The two Chaos Ancient Gods had worked together to try to exhaust Zen's ancestry-level bloodline, but they ended up failing. Little did Lamont know that he too was doomed to fail.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! Countless huge ice arrows continued to shoot at Zen, and the ice debris falling from the sky froze some areas of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Even a thumb-sized piece of ice was extremely lethal.
<br><br>
The creatures on the Pear Hill kept moving so as to avoid the collateral damage caused by the battle between Lamont and Zen.
<br><br>
Since Lamont was so focused on dealing with Zen, Yan and the others were left idle. The leaders of the mountains and the sects quietly yet anxiously watched the battle in the sky.
<br><br>
The battle between Zen and Lamont was going to determine the fate of the Pear Hill, so naturally, they were quite anxious.
<br><br>
"Zen is doomed to die under such heavy bombardments!"
<br><br>
"He doesn't have the ability to fight back at all."
<br><br>
"Alas, it's impossible for him to defeat a Chaos Ancient God."
<br><br>
Many people fretted as they watched the powerful ice arrows rain on Zen.
<br><br>
Just a single piece of ice debris that was spattered out could kill a warrior at the Holy Soul Realm. How could Zen survive from so many ice arrows? The ice arrows kept attacking Zen.
<br><br>
Five minutes...
<br><br>
Ten minutes...
<br><br>
Fifteen minutes...
<br><br>
The crowd held their breath as they continued to watch the ice explode in front of Lamont, who held Zen in front of him. From the ground, they couldn't see what exactly was happening in the skies.
<br><br>
With each minute that passed, their confusion grew.
<br><br>
There had been countless ice arrows.
<br><br>
If it were any Eternal Realm warrior, or even Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, they would have been smashed to pieces by now. But why was Lamont still attacking? More than an hour had passed.
<br><br>
The scattered ice dregs left several mountains white with snow.
<br><br>
The three blue suns in the sky gradually dimmed, and the ice arrows that fell down became weaker and weaker.
<br><br>
"Lamont's bloodline power is starting to weaken," said King Ieuan, its brows furrowing.
<br><br>
Zen had managed to exhaust the bloodline power of a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
Just how powerful was he? Splash! Splash! Splash! Less and less arrows were shot out of the three suns, and it seemed they had slowed down, too.
<br><br>
Zen finally emerged from the explosions of ice, unharmed. The crowd let out a sigh of relief, and started cheering.
<br><br>
Lamont looked at Zen in front of him, his eyes wide with fear.
<br><br>
Stunned, he finally realized he had used up all his bloodline power, and yet, Zen still remained here unscathed. Did this mean Zen would cling to him for the rest of eternity? Lamont never thought that he was only half right. After Zen felt that his bloodline power began to weaken, his face spread towards his arm again.
<br><br>
Zen's head turned into a ring and passed through Lamont's arm, leaning on his shoulder.
<br><br>
Lamont was no stranger to danger, but he was still terrified in this moment.
<br><br>
Just as Lamont attempted to pry the ring off, he shrieked in pain. Zen's ribs were like sharp blades, tearing through his body.
<br><br>
"Fuck off!"
<br><br>
Lamont wanted to push Zen away with brute force. In terms of pure strength, without a doubt, Lamont was much stronger.
<br><br>
However, before he could even try pushing Zen off, Lamont felt another sharp pain in his back. Craning his neck to see what had happened, Lamont nearly fainted at the sight.
<br><br>
The ribs that had pierced through his body had grown barbs that were several thousand feet long. These barbs firmly locked his body with Zen's.
<br><br>
"Monster...
<br><br>
An incredible monster...
<br><br>
I..."
<br><br>
Lamont was finally too frightened to even speak fluently. He had never felt so scared in his life! His mind was whirling. Not knowing what to do, Lamont began to struggle desperately.
<br><br>
But the more he tried, the deeper the barbs sank into his skin.
<br><br>
No matter what Lamont tried, he couldn't get rid of the barbs.
<br><br>
He felt as if he was the prey of a spider web, and was slowly devoured by the monster in front of him. Exhausted, his body gradually paralyzed and finally sank into darkness.
<br><br>
Even Yan and King Ieuan couldn't help but show a trace of panic when they saw what Zen did.
<br><br>
Was this truly the man they knew as Zen? Or was this some kind of monster? At the top of the Pear Hill, Zen lay on the side of a mountain.
<br><br>
He had been conscious this whole time, but he had completely lost control of his body.
<br><br>
After he swallowed Lamont, his body changed again.
<br><br>
The wound on his chest gradually healed. A huge armor began to spread out from his chest, and many white hairs grew on his back.
<br><br>
His arms became longer and stronger, resembling those of a gorilla.
<br><br>
'Am I assimilated after I swallowed Lamont? Or did the ancestry-level bloodline do it on purpose?' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
With what had happened just now, his bodily transformations didn't surprise him anymore.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline could completely change the shape of one's body. Even if part of his body had been assimilated after he devoured Lamont, the ancestry-level bloodline should've been able to quickly repair it. However, it was possible there were other underlying reasons as to why his body took on some of Lamont's physical characteristics.
<br><br>
Chapter 3921 Reinforcements Yan floated over slowly and then gazed at the huge body in a vigilant manner.
<br><br>
To be honest, it was a bit difficult for her to link this huge monster with her brother. It just didn't seem possible.
<br><br>
However, she had personally witnessed the entire fierce battle herself.
<br><br>
There was no doubt about it. This was undoubtedly Zen.
<br><br>
"Brother..."
<br><br>
Yan called out.
<br><br>
Hearing her voice, Zen raised his head slowly.
<br><br>
When she saw Zen's face, Yan took a deep breath and involuntarily retreated a few steps back.
<br><br>
Rigid, round muscles had swollen to bulges around Zen's face. These special muscles were as tough and indestructible as powerful and refined magical treasures.
<br><br>
His eyes, nose and mouth were almost completely invisible due to those muscles. The sunken structure could now protect his eyes, ears, mouth and nose as much as possible.
<br><br>
However, it was extremely horrible to watch. He looked uglier than a fiend.
<br><br>
Forcing the disgust she was feeling deep inside her, Yan called out once again, "Brother, is that you?"
<br><br>
Zen smiled and reached out his hand to her as if to say 'I am here, sis!' This gesture finally relieved Yan. She took Zen's palm and pouted softly, "Brother, why have you become like this?"
<br><br>
"I am sorry. This is something that I can't control," Zen replied, shaking his head.
<br><br>
After he had changed his form, his voice had also changed a lot.
<br><br>
His voice didn't seem to be coming from his throat anymore. Instead, it was a chesty growl. It was not only hoarse but also quite harsh.
<br><br>
"His looks don't matter. What we witnessed is that he killed a Chaos Ancient God by himself!" King Ieuan floated to Yan's side. Its bean-sized eyes were full of appraisal for the half-man, half-beast in front of it. "This body may be ugly in your eyes, but it is remarkably strong. It is made for battle!"
<br><br>
Zen had killed a Chaos Ancient God by himself.
<br><br>
He was the first warrior to ever manage that feat in the entire Source World.
<br><br>
Moreover, he had killed Lamont by devouring him, which meant that the killing process had actually made Zen stronger.
<br><br>
This man had really lived up to everyone's expectations.
<br><br>
"Made for battle? Come on. It's too ugly. It doesn't even look human!" Yan said as she sniffed. She wanted the best for her brother.
<br><br>
Looking at his sister's reluctant expression, Zen smiled and tried to comfort her, "It's okay! I might be able to change back after I dissipate the Wild God Power out of my system."
<br><br>
Then his body began to shrink rapidly.
<br><br>
When it reached about ten feet in height, the shrinking stopped, and Zen's appearance didn't come back either.
<br><br>
As he looked at his fluffy hands and his body the size of a gorilla, his face became a little pale, as if he were afraid.
<br><br>
In the past, whenever he cultivated other strange theurgies, his physical body had also changed, but those changes were controllable, and he had never looked so ugly. If he really couldn't change back, it would be troublesome.
<br><br>
The problem most likely lay in the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to communicate with the ancestry-level bloodline, a rumble came from the distance.
<br><br>
Looking in the distance, he saw that the noise had been caused by a crack on the ground.
<br><br>
After that, Zen, Yan, King Ieuan and the others saw a giant crack appearing in the distance and spreading towards the edge of the Pear Hill. It didn't stop until it had touched the boundary wall.
<br><br>
After seeing what was happening in the distance, which was crystal clear due to its magnitude, King Ieuan took a deep breath and said, "They have ruined the Taoism Province."
<br><br>
The Taoism Province was the farthest place that could be seen from the Pear Hill. It was normal for dozens of provinces to be ruined when several Chaos Ancient Gods fought. It was impossible to imagine just how much havoc they wreaked everywhere they went.
<br><br>
"I wonder how the Snake Goddess is doing," Yan muttered. She was still worried about the safety of the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. They have their real selves with them, so they should be fine," Zen comforted her. He was right.
<br><br>
The strength of the real Fuxi and the real Snake Goddess was high enough to easily fight against a Chaos Ancient God. Coupled with the strength of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, as well as Gerald and Judson on their side, they were surely at a good advantage, if not a great one.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Before anyone could say something, a second crack appeared, and the entire Taoism Province directly disappeared in a pile of dust.
<br><br>
Faced with such a fierce battle, Zen finally couldn't sit still anymore.
<br><br>
If the people of Pear Hill and the Chaos Ancient Gods on their side were really defeated, then they would lose Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The magical ability that the ancestry-level bloodline had just displayed had allowed Zen to devour Lamont. He could feel Lamont struggling inside his body, but as the ancestry-level bloodline continued to change form, it finally managed to digest Lamont and assimilate his powers for Zen's use.
<br><br>
It looked like the ancestry-level bloodline would never let him fall into the hands of the Element Spirit Civilization. This meant that he could easily use the ancestry-level bloodline to his advantage.
<br><br>
"I'll go and have a look. Yan, you protect Pear Hill along with King Ieuan."
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen floated in the air and disappeared, leaving a burst of shadows behind him like a rocket trail.
<br><br>
Two huge cracks had appeared right in the heart of the Taoism Province, like the two jaws of a monster trying to devour the province.
<br><br>
Giant brown chaotic clouds were floating quietly under those cracks.
<br><br>
Suddenly, they began to surge, and a golden sword light rushed out, which stirred the heaven and earth.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Splash! The sword light extended around for tens of millions of feet and stabbed towards one side of the chaotic clouds.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! It seemed like the golden sword light collided with something solid inside those clouds, and the crisp sound it caused could be heard across tens of millions of miles. Any creature that was too close to the clouds would have been shattered by the intense sound wave! Whoosh! However, unable to break that solid object with several consecutive strikes, the attacker rapidly retreated.
<br><br>
After something rushed out of the chaotic clouds, everyone finally saw who the attacker was. He was Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and he had activated the Wild God Body and was now more than six million feet in height! "Oh you want to escape? It's too late for that!"
<br><br>
Just as Eastern Emperor Taiyi was about to retreat, he bumped into an invisible wall. With a groan, he rolled over and tried to cross the wall from the other side. However, both sides of the wall were sealed by an invisible force field, and he was trapped! The next moment, Othniel appeared outside the wall. His single eye, gigantic in size, was filled with a trace of anger and depression.
<br><br>
The strength that the Pear Hill had displayed in this fight was far beyond his expectations. Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had already made several powerful strikes. Gerald and Judson were also on the opponents' team.
<br><br>
If it weren't for the Grandmaster of Heaven, Othniel and Herbert would have already been defeated and the battle would have been over.
<br><br>
While the Grandmaster of Heaven was busy fighting Gerald and Judson, Othniel had managed to find a chance to trap Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't seem too worried by the fact that he had been trapped.
<br><br>
Buzz! A strong bloodline power darted out of his body, and a golden sword light surged, spreading across the entire visible space.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! The sword light bounced back and forth, like laser beams between mirrors in the space that had trapped Eastern Emperor Taiyi. However, the space seemed remarkably stable. It could not be destroyed so easily.
<br><br>
"It's useless to struggle. Our bloodlines determine the difference in our strength," Othniel sneered.
<br><br>
With a flash of blue light that rushed out of his eye, several smaller spaces began to appear in a crisscross fashion across the space that had trapped Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Othniel seemed to want to use these small spaces to directly cut Eastern Emperor Taiyi into countless pieces.
<br><br>
When the small spaces began to appear, they immediately targeted Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body and locked on to him. Numerous large and small cuts appeared on the surface of his body. The cuts continued to deepen rapidly, and blood began to flow out.
<br><br>
Just as Othniel was about to breathe a sigh of relief with the feeling that he had finally defeated at least one of the opponents, a small figure suddenly appeared at the top of the spaces he had created.
<br><br>
Chapter 3922 Struggle Zen's appearance hadn't returned to normal; he was still a ten feet tall monster and in this form, his aura had also undergone a huge change.
<br><br>
At a glance, Othniel could not recognize him. But under current circumstances, any creature daring to come down could not be ordinary.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
The blue light in Othniel's only eye flickered and a space formed on either side of Zen.
<br><br>
If these spaces could restrain him, he'd be able to cut him in half with ease.
<br><br>
But as soon as they enveloped Zen's body, they dissipated immediately! "What?"
<br><br>
Othniel was dumbfounded and he quickly thought of Zen in his mind. Was this monster actually him? This thought lingered in his mind when Zen suddenly grew even more, to a monster more than eight million feet tall! When Zen had previously activated his Wild God Body, he was only capable of expanding to around four million feet high. Before he had activated it this time, he still believed that was his limit.
<br><br>
He now realized, however, that his body had doubled in size! Was it because he had devoured Lamont? Othniel had a bad feeling about this.
<br><br>
Zen had been able to break the Grandmaster of Heaven's Fishing Drum, and the triangular world he had summoned, quite easily. If this horrific monster truly was Zen, he was now stuck in quite a terrible situation.
<br><br>
Even more curious were Lamont's features that this monster shared; such as his long, strong arms with the white hair on them.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" Othniel asked brazenly, raising his head.
<br><br>
All Zen offered was an ugly smile. He then raised his foot and stamped down lightly, creating a huge crater in the space that imprisoned the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi! "It really is him..."
<br><br>
Othniel was now sure it was Zen; only he could break through his space barrier so quickly and easily.
<br><br>
But why had he become this monstrosity...
<br><br>
He was still lost in confusion when the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had thrust his sword out, sending countless golden rays of sword radiance bursting out.
<br><br>
Phew! The space already had a big hole in it and now the sword radiance obliterated it into pieces.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
The sharp golden radiance covered Othniel like a net.
<br><br>
His space barrier could hold the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but it didn't mean he had the power to do as he pleased to him.
<br><br>
Once the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had pushed his own bloodline to the limit, he displayed an outrageous and terrifying level of swordsmanship. If Othniel wasn't careful, he'd be sliced up for sure.
<br><br>
He retreated as fast as he could, at the same time clapping his hands and creating space shields ten million feet wide, one after the other.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang...
<br><br>
The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi chased him down relentlessly, shattering every space shield he came across.
<br><br>
The golden sword light was like the God of Death, not resting until it had taken him! He then went all out, doing all he could to shake off the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi. As he did, he suddenly felt a space fluctuation from above.
<br><br>
As the Chaos Ancient God in charge of the space truth, Othniel was extremely sensitive to space fluctuations, and as soon as he felt it, he knew it was Zen who had begun attacking him! "Buzz..."
<br><br>
He pointed upwards as a reflex and a space fluctuation surrounded Zen, ready to exile him to a corner of the chaos.
<br><br>
Othniel had lost sight of the fact that his original intention of attacking the Pear Hill was to complete the Element Spirit race's mission - capture Zen at all costs.
<br><br>
But he now planned to exile him because he felt threatened! It mattered not. As the space fluctuations gathered on Zen's body, they disappeared instantly, without a trace...
<br><br>
It was then that Othniel felt clearly that Zen's body had given off a space fluctuation opposite to his to counter his exile force! "How is this possible?"
<br><br>
Othniel's eye was overflowed with disbelief.
<br><br>
A power absolutely opposite to his own power of space actually existed in the chaos? If he hadn't seen it with his own eye, he wouldn't have believed it. More to it, Zen had pulled it off so effortlessly.
<br><br>
Othniel still hung in a state of astonishment when Zen pounced over and seized him from behind into his tight grip.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
From not far off, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi took this opportunity to attack, the golden sword radiance exploding and inflicting many bloody holes on Othniel's body.
<br><br>
Othniel then desperately activated his bloodline power to teleport himself away. The blue space truth circled around his body, making him seem like an object about to disappear. His body morphed back and forth between a shadow and a real body of substance, popping in and out of view.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Othniel continued struggling as sixteen ribs as sharp as swords, shot out of Zen's chest and pierced into his body. Then the barbs that grew from the ribs bound the two bodies firmly together.
<br><br>
The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been in Zen's inner world this whole time, so he had a general understanding of the ancestry-level bloodline within him. Even so, what he saw now shocked him to his core. How did this kid have such an attack method? Othniel felt the pain and knew something bad was about to happen.
<br><br>
There was still a considerable gap between him and Lamont in their abilities to use truth-level theurgies.
<br><br>
Lamont was skilled at controlling temperature. Relying on extreme cold, he was almost immune to all energy attacks. This was why the Divine Crystal Array of King Leuan had failed to hurt him.
<br><br>
As for Othniel, his skill lay in controlling space and his theurgy was unparalleled in confinement and escape! With a roar, Othniel's body suddenly collapsed like a tower made of sand. Every grain of sand within his body turned into a Minimum Space, which was the smallest matter in the chaos. Only then did Othniel finally rid himself of Zen's control.
<br><br>
An eight-foot tall person was made up of tens of billions of Minimum Spaces. Othniel's massive body possessed way more than that.
<br><br>
Innumerable Minimum Spaces, indistinguishable to the naked eye, moved to another spot where Othniel's body gradually reformed. This process was, however, heavily draining for him.
<br><br>
When he finally looked at Zen again, fear filled his eye as he realized that if he had not just put everything he had into escaping, he would probably have lost his life. What Zen said next proved him right.
<br><br>
"Impressive. Your method is much smarter than Lamont's, but that's it." The voice that rang from his chest sounded very strange.
<br><br>
Othniel suddenly widened his eye. "Lamont has descended to the Pear Hill? What happened to him?"
<br><br>
In his heart he already knew the answer. The white hair and the pair of arms on Zen's body told him all he needed to know but it was still hard to accept that a Chaos Ancient God had died at Zen's hands.
<br><br>
After all, for as long as one could recall, a human had never killed a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
As existences that controlled the truth in the chaos, the Chaos Ancient Gods were thought to be invincible.
<br><br>
"He is dead," Zen said decisively, giving Othniel the answer he least wanted to hear.
<br><br>
Chapter 3923 Lawless Cage It was true that there were many forces in the chaos, but it didn't make things complicated.
<br><br>
After the six Chaos Ancient Gods split into two factions, the division of powers in the Source World became quite stable.
<br><br>
Fuxi was the one who wanted to complete the Finale Way the most. He tried his best to make himself stronger, enough to kill the Chaos Ancient Gods and break the balance.
<br><br>
The only thing was that the Chaos Ancient Gods were invincible, and this was one of the truths in the chaos.
<br><br>
He couldn't break that truth, but Zen had surprisingly done it.
<br><br>
Othniel looked at Zen again, but this time with a hint of fear and caution.
<br><br>
After all, the Chaos Ancient Gods were not immortal. Anyone whose life was on the line, like him, would be on guard.
<br><br>
Although he already believed what Zen said, he still countered, "Just you? Don't brag about yourself!"
<br><br>
Zen glanced at him indifferently and said, "You'll know whether I'm bragging or not soon."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he suddenly disappeared from where he stood.
<br><br>
Moreover, his disappearance didn't cause any space fluctuation, nor did he build a space channel.
<br><br>
It was as if he had used another theurgy that never existed before to teleport! Naturally, Othniel was shocked when he saw that Zen had disappeared.
<br><br>
After all, he was a Chaos Ancient God in charge of the space truth. What skillful method did Zen use to avoid his detection? "Buzz!"
<br><br>
His eye glowed a bright blue then he released a mighty truth power. That was when he finally noticed something.
<br><br>
There was an immensely thin line in the black void that moved like a worm as it swiftly approached him.
<br><br>
When he got to see it more clearly, it was already quite close to him! "Go!"
<br><br>
In turn, he used the Grand Teleportation without a second thought.
<br><br>
Zen had already jumped out from the end of the line the moment Othniel disappeared, but it was too late. Othniel had already teleported far away.
<br><br>
"He actually spotted me. If it was any other Chaos Ancient God, they probably couldn't have done that." Zen shrugged.
<br><br>
After the ancestry-level bloodline devoured Lamont, it naturally became more interested in consuming Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline also played an active role when Zen dealt with Othniel. For instance, the bloodline released this particular space theurgy that even Othniel found it hard to see through it. Zen almost succeeded in devouring him just now.
<br><br>
Even though Othniel could also still turn into multiple Minimum Spaces to escape, such a method consumed a lot of energy, and he might not be able to get away after a few uses.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he failed to catch Othniel at his first attempt. At that point, he turned around and nodded at the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi understood what Zen meant. His eyes flashed with a sharp light, and the long sword in his hand turned into golden lights that filled the sky and swept towards Othniel. At the same time, Zen disappeared again.
<br><br>
Othniel dodged the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's golden sword radiance and simultaneously watched out for the curved line.
<br><br>
The line was easy to miss, and it was almost impossible to distinguish it among the bright golden sword radiance.
<br><br>
He used the Grand Teleportation once more, and his large body dashed forward while he avoided the golden sword radiance. In a short amount of time, he was already millions of miles away.
<br><br>
But the moment he stopped, the line appeared behind him out of nowhere.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen's ribs extended and seized him from behind once again! "Puff, puff, puff, puff..."
<br><br>
The thick, sharp ribs pierced through his body and left sixteen gaping, bloody holes on it.
<br><br>
This time, he did not struggle anymore. He immediately turned into trillions of Minimum Spaces and escaped from Zen's arms before his body condensed and took shape again.
<br><br>
However, although he was powerful, he felt exhausted the second time he turned into multiple Minimum Spaces.
<br><br>
Just as he took shape again, Zen disappeared and turned into a thin line once more, then flew straight towards him. He didn't even have a chance to catch his breath! As he observed Zen's aggressive attack, he only sighed and finally chose to exile.
<br><br>
He couldn't exile Zen, but he could exile himself.
<br><br>
When Zen appeared at the end of the thin line, Othniel had already gone to the edge of the Source World.
<br><br>
"He didn't use the Grand Teleportation this time?" Of course, he was surprised.
<br><br>
"He must have exiled himself. I'm afraid it will take some time to get him back," the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi said with certainty.
<br><br>
"He sure ran fast," Zen muttered with a shrug. At that point, the chaos cloud in the distance burst and unleashed a strong energy fluctuation.
<br><br>
He and the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi glanced at each other, then swiftly went straight for the chaos cloud.
<br><br>
The chaos cloud was incomparably enormous. It was so big that a body millions of feet high was only like a drop in the ocean compared to it! Outside the chaos cloud were sixteen tall purple pillars that floated in the air. Each purple pillar was painted with mysterious patterns and contained vast amounts of hidden power.
<br><br>
Then, the purple pillars turned into a perfect cage and trapped all those from the Pear Hill inside it.
<br><br>
The real Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald, and Judson all had suffered heavy injuries.
<br><br>
There was a big hole one million feet wide on the real Fuxi's chest. A black fire burned on the hole to prevent the horrible wound from healing.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Judson lost an arm, and half of his head got broken.
<br><br>
However, Gerald looked the worst of them all. Both of his pincers were damaged.
<br><br>
Only the real Snake Goddess looked slightly better. Although she was not injured, her face still looked fatigued. The battle with the Grandmaster of Heaven had cost a lot of her energy.
<br><br>
Gerald's life truth-level theurgy could immediately heal all their wounds, but the black fire kept their wounds burning at bay.
<br><br>
The black fire was the nemesis of the life truth. Back then, it took Gerald a lot of time to get rid of the black fire when it burned him once. Now that he was currently in an intense battle, he didn't have time to help his companions deal with the fire.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the cage formed by the purple pillars was the Lawless Cage, which Herbert had made using the confinement truth.
<br><br>
Therefore, the warriors who were inside it lost half their strength.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven stood on one of the purple pillars and looked down at them. "I can give you a chance to join our Nihility race and surrender to me," he said with a cold smile.
<br><br>
As Herbert, who had built the Lawless Cage, heard those words, his face instantly darkened.
<br><br>
It was true that the Grandmaster of Heaven was powerful, but Herbert also contributed greatly in subduing the four warriors.
<br><br>
Also, his stand was completely different from the Grandmaster of Heaven's.
<br><br>
The only reason they worked together was that they wanted to fight against the Pear Hill. After that, a battle would probably ensue between them.
<br><br>
Now, the Grandmaster of Heaven wanted to make all the people of the Pear Hill surrender to him. How could he accept that? "Grandmaster of Heaven, you and I worked together in order to take down the Pear Hill. These people can't be restrained; they can only be killed," he said bluntly.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven turned to look at him and sneered, "Why should I listen to you?"
<br><br>
"I also did my part to take them down," he threatened. "If I remove the Lawless Cage, I'm afraid you'll also be in trouble."
<br><br>
No matter how strong the Grandmaster of Heaven was, it was hard for him to deal with the two Chaos Ancient Gods at the same time. What was more, the real Fuxi and the real Snake Goddess were there as well, so he was less likely to win the fight.
<br><br>
"This Lawless Cage is indeed powerful, but I'm afraid you are not the only one who could control it," the Grandmaster of Heaven said nonchalantly and ignored the threat. Suddenly, four of the sixteen purple pillars rose and trapped Herbert.
<br><br>
Chapter 3924 The Desperate End Back then, the Grandmaster of Heaven had made a contract with Othniel using the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake.
<br><br>
According to the contract, he would not attack Othniel before taking down Pear Hill.
<br><br>
However, the contract didn't mention anything about Herbert.
<br><br>
Now that he had taken advantage of Herbert to capture the people of Pear Hill and possessed the same abilities as the latter, Herbert no longer had any value to him. "What do you mean by doing so, Grandmaster of Heaven?"
<br><br>
Herbert's face darkened.
<br><br>
He already felt that he had gotten quite weaker in the Lawless Cage.
<br><br>
If he completely lost control of the Lawless Cage, then the Grandmaster of Heaven could do anything to him.
<br><br>
"I'm eliminating my future enemies in advance. Is there anything wrong about that?" the Grandmaster of Heaven stated matter-of-factly.
<br><br>
As the head of the Nihility race, the Grandmaster of Heaven was one of the Element Spirit Civilization's mortal enemies. It was inevitable for him to confront Herbert.
<br><br>
"You..."
<br><br>
Herbert's body began to glow brightly as he tried hard to activate his bloodline power.
<br><br>
As the powerful energy surged in his body, the purple pillars also began to glow. It was clear that he was scrambling for control over the Lawless Cage.
<br><br>
If he was still outside the Lawless Cage, he could've probably defeated the Grandmaster of Heaven with his excellent understanding of the truth power.
<br><br>
But now, the Lawless Cage greatly limited his strength. His struggle only lasted for a few seconds before victory was declared.
<br><br>
In the end, he had to admit defeat to the Grandmaster of Heaven. "As the leader of the Nihility race, you are shameful to be such a treacherous man!"
<br><br>
Herbert snapped resentfully.
<br><br>
"I never swore anything to you. What made me treacherous?" the Grandmaster of Heaven said with a shrug.
<br><br>
"You..." At that point, Herbert was too angry to speak anymore.
<br><br>
Unlike the other Chaos Ancient Gods, he rarely traveled around the mortal world. Thus, he didn't know about such lies and deceit.
<br><br>
"Hmph, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization are all the same. They only come to you when they need something from you, then they will kill you the moment you're of no use to them. I tried to convince you before, but you ignored my words like nothing!" Fuxi suddenly shouted from the side.
<br><br>
Fuxi had lent his body to the real Fuxi, but he still got detained in the end.
<br><br>
Still, he didn't blame it on the real Fuxi.
<br><br>
After all, things might have ended up worse if he had personally fought in the battle.
<br><br>
When he saw that Herbert also got incarcerated in the Lawless Cage, he couldn't help but grab control of his body again so he could sneer at Herbert.
<br><br>
In the past, he had almost won Herbert over to their side. However, the latter finally believed other people's lies and chose to follow the Purge Way.
<br><br>
As for Herbert, he was enraged at first, but expressed mockery upon hearing Fuxi's words. "Isn't Pear Hill the leader of the Finale Way? You thought you were right and justified, but all of you just ended up like me!"
<br><br>
he retorted.
<br><br>
At that moment, Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald, and Judson, all felt downhearted.
<br><br>
The end of chaos would bring about destruction sooner or later.
<br><br>
The chaos had already experienced many ends now. When the ends of the previous rounds of chaos came, people still had a chance to fight back. In this round, however, they didn't even get to try. It was truly pathetic.
<br><br>
"Even if we can't complete the Finale Way in this round of chaos, we will have another chance in the next round," Fuxi shot back.
<br><br>
Herbert laughed and pointed towards the Grandmaster of Heaven. "Now that victory belongs to him and the Nihility race, do you think there will be another round of chaos?" he scoffed.
<br><br>
Fuxi glanced at the Grandmaster of Heaven, and he finally felt hopeless.
<br><br>
He and the Snake Goddess knew their mission very well ever since the establishment of Pear Hill. The Finale Way remained engraved in their bones, and they were not afraid to sacrifice themselves for it.
<br><br>
He believed that after many rounds of chaos, a noble hero would emerge and lead them to their victory.
<br><br>
If they could not do it after trying one thousand times, then they would try ten thousand times. If they could not do it after trying ten thousand times, then one hundred thousand times.
<br><br>
Besides, time was quite cheap compared to their eternal cause. As long as it was still possible to complete the Finale Way, they would eventually succeed after countless attempts. That was Fuxi's belief.
<br><br>
However, at that moment, he realized that he had underestimated the Nihility race. They were simply a group of insane monsters! The most incredible thing about it all was that the leader of the Nihility race was a real human! "You… Why did you choose the Nihility Way?" Fuxi raised his head and asked.
<br><br>
The connection between the Grandmaster of Heaven and the 77th civilization was clear to the real Fuxi and the real Snake Goddess, but not to him.
<br><br>
"You are just a replica. It's meaningless for you to know much," the Grandmaster of Heaven said indifferently. "You just need to know that if you want to live, you have to submit to me!" he declared.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, he shook his long sleeve then a black ship came out of it.
<br><br>
The captain of the Black Ship leaped out from the bow and simultaneously activated the Wild God Body. Then, he summoned the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake.
<br><br>
"Make your vow before the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake. If you submit to the Grandmaster of Heaven and join the Nihility race, you can live," said the captain.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, not even a Chaos Ancient God could escape the restrictions of such contracts. Once they took an oath, they had to follow it all their lives.
<br><br>
"If you refuse, I'll send you to hell," the Grandmaster of Heaven stated in a deathly calm voice as if he didn't care about their choices at all.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Judson, Gerald and Herbert all fell silent.
<br><br>
Warriors at their level could afford to accept death, but they still had to consider their companions' situations if they died.
<br><br>
Most importantly, defeat in this war would probably cost Pear Hill everything.
<br><br>
"My time is limited," the Grandmaster of Heaven chirped as he gently brandished the Cyan Misty Sword. Cyan sword radiance mixed with black fire swayed on the edge of the weapon.
<br><br>
This battle only eliminated Pear Hill's forces, and the Grandmaster of Heaven knew he hadn't won the final victory yet. Next, he had to deal with the Element Spirit Civilization. The battle against them might take place in the chaos or the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Since no one had spoken yet, he shot the cyan sword radiance at them.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! The strike punctured all of their chests, and black flames burned hotly in their wounds.
<br><br>
Although such injuries weren't enough to kill them, the black fire still felt like torture. Everyone's faces twisted in pain.
<br><br>
However, even though the black fire burned continuously, all of them in the Lawless Cage endured it silently without yielding.
<br><br>
"I only want to recruit more men in the chaos who could be of use to me, but it looks like you are all strong-willed people. Since you refuse to join me, let me send you to hell."
<br><br>
With a murderous glint, the Grandmaster of Heaven waved his hand, and the entire Lawless Cage began to shrink rapidly.
<br><br>
The distance between the purple pillars continued to lessen, while the pressure inside the cage increased.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others still tried hard to resist the black fire, but they had quite a hard time now that the Lawless Cage was also shrinking.
<br><br>
As they became increasingly powerless to resist, the black fire burned more and more wildly on their bodies and brought death closer to them.
<br><br>
Buzz! Just then, a golden sword radiance crossed a vast distance and slashed squarely on the Lawless Cage.
<br><br>
The mighty golden sword radiance was powerful enough to go against the Grandmaster of Heaven's cyan sword radiance. Its attack rocked the entire Lawless Cage quite violently, which weakened the cage's restraints.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Snake Goddess and the others inside it had a chance to breathe.
<br><br>
"Eastern Emperor Taiyi?"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven raised his head and looked at the figure in the far end of the horizon. He had thought that it would be Othniel who came out of the battleground victoriously, but that was not the case.
<br><br>
Chapter 3925 Unexpected Appearance The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not weak by any means, but he was no match for Othniel.
<br><br>
That was why it shocked the Grandmaster of Heaven a great deal to see him walking towards them.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald and Judson also sported expressions of surprise on their faces, while Herbert even bordered on desperation.
<br><br>
In a flash, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi spiraled into the air and brandished his golden sword radiance.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz...
<br><br>
His bloodline-activated swordsmanship was geared to the max as nineteen golden long swords were summoned by his side.
<br><br>
These golden swords looked illusory and extended far into the distance.
<br><br>
Some directly stabbed into the Source World, but did not really damage it.
<br><br>
A few sensitive creatures felt their hearts palpitate but nothing more.
<br><br>
The blades, however, were very solid and even the toughest magic treasure in the chaos could be slashed open by them easily.
<br><br>
Buzz! With a shrill, ear-shattering whistle, the nineteen golden swords merged into one and immediately slashed down towards the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
At the moment before impact, the light emanated from the blade and formed a golden arc in the air. A terrifying force was released from the sword as the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was going to break through the Lawless Cage and pierce through the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes sparkled in excitement. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi is so powerful!"
<br><br>
In contrast, the real Snake Goddess was calm and the real Fuxi sighed slightly.
<br><br>
The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was by no means weak, but the gap between him and the Grandmaster of Heaven was way too big. Even if he pushed that physical body to the limit, his efforts would remain futile.
<br><br>
They had no idea how the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi defeated Othniel, but it would be impossible for him to change the situation now.
<br><br>
In the face of such a seemingly devastating attack, the Grandmaster of Heaven only snorted as he lifted his own Cyan Misty Sword to resist his oncoming opponent's attack.
<br><br>
His sword was fixed and stayed motionless atop his head.
<br><br>
Bang! Upon the moment of impact with the Cyan Misty Sword, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's golden sword trembled. However, the Cyan Misty Sword remained motionless.
<br><br>
With eyes full of determination, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi clenched his hand and lifted his sword to let out a series of slashes upon his opponent.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! This golden sword was his strongest theurgy, but it remained unable to shake the Cyan Misty Sword that kept resisting each attack.
<br><br>
During the course of the one-sided struggle, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi tried to change the direction of his strikes in an attempt to kill his target but to no avail.
<br><br>
All the Grandmaster of Heaven did was flicking his finger and blocking each of his pursuer's sword strikes.
<br><br>
After ten strikes, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's sword showed signs of fatigue and the golden light was significantly dimmer than before.
<br><br>
"I have no idea how you managed to escape Othniel, but since you're brave enough to come at me and court death, then I will fulfill your wish," the Grandmaster of Heaven muttered darkly as he went through the purple pillars and headed straight towards the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi! As soon as he got out of the Lawless Cage, Herbert immediately tried to gain control. However, the Grandmaster of Heaven merely turned around and silenced him with a glare. Soon enough, several purple pillars flashed and suppressed Herbert.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi remained resolute and had no plans to retreat. He continued to wave his dimmed golden sword and hacked away at the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Whoosh! It was a battle of blades as each strike from the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was deflected by the Grandmaster of Heaven's Cyan Misty Sword. In the blink of an eye, the latter appeared in front of his opponent, slashing at him with his Cyan Misty Sword in order to conclude this fight.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!" the Grandmaster of Heaven shouted.
<br><br>
However, in the split second that he was about to deal his blow, the Grandmaster of Heaven saw a look of ridicule on the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's face with no trace of cowardice whatsoever.
<br><br>
How could someone make such an expression in the face of death? Momentarily distracted by his confusion, the Grandmaster of Heaven was caught off-guard when he felt a piercing sensation at the back of his neck that soon escalated into indescribable pain.
<br><br>
He turned around on reflex and saw a huge, ugly, gorilla-like monster in front of him.
<br><br>
"Fuck off!" he screamed just as the monster was about to hug him.
<br><br>
His reaction was extremely fast and he was able to predict what would happen next.
<br><br>
In an effort to ward off the beast, the Grandmaster of Heaven held his Cyan Misty Sword in front of him and was ready to pierce through the oncoming monster's chest.
<br><br>
If this monster dared to come closer, he would surely cut it in half with the Cyan Misty Sword! Of course, any regular creature would immediately give up, but Zen was considerably all-powerful in this form.
<br><br>
Two ribs suddenly drilled out of his chest, strange, solid and metalliclooking. At the end of each rib was a small split that held the Cyan Misty Sword at bay.
<br><br>
The strange sight made the Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes widen in shock.
<br><br>
It was as if the two ribs had formed a customized sword rack for his blade! "What the hell is that?!" he cursed in disgust.
<br><br>
It was half amazing yet also half disturbing.
<br><br>
While he was frozen in shock, Zen took the chance to wrap his arms around him. At the same time, a few more ribs jutted out of his body and pierced through the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Puff, puff, puff...
<br><br>
These ribs were akin to the sharpest sword and thus were able to pierce through the Grandmaster of Heaven's flesh with no resistance at all.
<br><br>
All the onlookers in the Lawless Cage could do was to stare at this scene with looks of disbelief on their faces.
<br><br>
"Who the hell is that?"
<br><br>
"Where in the world did this monster come from?"
<br><br>
"Is fate smiling down on us and sending us help?"
<br><br>
Everyone knew that their fortunes had just been reversed by the sudden appearance of this white-haired monster.
<br><br>
Ever since the battle began, Fuxi and the others had no time to pay attention to Zen.
<br><br>
They thought that even if Zen was able to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline, he was still weak compared to the Chaos Ancient Gods and there was no way he'd be able to contend with them. That was the reason why they asked him to guard the Pear Hill with Yan.
<br><br>
Who would've thought Zen would be their unlikely trump card in the form of this white-haired monster.
<br><br>
As the Grandmaster of Heaven was trapped within Zen's arms, he forcibly tried to struggle, just as Othniel had done.
<br><br>
His figure constantly shifted between blurry and solid, yet he remained in Zen's hold. Soon enough, he came up with the same escape method Othniel had used and turned himself into countless Minimum Spaces to escape.
<br><br>
There was a sour expression on the Grandmaster of Heaven's face as he shifted into countless Minimum Spaces, since it was, after all, Othniel's ability that helped him escape.
<br><br>
He glared hard at the monster. "Who are you?" he asked coldly.
<br><br>
It wasn't just him. Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald, Judson, and even Herbert wanted to know who this monster was.
<br><br>
There was no powerful beast that existed in the chaos like the one in front of them, save perhaps for the Chaos Ancient God, Lamont.
<br><br>
Chapter 3926 Breaking The Lawless Cage Even before the battle began, Zen's body had already started mutating, and the Snake Goddess had noticed it.
<br><br>
When the huge monster suddenly appeared, she had a hunch but was still a little uncertain. The gap between the monster and Zen was just too great.
<br><br>
For one, Zen's Wild God Body was only a little over four million feet tall.
<br><br>
However, this monster's body was over ten million feet tall. It was more than twice of Zen's size.
<br><br>
"It's a pity that you dodged it," Zen said with an unpleasant sound coming from his chest.
<br><br>
The voice had a strong penetrating power that would send shivers on one's spine, and there was also a bewitching power in it.
<br><br>
Almost all living things would instinctively feel fear and disgust towards Zen when they heard his voice. Even those powerful Eternal Realm masters were of no exception.
<br><br>
"Who the hell are you?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked again. He instinctively felt that this monster would be difficult to deal with. If it was possible, he wouldn't take the chance to fight it.
<br><br>
"This is impossible. There is no such existence in the chaos!" The captain of the Black Ship was in denial as the monster didn't give a direct answer.
<br><br>
It was the Black Ship's duty to gather news and information in the chaos for the Nihility race.
<br><br>
If the captain missed accounting such a powerful existence, it would be a grave dereliction of his duty.
<br><br>
The captain was so puzzled. If the monster was really from the chaos, there was no way that it would just appear out of nowhere. 'Is this creature from the Other Shore then?' he thought.
<br><br>
"Such a bother! What..."
<br><br>
As the Grandmaster of Heaven was still conversing with the captain of the Black Ship, the monster secretly turned and gave a hint to Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
With that, Eastern Emperor Taiyi condensed his golden sword again and took the opportunity to hack it towards the Grandmaster of Heaven's head while his guard was down.
<br><br>
However, the Grandmaster of Heaven was too strong to fall for a sneak attack. With just a flip of his Cyan Misty Sword, he deflected the incoming sword strike.
<br><br>
But what he didn't know was that it was just a diversion created by the white-haired monster. While the Grandmaster of Heaven was busy with the attacks from Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he didn't notice that the monster had already disappeared. The next moment, it emerged inside the Lawless Cage, next to Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Herbert was the one who created the Lawless Cage. It looked ordinary on the outside, but it was extremely powerful.
<br><br>
Even Chaos Ancient Gods like Gerald, Judson, and Herbert himself, were completely suppressed by the Lawless Cage.
<br><br>
With the sudden appearance of the white-haired monster, they thought that it might have the chance to defeat the Grandmaster of Heaven. Everyone who was held captive inside the Lawless Cage thought that the monster could bring the situation a favorable turn.
<br><br>
However, to their dismay, they didn't expect that the monster would enter the Lawless Cage on its own volition.
<br><br>
"Why are you here? Are you out of your mind?"
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes widened as he stared at the white-haired monster. He wanted to curse as he discerned that the monster just made a seemingly stupid move.
<br><br>
On the other hand, both the Grandmaster of Heaven and the captain of the Black Ship didn't understand what just happened but were overjoyed by the unexpected turn of events.
<br><br>
No one expected that the monster would throw itself into the Lawless Cage.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful a person was, their strength would be greatly weakened if they were trapped inside the Lawless Cage. As a result, the Grandmaster of Heaven could do anything to them as he wished.
<br><br>
He initially thought that the white-haired monster was going to be troublesome, but he didn't expect it to be so reckless.
<br><br>
Now, almost all his powerful opponents were already inside the cage. Only one remained outside.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a sharp light flashed in the eyes of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. A line of undecipherable Sanskrit words flowed down his face like tears.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! As the Sanskrit words glinted, his strength and speed immediately surged.
<br><br>
Right now, he was the only one who could move freely and take on the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven also increased the aura gushing from his body. This instantly made Eastern Emperor Taiyi heighten his senses and defenses. Under the constant activation of his bloodline power, the golden sword emitted a blinding light again.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Lawless Cage, the black fire that enveloped several parts of the bodies of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Gerald, and Judson hadn't been extinguished. While the Grandmaster of Heaven was dealing with the white-haired monster earlier, the suppression force of the cage had somewhat weakened. Therefore, they were able to at least stop the fire from expanding further.
<br><br>
However, now that the Grandmaster of Heaven was just dealing with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the suppression force of the Lawless Cage had increased greatly again.
<br><br>
Given the speed and the intensity of the black fire, it wouldn't be long before it devoured all those who were affected.
<br><br>
At this crucial moment, the white-haired monster suddenly reached out and grabbed the purple pillars of the cage.
<br><br>
The purple pillars of the Lawless Cage were supposed to be indestructible from the inside. Even with the combined powers and efforts of the two Chaos Ancient Gods, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess, the purple pillars didn't budge at all.
<br><br>
Upon seeing what the monster was doing, all of the prisoners inside laughed bitterly. Herbert, who was also watching, shook his head.
<br><br>
However, a few moments after the white-haired monster grabbed the pillars, the purple light on their surface instantly dimmed and gradually turned into a gray light, which spread rapidly throughout the entire cage.
<br><br>
"What's happening?"
<br><br>
"Hey, what is this?"
<br><br>
"Are you breaking the Lawless Cage?!"
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes widened and their jaws dropped.
<br><br>
In front of them, the seemingly invincible Lawless Cage was collapsing like a fragile sculpture.
<br><br>
Herbert, who was the creator of the Lawless Cage, was the most surprised.
<br><br>
As he comprehended the mechanism of the Lawless Cage from the power of truth, he knew that only the outer layer of the cage was vulnerable.
<br><br>
That was why the sword attack of Eastern Emperor Taiyi from before made the Lawless Cage tremble. But there was no way to deliberately destroy it from the inside.
<br><br>
Or so they thought—until they witnessed how the white-haired monster destroyed it with its bare hands.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was about to go all out on capturing Eastern Emperor Taiyi when he suddenly perceived that something wrong was going on. As he turned at the direction of the Lawless Cage, his face grew pale at what he saw.
<br><br>
The purple light of the Lawless Cage had turned to gray. It seemed like it was eroded by some kind of opposing energy.
<br><br>
"What did you…"
<br><br>
Victory was almost in the grasp of the Grandmaster of Heaven. Once he killed all the people inside the cage, the problem in the chaos would be solved. The only thing that he needed to focus afterward was the war on the Other Shore. However, all his plans crumbled when this unknown monster suddenly appeared and destroyed the Lawless Cage effortlessly.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was quick-witted. He didn't want to believe his suspicion, but it was the only explanation. "Damn it! You are Zen!"
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had used a similar ability, and only he possessed such an unusual and powerful skill in the entire chaos.
<br><br>
Fuxi, who had just escaped from the Lawless Cage, glared at the whitehaired monster when he heard the cry of the Grandmaster of Heaven. "Wait.
<br><br>
Are you really Zen? What kind of ability is that? No offense, but you completely look like an ugly monster."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was just calm. Gerald and Judson also had a hunch earlier. When they saw how the monster easily crushed the Lawless Cage, they instantly knew the identity of the white-haired monster.
<br><br>
"Yes, it's me. Ha-ha, you don't have to emphasize the ugly part." Zen had no intention of hiding his identity.
<br><br>
"Well, given your remarkable strength, your appearance doesn't really matter," Fuxi said as he stared at Zen's body with admiration. Although it was weird, every part of it was useful and suitable for killing and fighting.
<br><br>
"Herbert, are you seeing this? As a zillion creatures have been born in these over a thousand chaotic eras, there are always some powerful beings that would appear no matter what. Now, do you still want to be part of the other side?" Gerald pointed out as he tried to persuade Herbert.
<br><br>
Herbert chose to follow the Purge Way, though he was a little uncertain.
<br><br>
The ancient and powerful Element Spirit Civilization made him think that it would be much easier to complete the Purge Way.
<br><br>
However, after seeing what Zen did today, Herbert began to harbor doubts and have a little change of perspective. He thought that perhaps, it was destined that this round of chaos became different from the rest.
<br><br>
Herbert kept quiet and didn't reply. As a Chaos Ancient God, he didn't have the luxury to easily change his mind. But for now, since he was released, the only certain thing was the Grandmaster of Heaven was his enemy.
<br><br>
Chapter 3927 The Foundation The Grandmaster of Heaven had worked hard to come up with the situation.
<br><br>
But only within a short period, it was ruined.
<br><br>
The people who had been controlled had obtained their freedom, resulting in him facing seven opponents including Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald, Judson, Zen, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Herbert! They were all top masters of the Eternal Realm, except for the three Chaos Ancient Gods—Judson, Herbert and Gerald; and Zen was even more remarkable.
<br><br>
As for the Grandmaster of Heaven, he only had one helper, the captain of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
In the face of these powerful masters, the captain could not do anything to them. When it came to real strength, he would be at a disadvantage in the battle with Fuxi, far inferior to the real Fuxi.
<br><br>
"I made the correct judgment when we were in the Grand Plain Stage," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, staring at Zen with confidence.
<br><br>
He believed that Zen deserved the Nihility race's great deal of effort to win him over, so he took action in person. Unfortunately, neither he nor Claire had succeeded.
<br><br>
Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven both had sharp intuition. They were determined that they had to get Zen. He could either be destroyed or become a huge hidden trouble if they couldn't get him.
<br><br>
Therefore, the only purpose that the Black Ship and the Bearing race attacked the Oneness Sky Palace after Zen entered the Eternal Scroll Painting was to take him.
<br><br>
However, contrary to the wishes of the Black Ship and the Bearing race, the situation had developed to this point after the three forces took action. It was beyond the Grandmaster of Heaven's expectations.
<br><br>
It had only been a short while since Zen returned, but he was able to kill him.
<br><br>
What kind of bloodline did Zen get? Even the origin-level bloodline shouldn't be so powerful in a short time.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter whether your judgment is right or wrong, because you can't affect the situation," Zen responded, dismissing the Grandmaster of Heaven's certainty.
<br><br>
There were two choices for the Grandmaster of Heaven at the moment. He could either abandon the Descending Ring and escape back to the Other Shore, or stay where he was and fight to death.
<br><br>
The Nihility race didn't suffer too much loss. Returning to the Other Shore was the best choice for the Grandmaster of Heaven. He could wait for the next opportunity, and when the Element Spirit Civilization fought with the Pear Hill, he could take the chance to achieve his goal.
<br><br>
However, he was still a ruthless master who had fought with the Eye Spirit for several hundred chaotic eras. After he heard Zen's remark, a fierce light flashed through his eyes, and his lips curled into a sinister smile.
<br><br>
"Hahaha...
<br><br>
It's so ridiculous..." the Grandmaster of Heaven said condescendingly.
<br><br>
He pointed at Gerald, saying, "Do you really think that you will be able to reverse the situation just because there is someone like Zen in this round of chaos? Do you think that the Finale Way, which could not be completed for over a thousand chaotic eras, could be completed this time?"
<br><br>
His voice resonated with sarcasm as he heard what Gerald had just said to Herbert.
<br><br>
"The only fate of the chaos is to remain desolate forever. This chaos and the other tens of thousands of worlds could never escape from it, including you!" the Grandmaster of Heaven sneered as he waved his hand at the crowd.
<br><br>
The faces of Gerald, Judson, Herbert and Fuxi were consumed with shock as they heard this declaration.
<br><br>
However, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Zen, and the real Snake Goddess stayed calm, unswayed by his words.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven had great insight and sensed the wave of emotions crashing over everyone. However, he wondered why Zen, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the real Snake Goddess seemed unbothered.
<br><br>
"The other tens of thousands of worlds... Do you mean that there are similar worlds outside the chaos that have been destroyed?" Fuxi asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
Not long ago, Fuxi knew that there was an Abstruse Energy World outside the chaos, but he didn't know that there were tens of thousands of other worlds similar to the chaos and that all of them had faced destruction.
<br><br>
"With your thoughts and intelligence, you simply couldn't understand what happened." The Grandmaster of Heaven glared at Fuxi indifferently.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?"
<br><br>
Fuxi stared at him in confusion. As a replicate, Fuxi was not taken seriously by the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"We can't understand? You are exaggerating!" The real Snake Goddess glanced at the Grandmaster of Heaven, turned around, and explained to Fuxi, "The chaos is just a tool to absorb energy. There are tens of thousands of similar worlds outside, and these worlds have provided them with a steady stream of energy. However, they are not united as one. Maybe they have been divided into two factions, three factions, or even more. When these factions took action against each other, many worlds were destroyed, and only the chaos was left. The Element Spirit Civilization is one of those factions." The real Snake Goddess pointed at the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"And you have joined the faction that constantly destroys the worlds and have become their puppet," she accused.
<br><br>
Fuxi speechlessly stared at the real Snake Goddess, wondering why this wisp of energy soul knew so much.
<br><br>
Gerald, Judson, and Herbert were even more stunned, their eyes widening over what was said.
<br><br>
The entire chaos was only a tool for absorbing energy.
<br><br>
There were still many similar worlds, but in the end, the Finale Way had never succeeded. Those worlds had all been destroyed by the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Every word set their eyes ablaze, like shocking lightning.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the real Snake Goddess, almost seeming to commend her unforeseen intelligence.
<br><br>
When Zen returned from the Eternal Scroll Painting and passed through the world of the Ultimate Cycle, the real Snake Goddess that was attached to Zen's body had deciphered some special information. Later, he had gained some knowledge from the brush-wielder, but the brush-wielder had not yet explained everything to him.
<br><br>
Neither Zen nor the Primeval Lord of Heaven knew whether the chaos was the last remaining world or not...
<br><br>
But as soon as the Grandmaster of Heaven said those words, the real Snake Goddess came to this conclusion according to his revelation. It was completely logical–worthy for both Zen's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's admiration.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't expect that the real Snake Goddess would know so much. The excitement on his face slowly faded into a darker emotion, but he still managed to mock her, "So what? My senior fellow disciple has persisted for such a long time, but he hasn't even found out the truth. Now you still want to complete the Finale Way? It is just wishful thinking!"
<br><br>
Hearing the Grandmaster of Heaven make such remarks of ridicule, the real Snake Goddess only shrugged it off with a smile. She knew that the brushwielder gave Zen the hope, which meant that there was a chance to complete the Finale Way. The Grandmaster of Heaven was clueless about that.
<br><br>
"Wait and see if it is just wishful thinking. What I know is you're in a bad situation now!"
<br><br>
Zen slightly leaned his body forward and disappeared after taking a step.
<br><br>
He transformed into a thin thread, spreading towards the Grandmaster of Heaven at an extremely fast speed.
<br><br>
After seeing Zen do his move, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, and the three Chaos Ancient Gods also took action! The powerful warriors each activated their strength at the same time. Even the huge chaos clouds on the side drifted away slowly as if wanting to keep distance from the battle.
<br><br>
"There are some powers that are inappropriate for you," the Grandmaster of Heaven said with a domineering aura. "There are things that you don't qualify to know, and there are also some powers that you cannot resist. In that case, let me show you the foundation of the Nihility race!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3928 The Origin Of The Light Region Raising his Cyan Misty Sword high, the Grandmaster of Heaven had a white light column strike him.
<br><br>
While the chaos wasn't pitch-black, it was rather dim.
<br><br>
The eye-catching white light column appeared abruptly—it seemed to purify everything somehow.
<br><br>
The moment it appeared, Zen raised his brows.
<br><br>
"The Great Sanskrit Light?"
<br><br>
Once Elvinia became a purified being, she mastered the Great Sanskrit Light. Soon after, Zen became a purified being himself and was highly familiar with the Great Sanskrit Light, so he could recognize it at a glance.
<br><br>
Was the Grandmaster of Heaven also a purified being, then? Zen wondered because the man seemed to be able to release the Great Sanskrit Light at will.
<br><br>
But the Great Sanskrit Light could only harm the creatures in the Dark Region—it was completely useless against the creatures from the Light Region.
<br><br>
The creatures in the chaos weren't afraid of this light in the least. Was it somehow related to the "foundation" the Grandmaster of Heaven mentioned? While Zen had become a purified being, he still hadn't been able to figure out the true relationship between the Dark Region and the Light Region. In Stage Fourteen, an Insect Master had told him that their race's ancestor had gone to the dark sky—something that couldn't be found at Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Once Zen climbed up to the Blooming Jade Stage, he learned that the Dark Region was under the Element Spirit Civilization's control. So was the Light Region controlled by the Nihility race, Zen wondered? "I don't care what kind of power you have. I'll smash you to pieces!"
<br><br>
Taking the lead, Fuxi waved his hand from where he stood.
<br><br>
The Eight Diagrams marks weren't imprinted on the Grandmaster of Heaven's body, but on the surface of the column of the Great Sanskrit Light.
<br><br>
And so Fuxi began waving his hands at top speed.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! In an instant, Fuxi unleashed countless palm prints that exploded along with the Eight Diagrams marks—the force they released was nothing short of terrifying. But the Great Sanskrit Light column wasn't damaged in the least.
<br><br>
It had managed to resist every single one of Fuxi's attacks.
<br><br>
"Well..."
<br><br>
Fuxi seemed desperate at this point.
<br><br>
He had always been proud to be the strongest warrior in the chaos. But just now, he utterly failed after pushing himself to his absolute limit. The seemingly weak light column was impenetrable.
<br><br>
This indicated just how great the gap between him and the Grandmaster of Heaven was.
<br><br>
"It's your turn," Fuxi murmured to his real self that was hiding within his body.
<br><br>
Once he requested his real self to release his physical body, his real self had done as promised. After all, the latter was merely an energy soul. It was impossible for it to forcibly occupy Fuxi's physical body.
<br><br>
But Fuxi's own strength was far inferior to that of his real self. He was well aware that it was more suitable for his real self to fight in this sort of battle.
<br><br>
And so Fuxi's real self obtained control over the body once again. "That's the purest light in the Light Region. It's a method that only the purified beings have. The light shouldn't be so strong."
<br><br>
As Fuxi's real self was observing, Herbert rushed up first.
<br><br>
While Gerald and Judson also hated the Grandmaster of Heaven, Herbert was hell-bent on killing him after being previously betrayed by the man.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! A circular, serrated bone plate grew upon Herbert's back. As it spun, several slender bones began extending from it.
<br><br>
The slender bones then extended rapidly. While they looked like Herbert's wings, they didn't extend backward as normal wings did. Instead, they extended forward, forming a great circular space in front of Herbert, entrapping the Grandmaster of Heaven within.
<br><br>
"I have many kinds of cages. The Lawless Cage is merely one of them. This Bone Corroding Cage is my greatest masterpiece!"
<br><br>
Seeing the Grandmaster of Heaven trapped in his cage, Herbert was overjoyed.
<br><br>
The Bone Corroding Cage was a terrifying place of killing. Herbert had always been rather strange, but among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, he boasted about the most profound study of the truth power.
<br><br>
Once the Bone Corroding Cage covered the Grandmaster of Heaven, transparent bone membrane quickly appeared on either side of the bones, transforming the entire cage into an oval sphere.
<br><br>
Soon after, yellow mist rose within the cage—a mist that could corrode all tangible materials. Up until then, all things it had touched corroded in an instant.
<br><br>
And so the yellow mist began intertwining with the white light like water being poured into a boiling pot of oil.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Under the violent reaction, the yellow mist rolled crazily within the cage.
<br><br>
But the light column was slightly shaking—instead of dispersing, it neutralized the yellow mist, forming a layer of harmless black powder at the very bottom of the cage.
<br><br>
"It doesn't work?" Herbert's eyes widened.
<br><br>
While the Bone Corroding Cage couldn't kill the Grandmaster of Heaven, he figured it would do him some damage at the very least.
<br><br>
But the seemingly ordinary light column was indestructible.
<br><br>
"Let me try!"
<br><br>
Judson flew up to the Grandmaster of Heaven's level. A silver spear appeared in his grip as he stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
"Saint Killing Spear!"
<br><br>
It was not merely Judson's theurgy, but also the most powerful material he had ever created.
<br><br>
The moment the spear was thrown out, it turned into ten identical spears, all shifting into streaks of silver light that poured down on the light column.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! With some cracking sounds, the spear broke into pieces.
<br><br>
But Judson had expected the spear to shatter. It wasn't particularly sturdy, after all. It was brittle.
<br><br>
But much to his surprise, the spear failed to even pierce through the light column. His strongest theurgy seemed to be a mere joke before the Grandmaster of Heaven. As a normally aloof and arrogant Chaos Ancient God, he found the fact was hard to face.
<br><br>
In the light column, the Grandmaster of Heaven still held the Cyan Misty Sword. It greedily sucked the white light. This white light formed several flowing light spots on the sword's surface as infinite power gathered within it.
<br><br>
"It's useless. You can't penetrate the power of the foundation," said the Grandmaster of Heaven proudly.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen suddenly appeared beside the light column. He stared at it from nearby and said, "This seems to be the Great Sanskrit Light. I am a purified being as well, but as far as I know, the Great Sanskrit Light works only on creatures of the Dark Region."
<br><br>
"You have no more than a superficial knowledge of light," snorted the other.
<br><br>
It was clear that he didn't take Zen seriously in spite of their shared status.
<br><br>
"Really?" Zen paid no mind to the other's attitude and asked further, "So the power of the foundation you mentioned is also based on the Great Sanskrit Light?"
<br><br>
"Yes... So what?" Realizing that Zen was fishing for information, the Grandmaster of Heaven glared at him.
<br><br>
The latter only smiled faintly. "If you don't want to say it, then forget it. The light column is powerful, but can it block me?"
<br><br>
As he spoke, he reached out, pushing at the column's surface.
<br><br>
While the Grandmaster of Heaven was highly confident in the foundation's power, his heart couldn't help but race in worry as he saw Zen's palm push on it.
<br><br>
'This guy is just too strange… I'm not sure if ...' he thought to himself. When Zen's palm touched the light column, the bloodline in his body began fluctuating chaotically.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline needed to change its very structure each time it restrained the external energy. But this time, the fluctuation was far more violent.
<br><br>
Chapter 3929 Join Hands Theoretically, the four quadrants of the ancestry-level bloodline contained all the abilities.
<br><br>
From the Abstruse Energy World to the secondary worlds, the abilities were always in the range of these four quadrants.
<br><br>
The entire ancestry-level bloodline could restrain any energy perfectly. Zen firmly believed in this even though he couldn't completely control the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
After all, from the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the four origin-level bloodlines below the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and the passageway of the Eternal Scroll Painting to the chaos, this point had already been proven right anywhere.
<br><br>
However, when faced with the Great Sanskrit Light, the ancestry-level bloodline proved ineffective for the first time.
<br><br>
Under the violent fluctuations of the bloodline, Zen did not find any effective restraining ability. Soon after, he felt a storm within his body, and his organs violently trembled in reaction.
<br><br>
Instantly, his arms changed again! The two arms that were covered in white hair began to contract. At the same time, the hair shed and the bones softened. Just as the two arms transformed into pure muscles, round holes appeared on the muscles' surfaces, expanding and eventually turning into suckers.
<br><br>
"Are these octopus tentacles?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, shocked to see how his arms had changed.
<br><br>
Although the transformation caused no pain and was an advantage, Zen still found it terrifying.
<br><br>
Click, click, click...
<br><br>
The two tentacles flailed around as they were completely out of Zen's control. Then, they drooped across the light pillar and began to wiggle.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen's worry and helplessness, the Grandmaster of Heaven sighed in relief.
<br><br>
Initially, when Zen broke the Fishing Drum, the Grandmaster of Heaven was confused profoundly. Not long after, he concluded that Zen must have obtained the ability by chance to restrain the space theurgy.
<br><br>
That was why the triangular world of Othniel and his Fishing Drum couldn't restrain him.
<br><br>
However, just now, he saw with his own eyes that Zen broke the Lawless Cage of Herbert. This had never been done before, so he was bewildered again. Could this mean that Zen's bloodline restrained different energies? If so, why couldn't Zen restrain the Great Sanskrit Light? This relieved the Grandmaster of Heaven. Knowing that an Eternal Realm warrior could not break the power of the foundation brought him a dose of hope.
<br><br>
As long as he was the only one who could obtain the Sanskrit Light Body, he could kill everyone before him. However, he was going to spare Zen because he wanted to study the man's secrets.
<br><br>
Just as the Grandmaster of Heaven was gloating, one of the tentacles of Zen began to suck intensely along the light wall.
<br><br>
"You want to break the light wall in this way?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked with much spite.
<br><br>
Gradually, small black dots appeared on the surface of the pure white light.
<br><br>
These dots expanded and eventually formed small holes.
<br><br>
"This tentacle is absorbing the light wall!" The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes widened.
<br><br>
The protective light wall formed by the Great Sanskrit Light might have seemed ordinary, but little did people know that the method of directly forming the wall with energy was very special.
<br><br>
Because it was so rare, the Grandmaster of Heaven did not anticipate that it could be destroyed.
<br><br>
This left the Grandmaster of Heaven speechless. Then anger rose within him as he hated Zen even more. He thought that Zen would be the biggest threat to the Nihility race if he was not killed at once! On behalf of the Nihility race, the Grandmaster of Heaven saw the Element Spirit Civilization as the race's greatest threat originally.
<br><br>
The thirty-nine elite human warriors that were trapped for so many years could only be considered as trouble. The Grandmaster of Heaven believed that they could be ignored.
<br><br>
Now, the Grandmaster of Heaven saw Zen as a major threat.
<br><br>
"The wall has been broken?"
<br><br>
After the tentacle moved away, Zen finally caught a glimpse of the holes on the light wall.
<br><br>
Because he was over ten million feet tall, the holes were rather small to him when in fact, they were all over one hundred thousand feet wide.
<br><br>
"Since you are in such a hurry to die, I will give you a hand!"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven raged and released the surging killing intent.
<br><br>
Just then, the sword in his hand turned white, and then the color spread throughout his whole body.
<br><br>
Eventually, the Grandmaster of Heaven was covered from head to toe by the white light.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He slashed his sword and aimed for Zen's head. The solid light wall did not stop him from slashing. With one roaring sound, the white sword blade was close enough to swallow Zen.
<br><br>
However, Zen was a smart warrior. He chose to retreat the moment he saw the sword coming down upon him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, because the tentacle was controlled by the ancestry-level bloodline, it was not in sync with all Zen's movements. It continued to suck at the light wall.
<br><br>
As Zen's body backed away sharply, his arm was dragged and extended for millions of feet. It was hit by the white light sword.
<br><br>
Puff! Just like that, the tentacle broke and blood gushed out from the wound.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had its thoughts. While some of the blood splashed out, some also went directly inside the broken arm. The broken tentacle wriggled like a big worm, crawling along the light wall to the other side.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven could not care less about the tentacle. When he saw that Zen retreated, he followed closely behind.
<br><br>
"Where are you going?"
<br><br>
In a moment, the Grandmaster of Heaven launched his second strike.
<br><br>
However, just as the sword was swung, Judson suddenly appeared at the side. He pointed at the blade in the Grandmaster of Heaven's hand and numerous cobwebs quickly appeared.
<br><br>
These webs were extremely thick and layered on top of one another, making it a great obstruction to the Grandmaster of Heaven's attacks.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven attempted to shake the webs off but was unsuccessful. At the same time, the shadow of Snake Goddess quickly descended and merged with the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
If any ordinary Eternal Realm warrior was fused with the shadow of Snake Goddess, they would have been eroded by the energy within it. The shadow of the real Snake Goddess had more power than that of the Snake Goddess in this chaotic era.
<br><br>
However, the Grandmaster of Heaven had transformed into the Sanskrit Light Body, and the shadow of Snake Goddess was completely unable to corrode the white light.
<br><br>
"Tie!"
<br><br>
With no intention to kill the Grandmaster of Heaven, the Snake Goddess tried to temporarily trap him! "The Formless Snake Shackle!"
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Herbert also activated his bloodline power to utilize the shackling method. Four indistinct shadows of snake-shaped shackles appeared on the hands and feet of the Grandmaster of Heaven, coiling around his wrists and ankles.
<br><br>
Fuxi appeared in front of the Grandmaster of Heaven. He lifted his arm and launched a palm strike at the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
What seemed like an ordinary palm strike vibrated for over ten thousand times as it came into contact with the chest of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Break the body!"
<br><br>
Fuxi's goal was not to kill the Grandmaster of Heaven but to weaken his defense of his Sanskrit Light Body as much as possible.
<br><br>
Next, Gerald appeared. He waved his tail and stabbed right at the center of the Grandmaster of Heaven's chest, exactly where Fuxi's palm hit.
<br><br>
Gerald's strikes were so powerful that even Claire had been killed in his hands by the Poison of Decomposition. If the Grandmaster of Heaven was pierced deeply enough, he would die the same way Claire did.
<br><br>
Chapter 3930 Press More than half of Gerald's bright-colored tail needle was impaled into the Sanskrit Light Body of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The tail needle was about three hundred thousand feet long, and about twothirds of the total length was drilled deep into the body.
<br><br>
Ideally, it was already enough to break the Sanskrit Light Body.
<br><br>
"Nice work, Gerald!"
<br><br>
"There's no way he could resist the Poison of Decomposition!"
<br><br>
"Finish him!"
<br><br>
Everyone yelled and was full of expectations.
<br><br>
Technically, the Poison of Decomposition was not a poison, but a kind of energy that could destroy things at a molecular level. Supposedly, no one had a good way to withstand it.
<br><br>
Just when everyone thought that they had finally succeeded, the expression on Gerald's face gradually changed. "What is this? There is no—"
<br><br>
"Physical body?" the Grandmaster of Heaven sneered as he finished Gerald's sentence.
<br><br>
Everyone clearly witnessed how Gerald's needle pierced into the Sanskrit Light Body of the Grandmaster of Heaven. However, the body was empty.
<br><br>
It turned out that it was not a real physical body.
<br><br>
"So what? That doesn't matter!" Gerald retorted, trying to still sound confident.
<br><br>
The Poison of Decomposition was supposed to destroy everything, including energies and souls. That was why Gerald was still confident that they could take the Grandmaster of Heaven down.
<br><br>
Soon, a black mass leaked at the place where the needle stabbed the body.
<br><br>
Like a thick dripping ink, it began to diffuse but soon stopped.
<br><br>
In just a matter of seconds, the all-conquering Poison of Decomposition was subdued and lost its effect.
<br><br>
"Are you done with your childish games?!"
<br><br>
the Grandmaster of Heaven shouted contemptuously.
<br><br>
Then, at his bidding, his long sword emerged, shrouded in pure bright lights.
<br><br>
He waved his sword and a white sword arc instantly appeared in the void.
<br><br>
The sword arc was lashing in the air at such an incredible speed.
<br><br>
Upon seeing this, Gerald quickly pulled his tail and retrieved it from the body of the Grandmaster of Heaven. However, there was not enough time.
<br><br>
Splat! Gerald's tail was slashed, and a stream of green blood gushed out immediately.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven raised his sword and aimed at Gerald again.
<br><br>
The sharp lights coming from it seemed to be able to illuminate the entire chaos.
<br><br>
This time, as the Grandmaster of Heaven threw his second strike, Gerald's reaction was quicker. He was able to use the Grand Teleportation in order to avoid the incoming attack.
<br><br>
"Humph! What an annoying insect!"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was going all out. He intended to do anything and release everything in his arsenal just to bring down all his opponents.
<br><br>
With that, he prepared his next set of attacks.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the space around him solidified. He dragged the white shadows of light and instantly appeared in front of Fuxi.
<br><br>
"Die! Weaklings!"
<br><br>
Fuxi was caught off guard. The white arc of light quickly rushed towards his head.
<br><br>
"So fast! I won't make it!"
<br><br>
His body froze for a few seconds before it could react.
<br><br>
Compared to the Grandmaster of Heaven's lightning speed, everyone else seemed to move so slow.
<br><br>
Realizing that he couldn't dodge the sword strike, Fuxi turned his body around and sacrificed his legs.
<br><br>
Splat! Fuxi's legs were immediately cut clean and blood spurted out.
<br><br>
There was no sign that the Grandmaster of Heaven was stopping. He quickly launched another sword strike, with the intent of finishing Fuxi off this time.
<br><br>
"Not on my watch! Myriad Heavy Water!"
<br><br>
Judson outflanked the Grandmaster of Heaven. With a clap of his hands, a drop of water suddenly appeared.
<br><br>
The droplet of water instantly expanded to a size large enough to envelop the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Now! Condense!"
<br><br>
The water might look just like an ordinary one, but it was extremely dense.
<br><br>
As the Grandmaster of Heaven was sealed in it, his movements were immediately restrained. Only then did Fuxi have the chance to escape from the sword strike.
<br><br>
Then, Gerald quickly approached Fuxi. He stretched out a pincer and gently patted it on Fuxi's wounds. Two dark green forces of truth were injected into the wounds at once, making his broken legs begin regenerating.
<br><br>
However, the Myriad Heavy Water was only able to seal the Grandmaster of Heaven for a few seconds. After a while, the Grandmaster of Heaven's body suddenly trembled, and the Myriad Heavy Water instantly broke apart, splashing in all directions.
<br><br>
Just when the Grandmaster of Heaven was about to continue chasing Fuxi, several spores, the size of a fist, suddenly appeared on the surface of his Sanskrit Light Body. The spores quickly latched to his body. The roots wrapped around him and so were the vines that sprouted.
<br><br>
Apparently, before Judson launched the Myriad Heavy Water, Gerald had discreetly stuffed the spores into it. When the Grandmaster of Heaven was enveloped by the Myriad Heavy Water, the spores quickly attached to his body.
<br><br>
The thick golden vines were extremely tough. Even the Grandmaster of Heaven struggled hard before he was able to break some of them. However, more and more vines wrapped around him.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven admitted that these Chaos Ancient Gods and Eternal Realm masters were formidable. Even if he was omnipotent, he was still hindered by their tenacious skills and methods.
<br><br>
"We're not done! Slaughter Prison!"
<br><br>
Herbert, who was now on the side of the Pear Hill, activated his other theurgy. In a flash, six lightning-like columns began to take shape around the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
However, just before the Slaughter Prison was about to be completed, a snow-white hand reached out from within the golden vines, and a finger pointed at Herbert.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a light emerged in front of Herbert.
<br><br>
He was so busy activating his bloodline power to set up the Slaughter Prison that he didn't notice the light. Suddenly, the light expanded, and that was the only time that Herbert noted it.
<br><br>
However, it was too late when Herbert noticed it.
<br><br>
The white light instantly formed a sturdy space that trapped Herbert within.
<br><br>
Herbert realized that his life was in great danger. He did all he could in order to break the light column.
<br><br>
However, the light column was so indestructible that even the ancestry-level bloodline was not able to destroy it. Previously, it had to produce tentacles to absorb the column bit by bit. So Herbert, who only used brute force to break it, didn't make it budge even a little.
<br><br>
Crash! Suddenly, an unusual noise resounded from within the light column.
<br><br>
Herbert's movements were stopped as if there was an extremely powerful force that was pressing on his body.
<br><br>
The downward pressure in the light column continued to grow stronger and stronger, crushing Herbert's body little by little.
<br><br>
After a short while, Herbert's body was tightly pressed at the bottom of the light column.
<br><br>
Crash! Crack! Herbert's bones began to break and his body was starting to collapse.
<br><br>
The pressure continued to increase. Everyone just stood there, watching his agony as they also couldn't do anything about the light column. At this point, Herbert couldn't even struggle or make a sound anymore. His eyes revealed a look of total helplessness and misery.
<br><br>
Splat! Hebert's entire body exploded and was completely crushed.
<br><br>
His huge body, which was millions of feet tall, was reduced into a puddle of blood. Everyone couldn't believe that a dignified Chaos Ancient God could die in this miserable way.
<br><br>
Gerald, Judson, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess didn't avert their eyes from the scene. Instead, their faces darkened and their eyes were filled with rage.
<br><br>
At this time, the Grandmaster of Heaven had finally removed all the golden vines that were wrapped on his body. There was a smirk on his face, yet an extreme murderous intent was oozing from his eyes.
<br><br>
He was getting impatient because his real enemy wasn't there. Originally, he did not intend to use too much of his foundation power, but these people gave him a hard time. With that, he decided to handle them using a fiercer method.
<br><br>
"Are you mad? Well, you ask for it! Now, I'll kill you one by one!"
<br><br>
Gerald became instantly aware when the Grandmaster of Heaven pointed at his direction. He knew immediately that something bad was about to happen. He quickly tried to flee, but the light column was already forming before he could even move from his position.
<br><br>
"You're the next one to die," the Grandmaster of Heaven said coldly.
<br><br>
Then, the pressure inside the light column suddenly increased. Instantly, Gerald's body was pressed at the bottom.
<br><br>
Chapter 3931 Pressing Forward The miserable death which Herbert had suffered was still lingering on everyone's mind. Trapped and unable to escape, Gerald was obviously about to end up the same.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and Judson were becoming anxious now.
<br><br>
"Come on! Let's destroy this light column!"
<br><br>
"How? It's not going to be so easy to destroy it."
<br><br>
"We have to try! I'm afraid that Gerald won't be able to hold on for any more than thirty seconds."
<br><br>
Although they knew that the light column was almost completely invulnerable, they still had to try. Therefore, they launched their attacks in unison, trying to destroy the light column that had trapped Gerald.
<br><br>
Even under their attacks, the pressure in the light column increased sharply, and the hard shell on the surface of Gerald's body began to emit cracking sounds. Countless cracks spread out, like lines of minuscule bugs crawling over his body.
<br><br>
Gerald himself also knew how powerful the light column was. Trapped inside, he had to try and make an effort to save himself since no one else could do so.
<br><br>
Buzz! A green colored light began to leak out from the cracks.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven felt the strong life energy that was contained within the light column with a look of contempt on his face.
<br><br>
Gerald was a Chaos Ancient God who had mastered the truth of life.
<br><br>
However, it was impossible for him to use that power to repair his body.
<br><br>
"Huh! Don't try to struggle. It is useless,"
<br><br>
the Grandmaster of Heaven sneered. And as soon as his words finished, the squeezing force in the light column doubled suddenly.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! With a wispy, cracking sound, Gerald's shell was suddenly broken completely. Under the irresistible pressure, the tissues in his body began to bleed profusely, and his huge and fragile compound eyes exploded outside.
<br><br>
However, the truth power surrounding him did not try to repair his body. It could not. Instead, it was transforming his body.
<br><br>
The truth was, even if it did try, it was useless to repair the broken shell.
<br><br>
The shell was just a broken defense mechanism. It was not suitable for such a high pressure environment.
<br><br>
The truth power was instead growing a thin layer of tissue over the hard shell. The tissue was flat and weirdly thin, as if it were made of countless pieces of paper.
<br><br>
This was the only visible change on the surface of Gerald's body. At the same time, several more changes were taking place inside him.
<br><br>
The squeezed body tissue was quickly being transformed by the truth power. Gerald's height was being reduced constantly. Finally, he became completely flat. In fact, that was what he wanted to do.
<br><br>
In a short while, the originally scorpion shaped Gerald had turned into a thin pie.
<br><br>
This was a highly powerful move. Some fishes in the deep sea had to bear intense sea water pressure all year round, which had evolved their bodies into flat shapes. However, they needed millions of years to evolve, but Gerald had done this in an instant.
<br><br>
A green light flickered on the side of his flat body, and a pair of slender eyes grew to observe everything around him.
<br><br>
"What the hell?"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was confused now.
<br><br>
Herbert had also been crushed into a meat pie just now, and therefore the Grandmaster of Heaven hadn't paid much attention to the change in Gerald's body. But the strong life energy that had leaked out could not repair Gerald's body, which had surprised him a bit.
<br><br>
Maybe the repair speed was not as fast as the squeezing speed. Therefore, he had not thought much about it. And yet, after a few seconds, Gerald still had a lot of life energy left and there wasn't much damage to him.
<br><br>
When the Grandmaster of Heaven realized what had happened, he sneered, "Your desire to survive is strong. In this form, your pressure bearing ability has increased by at least six times. But that is still in vain!"
<br><br>
Once he had finished speaking, his palm emitted a strong white light.
<br><br>
From the way he was utilizing his strength, the power of the foundation seemed to be inexhaustible. The squeezing force in the light column continued to increase even now.
<br><br>
"Goo Goo..."
<br><br>
Still being squeezed continuously, Gerald's body became more and more flat, and his slender eyes revealed a sad expression. Since the pressure was explosively increasing even now, it was going to be difficult for him to resist for too long.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Outside the light column, Judson, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were still attacking it with all kinds of methods and moves, but the outer wall of the light column was still totally intact.
<br><br>
"Where is Zen?"
<br><br>
Judson cried among the battle. He was placing his hope on Zen.
<br><br>
Just now, after Zen had dodged the sword strike of the Grandmaster of Heaven, he seemed to have disappeared.
<br><br>
Even Judson didn't know his whereabouts since he had the power to teleport himself anywhere and everywhere without a trace.
<br><br>
At Judson's words, a thin thread suddenly appeared in the void. And out of nowhere, Zen appeared.
<br><br>
And when he was finally visible, they saw that his entire body had changed greatly.
<br><br>
In addition to the terrifying and strange head he had already developed, his limbs had turned into over a hundred tentacles, which were covered with over ten thousand circular suckers.
<br><br>
Now, Zen no longer resembled a human from any angle. Instead, he looked like an octopus.
<br><br>
The moment he appeared, he placed his limbs on the light column, and the suckers began absorbing the Great Sanskrit Light without a moment's hesitation.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Black patches quickly appeared on the surface of the originally indestructible light column. As the light column became more and more fragile through Zen's sucking, Zen pulled at it hard.
<br><br>
Splash! The light column suddenly collapsed like a large structure made of water, and the pressure inside was instantly released. Gerald's pie-like body fell down rapidly like a heavy hammer.
<br><br>
After escaping death, Gerald regained his life energy once again. His body tissue, outer defensive shell, and even his tail, which had disappeared, recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at the octopus-like Zen with a cold expression in his eyes.
<br><br>
Previously, it had taken Zen a long time to break the light column, but now, he was powerful enough to easily break the column. This was after he had disappeared for just a little while.
<br><br>
Such a speed of growth in strength was unimaginable. Zen was omnipotent now! An opponent with power of this magnitude was going to be extremely tricky to deal with.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Dragging over a hundred tentacles around him, Zen suddenly disappeared once more, turning into a thin line and rushing towards the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven felt threatened at this sight. If he were to be trapped by Zen's tentacles, his Sanskrit Light Body would be absorbed soon and he would be dead.
<br><br>
As he retreated rapidly, a blue light flashed in his eyes. Once he had located Zen, he reached out his hand and grabbed at something in the air. With a buzzing sound, a light column materialized and covered Zen.
<br><br>
As Zen's tentacles absorbed the wall of the light column for a while, the wall was broken down once again. The light column was able to hinder Zen for just a single second.
<br><br>
However, the Grandmaster of Heaven didn't have any other way to deal with Zen as of now. Therefore, as soon as the light column was broken, he summoned yet another one. The light columns kept on materializing one after another and this bought him some time.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Splash! All the light columns were broken by Zen.
<br><br>
If one observed carefully, the suckers on his tentacles were subtly changing shape during the whole process.
<br><br>
In the beginning, the suckers had been circular, but now they had slowly evolved into a diamond-shaped structure. That way, they could absorb the Great Sanskrit Light much more efficiently. The speed at which they could break the light columns was increasing with every strike, which left the Grandmaster of Heaven flabbergasted.
<br><br>
Gerald, who was quickly repairing his body, along with Judson, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess quietly watched the scene unfold before their eyes, without any intention of interfering. They knew their presence wouldn't make much of a difference in this battle.
<br><br>
What confused the Grandmaster of Heaven was that after breaking the light columns, Zen could have just moved forward to attack him. If he were caught by Zen's tentacles, he would definitely die.
<br><br>
However, Zen was pressing forward very slowly. What was he up to? While the Grandmaster of Heaven was lost in thought and trying to understand what was going on, a thin line was floating in the void behind him.
<br><br>
When he finally approached the thin line unwittingly, a mass of tentacles appeared out of nowhere and swallowed him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3932 My Will These particular tentacles came from the one that had been cut off by the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline refused to be divided, and even the ones that were divided were very eager to return.
<br><br>
However, just this one time, the ancestry-level bloodline allowed this individual to stay apart, hide in space, and continue to reproduce on its own.
<br><br>
As Zen broke the light columns one after another, the hidden tentacles gained his experience, and the suckers on their surfaces began adjusting.
<br><br>
Just when the Grandmaster of Heaven, who had transformed into the Sanskrit Light Body, was close enough to the tentacles, they attempted to swallow him whole in one gulp. They were like a greedy serpent that wanted to devour its prey in one go.
<br><br>
The suckers of the tentacles aggressively absorbed the Great Sanskrit Light while he was desperately struggling.
<br><br>
Splat! The Grandmaster of Heaven managed to thrust his white sword into many tentacles. The sword pierced so deep that only half of the blade remained exposed.
<br><br>
However, the lower half of the sword quickly turned black and was completely corroded. In an instant, the sword broke, and the exposed half was sucked into the tentacles.
<br><br>
On the surface of the Grandmaster of Heaven's body, there were hundreds of visible black dots.
<br><br>
From there, the power of the foundation was gradually absorbed, and his strength grew weaker and weaker.
<br><br>
In the beginning, he could still tear the tentacles at will, but as time passed by, he lost his strength to resist against them. His entire body was now wrapped around by the tentacles, and the Great Sanskrit Light contained within his body was being extinguished rapidly.
<br><br>
However, the Grandmaster of Heaven was still showing tenacity and was unwilling to give up. He gathered all his remaining strength and rushed forward in an attempt to break free. When he realized that there was no chance to escape, he desperately stretched out his hand until a finger was exposed outside of the tentacles.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A ray of light shot from his fingertip just before his body was completely devoured by the tentacles.
<br><br>
Then, the light from the Grandmaster of Heaven's finger condensed in the sky and transformed into his appearance.
<br><br>
However, the avatar formed was so dim, like the light from a candle that was about to die. His body was almost transparent, and the energy in his body was so weak that it was almost negligible.
<br><br>
Zen didn't bother to kill the avatar because he knew that he would also disintegrate in no time. So, he just took the opportunity and asked, "Is this the power of the foundation?"
<br><br>
"Yes," the avatar replied. He stared at Zen with a complicated expression in his eyes.
<br><br>
At the back of his mind, he had never thought that he would be defeated. He even used the power of the foundation to its fullest.
<br><br>
"I see. It's very weak then," Zen remarked as he shrugged his shoulders.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, the Grandmaster of Heaven was rendered speechless. He just stood frozen, and he had the expression on his face that wanted to confirm if he heard Zen's statement correctly.
<br><br>
Even the real Fuxi and his avatar that was hiding in his body were also shocked. They couldn't help but smirk, thinking that this guy was actually more arrogant than them.
<br><br>
"What did you just say? You called the power of the foundation weak?!"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven, who had been depressed, was suddenly filled with rage. Consequently, the rate at which his body dissipated also increased.
<br><br>
"Yeah, did you not hear that clearly? Your power is weak. That's why you're going to die now," Zen said as he let out a faint smirk.
<br><br>
"What? Ha-ha! You've got guts, huh?" The Grandmaster of Heaven laughed so hard as if he had heard the funniest joke in his life. "I expect you to go to the Three Purities Stage one day. Let's meet again. I will wait for you there."
<br><br>
The voice of the Grandmaster of Heaven became softer and softer until it was inaudible. Soon after, his entire body completely vanished.
<br><br>
As Zen stared in the void for a while, he suddenly remembered something when he sensed several intermittent space fluctuations in the distance.
<br><br>
"Wow, they run so fast," Zen said as he shook his head.
<br><br>
After the Grandmaster of Heaven activated his Sanskrit Light Body, not one member of the Black Ship joined the fray.
<br><br>
Perhaps, the Grandmaster of Heaven and the Black Ship had communicated secretly that they needed to flee as soon as they saw that he was at a disadvantage.
<br><br>
In the battle earlier, the Eternal Realm masters and the Chaos Ancient Gods focused all their attention on the Grandmaster of Heaven. They didn't expect that the Black Ship would use that opportunity to escape.
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship knew that no one pursued them, but they were still in distress.
<br><br>
Although no one could see the captain's expression, everyone felt his gloomy and miserable aura.
<br><br>
"Zen could actually destroy the Grandmaster of Heaven's Sanskrit Light Body. His strength cannot be underestimated anymore,"
<br><br>
the captain uttered to himself.
<br><br>
Not long ago, the captain had only treated Zen as his junior.
<br><br>
But in just a short time, Zen was able to surpass and even kill the person that he looked up to.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was the leader of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he was known for his outstanding strength on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"What are you talking about? That's not even his own power," Shera said, shaking her head as if unwilling to accept the fact that the Grandmaster of Heaven fell in the hands of Zen.
<br><br>
"Even so, it's a power that he can use. What difference does that make?" the captain answered.
<br><br>
"The Grandmaster of Heaven must have been too careless. He didn't expect that Zen would be that strong," said a member of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
The way that Zen's strange body continuously adapted and evolved was way beyond the imagination of people with ordinary bloodlines. Even for Eternal Realm warriors, that kind of strength was unconventional.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
As most of the members of the Black Ship were feeling depressed, the Evil God burst out laughing.
<br><br>
Shera quickly turned around and gave him a sharp gaze. "What are you laughing at?"
<br><br>
Then, the corners of the Evil God's mouth curled up. "It's so simple. The Grandmaster of Heaven is weaker than Zen. Why are you still justifying him? It's ridiculous!"
<br><br>
Crash! As soon as the Evil God finished speaking, he suddenly felt a fist smashing on his face.
<br><br>
The Evil God instantly flew and crashed on the deck of the Black Ship. A huge hole was created where he landed.
<br><br>
It was the brass man who punched him. His fist remained clenched, and the cold look in his eyes could turn water into ice.
<br><br>
Actually, if he didn't make the move, other people on the Black Ship would have taken the initiative. The look in their eyes was clearly screaming that no one could speak ill of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Evil God slowly crawled out of the hole, still wearing a smug look on his face. "What? Did I say something wrong? Ha-ha! Why would you even defend the reputation of someone who failed because of his weakness?" He wasn't apologetic at all.
<br><br>
As the brass man heard his impious laughter, his rage started contorting his face.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! His heavy body ran wildly on the deck and rushed towards the Evil God.
<br><br>
Holes and cracks were appearing as he passed by the deck.
<br><br>
The Evil God's laughter became more intense just before the brass man approached him.
<br><br>
The other members of the Black Ship were also hopeful that the brass man would shut the Evil God's mouth, and teach him a lesson. However, their hearts began throbbing when the Evil God shouted, "Kneel!"
<br><br>
Swoosh! A strong will instantly descended from above.
<br><br>
It wasn't just any ordinary will. Its power was beyond words.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! Under the excessive pressure of the surging will, the aggressive brass man froze and knelt before the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Evil God! Do you have a death wish?"
<br><br>
"Dare to make one false move, and we'll be sure that you regret it!"
<br><br>
"Don't be an idiot!"
<br><br>
As soon as the members of the Black Ship saw that the brass man was being utterly humiliated, they started yelling with angry faces. With just a single order from their captain, they were ready to take the Evil God down.
<br><br>
However, the captain stayed silent and looked up.
<br><br>
From where he stood, he could see the enormous outer wall of the Source World above them, from where the tremendous will had just come.
<br><br>
"Tell me, is that the will of the Source World?" the captain asked straightforwardly.
<br><br>
"No," the Evil God replied with a confident sneer. "It's my will."
<br><br>
 Chapter 3933 The New Captain The Evil God had tried to communicate with the Source World all this time.
<br><br>
He could faintly sense the will of the Source World, but was unable to grasp it.
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship did not participate in the battle with the Pear Hill. The Evil God had studied his own abilities all the time.
<br><br>
The opportunity had appeared after he had left the Source World. The will of the Source World, which had once tried to dodge the Evil God, seemed to want him to stay in the Source World.
<br><br>
If the Source World were considered a living being or a person, it wouldn't want its own evil will to leave. This was because Usman had originally been a part of the Source World and the Evil God had devoured him.
<br><br>
The Evil God had also been a part of Zen before and Zen had had to think twice before letting the Evil God leave.
<br><br>
When the Grandmaster of Heaven had fought the people of the Pear Hill outside the Source World, the Evil God seized this opportunity and quickly connected with the Source World.
<br><br>
The Evil God felt that the Source World was a vast and powerful will. He saw it as a living being, born with the birth of one round of chaos.
<br><br>
When the Evil God's consciousness had merged with this vast will, he was like a tiger that had broken into a flock of sheep.
<br><br>
There were millions and millions of sheep, but they were no match for the tiger.
<br><br>
It was easy for the Evil God to pollute the will of the entire Source World and become its ruler.
<br><br>
"How did you make it?" the captain of the Black Ship asked.
<br><br>
Usman had lived for a longer time and had been stronger than the Evil God at the time. However, he hadn't been able to fuse with the will of the Source World.
<br><br>
The Black Ship had allowed the Evil God to merge with Usman, because they wanted him to replace Usman and control the Source World.
<br><br>
This thought was, however, impractical. Some of the key steps were like mysteries that could not be solved. They needed the Nihility race to join hands with the Black Ship in order to slowly explore them.
<br><br>
Everyone knew that it was impossible to achieve overnight. But the Evil God had completed the task pretty easily, after having devoured Usman a few days ago.
<br><br>
"This is not the tone you should be talking to me in," the Evil God said rather arrogantly.
<br><br>
He stood up a little taller, while the captain looked minuscule before him.
<br><br>
His condescending manner angered all the members of the Black Ship, including Shera.
<br><br>
"You brat! What kind of a tone do you think we should use?" the brass man shouted, trembling as he struggled to stand up. The deck under his feet creaked. It was not easy to resist the pressure of the Source World's will.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..." The Evil God merely sneered contemptuously.
<br><br>
Boom! The deck under the brass man's feet broke and he was pressed into the ship's cabin.
<br><br>
Nobody could tolerate the Evil God, seeing as he was bullying others so ruthlessly. Even Shera's eyes glimmered dangerously.
<br><br>
When all of them took out the Other Shore Tokens, the captain raised one hand, making a gesture to stop them. He then bowed to the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Captain!"
<br><br>
"What are you doing, Captain?"
<br><br>
"This guy is so ungrateful!"
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship exploded in indignation as they watched the captain they had admired and respected bow to the Evil God.
<br><br>
The captain said, "The reason why the Nihility race supports our Black Ship is because they want to have a stronger power in the chaos. And it looks like we haven't done a good job."
<br><br>
The battle between the Finale Way and the Purge Way was a combat among the Chaos Ancient Gods. The Black Ship could only let the Grandmaster of Heaven join the fight. The members of the Black Ship, led by the captain, weren't even qualified to watch.
<br><br>
"The Black Ship should be led by someone who is immensely powerful.
<br><br>
From now on, I am no longer the captain of the Black Ship. He is the new captain," the captain said to the members of the Black Ship as he bowed once again to the Evil God. "I will pass this decision to the Grandmaster of Heaven. Are you satisfied?"
<br><br>
The captain's decision to abdicate pushed the members of the Black Ship into a deeper shock than they could have imagined.
<br><br>
The captain had never changed ever since the Black Ship was born.
<br><br>
"Captain, please don't!"
<br><br>
"Captain, how can you let this man rule the Black Ship?"
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship had never trusted the Evil God.
<br><br>
Apart from Shera, most of them disliked the Evil God. They were on guard against him because of what had happened to Usman.
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship might not be willing to obey the Evil God if he became the captain.
<br><br>
The captain turned a deaf ear to the complaints. He merely stared at the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Okay," Evil God said, shrugging, and then turned around to enter the cabin. Before he went in, he turned around and said, "When the Grandmaster of Heaven is revived, ask him to see me as soon as possible."
<br><br>
Saying thus, the Evil God got into the cabin, leaving a wave of fierce wrath roiling among the members.
<br><br>
The brass man, who had climbed up from the bottom of the cabin, asked, his eyes red, "Why would you do something like this, Captain?"
<br><br>
"Even if you let him fulfill his wish, he won't be on our side!" another member said.
<br><br>
"It's my fault, letting him join the Black Ship!" Shera said bitterly, her eyes pained. It looked like she had brought trouble to the Black Ship.
<br><br>
After all the members had vented their anger, the captain said slowly, "Are you all done?"
<br><br>
The members stared at the captain. They had nothing to say but to denounce the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Both the Evil God and Usman, as the incarnation of the evil will, are destined not to submit to anyone," the captain said, his gaze fixed on the brass man. "Usman, Evil God, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and I are very clear about this."
<br><br>
"Then why did you still cultivate him? Why do you let him act so willfully?" the brass man asked, confused.
<br><br>
The captain smiled and replied, "Remember the mission of our Black Ship.
<br><br>
Our goal is not to create or survive, but to destroy."
<br><br>
The Nihility race didn't care whether or not the Evil God was loyal. As an incarnation of the evil will, he was born for destruction.
<br><br>
This destruction came from his evil nature, which was different from the reasons behind the Nihility Way, but they had the same goal and that was enough.
<br><br>
The captain then went back to his cabin, leaving the members standing on the deck.
<br><br>
A crack passed through the Taoism Province. It was hundreds of millions of miles long and looked dangerous. The fatal chaotic energy had already deadened the Taoism Province.
<br><br>
The boundary wall between the Taoism Province and the Pear Hill was damaged. A crack, hundreds of feet wide, now decorated the boundary wall, chaotic energy spreading slowly through it. All the creatures in a radius of dozens of miles around the crack had retreated to safety.
<br><br>
This was quickly reported. Before the chaotic energy spread out completely, a mountain leader appeared, carrying a mountain, and placed it into the crack in the boundary wall.
<br><br>
This was only temporary. The Pear Hill would find a way to repair the wall in the future.
<br><br>
While the Pear Hill was coping with the aftermath of the disaster, Zen, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the two Chaos Ancient Gods finally returned safely.
<br><br>
When these huge masters appeared in the Pear Hill, it caused great excitement and cheer among the people there.
<br><br>
They had won the final victory in the eyes of the members and disciples of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
But Zen, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess knew that this war was only the beginning. The real test was still ahead and it was going to be anything but easy.
<br><br>
Chapter 3934 Restored The battle of the Pear Hill had shocked the Source World.
<br><br>
There was an old belief that the Other Shore always had an impact on the chaos. For instance, both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race supported some powerful races in the chaos.
<br><br>
However, their strategies were always subtle. The power of the Other Shore had never been directly exerted on the chaos.
<br><br>
The chaos had always been governed by the lucky Chaos Ancient Gods and the ruling forces.
<br><br>
But this time, the tables had turned—the rules had undergone a fundamental change.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven of the Nihility race had personally descended into the chaos, and Claire of the Element Spirit Civilization had also participated in the battle. They were existences that could not only defeat but also put the Chaos Ancient Gods to their death.
<br><br>
The insurmountable wall between the Other Shore and the chaos had been torn down! Warriors at the Eternal Realm of superpowers and the top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos had once been considered powerhouses for dominating a part in the chaos. However, when compared to the powerful warriors of the Other Shore, they were no match. They had inferior strength incomparable to theirs.
<br><br>
The attitude of some super forces such as the Separate Abyss race had always been ambiguous. They would not choose side until one of the Purge Way and the Finale Way clearly gained the upper hand.
<br><br>
In the battle of the Pear Hill, Claire was defeated and the Chaos Ancient Gods, Herbert, and Lamont had unfortunately died. The Bearing race, which appeared to be extremely powerful, faced a crushing failure. The Pear Hill destroyed the two Chaos Ancient Gods, and on top of that, they had killed the Grandmaster of Heaven behind the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Many of the ruling civilizations reacted quickly even as they were still in a state of shock...
<br><br>
These Eternal Realm warriors were only opportunists, but as the main force that supported the Finale Way, the Pear Hill had to fight against the joined forces of the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race. There was no point in refusing these super forces that willingly crossed over to their side.
<br><br>
It was unrealistic to expect these forces to help them fight against the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization, yet it was enough that they would not fight the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Not long after Zen and the others returned to the Pear Hill, Kendrick also arrived.
<br><br>
He was the third Chaos Ancient God that supported the Finale Way. He was a creature that resembled a black turtle; his movements were considered slowest among the six Chaos Ancient Gods. When he had finally reached the chaos, the war had already ended.
<br><br>
Among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, Othniel mastered the truth about space, Gerald the truth about life, Herbert the truth about confinement, Lamont the truth about temperature, and Judson the truth about creation.
<br><br>
The truth that Kendrick, the last one of them, grasped was defense.
<br><br>
Compared to the first five Chaos Ancient Gods, Kendrick's attacking power was not too strong, but his defending power was extraordinary among them.
<br><br>
After Kendrick descended to the Pear Hill, he directly entered its inner space. His entire body integrated with the Pear Hill, forming the strongest defensive line for it...
<br><br>
All over the Pear Hill, from the Snake Goddess to the mountain leaders, the common members, and the disciples, all proceeded to work, busying themselves in building up the defense.
<br><br>
No one knew when the next war would break out. They didn't want to be taken by surprise, or be caught unprepared. They could only try their best to contribute to strengthening the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
After returning to the Pear Hill, Zen didn't go to see Yan and his family immediately. Instead, he chose to stay secluded.
<br><br>
He glanced at a mirror only to be terrified at the sight. The ancestry-level bloodline had transformed his body, almost turning him into a hideous monster.
<br><br>
Tentacles had grown all over his body and his head was unimaginably horrible. Anyone who faced such a monster would certainly be frightened. 'I have to return to my original appearance, ' he urged himself.
<br><br>
On the Dark Haze Peak, there was also a young man dressed in cotton robe, together with Zen. This young man was No. 9527 who had just obtained its freedom.
<br><br>
However, Gerald was someone who would never set a soul fragment free.
<br><br>
Normally, a soul fragment like No. 9527 who had formed the consciousness of its own would be retrieved by Gerald himself. But this time, he made an exception. He not only allowed No. 9527 to leave freely but also created a human body for it.
<br><br>
For No. 9527, the only person in this world it had a connection with was Zen. Naturally, it chose to follow Zen.
<br><br>
"You look mighty with your new look," No. 9527 said with a smile. "And in this form, your strength should be more powerful," he presumed.
<br><br>
"That's true, but this appearance makes me no longer a human..." Zen answered, shaking his head.
<br><br>
The tentacles on his body could not only absorb the Great Sanskrit Light, but they were also capable of acquiring other energy.
<br><br>
If the Snake Goddess fought with Zen now, it wouldn't even take a second round for Zen to completely absorb the shadow of Snake Goddess. Just one round would be enough.
<br><br>
As No. 9527 said, the combat strength he had in this form appeared to surpass that of his original form… "It doesn't matter whether you are a human or not," No. 9527 replied.
<br><br>
As a soul fragment of Gerald, No. 9527 had a unique perspective of life.
<br><br>
In his opinion, it was not important to maintain the human form.
<br><br>
"Then why did you take that human form?" asked Zen with a smile.
<br><br>
No. 9527 was stunned upon hearing his question.
<br><br>
After staying with Zen for a long time, No. 9527 began to better understand the human race. Moreover, he wanted to follow Zen, so he was naturally willing to have a human form.
<br><br>
Zen said no more and once again tried to communicate with the ancestrylevel bloodline.
<br><br>
It was certain that the ancestry-level bloodline already had its consciousness, but Zen was unable to tell the level of this consciousness it had reached.
<br><br>
Did it rely on its instinct to act, or did it have a mind of its own? There was a huge difference between the two… Zen continued to try to communicate with it. His constant persistence from morning until evening had worked; the ancestry-level bloodline finally responded and spared Zen.
<br><br>
Two days later, there was a transformation in Zen's physical body.
<br><br>
The tentacles on his body quickly degenerated–his old body and limbs grew out again, forming his normal state.
<br><br>
Seeing that there was a thin net draped on the surface of his body, Zen could only smile bitterly. The ancestry-level bloodline had memories, and it was still afraid that Zen would let out the blood. That was why it left the net on his body.
<br><br>
Now that his physical body had been restored, Zen was relieved.
<br><br>
After he sent the news to the Snake Goddess, she immediately told him that someone wanted to see him.
<br><br>
Zen rushed over and was surprised to see that there were already over three hundred people gathered in the hall. Sally and Hutton were among them. He squinted his eyes and recognized the old man in the lead–it was Ambrose! Sally, Hutton, and several others of the Nine Li race had followed Zen and stayed in the Flow Sword Sect. The Oneness Sky Palace had moved to the west, and they also entered the Pear Hill with the disciples of the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
"Grandpa Amborse!" Zen's eyes lit up with excitement as he approached.
<br><br>
Ambrose nodded at Zen with a relieved smile on his wrinkled face. Beside Ambrose, a skinny middle-aged man stared at Zen with tearful eyes. "I didn't expect that our Nine Li race would have a chance and that such a character belonged to us..."
<br><br>
Hearing what this person said, Zen looked at him from head to toe. This person's aura was extraordinary and he was at the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
Zen looked at Ambrose with confused eyes, as if asking who the unfamiliar man was. Ambrose cleared his throat and introduced, "This is Tucker, the little brother of Grand Chieftain and I. He is the only powerful warrior that remained in the Nine Li race..."
<br><br>
Among the nine chiefs, Tucker Li was the only warrior at the Holy Soul Realm that had survived.
<br><br>
There were several branches of the remaining members of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
The group led by Tucker Li and the one led by Ambrose didn't know about each other's existence. Not long ago, Tucker Li finally found this other branch.
<br><br>
After knowing what had happened in the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill, Tucker Li decisively rushed to the Pear Hill with all the remaining members from his group.
<br><br>
Chapter 3935 The Passage At The End "Grandpa Tucker," Zen bowed to Tucker respectfully.
<br><br>
In turn, Tucker hurried forward and helped Zen get up. "You are the king of our Nine Li race now. You don't have to salute me," he gently scolded.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, Zen was currently more than strong enough to command the remaining members of the Nine Li race. Moreover, his origin alone entitled him to a high status in the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
"This is to thank you for the Latent Theurgy you left for me back then," he said sincerely.
<br><br>
"Latent Theurgy?" Tucker was bewildered.
<br><br>
When Ambrose saw Tucker's surprise, he explained, "It's the Latent Theurgies we left behind in the divine land back then. The Grand Chieftain wanted to pass them on to the descendants of the Nine Li race, but it turned out Zen had gotten them..."
<br><br>
At that time, Zen had relied on that Latent Theurgy to escape from Elizabeth's hot pursuit.
<br><br>
"Our Nine Li race is destined to be blessed. After all, everything is predestined. Our other brothers can finally rest in peace..." sighed Tucker.
<br><br>
At that moment, the members of the Nine Li race welled up in tears. They were the survivors of the Nine Li race's core members from before, and their blood was relatively pure.
<br><br>
Ever since the destruction of their race, they had been moving on in difficulties. Now that they finally saw hope in Zen, how could they not be happy? The moment they came to the Pear Hill, they were determined to stand together with Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's appearance and his growth surprised all of them. If someone easily defeated him, then there would be no point for them to continue their existence in the world.
<br><br>
It wasn't just the remaining members of the Nine Li race who realized that, though. The super forces that crossed over to the Pear Hill's side also understood that only a very few people were qualified to enter the Other Shore at the end of the chaotic era.
<br><br>
If the Pear Hill failed, then everything would be over.
<br><br>
After the survivors of the Nine Li race had settled down, the Snake Goddess asked Zen about the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
The Deleting Space closed during the battle between Othniel and the Grandmaster of Heaven. The Snake Goddess speculated that Ziya had closed the entrance to the Deleting Space, but it hadn't been opened yet.
<br><br>
When she mentioned the matter to Zen, he tried to enter it again. However, he still couldn't get in. It seemed that there was no better way but to wait.
<br><br>
"Although we don't know what the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization will do next, you can enter the Other Shore during this peaceful period," the Snake Goddess suggested.
<br><br>
Zen never went to the Other Shore after he returned from the Eternal Scroll Painting. However, he didn't forget that he still had a mission.
<br><br>
The war in the chaos had temporarily come to an end, but the trouble he had to face on the Other Shore was probably even more complicated.
<br><br>
The vast bronze plain in the Grand Plain Stage, which was Stage Thirty-two had recorded the history of every chaotic era.
<br><br>
Some of the races became extinct, but some were still active in the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
The civilizations that had gotten a firm foothold on the Grand Plain Stage were the ruling civilizations. Those civilizations were also quite concerned about what happened in the chaos, especially the battle in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
After all, that was the first time the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization were directly involved.
<br><br>
There were many ways for them to hear about the news, but all the news that spread to the Grand Plain Stage came from the warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the Source World.
<br><br>
At first, the creatures on the Grand Plain Stage believed that the winner of this war would surely be the Element Spirit Civilization. That was because rarely any race had defeated them for the past many chaotic eras. It was safe to say that the ruling civilizations on the Grand Plain Stage all lived under the shadow of the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
To their surprise, the Element Spirit Civilization lost.
<br><br>
The forces led by the representatives the Element Spirit Civilization had chosen and supported, such as the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race, all suffered a crushing defeat. The Chaos Ancient Gods, Lamont and Herbert, who were behind them had died. Othniel was the only one that survived in the group of Chaos Ancient Gods that sided with the Element Spirit Civilization, and one of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization, Claire, was defeated as well.
<br><br>
What shocked the many forces on the Grand Plain Stage was that even the Grandmaster of Heaven was killed.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill fought against the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization alone, but in the end, they had won the battle. Naturally, the civilizations in the Grand Plain Stage were shocked when they heard the news.
<br><br>
There was already a group of civilizations that were willing to help Zen in the Grand Plain Stage. When the news of the Pear Hill's victory reached them, some of the ruling civilizations that had submitted to the Element Spirit Civilization even began to stray from them.
<br><br>
"Maybe this time is different?"
<br><br>
"Before Zen entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire came to him in person. They must be afraid of something!"
<br><br>
"It was said that the Element Spirit Civilization was not in a hurry to make a move in the beginning. This time, they attacked the Oneness Sky Palace purely because of Zen..."
<br><br>
Even though these Eternal Realm masters had surrendered to the Element Spirit Civilization, they didn't necessarily agree with what the civilization had done. The legend of the battle on the Pear Hill and the story about Zen ignited the flames of bravery in their hearts—but even if they had their thoughts, they kept it a secret at that stage.
<br><br>
The bronze plain on the Grand Plain Stage seemed endless that it took a lot of time to walk from one side to the other. The entrance to Stage Thirty- three was at the end of the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
"The dots on the ground are...snow..." Zen looked down at the bronze plain, where there were countless snowflakes on the ground.
<br><br>
The images on the ground were real, but all the images in the plain refreshed once an hour. Only the snowflakes remained fixed on the ground.
<br><br>
What was interesting was that when he stepped on the ground, he felt the cold air that came from the bronze plain.
<br><br>
"The end of the far north is a land of wild snow. Except for those masters at the Eternal Realm, very few other shore creatures come here," Libby, who was beside him, explained.
<br><br>
Currently, in the Oneness Sky Palace, Zen was the only one who could go to Stage Thirty-three. Of course, Libby, Pearce, and the other warriors at the Holy Soul Realm couldn't enter, so they only escorted Zen to the entrance.
<br><br>
"I can see that," he said as he looked at the ground engraved with dots in the distance. "Is the temperature here lower than that on the upper ice field of the Blooming Jade Stage?" he asked.
<br><br>
In reality, the space under the bronze ground was quite expansive. Since there were so many creatures from numerous chaotic eras in the Grand Plain Stage, there were many living species within it.
<br><br>
He had seen all sorts of Other Shore creatures along his way here. The gathering places of the Other Shore forces stretched endlessly, and some kingdoms and worlds crowded the area. However, he saw no signs of life when he arrived here. It was like all the creatures became extinct.
<br><br>
"I think so." Pearce, who stood next to him, nodded. "Although there is no Cold Prison here, life is still forbidden in this land. Even the Eternal Realm warriors would find it hard to survive here," he explained.
<br><br>
While he spoke, Zen saw a great bronze circle appear in front of him. There were Sanskrit words engraved around it.
<br><br>
To his surprise, it appeared that the Sanskrit words continually changed.
<br><br>
Moreover, they changed from one to another in just a blink of an eye.
<br><br>
"We're finally here at the Stage End Passage," Pearce announced as he looked at the ring.
<br><br>
It turned out that it was not a star ring that led to Stage Thirty-three, but this massive ring.
<br><br>
Just as Zen and his group went towards the passage, a part of the bronze ground nearby suddenly glowed.
<br><br>
Three white balls emerged from the world of ice and snow under the bronze ground. They were members of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Chapter 3936 Inside The Layer Of Earth Unlike Claire, these three members of the Element Spirit race didn't have their own forms. They all maintained their original form as Element Spirits.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The one at their helm was a cross-shaped block of solid ice. Its surface shone with a bluish-white luster.
<br><br>
Beside it was a ball of flames, then the last member's body was made up of several different elements.
<br><br>
Their bodies constantly changed, so it was hard to distinguish them, unlike Claire, who had a unique form.
<br><br>
However, they emitted remarkably strong auras that were only slightly weaker than Claire's.
<br><br>
Pearce and the others found it quite easy to deduce that they were probably part of the big ten of the Grand Plain Stage. "Are you Zen?" the crossshaped member of the Element Spirit race asked.
<br><br>
"What's the matter?" Zen said indifferently. Among the humans on the Other Shore, he was the only one in physical form.
<br><br>
Thus, there was no need for him to hide his identity now.
<br><br>
"Join us, we can give you three thousand places for survivors after the Purge Way is realized," said the cross-shaped ice.
<br><br>
Previously, Claire had offered him three hundred places, but he rejected her.
<br><br>
They increased the offer by ten times after the war with the Pear Hill, which meant that the Element Spirit Civilization's sincerity also intensified by the same value.
<br><br>
"It's not about the number of places. I've already talked to Claire. Forget about three hundred or three thousand as I won't agree even you offer thirty billion. That is my decision," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
Once he had chosen a target, there was no way he would change it.
<br><br>
The cross-shaped ice in the ball shook slightly then calmly replied, "This is your last chance. If you refuse, we will hunt you to no end in Stage Thirtythree."
<br><br>
Since the Grand Plain Stage had rules, it could be a good place for many civilizations to live and work in peace and contentment.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the only rule on the Three Purities Stage was strength, and the Element Spirit Civilization was undoubtedly the most powerful force in that place.
<br><br>
"You have hunted me many times," Zen said with a shrug. He ignored the three members' threat, then walked past them towards the large ring along with the masters at the Holy Soul Realm of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The three members of the Element Spirit race stared at Zen for a while.
<br><br>
They seemed to understand that they couldn't make him change his mind, so they just retreated.
<br><br>
Claire's failure had also caused immense shock in the Element Spirit Civilization. Thus, both the big ten of the Blood Assembly and the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization became divided into two factions. One thought that they should try their best to kill Zen, while the other insisted that they should continue to persuade him to join them.
<br><br>
In the end, the Blood Assembly compromised and decided to convince him one last time, which failed. Therefore, now the Element Spirit Civilization would prioritize killing him.
<br><br>
After the three members of the Element Spirit race left, Zen and the others went to the large ring, which was the Stage End Passage Pearce had mentioned.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
The ring embedded in the bronze plain sensed that an Eternal Realm warrior had approached it, and began to rotate automatically.
<br><br>
"We have to stop here. Only Eternal Realm warriors can step into the Stage End Passage. Once warriors like us step on it, our souls will be gone," said Pearce.
<br><br>
Such a tragedy had happened before. Back then, some warriors at the Holy Soul Realm and even some with the Myriad Tribulations Bodies tried to pass through the Stage End Passage. As a result, both their bodies and souls became utterly destroyed after the ring sucked them in.
<br><br>
Therefore, some civilizations and races in the Grand Plain Stage used the ring as a special punishment. They brought those who committed a capital crime to the Stage End Passage for execution.
<br><br>
"The Stage End Passage represents the Grand Pure Realm, which is the outermost part of the Three Purities Stage. Its high-speed rotation will enable you to appear anywhere at the Grand Pure Realm's periphery. That periphery is also quite dangerous for the warriors in the Eternal Realm, and there are three death lands in it..." Libby kept on elaborating the situation to Zen.
<br><br>
"Libby, this is the third time that you have explained this to him..." Goran, who was beside her, said with a helpless grin. "Although I haven't entered the Three Purities Stage before, the books state that the Grand Pure Realm is the most dangerous when an Eternal Realm warrior has just entered it,"
<br><br>
Libby said calmly.
<br><br>
The Stage End Passage randomly transported the warriors who entered it to any area in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
That way, they could avoid being chased by the forces in the Grand Plain Stage. However, it was extremely difficult for an Eternal Realm warrior to survive alone on the Grand Pure Realm, so the first step was very important.
<br><br>
"Don't forget that Zen is not an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior," Pearce commented. After all, he was quite confident in Zen's strength.
<br><br>
"I'm about to enter the Three Purities Stage for the first time, and I'm not familiar with everything. Libby is right to warn me of the danger," said Zen.
<br><br>
Then, he cupped his hands towards the people of the Oneness Sky Palace as a sign of goodbye and stepped towards the Stage End Passage.
<br><br>
The moment he stepped onto the Stage End Passage, he felt his entire body spin at a crazy speed with the ring.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
At that moment, all that Libby, Pearce, and the others saw was a blurry shadow.
<br><br>
As the Stage End Passage spun faster and faster, the speed at which the Sanskrit words around it changed increased as well. Not long after, the light glowed brightly, and Zen's figure disappeared in the Stage End Passage.
<br><br>
Finally, the entire Stage End Passage became still.
<br><br>
When he got teleported out of the Stage End Passage, he found that it felt similar to his experience in the star ring, but this time, it was much faster.
<br><br>
His body felt extreme pressure under the violent vibrations.
<br><br>
It was said that many Eternal Realm masters suffered severe injuries when they entered the Three Purities Stage for the first time.
<br><br>
But since the ancestry-level bloodline had transformed his body, it was easy for him to endure the pressure.
<br><br>
The sensation lasted for five minutes before his speed finally slowed down.
<br><br>
The once blurry surroundings slowly became clear, and everything in his vision was very dark. At the same time, an earthy scent filled his nostrils.
<br><br>
"Am I in the soil?"
<br><br>
As soon as he realized that, he immediately shut his mouth.
<br><br>
Libby had also warned him that when he passed through the Stage End Passage, it might send him to some strange places, like inside a thick layer of earth. Still, he didn't expect to end up in such an odd place when he first entered the Three Purities Stage. It was hard to get out of such a thick layer of soil! "It's better to land inside the layer of earth than in the death lands. It would be quite troublesome if you ended up in the death lands," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "I've been inside the layer of earth twice before. Please light up this place and let me see how deep you are," he added.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen tried hard to stretch his body and forcefully opened up space within the soil.
<br><br>
As he raised his hand, a dull white light spread out from his palm and illuminated the small space.
<br><br>
The soil around him was soft, and it seemed that it was soaked in blood as copious amounts of thick, red liquid kept seeping out. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, how deep am I now?" he asked.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven hesitated for a moment then said, "This is… the Diabolic Earth. You should be in the underground of the Land of Diabolic Demons."
<br><br>
Chapter 3937 Digging Although it was known that Stage One to Thirty-two on the Other Shore were also full of danger, it was only dangerous for the fragile Souls of Light.
<br><br>
If one could enter the Other Shore in physical form, they were more likely able to deal with the troubles thrown at them. This was why Other Shore Realm warriors used to be tough enemies for Other Shore creatures in the past.
<br><br>
Therefore, ever since Zen entered the Other Shore in his physical form, he had rarely encountered any unsolvable problems.
<br><br>
In fact, Stage One to Thirty-two on the Other Shore could be seen as a huge training ground. The training started with Stage One, was complicated by the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, and ended in the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
But the Three Purities Stage was a completely different story.
<br><br>
Horrible creatures lived here. To enter meant putting one's life in danger.
<br><br>
While it was true that the Three Purities Stage was extremely dangerous, the rewards it offered were extremely tantalizing.
<br><br>
For instance, after Eastern Emperor Taiyi reached the Eternal Realm, he had taken back a batch of Other Shore Tokens from the outermost Grand Pure Realm. These alone were enough to greatly enhance the Holy Soul Realm masters of the entire Oneness Sky Palace to a higher level.
<br><br>
Moreover, countless secrets were hidden in the Supreme Pure Realm and the Jade Pure Realm — secrets which, when discovered, were bound to enlighten and strengthen their finders.
<br><br>
But even the outermost Grand Pure Realm was much more dangerous than the lower stages on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Although the Primeval Lord of Heaven had been to the Land of Diabolic Demons, he had never plunged into the Diabolic Earth. Thus, he decided to question the other human heroes to glean any information about it. Finally, he got the answer from Gonggong, the God of Water.
<br><br>
There were a total of three death lands on the periphery of the Grand Pure Realm, and among them, the Land of Diabolic Demons was considered the most dangerous one.
<br><br>
"If I am now under the Land of Diabolic Demons, then that'd mean..." Zen trailed off as he studied his surroundings. Suddenly, he looked up. "I would need to dig out a path upward to leave."
<br><br>
It wasn't difficult for Zen to dig out a passageway through hundreds of miles of normal soil.
<br><br>
"Things are not that simple," the Primeval Lord of Heaven interrupted with a shake of his head. "The bodies of the Diabolic Demons are formed from the Diabolic Earth. This bloody Diabolic Earth is a part of their bodies."
<br><br>
"You mean, this whole place is alive...?"
<br><br>
Sizzle! Before Zen could even finish his sentence, a scarlet liquid suddenly gushed out towards him from the wall of the small cave he was in. As the blood streamed out onto the mud, faces made of blood red soil appeared all around him, one by one.
<br><br>
Then, in addition to the blood red faces, sinuous arms and sharp claws also burst forth from the muddy ground.
<br><br>
Just moments earlier, Zen had thought there was nothing extraordinary about this soil — boy, he was wrong! Puff! Puff! Puff! Zen snapped into action. Swinging his fists towards the faces that emerged from the soil, bloody mud splattered everywhere violently.
<br><br>
However, it seemed to be futile. With every face Zen bashed in, more took its place.
<br><br>
Everything was happening in a blur. All Zen could see was the horrible faces and sharp claws that constantly materialized around him.
<br><br>
"Gah, gah, gah..."
<br><br>
The Diabolic Demons made creepy sounds as they extended their sharp claws towards Zen from all directions.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Zen shouted, clamping a considerable number of slender arms under his armpit. Then, he spun around violently.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! The sickening sound of the earth-formed arms spinning rang throughout the soil. Then, a blue light flashed in Zen's right hand as he summoned a long sword from his Sumeru Space. As he brandished the sword, sharp sword radiance filled up the narrow space.
<br><br>
Initially, this cave was as narrow as a human's breadth. But, with Zen swinging his massive long sword around, it wasn't long before the cave walls crumbled to make more room. After a few moments, the cave was around ten feet high. The Diabolic Demons continued to attack him from the walls, but Zen was quicker than them, slashing at them before any could get close.
<br><br>
"These Diabolic Demons are not that strong... I'll manage."
<br><br>
Zen suddenly pointed his long sword upwards, his sword radiance shooting into the ceiling of the cave.
<br><br>
All the Diabolic Demons that appeared from above were minced to shreds by the sword radiance. In this way, Zen also paved a passageway spanning several hundred feet long.
<br><br>
"Be careful. There will be more powerful Diabolic Demons on the way ahead," the Primeval Lord of Heaven warned.
<br><br>
The safer forbidden lands within Stage Thirty-three had long been cleared and eliminated by the Element Spirit Civilization or other civilizations. All races that were able to survive for over a thousand chaotic eras had their own unique strength and survival methods.
<br><br>
Back then, Gonggong had encountered great dangers when he explored the Diabolic Earth alone. He had been left with no choice but to turn his body into formless water that seeped deep into the earth. He had finally managed to flow into a hidden river in the bottom of the ground and that was how he escaped alive. Yet with Zen, instead of acting stealthily like Gonggong did, he actually faced the danger head on! After Zen had drilled around several thousand feet in, he noticed the Diabolic Demons emerging from the walls in the distance were much larger than the ones he had just dealt with. Moreover, their thin and long bodies had a faint gray color shining on the surface. Zen narrowed his eyes, he knew what this meant: both their attacking and defensive abilities were much stronger.
<br><br>
However, they still weren't enough to stop Zen. He just pushed onwards, slaughtering anything that blocked his path.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on the surface of the Land of Diabolic Demons, a huge, triangular flower petal suddenly unfolded. In its center sat four black Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
Pop! A pillar of bloody red mud suddenly emerged from the soil and rose until it connected with the head of the black Diabolic Demon sitting in the front.
<br><br>
This demon blinked as he absorbed the information being sent to him through the mud pillar.
<br><br>
After a while, the Diabolic Demon grinned, revealing his sharp teeth. "A worthy prey is here."
<br><br>
"Is it an Eternal Realm warrior?" another Diabolic Demon asked excitedly.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Diabolic Demon in the lead nodded, smiling mischievously.
<br><br>
"What's the level of the creature's bloodline?" the third Diabolic Demon asked.
<br><br>
The first one shook his head. "I don't know. He has a strong body, and he hasn't yet used the power of his bloodline. I bet his bloodline is quite powerful..."
<br><br>
There was a reason why the Three Purities Stage was dangerous even for Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Devouring one made the aboriginals here stronger. While they couldn't obtain the abilities of the bloodlines, the more Eternal Realm warriors they devoured, the stronger they became. Moreover, this kind of enhancement was permanent. Not only would the current generation grow stronger, but so would their children and the generations to come.
<br><br>
The Diabolic Demons were notorious for their cruelty on the periphery of the Grand Pure Realm. There were a great number of Eternal Realm warriors who had died in the Land of Diabolic Demons. Even so, the Diabolic Demons were still not qualified to gain a foothold in the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The four leaders of the Diabolic Demons were eager to become stronger.
<br><br>
They would never let potential prey slip through their fingers.
<br><br>
"Then don't hesitate. Let's kill him," the fourth Diabolic Demon stood up immediately, raising his hands towards the outside of the huge petal.
<br><br>
On the scarlet earth, thousands of Diabolic Demons rose at their leaders' command. Then, they dove back into the earth, heading straight for Zen.
<br><br>
The thick earth was as soft as water to the Diabolic Demons. Following their subordinates, the four leading Diabolic Demons also plunged into the earth.
<br><br>
Zen, who was still deep in the Diabolic Earth, sped up his digging, but he was still unable to confirm where exactly he was underground.
<br><br>
He didn't know that he was digging towards the very center of the Land of Diabolic Demons, nor did he know that a large army of Diabolic Demons were closing in on him from every corner.
<br><br>
Chapter 3938 Being Caught The bright silver sword radiance was unstoppable. All the Diabolic Demons that crossed its path were shredded into pieces and became lifeless blood red Diabolic Earth again.
<br><br>
Zen didn't feel guilty in the slightest over killing all these Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
In his eyes, they were soulless creatures.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Clang! Zen was stunned. To his surprise, his long sword had slashed at the arm of a Diabolic Demon, yet it just bounced off, leaving only a mark.
<br><br>
It was his first time to encounter a Diabolic Demon that was able to resist his sword strike.
<br><br>
"It's a purple Diabolic Demon," Zen muttered as he looked the demon up and down.
<br><br>
Then, he noticed he was rapidly being surrounded by this new type of Diabolic Demons. Their skin glowed a corpse-like purple, and he knew they were much stronger than the grey ones he had been dealing with till now.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
A bright light flashed in Zen's eyes, and the power of his sword strike increased dramatically.
<br><br>
Crack! The purple Diabolic Demon was instantly cut into two pieces.
<br><br>
After Zen became an Eternal Realm warrior, his physical body was further strengthened. With a casual sword strike, he could release three to four hundred thousand divine megatons of force. Ordinary Eternal Realm warriors were no match for him.
<br><br>
However, despite this, the purple Diabolic Demons were still hard to slay.
<br><br>
Zen's pace was slowed down considerably.
<br><br>
"The purple Diabolic Demons are the backbone of the Land of Diabolic Demons. They are much stronger," the Primeval Lord of Heaven commented.
<br><br>
"But I don't think they are strong enough," Zen said with a sneer.
<br><br>
Splash! The half-moon shaped sword radiance lashed out, and three purple Diabolic Demons were sliced in half.
<br><br>
"Dark brown and black Diabolic Demons are the most powerful. The dark brown ones are the generals of their race, though there are not many of them. The black ones are their kings. It is said that there are only four kings in the whole Land of Diabolic Demons."
<br><br>
While the Primeval Lord of Heaven was lecturing, a dark brown Diabolic Demon appeared.
<br><br>
About seven dark brown claws suddenly stretched out from the cave wall above. They were not afraid of Zen's sword blade. To his surprise, they grabbed onto his blade and started pulling at it.
<br><br>
Under their joint effort, they were able to yank the sword right out of Zen's hand.
<br><br>
Seeing that they were about to take away his long sword, Zen quickly grabbed one end of the sword. Then, he somersaulted backwards, with silver sword radiance twirling around him.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! The sword radiance hit the dark brown sharp claws, but only a crisp sound was heard. The dark brown claws emerged from the attack, unscathed. Not even a mark was left on them.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened in shock.
<br><br>
Libby had told him repeatedly that the three death lands were extremely dangerous, and even the Primeval Lord of Heaven had also warned him since he entered the Land of Diabolic Demons. Yet, he was too consumed with confidence and didn't take them seriously.
<br><br>
He had fought all the way on the Other Shore. Except for the few stage rulers in the Dark Region, he didn't encounter any other formidable opponents.
<br><br>
The Diabolic Demons were the creatures on the periphery of the Grand Pure Realm. He had been under the impression that they weren't that strong, since they were just made of earth.
<br><br>
But this time, Zen was wrong. There were really no such thing as a weak race in the Three Purities Stage! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The demons took Zen's momentary surprise as an opportunity to strike.
<br><br>
Suddenly, those dark brown sharp claws reached out to grab him from all directions, wrapping around his limbs, body, and neck. It wasn't long before Zen was completely entangled.
<br><br>
Then, the dark brown Diabolic Demons emerged.
<br><br>
"Kof, Kof, Kof..."
<br><br>
"Goo, goo..."
<br><br>
They spoke in their own language, so Zen couldn't understand what they were saying.
<br><br>
Zen tried to break free from the claws, but they held him down tightly. Even if he used all his strength, it was futile.
<br><br>
"I warned you," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said helplessly. "It's irrational to force your way out."
<br><br>
"But I didn't have a chance to get out of here, anyway," Zen whined through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
He wasn't able to tell the direction underground, and when he first arrived, he was instantly surrounded by the Diabolic Demons. There was no way he could've escaped earlier! He didn't have the ability to turn himself into water and sneak away, like what Gonggong did.
<br><br>
Just then, the generals of Diabolic Demons carrying Zen suddenly bent their bodies slightly. Then, four black Diabolic Demons appeared in the earth in front of the passageway. They were the kings that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had mentioned.
<br><br>
The black Diabolic Demon in front studied Zen intently. His ugly face contorted into what looked like a frown. "You caught him, just like that? Wasn't it too easy?"
<br><br>
The kings were all under the impression that Zen was stronger than this.
<br><br>
As a result, they were quite disappointed he had been captured so easily.
<br><br>
They must've overestimated his strength.
<br><br>
After all, the stronger an Eternal Realm warrior was, the better his bloodline would be.
<br><br>
What the kings wanted to devour the most were the Eternal Realm warriors with higher-level bloodlines.
<br><br>
However, Zen was caught quite easily, which meant he was weak.
<br><br>
"He didn't use any ability of his bloodline. Strange." Another king shook his ugly head.
<br><br>
"Maybe his bloodline power just strengthens himself. Don't you think his body is quite sturdy?" a third black Diabolic Demon speculated.
<br><br>
The other Diabolic Demons could only communicate in their own language, but the four kings could communicate in human language very fluently.
<br><br>
As Zen heard what they said about him, his heart sank. "Are you not satisfied with me?" he asked piteously.
<br><br>
The first king took a step forward. "Of course not. Your bloodline power is of little use to us."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen was stunned.
<br><br>
"If we devour Eternal Realm warriors, we will get the rewards engraved in their bloodlines, which can greatly enhance us and our entire race," the king said as he stretched out his sinewy hand to wrap Zen's neck in his sharp ebony claw.
<br><br>
Zen was then pulled out of the dark brown claws.
<br><br>
His neck was tethered, but his hands and feet were free.
<br><br>
Clasping the king's arm with one hand, he kicked forward violently.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen gritted his teeth. His kick did nothing. The king barely even flinched.
<br><br>
"You probably just reached the Eternal Realm. It's not bad for you to have such power, but unfortunately, your bloodline is too weak." Once he finished speaking, the king threw Zen backwards like a rag doll.
<br><br>
Another two kings grabbed Zen from the left and the right. The last one grabbed a piece of earth from the wall and smeared it all over his body.
<br><br>
The Diabolic Earth was the mother of the Diabolic Demon race. It also was honored as their sacred place.
<br><br>
It was fine the outsiders intruded into the surface of the Land of Diabolic Demons. As long as they were on the ground, they wouldn't irritate the Diabolic Demons and had the chance to escape.
<br><br>
However, any creature that dared enter the Diabolic Earth was doomed. It was considered grave desecration of their sacred place. Zen was in great trouble now, since he even dug a path spanning dozens of miles long.
<br><br>
After Zen's body was covered with the Diabolic Earth all over, two kings pulled him up and drilled upwards until they reached the surface. The strange thing was that, with his body covered with the Diabolic Earth, he could move freely in the earth without damaging it, just like the Diabolic Demons. It was as though he were water seeping through the mud...
<br><br>
Chapter 3939 Intelligent Blood Vessels The Diabolic Earth flowed quickly along Zen's body. It was as fluid as water, and as red as blood.
<br><br>
The two kings of Diabolic Demons held on to Zen, dragging him all the way up. Soon they emerged from the ground.
<br><br>
Zen quickly looked around him. Nearby, he caught sight of an object that looked like a triangular flower petal. The moment he confirmed his position, Zen's lips curved in a bitter smile.
<br><br>
He had managed to dig for dozens of miles underground—but he dug in the opposite direction. He was now right in the center of the Land of Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
"Drag him in," ordered the king of Diabolic Demons in the lead.
<br><br>
The two kings who had Zen in their grasp dragged him towards the triangular petal.
<br><br>
There was a series of sharp cracking sounds.
<br><br>
As Zen came closer, he realized that the triangular petal was in actuality an enormous living creature. The triangle shape was the mouth of some kind of monster. It was ringed with huge spikes.
<br><br>
The kings dragged Zen directly into the triangular petal, and tendrils as thick as fingers suddenly stretched out from the depths of the mouth. The tendrils snaked around Zen until they were wrapped tightly around his whole body.
<br><br>
"Don't try to struggle," one of them told Zen.
<br><br>
"This is the most painless way to die," said the other king. "If you try to struggle and escape, we will ensure that you suffer a fate worse than death."
<br><br>
Zen calmly listened to their warnings.
<br><br>
Curiously he asked, "Aren't you going to eat me?"
<br><br>
The kings snorted with disgust. One of them snapped, "We don't eat humans."
<br><br>
With that, they checked to see that he was secure in the grip of the tendrils.
<br><br>
Then they turned and walked away from the triangular petal.
<br><br>
The four kings of Diabolic Demons stood in a circle around the petal and Zen. They stretched out their thin arms, waving their sharp claws as they communicated to each other in their own language. As Zen was held immobile, the kings were soon accompanied by other Diabolic Demons, and they all began to sing and dance.
<br><br>
"If they're not planning to eat me, then what? Is this petal-mouth going to swallow me?" Zen asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Even if they devour you, they won't be able to inherit your bloodline power. So naturally they won't do such a thing," replied the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "The formation of these death lands isn't a coincidence. The residents all have their own methods of sacrifice."
<br><br>
"Sacrifice..." For a moment Zen was puzzled. Then he understood what the Primeval Lord of Heaven meant. "Swallowing Eternal Realm warriors?"
<br><br>
"Yes," admitted the Primeval Lord of Heaven. He explained, "Sacrificing Eternal Realm warriors will increase the strength of their entire race, so every Eternal Realm warrior is the prey of all the Other Shore creatures in the Three Purities Stage. And this is what makes the stage dangerous."
<br><br>
Not much was known about the Three Purities Stage in the Oneness Sky Palace. None of the warriors of the palace, even Libby, knew much about it.
<br><br>
Libby was well-read and had learned that the vicious beasts of the Three Purities Stage had a deep enmity towards Eternal Realm warriors, but she did not know why.
<br><br>
"To whom do they make their sacrifices? The Four Spirits Sect?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"I am not wholly certain. I know that the recipient is outside the Abstruse Energy World, because whenever they offer up a sacrifice, they open a passageway that looks remarkably like the Eternal Scroll Painting. I didn't know about the Four Spirits Sect before, but now it seems like the most likely conclusion," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Zen sighed. "So I was targeted to be their sacrifice as soon as I entered the Three Purities Stage..." He trailed off, sounding depressed.
<br><br>
A series of strange cooing sounds suddenly issued from within the triangle petal.
<br><br>
The noise grew louder. Abruptly, the corners of the triangle petal folded inwards, as the mouth closed in on itself. The spikes on the petal clustered together in the center of the mouth as darkness enveloped Zen completely.
<br><br>
He could see only pitch blackness, but he heard a buzzing sound.
<br><br>
The darkness lasted for only a moment. Then, to Zen's surprise, complex Sanskrit words began to appear on the inner walls of the petal. A beam of light shone upon him, cloaking his entire body in light. The beam shot upwards, into the depths of the sky, as though it was establishing a connection with the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, more and more of the slender tendrils snaked around Zen's body. The tendrils had tips made of hollow thorns. These thorns were intended to pierce through skin to absorb all the blood in the body of the prey.
<br><br>
Zen's lips tightened. "It seems that this so-called sacrifice is just a way to obtain the bloodline of the Eternal Realm warriors," he muttered. "Hey, you, you should make your move before you get absorbed."
<br><br>
Normally, when Eternal Realm warriors merged with a bloodline, the two would become a single, fused whole. The power of the bloodline would be available for their use.
<br><br>
But that was not the case for Zen. The ancestry-level bloodline wouldn't fuse with his body at all. It would only help Zen when it had no other choice.
<br><br>
However, it refused to leave Zen's body as well. So the sacrifice method of the Land of Diabolic Demons would surely enrage it.
<br><br>
The sharp tips of the hollow thorns touched Zen's skin, about to pierce through.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen felt a wave of blood power rising within his body. It felt like his blood itself surged under the surface of his skin.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened. He had theorized that the ancestry-level bloodline would help him to forge a strong physical body, and that it would make it impossible for the thorns to penetrate his skin.
<br><br>
His conjecture was wrong.
<br><br>
Although he felt an enormous change had taken place, his body had not become stronger.
<br><br>
The first batch of hollow thorns was blocked by the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body. However, the Chaotic Source Spirits could only absorb a limited amount of power, so one round of the violent attack from the thorns was enough to exhaust them.
<br><br>
A second wave of thorns rushed towards Zen. At that moment, something strange happened.
<br><br>
The large and small blood vessels in Zen's body wriggled and swayed like snakes. They seemed to be dodging the thorns. Like a warrior evading an opponent's sword, they managed to avoid every thrust of the hollow thorns that pierced Zen's skin.
<br><br>
The thorns stabbed repeatedly at Zen.
<br><br>
Each time, the hollow thorns remained empty. They could not absorb even a single drop of blood from him.
<br><br>
Zen realized what was happening, but his face was screwed up as he fought to endure the pain of the stabbing thorns. His body had been repeatedly pierced and his skin was densely packed with holes.
<br><br>
"Hey, you... This is too much!" Zen said with groan.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was speechless. Apparently, although the ancestry-level bloodline should have a better way to counteract the thorns, it had chosen this way instead. By doing so, it was exacting its own form of revenge on Zen.
<br><br>
The triangle petal had attacked Zen relentlessly, but it still could not absorb any of his blood. In another wave of stabbing, the petal drove the hollow thorns as hard as it could into the depths of Zen's body. Although each thorn penetrated very deeply, the blood vessels in Zen's body continued to dodge the thorns, almost as though they were intelligent creatures who had anticipated each move of the thorns.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, outside the triangle petal, there was a sense of uncertainty in the air.
<br><br>
The four kings of Diabolic Demons and the others behind them were all kneeling in unison on the ground.
<br><br>
Sacrificing was a significant and solemn act for Diabolic Demons, and they always kept absolutely quiet until the whole ceremony was completed.
<br><br>
They knew the sacrifice was complete when they felt the power surging in their bodies. This would be strongest in the four kings, who stood to benefit the most from each sacrifice.
<br><br>
Based on past experience, the sacrificial ceremony should end after around five minutes.
<br><br>
But by now, at least twenty minutes had passed, and none of them felt any surge of power. It was still not done.
<br><br>
On very rare occasions, the sacrifice took longer than five minutes. It happened only when the bloodline of the sacrificial object was very pure and of the highest quality. So at first, their anticipation rose at the delay, as they realized that this sacrifice would yield results that were better than usual.
<br><br>
However, as time went by, the king of Diabolic Demons in the lead began to sense that something had gone wrong. Regardless of purity, the ceremony should not have lasted longer than fifteen or twenty minutes at the most.
<br><br>
What had happened inside the petal? By the time thirty minutes had passed, every single Diabolic Demon present at the ceremony began to feel restless and uneasy. There was still absolute silence, but everyone began looking furtively at the petal, or exchanging wordless glances with each other.
<br><br>
Finally, the most important of the kings of Diabolic Demons made up his mind. He stood up, and all the demons who still knelt were shocked. They watched as the king began making his way to the petal to see what was going on.
<br><br>
Chapter 3940 Poison The altar formed by the triangular petal was a living being.
<br><br>
As far as the kings of Diabolic Demons knew, none of the Eternal Realm warriors who were locked up in the altar had succeeded in breaking free.
<br><br>
After all, they hadn't been able to catch the powerful Eternal Realm warriors. The ones they had caught were weak.
<br><br>
But unfortunately for them, they had encountered the strange phenomenon that was Zen.
<br><br>
The hollow thorns kept stabbing Zen and piercing into his body, but they couldn't get any blood. The altar seemed to sense the changes in Zen's body.
<br><br>
As a result, more tendrils with hollow thorns began to grow.
<br><br>
The hollow thorns remained in Zen's body once they pierced through it.
<br><br>
More and more of them stung and pinched at him with every passing minute.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before Zen's body became densely packed with thorns, making him look like a hedgehog.
<br><br>
As the number of hollow thorns in Zen's body increased, little room was left for his blood vessels to move.
<br><br>
"There is no way out. Why don't you fight back? Isn't this enough?" Zen said through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
Zen's heart was divided into many parts, connected by a main meridian, to avoid the hollow thorns.
<br><br>
"Who are you talking to? Why is your body so special?"
<br><br>
The voice came from inside the living altar.
<br><br>
"I'm talking to myself, obviously," Zen said with a wry smile. "My bloodline is special, or I would have torn you apart by now."
<br><br>
"You alone?" the living altar sneered. "I don't know how you've changed your blood vessels but I will stab more thorns into your body."
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! More hollow thorns appeared and shot towards Zen in unison.
<br><br>
Zen smiled at this sight. Only by infuriating the living altar would the ancestry-level bloodline take the matter seriously.
<br><br>
He would then suffer less.
<br><br>
After the last wave of thorns got into Zen's body, the twisted blood vessels could no longer escape them and were pierced in many places.
<br><br>
"Since you're locked up here, there's no point in struggling," the living altar said as it began to greedily draw the blood from Zen's blood vessels.
<br><br>
Zen was surprised as he saw this, his eyebrows rising.
<br><br>
How was the ancestry-level bloodline allowing itself to be sucked out by the living altar? "The bloodline in your body is strong and pure. I like it a lot! Mmmm so delicious..." the living altar said excitedly as it sucked on Zen's blood.
<br><br>
But before it could finish talking, it stopped suddenly and let out a painful scream.
<br><br>
The triangular petal around the altar turned gray. It was obvious that it was poisoned. When the gray turned black, deep holes began to appear on the petal in quick succession.
<br><br>
The king in the lead approached and watched as the petal turned black and huge holes began to expand rapidly. It then drooped and withered just as quickly. All its life energy dissipated, and the light column that had soared into the sky disappeared.
<br><br>
The king, as well as the three other ones behind, was stunned.
<br><br>
All the Diabolic Demons were still kneeling in devotion, their heads bowed.
<br><br>
They didn't realize that their altar had rotted and died.
<br><br>
"Wh-what happened?" the king nearest to the petal stuttered.
<br><br>
In that moment, Zen struggled out of the tendrils and began to pull the hollow thorns out of his body.
<br><br>
The densely packed holes brought great pain to him but they were not serious wounds. As the green light flashed on the surface of his body, they all began to heal, one after the other.
<br><br>
"This altar has eaten something that shouldn't be eaten," Zen said, smiling as he fixed the king with a firm gaze.
<br><br>
"You did all this?" the king asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
He couldn't believe that a human warrior at the Eternal Realm could destroy the altar.
<br><br>
"Well, yes," Zen said, nodding. He was sure that the ancestry-level bloodline was part of him.
<br><br>
"You!" The king was now positively fuming. "I'll teach you a lesson!"
<br><br>
he said, waving his sharp claws as he charged at Zen.
<br><br>
"Time to make a move?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, staring at the king.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline knew it couldn't let Zen fight the king of Diabolic Demons alone. So it began to surge within his body.
<br><br>
A burning sensation erupted at the fingertips of Zen's right hand. It felt like flames were dancing on his skin. He subconsciously raised his hand and pointed at the king.
<br><br>
Puff! Zen's fingers began to expand and soon were boring into the king's chest.
<br><br>
The king looked at Zen, confused, his body trembling. Seconds later, he fell to the ground, motionless.
<br><br>
Zen retracted his fingers as the king fell.
<br><br>
Zen looked at his fingers, surprised. This time, the ancestry-level bloodline had only transformed his fingers, but it had been surprisingly useful.
<br><br>
But the moment the king fell, the mud beside him arched suddenly into a pointed pile. The pile quickly changed colors from red to black, and then turned into the king.
<br><br>
"You want to kill a Diabolic Demon on the Diabolic Earth? You dream too much!" the king sneered.
<br><br>
Zen had discovered this characteristic of the Diabolic Demons while fighting them underground.
<br><br>
No matter how many pieces they were cut into, they would always be able to revive themselves. It hadn't occurred to Zen that they could become immortal with the help of the Diabolic Earth.
<br><br>
The fact that the four kings had the ability to be reborn over and over again spelled trouble. Zen would find it difficult to escape the Land of Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
The king walked towards Zen. He had only taken two steps when Zen discovered that with every step he took, a black footprint was stamped on the scarlet Diabolic Earth.
<br><br>
"The color on your body is fading," Zen pointed out.
<br><br>
The king looked down and his face froze.
<br><br>
The black color on his body spread along his feet and into the Diabolic Earth, like a dye dripping into water.
<br><br>
"Poison!"
<br><br>
the king roared, jumping up into the air and trying to fly.
<br><br>
But his body suddenly felt powerless and he fell to the ground once again, this time, merging into the Diabolic Earth.
<br><br>
He could still be resurrected since the Diabolic Earth could help him through the process for an infinite number of times.
<br><br>
The poison on Zen's fingertips, however, hadn't been aimed at the king, but at the Diabolic Earth.
<br><br>
"Our Diabolic Earth has been poisoned!"
<br><br>
"Dig away the black earth!"
<br><br>
"Kill that brat first!"
<br><br>
The other three kings screamed, flustered.
<br><br>
Their greatest crisis was not that they were facing Zen, but the poison that had spread throughout the Diabolic Earth.
<br><br>
The Diabolic Demons rushed to dig the black Diabolic Earth out. But the earth they dug out merely rose high into the air and fell to the ground again.
<br><br>
What was worse was that the black poison had spread not only across the surface of the Diabolic Earth, but also deep underground.
<br><br>
Chapter 3941 Determine The Location As the ordinary Diabolic Demons came into contact with the poisonous Diabolic Earth, they also turned black and quickly fell to the ground.
<br><br>
Originally, these Diabolic Demons could be resurrected. However, as soon as they revived, they were poisoned to death again.
<br><br>
Generally, ordinary Diabolic Demons could easily resurrect for up to three times. After that, they would have a really hard time recovering their bodies. The powerful ones could be revived more than thrice, but the Diabolic Earth that they used to revive themselves were tainted with a vicious poison. Thus, whenever they resurrected, they couldn't escape the fate of dying again.
<br><br>
Even the king wasn't able to save himself when he came into contact with the Diabolic Earth.
<br><br>
The other three kings were lucky to prevent themselves from making contact with the Diabolic Earth. As soon as they realized that it was severely poisoned, they immediately leaped and floated in the air.
<br><br>
As the black spots spread at an incredible rate, their faces darkened and they were horrified at the scene.
<br><br>
All of the Diabolic Demons were actually a whole, and their core was the Diabolic Earth below.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful their enemies were, it was always difficult to invade the Land of Diabolic Demons. There was no way to conquer a land that was guarded by immortal beings. Furthermore, there were tens of thousands of Diabolic Demons that would welcome those who dared to enter their land.
<br><br>
As long as the Diabolic Demons were given enough time to expand the Diabolic Earth, they would be able to join the Supreme Pure Realm in the near future.
<br><br>
No one expected that the Diabolic Demons would encounter such a great crisis.
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! The land that turned to black began vibrating. Then, the ground not far away from Zen swelled and bulged high until a blood-red monster finally drilled out from it. However, only half of its original form was seen.
<br><br>
Immediately after, it also turned to black and disintegrated like the other Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
In reality, the Diabolic Earth itself was also a living creature. After it was severely poisoned, it started struggling so hard. The huge creature that got out from the ground and instantly disintegrated, was actually an incarnation of the Diabolic Earth.
<br><br>
After about two hours, the black spots had already spread to the edge of the Land of Diabolic Demons, about hundreds of miles away from where Zen was.
<br><br>
Near the Diabolic Earth's edge, there were clusters of pale yellow plants growing on it.
<br><br>
At the same time, there were also a few striped deer covetously keeping an eye on these yellow plants, which were their favorite food.
<br><br>
However, the current situation of the Land of Diabolic Demons was extremely dangerous. An ominous atmosphere kept the animals from getting any closer.
<br><br>
Perhaps, the deer that found the yellow plants hadn't eaten for a few days, which was why their hunger triumphed over their fear as they rushed to the plants without hesitation.
<br><br>
At this moment, about seven Diabolic Demons suddenly surfaced from the nearby red soil and surrounded the group of deer. It turned out that the yellow plants were actually bait placed by the Diabolic Demons to lure other creatures.
<br><br>
However, just as they pounced on the deer, the black poison quickly spread under their feet. Before they even touched the deer, their bodies collapsed, and the frightened deer fled in all directions.
<br><br>
After collapsing and recovering for a few times, the Diabolic Demons completely died. The originally blood-red Diabolic Earth was now completely enveloped in darkness.
<br><br>
The frightened group of deer waited and observed for a long time if there was any Diabolic Demon that was still lurking. Upon seeing the quiet land, they happily jumped into the area and chewed on the yellow plants.
<br><br>
Strangely enough, when they came into contact with the black Diabolic Earth, where the yellow plants were, nothing bad happened to them.
<br><br>
It turned out that the poison that Zen introduced into the Diabolic Earth could only affect the Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
The three remaining kings floated in the air and glared at Zen with furious faces. Zen had destroyed everything, including the altar, the race, and even the foundation of the Diabolic Earth. They were fuming with rage and wanted to get back at him as soon as they could.
<br><br>
"Human brat! Come up here and I'll give you a swift death!"
<br><br>
"Just you wait, and I'm going to devour your flesh!"
<br><br>
"I advise you to leave the Land of Diabolic Demons while you still can!"
<br><br>
The poison that contaminated the Diabolic Earth was so intense that it could instantly destroy and kill the Diabolic Demons. Even the kings didn't dare to come down and only shouted in disdain while they were up in the air.
<br><br>
Zen just smiled at them. He slowly dug his toe into the ground, and violently kicked upwards.
<br><br>
Splash! The black soil quickly spread towards the sky.
<br><br>
The three kings were caught off guard and were scared out of their wits.
<br><br>
They immediately flew up to a higher place as fast as they could.
<br><br>
However, one of the kings was a bit slow, and wasn't able to dodge the black soil.
<br><br>
"Aaargh!"
<br><br>
Immediately after, the king fell from the sky and crashed into the black soil.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, his whole body disintegrated without a trace.
<br><br>
This time, however, the king didn't come back to life.
<br><br>
The resurrection ability of the Diabolic Demons came from the Diabolic Earth. Since it was now engulfed by the deadly poison, the Diabolic Demons had lost their ability to be resurrected, and even their kings were no exception.
<br><br>
After that, Zen ignored the remaining two kings above him. He headed north as soon as he determined the direction he needed to take.
<br><br>
However, the two kings still followed him from behind, keeping a safe distance.
<br><br>
They didn't have the slightest intention of letting Zen go. They were just waiting for an opportunity to attack him as soon as he left the Diabolic Earth.
<br><br>
'Hmm. It'll be a little troublesome if they keep following me. I need to lose them somehow.' After thinking for a while, he finally knew what his plan would be. He immediately dug a hole in the area and hopped inside it.
<br><br>
The two kings didn't expect that Zen would do such a thing. They didn't dare follow him into the hole because their lives would be in grave danger.
<br><br>
After crossing a wide distance inside the Diabolic Earth, Zen came out on the other side and didn't sense the presence of the kings.
<br><br>
"As I move north from the center of the Land of Diabolic Demons, I will be able to see two isolated peaks. The first one is the Spirit Disappearing Peak, and the other one is the Soul Dissipating Peak. Oh, there they are," Zen said as he stared at the two peaks in the distance.
<br><br>
As he was approaching, he saw two mountains were standing in an arc on the left side and on the right side. One was pure silver in color, and the other was golden.
<br><br>
According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, these two mountains were indestructible. Every chaotic era, an alien space door would open at the place between the two mountains. Many Other Shore creatures and Eternal Realm warriors in the Grand Pure Realm would gather and break into it to explore the area.
<br><br>
The door would only open once every chaotic era, so he couldn't wait for that time to happen.
<br><br>
After finding a well-hidden corner, Zen quietly chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune and instantly withdrew from the Grand Pure Realm. He decided to let the Snake Goddess and Fuxi know where he was.
<br><br>
The people of the Oneness Sky Palace hoped that Zen could rescue Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasmin as soon as possible. To be able to do it, Zen needed to meet with the Snake Goddess and Fuxi first.
<br><br>
The fact that Zen had entered the Three Purities Stage was a big deal for the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill, the Oneness Sky Palace, and even several Chaos Ancient Gods paid close attention to Zen's journey.
<br><br>
Normally, as long as one didn't encounter any sort of trouble, they would choose to wake up as soon as they arrived at the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
However, Zen was delayed, which made the masters in the Pear Hill a little worried. They started to think that something must have gone wrong after he arrived at the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen safely left the Other Shore and opened his eyes. He perceived that the Dark Haze Peak suddenly became noisy as he woke up.
<br><br>
"Zen has finally woken up!"
<br><br>
"Really? Then that means he's safe!"
<br><br>
"I told you that we need not worry." Fuxi was standing beside him and quickly asked, "Where have you been transmitted by the Stage End Passage? You were out for quite a long time."
<br><br>
Zen looked around first and saw No. 9527, who was also beside him. He put on a helpless expression because of the number of people that were present. Zen was a very important figure now that even Chaos Ancient Gods visited him several times. All of these people even wanted to sleep there every day just to check up on him. There was no way that No. 9527 could stop them.
<br><br>
After Zen answered Fuxi, there was a sudden silence in the entire Dark Haze Peak. They couldn't believe what Zen had just said. All of their faces were immediately filled with horror as they heard its name.
<br><br>
"Did he just say...the Land of Diabolic Demons?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3942 The Heavenly Thunder Plain For the vast majority of Eternal Realm warriors, the Grand Pure Realm was equivalent to Stage Thirty-three because they would never be able to go to the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Land of Diabolic Demons was the most dangerous place in the Grand Pure Realm where survival was nigh impossible.
<br><br>
Each and every Eternal Realm warrior who dared pass through the Stage End Passage would have to risk their lives.
<br><br>
This led to a lot of them refusing to explore the Three Purities Stage altogether. Instead, they chose to stay in the Grand Plain Stage where it was safe and they'd be able to stay long there.
<br><br>
"Did you fall on the edge of the Land of Diabolic Demons and escape?"
<br><br>
Fuxi asked.
<br><br>
Zen had actually fallen into the inside of the Diabolic Earth, which should be the worst situation.
<br><br>
But Zen just nodded. "I was able to escape. I'm opposite the Spirit Disappearing Peak and the Soul Dissipating Peak now. You and the Snake Goddess can go there and easily find me."
<br><br>
"Opposite the Spirit Disappearing Peak and the Soul Dissipating Peak?" the Snake Goddess repeated. "You are not far away from the Land of Diabolic Demons. That place is still very dangerous."
<br><br>
Zen merely shrugged. "They shouldn't be able to find me."
<br><br>
The entirety of the Land of Diabolic Demons had since turned into a dead area, which would make it difficult for the two remaining kings to find him.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi exchanged glances.
<br><br>
It would be quite risky to venture so close to the Land of Diabolic Demons but since it was Zen, they definitely had to go.
<br><br>
"Don't go to the Other Shore for the time being," Fuxi told him. "You can go back after we arrive at the Spirit Disappearing Peak and the Soul Dissipating Peak."
<br><br>
Soon enough, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi sat cross-legged, opposite Zen, and entered the Other Shore together.
<br><br>
Zen sensed the fear in their hearts, yet he couldn't help but admire their willingness to take the risk with no evident hesitation.
<br><br>
The two had stayed in the Grand Pure Realm for a really long time so they were naturally very familiar with it.
<br><br>
Fuxi's Augury Dog was also of great help since he was able to foretell the dangers that hid in every corner. This ability surely came in handy to warn them in advance of any untoward incident heading their way.
<br><br>
After half a day's journey, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess arrived at the west side of the Land of Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
A strange feeling rose in their chests as they looked towards that forsaken land in the distance.
<br><br>
"Did the color of the Land of Diabolic Demons change?" Fuxi asked, confusion evident on his face. The Snake Goddess could only stare at the horizon, lost in thought.
<br><br>
For many years, the Diabolic Earth was blood-red. In fact, it was said that it was actually a living creature and the Diabolic Demons that roamed the land were birthed by the earth itself.
<br><br>
Since it had turned black, then did that mean that the Diabolic Earth had become stronger? Of course, it wasn't the time to instigate an investigation. They might be outstanding Eternal Realm warriors but the Land of Diabolic Demons was a scary place, even for them.
<br><br>
"We should go north and make a safe detour."
<br><br>
"North, and then go parallel to the Land of Diabolic Demons. We'll be safe and reach Zen in no time."
<br><br>
The two ventured forth once they came into an agreement. The Augury Dog followed closely behind Fuxi as they journeyed on. "This is one of the most dangerous places in the Grand Pure Realm, yet I don't sense any danger at all. It's quite strange," he muttered in observation.
<br><br>
Last time the Augury Dog followed Fuxi into the Land of Diabolic Demons, he had spent the entire time urging Fuxi to leave due to the extreme danger he felt from all over the place.
<br><br>
This time, though, he felt no danger at all. The entire Land of Diabolic Demons felt peaceful in its dead silence.
<br><br>
"It is quite strange. Look," the Snake Goddess said as she pointed towards the distance.
<br><br>
Dozens of deer were feasting on plants on the black Diabolic Earth peacefully. There were no signs of any Diabolic Demons around.
<br><br>
"Those Diabolic Demons have a strong sense of territory. They would never allow deer to approach their land. Where in the world are they?" Fuxi asked in concern due to the strangeness of the situation. The two companions' hearts sank at a sudden realization.
<br><br>
"Is it the Element Spirit Civilization or the Nihility race?" the Snake Goddess murmured with a frown. Diabolic Demons expanded their territory at an extremely slow rate and usually stayed within the Diabolic Earth in fierce protectiveness of their land. The Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race wouldn't dare to provoke them, would they? Aside from these two forces, there wasn't really anyone else who could wipe out the Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
Halfway through their journey, Fuxi tried to approach the edge of the Diabolic Earth but still did not see any Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
The situation was very strange but they came here for one thing only. Once they arrived at Zen's location, they immediately retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
When they returned, the Snake Goddess was quick to ask Zen about the situation. "Zen, did you see any Diabolic Demons when you fell into the Land of Diabolic Demons?"
<br><br>
The two waited for his answer with bated breath.
<br><br>
"Of course," Zen answered readily.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed. "Were they alive?" she specified.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "Yes."
<br><br>
"Then can you explain to us why all the Diabolic Demons in the entire land seemed to have disappeared, or perhaps died?" Fuxi asked. His voice had been loud and attracted other people's attention.
<br><br>
"What did he say?"
<br><br>
"All the Diabolic Demons died?"
<br><br>
"Then that means the land is now abandoned?"
<br><br>
"Isn't that good then? The Eternal Realm warriors will now feel safer."
<br><br>
Zen sported a faint smile on his face. "Not all of them died. There are still two kings left but I don't know where they are."
<br><br>
"Two kings?" the Snake Goddess repeated. "What about the others?"
<br><br>
Zen shrugged nonchalantly. "I poisoned them to death."
<br><br>
Fuxi already kind of suspected Zen had something to do with the sudden disappearance of the Diabolic Demons but it was still surreal to hear him admit it in person. He had to take a deep breath to stabilize his heart. The young man had just arrived yet he had already exterminated all the residents of the most dangerous place in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Even the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race would be impressed if they heard this.
<br><br>
"This matter must be kept secret," the Snake Goddess announced to those on the Dark Haze Peak.
<br><br>
Zen was currently a thorn in the two forces' side. If they knew what he did, then they would feel threatened and do something to the young man.
<br><br>
After the Snake Goddess gave the order to keep things quiet, she and Fuxi returned to the Other Shore with Zen.
<br><br>
Once inside the Other Shore, Fuxi looked back at the Land of Diabolic Demons and confirmed that there were indeed no more Diabolic Demons left. He sighed and took his companions to the place where Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin were trapped.
<br><br>
After passing the Spirit Disappearing Peak and the Soul Dissipating Peak, they arrived at the southeast part of the Grand Pure Realm. Here, they soon heard deep, rumbling sounds.
<br><br>
"The Heavenly Thunder Plain is right in front of us. It's not safe. We should take a detour," Fuxi warned.
<br><br>
"Crossing the plain will save us a lot of time though, but then again it might be too risky," the Snake Goddess agreed with a look of regret.
<br><br>
Zen, however, thought differently. "The Heavenly Thunder Plain? We might be able to cross it."
<br><br>
Back when he was in the Blooming Jade Stage, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's Imprisoning Lightning left a deep impression on him. He knew that it could perfectly restrain the thunderbolts and lightning here and even help them obtain the powerful Solid Lightning Powder. They couldn't just let this opportunity pass them by! Chapter 3943 The Monsters In The Door "Do you know how we can deal with the thunderbolts?" Fuxi asked as he pointed at the distance.
<br><br>
Right as he pointed, a huge thunderbolt fell from the sky and hit the plain below.
<br><br>
After endless hits from the thunderbolts, the entire Heavenly Thunder Plain was charred to a crisp.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen raised his hand and a faint, purple glow radiated from his palm. The purple light grew more and more intense; it was the Imprisoning Lightning.
<br><br>
"The Primeval Lord of Heaven of the human race once led all the human elites across the Heavenly Thunder Plain just by relying on this Imprisoning Lightning!"
<br><br>
As he spoke, Zen floated forward and landed right in the center of the Heavenly Thunder Plain.
<br><br>
The surface of the Heavenly Thunder Plain was very flat, so anything above its horizon was struck by lightning. Once Zen's toes touched the ground, he quickly attracted the thunder.
<br><br>
Boom! All of a sudden, a thunder dragon descended and headed straight for Zen's right hand.
<br><br>
However, Zen's right hand flashed fiercely with the purple Imprisoning Lightning. The moment the dragon came into contact with his palm, it disintegrated into brown ashes and scattered under Zen's feet.
<br><br>
Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's eyes widened and their jaws dropped. This was the first time they had ever witnessed this.
<br><br>
"It seems that the light solidified the thunderbolt, right?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
As she was extremely sensitive to energy, she could sense it even if it happened within a second.
<br><br>
Zen nodded as he carefully collected the Solid Lightning Powder and handed it to the Snake Goddess. "This is the Solid Lightning Powder. After the Primeval Lord of Heaven had accumulated enough Solid Lightning Powder, he used it to kill the Divine Retribution Beast."
<br><br>
"The Divine Retribution Beast..."
<br><br>
"The human race killed a Divine Retribution Beast?"
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess couldn't help but gasp in shock.
<br><br>
Although they knew the human race was strong in the past and could even resist the Element Spirit Civilization, they did not expect that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had once killed the Divine Retribution Beast.
<br><br>
As the Snake Goddess examined the Solid Lightning Powder in her hands, curiosity filled her thoughts. Suddenly, a shadow of Snake Goddess silently drilled into the Solid Lightning Powder.
<br><br>
Sizzle...
<br><br>
A streak of lightning flashed in her cupped hands.
<br><br>
"Woof, woof, woof!" the Augury Dog behind Fuxi barked ferociously at the sight of the lightning.
<br><br>
"Toss it out!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess was already prepared for any mishaps. With a slight shake of her hand, she threw out the Solid Lightning Powder as if nothing happened.
<br><br>
Splash! In the same moment, a round thunder ball around the size of a water tank bloomed and emitted a blinding light before them. The lightning lasted for a while until it gradually dissipated.
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes twitched as he felt the formidable power.
<br><br>
If the Snake Goddess was a second slower, half of her body would have been burnt to a crisp.
<br><br>
A handful of Solid Lightning Powder was already so powerful. What would happen if they accumulated more than this? And now, they could not only easily cross the Heavenly Thunder Plain, but also accumulate enough such powder. Soon enough, the three of them set off for the depths of the Heavenly Thunder Plain.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Only a handful of thunderbolts were on the edge of the Heavenly Thunder Plain, but the closer they got to the depths of the plain, the denser the thunderbolts became. As they moved for another hundred miles, the thunderbolts in the sky eventually became a thick thunder curtain.
<br><br>
Any creature sucked into the thunder curtain would be turned into ashes just by the thunderbolts.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, Zen raised his right hand and emitted the strong Imprisoning Lightning for their protection.
<br><br>
Any thunderbolt that came close to them, no matter how thick or thin, turned into dust. Meanwhile, Fuxi collected the powder for future use.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, were you able to absorb all the thunderbolts in the Heavenly Thunder Plain before? How did you make it?" Zen asked politely. He walked casually as he held out the Imprisoning Lightning in his hand, making the thunderbolts into powder each time they struck.
<br><br>
"If my real body came here, the Imprisoning Lightning released could illuminate the entire Heavenly Thunder Plain," the Primeval Lord of Heaven responded with a humble smile.
<br><br>
"Illuminating the entire Heavenly Thunder Plain..." Zen took a deep breath.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was a powerful warrior and was not one to be underestimated. He possessed the same level of power as the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack...
<br><br>
After traveling for another six or seven miles, the three eventually arrived at the core area of the Heavenly Thunder Plain. The thunderbolts fell to the ground like rainwater. It was a terrifying sight.
<br><br>
Their safe place was under the Imprisoning Lightning Zen had released. No matter how many thunderbolts struck, they were turned into Solid Lightning Powder.
<br><br>
After all, the Imprisoning Lightning was not the enemy of the thunder. It could just alter the thunderbolts into another form.
<br><br>
As Fuxi concentrated on gathering the Solid Lightning Powder, the Augury Dog beside him barked.
<br><br>
Though the creature was frightened by the Heavenly Thunder Plain, he was calm under the protection of the Imprisoning Lightning. His barks only meant that he sensed something else.
<br><br>
Zen, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi looked to the direction the Augury Dog barked in. There seemed to be nothing there.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Fuxi asked the Augury Dog.
<br><br>
The Augury Dog lay prostrate on the ground vigilantly. "I don't know. It seems that something dangerous is approaching..."
<br><br>
"Even the Other Shore creatures of the Grand Pure Realm can't survive here. You're probably just sensitive with all these thunderbolts," said Fuxi.
<br><br>
Even so, the Augury Dog's eyes still squinted at the direction as he sensed something odd.
<br><br>
They continued their journey for another three or four miles and they were about to go through the core area of the Heavenly Thunder Plain. However, the Augury Dog suddenly dropped to the ground again and whimpered in fear.
<br><br>
The last time when the Augury Dog was this frightened, there had been danger right around the corner.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" As soon as Fuxi asked, a door suddenly appeared a few feet away and two long-haired monsters stormed out from the door! The two hairy monsters growled and rushed towards the three of them.
<br><br>
The thunderbolts fell like an unending storm and hit the bodies of the beasts. It seemed that their fur protected them from all kinds of thunderbolts.
<br><br>
Fuxi was still busy collecting the Solid Lightning Powder when he caught sight of the two monsters. The long-haired monsters grabbed him, about to drag him into the flashes of lightning.
<br><br>
The intentions of the monsters were not their only worry now. The thunderbolts in the core area of the Heavenly Thunder Plain were already powerful enough that Fuxi wouldn't last half a minute there.
<br><br>
The moment Fuxi's arms were pulled out of the range of the Imprisoning Lightning, his hair was even singed by the lightning! Seeing that Fuxi was about to be dragged out, the Snake Goddess and Zen grabbed Fuxi by his arms to drag him back into the range of the Imprisoning Lightning.
<br><br>
Fuxi resembled a rope in a tug-of-war, being pulled on both ends.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was not that strong, while Zen's power was not like it used to be. With their combined efforts, Fuxi was motionless like a pillar.
<br><br>
The two monsters also seemed surprised. Their intention was only to take one person and inquire about the situation of the Grand Pure Realm, but none among the three were weaker than them.
<br><br>
Here, Fuxi suffered great pain. His bones were crushed, especially his backbone which was nearly broken. If the strength continuously increased, he'd be torn into two pieces.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Augury Dog pounced and emitted a faint bronze light from his mouth. He roared fiercely right at the two long-haired monsters! For some reason, the two long-haired monsters were extremely afraid of the Augury Dog's roar. When they heard the dog's barks, they quickly threw their hands up and retreated into the door.
<br><br>
The moment the door was shut, the door disappeared.
<br><br>
Chapter 3944 Flaming Maple Forest After Zen and the Snake Goddess pulled Fuxi back to the area covered by the Imprisoning Lightning, Fuxi lay flat on the ground, catching his breath.
<br><br>
Lightning had burnt the muscles on his arms into gray powder. Surprisingly, he didn't feel any pain at all.
<br><br>
It was fortunate enough that only half of his arms stretched out from the Imprisoning Lightning. If he was pulled out a little more, his head would have also been struck by thunderbolts, and he would instantly be killed.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess held out her hand, revealing a branch in her palm.
<br><br>
The energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess had been insinuated into the branch. The branch then sprouted to life, showing two beautiful emerald leaves.
<br><br>
She picked the leaves and gently wrapped them around Fuxi's arms. Fuxi's charred arms began to recover, bright red flesh, healthy muscles and new skin growing there. In less than a minute, the wounds had been completely healed.
<br><br>
After the Snake Goddess cured Fuxi, she saw Zen staring blankly at the distance. She asked curiously, "What's wrong? Do you know those longhaired monsters?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was experienced and knowledgeable, but she had never seen such strange creatures before.
<br><br>
They could block the thunderbolts and lightning only using their long hair and were also capable of opening a door at will. Was this a new force that appeared in the Three Purities Stage? "I don't know those long-haired monsters." Zen shook his head. "But I know that door..." he continued.
<br><br>
"The door... seems to be made of the space rule. Have you ever seen it before?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "Do you know the little girl beside Madam Yasamin?" he uttered again.
<br><br>
"You mean Dorothy, right?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
Although Dorothy was only a disciple of the Origin Mountain, she was the apple of Yasamin's eye. Since the Snake Goddess was gifted with a retentive memory, she couldn't forget Dorothy.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen nodded. "After Madam Yasamin was trapped, Dorothy disappeared, and everyone in the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't find her.
<br><br>
Later, the Oneness Sky Palace moved to the Pear Hill, but she still hasn't shown up."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess frowned, her eyebrows wrinkling slightly. She wondered why Zen mentioned Dorothy, and what she had to do with the long-haired monsters.
<br><br>
"When I entered Stage One of the Other Shore along with Dorothy, I used the Great Dominance Technique once. Upon taking control of her, I saw a door in her mind which was almost the same as that door." Zen pointed at place where the door had just disappeared.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were surprised by what they heard.
<br><br>
Others only knew that Dorothy had some unique talents. She had a high status in the Oneness Sky Palace with the favor and care of Yasamin who was of the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Now it seemed that Dorothy kept more secrets than the others had known.
<br><br>
That door had always been closed...
<br><br>
After her disappearance, it could be opened freely. There must be some connection between the two...
<br><br>
Could it be that Dorothy had opened this door? If the situation had not been too tense earlier, Zen would have tried to communicate with the two long-haired monsters. But now, he couldn't search for them.
<br><br>
Zen started walking over with the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. He reached out his hand and touched the air, trying to locate the remaining power of space.
<br><br>
However, under the attack of the thunderbolts, it had already dissipated.
<br><br>
Perhaps the ancestry-level bloodline had a way to find the door, but the ancestry-level bloodline always hesitated even if Zen asked for its help during a critical moment. It was simply unrealistic to expect voluntary help from it.
<br><br>
"Are you thinking that she probably entered the door?" the Snake Goddess asked, almost seeing through Zen's thoughts.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement. "She is not even at the Holy Soul Realm. There is no reason for her to escape from the Oneness Sky Palace..."
<br><br>
"There are still many unrevealed secrets of the Other Shore, and it isn't too strange that we couldn't find her here. However, since this door has appeared, some secrets shall be discovered sooner or later," the Snake Goddess comforted Zen in a low voice.
<br><br>
Fuxi squinted at Zen when he listened to the conversation at the moment.
<br><br>
He then continued to concentrate on collecting the Solid Lightning Powder.
<br><br>
As they passed through the core area of the Heavenly Thunder Plain, the Augury Dog displayed a state of calm and tranquility. They kept moving north, safely passing through the entirety of the plain.
<br><br>
"If all of the Solid Lightning Powder is activated, its resulting power will be unimaginable!" Fuxi exclaimed as he stored the Solid Lightning Powder in his space ring. He was pleased to gain an unexpected harvest. Such an amount of Solid Lightning Powder could be used as a trump card.
<br><br>
A red forest stood in front of them as they went farther from the Heavenly Thunder Plain. The Flaming Maple Trees a thousand feet high towered over them, densely lighting up the whole area. The scenery was magnificent and magically colorful.
<br><br>
"It's so beautiful... What kind of death land is this?" Zen asked, expressing his confusion.
<br><br>
The more beautiful and peculiar a place appeared, the more dangerous it was. Zen concluded this after all that he had gone through.
<br><br>
This time, his guess was proved wrong. The Snake Goddess smiled and said, "The Flaming Maple Forest is considered a safe area within the Three Purities Stage. No one will attack us here."
<br><br>
"How is that possible?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Look!"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stretched out her finger and pointed at a distant space in the Flaming Maple Forest. A beam of energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess spiraled out from her finger and drilled into the ground.
<br><br>
As the energy beam drilled deeper, all the Flaming Maple Trees began to shake, and a heavy gust of energy rose from the forest.
<br><br>
The strong wave of energy made everyone gasp for air. On the contrary, the Augury Dog was strangely quiet. He was aware that the Snake Goddess' test was safe, and this pressure was naturally a warning from the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Even though the Snake Goddess' move was purely a test, a maple leaf started shooting towards her, hitting her body.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess didn't bother to dodge because she knew she could not.
<br><br>
Instinctively, she touched the blood oozing from her chest. Beneath her hand, the wound started to heal. She turned to Zen and asked calmly, "Now, do you understand?"
<br><br>
"They attack whoever fights here. Is that right?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," The Snake Goddess nodded. "Thus, it is also considered a shelter within the Three Purities Stage. Many Eternal Realm warriors enter the Flaming Maple Forest to seek protection after an adventure in the Grand Pure Realm. The Three Purities Stage has more than one shelter."
<br><br>
"This is another reason why the latecomers were able to contend against the Element Spirit Civilization in the Three Purities Stage," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in Zen's mind.
<br><br>
In the beginning, when the Primeval Lord of Heaven led the human race into the Three Purities Stage, he had also taken refuge in these shelters. The real Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were now trapped in a similar shelter.
<br><br>
"Don't release any energy in the shelter, or you will suffer a great loss."
<br><br>
After the Snake Goddess' warning, the three of them continued to explore the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
According to the Snake Goddess, many creatures were hidden in the vast forest.
<br><br>
Some of them were Eternal Realm warriors from the Grand Plain Stage, while some were from the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
These creatures carefully maintained a distance from each other. When they saw the three of them arrive, the creatures quietly left, hiding in the depths of the forest.
<br><br>
For everyone, passing through a safe place was a piece of cake. Zen was also relaxed, but the ancestry-level bloodline in his body did not seem to intend for him to relax.
<br><br>
Chapter 3945 Fight Hand-To-Hand Not long after they entered the Flaming Maple Forest, Zen was shocked to feel a slight wave of energy that was coming from the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Even though the energy fluctuation was extremely slight, it was still enough to cause a reaction in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In an instant, the entire Flaming Maple Forest, which covered an area of a few miles, began to sway violently. It seemed that the shining maple leaves might fly and attack them at any time.
<br><br>
As Fuxi and the Snake Goddess saw the scene, their bodies froze and their faces turned pale.
<br><br>
If the Flaming Maple Forest really started attacking them, there would be no escaping it, and they would die a horrible death.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures that had been hiding behind the tree trunks somewhere in the forest thought that someone reckless had come. In fear that they would be caught in the trouble, they rapidly fled before the trees started attacking.
<br><br>
But after a few seconds, the light on the maple leaves gradually dimmed, and the energy reaction of the Flaming Maple Forest subsided.
<br><br>
When everything calmed down, Fuxi took a deep breath and yelled, "What do you think you're doing?!"
<br><br>
Earlier, the Snake Goddess had strictly warned Zen not to release any form of energy because that would awaken and disturb the Flaming Maple Forest. She knew that Zen wouldn't deliberately do something stupid.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry. The ancestry-level bloodline just got a little bit out of control that it caused an energy fluctuation," Zen explained with an apologetic face.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline didn't fluctuate further, or else they would have definitely died.
<br><br>
After a while, the ancestry-level bloodline stayed calm and showed no sign of making any trouble. Then, the three of them continued to go deeper into the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
"The Flaming Maple Forest is located in the western part of the Grand Pure Realm and extends all the way up to the Divine River. That's where Madam Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi are trapped," the Snake Goddess told Zen.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen didn't have the qualifications to enter Stage Thirty-three, so they didn't bother telling him the details about the situation of Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The Divine River was a mysterious body of water that ran through the Three Purities Stage. It was said that the source of the river was at the Jade Pure Realm. Then, it ran through the Supreme Pure Realm and extended to the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Both Eternal Realm warriors and Other Shore creatures were extremely interested in the Divine River because of the things that they could find there. These precious items were often washed down from the Supreme Pure Realm or the Jade Pure Realm. Everyone had been fighting real hard for these treasures for the longest time.
<br><br>
Of course, the river was also accompanied by extreme dangers. Countless creatures had already died there since ancient times. However, they still risked their lives for the chance of acquiring a great fortune.
<br><br>
"So, they are trapped at the bottom of the Divine River? What happened? Did someone chase them down there?" Zen curiously asked.
<br><br>
"That's right. At that time, Mahoney of the New Moon race set up a trap and eventually succeeded in luring Madam Yasamin there. Later, Eastern Emperor Taiyi also got trapped because he came and attempted to save Madam Yasamin," Fuxi explained.
<br><br>
"What's with the river? Why can't they escape it?" Zen inquired again.
<br><br>
"It's kind of hard to explain. It'll be better to see it with your own eyes," the Snake Goddess said after failing to think of a better way to explain.
<br><br>
After hearing that, Zen didn't ask any more questions. He just followed the Snake Goddess and Fuxi through the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
The Flaming Maple Forest was so vast and peculiar that it was difficult to tell which way they should go as they went deeper into it. Without a proper guide, one might easily get lost within it. Fortunately, Fuxi seemed to be rather familiar with the area. Every now and then, he would just take out the Eight Diagrams disk to quickly determine the direction that they needed to tread.
<br><br>
About four hours later, Fuxi suddenly stopped under three tall Flaming Maple Trees. "Wait a moment. I'll be right back," the Snake Goddess said and instantly left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In less than five minutes, the Snake Goddess re-appeared. From the shadow of the trees nearby, a figure quietly emerged. It was a large Ear Mouse— King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"King Ieuan, it's nice to meet you again," Zen said as he cupped his hands towards it.
<br><br>
"Oh, no need to be so formal. It's my honor to be of help," King Ieuan said with a faint smile.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had devoured the Chaos Ancient God Lamont alive.
<br><br>
Everyone present, including King Ieuan was utterly shocked. If it weren't for Zen's help at that critical moment, King Ieuan and most of its subordinates might have died miserably.
<br><br>
"So, how's the situation of the Flaming Maple Forest right now?" Fuxi asked straightforwardly.
<br><br>
Among the members of the Ear Mouse race, only King Ieuan could enter the Three Purities Stage at will. However, their race boasted the advantage of easily collecting information.
<br><br>
"Actually, some time ago, a lot of people were withdrawn from this place.
<br><br>
But just recently, the Element Spirit Civilization sent a lot of people again for monitoring," King Ieuan reported.
<br><br>
Fuxi furrowed his brows and asked, "Does that mean they know about our plan to rescue Madam Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi?"
<br><br>
"That's the only explanation I could think of," King Ieuan replied.
<br><br>
As a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, Zen had the responsibility to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi. The Element Spirit Civilization clearly knew about this, so after Zen entered the Three Purities Stage, they wasted no time and sent more people to guard the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
"Then, is there any way that we can avoid them?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
If possible, she wanted to save the two without facing the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure, but it will be very difficult," King Ieuan honestly said. "They have been waiting on the river courses. There's no other way but to swim in the Divine River. But it is still very difficult to not be discovered."
<br><br>
"All right then. Take us there," the Snake Goddess said in a soft voice.
<br><br>
After they had walked through the dense Flaming Maple Forest for quite some time, they heard loud sounds of water rippling from the distance.
<br><br>
Soon after, the Divine River appeared in front of them. Looking at the mysterious dark green river, Zen suddenly realized that it was made up of the Soul Interdicting Water, just like the Sanskrit Light Stage, but the Soul Interdicting Water contained in the river was much thicker.
<br><br>
He realized that the reason why Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin couldn't escape was that they were soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water present in the Divine River.
<br><br>
"Come on!"
<br><br>
"More!"
<br><br>
"Kill him! The piece of Gold and Silver Bone will be all yours!"
<br><br>
They heard people shouting from the distance.
<br><br>
When Zen and the others got closer to the river, they saw two huge creatures, about forty feet tall, brawling and fighting each other in an open space in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
"Hey, what are they doing?" There was a mixed expression of astonishment and confusion on Zen's face.
<br><br>
"They're fighting, of course" the Snake Goddess replied with a playful smile. "The one who wins can take the piece of Gold and Silver Bone for himself."
<br><br>
She then pointed to the side of the open space, where there was a stone table. On top of the table sat the piece of Gold and Silver Bone that she was referring to. It was most probably salvaged from the Divine River.
<br><br>
It was known that if there was a conflict in the process of salvaging, they needed to solve the dispute through hand-to-hand combat.
<br><br>
The one who won would have the right to claim the items at stake.
<br><br>
"I see that, but that's not my point. I mean, isn't it forbidden to fight in the Flaming Maple Forest?" Zen was further confused.
<br><br>
"It's not forbidden to fight. What's forbidden is the use of energy," Fuxi corrected him. "Likewise, we won't be attacked by the maple leaves if we just run, jump, and even fight hand-to-hand," he continued.
<br><br>
Thud! Splat! Just then, a muffled sound came from afar. One of the two gigantic creatures was seized by the throat. With a sudden mighty pull, his head was completely separated from his body. The more powerful creature smashed the opponent's head to the ground and crushed it. Afterward, the winner raised his hand and roared in front of the rowdy crowd.
<br><br>
"Yes! That's it!"
<br><br>
The crowd burst into loud cheers. They actually enjoyed this kind of scene.
<br><br>
"Fighting hand-to-hand is allowed, huh?" Zen softly uttered as he raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>
"Well, this rule has always been disadvantageous to the human race. There are only few humans who are strong enough to battle those kinds of strong creatures," Fuxi said indifferently, shrugging his shoulders.
<br><br>
Even if the humans were lucky enough to spot a precious item in the Divine River, this would always be taken by the Other Shore creatures because they didn't have the strength to fight them.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer were protected by the Element Spirit Civilization, so they had the advantage in this area. After all, a large number of Other Shore creatures followed the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Chapter 3946 The Misty River Race After killing his opponent, the winner stood in the forest glade without moving. He did not take the piece of Gold and Silver Bone away. Instead, he seemed to be waiting for someone.
<br><br>
Zen watched curiously. After a few moments, there was a stir on the other end of the glade—a huge creature had appeared.
<br><br>
The new arrival was enormous, at least twenty feet tall, resembling a human in appearance but with three horns on his head. His body flashed with a bold bronze color. Everyone felt the ground trembling as the giant strode heavily towards the stone platform. He clearly had formidable physical strength.
<br><br>
When the three-horned giant reached the stone platform, he bent down and stretched out his hand to grab the piece of Gold and Silver Bone. The giant stuffed the bone in his mouth, barely chewing before swallowing in large gulps.
<br><br>
Gold and Silver Bone was a precious rarity in the Divine River. Its hardness was its most valuable characteristic—replacing one's skeleton with Gold and Silver Bone led to a great enhancement of their physical strength. But now, this gigantic monster was devouring the bone as though it was no more than a snack.
<br><br>
The cracking of the bone could be heard throughout the forest.
<br><br>
However, as the monster chewed and swallowed, another sound echoed in the forest. It seemed to be the clash of colliding metal.
<br><br>
The winner's face turned pale as he witnessed this scene. But of course, he didn't dare to show any displeasure in front of the giant, so the winner gave a forced, strained smile.
<br><br>
"Have too many Gold and Silver Monsters in the Jade Pure Realm been slaughtered? This Gold and Silver Bone has no chewiness at all, and it tastes really terrible," the three-horned monster complained. He walked with booming steps towards the winner, lifting his arm while announcing, "Congratulations! You're the winner of the duel, so you're qualified to obtain the reward!"
<br><br>
The giant then stuffed the remaining one-third of the Gold and Silver Bone into the winner's hand. The winner gingerly held the mangled bone and almost grimaced before changing his expression into a smile. Finally, he turned and walked quietly away, teeth gritted with suppressed indignation.
<br><br>
"Any more battle for today?" said the three-horned monster, turning to the other creatures in the forest.
<br><br>
Silence fell over the forest clearing. Within the Flaming Maple Forest, this three-horned giant had absolute authority.
<br><br>
The powerful Other Shore creatures, even the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race were deferential to the three-horned monsters in this forest.
<br><br>
The giants were all-powerful in this domain. They played the role of arbiters in every issue, and extorted every creature in the forest at whim.
<br><br>
If the winner had dared to show any obvious discontent at the meager reward, he would have been killed ruthlessly.
<br><br>
"Good. If you don't have any more conflict today, don't bother me anymore, or I'll teach you all a good lesson!" shouted the three-horned monster, shaking a bronze fist. With that threat, the giant began lumbering away, back to the other end of the forest glade.
<br><br>
As soon as the three-horned giant was gone, the atmosphere in the forest clearing changed. Everyone started moving, becoming more loud and active.
<br><br>
The water splashed over the banks as someone jumped into the Divine River. Others followed suit, jumping with noisy splashes into the river.
<br><br>
Many creatures swam and waded in the Divine River, tirelessly dragging the soil for treasures. Others stayed in the clearing, exchanging the treasures they had obtained from the Divine River with great caution.
<br><br>
Zen stood still and observed everyone, then asked in a low voice, "What was that gigantic three-horned monster?"
<br><br>
"That was a member of the Misty River race," said Fuxi. A frown of disgust appeared on his face as he spoke. "That race has very, very few members.
<br><br>
There are roughly over twenty of them in existence. But their massive bodies and formidable physical strength make it almost impossible to defeat them here..."
<br><br>
In general, physical strength was unimportant in the Three Purities Stage. If the creatures here were free to use their theurgies, few would be afraid of the Misty River race.
<br><br>
However, with the protection of the Flaming Maple Forest, no one could do anything to harm the three-horned giants.
<br><br>
Over the years, the members of the Misty River race had decided to live on both sides of the Divine River. They constantly took advantage of the situations to further strengthen themselves. Their bodies became stronger and stronger, and now they had complete control over this area.
<br><br>
"Have they never left the Flaming Maple Forest? Not even once?" Zen asked with interest.
<br><br>
Fuxi chuckled and said, "Actually, there was one such case. It was the last patriarch of the Misty River race. He had benefited greatly from the Divine River, and his physical body had reached its peak, which made him believe that he was invincible in the world." Fuxi paused as though remembering the hubris of the giant, shaking his head. "But the monster lasted perhaps five minutes after he stepped out of the Flaming Maple Forest. Within minutes of leaving the forest, his body and soul were completely eliminated."
<br><br>
Many races hated the Misty River race to the core because of their outrageous habit of cheating and robbing those who passed through the forest. For instance, the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race had always wanted to get rid of the Misty River race, but they could do nothing to them in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
So when word spread that the patriarch of the Misty River race was planning to leave the forest, it became a rare opportunity for everyone to vent their anger. They all waited eagerly for the giant to leave the boundaries of the forest, then they attacked him immediately.
<br><br>
Afterwards, it turned out that more than arrogance had driven the patriarch of the Misty River race to depart from the Flaming Maple Forest. Someone had coaxed him to leave.
<br><br>
Since then, no one from the Misty River race had ever again left the Flaming Maple Forest. In retaliation, they squeezed the members of other races even more excessively.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen and everyone else heard the booming of heavy footsteps.
<br><br>
They stopped their conversation and turned towards the sound.
<br><br>
"Who the hell are you?"
<br><br>
A new member of the Misty River race appeared behind them.
<br><br>
This giant was slightly smaller in size than the one that had just left, but he had a much more malicious aura.
<br><br>
"What a pleasure to see you! Master Larkin, have you forgotten me already?" King Ieuan said politely, stepping forward to greet the monster.
<br><br>
The members of the Ear Mouse race were very talented at befriending and conducting business with other races. Indeed, in the past they had acted as emissaries to help the Misty River race bargain with other forces, so this giant—whose name was Larkin—had a good impression of King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"I know you," said Larkin to the Ear Mouse, his tone softening slightly.
<br><br>
"What are you doing here?"
<br><br>
"I was just about to take my friends to the Divine River when Master Brigham came to arbitrate a dispute over a piece of Gold and Silver Bone. It was improper for us to interfere, so we've waited here till now," King Ieuan explained patiently.
<br><br>
"Humph, go ahead then. Remember to teach these newcomers the rules of this area," Larkin said, waving his hand.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were of course not newcomers, but they disliked staying near the Divine River. Because they avoided that area, the members of the Misty River race were unfamiliar with the two of them.
<br><br>
After King Ieuan took the three humans to the forest clearing, their group immediately attracted the attention of many Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
There weren't many humans near the Divine River. Moreover, the conflict within the human race that had occurred recently had been hot news among many other races, so it came as no surprise that their appearance attracted many eyes.
<br><br>
Still, although other creatures were curious, they were not seriously interested in the affairs of humans. Most of the Other Shore creatures only watched the group of humans for a minute or so before getting distracted by their own concerns.
<br><br>
"Since the Misty River race rules over this area, how did the Element Spirit Civilization come to exert their influence on this area?" Zen asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
"Through benefits exchange. The Element Spirit Civilization provides some unique benefits to the Misty River race," replied King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"What does that mean? Are the members of the Misty River race acting as hired fighters for the Element Spirit Civilization?" Zen asked, looking concerned.
<br><br>
King Ieuan chuckled and said, "How can you think that the members of the Misty River race would be so easy to manipulate? Not to mention, the Element Spirit Civilization were involved in the killing of the last patriarch of the Misty River race. If indeed they asked the Misty River race to do something for them, they would ask a huge price in return, and still there would be no guarantee that the Misty River race would keep its word."
<br><br>
As King Ieuan spoke, the surface of the Divine River began to ripple.
<br><br>
Waves were forming on the water.
<br><br>
Water splashed as the waves rose and fell on the river.
<br><br>
There were fish swimming with the waves. Each fish was fist-sized, cutting quickly through the churning waters.
<br><br>
"It's the Golden Bites!"
<br><br>
"Go ashore now!"
<br><br>
"Leave the water or else you will become fish feed!"
<br><br>
The air was filled with shouts as the creatures on the ground shouted warnings at the creatures submerged in the river.
<br><br>
Those who were still in the Divine River wore expressions of panic as they tried to reach the shore.
<br><br>
This section of Divine River was within the range of the Flaming Maple Forest. They didn't dare use their theurgies, so they had no choice but to swim desperately towards the shores of the river, hoping to get to solid ground before the fish reached them.
<br><br>
There were thuds and splashes as the first creatures reached the shore.
<br><br>
The creatures tumbled out one after another in their haste to escape from the water.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, not all the creatures in the Divine River reached the shores in time. A few remained trapped in the water when the Golden Bites swarmed around them.
<br><br>
The Golden Bites, a shoal of fist-sized fish with shimmering golden scales, completely surrounded the creatures in the river. Within seconds, their prey sank deep into the water and disappeared without a trace, leaving only the flashing golden scales visible in the depths of the water.
<br><br>
Chapter 3947 Outflank Within the blink of an eye, the golden fish swam across the Divine River with such finesse that they disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
But the blood from the bottom remained on the surface of the river for a fair amount of time.
<br><br>
For the races on the shores, it seemed to be an experience they'd gotten used to over time. The creatures that had just crawled out of the water dived right back in without any visible reluctance.
<br><br>
"Do they not fear the Golden Bites?" Zen asked with apparent confusion reflecting from his face as he looked at the creatures in the Divine River.
<br><br>
The creatures residing in the Flaming Maple Forest were quite compelling, but the Golden Bites could easily tear them apart limb from limb. Their sheer brute strength was enough to send chills down their spines.
<br><br>
As soon as the Golden Bites were out of sight, they crawled back into the Divine River. They were fearless.
<br><br>
"Squeak! The Golden Bites won't come back. They eat anything, but they will only go all the way to the lower reaches from the upper reaches in flocks. After a flock of Golden Bites leave, the Divine River will become much safer," King Ieuan explained while maintaining a steady eye contact with Zen.
<br><br>
The creatures on the shores weren't the only ones whose existence was threatened by the Golden Bites. The fierce beasts in the Divine River too were powerless against them, and would end up getting devoured.
<br><br>
Therefore, every time they passed through the Divine River, it would be free of the usual threats. Many creatures would take this opportunity to find some treasures in the Divine River.
<br><br>
"Why don't we take this opportunity to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasamin?" Zen said with determination oozing from his tone.
<br><br>
The reason why he came to the Flaming Maple Forest was to rescue Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin. Since the two of them were trapped in the Divine River, and it was safe to enter it at this time, it was a favorable situation for him.
<br><br>
After scanning its surroundings by running its gaze all around, King Ieuan squeaked, "Don't be hasty. Let me go and check it out first."
<br><br>
Upon saying that, it quietly walked up to the Divine River and dived into it.
<br><br>
The speed at which it swam was insanely fast. It was hard to keep track of its movements. Within a flash, it reached the other end of the river. It was quickly out of sight after going down a distance along the other side.
<br><br>
Stationed at the lower reaches of the Divine River were more than ten creatures to guard that place. They were given strict orders to arrest Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin on sight.
<br><br>
At least, that was what the outsiders heard.
<br><br>
At that time, the Sun Crow race bore ill intentions against the Oneness Sky Palace. Their biggest priority was to annihilate both Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin and erase their existence from the world.
<br><br>
Killing two Eternal Realm warriors on the Other Shore was far less arduous compared to doing it in the chaos.
<br><br>
To follow through with their plans, the Yellow Thearch requested the assistance of the Element Spirit Civilization. He had asked Mahoney to lure Yasamin to the Divine River to finish her off. However, it never occurred to them that Yasamin would escape from their clutches and head to the bottom of the Divine River.
<br><br>
Although Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had successfully foiled the attempt to assassinate them, they were unable to return to the Oneness Sky Palace because they were soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water. Even though they hadn't taken them down for good, the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer had achieved their purpose in keeping them away from the Oneness Sky Palace. Taking advantage of the situation, the Sun Crow race went ahead and launched a full-blown attack on the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Due to the surprise attack and their lowered defenses, the Oneness Sky Palace faced difficulty in defending themselves against the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Since they were caught off guard, there was no time for Pear Hill to act fast and reinforce them.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, Zen appeared and released the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi to turn the situation in their favor.
<br><br>
As a result, the Sun Crow race experienced a massive setback, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin were no longer of any value.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization didn't even take Fuxi and the Snake Goddess seriously, let alone Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, who were only at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
That was why only three people were tasked to guard the place, and the others were transferred to other places one after another.
<br><br>
Then, after their battle raged on with Pear Hill, the Element Spirit Civilization decided to send more people to guard this place as an added precaution. However, this time, they had a switch of intentions. Instead of wanting to capture Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, they were asked to wait for Zen.
<br><br>
The Flaming Maple Forest was not the territory of the Element Spirit Civilization, so they could only send a limited number of spies there.
<br><br>
Additionally, King Ieuan was always sharp on its toes. Its cautious nature kept Zen and his group hidden away, avoiding all sorts of unwanted attention. However, it all went down the drain soon after they passed through the open space of the forest.
<br><br>
A hairy creature immediately rushed over to his friends to inform them of his latest discovery. "Some humans have arrived."
<br><br>
The name of their leader was Norris. Visually, he was a towering figure with an incredible height of fifty feet. His skin was of a thick cyan color, and his appearance overall gave off the impression of a wild ancient beast with low intelligence yet infinite reserves of strength.
<br><br>
"Humans? Are they the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer?" Norris furrowed his brows as he asked.
<br><br>
Despite his daunting presence and overwhelming size, his tone reflected calmness with a touch of elegance.
<br><br>
Norris was a tyrant in the Grand Pure Realm. After facing loss at the hands of the Eye Spirit, he had devoted his life to following his orders obediently.
<br><br>
Using his authority over him, the Eye Spirit sent him here to capture Zen.
<br><br>
Staying loyal to the Eye Spirit, Norris reassured the success of the task that was given to him. He was going to make sure Zen would not leave the Flaming Maple Forest alive.
<br><br>
"I'm familiar with the auras of the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer,"
<br><br>
the reporter answered. "But the auras of those people are different from theirs. They're quite strange."
<br><br>
As those words reached his ears, a gleam of light flashed through the pupils of Norris' eyes.
<br><br>
Right now, there were very few humans at the Eternal Realm. Besides the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer, only those from the Pear Hill could be these humans.
<br><br>
"It seems the prey has finally shown itself." Norris suddenly stood up and said to the creatures beside him, "You three continue to guard this place.
<br><br>
The others follow me!"
<br><br>
After assigning everyone their duties, he dashed towards the open space in the forest with about eight creatures following closely behind.
<br><br>
Unbeknownst to them, a small black head appeared on the surface of the Divine River. It was King Ieuan. As soon as it arrived, it witnessed the entire scene and caught wind of their malicious intentions. Shocked by the sudden discovery, it dived into the river once again and swam its way back to the upper reaches.
<br><br>
Previously, it swam downstream at an incredible pace to scope the area out for Zen. But now, as it swam upstream, its speed had decreased drastically.
<br><br>
It was visibly slower than Norris and his men.
<br><br>
However, the Divine River was in the shape of a funnel, and Norris and his men were far away in terms of distance.
<br><br>
Seeing that Norris was swiftly closing the distance between himself and the open space in the forest, King Ieuan emerged from the river and shouted, "Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Zen, quickly retreat from this place. They are coming!"
<br><br>
When King Ieuan's warning reached their ears, all three of them displayed expression of depression.
<br><br>
As they walked with quick steps and with their gazes fixated on the ground, three huge creatures suddenly appeared in front of them and blocked their path. They belonged to the Misty River race, and the leader was Larkin.
<br><br>
As Larkin eyed them up with disgust, a malicious smirk appeared on his face. "I forgot something. The guy from the Element Spirit race has told me that I would be rewarded handsomely if I were to catch you."
<br><br>
Most of the good things in the Three Purities Stage had fallen into the hands of the Element Spirit Civilization, and they always fulfilled every promise they made. Although the Misty River race and the Element Spirit Civilization didn't usually get along, they could still work together if it involved their mutual interest.
<br><br>
"Retreat from the Other Shore! Hurry up!"
<br><br>
King Ieuan shouted loudly again to remind them of the approaching calamity. However, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Zen remained rooted in their respective spots as they were forced into a dead end.
<br><br>
The three didn't have any time to process their next move. In a moment of desperation, they chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune, and their bodies blurred as they withdrew from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Illusion Breaking Rune was also a kind of energy. When the Flaming Maple Forest felt this energy, it immediately reacted to it in response.
<br><br>
Countless maple leaves flashed and flew over, but the three of them had disappeared on the Other Shore before the maple leaves could explode, so they remained unharmed.
<br><br>
Seeing the prey escape from the Other Shore right under his nose, Larkin became furious. "Catch that damn mouse!"
<br><br>
Even after the three escaped, Norris remained calm and showed no signs of frustration. He secretly made a gesture to the creatures under his command, and behind him, three of them jumped into the Divine River to capture King Ieuan.
<br><br>
Norris calmly walked over to the place where Zen, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi had disappeared. He wore a pensive expression on his face as he examined his surroundings.
<br><br>
There was a way to forcefully drag the creatures on the Other Shore back to the Source World. In the past, Flamine had planned to drag Elvinia back, but she was unsuccessful in her attempt.
<br><br>
Norris, on the other hand, had a way to forcefully drag the creatures from the chaos back to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chapter 3948 Dragged In Forcibly On the Dark Haze Peak, Zen, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi opened their eyes almost at the same time.
<br><br>
No one spoke at first, the silence cutting through the air.
<br><br>
They knew that they could truly escape from the crisis only if they found a secret place to retreat from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If they left the Other Shore under the watchful eyes of the public, they would probably never be able to return. The Element Spirit Civilization would most likely stay in the Flaming Maple Forest until the end of the world.
<br><br>
But just now, they had no choice but to retreat.
<br><br>
"King Ieuan is in the Divine River and can't leave the Other Shore," the Snake Goddess whispered.
<br><br>
"Go and have a look!" Fuxi stood up.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi turned into beams of light and flew away, Zen following them without hesitation.
<br><br>
This time, they went to the Flaming Maple Forest under King Ieuan's guidance. They hadn't expected such a huge mess would be caused.
<br><br>
On a different peak, Dempsey of the Ear Mouse race and several other Ear Mice stood guard. King Ieuan maintained its original posture, looking normal.
<br><br>
Dempsey cupped its hands towards Fuxi and said, "Human Sovereign, King Ieuan is now cultivating on the Other Shore. Please..."
<br><br>
"I know," said Fuxi, shaking his head. "We were together moments ago, but now, King Ieuan can't leave the Other Shore."
<br><br>
Dempsey and the other Ear Mice were shocked at these words.
<br><br>
They had heard of how dangerous the Three Purities Stage was. Now that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were forced to leave the Other Shore, King Ieuan might be in danger.
<br><br>
"What happened to King Ieuan?"
<br><br>
"Is something big happening in the Grand Pure Realm?"
<br><br>
"Why can't our king escape from the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were worried as they shot question after question.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked at King Ieuan and said, "It's not a big deal. King Ieuan might not be caught."
<br><br>
Splash, splash...
<br><br>
As it saw several members of alien races jumping into the Divine River, King Ieuan quickly turned around and swam towards the river's side.
<br><br>
It couldn't leave the Other Shore at the moment, and there was no way for it to survive even if it swam to either side of the Divine River. It had thought of the same method as Eastern Emperor Taiyi's to hide in the undercurrents of the Divine River.
<br><br>
It had no time to think about what would need to be done in the future.
<br><br>
King Ieuan had swum about a hundred feet when panic and despair filled its eyes.
<br><br>
About ten people were gathering in the direction, preparing to besiege it.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization hadn't left so many people in the Flaming Maple Forest. It was obvious that Norris had bribed these people into arresting it.
<br><br>
These warriors from alien races who had been staying in the Flaming Maple Forest all year round would do what they were paid to do as long as they got a rich reward. Besides, arresting King Ieuan was a piece of cake for them.
<br><br>
King Ieuan was then carried into the open space in the forest.
<br><br>
After keenly observing the place where Zen, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi had disappeared for a while, Norris turned around and walked towards King Ieuan, stretching out a strong finger and pressing it to King Ieuan's head.
<br><br>
His finger was even bigger than King Ieuan's head.
<br><br>
"Do they care about your life?" Norris asked.
<br><br>
"No," replied King Ieuan, gritting its teeth.
<br><br>
"You can die now then," Norris said, making to press his finger even more heavily into Ieuan's head.
<br><br>
"Yes, they do," King Ieuan backtracked.
<br><br>
After all, it was still afraid of death.
<br><br>
"Can you deliver my message to them?" Norris asked.
<br><br>
King Ieuan's eyes lit up, and it thought that Norris would let it leave the Other Shore. "When the Soul Interdicting Water doesn't work, I can leave and relay your words to them!"
<br><br>
"I didn't mean that," Norris said, shaking his head. "Are they with you? Can they see you?"
<br><br>
King Ieuan didn't know what Norris wanted to do. It hesitated for a moment and said, "I think they can."
<br><br>
"Very good." A smile appeared on Norris's face. He raised his thick finger, a sharp nail at its end, and began to write some words on King Ieuan's body, cutting into it as he wrote. Blood began to ooze out of these cuts, leaving deep, dark stains on King Ieuan's fur.
<br><br>
At the same time, these blood stains also appeared on King Ieuan's body in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The blood stains continued to expand into a bloody sentence. "Can you see the words?"
<br><br>
Zen, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Dempsey and the others saw these words, their faces darkening with each word. King Ieuan had already fallen into their hands.
<br><br>
"Come back to the Other Shore and follow me to meet Master Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
He can give you what you want."
<br><br>
These words extended all the way from King Ieuan's head to its chest and then to its back. King Ieuan was relatively small. Norris's finger, on the other hand, was thick and large. The bloody words quickly covered King Ieuan's entire body.
<br><br>
When there was no space left on King Ieuan's body for Norris to write, he threw King Ieuan aside like garbage. He turned around, looked at the place where Zen, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had disappeared, and waited.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit hoped that Norris could catch Zen. If he couldn't, then he could choose to kill him. So the first step that Norris had to take was to persuade Zen.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't planning to return to the Other Shore anytime soon. Norris's eyes narrowed as he drew a blood line on his arm and with a tug, he forcefully removed his left arm from his shoulder.
<br><br>
And though his arm was now separated from his body, it still was under his control.
<br><br>
The warriors of the alien races that had followed and supported Norris knew what he wanted to do, and retreated hastily. The three members of the Misty River race watched the scene unfold, their expressions cold but guarded.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The palm of his broken left arm flashed, as a ray of orange light began to gather on its surface. Norris then controlled his left arm to grab something in the void.
<br><br>
In the Pear Hill, Fuxi suddenly felt dizzy and soon found himself back on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Before Fuxi could react, Norris pulled him to his side.
<br><br>
Splash! The nonhuman creatures beside him had already prepared the Soul Interdicting Water and immediately poured it on Fuxi.
<br><br>
Some maple leaves began to float towards the broken left arm and one by one, attached themselves to it.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
And then, the maple leaves exploded, turning Norris's left arm into dust.
<br><br>
"Have I caught the wrong person? It doesn't matter. I will catch you all!"
<br><br>
Norris said, with a demented smile on his face.
<br><br>
His shoulder shook slightly as a new arm grew out of the stump.
<br><br>
Norris liked to strengthen his own body, but he had no choice in the Flaming Maple Forest but to use his left arm to grab Zen. This new left arm was much weaker than the previous one.
<br><br>
In the Pear Hill, Zen and the Snake Goddess were confused, not having known what had happened. Fuxi had lost consciousness and fallen to the ground.
<br><br>
It was not until the same handwriting as that on King Ieuan's body appeared on Fuxi's chest that they realized that Fuxi had been pulled back to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"You can't escape. You're next."
<br><br>
Both the Snake Goddess and Zen panicked at these words.
<br><br>
They had never heard of anyone who had such abilities. But Fuxi's plight had them believing that someone could catch people in the chaos and pull them back to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess didn't panic for long. Like Fuxi, she closed her eyes and was also taken back to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chapter 3949 The Consequence The Snake Goddess also got caught in the open space of the Flaming Maple Forest, where Norris stood and looked at her with a frown.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, there were certain conditions to be met for him to capture the creatures from the chaos and drag them back to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It wouldn't work if these creatures withdrew from the Other Shore more than three days ago. Because in that case, Norris couldn't see the shadow they left behind on the Other Shore. Besides, he could only randomly grab someone from those who left the Other Shore in groups.
<br><br>
Now, he aimed to get Zen, but he caught the wrong person twice.
<br><br>
Sizzle...
<br><br>
At that moment, a new arm began to grow from the wound on his left shoulder.
<br><br>
The arm that broke before grew quite fast, but after he lost it twice in a row, the regeneration speed for the third arm became slower.
<br><br>
But although Norris felt a little miserable, he wasn't anxious. Zen was the last one, so he would catch him and take him back to the Other Shore next time. He still had enough time to complete the task.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the Ear Mouse had gotten imprisoned. They exchanged worried looks while in silence.
<br><br>
They survived the war against the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race, only to get trapped in the Flaming Maple Forest! If Norris caught Zen and took him to the Other Shore, he would be like a fish on the chopping block.
<br><br>
Speaking of Zen, he was now in the chaos with an unusually serious expression.
<br><br>
"Master Zen, what should we do now?"
<br><br>
"Were the Human Sovereign and the Snake Goddess really dragged back to the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"Zen, I'm afraid you'll be the next one to be pulled to the Other Shore. You'd better find a way to escape as soon as possible. Squeak..."
<br><br>
Dempsey and some Ear Mice, who were with him, couldn't help but feel anxious.
<br><br>
Zen just rolled his eyes and felt a little helpless. If only he could run, he would've run away.
<br><br>
Although he didn't know what method the opponent had used to pull Fuxi and the Snake Goddess in, the enemy had probably taken advantage of the place where they withdrew from the Other Shore. After all, he couldn't change his position if he couldn't enter the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was most likely his turn to be dragged into the Other Shore.
<br><br>
What to do now...
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was also silent, but he too tried to think of a way to break the situation. However, no matter how much he thought, it was useless since the theurgy wasn't allowed within the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
"If you can't use the theurgy, you can only fight with your physical body.
<br><br>
Then, you need more strength and a stronger physical body..."
<br><br>
Puff! At that point, streams of blood gushed out from the Snake Goddess's back, and crimson words appeared from top to bottom on her snow-white skin.
<br><br>
"You're lucky. You'll be the last one. Are you ready?"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice and Zen stared at the words sullenly. It was as if the words mocked them.
<br><br>
"A stronger physical body and more strength..." Then, Zen raised his hands and looked around.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline could change his physical form and also give him immensely strong power. However, it was very stingy. It would only strengthen his body when he was on the verge of death.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to persuade the ancestry-level bloodline, he suddenly felt his body become burning hot. The ancestry-level bloodline fluctuated, and then his body began to change drastically.
<br><br>
Finally, his body instantly grew up to fifty feet high. The muscles on his chest became like small dragons, and his bones changed even more: each of his arms had one tibia before, but now six extra tibiae grew.
<br><br>
The extra tibiae formed a more complex but very solid bone system.
<br><br>
As his physical body changed, his aura also changed a lot. Several Holy Soul Realm Ear Mice, including Dempsey, all looked at him in fear.
<br><br>
Even though they knew it was Zen, and he could change, they still couldn't help but feel afraid.
<br><br>
Of course, his excessive strength and powerful physical body also changed his state of mind.
<br><br>
At this moment, he felt a strong urge to fight! His panic was gone without a trace, replaced with a sense of expectation.
<br><br>
He even waited eagerly for the opponent to pull him to the Other Shore! Meanwhile, multiple nonhuman creatures waited in the open space of the forest.
<br><br>
Norris' left arm was still growing slowly. As the new and tender flesh slowly emerged, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and King Ieuan became increasingly desperate.
<br><br>
Not long after, his left arm had fully grown. Then, he created another bloodstain on his left arm and removed it.
<br><br>
Buzz! Light glowed on the palm of the broken arm and he stretched it towards the void.
<br><br>
The moment the broken arm touched the void, it caught something.
<br><br>
"I have caught him!"
<br><br>
The corners of his mouth curled up into a smirk. This time, he wouldn't make a mistake again.
<br><br>
With a fierce tug, he dragged Zen to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
He, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the members of the Misty River race who were watching on the side, all expected that an ordinary Eternal Realm human warrior would come out from the other side.
<br><br>
However, what appeared was not a human, but a massive creature that was fifty feet tall! Upon seeing the creature, Fuxi instinctively thought that Zen had activated the Wild God Body, but the Flaming Maple Forest attacked anyone who used the Wild God Power and made any move related to energy.
<br><br>
Yet, he saw that Zen had changed his appearance entirely. He realized that Zen's bloodline must've worked! The Snake Goddess' and King Ieuan's eyes both lit up with hope. They knew how powerful the bloodline in Zen's body was.
<br><br>
"I've heard that you waited for me, right?" Zen said as he looked down at Norris in front of him. "You are..."
<br><br>
At first, Norris was complacent and believed that he would surely catch Zen this time.
<br><br>
But now, his voice became slightly shaky as he faced the immensely tall Zen.
<br><br>
The nonhuman creatures behind him looked even more terrified. One of them, who held a basin of Soul Interdicting Water, dare not pour it on Zen! Even Larkin of the Misty River race stared at Zen in trepidation, his bronzecolored face wrinkling by his frown.
<br><br>
After the Element Spirit Civilization had paid a heavy price, the members of the Misty River race allowed them to act rashly in this place.
<br><br>
However, this "human being" Norris had pulled into the Other Shore secretly threatened Larkin.
<br><br>
He had not felt like that in a long time, so he was extremely upset about it.
<br><br>
"I am Zen," Zen replied. "How did you... become like this?" Norris asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
"You just need to know the consequence of provoking me," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
"What consequence?"
<br><br>
"Crack…"
<br><br>
Before he could say anything else, Zen grabbed his shoulder with one hand and gripped his face with the other.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen's strong legs suddenly kicked on the ground and dug two big holes.
<br><br>
Crack! At the next moment, everyone saw that he had pushed Norris against the biggest Flaming Maple Tree. His force also hit the tree, which caused many leaves to fall. However, the maple leaves didn't shine or explode.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Next, they all saw that Zen's hands had turned into countless fist shadows.
<br><br>
Clouds of blood mist burst out as each fist shadow exploded upon Norris' body.
<br><br>
About thirty seconds later, Norris' powerful body had turned into thin shreds that clung onto the Flaming Maple Tree. None of his body parts were still intact.
<br><br>
Zen turned around and said, "The consequence is death."
<br><br>
Of course, he didn't say those words to Norris, who was already dead.
<br><br>
Chapter 3950 Writing Norris was known as one of the most powerful cultivators in the Grand Pure Realm. Only a few could match his overwhelming physical strength.
<br><br>
Even the weaker members of the Misty River race were no match for him.
<br><br>
That was why everyone who was watching didn't expect he would die in such a pathetic way. He died on the Flaming Maple Tree before he could even make a move.
<br><br>
The creatures that followed Norris were left dumbfounded. Their eyes and mouths were wide open as they looked at the bloody scene on the Flaming Maple Tree.
<br><br>
They trembled in fear as they realized that the warrior that they looked up to easily died in such a miserable way.
<br><br>
As the creatures turned to look at Zen, their anger dissipated and was replaced by extreme horror. They couldn't help thinking if this guy was just really a human.
<br><br>
After killing Norris, Zen looked at King Ieuan, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess, who were still being detained.
<br><br>
The three creatures that were guarding them were still in shock. However, as they discovered that Zen was looking at their direction, they quickly regained their senses and felt like an electric shock was running beneath their skin. Fearing greatly for their lives, they jumped into the Divine River behind them without thinking twice.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Splash! As their bodies fell into the water, they wasted no time and quickly fled downstream.
<br><br>
At that moment, there were still other creatures in the open space of the forest. Most of them were neutral, while a few of them were closely related to the Nihility race.
<br><br>
However, right now, it was a conflict between Zen and the Element Spirit Civilization, and these creatures were having fun watching the commotion.
<br><br>
"Now this is interesting."
<br><br>
"I wonder if this guy's surprising strength is enough to challenge the members of the Misty River race."
<br><br>
"Humph! That's nothing. He may be able to deal with the ordinary members of the Misty River race, but if that man reveals himself, this human will be ravaged into pieces. Don't even dream about it!"
<br><br>
The creatures chatted and whispered among themselves.
<br><br>
For a long time now, these creatures had lived beside the Divine River and were oppressed by the members of the Misty River race.
<br><br>
They endured so many years, but they were just too weak to fight back. One could just imagine the grievance and agony in their hearts.
<br><br>
With the sudden appearance of Zen, some creatures thought that he might be the glimmer of hope that they had been waiting. But when someone mentioned "that man", the remaining light of hope in their eyes quickly dissipated.
<br><br>
That member of the Misty River race was exceptionally powerful. No one ever defeated him, at least in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the center of the Snake Goddess's palm flashed a faint green light. Wherever the light passed, the wounds on the surface of her body instantly healed.
<br><br>
Fuxi also started healing his wounds, and in no time, their bodies had already recovered.
<br><br>
After that, Zen approached them and said, "I think those guys wouldn't dare to stop us anymore. It's our chance to swim downstream."
<br><br>
There were actually still a few creatures left. However, they were much weaker than Zen. With Zen's current strength, he could just easily kill them all if they tried to hinder them.
<br><br>
When they were about to set out, three members of the Misty River race, who were watching earlier, stood in front of them. Larkin, the leader of their group, deliberately blocked Zen's way.
<br><br>
Even if Zen brought down a powerful warrior like Norris, they remained unfazed. For them, the place was the territory of their race, and all creatures had to obey them.
<br><br>
"You're blocking the way,"
<br><br>
Zen said coldly as he stared down at Larkin. "Do you think you can just leave like that? You killed someone in our territory," Larkin answered in a condescending tone.
<br><br>
"That someone didn't belong to your race," Zen said with a smirk. "And this is not your territory."
<br><br>
When the other creatures in the open space of the forest heard this, a faint smile appeared on their faces as they repeatedly nodded. The Flaming Maple Forest itself was a shelter in the Three Purities Stage. Then, the Misty River race occupied the place and started threatening the creatures there. However, they couldn't fight back as the Misty River race was much more powerful than them here.
<br><br>
But still, most of the creatures feared the authority of the Misty River race, so they didn't dare utter a word of support towards Zen.
<br><br>
Obviously, Zen's words offended the Misty River race. The faces of the three members immediately darkened, and a strong killing intent oozed from Larkin's eyes.
<br><br>
If Zen was just an ordinary Other Shore creature, Larkin would have already grabbed his head and smashed it to the ground.
<br><br>
However, Larkin clearly witnessed Zen's strength when he killed Norris effortlessly. He did not dare to be rash and only managed to answer with a sinister smile, "Don't push your luck, human. You'll definitely regret it!"
<br><br>
Zen just laughed away his threat. "Stop yapping, and just do it, if you can."
<br><br>
Zen took a quick step forward and knocked off Larkin's sturdy and heavy body with ease. He stared down at Larkin for a few seconds before he left with the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and King Ieuan.
<br><br>
Fuxi had a smirk on his face while shaking his head as they left the area.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi seldom appeared in the Flaming Maple Forest. On the other hand, King Ieuan had been staying in the forest for quite a long time. In order to build a good relationship with the creatures on the Other Shore, it had no choice but to endure several hardships. But now that it was with Zen and the two Eternal Realm masters, it had a beaming self-confidence.
<br><br>
When they approached the lower reaches of the Divine River, they saw that the currents became more turbulent. From time to time, there would be huge whirlpools rapidly appearing and disappearing.
<br><br>
As they arrived at the river, they noticed that the creatures that should be standing guard had already fled.
<br><br>
"Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasamin are at the bottom of the river,"
<br><br>
King Ieuan informed. "This area is very dangerous. The undercurrents are complex and several unknown monsters reside there."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin were trapped and forced into the undercurrents. However, the two of them seemed to have known the rules applied there. They had stayed there for so long but didn't encounter any sort of danger.
<br><br>
"If the undercurrents are too complex, then it would not be easy to find them. Is there a possibility that they could come out by themselves?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"It should actually be possible. Not long ago, Eastern Emperor Taiyi surfaced and tried to escape. However, his attempt failed because several creatures were guarding the shore," King Ieuan said. "Now that the creatures that were supposed to be guarding have already fled, they should be able to come out on their own. The only problem is how we could inform them."
<br><br>
The eyes of Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Zen immediately lit up at its words. "Well, the two of them will have to suffer a little bit," the Snake Goddess said with a faint smile.
<br><br>
After the Soul Interdicting Water on their bodies lost its effect, they quickly left the Other Shore and rushed to the residences of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.
<br><br>
They saw that their bodies were still in good condition and their breath had not weakened. This meant that they were not hurt on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After releasing their bodies from the red crystals, the Snake Goddess stretched out two of her fingers, and her shadow turned into a thin energy needle. Then she wrote something carefully on the arms of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.
<br><br>
There were caves of various sizes at the bottom of the Divine River. As the caves were connected with each other, complex undercurrents were formed.
<br><br>
Inside one of the undercurrents, there was a long and narrow cave that only a single person could pass through. In the innermost layer of this cave, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin sat there with legs crossed, soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, suddenly felt a piercing pain in his arm. He immediately opened his eyes and saw that some words were being written on it.
<br><br>
Seeing this, he thought of the person who could be writing them.
<br><br>
"Flamine?" he muttered.
<br><br>
Chapter 3951 Giant Turbid Crocodiles Thin blood lines formed clear words on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's arm.
<br><br>
"Zen has driven away all the guards above. You are safe now," the words stated.
<br><br>
The emperor's eyes widened in disbelief when he saw the words on his arm.
<br><br>
Had Zen entered Stage Thirty-three? It was truly unbelievable! He had met Zen twice in the Oneness Sky Palace, and he thought that the young warrior was exceptional back then.
<br><br>
Moreover, Zen led the human race to occupy Stage Fourteen after he entered the Desire World.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had high expectations for Zen, and he even believed that Zen might reach the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
However, the news he received was a little too much.
<br><br>
He didn't expect that Zen had entered the Grand Pure Realm after just a short time! He cast his thoughts aside and stretched out his hand, then pushed Yasamin, who was nearby. When Yasamin opened her eyes and saw the words, she too was surprised.
<br><br>
It felt uncomfortable to be soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water for such a long time, and the undercurrents were quite dangerous.
<br><br>
Back then, when the enemies and three sturgeons hunted her down, she had no choice but to enter the undercurrents. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi hadn't found the passage at the bottom of the undercurrents, she would have died a long time ago.
<br><br>
The two of them waited at the bottom of the undercurrents for quite some time. Sometimes, Eastern Emperor Taiyi quietly went out and investigated the situation, but the enemies were extremely patient and did not give them a chance to escape.
<br><br>
The last time he went to the river's surface to check, he almost could not come back because the beasts from the undercurrents attacked him.
<br><br>
Now, the two of them felt somewhat uneasy these days.
<br><br>
How did the Oneness Sky Palace fare since its only two members at the Eternal Realm got trapped? It was very likely that before their opponents killed them on the Other Shore, they had died in the Source World.
<br><br>
They didn't know that both the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill underwent tremendous changes.
<br><br>
Just then, Yasamin fished out a thin needle from her grey hair. Then, she rushed towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi to respond to the words on his arm.
<br><br>
In turn, Eastern Emperor Taiyi glared at her, but he realized that the people in the Source World were watching him. Thus, he had no choice but to let her write on his arm.
<br><br>
"Got it. We'll go up now."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Pear Hill, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Zen perked up when they saw those words.
<br><br>
After all, they could finally have a break if Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin could save themselves in that way.
<br><br>
Of course, the people of the Oneness Sky Palace were more ecstatic.
<br><br>
They had been living in Pear Hill since they arrived in the place.
<br><br>
Even if they couldn't return to the Bloom Divine Province soon, the return of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin still gave them a sense of belonging.
<br><br>
Flamine even had tears in her eyes.
<br><br>
"Let's go back to the Other Shore," said Zen.
<br><br>
"Okay, but we need to be careful," Fuxi said with a nod.
<br><br>
Zen, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan entered the Other Shore again and waited by the Divine River.
<br><br>
After Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin came out of the narrow passage, they followed the undercurrents to the left.
<br><br>
Although the undercurrents here were complicated, Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew them very well.
<br><br>
There were two exits out of the undercurrents. If they missed any of them, then they would get lost.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Fortunately, they found their way out. However, strong currents came at them after they left the two exits.
<br><br>
The currents were so strong that the weaker creatures from the Other Shore couldn't even stand in them.
<br><br>
But since Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were Eternal Realm cultivators, they weren't worried. They slowly moved sideways through the currents. They would reach the river's surface once they crossed the currents, so both of them couldn't help but speed up.
<br><br>
What they didn't know was that Eastern Emperor Taiyi's arm was bleeding.
<br><br>
He had always been a very cautious man. If it had been another time, he would surely heal the wounds first, but now that he knew that they had a chance to escape, he forgot all about it.
<br><br>
There was very little blood that gushed out from the wounds, but some monsters in the undercurrents were highly sensitive.
<br><br>
In the cave below the undercurrents, a large and flat mouth suddenly opened up, then a dark green tongue stuck out from the many rows of sharp teeth.
<br><br>
Even though the blood got diluted in the Soul Interdicting Water and his body was invisible, the dark green beast still targeted him.
<br><br>
Splash! Water whirled like a hurricane, then monsters with spikes emerged out of the cave one after another.
<br><br>
They formed a neat line and swam along with the strong undercurrents.
<br><br>
At that point, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin already came out of the undercurrents and floated upward.
<br><br>
In a few seconds, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had gotten close to the surface of the river. Suddenly, he stopped Yasamin and cautiously looked around.
<br><br>
They knew nothing about the outside world. What if the person who wrote on his arm was not from the Oneness Sky Palace? However, Yasamin didn't think much about it. If their bodies did fall into the hands of the enemy, then the enemy did not have to try hard to lure them out. They could just kill them there.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Eastern Emperor Taiyi slowly surfaced and looked vigilantly at the shore. His trepidation was replaced with joy when he saw Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan.
<br><br>
But, he was confused when he saw a large, fifty-foot-tall creature beside Fuxi. Who was that? Wasn't Zen waiting for him? Where was Zen? "Eastern Emperor Taiyi, you can come up now," King Ieuan said with a smile.
<br><br>
Fuxi also waved at Eastern Emperor Taiyi while the Snake Goddess asked, "Where is Madam Yasamin?"
<br><br>
"I'll ask her to come up as well," Eastern Emperor Taiyi answered.
<br><br>
Then, he looked down into the river as he spoke. His face suddenly changed, and he plunged into the water.
<br><br>
While Yasamin waited for him to confirm the situation on the shore, she suddenly saw him rush towards her. When she looked down, she found a long string of grey, obscure objects. Upon a closer look, she saw more than ten monsters that stayed connected at the ends.
<br><br>
"Giant Turbid Crocodiles!"
<br><br>
The Giant Turbid Crocodiles rarely appeared alone. Every time they appeared, there would be at least a few or even dozens of them. Moreover, they swam close to each other end-to-end. That was why, from a distance, they looked like a big snake under the water.
<br><br>
They were considered powerful predators in undercurrents. Their prey couldn't escape their clutches, and they tore them to pieces and swallowed them up in only a few seconds.
<br><br>
As soon as Yasamin snapped back to her senses, she quickly swam upward, but the Giant Turbid Crocodiles moved very fast. It wasn't long before the Giant Turbid Crocodile in the front bit her.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who had just returned for her, grabbed hold of her body and dragged her up the Divine River.
<br><br>
It was a good thing that he could withstand the power of a Giant Turbid Crocodile, so he could bring Yasamin up to the surface.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, all the other Giant Turbid Crocodiles bit on the tail of the Giant Turbid Crocodile in the front and dragged it down. As a result, Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi sank as well.
<br><br>
The people on the shore didn't know what had happened. Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin did not show up after a long time, but bubbles surged violently from where Eastern Emperor Taiyi dived in. The Snake Goddess began to look worried and said, "Oh no! Are they in trouble?"
<br><br>
Before she could say anything else, Zen took a big step forward and quickly dived into the Divine River.
<br><br>
Chapter 3952 Rescue As Zen rushed into the Divine River, his huge body went against the currents and stirred up hundreds of waves.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Eastern Emperor Taiyi struggled to pull Yasamin upwards.
<br><br>
Just as the two of them continued to fight their way up, he suddenly heard a loud noise above them! Rumble! The sudden loud noise would've struck fear in anyone's heart but Eastern Emperor Taiyi did not feel afraid when he saw it come from the creature that was with Fuxi. This huge creature must have come to help him! Yasamin's leg was bitten and continued to bleed.
<br><br>
Those beasts hiding in the depths of the Divine River no doubt smelled it and circled the waters.
<br><br>
Round, black insects emerged from the muddy soil while a black Dragon Mastiff appeared in the distance.
<br><br>
The Dragon Mastiff was alone but its strength far surpassed that of those Giant Turbid Crocodiles that often hunted in groups.
<br><br>
On the left side of the river was a cave that suddenly opened to let out two palm-sized fish.
<br><br>
Though small, these two seemingly harmless fish were in fact Spirit Sharks that ate ordinary fierce beasts for supper.
<br><br>
When they appeared, the other beasts took it as a sign to retreat lest they make a mistake and provoke them.
<br><br>
Since Eastern Emperor Taiyi couldn't pull Yasamin up, he merely gestured and pointed at her leg which was still in the Giant Turbid Crocodile's mouth.
<br><br>
Yasamin knew what he meant. If she got dragged down into the depths. it would be her end.
<br><br>
With gritted teeth, Yasamin unsheathed a dark-cyan saber from her sleeve, a weapon she often used on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was a trusty saber that she often used to hack her opponents. She never thought there would come a day when she was forced to use it to hack her leg. With a determined look in her eyes, Yasamin swung her blade and cut off her own leg cleanly.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was able to pull her up but those Giant Turbid Crocodiles weren't going to give up so easily.
<br><br>
Spurred by her attempt to escape, the Giant Turbid Crocodiles broke out of formation.
<br><br>
After swallowing up Yasamin's dismembered leg, they quickly rushed towards the two again. It was at that moment that Zen arrived.
<br><br>
Splash! With his big, fan-like hands, he clasped both Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin on the shoulder and pulled them up with all his might.
<br><br>
The two were able to rise with his help but the same couldn't be said for Zen who now sank rapidly underneath the waters.
<br><br>
While he sank, Zen stretched his hands out to the Giant Turbid Crocodiles that awaited him.
<br><br>
These beasts had survived countless life and death struggles in the Divine River. Not only were they powerful, they could also sense danger far away.
<br><br>
Zen exuded a terrifying amount of pressure that the Giant Turbid Crocodiles knew to avoid instinctively.
<br><br>
The moment he appeared, all of them wanted to turn tail. Unfortunately, the Giant Turbid Crocodiles that were near Zen had already fallen into his hands, literally.
<br><br>
The man held the head of a Giant Turbid Crocodile and, with a gentle pinch, smashed it in his hold.
<br><br>
He did this four more times before the other Giant Turbid Crocodiles panicked and turned tail to go back to their home.
<br><br>
Zen had no intention of hunting these creatures so he simply let them go.
<br><br>
When he raised his head, he saw two, palm-sized fish in the distance.
<br><br>
They were like two, sharp arrows that suddenly darted towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi! Zen's eyes immediately narrowed. "They're fast."
<br><br>
Two fist-sized holes appeared on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body as the two fish pierced through him. By the time he realized it, the two fish were already several hundred feet away.
<br><br>
"Spirit Sharks!"
<br><br>
The Soul Interdicting Water posed great resistance and decreased all creatures' speed.
<br><br>
Those two little fish proved to be the exceptions. Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been hiding in the river for a long time and naturally recognized these dangerous predators.
<br><br>
He was no match for them and could only endure the pain as he tried to float to the surface with Yasamin. Blood gurgled on his wounds but it wasn't anything he deemed too serious.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Spirit Sharks were not done. After the initial strike, they turned around and darted back towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi! Rumble! Rumble! This time, even Yasamin was hit. There was no dodging or defending against these Spirit Sharks and their attacks. All they could do was take it.
<br><br>
As the Spirit Sharks prepared their third attack, Zen's body suddenly shook violently and generated numerous bubbles that covered him entirely. This attracted the Spirit Sharks' attention.
<br><br>
When he saw the two fish looking at him, Zen flashed them a gesture that could be interpreted as a clear provocation.
<br><br>
Powerful they might be, these Spirit Sharks weren't very intelligent. They had since been rulers of this place and did not even take members of the Misty River race that seriously.
<br><br>
So how in the world would they take Zen's provocation lightly? With their former prey forgotten, the two Spirit Sharks turned their attention to Zen and immediately darted towards him.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi could only look on in shock. He never expected this huge creature to sacrifice himself just to get the Spirit Sharks off their backs! For a second, he hesitated and thought about going down to help the creature.
<br><br>
However, Yasamin already beat him to a decision as she grabbed hold of his arm and continued to float upwards.
<br><br>
They were too weak to fight and would only end up in that huge creature's way. It was best for them to escape with this window of opportunity they were given.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Soon enough, the two of them broke through the surface and began to swim towards the shore where Fuxi and the Snake Goddess awaited them.
<br><br>
After Fuxi and the Snake Goddess helped them to the shore, their wounds were quickly tended to. Since they were still in the Flaming Maple Forest, the Snake Goddess did not dare to use any theurgy to heal their wounds.
<br><br>
"The guy..." Eastern Emperor Taiyi began. "The guy in the water is besieged by the Spirit Sharks! Which race is he from? Where did you find such a powerful helper? Do you think he'll be okay?"
<br><br>
"Which race?" Fuxi repeated. He and the Snake Goddess exchanged a look but it was King Ieuan who answered.
<br><br>
"That's Zen from the Oneness Sky Palace."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes widened in shock.
<br><br>
"Zen?!" he cried out in disbelief as he stood up in a hurry. The wound that was recently bandaged burst open from his rash action.
<br><br>
He would've never expected that strange creature to be Zen.
<br><br>
His worries also intensified since he realized that the young man was now at the mercy of those Spirit Sharks.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess pressed a hand on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's shoulder and pushed him to sit back down. "Don't you worry now. He'll be fine."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head. "The Spirit Sharks! They'll..."
<br><br>
He wanted to tell them how formidable those two fish were, how scary their powers could be, and that they needed to get Zen out of there immediately.
<br><br>
However, the calm look on their eyes stopped him. It was only then that he realized that the current Zen was now beyond his imagination.
<br><br>
Yasamin smiled beside him. "Has he grown in power after reaching the Eternal Realm?"
<br><br>
Splash! Just as she finished asking her question, a figure suddenly broke through the surface.
<br><br>
Everyone turned around to find Zen holding two fish in his hands: the Spirit Sharks! These formerly terrifying predators struggled above the water but could not escape Zen's hold.
<br><br>
"Eastern Emperor Taiyi!" Zen greeted. "Madam Yasamin!"
<br><br>
As he reached the shore, Zen respectfully bowed to both of them.
<br><br>
"You really are Zen," Eastern Emperor Taiyi muttered in disbelief.
<br><br>
It was quite a sight to see those two Spirit Sharks that had previously wounded him flail around in Zen's hands as the young man looked at him with a visibly relaxed and unbothered face.
<br><br>
Chapter 3953 The Secret Of The Long-haired Monsters It was easy for warriors with an extremely high cultivation base like Zen to change the shape of their bodies. However, Zen didn't just change his body form.
<br><br>
Previously, no one was willing to go into the depths of the Divine River to hunt down Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, because its waters were inhabited by two ferocious Spirit Sharks.
<br><br>
Anyone who got into the water instantly died upon encountering the two Spirit Sharks. No one was exempted! Back then, the members of the Misty River race plotted to kill these two demon-like Spirit Sharks. However, three of their members were put to death while the two Spirit Sharks remained unharmed. In the end, the Misty River race had no other choice but to give up.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the two Spirit Sharks could only stay in the Divine River. The members of the Misty River race were then forbidden to enter this area of the river, keeping them safe.
<br><br>
Many members of other races and Eternal Realm warriors in the Grand Pure Realm had been attacked by the two Spirit Sharks. They were trapped to no escape and swallowed whole.
<br><br>
The hearts of the members of various races and the Eternal Realm warriors pounded hard at the mention of the two fish.
<br><br>
However, why were these two fish at Zen's mercy? Eastern Emperor Taiyi was astounded! He thought highly of Zen, yet he had never expected that he would become so powerful in only a short period.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Zen threw the two Spirit Sharks on the ground while commanding, "Don't move!"
<br><br>
How could the two Spirit Sharks possibly behave? Although they were intelligent and able to understand the words of humans, they were brutal and murderous.
<br><br>
The two Spirit Sharks slammed against the ground as they landed, and then their small bodies quickly blasted out an astonishing force as they jumped into the Divine River.
<br><br>
Clap! Clap! At fast speed, Zen waved his hands, pulling the two little fish back to the ground.
<br><br>
The Spirit Sharks landed on the ground again, this time changing strategies as they drilled into the ground.
<br><br>
The soft soil was an advantage for the Spirit Sharks. They moved smoothly for a while, but Zen's huge fist had already smashed the other side, stopping them.
<br><br>
Bang! The ground caved in, and the two Spirit Sharks were stuck under the squeeze of the soil.
<br><br>
"Don't try to escape or I'll smash you into pieces," Zen threatened them in a deep voice before pulling them out.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked at the two Spirit Sharks and asked Zen, "Why don't you kill them? Why do you keep them with you?"
<br><br>
"These two little fish seem to have a unique way of moving. If I can fuse with them, they must be good Other Shore Tokens," Zen responded.
<br><br>
The eyes of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and King Ieuan lit up, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head and said, "The power from their small bodies is enormous, and the speed at which they swim is very fast. However, such living creatures would rather die than be the Other Shore Tokens."
<br><br>
The two Spirit Sharks could understand the conversation. Their bean-like eyes widened, expressing their resistance. It was as if they would rather die than submit.
<br><br>
"I have a way to make them yield," Zen uttered confidently. "But how can I store them for now?"
<br><br>
There shouldn't be any energy fluctuations in the Flaming Maple Forest, so the space ring couldn't be used. Moreover, the two little fish were powerful Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
"Squeak! I can take care of that," King Ieuan volunteered. It had been staying in the Flaming Maple Forest all year round, so it knew how to handle the matter.
<br><br>
While King Ieuan was dealing with the Spirit Sharks, Eastern Emperor Taiyi finally asked, "Zen, how did you make it to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore so quickly? What about the situation of the Oneness Sky Palace?"
<br><br>
Yasamin's face also reflected her concern. When the two of them were trapped in the Divine River, they were most worried about the Oneness Sky Palace and the seven mountains.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace..." Zen hesitated for a moment and replied, "Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Madam Yasamin, you two being trapped in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore was originally a conspiracy of Yellow Thearch and his fellows. The Sun Crow race had attacked and invaded our Oneness Sky Palace after you were trapped."
<br><br>
Just as they had guessed! Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin looked at each other.
<br><br>
Judging from all the actions of the Sun Crow race before they were trapped on the Other Shore, the two of them had predicted that this race would make an attack.
<br><br>
However, the two of them remained safe and sound, which made them suspect that either the Sun Crow race did not attack, or the Oneness Sky Palace had already won the battle.
<br><br>
Now that Zen had already mentioned this matter, the Oneness Sky Palace was most likely to have won.
<br><br>
Zen reported to Eastern Emperor Taiyi about other details, including the invasion of the Sun Crow race and the death of Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Although Zen narrated those events briefly, the danger and setbacks in them still shocked Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.
<br><br>
"Later on, after I entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer led their people to attack the Oneness Sky Palace. Elder Pearce and Elder Auden had no choice but to give up on the Bloom Divine Province and transfer the elites from the seven mountains to the Pear Hill, but they were stopped halfway..."
<br><br>
During the first half of the battle of the Pear Hill, Zen was also trapped on the Other Shore, like Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin. He didn't know much about the details of the battle. Fuxi then proceeded to tell Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin what had happened.
<br><br>
When they heard about the Black Ship meddling in the battle and the Grandmaster of Heaven being defeated, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin froze. Taken by great surprise, they were almost unable to move.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was previously shocked that Zen had easily taken down two Spirit Sharks, but now he was unable to say a word, even more impressed that Zen had defeated the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Recovering from her shock, Yasamin suddenly realized a problem. "Zen, where is Dora?"
<br><br>
She had heard Zen mention Elvinia several times, but he didn't talk about Dorothy at all.
<br><br>
Since all the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace had moved to the Pear Hill, Dorothy was likely to be among them. Right? However, the hesitation on Zen's face caused Yasamin to worry. She asked again, "What happened to Dorothy, Zen? Tell me right now!"
<br><br>
"Since you got trapped on the Other Shore, Dorothy has disappeared from the Origin Mountain. Uncle Winchell and Aunt Felicity have searched the whole Origin Mountain, but they didn't find her..." Zen replied.
<br><br>
"So Dora isn't in the Pear Hill. Is that what you're saying?" Yasamin asked in a serious tone.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid so..." Zen nodded before a long pause. "Maybe she is figuring out a way to rescue you."
<br><br>
Yasamin stared at Zen angrily. She had asked Zen to take care of Dorothy before, so he had to find answers about Dorothy's disappearance. However, when she saw the remorse on Zen's face, she looked away and took a deep breath. "What way can Dora come up with?"
<br><br>
"There is a door in Dorothy's mind, right?" Zen suddenly asked.
<br><br>
Yasamin had already associated the mystery of Dorothy's disappearance with that door. When she heard Zen mention it, she shifted her eyes back to him. "You... you know that door?"
<br><br>
"I've seen it before. I've seen it once when I entered Stage One of the Other Shore along with Dorothy," said Zen. "I've seen it for the second time after entering the Heavenly Thunder Plain."
<br><br>
At that time, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess also saw the door suddenly appear.
<br><br>
"What's inside it?" Yasamin asked.
<br><br>
Zen answered, "When the door opened, two long-haired monsters emerged.
<br><br>
These monsters were unafraid of the lightning of the Heavenly Thunder Plain. They wanted to drag Human Sovereign into the door, but they failed."
<br><br>
When Yasamin heard about the long-haired monsters, her face had an indifferent expression.
<br><br>
When Dorothy was still a child, Yasamin had entered her mind several times to come into contact with the door. She had seen one monster with long hair, and she had even communicated with it once.
<br><br>
Chapter 3954 An Offer The long-haired monster was cautious. All it asked was for Yasamin to be kind to Dorothy and raise her properly.
<br><br>
Also, it had only revealed that their race was cursed. Though they possessed powerful strength, they still needed Dorothy's help.
<br><br>
As Dorothy grew up, Yasamin grew more and more disgusted with the door.
<br><br>
She did not want Dorothy to be in danger, so she tried her best to keep the door a mystery and warned her to never open it.
<br><br>
"As long as Dorothy doesn't open that door, they won't be able to come out.
<br><br>
Dorothy must have already entered it," Yasamin said in all confidence.
<br><br>
"But why did the door appear in the Heavenly Thunder Plain?" asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes shot up. "If Dorothy could really enter the door and order the monsters, what would she do?"
<br><br>
As they heard what the Snake Goddess said, Zen, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, King Ieuan, and Fuxi all turned to Yasamin.
<br><br>
Since Yasamin was the most important person to Dorothy, it would make sense that Dorothy would use any means to save her.
<br><br>
This way, it would be easy to explain the door's appearance in the Heavenly Thunder Plain. After all, the Heavenly Thunder Plain was right next to the Flaming Maple Forest, and the goal of the monsters would have been to save Yasamin.
<br><br>
Although these were only speculations, Yasamin believed it one hundred percent. She shook her head as she believed Dorothy was a reckless girl.
<br><br>
Within the Flaming Maple Forest, two creatures quietly observed Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
Though they were afraid of Zen's capabilities, they couldn't run away just yet. Otherwise, the Element Spirit Civilization wouldn't let them off so easily.
<br><br>
Moreover, they still had the power to defend themselves if Zen ever attacked.
<br><br>
After Zen eventually left the open space in the forest, the three members of the Misty River race hurriedly left as well. They were led by Larkin.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the other creatures and the Eternal Realm warriors discussed and chattered among themselves.
<br><br>
"That guy's got balls. He doesn't show any respect to Larkin at all."
<br><br>
"I have a bad feeling about this. Let's just watch the show."
<br><br>
"What's wrong? If anything, Hawley will probably appear and kill that guy."
<br><br>
Though Zen displayed unimaginable power, no one there thought highly of him because Hawley was invincible to them.
<br><br>
The Misty River race was located south of the Divine River. All in all, it was the most beautiful area in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
After he rushed back, Larkin headed straight to the village right at the center of their territory.
<br><br>
As the gate of the village opened, he was greeted by a creature covered in black that lay in a large water tank. This was Wheeler, the current leader of the Misty River race and also Larkin's father.
<br><br>
All sorts of bones were soaked in the large water tank. These bones were retrieved from the Divine River, and their quality was much better than that of the Gold and Silver Bone.
<br><br>
Melting bones in water and burning bones with fire were the two known body refining methods of the Misty River race.
<br><br>
However, no fire could be found in the Flaming Maple Forest. Fire was a released energy, which would attract the attacks of the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
The previous leader of the Misty River race wanted to make a breakthrough. In his attempt, he traveled beyond the Flaming Maple Forest to try and burn the bones with fire. However, the moment he stepped out of the forest, he was killed.
<br><br>
"Father, here came an arrogant guy," said Larkin with a gloomy face.
<br><br>
As Wheeler leaned against the tank, he tilted his head and looked intently at his son. "If he was only arrogant, you would have already killed him by now."
<br><br>
If Eternal Realm warriors wanted to flourish in the Flaming Maple Forest, they had to be well aware of their strength. They must make sure not to go against the Misty River race, or they would be doomed.
<br><br>
Zen was so nonchalant about the Misty River race that it could be assumed he had tremendous strength to back him up. He was not only arrogant, but also strong, which was why Larkin made no move.
<br><br>
"You already knew it?" Larkin asked in annoyance.
<br><br>
"There's no need for us to stand up for the Element Spirit Civilization. We benefited from them in exchange for their freedom in the lower reaches.
<br><br>
The other things have nothing to do with us," said Wheeler.
<br><br>
Larkin frowned as he heard this. "But that human brat is so damn arrogant.
<br><br>
How can we swallow all this humiliation?"
<br><br>
"If I say I don't have the confidence to win against him, would you endure it?" Wheeler shot back.
<br><br>
Hearing his father's words, Larkin grew speechless.
<br><br>
He did not expect his father to ever admit weakness, especially to Zen.
<br><br>
"You're telling me you can't defeat him? How is this possible?" Larkin shook his head in disbelief.
<br><br>
Wheeler's tone deepened. "You know, Norris' power was extraordinary.
<br><br>
Even if I wanted to kill him, I couldn't do it so quickly. That brat... There is no need for us to provoke such a powerful opponent."
<br><br>
Hearing this from his father astonished Larkin. It seemed that he couldn't retaliate against what Zen had done to him today.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to leave, the door of the village was pushed open another time. Behind the door stood a creature from another race. His body was covered with bark-like scars.
<br><br>
Larkin knew exactly who this was: Abner, one of Norris' followers. He was the second leader of their group.
<br><br>
As he entered the village, Abner bowed before Wheeler and Larkin. Before he could say anything, Wheeler cut him off, "If the Eye Spirit wants me to deal with that bloke from the human race, you can show yourself out right now."
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, Abner shook his head in disagreement. "The Eye Spirit doesn't want you to make a move."
<br><br>
Larkin stared coldly at Abner. "Then what are you doing here?"
<br><br>
"The Eye Spirit wants Hawley to make a move," Abner continued to explain.
<br><br>
As soon as Wheeler heard this, a light flashed his eyes. Within a second, Larkin grabbed Abner by the collar and said coldly, "You bastard! Do you know what you are talking about?"
<br><br>
The most powerful member of the Misty River race was not Wheeler. It was Hawley.
<br><br>
Though Hawley never led the Misty River race, he was still regarded as a legend. It was because of his existence that the Misty River race in the Flaming Maple Forest was well respected.
<br><br>
It was said that Hawley accidentally discovered a burnt arm in the Divine River. At that time, he was not so strong, so he tried his luck with the river.
<br><br>
Not knowing where the arm came from, Hawley swallowed it.
<br><br>
After that, Hawley's strength increased dramatically. This was also the reason the Misty River race ruled over the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
"The Eye Spirit wanting Hawley to make a move is stupid and arrogant,"
<br><br>
Wheeler said. He waved his hand to calm Larkin down. "What do we get in return?"
<br><br>
Abner smiled, "The Eye Spirit will permit the Flaming Maple Forest to expand southwest by one hundred thousand miles."
<br><br>
Bang! Just then, the big water tank that Wheeler was soaked in burst with a loud bang and water gushed out from the cracks. Larkin shot a look at Abner in surprise.
<br><br>
"Really?" Wheeler asked.
<br><br>
"The Eye Spirit always keeps his promises." Abner nodded.
<br><br>
The Misty River race had only a handful of members and their strength was considered mediocre in the Grand Pure Realm. Everything they had achieved today relied on the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
The expansion of the Flaming Maple Forest meant the expansion of their scope of influence.
<br><br>
To expand one hundred thousand miles to the southwest would be a huge advantage. Then they would be able to reach the boundary of the second realm of Three Purities Stage, otherwise known as the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
This was an offer the Misty River race could not refuse.
<br><br>
Chapter 3955 Hawley Within the Flaming Maple Forest lay the Misty River race's territory— many of the people in the Three Purities Stage believed so.
<br><br>
As did the young men like Larkin from the Misty River race.
<br><br>
But as the Misty River race's leader, Wheeler was sure that this was false.
<br><br>
After the former leader's death, Hawley designated Wheeler to the open position, telling him that the real master of the Flaming Maple Forest was the motionless Flaming Maple Trees, not the actual members of the Misty River race.
<br><br>
These people were merely creatures living in the Flaming Maple Forest and everything they had obtained was bestowed upon them by the forest.
<br><br>
If he found any chance to expand the Flaming Maple Forest, Wheeler would seize it without question.
<br><br>
But expanding the Flaming Maple Forest was an extremely difficult task.
<br><br>
On its south side lay the Heavenly Thunder Plain. If the Flaming Maple Forest extended to that plain, it would only turn to ashes under the powerful thunderbolts. On its east side was the cold land, a place unsuitable for trees to grow.
<br><br>
The southwest side remained the most suitable area, meaning that it could expand along the Divine River to its upper reaches.
<br><br>
In the past, the Flaming Maple Forest had also expanded in such a way, but at a certain point, it was discovered by the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The latter then poisoned the southwest soil, making the land toxic across twenty miles. The poisonous land was an insurmountable natural chasm for the Flaming Maple Forest—any seeds and roots instantly decayed once they drilled into the soil.
<br><br>
When the Misty River race attempted to negotiate with the Element Spirit Civilization, they were refused. Since the last leader was killed, they figured that the latter would forbid the expansion of the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
Now that the Element Spirit Civilization took the initiative to mention so, Wheeler had no choice but to accept.
<br><br>
Having seen through Wheeler's thoughts, Abner said nothing more and left.
<br><br>
Standing up, Wheeler wiped his body dry and turned to Larkin. "I'm going to see Hawley."
<br><br>
The Soul Interdicting Water on the bodies of Zen, Yasamin, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi dried up and its effect disappeared, allowing the people to withdraw from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Flamine, Pearce, Auden and the other masters of the Oneness Sky Palace were all aware that it was a moment of great importance, so they waited aside. Elvinia, who had been cultivating, also came over.
<br><br>
After waiting for so long, there was no news from the Other Shore. Of course, everyone was getting anxious.
<br><br>
At this point, Zen was the first to retreat from the Other Shore before waking up immediately.
<br><br>
"Zen, how is my father?"
<br><br>
Elvinia asked, taking the first step forward. But as she spoke, Yasamin coughed twice from nearby and woke up as well, followed by Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"Madam Yasamin!"
<br><br>
"Eastern Emperor Taiyi..."
<br><br>
"Father..."
<br><br>
The strong warriors of the Oneness Mountain and the Origin Mountain gathered around.
<br><br>
Since Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were trapped, the Oneness Sky Palace lost their mainstay. Many believed that the two had no chance of ever waking up again.
<br><br>
But now that the two had returned safe and sound, the strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace were all ecstatic.
<br><br>
Both Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin had been soaked in the Divine River for a long time, leaving them to suffer greatly. Coming back and seeing their families and subordinates safe and sound, they were all happy and excited.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace people were all looking forward to being taken back to the Bloom Divine Province by Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Several elders of the Oneness Mountain proposed the idea immediately.
<br><br>
The Bloom Divine Province served as a foundation for the Oneness Sky Palace. The cities at the foot of the seven mountains and by the Clear Lake were all closely linked to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
While the Pear Hill treated them very well, many of them still longed to return to the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
After a moment of thought, Eastern Emperor Taiyi refused the request for the time being.
<br><br>
While they won the battle of the Pear Hill, the era was far from those in the past.
<br><br>
Both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization had the means to descend to this world.
<br><br>
The time when only one Eternal Realm warrior could protect an entire race was gone forever.
<br><br>
If Eastern Emperor Taiyi brought his people back to the Bloom Divine Province, he might be unable to protect the Oneness Sky Palace and in turn destroy the Bloom Diving Province.
<br><br>
Now the superpowers that supported the Finale Way were gathering in the Pear Hill. It merely wasn't the right time to return.
<br><br>
After Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin had a brief meeting with the people from Oneness Sky Palace, they returned to the Other Shore again.
<br><br>
The Flaming Maple Forest was clearly far from a safe place—the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and Zen had been forcibly pulled to the Other Shore before, after all, so Zen had to take them out of there at any cost.
<br><br>
After everyone managed to return to the Other Shore, they followed Zen.
<br><br>
When moving across the open area by the Divine River, they could all feel a strong vibration from the ground. Huge creatures were surely approaching.
<br><br>
"Squeak… It seems troublesome," said King Ienuan.
<br><br>
It was well aware of the Misty River race's personality—it knew they would refuse to give up.
<br><br>
It wasn't only Zen and his companions that felt uneasy. The rest of the Eternal Realm warriors and the members of the alien races all seemed upset. The tremors from the ground indicated that the Misty River race made a great move.
<br><br>
Soon, Abner appeared, a few nonhuman creatures following behind him.
<br><br>
These warriors stared at Zen as though they were looking upon a corpse.
<br><br>
Abner, in particular, was wearing a strange smile as he proceeded.
<br><br>
"I see they've found some powerful reinforcement," Zen muttered to himself with a sneer.
<br><br>
Boom, boom, boom...
<br><br>
As the tremors grew closer, many members of Misty River race appeared, covered in bronze powder.
<br><br>
Their race didn't have many people, and it seemed that most of them had already come.
<br><br>
Bang, bang! With his black and cyan skin, Wheeler stood before Zen showing no sign of contempt. Instead, his demeanor seemed ready for a negotiation. "You're no match for the Element Spirit Civilization," he said. "If you surrender obediently and leave the Flaming Maple Forest, you will not have to suffer any pain or trouble. I can also guarantee that these people will be safe and sound."
<br><br>
He pointed at King Ieuan, Fuxi, and the rest as he spoke.
<br><br>
To him, the conditions he just proposed were already very generous. If Zen was sensible, he would agree.
<br><br>
But Zen merely curled his lips at the other. "Did the Element Spirit Civilization tell you to say that? They've said the same many times."
<br><br>
Zen figured that the power he used to kill Norris was enough to intimidate the Misty River race.
<br><br>
His provocation made it impossible for the Misty River race to attack.
<br><br>
There was only one possibility remained—the Element Spirit Civilization asked the Misty River race to make a move by promising them great benefits.
<br><br>
"What do you think?" Wheeler pressed again.
<br><br>
"I've never compromised and I don't intend to do so now," Zen said in return, shrugging his shoulders.
<br><br>
Regret washed over Wheeler's face. "Then you will never even get a chance to compromise. You'll die and lie in the Flaming Maple Forest forever, and your flesh and blood will become nourishment for the forest."
<br><br>
"Can you kill me by yourself?" Zen asked, his voice lowered.
<br><br>
"That's too easy for Master Wheeler!"
<br><br>
"If you die here, no one will bother to bury your body!"
<br><br>
"When Master Wheeler tears you to pieces, you'll learn to not be so stubborn!"
<br><br>
The crowd began clamoring upon witnessing Zen's arrogance.
<br><br>
But Wheeler merely shook his head and admitted, "I can't defeat you."
<br><br>
The words had the rest of the Misty River race swallow their words and go silent. Even the rest of the Eternal Realm warriors and the many races in the forest's open space were rather surprised. It was a shock to hear Wheeler admit that he couldn't defeat this human being.
<br><br>
But then Wheeler took a step back, as if to make way for something. "But he should be able to do that for me."
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
A great figure of over a hundred feet tall emerged from the forest. The man was dark all over, staring at Zen, his eyes gleaming with ferocity.
<br><br>
Chapter 3956 The Confrontation Of Two Strong Warriors Suddenly, the open space in the forest had become very quiet, and everyone's focus shifted towards the gigantic black body.
<br><br>
"That's not the leader of the Misty River race. Who is that guy?" someone asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>
"I don't know. I haven't seen him before."
<br><br>
"But how could this be? His aura is much stronger than Wheeler's."
<br><br>
Hawley hadn't shown up in the Flaming Maple Forest for many years. That was why the newcomers had no idea who he was.
<br><br>
However, when some of the long-time residents realized that it was him, they immediately knew that things were about to get extremely troublesome.
<br><br>
"Hawley really came out?"
<br><br>
"What condition did the Element Spirit Civilization offer to summon him? Are they that desperate?"
<br><br>
"It's been such a long time. Things are about to get rowdy."
<br><br>
In the Misty River race, Hawley held a revered reputation. Since he had personally come out to deal with the situation, it meant that it really was a big deal.
<br><br>
The creatures and Eternal Realm warriors that had been staying in the Flaming Maple Forest for a long time had sharp and experienced eyes.
<br><br>
When they saw how Zen dealt with Norris with such ease, they discerned that he did have the qualifications to contend against Wheeler. However, Hawley was a different kind of beast. Even with the surprising strength that Zen had displayed, they still didn't think that he had a chance against Hawley.
<br><br>
On the other hand, they also didn't expect that Wheeler would directly turn to Hawley without even fighting Zen.
<br><br>
At the moment, Zen already felt a little uncomfortable being on the receiving end of Hawley's hostile stares. He looked back with his own fierce gaze and slightly smiled. "What's the matter? Aren't you going to persuade me first?" Zen asked indifferently.
<br><br>
"No," Hawley answered with a sneer. "I won't do such a boring thing."
<br><br>
His voice was so dry and hoarse, like the sound of breaking withered crisp leaves.
<br><br>
"I like fighting," Hawley continued. "It's just a pity that I've become too powerful that no one wanted to fight me anymore. But finally, a worthy opponent came." Hawley looked at Zen with a piercing gaze. "There's no way I'll let this opportunity pass."
<br><br>
Hawley's entire body was pitch black. However, his eyes shone brightly, like a pair of shimmering stars in the dark sky.
<br><br>
As the words came out of his mouth, everyone could feel his aggressive fighting spirit spreading out.
<br><br>
Anyone who made eye contact with him would feel the rapid circulation of their blood, the acceleration of their heartbeat, and the heat coming off from their eyes. This was the natural instinct of fearing for one's own life.
<br><br>
Even Zen felt his heart pounding. However, for him, it was more of a thrill than fear. There was an inexplicable desire arising from his inner being.
<br><br>
He then turned around and asked his companions, "Will you leave the Other Shore or stay here?"
<br><br>
The most logical and safest thing to do was to leave the Other Shore. Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others knew that Zen was facing a life and death kind of test in the Three Purities Stage. Obviously, it would be extremely difficult and dangerous, so they could actually leave before it was too late.
<br><br>
However, without hesitation, the Snake Goddess answered on behalf of them, "We'll stay here with you."
<br><br>
The others nodded in agreement, and showed no intention of backing out.
<br><br>
They had risked their lives to fight for their current strength and status.
<br><br>
Besides, they were all confident in Zen's strength.
<br><br>
"Enough talking," Hawley said in a low voice.
<br><br>
Crash! With a light stomp of his foot, the whole open space in the forest trembled violently.
<br><br>
As he gathered all his energy into his arms and hands, his muscles suddenly bulged.
<br><br>
Then, the rest of his body also swelled up. The muscles on his shoulders almost enveloped his head. "Let me see your strongest physical form, human," he said.
<br><br>
"My strongest physical form? You're already looking at it," Zen said with a straight face.
<br><br>
His physical body was given by the ancestry-level bloodline, and there was nothing that he could do about it.
<br><br>
"What?" Hawley couldn't help but chuckle loudly. "If that's the case, then you've already lost!"
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, his black figure suddenly disappeared and quickly flashed in front of Zen.
<br><br>
As a rule, no theurgy could be used within the Flaming Maple Forest, which meant Hawley wouldn't be able to use the Grand Teleportation technique.
<br><br>
However, his physical speed was so fast that it seemed like he teleported himself to reach in front of Zen.
<br><br>
"So fast!"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened as he was caught off guard. There was no time to think so he just instinctively took a step backward.
<br><br>
Bang! Just a split second after, Hawley's huge fist smashed onto the ground.
<br><br>
A moment after, everyone saw the crater that appeared on the ground.
<br><br>
Fortunately for Zen, he was able to dodge at the last second. If not, his bones would have been crushed by that impact.
<br><br>
However, Hawley was just getting started. Zen immediately saw the look on his face, saying that he might not get lucky the next time. With that, Hawley instantly disappeared again and launched several successive punches.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! Several holes quickly appeared on the ground and on the trunks of the trees.
<br><br>
Zen and Hawley seemed to transform into two dancing shadows that flew everywhere. Not everyone could track their movements with their naked eyes.
<br><br>
Within a few minutes, the ground within the radius of a hundred miles was in chaos. It was like small meteorites and asteroids rained on it.
<br><br>
However, the roots of the Flaming Maple Trees were all over the forest.
<br><br>
They just absorbed Hawley's power and continued to maintain the inner stability of the forest.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Hawley continued to shower Zen with his massive punches, but the latter hadn't thrown a single strike yet.
<br><br>
The two maintained a distance of several feet, and it didn't seem that they became exhausted.
<br><br>
"I have to admit, your speed is fascinating." Hawley's eyes revealed the sincerity of his remark. "But the result is so obvious if you just keep dodging and running!"
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! Hawley launched another barrage of powerful attacks.
<br><br>
The truth was Zen was still just relying on his body's instinctive reaction to evade Hawley's attacks. However, with Hawley's quick-wittedness and familiarity of the place, he eventually forced Zen into a corner. It was too late when Zen realized that his back was against three tall Flaming Maple Trees, and this time, it wouldn't be easy to get out of that spot.
<br><br>
"Damn it! I was careless! There's no other way. I need to go up!"
<br><br>
Zen's feet sank on the ground as he exerted his strength on his lower body.
<br><br>
He used his legs as a spring so that he could rush upwards.
<br><br>
However, Hawley had all things calculated. When he drove Zen into that corner, he already expected what he would try to do.
<br><br>
The moment Zen's feet left the ground, Hawley rushed straight and threw a massive punch on his chest.
<br><br>
Crash! A great force exploded in Zen's chest, shattering his bones. His entire body was smashed and embedded into the trunks of the Flaming Maple Trees behind him.
<br><br>
"For all your arrogance before, that's the best that you could do?" Hawley stared at him with a disappointed face.
<br><br>
"Well, it's over."
<br><br>
"You still got to give the human some props. His body didn't even explode after taking a direct hit from Hawley!"
<br><br>
"Hawley's just too powerful. End of discussion."
<br><br>
With Hawley's physical strength, there was no doubt that he would stand at the peak of the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
However, he was afraid that the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race would join hands to kill him. Thus, walking out of the Flaming Maple Forest was not an option for him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others fell silent as they nervously stared at Zen's current situation.
<br><br>
There was no way that they could join a vicious battle of physical strength, so they were left with no choice but to place their hopes and trust on him.
<br><br>
Just when Hawley turned away, Zen's body, which was still embedded in the trunks of the trees, slightly moved. He coughed and spat a mouthful of blood. However, the blood quickly bounced from the ground and returned to his mouth.
<br><br>
When the creatures watching saw this scene, they were shocked and confused at the same time. Soon after, Zen seemed to have regained his consciousness.
<br><br>
"I apologize. You haven't enjoyed yourself to the fullest yet. I should not fall down that quickly, right?" As Zen spoke, he slammed both his arms against the Flaming Maple Trees to push himself out. Then, like a ferocious shooting star, he struck his head on Hawley.
<br><br>
Crash! Caught off guard by Zen's sudden attack, Hawley was hit hard.
<br><br>
However, his head was indestructible. If it was someone weaker than him, his head might have instantly exploded into pieces.
<br><br>
While Hawley was still in a daze, Zen took advantage of the opportunity and launched his counterattack. With that, countless fist shadows emerged and poured on Hawley's body like torrential rain.
<br><br>
Chapter 3957 Nurture Zen's body, strengthened by the ancestry-level bloodline, displayed an astonishing explosive power! As each punch landed on Hawley's body, power waves burst in all directions while the Flaming Maple Trees that surrounded them swayed crazily.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
The warriors from various races and the Eternal Realm warriors all hid behind the Flaming Maple Trees as they watched the battle. They were all shocked at the sight of the intense battle.
<br><br>
"The power of this tall human is so terrifying!"
<br><br>
"Yes, Wheeler was right in his judgment. This human is stronger than him."
<br><br>
"But no matter how powerful this person is, he still cannot hurt Hawley..."
<br><br>
they talked among themselves.
<br><br>
During the long time that the Misty River race had controlled the Flaming Maple Forest, many races wanted to eradicate them and had devised various plans.
<br><br>
The most powerful ones among them were naturally the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Because of their unique form, the Element Spirit Civilization couldn't enter the Flaming Maple Forest to fight. However, with a huge amount of resources of the Three Purities Stage in their hands, they were capable of using special methods.
<br><br>
Once upon a time, the Element Spirit Civilization created a powerful Dark Blood Puppet. This puppet was personally created by the Eye Spirit consuming a lot of precious resources of the Element Spirit Civilization. Its strength exceeded that of any ordinary member of the Misty River race.
<br><br>
However, Hawley had effortlessly smashed it into little pieces only in the first round of the fight.
<br><br>
Since then, the Element Spirit Civilization realized that they should never try to attack the Misty River race in the Flaming Maple Forest ever again.
<br><br>
The Nihility race had also made similar attempts. Because they knew Hawley was powerful and was the most difficult to deal with, they had targeted him from the very beginning.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven created a clone of himself and hid it in the Golden Body Pool of the Supreme Pure Realm. After a few years, the clone went to the Flaming Maple Forest alone to challenge Hawley.
<br><br>
The Nihility race set up a more challenging contest with Hawley than the Element Spirit Civilization. The clone of the Grandmaster of Heaven relied on its excellent bodily movements and endured fighting for several rounds.
<br><br>
However, even though the clone was extremely fast, its attacking method was inefficient to break through Hawley's defense. In the end, only a single punch from Hawley brutally tore it straight into defeat.
<br><br>
From then on, no one had foolishly dared to challenge him.
<br><br>
Hawley usually defeated his opponents with one blow. Most of the warriors from the various races and the Eternal Realm warriors thought that there was no need for him to strike a second time to kill his opponent–but in his fight with Zen, the unexpected occurred. Zen had not only withstood Hawley's first blow but also possessed combat power to counterattack.
<br><br>
However, such a counterattack was in vain.
<br><br>
Hawley didn't dodge. Receiving the hits from Zen's fist, he was forced to retreat. His legs plowed two ditches on the ground, but his face didn't change at all. There was evident mockery in his eyes.
<br><br>
"Your body is tough yet your strength is too weak," Hawley said proudly, shaking his head.
<br><br>
Realizing that the attack at this level was useless on Hawley, Zen stopped and said, "Do you hear that? You are too weak."
<br><br>
Zen's words confused Hawley. Who was he talking to? Wasn't he alone? Of course he didn't know that Zen was talking to the ancestry-level bloodline...
<br><br>
Soon, Zen felt the blood in his body rolling like waves. The ancestry-level bloodline knew that energy could not be used in the Flaming Maple Forest, so it surged in a strange way to protest. It sent a special message to Zen through its emotion–I could become stronger, it seemed to declare.
<br><br>
The emotion was inexpressible in words, but Zen deciphered it.
<br><br>
"Since you admit that you are weak, you must also understand the fate of the weak," Hawley said as he opened his arms.
<br><br>
"Of course, I understand," replied Zen, "but you have to wait for a moment." He smiled teasingly.
<br><br>
Zen began to chant the Illusion Breaking Rune. This triggered the attack of Flaming Maple Forest, causing several maple leaves to light up and shoot towards him; but as soon as he finished speaking, his body suddenly disappeared.
<br><br>
Just as before, Zen was gone before the maple leaves exploded.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin all joined in chanting the Illusion Breaking Rune and instantly escaped from the Other Shore. Their action caused a more violent response from the maple leaves.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Some of the maple leaves exploded in front of Hawley but he didn't move, remaining unafraid of them.
<br><br>
"Wait for a moment?" murmured Hawley.
<br><br>
"He must have run away! They can't escape. I'll find a member of the Gear race and drag them back here!" exclaimed Abner as he came forward.
<br><br>
Norris was a member of the Gear race, and pulling the creatures from the chaos back to the Other Shore was one of their theurgies. Moreover, similar theurgies on the Three Purities Stage were not exclusive to the members of the Gear race. It was easy for the Element Spirit Civilization to seek help from others.
<br><br>
"He asked me to wait for him. He will be back," Hawley said coldly as he looked at Abner.
<br><br>
"Master Hawley, these rats will definitely hide in the chaos and dare not to return. I will drag them back before their shadows disappear..."
<br><br>
Hawley threw Abner a deadly look before he could finish his words.
<br><br>
Abner didn't dare continue, his legs trembling as he took a few steps back.
<br><br>
When he retreated to Wheeler's side, Wheeler sneered, "If you have said one more word, you wouldn't have had the chance to stand here. Hawley doesn't need you to tell him what to do."
<br><br>
Hawley stood there motionless. The atmosphere turned gloomy in the open space where the warriors of various races and Eternal Realm warriors gathered. At Hawley's presence, no one dared to look for treasures in the Divine River. Everyone waited by Wheeler's side.
<br><br>
At the Pear Hill...
<br><br>
The faces of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yasamin, and the Eastern Emperor Taiyi had darkened after they returned to the Source World.
<br><br>
Having learned from previous experience, they were aware that even if they returned to the chaos, they still wouldn't be safe.
<br><br>
The four of them looked at Zen. He looked at his body and warned them, "Everyone, take a step back..."
<br><br>
Zen's belly suddenly swelled into the shape of a large ball.
<br><br>
The temperature in his huge belly increased rapidly, almost like that of a furnace...
<br><br>
Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who was standing slightly further, could only retreat as the heat became unbearable. The Snake Goddess approached the Holy Soul Realm warriors around them. She quickly dispersed the warriors and led them out of the palace.
<br><br>
Not long after they retreated, the palace walls collapsed because of the extreme temperature.
<br><br>
A small dazzling sun rose from the ruins of the palace, and at the center of the sun was a black dot.
<br><br>
"Is there... a freak in Zen's belly?" Elvinia looked at the scene from a distance.
<br><br>
"I don't know what's in there, but it must be something that can make him stronger..." Eastern Emperor Taiyi replied, also shocked by the odd sight.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess looked very serious.
<br><br>
They had seen Zen strengthen his body many times. He had completely changed out of human form after several transformations, so they were calmer than the others upon witnessing such a scene.
<br><br>
This time, it seemed difficult to deal with Hawley as Zen had made a greater move to strengthen his body.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Floating in the air, Zen felt that the ancestry-level bloodline in his body was consistently flowing towards his stomach. He stared at the black dot in confusion. 'Is this a pill?' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Zen faintly understood that Hawley was very powerful. If the ancestry-level bloodline wanted to continue strengthening his body, it was to use more complicated methods.
<br><br>
However, the thought of nurturing a pill in his belly while everyone gazed still left Zen speechless.
<br><br>
Chapter 3958 Beaten The light from the sun-like object glowed for an hour...
<br><br>
As the light faded away, Zen's round belly also gradually returned to normal.
<br><br>
However, the pill was still in Zen's stomach. Just as Zen wondered about what the ancestry-level bloodline would do with the pill, the pill suddenly melted into Zen's body.
<br><br>
Zen suddenly felt like there were thousands of needles wandering about his meridians at lightning speed. The pain made Zen's face darken. It was so excruciating that he couldn't help but let out a low growl.
<br><br>
The pain gradually dissipated when the pill completely fused into Zen's body, but at the same time, Zen also obtained a strange body! The skin covering his body had turned blue and translucent. His muscles, blood vessels, and even bones had turned into some kind of extremely solid crystals. Among all, the color of his bones was the darkest, while the color of his muscles was the second darkest...
<br><br>
Zen raised his hand and examined it carefully. His dark blue fingernails were shining, and there was a strong, heavy force circulating around his limbs and bones...
<br><br>
"How are you feeling now?" asked Fuxi.
<br><br>
"Good—it feels like I've opened up a new world," Zen replied with a smile.
<br><br>
"Are you sure you can defeat Hawley?" the Snake Goddess could not help but ask. This was the most crucial issue after all.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "I'm not sure."
<br><br>
The theurgy and the power the ancestry-level bloodline gave to Zen were extremely unstable. Although they were very strong, it was difficult for Zen to gauge how strong they were, so he naturally could not be sure about whether or not he could defeat Hawley.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, considering the nature of the ancestry-level bloodline which could practically construct everything, in case it intended to let Zen defeat an opponent, it would definitely provide him with enough strength to do so.
<br><br>
"Then… shall we go back to the Other Shore now?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked solemnly.
<br><br>
"Yes, let's go!"
<br><br>
Zen replied affirmatively and then landed on the ruins of the palace. He then summoned the Truth of Godly Way and returned directly to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan were all people who had experienced many battles. They all returned to the Other Shore with Zen without any hesitation in the slightest.
<br><br>
In the Flaming Maple Forest, Hawley was still standing there like an iron tower, staring ahead motionlessly.
<br><br>
The members of the various races, as well as the Eternal Realm warriors waiting under the Flaming Maple Trees in the distance, were all whispering among themselves… "Almost four hours have passed!"
<br><br>
"They're courting death if they come back. Those humans aren't stupid."
<br><br>
"It's just a waste of time to wait like this..."
<br><br>
"Shut up!"
<br><br>
Larkin stepped forward and scolded.
<br><br>
Although Larkin also felt that it was impossible for Zen and his companions to come back, he still had to uphold Hawley's prestige and stop these people from gossiping.
<br><br>
The other members of the Misty River race were still waiting alongside Hawley. All of them looked solemn.
<br><br>
At this moment, a huge creature suddenly appeared not far from Hawley.
<br><br>
Compared to his state before he withdrew from the Other Shore, it was obvious from his current state that Zen had undergone a great change. The huge, translucent, blue crystal figure was completely different from how Zen looked like before.
<br><br>
"Are you ready?" Hawley asked.
<br><br>
He remembered Zen's aura, so he immediately recognized that this huge creature was the human boy just now. He did not make any comment about it, but he was, in fact, also a little baffled to see the mystical changes that had occurred in Zen's body.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Zen.
<br><br>
"You've wasted my time, and that makes you more sinful. Then... you can go to hell now!"
<br><br>
As Hawley spoke, his huge fist was already swung towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his crystal-like right hand, and the two huge forces soon collided with a sharp clang.
<br><br>
The ground under Zen's feet instantly sank, and almost half of his body was forced into the ground. Nevertheless, he managed to withstand Hawley's attack! "Blocked! He blocked it!"
<br><br>
"This is the first time someone has managed to block Hawley's attack!"
<br><br>
"Does that human really have such a strong body?"
<br><br>
Previously, the fact that Zen was still alive and kicking after taking the blow from Hawley had already shocked all the warriors present here.
<br><br>
Now, he could block Hawley's attack right after he came back? In their astonishment, their eyes had grown as wide as saucers.
<br><br>
This meant that Zen had the power to fight against Hawley! A trace of amazement also flashed in Hawley's eyes. He began to fight seriously, flinging punch after punch towards Zen.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Although his attack speed was not fast, his incessant attacks landed at a stable pace all along.
<br><br>
Every time Zen took a blow, he would be forced to take a step back. The ground under him was constantly shaking as if there was an earthquake.
<br><br>
But there was something interesting in this whole situation—those Flaming Maple Trees remained firm on the ground. They were neither breaking nor collapsing despite the fact that the ground was quaking.
<br><br>
"Zen's body has become stronger again!" the Snake Goddess said astounded.
<br><br>
"I really want to know—what kind of bloodline has he fused with that he can become so powerful in such a short time?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi said with a tone that was full of appreciation and curiosity.
<br><br>
If they were to face Hawley, they probably could not withstand even onetenth of the power in Hawley's punch.
<br><br>
Zen steadily retreated. His hands acted like two pieces of shields that blocked all Hawley's attacks.
<br><br>
After blocking more than thirty punches in a row, Zen had once again arrived in front of the three adjacent Flaming Maple Trees. This time, he did not choose to escape.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of the moment Hawley threw out a punch, Zen leaped back, and his legs stepped on the trunk of a Flaming Maple Tree. Using the tree trunk as his footing, he propelled his body forward and pounced straight on Hawley.
<br><br>
Not only did he dodge Hawley's punch, but he even spread out his arms and used both of them to launch an even fiercer attack towards Hawley! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! In the blink of an eye, Zen had launched eight punches.
<br><br>
Eight deep dents appeared on Hawley's broad chest, and eight huge fist marks protruded from his back.
<br><br>
At this moment, Zen and Hawley were equally stunned! Generally speaking, receiving such powerful attacks, the attacked person would surely be thrown backward. As they flew back, they could offset a considerable amount of power that they received.
<br><br>
Now, Hawley just stood motionless in his original spot. That meant he had forcefully taken the power of Zen's eight punches! However, there was nothing under his feet that could anchor him to the ground. It ought to be impossible for him to stand still and continue to receive Zen's attack head-on...
<br><br>
Was this a special theurgy his body possessed? Zen was baffled.
<br><br>
"An impressive attack," Hawley praised after spitting out a mouthful of black blood.
<br><br>
Hawley felt like there was another force that fixed him on the spot when Zen threw his punches. He was just like a target that could not move.
<br><br>
Despite Hawley's impressive strength, his body would inevitably be injured upon directly receiving those punches.
<br><br>
Larkin, Wheeler, and the other members of the Misty River race were all watching this scene in horror.
<br><br>
They almost could not believe their eyes. The undefeatable, almost invincible Hawley was actually being beaten by a human and got injured to the point he spat out blood! Right now, nothing could be more frightening than this in this world! The warriors from other races and the Eternal Realm warriors also gasped in astonishment.
<br><br>
They were both shocked and ecstatic.
<br><br>
It would be great news for them if this human kid could really kill Hawley! "How about taking a few more punches?"
<br><br>
Zen did not hesitate. With a slight shake of his body, fierce fist radiance was shot towards Hawley from all directions.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! The punches created a series of dull thuds. If one looked carefully, they would see that after each punch hit Hawley, there was a slight tremor in his body. It was as if the space had been disrupted.
<br><br>
Chapter 3959 The Second Form The space at Hawley's front and back was misplaced, and he became caught in an invisible wall.
<br><br>
He couldn't retreat, neither could he advance, nor dodge. He was forced to bear the brunt of Zen's fists head on! In the forest glade, some Eternal Realm warriors who had the sharpest eyes were able to see what was unfolding before them. The astonishment in their eyes intensified.
<br><br>
"Did the human just utilize a space theurgy?" one of the creatures questioned in utter shock.
<br><br>
The phenomenon of overlapped spaces was quite similar to that created by many of the space theurgies.
<br><br>
However, they knew using space theurgy involved the facilitation of energy, which was forbidden in this area. If Zen had used a space theurgy, the maple leaves in the Flaming Maple Forest would already have launched their attack on him.
<br><br>
It was common knowledge that these maple leaves possessed a miraculous feature. They would pursue their targets with a relentless speed to the very ends of the world.
<br><br>
In the past, someone had used a theurgy at the edge of the Flaming Maple Forest and had triggered the attack of the maple leaves before fleeing at full speed. About thirty seconds later, though, the maple leaves had easily caught up with their target and exploded.
<br><br>
Others had used the spatial transference at the edge of the Flaming Maple Forest to cross a great distance in a single breath. However, the maple leaves still had caught up with them within a mere thirty seconds. It appeared that the distance had no effect on the leaves' pursuit time.
<br><br>
Up till now, the only known way to avoid the maple leaves' attack was to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It seemed that it was virtually impossible for the maple leaves to reach beyond the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"It didn't look like a space theurgy," another creature commented, shaking his head. "It was a unique wave of power. One so formidable that it was able to manipulate the space in an unexpected manner!"
<br><br>
"I didn't know the human race possessed someone of that genius!" another warrior shouted in utter shock.
<br><br>
At this time, an Eternal Realm warrior who had just come here from the Grand Plain Stage said, "He must be the famous Zen. Both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization have offered tempting rewards to recruit him, but he refused them both."
<br><br>
Zen was famous in the Grand Plain Stage. All the forces coveted his great potential and extraordinary talent.
<br><br>
When the ensemble heard of Zen's background, their eyes soon filled with envy.
<br><br>
In addition to the indigenous races that inhabited in the Three Purities Stage, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race were regarded as the strongest. With the protection of these two forces, many things would become greatly simplified.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Under Zen's continuous assault, Hawley found almost no chance to strike back.
<br><br>
Dents constantly formed on the surface of his dark black body. Zen's fists had such formidable force that the punches penetrated through his body, causing his back to bulge.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before Hawley's body was raked with wounds. His arms and legs became contorted and misshapen, and he was powerless to support his body.
<br><br>
However, the space walls Zen had created with his attacks fixed Hawley to the spot. It wasn't until Zen withdrew his fists that Hawley finally collapsed to his knees.
<br><br>
Hawley's large, distended body slumped forward to the ground like a heap of mud. He looked miserable.
<br><br>
A deafening silence roared through the air of the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
Wheeler and the other warriors from Misty River race stared blankly at Hawley lying on the ground, utterly bewildered.
<br><br>
They found it difficult to comprehend what was unfolding before their eyes, and they wondered if it was a dream.
<br><br>
Could Hawley have been defeated so easily? On the other hand, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Yasamin, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi all heaved a collective sigh of relief.
<br><br>
Zen's victory was really no surprise to them.
<br><br>
Even the mighty Hawley had been defeated by Zen. They couldn't help but wonder at Zen's actual strength.
<br><br>
The warriors from the other races in the forest were all overjoyed at Zen's victory. Upon defeating Hawley, Zen would become the new ruler of the Flaming Maple Forest. In fact, regardless of who would rule over the Flaming Maple Forest next, they believed that things could only be better than when the Misty River race was in power! They had all been milked dry by the members of the Misty River race, and they hated them to the core.
<br><br>
However, the silence only lingered for a few seconds.
<br><br>
To everyone's astonishment, Hawley's prone figure stirred on the ground, and suddenly he began moving again.
<br><br>
A red round light about an inch wide glowed in Hawley's right hand.
<br><br>
Following that, a band of red light emanated up from the red glowing orb to Hawley's shoulders, then it wrapped his chest, neck, spine, back, legs… Before long, the glowing light seemed to have consumed Hawley's whole body.
<br><br>
Buzz! Suddenly, something miraculous began unfolding.
<br><br>
It was as if someone began blowing air into Hawley's shrunken body. The parts that had caved in from Zen's punches quickly swelled up like inflating balloons. The wounds all over his body recovered, and his contorted limbs assumed their normal shapes after being wrapped by the glowing red light.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! With a series of crisp sounds, Hawley's body completely healed from all injuries.
<br><br>
Seeing that Hawley now lay on the ground unscathed as if from a dream, Wheeler became so excited that he suddenly raised his arms and roared, "Hawley!"
<br><br>
The other warriors of the Misty River race instantly followed suit and shouted, "Hawley!"
<br><br>
"Hawley! Hawley! Hawley!"
<br><br>
The deafening cheers of the Misty River race echoed throughout the Flaming Maple Forest. Even the forest seemed to react to their exuberance as the leaves on the maple trees rustled in response.
<br><br>
Those from the other races were overwhelmed by the unison of the roars, and none of them could find the words to say.
<br><br>
Amidst the roars of his kindred, Hawley slowly climbed to his feet. With a trace of regret in his eyes he took a deep breath and said, "What a pity that I'll have to fight you in my strongest form..."
<br><br>
The Misty River race was known to possess extremely strong physical bodies. According to their unique talents, the stronger their bodies grew, the darker their skin became.
<br><br>
The average members of the Misty River race had bodies that shone with a golden color. Upon reaching a certain level, their bodies turned bronze.
<br><br>
If one's physical body reached an extreme level of cultivation, it would then be in the same dark cyan color as Wheeler's, which was believed to represent their limit.
<br><br>
Wheeler had always regarded Hawley as having reached a higher plane, hoping that he could surpass his limit and cultivate to Hawley's level.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, even though he had tried all sorts of methods, his body had reached its limits of strength and didn't improve any further.
<br><br>
Only Hawley knew that the secret source of his extraordinary strength was the mysterious scorched arm he had found by chance.
<br><br>
After absorbing that arm, his physical body had undergone an astonishing metamorphosis. The arm had easily helped him surpass the limits of his race and attain a new level! He had always been curious as to who the owner of that arm had been.
<br><br>
Since it had such a tremendous effect, the owner of the arm must have been a truly powerful being. But who possessed the strength to cut an arm from such a formidable creature...
<br><br>
The awe in Hawley's mind grew every time he contemplated on it.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, he was aware that the source of the secret lay at the uppermost reaches of the Divine River, which was in the Jade Pure Realm, in the deepest part of the Three Purities Stage! Just like the other races in Stage Thirty-three, Hawley had always held the entering of the Jade Pure Realm as his ultimate goal. Therefore, he never revealed his true strength, hoping to use it at a more critical moment. He would never have expected he would be forced to use it while fighting a human today.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Having spoken, Hawley suddenly stretched forth one hand and grabbed Zen's arm. With a flip, he hurled Zen to the ground, pinning him down.
<br><br>
Then, the band of red light covering his body congregated near his right arm.
<br><br>
Boom! He launched a massive punch.
<br><br>
An immense wave of power pulsed forth from him, spreading through the ground. Even the densely interwoven roots of the Flaming Maple Trees failed to dampen the heavy vibrations.
<br><br>
The creatures standing close to the Flaming Maple Trees could keep a semblance of balance, while those who stood on the open ground were all sent reeling to the earth. As waves of power spread, they found it virtually impossible to regain their footing.
<br><br>
Boom! Hawley landed a second punch.
<br><br>
A huge gaping crater appeared beneath Hawley and Zen, devouring them in a cloud of dust. Larger tremors of power radiated from them, rocking everyone with the force of an earthquake.
<br><br>
Boom! A third punch! A massive area suffered severe tremors like rolling waves, and the Flaming Maple Trees nearest the epicenter were razed to the ground. Even the members of the Misty River race were cast aside by the earth-shattering vibrations.
<br><br>
Chapter 3960 Going In Circles The shaking of the earth lasted for a while before it finally stopped. Then, everyone saw that a body was thrown out of the deep pit. It was none other than Zen.
<br><br>
The blue transparent crystal on the surface of Zen's body showed countless cracks that came in various sizes and extended inward. Even his dark blue bones also had cracks. As he received the full impacts of Hawley's heavy punches, his body wasn't able to withstand them anymore.
<br><br>
The warriors of various races all fell silent as they witnessed the crushing impact of the extent of Hawley's strength.
<br><br>
Among the creatures that were spectating, there were actually some spies sent by the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization. Earlier, they were planning to report that the Flaming Maple Forest might change its ruler. However, the sudden turn of events made the situation more complicated.
<br><br>
Although it was a unanimous idea that Hawley would be unbeatable, seeing his true strength with their own eyes still rendered them speechless.
<br><br>
It went beyond their wildest expectations.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! Finally." After walking out of the deep pit, Hawley approached Wheeler while gesturing something.
<br><br>
Wheeler quickly understood what he meant, so he immediately took out a basin of Soul Interdicting Water from the Divine River and splashed it on Zen's crumbling body. This way, even if Zen regained his consciousness, he would not be able to escape.
<br><br>
After Wheeler was done with his job, Hawley walked over and stared down at Zen's body, which was covered with countless cracks. "No one can challenge my physical strength. You may be an extraordinary warrior in the Three Purities Stage, but you're still nothing in front of me!"
<br><br>
Then, he raised his foot and stepped on Zen's left leg. He continued to exert his force that instantly increased and enlarged the cracks on Zen's leg.
<br><br>
Crack! Crash! Zen's leg exploded, turning into thousands of pieces that scattered on the ground.
<br><br>
Seeing this scene, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others couldn't help but twitch their eyes and bite their lips.
<br><br>
After two rounds of strengthening, Zen's body still failed to withstand and endure Hawley's attacks.
<br><br>
If he died here today, all of his efforts in his journey on the Other Shore would go to waste.
<br><br>
"This is a mistake after all! Zen's life is much more important than mine and the Oneness Sky Palace!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi regretted the fact that Zen needed to suffer just to save his life. He was deeply frustrated and couldn't help but blame himself.
<br><br>
Although Yasamin didn't say anything, it was evident in her face that she had the same thoughts.
<br><br>
For them, Zen seemed to be their last hope, and the only person that could possibly complete the Finale Way. Now that he fell because of going out of his way to save them, they felt that it was not worth it.
<br><br>
With all the thoughts and emotions that were surging, the Snake Goddess didn't say anything and just looked at Zen with a serious expression.
<br><br>
She still refused to believe that it was the end for Zen. He showed them several miracles before, and she knew more than anyone that Zen was the last person to accept such kind of fate.
<br><br>
Crash! Hawley stomped on Zen's right leg and immediately shattered it into countless pieces of blue crystals.
<br><br>
He wasn't finished yet. He raised his foot again, and this time, aimed for Zen's body.
<br><br>
However, when Hawley's foot was about to hit Zen's abdomen, Zen finally opened his eyes and stared at Hawley with his scarlet eyes.
<br><br>
When Hawley's eyes locked with Zen's, he instantly felt a shiver crept beneath his skin. He started trembling as if a ghost came back to life to haunt him. With that, he instinctively wanted to kill Zen as soon as possible, so he immediately gathered his strength on his foot, and stomped as hard as he could.
<br><br>
However, just before he hit Zen's body, a space fluctuation was suddenly released from it. Zen instantly disappeared and Hawley's foot hit nothing but the ground.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Since the space fluctuation spread, the Flaming Maple Forest quickly perceived it. Countless maple leaves started circling and lighting up. They flocked like numerous vicious butterflies searching for their prey.
<br><br>
"Humph. What a foolish move. You just started the final thirty seconds of your life," Hawley said with a sneer.
<br><br>
The members of the Misty River race, the warriors from various races, and even the Eternal Realm masters sighed as they looked at the maple leaves.
<br><br>
No matter how far they were, how fast they ran, or how hard they tried to hide, these maple leaves would always arrive in thirty seconds and punish the one who violated the rules. Right now, Zen's only chance to escape was to leave the Other Shore. However, Hawley also cut off this means by asking Wheeler to pour the Soul Interdicting Water of the Divine River on Zen's body.
<br><br>
Therefore, right now, in the eyes of the crowd, Zen only had thirty seconds left to spare before his tragic death. Within this time, he could only do nothing but struggle desperately until his time was up.
<br><br>
For the members of the Misty River race, they liked to appreciate this given time. They enjoyed seeing the warriors from other races and even the Eternal Realm warriors struggle within those thirty seconds, knowing that the end results would still be the same.
<br><br>
There were times that the cruel members of the Misty River race forced the creatures of other races and the Eternal Realm warriors to activate their energy in order to enjoy their struggles in the last thirty seconds of their lives.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! As Zen disappeared, he immediately built a space channel. The maple leaves quickly separated from the Flaming Maple Trees and flew into the sky.
<br><br>
"What is that brat doing? Is he deliberately attracting many maple leaves?"
<br><br>
"That number of maple leaves are enough to kill him ten times!"
<br><br>
"Well, it doesn't matter. In the end, only his death will be certain."
<br><br>
The maple leaves of the Flaming Maple Forest actually had several magical properties. For one, they would surely catch up with their targets within thirty seconds. Another would be that the damages caused by the explosions of the maple leaves were unstoppable.
<br><br>
Even if one used a powerful enchanted barrier or a space channel, it would still be unable to block the damage that was brought by the maple leaves' explosions.
<br><br>
As Zen emerged from the space channel, they saw a green light enveloping the surface of his body and his broken legs quickly recovering. He looked back at the maples leaves that were hunting him and entered the space channel again.
<br><br>
He drew an invisible path in the entire Flaming Maple Forest, attracting countless maple leaves in the process.
<br><br>
"Wow, this guy runs so fast. He has gone a lap around the forest in such a short time."
<br><br>
"Yeah, but it doesn't matter anymore. He only gets eighteen seconds left."
<br><br>
"Fifteen seconds more…"
<br><br>
"Twelve seconds left! Is he not tired yet?"
<br><br>
"Let him be. After all, that's all he can do now."
<br><br>
"Six seconds left!"
<br><br>
"Three seconds before the explosion." "Here it comes..."
<br><br>
Everyone counted precisely, so they knew that they were on track. With that number of maple leaves chasing Zen, no matter where he escaped, the loud sound of the explosion would quickly transmit and reverberate.
<br><br>
"Boom!" Larkin shouted as he cheered for the explosion that everyone was waiting for.
<br><br>
However, thirty seconds had already elapsed, but not even a little explosion was heard.
<br><br>
On the contrary, what they saw was that Zen emerged in the air. This time, he was flying in the sky and not in the space channel, so they clearly saw more maple leaves that were chasing after him.
<br><br>
A large number of maple leaves had accumulated behind him. However, the leaves weren't cutting the gap. They did not stop chasing Zen, but they also couldn't get close to him.
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes widened as they saw this scene. Hawley was the most shocked. He clenched his fists and yelled, "How the hell is that possible?!"
<br><br>
Due to his overwhelming anger, a slight energy fluctuation was released from his shoulder. Although the fluctuation was very minimal, it didn't escape from the sense of a maple leaf on a nearby tree. Immediately, it suddenly lit up and rushed towards him.
<br><br>
Hawley came to his senses and quickly dodged the maple leaf. He struggled so hard just to get away from it.
<br><br>
However, exactly after thirty seconds, the maple leaf successfully reached Hawley and exploded on his shoulder.
<br><br>
Boom! Even though Hawley's body had an astonishing defense, the explosion of a single maple leaf still created a crack on the surface of his body.
<br><br>
"These maple leaves work just fine!" Hawley gritted his teeth in confusion.
<br><br>
"What the heck did that human do?!"
<br><br>
Zen continued circling around the forest, attracting more and more maple leaves in the process. So much time had now elapsed, but the maple leaves still weren't even close to catching up with Zen.
<br><br>
"What the hell! Did he really do something with the maple leaves?"
<br><br>
"This is impossible. This has never happened since ancient times! The power of the maple leaves is absolute!"
<br><br>
The members of various races and the Eternal Realm warriors were all flabbergasted.
<br><br>
"What sort of miracle did he do this time?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3961 Track At the start, everyone had anxiously counted down the time till Zen's inevitable death, but when the time came, Zen was still alive and well! Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others, who had been worried earlier, all heaved sighs of relief.
<br><br>
"This guy..." Fuxi shook his head in awe.
<br><br>
Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi was stunned. "We can't rest easy just yet.
<br><br>
Danger still looms."
<br><br>
King Ieuan muttered under its breath, "How is it possible that the maple leaves can't catch up to him? What method is he using?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess carefully studied Zen's movements. "The maple leaves in the Flaming Maple Forest do not move normally. The way these maple leaves pass through space is different from what we know; perhaps Zen moves in a similar manner..."
<br><br>
"Does Zen move differently from us? Why can't I figure this out?" Fuxi scratched his head.
<br><br>
"As creatures in the chaos, we are born with limits. It's only natural we can't comprehend," the Snake Goddess replied wisely. "Zen's body must've changed due to obtaining that bloodline..."
<br><br>
While the Snake Goddess didn't know exactly how the ancestry-level bloodline worked, she figured it had a lot to do with how Zen was moving now.
<br><br>
After all, she observed his performance after he had reached the Eternal Realm. His bloodline's strength might have reached a degree that ordinary people could not understand.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...
<br><br>
As Zen zoomed through the air, he suddenly sped up and continued to fly in circles. Then, he landed on the clearing in the forest and walked towards Hawley as though nothing had happened.
<br><br>
His eyes flashed fiercely with killing intent. As he spoke, his voice rang across the forest. "Is this your strongest form? Will you be able to block them?"
<br><br>
To the others, everything looked strange.
<br><br>
Zen didn't walk quickly—in fact, he resembled an old man walking slowly.
<br><br>
Yet, he seemed to be closing the gap between him and Hawley in seconds.
<br><br>
When Hawley heard Zen's threat, it suddenly dawned on him why Zen had aroused all those maple leaves.
<br><br>
Immediately, he whipped around to retreat towards the depths of the Flaming Maple Forest at high speed, as though a venomous snake was at his heels. As he ran, he heard Zen laughing maniacally. "Do you wish to escape? I'll give you thirty seconds...
<br><br>
Thirty seconds! Twenty-seven seconds! Twenty-four seconds..."
<br><br>
Everyone watched as Zen slowly took steps forward, like some old man struggling to overtake fatigue.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Hawley flew through the forest as fast as he could.
<br><br>
Despite Zen seemingly taking his time, the distance between the two of them was still rapidly closing! "Thirty seconds... Does that guy know how the maple leaves move?"
<br><br>
"This is too terrifying!"
<br><br>
"There's no way Hawley will make it out of this alive..."
<br><br>
When Zen first stepped into the picture, everyone regarded him as a mere challenger. However, now, the tables had turned quickly. It was obvious Zen had some unfathomable abilities.
<br><br>
"Fifteen seconds! Twelve seconds! Nine seconds! Six seconds..."
<br><br>
Previously, when the crowd saw the maple leaves fluttering, they didn't understand how the maple leaves moved. It just looked like sometimes they flew fast, and other times they flew quite slowly.
<br><br>
Now that Zen took his time with every stride, everyone could see the scene clearly.
<br><br>
While it seemed he was moving slowly at the original speed, the span of each step changed.
<br><br>
A one-foot-long space became one inch in front of Zen, whereas a distance of ten feet became just one foot! In the last three seconds, any place in the world was just a step away to Zen! Even though Hawley was by no means slow, Zen's ability to cross distances made Hawley look like a turtle.
<br><br>
In one more stride, Zen had caught up to Hawley. Lightly tapping his shoulder, Zen smiled and said, "You still have... thirty seconds left."
<br><br>
Then Zen abruptly turned around and headed towards Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
The flying maple leaves in the sky had originally circled according to Zen's moving track, but now they changed their direction and rushed towards Hawley like bees.
<br><br>
The first thirty seconds was the time it took for Zen to catch up to Hawley.
<br><br>
Now, the next thirty seconds was the time it would take for the maple leaves to catch up to him.
<br><br>
Previously, Hawley held on to the hope that he would be able to escape.
<br><br>
However, as he saw the maple leaves swarming towards him, he stopped running.
<br><br>
"I only have thirty seconds to live," Hawley muttered as he resigned himself to his fate.
<br><br>
He had once said that if he offended the Flaming Maple Forest and attracted the attack of the maple leaves, he would not even attempt to run away, since he knew it'd all be in vain. In the end, he decided to face his fate.
<br><br>
"Eighteen seconds...
<br><br>
Fifteen seconds! Twelve seconds! Nine seconds! Six seconds! Three seconds!"
<br><br>
Zen was quite far away from Fuxi. Again, he walked slowly, but it only took him thirty seconds to close the distance.
<br><br>
Finally, he stood next to Fuxi and the Snake Goddess to watch what would become of Hawley.
<br><br>
Just then, the maple leaves reached Hawley.
<br><br>
One by one, they each began to explode.
<br><br>
Hawley gritted his teeth as he willed his physical body to reach its peak in a last effort to survive.
<br><br>
A maple leaf explosion could cause any ordinary person to explode in a cloud of flesh and blood, but for Hawley, it only left marks on his skin.
<br><br>
However, there were just too many maple leaves! Zen had just built a space channel and ran around, almost activating onethird of the maple leaves in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
No one had been able to infuriate the Flaming Maple Forest to such an extent before, because from the moment one activated the first maple leaf, they usually had only thirty seconds to escape. However, Zen just ignored this.
<br><br>
In fact, if he wanted to, he could activate all the maple leaves in the Flaming Maple Forest! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Soon, Hawley was completely enveloped in light caused by the exploding maple leaves.
<br><br>
The sound of explosions echoed throughout the forest.
<br><br>
After more than thirty seconds, the explosions suddenly stopped! When the light faded, everyone glued their eyes to the spot where Hawley had been just now. However, to their surprise, there was nothing left, except a blackened patch of earth and a huge hole caused by the explosions.
<br><br>
Hawley's physical body was completely obliterated by the maple leaves.
<br><br>
This was a common occurrence in the Flaming Maple Forest, but many people were still left stunned.
<br><br>
A few maple leaves were still whirling around in the air. Since their target had already perished, they circled a few more times, and one by one, exploded into flashes of light.
<br><br>
Then, a hush fell over the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
The members of the Misty River race stared at the blackened earth where Hawley had stood just moments ago. They were still unwilling to believe that Hawley, their strongest warrior, had died.
<br><br>
As the leader of the Misty River race, Wheeler was livid.
<br><br>
Although Hawley wasn't the only strong member of the Misty River race, Wheeler had still relied on him to gain a firm foothold in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
Now, with Hawley gone, this was a huge setback.
<br><br>
If the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization wanted to defeat Wheeler in the Flaming Maple Forest, it wouldn't be too difficult for them to do that. This meant that the status of the Misty River race was in great peril, and that they were in danger of being annihilated because of what they had done over the years.
<br><br>
A piercing coldness crept throughout Wheeler's body, as though he had been stabbed with a blade of ice. Overcome with anger, he was frozen to his spot.
<br><br>
"Zen, how did you make it? That..." Even Fuxi was at a loss for words.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stared intently at Zen and asked, "Is it your bloodline that gave you this ability?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "I can sense another path which is very unique. It's a different space, so it's different from the space theurgy we comprehend."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he reached out his hand towards a Flaming Maple Tree in the distance.
<br><br>
Chapter 3962 Black Limbs The maple leaves had left the trees of the Flaming Maple Forest. However, it wasn't long before new maple leaves started sprouting on the trees.
<br><br>
Zen reached out his hand and gently picked one.
<br><br>
He didn't extend his arm, nor did he build a space channel, but he somehow was able to pick a single maple leaf.
<br><br>
"Are you able to pick anything?" The Snake Goddess's eyes lit up excitedly.
<br><br>
If Zen was able to harness this mysterious ability, he would become extremely powerful and extremely useful.
<br><br>
"No." Zen shook his head. "I can only pick the maple leaves."
<br><br>
After he took the terrifying punches from Hawley, he was left almost in a coma. In an attempt to protect himself, he managed to activate the space theurgy to narrowly avoid Hawley, completely relying on the instinct of the ancestry-level bloodline. Upon activating the theurgy, the ancestry-level bloodline gifted him with this miraculous ability.
<br><br>
The instant he gathered his wits, Zen was shocked to see so many maple leaves chasing after him. However, he noticed that the maple leaves flew very slowly. Moreover, it seemed as though the maple leaves followed a certain path. To his surprise, he too was on this same path.
<br><br>
Once he realized this, everything became simple.
<br><br>
Others thought it was incomprehensible, but to Zen, it was simple.
<br><br>
Whenever someone released energy in the Flaming Maple Forest, the maple leaves would come to life and would build a specific path that led to them.
<br><br>
No matter how fast the target was, no matter how far they ran, the maple leaves only needed to follow the path and hit the target.
<br><br>
With Zen, however, he realized he could manipulate the path.
<br><br>
This was why he circled the sky several times. He created a path that looped, which trapped the maple leaves in an infinite path. As long as he didn't break the circle, the maple leaves were doomed to fly in a circle for eternity.
<br><br>
He approached Hawley again and tapped him on the shoulder, creating a path that led straight to the latter.
<br><br>
Because Zen now understood the nature of the Flaming Maple Forest, he no longer feared it. In fact, he used it to his advantage. He could let the maple leaves kill Hawley for him.
<br><br>
Once the creatures and the Eternal Realm warriors recovered from their initial shock, they hurried to make plans.
<br><br>
Three short members of the Magic Dwarf race stepped forward first. The one in the lead raised an intact Gold and Silver Skeleton above his head.
<br><br>
"This Gold and Silver Skeleton is extremely rare. Please accept it."
<br><br>
The members of the Misty River race watched sullenly.
<br><br>
Generally, when an intact Gold and Silver Skeleton was retrieved, the creatures were not allowed to keep it. The Misty River race would definitely get a share of it. Intact Gold and Silver Skeletons were extremely rare, and the Misty River race would take them as their own, and then give some broken bones to the ones who retrieved the skeletons.
<br><br>
To their surprise, the Magic Dwarf race had actually kept an intact Gold and Silver Skeleton without them knowing.
<br><br>
It was common for other races and Eternal Realm warriors to privately store whatever retrieved from the Divine River.
<br><br>
The Misty River race was aware of this, of course, but they never imagined the Magic Dwarf race was audacious enough to keep a whole Gold and Silver Skeleton and present it to Zen right in front of them.
<br><br>
The instant Hawley died, the Magic Dwarf race ceased to take the Misty River race seriously.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Larkin suddenly cut in. "We, the Misty River race, are the masters of the Flaming Maple Forest!"
<br><br>
Larkin was young and aggressive. He couldn't help but scold the member of the Magic Dwarf race.
<br><br>
The member of the Magic Dwarf race turned his head to shoot Larkin a contemptuous glance. "Hawley is dead. You are too weak to be the master of the Flaming Maple Forest," he sneered.
<br><br>
Although the members of the Magic Dwarf race were short, they were by no means ordinary.
<br><br>
Just like the members of the Misty River race, they were all born with strong physical bodies. However, because the Misty River race had Hawley's extraordinary strength on their side, they had always had the upper hand. As a result, the Magic Dwarf race had always been suppressed.
<br><br>
Although the population of the Magic Dwarf race was hundreds of times larger than that of the Misty River race, Hawley was powerful enough to wipe them out by himself.
<br><br>
The Magic Dwarf race were so afraid of Hawley that they were willing to swallow the insults and humiliation thrown at them.
<br><br>
But now, things were different.
<br><br>
Hawley was dead.
<br><br>
The Magic Dwarf race saw this as an opportunity.
<br><br>
It was rare for the human race to reach here. Only those at the Eternal Realm ever made it to the Flaming Maple Forest. In the long history, the human race had made many brilliant achievements, but it disappeared for a long time. It was not until recently that a few of its members appeared in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
They alone were definitely unable to manage the vast Flaming Maple Forest. As a result, the Magic Dwarf race was happy to do this on behalf of Zen.
<br><br>
"Is it useful?" Zen asked the ancestry-level bloodline in his body.
<br><br>
But the ancestry-level bloodline did not respond. Obviously, it had no interest in the supposed rare treasure before it.
<br><br>
"Of course it's useful! It's sacred to any body refiner. An intact Gold and Silver Skeleton only shows up once every ten thousand years!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi said excitedly.
<br><br>
But when he saw everyone staring at him, he suddenly fell quiet. His face turned red with embarrassment for the first time.
<br><br>
After all, he was the leader of the Oneness Sky Palace, and the backer of the human race in the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
It was indeed a little inappropriate for him to comment on a treasure, especially in front of a younger warrior, but he couldn't help himself.
<br><br>
Although he had found a lot of things in the Divine River in the past few years, not all of them were useful. From time to time, some strange things would float down from the upper reaches of the Divine River, but other creatures would immediately snatch them before he could even get close.
<br><br>
As a result, the Other Shore Tokens that Eastern Emperor Taiyi brought back to the Oneness Sky Palace to benefit the members at the Holy Soul Realm were basically lowly things that no one wanted.
<br><br>
Once, he had found a piece of Gold and Silver Bone, which was only the size of a fingernail. However, this small treasure already made him feel as though he'd uncovered a supreme Other Shore Token. After all, after he reached the Eternal Realm, not many treasures could be used to strengthen his body.
<br><br>
Now that he saw an intact Gold and Silver Skeleton, he could hardly control his excitement.
<br><br>
"Since you say it's a good thing, please accept it," said Zen.
<br><br>
The Gold and Silver Skeleton might not be useful for him, but it was extremely important to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan, who were all at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
The gift that the Magic Dwarf race presented to Zen not only caused the dissatisfaction of the Misty River race, but caused a ripple effect among the other races that lived along the Divine River.
<br><br>
They too scrambled to find worthy offerings. It was evident to all that Zen was an incredibly important, powerful man. If they could get on his good side, they could possibly benefit from it, or at the very least, they could avoid certain death.
<br><br>
However, just as those races were about to line up to give Zen gifts, all the maple trees in the Flaming Maple Forest began to tremble.
<br><br>
Splash! It was as if a gust of wind had swept through the Flaming Maple Forest, and all the maple leaves began to rustle at this moment. The Flaming Maple Trees suddenly came to life, communicating with each other in a unique way.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Waves suddenly appeared in the Divine River.
<br><br>
Countless thick roots suddenly emerged on the surface of the river. These were the roots of the Flaming Maple Trees! Curious, the crowd stopped in their tracks to watch the roots carry something out of the water.
<br><br>
It seemed the roots entwined around two burnt, black limbs, and sent them to the shore. One of the burnt limbs was sent to the Wheeler, and the other was sent to the Magic Dwarf race.
<br><br>
Chapter 3963 The Choice Of The Flaming Maple Forest One of the charred black limbs was a leg and the other was an arm.
<br><br>
The members of various races and the Eternal Realm warriors were stunned, their breaths quickening, as these limbs appeared on the surface of the Divine River.
<br><br>
Hawley devoured a scorched limb, which everyone in the Flaming Maple Forest knew about. Many warriors of various races maintained that this was the reason why Hawley was so powerful.
<br><br>
When these warriors were looking for all sorts of strange treasures in the Divine River, they naturally hoped to get lucky enough to lay hands on the charred limbs one day.
<br><br>
To everyone's disappointment, no one had gotten a second charred limb across the years.
<br><br>
Who would have thought that two black limbs were hidden in the Flaming Maple Forest! The roots of the Flaming Maple Trees were strong, and both sides of the Divine River were covered with these trees. Everything that happened in the Divine River would be under the control of the Flaming Maple Forest, so it was easy for the Flaming Maple Forest to obtain anything from the Divine River.
<br><br>
"Once the black limb is devoured, one's physical strength will increase by leaps and bounds!"
<br><br>
"It can make me stronger than Hawley!"
<br><br>
"This is our race's sacred object!"
<br><br>
The crowd was now extremely excited.
<br><br>
One's strength could increase to an unimaginable level after they obtained a black limb. This temptation was so strong that it astonished the Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
The Flaming Maple Forest had probably sensed that many warriors from various races were about to make a move. Branches covered in maple leaves surrounded the members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race, the maple leaves flashing the red light.
<br><br>
This was a serious warning.
<br><br>
Several warriors saw the red maple leaves and subconsciously came to a halt.
<br><br>
They didn't forget that they were in the Flaming Maple Forest, and knew what would happen if they were attacked by these maple leaves.
<br><br>
But more warriors wished for good luck. They believed that as long as they didn't use their energy, the Flaming Maple Forest wouldn't attack them. And if they were lucky enough to grab the black limbs, the benefits would be obvious enough.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
The warriors swarmed towards the members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race.
<br><br>
"You're courting death!"
<br><br>
"How dare you rob us?"
<br><br>
The faces of the members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race darkened.
<br><br>
These two races were powerful in the Flaming Maple Forest, but they were under immense pressure in the face of the riot that so many warriors were staging.
<br><br>
The warriors in the front had barely approached them when the red maple leaves fell off the branches.
<br><br>
Before this, the maple leaves had flown in a rather relaxed manner towards their targets. The red maple leaves, however, were completely different.
<br><br>
They were like sharp arrows shooting towards the people approaching them.
<br><br>
"That's not a long distance," Zen said.
<br><br>
The length of the invisible route determined the time it would take for the maple leaves to approach the target.
<br><br>
The maple leaves exploded rapidly in this short route.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
The warriors of different races who were at the front of the approaching horde were smashed into pieces by the maple leaves.
<br><br>
When the remaining warriors watched the warriors in front of them meet this miserable end, they became frightened and realized the cruel reality that awaited them.
<br><br>
They'd be courting death if they continued on like this. Once they figured this out, all of them began to retreat. The members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race remained nervous for a while.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess seemed to realize something as she watched this scene unfold. "It looks like the Flaming Maple Forest is the real owner of this place. The Misty River race doesn't have the ability to control the Flaming Maple Forest. Hawley was just a helper chosen by the Flaming Maple Forest."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi and King Ieuan were stunned at first, but soon realized that the Snake Goddess was right. The black limb that Hawley had eaten before had probably been given to him by the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
"So the Flaming Maple Forest has now chosen the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race at the same time, right?" Fuxi asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
"I think so." The Snake Goddess smiled. "Zen has easily killed Hawley, which might have brought a lot of pressure on the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
The forest will, as a result, expand its team."
<br><br>
"It wants to expand its team just to deal with me?" Zen's eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
"What will the Flaming Maple Forest do if I grab a black limb?"
<br><br>
Zen had barely finished talking when the three Flaming Maple Trees close by suddenly bent down to Zen, stretching out their branches as if in obeisance. The maple leaves on the branches flickered with the green light.
<br><br>
This was a sign that the Flaming Maple Forest was actually showing him kindness.
<br><br>
The forest was afraid that Zen would really fight for the black limbs.
<br><br>
Zen was the only person the Flaming Maple Forest could do nothing to.
<br><br>
"It is just a casual suggestion," Zen said, shrugging.
<br><br>
He wouldn't stay in the Flaming Maple Forest for a long time. What was more, he had no interest in the Flaming Maple Forest or the Divine River.
<br><br>
"However, the black limb can greatly strengthen the physical body. I don't need it but..." Zen said, eyes narrowed and a smirk on his face.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yasamin, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and King Ieuan were all shocked at Zen's words. If their bodies were strengthened to be as powerful as Hawley's, their strength would also increase greatly.
<br><br>
In the distance, the members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race were also paying attention to what was happening here, their faces deathly pale.
<br><br>
They weren't afraid of other warriors coming to snatch the limbs. But they couldn't escape or resist if Zen came for them. They would have no choice but to surrender.
<br><br>
The black limbs were related to the races' fate. How could they let others take them away? However, before Zen could finish talking, the Divine River beside him began to churn violently.
<br><br>
Countless stems lifted the items at the bottom of the Divine River. Among them were Gold and Silver Bones flickering with two types of lights, azure blue crystals, and dazzlingly shiny thin clothes...
<br><br>
Zen knew that these things were very valuable. And though they were not as valuable as the charred black limbs, they were still a huge fortune for the warriors of various races in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Everyone, including the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, were interested in them.
<br><br>
"This fortune is too much!" King Ieuan was good at calculating the value of items. With just a glance, it was able to roughly determine the value of this pile.
<br><br>
Wheeler didn't relax. He knew that although this pile was large, the combined value of these items was not as high as that of the black limbs.
<br><br>
What if Zen didn't give up on the black limbs? Perhaps the Flaming Maple Forest knew this, which was probably why one of the maple trees suddenly stretched out a branch and began to write on the ground. "The Eternal Realm warrior can't absorb the charred corpse and will die after swallowing it. You can try if you don't believe me."
<br><br>
These words disappointed Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others, forcing them to give up their fantasy.
<br><br>
There was a clear distinction between the Eternal Realm warriors and the other creatures. The latter were Other Shore creatures born in the Three Purities Stage, while the Eternal Realm warriors had arrived there through the scroll painting.
<br><br>
With a noncommittal look on his face, Zen asked, "What is the story behind the charred corpse?"
<br><br>
One could strengthen their body to a terrifying extent by swallowing the black limbs. The charred corpse must have been extremely powerful when it was alive; even its backstory was probably extraordinary.
<br><br>
Chapter 3964 Inquire Zen was not the only one who felt curious. The others—including the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and even the members of the Magic Dwarf and Misty River races—all watched from a distance, eager to know the truth.
<br><br>
Leaves swished and rustled as the branches danced on the ground again.
<br><br>
"A long time ago, a fireball rushed down from the upper reaches. The fire was so fierce that the Divine River, which was overflowed with water, evaporated completely, leaving the riverbed dry. When the fire was finally extinguished, only these three limbs were left. It is not known who they belonged to."
<br><br>
Everyone felt a slight tinge of disappointment at the answer given by the Flaming Maple Forest. After all, everyone wanted to explore the secrets of the Supreme Pure Realm and the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Based on that story, however, it must have been an extremely long time since the fireball struck the river. In fact, these three black limbs had been preserved in the Flaming Maple Forest for many years. The black limb in Hawley's hands was also a secret gift from the forest.
<br><br>
"How do you know that the charred corpse is lethal to the Eternal Realm warriors?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Flaming Maple Forest stretched out a branch and wrote more words on the ground. "See for yourself."
<br><br>
"No need. I trust you," Zen said, shaking his head. He could try and test the truth of the claim, but there was no reason to doubt the forest.
<br><br>
The air was filled with a rustling sound as the Flaming Maple Forest withdrew the branch.
<br><br>
The members of the Misty River race and the Magic Dwarf race breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
The head of the Misty River race, Wheeler, was especially overjoyed.
<br><br>
He had tried countless times, hoping to reach Wheeler's level. But his efforts didn't pay off.
<br><br>
He was the successor to the previous ruler of the Misty River race, but it had always been very clear that he was just a nominal head.
<br><br>
But now he had a chance to change that. If he devoured the black limb, he would be able to become as powerful as Hawley.
<br><br>
Before the other members of the Misty River race had any idea what he planned, he quickly stuffed the black limb into his mouth and began gnawing at it.
<br><br>
After all, the Flaming Maple Forest had given the black limb to the Misty River race, not to Wheeler specifically. If the other members of the Misty River race were unconvinced, the situation would be even more troublesome.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the members of the Magic Dwarf race also had the same thought.
<br><br>
The population of the Magic Dwarf race was much larger than that of the Misty River race. They boasted over forty clans. Every now and then, one of the clans led a foray into the Flaming Maple Forest, while the head of the Magic Dwarf race rarely came to the forest.
<br><br>
Logically speaking, the clan who had taken the black limb should present it to the head of the Magic Dwarf race. But that was impossible now, since the clan leader was already devouring the black limb. This would greatly increase his strength, and it was likely that there would be conflict and slaughter when he returned.
<br><br>
Zen had no interest in the internal disputes of these races. He was more concerned about the wealth of resources given by the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
On the other side of the forest, a wave of energy suddenly appeared out of nowhere. It shimmered in the air, and then formed the shape of a door.
<br><br>
Before the door could solidify, countless maple leaves clustered on the surface of the door. Then, the leaves exploded, destroying the door before it could become fully formed.
<br><br>
On the other side of the door, dozens of long-haired monsters had gathered.
<br><br>
They were shocked at the burst of power they felt when the outside of the door was shattered by exploding maple leaves.
<br><br>
The monsters all began talking at once. "That explosion released real energy!"
<br><br>
"We can't withstand the damage of real energy."
<br><br>
"It would be rash to go out now. We would die."
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters looked worried and helpless.
<br><br>
Through great effort, they had finally managed to catch a creature from outside. The news they heard had spurred them to rush straight to the Flaming Maple Forest, but they had underestimated the strange powers of the forest. The maple leaves actually contained a terrible real energy.
<br><br>
This kind of real energy could pierce through most defensive methods. The more energy the maple leaves released, the more damage they would cause to the target, and there was almost no way to eliminate or reduce the energy.
<br><br>
"I don't care what's in there!" said a crisp new voice from behind them.
<br><br>
"You must find my grandma by all means!" The voice continued, "If my grandma dies, the curse on you will never be removed for the rest of your lives!"
<br><br>
Meanwhile, not far away, a human woman sat quietly in a corner, her slender pale legs tucked to one side. It was none other than Dorothy.
<br><br>
There had been significant changes in her body and overall appearance.
<br><br>
Her midnight black hair had turned into vivid purple crystals. Even her eyebrows were made up of amethysts. Her eyes shone like glowing purple gems.
<br><br>
Compared to before, her aura was countless times stronger.
<br><br>
Even the creatures in Stage Thirty-three could no longer stand against her.
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters heard Dorothy's threat, and they were quick to respond. They were afraid of hearing such threats from this violet-haired woman.
<br><br>
"We have worked very hard," said one of the monsters.
<br><br>
"We've heard that she should be in the Flaming Maple Forest now."
<br><br>
"But... What if your grandma died a long time ago?" a monster asked tentatively.
<br><br>
Dorothy was merciless. "Then the curse will not be lifted from you. I will help you only if my grandma is alive," she said curtly, pursing her lips.
<br><br>
A white-haired monster walked towards her, carrying a square, black brick in its hand.
<br><br>
The brick was hollow, filled with a bubbling violet liquid. A white mist flowed out from the surface of the boiling liquid. As the white-haired monster approached Dorothy, it said, "If your grandma is alive, you need enough strength to save her. If she is dead, you also need enough strength to avenge her. Drink this."
<br><br>
Dorothy was at first inclined to refuse, but as she stared at the purple liquid, she began to think that it was sensible advice. She hesitated for a moment, and then she took the black brick and tilted it to her mouth. She swallowed down every drop of the drink.
<br><br>
"Since the door can't take shape in the Flaming Maple Forest, we can try moving it outside. Then we can enter the forest and look for your grandma,"
<br><br>
the white-haired monster suggested.
<br><br>
"But if we are exposed..." said one of the monsters in an anxious tone.
<br><br>
The white-haired monster chuckled. "We can't hide for the rest of our lives.
<br><br>
Sooner or later, they will know."
<br><br>
These words helped to build the resolve of the long-haired monsters.
<br><br>
Looking resolute, they moved the door out of the Flaming Maple Forest, as they had been ordered to do.
<br><br>
When the door was opened, four of the monsters silently slipped into the forest. The door disappeared after them.
<br><br>
The rest of them waited, not saying much, but anticipating new developments. Four hours later, the four long-haired monsters returned.
<br><br>
They did this by knocking on the air, which caused the door to reappear.
<br><br>
They quickly filed through the door, and when they had all passed, the door vanished once more.
<br><br>
"Have you got any news?"
<br><br>
Dorothy demanded, wearing a worried frown.
<br><br>
"Yes," answered the monster in the lead. "Your grandma is still alive."
<br><br>
Dorothy stood up immediately. A vibrant purple light emanated from her eyes, spreading out across her face and air. She was projecting a powerful, fierce aura.
<br><br>
Even though the long-haired monsters present had their own astonishing strength, they were all suppressed by Dorothy's incomparable aura. The one standing nearest to her made a harsh sound as it felt the force of her power, unable to speak.
<br><br>
The affected monster started to cough. It reached up and grabbed its own throat.
<br><br>
Only then did Dorothy realize what happened. She quickly restrained her aura and said, "I apologize..."
<br><br>
She hadn't been able to fully control her own strength.
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters glanced at each other. When they were certain she had regained control, the one in the lead stepped forward. It took a few deep breaths before telling her what had happened in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
Chapter 3965 The Second Body There were many different races in the Grand Pure Realm, and the Flaming Maple Forest had just undergone drastic changes.
<br><br>
This was why the long-haired monsters hadn't had any trouble sneaking in and getting the information they desired. It was in fact, quite easy for them.
<br><br>
Their report surprised Dorothy greatly. "A human, seventy to eighty feet high saved my grandmother? Are you sure?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I am sure. This human is said to be incredibly powerful," answered the long-haired monster, an eagerness noticeably flickering in its eyes. All these monsters were powerful themselves and were interested in competing against the human mentioned.
<br><br>
"But no human is seventy to eighty feet tall. Did he activate the Wild God Body?" Dorothy pressed further.
<br><br>
"The Wild God Body cannot be used in the Flaming Maple Forest, so it can't be that. No matter how, your grandmother is safe now. It is said the human defeated all the creatures in the Flaming Maple Forest!" The longhaired monster stared intensely at Dorothy after it spoke and the other monsters did the same.
<br><br>
She had been putting off the matter they had pleaded her to resolve with the excuse of having to save her grandmother first. The long-haired monsters then made it their top priority to save Yasamin.
<br><br>
Now that someone else had saved her, Dorothy had no excuses; it was time for her to fulfill her promise.
<br><br>
"Your grandmother will be fine under the human's protection."
<br><br>
"It's your turn to help us now!"
<br><br>
"It wasn't us who saved your grandmother, but we put a lot of time into it..."
<br><br>
Dorothy looked around mischievously at their pleas. "Before I do that, could I first go see my grandmother?"
<br><br>
The long passageway then fell into a gloomy state of disappointment.
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters stared down Dorothy with daggers in their eyes.
<br><br>
They had been waiting too long for this, patiently hoping she would remove their curse as soon as possible.
<br><br>
It was now obvious she did not take their pleading seriously. They were so infuriated they almost felt like killing her on the spot! "I'm just kidding," Dorothy said, shrugging her shoulders nervously as she realized her humor was not being well received.
<br><br>
The mood did however seem to ease a bit when she spoke up...
<br><br>
A thick white fog flowed over the broad, low-lying area all year long.
<br><br>
This fog had not cleared since this place had come into existence. This was how it came to be known as the Misty Pool.
<br><br>
If one stood at the edge of the low-lying land and looked down, they would only be able to see ten feet away, at most, never seeing what lay in the center of this mysterious place.
<br><br>
There were some curious creatures and Eternal Realm warriors that had gone into the fog to explore, but none had ever returned.
<br><br>
For as far back as was known, what hid in this pit was an unsolvable mystery. And so it remained.
<br><br>
If someone dared jump into the pit, they would discover their bodies moved out of control in the white fog. They would sink like boulders to the bottom of the pit where the ground was covered in a bright yellow gum. The whole thing looked like a gigantic piece of amber and the soft gum would slowly absorb anything that was caught in it, dissolving it all bit by bit.
<br><br>
Any creatures unlucky enough to witness this would see all sorts of creatures of all form trapped within the huge amber. Some were only slightly worn away while others were left as nothing more than hard bones...
<br><br>
The amber had a circular hole in the middle which extended down, deep into the ground, to a cave that never saw a spec of light.
<br><br>
In the cave were six round stone platforms with a square coffin placed on each.
<br><br>
Beside the first platform stood three women. They were Samantha, Sienna and Stella.
<br><br>
They seemed to have held this posture for painfully long; so long their bodies had turned stiff. But their faces showed no trace of impatience or suffering. They just continued waiting firmly and devoutly.
<br><br>
Crack! A strange sound came from the coffin on the platform and the thick, heavy lid slowly slid to the side.
<br><br>
A bright yellow mist emerged from it, quickly morphing into a hand of bone as it left the coffin. Following the bone, flesh, blood and veins soon materialized and formed a complete hand.
<br><br>
It rose into the air steadily and a head, shoulders and a torso quickly formed behind it. It was none other than the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Congratulations on your return, Grandmaster of Heaven!"
<br><br>
Samantha, Sienna, and Stella bowed to him with tremendous respect.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at his arm sadly. After a moment he grumbled, "I'm not used to this new body."
<br><br>
"Did you not say your new body will be stronger than the one you had before?" Samantha asked with a smile.
<br><br>
As members of the Interception Sect, they never regretted following the Grandmaster of Heaven. They wouldn't even hesitate to sacrifice their own lives for him if they had to.
<br><br>
"That's true," nodded the Grandmaster of Heaven, "they gave me three bodies, each stronger than the last. This second one is indeed extraordinary, but it takes some time to adapt to it."
<br><br>
"Is it stronger than the Eye Spirit's?" Stella asked, blinking her eyes in excitement.
<br><br>
"If I had fought the Eye Spirit with this body in our last battle, I would have defeated him," replied the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Then... What about Zen?" Sienna asked.
<br><br>
Although they held great respect for him, he was not so stern that they had to behave a certain way in his presence. More to it, they had followed him for many years and were very close to him and so were not afraid to discuss sensitive topics with him.
<br><br>
"Zen?"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes flashed at the mention of Zen.
<br><br>
Over the years, he had led the Nihility race against the Element Spirit Civilization as evenly matched rivals. Never in his wildest dreams had he expected he would be defeated so humiliatingly by a young man! He had been reflecting on his defeat during his resurgence and was now capable of reacting calmly.
<br><br>
"He saved the Pear Hill; he should have entered Stage Thirty-three by now, right?" the Grandmaster of Heaven inquired.
<br><br>
Sienna took a step forward and answered, "According to the latest reports, he was in the Flaming Maple Forest."
<br><br>
"Why would he enter the territory of the Misty River race?" wondered the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"He was trying to save the replica of Eastern Emperor Taiyi," revealed Sienna.
<br><br>
"Although the Misty River race only has a few members, Hawley is not someone he'd be able to defeat easily..."
<br><br>
Just as he murmured thoughtfully, Sienna interrupted him, "The Eye Spirit sent Norris and some others to keep an eye on the Flaming Maple Forest but Zen left them all seriously injured. He even killed Hawley. It is said that even the Flaming Maple Forest bowed to his strength..."
<br><br>
The three women spent most of their time gathering information for the Grandmaster of Heaven and so were naturally very well-informed.
<br><br>
Sienna's news stunned the Grandmaster of Heaven into silence.
<br><br>
"We've been waiting for you to wake up. You're the only one capable of capturing that young man," added Samantha.
<br><br>
"Capture him?" The Grandmaster of Heaven pondered this for a moment before smiling and shaking his head. "Forget it," he said.
<br><br>
"Why?"
<br><br>
asked the three women curiously.
<br><br>
"His next goal is probably to save the Primeval Lord of Heaven," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied. "Let the Eye Spirit deal with him first.
<br><br>
Let's just wait and see what happens."
<br><br>
Since Zen carried the Civilization Artifact of the human race, it seemed likely he wanted to rescue all the human heroes. Because of this, he was bound to clash with the Element Spirit Civilization, and the Nihility race needed only to stand by and watch.
<br><br>
Since Zen could defeat Hawley with ease, the Grandmaster of Heaven believed that he would be a severe headache for the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Chapter 3966 Track Shoes roughly scraped off the ground, as Zen and his group continued to head north of the Flaming Maple Forest. The leaves of the Flaming Maple Trees on both sides glowed green along their way and emitted a soft, friendly aura.
<br><br>
When they got out of the Flaming Maple Forest, the branches even waved goodbye to Zen even if there was no wind.
<br><br>
"I'm sure you're the first one to get this treatment," said King Ieuan beside him.
<br><br>
It dragged a hill-like package behind it, wrapped up in a patched-up skin of a tamed cat. It was not convenient to use the space ring in the Flaming Maple Forest, so it had to use such a primitive method to carry their things.
<br><br>
"I'm also sure that the Flaming Maple Forest never wants you to come back," Fuxi chimed in.
<br><br>
In general, Zen was perhaps one of the few people who could safely walk out of the Flaming Maple Forest, even though he had used energy within it.
<br><br>
There used to be some particularly special cases, but none of them was the same as his.
<br><br>
He looked back at the Flaming Maple Forest and asked, "If we head west and go upwards along the Divine River, can we enter the Supreme Pure Realm and the Jade Pure Realm?"
<br><br>
A smile graced King Ieuan's lips at the question.
<br><br>
"Of course not!" it answered. "Why?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Theoretically speaking, one could reach the Jade Pure Realm by walking along the Divine River since the source of the Divine River was in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
King Ieuan pointed at the west and said, "It seems that this direction will lead us to the Supreme Pure Realm, but that is only true in theory. We speculated that the Three Purities Stage was originally made up of three independent worlds.
<br><br>
However, these three worlds are connected through a precise dislocation of space." "Then, I suppose there are very few entrances, and they are similar to the star rings and the Stage End Passage?" Zen asked again. "No," the Snake Goddess answered.
<br><br>
"On the contrary, there are many entrances, but very few can walk through them alive..." she explained.
<br><br>
Most of the warriors at the Eternal Realm who entered Stage Thirty-three stayed in the Grand Pure Realm, which was in the outermost part of the Three Purities Stage. Very few of them had gone into the Supreme Pure Realm. Simply put, it was truly hard to enter the Supreme Pure Realm successfully.
<br><br>
"But we already have a way to enter it. You don't have to worry about that,"
<br><br>
said Fuxi as he untied the bag on his waist. Then, the Augury Dog came out from the bag.
<br><br>
The Augury Dog's talent lay in his ability to detect danger in his surroundings. He could do so by scanning the area using a special energy field, which would activate the maple leaves in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
However, he could not stop once he started to detect things. Therefore, Fuxi had put him inside his spirit beast bag before they entered the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
Like the Sumeru Space, the spirit beast bag wouldn't trigger the power of space as long as it was not used in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
As soon as Fuxi released the Augury Dog, he turned around and barked twice at the Flaming Maple Forest. "What's wrong?" he asked.
<br><br>
Ever since Zen exhibited his powers in the Flaming Maple Forest, no one dared to chase after him and cause him trouble.
<br><br>
"Someone is following us," the Augury Dog said.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the others all narrowed their eyes.
<br><br>
Zen had finally solved the problem in the Flaming Maple Forest. They just had to deal with the package first, then find a safe place to retreat from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Still, if someone with ill will always followed them, everything would be more complicated.
<br><br>
After all, it was easy to find a member of the Gear race, like Norris. If someone dragged them back to the Other Shore from the chaos, they would be attacked off guard.
<br><br>
"Let's lure them out of the Flaming Maple Forest first," the Snake Goddess suggested.
<br><br>
In turn, King Ieuan hurriedly unwrapped the package while these Eternal Realm warriors activated their own Sumeru Spaces to absorb the things inside the package.
<br><br>
After they divided up all the things inside it, they continued to walk north.
<br><br>
As they advanced, King Ieuan flicked the ground constantly.
<br><br>
They suddenly stopped after about twenty miles of travel. King Ieuan turned around and shouted, "Let's see how you can hide!"
<br><br>
As it spoke, it stretched out its hands and quickly raised them.
<br><br>
Multiple cyan beads that glowed with a faint cyan light appeared on the ground in the distance. Although the light was dim, it illuminated the area within a few miles around it.
<br><br>
Then, the outlines of two winged figures became visible in the cyan light.
<br><br>
"Humph!"
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, Zen kicked hard at the ground.
<br><br>
The earth cracked, then he flew swiftly like an arrow and grabbed at the figures with lightning speed.
<br><br>
However, his hands only passed through the two figures, and he grabbed nothing.
<br><br>
He even heard the pair of shadows sneer at him as if mocking his ignorance.
<br><br>
"Zen, come down. You can't hurt them," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said.
<br><br>
In the end, Zen only frowned and slowly descended to the ground.
<br><br>
"They are Shadow Warriors who serve the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Their real bodies are not here," said the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
The Shadow Warriors weren't very strong, but their race's theurgy produced a shadow that was resistant to almost anything, which made them the perfect stalkers.
<br><br>
If the Element Spirit Civilization needed to track specific targets, they would just send out the Shadow Warriors.
<br><br>
"It appears that they won't let us return to the Source Word so easily,"
<br><br>
Yasamin scoffed coldly. "So we can't get rid of them?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"It's difficult," the Snake Goddess said and shook her head.
<br><br>
"Could they possibly enter the Dark Region?" he asked again. The Snake Goddess immediately understood what he meant and said, "The Shadow Warriors shouldn't be able to enter the Dark Region, but the Dark Region of the Grand Pure Realm is in the northwest.
<br><br>
I'm afraid..."
<br><br>
Since the Element Spirit Civilization had sent out the Shadow Warriors to keep an eye on them, they wouldn't possibly let them escape that easily.
<br><br>
"Then, let's try. Masters, please climb up on my shoulders first!" Zen announced.
<br><br>
He crouched down to let them ride on his broad shoulders, since his body was still about eighty feet tall.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others agreed and jumped up.
<br><br>
Once they were settled down on his shoulders, he rushed forward and headed north again.
<br><br>
The two faint shadows in the sky had never disappeared. They seemed to be completely isolated from the world. Like the moon and sun, they always followed him at a steady speed.
<br><br>
At that moment, the two Shadow Warriors projected the scenes that they saw on an ice piece.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, three white balls floated on one side of the ice piece.
<br><br>
Hot flames burned steadily in the center of one of the white balls. Not long after, a young girl's head appeared. It was none other than Claire.
<br><br>
The moment Claire took shape, thunder and lightning cracked inside the white ball beside her and outlined a burly human figure. It turned out to be Les, the second of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
"A human boy actually defeated the Grandmaster of Heaven! Ha-ha-ha!"
<br><br>
Les laughed in a hoarse voice.
<br><br>
"My instincts never fail me," Claire said seriously, "though it's a pity that such a talent can't work for us."
<br><br>
"So, he could only die…"
<br><br>
This delicate voice came from the last white ball, which contained a strange-looking life form.
<br><br>
The creature looked like a cold armor but had a pair of long light wings on the back.
<br><br>
He was the last one of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Race, Slade.
<br><br>
Les and Claire were both pure Element Spirits, and they had quite simple forms.
<br><br>
However, Slade was different. He was made up of countless members of the Element Spirit race, who formed a world of their own inside his body. They controlled everything he did.
<br><br>
Chapter 3967 Mark And Offer A Reward The last time when Les wanted to kill Zen straight, Claire rejected him.
<br><br>
Now that she knew that they could never win Zen over, she no longer tried to dissuade Les from doing what he wanted.
<br><br>
"It's a pity that I can't leave now, or I would go to the Grand Pure Realm and burn this guy into ashes," Les muttered.
<br><br>
A few thin lightning bolts clashed with each other as he spoke, which was why his voice seemed laced with the sizzling noise of electric currents.
<br><br>
"We're just watching, but doing nothing?" Claire deadpanned.
<br><br>
As the three backbones of the Element Spirit race, the three of them occasionally received reinforcements.
<br><br>
Those reinforcements also helped them improve their strengths over the years.
<br><br>
They couldn't leave on their own will as of now, and couldn't go to kill Zen.
<br><br>
"I can't get in touch with the Eye Spirit recently. He should have entered the Jade Pure Realm again. It's a bit tricky now..." Claire said with a frown.
<br><br>
She had no hesitation in her the moment she decided to kill Zen. After all, she didn't pity him, though she genuinely wanted him to be on their side.
<br><br>
"Then let the warriors from other races on the Grand Pure Realm do something first," Slade suddenly suggested.
<br><br>
"Warriors of other races?" Les asked. He didn't understand what Slade was talking about.
<br><br>
"Mark and offer a reward," Claire said with a nod.
<br><br>
The two Shadow Warriors listened to Slade's orders, while he formed good relationships with many warriors from various races on the Grand Pure Realm under the Eye Spirit's instruction.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, every race on the Three Purities Stage had their unique theurgies and powers.
<br><br>
An ordinary Eternal Realm warrior who explored the Grand Pure Realm which was the outermost part of the Three Purities Stage was already like a person treading on immensely thin ice. Any warrior from the many races on the Grand Pure Realm was automatically their deadliest opponent.
<br><br>
However, the Element Spirit Civilization had been in the Three Purities Stage for so many years. Although they couldn't subdue all of the races on the Grand Pure Realm, they could still have good relationships with them, as well as exchange interests and make deals with them.
<br><br>
Clatter, clatter, clatter...
<br><br>
At that moment, Slade, who had an armor-like body, suddenly stretched out his hands, and then a white beam of light spread out. At the same time, different treasures appeared one after another.
<br><br>
"It's not easy to make those guys obedient. Offering them the Ghost Tendon? That does not sound good enough. The Dead Sea Glaze? Too unpopular..."
<br><br>
Various treasures flew past the white light in succession.
<br><br>
Even Claire and Les couldn't help but eye the treasures with slight interest.
<br><br>
That was because the Eye Spirit collected most of them. The Eye Spirit usually stored a considerable amount of treasures inside Slade's body.
<br><br>
After all, Slade was not an individual. He could be likened to a city that could move. It was just that members of the Element Spirit race lived in the city. Thus, his current actions represented the decisions of all the members of the Element Spirit race in the city.
<br><br>
"I think I'll just use this one…"
<br><br>
In his glowing hands floated some ordinary bone fragments that were about the size of a thumb.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the bone fragments, Claire and Les looked skeptical.
<br><br>
"The Bone Fragments Secret Soul?"
<br><br>
"It's too precious. Will the Eye Spirit even agree?"
<br><br>
The two of them understood that Slade represented the Element Spirit Civilization's Board of Elders to a certain extent, and he had greater rights than Claire and Les. The Eye Spirit usually did not object to any decisions he made.
<br><br>
"That Zen is quite powerful. The warriors of the other races on the Grand Pure Realm are not idiots. Only a great reward will make them brave," said Slade.
<br><br>
Although Claire and Les felt sad at the thought that such a great treasure had to go, they could not interfere.
<br><br>
Once Slade made a decision, he wouldn't change his mind, let alone consider what the two of them thought.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
When the white light in his hand flashed, he said towards the ice piece, "Shadow Warriors!."
<br><br>
"Yes, sir!" the Shadow Warriors in the ice piece answered.
<br><br>
"Mark Zen," Slade ordered.
<br><br>
"Yes, sir!"
<br><br>
In turn, the two Shadow Warriors stretched out their hands towards Zen simultaneously.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Then, two rays of light intersected with each other and formed a distinct mark on Zen's back.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen suddenly felt something as he ran. He turned his head and glanced at the mark.
<br><br>
"What's this?" he asked. "Shadow Mark!" King Ieuan blurted out.
<br><br>
"What's it for?" "The Shadow Mark lasts for about five days after it appears.
<br><br>
During that period, warriors from various races could find your location,"
<br><br>
King Ieuan continued.
<br><br>
Zen frowned deeply. "Can it be removed?" he asked again.
<br><br>
King Ieuan shook its head. "No method can remove it," it said regrettably.
<br><br>
The Shadow Mark was quite well-known in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
After the appearance of the Shadow Mark, the Element Spirit Civilization would offer a big reward to anyone who could do their bidding. Of course, almost all the warriors from the many races would be interested.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the Shadow Mark would stay permanent for a few days. Even if one fled from the Other Shore, the mark still followed them.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others had also heard of it before, but this was the first time they had seen it. All their faces darkened.
<br><br>
However, as soon as King Ieuan finished speaking, Zen's ancestry-level bloodline started to fluctuate. A large, bloody mouth appeared on his back, which was quite near the Shadow Mark. The mouth bit towards it and swallowed it up.
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
King Ieuan looked at the scene, dumbfounded.
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin were also speechless.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the two Shadow Warriors that floated in the air looked at each other. They had no idea what had happened.
<br><br>
"The Shadow Mark is something you can't touch, like those two Shadow Warriors. How did you swallow it?" King Ieuan couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>
"Since you swallowed the mark, then that means you could also get rid of the two Shadow Warriors above, right?" the Snake Goddess also asked. A wry smile graced Zen's face as he shook his head.
<br><br>
In truth, the ancestry-level bloodline did things on a whim. Thus, he couldn't control it or make it do what he wanted.
<br><br>
Next to the ice piece in the Supreme Pure Realm stood Slade, who already planned to share the location of the Shadow Mark with the various races.
<br><br>
When the mark disappeared at such a critical moment, he naturally felt enraged. "Shadow Warriors, what are you doing?" he snapped.
<br><br>
"W...we... That Zen had devoured the Shadow Mark!" one of the Shadow Warriors stammered. Clearly, he was immensely afraid of Slade.
<br><br>
"He did eat it..."
<br><br>
"I saw it too."
<br><br>
Claire and Les still watched the ice piece. When they saw the big gap on Zen's back, they were also baffled.
<br><br>
"We can mark the people around him!"
<br><br>
"Yes, that's a good idea!"
<br><br>
Without waiting for Slade to give the order, the two Shadow Warriors once again summoned Shadow Marks.
<br><br>
This time, they aimed at the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Shadow Marks appeared on the two Eternal Realm warriors' backs almost at once.
<br><br>
When Zen saw that the Shadow Marks appeared again, he tried to remove them for the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but the ancestry- level bloodline sensed that the marks were none of its business. It did not even fluctuate in the slightest, and entirely ignored them.
<br><br>
As soon as the marks had formed completely, the white light in Slade's hand began to spiral. At the same time, a circular white vortex also appeared on the ice piece.
<br><br>
Several large non-human races in the Grand Pure Realm had a huge ice piece inside their places. At this moment, white vortexes also rolled in the center of these ice pieces.
<br><br>
Chapter 3968 Brewing Storm The relationship between the many non-human races of the Grand Pure Realm and the Element Spirit Civilization was strained at best.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had been the first ones to be born in the chaos, and were the first to enter the Other Shore.
<br><br>
They had a longer history than most of the other living creatures in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
The many non-human races of the Grand Pure Realm had once fought fiercely with the Element Spirit Civilization. Some powerful races were able to win and maintain their own, separate status. Some had lost and had to submit to the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
As the Element Spirit Civilization grew stronger and stronger, they began to advance on to the Supreme Pure Realm and then the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Because of this, many races in the Grand Pure Realm wanted to curry favor with the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The Flaming Maple Forest was strong, but the races in it were still hoping to be able to rely on the Element Spirit Civilization's power to help them march onto the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Noticing the needs of these other races, the Element Spirit Civilization gave them many ice pieces. If they ever needed these races' help, they would assign the tasks through them. If the tasks were completed, great rewards awaited them.
<br><br>
Many times in the past, the tasks assigned by the Element Spirit Civilization were mainly targeted at those of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
The Nihility race had grown exponentially in the recent years though. When the races first chased down the Nihility race, they had believed them to be weak. However, the Grandmaster of Heaven had easily slaughtered many of them during tasks.
<br><br>
From that point on, everyone was beginning to realize that the Nihility race was as strong as the Element Spirit Civilization. Very few dared to attack them, and the Element Spirit Civilization rarely assigned tasks through the ice pieces anymore.
<br><br>
A burly bull-headed monster lumbered towards the ice piece and stared at it for a long moment. Greed began to glint in his eyes as he exclaimed, "What? The Bone Fragments Secret Soul! I can't believe it!"
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had always been generous with their rewards, and the treasures they offered were always rare and precious. The Bone Fragments Secret Soul was just that, it was no ordinary item. With the Bone Fragments Secret Soul, they would be able to further strengthen and expand their race. They'd maybe even qualify to enter the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
A second monster joined the first, eyes wide with shock. "If Slade is willing to offer such a valuable thing as a reward, I can bet you the target is no ordinary creature..."
<br><br>
"Not really! It's just a small group of warriors in the Eternal Realm, measly humans. Nothing to be afraid of!" The monster in front of the ice piece replied.
<br><br>
The humans in the Eternal Realm were nothing to be feared, so the creatures believed. Those of the Grand Pure Realm were only afraid of the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race, as they should be.
<br><br>
The other creature seemed to be a little more cautious. "Why would they need to set such a high price if it was a simple task?" he asked. "There's more to it."
<br><br>
"Of course there's more to it," the first one grunted, turning his head to look over his shoulder at the other. "Apparently, one of these humans just killed Hawley in the Flaming Maple Forest, and left unscathed. That human is the priority target..."
<br><br>
"The group of humans who killed Hawley?!" Someone yelled from behind them.
<br><br>
Several other of their kind were not too far away, shocked by this revelation.
<br><br>
Hawley's death had been shocking news, and spread like wild fire throughout the entirety of the Grand Pure Realm in a matter of days. Those of their race were living closely to the Flaming Maple Forest, so they were the first to know.
<br><br>
The bull-headed creature standing before the ice piece could sense the fear of his kin. "The Misty River race that resides in the forest is incredibly strong," he shouted, "but they are not worthy of being mentioned outside the forest. Even if Hawley was defeated by the human, it only proves he was physically strong. What the fuck are you all afraid of?!"
<br><br>
"You're right! Hawley was untouchable only because he never left the forest. Otherwise, he'd have been eliminated by the Element Spirit Civilization," Another creature chimed in.
<br><br>
"The target has been marked!"
<br><br>
"The other races will also receive notice of this task."
<br><br>
"We have to do something before others decide to..."
<br><br>
The group of monsters were boiling over with excitement.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the same occurrence was happening among the other races all over the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Shadow Warriors had already left marks on the backs of the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi. This group of humans would be like beacons in the dark to the monsters hunting them from every direction.
<br><br>
The sharp sound of something flying through the air echoed all around.
<br><br>
Zen was zipping through the air at incredible speeds, maintaining the height of ten feet from the ground.
<br><br>
If the Snake Goddess's guidance was right, they should be able to find the entrance by heading north and then west.
<br><br>
There were many different entrances from the Grand Pure Realm to the Supreme Pure Realm. Each one was well designed and full of unknown dangers.
<br><br>
Nearly every non-human creature and Eternal Realm warrior who could enter the Supreme Pure Realm had their own unique methods.
<br><br>
"Those two brats are incredibly annoying!" King Ieuan grumbled as it turned around to look at the two Shadow Warriors flying through the sky.
<br><br>
They were keeping speed with Zen no matter how much faster he attempted to go. It seemed an impossible task to lose them.
<br><br>
"Hey! Look out!"
<br><br>
The Augury Dog beside Fuxi suddenly roared and warned, "There's something coming up ahead, very dangerous!"
<br><br>
He could sense danger with his intuition, although he couldn't tell exactly what kind of danger it was.
<br><br>
Zen squinted, trying to see what was ahead of them. An instant later, a long, thin, green arrow shot towards him.
<br><br>
The arrow was coming at him swiftly like a bolt of lightning.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen was always well prepared. With a slight tilt of his body, the arrow narrowly brushed past him.
<br><br>
"More are coming!" The Augury Dog observed.
<br><br>
They whistled through the air as they cut a straight path for them.
<br><br>
More arrows appeared ahead of them, twinkling in the sky like deadly green stars. Simultaneously they all were released and shot towards Zen. They were clumped together in irregular patterns, like a shower of flowers scattered by a fairy.
<br><br>
"Who's firing the arrows?! I can't see anyone." Zen asked.
<br><br>
"It must be the Arrow Demons!" King Ieuan answered. "They use unique arrows that can span across incredibly long distances. Normally, they must aim for the target by eyesight, but since our positions were marked by the Shadow Warriors, they only need to shoot in the direction of the marks."
<br><br>
Zen realized King Ieuan was right. The arrows weren't coming directly for him, they were heading for the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi on his back. The Arrow Demons couldn't actually see them.
<br><br>
The arrows continued to whistle through the air non-stop. When they were struck, they were destroyed with a loud crack.
<br><br>
Zen was avoiding as many of the arrows as he could, but when he couldn't evade them, he would swing his arm and easily deflect them to the ground.
<br><br>
The arrows seemed to have a mind of their own though. Whenever they would hit the ground, they'd ricochet off and continue their path to the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
It left Zen with no other choice but to reach out and snatch arrows to snap them.
<br><br>
Both the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew the arrows were coming for them, so they were using their theurgies to protect themselves.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had wrapped herself in a thick crimson shadow, while Eastern Emperor Taiyi had summoned his golden sword to circle around him.
<br><br>
The sword wouldn't move swiftly until an arrow came too close, then it would snap out and cut the arrow in half.
<br><br>
Despite the mass amount of arrows being rained down on them, very few actually made it near the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Zen continued his flight, remaining low to the ground. In the face of all the sharp obstacles racing towards him, his speed did not falter.
<br><br>
Chapter 3969 The Jade Bone Arrows About a hundred miles away from Zen, many creatures hung on the vines.
<br><br>
Their bodies had strange shapes and they dangled from the vines entangling the trees.
<br><br>
The lower part of their bodies was shaped like half a gourd. On the upper half were hard bones bending upwards, with golden manes falling from the end of the bones.
<br><br>
The hard bones were bows, and the manes were bowstrings. These short creatures were called Arrow Demons.
<br><br>
They took out many green arrows, and without any hesitation, started shooting them out.
<br><br>
The vine next to the leader of the Arrow Demons had already borne a huge fruit. The fruit looked exactly like an eyeball, with the white sclera and a pupil in the middle. This vine with an eye-shaped fruit was called the Heavenly Eye Vine.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine bore a fruit that functioned much better than a normal human eye. It had good eyesight that could see ten thousand miles away.
<br><br>
King Ieuan said that the Arrow Demons used the Shadow Marks to lock them, but its assumption was not completely right. The Arrow Demons also used the eyeball. After they found Zen and his group through the Shadow Marks, it was the eyeball that detected them.
<br><br>
All the Arrow Demons attacked according to what their leader saw.
<br><br>
The relationship between the Arrow Demons and the Heavenly Eye Vine was the same as that of the Misty River race and the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
They relied on each other to live.
<br><br>
"The Green Willow Arrows don't work on him. He has a very powerful body; no wonder he was able to kill Hawley,"
<br><br>
the leader of the Arrow Demons muttered. He saw Zen move so quickly even as arrows were shot one after another. They didn't stop or slow him down.
<br><br>
The leader's face darkened as he issued an order, "Use the Jade Bone Arrows!"
<br><br>
Hearing the leader's order, the Arrow Demons felt their hearts sink, but they still turned around. They forcefully pulled out the black hard bones extending from their gourd-like bodies.
<br><br>
The process of pulling out the hard bones was excruciating. Some of the Arrow Demons could not help but scream as blood spurted out.
<br><br>
After they had drawn the hard bones from their bodies, black gas began to fume from the bones. They then placed the hard bones on the bows. These bones turned out to be the Jade Bone Arrows that the leader had mentioned.
<br><br>
Every Arrow Demon would grow six black jade bones in their lifetime, and these bones could not be renewed. If all six bones were pulled out, the Arrow Demons would die.
<br><br>
In other words, they were shooting the Jade Bone Arrows at the risk of their lives.
<br><br>
Generally, the Arrow Demons were to use the Jade Bone Arrows when facing a deadly enemy.
<br><br>
However, the reward Slade offered, namely the Bone Fragments Secret Soul, was too tempting. The targets happened to pass by the Arrow Demons' territory, so they were determined not to let them go.
<br><br>
Under the command of the leader, all the Jade Bone Arrows were shot simultaneously.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the leader let out a long and loud roar.
<br><br>
"Woo!"
<br><br>
All the Jade Bone Arrows came to a stop, suspended in the air.
<br><br>
Phew! Phew! Phew! A strange shadow began to appear on one end of the Jade Bone Arrows.
<br><br>
It was a ferocious beast's head, covered with cyan skin, with fangs extending from its snout.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons had Feather Ghosts' unique bloodline. When the Jade Bone Arrows shot out, the leader had activated their bloodline theurgy.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As the leader's voice shrilled, the long arrows with the Feather Ghosts' heads wailed all over the sky. They shot towards Zen and his group about a hundred miles away.
<br><br>
When the Arrow Demons shifted to use the Jade Bone Arrows, the rain of green arrows halted.
<br><br>
However, Zen did not slow down. The Arrow Demons shot so many arrows towards him; he decided not to let them go.
<br><br>
"Why do the Arrow Demons stop after only three rounds of attacks?"
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked suspiciously.
<br><br>
"This is not their way of doing things," Yasamin said as she shook her head.
<br><br>
"They are not a powerful race in the Grand Pure Realm. The reason why they gain a foothold in it is that they have very powerful arrows. It is said that these arrows are shot at the expense of their lives..."
<br><br>
As the Snake Goddess spoke, the Augury Dog barked fiercely again.
<br><br>
He would remind them immediately whenever he sensed any danger, but this time, his bark had become wilder.
<br><br>
Then, Zen saw a large group of black dots floating from the distance. They looked like heads with sharp pointed teeth.
<br><br>
"Be careful, Zen. Those are the Jade Bone Arrows,"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven in Zen's mind reminded.
<br><br>
Although Yasamin, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi had heard of the Arrow Demons before, they had never provoked them. They didn't know much about the Jade Bone Arrows.
<br><br>
"Are they that powerful?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"They are arrows shot at the cost of the Arrow Demons' lives. They can directly kill their opponents, same as Gerald's Corroding Purple Rain," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.
<br><br>
There was a theurgy in the life truth called the Corroding Purple Rain, which was used as a weapon to kill. When the rain fell, it corroded several provinces, eating away all the lives in them.
<br><br>
In the battle against the Pear Hill, Gerald's opponents were the masters at the Eternal Realm. They were strong and thus unafraid that the raindrops could corrode their lives.
<br><br>
However, the Jade Bone Arrows were different. On one hand, they were more powerful than the Corroding Purple Rain; on the other hand, they killed a certain target in unison, unlike the scattered Corroding Purple Rain.
<br><br>
While the group learned the characteristics of the Jade Bone Arrows, the Jade Bone Arrow in front of them shot towards the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Almost faster than lightning, Zen grabbed it with his right hand.
<br><br>
He then exerted a powerful force, crushing the Jade Bone Arrow into tiny pieces. However, the Feather Ghost attached to the arrow had bitten into his arm, leaving a small mark.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The Feather Ghost's head disappeared. Zen felt cold rushing through his body as if something had vanished together with the Feather Ghost's head.
<br><br>
Before long, he realized that his life energy was deteriorating.
<br><br>
"Zen, are you okay?" The Snake Goddess keenly sensed that the arrow was not simple.
<br><br>
"Yes, I'm fine."
<br><br>
Zen was confident in his life energy and didn't dwell on it too much.
<br><br>
Facing the dense Jade Bone Arrows, he waved his arms that were thirty feet long and as wide as a wooden bucket.
<br><br>
The Jade Bone Arrows had their own consciousness. They still targeted the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi on Zen's shoulders. However, when the arrows were damaged, the Feather Ghosts' heads could only attack whoever was nearby.
<br><br>
In a flash, Zen had destroyed dozens of bone arrows, resulting in more Feather Ghosts' heads biting his arms.
<br><br>
Every time a Feather Ghost's head disappeared, he felt his body slowly turn cold, almost like a portion of his life energy was also being taken away.
<br><br>
At first, there hadn't been a noticeable change in his body, but as he shattered more and more bone arrows, his body finally revealed signs of decline.
<br><br>
Wrinkles and black spots were gradually developing on his originally bright and powerful body surface.
<br><br>
For only a short time, Zen had grown from a young man to a middle-aged man, and then to an old man.
<br><br>
Chapter 3970 A Deal "Zen, what's wrong with your body?"
<br><br>
Yasamin was the first one to notice the changes in Zen's body. It was weird and kind of creepy too.
<br><br>
The lifespan of powerful masters like Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi was limitless. As long as they weren't defeated by some extremely powerful entity, they were essentially immortal.
<br><br>
With such impossible ages, they could change their appearance too.
<br><br>
Yasamin had made herself look like an old person, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi always appeared as a middle-aged man. They had chosen these appearances just to be in charge of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The strange changes in Zen's body were occurring obviously because of those Jade Bone Arrows.
<br><br>
"The bone arrows are taking his life... They are sucking his existence from within him!" The Snake Goddess frowned.
<br><br>
Zen's life energy was being crazily devoured, and his speed, strength, reaction capacity and so many other factors were all being reduced significantly.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Four Jade Bone Arrows found a gap between Zen's hands and shot straight towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi sat down cross-legged in a flash and gently pointed with his finger. His sword immediately spiraled over and slashed at the Jade Bone Arrows.
<br><br>
Crack! The arrows were instantly slashed into two and fell down. However, the Feather Ghosts attached to them were not defeated. They dashed towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi and there was no way to dodge them.
<br><br>
Before Eastern Emperor Taiyi had time to react, the Feather Ghosts bit him and disappeared. Immediately, Eastern Emperor Taiyi turned from a middle-aged man into a very old man with white hair and ragged breathing.
<br><br>
From his condition, it seemed that he would be dead very soon.
<br><br>
"Impossible!"
<br><br>
"I didn't know the Jade Bone Arrows were so powerful. How's Zen doing that?"
<br><br>
"He's been hit by so many arrows and yet he lives..."
<br><br>
Seeing that Zen had withstood about three hundred arrows till now, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others had come to the conclusion that although the Jade Bone Arrows were quite powerful, they were still not as terrifying as they had heard of them to be.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was already at his last gasp after being hit by just four arrows! And Zen was still fighting.
<br><br>
Just how strong was the life energy of the latter? "Zen... Let's leave the Other Shore first! Squeak!" King Leuan said anxiously.
<br><br>
"There are too many bone arrows here. I'm afraid they will kill us all," the Snake Goddess also reminded him.
<br><br>
Previously, they had all insisted on not retreating from the Other Shore because they had already been marked. Even if they left the Other Shore and hid somewhere temporarily, they would still be at the risk of being pulled back. As long as the enemy was waiting for them, retreating from the Other Shore was much more dangerous than staying here.
<br><br>
But now that they were facing those Jade Bone Arrows, they would be killed anyway if they didn't leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven advised, "That's right! We'd better retreat at least for now. It would be unrealistic to pin the hopes on your bloodline."
<br><br>
Hearing that, Zen nodded silently.
<br><br>
Then the Augury Dog swiftly drilled into Fuxi's spirit beast bag, while everyone else recited the Illusion Breaking Rune and retreated quickly from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't too worried. He knew that it would be a piece of cake for the ancestry-level bloodline to replenish the life energy inside him.
<br><br>
The trouble, however, was that the bloodline was not under Zen's own control, and sometimes, it wouldn't be as effective as it should be. It was all up to the bloodline's mood. At the moment, he had no choice but to retreat.
<br><br>
They returned to the Pear Hill once again. The white-haired Eastern Emperor Taiyi was unable to hold on any longer and fell to the ground with a plop like dead meat.
<br><br>
His life energy had been used up and he was on the very verge of death.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stretched out her hand and gently brushed the air. A dark green pill appeared out of nowhere on her fingertips, immediately turning into a beam of green light and entering the body of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. However, with the damage the latter had suffered, this wasn't going to be enough.
<br><br>
"Go and ask Gerald to come over here now!" the Snake Goddess said in a hurry.
<br><br>
Without any delay, Fuxi moved away in a flash.
<br><br>
After a short while, Gerald's huge figure suddenly appeared in the sky, emitting green light and looking like a green sun.
<br><br>
Buzz! Two green light columns shot out from his two pincers.
<br><br>
The columns fell down on Eastern Emperor Taiyi who gradually became strong once again. His white hair quickly turned black in front of their very eyes and his body was filled with vitality once again.
<br><br>
"Thank you, Master Gerald," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said as he cupped his hands towards the air in a show of gratitude.
<br><br>
Gerald did not respond. Instead, he turned around and shot two more light pillars towards Zen.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
The light columns shone on Zen's body. A long time passed but no major change was visible! This was unusual! Gerald's eyes narrowed slightly and he immediately understood what was going on.
<br><br>
It wasn't that his life truth didn't work. But the problem was that the life energy which Zen had consumed was too much for him to recover in a short while. His body was like a bottomless abyss now, and it wasn't going to be easy to fill it up again.
<br><br>
Gerald naturally wouldn't give up. He concentrated and more and more life energy was continuously infused into Zen's body.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore The Jade Bone Arrows didn't fall down after being unable to find their targets anymore. Instead, they were dragged on by the Feather Ghosts and circled around the place where Zen and the others had been just moments ago.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons were not surprised at the sudden disappearance of Zen and his companions. They knew that the Eternal Realm warriors who came from the chaos would usually use this means to flee when in too much danger.
<br><br>
In order to counteract this, the creatures on the Other Shore would often prepare the Soul Interdicting Water and use it to lock their targets. However, this time, the incident had happened all of a sudden, and the Arrow Demons hadn't gotten a chance to apply the Soul Interdicting Water on their bodies.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
Numerous Arrow Demons were hanging on the green vines. Suddenly, the vines pierced through the ground and advanced forwards at an astonishing speed.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons had almost no ability to move. They had to rely one hundred percent on the Heavenly Eye Vine to move.
<br><br>
Pretty soon, using the vines, the Arrow Demons arrived at the place where Zen and the others had disappeared. Once again, the Heavenly Eye Vine grew crazily, and completely surrounded the area.
<br><br>
At the same time, the leader of the Arrow Demons spoke to a hill which was located nearby, "There's no point in hiding! The refracting skill is a mere trick. You cannot avoid being discovered by the heavenly eye!"
<br><br>
At his words, a twisted space suddenly appeared at the back of the hill. As it gradually took shape, three figures with the similar appearance to Norris' appeared. These were members of the Gear race! "Gah, Gah..."
<br><br>
As soon as the three members of the Gear race showed up, every single arrow was suddenly placed on the bowstrings by the Arrow Demons and pointed at them.
<br><br>
"We're not looking for trouble." The leader of these members of the Gear race raised both of his hands. Then, he continued, "Look. You've already caught the targets and can obtain the bounty, right?"
<br><br>
"It is none of your business," the leader of the Arrow Demons replied coldly.
<br><br>
Dozens of Jade Bone Arrows were still circling around in the sky, and below them was a thorny cage made of the Heavenly Eye Vine. The Arrow Demons were totally sure that they could catch Zen and his companions this time.
<br><br>
"But you still have one last step left." The man of the Gear race made a gesture of grabbing something in the air. "They are outside the Other Shore.
<br><br>
We'll bring them back. In return, all we want is one third of the Bone Fragments Secret Soul."
<br><br>
The leader of the Arrow Demons was not happy at all with this bargain. He replied in a cold voice, "Do you think only members of your Gear race can do this task? That's too much to ask!"
<br><br>
The member of the Gear race chuckled and replied, "You can ask help from the members of the Sickle race as well, but Zen is definitely not an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior. His physical body is astonishingly strong. Even some of the most powerful warriors of our Gear race won't be able to hold on for a single round during a fight with him, and his life energy is too much to drain, which means his recovery speed is also astonishing. It won't be long before he regains his life energy. Do you have the confidence to deal with him on your own?"
<br><br>
The leader of the Arrow Demons fell silent at this question.
<br><br>
He had spent so many Jade Bone Arrows already and had forced Zen to reach his limit, like a spent arrow. If what the member of the Gear race was saying was true, it would be a pity if he were to be stingy now.
<br><br>
"One fifth," said the leader of the Arrow Demons firmly.
<br><br>
"One-fourth," replied the member of the Gear race.
<br><br>
"Alright! Deal!"
<br><br>
As soon as the leader of the Arrow Demons finished speaking, the thorny vines that had formed the prison rolled around and created a path.
<br><br>
Chapter 3971 Inexhaustible Life Energy From the top of the Heavenly Eye Vine, the leader of the Arrow Demons squinted at the three figures in the distance.
<br><br>
The Jade Bone Arrows that spiraled in the air resembled vultures circling over their prey.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons were unwilling to give the Bone Fragments Secret Soul to the Gear race. The plan was once the members of the Gear race brought back the targets, they'd let the Jade Bone Arrows rain.
<br><br>
The Jade Bone Arrows were deadly. There was no way the targets or the members of the Gear race would come out of this alive.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons had lived with the Heavenly Eye Vine for so long.
<br><br>
They not only relied on their powerful archery skills for survival, but also their ruthlessness.
<br><br>
However, the three members of the Gear race didn't make a move after they entered the center. The one in the lead suddenly raised his head and announced, "We just swallowed the Exploding Fire Essence."
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, the leader and the other Arrow Demons were all stunned.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. As long as we're unhurt, they won't explode," he added.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons and the Heavenly Eye Vine trembled in fear. They were most afraid of the Exploding Fire Essence. If they set off the explosion of the Exploding Fire Essence, they would be doomed.
<br><br>
The three members of the Gear race eyed the Arrow Demons in the distance warily. When they were sure that they were in the clear, they began to look for Zen's shadow.
<br><br>
It was clear to them that although Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the Snake Goddess bore the marks of the Element Spirit Civilization, the main target was that giant human.
<br><br>
Orange lights flashed in their palms. Together, they grabbed at Zen's shadow which was projected on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Pear Hill, Gerald was rapidly infusing life energy into Zen's body.
<br><br>
As the Chaos Ancient God in charge of the life truth, his life energy was the strongest. It was easy for him to extract it through his bloodline, providing a steady supply of life energy for Zen.
<br><br>
However, it still cost Gerald quite a lot just to revive Zen.
<br><br>
From an old man, Zen suddenly reverted to being middle aged, then gradually, he returned to his youthful self. Around ninety percent of his life energy had been replenished when suddenly, his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he collapsed to the ground.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?"
<br><br>
"Why did he faint?"
<br><br>
"He has been pulled to the Other Shore," the Snake Goddess said once she figured it out.
<br><br>
"Let's go there too," Fuxi suggested, his eyes flashing with anger.
<br><br>
"Wait a moment," the Snake Goddess said, holding up her hand to stop him.
<br><br>
Everyone was well aware of the situation on the Other Shore. The Arrow Demons were not going to let them go. Not only would they be unable to help Zen, if they rashly returned to the Other Shore, they might even cause more trouble for him.
<br><br>
In the Grand Pure Realm, the three members of the Gear race were all stunned to see Zen have almost completely recovered.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons and the Heavenly Eye Vine were also surprised.
<br><br>
The amount of Zen's life energy that had been consumed was astronomical.
<br><br>
How was it possible he recovered so quickly? Zen locked eyes with the three members of the Gear race who trembled before him. With a shrug, Zen smiled at them. "You never learn your lesson.
<br><br>
Why do you always help those whom you shouldn't have helped?"
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
"Retreat!"
<br><br>
"Leave!"
<br><br>
The three members of the Gear race, immediately realizing something was wrong, attempted to retreat quickly.
<br><br>
Zen, of course, wasn't planning on letting them go that easily.
<br><br>
Planting his foot firmly on the ground, he launched himself towards them, racing towards them like a bull. In the blink of an eye, he had pounced on the last member of the Gear race, pinning him to the ground.
<br><br>
When the other two members realized what had happened, they pressed onward with no hesitation. In their eyes, Zen killing their companion bought them some time to get away.
<br><br>
But to their horror, when they looked back, Zen had stomped on their companion's head, and was already heading towards them.
<br><br>
In two strides, Zen already caught up to the other two.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Zen drew an arc in the air. Using only his palm, he sliced the heads off of the two members of the Gear race. Their heads rolled on the ground, their expressions frozen in fear. A few moments later, their lifeless bodies collapsed to the ground.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! While this was happening, the Heavenly Eye Vine, along with the Arrow Demons, had fled quickly.
<br><br>
"Those liars! They didn't swallow the Exploding Fire Essence!" the leader of the Arrow Demons roared angrily.
<br><br>
On the one hand, they were putting distance between them and Zen; on the other, they were so afraid that the Exploding Fire Essence would be activated, so they immediately took off. To their surprise, even with the three members of the Gear race dead, there were no explosions.
<br><br>
"Well then..." The leader of the Arrow Demons suddenly let out a long roar.
<br><br>
The Jade Bone Arrows that had been circling in the air all suddenly shot towards Zen.
<br><br>
At the same time, under Zen's feet, many sharp thorny vines broke through the soil and wrapped around him.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! Those Jade Bone Arrows were unable to pierce through Zen's tough skin and became blunt. However, the Feather Ghosts that were attached to the arrows drilled into his body one after another.
<br><br>
"Everyone, please offer your black jade bones!"
<br><br>
There weren't many black jade bones left for the Arrow Demons, but they had no other choice at the moment. They had to take Zen down at any cost, or they would be doomed.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine also knew this. It continued wrapping its branches around Zen, layer by layer.
<br><br>
However, Zen just calmly shook his body slightly, breaking off all the thorns. He raised his arms fiercely, breaking off the vines as he did.
<br><br>
As soon as the vines fell to the ground, a volley of Jade Bone Arrows showered over him.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons were desperate. For some, giving up their last black jade bone meant death, yet they still offered it to their companions. They were willing to sacrifice themselves to kill Zen.
<br><br>
With countless Jade Bone Arrows attacking Zen, it took a toll on his body.
<br><br>
Zen began to age quickly.
<br><br>
In the meantime, from the Pear Hill, everyone could see what was happening. Immediately, Gerald leaped into action and extended a pair of pincers, replenishing Zen's life energy once more.
<br><br>
More and more Arrow Demons fell as they offered their last arrows, while Gerald consumed the power of life truth.
<br><br>
Under the rain of arrows, Zen flew up to the nearest vine and grabbed it.
<br><br>
Clasping the vine in both hands, he shook it violently. The small Arrow Demons all fell to the ground. Swiftly, Zen squashed them all with just one finger.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons could only put up a fight from afar using their archery skills, as face-to-face combat proved fatal to them.
<br><br>
Zen followed the thick Heavenly Eye Vine all the way to the top till he finally faced the leader of the Arrow Demons.
<br><br>
"Why... Why is your life energy inexhaustible?" the leader asked in a trembling voice.
<br><br>
Desperately, he looked at Zen with pleading yet disbelieving eyes. On his way up, Zen had already been pierced by around five hundred Jade Bone Arrows, yet he still glowed youthfully. Such a feat was inconceivable.
<br><br>
Chapter 3972 The Whining Road Zen looked at the leader of the Arrow Demons indifferently. Then, he stretched out his right hand in a flash.
<br><br>
Before the leader could even try to beg for mercy, he was smashed into a cloud of blood.
<br><br>
The leader might've been dead, but the eye of the Heavenly Eye Vine still floated around.
<br><br>
"Can you speak?" Zen asked, staring at the eye.
<br><br>
The eye just stared back at him blankly, as though it were dead. The vines that had been attacking Zen now too were motionless.
<br><br>
"If you are playing dead, then you can go to hell." Zen then clenched his fists, poised to strike.
<br><br>
As the eye sensed that it was in grave danger, a purple vine as thick as a finger suddenly extended towards Zen. When it touched him, a strand of consciousness was transmitted to him. "Yes, I can speak. Please don't hurt me."
<br><br>
The voice sounded like a human woman's. Moreover, it sounded very weak.
<br><br>
Zen could sense that the Heavenly Eye Vine had a strong desire to live.
<br><br>
"You were trying to kill us just now. What makes you think you deserve to live?" Zen asked harshly.
<br><br>
The situation in the Three Purities Stage was extremely chaotic. Even the Element Spirit Civilization did not implement any rules here. Although the creatures of different races were intelligent, they followed the law of the jungle: kill, or be killed.
<br><br>
"It's those damned Arrow Demons that wanted to kill you. They enslaved me. I had no choice but to follow their orders," the Heavenly Eye Vine said to Zen, trying to disassociate itself from the killing.
<br><br>
"I see... So, how to enslave you?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
The big eye of the Heavenly Eye Vine trembled. Of course, it didn't want to be enslaved by Zen. It just wanted him to let it go.
<br><br>
"Tell me," Zen urged.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine realized that it couldn't fool Zen. A vine grew from its eye. The vine extended towards Zen to reveal a small tender sprout on its tip.
<br><br>
"This sprout is my source of life," the Heavenly Eye Vine admitted.
<br><br>
Although it was a plant, it was good at discerning people. It knew that if it refused to tell Zen, then Zen would kill it on the spot.
<br><br>
In order to survive, how could it dare to hide anything? Zen reached out his hand to touch the source of life of the Heavenly Eye Vine, and he could feel its vigorous life energy. He could even read its memories. The Heavenly Eye Vine spoke the truth. This small sprout indeed controlled its life and death.
<br><br>
Carefully holding the sprout, Zen immediately left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The people in the Pear Hill were still a little worried, and Gerald was on standby, just in case Zen was in need of replenished life energy.
<br><br>
But as they watched, they could see Zen was handling things well on his own. So everybody waited quietly.
<br><br>
Although they knew clearly how powerful Zen was, the creatures in the Three Purities Stage on the Other Shore had different methods. In addition to sucking Zen's life energy, there were many other methods. Naturally, they were still a little worried.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen didn't make them wait too long. After a while, he woke up.
<br><br>
"How's everything going?" Fuxi asked first.
<br><br>
"I have taken care of them," Zen replied calmly.
<br><br>
Everyone looked at him expectantly.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons had been guarding the place where they left the Other Shore, and their deadly Jade Bone Arrows were a force to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
It was likely that Zen was forcefully pulled to the Other Shore by the Gear race or the other races. It was not easy to eliminate all those creatures.
<br><br>
"All the creatures have been killed?" the Snake Goddess clarified.
<br><br>
Zen smiled. "I think so. But there is one thing left. Follow me, and you will know what it is."
<br><br>
Then, he returned to the Other Shore, closely followed by the Snake Goddess, King Ieuan and the other three Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
When they saw the winding Heavenly Eye Vine, they eyed it vigilantly, ready to attack if need be. The Heavenly Eye Vine and the Arrow Demons had lived together for quite a long time. Although it was not powerful, it was still quite troublesome to deal with it.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! The Heavenly Eye Vine's head looped around a bit before it extended towards the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. Then, Zen popped out from above and said excitedly, "Please, come up!"
<br><br>
"Come up?" Yasamin frowned.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess trusted Zen. She then jumped onto the vine. "I heard that all the Arrow Demons are blind. Their invincible archery technique relies on the eye of the Heavenly Eye Vine. Today is the first time I've seen this eye."
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons were tyrannical. Normally, few creatures could get close to them, so even the Snake Goddess didn't know that much about them.
<br><br>
After everyone climbed onto the vine, Zen used the big eye to look around.
<br><br>
The eye had good eyesight, and it could see everything within a radius of ten thousand miles.
<br><br>
On the other side of the Flaming Maple Forest, there was some sort of a commotion. Upon a closer look, Zen realized many flying snakes with transparent wings were heading straight for him.
<br><br>
On the southwest side, dozens of tall and sturdy bull-headed men carried golden axes and were steadily making their way over.
<br><br>
On the northwest side...
<br><br>
After Zen surveyed his surroundings for a while, his expression grew serious. He even saw the two remaining kings from the Land of Diabolic Demons.
<br><br>
The creatures in the Grand Pure Realm were not easy to deal with. They each had an extraordinary ability. It had taken Zen a lot of energy to deal with the Arrow Demons alone. If these creatures were to besiege Zen and his group, the situation would look dim.
<br><br>
"Go north!"
<br><br>
Zen ordered the Heavenly Eye Vine.
<br><br>
Although the Heavenly Eye Vine was only a plant, it moved surprisingly fast.
<br><br>
Previously, it was over a hundred miles away from Zen, but it carried a group of Arrow Demons and rushed to him very quickly.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! The Heavenly Eye Vine didn't dare to disobey Zen. It sent a message to Zen, telling him and his group to hold onto it.
<br><br>
Then the ground began to tremble, and the thick vine drilled into the ground and quickly moved north.
<br><br>
However, despite the Heavenly Eye Vine's speed, it was still unable to evade the watchers in the sky. Two Shadow Warriors flew in the air, following closely behind them.
<br><br>
The three members of the Element Spirit race, Claire, Les and Slade, had all seen what had just happened.
<br><br>
"It's meaningless to have sent those good-for-nothings," Les sneered.
<br><br>
"That's not necessarily the case," said Claire, shaking her head. "The Arrow Demons are very powerful. If it weren't for the Chaos Ancient God of the life truth, they would have already..."
<br><br>
At first, she wanted to say that they would have a slim chance of survival, but on second thought, she felt it was inappropriate to say so.
<br><br>
Zen's bloodline was too strange. Every time he was pushed to the limit, something unexpected would happen.
<br><br>
Staring at Zen in the ice silently, Slade suddenly said, "Since they keep heading north, they plan to enter the Supreme Pure Realm through the Whining Road."
<br><br>
He pointed at the ice and a map appeared on it.
<br><br>
"The Whining Road?"
<br><br>
"Sounds reasonable."
<br><br>
Both Les and Claire were very surprised. There were many roads leading to the Supreme Pure Realm, and the Element Spirit Civilization could easily pass through thirteen of them, excluding the Whining Road. It was known to all that this road was not easy to pass.
<br><br>
Chapter 3973 Interceptor Every Eternal Realm warrior that could enter the Supreme Pure Realm had their own unique methods.
<br><br>
So it wasn't surprising that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had grasped a secret that the Element Spirit Civilization had never mastered.
<br><br>
Once again, Slade stretched out his hand and marked an area in the north of the Grand Pure Realm on the map, saying, "They will have to pass through here on their way to the Whining Road."
<br><br>
Claire squinted at the map. "It's the territory of the Mystical Void race."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Les asked.
<br><br>
"Send some people to frighten the creatures of the Mystical Void race, and this area will be completely sealed," said Slade unhurriedly. "Once the creatures of the Mystical Void race seal this space, they can only choose to pass the Purple Wind Gorge."
<br><br>
Claire looked calculative at Slade's words before asking, "The Purple Wind Gorge is about to get windy?"
<br><br>
Slade said in an emotionless voice, "Yes. Ninety-nine days form one period, and after this period of time passes, the wind will start again."
<br><br>
"If there is a gust of wind, they will be stuck in the Purple Wind Gorge. Zen is powerful, but he might not be able to survive in face of so many warriors from different races in the Grand Pure Realm laying siege around him!"
<br><br>
Claire's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..." Slade burst out into emotionless laughter.
<br><br>
"You may be proud but please don't laugh like a maniac!" Les muttered, irritated.
<br><br>
Slade was not an individual. When the many members of the Element Spirit race expressed their feelings through him, it was like a torture to Les.
<br><br>
There was a wide passage at the bottom of the Dual Topknot Mountain.
<br><br>
This passage was in the north of the Grand Pure Realm and was called the Silent Path by the members of various races.
<br><br>
The Silent Path was safe. As long as one followed the rules, they wouldn't be attacked or be in danger.
<br><br>
But as the name of the passage suggested, people had to keep absolutely silent while passing through the Silent Path and not make any sound.
<br><br>
Silence was the biggest rule here.
<br><br>
A few fist-sized creatures floated in the air along the Silent Path. These creatures were shaped like jellyfish, looked cottony, and were light as air.
<br><br>
They floated in every corner of the Silent Path at all times of the day.
<br><br>
These white flocculent creatures belonged to the Mystical Void race.
<br><br>
The Mystical Void creatures weren't all that intelligent. They fed on space and never contacted the outside world. It was difficult for people from the outside world to capture or interfere with them.
<br><br>
Some even maintained that the members of the Mystical Void race were not living beings, but just another form of space.
<br><br>
The biggest weakness of the Mystical Void race was their cowardice. Any loud noise would spook them and they'd immediately transform from the flocculent form into the space form.
<br><br>
In their space form, they were compressed together and had once crushed many warriors of different races into dust. Only a small number of people could still walk out of the Silent Path after provoking the Mystical Void race.
<br><br>
After Slade gave the order, six nonhuman warriors arrived at the Silent Path.
<br><br>
They were silent as they flew along the Silent Path.
<br><br>
Every dozens of miles, they had placed a silver tube that looked like a whistle on the ground. This way, there were a large number of tubes along the way.
<br><br>
They had walked through the entire Silent Path when one of the warriors reached out a hand and gently pressed the tube at the end.
<br><br>
The silver tube suddenly began to whistle a harsh, keening sound.
<br><br>
The Silent Path was eerily quiet, and the sudden whistling sound was particularly shrill and loud.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
A creature of the Mystical Void race above the silver tube shook violently, its cotton-like body beginning to expand and turning into a milky white space that expanded in all directions.
<br><br>
The space grew larger by ten times, a thousand times, a million times! As the space expanded, it crashed into the bodies of the six warriors, sending them flying.
<br><br>
The silver tubes in the Silent Path began to whistle in unison, the sound even louder than before.
<br><br>
The usually quiet Silent Path became so noisy that almost all the members of the Mystical Void race were surprised. Their bodies began to swell and they began to turn into the space forms.
<br><br>
These huge spaces squeezed and merged with each other.
<br><br>
It looked like countless bubbles merging together, forming a peculiar golden color.
<br><br>
When the six warriors stood up from the ground and saw this, their hearts still fluttered with fear.
<br><br>
If they remained in the Silent Path, they would be squeezed into meat paste by these space bubbles.
<br><br>
When the members of the Mystical Void race were frightened, they'd become like this for a full month, which meant that the Silent Path would be closed for a month and that the task that Slade had given to the six warriors could be considered completed.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine emerged from the ground like a snake and dived back into the ground. This happened multiple times, completely destroying the soil along the way.
<br><br>
Zen looked back through the heavenly eye, frowning.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine was fast and moved in a rather extraordinary manner. But the warriors of various races weren't any slower. More and more warriors had gathered in just a short period of time.
<br><br>
These warriors followed it all the way but couldn't catch up soon enough.
<br><br>
But they would besiege Zen and his companions if they were to be intercepted.
<br><br>
"How soon will we arrive at the Whining Road?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess took some time to calculate it all and replied, "It's not far from here. There should be around a hundred thousand miles before we reach it. Everything will be fine as long as we pass through the Silent Path."
<br><br>
"Then you'd better speed up," Zen said to the Heavenly Eye Vine.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine whined and complained, "I'm moving at the highest speed!"
<br><br>
Zen merely stared at it, ice in his gaze, and the Heavenly Eye Vine trembled. It frantically activated its own strength and sped up.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine had just caught a steady faster speed when an invisible space wall hit it with an almighty bang.
<br><br>
Under such great inertia, Zen, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others slammed into the space wall.
<br><br>
Logic dictated that it was impossible to not notice the space wall before them, given everyone's powerful perceptions. But they were now caught off guard, crashing unceremoniously into it.
<br><br>
It was not, however, a big deal for the Eternal Realm warriors present.
<br><br>
Zen stood firm, frowning and slapping the space wall with his hands.
<br><br>
Crack! The space wall broke with a resounding crack.
<br><br>
He smashed the space wall, causing a phantom-like figure to charge at him.
<br><br>
This was an Eternal Realm warrior who had come from the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
Zen didn't hesitate and landed a blow on the man's head.
<br><br>
No one in the Grand Pure Realm could withstand his punch. Not even the Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't expected the opponent to not dodge his attack. Instead, the warrior launched a palm strike towards Zen.
<br><br>
"You're courting death," Zen warned.
<br><br>
He could feel that something was wrong, but he still chose to fight back.
<br><br>
The moment his fist and the opponent's palm met, he felt the softness of his opponent's palm, and could not find any area of the palm to apply his force.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha-ha!"
<br><br>
The man laughed, his entire body collapsing into spider threads and wrapping around Zen's entire body.
<br><br>
Zen wanted to struggle against the spider threads, but although they were thin and soft, they couldn't be broken or pulled apart.
<br><br>
It was then that two more people appeared on the ground. These were identical twins and were also at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
They held hands face to face, and a black hole appeared between them. The hole erupted with great magnetic force and sucked Zen into it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3974 Eternal Realm Hunters As soon as Zen was sucked into the black hole, the two Eternal Realm warriors let go of each other's hands, and the black hole disappeared! They smiled as though they had won an incredible prize.
<br><br>
Soon after, a thread as thin as silk appeared behind them, intertwining around itself until it formed a figure of a creature. It was the Eternal Realm warrior that had entangled Zen earlier! Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others who were knocked out finally regained their senses. When they saw the three Eternal Realm warriors grinning at them in a sinister fashion, their faces fell. Did Zen just disappear with the black hole? "Who are you?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
As though they had heard the most absurd question, the three Eternal Realm warriors burst into laughter.
<br><br>
"'Who are we?" one of them echoed sarcastically.
<br><br>
"How dare you ask us such a stupid question!"
<br><br>
"Maybe it's because we have stayed in the Supreme Pure Realm for a long time and the lowly creatures in the Grand Pure Realm have forgotten us,"
<br><br>
the third one sneered. "Well, it's time to make a name for ourselves once more."
<br><br>
The three Eternal Realm warriors looked very experienced.
<br><br>
In their eyes, the Heavenly Eye Vine wasn't worth taking seriously.
<br><br>
Even the five warriors at the Eternal Realm before them weren't worthy to them.
<br><br>
They had only targeted Zen. Now that they had gotten rid of him, the others didn't seem to pose a threat.
<br><br>
"How arrogant you are!" Yasamin cried angrily.
<br><br>
King Ieuan's bean-sized eyes flickered with recognition. "I remember! They are the Eternal Realm Hunters!"
<br><br>
Hearing this, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others gasped.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunters were known to be a team made up of the Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Besides the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race, the Eternal Realm Hunters had also gained a foothold in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
They never had a stand; they joined neither the Nihility race nor the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
There used to be more than 20 Eternal Realm Hunters, all of whom were outstanding warriors at the Eternal Realm and were extremely good at combat. It was said that they had once fought with the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Although they were defeated by the Grandmaster of Heaven, they still managed to escape from the Nihility race safely. It was easy to tell they were a force to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
Because they had no stand, as long as they wanted something, they would exhaust all efforts to get it, even if it meant crossing other super forces' paths. Additionally, they had been very active over the years.
<br><br>
At some point, they were chased by the creatures of other races. A big war took place on a mountain located in the Grand Pure Realm, and they had suffered heavy losses. Only three of them managed to escape.
<br><br>
These three people were the strongest among all the Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
The creatures of other races gnashed their teeth in hatred, but they could do nothing to the three of them.
<br><br>
It was not until the three Eternal Realm Hunters found a way to enter the Supreme Pure Realm that peace was finally restored in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others reached the Eternal Realm and went to the Grand Pure Realm, the three Eternal Realm Hunters had already gone to the Supreme Pure Realm, so they had never encountered each other. However, the Eternal Realm Hunters were famous; it was rare for one to not have heard of them.
<br><br>
As the king of the Ear Mouse race, King Ieuan liked to collect and exchange all kinds of information wherever it went. It knew the Eternal Realm Hunters the best.
<br><br>
However, even it didn't expect that they'd run into the Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, King Ieuan cupped its hands towards the three Eternal Realm Hunters respectfully. "You three are from the Grand Plain Stage, and all of us are at the Eternal Realm. Why did you attack us?"
<br><br>
In fact, there was a big difference in the strength of different Eternal Realm warriors. Moreover, in the Grand Plain Stage alone, there were ruling civilizations, and also creatures that were born on the Other Shore, who followed the Finale Way, the Purge Way or the Nihility Way.
<br><br>
However, the Eternal Realm was only a realm, not a status. There was no need to form relations with other Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
But then again, the vast majority of the Eternal Realm warriors found it difficult to make progress in the Three Purities Stage. After all, they were all on the same stage. Under normal circumstances, they would help each other, except for those who were from opposing forces.
<br><br>
The three Eternal Realm Hunters had no enmity with them, so King Ieuan wanted to persuade them to let them be.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunter who could turn into threads laughed heartily.
<br><br>
"You have no enmity with us, but the Element Spirit Civilization has enmity with you."
<br><br>
"So the famous Eternal Realm Hunters have joined the Element Spirit Civilization?" King Ieuan asked, narrowing its beady eyes.
<br><br>
The twins at the Eternal Realm were wearing a careless smile on their faces, but when they heard this, their expressions suddenly grew serious. One of them snapped, "What are you talking about? How could we join them? It's just that they're offering us the Bone Fragments Secret Soul if we capture you. So, here we are!"
<br><br>
The other continued, "Just give up. If you do, we promise to treat you nicely." He smiled mischievously. "Maybe the Element Spirit Civilization will even spare you!"
<br><br>
"Stop talking to them," the Eternal Realm Hunter behind the twins snapped impatiently. "These people are our targets. Just kill them." With a wave of his hand, he transformed into threads once more that floated in the wind.
<br><br>
It was after being entangled by the threads that Zen fell into the black hole without resistance. The threads were not as simple as they looked.
<br><br>
Naturally, the four human masters didn't plan to sit still and await their deaths. Simultaneously, their eyes lit up as the energy within their bodies surged excitedly.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine continued to extend its sharp thorny vines underground. Its life source was still in Zen's hands. Even for its own sake, it had to fight desperately these three Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
Only King Ieuan remained unmoving. Instead, it continued negotiating. "I know you are from the Knotting race, and your names are Sawyer and Thurston. Back then, the whole Knotting race was killed by the Element Spirit Civilization. You have a grudge against the Element Spirit Civilization, so why do you help them now?"
<br><br>
The older brother of the twins was Sawyer, and the younger one was Thurston. The Eternal Realm Hunter behind them was Pearson. These names were given after they became the Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
At the mention of the painful past, hatred flashed in the eyes of Sawyer and Thurston. Sawyer said, "We just want the Bone Fragments Secret Soul. We will never take the Element Spirit Civilization's side. Sooner or later, we will avenge our clansmen!"
<br><br>
King Ieuan had already expected this. It continued, "The Knotting race used to be a dominating civilization. It is said that in order to complete the Finale Way, tens of billions of its people offered their blood, but in the end, their efforts were all in vain. We really admire them. But now you help the Element Spirit Civilization hinder the completion of the Finale Way. You're holding the candle to the devil!"
<br><br>
"Cut the crap!"
<br><br>
Pearson shook his hands, and the threads all over the sky were about to wrap up the crowd.
<br><br>
Just then, Sawyer suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Pearson by the shoulder. With a faint smile on his face and a crazed look in his eyes, he asked, "The completion of the Finale Way? Do you think you can complete it?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3975 The Black Sun Sawyer and Thurston had not been born on the Other Shore—rather, they came from the chaos.
<br><br>
The Knotting race was the ruling civilization of the 733rd chaos. Sawyer and Thurston were the most capable assistants of the strongest warrior in the Knotting race.
<br><br>
As King Ieuan had said, the Knotting race was known for the courage of its members.
<br><br>
In the quest to achieve the Finale Way, many members of the Knotting race had been killed as blood sacrifices. But it was all in vain. The strongest warrior had still failed, and could only lead the remaining members to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, even on the Other Shore, the Knotting race still advocated the Finale Way. This put them at odds with the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Eventually, the strongest warrior of the Knotting race was killed by the Eye Spirit, along with almost all the other members of the race. Only Sawyer and his brother Thurston had survived.
<br><br>
Like all the members of the Knotting race, the two brothers used to have a deep obsession with the Finale Way. But after they became Eternal Realm Hunters, they gradually began to give up on achieving it. Now, after long years of staying in the Three Purities Stage, they never mentioned the Finale Way anymore.
<br><br>
King Ieuan suddenly said something that immediately caught their attention. It told them that they could realize the Finale Way. Sawyer looked at first shocked, then he smirked as though he'd heard a funny joke.
<br><br>
"So, you are the creatures in the current chaos?" Thurston asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," said King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"This round of chaos is about to come to an end soon. I wonder whether you have been fully prepared, and how strong the strongest of you truly is,"
<br><br>
said Sawyer in a mocking tone.
<br><br>
King Ieuan pondered this for a few moments. Then it shook its head. "I don't know."
<br><br>
Sawyer let out a sharp bark of laughter.
<br><br>
"Since going to the Supreme Pure Realm, we have paid little attention to what is happening in the chaos, but we know clearly that there is no ruling force in this round," he said. "What makes you think you can realize the Finale Way?"
<br><br>
There were many preparations needed in order to complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
A ruling civilization established its dominion and ensured that no other force in the chaos could resist it. This allowed the members of that civilization to focus on preparing for the completion of the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Now, however, the various super forces in the chaos were fighting each other. How could anyone have the time to prepare for the Finale Way? Sawyer's question left King Ieuan speechless.
<br><br>
It quickly realized that Sawyer was right.
<br><br>
So far, almost no preparations had been made for the Finale Way.
<br><br>
How could they complete it? The Snake Goddess listened calmly from where she stood on the vine.
<br><br>
Something flickered in her eyes as she said, "Although our human race is not a ruling force, we have killed Claire from the Element Spirit Civilization and the Grandmaster of Heaven from the Nihility race."
<br><br>
Her words surprised Sawyer, Thurston, and Pearson greatly.
<br><br>
Both Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven were top masters on the Other Shore. Had the members of the human race truly defeated them? What great abilities did they possess to accomplish such feats? Sawyer sneered. In a tone of skepticism, he said, "Do you have any proof? Are we supposed to simply believe your claims?"
<br><br>
It was hard to fathom the truth of what the Snake Goddess said, since they had not seen Claire or the Grandmaster of Heaven defeated with their own eyes.
<br><br>
"Why else do you think is the Element Spirit Civilization so determined to kill us? Even at the cost of the Bone Fragments Secret Soul?" the Snake Goddess asked coolly.
<br><br>
Sawyer hesitated, exchanging glances with Thurston. The brothers realized that what the Snake Goddess said made sense.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the three Eternal Realm Hunters, this task was extremely simple.
<br><br>
Zen was obviously the most powerful in his group.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had used the ice piece to pass its orders and tasks to other creatures. Somehow, the Eternal Realm Hunters had managed to get their hands on an ice piece, through which they received the current task. They then conducted an investigation and learned that Zen had massive physical strength, and that he had killed Hawley in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
Thus, based on what the Eternal Realm Hunters knew about the Flaming Maple Forest, Zen had a stronger body than Hawley.
<br><br>
However, the Eternal Realm Hunters weren't afraid of a powerful body or physical strength alone. Without the suppression of the Flaming Maple Forest, they thought it would not be difficult for them to kill Zen using their theurgies.
<br><br>
The task proved as simple as they had anticipated. Zen had no time to fight back before he fell into the Black Sun of Sawyer and Thurston.
<br><br>
But why did the Element Spirit Civilization have to chase after this human team? They had offered the Bone Fragments Secret Soul as a reward. They had mobilized almost all the creatures in the Grand Pure Realm. Clearly, the Element Spirit Civilization was determined to kill these humans.
<br><br>
"You want us to let you go, right? It's impossible! We'll kill you!"
<br><br>
With an audible hiss, the spider threads spread out over the humans.
<br><br>
The threads enveloped Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi saw that battle was unavoidable, and his eyes began to flash with a deep golden light. The brilliance of his golden sword was blinding.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Yasamin flipped her hand, and a bone sword appeared in her grip. It looked ordinary, but as she brandished it, the sword emanated a mysterious and powerful aura.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan also activated their bloodlines.
<br><br>
They all understood that they were fighting for their lives, so they would enter this battle at full strength.
<br><br>
The air soon filled with powerful auras.
<br><br>
Green shoots suddenly sprouted from the ground as the Heavenly Eye Vine joined the battle. The shoots rapidly grew into countless thick, thorny vines, transforming the flat ground into a dense, prickly forest.
<br><br>
As the battle was about to start, Sawyer and Thurston felt an unexpected vibration in their chests. Suddenly, two black semicircles appeared out of nowhere, marking their bodies.
<br><br>
The two brothers stared down at the black semicircles on their chests, wearing identical expressions of shock and confusion.
<br><br>
Pearson had already begun to launch an attack, but he stopped abruptly, gazing warily at the strange black marks.
<br><br>
The Black Sun was a bloodline theurgy unique to Sawyer and Thurston.
<br><br>
Only when the two brothers faced each other could the complete Black Sun be summoned.
<br><br>
The Black Sun was an incomprehensible world. If any god was trapped inside, they would be killed—there was no possibility of survival.
<br><br>
Indeed, the most significant feature of the Black Sun was the impossibility of escaping from it. Once Sawyer and Thurston separated, there would be no exit.
<br><br>
No matter how strong one was and what special abilities they had, they could never pass through an exit that did not exist.
<br><br>
For instance, once in the Supreme Pure Realm, the three Eternal Realm Hunters had encountered the immortal Cyan Bone Ghosts, and used the Black Sun on them.
<br><br>
It was said that the ninety-nine Cyan Bone Ghosts in the Supreme Pure Realm never died. They had wandered aimlessly for a long time in the Supreme Pure Realm, killing countless creatures who crossed their paths.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race had been unable to deal with them, and instead evaded the Cyan Bone Ghosts when they encountered them.
<br><br>
But when Sawyer and Thurston had encountered them, two Cyan Bone Ghosts had been devoured by the Black Sun. They were never seen again after that—for all intents and purposes, they were dead, killed by the Black Sun.
<br><br>
Since even the Cyan Bone Ghosts couldn't escape the Black Sun, how could Zen ever manage it? After Sawyer and Thurston sucked Zen into the Black Sun, they were absolutely certain that he was not only gone, but dead.
<br><br>
They had never imagined that someone could survive after being devoured by the Black Sun. It was too strange to even consider.
<br><br>
"What's happening?" Pearson asked quickly, looking with concern at the brothers.
<br><br>
"I—I don't know. I have never seen half of the Black Sun before—"
<br><br>
As Sawyer spoke, he was interrupted by movement within the black semicircle on his chest. He staggered backwards. Something was crawling out from within the dark depths.
<br><br>
It was half a body. Everyone stared, mouths gaping, while the other half of the body also crawled out from the semicircle in Thurston's chest.
<br><br>
The movements of the two halves were coordinated. Obviously, they belonged to a single being, although an invisible space in the middle still separated them as they crawled out.
<br><br>
The two halves of the Black Sun exerted an irresistible gravitational force upon each other. Independent of any action by Sawyer and Thurston, the two black semicircles drew closer and closer to each other, dragging the two brothers towards one another.
<br><br>
Finally, the two halves met, and the Black Sun was formed. As the circle became whole, so did the two halves of the body, joining together to form a single human shape.

Although the people around him could not see his appearance clearly, his eight-foot-tall figure gave away that he was Zen.
<br><br>
"Cough, cough, cough..."
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen coughed violently and spat out a black mass.
<br><br>
He coughed up so much it took him a long time to recover.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Sawyer and Thurston still couldn't believe and wondered how he had escaped.
<br><br>
After all, such a thing never happened before.
<br><br>
The only unexpected thing that happened was that the Cyan Bone Ghosts' bodies were too powerful and remained intact for a long while in the Black Sun.
<br><br>
Back then, the Cyan Bone Ghosts, who were still alive after being absorbed, wanted to escape, but Sawyer quickly put Thurston's hand down, so they failed to get out.
<br><br>
However, the situation was completely different this time.
<br><br>
Usually, they controlled the Black Sun, but now it was the Black Sun that controlled them. The two brothers never imagined that such a thing would happen.
<br><br>
"He got out of the Black Sun by force. What kind of strength does it need?"
<br><br>
In shock, Thurston looked at Zen, who was coughing.
<br><br>
The two brothers had controlled the Black Sun for a long time, and during that period, they thoroughly studied it.
<br><br>
According to their study, someone unknown had created the Black Sun. It should be a remarkably perfect prison.
<br><br>
Anyone who got locked up inside it could not get out unless both Sawyer and Thurston helped them.
<br><br>
From the design point of view, the Black Sun was perfect.
<br><br>
Yet, today, someone broke this perfect philosophy and got out of it.
<br><br>
"What are you waiting for? Swallow him again! I don't believe he can escape a second time!"
<br><br>
Pearson quickly jumped up, and the spider threads swerved towards the opposite direction and shrouded Zen.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen, who was still in a fit of violent coughs, suddenly stopped.
<br><br>
Then in a bent position, he turned his head and stared at Pearson.
<br><br>
His whole body was pitch black, but his eyeballs were a little white. His bright and sharp eyes were like arrows that were ready to leave the bowstring any time, which unnerved Pearson and slightly weakened his momentum.
<br><br>
The moment Pearson paused for a bit, Zen fiercely pounced forward with his hands on the ground. Then, he ran like a cheetah for two steps and finally grabbed Pearson by the neck.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Pearson's head collided against the ground as Zen seized his neck and firmly pressed his body down.
<br><br>
Whap! Afterward, Zen pushed his body to make a ditch on the ground, and then raised a fist to punch him.
<br><br>
If Zen punched him, he would surely die.
<br><br>
Just as Zen's fist touched the tip of his nose, his head and body suddenly turned into thin spider threads! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...
<br><br>
His threads had a sealing effect and could perfectly close off the bloodline power.
<br><br>
Zen had previously been caught off guard, and the ancestry-level bloodline could not help him, so he got trapped inside the Black Sun.
<br><br>
Hiss, hiss, hiss...
<br><br>
After Pearson's threads wrapped tightly around Zen, they continued to weave until they turned into Pearson's head. "What are you waiting for?"
<br><br>
Pearson angrily yelled at Sawyer and Thurston.
<br><br>
The three of them cooperated closely. When faced with a tough opponent, Pearson subdued their target with his threads, and then Sawyer and Thurston used the Black Sun to suck in the target.
<br><br>
Once the Black Sun had sucked in the target, Pearson's spider threads fell off the target's body to prevent Pearson from being sucked into it.
<br><br>
The three of them always worked together closely and tacitly, almost without any communication.
<br><br>
This time, however, Sawyer and Thurston just stood still.
<br><br>
Since Zen had already escaped from the Black Sun once, he could escape from it again.
<br><br>
However, all the Eternal Realm Hunters were people who lived on the verge of death. They couldn't possibly avoid trying just because it was hard for the Black Sun to kill Zen.
<br><br>
The real reason they stopped was because of King Ieuan's words during the previous conversation.
<br><br>
These humans were the current civilization in the chaos.
<br><br>
They were the hope of completing the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Based on the actions of the Knotting race in the past, they should be friends of Knotting race and be the ones who the Knotting race supported.
<br><br>
Moreover, the powers Zen had exhibited shocked them. Someone like him indeed deserved to be hunted by the Element Spirit Civilization which offered a generous bounty to whoever caught him.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he could also possibly complete the Finale Way. "Do something!" Pearson continued to shout.
<br><br>
"What's wrong with... your companions?"
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his hand and grabbed Pearson's head. With a gentle pinch, Pearson's head immediately turned into countless spider threads.
<br><br>
It was not easy to kill Pearson.
<br><br>
When Zen got trapped in the Black Sun, he did not hear conversation outside. Thus, he did not know the reason.
<br><br>
However, Pearson's two companions suddenly hesitated, which naturally gave him a chance.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen was about to attack the twins, King Ieuan suddenly said, "Zen, they are not enemies. I think you all have the same stand! Squeak!"
<br><br>
Zen looked at King Ieuan in confusion. "If you really plan to complete the Finale Way, I think we are indeed not enemies," said Sawyer.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen quickly understood Sawyer's words.
<br><br>
There were very few creatures on Other Shore who still insisted on the Finale Way, and most of the others paid allegiance to the Element Spirit Civilization or had died.
<br><br>
But these people were indeed allies.
<br><br>
Hiss, hiss, hiss...
<br><br>
The spider threads slipped down from Zen's body and quickly turned into Pearson's body.
<br><br>
"Are you idiots?!" Pearson said in exasperation.
<br><br>
From the beginning to the end, he didn't believe a single word from King Ieuan.
<br><br>
The two brothers from the Knotting race were too naive. They still couldn't forget about the Finale Way, and now they were fooled by a few words.
<br><br>
Then again, Pearson didn't have a powerful combat strength. If the two brothers did not want to cooperate, then he definitely could not fight Zen head-on.
<br><br>
What was worse was that there were several Eternal Realm warriors with Zen.
<br><br>
"Anyway, it's true that the Element Spirit Civilization tries to kill them,"
<br><br>
Sawyer confirmed.
<br><br>
If Pear Hill, which the Snake Goddess had mentioned, could deal with the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization, then Sawyer and Thurston were willing to side with them unconditionally! Suddenly, a barrage of loud footsteps came from not far away.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! A group of creatures, half human and half horse, charged towards them at an exceptionally fast speed. "It's the Sacred Horse race!" Fuxi exclaimed.
<br><br>
The Sacred Horse race might not be the best in the Grand Pure Realm, but they were the most challenging race to deal with.
<br><br>
They moved too fast that no one could catch up with them or escape from them. They fought their opponents to death.
<br><br>
Because the Eternal Realm Hunters had delayed Zen for such a long time, he and the others encountered the members of the Sacred Horse race.
<br><br>
"I hope you two won't get me into trouble!" Pearson snorted coldly.
<br><br>
As he spoke, he turned around and flicked his finger. Then, he transformed into extraordinarily thin spider threads that quietly spread out on the ground.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! The members of the Sacred Horse race continued to get closer. In a blink, they finally arrived.
<br><br>
The leader of the group was thirty feet tall and carried a spear full of thorns on his shoulder. He shouted excitedly, "How cooperative of you! Do you wait for us here?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3977 Heading North "Woo... Hoo... Hoo..."
<br><br>
A large group of members from the Sacred Horse race shouted from behind the leader, and their loud voices filled the air.
<br><br>
They liked to move fast when they got excited. People saw twisted shadows as they galloped. Their bodies traversed distances at speeds that the naked eye could not see.
<br><br>
This group from the Sacred Horse race moved in insane ways. They were like beams of light that dazzled everyone around them.
<br><br>
However, their excitement did not last long.
<br><br>
Pearson merely lifted his arm a little, but the spider threads had already formed a large net, which trapped all the members of the Sacred Horse race inside it.
<br><br>
After the spider web wrapped around the members of the Sacred Horse race, who originally moved insanely fast, their speed drastically dropped at once. They also discovered that their theurgies became entirely ineffective.
<br><br>
"It's your turn," Pearson said without looking back.
<br><br>
Although he did not agree with Sawyer and Thurston's ideas, the three of them, who were Eternal Realm Hunters, had wandered on the Three Purities Stage for so long that they were like brothers.
<br><br>
Since Sawyer and Thurston were so stubborn, Pearson had no choice but stand with them and fight.
<br><br>
Sawyer and Thurston held their hands together, and the Black Sun suddenly appeared between the two of them.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
The Black Sun spun rapidly and released an extraordinarily strong attraction force.
<br><br>
Even Zen could not resist the force, let alone these members of the Sacred Horse race.
<br><br>
"What is that?"
<br><br>
"I'm trapped in these spider threads!"
<br><br>
"Why can't I use my bloodline power?"
<br><br>
The members of the Sacred Horse race were in a mess. After all, how could they resist the terrifying power of the Black Sun? One by one, the Black Sun automatically sucked in the members of the Sacred Horse race. Some of the braver members of their race threw their spears before they got sucked in, but their efforts proved useless.
<br><br>
Within nine seconds, the Black Sun sucked in all of the members of the Sacred Horse race.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others quietly looked at each other.
<br><br>
Indeed, the Eternal Realm Hunters deserved their reputation. They were formidable and mighty warriors.
<br><br>
Afterwards, Sawyer and Thurston withdrew their hands, and the Black Sun disappeared. Then, its exit closed.
<br><br>
The Black Sun would consume the members of the Sacred Horse race inside it. Since their physical bodies were not that strong, it would not take long to eat them away.
<br><br>
Then, Sawyer cupped his hands towards Zen and said, "The Element Spirit Civilization has marked you. Many races in the Grand Pure Realm have come to capture you from all directions, so you'd better leave here as soon as possible."
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "Will you go with us?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Go with you?"
<br><br>
"Okay..."
<br><br>
Sawyer and Thurston didn't hesitate too much before they answered.
<br><br>
The real reason the two of them joined the Eternal Realm Hunters was that they were homeless and had nowhere to go.
<br><br>
Even though they had obtained great benefits after they became Eternal Realm Hunters, both of them still felt that the road ahead was long and meaningless.
<br><br>
The Finale Way was the most meaningful goal that every ruling civilization pursued. However, in the many chaotic eras that passed, the two of them never found someone worthy of their support.
<br><br>
Now, they both agreed that Zen was indeed the "special" one.
<br><br>
Since they chose to give up the Bone Fragments Secret Soul, they naturally wanted to see if this person was worthy of their trust. "Then come with us!"
<br><br>
Zen exclaimed.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! At that moment, Thurston and Sawyer jumped up and stood on the back of the Heavenly Eye Vine.
<br><br>
"Pearson..." Sawyer looked back.
<br><br>
If Pearson did not want to follow, then Sawyer wouldn't force him.
<br><br>
Everyone had their ambitions, and the Eternal Realm Hunters were always free to pursue them.
<br><br>
Then again, the three of them had gotten along well with each other for so many years, so of course, Pearson felt reluctant to leave them behind. With a bitter smile on his face, he jumped onto the Heavenly Eye Vine.
<br><br>
"The Heavenly Eye Vine is usually covered with Arrow Demons. It's not easy to deal with them. Why would it help you?" Sawyer asked.
<br><br>
In general, the Eternal Realm Hunters were quite familiar with everything about the Grand Pure Realm and the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Arrow Demons were also a non-human race that posed a high threat to the other races. Even the Eternal Realm Hunters had to avoid them when they encountered them before.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Eternal Realm Hunters found it strange when the Heavenly Eye Vine had now helped Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
"They are dead. He killed them all," King Ieuan said as it pointed at Zen.
<br><br>
Thurston and Sawyer slightly arched their eyebrows at King Ieuan's words.
<br><br>
The fact that Zen had forcefully escaped from the Black Sun already shocked both of them. Thus, they were even more surprised when they heard that Zen could deal with the Arrow Demons all alone.
<br><br>
Pearson pursed his lips. He was suspicious by nature. Unless he saw it with his own eyes, he never believed it.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
Soon enough, the Heavenly Eye Vine went into the ground and quickly moved as it carried the people on it.
<br><br>
When Claire, Les, and Slade saw what happened through the Shadow Warriors, they were also speechless.
<br><br>
When the Eternal Realm Hunters first appeared, Claire and her companions were a little excited.
<br><br>
Several years ago, Claire had personally tracked down the three remaining Eternal Realm Hunters, but she still failed to kill them.
<br><br>
These Eternal Realm Hunters were undoubtedly all-powerful. If they weren't careful enough, even mighty warriors like Claire and Les could find their lives in danger.
<br><br>
As soon as the Eternal Realm Hunters took action, Claire told Slade that if the Eternal Realm Hunters killed Zen and the others in his group, they would get the Bone Fragments Secret Soul as a reward.
<br><br>
Even if there was hostility between the Element Spirit Civilization and the Eternal Realm Hunters, the Element Spirit Civilization never broke its promise.
<br><br>
But not long after they made a move, the three Eternal Realm Hunters stood together with Zen and his companions, which was confusing.
<br><br>
"It seems that your method did not work," Claire said and glanced at Slade.
<br><br>
Though the Element Spirit Civilization had repressed the Finale Way for so many years, there were still many warriors at the Eternal Realm who yearned for the Finale Way on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If Zen rose to power, then the Eternal Realm warriors would probably all choose to follow him.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization did not want to see that.
<br><br>
"If these Eternal Realm Hunters wanted to follow them to death, then let them be," Slade said in a very calm voice.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Les just laughed and said nothing.
<br><br>
Along the way to the north, the Heavenly Eye Vine continuously traveled through the layer of soil.
<br><br>
After it crossed a distance of about three thousand miles, they arrived at a range of bumpy hills.
<br><br>
The hills were quite sturdy and could bear the pressure of over one hundred thousand divine megatons. Even the Heavenly Eye Vine found it hard to travel through them, so it just crawled along the hills' terrain.
<br><br>
"Quack, quack!"
<br><br>
Just then, they heard a strange scream from the sky.
<br><br>
It turned out that about eight peculiar birds lined up and spiraled downwards.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess released crimson shadows, which were like an octopus' tentacles as they lashed at the sky. Her shadows did not aim at anything, but they forced the strange birds to gather together. Then, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on the birds' bodies.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Then came an intense explosion in the air which struck the strange birds to death. However, there were no corpses, but only some bird feathers that slowly fluttered in the air.
<br><br>
Fuxi blew on his fist and said impassively, "How dare these strange birds attack us?"
<br><br>
As they headed north, he killed some non-human creatures who were surprisingly fast along the way. He showed quite formidable methods and skills and slaughtered those non-human creatures in no time.
<br><br>
Pearson quietly sized Fuxi up. These human warriors in the Eternal Realm didn't seem to be as weak as he thought. At least, Fuxi was qualified to join the Eternal Realm Hunters if it was in the past.
<br><br>
Chapter 3978 Golden Axe As they traveled north, the low hills continued to rise and eventually turned into lofty mountains.
<br><br>
Fortunately, these mountains were close to one another, making it easier for the Heavenly Eye Vine to leap from mountaintop to mountaintop.
<br><br>
After the Heavenly Eye Vine had crossed the biggest mountain, a path appeared that led northwest. This path extended to the horizon with no end at sight.
<br><br>
On one side of the path rested a deep valley: the Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
Legend had it that this valley was formed by gusts of wind over the years.
<br><br>
When Fuxi and the Snake Goddess saw the path, their expressions shifted.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and King Ieuan's faces darkened as well.
<br><br>
"The path seems to be covered by white mist?" Zen pointed out in confusion.
<br><br>
"This is not a white mist," Fuxi snapped back. "It's the members of the Mystical Void race."
<br><br>
"The Mystical Void race?" Zen raised an eyebrow in curiosity.
<br><br>
He was not surprised, especially because he sensed a vibrant energy of life as they approached the area.
<br><br>
At the time, it was an odd feeling, so he did not ask earlier.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded and continued to explain, "This long, winding road is the Silent Path. Members of the Mystical Void race are scattered along the Silent Path. As we go through this path, we cannot make a sound or we will infuriate the members of the Mystical Void race." She then lifted her hand to point at the mist. "It seems that someone already bothered them.
<br><br>
They took this form to block future travelers."
<br><br>
Zen walked towards the path's entrance and stretched out his hand to touch the mist, but his finger was blocked by an invisible space wall.
<br><br>
"Now that the Element Spirit Civilization is tracking you, they might have already figured out where you were headed. They must've irritated the members of the Mystical Void race to stop you beforehand," Pearson said as he walked up and pressed a hand against the space wall.
<br><br>
"All we have to do is eliminate the members of the Mystical Void race,"
<br><br>
responded Zen.
<br><br>
"You can try," said Fuxi, shrugging his shoulders.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, Zen sent a punch into the space wall.
<br><br>
His punch was anything but weak. With one strong hit of energy, the wall shattered and revealed a hole of sixty feet deep.
<br><br>
However, the hole was only empty for a second.
<br><br>
A strange whine echoed out and two white dots appeared behind the space wall above them. Such dots could reflect surrounding scenes and sounds. In any case, they were the eyes and mouths of the Mystical Void race.
<br><br>
Seeing that its body had been badly damaged, the creature cried and howled repeatedly. Meanwhile, the other parts of its body pressed against the hole Zen punched. In an instant, the hole was repaired completely.
<br><br>
The members of the Mystical Void race felt no pain, so their concept of injury was nonexistent. If a part of their body was destroyed, all they had to do was to fix it with other parts.
<br><br>
This meant that Zen's punch only reduced the size of this member of Mystical Void race.
<br><br>
Boom! Just then, Zen threw out an even stronger punch.
<br><br>
This time, he used his full strength. Even the three Eternal Realm Hunters who had seen a lot of the world were in awe at his tremendous power.
<br><br>
They had known Zen's physical body was powerful enough to kill Hawley, but they never expected his burst of strength would be so terrifying. If they ever came into contact with his punch, they would all be shattered.
<br><br>
Crack! Suddenly, a long, thin hole stretched over to a thousand feet long on the invisible space wall.
<br><br>
Awoo...
<br><br>
The member of the Mystical Void race whined once again as its body shrank a little more.
<br><br>
However, as the body shrank, a second member of their race swelled up to fill up the vacancy that developed.
<br><br>
As Zen saw this, his jaw dropped in surprise. His efforts were to no avail.
<br><br>
"Don't waste your time and energy on them. Once the members of the Mystical Void race swell up, you won't be able to pass through the Silent Path," Sawyer tried to convince Zen.
<br><br>
They would have to destroy everything above the Silent Path to eliminate the members of the Mystical Void race. God knew how long it would take to achieve that. "Is this the only route to the northwest?"
<br><br>
Zen asked.
<br><br>
"There is one other way..." the Snake Goddess stood up and said. "We can continue moving north through the Purple Wind Gorge!"
<br><br>
"The Purple Wind Gorge is an alternative path, yes. But once the strong gusts of wind arise, it will also be a hard route to endure," King Ieuan sighed.
<br><br>
"But we have no other choice now," Pearson shrugged.
<br><br>
For him, the humans lacked preparation for the journey and underestimated the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization developed in the Three Purities Stage for so long. Certainly, nobody else knew this place better than them.
<br><br>
From the movement of Zen and the group, it was not difficult for the Element Spirit Civilization to guess where they were headed.
<br><br>
If they wanted to avoid the hunt of the Element Spirit Civilization, they should have taken more dangerous, misleading routes.
<br><br>
In the past, when the Eternal Realm Hunters were chased by the Element Spirit Civilization, they were forced to enter the Evil Waters. This was how they shook the Element Spirit Civilization off their track.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization would stop their hunt when faced with lifethreatening areas. However, the Eternal Realm Hunters paid a considerable price — almost all of them were annihilated in the Evil Waters.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others all looked at Zen. Although Zen was youngest among them, he was obviously regarded as a decision maker in this group. After hesitating for a moment, Zen heard a voice within him.
<br><br>
He listened intently, and then his eyes flashed with determination. "Let's go through the Purple Wind Gorge."
<br><br>
Without hesitation, they climbed up the Heavenly Eye Vine again and slid down from the top of the mountain.
<br><br>
They continued moving north until they arrived at a plateau.
<br><br>
The plateau rose to a higher plane every hundred miles, making it appear like a massive stairway to heaven. The formation was called the Sky Ladder Plateau.
<br><br>
After they passed through the Stage End Passage, the Eternal Realm warriors of the Grand Plain Stage fell to the edges of the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
They wanted to land nearer to the Sky Ladder Plateau because it was a desolate area with close to no powerful races around the area.
<br><br>
There were a total of seven "steps" going up the Sky Ladder Plateau. At the end of the seventh step rested the famous Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
Once the Heavenly Eye Vine lifted them onto the Sky Ladder Plateau, Fuxi used the heavenly eye to scout their surroundings. All of a sudden, his face turned stone cold. "It seems to be even worse on this way."
<br><br>
"What's wrong? More warriors are gathered there?" asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Fuxi shook his head, "No. They're all gone. The creatures from other races have disappeared from my vision."
<br><br>
As they heard this, the Snake Goddess, Yasamin, and the others exchanged looks of confusion. Sawyer asked from the side, "You mean you can't see them through the heavenly eye?"
<br><br>
It was not rare that warriors moved in concealment.
<br><br>
However, the heavenly eye easily saw through most disguises and concealment methods. Now that they failed to see their enemies' movements, this only meant that their concealment methods were far from ordinary.
<br><br>
Fuxi shook his head and gave the vine extended from the heavenly eye to Sawyer. Sawyer took it and looked around through the eye, but saw nothing as well.
<br><br>
Just as Sawyer opened his mouth to speak, they all sensed a formidable power of space from above them. All of a sudden, the clouds parted and a huge golden axe appeared from behind. It slashed down at them before anyone could even react.
<br><br>
The axe was several hundred feet in size.
<br><br>
Its edge was engraved with strange Sanskrit words across it, and it radiated circles of golden light that emitted an extremely strong aura.
<br><br>
Crack! In a split second, the golden axe fell from the sky and chopped down towards the ground, slicing the thick Heavenly Eye Vine in half.
<br><br>
Chapter 3979 Golden Flames The Heavenly Eye Vine's only weakness was the heavenly eye.
<br><br>
As a plant, any part cut off from its body could still grow and regenerate independently.
<br><br>
Back when the Arrow Demons fought with the Lightning Ghosts, the latter utilized their ability to travel through space from thousands of miles away to catch their enemies off guard.
<br><br>
In a flash, they were able to cut the Heavenly Eye Vine into dozens of pieces.
<br><br>
Over time, these Heavenly Eye Vine cuttings took root independently and grew all over the place which became even more enemies of the Lightning Ghosts.
<br><br>
However, this golden axe that appeared out of the blue was no ordinary weapon.
<br><br>
When this golden axe was wielded, it cut through the vine and left behind a small circle of golden light. Upon closer inspection, this circle of light was actually golden flames that quickly spread along the length of the vine.
<br><br>
If nothing was done to stop them, the golden flames would quickly swallow up the whole plant and reduce it into nothing but ash.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A sharp golden ray of sword radiance slashed through the vine as Eastern Emperor Taiyi brandished his blade and cut off the part that already caught fire.
<br><br>
From a once mighty vine, the sliced part fell to the ground and burned bright until there was nothing but ash and smoke.
<br><br>
Yasamin sported an extremely serious look on her face. "Who in the world summoned the golden axe to attack us?"
<br><br>
Fuxi scouted through the heavenly eye and also spread out his spiritual sense in an effort to find the target. "I don't know. The power of space is so weird."
<br><br>
After the huge axe appeared, it quickly shot up into the air and disappeared right before their very eyes. Not even Fuxi's efforts were enough to find its location.
<br><br>
"I recognized that golden axe. It's the bull-headed monsters' weapon,"
<br><br>
Thurston told them.
<br><br>
Bull-headed monsters were one of the most dangerous races in the Grand Pure Realm as they had excellent combat ability. Fortunately, their weakness lay in their lackluster agility so one would generally be safe if they kept their distance.
<br><br>
"Those creatures aren't idiots. If you're their common target then they would team-up and stop at nothing to subdue you. That's an incredibly serious matter that we need to consider," Pearson grumbled.
<br><br>
It wasn't that difficult to fight against a single race. Each had their own strengths but also their own weaknesses.
<br><br>
If one knew what these weaknesses were and how to exploit them, then it would be an easy fight.
<br><br>
Known as the strongest melee fighters, the bull-headed monsters were a considerably powerful force and those targeted by them would undoubtedly face a miserable end.
<br><br>
In the past, the Eternal Realm Hunters dealt with them easily through the advantage of agility.
<br><br>
However, the situation now was different. They were not just dealing with the bull-headed monsters but all the other races. With everyone's strengths and weaknesses balanced, the opposition became a formidable force to be reckoned. Even the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization would flinch at the face of such an outstanding coalition, what more Zen's puny group? Buzz...
<br><br>
A space fluctuation appeared above them, accompanied by a flash of golden light. For a split second, everything was silent until a huge, golden axe suddenly emerged and hacked down towards them! Fortunately, the Heavenly Eye Vine was prepared and twisted its body to the side to avoid the attack. The golden axe hit the ground instead of the vine and left behind a shining, golden crack.
<br><br>
Flames blazed within the crack but seemed to be unable to burn the ground.
<br><br>
A few minutes later, the golden fire was automatically extinguished.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter where they are. We should climb up to the top of the Sky Ladder Plateau first," Zen suggested.
<br><br>
With Zen's command, the Heavenly Eye Vine twisted its body and quickly fled the place.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Of course, there was no way their escape was going to be so easy. As the Heavenly Eye Vine fled, another space fluctuation appeared above them as two golden axes dropped down at the same time.
<br><br>
The axes boxed in the Heavenly Eye Vine from both sides and left no space for it to dodge.
<br><br>
"To the left!" Zen roared.
<br><br>
Quick reflexes were what they needed at that moment.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine followed Zen's command and twisted its body to the left.
<br><br>
With the golden axe on the left about to slash down on their heads, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan all scattered but, to their horror, Zen remained to charge at it head-on! Thurston's eyes widened in shock when he witnessed what Zen was about to do. "Is he crazy?! What in the world is he doing?!"
<br><br>
Sawyer shared his sentiments and shouted after Zen desperately. "Get out of the way! What the hell are you doing?!"
<br><br>
These axes were no ordinary weapons and the flames they emitted were called Life Devouring Flames that could burn any living creatures to ashes in mere seconds! Crack! Zen took a wide stance and raised his hands in an effort to resist the oncoming golden axe! Sharp as it was, it wasn't enough to cut through Zen's body.
<br><br>
"What a strong body!"
<br><br>
"After all, his physical body is even stronger than Hawley's!"
<br><br>
"But the Life Devouring Flames! No matter how strong his body is, the flames will still devour him..."
<br><br>
There was nothing the Eternal Realm Hunters could really do but stare nervously at Zen and wait for his fate to consume him.
<br><br>
Sure enough, the small golden flames quickly spread from the sharp edge of the axe and onto Zen's arm as it burned his flesh with a sizzling sound.
<br><br>
Zen's virtually indestructible body quickly crumpled and charred under the onslaught of the flames but still, he remained standing.
<br><br>
"Do you want to burn me to nothing but ashes?" he muttered. The flames continued to lick at his skin but Zen continued to carry the axe with both hands.
<br><br>
Once caught in the flames, the fire would only continue to spread along the victim's body faster and faster.
<br><br>
If this went on, Zen would definitely be burned to nothing, including the ancestry-level bloodline inside his body.
<br><br>
Up until now, the only way Zen was able to use this formidable ancestrylevel bloodline he obtained was by putting himself in danger. If he helped his friends but did not put his own safety in question, then the bloodline would never activate.
<br><br>
In a real predicament like this one, he was sure that the ancestry-level bloodline would rise up and protect itself! Buzz! Sure enough, Zen's shoulder suddenly swelled and formed a big sac that exploded and turned into a monstrous, gaping mouth with sharp teeth! "Okay, here it goes," Zen murmured to himself.
<br><br>
He could only sigh at the sight of the ugly mouth on his shoulder.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was truly powerful and Zen had yet to see any limits or weaknesses to it.
<br><br>
However, every time it showed off its power, it seemed to always attach a gruesome and somewhat terrifying addition to his body.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Everyone watched as this monstrous mouth that suddenly grew on his shoulder sucked and devoured the Life Devouring Flames, including those that burned on the axe blade.
<br><br>
Once all of the flames had been eaten, the golden axe became nothing more than an ordinary chunk of sharp metal.
<br><br>
All Zen needed to do was exert a bit of strength before he was able to snap the huge axe in half! Everyone who witnessed this scene almost had their eyes pop right out of their sockets in surprise.
<br><br>
'What is with that weird mouth that suddenly grew on his shoulder? How was that mouth able to devour the flames so easily?' they all couldn't help but wonder to themselves.
<br><br>
Among the three Eternal Realm Hunters, Pearson was the most knowledgeable and also most scheming.
<br><br>
When he saw what had happened, he surmised that Zen's body was able to adjust itself to all sorts of predicaments.
<br><br>
So did that mean that he had also sorts of method that could correspond to defeating other theurgies? If that was the case then wouldn't that make him entirely omnipotent? It was merely a conjecture since Pearson had no way to prove it. Who knows? Maybe it was mere coincidence that Zen's body had the ability to restrain the Life Devouring Flames.
<br><br>
However, he remembered the fact that Zen was also able to escape from the Black Sun with a strange physical form. Was that also a coincidence then? There seemed to be too many coincidences in this world.
<br><br>
Pearson thought it through but couldn't come up with a sound hypothesis as of the moment. 'Maybe Sawyer and Thurston made the right choice to follow him?' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, more power of space surged across the sky as multiple giant axes began to rain down upon them in succession! Chapter 3980 A Trick The Heavenly Eye Vine was a monster that had lived for countless years.
<br><br>
It could feel the space fluctuation in the sky, and how strong the fluctuation was really struck it dumb.
<br><br>
It would eventually die if it kept fleeing this way, so it could only place its hope on Zen now. After all, it was a fact that Zen managed to crush a huge golden axe with his bare hands—his strength was indisputable.
<br><br>
Thus, while it dodged, it also used Zen as a shield to face those golden axes.
<br><br>
In fact, considering the fact that Zen was still standing on it, Zen wouldn't just stay still and watch on with folded arms. Even if the Heavenly Eye Vine didn't do this, Zen would still take the initiative to fight off those golden axes.
<br><br>
Every time a huge golden axe swung down on them, the big mouth on Zen's shoulder would immediately open and suck down the Life Devouring Flames. The originally golden axe would immediately lose its luster and turn into an ordinary iron axe.
<br><br>
Although the ordinary iron axe would still retain its slashing momentum, Zen could rip it into halves with just a little twisting movement, and it would end up being thrown aside casually by Zen.
<br><br>
Bang! Crack! Crack! Crack! Boom! Some of the axes were torn apart by Zen with bare hands, some cracked, while some others were riddled with holes.
<br><br>
All in all, the fate of those golden axes, which had appeared out of nowhere, never strayed far from being destroyed into pieces by Zen.
<br><br>
Something unexpected also occurred during the fight—someone used the space theurgy and retrieved the broken giant axes. However, they soon realized that the destroyed giant axes were useless and stopped. Since no one took care of those broken axes, wherever the Heavenly Eye Vine passed, there would always be piles of iron scraps lying on the ground.
<br><br>
When Zen first attacked, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others were quite worried, but upon seeing Zen becoming more and more proficient in dealing with the golden axes, their tight nerves gradually loosened.
<br><br>
Right in front of them, at the end of the first stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, there were over a hundred creatures with transparent wings hovering in the air. These creatures were only about half the height of an adult human. They had small builds, but their heads were big. The combinations of these made them look funny.
<br><br>
Each one of them was covered in a layer of space membrane. It was precisely these layers of space membrane that changed the surrounding light rays and allowed them and the bull-headed men to hide well.
<br><br>
Even if one's spiritual sense swept over this area, their presence wouldn't be detected.
<br><br>
These short creatures were the Space Manipulating Spirits in the Grand Pure Realm, and just like their name indicated, they were highly talented in manipulating space.
<br><br>
After the Space Manipulating Spirits met the bull-headed men halfway, rather than engaging in a dead or alive battle like they usually did, both races unprecedentedly chose to join hands.
<br><br>
Both races were determined to get the Bone Fragments Secret Soul, so after discussing with each other, the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bullheaded men lurked at the end of the first stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, ready to ambush Zen and his group.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men were very powerful, and the help of the Space Manipulating Spirits made up for their shortcomings—it was like adding brilliance to their present splendor.
<br><br>
In addition, they were in the dark, while Zen and his group were in the light. They should've been able to catch Zen and his group off guard and bring them down easily.
<br><br>
But the truth was poles apart from their imagination.
<br><br>
The Space Manipulating Spirits used the bull-headed men's axes to attack Zen, but Zen dealt with them easily and even smashed them into piles of scrap metal.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men's axes were forged elaborately. They would get a Golden Spirit Axe only after they became real soldiers. In general, they could only have one such axe in their lives.
<br><br>
Only those who'd made a great contribution would be awarded with a second Golden Spirit Axe.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men who came here were the most powerful elites of their race. Many of them had two Golden Spirit Axes, and some even had three.
<br><br>
In the beginning, the bull-headed men were quite willing to use their Golden Spirit Axes to attack Zen. However, when they saw Zen effortlessly tear their Golden Spirit Axes apart, they felt heartbroken. Those with only two Golden Spirit Axes refused to attack again and even began to quarrel with the Space Manipulating Spirits.
<br><br>
"What the hell are you thinking?!"
<br><br>
"That guy's not afraid of our axes!"
<br><br>
The Space Manipulating Spirits didn't show any weakness and retorted.
<br><br>
"We've overestimated you! Losers!"
<br><br>
"Don't you claim to have the strongest combat power among those in the Grand Pure Realm?"
<br><br>
"You're all elites, but you can't even defeat that one guy!"
<br><br>
When the two races were in a fierce dispute, a blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit said, "Everyone, shut up!"
<br><br>
A bull-headed man with golden horns also roared, "Stop arguing! It's meaningless!"
<br><br>
The two were leaders of their teams. After they stepped up, the two sides finally quieted down.
<br><br>
The bull-headed man with golden horns said, "They don't know where we're yet, but they're heading towards us—we can kill them later!"
<br><br>
"Right," the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit echoed in agreement.
<br><br>
There was a vicious glint in her eyes. "I'll trap that human in a space maze.
<br><br>
Without him, we can kill the others easily."
<br><br>
Zen had the ability to devour the Life Devouring Flames—it was something that neither the bull-headed men nor the Space Manipulating Spirits ever imagined.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, from their point of view, it was Zen's physical body that was strong. Since it was a physical body, it wouldn't be difficult for them to deal with it.
<br><br>
The two races kept hiding at the end of the first stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, waiting for the arrival of Zen and his group.
<br><br>
One thousand miles...
<br><br>
Three hundred miles...
<br><br>
One hundred miles...
<br><br>
When Zen and the others finally entered their line of sight, the distance between them was only about forty miles.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The Space Manipulating Spirits flapped their wings, and a strong spatial power spread around with them as the center.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men were also ready to fight. They held their Golden Spirit Axes tightly, and their breaths were heavy.
<br><br>
Twenty miles...
<br><br>
Ten miles...
<br><br>
Five miles...
<br><br>
Zen and his group were practically within reach now.
<br><br>
"Fight!"
<br><br>
the bull-headed man with golden horns bellowed.
<br><br>
In an instant, the Space Manipulating Spirits withdrew the space camouflage. They flapped their transparent wings, and triangle space fragments shot towards the Heavenly Eye Vine like raindrops.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men's Golden Spirit Axes shone brightly as they rushed forward.
<br><br>
"Endless Corridor!"
<br><br>
With a gentle wave of her hand, the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit created a winding space corridor in front of her.
<br><br>
Buzz! The space fluctuated, and a second later, the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit already appeared above the Heavenly Eye Vine. She suddenly clapped her hands, and the space corridor immediately enveloped Zen. In the blink of an eye, Zen fell into the space corridor and vanished from everyone's sight.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! Unable to dodge the triangular fragments released by the Space Manipulating Spirits, the Heavenly Eye Vine's huge body was instantly riddled with wounds and soon torn into pieces.
<br><br>
The three Eternal Realm Hunters, as well as Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, King Ieuan, and Yasamin couldn't withstand the bull-headed men's huge axes. In a matter of seconds, all of them were killed. Blood gushed out of their wounds and flooded the area.
<br><br>
Everything went on smoothly just like the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men had planned.
<br><br>
"Is it so simple?" The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit took a doubtful look at the corpses lying on the ground and then at Zen who was still trapped in the Endless Corridor.
<br><br>
There was a powerful, constantly twisting spatial force within the Endless Corridor, but it shouldn't have had much effect on Zen.
<br><br>
However, the purpose of this Endless Corridor was just to trap Zen.
<br><br>
The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit's eyes widened suddenly. She saw that Zen's body had already been badly twisted by space in the Endless Corridor.
<br><br>
But his physical body was so powerful that he could even slay Hawley— how could it be twisted by mere spatial power? "It's a trick!"
<br><br>
the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit shouted as a realization hit her.
<br><br>
Chapter 3981 The Skills Of The Hunters The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits were already consumed with suspicions about the entire situation.
<br><br>
After all, the Element Spirit Civilization was prepared to reward them handsomely if they were to capture Zen and his companions. The weakest of them were still at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Even if they attacked Zen and his group without a warning, they were capable enough to defend themselves. But surprisingly, they were quickly killed without putting up a decent fight.
<br><br>
"What just happened?" The bull-headed man with golden horns asked, with his eyes overflowing with confusion.
<br><br>
The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit shook the Endless Corridor in her palm slightly. At this action, a corpse in a twisted condition was thrown out of it. With her ocean-like eyes reflecting her determination, she spread her transparent wings evenly and prepared to take flight. Her body ascended to the air with the blue light in her eyes shining in contrast to her hair.
<br><br>
As she flapped her wings, the immense power generating in the space around her spread around like an invisible tidal wave.
<br><br>
The speed at which the power of space spread was not fast, but it had enough momentum to cover a significantly large area.
<br><br>
Moreover, nothing within its scope could deceive it or remain hidden. It was much better than the spiritual sense when used for detecting.
<br><br>
The time ticked away, one second followed by the other without any progress.
<br><br>
As a result, the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit felt her nerves tense up in confusion. They were supposed to find the Heavenly Eye Vine on the first stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, but it was nowhere to be seen. How could this be? "Stop looking for it. It has gone to the second stair," the golden horned bullheaded man said suddenly after noticing the intensity of her predicament.
<br><br>
"How can you be so sure?" the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit questioned him. But as soon as she turned around to face him, she was left speechless.
<br><br>
Her eyes instinctively fell on the ice piece in the hands of the golden horned bull-headed man. The ice piece was given by the Element Spirit Civilization. As of now, Zen and his companions were being closely pursued by the Shadow Warriors. They could easily track Zen and his group to know their whereabouts using the ice piece.
<br><br>
The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit averted her eyes and lowered them to the ground to avoid contact as she felt flustered. She put too much faith in her talent for manipulating space. Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine Zen and his group would play a trick on her right under her nose.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! After experiencing a setback, she kept spiraling up until she reached a height of more than ten thousand feet.
<br><br>
Each stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau was over ten thousand feet high. At her height, she was able to see the second stair.
<br><br>
Buzz! With a flash of intense blue light sparkling in her eyes, she said in a low voice resembling a whisper, "It runs very fast."
<br><br>
As if responding to her gesture, a long, yet thin space corridor shot forward at an untraceable speed. She grabbed the end of the space corridor securely in her hand and dragged it down with force, forging a right-angled space corridor.
<br><br>
This space corridor held the potential to teleport everyone. The killing intent in her eyes raged like flames that refused to be put out. A hefty price would have to be paid for fooling her.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on the second stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, the Heavenly Eye Vine was twisting, and turning its flexible body like that of a snake. Its movements were astonishingly agile on the plateau.
<br><br>
Sawyer was holding a small object in his hands. It was the Heavenly Eye Vine, but it was dozens of times smaller than its original size. The sizes of Zen, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others were also reduced in proportion.
<br><br>
"How pathetic!" Fuxi's eyes twitched as he stared at his substitute.
<br><br>
Although he knew it was a fake, he couldn't help but feel a tinge of sadness while watching its body being torn up limb from limb.
<br><br>
"Wow, you really live up to your reputation as Eternal Realm Hunters. Your skills are so ingenious and amazing," King Ieuan praised in an awestruck tone.
<br><br>
"I'm flattered. We've been staying in the Grand Pure Realm for a long time, so we're quite familiar with this place," Sawyer said with a confident smile.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunters did not join any force and had been wandering around in the Grand Pure Realm. The Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization were in constant search for them. In addition to that, they had to deal with a large number of creatures from other races trying to locate their whereabouts to capture them.
<br><br>
To be able to survive under such hostile circumstances, they had to toughen themselves up naturally.
<br><br>
Just now when they were attacked, Sawyer made quick speculation about the attackers being the bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits.
<br><br>
The basis of his judgment was the fact that only the Space Manipulating Spirits harnessed the expertise required to be able to throw those axes over with such accuracy.
<br><br>
Moreover, Sawyer accurately pinpointed the position of bull-headed men and Space Manipulating Spirits. He also had a clear idea of their plans to ambush them ahead.
<br><br>
Thinking quick on his feet to avoid the awaiting calamity, he used a treasure that was discovered in the Supreme Pure Realm. It was a type of white soil that could morph into anything and imitate things perfectly. It was still debatable whether it was alive or not. Nevertheless, it could duplicate everything perfectly.
<br><br>
The white mud was quite a popular Other Shore Token in the Supreme Pure Realm. The Eternal Realm warriors that carried it could transform into any form at will.
<br><br>
Just as Sawyer used the white mud, Thurston took out another treasure. It was a round mirror that was barely visible to the naked eye and harnessed a remarkably powerful hiding effect.
<br><br>
After the white mud transformed into their shapes, Thurston covered them with the round mirror. Their perfect cooperation formed substitutes that were impossible to tell apart from the original.
<br><br>
Their commendable skills earned them the respect of Fuxi and the Snake Goddess along with the others.
<br><br>
Putting their survival experience into practice, they were able to evade two fatal attempts of assassination aimed towards them. One was when they were chased by an Other Shore race in the Grand Pure Realm, and the other was when they were hunted down by the Nihility race. Each time they emerged victorious when it came to fooling the enemy and derailing their plans to capture them.
<br><br>
But this time, there was an enormous loophole left unnoticed in their skills.
<br><br>
The Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men were at a safe distance from them, which was why they were unable to notice their presence, but the two Shadow Warriors floating in the air still kept a close watch on the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
When Zen pointed out the loophole, Sawyer diffused his concerns with a slight wave of his hand. They could only hope that the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men would not use the ice piece of the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Fortunately for them, Sawyer's judgment was right on the money.
<br><br>
"If they find out these are fakes, they will try their best to catch up. We're not out of the woods yet," the Snake Goddess said with a grim expression on her face.
<br><br>
Even if they had fooled their enemies once, they still hadn't escaped all potential threats that awaited them.
<br><br>
The Space Manipulating Spirits were highly talented in manipulating space.
<br><br>
It was only a matter of time before they caught up with Zen and his group for a full-blown confrontation.
<br><br>
"The Space Manipulating Spirits are persistent when it comes to their cause.
<br><br>
They will surely come after us and build a space channel." As Pearson spoke, he took out a handful of brown ash from his Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, a blue thin line made itself visible as it extended from the sky in the distance. The speed at which it approached them was so fast that it was hard to keep track of it with the naked eye.
<br><br>
It was none other than the Endless Corridor released by the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit.
<br><br>
Without wasting a moment, Pearson blew on the ash that rested on his palm.
<br><br>
The ash then spread backwards.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Even though it was small in size, it still covered a massive area. The nature of the space in this area had shifted from its previous form. The large space seemed to have solidified, then it turned into thousands of fragments and collapsed.
<br><br>
The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit had initially planned to drive the Endless Corridor right in front of Zen and the others to stop them in their tracks and later to teleport the bull-headed men and the other Space Manipulating Spirits there.
<br><br>
The Endless Corridor was slightly different from the space channel. The space channel only closed the distance between two places, but the Endless Corridor had no limitations when it came to distance. It was lengthened or shortened at will by the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit. Therefore, regardless of the distance, they could cross it with something so simple as a single step.
<br><br>
At this moment, the Endless Corridor drilled into the space created by the ash.
<br><br>
If an ordinary space channel touched the ash, only the first part would solidify and then shatter.
<br><br>
However, the moment the Endless Corridor touched the ash, it solidified as a whole. With a loud splash, all of it was shattered as though it were nothing.
<br><br>
Chapter 3982 The Earthly Dragon Snakes The blue-haired spirit controlled the Endless Corridor, putting the bullheaded men and the other Space Manipulating Spirits into it.
<br><br>
However, as soon as they stepped in, the Endless Corridor collapsed with a loud bang, and they all fell off! Each step in the Endless Corridor was equal to a great distance. Thus, upon entry alone, some of the bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits had already reached the second stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, and others were now falling from over ten thousand feet high to the first stair of the plateau.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits now lay scattered all over the ground, though the height wasn't enough to cause these warriors to be injured.
<br><br>
The blue-haired spirit's face fell at this development.
<br><br>
"What happened? Can't you keep it stable?" the bull-headed man with golden horns demanded.
<br><br>
"It's the Bone-coagulating Powder!" the blue-haired spirit responded dismally.
<br><br>
The Bone-coagulating Powder rendered most space theurgies useless, and the Endless Corridor, apparently, was no exception.
<br><br>
"These people are trickier than we expected," the bull-headed man with golden horns muttered, frowning.
<br><br>
They fell right into their opponents' trap.
<br><br>
"It's just a minor setback. We're still more powerful! They can't escape death forever!" A blue light flashed in the blue-haired spirit's eyes. The killing intent was so strong it spread out along the space force, sending a chill down the Space Manipulating Spirits' and the bull-headed men's hearts.
<br><br>
Each stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau had the same height, but the width differed.
<br><br>
The width of each stair was a third shorter than that of the stair directly below it.
<br><br>
Of course, the Heavenly Eye Vine knew how powerful the bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits were.
<br><br>
They were the two most fearsome races in the Grand Pure Realm. If they ever caught up to them, they would undoubtedly be killed.
<br><br>
The vine made use of almost all its skills as it made its way through the Sky Ladder Plateau. It wasn't long before it passed through the second and third stairs of the plateau.
<br><br>
As it moved up, each stair of the plateau became narrower and narrower, and the time it took to cross it became shorter and shorter.
<br><br>
After the bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits finally converged on the fourth stair, the blue-haired spirit once again activated the Endless Corridor.
<br><br>
Learning from the last attempt, the blue-haired spirit did not extend the Endless Corridor straight to Zen's group this time, but extended to another side, a little past them.
<br><br>
On the Heavenly Eye Vine, Fuxi spotted the thin thread in the distance.
<br><br>
"That space thread is chasing us again. It's already on the other side of the plateau," Fuxi warned.
<br><br>
Sawyer squinted at the distance. The Endless Corridor was just an azure thin thread. It couldn't be seen with the naked eye from afar. He shook his head. "It's too far. It's impossible to destroy the passage from this distance."
<br><br>
"All we can do is to make sure they don't catch up," the Snake Goddess said firmly.
<br><br>
Hearing this, the Heavenly Eye Vine sped up again. The three Eternal Realm Hunters were stunned into silence. Sawyer and Thurston knew that the Arrow Demons relied on this vine to move around, but they didn't expect it to be this fast.
<br><br>
But just as they were about to reach the fifth stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, a swarm of flying creatures came into view.
<br><br>
Dread gripped the group as they realized it was a large number of winged snakes.
<br><br>
They were called the Earthly Dragon Snakes. Though they were barely the size of a human baby's arm, each one was lethally venomous, and they always attacked in swarms.
<br><br>
"Do you three know any way to deal with the Earthly Dragon Snakes?"
<br><br>
King Ieuan asked urgently.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunters had so much experience, so the other Eternal Realm warriors naturally relied on them to know better.
<br><br>
"The Earthly Dragon Snakes are afraid of the smell of sulfur stone. Having one on hand could protect us," Pearson suggested.
<br><br>
"But we don't have any right now," Thurston said, throwing up his hands in frustration. "Do you?"
<br><br>
The Earthly Dragon Snakes were located in the west of the Grand Pure Realm. When they needed to break into the Earthly Dragon Snakes' territory, the Eternal Realm Hunters would dig for the sulfur stones, but they usually didn't prepare any. Besides, they had just come down from the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin and the others also shook their heads.
<br><br>
They had never even heard of the sulfur stones, so how could they have such a thing? The faces of the three Eternal Realm Hunters darkened. Without sulfur stones, they probably wouldn't be able to escape this obstacle.
<br><br>
As the swarm of Earthly Dragon Snakes got closer and closer, their venomous maws became more visible. The desperation loomed heavier on the group.
<br><br>
"You can use the Black Sun to absorb them," the Snake Goddess piped up.
<br><br>
Thurston shook his head. "No, we can't."
<br><br>
He didn't bother to explain why they couldn't.
<br><br>
After all, they had just joined this team. He still didn't completely trust Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
However, Zen understood. He knew the space in the Black Sun wasn't that expansive. What was more, the creatures that were absorbed into the Black Sun were not instantly killed, but were just slowly exhausted until they dissipated.
<br><br>
The real strength of the Black Sun was that it was difficult to break free from it.
<br><br>
As long as the two brothers were separated, the Black Sun would not have an exit. No matter how powerful the creature was, it would be fatigued and die sooner or later.
<br><br>
But just recently, the two brothers had already sucked so many members of the Sacred Horse race into it. They didn't know if the Black Sun had already wiped them out. Even if they were already dead, there was no certainty the Black Sun had enough space to hold so many Earthly Dragon Snakes.
<br><br>
"I've heard the Earthly Dragon Snakes have very weak defensive power. We could just kill them, then," Fuxi said, stepping forward.
<br><br>
"Kill so many Earthly Dragon Snakes one by one?" Pearson gave Fuxi a doubtful look.
<br><br>
"Even if we can do it, it will take too much time. We can't afford it," Sawyer pointed out.
<br><br>
Right now, all the races in the Grand Pure Realm were gathering towards them. Given the difficulty of killing the Earthly Dragon Snakes, taking them on would just give those races time to close in on them.
<br><br>
"It won't take us long!" Fuxi said, smiling. The Sumeru Space in his hand flashed with an azure light. A large amount of brown powder poured out from it.
<br><br>
When Pearson saw the powder, he raised his eyebrows. "What kind of powder is this?"
<br><br>
Even though the Eternal Realm Hunters were experienced and knowledgeable, they didn't know how to use the Imprisoning Lightning, so they naturally didn't recognize this kind of item.
<br><br>
"The Solid Lightning Powder." Fuxi chuckled.
<br><br>
He slightly shook his palm, and an invisible force arranged the powder and turned it into the shape of a palm, as tall as a person.
<br><br>
In the Heavenly Thunder Plain, Zen had collected a massive amount of Solid Lightning Powder, just in case.
<br><br>
Fuxi had just taken out half of it.
<br><br>
"What does the Solid Lightning Powder do?" Sawyer asked curiously.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked up at the sky. A mark of Eight Diagrams appeared in the void, which was also the central area where most of the Earthly Dragon Snakes gathered. "Have you heard of the Heavenly Thunder Plain?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Of course," Sawyer replied, nodding.
<br><br>
"It is the thunderbolts from there!"
<br><br>
With that, Fuxi launched a palm strike upwards.
<br><br>
In a flash, the palm formed by the Solid Lightning Powder suddenly disappeared and reappeared on the Eight Diagrams, striking at it.
<br><br>
Pop! On impact, the Eight Diagrams broke in a flash of dazzling lightning.
<br><br>
Chapter 3983 Desperate The Solid Lightning Powder was undoubtedly powerful. The Primeval Lord of Heaven had used it to kill the Divine Retribution Beast that had once hunted the human race.
<br><br>
The terrifying lightning exploded, radiating in all directions like a supernova.
<br><br>
Buzz! The explosion was so loud that it started sounding like a piercing shriek, leaving everyone's ears ringing.
<br><br>
For a moment, no one could see clearly. They could only see a white light.
<br><br>
Everything was shrouded in the white light, including the earth and sky.
<br><br>
After a long time, the white light dissipated, making everything visible again.
<br><br>
The Earthly Dragon Snakes were gone. A large part of them were killed by the lightning released by the Solid Lightning Powder. The others fell to the ground: some killed by the shock waves, some just stunned unconscious.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, the Heavenly Eye Vine now rushed forward.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits had already arrived a little way ahead of Zen's group. They had been about to attack when they were spooked still by the lightning in the sky.
<br><br>
"What kind of skill was that?"
<br><br>
"What horrible lightning!"
<br><br>
"The color and power looked familiar. Did they bring the lightning from the Heavenly Thunder Plain?"
<br><br>
Because of the lightning, the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bullheaded men had hesitated to approach Zen's group. The Heavenly Eye Vine wasted no time taking advantage of the lull and climbed up to the fifth stair.
<br><br>
"Should we stop them?" the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit asked.
<br><br>
"What if they use that lightning skill again?" the bull-headed man with golden horns said with a frown.
<br><br>
The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit thought for a moment. "Let's just follow them for now. Let's wait and see if other races will attack them."
<br><br>
Most of the races in the Grand Pure Realm were chasing Zen's group. If the races that didn't know their true strength exhausted them, the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men would be able to catch them easily. This was a much safer plan.
<br><br>
"Good idea," the bull-headed man with golden horns agreed.
<br><br>
The two races thus decided not to stop Zen and the others themselves.
<br><br>
Instead, they maintained a certain distance from them and followed them all the way.
<br><br>
The width of the fifth stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau was less than a tenth of that of the first stair, and the sixth stair was even narrower. The seventh stair was a platform of hundreds of thousands of feet wide. The Heavenly Eye Vine quickly passed through the fifth stair and went straight to the sixth.
<br><br>
On the other side of the Sky Ladder Plateau, a large number of creatures from other races began to pour in. More and more races joined the chase.
<br><br>
They didn't cooperate with each other as the Eternal Realm Hunters thought. Time was short and they hated each other very much. Although everyone's goal was to catch Zen and his group, they were also still wary against each other.
<br><br>
Even two races that were approaching together maintained a considerable distance from each other.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! The temperature at the top of the Sky Ladder Plateau started to drop. Thick snow had piled up on the plain, covering everything in a blanket of white.
<br><br>
After passing the sixth stair, the Heavenly Eye Vine climbed up rapidly along the mountain sides of the seventh.
<br><br>
The three Eternal Realm Hunters, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others now looked a little nervous.
<br><br>
If the wind blew from the Purple Wind Gorge, the Sky Ladder Plateau would be a dead end. There would be no possibility of escape.
<br><br>
After the Heavenly Eye Vine reached the seventh stair, Thurston, Sawyer, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess held their breath and looked worriedly ahead.
<br><br>
There was a huge and open valley in the distance.
<br><br>
In the valley, they could see a faint purple wind floating up and down like silk.
<br><br>
"The wind is rising," Fuxi murmured.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess frowned. This was a difficult problem she could find no solution for.
<br><br>
A feeling of doom hung over Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin and the Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
They couldn't cross the Purple Wind Gorge if the wind raged at them.
<br><br>
All the creatures in the air would be sucked into the deep gorge, and there was no possibility of survival.
<br><br>
The wind in the Purple Wind Gorge was famously insurmountable.
<br><br>
"Can't we fly above it?" Zen asked, staring at the purple wind.
<br><br>
Pearson scoffed at that. He couldn't imagine how Zen became so powerful while knowing so little about the Three Purities Stage. "If you fly over the Purple Wind Gorge, the purple wind will blow up. As long as the wind blows, this is a dead end. You shouldn't have chosen this path in the first place."
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others frowned. Their faces darkened as they realized they had made a mistake.
<br><br>
"I see." Zen raised his eyebrows but didn't look flustered at all.
<br><br>
"How ignorant you are!" Pearson felt even more embittered now. He regretted that he had sympathized with Thurston and Sawyer and followed these humans.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine knew what they were talking about, but it remained silent. From the moment it handed over its life source, it no longer had control over itself.
<br><br>
Not long after they arrived at the edge of the Purple Wind Gorge, they spotted some creatures climbing up the stair.
<br><br>
There was a group of palm-sized but fully armed mouse-shaped creatures.
<br><br>
There were dozens of other creatures covered in the mist.
<br><br>
There were four giants like withered trees, more than two hundred feet tall.
<br><br>
There were two kings of Diabolic Demons radiating with murderous intent.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits also showed up.
<br><br>
But this time, they did not charge in.
<br><br>
The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit had been betting on the other races to tire out Zen and his group, but they were not so stupid.
<br><br>
Since Zen and his group were wanted by the Element Spirit Civilization, they knew they were definitely not weak.
<br><br>
"You destroyed the Diabolic Earth and killed my clansmen, you brat! You'll pay for that today!" One of the Diabolic Demons took two steps forward, looking like he could swallow Zen in one gulp.
<br><br>
When the other creatures heard this, their expressions changed slightly.
<br><br>
"The Diabolic Earth has been destroyed?" one of the giants asked carefully.
<br><br>
The Diabolic Earth was now as quiet as death. No one dared to go and have a look, so only a few people knew about it.
<br><br>
"Humph!" The Diabolic Demons didn't answer.
<br><br>
"Did they destroy it?" the giant pressed.
<br><br>
"Yes! It's that brat!" The king gritted his teeth and pointed at Zen.
<br><br>
Hearing this, the creatures started to stir uncomfortably.
<br><br>
The Diabolic Demons were among the top three most powerful races in the Grand Pure Realm. It was near impossible to kill them.
<br><br>
All this time, they thought Zen, who had defeated Hawley, just had a powerful physique.
<br><br>
It seemed that the information they got was completely inaccurate.
<br><br>
Although surprised at this development, the creatures did not retreat. After all, they still had the advantage of numbers.
<br><br>
However, they were all now waiting for another to take action first. Even the Diabolic Demons could only seethe in silence and glare at Zen.
<br><br>
They were left in a stalemate.
<br><br>
All the people on the Heavenly Eye Vine looked grave, while Zen remained composed.
<br><br>
The stalemate was broken moments later, however, as Zen sensed something. He suddenly looked at the Purple Wind Gorge behind him.
<br><br>
"Master Fuxi, please get the Solid Lightning Powder ready."
<br><br>
Chapter 3984 The Stone Spirits Faced with such a dire situation, they had no way of retreating.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Fuxi brought out the Solid Lightning Powder.
<br><br>
Splash! With just a slight shake of his hand, the scattered granules of the Solid Lightning Powder clumped together as if by an invisible force and turned into a huge palm.
<br><br>
This palm was even bigger than the previous one.
<br><br>
When the bull-headed man with golden horns and the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit saw the palm, their eyes narrowed slightly. Although they had never seen this before, but something about it attracted attention.
<br><br>
The other bull-headed men subconsciously took a few steps back.
<br><br>
They didn't know how the Solid Lightning Powder could channel the lightning from the Heavenly Thunder Plain, but its power was still quite terrifying.
<br><br>
Whoever took action first would be blasted into pieces by the lightning.
<br><br>
The bull-headed men and the Space Manipulating Spirits were at an advantage now. They had seen the power of the Solid Lightning Powder before. And at the moment, they were waiting for those who had no idea about the power to charge forward.
<br><br>
However, it was natural that the creatures that could survive in the harsh environment of the Three Purities Stage would not be so stupid.
<br><br>
As soon as Fuxi brought out the powder, they immediately went on high alert.
<br><br>
"What is that?" a giant asked.
<br><br>
"I have no idea," another giant replied, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Everyone, be careful. Retreat slowly. We need to be careful!" The mouse shaped creatures began to retreat.
<br><br>
The other creatures followed suit.
<br><br>
"These people are just playing tricks on you. You all are incredibly powerful in the Grand Pure Realm. Why are you so scared of them?" the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit asked loudly.
<br><br>
Let alone the giant creatures, even the small mouse-shaped creatures would not be easy to deal with.
<br><br>
True to their shape, these creatures were known as the Terror Mice. The destructive power of their seemingly small bodies was easily about one fifth of what the bull-headed men were packing. Moreover, their number was much larger than that of the bull-headed men.
<br><br>
"Why don't you attack them first if you are so sure?" one of the Terror Mice asked.
<br><br>
They weren't the only ones who were displeased. Other creatures also cast unfriendly gazes at the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit. She was way too cunning for comfort.
<br><br>
Time passed by. The two sides were at a stalemate.
<br><br>
"They dare not attack us," Fuxi remarked from the middle of the vine. His hand was raised and he would have sent out the powder any time.
<br><br>
"It's not that they do not dare," the Snake Goddess shook her head in negation. "Rather, they are not of one mind. They each have their own plans about dealing with us and they can't come to a single decision."
<br><br>
"Yeah. The problem is, every single one of them wants to pay less and get more in return," Yasamin replied, shaking her head with a sneer. But there was a hint of sadness in her smile.
<br><br>
She had just regained her freedom and would have liked to see Dorothy.
<br><br>
However, it seemed like she had no chance at the moment.
<br><br>
"Zen, do you have some ideas? You look rather calm," Eastern Emperor Taiyi suddenly asked through telepathy.
<br><br>
His lips had moved slightly, but his words were heard clearly by everyone on the Heavenly Eye Vine.
<br><br>
Zen thought for a moment and then replied in affirmation, "Yes, I do have an idea. When I say, you grab the Heavenly Eye Vine."
<br><br>
Everyone was confused when they heard his words.
<br><br>
How could he escape from such a dire situation? The Snake Goddess looked at Zen sideways. She guessed that there was a chance he might have received the Primeval Lord of Heaven's guidance.
<br><br>
Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven had the power and the skill to make the Solid Lightning Powder in the Heavenly Thunder Plain, perhaps he also had a way of dealing with the Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
In any case, Zen's words did calm everyone down a little.
<br><br>
In fact, Thurston and Sawyer were no longer worried. They fully trusted Zen.
<br><br>
There was a strange look in Pearson's eyes though.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunters weren't the targets of the Element Spirit Civilization. If the creatures did decide to attack them later on, he would easily find a way to take Thurston and Sawyer away. As for the humans, he was already being rather kind by not adding insult to injury.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Just then, a group of Earthly Dragon Snakes also climbed to the seventh stair.
<br><br>
In the last attack, although Fuxi's Solid Lightning Powder had proven incredibly effective and powerful, it hadn't killed them all. Instead, most of them had passed out because of the shock wave. After a long time, they had woken up and were chasing after them once again.
<br><br>
That did not mean that they were unharmed. They had suffered a great loss due to the Solid Lightning Powder. When they saw it in front of Fuxi, they instinctively felt scared.
<br><br>
However, they did not tell other creatures about the power of the powder.
<br><br>
Instead, they carefully retreated to a side and hid their poisonous jaws. It was time for some other tactic instead of a head-on collision.
<br><br>
Very soon, a few more creatures came. The already small seventh stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau was becoming rather crowded now. But when the last team finally came up, the eyes of all the creatures present lit up as if they had found salvation.
<br><br>
The final team comprised of several round stone creatures, known as the Stone Spirits.
<br><br>
These creatures were extremely powerful and known to possess infinite amounts of strength. Strictly speaking, the Stone Spirits were under complete control of the Element Spirit Civilization. The Element Spirit Civilization had always treated these spirits in a special manner, and they had maintained a good relationship since a long time ago.
<br><br>
However, the Stone Spirits' intelligence was extremely low. They had no strategic ideas and could be easily cheated, which meant they weren't of much use on their own.
<br><br>
After the announcement of the bounty, the Stone Spirits had come here in a hurry, but they weren't here for the bounty. They just wanted to help the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! After the Stone Spirits climbed up one by one, they fixed their eyes on Zen and his group.
<br><br>
No one spoke or gave any orders to them. Instead, as if they were preprogrammed robots, they acted on their own.
<br><br>
The Stone Spirits marched forward and rushed towards Zen and his group.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others saw the Stone Spirits coming their way, and they immediately had a bad feeling about that.
<br><br>
The other creatures were unwilling to make a move first because they were suspicious of each other. The Stone Spirits, however, were simple-minded.
<br><br>
And if they were ridiculed by the other creatures and goaded into attacking Zen and his group, they would instantly attack. And who could deal with their attacks! The situation right now was even worse than they had imagined. The Stone Spirits had instantly rushed towards them right after arriving there.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! The Stone Spirits rushed over in unison, and the ground of the seventh stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau began to tremble from their march.
<br><br>
"Zen, aren't you ready yet?" Fuxi called out anxiously.
<br><br>
It was a matter of life and death now, and he had become very serious.
<br><br>
Zen frowned and said, "Now's not the time!"
<br><br>
"Then I guess we'll have to fight." Fuxi's palm shook slightly, and a mark of the Eight Diagrams suddenly appeared and began floating in the middle of the Stone Spirits.
<br><br>
"Let me fight first," Pearson said as he stepped forwards. He waved his hands gently and his arms turned into spider threads that swept towards the Stone Spirits. The Stone Spirits who were wrapped by the spider threads immediately stopped as if they had lost all of their strength and will power.
<br><br>
Within a few seconds, Pearson's entire body had turned into spider threads and wrapped up the Stone Spirits. The Stone Spirits were totally motionless now.
<br><br>
Seeing that the Stone Spirits had been stopped, the other creatures began to make their moves now.
<br><br>
The ones who were shrouded in the mist made the first move. As they stretched out their hands, waves of white mist began floating towards the bodies of the Stone Spirits. When the mist had completely enveloped the Stone Spirits, it turned purple.
<br><br>
These creatures could control several forms of mist, and each of them had a different effect. The red blood mist had the power to confuse the enemy; the yellow poison mist was highly toxic; the green spiritual mist could generate white bones and muscles; the purple mist could corrode everything.
<br><br>
It was undoubtedly not easy to corrode the Stone Spirits. Moreover, the mist creatures hadn't launched a heavy attack this time. Their main goal was to corrode the spider threads wrapped around the Stone Spirits' bodies.
<br><br>
Pearson's body, which was in the form of spider threads, would be corroded into nothingness very soon.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the purple mist was formed, Pearson sensed the danger and immediately pulled back the spider threads to form his body.
<br><br>
Even though his reaction had been extremely fast, the spider threads had broken down at several places. If he had moved just a little later, he would have been completely corroded by the purple mist.
<br><br>
As soon as the spider threads were removed, the Stone Spirits began moving once again.
<br><br>
Chapter 3985 The Green Wind After some of Pearson's threads were corroded, he grew a little weak.
<br><br>
Looking at the Stone Spirits with a pale face, he shook his head. "I've tried my best, but I can't stop them."
<br><br>
He wanted to take Sawyer and Thurston away but the two brothers' serious demeanor made him hesitate.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! While the Stone Spirits seemed to be slow in movement, they were actually quickly rushing forward, making the ground tremble.
<br><br>
In the distance, the creatures held their breaths. They were looking for an opportunity to make their move, but first, they had to carefully observe the humans' skills.
<br><br>
Fuxi narrowed his eyes at the sight of the Stone Spirits growing closer and closer. Finally, he couldn't restrain himself any longer and stretched out his hand to make a smack.
<br><br>
The palm condensed by the Solid Lightning Powder appeared among the Stone Spirits and collided with the Eight Diagrams mark, now emitting a snow-white light.
<br><br>
Almost all the creatures were enveloped by the light—they had to shield their eyes with their hands.
<br><br>
Following the flash of light, there was a dense and indistinct sound of thunder, like the piercing pitch of a sharp object tearing at a surface. The power that surged had all the mist creatures and Terror Mice quickly retreat.
<br><br>
Some of them even jumped from the seventh stair to the sixth.
<br><br>
After a while, the lightning finally dissipated.
<br><br>
Once everyone recovered their sight, they saw the Stone Spirits in the center of the open space lying on the ground. Most of their bodies were completely charred, their hands and feet were chopped to pieces, and some figures were even smashed into powder.
<br><br>
"How horrible…" a Terror Mouse remarked while climbing up from the sixth stair, getting a peek at the scene.
<br><br>
"It was the Heavenly Thunder Plain's lightning. How did he make it?" The mist creatures exchanged glances, confused.
<br><br>
"It has something to do with the powder," shouted a giant.
<br><br>
Then, the others began yelling as well, making the other creatures cast a cold glance at them.
<br><br>
Anyone with a discerning eye could easily see that it had something to do with the powder in Fuxi's hand—they wondered if he still had any with him.
<br><br>
On the ground lay the Stone Spirits that could no longer get up. They gathered so densely that all of them were enveloped by the lightning. None of them managed to escape.
<br><br>
Silence filled the seventh stair.
<br><br>
All the creatures' eyes were on Fuxi.
<br><br>
It seemed like the lightning was the humans' best trump card.
<br><br>
The powder was supposedly highly rare, so it was likely to be limited.
<br><br>
If Fuxi didn't have any left, the situation would be simple.
<br><br>
Noticing all the creatures staring at him, Fuxi couldn't help but feel a tad bit embarrassed.
<br><br>
He undoubtedly knew what they were thinking.
<br><br>
But now, he had used up all the Solid Lightning Powder. He couldn't use it again.
<br><br>
While Fuxi stood stiff, the Snake Goddess suddenly turned to Pearson.
<br><br>
"Eternal Realm Hunter, you still have some brown divine thunder powder.
<br><br>
Please bring it out."
<br><br>
What was that divine thunder powder? Before Thurston and Sawyer could even comprehend what she said, Pearson knew exactly what the Snake Goddess was referring to. With a flip of his hand, brown powder began pouring out.
<br><br>
It wasn't the Solid Lightning Powder, but the Bone-coagulating Powder that had been used to destroy the Space Manipulating Spirit's Endless Corridor.
<br><br>
The two kinds of powder looked exactly the same. Both were brown, but their auras were completely different—one contained the power of lightning, while the other contained the power of space. One's spiritual sense could pick out the difference.
<br><br>
But as an Eternal Realm Hunter, Pearson was experienced. When he poured out the Bone-coagulating Powder, he hid its aura ingeniously.
<br><br>
Seeing what Pearson did, the Snake Goddess seemed appreciative.
<br><br>
It was no wonder that the Eternal Realm Hunters could stay in the Three Purities Stage for such a long time. Their reactions were rather quick.
<br><br>
Coincidentally, Pearson had just obtained quite an amount of Bonecoagulating Powder—it turned into a palm as tall as ten feet and stood before Fuxi.
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
The sight rendered the creatures speechless.
<br><br>
Previously, the brown palm wasn't as large as the current one, but it had still managed to annihilate all the Stone Spirits with its immense power. Just how terrifying would this brown palm be? Just like what happened the last time, no one dared to make a move.
<br><br>
But while Pearson and Fuxi's cooperation was flawless, there were still some doubts.
<br><br>
The golden-horned bull-headed man knew that Thurston, Pearson, and Sawyer were the Eternal Realm Hunters from the very beginning. Although they weren't humans, when the Snake Goddess asked Pearson for the powder, Thurston and Sawyer looked completely stunned and unaware of the powder—it was all too strange.
<br><br>
Even stranger was the fact that Pearson had deliberately hidden the brown powder's aura.
<br><br>
The bull-headed man quietly sent his analysis to the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit. The latter agreed, but she sneered as she asked, "Will you dare to launch an attack? If you want, I'll send you there."
<br><br>
The bull-headed man merely glared at her and said nothing.
<br><br>
While he was indeed suspicious, he didn't have to risk his life over it.
<br><br>
But the situation couldn't go on as such.
<br><br>
Soon, some of the creatures came up with an idea—they asked each of the races to gather some creatures and set up an attack together.
<br><br>
The plan was acceptable enough for all the races to agree.
<br><br>
Seeing how the creatures prepared for a new attack, Fuxi and the rest pulled a long face.
<br><br>
They were still facing an impasse, after all. No one was attacking them yet, but who could tell when they would need their defenses up before the wind in the Purple Wind Gorge came to a halt? As quickly as possible, the creatures selected a number of daredevils.
<br><br>
These daredevils were to test the powder in Fuxi's hands—if it was truly the Solid Lightning Powder, they would undoubtedly die.
<br><br>
But the leaders' orders were to be strictly followed without complaints.
<br><br>
After forming a new team, they were ready to make a move.
<br><br>
Fuxi frowned. The Eight Diagrams mark was now floating before him as the great palm was ready to slap at any time.
<br><br>
The selected daredevils' bodies trembled violently. If the palm exploded, they would undoubtedly die.
<br><br>
"Are you courting death?"
<br><br>
When Fuxi roared, the mark of the Eight Diagrams began rotating.
<br><br>
Seeing that he was actually going to slap the palm, the daredevils who were determined to sacrifice themselves stopped simultaneously, some of them even stepping back.
<br><br>
But Fuxi didn't dare to use the palm.
<br><br>
Otherwise, the creatures would find out it wasn't the Solid Lightning Powder.
<br><br>
Zen's calm expression shifted, a trace of anxiety filling his eyes. While he had hidden it well, the Snake Goddess had sensed it.
<br><br>
What he was waiting for hadn't arrived.
<br><br>
But a great battle could spark at any moment.
<br><br>
"It's fake!"
<br><br>
"He wouldn't dare to use the powder. This is their last life-saving straw.
<br><br>
Attack them!"
<br><br>
"We aren't cowards!"
<br><br>
At this point, the leaders began encouraging the daredevils.
<br><br>
While the daredevils were unwilling, they continued to grit their teeth and rush forward.
<br><br>
Regardless of what means Fuxi used, he couldn't scare the daredevils away.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen sensed something.
<br><br>
At the far end of the Purple Wind Gorge, a purple wind mixed with a green wind, the latter rolling and dancing, approaching rapidly.
<br><br>
"Master Fuxi, use the palm!" Zen suddenly called out.
<br><br>
"Why?" Fuxi asked in return, stunned.
<br><br>
"Do as I say!" Zen firmly ordered.
<br><br>
While Fuxi didn't appreciate Zen's tone, he didn't dare to ignore his command at the critical moment of life and death. And so he struck the giant palm made from the Bone-coagulating Powder.
<br><br>
Chapter 3986 Giant Hawk The Bone-coagulating Powder and the Solid Lightning Powder were similar in appearance, but their properties were vastly different.
<br><br>
After the palm formed by the Bone-coagulating Powder spread out, it exploded out into the air with a terrific roar.
<br><br>
Normally, a small quantity of Bone-coagulating Powder could freeze the space channel and cause it to collapse, but a large amount of Bonecoagulating Powder could even affect ordinary space.
<br><br>
The space around the group of daredevils suddenly became viscous. These daredevils now looked as if they were moving through heavy oil, and their movements slowed and became somewhat comical.
<br><br>
At least, this was how it appeared to those who saw them, but to the daredevils trapped in the space, it didn't feel funny at all.
<br><br>
They felt that their surroundings had changed, and all their hopes were shattered… 'It's all over. This is the end...' 'We are doomed!' 'Self-sacrifice for our race!' Every race had different values their members lived by, but each member had their own thoughts.
<br><br>
However, this "viscous" feeling lasted for only six seconds and then it vanished.
<br><br>
Everything returned to normal...
<br><br>
They looked down at their bodies and hands, and there was an undisguised relief on their confused faces.
<br><br>
"It's fake!"
<br><br>
"That's the Bone-coagulating Powder! It's known for destroying space!"
<br><br>
"They don't have any more of that powder which they used before!"
<br><br>
The daredevils immediately reacted, and the eyes of the non-human creatures in the distance blazed with fury.
<br><br>
Squeak! Squeak...
<br><br>
The Terror Mice let out terrifing squeaks. While they had been standing randomly, they now suddenly lined up orderly. They piled together according to some unspoken rule, three to a group, or five, or seven, and then they charged forward… Thump! Thump! Thump...
<br><br>
The giants also barged ahead.
<br><br>
Although their movements were cumbersome, they could cover a huge distance with a single step. For them, a span of hundreds of thousands of feet was only a few steps.
<br><br>
The mist creatures drifted forward...
<br><br>
The blue haired spirit and the golden-horned bull-headed man also became anxious.
<br><br>
They hadn't even considered that the brown powder in their opponents' hands could be fake! In particular, the blue-haired spirit wanted to slap herself a few times. After all, she had suffered the effects of the Bone-coagulating Powder before, and she should have considered this possibility in advance.
<br><br>
However, they still had a chance. Anyway, Zen and his group couldn't escape.
<br><br>
But it never occurred to them that their thinking was flawed.
<br><br>
As the warriors from many races began their headlong rush, a hint of green arose from the Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
At the same time, wisps of purple wind stirred from the Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
These purple winds were the most lethal catchers on the Grand Pure Realm, but they couldn't capture the green shadow.
<br><br>
Only once the green shadow had completely risen did the warriors from many races see its form clearly.
<br><br>
It was a huge hawk! His feathers, which looked as if they were carved out of jade, were crystal clear, fluttering in the wind.
<br><br>
As the purple wind howled closer, it actually swept over the hawk's feathers; however, it could do nothing to the giant hawk… "The Wing King!"
<br><br>
When Pearson saw the huge creature, he became very excited.
<br><br>
It was strange that Pearson was familiar with the Wing King, but on second thought, it made perfect sense to Zen.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization that the Wing King once led had also been a mighty ruling civilization. However, following the battle with the Nihility race, he had been left no choice but to lead the Regal Jade Civilization to hide away in the Lust World.
<br><br>
Their choices were identical to those of the human race, but there were still more human elites trapped on the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others saw this huge hawk, which seemed to be carved from jade, their eyes widened with awe. He could freely soar in the Purple Wind Gorge. Was this where Zen's confidence came from? "Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
The Wing King stretched out his pair of razor talons and grabbed the Heavenly Eye Vine, like a hawk catching a snake. The difference was that the Heavenly Eye Vine was unequivocal about its own situation and remained compliantly motionless.
<br><br>
"Stop that bird!"
<br><br>
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak… The Terror Mice roared and hurled their weapons at the giant hawk in a frenzy.
<br><br>
The mist creatures also twirled their black hooks, trying to grapple with Zen and the others and bring them back...
<br><br>
Seeing that these warriors of the various races were all attacking ferociously, the Wing King flapped his great wings and flew hard ahead.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
Strong winds suddenly and violently blew on the seventh stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau.
<br><br>
If it had just been a gust of wind, it wouldn't have mattered. The warriors present weren't afraid of the Wing King.
<br><br>
Over the years, they had encountered many powerful warriors from the ruling civilizations.
<br><br>
The problem was that this was the Purple Wind Gorge! It was unquestionable that the Wing King could avoid the purple wind.
<br><br>
What escalated the situation was that when he beat his wings powerfully to create a strong wind, he inevitably attracted the purple wind from the Purple Wind Gorge to rear up at the same time! Almost all of the warriors now had terror in their eyes.
<br><br>
Earlier, those daredevils had been fortunate to survive, but now that they had rushed to the front, they couldn't avoid the purple wind this time.
<br><br>
The purple wind draped around the daredevils like silk and dragged them towards the Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
It wasn't merely the group of daredevils who proved unlucky. The Terror Mice and the mist creatures who had just rushed forward were also tangled in the purple wind.
<br><br>
No matter the length of their struggles or what theurgy they used, none could break free.
<br><br>
Noticing how unfavorable the situation was for them, the warriors from other races could only beat a hot retreat. In the end, they could only watch the Wing King rise into the air and flap off towards the Purple Wind Gorge...
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
The purple wind in the Purple Wind Gorge was like a silken banner which had its own awareness, and it was crazily chasing after the Wing King.
<br><br>
However, the Wing King was very familiar with the patterns of the purple wind, so he didn't struggle to avoid them. The purple wind couldn't touch him at all, and of course, it couldn't touch the Heavenly Eye Vine in his claws either.
<br><br>
"Zen, you scared me! I didn't expect you to possess such a trump card."
<br><br>
Fuxi gasped for breath.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the others also felt intense relief. The Snake Goddess had believed that it would be the Primeval Lord of Heaven who would make a move, but she didn't expect the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization would come.
<br><br>
The top of the Heavenly Eye Vine was lifted high, and Pearson was standing at the top, speaking with the Wing King.
<br><br>
Thurston and Sawyer had just allayed the crowd's doubts.
<br><br>
When the Regal Jade Civilization had explored the Grand Pure Realm back then, there had once been a Regal Jade Spirit who became lost.
<br><br>
Later, the Wing King led their race to escape and hide in Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit that went missing didn't know about it, so he became a stray of the Regal Jade Civilization, wandering outside.
<br><br>
By chance, this Regal Jade Spirit had become an Eternal Realm Hunter. He had a good relationship with Pearson, and they were as close to each other as brothers.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, this Regal Jade Spirit died at the hands of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Before he died, he entrusted Pearson to help him find the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
It had proven impossible for Pearson, who had continuously been exploring the Three Purities Stage, to find the Regal Jade Civilization that had been hiding on Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
However, Pearson hadn't expected that he would meet the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization at this time. It was not difficult to imagine how excited he was.
<br><br>
Chapter 3987 No Turning Back Pearson told the Wing King the story of the Regal Jade Spirit in detail.
<br><br>
The Wing King was silent for a while before he sighed and said, "It looks like Dashawn had done a lot of things after we left. It's my fault. We shouldn't have left him behind."
<br><br>
Dashawn enjoyed a status that was almost the same with the Regal Jade Spirit in Zen's body. He was also the core figure of the Regal Jade Civilization and the Wing King's right-hand man.
<br><br>
"Dashawn didn't regret anything or blame you. He just wanted me to tell you everything he had done," Pearson said.
<br><br>
The Wing King nodded and said, "I see. I hope, one day, you can take me to the place where he died."
<br><br>
"Yes, I will!" Pearson said, folding his hands in respect.
<br><br>
He was also a man who valued friendship. He wouldn't otherwise have risked his life to stay with Thurston and Sawyer. Zen and his group were chased all over by all the warriors from other races in the Grand Pure Realm. No other place in the Grand Pure Realm was more dangerous than where he was staying with them.
<br><br>
But there was now something more important to do, which was why they couldn't immediately visit Dashawn's resting place to pay tribute to him.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
More gusts of purple wind swept over them.
<br><br>
The purple wind had completely occupied the space in the middle of the Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
No one knew what kind of method the Wing King had used. He could always find space in the purple wind and dodge it. And no matter how close the purple wind was to him, it could never wrap itself around him.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine was also trembling in the Wing King's claws.
<br><br>
Thanks to their keen senses, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others could perceive that this trembling was actually a strange bodily movement technique, which was the secret method to avoid the purple wind.
<br><br>
Zen didn't care about these details. He stared at the purple wind and asked, "There is no purple wind on normal days. What's it like at the bottom of the Purple Wind Gorge?"
<br><br>
"There is a kind of shellfish that is very weak," answered the Wing King.
<br><br>
"After taking root at the bottom of the Purple Wind Gorge, they can't move for a lifetime, which is why they lack the means to find food. Fortunately, as creatures of Stage Thirty-three, these shellfish also have a strange theurgy."
<br><br>
"Is the purple wind their bloodline theurgy?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Wing King continued. "These shellfish release the purple wind, but it's not to seal off the Purple Wind Gorge or to deal with the warriors from other races above. They are just hunting for food. They release the purple wind to hunt for food when they begin to reproduce."
<br><br>
"The warriors from other races that fell down have all become their food! It's really amazing!" Zen murmured.
<br><br>
As for how the Wing King avoided the purple wind, Zen didn't ask.
<br><br>
When he had started to decide the route in the beginning, Zen had known that the Wing King had entered the Three Purities Stage from the Regal Jade Spirit in his body. The Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization could sense the position of the Wing King.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit had told Zen with certainty that the Wing King could easily take the group through the Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
Now, it seemed that everything had come through even though there had been a little trouble in the process.
<br><br>
"Did you choose the Whining Road?" the Wing King asked again.
<br><br>
The Wing King had once led many of the Eternal Realm warriors of the Regal Jade Civilization to advance into the Supreme Pure Realm. But they failed when they were four hundred miles from the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization was strong enough. They had merely chosen a different path.
<br><br>
At the time, the Wing King had been in a hurry to prove himself. After entering the Three Purities Stage, he had led his people towards the Supreme Pure Realm through the Flame Road.
<br><br>
The Flame Road was a very difficult road. There were very few people who chose this road to enter the Supreme Pure Realm. At the time, the Wing King had overestimated the strength of the Element Spirit Civilization, which was why he had suffered a great defeat.
<br><br>
If the Wing King hadn't been in a hurry, it would not have been impossible for him to enter the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
"Yes, Wing King," said the Snake Goddess, folding her hands towards him in respect.
<br><br>
"I've heard that the Whining Road is a dangerous road. Are you sure you will succeed?" the Wing King asked again.
<br><br>
They had failed near the entrance of the Flame Road, which was a pain he would never get rid of in his lifetime. It had made him extremely sensitive to these roads.
<br><br>
"We passed successfully," said Fuxi proudly.
<br><br>
The Wing King nodded, but his expression soon turned gloomy. "That's good. I failed when I had the chance."
<br><br>
"It's not that your strength wasn't enough. You just didn't have a thorough understanding of these roads at the time," the Snake Goddess said, trying to reassure him.
<br><br>
The creatures on the Other Shore knew more about the Three Purities Stage with the passing of time. Just like the mysterious veil had been pulled down bit by bit, the creatures that had later tried had become more familiar with these roads. It would now naturally be easier to pass through them.
<br><br>
"I think I can benefit from your success this time and enter the Supreme Pure Realm with you," the Wing King added.
<br><br>
A smile appeared on the Snake Goddess's face. "Wing King, you are being modest."
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
As the wide wings of the Wing King flapped fiercely, the group of people in the purple wind sped up again.
<br><br>
After a few minutes, the Wing King began to rise upwards. He flew upwards for a while before emerging from the purple wind.
<br><br>
Towards everyone's left was a cliff that stretched for thousands of miles. On the right was an endless plain.
<br><br>
Once the Wing King put the Heavenly Eye Vine down, Zen began to look at the scenery in the distance, a strange expression soon crossing his face.
<br><br>
"I'm now standing in the north and facing the south," Zen said, pointing at the plain in front of him. "If I keep going along this plain, won't I reach the south of the Grand Pure Realm?"
<br><br>
To put it more simply, if this plain was the center of the Grand Pure Realm, they could have reached this place if they had gone up along the Divine River and then crossed it after they came out of the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
They needn't have spent so much effort in going around it.
<br><br>
"That's not a plain," the Snake Goddess said, walking up to him. "It's just an illusion. The entrance is over there."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess pointed at a place a little distance away.
<br><br>
There were two rows of inconspicuous fences.
<br><br>
A simple entrance sat in between these two rows of fences.
<br><br>
Zen frowned at this sight. The fences weren't remarkable but Zen should have noticed them. The fact that they hadn't struck him was strange.
<br><br>
"If we had walked through the plain, the only road to the Supreme Pure Realm would be through the entrance between these two rows of fences."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stretched out her slender fingers and drew a line in the air. "If you don't walk through this road and try to pass through other places on both sides, you will be lost forever in this endless plain."
<br><br>
"Is this illusion that powerful?" Zen raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>
As the Snake Goddess nodded, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice rang out in Zen's mind. "This plain is not an illusion!"
<br><br>
"If it weren't an illusion, we could just come out of the plain by retracing our steps. Why would we be lost forever?" Zen asked in his mind.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven chuckled. "Those who enter the plain can no longer turn around. The thoughts of all of the people who enter the plain will change irreversibly and they will lose the ability of turning back."
<br><br>
"Is turning back also a kind of ability?" Zen was speechless.
<br><br>
"Yes, and changing your thoughts doesn't mean modifying your memories.
<br><br>
It's by making you not realize you have this ability of turning around, so that you can only move forward permanently. You know something is wrong, but you will never be able to figure out what it is," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained, shrugging. "This is indeed a miraculous plain. It can suppress the thoughts and logic of all living beings."
<br><br>
Chapter 3988 Treacherous Beings Zen did not pursue the topic about the plain's magic ability. He went to the entrance, which was two rows of fences, with the others.
<br><br>
The fences seemed to have existed for a long time as they looked utterly decayed.
<br><br>
There were exquisite carvings on the surface of the fences, and they were rotten as well.
<br><br>
Upon closer look, Zen noticed that there was a complete carving on top of a post, but a film of dust covered a part of it. Just as he was about to brush it off, Fuxi looked at him in horror and said, "Zen, don't touch this fence!"
<br><br>
Zen's fingers stopped one inch before the fence and he asked, "Why?"
<br><br>
"There's something ominous about the fences. Anyone who touches them can't get out of the Whining Road," Fuxi said with certainty.
<br><br>
Zen raised one brow. "Is that so?"
<br><br>
He didn't believe Fuxi, but everything was possible on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Perhaps, the fences did have something to do with the Whining Road.
<br><br>
In the end, he did not touch the fence. At that moment, the Heavenly Eye Vine extended a thin branch and gently touched his forehead, then passed its thoughts to him. "I... I've already sent you here. Can I leave now?" it said.
<br><br>
Zen had forced the Heavenly Eye Vine to come with them, and its life source was still in his hands.
<br><br>
He glanced at the Heavenly Eye Vine's large pupil and said, "As far as I know, you can only go through the Silent Path if you go back from here. Do you think those races will let you go?"
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine was also a member of those races. The problem was that those warriors had thought that it had shifted to Zen's side.
<br><br>
Even in ordinary times, it was hard for it to survive alone without the Arrow Demons. Now, those races were already enraged at what it did, so the chances of them letting the Heavenly Eye Vine go were quite small.
<br><br>
The vine thought for a while and answered, "No, they won't..."
<br><br>
"Then what's your plan?" Zen asked again. "I...
<br><br>
I'd better follow you... " In reality, the Heavenly Eye Vine didn't want to follow Zen and his group.
<br><br>
After all, the Whining Road was dangerous and full of strange things.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it was hard for it to survive alone due to its current state, even if it did reach the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
"If everyone is ready, come with us. It is said that the Whining Road is very mysterious and terrifying.
<br><br>
I think everyone here must've known about it except for Zen, right?" Fuxi announced. In turn, Zen's eye twitched and he glared at Fuxi.
<br><br>
"The Whining road is indeed dangerous, but it's actually quite simple once we discover its secret.
<br><br>
That is also why we chose it," Fuxi explained as he turned around and walked towards the road between the two rows of fences. "Everyone, please follow me closely. I'm sure we can pass safely!" he continued.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine immediately followed behind Fuxi. It was afraid of being left behind.
<br><br>
But when it went to the front, the others got squeezed out of the line.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked helplessly at the Heavenly Eye Vine and said, "Do you want to stay in my spirit beast bag?"
<br><br>
Fortunately, his spirit beast bag was large enough to hold the Heavenly Eye Vine.
<br><br>
However, most creatures refused to stay in a spirit beast bag unless the bag's owner was someone they highly trusted.
<br><br>
Perhaps the dangerous Whining Road intimidated the Heavenly Eye Vine so much, that it quickly stretched out a thin vine then touched Fuxi's head, sending him the message that it had agreed to his suggestion.
<br><br>
Afterward, Fuxi released the Augury Dog from the spirit beast bag and put the Heavenly Eye Vine inside it. They also needed the Augury Dog to pass through the Whining Road, and he had planned to release him anyway.
<br><br>
Then, they walked into the path between the fences one after another. The Wing King's body was too large, so he shrunk himself before he proceeded.
<br><br>
Yet, nothing changed after they went in.
<br><br>
There was still the endless plain in the distance. On one side was a cliff, and on the other was the end of the Purple Wind Gorge.
<br><br>
As for the two rows of fences, they were like rows of wood lined up on the plain, which did not mean anything.
<br><br>
But after they traveled some more, a faint white fog appeared around them.
<br><br>
The further they moved, the thicker the white fog was.
<br><br>
Zen looked back and found that both the cliff and the Purple Wind Gorge disappeared.
<br><br>
However, the two rows of fences were still there, and their positions just annoyed them. "The road between the fences is closed?" Zen asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
There were two rows of fences before, but now they became one as if by magic.
<br><br>
"Don't ask," the Snake Goddess hissed.
<br><br>
Just then, her eyes glowed red, as if she tried to infuse the shadow of Snake Goddess into her eyes. He wondered what she saw when she did that.
<br><br>
But since she told him not to ask, he just stayed quiet.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters were also confused, but they followed the Snake Goddess and Fuxi obediently.
<br><br>
They walked for a little more, then a cabin with a spire appeared in the thick fog.
<br><br>
When they got closer, Zen saw that it was a thatched hut.
<br><br>
The thatched hut had no doors, so he couldn't see what was inside.
<br><br>
The moment they approached it, however, they felt extremely uncomfortable.
<br><br>
To the people who had held high positions for a long time like Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, the sensation felt like an uncontrollable urge to kill each other.
<br><br>
Still, they were in a mysterious place, so they restrained themselves.
<br><br>
As soon as they passed the thatched hut, everyone could restrict the strange feeling inside them.
<br><br>
However, two more thatched huts appeared in front of them.
<br><br>
All the thatched huts were closed, but the creatures inside had given them an unpleasant feeling.
<br><br>
Driven by curiosity and uneasiness, King Ieuan could not help but ask, "What exactly is inside them?"
<br><br>
"Don't ask," the Snake Goddess stated again.
<br><br>
King Ieuan's soybean-like eyes flashed, but it couldn't do anything but continue to move forward.
<br><br>
When they passed by another neat row of thatched huts again, Pearson suddenly stopped. "You have to tell us what's inside them before we decide to move forward or not," he demanded.
<br><br>
It wasn't that Pearson didn't trust the Snake Goddess, but the Eternal Realm Hunters never pinned all their hopes on others.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was better if they knew things in advance so they could deal with emergencies if there were any.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes brimmed with regret. She should have told them the rules first before entering the road, but now it was too late.
<br><br>
"It's a kind of Treacherous Being," she replied.
<br><br>
Upon hearing her answer, Pearson only frowned. He already had a rough guess of what was inside the huts, and when he forced an answer out of the Snake Goddess, he was not surprised.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Sawyer and Thurston blanched in fear, and it was clear that they were afraid.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, King Ieuan, and Zen didn't have any reaction.
<br><br>
Even in the Supreme Pure Realm, there weren't many creatures who knew about the existence of "Treacherous Beings." Naturally, those warriors who explored the Grand Pure Realm had never heard of them.
<br><br>
When they saw how Sawyer and Thurston looked, however, they immediately understood that those creatures would be a challenge.
<br><br>
Chapter 3989 A Village Fuxi picked up the Augury Dog when they were passing by the neat row of thatched huts and held him in his arms.
<br><br>
The Augury Dog was sensitive to all kinds of power. Now that they were on the Whining Road, the unpleasant aura around the place was beginning to overwhelm him. He looked sickly and weak.
<br><br>
Every time Fuxi passed by a thatched hut with the dog in his arms, his glassy eyes glinted with obvious hostility.
<br><br>
He probably understood that the things in the thatched huts were too strong for them, so he dared not bark wildly. Instead, he whimpered, trying not to let his voice be obvious.
<br><br>
The Augury Dog continued to whimper as they walked past the first row of thatched huts.
<br><br>
When they reached the end of the first row, Fuxi whispered to him, "Is there a thatched hut available for us?"
<br><br>
The Augury Dog shook his head.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess exchanged a worried glance.
<br><br>
When they had entered the Whining Road the last time, they had found a thatched hut in the front row pretty easily.
<br><br>
Their luck seemed to have run out this time. All twenty-six thatched huts in the first row were occupied.
<br><br>
"Let's try the second row!"
<br><br>
Fuxi knew there was no time for them to lose. He hurriedly went to the second row with the Augury Dog in his arms.
<br><br>
There were a lot of thatched huts in the second row as well. As before, the Augury Dog sniffed at each thatched hut and tried to find a safe place for them to stay.
<br><br>
But they combed through the second row and the Augury Dog still couldn't find an unoccupied hut.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess blinked but didn't say a word, while Fuxi's face darkened. "The third row then!" he growled.
<br><br>
The others following them remained silent, but they began to become more worried with every passing minute.
<br><br>
It was true that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had once made their way to the Supreme Pure Realm through this path. But their previous success now seemed to have stemmed out of sheer luck.
<br><br>
And luck didn't seem to be on their side this time.
<br><br>
If they couldn't find an available thatched hut this time, things would become hard for them — even harder than being under siege on the top of the Sky Ladder Plateau.
<br><br>
There were seven rows of thatched huts in this area, like a large village in a savage land.
<br><br>
Fuxi took the Augury Dog along to check on every thatched hut in the remaining five rows, but to no avail. His face looked ghastly pale, as if he was terribly ill.
<br><br>
"It's getting late. The sky is much darker now," Zen reminded them, looking up at the sky.
<br><br>
This area was covered in white mist and it was hard to tell the time, but it was obvious that the sunlight had dimmed.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked up, alert at this news, anxiety coursing through him.
<br><br>
They would be in great trouble once night fell.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked like an ant in a hot pot and the Snake Goddess took it upon herself to console him in a calm, soft voice. "There are more huts scattered around here. Let's check each of them out. There's no hurry, Fuxi. We still have time."
<br><br>
The thatched huts in the middle of this area weren't the only ones. There were many others on the periphery.
<br><br>
Drawing comfort from the Snake Goddess's words, Fuxi took a deep breath and nodded. He then walked towards the scattered thatched huts with the Augury Dog.
<br><br>
He examined one thatched hut after the other but the result disappointed him yet again.
<br><br>
The sky was already dark, night drawing close.
<br><br>
"Since we need an unoccupied thatched hut, why don't we work together to drive the Treacherous Being in one of the huts away? Why should we go to all this trouble to find an empty one?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi grumbled impatiently, unable to stand it anymore.
<br><br>
He thought that no matter how powerful the Treacherous Beings were, it wouldn't be a problem for them to tackle them.
<br><br>
Even discounting Zen, all the warriors present were collectively a force to be reckoned with in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had barely finished talking when a deep, angry howl suddenly sounded from the nearest thatched hut.
<br><br>
It was hard to tell whether the voice was male or female. The howl seemed to contain an extraordinary magical power, causing everyone to cover their ears.
<br><br>
More shrill wails followed the first howl, each emanating from a different thatched hut. The Treacherous Beings had begun to wake up in succession.
<br><br>
"Oh no!"
<br><br>
The Augury Dog in Fuxi's arms whimpered, terrified.
<br><br>
"There are several more thatched huts over there. We can give them a try,"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess pointed at a corner. There were six or seven thatched huts in the direction she was pointing.
<br><br>
Fuxi didn't hesitate this time. He strode up to them, the Augury Dog still whimpering in his arms.
<br><br>
The Augury Dog tried hard to quell his fear and sniff at each hut. When Fuxi passed by the third hut on the left, his eyes suddenly lit up with hope.
<br><br>
"Thank God! This one is empty! Let's go in!"
<br><br>
Zen, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others were anxious as they followed.
<br><br>
But the Augury Dog's words were instant in cheering all of them up.
<br><br>
Fuxi lifted the flap of the hut and hurried inside, the others following closely behind.
<br><br>
The thatched hut was almost as tall as the shrunken Wing King, but it was still barely tall enough to let him in. Upon noticing this, the Wing King had to shrink himself further. Only then did he dive into the hut.
<br><br>
Fuxi didn't close the flap until the Wing King had entered the hut.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the piercing howls that had lingered for so long in everyone's ears died out. And thanks to this, the discomfort that had haunted everyone was now finally gone.
<br><br>
There was nothing inside the thatched hut apart from a wooden pillar at its center.
<br><br>
This pillar, pockmarked with several fist-sized holes, seemed to have existed for a long time and looked like it would fall apart at any time.
<br><br>
"The Whining Road is worthy of its name. It's terrifying enough even though we haven't encountered anything yet," King Ieuan commented solemnly.
<br><br>
"Well, we wouldn't be talking like this if we had encountered something,"
<br><br>
said Fuxi with a wry smile.
<br><br>
Yasamin breathed a sigh of relief before she asked, "How long will it take us to pass through the Whining Road?"
<br><br>
"Thirty-two hours make for a day on the Whining Road. We only need to stay here for about three days," the Snake Goddess replied.
<br><br>
Zen had zoned out and had been staring at the pillar. At the Snake Goddess's words, he looked around, his eyebrows raised, and said, "We only need to stay safe for three days?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded. "That's all, yes. We'll stay here for three days and after that, we'll return the way we came. We'll then be able to enter the Supreme Pure Realm."
<br><br>
"I didn't know the Whining Road is such an easy path!" Thurston was surprised at the rules. The Eternal Realm Hunters had their own way to reach the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
In fact, they had more than one way.
<br><br>
But no matter which path they took, they would have to expend full courage and strength.
<br><br>
In contrast, the Whining Road seemed too easy.
<br><br>
"It can't be this simple," Sawyer said, shaking his head. "If this was the case, many more creatures and Eternal Realm warriors would've chosen this path and this path wouldn't be called the strangest of all. Don't forget that there are a bunch of Treacherous Beings outside."
<br><br>
At the mention of the Treacherous Beings, it was as if the light was turned down, given how everyone's faces paled, their hearts sinking within them.
<br><br>
"What on earth is a Treacherous Being?" King Ieuan asked curiously.
<br><br>
Except for Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters, no one else knew what their enemies on the Whining Road were or what a Treacherous Being was.
<br><br>
"They have no specific form. They-" The Snake Goddess paused, trying to think up the correct word to describe them. After a while, she said, "It doesn't matter. When it gets darker, you'll be able to see them with your own eyes."
<br><br>
Chapter 3990 Howls It was already dusk and the village was being engulfed by darkness little by little.
<br><br>
Earlier, some rays of light were strongly shooting into the thatched hut. But as the sun went down, the small hut was also enveloped in darkness.
<br><br>
Fortunately, everyone possessed good eyes that they could still use to see their surroundings clearly, even in the pitch darkness.
<br><br>
"Waah! Waah!"
<br><br>
Soon after, loud howls were heard outside.
<br><br>
Just then, a ball of light was seen not far away. It was so bright that everyone could see it even through the thick thatches of the hut.
<br><br>
"Cover your ears quickly!" Fuxi ordered urgently.
<br><br>
Just after the ball of light appeared, piercing screams resounded. "Waah! Waah!"
<br><br>
After a while, the screams stopped.
<br><br>
"So, that's a Treacherous Being?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked as he pointed at the ball of light seen roaming outside.
<br><br>
When they looked through the thatches, they found that the ball of light had a rather irregular shape and that the piercing screams actually came from it.
<br><br>
"That's right. It seems that they have begun to move," the Snake Goddess replied with a nod.
<br><br>
While they were still conversing, another Treacherous Being appeared from the distance.
<br><br>
And like the first one, it also let out shrilling screams.
<br><br>
As time passed by, more and more Treacherous Beings appeared.
<br><br>
In the beginning, they were still able to bear the head-splitting howls, but as the Treacherous Beings grew larger in number, the howls seemed to be endless and it was as if their energies were being drained.
<br><br>
Soon, their faces contorted badly and turned blue as they became distressed.
<br><br>
"Is it going to continue for the whole night?" Zen asked in a low voice, holding his aching head.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess smiled bitterly and said, "One thing is for sure, it's just the beginning. There is a division of labor among the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Every night, they will gather together and howl desperately. These deafening screams could actually be heard even from faraway places."
<br><br>
The howls had been so terrifying. If ordinary people were on the receiving end, they would surely drive them crazy.
<br><br>
This was because it wasn't just a simple howl, but an aggressive spiritual attack.
<br><br>
"I don't think we can bear this for several hours. Is there something that we can do?" Yasamin asked with a livid face. Her heart was thumping so fast because of restlessness.
<br><br>
"Destroy your hearing," Fuxi blurted out of nowhere. "We can still use our spiritual senses to communicate with each other. We just need to repair our hearing tomorrow morning."
<br><br>
Fuxi's words made sense to everyone. Yasamin quickly raised her hands and stabbed her eardrums with her fingers.
<br><br>
Her hearing was instantly destroyed as a stream of blood came out from her ears. Immediately after, her face relaxed and a clear expression of relief was seen.
<br><br>
Without thinking twice, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, King Ieuan, the Wing King, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters also followed suit and stabbed their eardrums.
<br><br>
It would be pretty easy for them to restore their damaged hearing afterward, so there was no point in enduring a senseless struggle. It was more accurate to say that they "turned off" their hearing rather than "destroyed them".
<br><br>
"Zen, what about you? Can you still bear the howls?" The Snake Goddess asked as she took a glance at Zen.
<br><br>
"Yes, I'm fine," Zen replied.
<br><br>
"You don't have to be stubborn. The Treacherous Beings' howls go against nature. They can make you collapse. You have to destroy your hearing before it takes a greater toll on you," the Snake Goddess warned.
<br><br>
"Okay," Zen answered.
<br><br>
At this moment, the last of the Treacherous Beings walked past the hut and let out a sharp howl. After this, the village fell into a brief silence again.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others had already destroyed their hearing, so they didn't have any reaction to the sudden change in the surroundings.
<br><br>
However, for Zen and the others that still had their normal hearing, the sudden tranquility didn't seem natural.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the silence didn't last for long.
<br><br>
Through the thatches, they saw from a distance that the white balls of light were gathering again. In just a matter of seconds, the next wave of deafening howls resounded through the sky.
<br><br>
Previously, the Treacherous Beings howled in rapid succession, but this time, they howled in groups. The sharpness was the same as before, but the power they contained was much stronger.
<br><br>
"Woof…"
<br><br>
The Augury Dog barked in a low voice and looked at Fuxi with a pitiful face.
<br><br>
Fuxi then gently tapped the dog's ears with his fingers, and also damaged his hearing.
<br><br>
It was the turn of Fuxi and the Snake Goddess to "turn off" their hearing.
<br><br>
Before doing so, Fuxi turned to Zen again and said, "Why are you hesitating? Hurry up and just do it."
<br><br>
Although Zen's endurance was much stronger than the others, he still felt tortured as the howls grew louder and louder.
<br><br>
He decided to follow Fuxi and also stabbed his eardrums with his fingers.
<br><br>
As he pierced his eardrums, a brief rumbling sound reverberated in his head. Then, the entire world surrounding him became quiet. There wasn't a single sound to be heard.
<br><br>
However, just then, he felt a cool sensation hovering in his ears.
<br><br>
Then, he realized that his hearing had completely recovered.
<br><br>
This time, the ear-piercing howls sounded so much louder than before. It was as if the noise was drilling through his skull.
<br><br>
When Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others saw Zen desperately holding his head with a facial expression of excruciating pain, they were shocked and confused.
<br><br>
"Zen, what's wrong?" the Snake Goddess asked through her spiritual sense.
<br><br>
"My hearing is restored," Zen answered as he endured the pain he was experiencing.
<br><br>
"What? How?" The Snake Goddess was bewildered at what just happened to him.
<br><br>
Then, she started to realize that it must have something to do with his bloodline.
<br><br>
'Don't tell me… The bloodline restored his hearing?' the Snake Goddess thought as she narrowed her eyes.
<br><br>
"Waah! Waah!"
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings outside once again let out a wave of high-pitched howls which seemed to be ten times louder than before.
<br><br>
The piercing screams started to mess up Zen's mind, so he stabbed his ears and destroyed his hearing. In an instant, he became deaf again.
<br><br>
Just when he thought that there was silence again, his hearing was restored at a faster rate this time.
<br><br>
The howls resounded in his ears again.
<br><br>
"Damn it! Again!"
<br><br>
Zen stabbed his ears again.
<br><br>
However, this time, his hearing was restored before he even felt the pain of stabbing himself in his ears.
<br><br>
When everyone saw him repeatedly stabbing his ears, they were confused and worried. They used their spiritual senses to ask the Snake Goddess about what happened. After knowing what happened, they were rendered speechless, and they looked at Zen with sympathy.
<br><br>
After stabbing his own ears for over a hundred times, Zen finally chose to give up and just let the howls resound in his ears.
<br><br>
Currently, the ancestry-level bloodline was still unable to replace him.
<br><br>
Otherwise, it wouldn't need such a troublesome method to make him suffer.
<br><br>
However, there must be other reasons for it to do so.
<br><br>
Zen gritted his teeth and sat with his legs crossed. He gathered his resolve and wore a serious face.
<br><br>
Since he couldn't avoid hearing the howls, he had no choice but to do his best to bear them.
<br><br>
Neither Fuxi nor the Snake Goddess knew how devastating the Treacherous Beings' howls could be. Every night, they would destroy their hearing before they experienced a much more intense level of the howls.
<br><br>
An hour hadn't even passed but the intense pain had already been unbearable for Zen. The entire night would last for twenty hours. That meant his suffering would be unimaginable.
<br><br>
While everyone was staring at Zen with a worried face, they still maintained sharp vigilance.
<br><br>
If the Treacherous Beings found out where they were hiding, it meant immediate death for them.
<br><br>
They also had to keep watch on Zen. If the moment came that he wasn't able to control himself and started wreaking havoc because of the pain, they would need to stop him at all costs.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen's pain and suffering only lasted for about four hours. As the painful expression on Zen's face gradually disappeared, it was replaced by a suspicious look.
<br><br>
He knew that there was something wrong going on. The howls had changed and turned into low chanting sounds.
<br><br>
Chapter 3991 Calling Fuxi had been observing Zen closely the whole time.
<br><br>
He was curious as to why Zen's pained expression gradually calmed down.
<br><br>
"Zen, have you sealed off your hearing?" he asked through his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
Zen was still carefully distinguishing the low chanting sounds. When he heard Fuxi's question, he shook his head and said, "No."
<br><br>
"It seems that you're not in pain anymore…" At that point, Fuxi was even more surprised.
<br><br>
"The howls are gone. The Treacherous Beings you mentioned seem to be chanting something now," said Zen.
<br><br>
Fuxi arched his brows at Zen's words. "What are they chanting about?"
<br><br>
Before they entered the Whining Road, he and the Snake Goddess prepared quite well.
<br><br>
After all, they would die if they were not careful on their way to the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
When they hid in the thatched hut before, they also destroyed their hearing.
<br><br>
However, Fuxi brought out a mouse from his spirit beast bag every once in a while, so they knew what was going on outside.
<br><br>
The howls on the Whining Road were very powerful. Fuxi's mice also came from the Grand Pure Realm, and they were close relatives of the Terror Mice. Although they weren't rare creatures, they were by no means weak.
<br><br>
However, after the mouse was out for less than nine seconds, its eyes turned bloody red, then its head exploded as it struggled madly.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the Whining Road had twelve hours of daytime and twenty hours of nighttime.
<br><br>
Fuxi released a mouse every two hours to test the situation.
<br><br>
According to his experiment, the howls lasted twenty hours until dawn.
<br><br>
It was not until daybreak when the mouse he had released returned unharmed, that he and the Snake Goddess dared to restore their hearing.
<br><br>
Based on the mice's reaction, the howls of the Treacherous Beings would last a whole night.
<br><br>
However, Zen just said that the howls had stopped, which contradicted his early conclusion. He didn't believe him at all.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen's reaction told him everything, as he didn't show any pain at all.
<br><br>
Did something happen to the Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road? Suddenly, an idea occurred to him. He gently touched his ears, as his palm glowed green. Then, his hearing returned to normal.
<br><br>
He had trusted Zen's reaction too much, but he forgot that Zen had a completely different type of life form after he had obtained a unique bloodline.
<br><br>
Just as he recovered his hearing, the ear-piercing howls immediately flooded his mind.
<br><br>
As a result, his eyes rolled back, and his body convulsed.
<br><br>
"Do you want to die?!" the Snake Goddess hissed madly.
<br><br>
She quickly reached out to him and pressed on his ears. After she shut off his hearing, he stopped twitching. He had fully fainted.
<br><br>
Then, she turned to look at Zen. "What did you do?" she asked in confusion.
<br><br>
He and Fuxi had communicated with each other through their spiritual senses just now, so the Snake Goddess naturally did not know what they talked about, nor did she know why Fuxi suddenly restored his hearing.
<br><br>
However, Zen was also confused. He said, "The Treacherous Beings have stopped wailing. Why did Master Fuxi still suffer?"
<br><br>
"Stopped wailing?" the Snake Goddess frowned. "Maybe you heard a different sound from us," she opined.
<br><br>
By that time, Fuxi woke up already. He released a spiritual sense that conveyed resentment. He glared at Zen and said, "You brat, do you want to kill me?"
<br><br>
Right now, the howls of the Treacherous Beings were quite intense. If it wasn't for the Snake Goddess's quick reaction, Fuxi's soul would've gotten seriously injured. Furthermore, exposure to the howls for five minutes was enough to kill him! "It's my fault, Master Fuxi," Zen apologized. "But what I hear are indeed chanting sounds, and the chants follow certain rules," he explained.
<br><br>
With that, he announced his words to the crowd in the thatched hut through his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
"Chants that follow some rules..."
<br><br>
"Do these Treacherous Beings have language?"
<br><br>
"You must have misheard it. Did the wails damage your ears?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters all looked at him strangely.
<br><br>
No one knew about the origins of the Treacherous Beings. They just appeared occasionally in the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
It seemed that some kind of creature had created them from their resentment. As for why they existed or what they came here for, no one knew. The more they couldn't figure out the Treacherous Beings' origins, the more they became afraid of them.
<br><br>
"I did not mishear," Zen said and shook his head. "These regular chants seem to..."
<br><br>
As he spoke, his eyes suddenly glowed brightly, then he exclaimed, "It appears that they are reciting Sanskrit words!"
<br><br>
The voices uttered the chants in a rhythm. Although their tone was flat and was nothing like singing, it was quite similar to reading Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Back then, when he was with the bald giant by the name of Pompeo, his voice was like singing, and it was also rhythmic.
<br><br>
It turned out that the Treacherous Beings were not wailing, but communicating through the incomprehensible Sanskrit words! "Sanskrit words?"
<br><br>
Everyone looked at each other, confused.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! Forget about whether the Treacherous Beings know Sanskrit or not, or if the wails are a way of their communication with Sanskrit words. Even if it is, you still can't understand it," Pearson said and waved his hand.
<br><br>
There was no way for them to confirm such speculations if they couldn't understand the language used. Thus, Pearson thought that what Zen said was nonsense.
<br><br>
"Not necessarily," the Snake Goddess said with a smile. "He can understand it."
<br><br>
Pearson's, Thurston's, and Sawyer's eyes widened in shock. They thought that the Snake Goddess must be kidding! The Eternal Realm Hunters wandered in the Three Purities Stage all year round, and they also knew a lot about Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
It was still possible to decipher Sanskrit words that were on paper or engraved on something, but not for "Sanskrit words" in chants.
<br><br>
That kind of language contained too much meaning, and it was too complicated.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the creatures in the chaos had innate limitations. Letting them decipher Sanskrit words was equivalent to making the dumb speak and the blind paint. It was beyond their abilities.
<br><br>
Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin also cast Zen strange looks. Then again, they did not know much about what happened on the Other Shore after they got trapped, so they did not know that Zen had such a skill.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure if I can understand, but I can try," said Zen.
<br><br>
What if perhaps the Treacherous Beings did not talk in Sanskrit? If so, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization naturally couldn't decipher them.
<br><br>
Still, he began to communicate with the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
However, he didn't dare let the Heavenly Obsession Civilization listen directly to the wails. Instead, he transmitted the sound he heard into his inner world.
<br><br>
Once the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was ready, it began to decipher the chants.
<br><br>
At the same time, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization on the upper ice field of the Blooming Jade Stage began to operate like mad.
<br><br>
This time, it took longer to decipher the words. After quite a while, a voice came out from the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"They are indeed speaking Sanskrit," it stated. "Then what are they talking about?" Zen asked hurriedly.
<br><br>
"Most of the sounds are meaningless. Perhaps they are scriptures used in a kind of ceremony, and they recite them over and over again," answered the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"Some scriptures..." In all honesty, he was a little disappointed.
<br><br>
Just then, the Civilization Artifact added, "In addition to those meaningless scriptures, there is also a sentence within them."
<br><br>
He immediately perked up upon hearing those words. "What is it?" he asked again.
<br><br>
"They have been calling out 'come back quickly, ' as if one of them went missing. They continually repeat the words so the missing would return,"
<br><br>
the Civilization Artifact said.
<br><br>
Chapter 3992 Revive Come back quickly...
<br><br>
Since the Heavenly Obsession Civilization heard this sentence from the wails of the Treacherous Beings, it meant that they were indeed using Sanskrit.
<br><br>
But who were they calling for? "How is it going? Do you understand what they are talking about?" the Snake Goddess asked while Zen was in deep concentration.
<br><br>
"I can't understand most of the sounds. They seem to be some kind of scripture," Zen paused, realizing everyone was looking at him.
<br><br>
Of all the warriors present, only the Wing King, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess believed that Zen could understand Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess knew what happened in the Blooming Jade Stage; and since the Wing King and a Civilization Artifact in Zen's body were bound together, he was also aware of it.
<br><br>
Others remained skeptical, including Eastern Emperor Taiyi. He and Yasamin had just been rescued and did not have enough time to know about the current situation.
<br><br>
"Are they reciting only scriptures?" Fuxi asked.
<br><br>
"In addition to the scriptures, they also seem to be calling for a companion to return," Zen said admittedly.
<br><br>
"Really? Are you sure you didn't mishear?" Pearson chuckled beside him.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunters didn't believe Zen's words at all. Looking at his seemingly serious expression, they assumed that Zen was talking nonsense.
<br><br>
Zen dismissed Pearson's sarcastic words. He shook his head and said, "No, I'm sure about what I heard."
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization didn't decipher without any basis.
<br><br>
There were only two results of the deciphering: either it was unable to decipher, or it deciphered every word accurately.
<br><br>
Since the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had deciphered it, the information should be correct.
<br><br>
"You are so confident," Thurston said as his eyes glimmered.
<br><br>
"That's it. They indeed lost one companion, so they keep calling for their companion to return," the Snake Goddess suddenly concluded.
<br><br>
Pearson questioned, "You don't know much about the Treacherous Beings, and you just passed the Whining Road by luck. How could you be so certain?"
<br><br>
Pearson could tell that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were inexperienced in dealing with the Treacherous Beings. They had just hidden in the thatched hut in the past and snuck away after three days when the Treacherous Beings disappeared.
<br><br>
In comparison, Pearson had personally witnessed the Treacherous Beings in the Supreme Pure Realm. He believed that he understood the Treacherous Beings better than everyone.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess smiled slightly, reading between the lines of his words.
<br><br>
"There are two hundred thatched huts here. In the past, every thatched hut had a Treacherous Being inside, totaling two hundred Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Now, there are only one hundred and ninety-nine of them. That means one is missing, and a thatched hut is vacant,"
<br><br>
she said as she pointed to the ground, referring to where they were all staying. It was the vacant thatched hut.
<br><br>
The reason why the Whining Road had been difficult to pass was that Treacherous Beings were something no one could resist.
<br><br>
Many Eternal Realm warriors and nonhuman creatures chose to walk this path; but no matter the number, they all had been annihilated.
<br><br>
This made the Whining Road notorious for its cruelty...
<br><br>
Now, there was a Treacherous Being missing from the Whining Road–a thatched hut had become empty. They had used this loophole to pass through the Whining Road.
<br><br>
Hearing the Snake Goddess' explanation, Pearson immediately comprehended. He looked at Zen with enlightenment.
<br><br>
Zen actually could understand Sanskrit words...
<br><br>
"Just as Zen said, they are calling for their companion to return. If that Treacherous Being returns, wouldn't we be in trouble?" King Ieuan suddenly asked.
<br><br>
"It had not been back for so many years. What are the odds that it would come back today?" Fuxi answered, rolling his eyes at it.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi previously had this concern. The two of them were nervous when they couldn't find the empty thatched hut, but now there was no need to worry.
<br><br>
For twenty hours, everyone still had their hearing completely shut. They couldn't hear anything while Zen, on the other hand, continued to listen attentively to the chants.
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been working as well, trying its best to decipher even a little information for Zen.
<br><br>
However, these Treacherous Beings behaved stubbornly...
<br><br>
For nearly twenty hours, they had been reciting the scriptures with only a little communication between them.
<br><br>
Dawn came at the end of the last hour. A faint light peeped from outside the thatched hut.
<br><br>
The strange Treacherous Beings all returned inside of their own thatched hut. They started to communicate while Zen successfully decoded the communication part by part.
<br><br>
A Treacherous Being started walking towards Zen and his group's thatched hut. The Treacherous Being's footsteps approached, with everyone becoming more anxious as they felt it getting closer and closer.
<br><br>
"What should we do?" King Ieuan panicked.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess made a gesture, warning it not to use spiritual sense to communicate with others in case they would be discovered by the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
She walked carefully to the edge of the thatched hut. When the Treacherous Being was about to lift the edge, the Snake Goddess grabbed it, forcing it to shut. The Treacherous Being failed to open it, eventually giving up after several tries.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being turned around to look for another thatched hut instead. It walked further from them, putting everyone's heart at ease. They sighed in relief.
<br><br>
Soon, the sky revealed its full brightness. The Snake Goddess told everyone to recover their hearing and opened the thatched hut.
<br><br>
Everyone walked out the thatched hut one by one. Twenty hours inside such a small space had left them in discomfort. They lifted their arms and bent their bodies to stretch.
<br><br>
"Staying on this road for three days and directly entering the Supreme Pure Realm is the easiest thing we've done in history," Pearson said with confidence.
<br><br>
"I remember the first time we entered the Supreme Pure Realm, half of us died..." Thurston sentimentally recalled. The Eternal Realm Hunters were all elites, but even they had to pay a huge price in going to the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
While everyone was breathing and enjoying the fresh air, the Snake Goddess found that Zen's face was a little gloomy. "Zen, what's wrong?"
<br><br>
Everyone turned their glances, once again focusing on him.
<br><br>
After hesitating for a moment, Zen asked, "Is it really impossible to kill the Treacherous Beings?"
<br><br>
"Yes, it's impossible to kill them," Pearson quickly answered. "Even if they get killed, they will still come back to life. They can't disappear from the world."
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were the real indestructible existences in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
"What exactly did you hear again?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Beings exchanged a few words before they went into the thatched huts. Their companion is trapped outside the Whining Road, which seems to be the Supreme Pure Realm," Zen replied.
<br><br>
"It might have been trapped there for many years." Fuxi nodded.
<br><br>
"But the trapped Treacherous Being has been killed recently. They are trying to find a way to revive it, and they would do it tonight..." Zen continued.
<br><br>
Everyone fell silent upon hearing his statement.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stared at Zen nervously. "Are you sure?"
<br><br>
"I'm afraid so," Zen agreed.
<br><br>
King Ieuan interrupted, "If that Treacherous Being comes back to life, doesn't that mean there won't be any vacant thatched hut?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi shared a dull aura, their faces darkening in fear.
<br><br>
One more Treacherous Being meant that they would lose their hiding place.
<br><br>
If the Treacherous Beings discovered them, they would definitely be attacked. Everyone could die! "Do we still have a chance to retreat?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked as his face turned into a frown.
<br><br>
"If we quit the Whining Road before the duration of three days ends, we will not be able to enter the Supreme Pure Realm nor could we return to the Grand Pure Realm. We will only be lost in the plain where we can never turn back," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
"What should we do now?" Yasamin asked, her face flooded with worry.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess glanced at the thatched huts. "The only way now is to kill another Treacherous Being," she firmly declared.
<br><br>
Chapter 3993 A Hard Choice Zen and his companions were in great trouble at that point. If the Treacherous Being came back to life and couldn't find its thatched hut, it would hunt them down.
<br><br>
It was most likely that two hundred Treacherous Beings would probably come for them.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Treacherous Beings' strengths only gave them a slim chance of survival.
<br><br>
Had it been one Treacherous Being, perhaps they might still make it.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's idea might work.
<br><br>
"Are you sure you want to fight a Treacherous Being?" Pearson sniffed. "Or what? Should we surrender to them instead?" Fuxi asked darkly. "I did not mean to look down on you," Pearson said indifferently. "There was once a race called the Primal Tiger race, in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
They were so powerful that even the Element Spirit Civilization never dared to provoke them. We were lucky enough to befriend them…" he continued.
<br><br>
Although the Eternal Realm Hunters usually traveled alone, they did have some friends in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
For instance, the Primal Tiger race was on friendly terms with the Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
In the past, when dozens of members of the Primal Tiger race fell into a poisonous well, it was the Eternal Realm Hunters who had saved them.
<br><br>
Due to immense gratitude, the Primal Tiger race had promised to protect the Eternal Realm Hunters forever.
<br><br>
After that, the Eternal Realm Hunters turned to the Primal Tiger race whenever they were in peril. That was how they escaped their end several times.
<br><br>
However, a single Treacherous Being slaughtered such a strong race that not even the Element Spirit Civilization dared to instigate! Back then, the Eternal Realm Hunters were also in the tribe of the Primal Tiger race. They didn't take the Treacherous Being seriously at first since they thought that the mighty Primal Tiger race would deal with it.
<br><br>
Even when the Eye Spirit had personally visited the Primal Tiger race to ask for the Eternal Realm Hunters, they just drove him away. Therefore, who else in the Three Purities Stage posed any threat to them? Soon enough, the Eternal Realm Hunters found that they were very wrong.
<br><br>
Simply put, the Treacherous Being's power was far beyond their imagination.
<br><br>
At that time, the Eternal Realm Hunters had only gotten a glimpse of the Treacherous Being. It was a continually changing spirit.
<br><br>
After the Treacherous Being broke into the tribe, it immediately exploded and unleashed blood-red flames that had spread in all directions.
<br><br>
As a result, the vast majority of the Primal Tiger race did not have a chance to escape at all, and the red flames swallowed them.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunters stayed on the edge of the tribe's territory. When they saw the spread of red flames, they quickly fled into the distance — but the red flames still slaughtered three of them.
<br><br>
Even though one of the victims had only barely brushed against the flames, he seemed to have suffered the worst curse in the world. His body crumpled, and his soul turned grey. He faded away each passing day. The others infused their life energies into him but to no avail. In the end, he had died miserably after several months of struggle and torture.
<br><br>
From then on, the Eternal Realm Hunters finally understood the real power of the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
After Pearson finished his story, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, King Ieuan, the Snake Goddess, and even Fuxi, all shared dark looks.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi knew that the Treacherous Beings were horrible creatures, but this was beyond their expectations.
<br><br>
"So what should we do? Do we have no chance of survival at all?" asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
If the Treacherous Beings were surely that powerful, they could not fight back.
<br><br>
"I don't think all of them are as strong as the one in the story.
<br><br>
We may still have a way to deal with them," Zen suddenly said. "What made you think that?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked.
<br><br>
"Someone must have used a special method to drive that Treacherous Being off and sent it to the Supreme Pure Realm," Zen said as he pointed at the thatched huts in the distance.
<br><br>
It was clear that a Treacherous Being in the Whining Road would not leave the place for no reason. Thus, someone must have found a way to lure it to the Supreme Pure Realm. Since someone had managed to do that, they could also deal with a Treacherous Being if they did find a way.
<br><br>
"I agree. Someone must have driven that Treacherous Being away. If we try, maybe we'll also have a chance," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
Then, Thurston asked, "Zen, are you sure that Treacherous Being will come back to life tonight?"
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "I'm not completely sure about that. I heard the other Treacherous Beings discuss that they would bring it back to life tonight, but it does not mean that they'll manage to do so," he answered.
<br><br>
Upon hearing his explanation, everyone became hesitant.
<br><br>
It seemed that the chances of the Treacherous Being's rebirth were not high, but once it came back to life, death and destruction would follow.
<br><br>
On the other hand, if they took the initiative to kill another Treacherous Being first, it was not an easy feat at all. They remained stuck in a dilemma.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Wing King, who usually did not speak much, abruptly said, "Don't pin your hopes on others. Losing the initiative is equivalent to waiting passively to be killed!"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization had placed their hopes on the Nihility race in the past, as they thought that the enemies would pull their punches. In the end, the Regal Jade Civilization had met a tragic end.
<br><br>
"You're right. Once the night falls, we'll have no more chances to fight back," Fuxi said with a nod.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, King Ieuan looked at Thurston and Sawyer, then said, "You can summon the powerful Black Sun, right? If you can pull a Treacherous Being into the Black Sun, then killing it won't be that hard, right?"
<br><br>
It was true that the Black Sun had severe limitations, but it was useful when it came to individual enemies.
<br><br>
"Well, we can try," Thurston agreed. In fact, he already thought of that idea, and that was why he had asked Zen the question.
<br><br>
"Each Treacherous Being has a different level of strength. We still have enough time. We need to find out the easiest opponent," Pearson stated.
<br><br>
Fortunately, daytime in the Whining Road was twelve hours long, so they had sufficient time to prepare before nightfall.
<br><br>
Of course, the task of choosing their opponent fell on the Augury Dog, who was the most sensitive to powers.
<br><br>
He could sense the level of threat of each enemy, which was associated with their strength.
<br><br>
A few leaves gently rustled on the ground as the Augury Dog ran past each of the thatched huts and sniffed them one by one. Every time he passed by a thatched hut, his eyes became filled with fear. However, he went to the next thatched hut without hesitation.
<br><br>
Not long after, he had examined over one hundred thatched huts. When only three huts remained, the Augury Dog stopped before one of the huts and said in a low voice, "This one. This one is the weakest among them all."
<br><br>
The thatched hut he referred to was isolated from the rest.
<br><br>
Still, it emanated a threatening aura.
<br><br>
Then again, it was indeed a little weaker compared to the other Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
"Get ready," Fuxi said to the three Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
The three Eternal Realm Hunters had decided their divisions of labor.
<br><br>
Pearson was responsible for subduing the Treacherous Being, while Thurston and Sawyer would pull it into the Black Sun.
<br><br>
If everything went well, the whole ordeal would only take them a short while.
<br><br>
Now, the others retreated to a safe distance and formed a circle to deal with emergencies.
<br><br>
Finally, they shut off their hearing, then Thurston and Sawyer summoned the Black Sun.
<br><br>
At that point, Pearson turned into a spider web and blocked the front of the thatched hut. "Who will open the thatched hut for us?" Sawyer asked.
<br><br>
His question met silence. Everyone looked reluctant to do the dangerous task.
<br><br>
"I'll do it," Zen said in a resolute voice.
<br><br>
He walked straight to the thatched hut, grabbed a corner of the flap, and slowly lifted it.
<br><br>
The whole village in the vast, white mist was unusually quiet, to the point that everyone heard their heartbeats clearly.
<br><br>
When Zen had lifted more than half of the flap, they all saw a strange thing that lay on the ground.
<br><br>
It looked like a mass of white liquid, but it had limbs and a head.
<br><br>
It also had two black hollows on its head. Everyone felt afraid when they looked into the holes.
<br><br>
"So this is a Treacherous Being..."
<br><br>
"Is it asleep?"
<br><br>
"Its aura feels depressing..."
<br><br>
Without the thatched hut as a barrier, they were now face to face with the Treacherous Being. The air around it felt so uncomfortable, and it overwhelmed them even more.
<br><br>
It appeared that the Treacherous Being was the nemesis of all living beings.
<br><br>
They couldn't help but feel instinctively fearful in front of it.
<br><br>
Zen took a few steps back and nodded at the Eternal Realm Hunters, which signaled them to get started.
<br><br>
Chapter 3994 Possessed By The Treacherous Being The Treacherous Being was not on-guard at all and seemed to have fallen asleep.
<br><br>
Very few people had ever dared to venture into the Whining Road since ancient times. Not many were brave enough to challenge the Treacherous Beings after all.
<br><br>
Nobody ever came through here, thus the Treacherous Beings did not see the need to be so vigilant.
<br><br>
"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."
<br><br>
One by one, long, thin threads crept up towards the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Extremely thin to the point of weightlessness, these spider threads felt no more than specks of dust upon the body of the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Soon enough, these threads covered the creature in its entirety. Every single square inch was tightly wrapped by the spider threads! Swoosh...
<br><br>
The Black Sun in front of Thurston and Sawyer began to spin just as a strong attraction force burst forth from it.
<br><br>
As this strong attraction force came out, it headed straight towards the Treacherous Being and dragged it directly out of the thatched hut.
<br><br>
Its body was soft, liquid, and had the consistency of water. It had since lost its shape and had turned into something that resembled a mass of sticky glue.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
With no struggle on the part of the Treacherous Being, it was quickly and flawlessly sucked into the Black Sun.
<br><br>
It was only then that Thurston and Sawyer separated and the Black Sun promptly disappeared.
<br><br>
If one thought about it, it was actually quite amazing. A horrible Treacherous Being was dealt with in such a short amount of time and with no sort of violent struggle whatsoever.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had to voice out his question through spiritual sense.
<br><br>
"Has the Treacherous Being been sucked in?"
<br><br>
Yasamin nodded. "I suppose."
<br><br>
The Wing King then took his chance to slowly withdraw his wings.
<br><br>
An open space was necessary to deal with a Treacherous Being. If it ever let out a howl to call out its companions, the Wing King would use the space to block off any sound, if it could block it at all.
<br><br>
With their purpose served, the spider threads retreated and reformed into Pearson's body.
<br><br>
"You two should separate further," he ordered Sawyer and Thurston. The Black Sun had never failed them until Zen, of course.
<br><br>
Even if the Treacherous Being was sucked into the Black Sun, it was best to be careful.
<br><br>
What if it turned out that the Treacherous Being shared Zen's ability? What if like the young man, it could also forcibly gather the separated Black Sun? If that was the case, then things would be very bad for all of them.
<br><br>
Sawyer and Thurston did as Pearson ordered and walked further in the opposite direction of each other.
<br><br>
However, Sawyer had only taken a few steps when a white mass suddenly emerged from his back.
<br><br>
It was the sticky body of the Treacherous Being! Pearson was quick to point out this horrifying mass. "Sawyer!" he roared in warning. In a fit of desperation, he had forgotten that everyone had destroyed their hearing and only Zen heard what he said.
<br><br>
Sawyer had no idea what was currently on his back and of the warnings Pearson yelled at him.
<br><br>
The white mass of goo gradually bulged and extended its body on top of Sawyer's head. Then two, hollow eyes appeared.
<br><br>
There was no denying that the Treacherous Being had used some kind of technique to escape the Black Sun before it closed.
<br><br>
"Up there! Above your head!" the Snake Goddess warned Sawyer through spiritual sense. Her words were firm but unlike Pearson; she knew how to use her head.
<br><br>
Panic in their current situation was never a good thing.
<br><br>
When Sawyer raised his head, he immediately paled.
<br><br>
How could this be? This thing had attached itself onto his back! The Treacherous Being was a mass of goo and looked like a slug as it crawled on Sawyer's back. Anyone would get goose bumps just imagining it. When Sawyer turned his head, the Treacherous Being took the chance and planted itself on his face! Swish! Swish! Swish...
<br><br>
The orifices on Sawyer's face were enough for the Treacherous Being to enter his body.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the mass of goo was gone and had completely entered Sawyer! "Sawyer, no!" Thurston screamed. A sudden rage erupted from deep inside him when he saw what happened.
<br><br>
However, along with the anger came fear.
<br><br>
Everything happened so fast. There was no time to react, much less help Sawyer.
<br><br>
With the Treacherous Being now inside him, Sawyer's pupils suddenly rolled back and he stood completely still.
<br><br>
The people around him immediately stepped back, eager to keep their distance.
<br><br>
To everyone's horror, Sawyer turned towards Zen and opened his mouth. He was going to start howling! "Buzz!"
<br><br>
There was a flash of green light as the Wing King spread his wings and formed a protective dome above all of them.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess could only look up in desperate hopes that Sawyer's howls wouldn't wake up the other Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Everyone waited with bated breath to see if the protective dome would do its job.
<br><br>
"It works!" they all exclaimed when they saw the thatched huts remain quiet.
<br><br>
To say that they were relieved would be an understatement.
<br><br>
They couldn't be too sure if the space the Wing King conjured completely blocked Sawyer's howls but it proved to be enough since none of the other Treacherous Beings stirred from their slumber.
<br><br>
However, they still had a problem.
<br><br>
"Zen, can you understand what it's saying?" the Snake Goddess asked him through spiritual sense as the Treacherous Being continued to howl.
<br><br>
"It is being deciphered," he replied.
<br><br>
Since the Black Sun's space failed to trap this Treacherous Being, then this situation had now truly become extremely troublesome.
<br><br>
"Should we kill it?" Fuxi asked. Thurston was quick to shake his head.
<br><br>
"No! Of course not!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
Sawyer was his brother and there was no way he would be willing to kill him. Thurston would rather kill himself than hurt his brother.
<br><br>
"What should we do then?" Fuxi asked. This situation wasn't exactly ideal.
<br><br>
A Treacherous Being's strength was unfathomable and even if the warriors had an advantage, victory remained slippery.
<br><br>
If they waited until the Treacherous Being began to attack them, they would be forced into a passive state.
<br><br>
"I don't care what we do but anyone who hurts my brother will be my enemy," Thurston declared as he shot Fuxi a cold glare. It was obvious that keeping his brother safe and sound was non-negotiable.
<br><br>
"Calm down Thurston. You must remember, that person is no longer Sawyer!" Pearson reminded him.
<br><br>
There were so many monsters in the Three Purities Stage that had the ability of possession.
<br><br>
The Soul-killing Flame for instance was one of these creatures. It existed in the Grand Pure Realm and could possess one's body if a warrior was not too careful. The Soul Leech in the Blood Swamp of the Supreme Pure Realm was another example.
<br><br>
A warrior could already be considered dead the moment these creatures possessed their body.
<br><br>
Since the Treacherous Being was infinitely more terrifying than those things then how could they ever hope for Sawyer's survival?! He was no more than a corpse now! Thurston shook his head in denial.
<br><br>
"But...But..." he stammered and watched as his brother, who had previously been content with howling, suddenly rushed towards Zen.
<br><br>
"We need to act now!" Fuxi declared.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, he stretched out his hand and pressed it onto the ground.
<br><br>
A mark of Eight Diagrams promptly appeared on top of Sawyer's head.
<br><br>
In his determination to take down Sawyer, Fuxi exerted his full strength onto this attack.
<br><br>
Just as Fuxi's attack came down upon the young man, Sawyer suddenly pointed up and touched the mark of Eight Diagrams. To everyone's surprise, it shattered with a loud bang! The attack, backed by Fuxi's full strength, was broken by Sawyer so casually.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish...
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess also went on the offensive and stretched out her shadow's densely-packed tentacles to wrap around Sawyer.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin got busy with using their own unique skills.
<br><br>
Underneath this green space, the collection of powerful energy and the pressure it released was terrifying. Any ordinary creature would tremble in fear.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the thing that possessed Sawyer was far from ordinary. The Treacherous Being had an incredible ability that dissipated any sort of energy sent to harm it.
<br><br>
When Zen saw Sawyer rush towards him, his eyes immediately flashed with determination. Instead of a retreat, he decided to face his opponent head-on.
<br><br>
Eager to take on the offensive, Zen lowered his body and threw a solid punch towards Sawyer's head! "Da!"
<br><br>
Since his body had been transformed by the ancestry-level bloodline, it was a given that the power of his punch would be extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
However, instead of the devastating results Zen expected, Sawyer merely stretched out his finger and pointed it to his fist.
<br><br>
The moment their hands touched, Zen's power completely dissipated.
<br><br>
His pupils widened and he immediately jumped back in retreat.
<br><br>
"What the...? No. Retreat! Retreat!"
<br><br>
Unfortunately, that was no longer an option. Sawyer was fast and immediately grabbed hold of Zen's fist. He didn't seem to exert that much strength but Zen found himself unable to break free of his hold.
<br><br>
"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."
<br><br>
At that moment, a stream of white goo emerged from the orifices of Sawyer's face. It was the Treacherous Being's body! Soon enough, Zen found himself face to face with the Treacherous Being's hollow eyes and its strange smile. It looked at him up and down before suddenly jumping onto his face and into his body the same way it entered Sawyer.
<br><br>
Chapter 3995 The Soul Catching Lamp Thud! Sawyer's unconscious body fell to the ground.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen lowered his head and stood still. Previously, when Sawyer was being possessed by the Treacherous Being, he wasn't able to move either. This time, it seemed that it was trying to invade Zen's body.
<br><br>
"Brother!" Thurston quickly approached Sawyer's body.
<br><br>
He carefully carried Sawyer to one corner to look at his condition.
<br><br>
The others didn't pay much attention to Sawyer right now, for they were all focused on Zen.
<br><br>
Everyone knew how important Zen was. If the Treacherous Being successfully invaded his body, there might be dire consequences.
<br><br>
"What should we do now?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in a panic.
<br><br>
"We have to somehow find a way to drive the Treacherous Being out of his body!" King Ieuan said anxiously, also not knowing what exactly was needed to be done.
<br><br>
Then, the Snake Goddess's eyes narrowed as she walked towards Zen. She stretched out her hand, and a pink flower lamp immediately materialized.
<br><br>
"The Soul Catching Lamp!"
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes lit up as they saw the lamp emerge from the Snake Goddess's hand.
<br><br>
The flower contained in the Soul Catching Lamp could forcefully drive the soul out of one's body.
<br><br>
Even if that person had reached the Holy Soul Realm, he would still find it difficult to resist its power.
<br><br>
However, despite its power, its use was quite limited. This was because the lamp needed to be close to the target in order to be effective.
<br><br>
Because of this, it had never been used in battles.
<br><br>
But now that Zen's body was still motionless, the Soul Catching Lamp came in handy.
<br><br>
The only problem was that they weren't sure if the Treacherous Being was a kind of soul or not. If it wasn't, then the lamp would also be useless.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess didn't have much time to think about it, so she just risked it.
<br><br>
Soon after, the pink flower in the lamp began to glow. Wisps of pink smoke started floating out from it.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The Snake Goddess forcefully blew the smoke.
<br><br>
The pink smoke quickly rushed towards Zen's face and entered into his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.
<br><br>
Then, the Snake Goddess monitored the movements of the Soul Catching Lamp.
<br><br>
In just a matter of seconds, the pink light in the lamp grew brighter and brighter as the flower started blooming.
<br><br>
However, as the flower reached its full bloom, the light suddenly dimmed, and the petals began to wither rapidly.
<br><br>
With a flash in the Snake Goddess's eyes, she yelled, "Now!"
<br><br>
She started grabbing the Soul Catching Lamp and pulled it hard.
<br><br>
She felt that the smoke inside Zen's body latched onto something, so she was trying to pull it out from him.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Soon, wisps of pink smoke came out from Zen's eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.
<br><br>
Everyone was expecting that the Treacherous Being would be pulled out along with the pink smoke.
<br><br>
However, their faces twitched the moment they saw that there was nothing but the smoke.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was the most disappointed of all. She knew that she felt something earlier, so she was also surprised that nothing came out.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Unwilling to give up, the Snake Goddess once again blew the smoke into Zen's face.
<br><br>
Right now, everyone depended on her, so she couldn't fail them.
<br><br>
However, before the Snake Goddess could pull the smoke out again, Zen suddenly opened his eyes.
<br><br>
Everyone was shocked to see that the pupils in his eyes had disappeared.
<br><br>
His eyes only revealed the white parts, and it seemed that he was no longer in control of his body.
<br><br>
Then, in a split-second, the previously motionless body of Zen quickly rushed towards the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Crash! Zen threw a punch at the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was totally caught off guard. At such a close distance, she wasn't able to dodge Zen's sudden strike.
<br><br>
Although it was just an ordinary punch, the force it contained was still extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess instantly flew backward and was thrown far off to the point that she hit the circular space wall created by the Wing King.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen opened his mouth and did the same thing as Sawyer did earlier. He was howling.
<br><br>
Then, he turned around and threw a punch at the green space wall.
<br><br>
Crash! The space wall instantly broke into pieces.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He then strode towards the exit of the village.
<br><br>
"What's going on? What's he going to do?"
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Being doesn't look like it would wake up its companions."
<br><br>
"Then, is it just going to leave this place?"
<br><br>
Everyone had a lot of questions in mind.
<br><br>
They also wanted to chase after Zen, but his speed was just too fast.
<br><br>
Moreover, they wouldn't be able to do anything with the Treacherous Being's strength even if they caught up with Zen.
<br><br>
Previously, when the Treacherous Being had possessed Sawyer's body, it had easily resisted the theurgies of the Eternal Realm warriors. Now that it possessed Zen's body, it was more likely that its strength would also be stronger.
<br><br>
In just a few seconds, Zen had already rushed out of the fences of the Whining Road and disappeared through the vast white mist.
<br><br>
King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others just stood there as they watched Zen's figure vanish into the mist.
<br><br>
They were left dumbfounded at everything that just happened.
<br><br>
"But today is not the third day. Now that he just went out like this on his own, would he be lost on the plain?" King Ieuan couldn't help but ask anxiously.
<br><br>
At the same time, Fuxi was busy helping the Snake Goddess heal her wounds. He looked back and said flatly, "Theoretically, yes. However, there may be an exception."
<br><br>
After all, they all knew that the Whining Road belonged to the Treacherous Beings. Since it possessed Zen's body, then perhaps it wouldn't be lost.
<br><br>
But there were bigger problems to be considered, like Zen's survival.
<br><br>
Could he still survive after being possessed by it? The Snake Goddess was badly injured. But despite her condition, she hadn't stopped thinking of a way to save Zen. However, it seemed like she was also running out of ideas as her face showed an expression of hopelessness.
<br><br>
Eventually, everyone had stopped talking and the atmosphere became even gloomier. At this moment, the silence was broken when they heard someone cough.
<br><br>
"Ahem! W-what happened to me?"
<br><br>
While everyone was getting depressed, Sawyer suddenly woke up in Thurston's arms.
<br><br>
"Brother, you've come to!" Thurston was overjoyed. He was actually thinking if Sawyer was even going to wake up after being possessed by the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Everyone's attention focused on Sawyer. As he tried to recall what happened earlier, his face darkened. He started touching his face and his body but found out that he wasn't hurt.
<br><br>
"Brother, you're fine now. The Treacherous Being has come out of your body," Thurston explained in a soft voice.
<br><br>
All of them thought of the possibility that Sawyer might die. But it turned out that as the Treacherous Being left his body, it also left his body and soul intact.
<br><br>
"This is actually good news!"
<br><br>
"He's fine after being possessed by the Treacherous Being. That means that Zen could also survive!"
<br><br>
"That's right. At least there is still a chance."
<br><br>
As they saw that Sawyer was in good condition, everyone seemed to get a hold of a glimmer of hope.
<br><br>
"I'm connected to the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization, so I can sense his location. After we leave the Whining Road, we could go look for him," the Wing King suggested.
<br><br>
"That's good to know then," Fuxi said as he nodded his head.
<br><br>
Just earlier, they were almost about to give up. But now that they knew that there was slight hope of finding Zen, they decided to give their all for this slim chance.
<br><br>
Now, one more Treacherous Being had left the Whining Road. Even if a Treacherous Being really revived at night, there would still be an empty thatched hut here.
<br><br>
After several hours, the sky started to dim again.
<br><br>
The Whining Road was enveloped in darkness once more.
<br><br>
Thanks to Fuxi's treatment, most of the injuries of the Snake Goddess had already been healed.
<br><br>
Then, everyone stabbed their ears again as they went into hiding inside the small hut.
<br><br>
Through the thatches, they saw the Treacherous Beings flickering in bright white lights.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed as she concentrated on counting the Treacherous Beings roaming outside.
<br><br>
She counted a few times just to make sure. The result was still the same, and there were a total of one hundred and ninety-eight of them. It meant that two were missing.
<br><br>
The first one did not revive, and the other one was the one that possessed Zen's body.
<br><br>
Then, the night passed. As dawn drew near, all of the Treacherous Beings returned to the thatched huts.
<br><br>
They confirmed that one of the missing Treacherous Beings did not come back to life last night.
<br><br>
All of their faces seemed to be filled with regret.
<br><br>
They thought that making the move was a complete mistake.
<br><br>
However, no one knew what the result might be, so they needed to give it a try.
<br><br>
After that night, there was only one remaining.
<br><br>
Then, they could leave the following morning and enter the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Chapter 3996 The Blood Swamp For the first time in their lives, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, King Ieuan, and the Wing King could finally set foot in the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
This was a momentous achievement for all of them.
<br><br>
This was a huge deal especially for the Wing King. Because no matter how powerful he was, he had never entered the Supreme Pure Realm yet.
<br><br>
Because this was their first time there, it would make sense for them to be full of expectations. They were supposed to enjoy and celebrate this wonderful accomplishment.
<br><br>
However, Zen had been missing for quite a while now. So instead of being excited, everyone's heart was heavy. This unfortunate occurrence had really dampened their spirits.
<br><br>
They discussed at length Zen's possible current whereabouts after he left the Whining Road. For the entire day, they only talked about where he could be and how they could possibly find him.
<br><br>
They were well-aware that talking about it while they were in the village would yield nothing. Still, it was obvious that Zen was extremely important to them.
<br><br>
Deep within the hearts of Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, they knew that Zen was the key to the completion of the Finale Way. He was their only hope.
<br><br>
Even if it would cost them their lives, they definitely would not hesitate to save him.
<br><br>
Twelve hours had passed by so quickly. Before they knew it, darkness had fallen once more.
<br><br>
It was nighttime on the Whining Road again. Before long, they heard familiar noises in the distance.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were howling again. This had been happening for the past two nights already. They would appear as soon as the darkness had settled in.
<br><br>
On the third night, the Snake Goddess merely continued counting the number of the Treacherous Beings out there in the dark.
<br><br>
So far, she had counted one hundred ninety-eight of them.
<br><br>
However, she suddenly discovered that some Treacherous Beings formed a strange shape on the Whining Road four hours later.
<br><br>
She kept observing them and realized they were gathering within an area and were making a circle.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, a strange and dazzling white light appeared at the center of the circle.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings as well as the white light were blinding. It was almost as if there was a sun shining at night.
<br><br>
The bright light illuminated the entire area so much that the people inside the thick thatched hut were able to see them clearly.
<br><br>
"What is that white light? Where is it coming from?"
<br><br>
"Look! It is getting bigger and bigger."
<br><br>
As the group watched this scene unfold right before their eyes, they noticed a change in the white light. Seeing this, they instantly had a guess as to what it was.
<br><br>
As the expanding white light began taking shape, it seemed clear to everyone what was really happening.
<br><br>
That specific Treacherous Being was being revived.
<br><br>
It became clear that Zen made the right decision.
<br><br>
If they had made the other choice earlier, they could still spend the second night safely, but it would not be the case this night.
<br><br>
The third night would be riddled with danger. They were quite sure about this.
<br><br>
It was sure as day that the Treacherous Beings would be able to find out they had occupied a thatched hut and attack them.
<br><br>
It would be impossible to hold off and stand against the Treacherous Beings by themselves.
<br><br>
"I wished that Treacherous Being came after me instead of Zen," Yasamin sighed sadly. Her face was full of regret.
<br><br>
She would've had gladly traded her life if it meant ensuring Zen's safety.
<br><br>
She would do this in a heartbeat not only for the completion of the Finale Way, but also for Dorothy's sake.
<br><br>
Everyone had seemed downcast ever since Zen's disappearance. They couldn't help but sigh and wish they could have done something.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Wing King kept observing the scene in the dark. All of a sudden, he spoke using his spiritual sense, "These Treacherous Beings don't seem like they have any sort of intelligence."
<br><br>
His statement was met with looks of utter confusion from everyone in their group. They couldn't quite figure out how or why he came to this conclusion.
<br><br>
They knew that Zen had already deciphered the conversations of the Treacherous Beings before.
<br><br>
Obviously, this meant that they had their own thoughts.
<br><br>
In addition to that, they were even able to resurrect their fallen companions.
<br><br>
How could they not possess any intelligence? "What makes you say that?" The Snake Goddess walked towards the Wing King and asked. Her face was full of curiosity.
<br><br>
"Well, it seems like they don't know that one of them is missing yet,"
<br><br>
replied the Wing King. "And whenever they aren't able to enter a thatched hut, they won't even try to force their way in to take a look. Instead, they will just move onto the next one. That way of doing things kind of strikes me as very mechanical," he added.
<br><br>
If the Treacherous Beings gathered into a group, they would have noticed that one of them was missing and would set out to find their companion.
<br><br>
Before the Wing King mentioned this, no one felt like there was anything wrong about them. But now that they thought about it, they realized how truly strange it was.
<br><br>
"Well, that's true." Fuxi nodded slowly with a frown on his face. He was trying to recall what happened for the past two nights. "Whenever the Treacherous Beings came, I just propped the thatches up and they would just leave. No one ever tried to enter and check."
<br><br>
"Hmm, but how can you explain they know to revive their companion?"
<br><br>
Thurston questioned. He couldn't quite understand it.
<br><br>
"Well, maybe they're just doing it instinctively." The Wing King made an assumption. It wasn't that far-fetched if they tried to think about it.
<br><br>
"How about the Treacherous Being that possessed Zen? Does it also lack intelligence? If so, then why did it run away on its own?" Sawyer paced back and forth while trying to make sense of all this speculations.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess tilted her head and was lost in thought for a while.
<br><br>
"After that Treacherous Being found us and possessed Zen, the best move for it was not to run away. It should have woken up its companions and besieged us instead. What it did is indeed very strange."
<br><br>
To sum it up, the Treacherous Beings' behavior was truly bizarre and incomprehensible.
<br><br>
Hours passed and it was morning once more. They left the thatched hut and walked to the entrance of the Whining Road again.
<br><br>
There were two rows of fences still standing on the left and right of the road. In the distance, they could still see the rolling white mist.
<br><br>
"Well then, let's go! The Supreme Pure Realm is right ahead of us,"
<br><br>
exclaimed Fuxi confidently.
<br><br>
"Everyone, please climb onto my back. I'm afraid there will be more creatures guarding the entrance of the Whining Road," the Wing King reminded them as he lowered his wings slightly.
<br><br>
Even though they had gotten rid of the two Shadow Warriors in the Grand Pure Realm, the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi still had the Shadow Marks on their skin.
<br><br>
It was known that the Shadow Marks would last for five days. There was no way to erase them during this period.
<br><br>
This meant that once they entered the Supreme Pure Realm through the Whining Road, they would definitely and immediately get noticed.
<br><br>
"Oh, you're right. That settles it then," the Snake Goddess replied as she proceeded to climb up.
<br><br>
One by one, they clambered onto the Wing King's back. As soon as everyone settled in, he stretched out his enormous wings and flew toward the Whining Road.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! After they passed along the fences, they eagerly advanced through the rolling white mist.
<br><br>
The two rows of fences functioned not only as the entrance but the exit as well.
<br><br>
There were two different worlds on either side of the fences.
<br><br>
Right after the Wing King swiftly soared out of the white mist, they saw a potholed swamp ahead of them.
<br><br>
Most swamps were usually dangerous. No one knew what might be lurking in them. Now, the swamp in front of them was quite peculiar.
<br><br>
Those deep recesses contained blood rather than normal swamp water. It looked a bit horrific.
<br><br>
"Wow. This is the Blood Swamp. It has already expanded so much!" the Snake Goddess exclaimed in surprise. She did not expect it to be quite this expansive.
<br><br>
However, the three Eternal Realm Hunters were not surprised when they saw the Blood Swamp. The expressions on their faces remained impassive.
<br><br>
"The Blood Swamp will expand every thirty years and it will also shrink in another thirty years. Right now it's in the process of expanding. It's normal for it to expand up to the exit of the Whining Road," Pearson chimed in nonchalantly.
<br><br>
"It seems that the three of you have already come to the Blood Swamp before," Fuxi observed.
<br><br>
Pearson smiled. His expression revealed a hint of excitement. "Yes, we have. Moreover, we actually hid here for quite a long time. That's why we're very familiar with it."
<br><br>
"Well then, please show us the way," the Snake Goddess said as she cupped her hands and bowed slightly at Pearson.
<br><br>
"Our absolute priority now is to find Zen," Sawyer said with pure conviction.
<br><br>
Originally, the Eternal Realm Hunters' goal was to hunt down Zen and his group.
<br><br>
But now, they had chosen to join this group instead because of Zen.
<br><br>
"Okay then. Let's get moving. Wing King, you said earlier that you are able to sense the Civilization Artifact. Can you sense Zen now?" the Snake Goddess inquired enthusiastically.
<br><br>
"Well, I'm going to try."
<br><br>
The Wing King closed his eyes and a green light instantly rose above his head.
<br><br>
It didn't matter how far away he was. He could always communicate with the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization any time. His bond to it was quite special. It was almost as though it was a part of his body.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! "The Regal Jade Spirit." The Wing King's voice reached the Civilization Artifact and sounded from it.
<br><br>
"Wing King." The Regal Jade Spirit's response was immediate.
<br><br>
"Do you know where Zen is right now?" The Wing King promptly asked the question they had all been wanting to be answered.
<br><br>
"After he left the Whining Road, he entered the Blood Swamp. He continues running wildly towards the north. He hasn't stopped yet." The Wing King sensed a deep anxiety in the Regal Jade Spirit's tone.
<br><br>
It was now clear that Zen's current situation was beyond their control.
<br><br>
Chapter 3997 Running After the Treacherous Being drilled into him, Zen completely lost control of his body.
<br><br>
Like flowing water, the Treacherous Being drilled into every bone in Zen's body, assimilating itself into him.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Treacherous Being did not invade his soul.
<br><br>
Helplessly, Zen watched as the Treacherous Being made him run haphazardly.
<br><br>
At some point, he ended up in the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Splash! In its low-lying land, the Blood Swamp lived up to its name. Blood spurted and splashed everywhere.
<br><br>
As Zen ran uncontrollably, he tried communicating with his inner world.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, where are we? Why is there blood everywhere?"
<br><br>
Zen asked.
<br><br>
"This is the Blood Swamp," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered. "It is very dangerous. If you are not careful, you will die here."
<br><br>
For Eternal Realm Hunters who were familiar with the Blood Swamp, this place might not have been so terrifying.
<br><br>
But to those who stumbled into it for the first time, the Blood Swamp was hell.
<br><br>
Underneath the surface of the blood-red puddles, there lived bright red leeches. They camouflaged perfectly with the scarlet blood, and it was difficult even for the spiritual sense to detect them.
<br><br>
Once they quietly latched themselves onto someone, they would release toxins that paralyzed their victims. Then, slowly, those bloodthirsty leeches would devour their victims' souls.
<br><br>
The most terrifying part was that, once they devoured the souls, they would occupy their victims' bodies for a while.
<br><br>
The Soul Leeches didn't have a mind of their own, but they instinctively moved their victims to the Worm Lizards.
<br><br>
The Blood Swamp also had a unique ecosystem.
<br><br>
The Worm Lizard was massive. It was on top of the food chain in the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
Any creature that had the misfortune of stumbling across the nests of the Worm Lizards would be dragged into the darkness, never to see the light of day again.
<br><br>
However, the Worm Lizards couldn't leave their nests, so their range of movement was limited. Except for those who didn't know much about the Blood Swamp, all the creatures knew to avoid the Worm Lizards' nests.
<br><br>
Therefore, they depended on the Soul Leeches to hunt for them.
<br><br>
However, it was a mutual relationship. The Soul Leeches hunted willingly because they needed the Worm Lizards' blood in order to grow stronger.
<br><br>
As Zen ran haphazardly through the swamp, viscous blood splashed all over him.
<br><br>
The Soul Leeches took this opportunity and quietly latched onto his body.
<br><br>
Slowly, they crawled towards his head.
<br><br>
Although these Soul Leeches were very small, Zen noticed them immediately.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, there are leeches crawling all over me!" Zen cried.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was silent for a moment as he studied the situation. "These are the Soul Leeches. They can devour your soul."
<br><br>
"What? These little things can devour my soul?" Zen echoed, his brows furrowing in concern.
<br><br>
"Yes, their abilities are very magical, and they often..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven began to warn Zen, but he had already sprung into action.
<br><br>
"Guess I'll have to get rid of them!"
<br><br>
As he spoke, Zen willed his soul to attack the Soul Leeches.
<br><br>
Since he'd already reached the Holy Soul Realm, his soul was much stronger than that of an ordinary warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm. It wasn't hard for him to slay the leeches that crawled all over his body.
<br><br>
Buzz! Zen's soul glowed dangerously and countless tiny rays of light shot out.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! The rays of light turned into small swords which slashed at the Soul Leeches. They didn't stand a chance. In the blink of an eye, the Soul Leeches that latched onto Zen's body were shredded to pieces.
<br><br>
Zen let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
However, since he was still running uncontrollably, more blood splashed onto him, and with it, more leeches latched onto his skin. Some leeches even managed to take a bite out of Zen's soul.
<br><br>
Even with the help of nine Holy Soul Imprints, his soul was still unable to withstand the attacks from the Soul Leeches.
<br><br>
Zen winced in pain. He knew he couldn't hold out any longer. So, he willed his soul to retreat back into the depths of his mind.
<br><br>
"These leeches are so powerful!" he whined.
<br><br>
The Soul Leeches had only managed to take a few bites, but he already felt half his soul was paralyzed.
<br><br>
"You didn't let me finish speaking," the Primeval Lord of Heaven reprimanded. "Let Zhurong deal with them."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, Zhurong appeared above Zen's head.
<br><br>
Zhurong's energy soul was shrouded in flames, which burned over Zen's head. Soon, the flames enveloped Zen's entire body. From afar, he looked like a burning man running desperately.
<br><br>
The Soul Leeches on Zen's body were scorched into nothingness by the flames, and the blood from the swamp evaporated quickly.
<br><br>
That was one problem dealt with. However, he was still being controlled by the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
By now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zen had already figured out that the Treacherous Being didn't have its own consciousness.
<br><br>
What the Treacherous Being had said when it possessed Zen's body had been deciphered by the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. It was instinctively expressing its regret and anger, trying to break free from the shackles of the Whining Road.
<br><br>
Now it ran like mad, driven solely by instinct.
<br><br>
As for where it was running towards, Zen didn't have the slightest clue.
<br><br>
Neither did he have the time to figure it out, since his top priority now was to stay alive.
<br><br>
Zhurong was just a wisp of energy soul, and before long, his energy was exhausted.
<br><br>
So he was sent back to Zen's inner world. Now, it was Emperor Charm's turn to make a move. After him, another would take his place.
<br><br>
The human heroes had become Zen's bodyguards, protecting his soul from being devoured by the Soul Leeches.
<br><br>
While the many human heroes took turns to attack, Zen's body suddenly stepped into a large pond.
<br><br>
To his surprise, he didn't sink. At the pace he was running, it was a piece of cake for him to walk on the water.
<br><br>
However, he had only taken a few strides forward when a massive head suddenly emerged from the water. It was a Worm Lizard's head. The pond was its nest! Splash! The huge Worm Lizard opened its big mouth and swallowed Zen in one gulp.
<br><br>
It was a creature in the Supreme Pure Realm, so it was far stronger than the creatures in the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Worm Lizard had sensed Zen's presence long ago through those Soul Leeches, but it was very disappointed that Zen killed them off so easily.
<br><br>
However, to its delight, Zen came straight to its nest. Such good luck! The Worm Lizard excitedly snapped its mouth shut and was sinking back into the pond when suddenly, cracks as thick as an arm appeared on the surface of its skull.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The cracks rapidly spread, causing the Worm Lizard to feel a little uneasy.
<br><br>
'What's going on here...' it thought confusedly.
<br><br>
When it finally realized that it was the human in its mouth that was causing the cracks, it was too late. Before it could even react, its head exploded into tiny pieces.
<br><br>
Zen emerged, unscathed, and continued sprinting across the pond as though nothing happened.
<br><br>
Chapter 3998 To The North All the creatures hiding throughout the Blood Swamp were shocked by the Worm Lizard's death.
<br><br>
Despite being the dominant creature of the Blood Swamp, the Worm Lizard had easily been shredded from the inside out. This was incomprehensible to the other creatures.
<br><br>
However, these creatures were only momentarily stunned before they swarmed into the nest of the Worm Lizard.
<br><br>
The Worm Lizard was ginormous, and its flesh and blood contained precious substances.
<br><br>
After devouring them, these creatures would be greatly fortified.
<br><br>
How could they miss out on such a rare opportunity? As the blood surged wildly in the pool, the dead Worm Lizard's bones and flesh were rapidly devoured until nothing was left...
<br><br>
Splatter...
<br><br>
After vanquishing the Worm Lizard, Zen's body kept charging at a huge velocity.
<br><br>
"Alright, this Treacherous Being is extremely powerful. At least, I don't have to worry about any threats to my body." Zen sighed.
<br><br>
It seemed that the Treacherous Being possessed strange magical powers.
<br><br>
It had displayed these powers on the Whining Road when it had managed to resist Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's attacks.
<br><br>
Now that the Treacherous Being had attached itself to Zen's body, it had transferred the same strange power to his body. This was how it had destroyed the Worm Lizard.
<br><br>
"When it leaves the Blood Swamp, we will be able to guess at its intended direction," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. He had no other option except to wait and see.
<br><br>
"Here's something strange," the Primeval Lord of Heaven continued. "Why didn't your bloodline conflict with the Treacherous Being in your body?"
<br><br>
Although the ancestry-level bloodline Zen had been endowed with was beyond his control, it had often saved him at critical moments in the past.
<br><br>
"Maybe the bloodline can't act against the Treacherous Being..." Zen guessed.
<br><br>
There could be no doubt that the ancestry-level bloodline had its own intentions. At the very least, it had displayed a reluctance to fall into the hands of the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
However, when the Treacherous Being invaded Zen's body, the ancestrylevel bloodline showed no reaction to it at all.
<br><br>
"But that's impossible!" The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline filled every cell of Zen's body, and its presence had to have overlapped with that of the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
It was miraculous that there was no conflict between the two.
<br><br>
"Then what else?" Zen appeared bewildered. He was stumped for any other theory to explain it.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven thought for a long while as he considered all possibilities. His eyes suddenly lit up as a realization struck. "Your bloodline hasn't rejected the Treacherous Being. Then there is a likelihood that it is related to the Treacherous Being, don't you think?"
<br><br>
"The ancestry-level bloodline is related to the Treacherous Being..." Zen suddenly cocked an eyebrow. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, does that mean that the Treacherous Beings are not native to the chaos, but they are creatures from the Abstruse Energy World? Or do you mean that they originate from the Four Spirits Sect?"
<br><br>
"Exactly."
<br><br>
"But the Four Spirits Sect consists of human spirits, monkey spirits, snake spirits, and bird spirits. There is no creatures like the Treacherous Beings among them," Zen said doubtfully.
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Beings are not normal creatures. They possess different forms and float aimlessly throughout the year in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
They seem to be a special kind of spirit, or rather...a special kind of soul,"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had once conducted a study of the Treacherous Beings. As with most such forces, his study had ended in failure.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were lethal. Sometimes they appeared quite docile, but at other times they became extremely violent.
<br><br>
It was difficult for the forces in the Three Purities Stage to control them by any means, so there was nothing to do except to steer clear of them.
<br><br>
Therefore, no one knew how they came into being or how they had disappeared. Even though they had wanted to study them, they had no idea where to begin.
<br><br>
Even so, conjectures abounded about the Treacherous Beings' origin.
<br><br>
Since the Three Purities Stage was closely located to the Abstruse Energy World, most would always associate the mysterious beings and events in the Three Purities Stage with the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Many people viewed the Treacherous Beings as souls of the Instant Civilization. As to why these souls couldn't communicate with them or why they acted so unpredictably, there was no explanation for this either.
<br><br>
"That is feasible. However, I was just wondering where this Treacherous Being will lead me to..." Zen sighed with resignation.
<br><br>
After the Blood Swamp's expansion, it now occupied a massive area and seemed almost endless.
<br><br>
As Zen's body crashed ahead at full speed under the Treacherous Being's control, a great number of Soul Leeches were scorched to death along the way. He broke into the nests of six or seven more Worm Lizards, slaughtering them all.
<br><br>
After an entire day… He reached the northern edge of the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
The blood in the swamp was getting visibly shallower, while the temperature cooled.
<br><br>
The Soul Leeches liked a warm environment, so there were less of these creatures in this area of the swamp. Therefore, the Worm Lizards that relied on the Soul Leeches during their hunting couldn't survive in this area either.
<br><br>
What replaced them in the food chain was an even more ferocious creature, the Swamp Prawn.
<br><br>
The Swamp Prawns possessed an astonishingly hard outer shell and congregated in large numbers. They usually hunted in packs and could instantly devour their prey.
<br><br>
An important aspect of the Swamp Prawns was that they were not afraid of death. No matter the superior strength of their prey, they would bite it hard, regardless of their own injuries or possible death.
<br><br>
But this time, they faced a prey that they couldn't tackle at all.
<br><br>
The red Swamp Prawns pounced on Zen in groups, but the Treacherous Being maneuvered Zen's body, making him run wildly while swinging his arms like windmills at the same time.
<br><br>
This might have appeared comical, but the damage dealt by his arms was formidable.
<br><br>
Any Swamp Prawns coming in reach of his arms were instantly shredded, without exception.
<br><br>
The Swamp Prawns were the most plentiful creatures in the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
There were forty to fifty thousand of them in total, and even the powerful Worm Lizards were considered their prey.
<br><br>
However, with their failed hunt of Zen, many of their members were slaughtered and their numbers were greatly reduced! After vanquishing the Swamp Prawns, Zen encountered a group of scavenging black wolves.
<br><br>
As Zen's body was launched into a fight against the black wolves, he heard the Wing King's voice echoing from the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization. The Wing King and the others had left the Whining Road and entered the Supreme Pure Realm. Zen quickly told him his current location. After confirming Zen's location, the Wing King and the others began to soar above the Blood Swamp, chasing after Zen.
<br><br>
Once he had gotten rid of the black wolves, Zen's body finally left the Blood Swamp and moved onto a barren hill.
<br><br>
After directing his body to stand on top of the hill, the Treacherous Being suddenly seemed to have lost its way. It turned Zen's body to look north, west, and then east by turns, as if trying to confirm where it was.
<br><br>
"The west is the Soul-diffusing Highland, and the north is the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, while the east is the Freezing Wilderness. I am unsure of which direction the Treacherous Being will choose," the Primeval Lord of Heaven murmured.
<br><br>
"Where are you being trapped?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"The north," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied. "Beyond the Myriad Pagoda Mountains..."
<br><br>
Had Zen's body not been controlled by the Treacherous Being, he and the others would have successfully entered the Supreme Pure Realm together.
<br><br>
Then, they would, of course, have gone north to rescue the real Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions.
<br><br>
But now, his first priority was to escape the Treacherous Being's control.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the hill beneath Zen's feet began to violently tremble.
<br><br>
With a great rumble, a gigantic turtle head suddenly popped out from the front of the hill, craning around to bite at Zen.
<br><br>
This was no "hill," instead it seemed to be a huge turtle! Before the turtle could injure Zen, he stomped heavily on it, cracking its shell open instantly. In that moment, its head exploded into a spray of blood before it could clamp its jaws on Zen.
<br><br>
Then the Treacherous Being steered Zen's body to fly away. It seemed to finally have determined where to go. It was heading towards the Myriad Pagoda Mountains in the north.
<br><br>
Chapter 3999 The Same Direction "It's heading for the Myriad Pagoda Mountains in the north. What a great coincidence!" Zen exclaimed. "I wonder what it is going to do there." Just now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had told him that the human heroes' real bodies were trapped at the back of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. Thus, it was surprising and fortunate that the Treacherous Being had also taken this path.
<br><br>
However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven sort of thought otherwise. "This may not be a mere coincidence," he said. "I don't think it chose this direction just on a whim. It may have a specific purpose to go there," he speculated.
<br><br>
"A specific purpose? What would that be?" Zen asked out of curiosity.
<br><br>
"To enter the Jade Pure Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered straightforwardly.
<br><br>
The Jade Pure Realm was the core area among the Three Purities Stage, and also the most mysterious one.
<br><br>
Like the Element Spirit Civilization, almost all civilizations also wanted to enter and explore what was inside the Jade Pure Realm. That being said, the human race was no exception.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute. So you mean that the entrance to the Jade Pure Realm is in that direction?" Zen was utterly shocked.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled bitterly. "Well, why do you think we're trapped in here in the first place?"
<br><br>
It turned out that all of the thirty-nine human heroes were trapped on their way to the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The entrance to the Jade Pure Realm had been a tremendous secret for most of the civilizations.
<br><br>
As the Primeval Lord of Heaven led the human race into the Three Purities Stage, the search for the way to the Jade Pure Realm had always been their top priority.
<br><br>
The entrance to the Supreme Pure Realm was located at the center of the Grand Pure Realm. So, the assumption was that the entrance to the Jade Pure Realm might be also lying at the center of the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Based on this conjecture, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had managed to find some clues and ultimately discovered an underground passage at the back of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.
<br><br>
"Until now, I'm still not a hundred percent sure that the underground passage really leads to the Jade Pure Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in a disgruntled tone. "But ever since we discovered that passage, the Element Spirit Civilization had launched an all-out attack on us. If that passage was useless, then why were they desperately hindering us?"
<br><br>
At that time, the 77th chaotic era dominated by humans had been destroyed, and the 78th chaotic era had already begun.
<br><br>
Under the leadership of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the human race began to rise rapidly on the Other Shore. For a very long time, they had been fiercely fighting against the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Back then, the Nihility race had yet to come into being, and the human race was the only force that could stand up as near equals to the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had regarded the human race as a thorn in its flesh and did all it could to restrain their development. However, it never solely focused on them. After all, the Element Spirit Civilization had more than one enemy. Several ruling civilizations had already appeared before the 77th chaos, and these ruling civilizations were also a threat to them.
<br><br>
However, when the Primeval Lord of Heaven had finally led the human race to the underground passage that could possibly lead to the Jade Pure Realm, the Element Spirit Civilization snapped and didn't hold back anymore. They started attacking them with the determination of eradicating the entire race.
<br><br>
"The Eye Spirit gathered almost all of their elite members, but the best that they could do was trap us within the passage," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with pride.
<br><br>
"If they resorted to these kinds of actions, then they really must have been hiding something important. The passage might be leading to the Jade Pure Realm all along," Zen affirmed.
<br><br>
"Well, that's why I said that I'm still not a hundred percent sure. There are just too many secrets in the Three Purities Stage, and the Element Spirit Civilization came before everyone else, so they must have uncovered most of these secrets. They destroyed those without much value, hid the important ones, and tried to keep them to themselves. Anyway, whether it leads to the Jade Pure Realm or not, I'm sure that the Element Spirit Civilization wants to hide something from us, that's why they kept us from advancing in that underground passage." The Primeval Lord of Heaven's words carried the weight of his determination.
<br><br>
While he was communicating with the Primeval Lord of Heaven through his mind, Zen also looked around and examined his surroundings at the same time.
<br><br>
He saw that the Myriad Pagoda Mountains covered a very large area.
<br><br>
The mountains here were completely different from the other mountainous areas.
<br><br>
At a glance, every mountain looked like a lofty pagoda.
<br><br>
Moreover, it was an amazing sight to behold that all of the mountains were almost of the same height and shape.
<br><br>
As he passed through them, he felt as if he had entered a strange, immense forest formed by numerous lofty mountains.
<br><br>
"I just had an idea. Although the Treacherous Being doesn't seem to possess much intelligence, it knows Sanskrit words. How about we try communicating with it?" Zen suggested.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had long established a capable team within Zen's inner world. This team was well-trained and it would be easy for them to pronounce even the complicated Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
After getting out of the Whining Road, Zen had been preoccupied with the constant troubles that he encountered in the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
The Myriad Pagoda Mountains looked much quieter and safer, so he deemed it to be a good chance to give it a try.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had also originally planned to do the same thing, but the situation didn't permit him.
<br><br>
Thus, when Zen suggested it, he quickly gathered the members of his team.
<br><br>
They had practiced and made other preparations to be skilled in terms of cooperation and synchronization.
<br><br>
Following the instructions of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, they began to pronounce the corresponding Sanskrit words. Their voices echoed in Zen's body.
<br><br>
"Can you understand me? Who are you? Can you communicate with me?"
<br><br>
As they pronounced the Sanskrit words together, their voices eventually formed a rhythmic song.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being had taken over Zen's entire body, so it should be able to hear the song.
<br><br>
Both Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven waited expectantly for the Treacherous Being to respond.
<br><br>
However, to their dismay, it only continued to control Zen's body by running wildly, as if it didn't hear anything at all.
<br><br>
Although the result wasn't totally unexpected, the two of them still felt a little disappointed.
<br><br>
"We could still try a few more times," Zen insisted.
<br><br>
With that, the team in his inner world began chanting again and conveyed the messages through rhythmic songs over and over.
<br><br>
Within five minutes, they repeated the same set of questions multiple times.
<br><br>
However, they still didn't get a single response from the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"Well, we did what we could." Zen finally gave up and sighed in disappointment.
<br><br>
It was upsetting enough for him to have his body manipulated by another creature. But what made it worse was that the particular creature didn't have a shred of intelligence.
<br><br>
As Zen chose to give up, he noticed that the Treacherous Being suddenly controlled his body and turned left. It was the first time that the Treacherous Being changed directions after a long while.
<br><br>
After entering the range of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, it headed north for quite a distance before finally changing directions.
<br><br>
While Zen's expression was more of confusion, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's reaction was the opposite. He was surprised, but there was a huge trace of expectation on his face.
<br><br>
Perceiving this, Zen couldn't help but ask, "What's the matter?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven's reaction just made Zen more confused.
<br><br>
"Listen. The underground passage at the back of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains is not easy to find. It took us nearly a third of the chaotic era just to figure out the way to open it. The direction to get to the passage is to go north for three thousand miles, go west for five thousand miles, and then overturn the largest mountain at sight!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained in detail.
<br><br>
Since entering the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had paid special attention to the movements of Zen's physical body because of his hunch.
<br><br>
To his surprise, the Treacherous Being had gone north for exactly three thousand miles before it finally turned west.
<br><br>
At the back of the Primeval Lord of Heaven's mind, this didn't seem to be a coincidence anymore.
<br><br>
"Then, perhaps, the Treacherous Being is actually heading for the underground passage that leads to the Jade Pure Realm!" Zen exclaimed in excitement.
<br><br>
'If that's the case, things would definitely work out, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Once they entered the underground passage and met the real selves of the human heroes, they might be able to figure out a way to resolve Zen's current state.
<br><br>
"Well, there's nothing we could do now but hope for the best," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
The Myriad Pagoda Mountains was indeed a peaceful area. They didn't encounter any obstacles as Zen's body trod all the way to the west.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before a round pagoda-shaped mountain finally appeared on their view.
<br><br>
The mountain was several times broader than the rest, and it was also much higher.
<br><br>
After arriving at the bottom of the huge mountain, the Treacherous Being paused for a moment before it manipulated Zen's body to climb up the cliff.
<br><br>
As Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven witnessed this, their minds were both filled with anticipation.
<br><br>
