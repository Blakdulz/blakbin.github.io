Chapter 3600 The Third Force Although Elvinia agreed that she and Zen should stop, she was still highly concerned about the Moon Fire Slaves' movements.
<br><br>
Seeing that they stopped as well, she finally sighed in relief. "They've stopped too. They can only withstand a limited amount of power."
<br><br>
Zen found some relief in that as well. It didn't look like the Moon Fire Slaves were about to catch up.
<br><br>
But a few seconds later, they began moving forward once again.
<br><br>
After No. 13 halted, No. 12 continued on.
<br><br>
This strategy gave them a great advantage.
<br><br>
"Now it's my turn!" Elvinia called out without turning to Zen.
<br><br>
While she couldn't use the Chaotic Source Spirits in her current form, her corporeal body had refined a great number of Body-strengthening Jades. By no means was she weak.
<br><br>
Before Zen could say a word, Elvinia frowned. "I'm not useless!"
<br><br>
She knew Zen didn't want her to help because he was worried about her safety, but she couldn't let him take on everything by himself. He needed her, and Elvinia was well aware of it.
<br><br>
Swish! Elvinia flew over first.
<br><br>
The centipede had been on guard against Zen, so Elvinia managed to find a good spot from far away. Even as the centipede reacted quickly, Elvinia managed to extinguish the black flame first.
<br><br>
Then, she turned to Zen and said, "What do you think?"
<br><br>
"Very good!" He gave her a thumbs up.
<br><br>
"I will go on then!"
<br><br>
Without pausing, Elvinia took a moment to observe the scene before rushing on to the next lamp post.
<br><br>
Both of the two groups moved along the posts at the same speed, maintaining a constant distance between them.
<br><br>
After some time, Zen felt a sudden vibration from the gray marks on his body—all the wounds he had gotten exploded simultaneously.
<br><br>
He had absorbed a massive amount of Body-strengthening Jades, and the Chaotic Source Spirits had almost reached the late stage. His physical strength far exceeded that of his peers. But when the gray marks on his body exploded, even he couldn't suppress the muffled groan coming out of him as he spat out a mouthful of blood.
<br><br>
The power of settlement had exceeded the limit that the Chaotic Source Spirits could bear, resulting in their fatigued state. But the Truth of Godly Way had soon restored them.
<br><br>
While they were only fatigued for a moment, the power they failed to bear caused much damage to Zen's body.
<br><br>
Luckily, he had absorbed the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed and transformed his body with the Chaos Ancient God's blood. Otherwise, the power would have been far too much for him.
<br><br>
"It's my turn!"
<br><br>
Since the grey marks had been settled, Zen could then replace Elvinia.
<br><br>
In the process of extinguishing the Hidden Spirit Lamps, two gray marks were left on her body. Her body wasn't as strong as Zen's—she was already lucky enough to have managed to survive them.
<br><br>
Fortunately, by then, they had already finished four-fifths of the way. The exit to the circular desert wasn't far away. With Zen's speed, he could leave the Moon Fire Slaves far behind him.
<br><br>
At the bottom of the flat gobi were long, narrow caves, widely distributed across the area.
<br><br>
Over ten huge mice were running wildly within the caves.
<br><br>
They were the Extremity Mice—the natives of Stage Seventeen. Some time ago, the Ear Mice wanted to join them in the hopes of being recognized as their distant relatives. But the Extremity Mice completely ignored them.
<br><br>
Over ten Extremity Mice left the caves and arrived at the edge of the desert.
<br><br>
"Squeak! They're all inside now!"
<br><br>
"The three Moon Fire Slaves are in there too!"
<br><br>
"Hurry up!"
<br><br>
Scattering in all directions, the Extremity Mice began drawing an array on the ground.
<br><br>
The creatures cooperated rather well with each other. In less than five minutes, a great magic array appeared on the gobi.
<br><br>
One mouse pulled out a circular crystal. Under the light's reflection, it could barely even be recognized as a ball, but in the shadow, the ball disappeared, as though it didn't exist in this world.
<br><br>
After the object was positioned right in the center of the array, the latter was activated. Unlike the rest of the arrays that were glowing brightly, this one disappeared the moment it was activated.
<br><br>
"Squeak, squeak, squeak! Masters in the void, come quickly!" the leading mouse called out.
<br><br>
Just then, an invisible wave shot down from the sky.
<br><br>
Bang! The moment the invisible wave hit the ground, the south of Stage Seventeen shook violently—the mice surrounding the array were all sent flying.
<br><br>
Two red balls of light appeared in the very center of the array, each surrounding a faint, human-shaped shadow.
<br><br>
"Squeak, squeak! Masters, here you are!"
<br><br>
"Masters, some people are trying to enter the temple! Squeak!"
<br><br>
By now, the Extremity Mice were speaking over each other.
<br><br>
"That's why you summoned us?" A cold voice came from one of the balls of light.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Those two are not ordinary folk. The Element Spirit race has even sent out the Moon Fire Slaves!" another one of the mice chimed in.
<br><br>
"Moon Fire Slaves? If they are involved, the two must be truly unusual… Do they have the Other Shore Key?"
<br><br>
In the past, they had tried their best to fight for the temple but to no avail.
<br><br>
It was because of the Other Shore Key that they failed.
<br><br>
"Maybe. Masters, you must hurry—they've been in there for too long!" the Extremity Mouse said urgently.
<br><br>
Like the Elephant Man race, the Extremity Mice were stationed there to monitor the temple.
<br><br>
The two figures in the red balls of light took one look at each other before gliding toward the entrance to the circular desert.
<br><br>
Seeing their masters enter the desert, the Extremity Mice all squeaked— hundreds and thousands of them then surged out of the caves They gathered around the two red balls of light like tidewater, and followed the masters into the desert.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen's figure was more like a bolt of lightning than a person as he flew to the side of the lamp post and extinguished yet another black flame.
<br><br>
When he looked up to the front, he finally felt a sense of relief.
<br><br>
The desert's exit wasn't too far away—he only needed to deal with three more lamp posts.
<br><br>
Only two gray marks covered his body. The larger the size of the Hidden Beasts, the stronger their strength. But even they couldn't keep up with him, so passing was no big deal to him.
<br><br>
The two Moon Fire Slaves had already passed through the middle of the desert. When they reached the 'disassembled' Moon Fire Slave, they stuffed No. 14's armor and spiritual core into their pockets.
<br><br>
It was the spiritual core that served as the Moon Fire Slaves' foundation. So long as it was intact, they would never fall to their death.
<br><br>
Continuing forward, they saw the entrance of the desert suddenly flash with a crimson light, from which two blood-red balls of light appeared.
<br><br>
The objects carried a special aura. From the moment they entered the desert from the gobi, Zen was drawn to them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3601 The White Mist Fortunately, Zen's judgment was quick. As soon as he saw the red balls of light, he immediately deduced that they weren't weak compared to the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
At the same time, he felt that the Regal Jade Spirit's emotions had fluctuated wildly. He sensed that there was some kind of uncontrollable anger.
<br><br>
"That's the Nihility race," said the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization was known for their intimidating aura, back when they first set foot on the Other Shore. In a short period of time, they had become one of the top ten civilizations, and the Wing King had become a highly important and powerful existence on the Other Shore. However, due to the conflict with the Nihility race, they had no choice but to hide under the black pool of the Dark Region at Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
From that scenario, one could imagine the opposition between the Regal Jade Civilization and the Nihility race.
<br><br>
"They are of the Nihility race? Why do they look like the Element Spirit race?" asked Zen. He continued to study the red balls in the distance.
<br><br>
Inside the iron house in the energy vortex, the Shape-shifting Spirit had once transformed into a circular ball, which was the form of an Element Spirit.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves descended from the Element Spirit race, but the two red balls looked more like the Element Spirit race than the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
"Humph! The Nihility race is not a civilization. They are a group of creatures that believe in the Nihility Way.
<br><br>
Or rather, they are the traitors from different races," the Regal Jade Spirit sneered.
<br><br>
There was a clear and obvious resentment in the Regal Jade Spirit's voice at the mention of the Nihility race. "I see..." Zen simply nodded.
<br><br>
He never expected that breaking into this place with the Other Shore Key would alert all those powerful beings from the upper stages, one after another.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the two Moon Fire Slaves also noticed the two red balls at the entrance.
<br><br>
"Two Nihility Spirits. They are traitors," No. 12 said coldly.
<br><br>
"Are we going to get rid of them?" No. 13 asked. Naturally, the Element Spirit race did not tolerate traitors.
<br><br>
If they ever came across any betrayers from their race, they would fight them to the death.
<br><br>
"Forget it. It's more important to get the Other Shore Key. Go wake up No.
<br><br>
14. Use my star dust to recover his strength," No. 12 commanded.
<br><br>
Their original plan was to return home after they had obtained the Other Shore Key, and then awaken No. 14.
<br><br>
But now that the Nihility race was there, not only did they have to get the Other Shore Key, but fight against the Nihility Spirits as well.
<br><br>
In addition, they had no choice but to wake up No. 14 right then and there because they needed help. However, they had to consume the extremely precious star dust in order to do so.
<br><br>
In turn, No. 13 hurriedly took out the spiritual core. "Don't worry and don't be too anxious. Those two Nihility Spirits won't be able to catch up with us so soon..." No. 12 consoled.
<br><br>
In any case, the Hidden Beasts would be in the Nihility Spirits' way and that would buy them some time.
<br><br>
Before No. 12 could finish speaking, they suddenly heard an Extremity Mouse squeak.
<br><br>
Then, the Extremity Mice swarmed the lamp posts.
<br><br>
Although the Hidden Beasts tied to the lamp posts were powerful, they were alone and did not have any help. They wouldn't stand a chance against the huge number of Extremity Mice. Furthermore, even if the power of settlement could kill dozens of Extremity Mice, more and more mice would still come.
<br><br>
"Swoosh!"
<br><br>
At that moment, countless Extremity Mice rushed towards the Hidden Spirit Lamps and extinguished the black flames with their own bodies.
<br><br>
Afterwards, they immediately headed to the next lamp posts without any hesitation.
<br><br>
One lamp post...
<br><br>
Two lamp posts...
<br><br>
Three lamp posts...
<br><br>
The black flames on the lamp posts swiftly died out, and the two Nihility Spirits moved forward smoothly. They were so fast that their speed was more than ten times faster than Zen's and the two Moon Fire Slaves'.
<br><br>
Zen was slightly shocked when he saw how quickly they moved. At such a rate, it would only take them five minutes to pass through the circular desert area.
<br><br>
However, he shifted his focus on dealing with the Hidden Beasts in front of him. After he passed by three lamp posts, he finally reached the edge of the desert and arrived at the annular grassland ahead.
<br><br>
The two connected circular areas were like two different spaces. Zen and Elvinia stepped onto the grassland, and then disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
At the same time, No. 13 continuously sprinkled the star dust onto No. 14's spiritual core. Once No. 14 had absorbed enough star dust, green flames burned from the spiritual core and eventually transformed into No. 14's body. Even the originally broken armor was also restored piece by piece.
<br><br>
After No. 14 regained consciousness, he saw the two red balls that moved in the distance. "Well, why are there two Nihility Spirits?" No. 14 asked.
<br><br>
"Ready to fight," No. 12 answered.
<br><br>
The sight of the Nihility Spirits that moved forward effortlessly with the help of the Extremity Mice made No. 12 very upset. They had to kill the two Nihility Spirits before they fought with the two humans for the Other Shore Key.
<br><br>
Yet, the two Nihility Spirits had no intention of approaching the Moon Fire Slaves. They moved a distance, and then directed the Extremity Mice to make a detour, which meant that they bypassed the area where the Moon Fire Slaves were.
<br><br>
To add salt to the wound, the figure in one of the red balls even made a provoking gesture to the Moon Fire Slaves before it left.
<br><br>
In the end, the three Moon Fire Slaves could do nothing but watch the Nihility Spirits surpass them. They had no choice but to extinguish the lamps one by one.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen had entered the second circular area, and the grey marks on his body were automatically settled.
<br><br>
Although the power of the settlement was quite intense, he could still bear it. Besides, he didn't have time to think too much now. The Nihility race would soon catch up.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
He quickly slipped his arm around Elvinia's waist. Lightning flashed on his back, and they flew up in the air in no time.
<br><br>
From the outside, he saw that there was no difference between the grassland in the ring and the one in the south. When they stepped into the ring, however, he found that the grassland there was shrouded in a thick white mist.
<br><br>
Although he knew that he should be wary of the strange white mist, he didn't want to stay at the entrance any longer.
<br><br>
In the next moment, his thunder wings flapped and they flew forward in a straight line.
<br><br>
If there were no obstructions, it would only take a few seconds for him to cover this distance.
<br><br>
"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"
<br><br>
At that point, the thick, milky white mist blocked the two people's eyesight.
<br><br>
Now, Zen had traveled forward for dozens of seconds already. At his speed, he was able to fly back and forth about four times within the area, but he still couldn't pass through the white mist. "What's going on?" Elvinia asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"There's something wrong. We are not moving forward," Zen said with a frown.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid it's not that easy to pass through this area," Elvinia answered and shook her head.
<br><br>
Overall, Elvinia had been an invincible being on the Other Shore ever since she got the body of the purified being. Even the creatures in the Dark Region couldn't do anything to her.
<br><br>
Despite that, the first area of the temple had been so dangerous, let alone the second one.
<br><br>
As a result, she became more curious about the temple.
<br><br>
What kind of civilization had set up such a space and built the temple? What exactly was hidden inside the temple? As for Zen, what he currently thought about was how to pass through the area they were in. He flew forward for a distance, and then descended from the white mist.
<br><br>
He had flown so close to the grass that was a few hundred feet tall. Thus, he should be able to leave the mist very soon if he descended like the way he did now. However, after he came down vertically from a height of over ten thousand feet, the place below him was still covered in white mist. He couldn't get to the bottom.
<br><br>
Of course, Elvinia also realized that there was an endless void below them, and she couldn't help but hold onto Zen more tightly.
<br><br>
Chapter 3602 Help In reality, the white mist was only a huge illusion.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen began to long for the Eye of Will. After all, even if the Eye of Will's power wasn't that strong, the theurgy it had was very useful.
<br><br>
The Authentic Visual World could help him see through almost all illusions, but unfortunately it was burnt when Zen had fought the Evil God.
<br><br>
The second he stopped moving, the white mist behind him surged forward.
<br><br>
The white mist swirled until it formed the shape of a human being. The human-like mist held a large saber in one hand, and hacked towards Zen's head! "Swoosh..."
<br><br>
The white mist had appeared so suddenly that when Zen realized what happened, the saber was already way too close to him.
<br><br>
In a moment of desperation, he subconsciously reached out his hand to protect himself.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The saber's power formed from the white mist was quite sharp. He felt the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body shake violently when it struck his arm, and the impact had caused half of his Chaotic Source Spirits to be consumed! "So powerful!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
In turn, he flew backwards with his arms around Elvinia and kicked the human-shaped mist.
<br><br>
He thought that since the human-shaped mist could execute such a strong saber strike, it must be extraordinarily powerful. He didn't expect that his light kick would cause the human-shaped mist to disperse.
<br><br>
'This is bad!' he thought.
<br><br>
His thunder wings flapped once more, and then he flew half a foot upward.
<br><br>
The human-shaped mist attacked from the other side this time. Luckily, Zen was quick to react, managing to dodge. If the saber hit him again, the Chaotic Source Spirits would most likely get exhausted once more.
<br><br>
When he avoided the second strike, Elvinia also seized the opportunity and quickly grabbed the human-shaped white mist.
<br><br>
At that moment, the human-shaped white mist was destroyed.
<br><br>
The moment the human-shaped mist dissipated, Elvinia immediately yelled, "Zen, up there!"
<br><br>
Since Zen had no time to analyze the situation, he just blindly grabbed above him and crushed the mist once again. But just as the mist dispersed, it escaped from behind! "Clatter, clatter, clatter..."
<br><br>
The human-shaped white mist with the saber repeatedly appeared and disappeared, but Zen and Elvinia didn't stop at all even though they could not communicate.
<br><br>
About five minutes later, the white mist finally disappeared.
<br><br>
Both of them gasped for breath. They had consumed a lot of their physical strengths in their last fight.
<br><br>
"Completely defeated?" Elvinia asked. "I'm not sure," Zen said with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, another three human-shaped mists appeared around them.
<br><br>
Each of them had a different weapon—one had a sword, the other held an axe, and the last one wielded a spear.
<br><br>
Upon seeing them, Elvinia couldn't help but panic on the inside.
<br><br>
One human-shaped mist had already made Zen exhausted. Now, three of them would surely cause him great trouble! Meanwhile, Zen's eyes slightly narrowed into slits as he gently held Elvinia up. In only a few seconds, his body changed and quickly grew two more heads and four more arms! "Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"
<br><br>
The three human-shaped white mists finally pounced towards him. It was true that they were strong and fierce, but their bodies were immediately destroyed the moment he touched them.
<br><br>
Once he had understood their situation, he ignored their weapons and wrecked their bodies before they attacked him! His three heads could see and hear attacks from any direction. To be honest, he had an easier time dealing with the three human-shaped mists now compared to the single human-shaped mist earlier.
<br><br>
Five minutes later, the three human-shaped white mists disappeared again.
<br><br>
But before he could sigh in relief, another nine human-shaped mists appeared! Just like before, all of them held different weapons, such as saber, spear, sword, halberd, axe, and so on.
<br><br>
After he had observed all the weapons in their hands, he thought for a while first.
<br><br>
He thought of the illusion that the Snake Goddess had shown him.
<br><br>
His grandfather, also a member of the human race, was known as the Lord of Weapons, and created the Nine Li race. Therefore, the weapons the human-shaped mists wielded should have also come from the memories of the 77th civilization, which was the human race.
<br><br>
It seemed that the temple nearby was indeed related to the human race! When the nine human-shaped mists appeared, Zen felt the pressure on him increase suddenly.
<br><br>
As for Elvinia, she couldn't help much in fighting the fast and dense attacks.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
An axe was swung out from one side and hit Zen's arm! In return, the Chaotic Source Spirits surged forth, while the Truth of Godly Way quickly began to repair them.
<br><br>
When the Chaotic Source Spirits had just recovered up to eighty percent, a sharp arrow formed from the white mist flew towards him. The Chaotic Source Spirits took the blow once again, and now only thirty percent of their strength was left.
<br><br>
Before the Truth of Godly Way could repair them, another large hammer came down at Zen.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
When the hammer crashed down, his Chaotic Source Spirits were finally worn out. He had only sensed a white light flash at him, which felt like five bolts of lightning had struck him! Even so, he gritted his teeth and avoided the attack of the other humanshaped mists. However, his body trembled and he felt a little weak! "Zen, let go of me!"
<br><br>
As Elvinia watched Zen fight, she decided that she wanted to break free from his grip.
<br><br>
Yet, she couldn't fly. Not only was she useless, but she was also a hindrance to Zen.
<br><br>
However, Zen clearly knew that if he let go of her and let her fight the white mists alone, she would probably die. How could he listen to her request? "Swish!"
<br><br>
He flew and left the area, but several human-shaped white mists followed closely like ghosts. Their attacks were unstoppable! In that case, he could no longer dodge.
<br><br>
Just as the weapons were about to hit him, a red fist mark appeared on the body of each human-shaped white mist.
<br><br>
"Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop..."
<br><br>
The fist marks exploded, and then the human-shaped white mists that surrounded him simultaneously dissipated.
<br><br>
It was not easy to completely kill these human-shaped white mists.
<br><br>
The first time Zen had dealt with one, he had repeatedly killed it for about five minutes before it disappeared forever.
<br><br>
After a while, the white mists that had dispersed reappeared in a second and charged towards him.
<br><br>
"Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop..."
<br><br>
Another nine red fist marks popped up on the chests of the human-shaped mists, and then they were crushed again.
<br><br>
The human-shaped white mists ceaselessly reappeared, and the red fist marks destroyed them over and over again...
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia looked around in surprise. Of course, they wanted to know who helped them.
<br><br>
However, the white mist was too thick to dissolve. Even if the helper was very close, they still couldn't see them! After each of the nine human-shaped white mists was killed a dozen times, they were finally gone for good.
<br><br>
Despite that, Zen and Elvinia didn't feel relieved. After all, both of them saw a red light in the white mist, which became brighter and brighter.
<br><br>
Finally, it emerged out of the white mist and appeared in front of them.
<br><br>
It turned out, that it was one of the two Nihility Spirits of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
"How dare you enter this dangerous place if you can't defeat the fog spirits? You two are quite bold..." soft female voice came from the red ball.
<br><br>
Zen simply frowned and did not refute, as what the Nihility Spirit said was reasonable.
<br><br>
Relying on his powerful physical body and the methods of the purified being, he thought that he could act recklessly in the Dark Region. He explored such a dangerous place without any knowledge. Overall, he was indeed a bit rash.
<br><br>
But, why did the Nihility Spirit save him? Chapter 3603 The Light Zen and Elvinia stood vigilant, facing the approaching Nihility Spirit.
<br><br>
The Nihility Way they followed was strange and made them difficult to predict.
<br><br>
The red ball floated towards Zen and slowly came to a stop. Seeing it this close up, he saw that it was filled with bright red blood.
<br><br>
A shadow in the shape of human became visible in the blood, and it slowly began floating out, stretching an arm through first.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia looked closer to find a piece of white bone.
<br><br>
As the bone left the ball, the blood in it seemed to boil and gather on the bone, turning into meridians and flesh.
<br><br>
One moment the flesh was red and the next it turned white and tender.
<br><br>
Then the skull, neck, chest and ribs emerged from the red ball as well. The blood began turning into the internal organs, eyes, ears, nose and mouth. In no time at all, a woman no less beautiful than Elvinia had materialized.
<br><br>
"I admire your courage very much. You were actually capable of luring the Moon Fire Slaves here. Do you have the Other Shore Key to the temple?"
<br><br>
asked the newly formed human woman. As she spoke, her gaze shifted to Zen's hands. Noticing the lines on his right hand, her eyes flashed as she reached out to grab it.
<br><br>
Zen withdrew his hand lightning fast, remaining wary of this thing before him.
<br><br>
The woman didn't seem bothered. She smiled and said, "There is no need for such caution. We are of the same race."
<br><br>
"We are not of the same race as you!" Elvinia retorted angrily. "You grew from bones!"
<br><br>
The woman froze at these words. She then smiled again and replied, "I may have grown from bones, but I'm still more human than a pig-faced monster."
<br><br>
"You little..." Elvinia burned with rage; she had gained her body from a pigfaced monster.
<br><br>
The human woman ignored Elvinia and got right to the point. "I'll give you two choices. The first is to submit to us and join the Nihility race. Then I'll escort you to the temple," she said to Zen.
<br><br>
She was wise and experienced. She knew they were both purified beings, but they were obviously different from the rest. People like them bared the qualities necessary to join the Nihility race.
<br><br>
"What's the second choice?" Zen asked blankly.
<br><br>
Grinning, she replied, "I'll kill you and destroy you, leaving only your right hand."
<br><br>
Zen's hand held the key to opening the temple. She had saved him and Elvinia for the sake of that hand.
<br><br>
"Few have the chance to join the Nihility race. Being one of us will allow you to see the truth of this world more clearly. What do you think?"
<br><br>
Below her waist were not legs, but a snake tail covered in scales.
<br><br>
Could it be she was of the Snake Goddess race? Zen's heart skipped a beat as he contemplated the relationship between this woman, the human race and the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
Seeing how close the woman was to him, Zen suddenly smiled and replied, "I refuse!"
<br><br>
Immediately, he wildly unleashed the power within his body.
<br><br>
He held nothing back and punched her with all his strength.
<br><br>
Boom! The punch sent a vibration spreading through her bones, turning her flesh into powder.
<br><br>
But to his surprise, her bones were tough enough to take the blow and none was broken.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
The force of the punch sent Zen flying backwards, and he quickly darted into the thick white mist.
<br><br>
The woman's bones returned to the red ball and became nothing more than a blurry figure. A piercing voice erupted from within the ball. "You're dancing with death now!"
<br><br>
The voice was so sharp and powerful that it reached Zen's ears quite clearly.
<br><br>
"What if she catches up?" asked Elvinia worriedly, her eyes wide.
<br><br>
"Do not fear her," Zen replied comfortingly.
<br><br>
Since the woman had descended from an upper stage, her strength had been suppressed as well. It was possible she might not be able to defeat him.
<br><br>
She had defeated the figures in the white mist with ease. But that didn't mean she was strong. All it meant was that she was familiar with this area and had been well prepared.
<br><br>
Moreover, once the figures in the white mist were defeated, they didn't appear again. Zen was not afraid.
<br><br>
As for joining the Nihility race, that was never going to happen.
<br><br>
"The second area is called the Mist Killing Array. I have helped you remove the danger, but you'll have a hard time finding your way out.
<br><br>
It's a great honor to be chosen by our Nihility race.
<br><br>
Why are you refusing me?"
<br><br>
The woman's voice was sultry and hypnotizing.
<br><br>
The souls at Stage Seventeen would certainly be unable to resist.
<br><br>
However, Zen and Elvinia were immune to it; they had absorbed a large amount of soul crystal and had reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul.
<br><br>
"That woman's voice is so annoying," Elvinia complained.
<br><br>
"Our top priority is to find a way out. We seem to be moving in circles,"
<br><br>
Zen said, frowning.
<br><br>
There were no reference points in the white mist, so getting lost and losing a sense of direction were easy.
<br><br>
Elvinia pursed her lips and considered their options. Right now, their resources on the Other Shore were very limited.
<br><br>
"This is not the Dark Region. Your advantages as purified beings are completely useless against us. If you fall into the hands of the Moon Fire Slaves, your end will be much more miserable."
<br><br>
The woman's voice came through the mist.
<br><br>
'The light!' A thought flashed through Elvinia's mind. Quickly, she said, "Light is straight. We can go along the light!"
<br><br>
This area was not large. If they found the right direction, they'd be able to pass through in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
As Elvinia finished speaking, she pinched her hand and flicked forward. A slender and long beam of light shot forward. Even in the vast white mist, the white light was a dazzling substance.
<br><br>
Zen blinked his eyes, a hint of joy on his face. "I didn't think of that. It's worth a try!"
<br><br>
Crack! He flapped the thunder wings on his back, turning into a flash of lightning and flying along the straight light.
<br><br>
Not far away, the light was reflected in space, and a part of it deflected and shot in another direction.
<br><br>
It seemed clear that Zen had gotten lost because something was wrong with this space.
<br><br>
But this time he wouldn't follow the deflected light and instead flew forward in a straight line.
<br><br>
Chapter 3604 No Route Of Retreat Previously, the world around Zen went by in a blur as he flew for a long time and lost his sense of direction.
<br><br>
Now, he found the light that Elvinia had shot did not lead them to the exit of the circular area, but the right side of the said area instead.
<br><br>
As soon as they arrived at the right side, they immediately calculated the direction. As Elvinia gently rubbed her thumb against her forefinger, another ray of light extended into the distance.
<br><br>
This time, Zen flew fast along the ray of light. After a dozen seconds, the pervading white fog no longer surrounded them. It was clear that they had finally passed through.
<br><br>
However, the woman in the red ball didn't expect that Zen would be able to get rid of the Mist Killing Array so soon, so she continued to persuade him.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen did not respond to her. Instead, he left with Elvinia through the exit on one side of the circular ring, then they entered the last area—the flat gobi.
<br><br>
The moment they entered the gobi, Elvinia pointed to the distance and exclaimed, "Zen, look!"
<br><br>
On the other side of the gobi was a huge temple.
<br><br>
In addition, the location of the temple was exactly the same as Zen had predicted before.
<br><br>
As he gazed into the distance, his eyes quickly fell on a statue in front of the temple.
<br><br>
The statue looked tall and sturdy, and was dressed in luxurious clothing. Its face seemed to look confident. Zen had no idea who that was.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
Because the Nihility Spirits were quite familiar with the area, it wouldn't be difficult for them to pass through the Mist Killing Array. Naturally, it would be troublesome if those Nihility Spirits caught up with them.
<br><br>
Judging from how tough it was to pass through the first two areas, Zen was afraid that the gobi area at the end would give them a hard time, too.
<br><br>
Since they had been drawn to the white fog while they flew, Zen and Elvinia decided that it would be best to walk through the gobi.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
The sounds of their footsteps echoed loudly in the empty gobi as they walked forward.
<br><br>
Despite having traveled on foot, they moved quite fast. It was only after a blink of an eye when they arrived at the center of the gobi.
<br><br>
Just as Zen had silently rejoiced about not being in danger anymore, he suddenly felt that the ground beneath him shook.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
A huge footprint suddenly appeared on the ground not far away.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
It wasn't long before a second footprint followed closely after the first one.
<br><br>
There seemed to be a giant transparent beast in front of Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Based from the depth of the footprints, the beast's footsteps could definitely crush and kill anyone it stepped on.
<br><br>
"Step back!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
When he felt a gust of cold wind press down on him, he grabbed Elvinia and abruptly jumped back.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Another huge footprint landed on the area where they had just been. And a chill ran down Elvinia's back when she saw it.
<br><br>
Strangely enough, the footprints stopped appearing when both of them retreated to the first half of the gobi. What was even more strange was that all the footprints in the gobi had vanished. Even the footprints as deep as an abyss were gone as well, and the gobi became flat once again.
<br><br>
"The footprints didn't follow us," said Elvinia.
<br><br>
"There seems to be an invisible giant..." After a moment of thought, Zen said, "You stay here, while I try again!"
<br><br>
If he considered the size of the footprint, then the invisible giant shouldn't be that tall.
<br><br>
He spread his wings and tried to travel through the area in the air.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
When he had reached halfway through, he felt a strong wind blew over his head again.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A huge creature came down from the sky, and then he felt that there was an invisible foot that immediately tried to press him down against the gobi.
<br><br>
With gritted teeth, he quickly twisted his body and shook his thunder wings, then rolled out from the big foot's side.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The second he jumped out, there was another huge footprint on the ground! Swoosh Before he could fully come to his senses, a huge foot had stepped on his head.
<br><br>
His brows knitted in annoyance while he flew forward as fast as he could.
<br><br>
Every time he avoided a huge foot, he tried his best to fly higher. When he ascended a bit, however, a foot pressed down on him again.
<br><br>
He went deeper and deeper, and the invisible feet followed him closely.
<br><br>
It was true that in the beginning, he had guessed that there was a giant in the gobi. Unfortunately, the frequent stomping of the large feet made it clear that there might be hundreds or even a thousand giants that had lined up to trample on him.
<br><br>
As a result, his flying height lowered repeatedly because of the huge feet.
<br><br>
He was afraid that he would be killed if he continued to fly forward with difficulty. Therefore, he stopped and retreated as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Once he had left the area, the invisible feet disappeared, and the densely packed footprints were gone and filled in with the sand from the ground.
<br><br>
Then, he stood next to Elvinia and lamented helplessly, "I'm afraid we can't break through this area."
<br><br>
"I think there must be a way," Elvinia replied and looked around in hopes of finding a clue.
<br><br>
Yet, the whole place was bare. How would they find any clue? "Crack!"
<br><br>
Just then, Zen stepped on the ground with a bit of force. A part of the gobi under his feet shattered.
<br><br>
"I'll try to pass through under the ground," he suggested.
<br><br>
Although he knew that it was almost impossible to do so, he had no choice but to try, especially when they were chased after. Besides, their destination was right in front of their eyes. He would not give up easily.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he heard that soft voice again that said, "Do not be in vain. How can you pass through the energy souls of heaven and earth in this area?"
<br><br>
Two red balls appeared at the gobi's entrance. The woman had been searching for a while in the second area, but she couldn't find Zen. Thus, she went straight into the third area, and saw Zen and Elvinia as soon as she arrived.
<br><br>
The intrusion alerted Zen and Elvinia, and both of them quickly paled at the sight of the two balls. They didn't expect that they would catch up so soon! "I'll give you one last chance. Engrave these two marks into your bodies, and I can treat you as my own people. Otherwise, I can only kill you without mercy!" the woman in the red ball declared.
<br><br>
Right after the woman finished speaking, the blood in the red ball circulated, and two masses of blood floated towards Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Even though Zen didn't know what those masses were, he had a rough guess of what could happen if he absorbed them.
<br><br>
He took a deep breath. There was no way he would submit to the Nihility race, so he would have to fight a hard battle today.
<br><br>
"Kill us without mercy? Are you sure you're even qualified to speak to me in that way when your strength has been suppressed by Stage Seventeen?"
<br><br>
Zen shot back. His body emanated a domineering aura as he spoke intimidatingly.
<br><br>
He knew that it was difficult to deal with Moon Fire Slaves and Nihility Spirits, so he had tried to dodge them when he could. However, things were different when he had no route of retreat.
<br><br>
"It's a pity to kill such a talent..." the woman in the red ball sighed when she felt Zen's aura.
<br><br>
At that point, she said to the Nihility Spirit by her side, "Go ahead. Capture the man alive, while the woman could be killed."
<br><br>
Immediately after, the surface of the two red balls began to fluctuate in circles.
<br><br>
The minute they were about to take action, the Moon Fire Slaves suddenly appeared behind the Nihility Spirits. As soon as No. 13 arrived at the gobi, his huge body suddenly turned around and crushed a Nihility Spirit under his feet.
<br><br>
Boom! The conflict between the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race was unresolvable. They were mortal enemies. Of course, they would not hold back in each other's presence.
<br><br>
Chapter 3605 Negotiation The second No. 13 stepped on the Nihility Spirit, the green flames within his body streamed downward along his legs until they flowed onto the Nihility Spirit beneath his feet.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
The green flames covered the surface of the red ball, effectively corroding it.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves were created by the fire spirits of the Element Spirit race. The green flames that formed the Moon Fire Slaves' bodies were called the "Magical Star Flame". The fire spirits of the Element Spirit race had a great control over the flames, and the Magical Star Flame could be considered to be the embodiment of the fire spirits' greatest achievement.
<br><br>
Although the power of the Moon Fire Slaves was suppressed in Stage Seventeen, the power of the Magical Star Flame could not be underestimated.
<br><br>
"Burn it to ashes. Ha-ha..." No. 13 pressed his heel down firmly on the red ball, and the green flames continued to pour forth.
<br><br>
Although the surface of the red ball sizzled and sputtered under the heat of the Magical Star Flames, its inside remained intact.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Everyone present exchanged confused glances at the sound of three buzzes from within the red ball.
<br><br>
"Splash!"
<br><br>
A column of blood shot out from the red ball. The blood spurted out violently, and it formed the shape of a huge, bloody hand. Grabbing No. 13, it raised him high and smashed him downwards so hard that the ground shook.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Every time No. 13 was smashed into the ground, pieces of his armor fell off one by one. Gradually, the green flames within his body began to sputter out.
<br><br>
No. 14, who was following closely behind, rushed towards the red ball as he screamed at the top of his lungs.
<br><br>
However, before No. 14 could even get close, another column of blood shot out from the red ball, also forming a giant hand. The hand grabbed No. 14 before he even had the time to think. He too was being smashed violently into the ground.
<br><br>
The two Moon Fire Slaves collided in a heaping mess of destroyed armor and deformed green flames.
<br><br>
Even though the Moon Fire Slaves couldn't be hurt so easily, the energy of their spiritual cores was being exhausted as they were being smashed to a pulp. If this kept up, they would return to the state of the spiritual cores...
<br><br>
As for the spiritual core of the Moon Fire Slave, it was difficult for ordinary Other Shore creatures to destroy it. In fact, these Moon Fire Slaves had died many times before and turned into the spiritual cores; time and time again, they were rescued by the Element Spirit race, returning to their original state.
<br><br>
However, the Nihility race had a way to completely destroy the spiritual cores.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom..."
<br><br>
Just as the green flames on the bodies of the two Moon Fire Slaves were about to die out completely, a deep voice suddenly roared, "Stop!"
<br><br>
No. 12 held up a red ball in his hand. Twelve Magical Star Flames with different shapes hovered next to him. Each Magical Star Flame had a thin thread of fire drawn out, forming a unique array.
<br><br>
This magic array was the Magical Explosion Array–one of the most powerful methods of the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
While No. 13 and No. 14 fought this Nihility Spirit, No. 12 had been busy subduing another one. Just when No. 12 was about to finish off his opponent, he saw that his two subordinates were in grave danger.
<br><br>
Left with no other choices, he took the subdued Nihility Spirit as a hostage.
<br><br>
If No. 12's Magical Explosion Array exploded, even the red ball wouldn't be able to protect the creature within.
<br><br>
"Let her out of the array, and I'll stop." An enchanting feminine voice echoed from the ball that was holding the two Moon Fire Slaves with bloody hands. It was the same woman who had saved Zen before.
<br><br>
With a slight nod from No. 12, the twelve Magical Star Flames were absorbed back into his body. Gently, he tossed the red ball onto the ground.
<br><br>
Similarly, the two bloody hands released the two Moon Fire Slaves, and receded back into the red ball.
<br><br>
A skeleton emerged from the inside of the red ball that had just attacked the Moon Fire Slaves. It looked relatively unharmed, but upon a closer look, some grey scars could be seen on it.
<br><br>
"What a pity..."
<br><br>
Zen shook his head in disappointment. He didn't like how this scene was playing out.
<br><br>
If both sides had gotten terribly injured, this would've been a good thing.
<br><br>
Conversely, if they stopped fighting with each other, this was bad news for Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
As flesh and blood congealed on the skeleton, slowly, the figure of a human woman was formed. The other Nihility Spirit that had just been held hostage quickly retreated behind the woman. "If you want to settle this," the human woman said coldly, "we would love to oblige you."
<br><br>
The Nihility race and the Element Spirit race had been at war for the longest time. Most of the time, the Element Spirit race had the upper hand.
<br><br>
They were usually able to subdue the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Even so, the Nihility race had never backed off. To a certain extent, the Element Spirit race had no way of completely finishing off the Nihility race.
<br><br>
No. 12 looked at the human woman coldly. "Sadly, I'm not in the mood to destroy you right now. My only goal is to catch that guy and take him back.
<br><br>
It has nothing to do with you!" he said, eyes narrowing, It was through the Elephant Man race that the Moon Fire Slaves knew about Zen's possession of the Other Shore Key. No. 12 thought that the Nihility race knew nothing of this, so he was hoping he could divert the Nihility Spirits' attention from Zen.
<br><br>
"True, you catching him might have nothing to do with us," the human woman smiled slyly. "But he has the key to the temple, which has a great deal to do with us!"
<br><br>
No. 12's expression darkened.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, he said, "Since everyone's goal is to get to the temple, why not we join forces for now? We can put our prior disagreements aside for the time being, and open the temple first."
<br><br>
The three forces had spent a lot of time and energy in trying to open up this temple. Finally, the Other Shore Key was within reach, so how could they possibly let go of this opportunity? "That's right. Just get that guy's hand first," No. 14 chipped in.
<br><br>
Just minutes ago, No. 13 and No. 14 had been badly beaten by the human woman. By now, they had replenished some star dust, enough for them to recover. The green flames that were sputtering out were now much more dense and lively.
<br><br>
"Of course we will get that hand," another Nihility Spirit said.
<br><br>
"Humph! Whoever gets it can possess it!"
<br><br>
No. 14 was the closest to Zen.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly strode towards Zen.
<br><br>
"Knock, knock, knock..."
<br><br>
Zen had been listening to their conversation. Hearing them discuss as though he were already dead made him furious. As No. 14 headed towards him, a trace of killing intent flashed in Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
The chances of him winning against two powerful races were incredibly slim.
<br><br>
However, it just so happened that these two races were mortal enemies. He could use this against them and fight them with all his might.
<br><br>
Just as No. 14 was a few steps away from him, the Wild God Power within Zen's body suddenly erupted.
<br><br>
Chapter 3606 A Safe Path Previously, the Moon Fire Slaves had to make their bodies smaller and compact in order for them to pass through the first area.
<br><br>
As soon as they arrived at the second area, their height of several hundred feet was quickly restored.
<br><br>
No. 14 had a very simple and straightforward idea. He had planned on defeating Zen using sheer and brute strength. Afterwards, he would cut off Zen's arm that recorded the Other Shore Key.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves were known as the Element Spirit race's slaves.
<br><br>
Despite that fact, they still disdained and belittled the ants in the lower stages.
<br><br>
However, things took an unexpected turn as soon as No. 14 sped toward Zen. He noticed that Zen's body started to expand. Out of nowhere, one of his hands grabbed the Moon Fire Slave by his shoulder and threw a punch toward his chest with the other.
<br><br>
"Unbelievable! His hand..."
<br><br>
At this point, No. 14 had forgotten to defend himself. He was utterly dumbfounded as he stared at Zen's hand in disbelief.
<br><br>
The armor of No. 14 became instantly disjointed around the shoulder area.
<br><br>
As Zen extended his hand further, it sank even deeper into the Moon Fire Slave's shoulder. It was entirely enveloped by the Magical Star Flames emanating from within his body.
<br><br>
Everything would be reduced to ashes as soon as it came into contact with the Magical Star Flames within his body.
<br><br>
However, Zen's hand remained safe and intact! He couldn't quite understand how Zen managed to touch his body without getting burned.
<br><br>
While No. 14 was still completely bewildered, Zen had thrown another powerful punch toward his chest.
<br><br>
Boom! The punch landed with a sickening crunch. The armor on No. 14's back completely fell apart and got blown off. Upon impact with Zen's fist, the Magical Star Flames inside No. 14's body turned into a column of fire that spurted out from his back. At the same time, his spiritual core also shot out.
<br><br>
It was almost impossible to break the spiritual core with brute force. This showed how much strength there was behind Zen's attack.
<br><br>
Once the spiritual core left the Moon Fire Slave's body, the body would ultimately collapse.
<br><br>
Splash! No. 14's armor had scattered all over the ground. There were flames flowing everywhere. All that was left of his existence were bits of shattered armor pieces, flames, and his spiritual core.
<br><br>
He had already collapsed before in the annular desert area wherein a large amount of stardust was consumed before he had recovered. And now, he had collapsed once more under the might of Zen's blow.
<br><br>
The Magical Star Flames flooded the ground and were gushing everywhere.
<br><br>
Because of this, Elvinia was forced to fall back.
<br><br>
While she was retreating, she felt utterly astounded at what she had witnessed.
<br><br>
She had no doubt that Zen would be able to hold out against a Moon Fire Slave. However, she knew it wouldn't be that simple. How was he able to defeat him with just a punch? Meanwhile, Zen himself was a little confused as well. He was surprised at how he managed to put a lot of damage to the Moon Fire Slave.
<br><br>
It was well-known that the most important thing in the body of the Moon Fire Slave was the spiritual core.
<br><br>
With that said, the spiritual core was usually wrapped in the Magical Star Flames. When battling a Moon Fire Slave, there were very few opponents who dared to penetrate the Magical Star Flames and take the spiritual core away, because if they did, they would definitely get burned to a crisp.
<br><br>
When facing some formidable opponents, the Moon Fire Slaves would allow their spiritual cores to wander constantly all throughout their bodies.
<br><br>
They would not let the most important part of their bodies stay in the same place all the time.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, No. 14 was reckless. It never crossed his mind that Zen could become that huge and wouldn't be afraid of the Magical Star Flames.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Da! Da! Da! The spiritual core flew for a few miles and fell directly on the gobi. It rolled directly in front of No. 12.
<br><br>
"I have the Other Shore Key right here. Who else dares to take my hand away?" Zen said coldly as soon as he came to his senses.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves and the Nihility race were maintaining a balance.
<br><br>
Zen had to let them know that it wasn't that easy to take him down. If they lost, they would be devoured by their opponents.
<br><br>
No. 12 bent down and took the spiritual core in his hands. He looked perplexed as he gazed at Zen.
<br><br>
The woman inside the red ball also frowned. It seemed incredulous to her that Zen was able to kill a Moon Fire Slave with just a single punch. Zen's actual strength was really way beyond her expectations.
<br><br>
If she decided to attack him, the two other Moon Fire Slaves would surely take action immediately as well.
<br><br>
After weighing out the stakes, the woman broke into a smile. "I have to admit, I was very much mistaken. You are indeed very powerful. Who else will dare to take your hand? I think it is better if we go through this dangerous place and open the temple together. What do you think?"
<br><br>
No. 12 remained silent. He was fully aware of their current risky situation.
<br><br>
The three parties still had the power to fight each other. Eventually, only one party would benefit from this.
<br><br>
Their best option was to avoid any unnecessary battles and just open the temple together.
<br><br>
"Humph!"
<br><br>
Zen grunted begrudgingly.
<br><br>
He decided to come and open the temple because he wanted to go inside it with Elvinia.
<br><br>
However, he had not foreseen that the temple had already been targeted by the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race. It was clear that this temple was very important.
<br><br>
Zen disliked the idea of the Moon Fire Slaves and Nihility Spirits getting inside the temple.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the woman was quite patient. She waited calmly for Zen's answer.
<br><br>
Given the strength that Zen had displayed, he was truly qualified to become the third force of this place. However, he had no other choice. He had to agree to her suggestion.
<br><br>
"Hmm. Since you don't decline my offer right away, it means you are agreeing to my suggestion. Well then, let's just bury the hatchet and become allies," said the woman as she withdrew inside her red ball again.
<br><br>
The two Nihility Spirits began slowly drifting towards the center of the gobi and led the way.
<br><br>
After putting away No. 14's spiritual core, No. 12 glanced once again at Zen. Afterwards, he walked off together with No. 13.
<br><br>
Zen knew that it was difficult to escape this situation now. Nevertheless, he had no intention of escaping. He really wanted to open the temple. In addition to that, with the Nihility Spirits and the Moon Fire Slaves leading the way, he knew it would be much easier to pass through the gobi.
<br><br>
As soon as the red balls arrived at the center of the gobi, they halted and the woman came out again.
<br><br>
She stretched out her hand. Then, she gently and cautiously probed the air ahead of her. As her soft fingertips touched a certain area, the space in front of her became distorted. Instantaneously, an invisible force left a huge footprint in the middle of the gobi.
<br><br>
Boom! The footprint appeared right in front of her. It was only a few inches away from where she stood.
<br><br>
"The energy soul of heaven and earth is very powerful. Once it is formed, it will be indestructible for a very long time. Many of the temples found in Stage Thirty-one are guarded by it," explained the woman.
<br><br>
It seemed like she was saying this to Zen.
<br><br>
"However, it also has a huge flaw. Anyone who enters it will be attacked indiscriminately," added the woman as she slowly opened her hand and gently blew on it. As she did this, a blood red mist gradually dispersed from her palm.
<br><br>
The mist contained a faint energy. As soon as the mist drifted forward to the distorted space, a strange scene occurred.
<br><br>
Huge invisible feet stomped down from above and began attacking the blood mist.
<br><br>
However, the blood mist was formless. Therefore, the huge feet weren't able to damage it all.
<br><br>
"This area is heavily guarded by the energy soul of heaven and earth. In any case, there should be a path around here that would allow us to safely pass through it. The path avoids all the attacks of the energy soul. Normally, it can't be seen clearly by the naked eye. But while the energy soul is attacking the blood mist, we will be able to see it," she continued.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! As the attacks continued, the blood mist was able to outline the countless footprints that appeared beneath it.
<br><br>
Among these seemingly messy footprints, a winding path was exposed.
<br><br>
There were no giant footprints along this path. Obviously, this was what the woman had mentioned earlier.
<br><br>
Chapter 3607 Meeting Chiyou's Statue Again Zen couldn't help the burst of admiration that flooded his heart as he stared at the path flanked by countless footprints.
<br><br>
If the red mist hadn't lured out all these footprints, he would've never seen it.
<br><br>
The human woman whispered something to another red ball and Zen watched it zoom straight onto the path.
<br><br>
"This way please," she said to him with a smile.
<br><br>
The path was winding and zigzag. If she entered first, Zen might flee behind her. There was also the possibility of the Moon Fire Slaves abducting him.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia looked at each other with alert, but they still stepped on the path in silence.
<br><br>
The human woman originally wanted to walk behind Zen and Elvinia but No. 12 beat her to it, shrinking his body and situating himself behind them.
<br><br>
The fight had ceased on the three sides but they still remained on guard against each other.
<br><br>
Since it didn't really matter, the human woman chose to just let it be and settled herself at the very back.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Thunderous footsteps echoed around them as invisible feet stomped on both sides of the path, trampling the gobi into pieces and only leaving the path they were walking on intact.
<br><br>
This winding path wasn't long and with the red ball leading them, they were able to pass through in just about three minutes.
<br><br>
As the human woman walked out of the path, she drilled out the red ball, placed her palm on her lips, and sucked in the air.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh All the red fog got sucked into her mouth! When it disappeared, the energy soul stopped attacking and the messy gobi resumed its original form as if nothing happened at all.
<br><br>
"You can open the temple now," the woman said to Zen indifferently.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and walked towards the temple gates.
<br><br>
The temple wasn't small by any means. Zen considered it very large in comparison to the ones he'd seen.
<br><br>
As he stared at the gates, he couldn't help but gasp in shock.
<br><br>
A huge part of the gates had been charred! Not only that, but there were also numerous scratches and irreparable damage on both sides of the gates.
<br><br>
A lot of effort had gone towards opening the gates, Zen had no doubt about that.
<br><br>
"Is the temple so impenetrable?" he asked. The damage it had taken was dire but it didn't look as if it yielded at all. "None of you can open it?"
<br><br>
As far as Zen knew, destroying a temple shouldn't be that hard. The Grand Sky Temple in Stage Thirteen, for example, could definitely be opened with brute force if he was given enough time. Was this temple before him different then? After all, many powerful masters had descended from higher stages, trying to open it before.
<br><br>
These masters came with their own methods, and it couldn't be that none of them ever succeeded.
<br><br>
Zen's question was ignored by the Moon Fire Slaves but the human woman smiled. "Of course nobody could open it. What's the point in waiting for you then if it could be easily opened?" she replied. "Many people have perished in trying to destroy this temple. A Spirit King even met his end here."
<br><br>
Back then, a Spirit King from the Element Spirit race had come to Stage Seventeen. At that time, the race had personally brought a purified being into this place in hopes of invading the temple.
<br><br>
Both the Spirit King and the purified being died in the end.
<br><br>
This piece of news was top secret within the Element Spirit race and the human woman overheard it through a special channel. Now, she wanted to seize the chance to verify it from the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
After all, the death of a Spirit King was a horrible loss to the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
"Cut the crap and open the temple!" one Moon Fire Slave snapped, glaring at her coldly.
<br><br>
She let the attitude pass and continued to talk to Zen. "This temple is extremely sturdy but that's not the only reason why people can't enter. It is, in fact, possible to destroy it but doing so will incite calamity and destruction upon those who try."
<br><br>
A trace of fear crossed her features as she recalled what happened when the Nihility race had tried to get inside the temple.
<br><br>
She had been an ordinary member of the Nihility race back then. Though she didn't have a high position, she was present in their attempt to invade the temple and witnessed the instant death of all the elites who were there.
<br><br>
Zen nodded, taking her words to heart. There was definitely a reason why the temple stood here for countless years.
<br><br>
As he walked to the gates, Zen could see a square stone that protruded in the center of them, engraved with stripes that corresponded to the lines on his palm.
<br><br>
It was a peculiar feeling, finding the key to a door that had long since been unopened. The temple had been closed-off for countless years but now its secrets would finally be revealed. It was understandable for the Moon Fire Slaves and the human woman to be anxious.
<br><br>
"Elvinia, stay close to me," Zen muttered in a low voice.
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded and quietly moved closer to him.
<br><br>
Nobody knew what waited for them inside but Zen knew that his life would only be valuable before he opened the gates. Once that was done, the temporary balance between them would break and chaos could ensue. They had to be on guard for this.
<br><br>
With a deep breath, Zen stretched out his hand and pressed it upon the square stone.
<br><br>
It was a perfect fit! Buzz...
<br><br>
A ray of blue light suddenly emerged from the stone, extending along the entire surface of the gates.
<br><br>
His arm tightened on the stone and the gates let out a dull sound.
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! As the gates opened, the Moon Fire Slaves and that human woman took a step back.
<br><br>
That step back had been necessary because of the heavy wave of killing intent that suddenly washed over them. Although Zen had used the Other Shore Key to open the gates, they remained on high alert.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, felt no fear. He didn't even bother assessing the situation before grabbing Elvinia and heading straight inside.
<br><br>
The temple was dark but the moment they stepped inside, golden dots of light appeared like fireflies and illuminated their way.
<br><br>
As these dots of light appeared, numerous candles also lit up and illuminated the entire hall.
<br><br>
Around forty statues stood in front of them, most were human-shaped but a few were of strange forms. Zen's eyes were immediately fixed on the sixth statue from the left.
<br><br>
This statue had a human body and a snake tail. It was a member of the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
It wasn't surprising to find this statue in a human race's temple since both races were related by blood.
<br><br>
However, the statue in front of them looked exactly like the Snake Goddess Zen had met in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Seeing the Snake Goddess's statue here was one thing but the one next to it confused Zen even more. There, in full-glory with three heads and six arms, stood Chiyou's statue.
<br><br>
Chapter 3608 A Powerful Statue Although Zen had seen Chiyou's statue for many times, he had only seen Chiyou once.
<br><br>
The Chiyou statue in front of him now was no different from those he had already seen before.
<br><br>
'Now that both the Snake Goddess' and Chiyou's statues are here, does that mean Fuxi's and the Eastern Emperor's will be here as well?' As Zen thought about this, Elvinia gently tugged at his sleeve. Her eyes never left the statues, but it seemed as if she was focused on one of them— the statue that half knelt on the ground, with a sword in hand that pierced the ground. It was a statue of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
"Why...Why is Father's statue here?" Elvinia asked in a hushed tone.
<br><br>
Zen squinted his eyes as he scanned through the statues before him. For everything to make sense, the Divine Farmer's and the Yellow Thearch's statues should have been present too. However, Zen had never seen them in person, so he could only wonder if their statues were here.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid that the statue is not of Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself," Zen told Elvinia.
<br><br>
"It's not Father?" Elvinia asked, unconvinced that the statue was not her father.
<br><br>
"Right." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
Since the Snake Goddess was willing to give Zen the Six-Pattern Bloodstoring Seed, she did not know of the Other Shore Key in the seed, which also meant that she had no clue about the existence of this temple either.
<br><br>
It was likely that the temple had stood there for such a long time, that it had survived through a thousand chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Naturally, it was impossible for Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Chiyou, Fuxi, or even the Snake Goddess, to set up their statues here inside this particular temple.
<br><br>
"If this is not Father, who could it possibly be?" Elvinia questioned, "What on earth is up with this temple?"
<br><br>
She did not understand the origin of this round of chaos, leaving her pretty much in the dark to what was happening.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Zen had learned a handful about the Other Shore and the chaotic eras from No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit. Aside from this, he had also studied the origin of human beings from the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
In fact, the human beings in the current round of the chaotic era, should not have existed at all. The fact was that they had been secretly and strategically placed there by the human beings from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess explained all of this to him, Zen couldn't help but have too many questions.
<br><br>
Why was the Snake Goddess born to be the Snake Goddess in the first place? Why was Fuxi born to be Fuxi? Moreover, why were the Yellow Thearch, the Divine Farmer, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Chiyou, and so on born to be themselves? When Zen saw the statues standing in the hall, he suddenly had answers to all of his questions. It all made sense.
<br><br>
What he understood was that the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others had already existed in times of the 77th civilization. During that time, they were top masters of that era. But before they had finished the Finale Way, all of them entered the Other Shore and became human beings on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
So when the seeds of humans were planted into the new round of chaos, it was most likely that they had prioritized their own clones.
<br><br>
The clones were born to have powerful bloodlines, which was what made them so precious. This was why the Snake Goddess founded Pear Hill, why the Yellow Emperor founded the Bearing race, and why Eastern Emperor Taiyi had won over all those humans in the world alone with a sword just to found the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid the Eastern Emperor Taiyi here is the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi." Zen gestured at the statue. "While your father might be his clone."
<br><br>
Zen was quite sure at this point, that this was the explanation for what happened.
<br><br>
"How could that be possible?"
<br><br>
Just as Elvinia was about to ask more questions, the Moon Fire Slaves and the Nihility Spirits also rushed into the temple to see the statues for themselves.
<br><br>
"I can't believe the temple was opened so easily!" said the human woman from the Nihility race, with shock in her tone.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang, bang..."
<br><br>
Just then, No. 12 Moon Fire Slave entered and headed straight towards the center of the hall without speaking a word.
<br><br>
"Did you think you were quick?" the human woman sneered at the Moon Fire Slave. With just a wave of her hand, the blood in the red ball quickly solidified and turned into a chain that she swung towards No.12.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
As the chain rolled out at around a dozen feet, No. 13 stepped on it as if it were nothing. However, as if the chain were a living creature, it wrapped itself around No. 13's body and tightened its grip.
<br><br>
A sharp pain went through No. 13's body and he winced in agony. While this was ongoing, No. 12 had arrived at the center of the hall.
<br><br>
At the center of the hall stood an independent statue that resembled the one outside the temple. This statue looked down onto the square stone platform in front of it, over where a blue book was floating.
<br><br>
Since Zen and Elvinia had entered the temple, their attention did not ever leave the statues. Because of this, they had completely disregarded the floating book that No. 12 had come for.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
No. 12 chuckled, sending out a cold expression.
<br><br>
He did not realize the value of the entire temple like the Element Spirit race did.
<br><br>
But No. 12 knew that bringing back something so valuable would get him promoted immediately. It was very likely that his status would jump from No. 12 to No.1.
<br><br>
But just as the Moon Fire Slave reached out to grab the book, the statue that had been reading it suddenly raised its head.
<br><br>
The statue took a long look at the Moon Fire Slave, and then a confused expression spread across its face. "This temple could only be opened by a human being," the statue said. "How could you enter here?"
<br><br>
"That...is none of your business!"
<br><br>
said No. 12, as he stretched out his hand to slap the statue. One slap could send a statue to pieces.
<br><br>
However, No. 12 failed to recall the similar statue that stood outside the temple.
<br><br>
If the statue could be destroyed so easily, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race would have shattered it by now. However, the one outside still stood firm and undamaged.
<br><br>
When No. 12 lifted his hand to slap the statue, the statue smiled. It then stretched out its finger and lightly tapped in the air.
<br><br>
"Pop!"
<br><br>
Just like that, a cracking noise echoed from inside the hall.
<br><br>
No. 12's tall and sturdy body stiffened in fright.
<br><br>
A spiritual core rolled out from his right shoulder, which turned into powder as it rolled down.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
The spiritual core was broken, which meant that the Moon Fire Slave was completely destroyed.
<br><br>
His flaming body evaporated, leaving his armor clamoring as it fell to the ground.
<br><br>
"The spiritual core? The spiritual core is broken?" No. 13 that was watching their exchange couldn't help but be frightened.
<br><br>
Historically, it was very difficult to kill a Moon Fire Slave.
<br><br>
This was because their spiritual cores could not be destroyed just by ordinary means.
<br><br>
The perfect example of this would be No. 14, who had "died" twice yet could revive himself with star dust.
<br><br>
It was notable that the statue killed No. 12 so easily.
<br><br>
But the statue didn't stop the killing after getting rid of No. 12. "Alien races are not allowed to enter the temple," it muttered.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Suddenly, two invisible beams of light emerged from its fingers.
<br><br>
As much as No. 13 wanted to run away, he did not have enough time to do so. The light pierced through his body and shattered the spiritual core inside. The Magical Star Flame that formed his body immediately extinguished.
<br><br>
At the same time, another beam of light shot right into the body of a Nihility Spirit that was close by.
<br><br>
Chapter 3609 Test Aside from the Nihility Spirit being actually strong, the red ball that was wrapped around their body was also extremely powerful.
<br><br>
However, that ray of light which possessed an immense penetrating power, had actually pierced through it without any problems! "Phew!"
<br><br>
Once the ray of light punctured the red ball, the red ball broke like a water tank and its shattered pieces flew in all directions.
<br><br>
Bright red blood gushed out next, and inside the red ball floated a strangely shaped skeleton. The skeleton clearly was not in the human form.
<br><br>
"Jazlene!" the human woman screamed.
<br><br>
She was utterly shocked when she saw that her companion was killed so suddenly.
<br><br>
Based from what the statue said, Zen understood that only humans were allowed to enter the temple. In addition, the statue was highly goal-oriented and clearly knew its targets. At first it killed No. 12, and then No. 13, and finally that Nihility Spirit.
<br><br>
As for this human woman, she was probably related to the human race.
<br><br>
Specifically, she was most likely a member of the Snake Goddess race, so the statue did not attack her.
<br><br>
Despite that, she remained frozen at her spot and didn't dare to move at all.
<br><br>
Even Zen and Elvinia were stunned when the statue's fingers released those rays of light. They thought that the statue that stood in the middle of the hall was a real one made of stone. How could it be a sentient being with such great power? The stone statue raised its head to look at Zen, Elvinia, and the human woman. "I thought it was the inheritors of the thirty-nine heroes who came, but I didn't expect that none of you are any of them," the statue said in an aloof voice.
<br><br>
At the words "thirty-nine heroes," the human woman's vision darkened slightly, while Elvinia was confused, and Zen's eyes flashed.
<br><br>
Zen had counted all the statues and there were exactly thirty-nine of them.
<br><br>
"Master!" he exclaimed. Then, he quickly cupped his hands towards the statue.
<br><br>
"Don't call me master," the statue shook its head. "I'm just a soul puppet who can only follow the orders of my former master," he added.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, such a puppet only had a small memory of its former master. In addition, it was considered inferior to a soul fragment like No.
<br><br>
9527.
<br><br>
Its eyes stared at the human woman as it continued, "That is why even I know that she is a traitor, I can't do anything to her."
<br><br>
The human woman had been very nervous. She originally came from the human race, but she betrayed them and joined the Nihility race. Naturally, she was afraid that the statue would eliminate her. When she heard the statue's words just now, she immediately sighed in relief.
<br><br>
"She has a human body but a tail of a snake. Can she even be considered a human?" Elvinia huffed. She was not convinced.
<br><br>
In the Source World, the Snake Goddess race in the Pear Hill were not humans, but they were closely related to the human race. Furthermore, there was a considerable number of humans who lived in the Pear Hill, including the Human Sovereign, Fuxi.
<br><br>
Therefore, they were still considered a human force most of the time.
<br><br>
"The Snake Goddess has the same origin as humans, so of course she could be considered a human," the statue said calmly.
<br><br>
After the statue was finished, Zen continued to ask, "Are the thirty-nine heroes you mentioned the masters of the thirty-nine statues in this hall?"
<br><br>
"Yes," the statue nodded. "Are they still alive on the Other Shore?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
He had previously promised King Manard that he would help him search for the human race on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In theory, the Other Shore human race should exist on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After all, they were the one who had spread the seeds of the human race in the present chaotic era.
<br><br>
"Of course they are," the statue answered confidently as it eyed the human woman, then added, "Your Nihility race have been looking for them for a long time. Unfortunately, you haven't found anything so far, right?"
<br><br>
The human woman remained silent.
<br><br>
Ever since she had joined the Nihility race, she had chosen a path that she was completely uncertain of.
<br><br>
In any case, there was no right or wrong when it came to choosing among the Purge Way, the Finale Way, and the Nihility Way.
<br><br>
It was just that different people chose different ways to follow in order to pursue the goal they wanted to achieve.
<br><br>
She had her own pursuit, and that was why she stood on the opposite side of the human race in the end.
<br><br>
"Can you tell me where they are now?" Zen asked again. This time, the human woman said, "Of course, they remain hidden on Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
How can they have a foothold elsewhere? The metal spirits, wood spirits, water spirits, fire spirits and earth spirits would never let the human race have an easy life."
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race was known as the most powerful civilization on the Other Shore. They opposed the human race and even many other civilizations. Most civilizations hid on the Other Shore. What happened after they had climbed up and reached the Stage Thirty-three was either they chose to endure, or to submit.
<br><br>
"Although the Element Spirit Civilization is powerful, how can it be that strong? There are still other powerful civilizations on the upper stages," Zen said with a frown.
<br><br>
Even if the Element Spirit Civilization was the strongest civilization on the Other Shore, there were over a thousand other ruling civilizations, large or small, that existed in the same place as them. Besides, although some civilizations had disappeared or hidden like the Regal Jade Civilization, they wouldn't possibly let the Element Spirit Civilization monopolize the Other Shore.
<br><br>
According to the information the Regal Jade Spirit had given, all of the ten great civilizations were exceptional.
<br><br>
A small smile graced the human woman's face, as if she meant to mock Zen's ignorance. "What you just said was the situation a long time ago.
<br><br>
Indeed, that was the case hundreds of chaotic eras ago--but now, there are only a few forces that can contend against them. And we, the Nihility race, are one of them. You can consider joining us," she suggested.
<br><br>
When Zen had killed a Moon Fire Slave, she was very impressed and that aroused her interest in him.
<br><br>
"There are only a few that can contend against them..." Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Suddenly, his gaze froze.
<br><br>
"Yes, the other civilizations are either forced to join the Blood Assembly, or have completely disappeared from the Other Shore," the human woman said with a nod.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization had hidden on Stage Thirteen for a long time, and the situation on the upper stages of the Other Shore had undergone drastic changes within the span of these hundreds of chaotic eras. Thus, the real situation now was plainly different from what Zen had known.
<br><br>
The current Element Spirit race was even stronger than what Zen and the Regal Jade Spirit had imagined.
<br><br>
In the same way, the power of the Nihility race was no longer what it used to be. It had become one of the few big races that could fight against the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
The statue just listened nonchalantly to the conversation between the human woman and Zen.
<br><br>
Once the human woman was finished speaking, it said, "Of course I know of the heroes' whereabouts, but if you want to know, I will tell you when you pass through there."
<br><br>
Then, it pointed towards the ground not far away.
<br><br>
A starry pattern appeared on the ground. There was a faint space fluctuation in the pattern, as if it was another world. "Is this a test?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," the statue said with a smile. "The human race had built the Creation Myth Temple with all their might and resources. Those who have betrayed our race may not be able to pass the test so easily," it explained.
<br><br>
Up until now, Zen didn't know why the human race had hidden the Other Shore Key in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, but they might have their own plans.
<br><br>
It would be too simple and laid-back if the temple recognized any human who appeared in this place.
<br><br>
Therefore, he wasn't surprised that there would be a test.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
He obviously wasn't afraid of the test the Creation Myth Temple had given.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elvinia followed him without hesitation.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the woman from the Nihility race only looked at the starry pattern not far away, her eyes filled with doubt.
<br><br>
She wasn't sure if the statue said that to threaten her or just to frighten her. It was easy for her to enter recklessly, but if she wanted to leave safely, perhaps it wouldn't be that easy.
<br><br>
Chapter 3610 The Orexis Test The human woman only hesitated for a moment before she finally made her decision.
<br><br>
This temple was the last fortress of the human race. It had stood on Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore for so many years, and was never once explored. Naturally, she would never let go of such a rare opportunity! She gently nudged forward from inside of the red ball. Her snake tail swayed as she followed closely behind Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Now, Zen was the first one to step on the starry pattern.
<br><br>
The pattern appeared to be made of some kind of thick mercury. When he stepped on it, the pattern suddenly flashed a beam of starlight, which immediately consumed him.
<br><br>
"Zen!" Elvinia shouted.
<br><br>
Without thinking twice, she quickly followed him and jumped into the starry pattern. Like Zen, she also disappeared inside the mysterious starlight.
<br><br>
The last who went in was the woman, the human betrayer.
<br><br>
After the starlight had swallowed Zen, he looked around and found himself in a totally different space.
<br><br>
Countless dots of light continuously fell down on him.
<br><br>
A seemingly infinite number of stars illuminated the sky and formed a silver stream of light.
<br><br>
Back then, he had once marveled at the beautiful starlight in his father's universe. However, the stars in his father's inner world paled in comparison to the current scenery in front of him. The number of stars above him was way beyond anyone could count.
<br><br>
Stars fell from the sky, flew past the corner of his eye, then began to disappear from his view.
<br><br>
It wasn't until he heard the whistle of the wind that he realized what was really going on. The stars weren't actually flying away from him, but rather, he was falling down fast.
<br><br>
Below him was a huge continent that was shrouded in the darkness. It was originally as small as a hand in his eyes, but as he kept falling down, it rapidly expanded and the expanse of its territory became increasingly clear to him. Soon enough, a vast land appeared beneath him.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he remembered that he was getting closer and closer to the ground.
<br><br>
"I need to brace for impact!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
Almost subconsciously, he attempted to fly up into the air.
<br><br>
"Rise!"
<br><br>
"Thunder Materialization!"
<br><br>
"Wind ..."
<br><br>
He used several methods in a row, but none of them worked to slow down his speed.
<br><br>
It seemed that his theurgies were useless in this space.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to hit the ground, an invisible force cushioned him from behind, then slowly and gently eased him down.
<br><br>
Once he had landed, he got up from the ground and examined the state of his body first.
<br><br>
"My inner world is gone?!"
<br><br>
"No. 9527! Master Regal Jade! Can you hear me?"
<br><br>
"I can't even use my Chaotic Source Spirits! My body..."
<br><br>
When he was done carefully examining his body, he finally discovered that he was now reduced into an ordinary mortal! He couldn't even look into his inner world or use his chaotic energy, let alone release his spiritual sense or draw his soul out of his body.
<br><br>
'Hmmm… this mortal body was specially built for me to use in this illusion world. It is quite unique, but what is it for?' he wondered.
<br><br>
It was quiet everywhere in the dark wilderness.
<br><br>
He had originally planned to find Elvinia first, but now it seemed impossible.
<br><br>
There were no hints given in the test, so he had no choice but to move forward aimlessly.
<br><br>
Due to his current mortal body, he was no longer as strong as he used to be.
<br><br>
After he had strolled for two hours, he gradually felt worn out. He sensed a long lost feeling of fatigue from deep within him.
<br><br>
"I'm so tired..."
<br><br>
He wiped the sweat off his forehead. Although he had walked for such a long time, he bet that he should have been able to travel such a distance with a single step if he still had his real strength.
<br><br>
The moment sleepiness and hunger began to overtake him, he suddenly saw a bonfire in the distance. Several people stood around the bonfire and held kebabs, which they grilled above the fire. The blazing flames illuminated the oil that dropped from the meat, which shone with a tempting glaze and burned with crackling sounds.
<br><br>
The meat released a wonderful aroma that almost touched Zen's soul. It was an unimaginable temptation, especially for him who was currently so tired and hungry.
<br><br>
The people around the bonfire soon saw him, and they all looked at him with awe and respect. They bowed respectfully to him, as if he was a great and authoritative figure.
<br><br>
Somehow, he felt relieved at the way these people reacted to him. He pointed towards the kebabs and his orexis, or appetite, was clearly palpable.
<br><br>
Among the seven emotions and six desires humans possessed, the orexis was the most intense one. Ever since Zen no longer needed to eat food, he rarely had big meals apart from some special treats he had enjoyed in the divine land. Now that he was reduced to an ordinary mortal, his desire overwhelmed him when it had gotten aroused.
<br><br>
"You can't eat this!"
<br><br>
"If you eat this, you will die!"
<br><br>
"If you die, you will be eliminated from the test!"
<br><br>
To his surprise, the people warned and stopped him, their faces filled with horror.
<br><br>
In turn, he looked at them with confusion. Of course, he hadn't forgotten that he was still in an illusion, trying to pass the test the statue had arranged.
<br><br>
Still, he refused to believe that he would die once he ate the meat.
<br><br>
The meat kept giving off a tempting smell. Zen swallowed hard and reached out to the kebab, ready to feast on it.
<br><br>
However, one of them took the meat before he could and gobbled it.
<br><br>
After a few bites, the man's eyes suddenly rolled to the back of his head. He foamed at the mouth and fell heavily to the ground! "This is poisonous!"
<br><br>
"You can't eat this!"
<br><br>
"Or else, you will die like him!"
<br><br>
The others warned him harshly once again.
<br><br>
Afterwards, he glanced at the people's solemn faces and only rolled his eyes in response.
<br><br>
'What a weird test. Am I only supposed not to eat a piece of meat?' he thought.
<br><br>
As of now, he was still able to pull himself back.
<br><br>
Previously in the Dark Region, the Dark Nether Bugs had posed a great temptation to him, but he had still managed to suppress his desire. Thus, he believed a few pieces of roasted meat were no problem for him.
<br><br>
He remained perfectly calm. On the other hand, those people kept fussing around like idiots and exclaimed that he shouldn't eat the poisonous meat.
<br><br>
"Where is this place? What the hell do you want? Is this the test for me?" he asked continuously.
<br><br>
Despite his many questions, the people only turned a deaf ear to his words.
<br><br>
In the end, he just shrugged and moved on.
<br><br>
The world he was in was a boundless wilderness, and there seemed to be no end to it at all.
<br><br>
Not even a single hint was given to him. The only thing he could do was move forward.
<br><br>
After four more hours, he was finally completely exhausted. He felt his throat burn as thirst and hunger began to cloud his mind.
<br><br>
'I need to eat and drink...' As soon as the thought came to his mind, a gust of wind suddenly carried a delicate bouquet of wine to him.
<br><br>
The wine's fragrance rushed into his nostrils, until it reached all the way into the depths of his soul.
<br><br>
He shivered as he was deeply dazed and exhausted. Still, he managed to look up and saw some brilliant lights in front of him.
<br><br>
There was a big table laden with various kinds of fruits, while fragrant wines of different colors filled the glasses and emitted an intoxicating scent.
<br><br>
There were people who sat around the table, who all stood up and bowed respectfully to Zen.
<br><br>
"Please help yourself to the wines and fruits," they said.
<br><br>
'They didn't stop me from eating and drinking!' he happily thought to himself. "But, you should know, they are all poisonous!" someone suddenly warned.
<br><br>
"What's wrong with you?" Zen grumbled.
<br><br>
He glared sullenly at the people around him. He felt that he was about to go crazy! After he was demoted to an ordinary mortal, all of his emotions and desires felt authentic. Therefore, it was difficult for him to resist his instinct for eating.
<br><br>
Finally, he couldn't help but satisfy his desire for food. Even though he had a very strong will, he now gave in to his orexis.
<br><br>
As he stumbled helplessly towards the wines and fruits, he suddenly heard a voice in his mind that said, "If you die here, your previous efforts will be wasted!"
<br><br>
It was true that he had gone on a hard path before entering the temple. Of course, there was no way that he would resign himself to the prospect of losing right then and there.
<br><br>
Chapter 3611 Six Desires No proper introduction was given regarding the rules of this world or how to pass the test.
<br><br>
However, those people had already given Zen a clear hint.
<br><br>
If he ate all the food, he would certainly die. His death would mean he'd surely be kicked out of the game.
<br><br>
This round of the game would test his self-discipline and willpower.
<br><br>
Although Zen's tremendous amount of experience had made his soul powerful beyond measure, it did not affect his decisiveness and willpower whatsoever.
<br><br>
Besides, when one's willpower had increased to a certain extent, it would be difficult for it to advance further.
<br><br>
Normally, Zen would've dealt with similar situations by utilizing the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Now that he had lost all his abilities and theurgies, it would be impossible for him to use it.
<br><br>
A familiar scent wafted through his nose and made him swallow. It was wine. With a newfound determination, he turned around and left.
<br><br>
In the wilderness, he was still alone.
<br><br>
His body was exhausted from being pushed to its limit—a constant reminder of his hunger and thirst. It was so bad that he felt his throat was dry and burning with each exhale.
<br><br>
This worsened once he saw light appear before him again.
<br><br>
Beneath it was laid a bevy of delicious food. What would've normally been pure pleasure turned into pure torture at that moment.
<br><br>
The light illuminated a mouthwatering and tempting array of food and wine, which suppressed Zen's waning restraint.
<br><br>
He thought to himself a few times that this wasn't just merely a test but an act of torture as well! Eight hours passed...
<br><br>
Ten hours passed...
<br><br>
Twenty hours passed...
<br><br>
This mortal body he possessed, although strong, could only take so much. If it reached its limit, then he would die too.
<br><br>
'If I push this body too much, then I'll never be able to pass the test, ' he thought to himself as he walked onwards like a living corpse.
<br><br>
When he was lost in his thoughts, everything before him faded into black as his eyes fell shut and his body fell to the ground with a thud.
<br><br>
It took a while before he gradually regained his consciousness.
<br><br>
He immediately and quickly took a look at his surroundings as he came out of his slumber.
<br><br>
He should've been back at the temple if he failed.
<br><br>
To his surprise, he wasn't in the wilderness nor the temple. Now he sat on a throne within the walls of a golden palace, his body covered in an imperial robe. At the bottom of the steps leading to the throne stood the civil and military ministers.
<br><br>
"I'm not eliminated. Have I passed the first test?" he asked as he still sat on the throne, a slight hint of joy beginning to wash over him.
<br><br>
The first round tested his desire for food and drink. What would the second test have in store for him? As Zen gazed down at the ministers gathered before him, his faces held strange expressions. He came to realize something and asked, "Will this round test my desire for power?"
<br><br>
Since he was aware that everything was merely an illusion, he also knew that the power and wealth surrounding him were fake. He began to wonder how this test could work. Moreover, he never held a desire to possess a high position or vast amounts of wealth.
<br><br>
This round of test wouldn't be too difficult, then.
<br><br>
However, Zen would soon find out that this round would be anything but simple and easy.
<br><br>
In a limited period of time, tests like this were meaningless.
<br><br>
However, illusions such as this had the potential to make him feel as though hundreds or even thousands of years had passed.
<br><br>
Zen was able to cope with this world with an indifferent attitude in the beginning. But as more time passed, he soon became more convinced that he was indeed the mortal emperor of this world for dozens of years...
<br><br>
It appeared that his real memories were slowly fading away—as if to give space for his new, mortal memories to take over.
<br><br>
He became entangled in the various situations of the citizens, ministers, and even concubines. In one way or another, he was involved with all of them.
<br><br>
Within the temple, the statue located within its center tilted its head to gaze at the starry pattern.
<br><br>
Among the stars, Zen, Elvinia, and the human woman were all undergoing different trials.
<br><br>
The statue, which was a puppet, could still think like a normal person.
<br><br>
However, it had its limits as well.
<br><br>
Its current mission was to wait in the temple and choose the most qualified one.
<br><br>
Deep within its heart, it had already rejected the idea of choosing the woman from the Nihility race or Elvinia from the beginning. If it had it its way, it would've prevented them both from entering the starry pattern and accepting the test in the first place.
<br><br>
"Will he find his end at this round?" the statue uttered to no one in particular.
<br><br>
In fact, Elvinia and the human woman were performing better than Zen.
<br><br>
The woman from the Nihility race had already managed to pass three out of the six desire tests. What amazed the statue even further was the fact that Elvinia had passed four desire tests in a row, as if none of the desires had great control over her. She seemed to be totally in control of herself.
<br><br>
"I wonder if they know," the statue said, "that the more complicated experiences one has, the harder it would be to make it through each test?"
<br><br>
The statue could do nothing more than let out a sigh and see what would happen next.
<br><br>
In Elvinia's case, her past experiences were vast and unpleasant but far from complicated. Before meeting Zen, a majority of her life was boring. This gave her the mindset and resistance to be able to pass through the temptations with ease.
<br><br>
Back in the illusion, Zen had believed that he had been emperor for nearly a hundred years.
<br><br>
He seemed to have completely forgotten who he truly was and now believed that he was someone else—the sovereign emperor of an imaginary kingdom.
<br><br>
Throughout his rule, he had received numerous compliments from his subjects and every word he said was regarded as a law.
<br><br>
Two hundred years passed...
<br><br>
Three hundred years passed...
<br><br>
Five hundred years passed...
<br><br>
One day, a strange feeling suddenly overcame Zen.
<br><br>
His original memories returned and crashed into him like a tidal wave.
<br><br>
Soon, he recognized the ridiculousness of all that surrounded him.
<br><br>
While he was realizing this, all the citizens, ministers and concubines turned into skeletons, their crumbling bones turning to dust that was swept away by the wind.
<br><br>
The huge palace collapsed in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Only then did Zen realize that he had been trapped in the test for a long time. It took him hundreds of years to pass the test.
<br><br>
However, time in the starry illusion passed at a different rate from time in the outside world.
<br><br>
In reality, Zen had only been trapped in that kingdom for ten minutes.
<br><br>
After Zen passed the test, the entire world began to change once more.
<br><br>
Before him stood numerous beautiful women. Some of them were coquettish while others were more affectionate.
<br><br>
"A test of...sexual desire?" Zen raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>
The third test was considerably easier for Zen. Although he was a mortal now, he had already experienced love. The gorgeous women surrounding him were unsuccessful in tempting him any further.
<br><br>
While they possessed the most pleasant and seductive voices and smelled of the most enticing perfumes, Zen was able to restrain himself. Slowly but surely, he passed the third test.
<br><br>
The fourth test passed...
<br><br>
The fifth test passed...
<br><br>
Finally, the sixth test passed...
<br><br>
Originally, Zen was lagging behind the other two competitors, in last place to pass the tests. But now that both women were stuck in the test of same desire, he was miraculously in the first place.
<br><br>
"Now that I've passed the tests of six desires, does this mean that I've passed the entire test?"
<br><br>
If this was what the starry illusion would always be like, then it should be a piece of cake for Zen. After all, he only had difficulty in the second test.
<br><br>
But Zen remained in this world of illusions. He remained among the stars.
<br><br>
As if sensing his confusion, the stars began to cover and spin around him once more.
<br><br>
As a result, the spinning began to project spectacular scenes before his very eyes.
<br><br>
The grand desolated land, the sea, the mountains...
<br><br>
As the vision continued, he began to see the entire world before him from a great distance.
<br><br>
What he initially thought he was staring at was the Source World. However, he later confirmed that this was an entirely different world.
<br><br>
Whereas the Source World was shaped like a huge egg with numerous provinces within its shell, the world Zen saw before him at that moment was made up of countless stars.
<br><br>
Chapter 3612 The God Of Fire Zen traveled through the stars.
<br><br>
A huge star swept past his head, and as he gazed at it, all the knowledge of it drilled itself into his mind.
<br><br>
Its name was Mysterious Earth, and eighty hundred million humans lived on it.
<br><br>
"There are so many humans on this star, and none of them are secondary creatures from the inner worlds," Zen murmured to himself, amazed and deep in thought.
<br><br>
He whizzed past three more stars and once again, their names jumped into his mind.
<br><br>
There were thirty billion humans living on them. This number was truly impressive.
<br><br>
He then saw many more stars up ahead.
<br><br>
Perhaps being in this illusion for too long had slowed him mentally, for it was only now that he suddenly realized that this was the human race's chaotic era, also known as the 77th chaotic era.
<br><br>
Zen had seen the chaotic eras of the Dreaded Eye Demons and the Regal Jade Civilization once.
<br><br>
But whether it was the view shown to him by the Eye of Will or displayed through the Civilization Artifact by the Regal Jade Spirit, they both paled in comparison to what he saw now.
<br><br>
The sheer amount of stars was ridiculous and each star housed hundreds of thousands of humans.
<br><br>
If he was not aware he had been in an illusion, he would have treated this place as another Source World.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The stars sped up rapidly, zooming in at him and flying by in an instant.
<br><br>
They varied in size; the small ones were thousands of miles in diameter, while the big ones were tens of millions of miles in diameter.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
After passing through millions of them, finally, Zen looked upon a gigantic star before him. It was probably over a hundred billion miles in diameter. Its entire body burned a fiery red, its surface a sea of hellfire. Blazing fire dragons spiraled up from the surface, spurting flames towards the sky.
<br><br>
'Wow, that's incredibly hot...' Zen thought, feeling the heat as he approached the star.
<br><br>
His body had now returned to its normal state and although the heat was excruciating, he could handle it.
<br><br>
As he got closer, a massive flame palace came into view below him, entirely dark red with molten lava flowing within.
<br><br>
In such extreme heat as this, any material would be melted. Who knew what it actually was that flowed like lava? Even the fire spirits would find it difficult to survive here. The flame palace appeared to be the core of the entire star.
<br><br>
When Zen landed in front of it, he saw someone ahead.
<br><br>
It was a man with red hair and red eyebrows, sitting completely naked atop a huge fire lotus. When he saw Zen, he pointed at him and yelled, "Please sit down!"
<br><br>
"Who are you?" asked Zen.
<br><br>
He recalled seeing a statue of this person in the temple.
<br><br>
"I am Zhurong, the ruler of the Fire Region, and the God of Fire," the red haired man said proudly.
<br><br>
Two faint flames flickered in his eyes. They looked as though they could burn anything and everything.
<br><br>
"The God of Fire," Zen muttered, raising an eyebrow.
<br><br>
Zhurong was one of the thirty-nine heroes who had put their statues in the temple on the Other Shore. He was probably one of the top masters in the human race.
<br><br>
"My test is very simple. Please sit next to me for five minutes," said Zhurong calmly, pointing to the fire lotus beside him.
<br><br>
Zen blinked and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he jumped onto the fire lotus.
<br><br>
The moment he sat down, flames ignited in the eyes of Zhurong's statue in the temple.
<br><br>
The statue that was looking at the starry pattern noticed what Zhurong was doing. It smiled and said, "This guy just passed the tests of six desires, and now he has to take your test."
<br><br>
"I will burn him to ashes," the statue of Zhurong replied, soft and frightening.
<br><br>
The statues finished speaking and Zen's fire lotus in the starry illusion instantly turned to a blazing white. The white light surged up and enveloped Zen's body.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Zhurong looked on indifferently.
<br><br>
He was perpetually irritable and cold-hearted.
<br><br>
Even though only a wisp of his energy soul was in his statue, he was still incomparably harsh. Meeting him in the first test after the tests of six desires was a bad stroke of luck for Zen.
<br><br>
However, his indifference didn't last long. Soon, his eyes widened strangely before his expression morphed to outright shock and disbelief! Golden vortexes circled Zen's body and absorbed all the heat from the fire lotus, which hadn't caused him much trouble at all.
<br><br>
If things went on like this, Zen would most probably remain safe and sound no matter how long he sat there.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The fire lotus released even more heat.
<br><br>
Its light turned from blazing white to brilliant blue, reflecting an odd color onto Zen's body.
<br><br>
And yet Zen still sat motionless and unbothered.
<br><br>
Swoosh! After five minutes, the fire lotus's heat gradually simmered down. Zen, still sitting on the fire lotus, cupped his hands towards Zhurong and asked, "Master Zhurong, have I passed the test?"
<br><br>
Zhurong looked at Zen, confused. He had a lot of questions himself.
<br><br>
But when he created this energy soul, he had set some limitations on it, so he was prevented from asking anything.
<br><br>
"You may leave now," replied Zhurong briefly.
<br><br>
Zen then left the palace and took off at blistering speed, quickly leaving this unimaginably huge star behind him.
<br><br>
It was as Zhurong said that this area was known as the Fire Region and was once under his control.
<br><br>
Once Zen had left the Fire Region, many icy blue stars floated towards him from the distance. They were terrifyingly large, their bodies crystal clear.
<br><br>
Obviously, they were pure.
<br><br>
Soon, a pure white star came straight at Zen.
<br><br>
The strong stream of air on the outermost side of the star mixed with the snowstorm, capable of tearing through anything in its path.
<br><br>
Zen entered the interior of the star, only to find it white and strangely quiet.
<br><br>
A huge ice palace emerged in front of him, a thin man sitting alone inside it.
<br><br>
His body was a translucent blue with ripples of water flowing across its surface.
<br><br>
Before Zen could open his mouth to ask, the man introduced himself, "I am Gonggong, the God of Water. Please have a seat."
<br><br>
After Zen met the God of Fire, the sudden appearance of the God of Water did not surprise him. 'Will all thirty-nine statues test me in turn?' he muttered in his heart.
<br><br>
Chapter 3613 The Buddha Region Water suddenly gushed out and filled the surroundings of the palace.
<br><br>
The temperature gradually reached an extremely low point but the water continuously flowed without being frozen.
<br><br>
However, as the water eventually made contact with Zen, a sudden unimaginable chill seeped into the deepest parts of his soul. He instantly lost focus and was flabbergasted by the uncontrollable piercing sensation brought about by the cold water.
<br><br>
"It's so cold..." Every part of his body was already trembling.
<br><br>
The water rose quickly, almost submerging four-fifths of their bodies.
<br><br>
Gonggong then said to Zen, "If you're able to hold on for five minutes, you pass. If not, then you fail."
<br><br>
Soon, the rising water filled the whole palace, fully submerging both Zen and Gonggong.
<br><br>
Zen's body heat quickly dissipated and his entire body grew stiff. It was a very dangerous situation as he couldn't even move an inch.
<br><br>
'I can't take this anymore...' Previously, during the test by Zhurong, the God of Fire, Zen easily aced it as his body couldn't be harmed by fire. However, as he faced Gonggong, his weakness was exposed as he had so much difficulty in dealing with the low temperature that was overwhelming his body.
<br><br>
Crack! Under the supreme pressure brought about by the numbing cold water, cracks began to appear on the surface of Zen's body. His flesh was gradually being torn apart.
<br><br>
What scared him more was that as his body started to rip, he didn't feel any pain.
<br><br>
'How did all my strength leave my body? Is it because of the very low temperature?' Zen thought as his mind went hazier by the minute.
<br><br>
When his body started to crack, even the Chaotic Source Spirits couldn't be activated. This was the first time that Zen had experienced being subjected to such a low temperature.
<br><br>
'I need heat to restore my strength!' He remembered that energy could bring heat into one's body as it swirled inside.
<br><br>
In the moment of desperation, Zen madly extracted a lot of divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
As the force surged through his body, his stiff bones and muscles gradually recovered. Heat quickly gathered and spread throughout his body.
<br><br>
At the same time, Gonggong was looking at Zen indifferently from a distance. He was quite disappointed with his performance.
<br><br>
'He should have been smarter than this and done something right away when he came into contact with the cold water. Now it might be too late for him.' Zen had been frozen for a while and Gonggong thought that it might be impossible for him to counter the situation.
<br><br>
In the middle of the palace, Zen was standing still like a frozen figure.
<br><br>
From the outside, it seemed like he was already finished as he was unable to do anything to get rid of the cold water.
<br><br>
However, inside his body, many divine megatons of force was furiously circulating.
<br><br>
The faster it moved, the more heat and energy it accumulated.
<br><br>
Just when Gonggong deemed that Zen had miserably failed the test, Zen's fingers suddenly shook. His arms also began to move, followed by his shoulder, torso, and legs.
<br><br>
"Oh? This guy..." Gonggong's eyes narrowed as the scene developed in front of him.
<br><br>
As Zen gradually recovered and unfroze his stiff body, his movements became more natural. The ice-cold water in the palace began swirling around him.
<br><br>
The water rotated frantically as the temperature increased gradually. In a matter of seconds, the once ice-cold water that filled the palace became lukewarm.
<br><br>
As Gonggong became satisfied with Zen's performance, he gently waved his hand. The abundant water quickly rescinded and flowed away until there was none left.
<br><br>
What was left was Zen's figure enveloped by a thick mist. It turned out that due to Zen's high body temperature, the cold water nearest to his body vaporized into this mist.
<br><br>
Zen slowly stepped out from the mist and said, "Can I leave now?" He was proud of his achievement but still managed to show utmost respect as he bowed to Gonggong.
<br><br>
With a faint smile on his face, Gonggong didn't say anything but pointed his finger at the door, signaling Zen that he could now leave.
<br><br>
This region of stars that Gonggong was in charge of was called Water Region. It occupied many stars, about the same size as the Fire Region under Zhurong's jurisdiction.
<br><br>
'The Water Region and Fire Region should be comparable to a super force in the Source World. It also means that the strength and status of Gonggong and Zhurong must be about equal to the Snake Goddess' and Eastern Emperor Taiyi's. However, those two have been on the Other Shore for countless years. I wonder how strong they really are now...' Zen was immersed in these thoughts as he flew through the stars.
<br><br>
As he continued traversing across the starry sky, he knew he had to pass the tests of thirty-nine heroes.
<br><br>
'It seems like I don't have a choice but to accept all of their challenges. I'm not actually against it. Actually, it would be such a great honor if I could meet them all in person. It's just that...' Zen realized a great problem that was waiting for him.
<br><br>
Facing all the heroes generally meant that he would have to face the real Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Chiyou, and so on.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess in the Source World could be considered as another persona that was created purposely. They were both the Snake Goddess but were different at the same time. Zen understood the concept but still felt a little strange.
<br><br>
Swoosh! As Zen dashed at top speed, the surrounding stars changed in appearance yet again.
<br><br>
Bright golden stars began swarming towards him one after another.
<br><br>
When he landed, he saw golden Buddha statues all over the place. Each golden Buddha statue had a different shape and appearance. Some were standing while some were lying on the ground. There were myriads of statues in various postures.
<br><br>
In fact, wherever one's eyes went on this golden planet, it was still covered by Buddha statues.
<br><br>
"So this must be the Buddha Region…" Zen narrowed his eyes as he scanned the entire area that was beaming in golden lights.
<br><br>
In his father's universe, Buddhism was inherited and practiced in some portions. However, upon reaching the divine land, there wasn't a single trace of Buddhism. It disappeared from the Source World as well.
<br><br>
There was actually an explanation regarding that.
<br><br>
The civilization of the 77th chaos shouldn't have appeared in this particular round of chaos.
<br><br>
Both the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were seeds that were planted purposely.
<br><br>
Likewise, Buddhism might have been spread, but for some reason, it hadn't developed.
<br><br>
When Zen had read through the ancient books in the Source World, he also found out the origin of Zhurong, the God of Fire. He discovered that he belonged to a human force that had fought with the Sky Rending Rhinoceros before. But since the said force didn't develop, they also disappeared in the Source World.
<br><br>
Dong! A loud and melodious bell rang out in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Immediately after, a ray of golden light bloomed out before Zen as a huge Buddha statue appeared from the blinding lights.
<br><br>
His hands took the mudra of teaching. Then he looked at Zen with an amiable gaze.
<br><br>
Just when Zen was about to speak, the Buddha suddenly closed his eyes.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen felt that his chest became unusually heavy. His eyes were also forced to close. Everything turned dark and inaudible.
<br><br>
However, for Zen, whose six senses were sealed, did not fall into the darkness.
<br><br>
In his innermost being, the golden light bloomed once again. He faced the Buddha with his consciousness. He saw that the Buddha was still staring at him with the mudra of teaching. With this, his innermost being was also sealed and he sank to the innermost being of his innermost being.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to face the Buddha again using the innermost being of his innermost being, the same thing happened that forced him into the third layer of his innermost being.
<br><br>
As Zen kept on being sealed repeatedly, he had lost count of which layer of his innermost being he had reached.
<br><br>
He only felt that the change of time was extremely slow, and every time that he would open his eyes, he could always see the calm face of the golden Buddha.
<br><br>
Chapter 3614 An Easy Test Once light and dark ceased to replace each other, the sealing finally concluded.
<br><br>
"Is this to test one's state of mind?" Zen asked. The Buddha nodded in affirmation.
<br><br>
"Yes."
<br><br>
Zen tilted his head in curiosity. "Am I supposed to break the seal in five minutes?"
<br><br>
The Buddha nodded once again. "If that is what you wish."
<br><br>
"Alright then."
<br><br>
Zen prepared himself by taking a deep breath before he began to concentrate his mind and energy on the task at hand.
<br><br>
He was literally trapped in his own mind and everything was happening in his head, but that did not mean that the world around him was not real.
<br><br>
A benefit of his current situation, however, was being able to do whatever he wanted.
<br><br>
"Mind Sword!" he called from within him. "Break!"
<br><br>
As Zen's mind shouted his command, long swords suddenly materialized beside him.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack His swords, borne from his own will, flew out and shattered the Buddha statues that once covered the land. With the statues gone, the world around him began to crumble.
<br><br>
Like a huge illusory curtain, Zen's swords had split the world open, tearing it apart in order to reveal another, newer world underneath.
<br><br>
"The swordsmanship that is used to mainly cultivate the state of mind was inherited from the Starry Sword Region," the Buddha told him in a calm, enlightened voice. Zen raised an eyebrow at the mention of the technique's origin.
<br><br>
"The Starry Sword Region?" he repeated. He then remembered the Oneness Sky Palace and its ruler. "Is that region ruled by Eastern Emperor Taiyi?"
<br><br>
"The one and only," the Buddha confirmed. "However, I'm afraid it's going to be too difficult to break the mental prison with just this cultivation method. Though your state of mind is sharp, it is not enough."
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but scoff in amusement. "Really? I don't find it difficult to destroy this world though."
<br><br>
Boom! As soon as he said that, a loud explosion reverberated all around them as the long swords from before shot out and shattered everything. When the old world fell, another took its place.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! It was a constant state of creation and destruction as Zen continued to shatter the thirteen worlds that surrounded his mind.
<br><br>
At this rate, five minutes would be more than enough for him to pass the Buddha's test.
<br><br>
On the fourteenth world, Zen summoned his swords once again but the number he was able to conjure was noticeably less. When he launched his attack, the world did not shatter and only cracked in a few places.
<br><br>
Zen frowned and willed himself to try again. "Mind Sword! Shatter!"
<br><br>
A gentle, understanding smile appeared on the Buddha's face. "You're tired."
<br><br>
Zen's state of mind was sharp, but his strength turned out to also be his boon. His mind was too sharp that it consumed a large amount of mental strength, which lessened his endurance.
<br><br>
As the Buddha said, Zen felt tired. "There is no standard for the cultivation of mental strength. I'm afraid I can't cultivate it," he sighed.
<br><br>
The cultivation of the state of mind was mysterious and it was all up to one's own comprehension.
<br><br>
"You don't know how to cultivate it but that doesn't mean you can't. I can teach you an omnipotent Buddha theurgy to enlighten you if you want," the Buddha said with a smile.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes flashed at the Buddha's offer. "An omnipotent Buddha theurgy?"
<br><br>
These thirty-nine heroes were once considered the strongest figures in the past chaotic era.
<br><br>
Though he did not know the Buddha's real name, Zen knew that he was still considered a master in Buddha Region. His theurgy was no doubt unparalleled.
<br><br>
"Isn't this a test?" Zen asked. "Why are you offering to teach me?" It didn't make that much sense to him. Why offer a lesson in the middle of a practical test? "Whether it's a test or not depends on your own perception," the Buddha vaguely explained. "Fate brought us together so there is no need for me to test you."
<br><br>
That explanation wasn't enough to clear all of Zen's apprehensions. This test was completely different from what he imagined.
<br><br>
As he thought it through, the Buddha began to speak.
<br><br>
A series of strange words reached Zen's ears but since he was trapped in his mind, he couldn't really hear anything.
<br><br>
However, even if his ears weren't working, he still felt that soft pressure in his mind.
<br><br>
"These words..."
<br><br>
They were all meaningless but they were connected to each other since they had such a profound effect on him. Zen couldn't help but compare them to Sanskrit words as the pressure continued to build in his mind.
<br><br>
When the Buddha ceased his chanting, the pressure had reached its peak and he felt a warm feeling flood through his head. The fatigue that previously plagued him was long gone and he felt extremely relaxed.
<br><br>
"Mind Sword!"
<br><br>
Boom! "Mind Sword!"
<br><br>
Boom! He was now back to shattering the worlds in one strike. If he felt himself getting tired, Zen merely activated the mind method that the Buddha just taught him.
<br><br>
In no time at all, Zen had broken through all the sealed worlds and passed the Buddha's test. On top of that, he even learned an omnipotent theurgy! To say he was happy was an understatement.
<br><br>
Zen, however, couldn't help but be curious. "What's the name of this mind method? How does it have such a miraculous effect?"
<br><br>
"It is named the Buddha Mind Method and if you use it in reverse, it can trap your opponents in mental prisons," the Buddha answered.
<br><br>
Zen cupped his hands in respect. "Thank you! May I have your name?"
<br><br>
His reply was a mere smile. The Buddha calmly pushed him away and put distance between Zen and the Buddha Region.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was convinced he was never going to find out this master's name, he heard a voice mumble softly in his head. "My name is Tathagata."
<br><br>
"Tathagata..."
<br><br>
Zen repeated the name to himself, intending to keep it with him as he flew into the void.
<br><br>
In the 77th chaotic era, the Buddha Region might have very well been a powerful force.
<br><br>
To Zen, since the 77th civilization had been dominated by humans, then that must mean it was much better than the current chaotic era.
<br><br>
In fact, it was much more complicated than he had first imagined.
<br><br>
As Zen flew, he was once again enveloped by new scenery.
<br><br>
He found himself a star. Zen landed on it and saw a man with incredibly delicate and graceful features. He was so handsome that he could even be considered more beautiful than most women.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" Zen asked. The handsome man gave him a shining smile.
<br><br>
"I'm Emperor Charm."
<br><br>
Zen's eyes immediately widened. "Emperor Charm?!" The emperor nodded and waved his hand dismissively.
<br><br>
"You can go. I don't have any test for you."
<br><br>
His nonchalance took Zen aback. "You don't have any test for me?"
<br><br>
Wasn't the whole point of being here to let these human heroes test and recognize him? Zen did not immediately do as he said. He merely stood there and stared at the emperor of the Sun Crow race before opening his mouth. "Emperor Charm, did all of you have the same goal back then?"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm tilted his head in curiosity. "What goal?"
<br><br>
"Changing the fate of the chaos and realizing the Finale Way," Zen replied.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm let out a charming laugh that sounded like light, chiming bells on a sunny day. "Of course we had the same goal!"
<br><br>
"It's a pity that the Emperor Charm in the current round of chaos has chosen the opposite way."
<br><br>
The laughter died on Emperor Charm's throat after he heard what Zen just said.
<br><br>
The Emperor Charm in the current round of chaos had inherited everything of him: talent, personality, bloodline, and even theurgies. However, at the end of the day, he remained his own person and even the real Emperor Charm had no power over him.
<br><br>
"I see."
<br><br>
Emperor Charm waved his hand, summoning a gust of wind that blew Zen away.
<br><br>
Chapter 3615 The Past Many regions of stars enveloped Zen endlessly, where he met each powerhouse of the human race one by one.
<br><br>
Among these people were Houtu, Queen of the Earth, in charge of everything that revolved around nature, Houyi, who shot the suns with a bow...
<br><br>
(*TN: Most of these heroes are deities from Chinese mythology and folktales.) Though they presented themselves as humans in front of Zen, most of them were not pure human beings.
<br><br>
For example, Emperor Charm had demonic blood going through his veins because he was a Sun Crow in nature.
<br><br>
There was also the Snake Goddess who was half human and half snake, while Wukong was actually a monkey with extraordinary combat effectiveness.
<br><br>
However, because these beings were all born in the 77th civilization, they all agreed with the human civilization.
<br><br>
When Zen saw the Snake Goddess again, he felt strange.
<br><br>
He knew the two Snake Goddesses were not the same person, but they could almost be considered one. They both possessed the power to read people's minds.
<br><br>
"I thought I would be the one to open the temple with the Other Shore Key,"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess said to Zen. "How come it ended up being you?"
<br><br>
She was referring to the Snake Goddess in the Source World.
<br><br>
"Is this a test?" Zen responded, smiling at the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Sort of." She shrugged.
<br><br>
In fact, except Zhurong and Gonggong, other powerhouses didn't really test Zen.
<br><br>
Zen didn't hide anything; to him, there was nothing worth hiding.
<br><br>
Very calmly, he told the Snake Goddess how he obtained the last SixPattern Blood-storing Seed, and how he had discovered the Other Shore Key.
<br><br>
Once he finished explaining, the Snake Goddess was baffled, "I did not realize I'd not have the patience to obtain the last Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. It's fate. You..."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess hesitated and did not finish her sentence.
<br><br>
After leaving the starry region the Snake Goddess was in, Zen made his way to enter another starry region, where he met Fuxi.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, the Fuxi before him seemed to be the same as the one in the Source World.
<br><br>
"Hey man," Fuxi called out. "Am I powerful in the Source World?"
<br><br>
"Yes, you are," Zen responded lightly.
<br><br>
In terms of pure strength, most powerful warriors in the Source World were inferior to Fuxi. No one was ever willing to get into a fight with him.
<br><br>
"Well, how did the woman from the neighboring starry region treat me?"
<br><br>
Fuxi continued to ask..
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Zen was shocked to hear this, having just seen the Snake Goddess prior to Fuxi.
<br><br>
Under the pressure of Fuxi, Zen bragged about his position in the Pear Hill before he let him go.
<br><br>
After Zen left, a look of confusion spread across Fuxi's face. Among the thirty-nine heroes, Fuxi was the most unwilling to accept his fate. What he thought was surprisingly the same as what the Fuxi in the Source World thought.
<br><br>
Not long afterwards, Zen met the Divine Farmer and the Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
After both of them finally understood their incarnations' choices in the Source World, they grew to become extremely grim.
<br><br>
Both the Divine Farmer and the Yellow Thearch were clear about their personality and their incarnations. Once they were determined on their own path, they would have to go on without hesitation. As the real them were trapped on the Other Shore, they couldn't do anything about it.
<br><br>
Over time, more and more stars swept past Zen as he met the past powerhouses one by one.
<br><br>
"The thirty-eighth one..."
<br><br>
As another starry region enveloped him, he ended up at the top of a cyan mountain. Right before him stood a burly middle-aged man.
<br><br>
Although the middle-aged man appeared quite different from Chiyou's energy soul Zen had met, he could still recognize the man at a glance.
<br><br>
It was known by everyone that Chiyou in the divine land was already dead.
<br><br>
He was naturally not as imposing as the one in front of Zen.
<br><br>
"My blood is flowing in your body," Chiyou pointed out. "Are you my descendant?"
<br><br>
Zen smiled and nodded. "You... You are my grandfather."
<br><br>
Just then, Chiyou's face shifted from puzzled to ecstatic as he gave Zen a warm embrace.
<br><br>
It was after a heated discussion that these powerful masters decided to place the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Before, it was assumed that the Snake Goddess was going to open the temple. However, it ended up being Zen, Chiyou's grandson. Chiyou said in surprise, "It seems that the Nine Li race has developed well."
<br><br>
The Nine Li Region was a very strong existence in the 77th civilization, so Chiyou had no doubts of Nine Li race's power.
<br><br>
"Here's the thing, grandpa. The Nine Li race was destroyed, and you were killed by the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer in the Source World,"
<br><br>
Zen said, trying to soften the blow with his tone. "Only some members of the race are still alive. Moreover, I've joined the Oneness Sky Palace."
<br><br>
Chiyou's face stiffened for a moment, but eventually, eased up as he smiled helplessly. "I didn't expect things would go this way, but I am more than proud to hear that you have opened the temple!"
<br><br>
Chiyou was never one to focus on the negatives. Even after hearing about the tragic ending of the Nine Li race, he was not disgraced. He asked Zen about many things.
<br><br>
Among all the stars he visited, Zen remained with Chiyou the longest. He made sure to tell Chiyou what he had experienced in detail.
<br><br>
Chiyou never would have guessed that this was the situation in the Source World.
<br><br>
In the beginning, the plan of the human race was very successful. There were many civilizations in the Source World, and this brought an upper hand for the humans of the 77th civilization. Unfortunately, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race ended up betraying everyone, which took them by surprise.
<br><br>
After a few more hours, Zen eventually left the Nine Li Region.
<br><br>
The regions of stars that he'd visited positioned themselves above his head and spiraled around each other. Then the golden region of stars in the center shrouded him.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen fell into the depths of the palace of a golden star. Green jade slips floated in the air, and the words on the slips were never ending.
<br><br>
Among the slips stood a statue-like being, which turned out to be a real person who faced Zen.
<br><br>
"Young man, you can sit down," the man said, gesturing towards the chair right in front of Zen.
<br><br>
"Thank you, sir," Zen said, following the man's instruction. It was only then that he'd realized this person was the most important figure among the thirty-nine heroes.
<br><br>
The man smiled at Zen, positioned a few jade slips before him, and asked, "You are a human, aren't you? Are you interested in the history of the human race?"
<br><br>
"You mean the human race in the 77th chaos?" Zen shot back with a question.
<br><br>
"Yes," the man nodded. "All about the 77th civilization."
<br><br>
Zen had no idea this was what he was getting into. "Yes, I am more than interested."
<br><br>
Hearing this, the man gently knocked on the jade slips that were resting on the table, and green threads suddenly floated out of them. These threads attached themselves to Zen's temples, flashing the entire history of the human race into his mind.
<br><br>
It seemed that even back then, the human race already had many disputes and conflicts.
<br><br>
Overall, even in the early stages, the 77th chaos had gone through three massive tribulations: the battle of ancestral sorcerers, the battle for becoming gods, and the battle of Taoism and Buddhism.
<br><br>
It seemed that every tribulation caused much destruction, and Zen couldn't help but flinch at the sight of these.
<br><br>
Chapter 3616 The Book In the 77th civilization, there were three major sects above the many regions of stars. They were the Human Sect, the Interception Sect, and the Enlightenment Sect.
<br><br>
The person in front of Zen now was the leader of the Enlightenment Sect, the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"I have a general understanding of the history of the human race, sir," Zen offered.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "Do you know why we sowed human seeds in this round of chaos?"
<br><br>
Zen lowered his head, thinking for a moment. "It is said that this round of chaos is the last chance to complete the Finale Way," he replied.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded once again. "Right. You know enough. The human race already failed once. We had to retreat to the Other Shore after the failure, but we have never feared anyone! The human race was born in the 77th civilization. Before that, the 76 ruling civilizations had already established their foothold on the Other Shore. It was not easy for the human race to fight for a place, but our master led us all the way up."
<br><br>
"Your master?" Zen looked confused.
<br><br>
The jade slips didn't record who the Primeval Lord of Heaven's master was.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that the leaders of the three major sects had had the same master.
<br><br>
The strength of the Primeval Lord of Heaven might have surpassed that of the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization. The strength of the three leaders' master must have been even greater.
<br><br>
"The records about my master have been erased by me. The memories related to him can't appear in the mind of any creature on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Even I can no longer recall what he even looked like," the Primeval Lord of Heaven admitted.
<br><br>
"That explains it! That's why only nine people were recorded to have attempted completion of the Finale Way, when there should have been ten,"
<br><br>
Zen exclaimed.
<br><br>
From the memories, he had seen the human race embark on the Finale Way and fight against that needle.
<br><br>
King Manard had once mentioned that the human race was well-prepared with a variety of methods to complete the Finale Way. Compared to them, the solution of the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization actually only ranked eighth.
<br><br>
He had said that there had been ten methods carried out by ten people, but from the memories presented by the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Zen had only seen nine.
<br><br>
Zen initially thought that King Manard must have been mistaken, but it turned out he was right. A memory had just been hidden.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was an intelligent man. He keenly caught the implication of Zen's words. "You know there really were ten people. How?"
<br><br>
Zen cleared his throat awkwardly. After hesitating for a moment, Zen decided to tell the truth. "I've heard from someone else that ten people were appointed to complete the Finale Way. The one who came the closest to doing it was known as the human ancestor. It's said that the Other Shore Tokens he used were the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone."
<br><br>
Every single word King Manard had said at that time was committed to Zen's memory, although he had never seen these aforementioned Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
"Who did you hear this from?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
King Manard had entrusted Zen to look for the human race on the Other Shore. In a way, Zen had found them. There was no need to hide anything.
<br><br>
"He is also a member of the 77th civilization, but he is not on the Other Shore," Zen said truthfully.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was completely taken aback by this. "What? That's impossible!"
<br><br>
The disbelief showed clearly on his face.
<br><br>
As a member of the 77th civilization, he naturally knew of the fate of the human race then.
<br><br>
And what he knew was that the humans of the 77th civilization who had not entered the Other Shore had died and had become a part of the chaos.
<br><br>
Most of those who entered the Other Shore, excluding the top masters, were also now dead or injured. They hid whatever was left of their waning existence in Stage Thirty Three.
<br><br>
Humans like Zen were the fruit of seeds the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the two other leaders quietly planted.
<br><br>
Thus, no other human was known to exist outside these three groups.
<br><br>
Seeing the Primeval Lord of Heaven's shocked expression, Zen couldn't help but smile. It was an unexpected sight on a person he deeply admired.
<br><br>
"No, he really does come from the 77th civilization, sir. He was only able to avoid the destruction of the chaos by accident."
<br><br>
"By accident? How?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven pressed, truly amazed.
<br><br>
"The Son of Truth of the 77th chaos had exiled him into a unique space,"
<br><br>
said Zen.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded as realization dawned on him. "That unique space is called the Land of Ashes. The Son of Truth you are talking about must have been a Red Cloud Beast, which was in opposition to the human race at the time. They had exiled many people, including my son.
<br><br>
But the Land of Ashes is emptied every once in a while, and everything in it is purged, so how could anyone survive that?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven's exiled son had disappeared in such a purge, so they were never able to reunite on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"That's what I heard, too. He not only avoided it but actually caused such purges to cease. Since the 77th civilization, everything that is thrown into that space has been preserved. He even calls the shots there now," Zen replied.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled through his astonishment. "If he was exiled by the Red Cloud Beast, he must have been someone of note. May I know his name?"
<br><br>
"He goes by King Manard," Zen replied.
<br><br>
"King Manard?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was puzzled. He prided himself for his retentive memory. But he remembered no such person.
<br><br>
Zen nodded at the confused look on the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face.
<br><br>
"When I was reading your memories, I did note that King Manard was not there. But I encountered him when I was exiled to the Land of Ashes myself. It was he who asked me to look for you."
<br><br>
Zen began to detail all he had experienced and learned in the Land of Ashes.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't seem surprised hearing about the Abstruse Energy World. It seemed he was already aware of it.
<br><br>
His eyes shone brightly after Zen finished retelling his encounter with King Manard. "So, he actually wants to create another Other Shore! Haha!"
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, because of the limitations of the rules, King Manard can't enter the chaos, nor can he enter the Other Shore. I can, however. If you want to send him a message, I can relay it for you," said Zen.
<br><br>
"No need to hurry," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. With this, he waved his hand.
<br><br>
Their surroundings dissolved in an instant. The stars and the world turned into nothingness. Zen was left feeling like he was just awakening from a dream.
<br><br>
He was back in the center of the temple hall. Elvinia and the human woman were nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
"Young man, come here," called a voice from the statue in the center.
<br><br>
It was the statue of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, whom Zen had just met in the illusion. He began to realize the other statues around him must be sentient as well.
<br><br>
Zen walked up to the statue of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the hand of which now held up a book.
<br><br>
Chapter 3617 How Many Do You Have Upon entry to the Creation Myth Temple, the Moon Fire Slaves wanted to grab the book.
<br><br>
However, that plan was cut short when the Primeval Lord of Heaven killed the Moon Fire Slaves with a single finger.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen knew that the book was probably one of a kind. "You seem to have cultivated several Truths of Godly Ways, right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, there are three Truths of Godly Ways in total," Zen answered with a nod.
<br><br>
In reality, he had cultivated five Truths of Godly Ways.
<br><br>
The only thing was that the Truth of Three-Energy Construction and his physical body's Truth of Godly Way could not carry the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Now, he had already guessed that the Primeval Lord of Heaven intended to ask him to fuse with that book.
<br><br>
"This book is the Civilization Artifact of our human race. You can fuse with it by means of the Truth of Cultivation Nature," the Primeval Lord of Heaven stated.
<br><br>
"Well, it..." At that moment, Zen began to hesitate.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid it's not appropriate." "Why? Do you know the meaning of the Civilization Artifact?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven questioned with a smile.
<br><br>
Not many races could leave Civilization Artifacts behind on the Other Shore. That was why the Primeval Lord of Heaven thought that Zen didn't know the meaning of the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"I know," Zen answered.
<br><br>
Aside from being an authoritative figure, the Primeval Lord of Heaven also had a vast knowledge and abundant experience.
<br><br>
Thus, his understanding of the Other Shore and the chaos should be far better than that of the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527.
<br><br>
Not to mention the function of the human race's Civilization Artifact, it would already be a good thing for him if he could have the Primeval Lord of Heaven's guidance! "Then why is it not appropriate?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Because my Truth of Cultivation Nature has already carried another Civilization Artifact," Zen replied.
<br><br>
After the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard those words, the eyebrows of his lifelike statue slightly shot up.
<br><br>
Truth be told, the test of the Creation Myth Temple wasn't very strict because only one Other Shore Key was given out, and there was only one chance to choose a suitable person.
<br><br>
Therefore, many of the powerful warriors in the civilization met with Zen.
<br><br>
Most of them followed the same rule to do so, and some of them even took the opportunity to teach him a theurgy.
<br><br>
It could also be said that they subconsciously did not take Zen's strength seriously.
<br><br>
After all, the human civilization in the past was a civilization where talents were born for generations. In the following rounds of chaos, however, it was almost impossible to produce a talent like them.
<br><br>
Yet, here was Zen, who had surprised the Primeval Lord of Heaven once again with his answer.
<br><br>
Whatever civilization that could hide on the Other Shore must be a strong ruling one, but even so, it was difficult for a ruling civilization to reach the higher stages.
<br><br>
Still, a civilization that could make a Civilization Artifact was already considered extremely powerful! All in all, was such a civilization really willing to choose this young man from the human race? "Which civilization does the Civilization Artifact belong to?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked again.
<br><br>
"The Regal Jade Civilization," replied Zen.
<br><br>
Once again, Zen's answer took the Primeval Lord of Heaven aback.
<br><br>
It was true that when the Regal Jade Civilization was at its peak, it was one of the ten great civilizations.
<br><br>
"It is a great opportunity for you to obtain a Civilization Artifact," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a nod. "Fortunately, the Civilization Artifact is rather complicated, and there usually are more than one Truth of Godly Way that it can match with. If you have cultivated the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, you can use it to bear this Civilization Artifact too."
<br><br>
A red flush rose on Zen's flustered face. He simply said, "Well, my Truth of Goodwill and Malice also carries a Civilization Artifact..."
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization still released tasks every day and night. Since Zen had been quite busy recently, he had not paid attention to it.
<br><br>
But when necessary, it was completely fine to extract several thousand divine megatons of force from it.
<br><br>
The corners of the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes slightly twitched in shock when he heard Zen's words.
<br><br>
To fuse with one Civilization Artifact was already a great blessing for anyone. Yet, this man in front of him had already fused with two Civilization Artifacts, and now he was going to fuse with the third...
<br><br>
Just then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven turned his head and his gaze fell on Chiyou's statue.
<br><br>
Chiyou's statue glowed with a red light, and all of the three heads had a gentle smile.
<br><br>
Although the seeds they had sowed failed to meet their expectation, he was a little proud that such a young man had appeared in the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Furthermore, even though he was not Chiyou in the Source World, the blood of the Nine Li race that Zen had inherited was genuine! "Then you only have the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent left," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. Then, this time he cautiously asked, "Has this Truth of Godly Way fused with another Other Shore Token?"
<br><br>
"No. The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent carries the Strength God Totem.
<br><br>
This Other Shore Token needs to be replaced," Zen answered.
<br><br>
"Perfect! Let's begin to bear the Civilization Artifact now," the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed.
<br><br>
With a wave of the Primeval Lord of Heaven's hand, both Elvinia and the human woman were thrown out of the starry illusion not far away.
<br><br>
He glanced coldly at the woman and said, "I won't kill you not only because the rules prevent me from doing so. Though I can't kill you inside the temple, it's still easy to trap you to death with the illusion."
<br><br>
Naturally, the woman was shocked and her face was immediately drained of color.
<br><br>
She knew that they couldn't kill her in the Creation Myth Temple, but the illusion was under their control. There must be many other ways to deal with her, but she still foolishly went inside the illusion...
<br><br>
"The Snake Goddess has already told you what you need to know.
<br><br>
Remember to relay those words to my junior fellow disciple. You can leave now," the Primeval Lord of Heaven hissed.
<br><br>
After the human woman had passed the tests of six desires, she met the energy soul of the Snake Goddess. Since the two of them were members of the same race, the Snake Goddess was clearly the suitable being to inform the woman of those words.
<br><br>
Before the human woman left, she looked at Zen with an unreadable expression. She wanted to remember his appearance.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, his figure was blurry so she couldn't see him clearly. Sadness filled her heart, and she walked out of the Creation Myth Temple.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen was also dumbfounded.
<br><br>
The junior fellow disciple of the Primeval Lord of Heaven? Based on the memories that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had given him, he knew that he had a senior fellow disciple and a junior fellow disciple. His senior fellow disciple was the leader of the Human Sect, and his junior fellow disciple was the leader of the Interception Sect, Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
'Did the Grandmaster of Heaven betray the human race on the Other Shore and become a member of the Nihility race?' Zen guessed.
<br><br>
As his thoughts flooded his mind, the human woman was already gone.
<br><br>
Then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven held the blue book in his hand and gently raised it towards the sky.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom..."
<br><br>
There was a deep rumbling sound as the entire temple began to shake.
<br><br>
The strategy the human race had chosen was quite similar to that of the Regal Jade Civilization, but there was also an essential difference between them.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization hid in the lower stage.
<br><br>
The human race was even stronger, so they stood on Stage Seventeen. In fact, those large races still didn't have an effective way to deal with the temple of the human race! On the other hand, Elvinia felt quite tense when she saw what happened around her. Her lips quivered nervously as she walked towards Zen.
<br><br>
She had passed the tests of six desires as well, and also saw Emperor Charm afterwards.
<br><br>
He was the man who shared the same bloodline as her. As always, his handsome face was pleasant and enchanting.
<br><br>
Even though Elvinia had the bloodline of the Sun Crow race, she resented and loathed them very much.
<br><br>
Chapter 3618 Leaving Fortunately for Emperor Charm, he had already heard some news from Zen and guessed the reason for Elvinia's disgust towards them.
<br><br>
Therefore, he asked her who she would like to see.
<br><br>
Among the thirty-nine statues, the only person that Elvinia was willing to see was the statue of his father—Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
In turn, Emperor Charm transferred her to the Starry Sword Region, where she had met her "father." After that, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had even taught her a theurgy of swordsmanship before she left.
<br><br>
But after she had departed from the starry illusion, she was still in a trance.
<br><br>
This "Eastern Emperor Taiyi" had a better understanding of swordsmanship than her father. She didn't know if he knew about it, so she was determined to tell him about it when she could leave the Other Shore this time.
<br><br>
Thud, thud, thud… Meanwhile, the temple continued to rumble, and everything inside it began to peel off and crack! Bang! A stone pillar in the corner of the hall exploded, but a space floated within it. Inside the space were towns and mountains, as if it had formed a world of its own. In addition, there were also people from the 77th civilization.
<br><br>
It turned out that after the humans had decreased most of their forces, the majority of the humans on the Other Shore entered hidden spaces.
<br><br>
Whoosh! At that moment, the space flew to the book.
<br><br>
Boom! Another stone pillar shattered, and the space hidden inside it rushed into the book too.
<br><br>
After eighteen stone pillars were destroyed in a row, eighteen spaces showed up. It seemed the world of the human civilization was bigger than that of the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
When the eighteen spaces rushed into the book, the statues also broke, and all the energy souls quickly rushed into the book as well! The Civilization Artifact of the humans was similar to that of the Regal Jade Civilization, but there were some key differences between them.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and all the other powerful masters had their real bodies in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Their presence now was just in the form of their energy souls, which was a bit like the form of No. 9527.
<br><br>
Besides that group of thirty-nine people, the book had also absorbed most of the 77th civilization's possessions! On the contrary, such was not the case with the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade City was still located in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. Nevertheless, Zen could still borrow many divine megatons of force from it through the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
The big difference between the two Civilization Artifacts was because after Zen had visited the thirty-nine heroes, he had gotten their full trust! Swish, swish, swish… The book was like a bottomless black hole.
<br><br>
The huge temple continued to collapse due to the constant absorption. The whole scene looked like a process of a building being weathered by time, as its fragments quickly flowed into the book.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before Zen, Elvinia, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were the only ones who stood there. The temple had already disappeared, and only the remnants of its foundation were left.
<br><br>
Both Zen and Elvinia had seen the temple's foundation when they had first found the temple. Now, if it wasn't for the statue of the the Primeval Lord of Heaven nearby, Zen would've thought that it was only a dream.
<br><br>
"Bear it!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! At that point, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's statue began to weather as well.
<br><br>
His energy soul rushed into the book, and the book floated towards Zen.
<br><br>
Zen took the book in his hand and looked at it for a while, before he handed it to Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Why?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice came from within the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
Since the book was now a Civilization Artifact and was given to Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven naturally didn't want it to be in another person's hands.
<br><br>
"My corporeal body can't bear the Other Shore Token. Only when my soul returns to the Other Shore can I bear it," Zen explained.
<br><br>
He clearly couldn't change the rules on the Other Shore, so he could only ask Elvinia to help him pass this Other Shore Token to his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
After Elvinia put the book into the Sumeru Space, they turned to leave the area.
<br><br>
Compared to entering the Creation Myth Temple, leaving it was much easier.
<br><br>
Once Zen and Elvinia were gone, the three circular areas turned into a gobi, a grassland, and a desert.
<br><br>
In any case, Zen had no intention of staying in Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. When everything was done, he and Elvinia went north along the junction of the desert and the grassland.
<br><br>
However, not long after they went a certain distance, Zen saw a few fistsized caves not far away. Those caves glowed with bean-sized lights. They were none other than the Extremity Mice, which were ordered about by the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In the blink of an eye, Zen dashed forward and headed straight for those caves.
<br><br>
When the Extremity Mice that hid in the caves saw who had come for them, they burrowed even deeper inside.
<br><br>
The Nihility race would most likely not give up on the temple. Thus, there might be huge trouble if he let these Extremity Mice monitor their whole journey.
<br><br>
He stretched out his hands and grasped on the ground. Many divine megatons of force suddenly blew up, and then slammed down heavily against the caves.
<br><br>
Smash! All the caves below the area collapsed under the immense pressure, so these Extremity Mice naturally had a hard time escaping.
<br><br>
The caves these Extremity Mice had dug were very complicated. If Zen relied on his strength alone, it would be nearly impossible for him to clear all of them up.
<br><br>
But once the caves in this area were sealed, he spread out his thunder wings, took Elvinia in his arms, and leapt up high in the air. Finally, they flew west in the direction of the grassland, then moved towards the north.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the human woman dragged her snake tail and traveled towards the northeast. Under the guidance of the Extremity Mice, she entered a cave which was more than a shoulder wide.
<br><br>
At the bottom of the underground caves was the headquarters of the Extremity Mice.
<br><br>
Although the Extremity Mice were intelligent creatures, it was hard to find anything pleasant in their living environment.
<br><br>
Their place reeked of some strange and pungent smells that made her want to vomit.
<br><br>
After they passed through the underground caves for several thousand feet, the path in front of them eventually widened.
<br><br>
Something appeared in front of her. It was a shiny golden snake! The Nihility race had originally placed the golden snake there. After the Extremity Mice had seen Zen and the Moon Fire Slaves earlier, they had relied on this golden snake to pass on the news for them.
<br><br>
Just then, the woman reached out her hand and gently stroked the golden snake's head.
<br><br>
The golden snake, which appeared to be carved out of gold, suddenly opened its eyes and stick out its tongue.
<br><br>
Hiss, hiss… After the golden snake confirmed the woman's identity, it circled around her body.
<br><br>
Aside from being used to convey information, the golden snake could also tell if the person who had sent the information was lying.
<br><br>
When the snake was done circling around the woman, its head approached her and said in a strange voice, "Has the temple opened?" "It's opened..."
<br><br>
the woman replied.
<br><br>
"Did you see them?" the strange voice from the snake's mouth asked rather excitedly. "Yes, I did, but I was driven out," the woman answered in a low voice.
<br><br>
A heavy silence filled the air.
<br><br>
This time, not only did she lose a Nihility Spirit, but she also absolutely failed her mission.
<br><br>
Hiss! The golden snake that was wrapping around the woman suddenly shrunk and let out an ear-piercing sound.
<br><br>
Even though this woman came from a high stage, it was hard for her to resist such a tight force, especially when her strength was subdued by this stage. At that moment, her body emitted several cracking sounds.
<br><br>
Of course, the sound came from her bones that broke inside her body.
<br><br>
Chapter 3619 Carrying The Book The woman's face was contorted in agony. Still, she made no sound.
<br><br>
This was a punishment she was willing to bear.
<br><br>
There were surely more severe punishments waiting for her in the higher stage.
<br><br>
The golden snake tightened its grip on her. "You don't have to return for the time being."
<br><br>
"Why?" the woman had to ask, through the pain.
<br><br>
She had been convinced the golden snake would ask her to get that Civilization Artifact back.
<br><br>
Not that she could. She would be facing the two strongest fighters in Stage Seventeen whom she was no match for. That man must have already gotten the Civilization Artifact. How could she snatch it from him? "Go to the lower stages and find a human called the Evil God. He is a Soul of Light," the golden snake said.
<br><br>
The woman gritted her teeth at this. Her strength diminished with every lower stage she would cross. It was a slow torture.
<br><br>
The pain she felt now would only be heightened in the lower stages.
<br><br>
Every fiber of her being screamed in refusal, but she knew she had no choice. "What do you need a Soul of Light for?"
<br><br>
She had nothing but scorn for her fellow humans in the Source World. In her eyes, they were just failed clones of the 77th civilization.
<br><br>
"Lead him into the Chilling Bone Land," the golden snake instructed.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
The woman was taken aback.
<br><br>
Every civilization and every large race had secrets hidden on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race, the Nihility race, and even the human race all had their secrets. The Chilling Bone Land was one of those.
<br><br>
"A Soul of Light in the Chilling Bone Land?" the woman asked, hesitantly.
<br><br>
Even she was not qualified to cultivate in the Chilling Bone Land. How would some unknown human be able to enter it so easily? "Do as I said. Find him as soon as possible. Failure is not an option.
<br><br>
Otherwise, you know what awaits you!"
<br><br>
The woman's blood froze at the golden snake's threat.
<br><br>
With those words, the golden light in the snake's eyes dimmed. It loosened its grip on the woman's body.
<br><br>
Finally able to catch her breath, the woman frowned as she mulled over the latest orders given to her. She took one last look at the Extremity Mice around before entering another small cave.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, somewhere in the midlands of Stage Seventeen, Zen hid Elvinia's physical body for safety before they retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Instead of walking out of the cultivation room, he began to fuse with the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
The aura of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent slowly spread out, and the book slowly descended in his inner world.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The Primeval Lord of Heaven flew out of the book and hovered high in the sky.
<br><br>
His eyebrows knitted together as he looked down.
<br><br>
"Why is this inner world a primitive land?" Another figure floated out of the book. It was Zhurong, one of the 39 statues.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The energy souls rushed out of the book one after another, taking in their surroundings.
<br><br>
Like the Primeval Lord of Heaven, they were puzzled at the state of Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
They had never heard of an inner world turning into a primitive land.
<br><br>
"Interesting! How was this guy able to do this?" Fuxi asked as he scanned the landscape.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess next to him shook her head. She fixed her gaze on the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "This primitive land is..."
<br><br>
"We have to fight for the Source World," the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly pronounced, interrupting the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Zen overheard the conversation clearly, his manifestation floating near the others. So they still wanted to do battle for the Source World.
<br><br>
As Zen absorbed the implication of these words, the Primeval Lord of Heaven turned to look at him. "Why is your inner world like this?"
<br><br>
Zen didn't need to hide anything. With a sheepish smile, he briefly explained the Primal Chaos Technique and his master Bromley.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit had also been perplexed when he first saw this primitive land.
<br><br>
He knew well of the primitive land, but it had been his first time to actually see an inner world like it.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven turned over what Zen said in his mind.
<br><br>
He had an idea what this primitive land meant, but he was uncertain. In the end, he waved the thought away. He looked at Zen steadily. "Carry the book and we will help you!"
<br><br>
Zen did not hesitate to do so. It was easy to carry the book under the protection of the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Chains wrapped around the book. It was thus ready to be borne.
<br><br>
The three Civilization Artifacts now hovered side by side, emitting an indescribable aura.
<br><br>
Just then, a figure floated up toward the assembly. It was Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Geoffrey greeted his father with a smile before continuing toward the artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
A mechanical voice piped up from the artifact. "The earth-level third-class task: occupy and expand the Crimson Divine Kingdom..."
<br><br>
"Task accepted!" Geoffrey responded promptly.
<br><br>
Buzz! With a beam of light, the Civilization Artifact designated the task to Geoffrey. With this accomplished, Geoffrey cupped his hands and bowed to Zen before flying away excitedly.
<br><br>
All this time, Zen hadn't paid much attention to his inner world. He closed his eyes now and focused. All memories of Geoffrey's activities in his inner world flashed across his mind.
<br><br>
It was only then that he realized Geoffrey was undergoing cultivation in a special way.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had taken the Regal Jade Spirit as his teacher and had been working very hard to cultivate in Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
However, he had yet to reach the Other Shore Realm in this way. The bodyrefining cultivation method the Regal Jade Spirit taught him was exceptionally mysterious. The warriors below the consummation of True God Realm might be no match for him, but he was still much weaker than the powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had chanced upon the cubic object floating in the sky one day, and discovered that it had been issuing tasks nonstop.
<br><br>
Some of the tasks sounded inconceivable, far beyond what Geoffrey could do.
<br><br>
Some tasks, however, were simple and could be completed in the inner world. Geoffrey had accepted one of the tasks and completed it. To his amazement, the cubic object actually improved the power of his physical body as a reward! Geoffrey took advantage of this easy method to improve.
<br><br>
All this time, he had been receiving the tasks released by the Civilization Artifact almost every day and night. With the completion of each task, his physical body and strength became more and more powerful. He now could release 30 divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
This amount of power was just normal for Zen, of course.
<br><br>
But it was enough to qualify Geoffrey to become a Flag Master in the Dragon City.
<br><br>
Geoffrey hadn't even stepped into the Sea of Truth yet.
<br><br>
As Zen was lost in his thoughts, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other energy souls sized up the other two Civilization Artifacts.
<br><br>
Every Civilization Artifact represented the civilization behind it. The Primeval Lord of Heaven had been raring to meet the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
But they soon found they couldn't communicate with the Heavenly Obsession Civilization at all.
<br><br>
Chapter 3620 Confusions The Regal Jade Spirit was glad to see the human beings arrive.
<br><br>
He had learned about powerful human warriors from King Manard. They were a race that had almost disappeared on the Other Shore, and were once powerful enough to contend with the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Most importantly, they shared the same interests as the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
After speaking with him, the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked Zen to release the people from within the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
There were a total of eighteen independent spaces in the Creation Myth Temple and hundreds of thousands of people in each space. A considerable amount of them were born on the Other Shore, but nearly half of them came from the 77th civilization.
<br><br>
These were not the most powerful humans at the time, yet they still held high positions.
<br><br>
Zen obliged the Primeval Lord of Heaven. However, since so many humans would be added to his body, he required a new space.
<br><br>
With a flash of his mind, in the distance, the chaotic sea began trembling.
<br><br>
From beneath the water's surface, a gigantic mound of some sorts broke through, splashing water in all directions as it emerged. Just like that, a new continent came into being.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, please place the spaces there, on that new continent," requested Zen.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven waved his hand gently and the pages of the book began flipping over. The eighteen spaces descended from the sky onto the continent. Humans began walking out in small groups, looking around the new world with varying reactions.
<br><br>
Energy souls, such as Fuxi, Chiyou and Gonggong, flew down and guided their respective clansmen.
<br><br>
Now that they had been assigned to this continent by Zen, naturally, they would rebuild their homeland here.
<br><br>
These people had been hiding in the temple for too long. Since the humans lost, most of the weaker ones had been hiding in the spaces in the Creation Myth Temple. After countless years, they were finally able to see the light of day again, so it was only natural to have mixed feelings about it.
<br><br>
Looking at the humans brought up some questions for Zen.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, as far as I know, my inner world is a primitive land. So these humans should be viewed as returning from the Other Shore to the chaos, right?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
As a leader of the humans, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was extremely knowledgeable.
<br><br>
But Zen's question stunned him, left him trapped.
<br><br>
In principle, the Other Shore and the chaos were two worlds separated from each other.
<br><br>
Once someone entered the Other Shore, there was no way back.
<br><br>
During the past more than a thousand chaotic eras, the creatures on the Other Shore had tried to influence one civilization after the other, but none of them had come to the chaos.
<br><br>
This truth had still not changed thus far.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had used a loophole on the Other Shore to let humans' seeds descend. Other races had done the same thing, causing the chaotic phenomena in this round of chaotic era.
<br><br>
However, all they sent down were seeds, not their real bodies.
<br><br>
Even though the true body of the Primeval Lord of Heaven was incredibly powerful, once he left the Other Shore for real, he would be killed by the truth in an instant. No other possibility existed.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven paused a moment before nodding and saying, "Indeed."
<br><br>
"The primitive land and the inner world are two different concepts. Every primitive land is located in the chaos. Of course, we are coming to the chaos," the Snake Goddess chimed in from the side.
<br><br>
"But why didn't the truth punish them?" Zen asked, somewhat confused.
<br><br>
Carefully thinking back, he realized that his inner world had been a "primitive land" for a long time. That meant, as soon as he carried the first Other Shore Token, he had brought something from the Other Shore to the chaos.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven narrowed his eyes and thought a while, a bitter smile forming.
<br><br>
The Source World was another primitive land, but it did not serve as anyone's inner world. It was the countless creatures in the Source World that carried the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
It was certainly the first time he had met an exception such as Zen, and so he had no answer for him.
<br><br>
"Perhaps it's because this place is not connected to the outside world. If it is really connected to the chaos, we energy souls, and them, and even the Other Shore Tokens will not survive," the Snake Goddess speculated.
<br><br>
"It's indeed possible," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
From this point of view, entering Zen's inner world was not advantageous.
<br><br>
It might in fact cause unforeseen trouble.
<br><br>
"Then what should we do?" Zen asked now frowning as well.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven offered some words with a faint smile, "Don't worry. Every problem has a solution. A primitive land has its own significance. Since such a primitive land came into being within your body, there will naturally be a solution. Let's take it easy and find it."
<br><br>
He was very fond of exploring unsolved mysteries, and this was the purpose of his Enlightenment Sect as well. He had already lived unimaginably long, and yet he still explored everything he could tirelessly.
<br><br>
"You're right." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
His inner world was situated in a corner of the chaos. It wasn't large, and the chances of it being found were slight. There was no need to worry.
<br><br>
In Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, the Evil God received a message from Shera. It told him to wait at the foot of the Heavenly River Mountain in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In the past he would not have obeyed an order from Shera.
<br><br>
In fact, he had disobeyed her many times in his brief stint on the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Right now though, he was left with no other choice. He had to stay on the Other Shore in exchange for a brief window of freedom.
<br><br>
After receiving the order, the Evil God passed through the energy whirlpool and headed straight for the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Zen had reserved soul crystal for the Evil God in the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
He hadn't meant to use it at first. He could strengthen himself by simply devouring souls, so it was not an urgent need. Besides, he did not want to owe Zen a favor.
<br><br>
But if he left on his own without receiving the soul crystal, he feared that Zen would be suspicious.
<br><br>
As Zen's Inner-world Generating Avatar, any of his mistakes would destroy him.
<br><br>
The Evil God absorbed the soul crystal and left the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Exploring Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore was common for a Soul of Light and so drew no suspicion.
<br><br>
He arrived at the foot of the Heavenly River Mountain and waited there patiently.
<br><br>
He had always been very confident, but this time he wasn't sure if he could escape Zen's control.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
He had been waiting a while when he heard furious rumblings of beasts' hooves thundering from the mountain, as if thousands of horses ran wild.
<br><br>
He raised his head to see a group of unicorns galloping down the mountain road not far away.
<br><br>
His soul was powerful to be sure, but it was still difficult for him to face the fierce beasts on the Other Shore head on.
<br><br>
Escape was the only thought on his mind.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to take a step forward, he felt as if his feet were nailed to the ground and he was unable to move.
<br><br>
"Illusion Breaking Rune!"
<br><br>
Recognizing something was wrong, the Evil God immediately chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune in an attempt to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But just as he opened his mouth, a green thread wrapped around his Soul of Light. That was an exceptionally thin Soul Binding Thread.
<br><br>
Chapter 3621 Fake Memories Boom! Boom! Boom! Hundreds of unicorns rushed towards the Evil God. If he were to be trapped underneath their stomping hooves, he would surely die.
<br><br>
"Illusion Breaking Rune!"
<br><br>
Signaled by his loud chant, his Soul of Light flashed brightly and tried to escape from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, the green thread firmly bound his Soul of Light to the Other Shore. As powerful as the Evil God was, he couldn't break the thread's hold.
<br><br>
Once the Evil God saw the herd of unicorns draw closer with each gallop, various thoughts raced through his mind.
<br><br>
Amid his despair, something unexpected happened—the herd rushed towards either side of the Evil God to avoid trampling him. It was almost as if they were frightened by something.
<br><br>
"This..."
<br><br>
The Evil God stared dumbfounded at the scene playing out before him. He had no idea what was happening.
<br><br>
"The souls wandering on the Other Shore are too fragile. Haha..."
<br><br>
A scornful voice mocked.
<br><br>
A woman suddenly appeared not too far away from him, half of her body wrapped within a red ball.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" the Evil God asked, his voice severe.
<br><br>
He had always gone on a rampage on the Other Shore. Apart from showing restraint on Stage Eleven, he portrayed even more aggressive than Zen.
<br><br>
But the woman in front of him gave him the feeling that she was probably the most threatening person he had met here! "Who am I? You don't have to know," she replied coldly.
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, a powerful aura burst out of the Evil God's Soul of Light. The aura held a force that brought about an intent to kill, like a sword that eagerly waited to slash and slaughter.
<br><br>
This aura would be enough to easily injure any opponent with an ordinary Soul of Light.
<br><br>
This woman before him, on the other hand, was anything but ordinary. He made sure not to make a fool out of himself and proceeded with every interaction with her cautiously.
<br><br>
He decided that he couldn't afford to provoke an opponent he knew nothing about and risk too much. The aura burst for a split second before dissipating as if it had never existed.
<br><br>
This left the mysterious woman shocked.
<br><br>
No ordinary person would have enough power to burst out such a killing intent.
<br><br>
All who were qualified to enter the Chilling Bone Land possessed exceptional talents.
<br><br>
This man had the power that qualified him to enter the Chilling Bone Land with the mere form of Soul of Light, perhaps he had immeasurable value, the woman thought.
<br><br>
Remembering her leader's words, she sighed inwardly and finally replied, "You may call me Sienna. I've been ordered to escort you to the Chilling Bone Land."
<br><br>
"Chilling Bone Land? What is that? Will it help me get rid of my position as the Inner-world Generating Avatar of another person?" he asked her all at once.
<br><br>
As long as he was Zen's Inner-world Generating Avatar, he wouldn't be able to live peacefully.
<br><br>
If the place the woman mentioned was only about lucky chances to improve his strength or locations to hidden treasures, he could search for them on his own. What mattered more to him was an opportunity to escape the control of Zen.
<br><br>
"Inner-world Generating Avatar..." After Sienna heard this, realization dawned on her. No wonder the leader asked her to take him to the Chilling Bone Land.
<br><br>
Getting rid of the role of an Inner-world Generating Avatar would be difficult, but certainly not impossible in the Chilling Bone Land.
<br><br>
Utilizing the Chilling Bone Land to solve the Evil God's problem would be feasible, but this would still be simply making a mountain out of a molehill.
<br><br>
"Will going there help me or not?" he asked as he stared at Sienna. He sensed hope in the expression she portrayed.
<br><br>
"Yes, it will help you," she nodded in assurance.
<br><br>
The Evil God placed his defensive guard down. He even gave the woman a respectful bow before excitedly pleading, "If you'd be so kind as to lead me there, I'd be very grateful!"
<br><br>
This was probably the only time he remembered acting so courteous to someone throughout his entire life.
<br><br>
Slightly smug at the success of her offer, she replied, "Follow me to the upper stages."
<br><br>
As the red ball wrapped around the lower part of her body began to float, she flew up to the mountain, the Evil God tailing behind her.
<br><br>
Just as they arrived in front of the star ring, the Evil God's expression suddenly changed.
<br><br>
Sienna turned around and noticed the strange change in the Evil God. "Is something wrong?" she asked.
<br><br>
"Someone is forcing me to wake up," the Evil God said nervously.
<br><br>
This trip would help determine whether he could finally be free or not.
<br><br>
Once extremely arrogant and fearless, the Evil God now found himself restrained and humbled by the opportunity.
<br><br>
No one would normally wake up a warrior cultivating on the Other Shore unless a major change was about to occur or there was something of great importance to discuss.
<br><br>
"You can make up an excuse. Tell them you've entered a temple and that you can't leave the Other Shore," Sienna suggested. Although she appeared to be compassionate, the truth was she just wanted to put aside her prejudice and get this task over with as soon as possible.
<br><br>
"That excuse won't be good enough." The Evil God shook his head. As soon as he entered the Myriad Spirits City, he had the feeling that Zen had complete control over Stage Fourteen. Thus, such a lie would soon be exposed.
<br><br>
"Then what do you want?" Sienna asked impatiently.
<br><br>
Although Zen couldn't perceive what the Evil God was doing on the Other Shore, he could still know it by reading his memories.
<br><br>
"Do you have any methods to change one's memories?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
He possessed the ability to wipe out memories, as well.
<br><br>
But there was one problem. Erasing memories would leave an obvious void within the Inner-world Generating Avatar's memories. This would likely cause Zen to be more suspicious.
<br><br>
Sienna shot the Evil God an impatient look. Reluctantly, she stuffed one of her arms into the red ball and pulled out what appeared to be a mini dipper.
<br><br>
"This," she continued, "is the Kaleidoscopic Golden Dipper. Whoever wields it has the power to create their own world within it—one that you can enter and change according to your will."
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes flashed open as wide as saucers. Without hesitation, he leaped into the Kaleidoscopic Golden Dipper.
<br><br>
Then he began to build various memories in his mind—him exploring Stage Thirteen, him crossing the energy vortex, him exploring a temple on Stage Fourteen, and more. At the same time, he erased his real memories of the journey on the Other Shore to deceive Zen.
<br><br>
He was worried that it was Zen who was trying to force him awake.
<br><br>
But he was wrong. At the time, the blaring of horns echoed throughout the entire Land of Sword Grief and in turn activated the array in front of each cultivation room.
<br><br>
Once activated, they woke up the people that resided within each secret cultivation room.
<br><br>
The disciples who were cultivating in seclusion or just roaming the Other Shore were all awakened.
<br><br>
Save for a few disciples who were within the temples and were unable to part from the Other Shore, those other disciples on the first to the third floor walked out of their cultivation rooms upon hearing the horns.
<br><br>
Zen had long retreated from the Other Shore and had been studying the Civilization Artifact of the human race.
<br><br>
At the sound of the blaring horns, he raised his eyebrows and then proceeded to open the door to his cultivation room. He witnessed many of the second-floor disciples gathering in the corridor with worried faces.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Are they gathering all the people in the Land of Sword Grief?"
<br><br>
"I'm afraid it's not that simple..."
<br><br>
The Land of Sword Grief's disciples were powerful forces in the Oneness Sky Palace. This meant that they could enjoy a quite relaxed environment for cultivation here.
<br><br>
As long as they could finish the challenge at the beginning of the month, they were free to come and go whenever they pleased. So to see them all gathered in one place was an unusual sight.
<br><br>
In the cultivation rooms on the third floor, the doors were opened.
<br><br>
There were only a dozen disciples on the third floor. Even outside the Oneness Sky Palace, these people were fully capable of fighting and defending themselves.
<br><br>
Even they appeared concerned upon hearing the horns.
<br><br>
"Click..."
<br><br>
To the far right of the third floor, the door to the No.1 cultivation room opened. A woman donning a plain robe walked out Chapter 3622 The Guts To Challenge As soon as the woman got out of her room, every disciple on the third floor turned their heads and focused their eyes on her. It was like a royalty suddenly appeared and graced them with her presence.
<br><br>
There were a total of thirteen disciples on the third floor, twelve of whom were all men. She was the only woman, and she was regarded as the top disciple.
<br><br>
Her attainments in martial arts surpassed each of the male disciples with a large margin.
<br><br>
It was said that she was a one in a million talent that no one in the past had ever surpassed, nor would anyone in the future.
<br><br>
Her name was Libby, the number one disciple of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
In terms of gender, she didn't really have a special advantage in cultivation.
<br><br>
However, when considering her age, she was the youngest amongst every disciple. On top of it, every disciple on the third floor was inferior to her in terms of strength.
<br><br>
"Oh Libby, have you finished your cultivation?" A handsome man quickly approached her. He was Gabriel Liu, the eldest son of the Bright Mountain's leader, and he ranked seventh among the disciples on the third floor.
<br><br>
"Where have you gone during your long secluded cultivation? I've been waiting for you in the Soul City but you never showed up," another man with a long hair asked as he tried to get her attention.
<br><br>
This person was Ahern Ming, the son of the Ivory Mountain's leader.
<br><br>
As soon as they saw Libby, these men flocked and circled her just to see her gallant face.
<br><br>
"I didn't go to the Other Shore during my cultivation," Libby answered perfunctorily in a cold tone.
<br><br>
"Then, did you make progress in your theurgy?" Gabriel inquired, trying to somehow change the awkward mood.
<br><br>
Libby shook her head as her eyes diverted to the outside of the building.
<br><br>
"We have to go now. Master Goran has arrived."
<br><br>
Immediately after she finished speaking, she took a gentle step forward.
<br><br>
In a flash, she had descended from the third floor to the front of the building, making it seem like the distance between the two spots was just a couple of steps away.
<br><br>
"Glad to see you again, Master Goran," Libby greeted politely.
<br><br>
"I'm happy to see you too, Libby," Goran replied with a broad smile across his face.
<br><br>
Libby was actually recommended by Goran to the Oneness Sky Palace, and since then, they considered her as a gift from heaven.
<br><br>
It wouldn't take much of her time to reach an equivalent status to that of Goran.
<br><br>
But with all her achievements, she had always treated Goran with the same utmost respect and politeness as in the older times.
<br><br>
As they continued in talking, the rest of the disciples from the third floor also jumped down from the windows and landed to where Libby and Goran were.
<br><br>
They approached Goran and greeted him while bowing down respectfully.
<br><br>
Soon after, the disciples from the second floor also came down.
<br><br>
Zen, who was among them, didn't exactly know what was happening, and just decided to follow his fellow disciples. As he saw who the reason for the commotion was, he hurriedly walked towards Goran with cupped hands and greeted him, "It's been a while, Master Goran!"
<br><br>
"Zen! I've heard that you already obtained first place among all disciples on the second floor now. That's incredible progress. You never failed to surprise me!" Goran didn't hold back on his praises.
<br><br>
As Oneness Governors, Goran and Athemar were tasked with a significant mission of searching for bright human talents.
<br><br>
The Sword Light Palace, which was founded by Athemar, had already recommended a large number of talents to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
However, despite the great number of disciples that they endorsed, only a few of them were considered to be outstanding.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Goran eyed for quality over quantity. He had only recommended a small number of disciples since then — one of whom was Libby. But with Libby's endorsement alone, Goran garnered a higher reputation than any of the other Oneness Governors.
<br><br>
Every time they would talk about Libby's achievements, even Athemar couldn't help but sigh in awe. It was a unanimous belief that Libby was probably the greatest disciple to exist since the establishment of the Oneness Sky Palace. It also came up in conversations that it might be just a matter of time before she became a mountain head.
<br><br>
Such an excellent disciple was truly unprecedented.
<br><br>
It was almost carved in stone that the Oneness Governors regarded that no one would ever be able to measure up to her.
<br><br>
However, all of that changed a few years ago when Goran met another promising disciple who had all the capabilities of surpassing even Libby.
<br><br>
That was Zen "So that's the disciple who suddenly ranked first on the second floor."
<br><br>
"Yeah, I've heard about him. On the first day that he joined the Land of Sword Grief, he became the top disciple on the first floor. Then, about two months later, he ranked first among the disciples on the second floor."
<br><br>
"It's kind of preposterous to say but… his progress is even faster than Libby's."
<br><br>
The disciples on the third floor had heard the news about Zen. However, since they rarely came out and halted in their cultivation, this was their first to actually see him in person.
<br><br>
In Libby's case, she was even more isolated from the outside world due to her long-term closed-door cultivation. Thus, it was her first time to even hear the name of Zen Luo.
<br><br>
For all those who were familiar with the overall prowess and capabilities of the disciples in there, it would be an otherworldly feat to reach the top of the first floor in a day and especially reach the top of the second floor in just two months.
<br><br>
No one would be able to deny that Zen's current progressing speed far surpassed that of Libby.
<br><br>
With this thought in mind, Libby turned her head and took a glance at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen, who was standing some meters away from her, politely nodded in reply as he noticed Libby's gaze directed at him.
<br><br>
He had essentially heard of Libby's name several times already on the arena, but he had no idea what kind of person she was or what she even looked like. That was why when he saw that she was actually a petite woman, he wasn't able to hide the hints of surprise in his eyes.
<br><br>
"Are you one of those disciples who have just returned from the Chaotic Source World?" Libby asked with a straight face.
<br><br>
She believed that Zen was definitely not a newcomer who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but someone who had joined the Land of Sword Grief by chance. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to achieve such a degree of improvement in a very short time.
<br><br>
"Yes, he is one of them," someone butted in before Zen could answer the question.
<br><br>
Upon hearing the unexpected answer, Libby's eyes flashed with a sullen look.
<br><br>
Libby was not born from a great family, but ever since she joined the Land of Sword Grief, she had always been treated like royalty.
<br><br>
Moreover, even the descendants of the mountain heads weren't given the same treatment that they were giving her.
<br><br>
However, this new disciple had managed to break her record in a manner that didn't even make it a close competition. Realizing all of this, she naturally felt displeased.
<br><br>
As an arrogant genius, she believed that even with all Zen's accomplishments, he wouldn't have the guts to challenge her. She provokingly asked, "The beginning of another month is coming soon. So are you going to challenge me?"
<br><br>
Neither Libby nor any of the other disciples on the third floor thought that Zen would even dare to do so.
<br><br>
It was not like he would be just facing a bunch of slightly powerful Roccos on the third floor.
<br><br>
Although Zen managed to easily defeat Rocco, who was supposedly the top disciple on the second floor before he came, the gap between the second and third floor disciples was extremely huge.
<br><br>
It was the primary reason why Rocco was still held back on the second floor for so long.
<br><br>
Then, unexpectedly, they heard a response in a nonchalant tone, "Yes, that's exactly what I want to do. Hope you don't mind."
<br><br>
It hadn't been long after Zen merged with the Civilization Artifact of the human race. He had been exploring the uses of the book he acquired.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven told Zen that he would grant various abilities into the book according to his needs.
<br><br>
In that book, there were the energy souls of the thirty-nine human heroes.
<br><br>
Although the energy souls were not as strong as their real presences, they had fully inherited their theurgies. Just imagining that all these abilities could be utilized through the book, any opponent during combat would surely tremble.
<br><br>
However, it was such a pity that Zen wasn't able to test the book's prowess on the arena in the Land of Sword Grief. However, Zen had also absorbed a large amount of Body-strengthening Jades. Though his physical body had not yet reached its limits, it wouldn't be long before he could have a breakthrough and reach the Wild God Body Realm.
<br><br>
'This will be a good chance to test the increase of power in my physical body.' This was the thought inside Zen's mind as he answered Libby's question with a straight face.
<br><br>
When it came to the competition to recognize the first place in the Land of Sword Grief, Zen didn't really pay much attention to it. He had a deeper goal in mind that was of more significance.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, his answer was obviously wrongly perceived by the disciples on the third floor. All they heard was a response from someone full of himself.
<br><br>
"Hey, did you hear that? He actually has the guts to challenge Libby!"
<br><br>
"I admit that he is a rare genius, but is he thinking that he could just really be on par with someone from the third floor? This guy is mocking us!"
<br><br>
"On top of that, of all the third floor disciples, he wanted to challenge Libby! What a sick joke!"
<br><br>
The male disciples from the third floor hurled out insults in response to Zen's misplaced confidence.
<br><br>
Their words reached Zen's ears, but he didn't seem to mind them in the slightest. "It's kind of funny because the disciples from the first and second floor said the exact same thing when I challenged Cleon and Rocco, and you knew what happened next. I wonder if you would still wear those smug faces, once I make you eat your words," Zen fired back with a subtle smirk.
<br><br>
Chapter 3623 The War Ahern snorted coldly as soon as Zen finished speaking. "Cleon and Rocco aren't powerful. How can those two good-for-nothings compare to Libby?"
<br><br>
His words weren't lost on Rocco and Cleon who were standing within earshot.
<br><br>
Both men's faces paled when they heard Ahern's words.
<br><br>
The two of them were famous in the Land of Sword Grief but here was Ahern, who readily sneered at them and easily branded them as 'good-fornothings'.
<br><br>
Cleon had an extraordinary background but it was nothing compared to Ahern who was a disciple on the third floor and was set to be a Oneness Governor in the future, hence why the latter did not take him seriously.
<br><br>
Zen's confidence also surprised Goran.
<br><br>
Did his cultivation increase in such a short period of time? Goran fixed his eyes on Zen and Libby. "I'm also looking forward to this challenge but I don't think today is the right time, as I have something important to announce."
<br><br>
Around ninety percent of the Land of Sword Grief's disciples were gathered in front of Goran.
<br><br>
What he was about to tell them was definitely no small matter since he gathered almost all of them here.
<br><br>
Once the chattering quieted down, everyone waited to hear what Goran had to say.
<br><br>
"The Mountain Viewing Province has been attacked and conquered," he announced.
<br><br>
This sudden news threw everyone in an uproar.
<br><br>
"Has the Grand River Fortress been captured?!"
<br><br>
"Impossible!"
<br><br>
"If the Mountain Viewing Province has been conquered, then does that mean..."
<br><br>
Multiple passes surrounded the province and though it wasn't as important on its own, it definitely provided the gateway to conquering other, bigger provinces. The Sun Crow race must know this when they chose to lay siege on the Mountain Viewing Province.
<br><br>
The shock was evident on Zen's face.
<br><br>
He had gone to the Mountain Viewing Province not long after entering the Dragon City. The Lofty Swords in the Grand River Fortress left a deep impression on him. He didn't think it was going to be conquered so easily.
<br><br>
"After the Sun Crow race took control of the Mountain Viewing Province, they quickly mobilized and conquered several nearby provinces. Right now, it seems they've arrived at the North Unicorn Province," Goran continued, further adding to everyone's distress.
<br><br>
"What?!"
<br><br>
"That fast?!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God!"
<br><br>
All disciples, from the first to the third floor, could only stand there in shock.
<br><br>
The North Unicorn Province was located right next to the Bloom Divine Province, which meant that the Oneness Sky Palace was next! None of them ever expected the Sun Crow race to move this fast.
<br><br>
Goran looked at all of them with a serious expression. "You are the members of the Land of Sword Grief and the Oneness Sky Palace. Now that things have come to this, I hope you can all rise up and protect the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bloom Divine Province!"
<br><br>
There were many provinces under the Oneness Sky Palace's jurisdiction but ninety percent of its power and resources were concentrated in the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
If the Sun Crow race truly went and invaded the Bloom Divine Province, then that would mean inconceivable consequences for all of them.
<br><br>
The Dragon City and the sword sects in the seven mountains were already beginning to mobilize their forces. The Land of Sword Grief would also follow suit.
<br><br>
The disciples present knew what a war among the super races meant. Chaos would fall upon the entire land and even powerful Chaotic Source Realm warriors could perish in the battlefield.
<br><br>
All the disciples kept their mouths shut in a tight line and the atmosphere was incredibly heavy. In the silence, Gabriel spoke, "Master Goran, we were able to become outstanding and powerful warriors because of the Oneness Sky Palace. It is only natural for us to lay down our lives on the line to defend it from its enemies!"
<br><br>
"Gabriel is right! I'll kill all those damn birds when they come!" More and more disciples echoed Gabriel's sentiments and the previous icy mood began to heat up with conviction.
<br><br>
"How dare the Sun Crow race..."
<br><br>
If it was a battle they wanted, then so shall it be delivered.
<br><br>
They were all human beings and their foundations were built upon the Bloom Divine Province. If the Oneness Sky Palace was destroyed, then all of the disciples' foundations would also crumble. The only way to go about this situation was to willingly lay down their lives and fight to the death.
<br><br>
Goran couldn't help the burst of pride that swelled in his chest, but he was still in a bad mood.
<br><br>
The crisis in the North Unicorn Province was tricky, but that was no longer the Oneness Sky Palace's biggest concern...
<br><br>
"War is imminent! Everyone, ready yourselves and gather in the Dragon City. Your tasks shall be assigned to you there!" Goran announced. After he finished speaking, he began to distribute golden swords to the disciples one by one.
<br><br>
These golden swords were tokens of the Oneness Sky Palace, held by the five-star Oneness Guards.
<br><br>
Zen received two, since he would need to give the other one to the Evil God.
<br><br>
The warriors who cultivated in seclusion were also called out and Zen expected the Evil God to come out with them.
<br><br>
To his surprise, the Evil God was nowhere to be seen. 'Is he trapped inside a temple?' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
After Goran left, Zen made his way back to the bronze building with the others.
<br><br>
Inside, he found the Evil God looking a bit red and flustered. Zen waited as the Evil God rushed over towards him and gave a respectful bow. He returned the Evil God's bow with a nod. "Have you arrived at the Myriad Spirits City during this secluded cultivation?"
<br><br>
The Evil God nodded. "I have but I accidentally explored a temple outside the city and obtained something, so I was late."
<br><br>
Zen couldn't control what the Evil God did on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked composed enough but Zen remained doubtful.
<br><br>
It wasn't an easy feat to leave a temple at will and Zen wouldn't doubt it if the Evil God came out after a few days, but he came out after just a short period of time.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Zen's eyes flashed and all the memories the Evil God had on the Other Shore started to flood his consciousness.
<br><br>
He saw the Evil God explore Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore...
<br><br>
cross the energy vortex...
<br><br>
receive the soul crystal in the Myriad Spirits City...
<br><br>
come upon an Other Shore Key and explore the temple...
<br><br>
The Evil God had built a completely nonexistent world within the Kaleidoscopic Golden Dipper.
<br><br>
These memories were all the things the Evil God had imagined.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God himself was convinced that these were real since his true memories had been taken away.
<br><br>
This was how the Inner-world Generating Avatars worked. If they wanted to deceive their masters, then they had to deceive themselves first.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God felt strange, since training obediently on the Other Shore wasn't his thing.
<br><br>
Zen felt this strangeness but couldn't figure out just what was wrong.
<br><br>
He then chose to hand over the golden sword to the Evil God, instructing him to prepare before leaving.
<br><br>
After he returned to his training room, Zen took out a piece of paper and unfolded it before him. There was a moment of hesitation, but he began to write something down: the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
He had previously hoped that the Oneness Sky Palace could help him revive his race in exchange for the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
However, Zen now understood that the human race existed as a whole and could no longer hide the Truth Enlightenment from them anymore. He planned to take this piece of paper and hand it over to Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Chapter 3624 The North Mysterious City Zen carefully folded the paper. He had completed writing down the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
He went to the first floor and handed the paper to Elvinia.
<br><br>
"What's this?" she asked.
<br><br>
"It's the complete version of the Truth Enlightenment," Zen said simply.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked, caught unaware. Sure enough, Zen had been able to decipher the whole Truth Enlightenment! Elvinia would have been more shocked in the past.
<br><br>
But she had spent enough time with him now to know amazing feats like this were just a matter of course to him.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace owns the Truth Enlightenment. I just translated it.
<br><br>
So it should be your father who passes it down to the swordsmen in the world," said Zen.
<br><br>
Elvinia carefully stowed the Truth Enlightenment away, pursing her lips as she realized she could not accompany Zen to where he headed next.
<br><br>
She was the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Now that the Oneness Sky Palace was in danger, she couldn't just hide. But she had to go back to the Phoenix Palace before heading to the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
Having handed over the Truth Enlightenment to Elvinia, Zen set off for the Dragon City with the Evil God.
<br><br>
For a long time, the Dragon City had been a lively place.
<br><br>
But in recent times, it had fallen into desolation.
<br><br>
This was true both inside and outside the city.
<br><br>
Most of the Oneness Guards had been gathered in the Grand River Fortress when the Sun Crows attacked it. They fought with all their might, but still suffered heavy casualties in the end.
<br><br>
The Flag Masters and the Alliance Chiefs posted outside the Dragon City had actually gone through numerous tests to become Oneness Guards.
<br><br>
But the rules were suddenly changed just a few days ago.
<br><br>
People would be automatically qualified for the Oneness Guards as long as they had participated in a certain amount of battles! This was a once in a lifetime opportunity for a vast majority. All the Alliance Chiefs and Flag Masters led their men to head in droves to the battlefield in hopes of meeting the qualifications.
<br><br>
Thus, only a few remained posted outside the Dragon City.
<br><br>
That was why when Zen arrived, he found, to his surprise, that his companions from the Sword Light Palace had been taken away.
<br><br>
Even the weaker subordinates were taken away. The Oneness Sky Palace seemed to be in big trouble this time.
<br><br>
Arriving at the Dragon Shadow Pavilion in the Dragon City, Zen and the Evil God showed their golden swords for verification. After Oneness Guards checked them, they took them to the transmission array. They headed straight for the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
The North Unicorn Province's population was quite small although it was adjacent to the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
There were only 16 cities in the North Unicorn Province, and the total population of 15 of them was equal only to that of a medium-sized city beside the Clear Lake.
<br><br>
There was only one big city in the whole province. It was called the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
The civilians from the North Mysterious City, however, had already evacuated to the Bloom Divine Province because of the war.
<br><br>
The city was now being used as a stronghold for the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Zen finally arrived at the North Mysterious City through the space channel.
<br><br>
Many Oneness Guards bustled around. There were also a large number of Other Shore Realm warriors. A lot of them were only at the second or third stages of the Other Shore Realm based on their auras.
<br><br>
While busy, they however, moved silently, a hardened look on their faces.
<br><br>
The depressing atmosphere of the war loomed over everyone, though the bloodshed had not yet reached the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
"Welcome, disciples of the Land of Sword Grief. This way, please," a fivestar Oneness Guard said as he cupped his hands and bowed to Zen, the Evil God and other new arrivals.
<br><br>
Those who had reached the Land of Sword Grief held very high positions in the Oneness Sky Palace. After all, even the weakest disciples of it had already reached the Desire World, when even the strongest five-star Oneness Guards were unable to do so. If Oneness Guards had reached the Desire World, they would have been taken to the Chaotic Source World last time.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Oneness Guards highly respected the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
The Oneness Guards led Zen and the others through half of the city and to a large pavilion.
<br><br>
Around 20 disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were already gathered there. Zen spotted a few familiar faces. Many of them were here after being mobilized by Goran.
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Several disciples on the first floor greeted Zen. The disciples on the second floor merely glanced indifferently at him without saying anything.
<br><br>
In their minds, Zen had progressed too fast. He might have defeated Rocco, but he had yet to earn their full admiration.
<br><br>
In contrast, most of the disciples on the first floor owed much to Zen. Most of them had reached Stage Fourteen and received soul crystal in the Myriad Spirits City. They had also received a lot of benefits from the several races on the Other Shore. Zen's methods often shocked them, but they were grateful to him.
<br><br>
The Oneness Guards advised Zen, the Evil God and the others to stay in the pavilion. Then they turned around and left.
<br><br>
Zen didn't know the situation on the battlefield in the North Unicorn Province, and he had just arrived. He was willing to wait here to be briefed.
<br><br>
He soon found to his shock, however, that the others had already been waiting here for about 14 hours.
<br><br>
Occasionally, the Oneness Guards would bring newly arrived disciples from the Land of Sword Grief and then leave again. Some disciples had already demanded an explanation as to what they were waiting for, but they couldn't give a definite answer.
<br><br>
Zen and the Evil God, however, remained patient. They just sat crosslegged in their seats without saying anything.
<br><br>
Before long, more than 20 hours passed. They had been waiting there until the next morning.
<br><br>
The disciples on the first floor and even some on the second floor couldn't bear it any longer.
<br><br>
"We came to the North Unicorn Province in response to Master Goran's call. We could be killing Sun Crows by now! Why have we been left here?"
<br><br>
"I heard the war in the North Unicorn Province was raging, but if they're too busy to take our help, maybe we should just leave them at it, on their own!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Several disciples were shouting now.
<br><br>
Just then, a burly man entered the pavilion accompanied by several five-star Oneness Guards.
<br><br>
He was obviously a fighter, with his crew cut and his eyebrows arched like arrows. He gave off a murderous aura developed, clearly, from actual experience. The disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were powerful but they rarely killed, so even they didn't have this kind of aura.
<br><br>
Zen had been through a lot of deadly battles, though, so it didn't faze him.
<br><br>
He looked the man up and down calmly.
<br><br>
"Disciples from the Land of Sword Grief," the man said as he bowed to the crowd, "you are the top figures of the Oneness Sky Palace, the treasures of the seven mountains, and the future hope of the Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
The disciples who had grown impatient were somewhat appeased by the praise. They smiled smugly. This only lasted a moment.
<br><br>
The man continued, "But no matter how valued you are and how strong you are, in my eyes, you are still useless. If you want to live, stop being so goddamned proud."
<br><br>
The disciples' smiles froze on their faces. They glared daggers at this impudent man.
<br><br>
Chapter 3625 Seven Arrays And Twelve Passes The disciples the man was talking to were all from the Land of Sword Grief, meaning they had all reached the Chaotic Source Realm. Even those from the first floor could be considered powerful masters in the Source World.
<br><br>
There was no way they were going to tolerate this man's insult.
<br><br>
Raising his eyebrows, a disciple on the second floor called out, "Sir, you might be a Oneness General, but it is very rude of you to say we are 'useless'."
<br><br>
"Like every one of us, you yourself must've come from the Land of Sword Grief. Are you useless too?" a disciple on the first floor retorted haughtily.
<br><br>
Oneness Generals were put in charge of the Oneness Guards, so they were considered the commanders of the Oneness Sky Palace's army.
<br><br>
The status of these Oneness Generals was one level lower than that of the Oneness Governors. In fact, a few disciples on the second floor of the Land of Sword Grief were training in the army. Once they'd gained enough experience, they'd be considered for the title of Oneness General.
<br><br>
Although Oneness Generals were known to be extraordinarily strong, there was no way the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were going to back down from his insult.
<br><br>
Chaos erupted among the disciples as they indignantly tried to defend their honors. However, the man remained calm. "You," he suddenly said, a crafty smile creeping onto his face. "You, you, you... And you."
<br><br>
Lastly, he pointed at Zen. Each time he pointed at someone, their golden swords would suddenly glow. The same went for Zen.
<br><br>
The situation in the North Unicorn Province was extremely critical, so they sorely needed skilled fighters.
<br><br>
Upon catching word that the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief had come, many of the Oneness Generals had returned to the North Mysterious City. According to the rules made by the leaders, each of them could choose five assistants.
<br><br>
The man with a crew cut was Sinclair Su, and he was the first Oneness General to arrive at the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
Sinclair was no stranger to the battlefield. He knew it was bloody and cruel.
<br><br>
Because of this, he knew he wanted to choose disciples with a calm mind.
<br><br>
This would explain why, the moment he showed up, he riled the disciples.
<br><br>
He wanted to see which ones responded calmly.
<br><br>
Just now, Zen and the other four disciples Sinclair had chosen had remained stoic in the face of being insulted. In Sinclair's eyes, these were the ones most fit to be his assistants.
<br><br>
Initially, he had chosen the Evil God. Sinclair could immediately sense the unbelievable power emanating from him. However, once they locked eyes, Sinclair had felt his heartbeat quicken. Trusting his gut, he instinctively decided against recruiting the Evil God.
<br><br>
"You five, come with me. As for the others, I'm so sorry for having offended you!"
<br><br>
Sinclair bowed with his hands clasped, apologizing sincerely.
<br><br>
The disciples weren't stupid. In an instant, they caught on to what Sinclair was up to. Some of them rolled their eyes, while others smiled helplessly.
<br><br>
These Oneness Generals of the Oneness Guards were too cunning! As Zen stood up to follow Sinclair, he shot a glance at the Evil God. Using his consciousness, he spoke to him secretly, "If someone chooses you, try your best to assist them. In the face of danger, however, prioritize getting out of there alive."
<br><br>
"Yes, Creator." The Evil God nodded meekly.
<br><br>
Not long after Zen and the other four left with Sinclair, two more Oneness Generals arrived at the pavilion.
<br><br>
Similar to Sinclair's approach, they tried to infuriate the disciples.
<br><br>
The disciples looked at the Oneness Generals exasperatedly. As if they were going to fall for the same trick again! However, the Oneness Generals were unfazed. With a shrug, they continued picking their assistants. More and more Oneness Generals arrived, each selecting assistants among the disciples.
<br><br>
Most of the Oneness Generals were ferocious and resolute, but for some reason, no one dared choose the Evil God. After a while, the Evil God found himself sitting in the pavilion, alone.
<br><br>
The North Unicorn Province was shrouded in smoke all year round.
<br><br>
After leaving the North Mysterious City, Zen and the other four disciples followed Sinclair all the way north.
<br><br>
"The Sun Crow race has taken over the Grand River Fortress, and a million people have died." Sinclair narrowed his eyes as he brought them up to speed. "The Oneness Guards have also suffered thirty thousand casualties, and more than thirty Oneness Generals have died."
<br><br>
The total number of the Oneness Guards was only eighty thousand. At this point, they had lost more than a third of that. Moreover, there were only two hundred Oneness Generals in total, and more than thirty of them had died.
<br><br>
Suffering such a loss was indeed too heavy a burden for the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"It was easy to defend the Grand River Fortress, but difficult to attack," a fair-skinned scholar-like disciple suddenly chirped from behind Zen.
<br><br>
"Moreover, there were transmission arrays inside. Even if the enemy had managed to break in, the people inside should have been able to retreat without suffering any losses."
<br><br>
The fair-skinned scholar-like disciple was Guzman, and he ranked thirtythird on the second floor.
<br><br>
Before Sinclair could answer, Zen asked, "Was the Cage of Heaven and Earth used?"
<br><br>
Back when Zen had gone to the Mountain Viewing Province, he had witnessed the Cage of Heaven and Earth in action. The cage could cover an entire province, and no one could use Grand Teleportation to get in or out.
<br><br>
Sinclair nodded. "Yes, the Cage of Heaven and Earth was used."
<br><br>
"Even Oneness Generals couldn't break free from the cage?" Zen frowned.
<br><br>
As far as he knew, Elizabeth had the power to break free from the Cage of Heaven and Earth and was able to use Grand Teleportation. The Oneness Generals shouldn't be much weaker than her.
<br><br>
Sinclair sighed, "If the Cage of Heaven and Earth were to envelop the entire province, it wouldn't be able to trap us, but under the surprise attack of the Sun Crows led by Emperor Charm, we humans were forced to retreat to the Grand River Fortress. The power of the cage was only aimed at the fortress, so we couldn't get rid of it."
<br><br>
At that time, Sinclair had also been in the Grand River Fortress. Under the leadership of the other elders, he had fought and then retreated. It was lucky enough that he managed to escape.
<br><br>
However, his younger brother, who was also a Oneness General, wasn't so fortunate. He had died in the Grand River Fortress.
<br><br>
As Sinclair recounted this, Zen noticed a hint of sadness in his eyes.
<br><br>
After occupying several big provinces, the Sun Crows had finally stopped in the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
Now the task of the Oneness Guards was to stop the Sun Crows at all costs in the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
"From the North Mysterious City to the northwest, seven arrays and twelve passes have been set up. I'm responsible for guarding the Mountain Sea Pass, which is the most dangerous one." That sly smile crept on his face once more. "You must be careful when we get there."
<br><br>
The disciples exchanged wary glances upon hearing Sinclair's last few words.
<br><br>
The situation was already very dangerous, yet they had to guard the most dangerous area of all. Such bad luck! Sinclair seemed to sense what was going on in their heads. "Don't worry,"
<br><br>
he said in an attempt to comfort them. "The Mountain Sea Pass might be the most dangerous, but it's also the most heavily guarded. Even if the Sun Crows manage to invade the Mountain Sea Pass, the others will come to our aid."
<br><br>
Guzman nodded. "The North Unicorn Province is the last pass of the Oneness Sky Palace. The Oneness Sky Palace will definitely block the Sun Crows here. Many elders from the seven mountains have also come. We shouldn't be pessimistic."
<br><br>
"Right. The elders of the seven mountains are in charge of the seven arrays.
<br><br>
Not far behind the Mountain Sea Pass is the Vastness Array, which is defended by the strongest warriors of the Vastness Mountain," added Sinclair confidently.
<br><br>
"The Vastness Mountain?"
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows at the mention of this name.
<br><br>
Chapter 3626 Using Humans As Bait Zen frowned. The conflict between Zen and the Vastness Mountain ran pretty deep.
<br><br>
Back then, if it hadn't been for Yasamin and Flamine, he probably wouldn't have been able to leave the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
To Zen, the news that people from the Vastness Mountain were in command here was definitely bad news.
<br><br>
But given the current situation, he doubted the Vastness Mountain would do anything rash to take revenge on him.
<br><br>
Sinclair didn't notice Zen's crestfallen expression. Pointing downwards, he said excitedly, "Look! That's the Vastness Array!"
<br><br>
Zen looked in the direction he pointed and saw that the ground below them had been excavated.
<br><br>
A huge sword-shaped array was carved on the ground, and in the very center was a high tower. It was obviously newly built, its stone walls practically shining.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was studying the high tower, someone was looking up from a small window in the tower. It was Natasha, who was dressed in red.
<br><br>
"The disciples in the Land of Sword Grief have gathered in the North Mysterious City one after another," Natasha said in a low voice. "The first group has already arrived at the front line."
<br><br>
Behind her sat an old man in black. He had a hooked nose and drooping eyes, as though he loathed everything in existence. It was Holden, the one who had forcefully taken Zen away from the Dragon Path.
<br><br>
"I think Zen will also go to the North Mysterious City," Holden said in a hoarse voice.
<br><br>
"I've sent someone to check it out," Natasha said, the corners of her mouth curving upward gracefully. "This is the best time to take action.
<br><br>
Everything's so chaotic in the North Unicorn Province. He'll never see it coming!"
<br><br>
Ever since Zen got on the wrong foot with the Vastness Mountain, he had never left the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Even when he went to the Chaotic Source World, there were powerful warriors protecting him all the time.
<br><br>
Now that all the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were coming out, the Vastness Mountain was presented with an excellent opportunity.
<br><br>
After passing by the Vastness Array, Zen and the others continued moving forward. In the distance, they could see a temporary pass—the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Even though it was just temporary, the pass was quite large in scale. After all, building a bunch of houses was a very simple task for warriors of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
In front of those buildings was a slender array.
<br><br>
It stretched as far as the eye could see.
<br><br>
"Is this the Sky Net?" asked Guzman as he stared at the slender array in the distance. "Woah. They resorted to this to prevent the Sun Crow race from infiltrating..." He whistled in awe.
<br><br>
The entire Sky Net Array stood across the northwest corner, forming a wall that climbed to the sky.
<br><br>
As long as the Sky Net was not broken, no one from the Sun Crow race could break through.
<br><br>
"Yes," Sinclair replied, nodding his head. "A few days ago, the Sun Crow race had tried to launch an attack, but they couldn't get past the Sky Net.
<br><br>
Let's go down here."
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! As the six of them descended from the sky, the people below watched them closely.
<br><br>
Many people guarded the Mountain Sea Pass. In addition to the Oneness Guards, there were also many warriors of Other Shore Realm recruited from the Bloom Divine Province. Many Alliance Chiefs and Flag Masters from the Dragon City were also assigned here.
<br><br>
"I heard that they are from the Land of Sword Grief!" one of them said, daring to hope.
<br><br>
"So what? Like they'll help us at all..."
<br><br>
"Alas..."
<br><br>
Faced against the Sun Crow race, the people had learned to lose hope.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen and the others, having just arrived, didn't notice the pessimism at first. Guided by Sinclair, they headed straight for the largest building in the Mountain Sea Pass. There they were greeted by several Oneness Generals.
<br><br>
After brief introductions, Sinclair said seriously, "I'm in charge of the whole Mountain Sea Pass. I'm sorry if I offended you in the North Mysterious City. But now, you're here. I hope you will trust and obey all my orders."
<br><br>
The disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were not happy to hear this, but they all knew that what he was saying was true, so they dared not speak out against him.
<br><br>
Once more, Sinclair discussed the current situation to all who were present.
<br><br>
Then, he allocated a room for each of the five disciples.
<br><br>
Once they had settled everything, Sinclair let them go to explore the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Zen wandered on one side of the Mountain Sea Pass and surveyed the area.
<br><br>
He tried to memorize the environment and get a feel of the place.
<br><br>
Right in front of the Mountain Sea Pass was a plain that resembled the shape of a snake. If they were attacked on the left or the right side, they could defend it while waiting for reinforcements. The terrain was ideal.
<br><br>
This was probably why the Sun Crow race was keenly targeting it.
<br><br>
After wandering around for a while, Zen found that the Mountain Sea Pass was divided into two tiers. The upper tier was guarded by Oneness Guards, while the lower tier was mostly guarded by warriors in the first stage or second stage of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
Zen didn't know why, but as he passed by, he felt the gaze of the people below fixed on him. When he turned to look, he found that their eyes were filled with hatred.
<br><br>
Zen felt strange, but he eventually shrugged it off.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to return to his room, a voice suddenly came from the lower tier, "Master... Flag Master!"
<br><br>
Zen hadn't been called that in a long time. The people who called him that were most likely from outside the Dragon City.
<br><br>
"Shut up!" a four-star Oneness Guard from the upper tier snapped. "There is no 'Flag Master' here! This is a Oneness General our Oneness Guards have invited here! Go back now!"
<br><br>
With his hand clasping a golden sword, Zen realized he had been promoted to a Oneness General.
<br><br>
In fact, because of this battle, every disciple in the Land of Sword Grief had been promoted to Oneness Generals. It was only natural these Oneness Guards treated Zen with respect.
<br><br>
After being scolded by the four-star Oneness Guard, the man from the lower tier dared not say anything more and retreated.
<br><br>
However, Zen shot the Oneness Guard a cold look. Turning on his heel, he leapt onto the lower tier to catch up to the retreating man.
<br><br>
"Jago!" Zen smiled warmly.
<br><br>
Indeed, it was Jago of the Sword Light Palace. "Flag Master! It's really you!" the man cried excitedly. "I knew it was you!"
<br><br>
The last time Zen passed by the Dragon City, the people who had stayed outside the city were nowhere to be found. This left him with a bad feeling.
<br><br>
In such an emergency, he had figured that the Oneness Sky Palace might have put all these people into the battlefield. But, judging from their low cultivation level, the chance of them surviving this war was slim.
<br><br>
"Where are the other disciples of the Sword Light Palace? And where is Monica?" Zen asked with concern.
<br><br>
Hearing Zen's questions, Jago's lips trembled slightly, and his eyes shone as tears welled within them.
<br><br>
Originally, Jago had been just a playboy in the Sword Light Palace, and had never really experienced any hardship. Even in the Dragon City, he was protected by Zen. After Zen left, Monica had become an Alliance Chief and took good care of the disciples of the Sword Light Palace.
<br><br>
But not long ago, ever since they were recruited by the Oneness Sky Palace to serve in the North Unicorn Province, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace had been scattered. The past few days alone, Jago had suffered a lot and had stared death in the face more often than he'd have liked.
<br><br>
"Flag Master, Faegan was already eaten by the Sun Crows. They gobbled him whole, without leaving a single bone! As for the others, they have been guarding the Heavenly Wind Pass under the leadership of Alliance Chief Monica. But I'm afraid they don't have much time left..." At this point, a single tear streamed down his face. "The Oneness Guards don't give a crap about us! They use us as bait!"
<br><br>
The troops that guarded the North Unicorn Province could be divided into three categories. The strongest ones were the Oneness Generals, such as Sinclair and Zen, who were with high-end fighting power. The second group was the Oneness Guards. The major sword sects in the seven mountains also sent their disciples here, who would become the Oneness Guards automatically once they joined the troops.
<br><br>
The last group was the large number of warriors from outside the Dragon City.
<br><br>
These people were weak, and were definitely not equipped to fight against the Sun Crows. Yet, someone had decided that they would be the ones to venture outside the Sky Net to lure the Sun Crows in.
<br><br>
Using living people as bait worked well, for everyone except the people used as bait, of course.
<br><br>
Chapter 3627 Attack A deeper frown appeared on Zen's face when he heard Jago's complaint.
<br><br>
Although only a small number of people outside the Dragon City could join the Oneness Guards and very few of them joined the major sword sects, they were still members of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
However, these people were sent to the North Unicorn Province, where they were used as bait.
<br><br>
When Zen learned of this matter, he too was enraged! "What if you don't obey their orders?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
"Those who disobey the military orders won't be able to escape death," Jago replied with a bitter smile.
<br><br>
Back then, Jago thought that he was lucky to enter the Dragon City.
<br><br>
Therefore, he had cultivated so hard in the Dragon City and had stepped into the Other Shore Realm in the past few years. Now, he was in the second stage of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
If he stayed in the Sword Light Palace, he wouldn't be able to make it even after thousands of years...
<br><br>
However, he ended up in his current state after he became an Other Shore Realm warrior. If he stayed in the Sword Light Palace all the time, he might not be able to achieve anything in the future, but it would be a good thing to be a socialite or a playboy of the Yuebai Clan.
<br><br>
Of course, Jago didn't mean to blame Zen. They had looked forward to entering the Dragon City before, after all.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the Sword Light Palace would have already been destroyed if Zen had not come.
<br><br>
A mischievous grin graced Zen's face, and then he said, "Go up with me!"
<br><br>
"Go up..." Jago's eyes glinted.
<br><br>
Just as Zen invited him, the Other Shore Realm warriors on the lower tier immediately caused a ruckus.
<br><br>
Those Other Shore Realm warriors and Jago shared the same fate. All of them would be sacrificed as bait, but to be fair, who was willing to accept that? "General, please take me with you!"
<br><br>
"General, how about letting me be promoted to a Oneness Guard?"
<br><br>
"Master Zen, I've met you in the Dragon City. I..."
<br><br>
At that moment, the Other Shore Realm warriors began to swarm Zen.
<br><br>
However, they were interrupted when several five-star Oneness Guards from the upper tier came down.
<br><br>
"Go back right now!" one of the guards shouted.
<br><br>
That particular Oneness Guard had a Soul of Light that was in Stage Twelve of the Other Shore and could soon turn into the Indigo Soul.
<br><br>
The aura he emanated felt like a gentle breeze to Zen, but it forced those warriors to retreat! Jago couldn't bear it at first, but Zen pulled him to his side and blocked the aura. Fortunately, Jago was fine.
<br><br>
"You... How dare you!" shouted Zen.
<br><br>
His eyes were filled with wrath, and the aura of his Soul of Light flowed out from him.
<br><br>
His Soul of Light had turned into the Indigo Soul of the ultimate level, so the aura he emitted was naturally quite powerful. Those five-star Oneness Guards immediately blanched when they felt the immense pressure.
<br><br>
The moment Zen was about to leave with Jago, another figure appeared beside Zen.
<br><br>
This person was another Oneness General in the Mountain Sea Pass, who was known as Basil Zhu. He had introduced himself to Zen before.
<br><br>
Basil Zhu stood in front of Zen and politely said, "General Zen, you can't take this person away." "Why?" Zen asked coldly.
<br><br>
"Although there are many warriors and his departure will not affect anything, I'm afraid it will be difficult to convince the crowd if you forcefully take him away," Basil Zhu said as he waved his hand.
<br><br>
Upon hearing his words, those who were driven away by the five-star Oneness Guards nearby watched them eagerly.
<br><br>
It was clear that they were envious and unwilling.
<br><br>
Like Basil Zhu had said, these people would definitely be upset if Zen took only Jago away.
<br><br>
"Really?" Zen said with arched brows. "In that case, I need a guard by my side. It's good that Jago becomes my guard!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
However, as soon as he finished speaking, the warriors in the distance became restless again.
<br><br>
"Master Zen! I can also be your guard!"
<br><br>
"Sir, I can serve you!"
<br><br>
"General Zen, I am much stronger than Jago and my Other Shore Token is..."
<br><br>
As Basil Zhu watched the commotion among the crowd, he smiled peevishly at Zen and said, "You can also see the current situation now. I didn't mean to stop you deliberately."
<br><br>
The warriors on the lower tier were like a group of crabs in a bowl. Every time a warrior wanted to get out, the others pulled them back. None of them wanted to give up the chance to survive.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen glanced at Jago and told him, "You stay here first. I won't let anything happen to you."
<br><br>
"Flag Master..." Tears welled up in Jago's eyes.
<br><br>
"The other disciples of the Sword Light Palace will be fine as well," Zen reassured him.
<br><br>
Then, Zen returned to the upper tier and asked Basil Zhu about the Heavenly Wind Pass. It turned out that the Heavenly Wind Pass was next to the Mountain Sea Pass, and one could see it after moving a hundred miles southeast from the Mountain Sea Pass. Once the war began, the Heavenly Wind Pass on the right side and the Battle Rage Pass on the left would send out troops.
<br><br>
After Basil Zhu's introduction, he said to Zen in a low voice, "Zen, what you did just now is reckless. If you need to bring that young man up, you can just inform those Oneness Guards first, but it's not appropriate for them to let you do that in public..."
<br><br>
It actually didn't matter if Jago left the Mountain Sea Pass, but the members on the lower tier were miserable all the time. Therefore, it was troublesome to take him away in front of so many people.
<br><br>
"Indeed, I have been a bit reckless, but it's alright," Zen replied. After all, it wasn't only Jago who he wanted to save.
<br><br>
Nothing had happened in the first three days after Zen had arrived at the Mountain Sea Pass. Not even a single Sun Crow had appeared.
<br><br>
Sinclair and several other Oneness Generals were worried about it. The calmer it was, the greater trouble there would be.
<br><br>
In those three days, the Vastness Mountain had sent three people to inspect the issue, and the seventeen Oneness Generals of the entire Mountain Sea Pass had to greet and meet them.
<br><br>
Now, Zen had never seen those three people from the Vastness Mountain before.
<br><br>
Despite that, those three frequently glanced at him while they inspected, and he didn't know if that was intentional or not.
<br><br>
He naturally sensed a thing quite fast, but he kept calm. Instead, he couldn't help but feel taunted.
<br><br>
It seemed that he had underestimated the Vastness Mountain. The Vastness Mountain would not give up the opportunity to make moves...
<br><br>
However, the current Zen was no longer what he used to be. Even a warrior as powerful as Natasha would fail to defeat him.
<br><br>
Besides, the Vastness Mountain didn't dare to make a scene.
<br><br>
On the fourth day, the white mist in the distance gradually dissipated, and some black dots floated within it.
<br><br>
"There are enemies coming!" one of the Oneness Guards shouted when he realized what was happening.
<br><br>
"The Sun Crows are coming!"
<br><br>
"Hurry up and inform everyone!"
<br><br>
"Open the Sky Net!"
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The array that stretched thousands of miles released a beam of light, and then a huge net suddenly appeared. It was the Sky Net Array, which blocked the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
At that point, Sinclair and the other sixteen Oneness Generals stood at the top of the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
More and more black dots materialized in the distance. The densely packed Sun Crows gathered together and formed a huge dark cloud, which spread towards the Mountain Sea Pass. They looked like they moved slowly, but it was actually the opposite.
<br><br>
"This will be another fierce battle," said Sinclair.
<br><br>
"This time, their number is even bigger than before. I wonder if there are demon women of the Divine Lair there," Basil Zhu commented.
<br><br>
To a Oneness General, the ordinary Sun Crows were nothing, and it was the demon women of the Divine Lair who posed a great threat.
<br><br>
Chapter 3628 The Nine Positions There was a large gap in strength between the demon women in the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
Zen had fought several of them in the Mountain Viewing Province. Sure, they hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but Zen also had a natural advantage against the divine flames of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
But there were more powerful demon women in the Divine Lair, some as powerful as Elizabeth.
<br><br>
"All we need to do is guard the Mountain Sea Pass and activate the array!"
<br><br>
Sinclair roared and nine circles appeared in front of the Mountain Sea Pass, distributed on the outside of the Sky Net. If the Sun Crows showed up, the nine important positions of the array would be the first line of defense.
<br><br>
"I'll man the first position in the center, and you guard the other eight in pairs," ordered Sinclair.
<br><br>
"Why are the nine positions set outside the Sky Net? Isn't that too dangerous?" Guzman asked, staring at them.
<br><br>
"The setting of the nine positions has been carefully calculated. Together they form a circular array. They are not flawed; the real flaw is inside the Mountain Sea Pass. We just need to take down as many Sun Crows as we can in our positions," said Sinclair with a faint smile of pride.
<br><br>
As long as the Sun Crows didn't break the Sky Net, they couldn't hurt the people in the nine positions. In this way, those in the positions were invincible.
<br><br>
"I see. This array is amazing!" Guzman exclaimed.
<br><br>
"But if they discover that they can't hurt us, they'll begin attacking the Sky Net. Once the Sky Net is broken, then we'll be in danger. So I hope you will give it your all, not only for the Oneness Sky Palace, but for all of us!"
<br><br>
Sinclair said.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
Just then, a wave of space fluctuation appeared in the nine circles. Nine space channels that distorted the surrounding light extended before Zen and the others.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
Sinclair stepped into one of the space channels and appeared in the first position.
<br><br>
Guzman and another Oneness General then followed suit, appearing in another position.
<br><br>
The other Oneness Generals, in pairs, did the same, leaving only Zen and Basil.
<br><br>
"General Zen, please," Basil said with a smile, gesturing for Zen to go first.
<br><br>
Zen nodded courteously and stepped into the space channel.
<br><br>
It was only over a thousand feet long. Passing through it was like carrying out a short spatial transference. In an instant, Zen appeared in one of the positions.
<br><br>
It was a circle filled with dim lights. To his surprise, they were like a layer of oil spreading in the space, rippling in waves around him.
<br><br>
When he took a step towards the edge of the circle, it followed him.
<br><br>
"This circle moves with me?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
He took a step back, and so did the circle. He took a step left, and once again, so did the circle.
<br><br>
As Zen was testing this out, Basil appeared as well. Seeing Zen pacing back and forth made him smile. "It's your first time doing this. You should spend some time getting used to it."
<br><br>
"The position moves with me, but there are two of us," Zen said, puzzling a little.
<br><br>
"We need to act together, or we'll both be standing at the edge while the position remains still," Basil revealed as he walked in the opposite direction to Zen.
<br><br>
They stood at both ends of the position so it would not move.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and Basil continued his explanation, "In addition, the position can help us conjure weapons."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and released some divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A transparent long sword floated out of their position.
<br><br>
Basil wielded the sword and slashed out into the space.
<br><br>
A ray of sword light was created and shot into the distance.
<br><br>
"Is it Power Shaping?" Zen asked, curious.
<br><br>
"Have you ever cultivated the Might Godly Way?" Basil was taken aback.
<br><br>
"You could tell from just a glance? All you need to do is release some divine megatons of force," he said.
<br><br>
Most in the Source World focused on one Godly Way, rarely studying the others. But so long as they could reach the Other Shore, everything would be fine.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and stuck his hand out. He released some divine megatons of force and a long sword floated out of their position, under his control.
<br><br>
"Could I conjure as many swords as I want with the Power Shaping?" Zen asked, seeming to have a plan brewing.
<br><br>
Basil nodded and said, "Of course. It's up to you. But the more swords you conjure, the more difficult it is to control them. If you get distracted, it can become too much to handle. I think you'd better..."
<br><br>
Before he finished speaking, another transparent sword appeared.
<br><br>
With both of Zen's hands clasped, more and more swords began appearing.
<br><br>
The space around was dense with long swords, each having ten divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
With a total of one hundred and twenty-eight swords, that came to more than one thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
This was not a large amount to a Oneness General.
<br><br>
But the long swords danced around their position in unison.
<br><br>
This stunned Basil and the other Oneness Generals. Basil smiled and said, "General Zen, you are an accomplished warrior of the Might Godly Way. I admire you greatly."
<br><br>
He admired Zen on the surface, but beneath that, he and the other Oneness Generals harbored great disdain in their hearts.
<br><br>
"Hey, are all the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief practicing these useless methods now?" a Oneness General asked with a condescending smile.
<br><br>
Guzman stood aside and said nothing, but sneered within himself.
<br><br>
'Useless? Zen has become the number one disciple on the second floor in just two months with his true strength. How could the Oneness General call his method useless?' he thought.
<br><br>
Seventeen people in the nine positions of the array were ready as the Sun Crows got closer and closer.
<br><br>
"Quack, quack, quack..."
<br><br>
Countless Sun Crows cawed queerly. The sounds felt like sandpaper grating against their ears, leaving them in pain.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! The first group of Sun Crows approached, turning into sharp black swords releasing golden light, shooting straight for the nine positions of the array.
<br><br>
"They're Sharp-winged Sun Crows," Zen said, raising his eyebrows.
<br><br>
"Kill them and don't let them get any closer!" Sinclair bellowed.
<br><br>
The seventeen people in the array stretched out their hands and transparent swords flew upward one by one.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Under the control of the crowd, the swords moved all over the place with ease. Some slashed out sword radiance, some quickly strangled the Sharpwinged Sun Crows and some stabbed out thousands of lines to kill them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3629 Being A Backbone The penetrating power of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows was indeed amazing. If they went for a head-on collision with the important positions of the array, they would definitely cause a tremendous impact on the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
With that, everyone was trying their very best to stop the Sharp-winged Sun Crows from coming down and approaching the array.
<br><br>
"Take this! Straight Strike!" Sinclair shouted mightily.
<br><br>
The long sword that was floating outside began exerting fierce momentum.
<br><br>
Then it started dashing through the targets while faint cracking sounds echoed through space. Due to the intense and impressive sword momentum, some of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows had already been slashed to pieces even before the sword actually touched them.
<br><br>
Judging from the theurgy he just used, everybody could notice the big difference in strength between Oneness Generals and the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
Most theurgies that Oneness Generals exerted were straightforward but powerful. They had no fancy moves but focused on annihilating the target through intense power. The only shortcoming that one could observe was the lack of agility.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief used different swordsmanship theurgies that had one thing in common. Their theurgies were skillful and full of elegance but were noticeably insufficient in power.
<br><br>
However, these Sharp-winged Sun Crows weren't that strong enough. Thus, even the swordsmanship theurgies of the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief were enough to kill them.
<br><br>
In fact, the disciples from the Land of Sword Grief had killed more Sharpwinged Sun Crows.
<br><br>
"There's only one key to killing these Sharp-winged Sun Crows—exert quick and full-powered attack towards your target. Remember that, Zen.
<br><br>
This way, you can be more efficient in dealing with your enemies." The swordsmanship theurgy that Basil was using was similar to that of Sinclair.
<br><br>
He wanted to show and teach Zen that their way of dealing with the enemies was more effective and efficient.
<br><br>
"Did you just say efficient?"
<br><br>
After looking at the surroundings for a while, Zen's eyes narrowed. He gently raised his hand and shouted, "Rise!"
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! One hundred and twenty-eight long swords suddenly turned into a sword stream and shot up into the sky.
<br><br>
As Basil saw this, he only knew that Zen had easily created these long swords out of the array with his Power Shaping skill. What he didn't know was the method of controlling the long swords was what Zen learned from the Grand Purple Aura Technique.
<br><br>
Splat! One of the long swords pierced through a Sharp-winged Sun Crow which immediately turned into a puddle of blood.
<br><br>
The transparent swords contained some divine megatons of force and a part of the Mountain Sea Pass. As long as the Mountain Sea Pass remained undamaged, these swords could stay pretty invincible.
<br><br>
With a wave of Zen's hand, the swords scattered in various directions.
<br><br>
Shing! Shing! Shing! Each long sword instantly pierced through dozens of Sharp-winged Sun Crows. In just a matter of seconds, thousands of them fell victim and died.
<br><br>
At the same time, Basil's long sword swirled wildly in the air, killing many Sharp-winged Sun Crows one by one. There were thousands of enemies on the position he guarded, but in just a minute, he obliterated all the Sharpwinged Sun Crows who came in his way. As he completed his task, a proud look on his face was very visible.
<br><br>
Basil looked around to check on others, and Zen caught his eye. He smirked at the sight of Zen exerting more than a hundred swords simultaneously. He thought that it was a fancy but a rather inefficient move. There was no doubt in his mind that no warrior could possibly control over a hundred swords all at the same time.
<br><br>
He knew that the Sharp-winged Sun Crows were not that smart, but were extremely agile.
<br><br>
In his mind, if Zen was really using this skill, he presumed that there was no way Zen could stab even a single Sharp-winged Sun Crow in the air. Well, if he was pretty lucky, then he might pierce a few ones by chance.
<br><br>
However, his eyes widened and his jaw almost dropped as he took a closer look upon Zen's area.
<br><br>
The number of dead bodies on Zen's side was easily a hundred times more than what Basil accomplished.
<br><br>
Each of Zen's transparent swords seemed to have a soul of its own as they continuously darted upwards.
<br><br>
Shing! Splat! Every time a Sharp-winged Sun Crow got pierced by the sword, it would explode into a messy cloud of blood.
<br><br>
Around every sword, clouds of blood continuously formed and spread in the air, dyeing the surrounding space with a misty autumn afternoon scenery.
<br><br>
With every sword shooting upwards, thousands of Sharp-winged Sun Crows were vanquished, and after a few rounds of merciless assault from Zen, perhaps more than one hundred thousand were slaughtered in his hands.
<br><br>
However, the Sharp-winged Sun Crows were not afraid of death, being creatures of low intelligence. In fact, the more they were killed, the more they became aggressive and attacked without regard for their lives. But regardless of their sheer number, Zen's swords drilled them all, not letting a single one escape. Soon, the sky above became clear and silent, as not a single Sharp-winged Sun Crow was to be found. Nothing but a pool of blood and dismembered bodies were left below.
<br><br>
"That Oneness General is invincible!"
<br><br>
"He controls over one hundred swords like they were parts of his hands.
<br><br>
Furthermore, every sword's power is equivalent to what a single Oneness General could exert. That makes his power almost equivalent to that of a hundred Oneness Generals!"
<br><br>
"Thank goodness. We don't need to do anything!"
<br><br>
The warriors in the lower tier of the Mountain Sea Pass were so excited at what they saw, they almost burst in tears.
<br><br>
The nine important positions of the array looked pretty indestructible. The big array passed through the Sky Net and was located in the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
However, there was still a possibility that the array might collapse if it received an overwhelming volume of attacks.
<br><br>
Therefore it was earlier agreed upon that if the array suffered serious damage, Sinclair would order the Oneness Guards to release the warriors in the lower tier, though that order would most likely endanger them.
<br><br>
Fortunately, now that Zen had eliminated all the Sharp-winged Sun Crows on his own, the warriors didn't need to come out. Thus, they were all greatly relieved.
<br><br>
"Hey, Jago! Is he really your Flag Master?" an old man asked with his eyes wide open due to extreme shock.
<br><br>
Jago proudly nodded and replied, "Yes! He used to belong to the Sword Light Palace. Then, he brought us to the Dragon City."
<br><br>
"You've only been in the Dragon City for a few years but he instantly grew into such a powerful warrior!" another strong man remarked in utter disbelief.
<br><br>
Earlier, they had heard Jago addressing Zen as Flag Master but they still found it quite hard to believe.
<br><br>
After all, most of these warriors were from the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
They knew well about several powerful masters in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
It was already very difficult for a Flag Master to become an Alliance Chief.
<br><br>
Moreover, to become a Oneness Guard, a warrior needed great opportunities and talents. However, Zen even skipped that and directly became a Oneness General.
<br><br>
Even the warriors who witnessed what Zen underwent with their own eyes found it unbelievable.
<br><br>
"If you doubt me, you can ask Jaxon and Chace. They were all born in the Dragon City and have seen Flag Master Zen before," Jago insisted.
<br><br>
Back when Zen was still a Flag Master, he had defeated Alliance Chiefs.
<br><br>
This event left a deep impression on the members of Dragon City.
<br><br>
"To be perfectly honest, it was really hard to believe that he was the same Zen that we knew before."
<br><br>
"We know that he easily defeated Fergus, but I still didn't expect him to reach this far in such a short time!"
<br><br>
There were mixed emotions as they looked at Zen standing still and stained in red, matching the color of the blood mist that he created in the sky. Some were in awe, while others shivered. But one thing was for sure, Zen's current strength was enough to serve as a backbone of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
There were about two to three million Sharp-winged Sun Crows in the first dark cloud.
<br><br>
Previously, even with the twelve Oneness Generals going all out to subdue the enemies, a considerable number of Sharp-winged Sun Crows were still able to crash into the important positions of the array. These kamikaze attacks were enough to destroy the array in the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Therefore, there were hundreds of warriors stationed in the Mountain Sea Pass on standby. Their purpose was to pour divine crystals into the array to continuously repair it. Once it couldn't be repaired, the Mountain Sea Pass would collapse.
<br><br>
However, this time around, not a single Sharp-winged Sun Crow was able to lay a hand on the array. More than half of their total number was wiped out and fell victim to Zen's swords. Even if there were a few occasional ones who escaped, they were quickly hunted down by the other Oneness Generals.
<br><br>
After killing the Sharp-winged Sun Crows, Zen slowly retracted his hands.
<br><br>
The one hundred and twenty-eight long swords withdrew and returned into the ground.
<br><br>
Basil had always shown Zen the respect he deserved, but on the inside, he didn't take him seriously.
<br><br>
He used to be a Oneness Guard. After he became a five-star one, he entered the Chaotic Source World, and then he joined the Land of Sword Grief to cultivate further.
<br><br>
However, he wasn't able to get to the second floor so he returned to be a Oneness Guard. As a Oneness General now, he had the tendency of looking down upon the warriors from the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
But at this moment, he stared at Zen, rendered speechless.
<br><br>
Chapter 3630 The Invisibility Curtain Basil's strange emotion went unnoticed by Zen.
<br><br>
He looked up to the sky and said, "These Sharp-winged Sun Crows should only a test, right?"
<br><br>
Coming back to his senses, Basil replied, "Yes, yes. It's just a test."
<br><br>
Still, even if it was a mere test, it was far too easy to deal with their attack.
<br><br>
Standing in the front was Sinclair, holding two transparent swords in his hands, giving Zen an emotionless glance.
<br><br>
Zen used a method that could completely defeat a great number of Sharpwinged Sun Crows, but they did not make up the main force or the real threat.
<br><br>
After millions of Sharp-winged Sun Crows in the dark cloud perished, the second dark cloud glided toward the nine positions of the array.
<br><br>
In the center was a woman sitting upright in the air with one hand on her waist, looking down at the Mountain Sea Pass in front of her.
<br><br>
"A mere pass won't stop us. I'll take you through it." With that, the woman gently picked an Other Shore Token from above her head—it was a colorful curtain.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Giving it a shake, she made the curtain grow larger and larger. As the pigment bloomed, it turned all the Sun Crows invisible.
<br><br>
It was none other than the Invisibility Curtain, an Other Shore Token of the mysterious type, as well as a sixth-grade Other Shore Token in the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
In the northeast corner of Stage Nineteen was a cave in the most dangerous mountain. There lived a special kind of spider the size of an ant—the fivecolored spider.
<br><br>
Given its size, it didn't attract much attention—it had no attacking power, nor did it hold any poison.
<br><br>
But it could weave the most beautiful webs, entwined with magnificent colors.
<br><br>
When the web was first discovered, it was thought to be rather strange— how could such a colorful web capture its prey? No creature, no matter how stupid, would fall for such an eye-catching web.
<br><br>
As the man examined the web, he found that it had the unique ability to hide itself and everything on it.
<br><br>
The man then proceeded to collect the webs for several years. After collecting enough, he set a fire in the cave, driving the five-colored spiders to extinction.
<br><br>
From the collected webs, the Invisibility Curtain was formed. Although it came from the Other Shore, it was an artificial token.
<br><br>
Anything the curtain covered could be hidden completely from sight for about three minutes. During this period, not even spiritual sense could uncover it.
<br><br>
Swish! And so the Invisibility Curtain covered all the Sun Crows before disappearing without a trace.
<br><br>
"They've disappeared?"
<br><br>
"All the Sun Crows are invisible?"
<br><br>
"Use spiritual sense to find them!"
<br><br>
Sinclair, Basil, Guzman, and the rest of the Oneness Generals immediately activated their spiritual senses, but nothing was found in the sky. No Sun Crow was above their heads.
<br><br>
But the shrill cries of the Sun Crows rang in their ears one after another.
<br><br>
Although Zen released his spiritual sense as well, he quickly withdrew it after failing to detect any Sun Crows. He noticed a slight change in the cries —the originally noisy chirps grew sharp, indicating that they were now flying at high speed.
<br><br>
"The Sun Crows are spurting! Stop them!" Zen roared before the invisible long swords flew upward.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! The invisible swords created a blood red mist in the air.
<br><br>
Although Sinclair and the rest were in a state of panic, Zen's roar had them lift their swords immediately.
<br><br>
Even though they couldn't see the Sun Crows themselves, they could still chop at them randomly.
<br><br>
While they managed to kill many this way, there were still many remaining because of the aimless killing. An invisible Self-exploding Sun Crow landed right in front of Sinclair.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, an extremely strong energy burst from the Self-exploding Sun Crow's body. With a loud bang, the explosion released over a hundred divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
The array of the Mountain Sea Pass couldn't be destroyed with only over a hundred divine megatons of force, but the Sun Crows often appeared in groups.
<br><br>
When the first Self-exploding Sun Crow burst, more of them landed beside the array.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Streaks of golden light bloomed around the nine positions of the array, completely submerging them.
<br><br>
But the damage to the nine positions was undertaken by the array in the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
On the upper tier of this pass lay a huge circular array—it was the main array. When the nine positions outside were all attacked, this circular array continued to tremble, cracks appearing around it.
<br><br>
"Replenish the divine crystals!"
<br><br>
someone shouted.
<br><br>
Around the main array, hundreds of people were on standby.
<br><br>
Under the command, everyone immediately crushed the divine crystals and threw them into the main array—it easily absorbed the liquid that flowed out of the divine crystals.
<br><br>
Buzz… The main array emitted a pure-white light, rapidly repairing the cracks that appeared.
<br><br>
While the Oneness Generals in the nine positions were left unharmed, they were still frightened upon seeing the explosion of countless Self-exploding Sun Crows outside.
<br><br>
Their faces grim, Sinclair and the rest hacked the invisible Sun Crows to vent their anger, but only a few were killed.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Guzman and the other disciples of the Land of Sword Grief chose to forfeit. Staring into the light from the explosion with wide eyes, they thought about how to escape once the Mountain Sea Pass fell.
<br><br>
Zen already had his eyes shut and ears covered.
<br><br>
"Puff, puff, puff..."
<br><br>
The one hundred and twenty-eight long swords were still flying in the air.
<br><br>
The weapons were swinging randomly, but they could still easily kill the many Sun Crows present.
<br><br>
But Zen noticed something unusual as the long swords flew across.
<br><br>
Two of them suddenly lost their aim as they shot forward, as though some force caused them to deviate from their path.
<br><br>
While the Self-exploding Sun Crows were surely larger than ordinary Sun Crows, they couldn't affect the long swords that flew at high speed.
<br><br>
At this moment, Zen grew extremely sensitive. In an instant, the other transparent swords had already shot in that direction.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! As the swords shrank like a net, about eight of them were suddenly sent away.
<br><br>
"Caught you..."
<br><br>
The corner of Zen's lips curled up into a sly smile when he noticed it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3631 Repelling The moment the Sun Crows disappeared, Zen immediately noticed a problem.
<br><br>
There was a limited number of theurgies in the Source World and even if a theurgy was created using more than ten Truths of Godly Ways, it would still be impossible to make so many Sun Crows invisible just like that.
<br><br>
This effect could only be achieved through the use of an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
These Sun Crows had been hidden right before launching an attack, which meant the cloaking technique could only last for a short period of time.
<br><br>
Otherwise, they could just hide the Sun Crows when they were still far away and let them explode right above the nine positions of the array, which would be a disaster for the Mountain Sea Pass! Since the Sun Crows remained hidden during the charge, that meant the person who used the cloaking theurgy was within the group. Zen had a hunch that it was most likely a demon woman from the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
He summoned more than a hundred long swords to slash at the enemies around him. He wanted to kill as many Sun Crows as possible while searching for the possible demon woman.
<br><br>
More than a hundred swords hacked and slashed all around, trying to find Zen's true target. Finally, two swords were able to pinpoint this elusive demon woman. She thought the swords were mere ordinary blades, so she casually pushed them away.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for her, her action attracted Zen's attention, and he shot all the other swords towards her.
<br><br>
She was just about to break out of the encirclement and sent several swords flying, but the rest of the swords immediately rushed towards her at top speed! "Draw more divine megatons of force!"
<br><br>
There was no way Zen was going to let go of this opportunity. He immediately let the power within his body erupt all at once! The transparent swords were originally infused with ten divine megatons of power, but Zen's sudden burst of energy made three of the swords each contain four thousand divine megatons of power! "Bang, bang, bang..."
<br><br>
Loud explosions followed after the barrage of these swords upon the demon woman. However, she simply used the Invisibility Curtain in her hand to block the attacks.
<br><br>
"Using the swords to find out where I am? Very smart! Unfortunately, these swords are still too weak..." The demon woman stalked closer towards Zen with a sneer.
<br><br>
Dealing with an ordinary Sun Crow was possible with these puny swords imbued with ten divine megatons of power, but that wasn't going to cut it for her. There was no way a Chaotic Source Realm warrior such as her would ever be defeated by such weak energy.
<br><br>
Just as she thought of this, ten more transparent swords shot towards her.
<br><br>
"Bang, Bang..."
<br><br>
The first few swords bounced off her, but when she touched the fourth sword, her cocky expression suddenly changed.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
This fourth sword did not contain just ten divine megatons of force, but four thousand! She could only watch in horror as it slashed through her fingers cleanly.
<br><br>
Had she not been a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, then the sword would've cut off her entire arm! It was also fortunate that the Chaotic Source Spirits helped her resist the damage but they now surged restlessly in her body.
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
Just as she was about to retaliate, another sword came towards her! In desperation to avoid this attack, the demon woman spread her wings and attempted to somersault in the air. Unfortunately for her, the sword still hit her.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The force that hit her was extraordinarily strong, but the Chaotic Source Spirits within her body pulled through and cushioned most of the blow.
<br><br>
However, Zen wasn't done.
<br><br>
"The next sword..." he muttered.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
As he extracted the power from the Civilization Artifacts, the aura within Zen's cinnabar field was released.
<br><br>
His powerful aura startled Basil who was standing right next to him. "Zen! What are you doing?!" Basil exclaimed in panic.
<br><br>
Why was Zen so serious in dealing with these weak birds? Why did he let out such an oppressing wave of power? Unfortunately, Zen's ears were sealed and Basil's question did not register.
<br><br>
He was now solely focused on locating that demon woman and dealing the killing blow! The nine positions and the long swords outside them were maintained by the main array in the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Zen naturally didn't hold back with the power he poured onto his swords.
<br><br>
He forcefully drew out fifteen thousand divine megatons of power all at once! "Swish!"
<br><br>
Not even Anthemar could ignore such an outstanding show of power! The oncoming transparent sword emitted a sharp sound, like a ferocious ghost screaming its battle cry, before shooting towards the void.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
The demon woman had no strength left in her to dodge. She could only watch as the long sword flew towards her, signifying her doom. The Chaotic Source Spirits were a frantic mess and tried to block it, but all of them instantly fell asleep the moment the sword pierced through her chest.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
A fountain of blood spurted from her chest and painted the sky a misty red.
<br><br>
This explosion of blood mist attracted everyone's attention despite the constant explosions from the Self-exploding Sun Crows.
<br><br>
"Come back!"
<br><br>
After stabbing the demon woman, Zen stretched out his finger and hooked it, commanding the sword to come back to him.
<br><br>
Despite the obvious stab wound on her chest, Zen worried that it might not have been enough to kill her. He couldn't take any chances.
<br><br>
As the sword returned to Zen, a figure stumbled into everyone's sight: the demon woman from the Divine Lair with a colorful cloth in her hand! The moment she appeared, the other Sun Crows also became visible and many Self-Exploding Sun Crows fell! Even Sinclair and the other experienced Oneness Generals couldn't help but shudder at the sight.
<br><br>
This demon woman's eyes were filled with hatred.
<br><br>
She had finally discovered the person who was controlling all those swords.
<br><br>
It was Zen who sat in a position of the array with his eyes closed! "Explode!" she ordered as she saw the long sword fly back towards her.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom..."
<br><br>
Over a million Self-exploding Sun Crows floated in the air, but at this moment, all of them swarmed towards her and consecutively exploded.
<br><br>
They wouldn't be able to stop Zen but they could at least make him miss his target. This strategy proved effective as Zen's sword narrowly missed her by inches.
<br><br>
With a wave of her hand, the demon woman once again covered herself with the Invisibility Curtain and disappeared from sight.
<br><br>
The moment she disappeared, Zen wasted no time and once again gathered over a hundred long swords in an effort to scout her out. This time though, the demon woman was prepared and hid herself very well.
<br><br>
However, she left in such a hurry that she failed to take the Self-exploding Sun Crows with her.
<br><br>
Her last command had been for them to explode and so they did, sacrificing themselves like fireworks in the sky.
<br><br>
When the last Self-exploding crow detonated, Sinclair and those surrounding the main array finally heaved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
They were fortunate to have arrived at this outcome since they didn't have that many divine crystals on hand.
<br><br>
Chapter 3632 Corpse Spirit Sun Crows After the demon woman of the Divine Lair floated backwards for several thousand feet, she removed the Invisibility Curtain from her.
<br><br>
"Drip, drip, drip..."
<br><br>
A big hole in her chest flowed with blood as a result from Zen's sword.
<br><br>
But though she seemed seriously injured, it was not fatal to her at all.
<br><br>
As she flapped her wings profusely, her voice echoed majestically into the nine positions. "I thought I could capture the Mountain Sea Pass in one go, but I had no idea that you people had skill," she snickered.
<br><br>
If the Self-exploding Sun Crows kept bursting and if Zen hadn't forced her to show up, the array of the Mountain Sea Pass would have collapsed. The divine crystals stored in the pass wouldn't be able to hold on for too long.
<br><br>
"Bitch, stop talking nonsense!" a Oneness General scolded. "Don't run away!"
<br><br>
As the woman heard this, her pale face still perked up to a smirk. "I've been here the whole damn time," she said sweetly. "I don't intend to run away."
<br><br>
"Oh yeah? Then let's see if you really have what it takes!" the other Oneness General in the same position shouted.
<br><br>
Just as he stopped speaking, both of them darted towards the woman at the same pace.
<br><br>
As they moved, the position that shielded them followed.
<br><br>
This was a defensive tactic, because as long as they were in the position, they were safe. To them, it would be no problem to chase the woman because of her injury. Luckily for them, Sinclair had no intention of stopping them. They were going to return anyway.
<br><br>
Zen gradually retracted the more than one hundred swords and activated his hearing sense. The soft, sweet voice of the woman rang in his ears, and his heart began to beat quickly. However, once he saw the two Oneness Generals going after the woman, his face suddenly changed. "General Sinclair!" Zen called out. "Please ask them to come back quickly.
<br><br>
Something is wrong! They're being enchanted by the woman!"
<br><br>
Originally, the seventeen Oneness Generals, including Zen, had already been nervous.
<br><br>
But because Zen repelled the demon woman from the Divine Lair, they had more hope.
<br><br>
The woman should have escaped, but after she distanced herself from them, she showed up and used her voice to enchant the two Oneness Generals.
<br><br>
"Kemp! Hargrove! Come back this instant!"
<br><br>
Sinclair also had a feeling something bad was going to happen.
<br><br>
At this point, the two Oneness Generals were deaf to Sinclair. They kept rushing towards the woman, the position of the array protecting them, and never looked back.
<br><br>
"What should we do?"
<br><br>
"Their position is connected to the main array," someone pointed out. "If they move too far away from the main array, it'll make the entire Mountain Sea Pass suffer!"
<br><br>
The nine positions of the array were all somewhat connected to the main array, which meant that all attacks on the positions would implicate the entire Mountain Sea Pass. Because of the two Oneness Generals, a position had been compromised. This gave the Sun Crows an opportunity to attack it, and disintegrate the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
After Sinclair had attempted to call them back, his expression grew cold.
<br><br>
"Cut off the Earth Dragon Position! Now!"
<br><br>
This was the position that Kemp and Hargrove used as protection. Once it was disconnected, the two would be left exposed and easily devoured by the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Sinclair had no choice, and he had to make a decision that was for the benefit of more than just the two Oneness Generals.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Once he gave the final order, a wave of energy spread out. It disconnected Kemp and Hargrove from the main array.
<br><br>
Almost instantly, a group of Sun Crows spiraled down and headed straight towards the two Oneness Generals.
<br><br>
The demon woman appeared behind the two, grabbed their heads by the hair, and said disappointingly, "Alas, you were resolute in action, or I would have captured the Mountain Sea Pass already."
<br><br>
"Queenie, you arrived earlier than us," a voice hissed. "If you want to capture the pass all alone, then the full credit will go to you. We will have nothing to do with this."
<br><br>
Behind her, more than ten demon women from the Divine Lair were approaching. They all had powerful, demonic auras that made it obvious they had obtained extraordinary Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
"Cut the crap!" Queenie shouted at them. "Hurry and heal my damn wounds!"
<br><br>
The woman floating behind her moved closer and stretched out her hand.
<br><br>
With one wave, a circular corona appeared.
<br><br>
"Hiss..."
<br><br>
The woman fiddled with the corona, moving the shadow of time to an hour earlier. Just like that, Queenie's chest was healed.
<br><br>
"Queenie, you are too ambitious," the demon woman said after tucking the corona away. "Even if you manage to capture the Mountain Sea Pass, you won't make it through the Sky Net."
<br><br>
"The Sky Net has its own flaws we can work around. After we capture the Mountain Sea Pass, our next move is to figure out how to break the net,"
<br><br>
Queenie responded confidently.
<br><br>
"It's not that simple," the woman shot back. "The seven arrays and twelve passes are two lines of defense. After we capture the Mountain Sea Pass, the Vastness Array will be waiting for us," the woman trailed away, trying to seem less worried. "I'm afraid we cannot go up against the warriors of the Vastness Array."
<br><br>
Queenie frowned hearing this. "So, what do you propose we do?"
<br><br>
"I bet we can capture the Mountain Sea Pass and break the Sky Net," the woman said as she pointed at the distance. "We need to seek help from the inside. As long as someone can help us from there, breaking the Sky Net will be a piece of cake."
<br><br>
"Someone to help us inside? Who?" Queenie raised her eyebrows. "Why didn't Master Elizabeth tell me about this?"
<br><br>
The woman smiled. "Because Master Elizabeth will come in person."
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Behind the group of demon women, the black Sun Crows parted to both sides, which sent over a hundred huge Sun Crows to gradually descend.
<br><br>
Because the huge Sun Crows brought out a heavy aura, it made the other crows become restless and uneasy.
<br><br>
"Corpse Spirit Sun Crows!"
<br><br>
Queenie was surprised to see the Sun Crows descending, especially because they were so strong.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were personally nurtured by Emperor Charm, which made them the strongest of the Sun Crow race. They had been hidden underground, only to appear when the Divine Lair was attacked.
<br><br>
In other words, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows could only be used if the Sun Crow race was ever in danger.
<br><br>
Elizabeth appeared, standing steadily on the last Corpse Spirit Sun Crow that appeared. She looked down at the Sky Net in the distance with a dignified expression.
<br><br>
"Master Elizabeth..."
<br><br>
Before Queenie could finish her sentence, Elizabeth raised her hand and stopped her.
<br><br>
"Our Sun Crow race has no choice but to go all out," Elizabeth said. "We might suffer our biggest loss in battle with the Oneness Sky Palace. Worstcase scenario, we will disappear from the world for good." Elizabeth let out a huge sigh, saddened by the thought of their defeat.
<br><br>
She knew for a fact that the entire Source World, as well as the chaos, would undergo a great reformation eventually.
<br><br>
The battle between the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace marked the beginning of that change.
<br><br>
But as the leader of the Divine Lair, Elizabeth couldn't help but feel sorry for her people. "I only hope that you find a way to escape this calamity and be among the lucky ones who survive," she said solemnly. "Only then can you live forever."
<br><br>
Chapter 3633 General Offensive Negative thoughts began to flood Elizabeth's mind. After all, she couldn't help but feel doubtful when she heard the plan from Emperor Charm for the first time.
<br><br>
If the Purge Way was carried out according to the way Emperor Charm had said, then less than ten thousand people were qualified to live. She couldn't imagine the consequences of such a thing.
<br><br>
Although she was highly uncertain, she did not show it.
<br><br>
Since Emperor Charm was the king of the whole Sun Crow race, Elizabeth still believed his decisions unconditionally, even if she herself was the commander in chief of the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
After the great change in the Source World, however, no one knew how many people could survive safely. Furthermore, it was rather dull to live in a world with less than ten thousand creatures.
<br><br>
In the end, Elizabeth only sighed and gently waved her hand forward. All the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows flapped their wings, and many demon women from the Divine Lair stood behind the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Numerous Sun Crows turned into dark clouds once again and enveloped the whole atmosphere. After that, it became impossible to see everything inside the dark cloud enclosure from the outside.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Sinclair did not look pleased in the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Many people had died from the moment he had guarded the Mountain Sea Pass, but all of them were insignificant Other Shore Realm warriors. Only a few Oneness Guards were killed.
<br><br>
Besides, the twelve Oneness Generals who had fought against the Sun Crows in the positions of the array were completely unharmed.
<br><br>
This time, it wasn't easy for Sinclair to invite five disciples from the Land of Sword Grief to offer help. It was like adding five Oneness Generals to the array, but in the blink of an eye, they lost two Oneness Generals already! More importantly, those two who died were Kemp and Hargrove, his right-hand men! "It's indeed a pity that Kemp and Hargrove died, but the Mountain Sea Pass is still fine. If it weren't for Zen, the Mountain Sea Pass would have been captured," Basil, who was beside him, comforted.
<br><br>
A few seconds had passed, and Sinclair finally calmed down a bit and nodded. "It was really close. I went to check the main array, and they don't have many divine crystals left.
<br><br>
The array of the Mountain Sea Pass withstood this round of attack, but at the price of a hundred million divine crystals..." he said.
<br><br>
If Zen hadn't killed a large number of Self-exploding Sun Crows, the Mountain Sea Pass would have been besieged. "Since there are not many divine crystals left, won't the array of the Mountain Sea Pass be unable to work?" Guzman asked.
<br><br>
"The Vastness Mountain is sending two hundred million divine crystals here. There shouldn't be any problem," Sinclair answered.
<br><br>
Such a war would definitely consume a great deal of divine crystals. A single battle could possibly cost about ten billion divine crystals, and sometimes it could go up to hundreds of billions of divine crystals. It was so disastrous that the weak forces often ran out of divine crystals before the war ended.
<br><br>
"But I'm afraid it's still difficult to deal with them if the demon woman of the Divine Lair continues to lead the team to attack," Zen said with a frown.
<br><br>
Right now, it was totally lucky for Zen to have found out the location of the demon woman from the Divine Lair. It was thanks to his discovery that he was able to stab her a few times.
<br><br>
However, if she continued to bring the Sun Crows to attack again, he would probably have a hard time finding her if he relied solely on luck.
<br><br>
"If only the Sun Crows didn't attack frequently." Basil sighed.
<br><br>
Overall, the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards, and the Other Shore Realm warriors who were stationed at the Mountain Sea Pass never had a good sleep ever since the crisis began.
<br><br>
"It seems that they won't take action frequently in the future," Zen said with a smile. "What do you mean?" Basil asked.
<br><br>
Zen's lips curved into a pout, while the others looked into the distance. Basil also turned to look, and then his gaze froze in shock.
<br><br>
The Sun Crows had formed dark clouds in their previous attack, and now they had gathered together and took up half of the sky! The entire sky was divided into black and white. The white part of the sky was an area that the Sun Crows did not cover, and the black part was filled with countless Sun Crows. Then, the black skyline slowly moved towards the Sky Net and devoured it little by little.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the length of the entire skyline was almost impossible to measure! "It's a general offensive!" Sinclair exclaimed with wide eyes.
<br><br>
"Give the order to the Vastness Mountain!" an Oneness General roared.
<br><br>
"Give the order to the Azure Array! The Sun Crow race is launching a general offensive!" a silver armored Oneness General shouted from the top of the Heavenly Wind Pass.
<br><br>
According to the Oneness Sky Palace's orders, the seven arrays and twelve passes in front of the North Mysterious City were the last defense line.
<br><br>
Once this defense line was broken, the entire Bloom Divine Province would fall.
<br><br>
If that really happened, then the Oneness Sky Palace would have no place to hide except for the seven mountains! Now that they were under the Sun Crow race's general offensive, they had no choice but to guard their territory with all their might.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Evil God sat nonchalantly on the roof of the house at one side of the Heavenly Wind Pass. He appeared to be quite unconcerned as he looked at the dense mass of Sun Crows.
<br><br>
The Inner-world Generating Avatar was a little different from the Rebirth Land. With the Rebirth Land, Zen could only sense where he was, but not what he was doing or thinking. Zen wouldn't even be able to tell his location from a distance.
<br><br>
However, the Inner-world Generating Avatar was more closely linked to him. Even if they were more than one hundred miles away from each other, Zen could still discern the thoughts in the Evil God's mind.
<br><br>
The Evil God had a strong feeling that he had lied to Zen and planned to escape, but the memories in his mind were not right. The feeling made him uneasy.
<br><br>
He hoped that more black Sun Crows would come over, and that the world would be more chaotic...
<br><br>
At that moment, the runes were connected from end to end and converged towards the center of the Azure Array.
<br><br>
In the center of the Azure Array, countless layers of runes wrapped around a particular item. At a glance, it looked like a sword, but it was difficult to see what it was because so many runes were wrapped around it.
<br><br>
A middle-aged man with long hair stood in the center of the array with his hands behind his back. Then, he gently placed his hand on the item wrapped in the runes.
<br><br>
"Swoosh..."
<br><br>
Just then, all the runes became weightless and floated upwards. They looked like thousands of yellow birds that had taken flight. However, it turned out that there was nothing wrapped in the runes right now! "Splash..."
<br><br>
Then, the runes condensed together and formed a huge sword. This sword contained a strange but powerful aura.
<br><br>
"I haven't used the Heavenly Rune Sword for a long time. It's a pity that Fuxi is not here," said the middle-aged man.
<br><br>
The middle-aged man with long hair was the leader of the Azure Mountain, Jonathan Su.
<br><br>
Numerous Oneness Generals guarded the twelve passes, while the leaders of the seven mountains watched over the seven arrays. However, not all of the leaders came.
<br><br>
In the Origin Array Countless rays of sword light twisted, rotated, and surged in the array like water ripples.
<br><br>
Beside the Origin Array stood Winchell and the other masters of the Origin Mountain. All of them looked serious and solemn.
<br><br>
If it was a battle of life and death, the Oneness Sky Palace might not be afraid of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
However, the seven arrays were currently in their greatest crisis, and that was the absence of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.
<br><br>
Without those two, the strength of the Oneness Sky Palace had decreased by more than fifty percent! Moreover, the outsiders still did not know the news. Then again, if all the soldiers knew it, they would probably suffer from low morale before the battle began.
<br><br>
As the beautiful woman who sat in the center of the Origin Array looked at the sullen faces of Winchell and the others, she suddenly said, "Don't worry, everyone. Madam Yasamin has already nurtured six million Deity Sword Souls. Although my cultivation base is far inferior to that of Madam Yasamin and I can only use one move of the Origin Deity Attack, we are not that far from each other when it comes to our strength."
<br><br>
The beautiful woman was called Felicity, and she had a close relationship with Dorothy. She was also Winchell's sister-in-law.
<br><br>
Although Yasamin had always regarded Dorothy as her successor, the war was about to begin and Dorothy's cultivation base was still low even though she had mastered the Origin Swordsmanship. Therefore, it was Felicity who had to go into battle.
<br><br>
Chapter 3634 Rebellion The powerful warriors on the Origin Mountain were able to come up with this replacement method, but that was not the case for Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
In the Land of Sword Grief, Zen had written down the complete Truth Enlightenment and handed it to Elvinia.
<br><br>
As soon as that was done, Elvinia eagerly went straight to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
There were two reasons for her excitement: first, she wanted to personally hand it over to her father; second, she wanted to tell her father what she had seen in the Creation Myth Temple.
<br><br>
Soon enough, she arrived at the Phoenix Palace. She was told that her father was in the Supreme Dragon Hall.
<br><br>
She quickly went to the Supreme Dragon Hall, but the gate was heavily guarded and she couldn't see her father. Later on, she visited her mother, Flamine, instead. That was when she knew that her father was trapped on the Other Shore, and the Oneness Sky Palace was under a great crisis.
<br><br>
She thought of Goran recruiting soldiers in the Land of Sword Grief before, and finally realized that the Oneness Sky Palace was really in great trouble this time.
<br><br>
At this time, huge swords surrounded the Oneness Array.
<br><br>
On top of the swords' hilts stood Athemar, Goran, and the other Oneness Governors.
<br><br>
Then, two old men with grey hair stood on the two swords at the forefront of the Oneness Array.
<br><br>
The man on the left was Pearce Gan, who had been following Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The man on the right was called Auden Ning.
<br><br>
Many important officials of the Oneness Sky Palace were gathered on the Oneness Mountain. They were the group with the most number of members and also the strongest, but their respective leader was not there.
<br><br>
Everyone present had extraordinary auras, but none of them was confident.
<br><br>
"Based on the movement of the Sun Crows, they still intend to break the Vastness Array and capture the Mountain Sea Pass. It seems easy, but in reality it is very dangerous for them," said Pearce. He took out a small golden gourd as he spoke, pulled the cork, and took a sip of the wine.
<br><br>
Auden's wrinkly face convulsed. The man was dressed in a cloth gown and he looked like an ordinary woodcutter. On his right hand was a rusty sword.
<br><br>
Despite his plain appearance, all of the Oneness Governors in the gathering highly respected him.
<br><br>
He and Pearce were known as Eastern Emperor Taiyi's very capable assistants. Both of them were slightly stronger than the Oneness Governors and were as strong as the mountain leaders.
<br><br>
"The Sun Crows clearly know what will happen," Auden said in a shaky voice. "Once their main forces have gotten close to the Mountain Sea Pass, the nearest three passes and three arrays will kill them. They will suffer heavy casualties," he continued.
<br><br>
While he explained, his fingers drew lines in the air and pointed out the locations of the passes, such as the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Athemar, Goran, and the others silently stared at the lines and passes and studied them seriously.
<br><br>
"Elder Auden is right. Anyone with a discerning eye can see that it is a trap.
<br><br>
They won't choose to do so, unless they are really arrogant, or..." Before Athemar could finish his sentence, he abruptly stopped.
<br><br>
At that moment, all of them began to feel anxious. No words were needed for them to know what could obviously happen.
<br><br>
It was known that Gethin wasn't convinced when Eastern Emperor Taiyi had beaten him in the past. He had never admitted defeat.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, since the Vastness Mountain was one of the seven mountains, they could never rebel after Eastern Emperor Taiyi had taken control of the Bloom Divine Province. Thus, the Xu Clan and the Vastness Mountain both lived under the roof of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Yet, in the past few years, Gethin had secretly expanded his influence until the Vastness Mountain became as powerful as the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Although he never revealed his ambition, everyone knew what he wanted.
<br><br>
Even then, he never dared to betray Eastern Emperor Taiyi as long as the emperor was alive.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, a great opportunity had now presented itself to him! If he wanted to rebel, he could help the Sun Crows from within the Sky Net.
<br><br>
That could be the exact reason why the Sun Crows chose to attack Mountain Sea Pass first.
<br><br>
These people from the Oneness Sky Palace were all intelligent beings, so they immediately knew what Gethin was up to based on some of his obscure movements. "What can we do? Are we going to attack Gethin now?" Goran asked. "Kill him," Auden answered with a glint in his eyes.
<br><br>
"He hasn't rebelled; that was only our guess. If he really wants to rebel, then he must be well prepared," said Pearce as he closed his eyes.
<br><br>
"Everything would be fine if Eastern Emperor Taiyi was here, but since he is not, we will be at a dead end sooner or later," he added. "Well, we can't just sit still and wait for death no matter what. Now that things have come to this, we can only follow the established plan.
<br><br>
If Gethin really dares to rebel…" Athemar countered, his eyes filled with determination.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. If he dares to rebel, I will perish with him," Auden reassured with a hesitant voice.
<br><br>
The second he was done speaking, he stomped his feet on the ground.
<br><br>
In turn, all the Lofty Swords outside the Oneness Array began to glow.
<br><br>
It was Athemar who had made all the Lofty Swords, but everyone had control over them.
<br><br>
As the Sun Crows continued to advance, everyone in the seven arrays and the twelve passes got ready to fight.
<br><br>
On the lower tier of the Mountain Sea Pass "Alas, I thought we didn't need to be the bait since we had General Zen, but..."
<br><br>
"Now, we don't even have a chance to be the bait. With so many Sun Crows, we are doomed!"
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter. As human beings, we have to protect our families!"
<br><br>
At that point, the Sun Crows had covered the entire heaven and earth. Even though the Other Shore Realm warriors on the lower tier couldn't see clearly what was happening, they knew that the Sun Crows were serious about this war.
<br><br>
The reason they had hesitated earlier was that the Oneness Guards had driven them out to fight, but they themselves remained in the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Now that everyone, including the Oneness Generals and the Oneness Guards, was ready to attack, they did not complain anymore.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Sinclair felt his throat run dry at the sight of the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
As a leader, he should've said something reassuring to their army, but now he was restless and didn't know what to say.
<br><br>
Suddenly, purple lights glowed from behind the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Those lights transformed into swords that were tens of millions of feet long, and anyone who saw the lights felt their power and strength. Then, the sharp lights pierced through the air. It looked like they could penetrate through everything.
<br><br>
"The Vastness Array is activated! Everyone, don't be discouraged. With the Vastness Array's support, we will not lose this battle!" Sinclair finally shouted to boost their army's morale.
<br><br>
The shining sword radiance truly did make them feel more confident. The Oneness Guards, and the ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm finally felt resolute.
<br><br>
At the source of the lights, an extraordinary aura emanated from Gethin as he sat cross-legged, his gaze fixed on the northeast.
<br><br>
"Sinclair in the Mountain Sea Pass ahead is encouraging his soldiers,"
<br><br>
Natasha said in an enchanting voice from beside Gethin.
<br><br>
"I'm wondering what expression he will have if he knows the truth. Haha..." a leader of the intelligence agency sneered.
<br><br>
Gethin snorted. "Those old men are smart and cunning. I'm afraid they have already figured out the truth seeing the Sun Crows' movements," he commented.
<br><br>
A detached smile graced Natasha's lips. "So what? You didn't play any dirty tricks. What else can they do?" she remarked.
<br><br>
The Vastness Mountain's rebellion wasn't actually a secret conspiracy, considering that the Oneness Sky Palace was already in danger. In fact, Gethin was open about it because he was sure that the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't do anything to him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3635 Powerful Defense The countless Sun Crows formed a black ocean as they raced towards the Sky Net.
<br><br>
When the mass of crows were within twenty miles of the Sky Net, they broke their original formation and swarmed together to move in one direction. Towards the Mountain Sea Pass! The moment they did so though, the Sky Net also began to shift and change.
<br><br>
It had originally been traversing across the southwest, but now it had begun to fold and roll away from the Mountain Sea Pass to advance on the mass of Sun Crows. It looked to be attempting to encircle them! As it began to roll inwards on either side, the generals and soldiers of the Battle Rage Pass on the left, and those of the Heaven Wind Pass on the right, began to converge on the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Other generals and soldiers from the six arrays and eleven passes, excluding those in the Vastness Array and the Mountain Sea Pass, advanced forward along the sides of the Sky Net.
<br><br>
Splash! As the battalion of Sun Crows grew closer, they scattered, putting more and more distance between each of them.
<br><br>
In their reformation, they could now see a smaller group of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows amongst them.
<br><br>
At the sight of about 100 Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, the warriors of the seven arrays of the Oneness Sky Palace emerged grim-faced.
<br><br>
"The Sun Crow race... They are absolutely insane!"
<br><br>
"I can't believe Emperor Charm has released the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows..."
<br><br>
"They are the basis of their race. They truly plan to wage a mighty battle against the Oneness Sky Palace."
<br><br>
In the past, the two factions had a peaceful relationship. They had allied themselves, and their leaders had known one another quite well.
<br><br>
There was no doubt at all that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were incredibly powerful, but they rarely ever fought unless their race found themselves faced with the crisis of possible extinction. So the others were boggled as to why they showed up now. They were determined to destroy the Oneness Sky Palace! Elizabeth's lips stretched into a charming smile as she sat at the top.
<br><br>
There were countless humans gathering like ants behind the Sky Net.
<br><br>
As far as Elizabeth was concerned, apart from the masters of the Oneness Sky Palace, the soldiers at the Other Shore Realm were the same as these brainless Sun Crows. They were all meaningless and just numbers to her.
<br><br>
Their numbers would dwindle and disappear, their bodies turning to cheap dust and being swept away with the wind into the sky, forever lost.
<br><br>
Such was the terrible, pathetic lives of the weak.
<br><br>
"Begin the first wave of attacks."
<br><br>
Elizabeth stretched her hands out slightly in front of her.
<br><br>
A gentle glow began to emanate from her shoulders, and turned into a ray of golden light as it wrapped along her arms. The glow was nearly blinding as it stretched past her wrists and towards her fingertips.
<br><br>
Buzz! Once the golden light met her fingertips, it bloomed and spread away from her fingers.
<br><br>
The Sun Crows, even the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows for all their power, did not possess intelligence. They were under the control of the Divine Lair, which was under the command of Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Since Emperor Charm was nowhere to be found, they were controlled by Elizabeth in this war.
<br><br>
As the light spread farther from her fingertips, the eyes of the many Sun Crows glowed with the simple message-attack.
<br><br>
Quack! Quack! Quack! As one, they rushed to the Sky Net.
<br><br>
In response, Zen and the other Oneness Generals entered the positions of the array once again.
<br><br>
Sinclair stood at the forefront, watching impassively as the Sun Crows charged forward. Without a single thought, he roared, "Soldiers of the Mountain Sea Pass, attack!"
<br><br>
He had used much strength behind the command, so much so, that it had drowned out the cry of the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
"Soldiers of the Battle Rage Pass, attack!"
<br><br>
"Soldiers of the Heaven Wind Pass..."
<br><br>
All Oneness Generals in the remaining eleven passes responded in kind in the distance.
<br><br>
The Oneness Guards and the warriors at the Other Shore Realm who were stationed in the passes activated their Other Shore Tokens in a flash and were there to greet the first attacks of the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
In a battle of this magnitude, Zen found it hard to concentrate and determine those he should protect.
<br><br>
He sat upright at his position, eyes closed. There was a constant energy pulsing from his body, and into the space around him.
<br><br>
He had only used 128 transparent long swords earlier; however, as he continued to draw out the Other Shore Power now, the number of swords increased exponentially.
<br><br>
Each sword contained ten divine megatons of force, and this time he had drawn out sixteen thousand divine megatons of force! The sight of more than 1, 000 flying swords nearly made Basil's eyes pop out of their sockets.
<br><br>
Not to mention the difficulty of controlling the swords, the amount of force it took to shape them was no laughing matter. What incredible Other Shore Tokens had Zen fused with? Now was not the time to question him though. After watching the spectacle for a long moment, Basil held his long sword in the air and made a wide arc towards the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
"Rise!"
<br><br>
Sixteen hundred flying swords spiraled up as if they were jubilant, dancing birds, and entangled with each other before rushing into the sky.
<br><br>
Every time a sword pierced through a Sun Crow, a spray of blood would burst from the bird in a cloud of red mist. The weapons were efficient and quick with ridding the sky of the creatures. They had at least cleaned up a good portion of them on the front line.
<br><br>
"It's that human brat again!"
<br><br>
Queenie glared at the swords, her eyes glinting dangerously and promising death. "Who will destroy the positions of the array with me?" she cried.
<br><br>
"I will!"
<br><br>
"Queenie, allow us to do it together!"
<br><br>
Two demon women cried in response.
<br><br>
It seemed Elizabeth's goal was not to destroy the Mountain Sea Pass, but the Sky Net.
<br><br>
The task of demolishing the Mountain Sea Pass was assigned to the demon women of the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
A sharp swishing noise cut through the air.
<br><br>
Queenie swiftly grabbed the air before her, taking hold of the Invisibility Curtain. With a nonchalant wave of her hand, the five-colored light curtain enveloped three Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. They disappeared instantaneously.
<br><br>
The size of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows took up much space though, so their sudden disappearance easily attracted Zen's attention.
<br><br>
Zen waved his hands beside him, drawing out some of the flying swords and sent them hurting towards the seemingly empty air.
<br><br>
As they neared the space, there were several harsh clanking sounds.
<br><br>
The swords had encountered some kind of resistance.
<br><br>
Zen's expression did not change despite his irritation. The ten divine megatons of force could obviously easily kill the fragile Sun Crows, but this was different.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were massive, and not ordinary in any way.
<br><br>
"Assemble!"
<br><br>
Swords cut through the air with loud whooshing noises.
<br><br>
The swords were starting to merge, and as they combined they could contain more and more strength.
<br><br>
"Five thousand divine megatons of force!" Zen called.
<br><br>
One of the swords finally pierced through the false void.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, there was another harsh, metallic clang.
<br><br>
The sword had met yet another barrier, and spun away from the void.
<br><br>
There was a brief flicker of surprise on Zen's face. The defensive power of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows far exceeded his expectations.
<br><br>
"Eight thousand divine megatons of force!" he snarled.
<br><br>
The spiraling sword corrected itself, and once more zipped towards the void at alarming speed.
<br><br>
Another sharp clang.
<br><br>
The sound echoed in his ears as the sword spun away erratically.
<br><br>
"Fifteen thousand divine megatons of force!" he yelled, his voice shaking.
<br><br>
Zen stopped releasing power to a majority of flying swords, and then forced all the power into a long sword and sent it towards the void once more.
<br><br>
A crack was heard.
<br><br>
The sword had finally pierced through an object in the void, but it seemed to have only made it half a foot.
<br><br>
Although he was elated that the sword had gotten through, he was still shocked to learn it didn't go any farther. With a clenched fist, he released the power within the sword. "How troublesome..." he grumbled to himself.
<br><br>
The power of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows was far beyond his expectations.
<br><br>
"How troublesome is it, exactly?" Basil asked in confusion. He had heard Zen's softly spoken words.
<br><br>
Zen pointed ahead and said, "Take a look."
<br><br>
The three Corpse Spirit Sun Crows that had been hiding were now slowly descending as the Invisibility Curtain was taken away by Queenie. The mouths of the now visible massive creatures were alight with blue flames.
<br><br>
Chapter 3636 The Power Of The Flames The strong azure flames burned brightly as they gave off a striking aura.
<br><br>
Even so, Zen had already expected such a thing when he had attacked the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
The moment he saw that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were about to spit flames, he immediately shouted, "Everyone, get out of here!"
<br><br>
Then, he quickly rushed to the far right side of the position.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Basil was also quick to react. As soon as Zen finished speaking, he sped up and moved to the right as well.
<br><br>
The other Oneness Generals also followed suit and dodged to the side in pairs.
<br><br>
However, two Oneness Generals in a position behind Sinclair panicked and dashed towards the opposite directions.
<br><br>
As a result, their position didn't move with either of them.
<br><br>
When one of them realized what happened, he ran to the other side and three Corpse Spirit Sun Crows spat out fire in return.
<br><br>
"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, three blue flames with mysterious sparks were shot forward and swallowed the position in an instant.
<br><br>
The two Oneness Generals stood in the position and as they looked at the blue flames that were heading towards them, they thought of leaving things to chance.
<br><br>
Perhaps the blue flames from the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were not that powerful.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, they would soon realize that they were very wrong.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! At that moment, the array of the Mountain Sea Pass, the positions that protected Zen, Sinclair, and the others, and the transparent long swords they had formed all shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
What was worse was that the people who guarded the main array had no time to stabilize it with more divine crystals.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the two Oneness Generals who faced the blue flames were burnt to ashes and vanished without a trace when their position was broken.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the blue flames continued to fly forward, but they did not hit the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
That was because the Sky Net had appeared and blocked the flames when they were about to approach the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Although the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were powerful, they couldn't tear the Sky Net apart with only a few flames from their mouths.
<br><br>
"Sisters, I'll leave the rest to you. I'll deal with that guy!" Queenie said as a coquettish red light flashed in her eyes.
<br><br>
Since Zen had almost killed her just now, she naturally wanted to take revenge and kill him herself.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The second she finished speaking, the Invisibility Curtain in her hand spread in the air, and then she and a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow completely disappeared.
<br><br>
The Mountain Sea Pass was damaged, and the shattered array couldn't protect Sinclair and the other Oneness Generals anymore.
<br><br>
Now, they had no room to retreat.
<br><br>
In the end, the Oneness Guards and the Other Shore Realm warriors in the Mountain Sea Pass ran outside the Sky Net and fought against the enemy.
<br><br>
Since they were Oneness Generals, they also couldn't retreat to the Sky Net.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Sky Net was not omnipotent. Once it collapsed, they would still have to face the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen saw that Queenie and the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow disappeared, he became more vigilant. He began to fly backward, a long sword in his hand.
<br><br>
"Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship!" he shouted.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
In turn, streaks of sword light swiftly formed a net and advanced forward.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's defense power was quite strong, so he didn't expect the golden light to injure it.
<br><br>
In the next second, the net-shaped sword light cut across the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's body with a muffled sound. Just like he had guessed, Queenie had driven the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow to try to attack him.
<br><br>
Even though the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was gone, the sword net still drew its shape.
<br><br>
"Kill him," Queenie, who stood on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, ordered in a cold voice.
<br><br>
Despite Zen having injured her, she still didn't think that he was a powerful being.
<br><br>
Instead, she believed that he defeated her with the array of the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A strong gust of wind blew as the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow circled in the air, its wide wings like thick blades that slashed towards Zen.
<br><br>
In return, he relied on the continuous sword radiance as the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow continued to assault him.
<br><br>
He took a slight step back and suddenly jumped backward, and successfully avoided the wings' attack.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Just as he had dodged, several deep and wide cuts appeared on the ground.
<br><br>
Zen was shocked to see those cuts the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow had made, but he didn't show it.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow seemed to have no intelligence, so it couldn't possibly cultivate—let alone enter the Other Shore. Therefore, how did it release so many divine megatons of force? Crack! Crack! Crack! Just as he thought about it, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow launched a series of attacks once again, so he quickly dodged and slashed with the sword radiance in response.
<br><br>
After he had blocked about six strikes in a row, Queenie's beautiful eyes narrowed into slits, and then she flapped her wings and left the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. It wasn't long before she had quietly passed through the net of sword radiance and was now near Zen.
<br><br>
Clap! Clap! When she finally landed, she stretched out her hands and quickly patted Zen on the shoulder two times.
<br><br>
The seemingly gentle pat left two lock-shaped marks on Zen's shoulder.
<br><br>
Right after the lock-shaped marks appeared, he felt his arms and legs become incomparably heavy. It turned out that his limbs were fixed in place and he couldn't move at all! "You are dead..." Queenie whispered with a smile.
<br><br>
Then, she turned around and did not look back.
<br><br>
Not far away was the hidden Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, which finally showed up.
<br><br>
Its mouth spurted out blue flames as it passed by Queenie and headed straight towards Zen.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Alas, Zen failed to dodge. The blue flames had hit him and devoured his entire body.
<br><br>
Queenie's wings flapped as she looked down from the air, her eyes filled with pride.
<br><br>
The blue flames that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow spat out was also a kind of divine flame of the Sun Crow race. The Sun Crow race classified their flames, and one of the deadliest flames among them was the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's, which was only inferior to Emperor Charm's.
<br><br>
As an Oneness General, Zen was quick to react, but he would die as the flames had hit him.
<br><br>
The whole battlefield was in chaos, but the light of the blue flames still attracted some people's attention.
<br><br>
Even Sinclair, who was busy killing the Sun Crows, froze when he saw the scene. He sighed a little and looked away.
<br><br>
Of course, he thought that Zen was an outstanding young man. After all, Zen had just left the Land of Sword Grief, yet he had displayed such strength. It was rare to see a talent like him, so it was a pity that he died like that.
<br><br>
Basil, Guzman, and the others were also shocked, but they couldn't think too much as they were in the middle of a fight.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The blue flames continued to burn Zen's body for over thirty seconds, but he simply stood still. After a while, golden spirals materialized on his body and absorbed the flames.
<br><br>
The situation wasn't new to him as he intentionally or even unintentionally let various kinds of flames burn him all the time. Most of the time, however, those flames did not have much effect on him.
<br><br>
He had taken the test of the God of Fire, known as Zhurong, back in the Creation Myth Temple, but sadly that was only an illusion the Primeval Lord of Heaven had made. Thus, it didn't benefit his physical body at all.
<br><br>
Chapter 3637 Control The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow Although at first intimidated by the blue flame's strength, Zen didn't think that it could harm him in any way.
<br><br>
Just as the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow stopped spewing out flames, Zen abruptly jumped up to rush towards Queenie.
<br><br>
Queenie, who thought that Zen died, had shifted and fixed her gaze on another Oneness General.
<br><br>
Just as she flapped her wings to return to and mount the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, Zen had unexpectedly pounced on her.
<br><br>
Queenie was caught off guard. She never expected Zen to return safely from the blue flames! The look of astonishment on her face froze as Zen's long sword pierced right through her chest. At that point, her Chaotic Source Spirits had managed to restore to just thirty percent of their original power after Zen had consumed it earlier.
<br><br>
That meant his sword was only met with slight resistance before it successfully pierced her through the chest.
<br><br>
"I thought…the fire…killed you…" Queenie stuttered in confusion with whatever remaining strength she had.
<br><br>
"Well, you thought wrong," Zen replied.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Upon finishing his sentence, he suddenly withdrew his long sword from her chest before wielding and slashing it to split her into two.
<br><br>
Now that he had successfully slaughtered Queenie, Zen returned his gaze to the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
Because it no longer had a master to order it around, the beast appeared lost and clueless as to what its next move should be.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was like a puppet, useless without a master controlling it.
<br><br>
As Zen thought it through, he suddenly remembered the human race's Civilization Artifact. Apart from the Primeval Lord of Heaven's energy soul, there was also Emperor Charm's energy soul in that Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
Although these energy souls weren't their real bodies, they still possessed and retained their memories and auras.
<br><br>
As he was casually wiping out dozens of approaching Sun Crows, another thought flashed through Zen's inner world and called out to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
His inner world had undergone tremendous change ever since carrying the human race's Civilization Artifact. All of this was caused by the Primeval Lord of Heaven and other energy souls that had been carrying out experiments on his inner world.
<br><br>
The successful integration of the Civilization Artifact into Zen's body meant that he trusted them. During this period of transformation, even the Regal Jade Spirit often followed the Primeval Lord of Heaven and kept asking numerous questions.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven raised his brows after learning Zen's encounters and thoughts in his inner world. He then pointed a finger to the book in the air.
<br><br>
After a few pages were turned, a handsome man appeared. It was none other than Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"What? Corpse Spirit Sun Crow?" The emperor's face appeared shocked.
<br><br>
"Although my avatar betrayed the Finale Way, he is able now. He's even summoned the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows…"
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm, are you able to control them?" Zen's question rang in his inner world.
<br><br>
"It'll be a piece of cake," Emperor Charm assured Zen.
<br><br>
Soon, the shadow of the book materialized above Zen's head. The outline of Emperor Charm's head stretched out from the pages. With the help of the Civilization Artifact, Emperor Charm began to get a glimpse of the world over a thousand chaotic eras later.
<br><br>
What he witnessed truly vexed him.
<br><br>
The Sun Crows, blocking the sun and sky with their massive wings, fought with the humans. This stirred up some unhappy memories he had kept.
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm, I'm talking about that Corpse Spirit Sun Crow," Zen explained and pointed towards the large bird ahead.
<br><br>
The other demon women were locked in combat with the Oneness Generals, and so none of them took heed of Zen.
<br><br>
"You can mount it," Emperor Charm said.
<br><br>
Without saying a word, Zen jumped onto Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's back.
<br><br>
Immediately, a strange yet familiar feeling came over him. He realized that not only could he control the beast, he could also control the Other Shore Token that was embedded in its body as well. "This Corpse Spirit Sun Crow has quite an…unusual Other Shore Token…"
<br><br>
The token the bird carried within it was shaped like a spindle similar to a fruit core.
<br><br>
"It's considered an Other Shore Treasure," Emperor Charm informed nonchalantly. "It's the Demonic Star Fruit. Only about a hundred in total exist. I only placed them in Stage Thirty-One. Unexpectedly, another me had found them…"
<br><br>
The Other Shore Treasure in the Source World could carry the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
But most of the Other Shore Treasures weren't strong enough to carry Other Shore Tokens in higher level due to their limited strength.
<br><br>
The Demonic Star Fruits had many divine megatons of force, and how did the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows carry them… Getting to the bottom of that matter would have to wait. Now, Zen stood on top of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow he mounted and gazed at the other Sun Crows that were located not too far away. A thought then flashed through his mind.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow beneath his feet opened its mouth and from deep within it burst brilliant blue flames.
<br><br>
Whoosh! How powerful were the blue flames, exactly? So powerful that they had reduced the ordinary Sun Crows to nothing but ashes.
<br><br>
"This way!"
<br><br>
"Left! Burn them now!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Under Zen's control, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow constantly spewed out blue flames in all directions and burned thousands of Sun Crows to ashes.
<br><br>
Not far away, Jago and the other warriors at the Other Shore Realm were running wildly.
<br><br>
Normally, it wouldn't be difficult for a Oneness General and a five-star Oneness Guard to kill the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
However, with the strength of Jago and his peers, they could do nothing but escape in the face of thousands of Sun Crows.
<br><br>
"Those Sharp-winged Sun Crows are rushing down!"
<br><br>
"Everyone, get down!"
<br><br>
At this order, everyone in the group lowered themselves to the ground as quickly as possible.
<br><br>
Soon, the Sharp-winged Sun Crows began to rain down on them like lightning bolts during a heavy storm.
<br><br>
Reflexively, Jago lay on the ground with his body huddled up, trembling with fear.
<br><br>
He had no chance of fighting these vicious beasts at all.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The whistle of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows slicing the air was followed by the deaths of dozens of people—many of them with their stomachs sliced wide open.
<br><br>
Hot blood splashed onto Jago's face.
<br><br>
More than half of the 300 people who made up the group were slaughtered in this single attack alone.
<br><br>
"I'll slaughter them even if it means death!"
<br><br>
One terrified man exclaimed as he prepared to activate his Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Other Shore Tokens that originated from Stage Two or Stage Three couldn't work in this kind of battles at all. Using it against the swift Sharp-winged Sun Crows would be useless.
<br><br>
Before that man could activate his Other Shore Token, one of the Sharpwinged Sun Crows swooped down and slashed his neck. He was beheaded before he even got the chance to cry out.
<br><br>
Jago felt nothing but utter hopelessness as he witnessed his comrades drop dead all around him.
<br><br>
'How can Flag Master… survive this?' Jago's mind went blank as he realized he'd be unable to protect himself now.
<br><br>
But he still clung to the hope that Zen would be able to save him. Although at this point, it seemed quite impossible… Swoosh! A sudden wave of heat passed over his face.
<br><br>
All he saw above him was a brilliant blue flame before an enormous Sun Crow landed beside him.
<br><br>
"Come on up!" Zen beckoned from the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
Blinking his eyes, Jago could hardly understand what was happening in front of him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3638 Grabbing Jago had been staring at Zen with his eyes wide open for a few seconds.
<br><br>
After a while, he was jolted back to his senses by his desire to live.
<br><br>
As soon as he had lifted himself off the ground, he bolted straight towards the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow and jumped on its back.
<br><br>
"Flag Master, forgive my ignorance. But why are you able to command the Sun Crow?" Jago looked thoroughly awestruck as he asked Zen.
<br><br>
It went without saying that he knew how terrifying a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was. It seemed incredulous that Zen was able to control it.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were enormous. Moreover, they were aggressively assaulting the Sky Net above. The warriors of the Other Shore Realm as well as the Oneness Guards were not even qualified to be the opponents of these magnificent and powerful Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Zen remained standing straight on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
He was controlling it to spew out blue flames constantly. As he heard Jago's question, he seemed amused. "You can do the same," he replied calmly.
<br><br>
"What? That can't be right!"
<br><br>
Jago was utterly bewildered at Zen's answer. Meanwhile, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow flapped its massive wings splendidly and swiftly soared forward.
<br><br>
Most of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows had already gathered above. They charged fearlessly towards the Sky Net as commanded by Elizabeth. There were only a few Corpse Spirit Sun Crows left to deal with the Oneness Generals inside the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
"Wow! That looks terrifying," Jago exclaimed as he observed their movements.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, a stream of blue flame hurtled down from the sky. It narrowly missed Sinclair as he rolled on the ground to dodge it. However, the heat of the flames had singed his hair.
<br><br>
He had the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits to thank. Without it, his body would have been badly burned by that attack.
<br><br>
As he was dodging the flames from above and on the ground, Sinclair brandished his long sword and slashed three times towards the direction of the sky.
<br><br>
"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"
<br><br>
"Three Consecutive Punishment Slashes!" Sinclair shouted at the top of his lungs.
<br><br>
Three rays of sword radiance broke through the air. They dragged the traces of countless space cracks and slashed at the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow above.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow didn't dodge his attack at all. It seemed like it wasn't taking Sinclair's three slashes seriously.
<br><br>
"Puff! Puff! Puff!"
<br><br>
The theurgy of swordsmanship that Sinclair cultivated was an extremely offensive technique. However, the sword radiance didn't even damage the feather of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow as his attack landed.
<br><br>
"Unbelievable. These Corpse Spirit Sun Crows really are too strong. I can't stand against them..."
<br><br>
As Sinclair admitted this, a look of complete disappointment registered on his face When he was guarding the Mountain Sea Pass, he was very much aware of the fact that he would have to fight to the death.
<br><br>
There were so many of his companions that had met their demise in the Grand River Fortress. He was very lucky to have been able to escape and survive this long. He thought it was enough for him to have lived for more days than his companions.
<br><br>
As he thought of this, his fighting spirit declined significantly. He felt quite hopeless and dejected now. However, he was still fighting.
<br><br>
"What a foolish human! You will end up the same way as your companions no matter how much you struggle. Give up now!" a demon woman mocked and taunted Sinclair as she stood on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow opened its huge beak once more and spat out blue flames towards Sinclair.
<br><br>
Sinclair was now facing death as a stream of flames shot towards him from above. He didn't have any option left other than to escape and run away once more.
<br><br>
"Swoosh..."
<br><br>
At that very moment, Sinclair spotted another huge shadow sweeping past the corner of his eyes.
<br><br>
"What rotten luck. Here comes another Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. It's such a waste of energy for such powerful existences to deal with me, a mere Oneness General. Alas..." Sinclair sighed deeply. He was starting to accept that he would most probably lose his life here.
<br><br>
He couldn't even stand a chance against one Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. One was already more than enough to kill him, let alone two of those powerful beings.
<br><br>
The demon woman of the Divine Lair who stood on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was also surprised to see another one of these creatures.
<br><br>
She thought she would be able to dispose of the Oneness General with ease.
<br><br>
Therefore, she didn't need anyone else to interfere. However, she noticed that the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was soaring at her direction at an extremely fast speed. It showed no sign of slowing down. Soon enough, the demon woman finally realized that something wasn't quite right.
<br><br>
It was too late. She didn't have any time to redirect her Corpse Spirit Sun Crow out of the way. The other Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was flying so fast towards her that she wouldn't be able to dodge the attack. Moreover, she couldn't quite see who was controlling it. She only saw a manly figure dismounting the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crow and rushing in front of her at lightning speed.
<br><br>
"Oh, no..." She only had one choice now.
<br><br>
The demon woman left her mount without the slightest hesitation. But as soon as she dismounted and flew upwards, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow on the opposite instantly raised its massive wings and slashed at her from a very suitable height.
<br><br>
"Puff..."
<br><br>
The wings of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow were extraordinarily strong. Even Zen could hardly withstand their attack. In the blink of an eye, the demon woman was chopped into pieces.
<br><br>
Zen soared towards the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow and resumed his position on its back. He turned around and smiled at Jago. "I told you you could do it too."
<br><br>
What Zen told him was true. It was not that difficult to control a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. Jago was able to enter the Other Shore Realm. Thus, it meant the strength of his soul was more than enough to command it.
<br><br>
When they went over to where the second Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was, Jago was the one who controlled the first one. Zen just frightened the demon woman enough to make her leave her mount. In this way, they got the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow very easily.
<br><br>
"Incredible! I can control it too!"
<br><br>
Jago exclaimed excitedly.
<br><br>
Never in his wildest dreams did it occur that he would be able to take control of such a powerful and magnificent existence.
<br><br>
While he was pondering on this newfound ability, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow under his feet suddenly spurted blue flames towards the distance.
<br><br>
They effectively burned thousands of Sun Crows to ashes.
<br><br>
Below them, Sinclair couldn't believe his eyes. He was completely dumbfounded when he saw Zen grab a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow with such ease.
<br><br>
Putting aside Zen's peculiar means, he knew it was impossible to take hold of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. These were known as powerful weapons used by the Sun Crow race. However, Zen was able to put the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow under his control as soon as he gently leapt on its back. It was simply unbelievable.
<br><br>
As Zen stepped lightly on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, it descended to the ground smoothly. "General Sinclair, please get on." He smiled encouragingly.
<br><br>
"I... I can get on it too? Incredible." Sinclair felt completely flattered and amazed.
<br><br>
"Of course! Come with me and let's grab another Corpse Spirit Sun Crow!"
<br><br>
Zen replied graciously.
<br><br>
When they launched a broad attack, Queenie ordered three Corpse Spirit Sun Crows to target the Mountain Sea Pass. Now, there was only one Corpse Spirit Sun Crow chasing the other Oneness Generals in the Mountain Sea Pass.
<br><br>
As soon as Sinclair stepped on the back of one, the two Corpse Spirit Sun Crows flew upwards once again.
<br><br>
They soared high up in the sky towards the other Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Nearly a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were spurting out blue flames simultaneously. The swirling flames poured onto the Sky Net above.
<br><br>
The defensive power of the Sky Net Array should not be underestimated. It was highly regarded as one of the most powerful skills of the Oneness Sky Palace. No matter how wildly the blue flame burned, the Sky Net remained unmoved and unharmed.
<br><br>
The blue light of the flames shone on Elizabeth's face. Her beautiful eyes were full of confident calmness.
<br><br>
She believed that no matter how tough the Sky Net was, it would eventually collapse. If they continued to burn it like this, it would only be a matter of time before they broke through it.
<br><br>
Once the Sky Net Array was broken, the Sun Crow race would charge forward. Then, they would launch an all-out attack.
<br><br>
Elizabeth thought that as long as she attacked the Sky Net, all the powerful warriors in the seven mountains would be drawn out.
<br><br>
She had commanded the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows to burn the Sky Net for quite a while now. However, the strong warriors in the seven mountains still did not take any action. It was only the Oneness Guards and the Oneness Generals stationed in the twelve passes that rushed out of the Sky Net and fought with the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
After the blue flames had continued burning the Sky Net for five minutes, streaks of sword light shot into the sky from behind it.
<br><br>
"Well, well. So you finally lose your cool?" Elizabeth's mouth curled into a taunting smile.
<br><br>
"Impressive!" she remarked as she observed the streaks of sword light.
<br><br>
A hundred thousand feet long ray of sword radiance unfolded from afar. It seemed to be able to cut the sky in halves as it passed through the Sky Net without resistance. Moreover, it accurately slashed toward Elizabeth's direction.
<br><br>
Elizabeth remained sitting upright on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
It was as though she was merely sitting on a small boat that was moving with the tide. She gently swayed to the side to avoid the sword radiance.
<br><br>
Just like Elizabeth, the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crows hovering in front of her easily avoided the sword radiance. It seemed like they were not in the same space at all.
<br><br>
Chapter 3639 My Words Carry No Weight It was the leader of the Golden Mountain.
<br><br>
When the sword radiance missed completely, the look on the leader's face did not flinch or change a bit.
<br><br>
Instead, he raised his golden sword horizontally, and the roaring noises of dragons and tigers echoed from the blade of the sword.
<br><br>
With his other hand, he pinched the sword and suddenly slashed out the golden sword. There were flames of fury behind his eyes.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Just then, the huge sword radiance roared away once again.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the leaders of the other six mountains waited patiently for orders from the Oneness Mountain. They made sure to never leave the arrays that they were guarding.
<br><br>
Though the attack was powerful, it remained a challenge to hurt Elizabeth or any of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! After the leader of the Golden Mountain finally made his move, a violent wind rushed out from the other side. Apparently, countless swords were hidden in the wind, and this same wind swept away taking the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows and Elizabeth with it.
<br><br>
"Destroy!"
<br><br>
The Azure Mountain's leader declared.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! The forceful gusts of wind released bolts of lightning that exploded in all directions.
<br><br>
Elizabeth sat firmly and calmly on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
The corners of her mouth lifted up into a smile. "It seems that these old men don't even dare to come out. Are they just going to test it like this?"
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, snake-shaped sword shadows began to approach her.
<br><br>
These shadows created gray marks in the air, and multiplied dramatically over time. This was the move from the Bright Mountain, and it could cross spaces in order to hit its targets.
<br><br>
Because Elizabeth relied on a spatial magic treasure, she and the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows could easily avoid the attacks aimed at them. The leader of the Bright Mountain only hoped that the snake-shaped sword shadows would be able to hit her.
<br><br>
However, though the shadows continued to spread out, they could not get to Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Swish! Right before Elizabeth, an intense purple light shot up from the ground and pierced the sky. Afterwards, it descended and landed right above her head.
<br><br>
It was a very long purple sword! Boom! When the purple sword landed, it did not cause any pain to Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Rather, it brought out a purple glow that spread throughout the sky.
<br><br>
Elizabeth took a look at the purple glow, growing a mocking smile at their vain attacks.
<br><br>
The Vastness Mountain had already become a chess piece of Emperor Charm. What was ironic was that they still had to act otherwise before the other six mountains.
<br><br>
It was standard that the seven mountains used their own methods to attack behind the Sky Net. However, this was a tentative attack, and it was close to nothing.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a number of warriors stood on the Lofty Swords in the Oneness Array, trying to discuss what happened and what to do next.
<br><br>
"Are we going to start?" Auden asked the group.
<br><br>
Pearce's eyes squinted, trying to focus on what was happening so far away.
<br><br>
"I think we should wait a little longer..."
<br><br>
"But being burned by the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, the Sky Net won't hold on for long," said Auden.
<br><br>
Among all the powerful swordsmen present, Auden had the highest attainments in arrays. He had also participated in the establishment of the Sky Net in the first place.
<br><br>
He knew that although the Sky Net was sturdy, it could never endure continuous powerful attacks.
<br><br>
"What's more, the Oneness Generals have already suffered a great loss,"
<br><br>
said Athemar, who was next to Auden.
<br><br>
In battle, all the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace had been used to their limit. If the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards and the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were killed, it would be a loss that the warriors of the various sword sects grieved.
<br><br>
Everyone who was there could resonate with Pearce's worry.
<br><br>
As for their opponents, the Sun Crow race, only Elizabeth led a group to join the battle.
<br><br>
Elizabeth's strength was actually on the same level with that of Athemar and the rest. While the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were powerful, they were like puppets who lacked intelligence. Therefore, it would be impossible for those Corpse Spirit Sun Crows to break through the defense line of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
But since Elizabeth was so calm, she must have a powerful backup.
<br><br>
Still unwilling to take any action, Pearce had some misgivings. He hesitated, then reached out for a communication token. "Master Gentry, can you lead the Golden Mountain to attack first?"
<br><br>
If they exerted all the strength of a mountain, there was no way Elizabeth and the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows could resist. Then they would have to show their trump cards.
<br><br>
Only after Pearce figured out her trump card, could he lead the Oneness Sky Palace to deal with her.
<br><br>
That was the only chance.
<br><br>
If the mountain leaders were all killed, the remaining warriors in the seven mountains wouldn't be able to protect the Oneness Sky Palace for long.
<br><br>
They would be doomed to lose.
<br><br>
"I will follow your orders but the seven mountains are connected and we should fight back together," the leader of the Golden Mountain spoke. "If the Golden Mountain takes the lead, I'm afraid it will make my people..."
<br><br>
It came to a point that anyone knew whoever took lead, would end up dead.
<br><br>
If he led his men towards the battle, there was no way they would survive.
<br><br>
Even though the members of the Golden Mountain were not afraid of death, they never would have sacrificed in this way. Besides, Pearce's order couldn't make them obey fully.
<br><br>
Gentry's words were transmitted to Auden and Athemar, who looked at each other and sighed in disappointment.
<br><br>
Once again, Pearce held the communication token and begged the Ivory Mountain to make a move. However, like the leader of the Golden Mountain, the leader of the Ivory Mountain declined as well.
<br><br>
Token after token, Pearce asked the leaders of mountains but received all the same refusal.
<br><br>
After going through each mountain leader only to be declined, Pearce crushed the communication token in his hand and shook his head. "I have to admit that my words carry no weight as I'm in a low position. I cannot represent Eastern Emperor Taiyi..."
<br><br>
He figured that if Eastern Emperor Taiyi led the battle, no mountain could disobey him.
<br><br>
There would be no reason for them to refuse to spearhead the attack.
<br><br>
Although Pearce and Auden were the elders of the Oneness Sky Palace, they were no match for Eastern Emperor Taiyi. The mountain leaders would not be driven by Pearce, who was weaker and less important than them.
<br><br>
"Elder Pearce, I'll go up with Goran!" Athemar volunteered enthusiastically.
<br><br>
Goran also cupped his hands in agreement, his eyes flashing with a fierce determination to get it done.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid you two are not enough," Pearce said. "If you go up like this, you'd die," Pearce said, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Then I'm in!" said Master Hai, who hadn't spoken a word the whole time.
<br><br>
"I've lived long enough. Count me in," Auden added, smiling.
<br><br>
"And me..."
<br><br>
"Elder Pearce, me..."
<br><br>
Seeing all the willingness of them, Pearce couldn't help but smile. "Among the seven arrays guarded by seven mountains, the Oneness Array is the most important," he announced. "If you all go up, that would leave me to preside over this array alone."
<br><br>
Everyone grew silent, and Goran gritted his teeth hearing this.
<br><br>
The Sun Crows' orderly advance really placed the Oneness Sky Palace in a dilemma that left them close to hopeless.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Athemar looked into the distance and spotted something odd.
<br><br>
"Look, what's that?"
<br><br>
Oddly enough, more than 100 Corpse Spirit Sun Crows soared gracefully in the air, but there seemed to be three Corpse Spirit Sun Crows circling below them. These three crows spewed out blue flames at their own members! Chapter 3640 Robber Zen originally made the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow under his feet fly close to the ground. But after grabbing the third one, he had risen to a higher altitude.
<br><br>
Sinclair and Jago controlled the other two.
<br><br>
While Jago had a rather low cultivation level, he was superior to Sinclair when it came to controlling the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
Upon Athemar's reminder, everyone on the Lofty Swords turned to the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Pearce's pupils contracted until a triangular mirror appeared in their depths.
<br><br>
Even if the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were over a hundred miles away, he could see every detail on them as clear as day.
<br><br>
His wrinkled face was dumbfounded at what he saw.
<br><br>
And he wasn't the only one stunned frozen.
<br><br>
Auden was struck with astonishment when he saw Zen flying atop the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow as it spat out blue flames.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Athemar, Goran, and the rest used their own methods to observe—some used their spiritual senses, while others used their eyesight, but all of them wore bewildered expressions.
<br><br>
The sight had them shocked, speechless, and confused.
<br><br>
"Those three men snatched away the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows?" Eventually, Pearce couldn't stop himself from asking.
<br><br>
"It seems so." Goran nodded.
<br><br>
"How is this possible? The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were nurtured by Emperor Charm with great effort. How could he have the qualifications to attack the North Unicorn Province if they could be taken away so easily?"
<br><br>
said one of the Oneness Governors, shaking his head.
<br><br>
Even if he had seen it with his own two eyes, he couldn't believe it.
<br><br>
If the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows could be snatched away so easily, Emperor Charm had no power to fight with the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
He must have set many restrictions on the powerful puppets.
<br><br>
Zen and Sinclair were merely Oneness Generals.
<br><br>
Even if Eastern Emperor Taiyi came in person, he could only crush the crows to dust—he wouldn't have been able to snatch them away.
<br><br>
"Who took the three crows? Was it Sinclair?" asked another Oneness Governor.
<br><br>
Among the Oneness Generals, Sinclair was considered a veteran. If he further improved his strength, he'd easily gain the qualifications to become a Oneness Governor. Because of the fact, most of them thought it was him doing the miracle.
<br><br>
"It must be Zen," Athemar said with a smile—it seemed he had put aside all his previous worries.
<br><br>
"I think so, too," Goran said, nodding in agreement.
<br><br>
Doing such a thing was not a matter of strength.
<br><br>
Even Athemar himself couldn't do it. Besides, Athemar and Goran were well aware that Zen was much stronger than Sinclair.
<br><br>
All the while, Pearce remained silent.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a glimmer of hope sparked in his heart—he was hoping Zen and the two could beak the current deadlock.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow that Zen was controlling suddenly flew up at high speed.
<br><br>
His body was nearly completely vertical.
<br><br>
Initially, he had planned to use the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow to kill more of the ordinary ones, but the Sun Crows came at him overwhelmingly—there was no way to kill them all.
<br><br>
What turned out most crucial, though, was that they were attacking the Sky Net.
<br><br>
In this war with the Sun Crow race, Zen wasn't a key figure, nor did he know much about the plans set by the Oneness Sky Palace's senior leaders.
<br><br>
All he knew was that if the Sky Net was broken, the situation would turn out much worse.
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm, you can control the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows without touching them. Am I right?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Before he could snatch the first two crows, he had to get close enough to them. When he tried to snatch the third, the demon woman from the Divine Lair was thrown right off by the crow, letting Emperor Charm control it from far away.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Emperor Charm. "But the premise is that there are no demon women from the Divine Lair on the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows."
<br><br>
Zen was overjoyed to hear the fact. "Can you control the ones above?"
<br><br>
Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were flying above, but only twenty of them had demon women riding on their backs.
<br><br>
If they managed to get all the crows, even a typically calm man like Zen wouldn't be able to hide his excitement.
<br><br>
"Of course, get closer," Emperor Charm said plainly in return.
<br><br>
In truth, Emperor Charm was rather disappointed in the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Everything they were doing went against his original goal of sowing the seeds.
<br><br>
Whoosh! From beneath Zen's feet, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow suddenly quickened and dashed upward.
<br><br>
Elizabeth sat on the back of the topmost Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. She stared blankly ahead, expecting the Oneness Sky Palace people to rush out upon their arrival. She figured they wouldn't bear to watch the Sky Net collapse.
<br><br>
The interesting part of the show was yet to come, and Elizabeth was looking forward to watching the restless, helpless expressions of the people there.
<br><br>
But at that moment, she suddenly felt something quickly approaching. She looked down to find a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
"Are they back?"
<br><br>
When the general offensive was launched, Queenie had led another two women to capture the Mountain Sea Pass. It was about time they returned.
<br><br>
But why was the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow flying at such a high speed? A strange feeling of anger rose within Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Just as she was about to scold the one on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, her beautiful eyes suddenly began trembling as she saw Zen.
<br><br>
She was already very familiar with this man.
<br><br>
In their first encounter, she had failed to kill him.
<br><br>
In their second encounter in the Chaotic Source World, she had almost lost all the demon women because of him.
<br><br>
In their third encounter on the Other Shore, her loss was even more miserable—she had to give up Stage Fourteen to Zen.
<br><br>
This time, he even managed to snatch the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Now, Zen's innocent face terrified Elizabeth. His calm demeanor was more like the calm before a storm—it was like a nightmare to Elizabeth as she felt all her power shrink to nothing. The man who was supposed to be not worth even mentioning could crush her to death effortlessly.
<br><br>
"Master Elizabeth!"
<br><br>
"Master Elizabeth, how did a human snatch the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow?"
<br><br>
"He's approaching with one!"
<br><br>
Many of the demon women riding the crows had also noticed Zen's arrival.
<br><br>
"All of you, go catch him!" Elizabeth ordered urgently, gritting her teeth.
<br><br>
If it was anyone else, she would've killed him immediately.
<br><br>
But Zen was important—he had to be caught alive.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The demon women then dashed downward.
<br><br>
In the distance, Athemar, Pearce, and the rest closely watched the front.
<br><br>
Seeing the demon women descend one after another, Athemar couldn't help but say, "It's too dangerous. What does Zen want to do?"
<br><br>
"Should we do something?" Goran asked.
<br><br>
But Pearce reached out his hand to stop him.
<br><br>
Although he was also worried, he had the instinct to take the risks. "Hold on! He must be rushing up like this for a reason!"
<br><br>

<br><br>
"Should we do something?" Goran asked.
<br><br>
But Pearce reached out his hand to stop him.
<br><br>
Although he was also worried, he had the instinct to take the risks. "Hold on! He must be rushing up like this for a reason!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3641 Rushing Into The Flames Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were scattered above Zen.
<br><br>
"Is it okay, Emperor Charm?" Zen asked just as he was about a thousand feet away from the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows at the bottom.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm nodded. "Yes."
<br><br>
Green light flashed in the emperor's slender eyes and Zen began to feel something press onto his mind.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Seven or eight Corpse Spirit Sun Crows at the bottom looked down as a trace of green light also flashed in their eyes. Zen felt the existence of these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows within his mind just as the connection was made.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened in wonder! "It's done!"
<br><br>
He continued to fly towards the higher layer where there were more than ten Corpse Spirit Sun Crows waiting. Zen noticed how they had to maintain a certain amount of distance between them owing to their incredibly huge sizes.
<br><br>
This time, before he even started to make a request to Emperor Charm, the eyes of these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows flashed green and their consciousness connected with his mind.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
At that moment, sharp, whistling sounds came from high above.
<br><br>
More than twenty Divine Lair women were quickly descending on the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows and their target was obvious: Zen.
<br><br>
It wasn't a problem for him to kill one or two Divine Lair women given his strength, but it was a rather different story if there were more than twenty of them.
<br><br>
"Descend."
<br><br>
Zen heard Emperor Charm's voice echo in his head.
<br><br>
Even without this reminder, Zen wasn't willing to continue his ascent.
<br><br>
As he descended, Zen noticed that the Sun Crows commanded by Emperor Charm remained in the air in their original positions. They even continued spitting out their blue flames.
<br><br>
The Divine Lair women who were hot at his tail were none the wiser and simply ignored these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. They did not notice any abnormality whatsoever and continued to chase solely after Zen.
<br><br>
"Catch him!"
<br><br>
"Don't let him escape back to the Sky Net!"
<br><br>
"You think we'll let you go this time?" "We'll definitely catch you!"
<br><br>
These demon women that chased after Zen were all elites in the Divine Lair. Their individual strength could easily suppress an outstanding Oneness Sky Palace warrior.
<br><br>
There was really no need to send so many people after someone like Zen and all his pursuers were confident that they'd be able to catch him even with their eyes closed.
<br><br>
Elizabeth watched the spectacle from high above as she sat on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
These Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were all controlled by her and she suddenly felt the loss of her connection with the ones below.
<br><br>
There was no way someone could've severed her connection with these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. Her power over them was absolute, unless Emperor Charm was involved.
<br><br>
To think that something like this could happen...
<br><br>
Though they continued to spit out blue flames, Elizabeth couldn't help the apprehension that rose to her chest as she looked down at the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows below.
<br><br>
"This..." she muttered through gritted teeth. It was supposed to be impossible but she couldn't deny that her control over them had been entirely severed. "Damn it! Come back! All of you!" she shouted. Her voice instantly spread to the minds of all the demon women that pursued Zen.
<br><br>
These Divine Lair women were all created by Elizabeth and they obeyed her completely. With her command, they ceased their pursuit and ordered their mounts to hover in the air.
<br><br>
They were now on the same level as the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows controlled by Zen.
<br><br>
"It's time..." Zen muttered to himself with a smile as he descended.
<br><br>
His chance had come! The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, who were continually spouting jets of blue flame, turned in unison. The blue flames were like sharp swords that came at the demon women.
<br><br>
Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...
<br><br>
These flames were harmless to the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crows but the same could not be said to the Divine Lair women. The moment the flames licked their bodies, their Chaotic Source Spirits instantly fell into fatigue and they quickly turned to ashes.
<br><br>
Those who were lucky enough to see this quickly reacted and abandoned the Sun Crows in an effort to escape.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, there were more than twenty Corpse Spirit Sun Crows in the air and their flames scorched through everything. The Divine Lair women who tried to escape never stood a chance.
<br><br>
Pearce, who was standing on top of the Lofty Sword a hundred miles away, whooped, "Well done!"
<br><br>
"Great job!"
<br><br>
"He killed all those demon women whilst snatching away more than twenty Corpse Spirit Sun Crows! It's amazing!"
<br><br>
"Amazing! It's truly amazing!"
<br><br>
Zen's feat was so astounding that Auden, Athemar, and Goran couldn't help but shower him with praises.
<br><br>
"Maybe..." Pearce began as he looked at the scene in front of him in awe.
<br><br>
"Maybe what, Pearce?" "Maybe he can force the fellows hiding in the dark to appear!"
<br><br>
This was once an unrealistic hope but now, Peace couldn't help but feel that there might now be a possibility for this to happen.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Vastness Array "Why is Elizabeth so lame?" Gethin asked.
<br><br>
Elizabeth was considered as the most powerful figure in the Divine Lair of the Sun Crow race and with so many powerful demon women with her, there was no excuse for her to have let Zen get away! Someone calculating like Gethin would naturally choose to be on the stronger side of the war.
<br><br>
The scene he had just witnessed suddenly made him doubt the Sun Crow race's strength.
<br><br>
"That Zen is too cunning," Natasha muttered beside him. "Maybe he used some sort of special method?"
<br><br>
When they had caught Zen back in the Vastness Mountain, she had been the one to interrogate him.
<br><br>
His skills definitely left a deep impression on her.
<br><br>
A group of warriors considerably stronger than him couldn't do anything to him at that time.
<br><br>
Had Zen's strength grown to the point that he could now face off against Elizabeth? "I swear I'll kill you today!" Elizabeth snarled angrily at Zen.
<br><br>
She had already forgotten her own duty.
<br><br>
In her angered state, Elizabeth manipulated all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows to spit their blue flames towards Zen.
<br><br>
Facing the barrage of so many blue flames, even the mightiest warriors would choose to dodge.
<br><br>
All eyes were on Zen at that moment.
<br><br>
"Zen, run!"
<br><br>
"You've already stolen twenty Corpse Spirit Sun Crows! That's enough..."
<br><br>
"It's too early for you to fight against Elizabeth!"
<br><br>
"It should be easy for him to dodge while controlling his mount!"
<br><br>
Even the warriors of the Azure Mountain, the Bright Mountain, and the Ivory Mountain were paying close attention to him once they realized that he could determine the trend of this entire war.
<br><br>
The Sky Net had almost reached its limit and would not be able to withstand any more power. However, when the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows stopped releasing fire, it began to repair itself.
<br><br>
As he faced the oncoming flames, Zen suddenly had a bold idea. "How would you react if I took away all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows?!"
<br><br>
He did not command his mount to carry him to safety. Instead, he made it rush headfirst into the flames.
<br><br>
In just a few moments, he, along with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, disappeared into the blue flames...
<br><br>
Everyone was stunned into silence.
<br><br>
Save for a small number of people who knew the truth about Zen, most people viewed his actions as suicide! "What is he doing?!"
<br><br>
"Is he asking for death?!"
<br><br>
"He has no reason to do so!"
<br><br>
All the leaders of the seven mountains along with all the powerful warriors in the seven arrays could only look on in confusion.
<br><br>
Chapter 3642 Run Away Pearce and Auden had set a high expectation for Zen.
<br><br>
Such an unrealistic expectation became the key to breaking the dilemma.
<br><br>
However, things suddenly turned to a direction that the two of them found hard to accept. Did Zen really rush into the raging flames and commit suicide? There was nothing Pearce could do or say, except for the shocked twitch of his face.
<br><br>
Naturally, Auden was very much taken aback as well.
<br><br>
Both of them didn't know much about Zen. They had met Zen for the first time in the Supreme Dragon Hall, and their impressions of him weren't so great. They thought that Zen was extremely arrogant and even dared to refuse the marriage that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had arranged for him.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Athemar and Goran knew Zen much better.
<br><br>
For instance, Athemar knew that Zen wasn't afraid of the unearthly fire, but even Athemar himself didn't dare to touch the flames that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows spat out. If that was the case, would Zen truly be safe? But of course, Zen was not a brainless person. Perhaps he was quite confident in his abilities, which was why he charged straight like that.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
Zen and his Corpse Spirit Sun Crow were bathed together in the blue flames, and as time passed, the distance between them and the other crows became closer.
<br><br>
At that moment, a consciousness floated in Zen's mind. "Emperor Charm! Is it okay?"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's shadow nodded in response and then his eyes flashed a ray of green light.
<br><br>
To take control of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows was a piece of cake for him.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, the connections with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows kept appearing in Zen's mind! On the contrary, Elizabeth was agitated.
<br><br>
The remaining Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were originally under her control, but now they quickly disappeared from her mind one after another! "He is still alive!" she shouted angrily in despair.
<br><br>
After a while, all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were finally under Zen's control except for the one she sat on.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
With just a thought, Zen made the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows stop spurting blue flames. His pure golden body came into everyone's sight once again.
<br><br>
Below them was Sinclair, who looked up dumbfoundedly at the scene in the sky. He couldn't believe what just happened! Of course, he didn't know about the true fight between the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace. He simply thought that the Sun Crow race's strongest weapons were the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, and Zen alone had subdued such a formidable force...
<br><br>
He had fought against the entire Sun Crow race alone.
<br><br>
That kind of thing was more of an illusion than a dream! "Nice to meet you again," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
Needless to say, Elizabeth felt resentful and miserable. Her shoulders trembled slightly. She only wanted to tear Zen apart alive.
<br><br>
"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."
<br><br>
Just then, wisps of thin flames gently lit up along her body.
<br><br>
She slightly shook her right hand, and then all the silky flames went up along her arms. The flames began to weave together like thin threads until they turned into a long, fiery spear.
<br><br>
"You are indeed an opponent that deserves my admiration," Elizabeth said as she held onto the flaming spear. "I can give you a chance to challenge me, or even kill me. What do you think?"
<br><br>
Her voice had a trace of magic, which lured Zen to agree to the duel.
<br><br>
Although Zen's cultivation level was lower than hers, he now controlled over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows! In terms of combat strength, a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was actually on par with Elizabeth. Thus, he had a great advantage this time.
<br><br>
Now, Elizabeth had no choice.
<br><br>
It was Emperor Charm who had ordered to break through the Sky Net with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace's two strongest and most troublesome fighters, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, were still under control on the Other Shore, but it seemed that even without them, the Oneness Sky Palace was still powerful after all.
<br><br>
They would attract the siege of the seven mountains if they broke through the Sky Net first. The Sun Crow race would wait for the leaders and strong warriors of the seven mountains to be exhausted and defeated if they did get out of the Sky Net, before anything else.
<br><br>
However, Zen had appeared so suddenly and took all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows! Since everything had escalated to this point, Elizabeth could only deal with Zen first.
<br><br>
"Challenge you and kill you?" Zen asked as he sat on the back of a Sun Crow. The other Sun Crows turned around and faced Elizabeth. If he ever thought about attacking her, they naturally would capture her.
<br><br>
"Yes. You've improved your strength every time I see you. Now it's time for you to fight me. What do you think?"
<br><br>
said Elizabeth in a hazy voice.
<br><br>
"I'm interested," Zen answered attentively.
<br><br>
The corners of Elizabeth's lips curled and she straightened her chest. Only by defeating Zen on her own could the plan go smoothly.
<br><br>
The moment she thought that she now had her chance, Zen exclaimed, "I changed my mind now!"
<br><br>
"Swoosh..."
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow that he sat on flew towards the Sky Net.
<br><br>
After that, the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crows suddenly opened their mouths and spat out blue flames towards Elizabeth. Then, they spread their wings and followed behind Zen.
<br><br>
When Pearce saw what happened, he was overjoyed.
<br><br>
"Hurry up! Turn off the Sky Net's restriction and let those Corpse Spirit Sun Crows in!" he ordered. Generally speaking, the huge Sky Net only allowed the people of the Oneness Sky Palace to come in and out.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows couldn't enter it, even though they were under Zen's control.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Oneness Sky Palace had intervened, and the Sky Net was quickly adjusted.
<br><br>
"You want to escape? It's not that easy!" Elizabeth hissed.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
She immediately made her Corpse Spirit Sun Crow avoid the blue flames and chase after Zen.
<br><br>
The pair of fire wings on her back flapped, and then she dashed forward together with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. Her speed was more than twice as high as Zen's! As long as she could successfully catch him, she could intercept these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
That was the only thought that ran through her mind.
<br><br>
As soon as she got closer to him, she jumped up from the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. The tip of the flaming spear in her hand spun at high speed and let out an ear-piercing sound.
<br><br>
The spear contained a terrifying number of divine megatons of power. It was so intense that under its immense pressure, the space that touched the tip of the spear formed a dark dot.
<br><br>
"This spear strike would definitely kill you!"
<br><br>
Elizabeth had channeled all her grief and remorse into her spear strike, so much that she had completely forgotten about the order to capture Zen alive.
<br><br>
Yet, she saw that Zen only looked back at her with scornful eyes.
<br><br>
It could be that she was afraid of him mocking her, so when she met his gaze, she felt an inexplicable rush of panic.
<br><br>
'Why does he look at me like that? Did I miss anything?! Whatever!' She discarded all her thoughts, and proceeded to throw the spear of flames in her hand.
<br><br>
However, at this moment, the eyes of the last Corpse Spirit Sun Crow that Zen did not take away lit up like emeralds.
<br><br>
Its torso flipped in the air. Then it fiercely flapped its wings and hit Elizabeth's body.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The wings slammed her hard, and she fell from the sky.
<br><br>
Chapter 3643 A Cognitive Space If those Corpse Spirit Sun Crows had owners present, it would be impossible for Emperor Charm to steal them.
<br><br>
Previously, when Zen stole the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, he had to drive the demon women of the Divine Lair away from them or directly burn them to death with blue flames.
<br><br>
Since Elizabeth sat firmly on the last Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's back, Zen couldn't take it away.
<br><br>
However, she suddenly left the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow in the last minute.
<br><br>
Fortunately, it wasn't that far, so Zen had a chance to steal it.
<br><br>
"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"
<br><br>
While Elizabeth fell from the sky, Zen immediately entered the Sky Net with all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
At that point, he had taken away all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows led by Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Of course, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's wings were quite strong. As a result, she didn't manage to stabilize herself in the air until she had dropped down sharply for a certain distance.
<br><br>
Once she was back to her senses, she looked closely at Zen and saw that he had already fled to the inside of the Sky Net with all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Now, Zen didn't leave right after he had entered the Sky Net. Instead, he flashed her a smile and shouted across the Sky Net, "To be honest, I'm interested in fighting with you."
<br><br>
Although he hadn't climbed up to a higher stage of the Other Shore Realm yet, there wasn't a big difference between him and powerful warriors like Elizabeth and Athemar when it came to the Soul of Light, corporeal body, and the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"Now," Elizabeth said seriously.
<br><br>
Her eyes were full of hatred, as if she wanted to eat Zen alive.
<br><br>
"Not now," Zen answered with a grin.
<br><br>
He clearly wasn't like Athemar or Pearce, who had more access to information because of their higher positions.
<br><br>
But even without thinking, he could tell that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were by no means the only weapon of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Since Elizabeth and her army alone were able to make the seven mountains remain inside the Sky Net, the leaders of the seven mountains, the Oneness Governors, and other powerful warriors must be afraid of something— though he didn't have the chance to know what that was yet.
<br><br>
Still, he inadvertently got involved as he controlled nearly a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elizabeth's pupils continuously dilated as she stared at Zen.
<br><br>
Blue wisps of fire appeared on her crimson golden wings. The originally loose flame feathers turned into blue short swords, and at the same time, her aura surged.
<br><br>
"Swoosh!"
<br><br>
Elizabeth's aura spread out.
<br><br>
Within three seconds, it had spread to hundreds of miles around it.
<br><br>
At the twelve passes on both sides of the Sky Net, including the Mountain Sea Pass, the Battle Rage Pass, the Heavenly Wind Pass, the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards, and warriors of the Other Shore Realm were all fighting against the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, each pass was only responsible for the area in front of them.
<br><br>
Chaim, the Evil God, and the others were all assigned to the twelve passes.
<br><br>
They led many Oneness Guards to a fierce battle against the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
"Swoosh…"
<br><br>
When the powerful aura swept like a windstorm, both the Sun Crows and the humans who were in a fight, froze and simultaneously looked in the same direction.
<br><br>
In the past few days, the Evil God had guarded the Heavenly Wind Pass.
<br><br>
Without Zen by his side, he was much more relaxed and he no longer felt restrained.
<br><br>
The first time he arrived at the Heavenly Wind Pass, he had enraged several Oneness Generals to the point that they almost battled each other. When the Evil God remembered that Zen was behind him, he restrained his impulse to fight.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, it wasn't long before the Oneness Generals in the Heavenly Wind Pass were finally impressed with his powerful strength. In a short period of time, he had led the warriors to repel several rounds of attacks from the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
That was why he was very surprised when he felt that strange aura and said, "Is there such a powerful existence among these poor birds?"
<br><br>
He was so intrigued that he was even itching to leave the battlefront at the Heavenly Wind Pass, just so he could find out and see what kind of being gave out such an aura.
<br><br>
Just then, a long sound of horns suddenly came from within the Heavenly Wind Pass.
<br><br>
It was a sound that signaled them to retreat.
<br><br>
The Evil God frowned at the sound. He hadn't been tired of killing yet today, so he didn't want to retreat so soon.
<br><br>
He still wanted to fight more, but to the warriors of the Other Shore Realm who were pushed out like livestock, the blare of the horns was like the sweet sound of nature that gave them a life-saving straw.
<br><br>
"Retreat! We will be safe once we are within the Sky Net!"
<br><br>
Gant floated in mid-air with three red swords by his side.
<br><br>
As a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect, he was summoned to the Heavenly Wind Pass. In addition, he had the same status as a Oneness Guard.
<br><br>
On the contrary, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace led by Monica, such as Beldene and Elgin, were in a worse situation. Despite their considerable talent, it was too short a time since they had joined the Dragon City.
<br><br>
Due to their current skill set, it was hard for them to be promoted to the Oneness Guards in less than a hundred years, let alone join the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
Judging from their strength, they would suffer a lot of damage in the battle against the Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Luckily, Gant had borrowed a powerful sword from his race before he set out. He and Monica tried their best to protect the disciples of the Sword Light Palace. Many of their people were injured, but only a few had died, which could be considered a miracle in their situation.
<br><br>
"Run!"
<br><br>
"I can finally go back!"
<br><br>
"God bless me!"
<br><br>
All the humans quickly retreated to the inside of the Sky Net.
<br><br>
It turned out that it was Pearce who had given the order.
<br><br>
The battle had reached the second phase, and the twelve passes had accomplished their mission.
<br><br>
And the Oneness Guards in the twelve passes were not qualified to take part in the following battle.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Sky Net couldn't block the aura Elizabeth released.
<br><br>
Zen stood right in front of her so of course, he received the aura's impact from all directions.
<br><br>
If his Soul of Light hadn't reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, he would have suffered serious damage.
<br><br>
"What kind of skill is this? She became much stronger!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
"It's the Dream Blood Theurgy," replied Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"She will have a desperate fight," he added. "A desperate fight? Can she tear the Sky Net apart?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"I don't think she'll be able to tear it apart," Emperor Charm glanced at the Sky Net and answered.
<br><br>
The Dream Blood Theurgy was a theurgy that only Emperor Charm himself could bestow upon someone, and it could greatly stimulate one's own potential.
<br><br>
In the 77th chaos, he had only granted it to no more than a hundred demon women.
<br><br>
Then again, the Sky Net could endure the continuous attacks of more than a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. Even if Elizabeth's strength increased by ten times, it still wasn't enough to tear such a powerful array apart.
<br><br>
Zen had planned to run away, but he changed his mind after he heard the answer from Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Although Elizabeth had activated the Dream Blood Theurgy, it was true that she wasn't in a hurry to attack him.
<br><br>
After all, she knew that it was in vain, and she only did such a thing to release her emotions.
<br><br>
She did it for the people behind her to see. "Is this your strategy, Springer? It's so ridiculous..." she said through life vitality.
<br><br>
As she spoke, her voice echoed in a space behind her.
<br><br>
That particular space was quite strange that it fell in the category of cognitive zones.
<br><br>
To be precise, the space existed, but it did not exist.
<br><br>
Because she believed that the space existed, it floated behind her.
<br><br>
As for the others like Zen, Pearce, Athemar, the Oneness Generals, and the Oneness Guards, they didn't know the existence of that space. Thus, for them, it did not exist.
<br><br>
Chapter 3644 Flipping The Sky Net Pearce, Auden and the leaders of the seven mountains all had very sharp insights.
<br><br>
Because of this, ordinary hiding skills could never deceive them.
<br><br>
However, the method the Sun Crow race used was one they had never seen coming.
<br><br>
It was for this reason that they failed to see through the Sun Crow race, even if they did everything in their power. This was also why Pearce didn't dare to act rashly.
<br><br>
Just then, a cocky voice rang through space. It was no other than Springer.
<br><br>
"Humph, are you blaming me? What a damn shame! Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were gifted to your Divine Lair, but they were all taken away while the Sky Net is still there intact. What a joke," Springer said sarcastically.
<br><br>
Even if he was rude, he was right. And as a super force, the Sun Crow race had several branches to use for their advantage.
<br><br>
Found in these branches and the Divine Lair, were the royal guards of Emperor Charm. Among these guards was Springer, who was given a status and strength that was on a par with Elizabeth's.
<br><br>
Any race would know that a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows would be a great advantage and weapon of destruction. The Sun Crow race could not tolerate such a loss. While it was Springer who came up with the plan, he'd want to put the blame on Elizabeth.
<br><br>
"Yes, Elizabeth, your Divine Lair is too lame," another voice spoke out.
<br><br>
"Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows are more than enough to annihilate an ordinary great force!"
<br><br>
Elizabeth pursed her lips. "If it were you, what would you have done? You saw how Zen stole the Sun Crows away. Who could have stopped him?"
<br><br>
Springer suddenly said, "I will kill him before he gets close."
<br><br>
However, not many agreed with this. One voice expressed this very clearly, "I don't agree with you on this, Springer. It is easy to be wise after the event. Could you foresee he was able to take away the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows just like that?" The voice was shrill, almost anxious and angry at the same time.
<br><br>
There seemed to be many powerful people gathered in the space.
<br><br>
"You're right. It's not Elizabeth's fault! The human boy is to blame," another voice cried out. "I'm still puzzled by him and how he'd managed to take away the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows."
<br><br>
As they continued to argue, it came to a common conclusion. What happened was so strange, that it could have only been possible if Emperor Charm had intervened.
<br><br>
Elizabeth's eyes narrowed slightly as she spotted Zen from a distance.
<br><br>
"There's no point arguing about this. We have already lost the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, and the Sky Net can't be broken in a short amount of time," she said hurriedly. "What are you going to do?"
<br><br>
Suddenly, Springer rose up in the space. He resembled a human being, but had a pair of black, powerful wings behind him. These wings clattered with every flap as if they were made of metal.
<br><br>
"Pearce is as smart as a fox," Springer pointed out. "Now that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows have been taken away, he would keep on defending at all costs."
<br><br>
"True. The Six-flame Array has been set up, and it would be difficult to change plans now..." another person said.
<br><br>
Similar to the Sky Net, the Six-flame Array was found to be a very powerful array.
<br><br>
The main difference between the two were their uses: the Sky Net was used for defense while the Six-flame Array was used for attacks.
<br><br>
"Then we must wait. Maybe Emperor Charm will come," Elizabeth said calmly.
<br><br>
Despite all their efforts, the Sun Crow race still had the upper hand. It was only a matter of time until they broke through the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Indeed! I think a stalemate would be the best decision for now."
<br><br>
"Just let them live a few more days!"
<br><br>
"We are not in a hurry, anyway."
<br><br>
One by one, the people in the space expressed their agreement.
<br><br>
Though the Sun Crow race would be willing to enter a stalemate, this was not what the Oneness Sky Palace thought.
<br><br>
Back then, when Pearce followed Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he was not only powerful in strength, but also resourceful.
<br><br>
It was because of this that he could see through every move of the Sun Crow race. However, due to the insufficient strength of the Oneness Sky Palace and his low prestige, he couldn't command or ask help from the powerful masters of other six mountains. Thus, he was put in a passive situation.
<br><br>
In this case, the Sky Net would collapse sooner or later, which could cause chaos.
<br><br>
However, Zen accidentally stole the Sun Crows which allowed for the situation to be reversed.
<br><br>
This brought Pearce on his toes, and his eyes flashed with a dazzling light.
<br><br>
The communication rune in his hand lit up once again as he ordered, "Flip the Sky Net!"
<br><br>
"Wait? Flip the Sky Net?" As Goran heard Pearce's order, his heart skipped a beat.
<br><br>
Even Auden, who was usually stoic, revealed a trace of surprise.
<br><br>
The Sky Net was used for defense, but flipping it around could make it become a fierce weapon of attack.
<br><br>
"Isn't this decision too hasty? After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi is not here yet... " Auden asked, hesitating to proceed.
<br><br>
However, Pearce's face was painted with determination. "This is not a rash move. There is only one chance for us," he said firmly. "Since Zen has made them suffer a great loss, we'd have to seize this opportunity or else he would have done it for absolutely nothing."
<br><br>
"Flip the Sky Net! The Golden Array and the Ivory Array, move south. The Curved Spirit Pass, the Battle Rage Pass, head north. The Bright Array..."
<br><br>
Pearce ordered.
<br><br>
Aside from the Mountain Sea Pass and the Vastness Array, the remaining arrays and passes all turned around towards different directions.
<br><br>
Originally, the Sky Net closed in on the Sun Crow race from both sides.
<br><br>
According to Pearce's orders, the two sides of the Sky Net advanced forward. In this way, the Golden Array and the Bright Array which were on the ends of the two sides would meet, forming a circle, enveloping the entire Sun Crow race right at the center of the Sky Net! Before, no warrior of the seven mountains wanted to be the first to fight.
<br><br>
However, through cooperation with each other, their plan moved so smoothly.
<br><br>
Just like that, the six arrays of the mountains and eleven passes all moved in sync with the Sky Net! When it all started happening, the Sun Crow race didn't notice. They were complacent in the fact that their strong warriors and Elizabeth were hiding not too far away in front of the Mountain Sea Pass. The only ones left at the back were the Sun Crows of lower intelligence.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elizabeth concentrated on deploying the forces as she planned to summon more Sun Crows from the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
An hour had passed and she found a large group of Sun Crows that remained in a place eight hundred miles behind her. Puzzled by what she saw, she released her spiritual sense and her face changed slightly. "The Sky Net..." she said, "is trapping us in it!"
<br><br>
As soon as Elizabeth finished speaking, the surface of the once translucent net emitted a bright red glow. Just then, the surging killing intent spread along with the glow, as if it could kill anything that approached it. The Sky Net was now one big killing machine.
<br><br>
At this time, the voice of Pearce rang out.
<br><br>
"Shrink!"
<br><br>
The Sky Net which had turned into a huge circle began to shrink inch by inch! As the Sky Net shrank, the distance between the seven mountains and the twelve passes grew closer. Eventually, it would trap the Sun Crow race, and seven mountains would also attack together. With the Sun Crow race trapped in the center, they would all have great advantages to win.
<br><br>
"What a smart move!"
<br><br>
Gethin praised from the Vastness Array.
<br><br>
"And throughout the execution, not once was the Vastness Mountain needed. I have underestimated that Pearce!" Natasha said coldly.
<br><br>
The entire Sky Net began to fold right from the Vastness Array and the Mountain Sea Pass. This also meant that there was no need for the Vastness Mountain to move. Since the Vastness Mountain already had plans of rebelling, this move fueled their suspicion that they might have been exposed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3645 The Shrinking Sky Net Gethin did plan to join the Sun Crow race's attacks on the Oneness Sky Palace eventually, but at a critical moment to deliver the fatal blow.
<br><br>
While the Sky Net remained in place, the Vastness Mountain wouldn't dare make a move.
<br><br>
They couldn't risk revealing their hand in the conspiracy too early. For now, he had to continue pretending to be on the side of the other six mountains.
<br><br>
He had to wait for the right moment to strike and make his rebellion known.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen remained on guard near the Sky Net even after seizing control of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race still hadn't made a move, even as the Sky Net continued shrinking. It was clear a storm was brewing.
<br><br>
A voice suddenly piped up in Zen's head. "General Zen, please come to the Oneness Array."
<br><br>
Zen quickly recognized the voice. It was Pearce, the master who had once scolded him in the Supreme Dragon Hall.
<br><br>
Not that it mattered to Zen now. It was but a distant memory in this time of war.
<br><br>
With his mind, he directed the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows to fly to the Oneness Array. They headed out in a neat formation.
<br><br>
They soon arrived at a magnificent array of Lofty Swords.
<br><br>
Each one was occupied by a master from the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
Zen cupped his hands in front of him and bowed to them respectfully.
<br><br>
The masters eyed the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, which all emanated such gloomy and powerful auras they subconsciously made anyone observing them keep their guard up.
<br><br>
The Oneness Array was consisted of Lofty Swords arranged in a wedgeshaped formation: One in front, then others widening to the back on both sides.
<br><br>
Libby, who occupied a Lofty Sword at one end of the array, craned her neck to finally catch a glimpse of this Zen people kept talking about.
<br><br>
The disciples on the first and second floors of the Land of Sword Grief were in different arrays of the twelve passes, while the disciples on the third floor were in the arrays of the seven mountains.
<br><br>
This was because the disciples on the first and second floors were closest to Oneness Generals in terms of strength, while the disciples on the third floor were most similar to Oneness Governors.
<br><br>
This didn't explain, however, why the powerful Libby was placed at the end of the array.
<br><br>
She was definitely not weaker than the masters of the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
She had simply been placed in a less prominent position because of her junior status.
<br><br>
After joining the array, she had been sitting quietly on the Lofty Sword, waiting for orders.
<br><br>
She was not qualified to participate in the decision-making yet. She was only subject to the more senior masters' commands during battle.
<br><br>
Libby now stared at the new arrival. When Pearce and the others had been discussing Zen earlier, Libby hadn't been paying much attention.
<br><br>
She was just now realizing she had seen Zen before. She had already encountered him in the Land of Sword Grief, but he had left such a weak impression in her mind then that she didn't even bother catching his name.
<br><br>
She never imagined that guy would be the famous Zen.
<br><br>
Her eyes narrowed at him.
<br><br>
'This is the guy who ranks first on the second floor? I would never have thought he was the same person Elder Pearce and Elder Auden were talking about!' Libby thought to herself, scoffing with incredulity.
<br><br>
Word in the Land of Sword Grief was, this Zen's talent was extraordinary.
<br><br>
Some had even said he could surpass Libby. But she refused to accept he could match up to her in only a few months. Over her dead body.
<br><br>
He was probably just another over-hyped upstart.
<br><br>
She did wonder, however, how a new disciple on the second floor managed to turn the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows over to his side.
<br><br>
She couldn't deny that accomplishment. He was accompanied by the crows, after all.
<br><br>
'Hmph! He probably just stumbled upon a special method by sheer luck, ' Libby thought to herself disdainfully, looking Zen over with a raised eyebrow.
<br><br>
She had always been the pride of the Oneness Sky Palace. She didn't even take the mountain chiefs' sons seriously. Why would some newbie disciple impress her? She was confident enough in her strength to take on masters like Athemar and Goran. Zen probably couldn't even compete on the same level.
<br><br>
As he straightened up, Zen spotted Libby in the array.
<br><br>
He was a bit surprised she was in the formation, but he figured disciples on the third floor were qualified to join the great arrays, anyway. Shrugging it off, he continued riding the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow toward Pearce.
<br><br>
Libby slit her eyes. She was sure Zen had caught sight of her, yet he didn't even acknowledge her. She glowered at being so disregarded.
<br><br>
"You summoned me, Elder Pearce?" Zen asked, as he approached.
<br><br>
Pearce eyed the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow hovering beneath Zen's feet. "Yes, it was me. But first, I must apologize, Zen, for my behavior before. Forgive my indiscretion," he said humbly.
<br><br>
To punctuate his words, he bowed deeply before Zen.
<br><br>
That Pearce, one of the founding members of the Oneness Sky Palace, would humble himself before Zen this way surely boosted Zen's status.
<br><br>
"Oh, no, please, sir, it was no issue at all! No offense taken!" Zen waved his hands frantically in embarrassment.
<br><br>
To his surprise, Auden chimed in. "You truly deserve not only our apologies, General Zen, but also our gratitude. Without you, we would have been in deep trouble by now!"
<br><br>
Zen was taken aback by Auden's words.
<br><br>
He only had the guts to steal the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows from Elizabeth simply because he was confident the Oneness Sky Palace had his back. He didn't realize, until now that Auden highlighted it, that he had made a rather crucial move they hadn't even thought of.
<br><br>
"Since these crows are under your control now, General Zen, we hope you can assist us when the Sun Crow race breaks through," Pearce implored him.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "It would be my honor. I came here on Master Goran's call-toarms. It is my duty to fight for the Oneness Sky Palace. But if I may ask, what is the situation now?"
<br><br>
Zen guessed Elizabeth had a greater force behind her, but he knew nothing about the details, nor how the Oneness Sky Palace planned to deal with it.
<br><br>
Pearce trained his eyes on the shrinking Sky Net. "If I'm guessing right, there should be a great array behind Elizabeth. After the Sky Net shrinks to a certain extent, the Sun Crow race will launch their full attack."
<br><br>
As the other six arrays and eleven passes continued to move, the circular Sky Net kept contracting toward its center.
<br><br>
Strong as Elizabeth was, she had no choice for now but to fall back in the face of the Sky Net.
<br><br>
Nothing could be seen in the space behind her.
<br><br>
With a series of caws, the Sun Crows swooped in from all corners of the sky to gather in the area behind Elizabeth. They all disappeared in groups as soon as they reached that spot.
<br><br>
The Sky Net shrunk to only 800 miles across.
<br><br>
500 miles.
<br><br>
200 miles.
<br><br>
50 miles.
<br><br>
As the span of the Sky Net continued to shrink, the distance between the twelve passes and the seven arrays also decreased.
<br><br>
The mountain chiefs all guarded their large arrays as they observed the Sky Net warily.
<br><br>
No one would let their guard down, not even if the Sun Crow race were successfully caught in the Sky Net.
<br><br>
The Sky Net shrunk further.
<br><br>
It was only 25 miles wide now! The Sun Crow race was now only one step closer to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Up in the sky, all the other Sun Crows had seemingly disappeared, save for Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Elizabeth exhaled and moved her hands. Six dots of light emerged behind her, flickered, and quickly expanded into six hexagonal seals. Together, they formed an immense array.
<br><br>
Chapter 3646 Collapse The array was engraved with six fire-shaped seals emanating ferocious energy.
<br><br>
Pearce recognized the seal on sight.
<br><br>
"This is the Six-flame Array!"
<br><br>
"It's extremely deadly! "Everyone, be careful!"
<br><br>
Terror washed over the mountain leaders as the warning reached them.
<br><br>
The array must be a sure killer if no less than Pearce was spooked.
<br><br>
Buzz! Figures started to become visible within the array.
<br><br>
There were over a hundred people within the Six-flame Array, and most of them were Emperor Charm's royal guards. Though the Divine Lair was the main force of the Sun Crow race, these guards matched Elizabeth in strength and status.
<br><br>
Elizabeth flapped her wings, positioning herself in the center of the array.
<br><br>
Springer hovered beside her, beating his black wings. He glared at the Oneness Array. "You've forced our hand, so here we are," he called out menacingly.
<br><br>
He turned to the Sun Crow race, booming out in a voice that reverberated in everyone's ears. "Destroy the Sky Net!"
<br><br>
At these words, the energy in the six fire-shaped seals burst out in six flames of different colors! The Heavenly Canopy Flame! The World Exterminating Flame! The Spiritual Karma Flame! The six kinds of flames shot out simultaneously. They had all been created by Emperor Charm with the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. Each flame was stored in the seal and nurtured for tens of millions of years.
<br><br>
When the flames emerged, they looked less like fire and more like six sharp sabers. As the Six-flame Array began to rotate, the six sabers slashed at the Sky Net! Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! The entire Sky Net Array began to shake violently.
<br><br>
The sight horrified the Oneness Generals of the twelve passes.
<br><br>
"What kind of array is that?"
<br><br>
"It's powerful enough to destroy anything!"
<br><br>
"The Sky Net Array can't withstand it at all!"
<br><br>
The Sky Net had been able to survive the fiery power of over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. But now, after only a few cuts from the Six-flame Array, it was about ready to collapse! Pearce, however, remained steadfast in his faith. "The power of the Sixflame Array is extraordinary, but the Sky Net Array is powerful, as well!"
<br><br>
Indeed, the Sky Net began to glow fiercely no sooner had Pearce uttered these words.
<br><br>
The Sky Net, which earlier appeared to be on the verge of collapse, had recovered to its original state in an instant! Its bright light turned into huge swords that slashed back at the Six-flame Array.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The shining swords sliced through the Six-flame Array. The colorful flames burst out in all directions.
<br><br>
The Six-flame Array was extremely powerful, but it was not built for defense. It also began to shake as soon as it was cut.
<br><br>
Elizabeth looked around at the unstable array, the panic mounting on her face. "It seems the Six-flame Array can't withstand the attack."
<br><br>
Springer just sneered. "Don't worry. The Six-flame Array doesn't break that easily. Let's see who will last longer."
<br><br>
Buzz! A pattern appeared beneath Springer's feet, emitting great energy. With a flash, the Six-flame Array stopped shaking and stabilized.
<br><br>
Indeed, it appeared the battle would thus be decided on which array could last longer! The powerful warriors positioned in the various arrays of the seven mountains started to become uneasy.
<br><br>
Whichever side gave in first would be put at a great disadvantage. It could even determine the victory of this war.
<br><br>
Creak! Creak! Whoosh! Whoosh! As the two great arrays continued to attack each other, the power they produced reached over 100, 000 divine megatons.
<br><br>
Ripples in space began to spread because of the immense energy fluctuations.
<br><br>
The Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards, and the Other Shore Realm warriors of the twelve passes could only gape in awe at the sight.
<br><br>
"What a horrible force!"
<br><br>
"The impact might be powerful enough to crush everything it hits instantly into powder!"
<br><br>
"We can't participate in a battle of this level!"
<br><br>
Five minutes passed.
<br><br>
Ten minutes.
<br><br>
Fifteen minutes.
<br><br>
When the battle had raged on for about an hour, a huge crack started to appear on the surface of the Sky Net.
<br><br>
CRACK! The net started to fracture like a beautiful glass mosaic.
<br><br>
Springer, Elizabeth and the others in the Six-flame Array felt a rush of triumph at the sight, but it didn't last long. Cracks also started to spread like fish scales on the surface of the six seals on the Six-flame Array.
<br><br>
CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! The Six-flame Array began to collapse.
<br><br>
"It can't stand the attacks anymore!"
<br><br>
"I hope the Sky Net Array still manages to trap them!"
<br><br>
Amid the hubbub, there were those who remained silent.
<br><br>
These were the people at the bottom ranks. They detested the war. They knew they had very little chance of surviving. Even if their side won, the rewards that would trickle down to them likely wouldn't be worth all this risk! Pearce turned serious as he kept his eyes trained on what was happening to the great arrays. "Get ready, all of you. The victory or defeat of the Oneness Sky Palace depends on the next move!"
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The arrays of the seven mountains began to light up. Everyone was now on full alert.
<br><br>
Zen, too, concentrated his mind.
<br><br>
The mouths of more than a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows began to glow with the blue light, ready to shoot flames.
<br><br>
BOOM! The Sky Net collapsed first.
<br><br>
What began as a crack was now a full-on gap. The entire array began to dissipate, starting from the ruptured area.
<br><br>
But as this happened, the six seals of the Six-flame Array also collapsed into a crystal clear powder.
<br><br>
"Go!"
<br><br>
Zen was the first to react.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows emitted light beams from their mouths, straight at the center of the collapsing Six-flame Array.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The powerful warriors positioned in the Oneness Array started rising from the ground, pulling out the huge Lofty Swords they had been occupying.
<br><br>
It came quite naturally to Pearce, Athemar and some of the other warriors.
<br><br>
Libby, however, struggled a little with her Lofty Sword, her fair face betraying a hint of fatigue. She gritted her teeth and eventually managed to keep pace with the other masters.
<br><br>
The Bright Array, the Golden Array, the Ivory Array, and all the other arrays also began to move. Everyone was ready to give their all in this battle.
<br><br>
Just then, a purple light shot into the sky. It came from the Vastness Array.
<br><br>
But instead of targeting the Six-flame Array, the purple light separated into six rays, turning into six huge purple swords. Each one hurtled straight for the other six arrays! A cold smirk played on Gethin's lips. He had chosen this critical moment to bring the rebellion out in the open.
<br><br>
Gethin knew Pearce and the others had been on guard against him for a long time. It was too bad that they were too busy to be on the lookout now.
<br><br>
It was a fatal mistake.
<br><br>
Chapter 3647 One-on-one Battle The purple long swords that came down from the sky suddenly charged straight towards the six arrays. The sudden sword attacks greatly shocked the mountain leaders.
<br><br>
"What is the Vastness Mountain doing?"
<br><br>
"Gethin is really rebelling!"
<br><br>
"True, but he was really good at hiding from us!"
<br><br>
The seven mountains had been accumulating their strength to try to fight against the Sun Crows in the Six-flame Array, but the Vastness Array just used their accumulated strength on their peers! "Don't be distracted. I'll do it!" Auden shouted.
<br><br>
Then, he flew upwards as the Lofty Sword beneath him glowed a bright golden light.
<br><br>
Splash! Just then, the Lofty Sword's blade flipped and flew straight into the sky.
<br><br>
Although Gethin was powerful and so was the Vastness Array, his attack ended up being divided into six parts. If Auden used all his strength, he might be able to take the impact.
<br><br>
The Golden Mountain and the Ivory Mountain could also resist the attack, but they would have to be distracted because of this attack.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a strong spatial fluctuation burst out from the Six-flame Array when it exploded. In turn, the people inside the array all used the Grand Teleportation technique and quickly disappeared.
<br><br>
As a result, the blue flames from the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows and the fierce skills the other mountains released had all missed their targets! The Cage of Heaven and Earth had been set since the beginning of the battle in the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
However, people like Elizabeth, Athemar, and Pearce were still able to break free from the Cage of Heaven and Earth.
<br><br>
As the battle continued to advance south, however, the range of the Cage of Heaven and Earth became smaller and smaller.
<br><br>
It was known that the smaller the area the cage covered, the stronger its power would be.
<br><br>
That was why if the entire cage shrunk to a radius of ten thousand miles, even a powerful being like Pearce wouldn't be able to use the Grand Teleportation technique there.
<br><br>
Despite all those conditions, there were still some theurgies in the Sun Crow race that could resist the Cage of Heaven and Earth! Such a case was also Springer's second conspiracy.
<br><br>
Buzz! At that point, Springer and another eight people appeared in the Ivory Array.
<br><br>
Their sudden appearance stunned all the powerful warriors in the Ivory Array.
<br><br>
After all, they had been on their guard the moment they saw all the members of the Sun Crow race disappear just now, and they did not expect that those members of the Sun Crow race would be so bold to transfer themselves into the array via the Grand Teleportation technique.
<br><br>
Springer glanced at the leader of the Ivory Mountain, who was close to him and said, "Break it!"
<br><br>
Then, he flapped his black wings and flew towards the leader of the Ivory Mountain.
<br><br>
In turn, the leader of the Ivory Mountain sneered and slashed at Springer's head with his blood-red sword, and a fierce battle between them ensued! The Sun Crow race moved to different arrays in batches, which was also Springer's idea.
<br><br>
Even though the Sky Net was torn open, the six arrays continued to guard against the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
For instance, the Oneness Mountain had deployed the Thirteen Spiritual Swords Array, which possessed the mighty strength of the thirteen Lofty Swords.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Ivory Mountain deployed the Bloody Array.
<br><br>
The Golden Mountain also had its own array.
<br><br>
Now, over a hundred people including Springer and Elizabeth could indeed use the Grand Teleportation to leave since the Sky Net was already broken.
<br><br>
However, the Sun Crow race's goal was not only to break the Sky Net, but also to completely capture this group of mountain leaders.
<br><br>
It was highly necessary to break the several arrays the mountains were guarding. Of course, the Vastness Array was not included.
<br><br>
As soon as Springer fought fiercely against the leader of the Ivory Mountain, the others began to tear the entire Ivory Array into pieces.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen saw the members of the Sun Crow race instantly disappear when he drove the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows from his position in the Oneness Array. He thought that something unfortunate was about to happen.
<br><br>
The next moment, a blue feather suddenly appeared in front of him. At the end of the feather was Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Elizabeth was an executive in the Sun Crow race, while Springer was the brains for them. When Springer had proposed a new plan, Elizabeth agreed without hesitation.
<br><br>
She hated Zen to the core so much that she couldn't allow to let him live for one more second.
<br><br>
Of course, there were also other members of the Sun Crow race who came along with her. Those other members dealt with the strong warriors like Pearce and Athemar.
<br><br>
"It's not up to you now," Elizabeth said with a ferocious smile. Her snowwhite and delicate face looked somewhat charming despite her evilness and ferocity.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The moment she was done speaking, her wings flapped furiously and she flew towards Zen.
<br><br>
When she was near him, her wings grasped Zen just like a big pair of hands.
<br><br>
Then, she simultaneously pierced him with her flaming spear! No matter what tricks Zen used, he had no chance of winning against someone stronger than him.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he couldn't teleport like last time because he was under the shackles of the Cage of Heaven and Earth.
<br><br>
The sight of Zen, who had toiled her plans repeatedly, but was now about to die greatly pleased Elizabeth. She sighed contentedly as if she had finally killed a powerful opponent.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he simply patted her wings and leaned forward. When he saw that the spear was about to touch his body, he took a deep breath and rolled over in an attempt to avoid the spear's tip.
<br><br>
However, Elizabeth was quicker to react than he was. Even if he endlessly rolled left and right, her delicate but deadly spear always followed him like a shadow, as if his defenses didn't affect it at all.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The flaming spear let out a whistling sound, then it was directly pointed at his chest.
<br><br>
Phew! In a split second, he had become a flaming man.
<br><br>
Because he had never been harmed due to fire many times, Elizabeth didn't expect that he would burn to ashes.
<br><br>
But her spear strike contained fifteen thousand divine megatons of force this time! She had personally witnessed him enter the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it had been only a few months since he had left the Chaotic Source World. She was sure that he was still at the early stage of the Chaotic Source Realm! Not to mention that fifteen thousand divine megatons of force, even half of it might be enough to exhaust his Chaotic Source Spirits and disintegrate his body into pieces.
<br><br>
But this was Zen, and with him, something unexpected happened a lot.
<br><br>
Cling! Finally, Elizabeth's spear stabbed into Zen's body, but it only made a crisp sound.
<br><br>
It turned out that the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body withstood the spear.
<br><br>
Then they began to weaken, but his mysterious Truth of Godly Way rapidly fluctuated and pooled within each Chaotic Source Spirit, thus quickly restoring their strength! "How?" Elizabeth exclaimed in disbelief.
<br><br>
She couldn't believe what she saw, and Zen even had the guts to smile at her.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Nevertheless, she released all the power within her body. Her flaming spear released a terrible force of twenty-five thousand divine megatons, which was close to her limit.
<br><br>
She didn't know how Zen had blocked her first spear, nor did she want to figure it out. She paid it no mind and proceeded to release more force! Whoosh! The immensely strong force pushed the flaming spear even more, then it let out a sharp whistling sound and went straight towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Even in the face of such a powerful spear strike, Zen just faintly smiled.
<br><br>
Could he still withstand this spear's attack? Just as Elizabeth thought about it, she felt a burning aura around her. The aura did not come from her flaming spear, but from the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows that were flying everywhere.
<br><br>
Chapter 3648 Summoning Worlds The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows now followed Zen's every command.
<br><br>
When Zen was fighting with Elizabeth, all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows scattered around had closed in on them.
<br><br>
Before the beasts had the chance to burn them with their blue flames, Elizabeth quickly moved towards Zen and thrust her spear into him.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, her attack failed to kill him and the blue flames burst from the beasts' beaks and swept over them.
<br><br>
It would be impossible for her to survive the attack even with her exceptional ability to control fire.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, could easily withstand the flames.
<br><br>
As she flapped her wings, Elizabeth's extremely slim body began to float back in the air. It was as if she was as weightless as a piece of paper. She passed safely through one of the gaps in the blue flames while Zen accepted the baptism of fire with ease.
<br><br>
Elizabeth originally planned to find another way of taking him down once she was at a safe distance away from the roaring blaze.
<br><br>
However, it was obvious that Zen had no intention of letting her escape so easily! Just as she passed through the hot inferno, three Corpse Spirit Sun Crows had already surrounded her. Their wings were similar to sharp blades.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Their wings sang as they sliced through the air.
<br><br>
A casual strike from one of these crows contained twenty thousand divine megatons of force. It would be difficult for Elizabeth to defend herself from such powerful strikes. Her body still floated in the air and her wings flapped constantly to dodge the attacks.
<br><br>
Just as she managed to escape the three Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, a dozen more Corpse Spirit Sun Crows rushed towards her! Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! Aside from those Corpse Spirit Sun Crows that attacked her in close combat, more Corpse Spirit Sun Crows also began to spew blue flames in her direction.
<br><br>
Just as Elizabeth spun over the back of one of these crows, several more of the vicious beasts began to claw at her head.
<br><br>
Now, over a hundred of them took their turns to try and attack Elizabeth! "Get away!"
<br><br>
From her delicate and tender outstretched hands burst an unexpected and unimaginable power. She grabbed two of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows and began to swing them around.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The two Corpse Spirit Sun Crows she spun around encircled her like a windmill, sweeping all of the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crows away.
<br><br>
During this attack, another figure silently approached.
<br><br>
It was none other than Zen! Quickly, he morphed into a sharp arrow and struck down from high above with his sword and aimed at Elizabeth's back.
<br><br>
Crack! Zen's strike failed to hurt Elizabeth due to the Chaotic Source Spirits protecting her. To her surprise, his casual strike turned out to contain ten thousand divine megatons of force! A few more strikes from him and her Chaotic Source Spirits would surely be exhausted.
<br><br>
'Is he strong enough to kill me?' The terrifying thought emerged in her mind.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Elizabeth flapped her wings, trying to make Zen stay. But as soon as he struck his first blow, he ran as quick as a cheetah and disappeared behind the flock of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately for her, the monstrous birds surrounded her again.
<br><br>
Ever since he had gained control of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, Zen began to wonder how to best use them to his advantage.
<br><br>
They were impervious to water, fire, swords, and spears. However, one disadvantage was that they were rather slow due to their huge size. They could only rely on their numbers to defeat someone as powerful as Elizabeth.
<br><br>
It would be challenging to trap a warrior as strong as her.
<br><br>
But without warning, Elizabeth jumped straight into Zen's trap using Grand Teleportation. She was right where he wanted her to be.
<br><br>
Zen was worried she'd use the same power to escape again. Judging by the current situation, she wouldn't be able to use that power when she was alone.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Elizabeth managed to smash one more crow, but even more of them arrived and enveloped her.
<br><br>
They just kept piling on, layer by layer.
<br><br>
Once she managed to pass through two of them, Zen appeared again, undetected like a ghost.
<br><br>
Swish! Another strike from Zen's sword slashed her back. Luckily, the Chaotic Source Spirits prevented her wings from being cut off.
<br><br>
As Elizabeth turned to try and catch Zen, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows that were hard to defeat wasted no time in attacking her.
<br><br>
When Zen and Elizabeth were locked in combat, others from the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace were locked in their own battles too.
<br><br>
Springer's plan worked wonderfully. The powerful masters of the seven mountains didn't expect that the Sun Crow race would charge into their arrays.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the Bright Array, the Golden Array, and the Ivory Array were destroyed by the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
But the powerful masters of the seven mountains weren't weak.
<br><br>
Even without the help of the arrays, they were still strong enough to defend themselves and attack.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A blood-red light burst as the leader of the Bright Mountain shook his long sword.
<br><br>
Soon, the world around them was tinged in red as vibrant as blood. Even in the middle of the battle, the leader had managed to directly summon an entire world! The Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization which Zen had obtained and the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization which the Evil God had obtained were limited to Stage Thirteen and Stage Eleven. Although the power of the Civilization Artifacts was terrifying, due to the pressure from the Other Shore, neither Zen nor Evil God had reached their full potential and power yet.
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact the leader of the Bright Mountain held came from Stage Thirty. The power the Other Shore Tokens from the Desire World burst out was unlike any of the Lust World's Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
"Bloody Descent!"
<br><br>
The blood-red light spread out and covered a radius of a million miles! The entire area now appeared to be bathed in blood.
<br><br>
All everyone could see was tinged with a vibrant crimson.
<br><br>
"The leader of the Bright Mountain summoned the blood-red world!"
<br><br>
"He's bent the rules in this area!"
<br><br>
"It is said that the blood-red world can suppress all others' bloodline powers to increase his own bloodline power!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
With a long sword in his hand, the leader of the Bright Mountain turned into a ray of blood radiance and pierced through a member of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
"You think you're the only one who can summon a world?"
<br><br>
In the distance, Springer let out a sinister laugh. He spread out his black wings and black feathers began to float in the air.
<br><br>
These feathers spread out quickly, like drops of black ink on white paper.
<br><br>
Soon, another world was summoned and it covered the blood-red world! Now, black masses floated everywhere. They were like ferocious ghosts that pounced in various directions.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A Oneness Guard hardly had time to dodge when a black mass invaded his body and turned his flesh black almost instantly.
<br><br>
He looked at his hands and feet. His face was full of fear.
<br><br>
But this fear was short-lived.
<br><br>
Black spikes began to jut out of his back one by one. His eyes sank into the sockets and his body began to broaden. He turned and twisted until he became an unrecognizable monster.
<br><br>
"Come out, Fickle Demons! Ha-ha!" Springer laughed and commanded.
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact he carried was used to summon demons. Once it was used, everything in the world would become sacrificial offerings.
<br><br>
The more sacrifices, the more powerful the Fickle Demons would become! If there were enough sacrificial offerings, they could even produce Fickle Demons that could surpass powerful masters like Emperor Charm and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Chapter 3649 Planning On Escaping As the battle raged, many Oneness Guards and Oneness Generals in the twelve passes could only watch in awe.
<br><br>
They wouldn't dare get caught in a battle of this level.
<br><br>
But they were snapped out of their stupor when the ink blobs appeared.
<br><br>
Their blood ran cold at the sight.
<br><br>
"Activate the array!"
<br><br>
"Everyone, withdraw and head to the pass!"
<br><br>
"We can't fight that thing!"
<br><br>
Countless Oneness Guards and warriors of the Other Shore Realm stampeded into the passes.
<br><br>
Every time a world descended, the rules were changed.
<br><br>
Fortunately, no other world had been unleashed but those by the leader of the Bright Mountain and by Springer.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Dozens of ink blobs appeared above the Heavenly Wind Pass, floating in the air. As one, they rushed downward, wrapping themselves around the five-star Oneness Guards before they could enter the protective array.
<br><br>
As soon as the ink touched them, the Oneness Guards' skin turned black and started to crack like charcoal. They became another manner of creature altogether. Now hollow-eyed monsters, they turned around and wildly pounced on their former colleagues.
<br><br>
"Woo...woo..."
<br><br>
one of the black monsters howled as it scrambled toward the Evil God.
<br><br>
When the black monster was about two dozen feet away, light flashed in the Evil God's hand. He tossed a diamond-shaped token formed by the Waysblending Energy.
<br><br>
Bang! The diamond-shaped token exploded on the black monster's head, smashing it into pieces.
<br><br>
The Evil God snorted, "You asked for it."
<br><br>
Nothing could have survived that blast.
<br><br>
However, the black monster somehow began to get up again, its head having reformed.
<br><br>
"A monster created in this world becomes immortal in this world, huh?" the Evil God murmured to himself, thinking aloud.
<br><br>
The blast drew the attention of more black monsters. They all began heading toward the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God glanced at the Heavenly Wind Pass not far away. He deliberated if he had enough time to make it there.
<br><br>
Deciding he did, he was taken aback when he turned in that direction.
<br><br>
It had taken him only a second to decide, but the path was now cut off by a large number of black monsters, swarming toward him. The Evil God had no choice but to run. But an idea was starting to form in his mind.
<br><br>
The Oneness Generals who were able to make it to the Heavenly Wind Pass observed the situation from afar.
<br><br>
"It seems the Oneness General called the Evil God can't make it, after all."
<br><br>
"Should we help him?"
<br><br>
"No. Leave him alone."
<br><br>
The Evil God had displayed his powerful strength at the Heavenly Wind Pass, but he was still generally disliked. The Oneness Generals had fought on the battlefields for many years but somehow feared the Evil God, so they were hesitant to come to his rescue.
<br><br>
But the Evil God, at this moment, had other things in mind. As an Innerworld Generating Avatar, the Evil God couldn't even think of opposing Zen.
<br><br>
But he could distance himself from Zen using these black monsters and the chaos of battle as an excuse.
<br><br>
Thus far, Zen had showed he could freely control the Evil God. If he so wanted, he could freeze the Evil God on the spot, making him unable to move. However, the Evil God was convinced there must be a limit to that control. There must be some range beyond which the controller would no longer be able to reach the Inner-world Generating Avatar.
<br><br>
The Evil God now saw a chance to test that theory.
<br><br>
"Wha...wha..."
<br><br>
The black monsters chased after the Evil God as fast as they could. The Evil God was as light as a swallow as he sped onward, flying close to the ground.
<br><br>
After reaching certain distances, he would draw some divine megatons of force from the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization in Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
He could only do this as an Inner-world Generating Avatar under Zen's control.
<br><br>
The Evil God theorized that once he was no longer able to extract the force, then it must follow that he was out of Zen's control.
<br><br>
At this moment, Zen was crouching down on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, taking a break. Controlling so many Corpse Spirit Sun Crows was not an easy task.
<br><br>
After fighting with Elizabeth for a while, Zen decided to return control of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows to Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
The creatures seemed more agile in his hands, anyway.
<br><br>
Pop! Elizabeth suddenly lobbed a ball of blazing flame at Zen.
<br><br>
The flame was so strong that even Athemar might not have been able to survive it. But surrounded by Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, the flame didn't reach Zen at all.
<br><br>
In Elizabeth's anger, it seemed she forgot Zen was unaffected by the flames.
<br><br>
At this moment, something caught Zen's attention in his mind.
<br><br>
It was the Evil God, running eastward at full speed.
<br><br>
In a flash, he entered the Evil God's mind.
<br><br>
Through the Evil God's eyes, he saw the dozens of twisted black monsters chasing after him.
<br><br>
Zen figured these black monsters probably appeared from a summoned world.
<br><br>
Zen read the Evil God's memories. He discovered that the Evil God had been drawing some divine megatons of force from his inner world as he was being chased. This struck Zen as somewhat strange.
<br><br>
"Stop running. Kill those black monsters and come back to me."
<br><br>
Zen's orders took over the Evil God's mind.
<br><br>
The Evil God stiffened on the spot. He gritted his teeth.
<br><br>
This had been his only chance to escape! But he wasn't able to disobey Zen at all.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The Evil God stretched out his hand and flung diamond-shaped tokens at the monsters.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Each token exploded on a black monster's head.
<br><br>
However, these creatures were indeed immortal. After exploding into pieces, they simply reconstructed and came back to life.
<br><br>
To make matters worse, every time they recovered, the black monsters only seemed to grow in size and strength.
<br><br>
The Evil God squinted at them.
<br><br>
He had another idea brewing.
<br><br>
He flipped his body in the air, flinging diamond-shaped tokens again and again at the black monsters.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! The black monsters exploded again and again, continuing to reform and reanimate. With each recovery, they became more and more powerful.
<br><br>
Springer, who was watching events unfold from the core zone, began to get puzzled.
<br><br>
These monsters came from the world he unleashed, which was called the Fickle World, so they were called Fickle Demons. He knew they were immortal, and that they grew stronger with every reanimation.
<br><br>
It could go on endlessly.
<br><br>
Most opponents would stop attacking the Fickle Demons as soon as they discovered this.
<br><br>
But now, here was someone who still kept attacking despite clearly seeing this only made the Fickle Demons more powerful.
<br><br>
Unbeknownst to Springer, the Evil God was doing this intentionally.
<br><br>
Outwardly, he was only following Zen's order to kill the monsters, after all.
<br><br>
But once the situation reached a tipping point, he would make his escape.
<br><br>
Chapter 3650 The Real Emperor Charm Whiz! All of a sudden, a sword radiance was aimed right at Elizabeth's back.
<br><br>
However, just as the sword slashed down, Elizabeth already prepared for the attack. She spun around and broke Zen's long sword into two clean pieces. After that, she swung her spear right at Zen's head.
<br><br>
Looking at Elizabeth who grew more and more angry by the second, Zen was surprisingly calm.
<br><br>
As if by chance, his head tilted enough and avoided the spear completely.
<br><br>
Right after he recovered, he sat steadily on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.
<br><br>
Though Elizabeth wanted to chase after him, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows piled up and blocked her way.
<br><br>
These crows resembled a moving forest, so dense and hard to navigate through. This made Zen a hunter lurking, and Elizabeth, the beast.
<br><br>
Zen would stab Elizabeth with his sword whenever he had the chance.
<br><br>
A stab would not hurt Elizabeth, but it could consume a small amount of Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Hopefully a number of strikes could kill her, too.
<br><br>
Elizabeth never would have guessed that she'd be on the losing end. It seemed that these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were so agile that no matter which direction she fled to, they would follow right after her and block her way.
<br><br>
She was always too proud to ask for help from the other members of her race, but this time was different.
<br><br>
After being slashed several times, she felt a sense of urgency and desperation.
<br><br>
If she didn't escape, she would be as good as dead.
<br><br>
On top of that, the fact that Zen was a junior frustrated her.
<br><br>
Eventually, Elizabeth decided to summon for help. However, no one came to her rescue or even responded to her. It seemed that the other members of the Sun Crow race were all preoccupied, and no one could salvage her.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
Just as she dodged the attack from a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's wings, Elizabeth gritted her teeth and spread her wings wide. They flashed and glowed with a magic luster, prepared for her next move.
<br><br>
"Hundred Phoenixes Dance!"
<br><br>
Just like that, Elizabeth's body emitted a blue light as her bloodline power was awakened. This made her incomparably agile now.
<br><br>
She then flapped her wings so powerfully, that she turned into a hundred fierce phantoms.
<br><br>
As long as a small gap was maintained before her, the phantoms could go out.
<br><br>
Even from a distance, one could see many phantoms of Elizabeth, some big and some small! All she wanted to do was get rid of Zen. She had no choice but activate her bloodline power and use her bodily movement skill to save her life.
<br><br>
It was notable, because this form of bodily movement skill was so complex and strange that even warriors with higher levels of cultivation, like the leaders of the mountains, were unable to locate her in a short period of time.
<br><br>
Among others, Zen was the most surprised to see the Elizabeths of different sizes. At one point, he was dazzled by what he saw.
<br><br>
If it was Zen who controlled the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, he wouldn't be able to stop her.
<br><br>
However, the real opponent Elizabeth had to face was not Zen anymore - it was Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm had a smile across his face.
<br><br>
The Hundred Phoenixes Dance proved to be a unique bodily movement skill of the Sun Crow race, and in fact, it was a theurgy he'd created.
<br><br>
So even though Elizabeth was extremely agile and created phantoms to set people off, Emperor Charm could see right through her.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows from the outermost layer circled around once, only to be followed by the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows from the middle layer, and finished off with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows of the innermost layer.
<br><br>
As the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows moved in this motion, Elizabeth's avatars were destroyed one by one. This sent her speeding towards a narrow passageway, just in her hope to break through.
<br><br>
From the passage, she could already see the blue sky outside.
<br><br>
Just as Elizabeth thought she could escape, two Corpse Spirit Sun Crows came at her at the same time.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
But before she could even pass through the passage, four huge claws of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows cornered from both sides and she could no longer move.
<br><br>
With a look of pure shock, her eyes widened as she watched Zen emerge from under a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. She turned pale and cold, as if she had just seen a ghost.
<br><br>
Zen approached her slowly, looking calm and stern at the same time.
<br><br>
Because Elizabeth had broken Zen's sword, he held the Soaring Snake Sword tightly in his hand right now.
<br><br>
At this point, Elizabeth already lost more than half of her Chaotic Source Spirits. She probably wouldn't stand a chance against a slash from the Soaring Snake Sword.
<br><br>
It was right then and there that she realized she had already been defeated.
<br><br>
She remembered that two years ago, she could have destroyed him with just a flick of her finger.
<br><br>
"Why can you break my bodily movement skill?" Elizabeth asked.
<br><br>
She sounded calm, as if she'd accepted the death that awaited her.
<br><br>
However, she still felt it unbelievable that Zen had seen through the Hundred Phoenixes Dance at first sight.
<br><br>
Zen didn't strike her with the sword. "I didn't see through your bodily movement technique," he answered.
<br><br>
"Then how..." Elizabeth trailed off, more confused than ever.
<br><br>
"It was someone else who saw through your bodily movement skill," said Zen.
<br><br>
"Who is it?"
<br><br>
Elizabeth knew that only Emperor Charm could see through it at a glance, but it was impossible that he would be here, much less that he would help Zen.
<br><br>
However, Zen didn't acknowledge her question. Just then, a shadow appeared above his head; it was none other than Emperor Charm himself.
<br><br>
With a gasp and wide eyes, Elizabeth couldn't believe what was before her.
<br><br>
Numerous guesses of what might have happened crossed her mind. "You are..."
<br><br>
She even thought for a second that before her was only a soul fragment of Emperor Charm, but the aura didn't match completely. However, her instinct told her that this was most definitely Emperor Charm himself.
<br><br>
"I am Emperor Charm," answered Emperor Charm, completing her sentence.
<br><br>
As Elizabeth absorbed what she saw, she couldn't help but fall to her knees.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm exuded an aura of unmatched authority. It was so powerful that his presence alone was enough to make any one of the Sun Crow race surrender.
<br><br>
"But you are not..."
<br><br>
She still had doubts, no matter how real he was right in front of her.
<br><br>
"I'm not the Emperor Charm you know," he said. "I'm the real Emperor Charm, the first Sun Crow ever. The Emperor Charm you know of is a seed I sowed in the Source World. He's my avatar."
<br><br>
Of course, the Emperor Charm in the Source World knew about his origin, but he had never exposed anything about the 77th civilization to the public.
<br><br>
Elizabeth's eyes widened once again.
<br><br>
Over the years, the Sun Crow race was a super force that was highly submissive to Emperor Charm. But according to this man, the Emperor Charm in the Source World was only his avatar? "I... I don't believe it!" she gasped again, looking befuddled.
<br><br>
She was the type of person to be firm in her belief, and that was what kept her always energetic and full of fight. Her belief was Emperor Charm who she obeyed unconditionally. But because of this man, her belief had been gone. To Elizabeth, this was worse than dying.
<br><br>
"Zen," said Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, as he was watching the event unfold, Zen held the sword and struck it outwards into the air. The sharp Soaring Snake Sword burst out with a strong force that was aimed towards her shoulder.
<br><br>
However, the toughness of Elizabeth's body surprised Zen.
<br><br>
Seeing that she was not affected with the strike, he struck her three times in a row.
<br><br>
Eventually, Elizabeth's Chaotic Source Spirits grew tired, and the sword finally pierced through her shoulder.
<br><br>
As blood gushed out of her, Emperor Charm's eyes flickered with a golden light, and just like that, Elizabeth's blood floated into the air, forming a thin red line.
<br><br>
"My avatar gave you the Dream Blood Theurgy, which can stimulate your potential. However, he indirectly controls you this way," Emperor Charm explained patiently. "I created the Dream Blood Theurgy when I was young.
<br><br>
It had a flaw before, but I solved that later."
<br><br>
Emperor Charm had lived through over 1000 chaotic eras on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Because of this, he had enough time to think and rethink cultivation methods, theurgies, and ideas that he had created before. This had allowed him to perfect each and every one of his creations.
<br><br>
Chapter 3651 Bloodline Worship The thin line formed by the blood rotated under the control of Emperor Charm. It acted like a red silky ribbon tied on a stick, and Emperor Charm took control of that invisible stick. At the same time, dots of light were extracted.
<br><br>
The light dots moved together and formed into a strange pattern in the air.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the light dots bewilderedly. He followed their movements with his head and tried to understand it. He asked curiously, "What are these light dots?"
<br><br>
"The bloodline power," replied Emperor Charm as his hands moved in the air, guiding the movement of the dots.
<br><br>
Zen and Elizabeth were taken aback upon hearing Emperor Charm's response. Both of them took a gasp and looked at each other with wide eyes.
<br><br>
The bloodline power had been hidden in the blood, but both Zen and Elizabeth had never seen anyone ever extract it.
<br><br>
It was the first time that they had seen the physical bloodline power. As this was something peculiar, Zen and Elizabeth watched avidly.
<br><br>
After extracting the bloodline power, Emperor Charm began to adjust the light spots. He pushed some further and drew some others closer.
<br><br>
Zen felt as if the light dots were a little familiar. They were very similar to those in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
However, the distance between the light dots in the Abstruse Energy World was significantly large, and there were many of them. That was not like the few in front of him now.
<br><br>
It took only a short while for Emperor Charm to properly adjust the light dots.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The light dots that maintained their positions merged into Elizabeth's blood again.
<br><br>
"Hiss..."
<br><br>
The blood turned into a thin line which moved in a steady pace and went into Elizabeth's wound.
<br><br>
Her face revealed a painful expression during the process. Her hands were balled into a fist; she clenched her teeth and her eyes were shut closed.
<br><br>
The bloodline power that had been adjusted by Emperor Charm was different from the original one. Thus, it was rejected by the bloodline power in Elizabeth's body. Because the two kinds of bloodline repelled each other, there was an unbearable pain for Elizabeth to bear.
<br><br>
With astonishing willpower, Elizabeth endured the pain silently.
<br><br>
The bloodline power refined by Emperor Charm was more powerful. It continuously assimilated the remaining blood in Elizabeth's body. In just a short span of time, the blood in her body had been completely transformed.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows that had caught her also loosened their huge claws.
<br><br>
Zen took a step back as his body's reflex. His expression revealed a look of vigilance and his breaths grew faster and shallower.
<br><br>
After all, this woman had tried to kill him again and again. It was understandable that he had to guard against her.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. She can't kill you," said Emperor Charm, trying to sound reassuring.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen asked, confused.
<br><br>
"After the transformation, she will only acknowledge allegiance to me,"
<br><br>
replied Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Zen shot a look at Elizabeth upon hearing his response and witnessed how Elizabeth's expression became very complicated.
<br><br>
In her heart, she clearly hated Zen. She wanted to kill him badly, but it was as if her body did not agree. No matter how hard she tried, her body refused to move.
<br><br>
It was not because she was spiritually enslaved. Rather, it was her blood that was enslaved by Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
In fact, unbeknownst to some, this kind of enslavement had been existing since the birth of the Sun Crow race. The ordinary Sun Crows and the many demon women in the Divine Lair unconditionally trusted and submitted to Emperor Charm. This kind of submission was engraved in their blood.
<br><br>
Therefore, there were only very few betrayers in the Sun Crow race. If there were any betrayers, like Elvinia and Flamine, their blood was not pure.
<br><br>
Also, they would be detested and hated by their race. This loyalty was part of the bloodline worship.
<br><br>
It was also in this way that the Ear Mice could control other kinds of mice.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm turned to face Elizabeth and spoke in a firm tone, "Zen is the spokesperson of the 77th civilization. From now on, he is your master."
<br><br>
Hearing this, Elizabeth was not convinced. Her body experienced a dissonance. The pair of wings on her back were trembling slightly, but her instinct forced her to lower her head. She gritted her teeth and said, "Yes, Master." She was not in control of her own body, but the annoyance was very much noticeable in her tone.
<br><br>
Not long ago, she had been doing what she could to try to kill Zen, but now she was respectful to him. After seeing Elizabeth obey the command she was given, although reluctantly, Zen was surprised. An idea suddenly came to his mind. "Her blood has been transformed. If we inject her blood into other members of the Sun Crow race..."
<br><br>
"You are smart," said Emperor Charm with a faint smile.
<br><br>
This kind of bloodline worship was engraved by instinct, and of course, it was only effective for the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Under the order of Emperor Charm, Elizabeth reluctantly drew out her blood.
<br><br>
The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows that had been wrapping Elizabeth quickly separated. Elizabeth was positioned in the inner layer and was riding a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. After she locked a target, she rushed over to attack.
<br><br>
In midair not far away, Libby was stepping on the Lofty Sword with a serious and determined look on her face.
<br><br>
In front of her stood a burly member of the Sun Crow race. He was standing confidently, making him look much bigger than he really was, as if he weren't built big enough.
<br><br>
His name was Dugan, and he was one of the best royal guards of Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
For Libby, Dugan was the strongest opponent she had ever faced.
<br><br>
In the battle with him, she would definitely die if she were not careful enough. Her pretty oval face was full of caution and seriousness. She squinted her eyes and clenched her fists.
<br><br>
"You seem to be very young," Dugan said confidently as he spread his wings. He raised his right hand, and fire snakes slowly moved around his arm. "It's rare to see such a young talent. Ha-ha..."
<br><br>
Before Dugan could finish his words, Libby tapped the Lofty Sword with her tiptoe. The sword then suddenly turned over, slashing towards Dugan in an immense speed with supreme power.
<br><br>
At the same time, Libby ran hurriedly along the blade of the sword.
<br><br>
She had two short swords in her hands, both of which were extraordinary and sharp.
<br><br>
Whoosh! There was a tingling in the air as she moved her hands holding the swords.
<br><br>
As the two short swords flickered, her speed suddenly increased and she disappeared in an instant.
<br><br>
The next moment, she appeared on the right side of Dugan. Dugan had surely underestimated Libby's agility.
<br><br>
The Lofty Sword slashed from the left, and Libby attacked from the right.
<br><br>
Dugan had no way to escape.
<br><br>
"Nice try..." Dugan looked at Libby with a wide smile. "Unfortunately, your strength is too weak."
<br><br>
He stretched out his wings and moved to dodge the Lofty Sword on the left, pouncing towards Libby.
<br><br>
There was a flash of surprise in Libby's bright wide eyes, and she waved her hands in an instant.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! In just a few seconds, Libby had slashed over a hundred times.
<br><br>
Because the power of these strikes was not that strong, they were still unable to exhaust Dugan's Chaotic Source Spirits, so he was not hurt at all.
<br><br>
"I've told you that you don't have enough strength," Dugan said with a mischievous smile on his face.
<br><br>
Libby frowned and leaned back. Like a swallow flying backwards, she tried to escape back to the Lofty Sword.
<br><br>
But Dugan had already stopped Libby before she was even able to move.
<br><br>
He spread his wide wings, and countless fire snakes flew out from them.
<br><br>
They quickly formed a huge fire net, completely enveloping Libby.
<br><br>
"It's a pity that a talent like you would be killed like this." Dugan licked his lips with excitement on his face. With a gentle pull of his hand, the fire net began to shrink rapidly. His eyes were gleaming and the flames were reflecting on them. He couldn't seem to wipe the smirk off his face.
<br><br>
Unlike Zen, Libby couldn't bear the burning of the flames.
<br><br>
If the fire net continued to shrink and burn, it would not be difficult to imagine what would happen to her.
<br><br>
Libby's face turned pale. Just then, a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow flew down and pierced through the fire net to her side.
<br><br>
She was terribly desperate at the moment. When she saw Zen rush in, she was utterly stunned. When she came to her senses, she asked, "Why are you here?"
<br><br>
Zen didn't answer her, but instead pointed to the sky. Elizabeth, riding another Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, landed beside Dugan.
<br><br>
Chapter 3652 The Second One Elizabeth landed, followed by more than a dozen Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Dugan saw them and scoffed disdainfully, "It took you so long to get just these few Corpse Spirit Sun Crows back?" He raised a brow in Zen's direction. "You even kept that bastard alive."
<br><br>
As far as Dugan was concerned, it was because of Elizabeth's carelessness that the Sun Crow race lost the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. The least she could do was to get them back.
<br><br>
Dugan sneered. He had thought with her long departure, she would have managed to retake more of the beasts. But she even failed to kill Zen.
<br><br>
"I tried my best," Elizabeth said weakly, avoiding meeting Dugan's eyes.
<br><br>
Dugan rolled his eyes and shifted them onto Zen and Libby. He smirked at Zen. "I don't know why you threw yourself into the net, but feel free to go to hell together with that beautiful girl!"
<br><br>
The fire net that had been broken by Zen was restored to its original state. It began to shrink at an alarming speed.
<br><br>
Libby was still confused, but Zen hadn't answered her question.
<br><br>
She gritted her teeth. "I have no other choice..."
<br><br>
Buzz! Three ice crystals emerged over Libby's head. They were Snow Ice Crystals from Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
As soon as the Snow Ice Crystals appeared, the temperature around Libby dropped sharply.
<br><br>
A big ice cocoon enveloped her and Zen.
<br><br>
The ice cocoon had amazing defensive effect. It could not be broken by even 20, 000 divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
However, the Snow Ice Crystal could only serve as passive defense, and could not be used as a main Other Shore Token. Back then, Libby had merged with this Other Shore Token because she thought it might come in handy some time.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! The surface of the ice cocoon pushed into the fire net. The blazing flames started to melt the firm ice, slowly but surely.
<br><br>
"At this rate, the ice cocoon can only hold for half a minute at the most.
<br><br>
Once it's all melted, we're still dead," Libby said with a trembling voice, desperate and helpless.
<br><br>
She turned to look at Zen and was surprised to see that he looked quite calm, without the slightest trace of panic.
<br><br>
She wondered angrily how he could be so unperturbed at a time like this.
<br><br>
Zen looked Dugan straight in the eye and motioned toward Dugan's side.
<br><br>
"Watch your left."
<br><br>
Zen smiled.
<br><br>
Puzzled, Libby looked to the left of Dugan.
<br><br>
So did Dugan.
<br><br>
A few thoughts raced across his head as he turned to look. The icy cocoon was holding on for now, but not for long.
<br><br>
It seemed the fire net would kill Zen and Libby quite soon.
<br><br>
But Zen didn't look like a person on the verge of death at all. He even had the gall to continue chatting with him. Now what could be so important on his left? Dugan's eyes landed on Elizabeth.
<br><br>
The moment Dugan turned his head, Elizabeth approached him and grabbed his neck with one hand.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" he cried out.
<br><br>
Elizabeth's only answer was a ball of flame in her palm.
<br><br>
Boom! Elizabeth used all her strength to attack Dugan, not to kill him, but to exhaust the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body.
<br><br>
Dugan was stupefied that Elizabeth would attack him.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits in Dugan's body began to lose power under the force and the divine flame of the Sun Crow race combined.
<br><br>
Now that Dugan's Chaotic Source Spirits were depleted, his physical strength became negligible.
<br><br>
Elizabeth cut her fingertip lightly, infusing a drop of her blood into the meridian on Dugan's neck.
<br><br>
"Have you gone mad? What is this, Elizabeth?"
<br><br>
Dugan covered his neck with his hand and stepped back. Of course his first thought was that Elizabeth had betrayed their race, but if that were so, why hadn't she killed him? Libby was as confused as Dugan.
<br><br>
She turned to look at Zen. "What the hell is going on? What are you two up to?"
<br><br>
After Zen appeared, Libby had been expecting a fight, not this inexplicable scene.
<br><br>
"Just wait and see," Zen said in a flat tone.
<br><br>
Stumbling away from Elizabeth, Dugan suddenly felt a fierce pain from his neck, spreading all over his body rapidly. The blood in his entire body felt like it was boiling as it was assimilated by the blood Elizabeth had just infused him with.
<br><br>
The pain went on for a while before subsiding as quickly as it began. There seemed to be nothing wrong with Dugan's body now except for the exhausted Chaotic Source Spirits within him.
<br><br>
"Elizabeth, if you don't explain this to me right now, I'll kill you along with them!" Dugan screamed, seething.
<br><br>
Elizabeth heaved a deep sigh.
<br><br>
The bloodline worship was a kind of faith rooted in their blood. The culture of the Sun Crow race, entrenched across generations, made this faith stronger than steel. Elizabeth felt that she was somehow betraying her Emperor Charm like this, but she literally had no control in the matter.
<br><br>
Now that there was someone else caught in this dilemma though, she started to feel a little better.
<br><br>
"Ask him," Elizabeth said, pointing at Zen.
<br><br>
Confused, Dugan and Libby turned to look at Zen again. The shadow of Emperor Charm now appeared above his head, making a pronouncement, "When you see Zen, consider him as you would me. Obey his orders unconditionally."
<br><br>
"Why you..."
<br><br>
Dugan was about to curse Zen for that vague illusion of Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
But just then, an overwhelming force took over him. "Yes, I will do as Zen commands," he ended up saying.
<br><br>
Libby's mouth hung open in surprise at this turn of events.
<br><br>
She seriously wanted to hurl profanities right now.
<br><br>
It all seemed like a charade, but she knew this was all real.
<br><br>
"And we have the second one. Very good." Zen smiled faintly. He glanced up at the sky.
<br><br>
High above the Oneness Array, the Lofty Swords and the members of the Sun Crow race continued to fly around, caught in a fierce battle.
<br><br>
What the Oneness Sky Palace could really use right now was some highercaliber combat power.
<br><br>
The strength of Emperor Charm's royal guards alone could match that of the leaders and powerful warriors of the seven mountains.
<br><br>
If Zen could infuse the blood into these guards, they would all be under his control and would serve their side instead.
<br><br>
Elizabeth had been the first infusion. Dugan was the second.
<br><br>
"Explain to me what the hell is going on. Right now!" Libby shouted, frustrated at not having been given a straight answer all this time.
<br><br>
In response, Zen only said, "Please melt the ice cocoon."
<br><br>
"Just answer my question, or I swear I'll lock you in here for the rest of your life!" As she said this, the Snow Ice Crystals above her head flashed with light. The ice cocoon grew thicker.
<br><br>
Zen gave Libby an exasperated look. He didn't understand why she was so angry, but it seemed he had no choice but to explain. "I just had some means to make them defect. All you have to know is that they are now subject to my control."
<br><br>
Having gotten a simple answer, Libby reluctantly opened the ice cocoon.
<br><br>
She actually still didn't understand exactly what Zen did, but it seemed he was telling the truth. After all, two prominent members of the Sun Crow race, Elizabeth and Dugan, were indeed obeying his orders.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A group of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows arrived. Libby watched Zen stand on one and take to the sky. She was left in a daze, bracing against the updraft of their flight.
<br><br>
Chapter 3653 Approaching Emperor Charm had more than eighty royal guards.
<br><br>
They were divided into three ranks according to their strength.
<br><br>
Dugan was a very strong warrior and was near the top of the second rank.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elizabeth's strength belonged in the first rank even though she was not a royal guard.
<br><br>
Of course, as the leader of the Divine Lair, Elizabeth had an extraordinarily superior status in the Sun Crow race. Even the most powerful royal guards were not as good as her.
<br><br>
Micah and Bagot were at the top of the first rank of the royal guards.
<br><br>
But even though they were the highest in rank, they always kept a low profile. They guarded the Sun Crow race all the time and they rarely showed up in public.
<br><br>
There was no hint of a doubt that they were absolutely loyal to Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
The battle in which the Sun Crow race had gone all out was a huge test for their abilities. After all, the Oneness Sky Palace was heavily defended and by no means weak.
<br><br>
At this moment, Micah flapped his wings so hard as he went upward.
<br><br>
The one who was constantly retreating to the covers of the sky was none other than Auden from the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He kept flying and retreating in the air, with three evil eyes floating all around him.
<br><br>
The three evil eyes constantly blinked. Every time they blinked, a flying sword with a sharp blade shot out quickly.
<br><br>
These flying swords looked ordinary, but the power contained in them was truly terrifying.
<br><br>
Even a powerful warrior like Micah would not be able to withstand a single stab from the flying sword. The flying sword was really deadly.
<br><br>
Micah had already suffered from two strikes from trying to get close to Auden previously. As a result, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body had been tremendously exhausted.
<br><br>
After that, Micah was so careful in pursuing Auden that he did not dare to fight head on.
<br><br>
So even though his speed was far faster than Auden's, he still did not approach him.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! The flying swords continuously shot out viciously from the three evil eyes.
<br><br>
There was a profoundly serious look on Auden's old face.
<br><br>
He could not remember how long it was since his last battle. At this critical moment, he had no choice but to go all out.
<br><br>
With his wings flapping tirelessly, Micah moved gracefully in the air from left to right as he dodged the flying swords. With every flying sword he dodged, he closed the distance between him and Auden.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace is doomed. We both know that you are a famous veteran in the palace, so you must be able to assess the situation clearly. If you submit to the Sun Crow race, our emperor will forget everything you did in the past," Micah said as he approached.
<br><br>
Back then, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm were as close as brothers. However, the two became hostile and cold to each other later.
<br><br>
Auden had scolded and embarrassed Emperor Charm right in his face, so they bore grudges and resentment against each other.
<br><br>
The three evil eyes floating beside Auden were constantly rolling, so the angle of the flying swords was quickly adjusted. He smiled lightly and said, "Swordsmen attach great importance to moral integrity. So you must be aware that if the Oneness Sky Palace falls, we will kill ourselves with our swords. I don't care whether Emperor Charm will forget the past or not!"
<br><br>
Micah stared at Auden indifferently. He knew very well that Auden was a stubborn man. Besides, he didn't mean to convince him. The reason why he was conversing with him was to distract him.
<br><br>
"The path that our emperor follows is the only true solution. It would be for your good if you just surrender and completely submit to him," Micah said calmly.
<br><br>
The corners of Auden's mouth curled up into a smirk. He said in a rather disdainful tone, "When it comes to choosing the right way, you demonic birds surely can't think independently, can you? You just blindly follow your emperor. What a pity. Ha-ha..."
<br><br>
Because of the bloodline worship, Emperor Charm always had the final say in the Sun Crow race. Even though Elizabeth and Micah were extremely intelligent, they had no doubt about Emperor Charm's thoughts and decisions.
<br><br>
Since the Oneness Sky Palace didn't adhere to bloodline worship, they didn't have the same situation. No matter how wise and powerful Eastern Emperor Taiyi was, his subordinates would always give him advice when he did something wrong. Therefore, it was reasonable for Auden to despise the Sun Crow race and their bloodline worship.
<br><br>
However, just as Auden finished speaking, the corner of Micah's mouth curled up into a grin. A white light rushed over from his back at an extremely fast speed.
<br><br>
Swish! When Auden realized what had happened, he was unable to dodge Micah's attack. His eyes suddenly opened wide, and a crescent shaped bubble appeared on the surface of his body.
<br><br>
The white light that was rapidly approaching him was Bagot of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
He was fighting with Pearce at first. But after he activated his bloodline power, he greatly increased his speed and shifted to attack Auden secretly.
<br><br>
At such an incredible speed, Bagot was extremely confident that he could wreck Auden with a single blow! However, the fragile-looking bubble that appeared on the surface of Auden's body turned out to be incredibly tougher than what Bagot expected.
<br><br>
Under the impact of Bagot's attack and speed, the bubble was constantly compressed and deformed, but it did not break.
<br><br>
With a bow, Auden managed to distance himself from Bagot. The three evil eyes around him emitted an even more ferociously blinding light.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! The vicious flying swords continued to attack Micah.
<br><br>
When Bagot was about to launch another attack, a sharp sword light suddenly fell from the sky and blocked him.
<br><br>
With a grim face, Pearce said, "Bagot, I'd like to remind you that your opponent is me!"
<br><br>
Bagot frowned and stared at Pearce fiercely.
<br><br>
Although their strength was pretty much the same, it was extremely difficult to fight against Pearce. Bagot was angry and annoyed to have Pearce as his opponent.
<br><br>
He planned to kill Auden first, and then deal with Pearce together with Micah.
<br><br>
The four of them confronted each other as they were in the air.
<br><br>
However, the intense confrontation did not last long.
<br><br>
A large number of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, led by Elizabeth and Dugan, flew over to them from below.
<br><br>
When Bagot saw the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, he was extremely overjoyed.
<br><br>
"Just in time! They finally made it!"
<br><br>
On the other hand, the faces of Pearce and Auden darkened.
<br><br>
Previously, they had really hoped that these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows would be of help to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
But Elizabeth had taken them back sooner than they expected. They realized that Zen, the controller of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, might be in danger.
<br><br>
Pearce and Auden looked at each other grimly, their eyes filled with regret.
<br><br>
The speed at which the Oneness Sky Palace collapsed was way faster than they had imagined.
<br><br>
Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows emerged from below and formed a small island floating in the air. Elizabeth and Dugan stood side by side, while Micah and Bagot followed behind them.
<br><br>
Micah and Bagot could sense if the Other Shore Tokens or other methods, such as the Inner-world Generating Avatar, were used to control people's thoughts or souls.
<br><br>
Never did they think that Elizabeth and Dugan would submit to another Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"Elder Auden, Elder Pearce, I'd like to give you one final chance," Micah continued. He really wanted to recruit the two of them to their side.
<br><br>
However, they completely ignored him. They had long wanted to sacrifice themselves, and now was the time for them to fight desperately to the end.
<br><br>
"Cut this crappy nonsense!" Pearce shouted coldly.
<br><br>
The sword blades wildly vibrated, and his aura soared.
<br><br>
Just as Auden and Pearce were about to fight desperately to their deaths, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, which originally spread out in the air, suddenly rolled up.
<br><br>
Then, Zen showed up from under one of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
Chapter 3654 Getting More People To His Side The huge Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were controlled by Emperor Charm like vicious puppets.
<br><br>
They intertwined with each other and formed a unique and gigantic maze that eventually trapped Elizabeth, Dugan, Micah, and Bagot.
<br><br>
Leaning against a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, Zen turned to Auden and Pearce who were a few meters away, and let out an intriguing smile.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A huge Lofty Sword darted upwards. Sitting on the magnificent blade, Libby couldn't help but purse her lips as she looked at the pile of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, with doubt and caution.
<br><br>
Pearce caught a glimpse of Libby and then stared back at Zen, bearing bewildered eyes.
<br><br>
"Zen, what is going on?" Auden finally asked.
<br><br>
It was really absurd from whatever angle it was looked upon. No matter how hard they guessed, there was no telling what was inside Zen's head at that moment.
<br><br>
"Elder Pearce, Elder Auden, just trust me. You'll know later," Zen replied but didn't disclose anything.
<br><br>
At the same time, blue and green flames suddenly burst out from inside the maze formed by the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. It turned out that Elizabeth and Dugan had taken the initiative to launch the first strike.
<br><br>
As the flames swirled violently, Micah and Bagot were caught by surprise.
<br><br>
They couldn't figure out why the loyal Elizabeth would dare betray the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
The flames continued to sizzle from within the maze as Micah and Bagot roared, mightily deflecting the attacks thrown at them.
<br><br>
Soon after, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows also spurted out blue flames, boosting the attacks of Elizabeth and Dugan. The whole maze was blazing like a tremendous hellfire.
<br><br>
Micah and Bagot were powerful warriors, only second to Emperor Charm in the whole Sun Crow race. Their strength was even comparable to that of the leaders of the seven mountains. Even if they were caught off guard by the sneak attack of Elizabeth and Dugan, they wouldn't be defeated by them in one go.
<br><br>
However, if it was Emperor Charm himself who dealt with Micah and Bagot, then they wouldn't stand a chance, as he had supreme control over the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.
<br><br>
The fierce battle lasted for only about half a minute. Then, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows forming the maze started to spread out again.
<br><br>
Elizabeth and Dugan finally got out.
<br><br>
Dugan was unscathed, while half of Elizabeth's beautiful face was burnt due to the encounter.
<br><br>
"Are you all right?" Zen asked worriedly.
<br><br>
Elizabeth reached out her hand and gently brushed her face. The burned part of her face quickly began recovering. She shook her head and answered, "I'm fine. It was my fault that I was accidentally injured by the flames."
<br><br>
She didn't have any dissatisfaction since it was the method of Emperor Charm that had hurt her. Being killed in his hands would even be an honor for her, so there was no issue whatsoever for receiving a measly injury.
<br><br>
As for Micah and Bagot, the two were covered with dust and grime as they got out of the encirclement. They were not severely harmed but their faces were contorted in pain.
<br><br>
Each of them obtained a wound on their chest, where the transformed blood flowed. After the pain was gone, they floated in midair and stared blankly at Zen. There was an extremely contradictory feeling that rose from within their hearts.
<br><br>
Buzz… Emperor Charm's shadow emerged in the sky and once again issued an order to make the two powerful warriors submit to Zen. Micah and Bagot didn't have a choice, so they lowered their heads as they felt rather conflicted about what was happening.
<br><br>
Even Pearce and Auden were dumbfounded at the scene.
<br><br>
They were so shocked that they couldn't think of a logical reason why this was happening.
<br><br>
They wondered what that shadow above Zen's head really was.
<br><br>
It couldn't be a soul fragment of Emperor Charm, could it? If it was a soul fragment of Emperor Charm, it could indeed command the hearts and minds of those who belonged in the Sun Crow race like Elizabeth and the others.
<br><br>
But still, the impending question was why would Emperor Charm help Zen and the Oneness Sky Palace? If he was that kind of person, the war wouldn't have happened in the first place.
<br><br>
It didn't make any sense for the two old men. They needed an explanation or they wouldn't be able to accept that these were all true.
<br><br>
"Fascinating…"
<br><br>
Libby chuckled as she sat on the Lofty Sword, watching the unfolding scenes.
<br><br>
Previously, she thought that Zen had just obtained the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows by sheer luck. However, they were all witnessing that he also made the most powerful warriors of the Sun Crow race stand on his side.
<br><br>
By what it looked, it seemed that Zen was planning to bring all the members of the Sun Crow race to his side.
<br><br>
The warriors of the Sun Crow race present were enough to give the entire Oneness Sky Palace an atrocious and tortuous battle. Now, if Zen really had full control over them, his status would even far surpass that of the mountain leaders, and ultimately be comparable to that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
One who possessed admirable talent would always have a strong sense of vigilance towards the rise of another domineering talent.
<br><br>
Therefore, even if Zen didn't do anything to provoke or offend Libby, she wouldn't be able to hide her hostility towards him in their first encounter.
<br><br>
But after only several days, she realized that they were not on the same level. Zen's ultimate ambition didn't lie in the Land of Sword Grief or the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Zen, can you please tell us now?" Auden asked as cautiously as possible.
<br><br>
There was definitely no one in the Source World that could make the strong warriors of the Sun Crow race fall into absolute submission except for Emperor Charm. So they were beginning to wonder if the shadow was the real Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Zen was actually faced with a difficult question that it almost gave him a headache.
<br><br>
During the fierce battle between the two enormous forces, both sides lost powerful warriors every second.
<br><br>
He didn't want to see anyone from the Oneness Sky Palace or the Sun Crow race die. But it was something inevitable in order to attain a much bigger goal.
<br><br>
Looking at the expression of the two elders, Zen didn't have a choice but to explain so that they could let this go.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen gave a simple answer, "I used the bloodline of the Sun Crow race… and it isn't the real Emperor Charm."
<br><br>
Normally, the elders wouldn't be satisfied with those explanations alone.
<br><br>
However, they also recognized that the on-going warfare was at the most menacing stage. Since Zen had come up with such an incredible scheme, they naturally had to seize every opportunity to gain the upper hand.
<br><br>
In fact, the two elders had the resolve to sacrifice themselves in this war if worst came to worst. But now that they were witnessing a new light of hope, they decided to push aside their doubts for now. The only thing in their minds right at this moment was to survive and win this war in any means possible.
<br><br>
"I understand your reason if you cannot disclose all information right now.
<br><br>
Rest assured, no matter what kind of method you are using, Auden and I are at your disposal," Pearce said with a burning passion in his eyes.
<br><br>
Zen nodded slightly as he was relieved to finally hear their positive response. At the same time, something caught his attention and he quickly turned towards that scene.
<br><br>
Seven huge sword shadows madly bombarded a certain member of the Sun Crow race. Deafening sounds reverberated like thunderous roars.
<br><br>
It turned out that the one who blasted out the sword shadows was Athemar, and the recipient of his ruthless skill was Tyrese of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Tyrese's strength was categorized at the bottom of the second rank among the royal guards. He presumed that Athemar's strength was far weaker than Pearce and Auden. With that, he thought that he could easily defeat Athemar in a one-on-one battle.
<br><br>
However, it never occurred to him that Athemar was actually strong enough to be ranked first among the Oneness Governors.
<br><br>
The Lofty Swords chased him down vehemently. Tyrese could only curse wildly as he continued to retreat.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Under the persistent bombardment of the sword shadows, Tyrese's Chaotic Source Spirits had already fallen into severe exhaustion. Fear started to crept all over his face as he hysterically thought on how to successfully escape.
<br><br>
Athemar had a serious look on his face and didn't have the slightest intention of letting him go alive.
<br><br>
"Master Athemar, wait for a second!" Zen suddenly descended and tried to stop him from pursuing Tyrese.
<br><br>
He threw a cold glance at Zen. "What do you think you're doing?" He couldn't think of any reason for Zen to stop him.
<br><br>
Tyrese let out a deep sigh as he noticed that Athemar stopped for a while from pursuing him. As he was about to fly away and escape farther, Elizabeth appeared and landed beside him.
<br><br>
"Elizabeth! Great timing! I was initially thinking of escaping, but now, I could use your help!" Tyrese let out a wicked smile as he told Elizabeth his plan. He didn't need to run away anymore, and he could get even with Athemar for humiliating him in the earlier battle.
<br><br>
"Let's go together and kill that bastard!" Tyrese turned into the direction of Athemar and was already prepared to go back. However, Elizabeth ignored him and with a gentle flap of her wings, she had already approached Tyrese.
<br><br>
As Tyrese's Chaotic Source Spirits had suffered too much fatigue due to the earlier battle with Athemar, it saved her a lot of effort. A dark red light flashed from her fingertips and quickly pierced through Tyrese from his back.
<br><br>
Chapter 3655 Gethin Taking Actions Elizabeth changed Tyrese's blood under Athemar's suspicious gaze.
<br><br>
Pearce landed quietly beside Athemar and patted him on the shoulder.
<br><br>
There was no need for words. Athemar could figure out what Pearce meant with that simple gesture.
<br><br>
With Elizabeth's help along with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, Zen was able to change the blood of all warriors of the Sun Crow race that attacked the Oneness Array.
<br><br>
One of the members sensed something was wrong halfway and tried to escape. Unfortunately for him, Micah and Bagot forcefully recaptured him under Zen's orders.
<br><br>
The more members of the Sun Crow race in Zen's team, the easier it would be for him to deal with his other remaining enemies.
<br><br>
After dealing with the Sun Crow race in the Oneness Array, Zen turned his attention to the Azure Array.
<br><br>
The seven great arrays were originally separated by several hundred miles.
<br><br>
After the Sky Net was folded, the arrays drew closer to each other. The distance between the Azure Array and the Oneness Array was now only about two hundred miles which could be crossed in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Azure Mountain was the best at defense among the seven mountains and the Azure Array was called the Shield and Sword Array as a result.
<br><br>
After launching their attacks, the Sun Crow race still failed in destroying the array and ended up getting driven out by the people of the Azure Mountain.
<br><br>
The Azure Mountain's head joined his warriors to defend their array and keep it guarded at all times.
<br><br>
Defense, however, was intrinsically passive. There was still the possibility of the array being destroyed if all the Azure Mountain people did was stay there on guard ‒ which was exactly what happened.
<br><br>
The Shield and Sword Array was now on the verge of collapse under the relentless attacks of the Sun Crow race. All the strategic positions on the left side had been conquered leading to low morale among the Azure Mountain warriors.
<br><br>
"Hold on, brothers! The Oneness Array is quite close. Once they defeat their enemies, they'll surely come to our rescue!" the Azure Mountain's head assured his warriors in a loud, determined voice even if his own resolve was already shaking.
<br><br>
His assurance did the trick in lifting his brethren's spirit. The beaten warriors looked a bit better with their faces now filled with anticipation.
<br><br>
Things might not necessarily go their way but a sliver of hope remained.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race had an edge in this war since they had more powerful warriors in their ranks. Though the Oneness Array was marshalled by the likes of Pearce and Auden, there were far more powerful people within the Sun Crow race that could face against them. For all they knew, the people of the Oneness Mountain might be too busy protecting themselves, but the Azure Mountain had to remain hopeful.
<br><br>
Soon enough, black dots appeared in the distance and the Azure Mountain's head looked on in despair.
<br><br>
"More Sun Crows are coming!"
<br><br>
"They came from the direction of the Oneness Array!"
<br><br>
"Did the Oneness Mountain fall?"
<br><br>
Any sort of hope they had was now squashed by the appearance of these Sun Crows. They wished for reinforcement but they were given more enemies to seal their doom. Such was the cruelty of reality.
<br><br>
"Welcome, Micah and Bagot!" a Sun Crow called Calvert greeted these new arrivals. "You came here faster than I would've thought. These Azure Mountain brats are a bunch of cowards, always standing guard in their array." These incoming allies were welcomed warmly by the Sun Crow race. Calvert, like Micah and Bago, was a first-rank warrior and led the attack against the Azure Array.
<br><br>
Micah nodded with a fake smile plastered on his face as he landed beside Calvert along with Bagot, Elizabeth, and Dugan.
<br><br>
"The humans guarding the Oneness Array are the strongest amongst the seven mountains," Calvert remarked. "How were you able to defeat them in such a short period of time?"
<br><br>
Micah only sighed. "It's a long story."
<br><br>
Calvert nodded with a smile. "A story to share for another time. Let us conquer the Azure Array first!"
<br><br>
Victory was definitely within their grasp! The people of the Azure Mountain could only look on hopelessly at the imminent attack of their now larger enemies.
<br><br>
Once all seven mountains were defeated, the destruction of the entire Oneness Sky Palace would be inevitable.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm did not even need to show up.
<br><br>
Their defeat was now moments away.
<br><br>
Micah nodded at Calvert. "Okay then. Let's do it."
<br><br>
With Calvert's directive, the Sun Crows he led began to launch their attack.
<br><br>
Unbeknownst to them, Micah's group was not there to aid but to attack them! As Micah gave the signal, Zen controlled all the Sun Crows and made them stab their own allies.
<br><br>
Calvert's group was weaker compared to Micah's and the suddenness of their betrayal caught them off guard.
<br><br>
The sight of Sun Crows stabbing their own shocked the Azure Mountain's head immensely. He had to pinch himself just to make sure it wasn't a dream.
<br><br>
"What... What are they doing?!"
<br><br>
"They're killing each other!" "How is this possible?!"
<br><br>
"What in the world is happening?!"
<br><br>
After Micah subdued Calvert's group, Zen along with Pearce and Auden slowly descended from the sky.
<br><br>
All throughout, they hadn't given Calvert and his men any chance to resist.
<br><br>
Before they could even think of escaping, they had already been injected with the transformed blood.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in satisfaction. "Well done."
<br><br>
He now had over twenty warriors of the Sun Crow race on his side. His force was nothing to be scoffed at since it was comprised of these powerful warriors.
<br><br>
Any decrease in the Sun Crow race's army was a victory as far as he was concerned.
<br><br>
"Elder Pearce! Elder Auden! What happened?" The earlier events felt like a dream and the Azure Mountain's head was still in a bit of a daze.
<br><br>
He couldn't be blamed for still remaining on guard at their strange but much-appreciated allies. Their situation was just completely reversed in a snap.
<br><br>
He was actually scared that it was all just an illusion.
<br><br>
There was no need for Zen to explain things all over again. Pearce simply sent a message to the Azure Mountain's head via life vitality to give him a brief outline of the situation.
<br><br>
After all the information had been given, the Azure Mountain's head could only stare at Zen with wide-eyed shock.
<br><br>
This man had long been a famous disciple in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Zen had stood out in Stage Four of the Other Shore, causing quite a stir.
<br><br>
Back then, the Bearing race couldn't deal with him and had no choice but to negotiate with the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
All of the mountain heads agreed that he was someone who had a promising future.
<br><br>
It normally took hundreds or thousands of years for a young genius to become a real master.
<br><br>
However, it had only been a couple of years and Zen was now the mastermind behind this reversal of fortune in the great war between two super forces.
<br><br>
The Azure Mountain's head could only sigh in disbelief. It didn't matter to him just what sort of method Zen used in making the Sun Crows surrender to him, what mattered was that this war was now in their hands.
<br><br>
When the array opened to let them in, a new group of people appeared in the distance.
<br><br>
Rays of purple light emerged from their path as they arrived.
<br><br>
Pearce's face darkened angrily as he saw the arrival of this purple glow.
<br><br>
"Gethin is coming!"
<br><br>
Even the Azure Mountain's head looked infuriated. "He must think that our Azure Mountain is the weakest among all the mountains so he chose to attack us first."
<br><br>
Gethin's betrayal of the other six mountains at such a critical moment greatly disappointed the other leaders.
<br><br>
There was no way back for the Vastness Mountain now. This betrayal would forever stay with Gethin and he would have to eliminate the other six mountains to avoid any possible revenge.
<br><br>
When the Sun Crow race launched their violent attacks among the six mountains, Gethin took his time and got his own people ready.
<br><br>
Just as the Azure Mountain's head predicted, they were his first target.
<br><br>
Chapter 3656 Cooperation Of Two Races Gethin and Natasha seemed highly imposing when they arrived at the Azure Array so spectacularly.
<br><br>
With the strength of the Vastness Mountain in cooperation with the Sun Crow race, bringing the Azure Mountain under their control was supposedly easy.
<br><br>
But seeing Pearce and Auden came as a surprise to Gethin—he hadn't ever expected the Oneness Mountain people all to be there.
<br><br>
With these two as commanders, the Oneness Mountain was no push-over that could be bullied by just anyone.
<br><br>
Frowning, Gethin turned his head to find many members of the Sun Crow race gathering outside the Azure Array. When Gethin saw Micah and Bagot, in particular, confidence came flooding back into him.
<br><br>
While the two sides were equal in strength, the Vastness Mountain was enough to break the balance.
<br><br>
"Gethin! Eastern Emperor Taiyi has treated you well, but how could you betray him when the Oneness Sky Palace is in trouble?! Do you even have a conscience?" Pearce couldn't hold back his anger the moment he saw Gethin arrive.
<br><br>
The seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace had always been related much like siblings, which served as the foundation on which the Oneness Sky Palace was founded. If it weren't for Eastern Emperor Taiyi, neither the Vastness Mountain nor Gethin would have had it so easy.
<br><br>
"A conscience?" Gethin merely sneered. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi is so willful that he has led all creatures of the world onto the wrong path. We, the Vastness Mountain, do nothing but seek the right path!"
<br><br>
Gethin wanted those words to be heard by Elizabeth, Micah, and the rest of the Sun Crow race to show his sincerity.
<br><br>
He had expected Micah, Elizabeth, and others to echo his words, but when he turned to them, all he found were cold eyes looking back at him.
<br><br>
Something was wrong about the atmosphere, he thought.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Gethin couldn't imagine what happened to them.
<br><br>
Inwardly, Micah and Bagot agreed with Gethin's choice, but they didn't seem to express it.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Auden looked at Gethin with a forced smile and said in an aged voice, "This may be the most stupid choice you've ever made in your life."
<br><br>
"What? Why do you think so?" Aggressively, Natasha asked in return.
<br><br>
Zen looked at her and smiled faintly. "You'll know soon," he said.
<br><br>
When her eyes fell on him, the color of her face shifted immediately. "Zen, you're so lucky you're still alive right now!"
<br><br>
As early as a few months ago, they had already received an order to capture Zen, but they never found a good chance to take action.
<br><br>
Despite the fierce battle between the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace, Zen had managed to stay safe and sound, much to Natasha's surprise.
<br><br>
"You seem surprised, Lady Natasha?" Zen asked plainly.
<br><br>
With brows raised in response, Natasha said condescendingly, "I am indeed surprised. But it doesn't matter. You're destined to die today."
<br><br>
In her and Gethin's opinion, the Sun Crow race was likely to win along with the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
But Zen revealed a bright smile. "I'd like to see who is destined to die today."
<br><br>
Then, he pointed a finger at the sky. "Go!"
<br><br>
Gethin, Natasha, Holden, the leaders of the intelligence agency, and the rest of the powerful warriors of the Vastness Mountain found Zen's behavior all too strange.
<br><br>
Did he have the right to give orders there? Pearce and Auden were present, after all.
<br><br>
But the next moment made everything clear.
<br><br>
It wasn't the people from the Azure Mountain Zen was giving orders to—it was the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, many members of the Sun Crow race, including Micah, Bagot, and Elizabeth, were flying up and surrounding Gethin and his comrades.
<br><br>
Gethin stared at Micah with eyes wide open in disbelief.
<br><br>
Natasha's jaw went slack as her body grew extremely stiff.
<br><br>
"Micah, what's going on?" Gethin asked carefully.
<br><br>
Giving Gethin an indifferent glance, Micah sighed as he said, "Take action."
<br><br>
There was nothing light about Zen's order—the members of the Sun Crow race couldn't disobey him.
<br><br>
Seeing that Micah, Bagot, and the rest intended to fight against them, Gethin roared. The powerful warriors of the Vastness Mountain followed suit and pulled out their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
In an instant, the sky was filled with auras and flames.
<br><br>
Taking a look at the sky, Zen then turned to Pearce. "Elder Pearce, can you give the Sun Crow race a hand?"
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race had completely surrendered to Zen and now served as a valuable combat force.
<br><br>
While they were definitely strong enough to fight against the Vastness Mountain, casualties probably couldn't be avoided.
<br><br>
With the help of the Oneness Mountain and the Azure Mountain, though, things were bound to be much easier.
<br><br>
Pearce knew just what Zen was thinking.
<br><br>
"Everyone," he said immediately. "We should stand out there and eliminate the traitors from the Vastness Mountain. Those members of the Sun Crow race have already surrendered to Zen—don't be afraid of them!"
<br><br>
And so Pearce took the lead and rushed out.
<br><br>
Having followed Eastern Emperor Taiyi almost all his life, he absolutely loathed traitors.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
Auden, Athemar, Goran, and many powerful warriors of the Azure Array also soared into the air.
<br><br>
It couldn't be ignored how much progress Gethin had made developing his strength over the years.
<br><br>
As he held a wide, purple sword in his hand, purple dragon energy circled his body. Each time he waved the sword, purple light appeared before everything surrounding him was crushed to dust.
<br><br>
Even Micah and Bagot, two of the most powerful warriors of the Sun Crow race, couldn't get close to Gethin when they worked together. They couldn't dream of taking him down so soon.
<br><br>
But once Pearce and Auden joined the battle, the position of the Vastness Mountain shifted dramatically.
<br><br>
While Gethin was indeed powerful, he was still no match for Yasamin nor Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Pearce and Auden might not have been as strong as Gethin, but the gap between them wasn't too great. When the two attacked Gethin along with Micah and Bagot, not even Gethin could contend with them.
<br><br>
He was rather high spirited when he arrived, but the tables had turned on him. Gethin was enraged.
<br><br>
For a moment, he even wondered if he was having a nightmare.
<br><br>
Just as Gethin was struggling to fight, Natasha's scream resounded from nearby.
<br><br>
Among the many powerful warriors, Natasha wasn't all that outstanding.
<br><br>
She couldn't hold on for mere seconds when she was attacked by a number of people simultaneously.
<br><br>
At the sight of her tragic death, Gethin roared, furious. The purple light was surging then—he was determined to avenge Natasha.
<br><br>
But as his aura surged, flying swords came rushing at his head one after another.
<br><br>
They were strong, having emerged from the three evil eyes by Auden's side.
<br><br>
No one was willing to face them head-on.
<br><br>
Gethin was ready to dodge them when an Other Shore Token appeared over Bagot's head. It was a triangle with three sides as smooth as mirrors— something very small and exquisite. No one had ever seen such a token before.
<br><br>
"Freeze!"
<br><br>
Bagot called out.
<br><br>
With a flash of light on the token, Gethin was imprisoned in a triangular space, rendered unable to escape.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom..."
<br><br>
Flying swords containing great power crashed toward his body as he was imprisoned.
<br><br>
Even with a rare defensive Other Shore Treasure, he still couldn't withstand such a relentless attack.
<br><br>
Chapter 3657 Defeat The Vastness Mountain Soon enough, the Other Shore Treasure that protected Gethin's body was shattered and he could only resist attacks with his physical body.
<br><br>
He did have strong Chaotic Source Spirits inside his body, but the force he could bear was limited.
<br><br>
In desperation, he intended to burn his Other Shore Token to attack, but given the current situation, he eventually gave up.
<br><br>
Perhaps he could still put up a fight, but he still wouldn't be able to evade death and had to bear the indescribable pain.
<br><br>
He never actually thought that he would pass away during the war between the two great races, the Sun Crow race and the human race.
<br><br>
Even if he didn't burn the Other Shore Token, one of his subordinates did.
<br><br>
The one who did so was Holden, the old man who took Zen away from the Oneness Mountain before. His own Other Shore Token was a golden monkey.
<br><br>
It was known that anyone who burned the Other Shore Token would receive the punishment of the truth, which was extremely painful.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it wasn't only the violator of the rule who would suffer—but the Other Shore Token as well.
<br><br>
It wouldn't have been a problem if the Other Shore Token was lifeless, but Holden's golden monkey was still alive.
<br><br>
A loud, ear-splitting scream filled the air as the golden monkey burned hotly. A second later, its body grew to the size of a huge mountain and swallowed Holden in whole.
<br><br>
That Other Shore Token had just killed its master! The furious golden monkey continued to burn and tried to tear everything around it apart.
<br><br>
If there had been ordinary masters around the area, the golden monkey would've killed them.
<br><br>
Luckily, those who were present were by no means ordinary.
<br><br>
For instance, both Pearce and Micah were second only to those most powerful warriors.
<br><br>
Although the golden monkey was quite powerful, it was still under the control of several people. In the end it burned to death and left only a smoky smell, and finally it disappeared in the sky.
<br><br>
Swoosh! "This thing from the Other Shore is really horrible after it descends!" Pearce said after they got rid of the golden monkey.
<br><br>
Zen, who was not far away, heard Pearce's words and his heart skipped a beat. "Elder Pearce, the Other Shore Token has been burnt. Why did you say that it descended?" he asked.
<br><br>
Pearce looked at him and explained, "The true essence of burning the Other Shore Token is to make it descend.
<br><br>
The constant burning is just an appearance." "Is it because the truth rule is triggered?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Exactly," Pearce answered and glanced at Zen. Then he realized that the younger warrior knew as much as he did.
<br><br>
Zen simply nodded.
<br><br>
The Other Shore was indeed a level higher than the chaos from a certain point of view. At the very least, the flowers and plants that lived on it had powerful energy. Even the sand in Stage One contained one divine megaton of force, which was way more than those in the Source World and the chaos.
<br><br>
Five minutes later, Gethin, the ruler of the Vastness Mountain, died.
<br><br>
Two leaders of the intelligence agency were defeated and died as well.
<br><br>
In the end, only Barnaby and the other three masters from the Vastness Mountain were left.
<br><br>
One of the strong cultivators of the Azure Mountain used the chain that his Other Shore Token had formed to tie up Barnaby and the three masters.
<br><br>
Finally, their fates rested in the hands of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Barnaby passed by Zen and looked at him with dull eyes. After all, he still couldn't come to his senses from the huge change.
<br><br>
Regret was evident in his face.
<br><br>
Although he hadn't figured out why, he had clearly heard that the members of the Sun Crow race followed Zen's orders.
<br><br>
It was because of Zen that the Vastness Mountain had ended up like this! "I should've killed you at that time…" Barnaby hissed.
<br><br>
Back when Holden had brought Zen into the Vastness Mountain, he didn't know how to deal with Zen. Therefore, he ended up asking Barnaby for help. They didn't obtain the Truth Enlightenment, because Flamine and Yasamin soon found out what happened.
<br><br>
If Barnaby had already killed Zen, there wouldn't have been so much trouble.
<br><br>
Despite Barnaby's hateful stare, Zen only flashed a small smile. Then, Barnaby was taken away.
<br><br>
"Gethin asked for the moon. If it wasn't for Zen, he could've easily broken my array with the help of the Sun Crow race. Furthermore, he could've broken the other mountains' arrays one by one," said the leader of the Azure Mountain.
<br><br>
"That's for sure," Athemar said, smiling at Zen with satisfaction.
<br><br>
Even he himself couldn't believe that Zen could turn the tables on his own.
<br><br>
"What should we do next?" the leader of the Azure Mountain asked as he looked at Elizabeth and her clansmen. An idea suddenly popped up in his mind. Could Zen control all the members of the Sun Crow race? "Hurry up to the next array," Zen answered.
<br><br>
Of course, everyone knew his intentions.
<br><br>
Elizabeth pursed her lips. It was clear that she was unwilling. She wasn't convinced as Zen had controlled her for some reason.
<br><br>
Then came the Bright Array, the Golden Array, and the Ivory Array...
<br><br>
As more and more members of the Sun Crow race followed behind Zen, it became easier to deal with the remaining members that put up a struggle in their deathbed. Now, Zen's team had the absolute advantage since they were large in number.
<br><br>
While Zen subdued the members of the Sun Crow race, Pearce, Athemar, and even Libby secretly observed him.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before they discovered some rules.
<br><br>
It seemed that in order to control the members of the Sun Crow race, blood was needed. Those who had been controlled by Zen all had such kind of blood.
<br><br>
However, they were still confused about Emperor Charm's shadow, which suddenly appeared above Zen's head.
<br><br>
Was that really Emperor Charm? If so, why would he help Zen? If not, why could he control the members of the Sun Crow race? Nevertheless, they were overjoyed.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace had a difficult time in the battle, but they won in the end.
<br><br>
The moment they arrived at the Ivory Array, Zen had already subdued more than eighty warriors of the Sun Crow race. They were originally their race's main fighting forces.
<br><br>
Beside the Ivory Array was Springer, who led about eight members of the Sun Crow race to fight.
<br><br>
Yet, his plans were suddenly cut off when he saw Elizabeth and the other members of the Sun Crow race who stood on his opposite side. He couldn't believe his eyes.
<br><br>
Elizabeth stepped forward and persuaded him to surrender.
<br><br>
Everyone in the Sun Crow race knew that Springer had always refused to obey Elizabeth.
<br><br>
He refused to surrender from the start. No matter how many opponents he faced, he could hold on for a long time as long as he had the Inheritance of World.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen asked Emperor Charm to personally persuade him to surrender.
<br><br>
Although Springer and the other members of the Sun Crow race hadn't been injected with the blood yet, they began to doubt their own position as soon as they saw Emperor Charm. After all, eighty percent of their warriors, including Elizabeth, Bagot, and Micah, had already surrendered to him.
<br><br>
After a few moments of hesitation, Springer let out a helpless sigh. He gathered the remaining clansmen to surrender and let Elizabeth infuse her blood into his body.
<br><br>
Just when he was about to retrieve the world that he summoned, he looked towards the southeast with an unreadable expression.
<br><br>
"Eh, these Fickle Demons..."
<br><br>
The world that he summoned had a range of three million miles, and there were some Fickle Demons that loitered around in it.
<br><br>
Most of the Fickle Demons were quite weak, and only a few of them in the east had grown to the size of a small mountain.
<br><br>
Chapter 3658 Escape Zen's heart hammered in his chest when Springer mentioned the east side.
<br><br>
He realized that he had forgotten about one important thing.
<br><br>
The Evil God! He immediately focused and tried to sense the Evil God's location with a thought.
<br><br>
The Evil God was now his own Inner-world Generating Avatar. Just like his hands and feet, Zen could control him as long as he could sense him.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the Evil God could not refuse any order that Zen gave him.
<br><br>
However, Zen couldn't find the Evil God's location. He was naturally shocked and something popped up in his mind.
<br><br>
Before their current situation, he had already ordered the Evil God to return immediately after killing those Fickle Demons. Technically speaking, the Evil God would be unable to disobey the order or even escape.
<br><br>
After he thought for a while, he suddenly looked up at Springer and asked, "Can those Fickle Demons be killed?"
<br><br>
Now, Springer didn't know why Zen had asked such a question, but since "Emperor Charm" said Zen was his master, he couldn't refuse to answer him. Thus, he could only answer honestly, "The Fickle Demons can't be killed, and they can grow bigger if someone keeps hunting them down and killing them. They would disappear only if the entire Fickle World is destroyed. I will withdraw the summoned world now!"
<br><br>
There were still many Fickle Demons within the area. Most of the Oneness Guards hid in the twelve passes, but the Fickle Demons still continued to attack the twelve passes' arrays like mad.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute. Could you possibly check what the Fickle Demons see?"
<br><br>
said Zen.
<br><br>
"Of course I can," Springer replied, but he became even more confused.
<br><br>
What did Zen want to do? "I want to find someone who is in that direction!" Zen exclaimed and pointed to the east. Upon hearing Zen's words, Springer suddenly thought of the huge Fickle Demons.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he had entered the Fickle Demons' minds.
<br><br>
He couldn't help but be stunned at what he saw.
<br><br>
He caught sight of a human being, who was attacking the Fickle Demons like crazy.
<br><br>
Those Fickle Demons did not die, but became stronger every time they were attacked. That human being should've realized that already.
<br><br>
Despite that, he patiently continued to attack the Fickle Demons and seemed to make them become stronger! When the Fickle Demons' bodies became larger, the man was finally at a disadvantage. He had no choice but to run to save his life.
<br><br>
As he ran, he did not forget to turn around and attack the Fickle Demons.
<br><br>
Then he flew towards the east. "Have you found him?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Springer stretched out his hand and a translucent black gem appeared on his palm. The black gem was the Fickle World's Civilization Artifact, which was also Springer's most important possession. He seldom showed it to others.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The black gem released a thick black smoke that floated towards Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
The smoke from the Civilization Artifact could turn a person into a Fickle Demon. If Springer chose to launch a sneak attack, then Zen might not be able to resist.
<br><br>
Indeed, Springer had intended to do so.
<br><br>
Yet, he immediately discarded the thought as soon as the idea came to him.
<br><br>
He could not hurt his master.
<br><br>
He mentally sighed and chose to compromise. Besides, the whole Sun Crow race had defected, and he wasn't the only one to blame.
<br><br>
When Zen's eyes touched the smoke, he saw the scene that the Evil God was being chased by the Fickle Demons.
<br><br>
"He just used the Ways-blending Energy, but why did he keep activating the power of the Civilization Artifact?" said Zen with arched brows. He had sensed just now that the Evil God had used the power to deal with the Fickle Demons, which he thought was normal.
<br><br>
He didn't think much about it, but felt that something was not right.
<br><br>
He knew that the Evil God only used one or two divine megatons of force at a time.
<br><br>
Although he had been confused about the matter before, he didn't really think about it carefully. Now, it seemed that the Evil God was testing the limits of his control.
<br><br>
Springer saw how Zen clearly looked cautious and stressed, and then said, "This person has only left for a short time, so he must be still in the North Unicorn Province. We can help you find him!"
<br><br>
In turn, Zen hesitated for a second, before he finally ordered the members of the Sun Crow race in a deep voice, "Find where he is now!"
<br><br>
He didn't want to order the Sun Crow race to do anything at this critical moment, especially when he wasn't their real commander in chief. It was just that he simply couldn't ignore the Evil God's potential and the fact that he had comprehended the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
He wouldn't let the Evil God escape! "Yes!" Springer said and bowed to Zen. Then he turned to Bagot.
<br><br>
To find someone in the vast North Unicorn Province was like searching for a needle in a haystack. However, there were many members of the Sun Crow race, so they might be able to find the Evil God if they searched together! Bagot waved his hand, and numerous Sun Crows flew out, heading to the east.
<br><br>
The current situation was no different from what Zen had thought.
<br><br>
The Evil God had continuously extracted the power not to defend against the enemy, but to check Zen's control range.
<br><br>
He couldn't disobey Zen's orders, but he also couldn't kill the Fickle Demons. Therefore, he didn't need to return to Zen before he killed them.
<br><br>
Whenever he attacked, he also retreated. After he had retreated for one million and five hundred thousand miles, he discovered that he couldn't draw out more divine megatons of power.
<br><br>
He was slightly happy. Thus, he stopped fighting the Fickle Demons, got rid of them, and ran away.
<br><br>
He was finally free from the feeling of being imprisoned that had haunted him for so long! Actually, the Nihility race had already decided to help him get rid of the Inner-world Generating Avatar through the Chilling Bone Land. It was known that entering the Chilling Bone Land was equivalent to being reborn.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, he had to ask Sienna to erase his memories so he could deceive Zen. As a result, the Evil God right now didn't know about that specific detail at all, which was why he was willing to take the risk and escape.
<br><br>
As he continued to move east for another million miles, the Fickle World in that same area disappeared.
<br><br>
Since he used to own a Civilization Artifact, he clearly knew the rules of the world that descended.
<br><br>
If a world disappeared, it meant that either its owner withdrew it, or the owner had died.
<br><br>
The Evil God refused to accept either of those outcomes, as it meant that the war would end.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he wasn't safe in the North Unicorn Province, so he wanted to leave as soon as possible.
<br><br>
But the North Unicorn Province was extremely large. If one wanted to leave without the transmission array, it would probably take them over a month.
<br><br>
A few moments later, he had an idea. He eventually found a river and jumped in with a splash. After he sank to the bottom, he dug out a cave and proceeded to drill downwards.
<br><br>
Hiding deep underground should be the safest way.
<br><br>
He dug a cave with a complicated pathway as he went along. He killed a few long snakes that lurked underground, and then finally opened up a small underground secret hideout.
<br><br>
In the secret hideout, the Evil God sat cross-legged as he recited the Truth of Godly Way and went to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
He didn't know that he had already contacted the Black Ship because he had lost his memories, so he continued to think about how to get in touch with Shera.
<br><br>
Chapter 3659 Nine-Sun World Destruction As the Evil God's Soul of Light condensed on the Other Shore, from not far off, a red ball shot out of a diamond shaped array.
<br><br>
Sienna emerged from the red ball, glaring at the Evil God impatiently.
<br><br>
He stared back warily at this uninvited guest.
<br><br>
"You made me wait too long," complained Sienna.
<br><br>
She had no desire to stay in such a low stage of the Other Shore, especially with a pervading pressure in Stage Fourteen weighing down and making her uncomfortable.
<br><br>
But she could not disobey her leader and was left with no choice but to wait patiently on the spot. How could she be expected to be in a good mood after that? "Wait for what?" The Evil God stared at the woman before him from top to bottom.
<br><br>
Sienna ignored his question and waved her hand. The Kaleidoscopic Golden Dipper covered his head and the memories she had erased began pouring back into the Evil God's mind.
<br><br>
A short while later, she withdrew the Kaleidoscopic Golden Dipper.
<br><br>
The Evil God stood motionless, digesting the memories. After a long while, he chuckled and said, "Interesting! It seems that my escape was unnecessary."
<br><br>
"What are you talking about?" Sienna asked, confused.
<br><br>
He then proceeded to tell her how he had escaped from Zen and the fight between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
A rare trace of caution crept into her after she heard this tale.
<br><br>
Although she was unable to return to the Source World, she knew its layout very well through the Black Ship.
<br><br>
The fact that the Sun Crow race had launched a decisive attack against the Oneness Sky Palace was a clear signal that the Element Spirit race might be planning another major move. Sienna felt she had to report this to her master.
<br><br>
Lofty Swords were inserted into the ground, emitting a different kind of imposing momentum.
<br><br>
The warriors of the Other Shore Realm, the Oneness Guards, the disciples of various sword sects, and the Oneness Generals from the twelve passes all gathered in front of the Oneness Array.
<br><br>
All from the Oneness Sky Palace had been quite pessimistic of their chances, sure that they would lose the battle.
<br><br>
No one had expected an end like that.
<br><br>
The warriors of the Other Shore Realm and the Oneness Guards all felt incredibly fortunate to have survived such a fierce battle.
<br><br>
Yet they still feared the members of the Sun Crow race, who were now on the right side of the Oneness Array, greatly.
<br><br>
"Have those members of the Sun Crow race really submitted to our Oneness Sky Palace after fighting us so viciously?"
<br><br>
This was inconceivable to some and they saw it as a joke.
<br><br>
"They do not obey the Oneness Sky Palace, but Zen instead!"
<br><br>
"Yes, Zen was once our Flag Master!"
<br><br>
Such an explanation still sounded unacceptable, but the fact was clear to their eyes.
<br><br>
Bagot sat upright beside Zen, his eyes closed and pondering.
<br><br>
He controlled millions of Sun Crows. They spread out blisteringly fast, searching every corner along the way.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Bagot had been maintaining this posture for a long time without any change. He had found nothing.
<br><br>
Elizabeth sneaked a peek at Zen from aside and was surprised to see that he looked distressed. She did not know he was capable of that.
<br><br>
She had known roughly the whole story.
<br><br>
The Evil God, who had been terribly arrogant in the Chaotic Source World, had been cultivated into an Inner-world Generating Avatar by Zen.
<br><br>
However, Zen hadn't erased his memories and so he escaped.
<br><br>
Deep down, Elizabeth could not help but admit that Zen was truly a freak.
<br><br>
Even a creature in his inner world possessed such incredible power. It would only take a little training for the Evil God to become one of the most influential figures on the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Pearce and Auden were very concerned about Zen as well.
<br><br>
Although they couldn't understand how important that "Inner-world Generating Avatar" was to Zen, they still sent their men to hunt down the Evil God.
<br><br>
Auden had brought the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards and many warriors of the Other Shore Realm back to the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
After searching for three days and nights, they had covered a considerable portion of the North Unicorn Province, but found nothing in the end.
<br><br>
"Just forget about it. Elder Pearce, let's head back to the North Mysterious City before we make a decision," Zen said politely.
<br><br>
He then asked Bagot to call the Sun Crows back and returned to the North Mysterious City together with the members of the Sun Crow race and the powerful warriors from the mountains.
<br><br>
As soon as they entered the North Mysterious City, something strange occurred in the sky. An enormous sun appeared, lighting the entire North Unicorn Province, making it clear and easy to see.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The huge sun shook for a moment and began splitting into two, three, four, five... Finally, nine suns floated in the sky! Elizabeth, Micah and other Sun Crows saw the nine suns and their faces went pale as a sheet.
<br><br>
"Nine-Sun World Destruction!"
<br><br>
"Is Emperor Charm here in person?"
<br><br>
"Does he wish to destroy the North Unicorn Province?"
<br><br>
Most of the members of the Sun Crow race behind Zen were the royal guards of Emperor Charm, and so they had no difficulty in recognizing the huge suns in the sky.
<br><br>
Even without a reminder from the Sun Crow race, others could still decipher what it was.
<br><br>
The temperature of the entire North Unicorn Province shot up when the nine suns appeared. Soon the water in the rivers and lakes began to boil and the mortals living in remote mountain areas died in an instant.
<br><br>
The ordinary mortals in the North Mysterious City had already retreated.
<br><br>
The weakest ones left were at the Other Shore Realm and able to bear such intense heat.
<br><br>
Even so, facing nine rapidly expanding suns still sent them into a panic.
<br><br>
Even Pearce and Auden were astonished at what took place before them, their most primal fears now coming to the surface.
<br><br>
During the war between the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace, the biggest crisis for the Oneness Sky Palace was not the Sun Crows advancing one step at a time, but the fact that Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin were trapped on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If Emperor Charm came in person, there was no one who could oppose him.
<br><br>
If this happened, the Oneness Sky Palace would have been defeated without a fight.
<br><br>
But the battle went on and Emperor Charm did not show up. Pearce began thinking he might never come and that they had had a stroke of good luck.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Zen had helped the Oneness Sky Palace get through this and buy them some time. Pearce hoped that Eastern Emperor Taiyi could manage to leave the Other Shore as soon as possible.
<br><br>
However, just as they returned, what had appeared in the sky shattered Pearce's hope.
<br><br>
"Everyone, go to the transmission array!"
<br><br>
"Retreat to the Bloom Divine Province!"
<br><br>
"..."
<br><br>
The entire North Mysterious City had broken out in an uproar and everyone rushed towards the transmission array.
<br><br>
As they did, the nine suns grew bigger and bigger, as if they were falling to the ground.
<br><br>
"Phew! Phew..."
<br><br>
All the flowers, plants and trees in the North Unicorn Province roasted and burned as the temperature continued to climb.
<br><br>
It was not so bad for the powerful warriors of the Chaotic Source Realm who could bear the scorching heat by way of their Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
But for ordinary warriors of the Other Shore Realm, it was horrific.
<br><br>
Some had their clothes ignited and instantly flashed into fire balls, screaming horrendously beneath the blazing infernos.
<br><br>
The transmission array in the North Mysterious City was not very large.
<br><br>
The warriors rushed towards it and gathered together, when the fire began rapidly spreading through them as well.
<br><br>
"Wow!"
<br><br>
Just then, a blue umbrella unfolded above the North Mysterious City, by a powerful warrior from the Bright Mountain.
<br><br>
The city began to cool as the umbrella temporarily kept the heat at bay.
<br><br>
Chapter 3660 Under The Scorching Suns The nine huge suns inflated like giant balloons of fire about to pop.
<br><br>
As the suns grew, the flowers and trees were scorched to ashes, while rocks and stones exploded like popcorn.
<br><br>
"Run!"
<br><br>
"Quick! Get to the transmission array, or we're dead!"
<br><br>
"You go first..."
<br><br>
Many Other Shore Realm warriors ran about like headless chickens in a panic.
<br><br>
Everyone tried to head for the transmission array. However, the array was so small that it could fit only around three people at a time. Moreover, it'd take a while to transmit those people.
<br><br>
The people huddled around the transmission array, anxious to get in.
<br><br>
"Fuck off!"
<br><br>
a five-star Oneness Guard roared.
<br><br>
Fighting for survival, the more powerful warriors sneered as they shoved the weaker ones out of the way.
<br><br>
The five-star Oneness Guard suddenly summoned his Other Shore Token, a huge white skull. It was the skull of the South Sky Rhinoceros in Stage Twelve of the Other Shore, the most powerful creature of that stage.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power contained in its skull was astonishingly formidable.
<br><br>
He trudged through the crowd, ominously clutching the skull of the South Sky Rhinoceros.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang, Bang..."
<br><br>
Suddenly, a throng of people were flung into the air, clearing a path for that five-star Oneness Guard.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to enter the transmission array, a beam of sword radiance as thin as thread wove its way through the crowd until it landed on the skull of the South Sky Rhinoceros.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
The five-star Oneness Guard abruptly stopped in his tracks, and his jaw dropped in shock. Then, his eyes rolled to the back of his head, and a wound as thin as a needle made its way from his forehead to his torso.
<br><br>
"Plop! Plop..."
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he had been split in half by the thin sword radiance.
<br><br>
"If you wish to enter the transmission array, line up obediently. Anyone who dares disobey will end up like that man."
<br><br>
A crisp voice cut through the air. The people turned towards the voice, only to find out it was none other than Libby.
<br><br>
Goran had ordered her to maintain order. As she surveyed the chaos that erupted, she said nothing more. She hadn't expected someone would use his Other Shore Token to hurt his companions! Her eyes narrowed as rage seethed within her.
<br><br>
If the people submitted to their panic, it was only a matter of time before everyone started using their Other Shore Tokens against each other.
<br><br>
In fact, Libby had already sensed the aura of many Other Shore Tokens being activated. If these people used their Other Shore Tokens, the transmission array was at risk of being destroyed. By then no one would be able to escape! Thus, Libby made the swift decision to kill that Oneness Guard.
<br><br>
Frowning deeply, Libby glared at the people.
<br><br>
They were all horrified with the scene before them.
<br><br>
Quietly, they put away their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
The once panicked, chaotic team gradually returned to their senses.
<br><br>
Libby was about to sigh with relief when suddenly something exploded in the sky.
<br><br>
"Crack!..."
<br><br>
A crack appeared on the icy blue umbrella.
<br><br>
The heat radiating from the rapidly growing nine suns seeped in from the crack. It seemed that the powerful warrior from the Bright Mountain could not hold out any longer, no matter how hard he tried.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
The crack started to snake its way across the surface of the umbrella, until a gap formed. From the gap, rays of light streamed in and landed on several Oneness Guards.
<br><br>
"Ah!!!"
<br><br>
Screams pierced the air as those unfortunate people exploded into a cloud of ashes under the heat of the sun rays.
<br><br>
As the others were horrified at this scene, panic welled within their hearts.
<br><br>
They had thought they could hold on a bit longer. However, when they saw these Oneness Guards die gruesomely, their hearts sank. It was only a matter of time before the umbrella collapsed completely.
<br><br>
Zen frowned and looked to the sky. It seemed nothing could block out these suns.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
Just as he was gazing at the sky, he noticed another crack forming. A small ray of light shone from the small crack. Like a divine sword descending from the sky, it swiftly made its way to the North Mysterious City. Then another round of screams pierced the atmosphere.
<br><br>
"Dodge quickly!"
<br><br>
"It's coming! It's coming!"
<br><br>
"The crack is spreading towards us..."
<br><br>
Zen turned towards the sound of someone screaming, only to find out it was actually Kenelm! Kenelm was nowhere near as strong as the other disciples of the Sword Light Palace.
<br><br>
Even with the resources of the Dragon City, he was still unable to reach the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Although the Oneness Sky Palace was in urgent need of extra hands, the True Gods not reaching the Other Shore Realm wouldn't be summoned.
<br><br>
Kenelm didn't even have the qualifications to enter the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
However, Kenelm was very faithful to his friends. He knew that the disciples of the Sword Light Palace might be in great danger or even die this time, so he followed Monica to the North Unicorn Province without hesitation.
<br><br>
Somehow, he had been surprisingly lucky. Even though he'd faced the Sun Crow race several times already, he never suffered any serious injuries.
<br><br>
However, it seemed as though his luck was running out. As the crack made its way across the umbrella, more rays of light streamed in, steadily closing in on Kenelm.
<br><br>
Kenelm shouted as he retreated, but no one was there to save him...
<br><br>
Kenelm ran as fast as he could, until his knees were about to buckle from under him. He almost fainted as the scorching wave charged toward him.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to give up, a huge shadow suddenly covered him. He looked back to see what it was, and to his relief, it was a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow! The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was made by Emperor Charm himself, and it was immune to water and fire. Even Elizabeth could not destroy it! "Rise!"
<br><br>
Zen barked. Under Zen's control, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow spread its wings and flew upwards, blocking the light that streamed in from the crack.
<br><br>
Kenelm's eyes stung as he looked at Zen gratefully, unable to fight back the tears.
<br><br>
He had met Zen back when he was in the Excellence City. At the time, he and Zen were both consummate True Gods, but now Zen was someone he looked up to. According to what Monica and Gant had said, Zen had even single-handedly reversed the situation of the war.
<br><br>
What did this mean? Only the powerful masters like Eastern Emperor Taiyi could do something like that...
<br><br>
Kenelm let out a sigh of relief. It was probably his greatest luck to have met Zen.
<br><br>
However, the worst wasn't over yet. More and more cracks formed on the umbrella. Zen continued to command other Corpse Spirit Sun Crows to rise.
<br><br>
Each of them spread out their wings that spanned thousands of feet to block the rays of light.
<br><br>
In a short while, over one hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows had flown up to cover the cracks.
<br><br>
The powerful warrior of the Bright Mountain was still struggling to hold on.
<br><br>
As he used up all his strength, his face grew paler and paler.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
As the nine suns grew to an overbearing size, the warrior cried desperately, "I can't hold on any longer!"
<br><br>
More cracks pierced the icy blue umbrella... In just a few moments, it was going to shatter into pieces.
<br><br>
"Let me do it!"
<br><br>
Felicity of the Origin Mountain flew towards him. As she stretched out her hands, an enchanted barrier flowed onto the umbrella, covering the entire North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
Chapter 3661 The Golden Bow There hadn't been any time to set up the arrays since the powerful warriors of the six mountains had just arrived in the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
Now, they could do nothing but resist the nine suns in turns.
<br><br>
However, as the nine suns continued to expand, the heat they released became even more unbearable for the warriors.
<br><br>
Felicity was far stronger than the powerful warrior of the Bright Mountain, but even she faced difficulty in sustaining the enchanted barrier.
<br><br>
Swish! The enchanted barrier that had just unfolded continued to twist and turn as it was brought to the brink of collapse.
<br><br>
A warrior from the Ivory Mountain rushed forward.
<br><br>
"Let me do it!" he declared before summoning a large, black, silk cloth.
<br><br>
This silk cloth was so big and so dark that it seemed to cover the entire sky and block out all the light.
<br><br>
However, he was only able to hold on for fifteen seconds before the cloth was set aflame.
<br><br>
There was no shortage of warriors who awaited their turn, but they were quickly running out of time.
<br><br>
Zen turned his attention to the transmission array. It hadn't transmitted away many people yet with the Sword Light Palace disciples still waiting in line on the west side of the road.
<br><br>
At this rate, only a third of the people in the North Mysterious City could be evacuated.
<br><br>
Just a few moments ago, the Oneness Generals had been calm. Though the nine suns were powerful, they were confident that they'd be able to withstand them.
<br><br>
Now, though, it was an entirely different story as even the Chaotic Source Realm warriors easily burnt to a crisp under the heat of these formidable nine suns.
<br><br>
Retreat seemed to be the logical option and that was only possible through the transmission array.
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm!" Zen called out in desperation. "Is there any way to solve the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy?!"
<br><br>
As the emperor of the Sun Crow race, Emperor Charm was bound to know the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy best.
<br><br>
His shadow appeared and stared up at the nine suns in the sky.
<br><br>
A flash of nostalgia crossed his features. "Of course there's a way," he told Zen. "But I'm afraid you can't use it."
<br><br>
"It'll be okay if someone else can use it!" Zen assured him. If it was a matter of strength, then that wasn't going to be a problem! There were multiple mountain leaders present as well as elite warriors like Pearce and Auden.
<br><br>
However, Emperor Charm shook his head.
<br><br>
"They can't either."
<br><br>
His words made Zen freeze.
<br><br>
He himself wasn't afraid of the burning flames, but the Other Shore Realm warriors were different.
<br><br>
Zen met eyes with Monica as he swept his gaze across the area.
<br><br>
She knew he was busy, so she only forced him a smile, a silent plea to get through this hurdle with everyone.
<br><br>
To her, hope remained so long as Zen was here with them in this distressful situation.
<br><br>
He reversed the entire battle situation with just his strength, so what more were a few blazing suns? It wasn't just Monica. Everyone here who had followed Zen before, had unconditional confidence in him. It was because of this blind trust that Monica, Gant, and the Sword Light Palace disciples remained calm despite everything.
<br><br>
"Is there really no other way?" Zen asked. So many people were relying on him. There must be a way.
<br><br>
"Of course there's a way, but you should not ask me for that way," Emperor Charm exclaimed with a hint of disgust.
<br><br>
"Then who should I ask?!" Zen raised his eyebrows at Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"Should I ask the Primeval Lord of Heaven?!" Emperor Charm was an immense help to Zen during the battle with the Sun Crow race, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven remained to be the strongest master in the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
However, Emperor Charm shook his head.
<br><br>
"No. It's Houyi."
<br><br>
(*TN: In Chinese mythology, Houyi, whose prowess with a bow earned him undying fame, is said to have shot down 9 of 10 suns (one account says 8 of 9 suns) that were burning up the earth in prehistoric times. ) "Houyi?" Zen repeated. He had seen him in the temple. Houyi was a powerful man who had shot countless stars down with his bow.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm nodded though his expression made it known that he had a bit of doubt. "He once used his magical Sun Shooting Bow to break my Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy..."
<br><br>
A faint trace of hatred was present in his voice when he spoke of the tale.
<br><br>
It seemed there was a feud between Emperor Charm and Houyi.
<br><br>
That feud would have to be set aside for now since lives were currently at stake. People couldn't die just because of what had happened more than a thousand chaotic eras ago.
<br><br>
All Zen wanted to deal with right now were the nine suns in the sky. He communicated with the Primeval Lord of Heaven who thought highly of Houyi and summoned him out of the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The shadow of a long-haired man rose above Zen's head. If one looked at Zen right now, they would see two human heads floating above him, painting a rather peculiar sight. Of course, due to the current situation, nobody really paid attention to anyone else.
<br><br>
"Oh! Nine suns!" Houyi remarked happily as he looked at the blazing suns in the sky.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm replied to his cheerful remark with a ferocious glare. The anger was obvious with the way his eyes twitched.
<br><br>
In the 77th civilization, Emperor Charm had once been invincible.
<br><br>
His Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy had been extremely influential since it was his key weapon in winning all his battles, until he met Houyi, of course.
<br><br>
It remained Emperor Charm's greatest shame.
<br><br>
"Master Houyi, I would like to know if you have any way of dealing with the suns?" Zen inquired respectfully.
<br><br>
It wasn't difficult asking help from these old masters. The moment they acknowledged Zen, their fates had already been connected.
<br><br>
Houyi chuckled good-naturedly. "That's easy, especially since the Nine Sun World Destruction Theurgy is far weaker than what it used to be."
<br><br>
"It's not weaker," Emperor Charm muttered. "But you are weaker now.
<br><br>
There's no way this is going to be easy."
<br><br>
The nine constantly expanding suns before them were definitely not weaker than the ones Emperor Charm once summoned, and Houyi didn't appear personally. He was just an energy soul attached to the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
However, Houyi retained his confidence. "You're not afraid of fire, are you, Zen?"
<br><br>
"I'm not, but I'm wary since the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy might be too powerful for me to bear," Zen replied.
<br><br>
Houyi stretched out his hand and gave it a gentle wave. Zen felt the Civilization Artifact within his body fluctuate before a golden bow materialized before him. "It's going to be a bit troublesome. My real body cannot come, but I can give you a theurgy. Your strength won't be enough to extinguish the suns from here though. You'll have to get close."
<br><br>
"Get close to them..." Zen repeated.
<br><br>
He was very confident in his corporeal body and had never been hurt by any flame. However, these nine suns were no ordinary globes of fire.
<br><br>
These nine suns were Emperor Charm's great theurgy and were entirely different from ordinary divine flame of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Any hesitation disappeared from Zen's face as he strengthened his resolve.
<br><br>
"I'll go!" he declared with determination.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
He used the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow as a boost and flew straight into the sky.
<br><br>
The sight earned him puzzled looks from onlookers. "What are you doing, Zen?" Pearce asked.
<br><br>
"I'm going to extinguish those suns," Zen casually replied.
<br><br>
"You?"
<br><br>
There were many powerful warriors from the mountains, yet here was Zen braving the heat and declaring that he was going to extinguish the nine suns that gave them so much trouble.
<br><br>
They knew Zen wasn't afraid of the Sun Crow race's divine flame, but that didn't mean he was invincible against the suns. This theurgy was Emperor Charm's, after all.
<br><br>
Chapter 3662 No Way Back Elizabeth along with the rest of the Sun Crow race stood by and watched Zen soar into the air, without a word.
<br><br>
On the one hand, they hoped Zen would finally perish this way, but on the other, they still worried about him almost instinctively.
<br><br>
The common contradicting feelings left them in an uncomfortable position.
<br><br>
Swish! The moment Zen left the enchanted barrier, his physical body turned blazing white. He could barely open his eyes in the strong light.
<br><br>
Buzz! Sanskrit words began appearing on his body, spinning ceaselessly and frantically absorbing the heat.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was normally immune to water and fire, but after it reached ten thousand feet outside the barrier, its feathers started burning.
<br><br>
"How powerful these flames are!" Zen exclaimed in awe.
<br><br>
He didn't know what kind of method Emperor Charm used to create the crow beneath him. Its defensive power was extremely astonishing. Even if the members of the Sun Crow race were highly powerful, they couldn't burn the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, nor could they tear it apart by trapping it in fire.
<br><br>
But as it approached ten thousand feet high in the air, its feathers were already burnt. Zen wondered how terrifying the suns' temperature was.
<br><br>
He wasn't certain if he could withstand it himself.
<br><br>
But at this point, there was no way back.
<br><br>
On the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, Zen stood upright, his eyes flashing with determination as the crow then rapidly sped up.
<br><br>
The nine suns were still in the midst of expanding, slowly moving south.
<br><br>
They were no doubt about to pour all their heat into the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
As Zen continued to rise, the temperature rose along with him.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! The surface of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow beneath Zen's feet was crackling from burning.
<br><br>
The bones of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow turned to ashes.
<br><br>
Once the bones of the wings exploded, the rest of the crow was completely destroyed.
<br><br>
In another bursting sound, the creature collapsed, falling to the ground.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen merely took a step and flew upward on his own.
<br><br>
"Is this distance enough?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
He had already risen to about eighty thousand feet in the air, with the nine suns like white mountains above his head. While they appeared close because of the sheer size, there was still a considerable distance until Zen reached them.
<br><br>
"Not enough," Houyi said plainly.
<br><br>
Frowning, Zen continued moving upward.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The golden whirlpools continued circling, sucking in the heat. On the surface of Zen's body, they seemed like little monsters devouring flames like food.
<br><br>
Finding no damage done to his physical body, Zen sighed in relief.
<br><br>
If even the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy couldn't burn him to death, there was unlikely any fire in the world that could touch him.
<br><br>
As Zen continued rising rapidly, something sour was unfolding in the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
Many powerful warriors began taking turns activating the enchanted barrier to resist the scorching suns. But even as they did all they could, the time they managed to maintain the barrier was only lessening.
<br><br>
Despair spread throughout the city.
<br><br>
The Oneness Guards, the Other Shore Realm warriors, and a great number of Oneness Generals were all losing hope. Even the Chaotic Source Realm warriors couldn't hold on for much longer. Once the enchanted barrier was destroyed, they'd die along with it.
<br><br>
Above the transmission array stood Libby, holding a thin sword in her hand.
<br><br>
Her bright eyes looked around vigilantly, examining her surroundings.
<br><br>
Previously, she managed to quell the turmoil in the city and stabilize its situation by killing a warrior as a warning to the rest.
<br><br>
But as the enchanted barrier above the city continued deteriorating, everyone could feel how critical the situation was getting. It was likely that the mountain masters were to fall any minute, leaving everyone else to burn as the city was burned to ashes.
<br><br>
"I have to go ahead!"
<br><br>
an Oneness General guarding an area nearby roared and shot toward the transmission array like an arrow.
<br><br>
The rest of the Oneness Generals had the same thought, following suit and going for the array.
<br><br>
"Get out of my way!"
<br><br>
In the lead, the Oneness General dashed forward and punched the air before the transmission array.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
In terms of strength, the Oneness General was far superior to the Other Shore Realm warriors. In a single punch, the wave of impact sent the people near the transmission array flying out.
<br><br>
"How dare you!"
<br><br>
Libby felt her brows raise at the scene, slashing at the Oneness General's head with her thin sword, triggering the sword's radiance to shoot out.
<br><br>
Among the many Oneness Generals, that man was the best. While he was once on the second floor of the Land of Sword Grief like many, his current strength was enough to allow him to enter the third floor. He didn't even bother dodging Libby's attack, as he knew it wasn't at full power. Instead, he reached out to block it.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, a black shield appeared in his grasp. Libby's sword radiance was blocked with a clatter against the shield.
<br><br>
Frustrated, Libby turned over and continued relentlessly stabbing her sword at the Oneness General.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
The dense rays of sword radiance pierced toward her opponent like a series of violent winds and rain, but the Oneness General had no trouble raising his defense and easily blocking the attacks with his shield.
<br><br>
But Libby's full strength was still greater than that of the Oneness General.
<br><br>
As more and more long and thin rays of sword radiance approached, the Oneness General still had to take a few steps back. As a result, the distance between him and the transmission array was growing wider.
<br><br>
In the battle against the Sun Crow race, the Oneness General had proven to be truly brave and courageous. When he guarded the North Pool Pass, never had he taken a step back. However, his current situation left him with nearly no chance to escape. Libby's sword attacks forced him back quite a bit, making him grow even more indignant.
<br><br>
"If you won't let me live, everyone else must die!"
<br><br>
the Oneness General roared as he burned the black shield in his grip.
<br><br>
His face twisted in extreme pain, and the black shield turned into dark fragments, merging into his fist.
<br><br>
With a sudden wave of his hand, he smashed his fist into the transmission array.
<br><br>
The sight had Libby shocked. The Oneness General was by no means inferior to her in status, so she had no intention to kill him. All she did was to force him back—never did she expect him to go to such extremes and fight for his life.
<br><br>
Once the Other Shore Token was burnt, the power of the punch was truly formidable. Even Libby, who was undoubtedly powerful, couldn't withstand its force head-on.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Along with a great rumble, the transmission array had been smashed into pieces, and the many Other Shore Realm warriors who were lining up were affected.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the masters of the mountains had their attention fixed on the suns in the sky. They were all racking their brains, trying to figure out a way to buy some time and open up enchanted barriers to allow the others to retreat. Even the Sun Crow race was helping them out.
<br><br>
The loud rumble drew everyone's attention. Even the mountain leaders were shocked upon witnessing the scene.
<br><br>
A considerable distance stood between the North Mysterious City and the border of the North Unicorn Province. Even if a mountain leader used the Grand Teleportation technique, jumping back to the Bloom Divine Province in a single move was still impossible.
<br><br>
The transmission array remained the only means to leave the North Unicorn Province. No one expected it to be destroyed so suddenly. Now they lost their only way to retreat.
<br><br>
Chapter 3663 A Simple Shoot Naturally, Zen didn't know that such a change had happened in the North Mysterious City. As he continued to fly upward, the closer he got to one of the suns.
<br><br>
At that moment, the huge ball of light above his head formed a strange reverse vortex of flames, as if the flames spurted out from it.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the situation in his body was different.
<br><br>
All the vortexes spun around and continuously absorbed the flames that came to his body.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the huge vortex before him and the small vortexes on his body, lost in thought. "Did those flames in the sun really come from Emperor Charm? Or did they come from somewhere else?" he asked.
<br><br>
After all, he felt that the flames in the sun seemed to be from another space, while the vortexes in his body had pulled the flames into another space.
<br><br>
Although neither his physical body nor the huge vortex in the sun had any spatial fluctuations, his sixth sense told him that it should be the case.
<br><br>
Upon hearing Zen's question, Houyi and Emperor Charm glanced at each other and silently exchanged surprised looks.
<br><br>
"The Nine-Sun World Destruction is my bloodline theurgy. How could it come from somewhere else?" Emperor Charm said with a grin.
<br><br>
The sun continued to expand as Zen looked at it in confusion. "It seems so, but it looks like the flames in the vortex are extracted from another place."
<br><br>
"Don't they come from the Other Shore?" Houyi asked jokingly. However, Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
"I don't think so. It doesn't contain any Other Shore Power," he said.
<br><br>
Zen's answer pleased Emperor Charm, who praised, "What a keen intuition! I remember that it had taken the Primeval Lord of Heaven dozens of chaotic eras to realize this."
<br><br>
"This? What do you mean by this?" Zen asked confusedly.
<br><br>
"The energy in the chaos doesn't come from it," answered Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"The energy in the chaos doesn't come from it…" Zen muttered to himself.
<br><br>
He still found it hard to understand. "How is that possible? Do you mean that all of our power comes from outside of the chaos?" he asked again.
<br><br>
"Yes," Emperor Charm confirmed.
<br><br>
"But I wasn't able to see this before."
<br><br>
"Because the level of energy is usually not high enough. If an energy has reached the level of the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy, then you'll be able to see it. That is why you can feel that the sun rotates," Emperor Charm explained.
<br><br>
The energy that the mortals used to ignite a torch or the energy that warriors at the Other Shore Realm used to smash the mountains was related to the outside of the chaos, but those energies' level was still too low to be noticeable. However, when an energy's level had reached a certain point, the things that people could see would be different. It turned out that only after the qualitative change transpired could some things be visible.
<br><br>
"The level..."
<br><br>
At that point, Zen felt that Emperor Charm's explanation finally made sense. He did notice that feeling he mentioned just now! But what about his physical body? His physical body didn't release energy, but rather devoured energy. How could that be explained? What he didn't know was that the Primeval Lord of Heaven was already considered an extraordinary talent because he had made such a hypothesis.
<br><br>
It was even more impressive because at that time, he knew almost nothing about the chaos. He was like an ant that tried to calculate the height of the sky, but surprisingly, what happened later proved that he was right.
<br><br>
That was also the reason why many human masters were willing to follow him.
<br><br>
The discussion stopped while Zen had gotten quite close to the first sun.
<br><br>
The golden Sun Shooting Bow on his shoulder let out a series of sounds. It seemed to have its own consciousness and became excited.
<br><br>
Although Houyi was the one who gave the Sun Shooting Bow, the bow was actually a part of the Civilization Artifact. Just like the Wing King's cyan feather, it was an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
A second later, Zen pulled the longbow, clasped the string with one hand, and then skillfully drew it.
<br><br>
Crack! He slid his fingers to the side, but did not pull back the thin bowstring.
<br><br>
If it wasn't for the Chaotic Source Spirits' protection, the bowstring would've cut his fingers already.
<br><br>
"Why couldn't I draw the bow?" he asked curiously. Houyi chuckled beside him.
<br><br>
"You can't just casually draw the bow with only your strength!" he said.
<br><br>
"Then what should I do?" asked Zen. "Try again," Houyi answered.
<br><br>
When Zen drew the bow once again, Houyi mumbled something.
<br><br>
Suddenly, streaks of golden light bloomed from his shadow and turned into a mark, which then imprinted itself on Zen's body.
<br><br>
Buzz! The mark disappeared. As soon as it was gone, Zen drew the bowstring for half a foot, but he couldn't draw it again after that.
<br><br>
Then, Houyi recited the invocation once more. It seemed that the invocation was inherited from the 77th chaos, and each word from it was full of power.
<br><br>
Buzz! The golden mark enveloped Zen and disappeared again. When the golden mark vanished, the golden bow in his hand was pulled back a distance of another half a foot.
<br><br>
The process repeated six times.
<br><br>
Finally, the Sun Shooting Bow was fully stretched.
<br><br>
Next, Zen aimed at the huge sun not far away.
<br><br>
However, it appeared that he didn't need to aim at it in such an angle. "Just release the bowstring?" he asked.
<br><br>
Some powerful bows didn't need to be equipped with arrows, as the arrows would be condensed in the void.
<br><br>
"I forgot to give you the Sun Extinguishing Arrow!" Houyi exclaimed and slapped his forehead.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the corners of Emperor Charm's eyes twitched slightly. He always felt that to lose to an idiot like Houyi was unforgivable.
<br><br>
Even Zen looked quite helpless, but there was nothing he could do since Houyi was a human master.
<br><br>
Houyi stretched out his hand and gently waved the Sun Shooting Bow.
<br><br>
Then, a golden arrow materialized in front of them.
<br><br>
Afterwards, Zen drew the bow and the arrow was in place. He no longer hesitated.
<br><br>
Pop! The Sun Extinguishing Arrow was shot towards the vortex! The Sun Extinguishing Arrow was completely different from what he had imagined. It didn't have the power to destroy the heaven and earth.
<br><br>
It was like a rather ordinary arrow, and its speed wasn't even fast enough when he shot it. "Can the Sun Extinguishing Arrow really destroy the sun?"
<br><br>
he asked doubtfully.
<br><br>
Houyi looked at him smugly. Before he could answer, Emperor Charm interjected and said, "Of course it can. It doesn't destroy the sun with greater power, but instead extinguishes it."
<br><br>
According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven's theory, the energy within the chaos did not come from the chaos, but from somewhere else.
<br><br>
The suns' energy was the same.
<br><br>
Now, Houyi's Sun Extinguishing Arrow was considered powerful because it severed the connection between two places and cut off the energy supply.
<br><br>
As a result, Emperor Charm's theurgy was restrained.
<br><br>
Truth be told, Houyi's strength back then was far inferior to Emperor Charm's, but Emperor Charm couldn't do anything to him.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The Sun Extinguishing Arrow slowly flew to the center of the sun.
<br><br>
Just then, a small black dot appeared.
<br><br>
The small dot quickly spread out and spun within the vortex in the sun.
<br><br>
A few moments later, the sun was extinguished.
<br><br>
Chapter 3664 Witnessing With no loud sounds heralding its destruction, the sun simply and quietly disappeared from Zen's field of vision.
<br><br>
"Did I just shoot down a sun?" Zen asked in shock, dazedly holding the Sun Shooting Bow.
<br><br>
Houyi chided him, "What's the big deal? Should I set off some fireworks for celebration?"
<br><br>
Zen looked at Houyi and rolled his eyes.
<br><br>
It didn't matter how it happened; what was clear was that the Sun Shooting Bow could definitely help destroy a sun.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help thinking of the masters in the North Mysterious City and how long they could still hold on. His most important task right now was to shoot down and destroy the remaining suns.
<br><br>
He put away the golden bow and directly flew towards the next nearest sun.
<br><br>
A hundred provinces from where Zen had been located Smack dab in the center of that province, there was a huge abyss. At the bottom of this abyss, there stood several people.
<br><br>
There was a huge crack in front of them.
<br><br>
The crack looked very strange, as if it was embedded in the stone wall and parallel to the space.
<br><br>
A burly man stood on the abyss floor beside the crack. It was Mount who had fought with Zen in the past.
<br><br>
"I'll go in now," Mount uttered, cupping his hands towards the other people.
<br><br>
The man who stood closer to Mount smiled faintly. "Do you have any hesitation with integrating yourself with it like this?"
<br><br>
Mount mastered his expression to stay calm. "We are from the same origin.
<br><br>
After I merge with it, what you will see may be either me or it. I have nothing to lose, so why should I hesitate?"
<br><br>
The man nodded and said, "Go ahead."
<br><br>
Mount stepped towards the crack.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, his entire body had been covered by countless mirror-like shards of space that turned him into many smaller pieces.
<br><br>
The fragments did not really tear Mount apart, so they did not trigger the Chaotic Source Spirits within his body. Countless shards reflected back a complete image of Mount stepping into the crack.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
The moment that Mount's fragments disappeared into the crack, a gigantic eye peered out of it.
<br><br>
The crack was more than 40 million feet deep and 3 million feet wide; but when the eye appeared, only a small portion of it was visible.
<br><br>
Those people who had been standing in front of the crack were all top masters in the Source World, but they still got nervous under the creepy gaze of the eye. They only breathed a sigh of relief when the eye disappeared.
<br><br>
These people were top masters from the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race.
<br><br>
Standing in front of the group was a man wearing a black coat made of feathers and with sharp eyes. He was the Yellow Thearch, leader of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"Can you make sure that there would be no accident this time?" the Yellow Thearch asked.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer, who stood just beside him, gave a slight nod as affirmation.
<br><br>
"There would be no hitches regarding our plans, but..."
<br><br>
He trailed off as he glanced at Emperor Charm a small distance away.
<br><br>
There was a condition that needed to be fulfilled before these plans could take shape, and that was the great descending.
<br><br>
Even though the group had already obtained half the number of Descending Rings, the great descending hadn't succeeded yet.
<br><br>
After deduction, they fixed their sights on the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's hands. Perhaps if they took those spirits, they might succeed.
<br><br>
They had already planned to obliterate the Oneness Sky Palace first and because of Zen, they started the war ahead of schedule.
<br><br>
It should have been easy work for the Sun Crow race to destroy the Oneness Sky Palace after they had had Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi trapped on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, the news that was brought back by Emperor Charm did not bring good tidings.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm enveloped himself inside a fluffy white fur robe, his delicate face framed by the immaculately white fur. His eyes flashed fiercely as he said, "All the surviving fighting forces of the Oneness Sky Palace are still in the North Unicorn Province. With the Nine-Sun World Destruction, I will decimate the North Unicorn Province and also obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits myself."
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's handsome visage was unperturbed on the surface, but his anger was raging inside his heart.
<br><br>
Although he was only a direct clone of the real Emperor Charm, his bloodline, strength, and mood were almost the same as that of the real Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
The possibility that the Sun Crow race could be defeated had never entered his mind.
<br><br>
Moreover, they were captured by the Oneness Sky Palace in an extremely humiliating way! Exploding in a fit of fury, Emperor Charm had no choice but to finally use the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy.
<br><br>
Every time the Sun Crow race invaded a province, he would mark that province with nine seals made of his bloodline. Then he could use them to deploy the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy regardless of distance.
<br><br>
This would be his last resort. He had never thought that the time would come that he needed to use this theurgy.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
As soon as Emperor Charm finished speaking, he suddenly opened his eyes with a piercing look and knitted eyebrows.
<br><br>
"What's wrong, Emperor Charm? Did someone destroy your Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy?" Divine Farmer smirked.
<br><br>
His question was made in jest.
<br><br>
None could dodge their doom once Emperor Charm activated this theurgy, not to mention that the Oneness Sky Palace was short of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin. Even if they faced that theurgy, they could only run away with their subordinates.
<br><br>
"One sun has been extinguished," Emperor Charm muttered in disbelief.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch, who was standing close to him, snapped his head towards him when he heard this. Surprise was written all over his features.
<br><br>
"How is that possible?"
<br><br>
"It has been really extinguished. I'll take a closer look," Emperor Charm said as he waved his fingers in front of him. His eyes glowed with a blazing white light while he saw the world that had been burnt by the scorching suns in his mind.
<br><br>
His vision of the world slowly came into focus and he looked around.
<br><br>
Shortly after, he saw Zen flying through the air.
<br><br>
Zen was flying directly towards the second sun, clutching a golden bow in his hand.
<br><br>
An idea came to Emperor Charm's mind. It was so absurd it seemed impossible...
<br><br>
'Did this runty brat extinguish one of the suns?' Just as Emperor Charm was ruminating about this possibility, Zen aimed the bow and pulled the string taut. Golden marks appeared on both his body and the bow, then he let the arrow loose.
<br><br>
Whoosh! That arrow's power seemed ridiculously feeble in Emperor Charm's eyes.
<br><br>
It flew towards the center of the sun, seemingly in slow motion, before it turned into a tiny black ball that expanded before dissipating.
<br><br>
The huge sun also disappeared.
<br><br>
'What is it?' Emperor Charm's eyes twitched as if he had witnessed the most unbelievable scenario he had ever seen in his life.
<br><br>
"How did it go out, dude?"
<br><br>
The interest of the two strongest warriors, Divine Farmer and the Yellow Thearch, were extremely piqued.
<br><br>
With an irritated snort and a wave of two of his fingers in the air, Emperor Charm conjured a space in front of them that reflected Zen's figure as he pulled the long bow taut.
<br><br>
"Isn't he the guy with the Soaring Snake Sword?" the Yellow Thearch asked.
<br><br>
"It's him," Divine Farmer confirmed.
<br><br>
After the battle of the Chaotic Source World, Zen had attracted the attention of these beings.
<br><br>
However, they had not seen Zen go to any significant place except wander around the Other Shore. A number of super forces had already hatched some plans to kill him, but no one could follow his tracks at all.
<br><br>
They had planned to kill Zen and Elvinia on the Other Shore, but instead, it was their stage ruler who had been killed by them. Not a hair on their head had been harmed.
<br><br>
"He isn't afraid of the scorching suns?" Divine Farmer asked innocently. He thought this was what Emperor Charm wanted them to see.
<br><br>
"No, he has destroyed my two suns," said Emperor Charm, a finger pointed accusingly at Zen's figure.
<br><br>
Right at that moment, Zen pulled his long bow again, already aiming at the third sun.
<br><br>
Chapter 3665 The Hope Buzz! As a series of marks enveloped Zen, he pulled back the string of the Sun Shooting Bow once more.
<br><br>
Aiming carefully, he released the string. The seemingly ordinary arrow slowly shot towards the center of the sun.
<br><br>
In a flash of black light, the huge sun suddenly went out.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer, Yellow Thearch, and other powerful warriors all watched quietly. Despite their calm expressions, there was a trace of shock in their eyes.
<br><br>
It was not that they were surprised that an entire sun had been destroyed almost effortlessly. After all, with their experience, they had seen all kinds of things.
<br><br>
Even if dozens of provinces were destroyed right in front of them, they wouldn't have batted an eyelash.
<br><br>
However, it was Zen's method of shooting the sun that unsettled them.
<br><br>
"Is it an Other Shore Token?" Divine Farmer asked, his eyes narrowing.
<br><br>
"It must be," answered Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch shook his head. "The Other Shore Token that can shoot the suns with arrows doesn't exist below the Three Purities Stage. Moreover, he can't possibly be carrying any Other Shore Token from the Three Purities Stage."
<br><br>
Several masters behind Yellow Thearch nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
While they all might have seen some extraordinary things in their time, there were indeed still many mysteries in this world.
<br><br>
The powerhouses present, however, were at the top of the Source World and the Other Shore.
<br><br>
There weren't many things that could shock them, and yet...
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
Just as the many powerful warriors were deep in thought, suddenly, the eye appeared once more in the huge crack beside them.
<br><br>
It seemed the eye was also taking in the scene that was transmitted by Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"Goo..."
<br><br>
"He can do it. He can see it. It's the space outside the space..."
<br><br>
The voice thundered from the crack, ringing in everyone's ears.
<br><br>
As the Chaos Ancient God in charge of space, he boasted of the keenest sense of space in the entire Source World. Having watched this scene unfold right before him, he felt somewhat unsettled.
<br><br>
"What's the space outside the space?" Yellow Thearch asked.
<br><br>
The huge eye in the crack paused for a moment before answering, "I don't know. It's another kind of space rule, surpassing the space truth."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"Surpass the truth?"
<br><br>
"Is there anything in this world that surpasses the truth?"
<br><br>
The several masters behind Yellow Thearch whispered amongst themselves anxiously.
<br><br>
However, Emperor Charm, Divine Farmer, and the leader of the New Moon race still kept their composure.
<br><br>
After they decided to follow the Element Spirit race, the latter had revealed some very special information about the origin of the chaos.
<br><br>
Without a doubt, truth was an unbreakable rule in this world. However, it was possible something out there was even more powerful than truth.
<br><br>
"This man must die," Emperor Charm said quietly, as he stared at Zen on the screen.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer stared at Yellow Thearch and said, "Your Bearing race and the Sun Crow race are attacking the Oneness Sky Palace together this time.
<br><br>
Can you order your people to capture Zen?"
<br><br>
When they planned to destroy the Oneness Sky Palace, their original goal was to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, whereas capturing Zen was only a second priority.
<br><br>
But now that Divine Farmer realized how dangerous Zen truly was, he felt that capturing him should be of utmost priority.
<br><br>
Zen's ability was so strange that he couldn't even begin to comprehend it.
<br><br>
"My people are trying to enter the Bloom Divine Province from the other side. I'm afraid they are busy breaking the arrays now," Yellow Thearch said with a frown. "At this point, it won't be easy to capture Zen."
<br><br>
Emperor Charm turned to look at the huge sun and pursed his lips. His eyes flashed coldly. "I have a simple solution. I'll go there myself."
<br><br>
The members of the Sun Crow race were interconnected, and they could easily sense each other's existence. As the king of the Sun Crow race, Emperor Charm had the sharpest senses.
<br><br>
He could clearly feel the existence of Elizabeth, Micah, Bagot and others.
<br><br>
They were still alive, but he could tell that there was something strange going on with them.
<br><br>
Without hesitating, Emperor Charm spread his massive wings.
<br><br>
The surrounding space formed tiny grids, and he left the abyss at an extremely fast speed.
<br><br>
Ever since the transmission array was destroyed, chaos erupted in the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
Although many powerful warriors were still trying their best to build the enchanted barriers, feelings of desperation and helplessness hung in the air.
<br><br>
Everyone was keenly aware that they were about to be burned to death. It was only a matter of time.
<br><br>
Looking at the blazing white sky, Auden frowned deeply. Turning to Elizabeth, he asked, "I know that your Sun Crow race isn't just good with flames, but also has an affinity with space." Pausing for a moment, he continued, "Can you create a space to avoid all this?"
<br><br>
While they had submitted to the Emperor Charm in Zen's body, they still felt quite hostile towards the humans.
<br><br>
However, since this was a matter of life and death for everyone, the Sun Crow race had decided to join forces with them. They were either activating the enchanted barriers, or at the very least, helping stabilize them.
<br><br>
"It's useless." Elizabeth shook her head. "When the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy is activated, everything in the province, including the space, will be destroyed."
<br><br>
As she spoke, she pointed towards the sky.
<br><br>
While ordinary people could only see the sky as a blinding, blazing white light, Elizabeth and Auden could see cracks forming.
<br><br>
It seemed the flames were so powerful that they burned even space itself.
<br><br>
Auden's frown deepened. Was there really no way out? "Don't you still have that man?" Elizabeth said sarcastically.
<br><br>
After saying this, she suddenly felt a chill run down her spine. It seemed her instincts were telling her to not speak ill of "that man".
<br><br>
"You mean Zen?" Auden smiled bitterly. "While he has indeed created many miracles, he can't solve every problem. It'd be wishful thinking to expect such a junior to deactivate Emperor Charm's Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy..."
<br><br>
However, before he was even able to finish speaking, the blazing white light in the sky suddenly dimmed.
<br><br>
All the people in the North Mysterious City turned to look towards the sky.
<br><br>
Although the sky was still blazing white, they noticed one out of the nine suns was missing.
<br><br>
Elizabeth's eyes widened. She scanned the atmosphere, thinking the ninth sun had probably shifted its position.
<br><br>
Auden too stared at the sky. Just like Elizabeth, he had guessed that one sun had ended up blocking the other. Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined someone had shot it down.
<br><br>
As they both scanned the sky intently, the sky darkened even more, and another sun disappeared.
<br><br>
"The suns are being extinguished!"
<br><br>
someone shouted. Auden pursed his lips dubiously.
<br><br>
"Yes, two of them were extinguished!"
<br><br>
"There is hope. We must hold on. The suns will definitely be extinguished!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Two suns had disappeared. While they didn't know how or why, finally, the people in the North Mysterious City felt a surge of hope.
<br><br>
Chapter 3666 Distress Signal At that moment, everyone's eyes were on the blazing sky.
<br><br>
The strong light almost blinded their eyes, especially those of the weak Other Shore Realm warriors.
<br><br>
However, none of them wanted to lower their heads. After all, whatever happened in the sky was their only hope of living.
<br><br>
Everyone held their breaths as they carefully watched every movement in the sky, their instinct to survive fueling their attentiveness.
<br><br>
After a while, the third sun was gone from everyone's sight.
<br><br>
"Wow..."
<br><br>
The whole North Mysterious City was in an uproar again.
<br><br>
"Maybe Emperor Charm let us off?"
<br><br>
"It should be! But why did he do that?"
<br><br>
"Because we've captured the Sun Crows?"
<br><br>
The air was filled with chatter as many of them began to guess why.
<br><br>
They didn't know how Zen had managed to capture the members of the Sun Crow race, but the Sun Crows obeyed him. Thus, it was no surprise that they considered them as "prisoners".
<br><br>
There were some people who thought that it was Emperor Charm who had shown mercy.
<br><br>
On the other hand, some had different opinions.
<br><br>
"Is it possible that Zen has done something to destroy the suns?"
<br><br>
"I saw him leave the North Mysterious City and fly towards the suns..."
<br><br>
"It is impossible! Zen is indeed powerful, but he's only an ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warrior. He's only on the same level as the Oneness Generals.
<br><br>
If even the mountain leaders can't do anything about those suns, then how could he destroy them?"
<br><br>
Although many people had seen Zen fly towards the suns, most of them didn't actually think that he could deal with them.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Jago said, "I believe it is Flag Master who has destroyed the suns."
<br><br>
"I believe the same too!" Kenelm agreed. Meanwhile, Monica looked up at the blazing white sky, her eyes filled with mixed emotions.
<br><br>
"If there is really someone who could create such a miracle, then it must be Zen!" she whispered.
<br><br>
"Buzz…"
<br><br>
At that point, another sun had vanished from the sky. The one who had destroyed them had now eliminated the fourth sun.
<br><br>
As the suns disappeared one by one, there was less pressure on the masters who used the enchanted barriers.
<br><br>
Originally, after an enchanted barrier was built, it would only last for a few seconds. Now, it lasted more than a minute. The others took turns to maintain the barrier more easily, and therefore they had time to replenish some divine crystals.
<br><br>
In that way, they could use the enchanted barriers to keep the people in the North Mysterious City alive.
<br><br>
The sixth sun...
<br><br>
The seventh one...
<br><br>
The eighth one...
<br><br>
The ninth one...
<br><br>
The blazing white light eventually got dim as more and more suns were gone. When the last sun was extinguished, the North Unicorn Province returned to its normal state.
<br><br>
At the same time, everyone saw a black dot glow in the sky. It was the same black light that appeared when a sun had vanished. There had been the black light before, but the light from the other suns had covered it.
<br><br>
As the black dot flickered, the people in the North Mysterious City also saw a figure as big as an ant that floated in the sky.
<br><br>
"Someone is there!"
<br><br>
"Who is there?"
<br><br>
"This person was beside the suns while the suns were destroyed. Was he the one who extinguished them?"
<br><br>
The people in the North Mysterious City became excited again, and some of them stared straight at the figure with their eyes wide open.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Auden, Pearce, and the leaders of the Ivory Mountain, Golden Mountain, and the other mountains were utterly shocked.
<br><br>
"It's Zen..."
<br><br>
"It's really him!"
<br><br>
"He is the savior of our Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
Goran and the others were even more ecstatic, especially Athemar, who was in an extremely good mood at that point.
<br><br>
As Zen descended with the golden bow, more and more people saw and recognized him.
<br><br>
"It's Zen!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God! He did it! He really destroyed the suns!"
<br><br>
"How is that possible?"
<br><br>
They were unaware that Zen felt it was easy for him to destroy the nine suns. After all, such a deed was beyond their imagination and understanding. Thus, they considered what he had done as a miracle.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Zen's cultivation base was greatly different from that of Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Even the wisest men among them like Auden and Pearce never thought that Emperor Charm already had an invincible nemesis over a thousand divine eras ago, and that nemesis could defeat him easily.
<br><br>
As for Elizabeth, Micah, and the other members of the Sun Crow race, they thought of another matter. Since Emperor Charm, who was quite familiar with the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy, lived in Zen's body, he must have told Zen how to extinguish those suns.
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
A few moments later, Zen landed in the middle of the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
Thunderous applause echoed in the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
After everyone had gone through a life and death crisis, all of them felt truly grateful.
<br><br>
Even though they could only offer a round of applause now, their cheers were heartfelt.
<br><br>
Of course, Kenelm, Gant, and Monica were overjoyed. They all ran towards Zen and enveloped him in a long hug.
<br><br>
Still, Libby was confused. She knew that Zen was a disciple of the Land of Sword Grief, so how did he know those Other Shore Realm warriors? She decided to ask some people, and their answers surprised her more. She didn't know that Zen had been promoted step by step from the Dragon City...
<br><br>
There were two words in the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy, which were "World Destruction", Those words were enough to prove the theurgy's immense power.
<br><br>
Just now, a layer of the surface of the entire North Unicorn Province got peeled away.
<br><br>
As a result, the creatures on the ground of the North Unicorn Province, ranging from small ants in tiny crevices to some rare beasts, all burned to ashes.
<br><br>
Only a small number of them that hid deep underground had survived.
<br><br>
Now, the Evil God had been hiding deep beneath the ground and was still in cultivation. He didn't know what had happened in the outside world.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the place the Evil God had chosen was far away from the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
If he was in the southwest of the North Unicorn Province, then he would've been in trouble even if he hid deep below the ground.
<br><br>
That was because the nine suns were up high in the southwest and descended from the sky. In other words, they had targeted the North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
But now they were gone, and everything looked different from they used to be.
<br><br>
The ground around the North Mysterious City was burned and had turned into layers of flowing magma. If one stood on the city wall of the North Mysterious City, they would see the vast ocean of magma around them and even feel the heat it emanated. It was like the North Mysterious City had turned into a lonely boat in the middle of the magma sea.
<br><br>
After the catastrophe was over, the leaders of the mountains brought their men back to the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
The southwestern region of the North Unicorn Province had already become a sea of magma. It was unknown how many years it would take for the magma to solidify.
<br><br>
Since the magma couldn't trap them, everyone flew up in the air and left the destroyed North Mysterious City.
<br><br>
Pearce, who flew in front of the others, thought about what the Sun Crow race would do next.
<br><br>
Zen had almost taken away all the core members of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Once Emperor Charm learned the news, he would naturally be furious and would likely launch an aggressive attack in return.
<br><br>
And since he was too powerful, no one in the Oneness Sky Palace could stop him.
<br><br>
The mere thought of it made Pearce upset.
<br><br>
In the next second, a golden sword on his waist glowed and transmitted a wisp of consciousness straight to his mind. It was the distress signal from the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
The leaders of all the mountains also received the signal, and their hearts pounded loudly in their chests.
<br><br>
 Chapter 3667 The Dragon Cliff The Bloom Divine Province was the base of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
With the invasion of the Sun Crow race, Pearce chose to lead the soldiers to resist the enemy in the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
He just didn't want the Sun Crow race to wreak havoc in the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
However, when the Sun Crow race wantonly attacked, he didn't expect that the Bearing race would assign another force to advance from the southeast.
<br><br>
The southeast of the Bloom Divine Province had always been uninhabited.
<br><br>
From time to time, races from the savage land would attempt to launch attacks from there.
<br><br>
Later, the Oneness Sky Palace set up a pass in the southeast of the Bloom Divine Province. There, on the Dragon Cliff, they set up the Bloody Sword Array.
<br><br>
For hundreds of years, powerful Oneness Governors had guarded the Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
Currently, the designated Oneness Governor was a man called Patton Lin.
<br><br>
Just like Zen, Patton also had a perfect matching with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. As a direct descendant of the Lin Clan in the Origin Mountain, he was treated with the same respect as Dorothy was. However, a dispute in the Oneness Sky Palace involving him had broken out two hundred years ago, which led to the death of his wife.
<br><br>
Since then, he had volunteered to come to the Dragon Cliff. For the past two hundred years, he had been the one guarding the cliff.
<br><br>
In his time there, the savage alien races from the southwest rarely dared to invade. The few who did dare ended up being brutally annihilated...
<br><br>
Ever since the Sun Crow race's invasion from the northeast, the Oneness Sky Palace had been in a state of panic. Even the soldiers on the Dragon Cliff had been worried and engaged in lively discussions.
<br><br>
"This time, the Sun Crow race has come with great power. I wonder if the seven mountains will be able to defeat them..."
<br><br>
"They have to. They've retreated from the Mountain Viewing Province all the way to the North Unicorn Province. They must not let those birds get even the Bloom Divine Province!"
<br><br>
"I have made an application to participate in the war in the North Unicorn Province, but I was rejected..."
<br><br>
"There's nothing we can do about that. Fighting against the Sun Crow race is very important, but guarding the Dragon Cliff is equally important. If we leave, what if the savage races seize this opportunity to stir up trouble?"
<br><br>
As they discussed among themselves, a man in cyan flew towards them.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the man, all the soldiers stood up immediately and bowed towards him.
<br><br>
"Sir, is there any news about the North Unicorn Province?"
<br><br>
"Is our Oneness Sky Palace winning?"
<br><br>
"Did they stop the Sun Crow race in the North Unicorn Province?"
<br><br>
The man in cyan robe was none other than the Oneness Governor Patton.
<br><br>
Patton looked into the eyes of his soldiers. He could tell they were just as concerned about the war in the north as he was.
<br><br>
However, it was difficult for news to be delivered across provinces. Even Patton found himself receiving delayed information through communication tokens.
<br><br>
He shook his head. "I got the news that the battle is still going on. However, the specific situation is not clear."
<br><br>
Their hearts sank.
<br><br>
"Sir, it doesn't matter if the Dragon Cliff is guarded or not. Anyway, those savage alien races won't dare to enter the Bloom Divine Province!"
<br><br>
"Yes. How about we go north?"
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Patton's expression darkened. "Nonsense! We can't leave our post. Even if we do, how much help could you offer them, given your strength?"
<br><br>
Although Patton was considered a rare talent in the Origin Mountain, his foundation was still shallow. He was probably a bit stronger than Libby, but he was nowhere near the level of Athemar, who was also the Oneness Governor.
<br><br>
Even if he led these soldiers to battle, he doubted their presence would tip the scales in their favor.
<br><br>
After being scolded by the Oneness Governor, these soldiers immediately shut up. They silently looked at the landscape in the distance.
<br><br>
Suddenly, rays of red light burst out from the patterns in the front of the Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
Patton and the others present frowned at the sight of the red light.
<br><br>
"Speak of the devil. Those savage aliens really decided to pick a fight now!" a soldier said fiercely.
<br><br>
Another soldier drew his sword. "Humph! And I just wanted to vent my anger. Perfect timing!"
<br><br>
All of them were no strangers to slaughtering the savage aliens.
<br><br>
Patton eyed the rays of red light in the distance warily. Instead of giving orders, he stood still, as though deep in thought. After a while, he finally said in a low voice, "Things are not good..."
<br><br>
"Sir, what's wrong?" a burly soldier with a huge sword resting on his shoulder asked.
<br><br>
Normally, Patton would resolutely start giving orders at this point. How come he was so hesitant today? He couldn't imagine Patton being scared.
<br><br>
After all, he was their fearless leader.
<br><br>
Patton pointed at the rays of red light. "The Bone Array, the Dream Array, and the Spiritual Array have been forcefully destroyed. But what about the Secret Array, the Picture Array, and the Darkness Array?"
<br><br>
Then, the others also sensed that something was amiss. As they kept their eyes glued to the red light, their expressions grew grave.
<br><br>
The Bone Array, the Dream Array and the Spiritual Array were arranged behind the other three arrays: the Secret Array, the Picture Array and the Darkness Array. Since the former three arrays had been destroyed, the latter three ones should have been in worse shape. However, they couldn't determine the condition of these three arrays now.
<br><br>
This probably meant that the Secret Array, the Picture Array and the Darkness Array had been cracked...
<br><br>
Those savage aliens had all sorts of powerful talents, but their intelligence was generally inferior to that of humans. How could they possibly crack such intricate arrays? The red light meant something-- that there were extremely powerful array breakers among the intruders.
<br><br>
This ultimately meant these intruders were not savage aliens! In the currently delicate situation, they needed to be on high alert for any tiny change! "Activate the Bloody Sword Array," Patton finally ordered.
<br><br>
The Bloody Sword Array was the greatest sword array on the Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
It had only been activated three times since the Dragon Cliff was built, not long after the Oneness Sky Palace was established. Since Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself eliminated the three major savage alien races, the Bloody Sword Array had never been activated again.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Streaks of blood-red light flashed around the entire Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
The huge cliff resembled a giant dragon stretching its neck to look at the sky. With the Bloody Sword Array activated, it was as though the dragon was coming to life.
<br><br>
An immense aura soared into the sky, flowing forth from the Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
Patton stood atop it, gravely surveying the scene before him.
<br><br>
As he expected, several figures soon appeared around thirty thousand feet away from the Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
Seeing those people clearly, Patton shut his eyes tightly and took a deep breath. A strong sense of frustration came to him.
<br><br>
He figured that the people in the distance were either from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race. If this was so, it'd be impossible for his soldiers to defend the Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
"Everyone," he addressed his soldiers loudly, "get into the transmission array and return to the Oneness Sky Palace. Now!"
<br><br>
At the sight of the enemy, the soldiers gasped in horror. However, despite their initial fear, they still felt there was a chance they could fight their enemy.
<br><br>
Upon hearing Patton's orders, everyone was stunned for a moment. When they finally came back to their senses, they broke into an uproar.
<br><br>
"I won't leave!"
<br><br>
"You can leave if you want. But I am staying to fight!"
<br><br>
"I'm willing to guard the Dragon Cliff, if it's the last thing I do!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3668 Reaching The Core Area (Part One) These soldiers had already understood that the intruders were extremely powerful, and that the Dragon Cliff could not resist them.
<br><br>
Patton knew this well, which was why he had asked his men to leave first.
<br><br>
They could guard the seven mountains if they remained alive.
<br><br>
But none of the soldiers was willing to retreat. Patton ignored their determination. What had to be done, had to be done.
<br><br>
"Please kill us if you don't want us to stay!" the strapping man said firmly.
<br><br>
Patton looked at them, stunned. After a long time, he said, "Walker, you need to go to destroy the transmission array. You can all leave through the transmission array before it is destroyed. I'm letting you go back because then you can guard the seven mountains. I'm not going to let you become deserters!"
<br><br>
Everyone knew this, but no one wanted to leave. They didn't have a way back if Walker destroyed the transmission array.
<br><br>
Some distance away, an old man in white approached them, a black rod perched on his shoulder. He shouted, his voice hoarse, "I've heard that the person guarding the Dragon Cliff is Patton, a talent of the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Are you Patton?"
<br><br>
Patton unsheathed the three-foot-long sword in his hand. The red light on the Dragon Cliff flickered, and the sharp radiance of the Bloody Sword Array appeared. "Yes. What is it to you?"
<br><br>
"We are humans. There is no need for us to fight each other. The Bearing race is in need of powerful warriors. If you are willing to pledge allegiance to our race, you can become immortal and own an eternal life!" the old man said.
<br><br>
Patton understood what the Bearing race was after. Offering the eternal life was indeed a good incentive but nothing could persuade Patton to pledge allegiance to the Bearing race.
<br><br>
He sneered, "Nonsense! Our Oneness Sky Palace is the most orthodox human force in the world. How can we join you?"
<br><br>
The old man didn't think he could persuade Patton. He sighed and looked at the Bloody Sword Array that was wrapped around the Dragon Cliff. Then he stretched out his finger, and tapped lightly on it. "Pass through the middle line. I can break the array easily."
<br><br>
About fifteen minutes later, the old man came upon the broken transmission array that lay behind the Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
He frowned.
<br><br>
"This is completely destroyed. Even if it's repaired, it cannot build an accurate space channel," he said.
<br><br>
Beside him stood a masked man, his skin dark green. He said rather stoically, "We can advance once we enter the Bloom Divine Province. It doesn't matter if we have to spend a longer time."
<br><br>
"Let's go," another man said, passing through the transmission array and flying on forward.
<br><br>
After dozens of people had flown away, the old man shook the fishing rod on his shoulder. Patton's head was hanging at the front of the fishing rod.
<br><br>
His head had been cut off, his handsome face still scrunched with malice.
<br><br>
He stared at the old man ferociously.
<br><br>
"I cracked the array fast enough, but you still killed three of my people with a sword and a broken array," the old man said with a sigh. "Young people nowadays can't be underestimated."
<br><br>
Saying thus, he took a step forward and jumped.
<br><br>
Patton's head was now hanging on the fish line, floating behind him.
<br><br>
After the old man caught up with the team, a tall, thin man asked, "There are seven mountains in the Oneness Sky Palace, but our goal should be the Oneness Mountain, right?"
<br><br>
The old man nodded. "The biggest trouble of the Oneness Sky Palace is Eastern Emperor Taiyi. If he breaks free from the shackles and wakes up, all of us will die."
<br><br>
"We'd better kill him first, since he's trapped on the Other Shore," the tall, thin man said.
<br><br>
"Of course. I will lead my men to attack the Phoenix Palace of the Oneness Mountain," said the old man.
<br><br>
There were many arrays in the Oneness Mountain, and even a strong warrior couldn't break through them easily.
<br><br>
But this old man was a super-normal talent of the Bearing race. His talent involved breaking arrays. There was no array in the world that he couldn't break.
<br><br>
Gethin had handed over most of the information about the Oneness Mountain to the old man. He knew the Oneness Mountain very well, causing him to believe that attacking it wouldn't be too difficult.
<br><br>
But since the transmission array broke, they had to use the slow way— flying.
<br><br>
Soon after they entered the Bloom Divine Province, they found the Ethereal Dragon City in the southwest.
<br><br>
There were also people from the Oneness Sky Palace guarding the Ethereal Dragon City. But they weren't skilled enough to resist an attack from these masters of the Bearing race. They were all killed in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Some people had wanted to destroy the transmission array in the Ethereal Dragon City again, but their efforts had been in vain.
<br><br>
After they passed through the transmission array, the members of the Bearing race reached a mountain city. They then passed through the transmission array once again, following which they reached the Dragon City.
<br><br>
The transmission array of the Dragon City lay outside the Dragon Shadow Pavilion, guarded by several Oneness Guards.
<br><br>
During the war, the entire Bloom Divine Province remained heavily guarded, and all the arrays of various sizes in the Oneness Mountain were activated. Even so, the Oneness Guards had never dreamed that these people would enter the Dragon City through the transmission array.
<br><br>
They were stunned to see the old man and the other members of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"Who are you? Show me the Sword Card of the Oneness Sky Palace!" one of the Oneness Guards shouted.
<br><br>
Before he could finish speaking, a thin fish line was wrapped around his throat. The old man's arm trembled, and with one yank, the Oneness Guard had been beheaded.
<br><br>
The other Oneness Guards were alarmed. Some screamed, some shouted out warnings, some took out their Other Shore Tokens to fight, and some chose to escape.
<br><br>
But it didn't matter what these Oneness Guards did or what choice they made, it was all meaningless in the face of these powerful warriors.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race were casual in their moves but many of the Oneness Guards had disintegrated into pieces.
<br><br>
The death of these Oneness Guards alarmed more people.
<br><br>
Sellers who guarded the Sword Tower, Calum who guarded the Dragon Path, and other powerful warriors stationed in the Dragon City swung into action.
<br><br>
These warriors were much stronger than the Oneness Guards. But since the members from the Bearing race were as powerful as Athemar, they couldn't take them seriously.
<br><br>
In the next five minutes, many people in the whole Dragon City were massacred and the city was destroyed.
<br><br>
The old man's wrinkled face looked bored. He looked up at the Oneness Mountain. The mountain's protecting arrays had already been activated.
<br><br>
"I'd prefer to break the arrays as against killing," he said, carrying the fishing rod to the Dragon Path.
<br><br>
Blazing flames shot up everywhere in the Dragon City.
<br><br>
The Truth Library, the Best Swords Shop, and other places were all now burning.
<br><br>
Those warriors of the Bearing race slaughtered people and burned the Dragon City before flying into the air and following the old man.
<br><br>
The old man climbed up the mountain, breaking all the arrays on the way.
<br><br>
Regardless of the extraordinary power of the various strange arrays on the Oneness Mountain, he could figure out their essence and easily break them.
<br><br>
He climbed to the top of the Dragon Path in less than three hours.
<br><br>
He led the crowd, but did not move towards the three sword sects. They had no interest in either the Flow Sword Sect or the Killing Sword Sect.
<br><br>
Chapter 3669 Reaching The Core Area (Part Two) He made a detour from the side of the Dragon Path and went to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
News had been sent back to the seven mountains about the members of the Bearing race attacking the Dragon Cliff.
<br><br>
The enchanted barriers of the arrays in the seven mountains had been opened, but the disciples of the major sword sects were still panicking.
<br><br>
In the Flow Sword Sect Trish, dressed in white, flew along the road between the yards. She gently pushed the door of a house open and found Letitia walking up to her and asking with concern, "How's it going?"
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race had attacked suddenly. Zen had been afraid that Letitia and the others would be worried about him, which was why he hadn't gone up the mountain when he had made his way to the North Unicorn Province from the Dragon City.
<br><br>
It was quite a while before Letitia got the news that the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace were fighting, and that Zen had joined the Oneness Guards to fight the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Letitia was worried about Zen. But after having gone through so much with Zen, she knew that Zen was able to resolve the crisis. She believed that Zen would return safely.
<br><br>
"The situation is not looking good," said Trish.
<br><br>
"What happened?" Letitia asked, her heart sinking.
<br><br>
Trish hesitated before saying, "Word is that Emperor Charm has employed the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy in the North Unicorn Province and burned everything in the province to ashes."
<br><br>
Those who had escaped through the transmission array had relayed this news. After the transmission array was destroyed, they had thought that the North Mysterious City had been burned to ashes and that the seven mountains' powerful warriors had died in the process.
<br><br>
"Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy?" Letitia's eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
Trish nodded and said, "That's Emperor Charm's theurgy. I'm afraid it's very difficult for Mr. Luo..."
<br><br>
On hearing the terrifying rumor, Trish thought that Zen might have died in the North Unicorn Province along with the other powerful warriors.
<br><br>
Zen was powerful, but his growth and progress in such a short period of time was limited. Even the strong warriors like Athemar and Pearce had died in the North Unicorn Province. It was far-fetched, according to her, that could Zen escape.
<br><br>
"Okay, I see," Letitia said, nodding.
<br><br>
Trish noticed that Letitia was calm. She knew that Letitia had a deep, close relationship with Zen, which was why she found Letitia's calmness at the news so strange.
<br><br>
Letitia was worried, but in the past many years, she had never seen Zen fear fire.
<br><br>
If the scorching suns had really burned them, the others wouldn't have survived. But Zen's chances of survival were very high.
<br><br>
It was at this moment that another woman in purple walked over to them and asked in a rather hurried tone, "Trish, do you have any news about my husband?"
<br><br>
The purple clothed woman was Edna. Zen had released her from his inner world and allowed her to live in the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
The Evil God had become Zen's Inner-world Generating Avatar, but Edna was still very concerned about the Evil God.
<br><br>
According to her, as long as the Evil God didn't betray Zen, there would be a bright future for him.
<br><br>
The women in the yard had seen the Evil God before, and they all had an instinctive aversion towards him. That was why they disliked Edna. Trish glared coldly at Edna and said, "He's a nobody. How would I know anything about him? He might have died in the North Unicorn Province."
<br><br>
Edna's shoulder trembled at Trish's answer, her eyes brimming with tears.
<br><br>
She forced a smile and turned around.
<br><br>
Margaret looked down at them when she was standing on the second floor, and heard everything that Trish had just said.
<br><br>
Margaret would have cried bitterly in the past at such bad news.
<br><br>
But with her pregnancy, she had become calmer. She had begun to do everything according to Zen's instructions. All for the baby in her belly.
<br><br>
She paled a little, pursing her lips. But she forced herself to calm down, her expression returning to normal. She believed that Zen would come back.
<br><br>
Not long after Trish arrived, the ground began to suddenly shake.
<br><br>
Rumble...
<br><br>
A dragon-shaped lightning exploded in the distance, seeming to cut heaven and earth in half.
<br><br>
Even a colossal thing like the Oneness Mountain began to shake. It looked like a giant beast trying to shake off the lice on its body.
<br><br>
Margaret was agile. She had been leaning against the fence to stare at the lightning which came from behind the Flow Sword Sect. It wasn't hard to guess that it came from the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
The Oneness Mountain, especially the Phoenix Palace, the core of the Oneness Sky Palace, was on high alert. After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was protected in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
If the intruders were to attack and kill him, the Oneness Sky Palace would lose its biggest support.
<br><br>
More than sixty people floated above the white mist, led by an old man carrying a fishing rod.
<br><br>
A man with red hair had just released the lightning. Many bolts of lightning were still moving in the man's palms like small insects. He smiled and said, "Master Ware, you met with no resistance on your way here. But this white mist is now stopping you. I wasn't expecting this!"
<br><br>
This man was called Hancock Zhu and he was the brother of one of the Five-element Emissaries from the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Ware glared at Hancock Zhu and sneered, "The previous arrays are powerful, but their techniques aren't that great. Breaking them is cakewalk for me. The Primitive Illusion in front of us was personally set up by Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Breaking it isn't that easy."
<br><br>
When Hancock Zhu had launched a series of punches at the Primitive Illusion, Ware felt the hate bubble up within him. He thought that he was just another vulgar man. If Hancock Zhu hadn't had a brother who was one of the Five-element Emissaries, he wouldn't have been qualified enough to stand together with Ware.
<br><br>
Ware shook the fishing rod, sneering disdainfully at Hancock Zhu. The thin, long fishing line had already disappeared into the mist.
<br><br>
"The Primitive Illusion is arranged using the eighteen pillars of the Primitive Temple. If we can't find the eighteen pillars before entering the illusion, we could be trapped inside for life," Ware said, smiling faintly.
<br><br>
Back then, the Oneness Sky Palace had been on good terms with the Sun Crow race. Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm had had a close, friendly relationship, and treated each other as brothers. Some secrets weren't secret to the two races, which gave Ware the confidence to break the array.
<br><br>
Everyone in the Phoenix Palace was panicking.
<br><br>
The lightning that had descended from the sky was enough to prove the strength of the opponent.
<br><br>
Fortunately, it was not that easy to break the Primitive Illusion. The lightning had fallen outside the Phoenix Palace, but the palace itself was not damaged.
<br><br>
But could the Primitive Illusion really block the powerful warriors? Most of them despaired.
<br><br>
There were a lot of guards guarding the Supreme Dragon Hall.
<br><br>
Over a thousand golden armored guards stood guard on the outermost layer.
<br><br>
Most of these golden armored guards were only as powerful as the five-star Oneness Guards.
<br><br>
Flamine stood before the palace gate, knowing that once the Phoenix Palace was destroyed, these golden armored guards would be nothing more than cannon fodder.
<br><br>
She raised her head, her eyes easily piercing through the layers of white mist and falling on the strong warriors of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"They split into two groups. The first group went to capture the North Unicorn Province, while the second group came to attack the Bloom Divine Province..." Flamine sighed.
<br><br>
This was not a complicated strategy.
<br><br>
When the Oneness Sky Palace fell short of soldiers and generals, it would have no power to fight back against the joint attack of several large races.
<br><br>
"What should we do if the powerful warriors come in? How about we move Eastern Emperor Taiyi away from here?" Jean paced back and forth in panic.
<br><br>
Chapter 3670 Sacrifice Himself (Part One) Jean was always arrogant in the Phoenix Palace, holding her head high. She wasn't afraid of anything other than Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
But she shivered violently as she faced this real crisis, fearful of what was to come.
<br><br>
"Mother!"
<br><br>
Even Cleon, Chance, and Ahmad who were sitting on the stairs, couldn't bear to see the timidity in her features.
<br><br>
The three brothers were selfish but given that they were the sons of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, they remained calm in such a crucial life-and-death situation.
<br><br>
They understood that they could hold high positions in the palace because Eastern Emperor Taiyi was their father. And now that their father was in danger of dying, they had obviously chosen to fight the invaders and protect him till the end of their lives.
<br><br>
"I'm trying to find a way out," Jean said, glaring at her sons to conceal her panic and embarrassment.
<br><br>
Cleon was calm as he tried to persuade her. "Those powerful people have already surrounded the Primitive Illusion. We can't move Father even if we want to. We have no way out!"
<br><br>
"If they break in, we should go all out!" added Chance.
<br><br>
Those who sat on the stairs with him were all children and grandchildren of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Elvinia also sat beside them, an elbow on her knee, and held a piece of thin paper that had been floating in the wind with the other hand. A number of words were scribbled on it.
<br><br>
At Chance's words, she merely looked indifferently at him.
<br><br>
In such a critical situation, the three brothers became courageous and persistent, in sharp contrast to their mother. No wonder they were Elvinia's half-brothers. They were much better than their mother.
<br><br>
Elvinia regretted coming back. No matter how exquisite the Truth Enlightenment was, it was useless in this moment. Her father couldn't even see it, and even if he did, what would be the use of it all in such a critical moment? Could the people around her defeat the powerful invaders above with it? She couldn't send the Truth Enlightenment to her father. Moreover, she was blocked here and couldn't go to the North Unicorn Province either.
<br><br>
The news about the tragic battle in the North Unicorn Province was being brought to the Phoenix Palace and Elvinia had learned of it the first time it had come here. As a "demon woman" from the Divine Lair, she knew better how terrible the Nine-Sun World Destruction was.
<br><br>
'Have all the powerful warriors of the seven mountains been killed? Zen should be the only exception. Has he survived?' All of a sudden, a flame lit up from her fingertip and burned the paper.
<br><br>
Lavender, who was sitting on the step below Elvinia, looked curiously at the burning paper and said, "Little Master, what are you burning?"
<br><br>
Elvinia smiled and answered, "Something written by Zen."
<br><br>
At the mention of Zen's name, Laquisha, Lavender, and Nelly suddenly became interested. "What did he write?" they asked in unison.
<br><br>
"The whole Truth Enlightenment," Elvinia replied with a faint smile.
<br><br>
The others didn't care about what Elvinia was burning, but at the mention of the Truth Enlightenment, their gazes immediately shot to her.
<br><br>
Even Flamine, Jean, and a few strong masters who had stayed in the Phoenix Palace turned to her.
<br><br>
Flamine asked, "Is that why you came back to the Phoenix Palace and wanted to meet your father?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Elvinia said simply.
<br><br>
"Why didn't you tell me this before?" Flamine said, frowning.
<br><br>
"What difference does it make if I told you?" Elvinia asked as she stared up at Flamine.
<br><br>
Flamine thought for a while and said nothing more.
<br><br>
The whole Truth Enlightenment was important to Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
But with the crucial life-and-death situation in the Oneness Sky Palace at this point, it would be of no meaning to take it out.
<br><br>
"But it shouldn't have been burned! That's the Truth Enlightenment!" Jean exclaimed, glaring at Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia looked coldly back at her. "So what? We let them take it away?"
<br><br>
This was enough to render Jean speechless. They couldn't fend for themselves, let alone fight to keep this paper. Jean looked up at the sky, sighing in frustration.
<br><br>
A thin fishing line was moving relentlessly in the Primitive Illusion.
<br><br>
The thread acted as Ware's eyes. He could feel anything it touched.
<br><br>
"I've found the sixth pillar. It is easier than I thought," Ware said with a happy smile.
<br><br>
He had found six pillars in a short period of time, much faster than he had expected. It looked like it wouldn't take much time to find all the pillars in the Primitive Illusion.
<br><br>
Ware was loud on purpose. His voice was loud as thunder, echoing clearly through the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
"The seventh pillar!"
<br><br>
"The eighth pillar!"
<br><br>
"The ninth pillar!"
<br><br>
Every time Ware counted a number, the hearts of the people in the Phoenix Palace would tremble and skip a collective beat.
<br><br>
"The sixteenth pillar!"
<br><br>
"The seventeenth pillar!"
<br><br>
"The eighteenth pillar!"
<br><br>
Buzz! The thin thread emitted a cyan light in the Primitive Illusion that penetrated the thick white mist with ease.
<br><br>
The white mist that had been lingering over the Phoenix Palace all year round dispersed in an instant, revealing only eighteen bare pillars.
<br><br>
Flamine stood at the top of the stairs in front of the Supreme Dragon Hall, her long luxurious sleeves fluttering. She looked at all the people sitting below and said firmly, "We have no way out. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi dies, we all will die. So please don't hold back!"
<br><br>
Only seven people who were as strong as Flamine stayed at the front of the Supreme Dragon Hall.
<br><br>
Buzz! Ripples spread before the Supreme Dragon Hall, and another big array rose into the air. Flamine stretched out her legs and stepped gently into the air.
<br><br>
She then reappeared at the center of the big array, the Three-Element Sword Array! Three long swords shot out of the array.
<br><br>
These swords were the Heaven Sword, the Earth Sword, and the Human Sword. Flamine, without any hesitation, took charge of the Heaven Sword.
<br><br>
Another two masters followed her and grasped the Earth Sword and the Human Sword.
<br><br>
Ware looked down at the Three-Element Sword Array in front of the Supreme Dragon Hall and said with a mocking smile, "I didn't expect such a dignified existence as Eastern Emperor Taiyi would rely on his wife to protect him. The Three-Element Sword Array is indeed powerful, but it's a pity that you meet me!"
<br><br>
He then waved the fishing rod and barked an order, "Attack it! Hold the three swords and I'll continue to break the array!"
<br><br>
"Now that victory is in sight, why should you be bothered? Master Ware, let me destroy this palace!" A short man behind Ware said anxiously.
<br><br>
"Illusory Mountain Press!"
<br><br>
The shadow of a huge mountain emerged from nowhere, dashing swiftly towards the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
This shadow was like an upside down mountain. Although it was virtual, the power contained within it was still terrifying.
<br><br>
At the sight of the illusory mountain, Flamine's expression shifted several times before she managed to calm herself.
<br><br>
She waved the Heaven Sword lightly and said to the other two, "ThreeElement Defense!"
<br><br>
Bang! With the joint resistance of the three swords, the illusory mountain was halted outside the array.
<br><br>
An area of about ten thousand feet around the Supreme Dragon Hall was now protected, but under the pressure of the mountain shadow, all other halls and pavilions of the Phoenix Palace turned to dust.
<br><br>
"Again!"
<br><br>
The short man stretched out his hands, and the huge mountain shadow solidified and became more powerful.
<br><br>
Sizzle! The Three-Element Sword Array sizzled under the pressure, but it finally managed to block the attack.
<br><br>
"I'm in!"
<br><br>
"Let's see how long you can hold on."
<br><br>
Chapter 3671 Sacrifice Himself (Part Two) "It's just a sword array, and it's not good at defense. Why bother to hold on?"
<br><br>
Some masters of the Bearing race looked down at those of the Phoenix Palace who were trying their best to support the sword array. They looked playful as they made their moves.
<br><br>
Boom! Some of the Bearing race came from the Sky Guard Pavilion.
<br><br>
The Sky Guard Pavilion was to the Bearing race what the Land of Sword Grief was to the Oneness Sky Palace, except for the fact that there were memorial tablets in the Sky Guard Pavilion.
<br><br>
When the masters were strong enough to undertake tasks alone, they would obtain a memorial tablet representing high status. Their strength was almost the same as Flamine's.
<br><br>
These masters relied on the theurgies of various Other Shore Tokens, which were in different forms but all with terrifying power.
<br><br>
Flamine and the other two masters wielded the swords in their hands calmly to resist the enemies.
<br><br>
No matter how strong the theurgies these people poured out were, the Three-Element Sword Array was unbreakable and withstood consequent attacks! "Lavender, Nelly, Laquisha, hide behind the Supreme Dragon Hall," Elvinia said suddenly.
<br><br>
"Why?" Lavender asked, confused.
<br><br>
"Once this array is broken, you can take the opportunity to escape. Their target is my father. They won't do anything to you," said Elvinia.
<br><br>
As the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Elvinia was determined to live and die with her father.
<br><br>
But she didn't want Lavender and the other two to die with her. After all, they still had Zen.
<br><br>
"Little Master, let's run away together. Please!" Laquisha said anxiously.
<br><br>
In a battle of this level, Elvinia's strength was insignificant. She could escape with them.
<br><br>
Elvinia smiled bitterly and shook her head.
<br><br>
People born in the Phoenix Palace could obtain more resources, and as a result, they'd have to take up more responsibilities.
<br><br>
Elvinia and her half-brothers didn't have the slightest intention of running away.
<br><br>
"Let's wait for a moment. We can't leave the array now. Even if we leave, we might not remain alive," Lavender suddenly said.
<br><br>
The powerful warriors in the sky sent out tens of thousands of divine megatons of force every time they attacked.
<br><br>
The bricks and tiles of the Phoenix Palace turned to dust, having been crushed over and over again. They would also turn to dust if they were to flee at their current strength and weren't careful enough.
<br><br>
This round of attacks lasted for a while and once they ended, the expressions that the powerful warriors from the Sky Guard Pavilion wore, changed.
<br><br>
They hadn't expected the last array to be so powerful as to forcefully shut them out.
<br><br>
"Master Ware, I'm afraid it's not that easy to destroy the array with brute force. Please help us," the short man said deferentially.
<br><br>
The short man hadn't expected a mere sword array to so easily block all his attacks.
<br><br>
An unfathomable smile on his face, Ware said, "The Supreme Dragon Hall is protecting the real body of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. The last array won't be so easy to destroy. With your forcible attacks, you may not be able to destroy it even in a few days and nights."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he threw the fishing rod again.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The thin fishing line fell from the sky and rolled towards the Three-Element Sword Array below.
<br><br>
Flamine raised her eyebrows at Ware's action. The thread wrapped around his fishing rod was his Other Shore Token called Sky Cloud Thread.
<br><br>
With this thread, he could break through almost all the arrays in the world.
<br><br>
That was why he had become a great array breaker in the world.
<br><br>
With the help of the Three-Element Sword Array, Flamine had thought she could still defend them until Eastern Emperor Taiyi woke up.
<br><br>
And now, it was almost impossible.
<br><br>
But she had no other choice. She would never allow Ware to break the array.
<br><br>
"Master Heller!"
<br><br>
Flamine turned, with the Heaven Sword in hand, and exclaimed.
<br><br>
An old man sat on the stairs behind her. He was as strong as Auden and Pearce, but he hadn't made a single move.
<br><br>
He had once fought alongside Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but had been cursed when wandering in Stage Thirty-two. He had encountered a kind of Other Shore Token with negative effects which, when touched, forcefully laid the curse on his inner world.
<br><br>
His strength had greatly reduced since. Over the years, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had used a special method to help him suppress the curse.
<br><br>
The curse was so powerful that it consumed a lot of energy just to suppress it each time.
<br><br>
Master Heller was loyal to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who had helped him survive. He felt that he had become a burden to the emperor and wanted to die.
<br><br>
But he had changed his mind a while ago.
<br><br>
Zen got two Hearts of Accomplice in Stage Thirteen. One of them was presented to Eastern Emperor Taiyi by Athemar.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token was powerful, but it would cause the owner to sacrifice themselves.
<br><br>
It was not difficult to find a person willing to be sacrificed in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
But Master Heller was also present at the time. His eyes lit up as he learned about this Other Shore Token. He applied to Eastern Emperor Taiyi to merge with the Heart of Accomplice.
<br><br>
At least, he'd no longer be a burden after fusing with it.
<br><br>
He would be qualified enough to fight the top masters just like Pearce and Auden and perish alongside them.
<br><br>
Seeing that Master Heller was desperately seeking death, Eastern Emperor Taiyi agreed to his request. At least he would want to live on after he had merged with the Heart of Accomplice.
<br><br>
They would never let him die until the last moment.
<br><br>
Neither Flamine nor Eastern Emperor Taiyi had expected that this last moment would arrive so soon.
<br><br>
At her call, Master Heller suddenly stood up and laughed harshly, soaring into the sky.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha-ha! Array breaker, do you still remember me?" Master Heller asked, tucking his silver hair behind his head.
<br><br>
Ware had controlled the thread to break the array. At Master Heller's shouts, he looked up and said casually, "A loser from hundreds of years ago. You haven't died yet?"
<br><br>
The Bearing race had had a hand in the curse on Master Heller. At the time, even Eastern Emperor Taiyi had suffered a great loss.
<br><br>
"Are you disappointed?" Master Heller said with a relieved smile. "I'm going to die today!"
<br><br>
Ware merely looked at him before saying, "Help him."
<br><br>
At this order, those next to Ware made to move towards Heller but the loud sound of a heartbeat broke through the air.
<br><br>
Bump! Bump! Bump! Breaking the array using the Sky Cloud Thread had demanded a great deal of effort and attention from Ware. What was more, Flamine was constantly changing the array to disturb him. And now, the sudden heartbeat was having a great impact on his mind while greatly confusing him. Where was this sound coming from? Master Heller continued to laugh loudly. "I'm going to die today, but I won't die alone!"
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Ware finally realized that something was wrong. The sound of heartbeat grew louder and louder.
<br><br>
Bump! Bump! Bump! Ware was also a man with vast knowledge. All of a sudden, he realized what could be wrong.
<br><br>
Ware hurriedly stopped the men beside him from making a move and said, "Damn it! Stop! It's the Heart of Accomplice! He actually has it!"
<br><br>
Master Heller laughed a sinister laugh. "Stop? You think I can't die just because you stop?"
<br><br>
Swoosh! A shadow of a heart appeared above his head - the Heart of Accomplice. It then lit up; he had burned this Other Shore Token! Chapter 3672 Insist There were a few records stating that Lord Shaw was killed by the Heart of Accomplice, and no one had ever burned this heart.
<br><br>
Splash! As the Heart of Accomplice began to burn, so did the entire body of Heller.
<br><br>
This was a special reaction of energy, only possible with the heart.
<br><br>
Aside from it being rare, it was also severe torture. Even Heller, a powerful warrior who had reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, couldn't find it in himself to endure it.
<br><br>
However, though his face expressed pain, his eyes shone excitement.
<br><br>
He was just happy that a loser like him could still help Eastern Emperor Taiyi before he died.
<br><br>
Splash! As Heller's body burned, a wave of fright struck Ware.
<br><br>
Just then, a sharp pain pierced through his back that sent a burning sensation all over. Apparently, this was the consequence of Heller burning the Other Shore Token and violating the truth.
<br><br>
"Help... Please help me..." Ware wailed in pain.
<br><br>
The strong warriors surrounding him were stunned, their faces shifting from confident to serious.
<br><br>
But no matter how much Ware cried out for help desperately, they didn't help him. Instead, they kept retreating backwards.
<br><br>
"Kill him!"
<br><br>
"Kill that old man and we might be able to save Master Ware!"
<br><br>
"Attack!"
<br><br>
These people knew that it was all because of Heller. If they killed him, they could save Ware.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! All of a sudden, two men soared down from the air. The one on the left held a spear, while the one on the right held a halberd.
<br><br>
"Don't, don't kill him..."
<br><br>
Ware pleaded in agony. If Heller died, he would definitely die along with him.
<br><br>
However, his voice was too weak for anyone to hear. Meanwhile, the two men were so determined to save his life that they didn't hold back. A bright light flashed and the spear and halberd turned into two beams of lightning that pierced through Heller's body.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! In one instant, Heller was sliced cleanly into two pieces, and so was Ware.
<br><br>
However, as this happened, the burning did not ever cease.
<br><br>
After a few moments, the two were burnt to ashes.
<br><br>
In front of the Phoenix Palace, Flamine paused and looked up into the sky, her face filled with grief.
<br><br>
The reason why Eastern Emperor Taiyi was able to expand the Oneness Sky Palace was that he'd been assisted by loyal elders. It seemed that until their very last breaths, the elders played their roles to the fullest extent.
<br><br>
Right in the sky, the strong warriors of the Bearing race had to witness Ware die, but they could do nothing to stop it.
<br><br>
After a long silence, Hancock cocked his head and spoke out, "Since Master Ware has died, we have no choice but to break the array by force. Although it is difficult to break the Three-Element Sword Array, there is still a solution! Guys, come on! We shouldn't lose hope!"
<br><br>
Although everyone had been weary from Ware's death, Hancock's words easily lightened up their moods.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi still stayed hidden in the Supreme Dragon Hall below. As long as they destroyed the final array, they could kill him so easily. It was their final goal.
<br><br>
"It's just an array. We must work together to break it!"
<br><br>
"It shouldn't be so difficult to get rid of that woman who guards the array!"
<br><br>
"Everyone, come with me!" People screamed and cheered in confidence.
<br><br>
Just then, a small oil pot appeared and hovered over Hancock's head. A flame burned in the mouth of the pot. This was a famous treasure that produced endless flames using blood.
<br><br>
Hancock took out a small blade and sliced a small part of his wrist. He then held his wrist over the pot, letting the blood drip. Then he grabbed the oil pot and made its mouth face the array.
<br><br>
Instead of blood, black fire oil poured out of the pot.
<br><br>
This fusion of fire and oil helped him form a huge flame waterfall.
<br><br>
Though the flame seemed like any other flame, it had astonishing power to never go out. Once it was attached to something, it would never extinguish unless the oil burnt out.
<br><br>
"Guards!"
<br><br>
Seeing the flames, Flamine spun around and summoned the guards for help.
<br><br>
With one word from Flamine, one guard jumped up and an icy blue vortex appeared above his head. This vortex caused a huge icy storm that swept over the fire oil, forming an ice column more than ten thousand feet high.
<br><br>
However, because the fire oil was so powerful, it would only melt the ice column eventually.
<br><br>
Another guard who observed for a while decided that it was time for him to take action. A pair of jade swords appeared in his hands, and with continuous tapping of the swords, a dozen runes circled around the ice column.
<br><br>
Once the runes stabilized, the flames began to seal.
<br><br>
Hancock saw this and grinned. "Although your method is ingenious, do you really think you can block all of us?"
<br><br>
On his cue, the people behind him began to let go all the theurgies they had.
<br><br>
This went on for a minute.
<br><br>
Five minutes passed.
<br><br>
An hour...
<br><br>
Four hours...
<br><br>
The attack never stopped, and there was no sign of it slowing down anytime soon.
<br><br>
Although Flamine was safe under the protection of the Three-Element Sword Array, she seemed drained as ever.
<br><br>
Aside from her, the two men with the Earth Sword and the Human Sword also appeared tired.
<br><br>
At this point, everyone's theurgies sent out thousands of divine megatons of force. Some of the methods were strange, so they had to constantly change their array to deal with them. Even if Eastern Emperor Taiyi stood in the array for hours, there would be a point wherein he would not be able to withstand the attacks, let alone Flamine.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine can't hold on much longer."
<br><br>
"Lady Jean, could you replace her?"
<br><br>
"I... I can't control the Three-Element Sword Array."
<br><br>
"It's very difficult to control the Heaven Sword. I'm afraid I can't do it either."
<br><br>
Seeing Flamine grow weaker after blocking each attack, everyone behind her grew worried. At this rate, the array would be broken in no time.
<br><br>
It came to a point that the people in front of the Supreme Dragon Hall had begun to lose hope.
<br><br>
Was this it? Was the Oneness Sky Palace going to be defeated? Sadly, Pearce and Auden, who led the masters of the seven mountain, died in the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
They had no more reinforcements and no more miracles. They had hoped for a second that Eastern Emperor Taiyi would wake up, but he seemed nowhere close to consciousness.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Pearce led the group of warriors to open up a space channel.
<br><br>
After they had traveled it for a while, they reached the wall between the provinces.
<br><br>
As the group followed Pearce, they passed through the wall and arrived at a large city in the northeast of the Bloom Divine Province, the Tiger Peace City.
<br><br>
Having heard the news of Nine-Sun World Destruction, people began to leave and move out of the city. After all, if the Sun Crow race advanced further, they knew that the city would be their first stop.
<br><br>
Everyone seemed helpless and defeated.
<br><br>
With the masters killed in the North Unicorn Province and the destruction of the Oneness Sky Palace, it seemed like everything was just falling apart.
<br><br>
Even if the people living in the Tiger Peace City retreated, where would they go? After everything that had happened, the Clear Lake and the seven mountains could not put a stop to the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
But just as everyone was about to surrender and let their guards down, a voice rang through the crowd.
<br><br>
"They are back! Thank God they're still alive!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3673 Destroying The Sword Array Under Pearce's leadership, the powerful warriors of the six mountains, the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards, and the warriors of the Other Shore Realm of the twelve passes appeared in the sky.
<br><br>
All the people in the Tiger Peace City looked up and found themselves cheering when they saw Pearce leading the troops.
<br><br>
They couldn't tell what exactly had happened during the battle, but at the very least, the powerful warriors had survived.
<br><br>
Just as they arrived at the Tiger Peace City, someone appeared in the transmission array, looking agitated. He rushed out, and when he saw Pearce and the mountain leaders, he was dazed for a moment before coming to his senses and excitedly saying, "Masters, it's so great to see you're safe and sound!"
<br><br>
The man came from the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Since the Bearing race invaded the Phoenix Palace, once they dealt with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, their next target was likely Yasmin of the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Even the Origin Mountain couldn't escape the calamity.
<br><br>
As the Oneness Sky Palace was stuck in such a situation, they were all in despair.
<br><br>
The man had been sent to the Tiger Peace City to inquire about the situation of the battle in the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
According to previous news, it was likely that the powerful warriors of the seven mountains in the province had already been killed. Little hope remained.
<br><br>
But as soon as he arrived at the Tiger Peace City, he saw Pearce and the others descend.
<br><br>
Over a hundred thousand Oneness Guards and Other Shore Realm warriors were also there.
<br><br>
One couldn't even tell that they had just come from a fierce battle against the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
It seemed they had even managed to completely dodge the Nine-Sun World Destruction.
<br><br>
The man from the Origin Mountain was both excited and confused. But when he saw Zen bringing in with him many members of the Sun Crow race, his face changed color—he had no clue that the Sun Crow race had already surrendered to Zen.
<br><br>
Knowing that it wasn't the right time to satisfy his curiosity, he immediately rushed to Pearce. "Sir, the Bearing race is invading the Oneness Sky palace from the south!"
<br><br>
"What did you say? They've broken through the Dragon Cliff?" The news made Pearce's face turn cold.
<br><br>
Athemar, Goran, and the mountain leaders turned grim as well.
<br><br>
"Patton should be guarding the Dragon Cliff. Is it possible that he…"
<br><br>
Athemar mumbled and trailed off.
<br><br>
The man from the Origin Mountain cupped his hands as he said, "It is said that Governor Patton has died."
<br><br>
Hearing that, several Oneness Governors shut their eyes, revealing pained expressions.
<br><br>
"Where are they now?" Pearce asked once again.
<br><br>
"They've gone to the Oneness Mountain. They're probably besieging and attacking the Phoenix Palace now…They mean to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi," answered the man.
<br><br>
Anger flashed through Pearce's eyes. "Oneness Guards, remain in the Tiger Peace City. The leader of every mountain, along with your people, follow me into the transmission array!"
<br><br>
The transmission capability of this array in the Tiger Peace City was rather limited. Now that the Phoenix Palace was in danger, Pearce was anxious.
<br><br>
He decided to send the most powerful warriors back first.
<br><br>
The Bearing race had destroyed the transmission array beside the Dragon Shadow Pavilion in the Dragon City. As a result, the array in this city could only transmit this particular group of people to the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Soon, many powerful warriors began emerging from the beacon platform of the Origin Mountain, one after another.
<br><br>
The powerful warriors from the seven mountains hadn't suffered great casualties. Over eighty people still remained. Zen had dozens of members of the Sun Crow race behind him, and the Oneness Generals were also transmitted there.
<br><br>
Once everyone arrived, they headed straight for the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
"Receive my great halberd!"
<br><br>
A man in black armor from the Bearing race threw his halberd into the air.
<br><br>
Countless purple-black halberds began shooting down from the air like a rainstorm, crazily tearing at the Three-Element Sword Array.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! When all the halberds dropped, they made a deafening sound, making terrifying power erupt in the explosion.
<br><br>
The Bearing race's powerful warriors launched their attacks in turns.
<br><br>
Flamine struggled to hold on, but she was clearly nearing her limit. The entire Three-Element Sword Array was like a candle in the wind that could break at any time.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Once the long halberds exploded, a great crack appeared in the middle of the Heaven Sword in Flamine's hand before it broke. In the next moment, Flamine spat out a mouthful of blood.
<br><br>
The two powerful warriors holding the Earth Sword and the Human sword in their hands also began spitting out blood. One of them even fainted to the ground.
<br><br>
And so the Three-element Sword Array was destroyed.
<br><br>
"Haha!"
<br><br>
Hancock laughed at the scene. "Friends, we shall kill all the people in front of the Phoenix Palace, and then we will take down Eastern Emperor Taiyi!"
<br><br>
The powerful warriors of the Bearing race gazed down with sinister smiles.
<br><br>
To them, their opponents were weak, consisting mostly of women and children. It was enough of a miracle that Flamine could even resist them with a sword array for so long.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Seven powerful warriors of the Bearing race then rushed out, clad in black clothes and hats—they were from the Black Jade Clan of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Even though the members of the clan had joined the Sky Guard Pavilion, they had a style of their own.
<br><br>
Seeing the seven members of the Black Jade Clan rushing down, the golden-armored guards in front of the Supreme Dragon Hall burst into a deafening roar.
<br><br>
"We will protect our emperor with our lives! We will stand guard till death! Kill them!"
<br><br>
The guards at the Phoenix Palace were merely elites selected from the fivestar Oneness Guards. In truth, it was still a question whether or not they were truly qualified to even be deemed as elites.
<br><br>
A considerate part of the five-star Oneness Guards were above guarding the Phoenix Palace, after all.
<br><br>
In most people's eyes, the palace was absolutely safe. To stay there was no different from living in retirement, some thought. It was nearly impossible for a guard to grow from working there.
<br><br>
No one had ever expected the Oneness Sky Palace to fall into such a desperate situation in a short time.
<br><br>
"Gee..."
<br><br>
"I haven't seen such innocent cannon fodder in a long time."
<br><br>
"I'm warning you! You'd better not get any blood on my clothes!"
<br><br>
After quietly exchanging a few words with each other, the seven members of the Black Jade Clan rushed toward the Oneness Guards like eagles after their prey.
<br><br>
The one in the lead twisted his body, transforming into a black cyclone.
<br><br>
Regardless of where the cyclone passed, all sorts of broken limbs flew in the air, and blood splattered the area.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the other six launched their own fierce attacks. The five-star Oneness Guards couldn't hold on for even half a round before the powerful warriors.
<br><br>
Tick…tick…tick… Blood began falling like rain.
<br><br>
Dripping onto the eaves of the Phoenix Palace, it slid down the stairs.
<br><br>
People began screaming and running off.
<br><br>
On the stairs sat Elvinia, indifferent to the blood splattering on her body.
<br><br>
She examined the broken limbs and blood falling from the sky, her eyes full of gloom.
<br><br>
"Why are you still here?" she asked.
<br><br>
At her foot sat Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid we can't leave," Lavender answered, pointing to somewhere nearby.
<br><br>
While she wasn't exactly stronger than these people, her vision was still sharp.
<br><br>
As early as the destruction of the sword array, some people began making use of the messy situation to escape. But soon after they rushed out, purple spear radiance descended, piercing through their bodies—the Bearing race intended to kill each and every one of them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3674 Rescue It only took less than thirty seconds before over a thousand golden armored guards had been killed.
<br><br>
At that point, there were only two to three hundred people left on the steps of the Supreme Dragon Hall. Most of them were the children of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Moreover, there were also a few maids among them.
<br><br>
Flamine had been controlling the Three-Element Sword Array for quite some time now. Undoubtedly, this had her feeling extremely exhausted. No matter how desperate it might seem, she had no choice but to keep on fighting.
<br><br>
Splash! The Sun Crow race's divine flames burned brightly upon her face. Slowly, she rose in the air and prepared for an attack. The divine flames turned into a flame phoenix. It spread its marvelous wings and soared towards the seven people.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
Without a second thought, Cleon and the others took out their Other Shore Tokens as well.
<br><br>
Among the children of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Elvinia, Cleon, Chance and another four were at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Even though they had already accepted the fact that they were no match for those powerful beings, all they could do now was leap into the breach. In any case, there was no way out of it so they had to fight with all their might.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
As Elvinia watched her mother's back, her weary face was suddenly filled with burning determination. With that, she also jumped upwards and followed Flamine.
<br><br>
At this point, all of the powerful concubines had taken out their own Other Shore Tokens. They were completely ready to fight for their lives.
<br><br>
Jean was previously in a state of panic. But as soon as she saw her sons join the fray, all of her fears vanished. She no longer had any care in the world and was now prepared to risk everything. With that, she also joined the other warriors.
<br><br>
The leader of those from the Black Jade Clan was clad in all black. To him, Eastern Emperor Taiyi's family members merely seemed pathetic with their hopeless attempt to fight back. He sneered as he saw them charging towards him and his group. "Don't show any mercy. Kill them all!" he ordered them with such apathy and arrogance.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As soon as he said that, he stretched out his hands and soared towards Flamine.
<br><br>
The divine flames of Flamine were extremely sharp. However, her energy had been severely depleted while she was controlling the Three-Element Sword Array. She had not regained much energy since then, so her face was still deathly pale. When she directed the fire phoenix to attack the man in black, the man's eyes glinted with a bright green light. Almost simultaneously, he launched a soul attack towards Flamine.
<br><br>
Flamine had already reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul.
<br><br>
Therefore, her soul was extremely stable. Under normal circumstances, she would not be afraid of the soul attack at all. However, she was utterly exhausted now. So now, she could not withstand it.
<br><br>
When the soul attack hit her, she instantly felt dizzy. Seeing this, the man in black took advantage of this window of opportunity to get near her.
<br><br>
He had a dagger equipped in both of his hands. He used them to attack and aimed them at Flamine's neck.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Even though the two daggers seemed plain and ordinary, their explosive power was actually insanely terrifying.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Flamine was a well-known master. After countless years of nurture, the Chaotic Source Spirits in her body had been absolutely strong.
<br><br>
Her seemingly delicate neck had effectively withstood the attack.
<br><br>
But as the Chaotic Source Spirits helped her block the damage, they instantly felt worn-out. If she was slashed with those daggers again, she would definitely die.
<br><br>
Good thing she finally regained her consciousness at the most critical moment. Flamine gritted her teeth and swerved. She stretched out her hand and gave a sudden blow.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
The divine flames looked like petals attached to her palm. With a gentle flick, the heat evaporated instantly. The man in black's initial plan was to launch another slashing attack. But right now, he had no choice but to fall back for a bit.
<br><br>
However, he only took a step back and vanished. With the speed of light, he immediately reappeared behind Flamine, stabbing one dagger deeply into her back.
<br><br>
Puff! Just as the other dagger was about to slash at her head, a figure rushed towards them. "Mother!" the other person cried out in shock and fear.
<br><br>
Flamine was in extreme pain from the attack. Now, she also looked very anxious when she heard Elvinia's voice. This was not the battle Elvinia could participate in! But at this moment, Elvinia didn't care about anything else. She had to save her mother! She activated the power of the Other Shore Token in her body and quickly held onto the man's arm as tightly as she could! "Unhand me!" the man in black commanded.
<br><br>
He didn't expect that Elvinia would appear out of nowhere. In his anger, he gathered his strength in his arm and instantly struck her with his elbow.
<br><br>
Undoubtedly, a warrior with such terrifying power could easily split mountains and earth with his strength. This elbow strike contained over ten thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
The blow hit Elvinia's chest. In an instant, she went limp and fell down from the sky like a stone sinking into deep water.
<br><br>
"No! Elvinia!"
<br><br>
Flamine screamed in pain and anguish.
<br><br>
Seeing her daughter struck down, she released even more blazing divine flames. She intended to use them to envelop the man in black. However, he seemed to have expected this. He merely leaped back a little and a green light flashed in his eyes again. It was another incoming soul attack! This made Flamine feel dizzy again. In addition to that, the man in black thrust the two daggers simultaneously towards her head.
<br><br>
Since Flamine couldn't withstand the soul attack, she wouldn't be able to avoid the two daggers as well. It looked like there was no escape. She was now staring death right in the face.
<br><br>
Just as the daggers were about to pierce through her head, a flying sword came out of nowhere. It appeared as though it had been thrown from afar.
<br><br>
The flying sword was flickering as though it was shuttling through space in such an incredible speed.
<br><br>
Cling! Cling! The flying sword hit the two daggers with such unbelievable accuracy. It effectively stopped the attack as the daggers rebounded.
<br><br>
"Who in the world threw that?!"
<br><br>
Anger was written all over the man's face. He had the perfect opportunity to finish off Flamine.
<br><br>
He believed that the Bearing race already had full control of the situation.
<br><br>
The Dark Jade Clan just had to deal with all the family members of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. It never crossed his mind that there would be any other changes to their original plan.
<br><br>
However, he was immediately dumbfounded as he angrily looked toward the direction of the flying sword and saw who had interfered.
<br><br>
There, in the distance, was Pearce who approached them swiftly along with the other six mountain leaders. Beside Pearce were the three evil eyes that Auden had summoned. He was the one who thrust the flying sword.
<br><br>
The man in black was not the only one who was stunned by this unexpected turn of events.
<br><br>
Hancock and the others were watching the scene unfold while they were in the air. They were flabbergasted when they saw lots of people from the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Isn't the main force of the Oneness Sky Palace currently being suppressed by the Sun Crow race? What happened?" one of them asked confusedly.
<br><br>
"There's no doubt that the Sun Crow race has the ability to obliterate them all!"
<br><br>
"But how are they here? Did something happen?"
<br><br>
There were only over forty people from the Bearing race left. Meanwhile, the number of people from the Oneness Sky Palace was twice as big.
<br><br>
When it came to sheer strength, the people from the Bearing race were extremely powerful. However, they were not the strongest group of the Bearing race. And now, they were clearly outnumbered.
<br><br>
Realizing this, they immediately felt desperate. The situation suddenly turned bleak and it seemed like the tide had turned against them.
<br><br>
At that very moment, another group was fast approaching from the other side.
<br><br>
As Hancock and the others took a closer look, they felt overjoyed. It looked like they had a chance after all because the members of the Sun Crow race were coming! In addition to that, they had also seen Micah and Bagot in the group.
<br><br>
"Hooray! It's the Sun Crow race!" shouted one of the members of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"Their timing is absolutely perfect!"
<br><br>
"Whew! We are saved. As long as we join hands with the Sun Crow race, we will be able to defeat the Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
However, they didn't know that Gethin had the same thought before.
<br><br>
"Micah, we..."
<br><br>
Hancock looked at him admiringly. After all, the strength and status of Micah were far greater and higher than his. Even Ware, who led the team here this time, couldn't quite compare to Micah's might and prowess.
<br><br>
But before Hancock could even finish his sentence, he noticed another figure standing in front of Micah. It was none other than Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's face was drained of color when he saw Elvinia lying motionlessly on the ground. He didn't know whether she was alive or dead.
<br><br>
He had initially thought that the Phoenix Palace was the safest place to go, so he let Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly stay here. Clearly, he wasn't expecting that Eastern Emperor Taiyi would be trapped and the Bearing race would launch a sneak attack on the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
"Slaughter them all," Zen commanded mercilessly.
<br><br>
"Yes, sir! Right away!"
<br><br>
Micah, Bagot, and the others answered without any second thoughts.
<br><br>
The longer the modified blood stayed in their bodies, the more loyal they became to Emperor Charm and Zen. This was the true power of bloodline worship.
<br><br>
Chapter 3675 Starlight Witness Hancock and the other members of the Bearing race were frozen in shock upon hearing the Sun Crows' answer to Zen's order.
<br><br>
Did they hear correctly? Were these Sun Crows fake? Were they merely disguised by humans who wore feathered wings on their backs? It was all extremely confusing.
<br><br>
However, the auras Micah, Bagot, and Elizabeth exuded shattered all their speculations.
<br><br>
These people were all genuine members of the Sun Crow race. There was no doubt about it! "Micah, you..."
<br><br>
"Bagot, we've met each other before!"
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Hancock and the others continued to plead for their lives but the Sun Crows turned a deaf ear to their cries.
<br><br>
How could the Bearing race hold on to their hopes when things had come to this?! "There's no way we can win this right now. We're outnumbered! Retreat!"
<br><br>
"Run!"
<br><br>
"It was all in vain!"
<br><br>
Just as they were about to escape using the Grand Teleportation technique, a pale, white light flashed over the Oneness Mountain. The Cage of Heaven and Earth worked.
<br><br>
Their only road out was now blocked.
<br><br>
"No! Why can't we leave..."
<br><br>
"Block their attacks!"
<br><br>
"Retreat! Retreat!"
<br><br>
Hancock was declared leader upon Ware's death but he failed to live up to the title.
<br><br>
Though the Bearing race stood calm when bullying Flamine and others earlier, they were an utter mess when facing against these masters of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
In the air, all kinds of powerful energy constantly surged.
<br><br>
Despite its big size, the Oneness Mountain shook and trembled underneath their feet due to the attacks.
<br><br>
Flamine descended from the sky. Her chest had been stabbed through and blood burst out from her body like a fountain, but she just flew downwards as if she didn't feel any pain from her wound.
<br><br>
It was far beyond Elvinia's cultivation level to take that blow.
<br><br>
As Elvinia fell down from the air, Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly immediately surrounded her. She didn't seem to be seriously injured but she was unconscious and that scared them.
<br><br>
Flamine reached out and gently scratched Elvinia's arm, leaving a small scar on Elvinia's skin. She frowned and pressed her hand on Elvinia's forehead, looking gloomier.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, is she all right?" Nelly asked, her face marred with worry.
<br><br>
To their dismay, Flamine shook her head.
<br><br>
Elvinia's body was able to withstand the blow.
<br><br>
However, her soul was an entirely different matter. It seemed to have been severely injured from the vibrations.
<br><br>
Flamine knew her soul had reached its limit but she still squeezed out her own Soul of Light in order to activate a secret soul technique that might nourish Elvinia's soul.
<br><br>
As Flamine did so, the three women took this chance to observe the sky.
<br><br>
They were grateful to see Zen return safely.
<br><br>
However, the sight of him ordering the masters of the Sun Crow race made them all gasp.
<br><br>
They absolutely believed in Zen's talent but there was no way he could order around all those powerful Sun Crow warriors, right? Their auras were in no way inferior to Flamine's. It was impossible! Or was it? "I thought I stood a chance to catch up with him in the Phoenix Palace,"
<br><br>
Nelly said but she shook her head and smiled at the realization that she overestimated herself.
<br><br>
"I never think that way," Lavender said, knowing well just how talented Zen was.
<br><br>
Among the three of them, Lavender had been the one by his side the longest. She, of all people, knew of his rapid growth. Logically speaking, the longer one cultivated, the more difficult it would be to progress. Zen, ever the enigma, just chose to progress with his growth faster! As the Sun Crow race took the lead in launching their attack, Pearce and Auden also led the masters of the Oneness Sky Palace to make a move.
<br><br>
Whether it was by numbers or sheer power, the Bearing race was at an absolute disadvantage.
<br><br>
However, the seven warriors from the Black Jade Clan still showed their high combat effectiveness. Their Other Shore Tokens appeared as white porcelain fragments above their heads that could form a sort of unique shield when combined.
<br><br>
This shield of thick porcelain could serve as protection for the Bearing race and help them out of their situation.
<br><br>
So even if the fight had been going on for five minutes, only five members of the Bearing race were killed.
<br><br>
The shield, however, wasn't indestructible. It could delay immediate death and give the Bearing race some time but it was bound to give up at some point. There was no way it could block the combined force of the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace forever. So long as the Cage of Heaven and Earth remained working, then the Bearing race was doomed to die here.
<br><br>
Despair filled Hancock and his warriors at their hopeless situation.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, something else was also happening in the northwest of the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
The Oneness Guards and the Other Shore Realm warriors had chosen to stay in Tiger Peace City to await further instructions.
<br><br>
They were quite relaxed since the rest of the battle had nothing to do with them. They could contentedly lay back in comfort and safety despite having narrowly escaped death not too long ago.
<br><br>
"How dare the Bearing race attack the Oneness Mountain?!"
<br><br>
"Since Master Pearce has led the troops to go back, they will surely die miserably!"
<br><br>
"I hope the Oneness Sky Palace can survive this calamity safely..."
<br><br>
Just as they discussed this, numerous strange squares began to appear above the Tiger Peace City.
<br><br>
These squares emitted a dazzling blue light that immediately attracted everyone's attention.
<br><br>
After a short while, the squares morphed and materialized into the shape of a young man with wings. His features slowly solidified and everyone saw that he had fine eyebrows, slender eyes, and an air of delicate beauty. He was none other than Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
He merely glanced at the people below ...
<br><br>
Tens of thousands of soldiers, including the Oneness Guards and the warriors at the Other Shore Realm, could only stand frozen in place by his sudden appearance.
<br><br>
Each one of them was nothing more than dust and insignificant ants in front of this powerful emperor.
<br><br>
This was Emperor Charm's strength. He didn't need to make his identity known nor release any special aura. All he needed to do was to look at those below him and they would freeze.
<br><br>
He eventually withdrew his gaze to stretch out his white palm wherein a small cube appeared. There was a world within that cube and the scene within it revealed the fighting that went on in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
His royal guards were currently killing the members of the Bearing race alongside the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
His face revealed a puzzled expression.
<br><br>
'Elizabeth, Micah, Bagot, why did you betray me?' He wasn't angry. Truth be told, he felt more confused than angry.
<br><br>
With the support of the bloodline worship, Emperor Charm was certain of Elizabeth's and Micah's absolute loyalty. There was no way they would ever betray him.
<br><br>
There was definitely something more to this! This entire situation was confusing to him, including the fact that Zen had shot down his suns! Now that he personally came here to the Bloom Divine Province, he expected the truth to be revealed soon enough.
<br><br>
As he held his square world on one hand, he summoned an Other Shore Token in the other. It was an azure spear, translucent from tip to body like crystal ice.
<br><br>
This was his Starlight Tracking Spear, a unique Other Shore Token he dug out from Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
"Starlight Witness,"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm said.
<br><br>
A few dots of starlight flashed above the Bloom Divine Province despite it being daytime. These dots of starlight promptly shot down and appeared above the heads of leaders of the Bright Mountain, the Ivory Mountain, the Azure Mountain, and the Golden Mountain.
<br><br>
Chapter 3676 Wantonly Killing Bright, twinkling stars floated above the four mountain leaders' heads, and they couldn't help but look at them in astonishment.
<br><br>
"What are these stars?"
<br><br>
"They seem to come from some Other Shore Token. I can feel their aura!"
<br><br>
"Why is an Other Shore Token here?"
<br><br>
While the four mountain leaders were quite confused, Elizabeth, Micah, and Bagot all gazed at the stars with shock.
<br><br>
"It's the Starlight Witness," Elizabeth whispered. A warrior like Emperor Charm didn't usually engage in battles even once for tens of thousands of years.
<br><br>
That was why nobody knew about his Starlight Tracking Spear, although he had owned it for thousands of years already. Only the closest people to him knew about it, such as Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Thus, they knew that Emperor Charm had already arrived in the Bloom Divine Province when the starlight appeared.
<br><br>
After a while of being amazed at the starlight, the four mountain leaders quickly became cautious.
<br><br>
They were all old warriors that had lived for many years, so their innate fighting instincts told them that those stars weren't as simple as they seemed.
<br><br>
Furthermore, lots of Other Shore Tokens had strange abilities, and any negligence on their part might lead to their doom.
<br><br>
"No matter what they are, do protect yourselves!" the leader of the Azure Mountain declared as he beat his chest hard.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A flurry of thunderstorms materialized and enveloped him entirely.
<br><br>
The thunderstorms spread to a radius of a thousand feet around him and formed an absolute energy zone. It destroyed anything that passed through its area.
<br><br>
The leader of the Ivory Mountain brandished his sword, and then sword shadows appeared continuously. Countless sword shadows grew rapidly like weeds and tightly wrapped around him.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Bright Mountain and the Golden Mountain also followed suit and used their own methods to protect themselves.
<br><br>
Because of the starlight, the masters who had been chasing the Bearing race stopped for the time being.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race temporarily had a chance to breathe, but they were confused. They didn't know why the Oneness Sky Palace suddenly stopped.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Just then, a square-shaped object appeared in the sky.
<br><br>
Something had crossed the space and moved above the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
The Oneness Mountain had already been covered by the Cage of Heaven and Earth. Even powerful masters like Auden and Micah couldn't use the Grand Teleportation. After all, there weren't many people in the world who could completely ignore the Cage of Heaven and Earth.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The square shook as a blurry dark figure appeared. The figure looked like it had a pair of wings that were several hundred feet wide, and an azure spear.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Just as the figure came into view, it also instantly disappeared.
<br><br>
Crack! The next moment, everyone saw that the blurry figure had rushed towards the leader of the Azure Mountain.
<br><br>
Alas, his thunderstorms that could tear anything apart couldn't do anything to stop it.
<br><br>
At that moment, the leader of the Azure Mountain felt an extremely powerful aura, and instinctively thought that he would die.
<br><br>
Puff! The azure spear pierced through his body.
<br><br>
When the tip of the spear penetrated his body, he only felt that it took away everything he had. His strength, soul, consciousness, will, and spirit no longer belonged to him.
<br><br>
The azure spear didn't stop after it pierced through the leader of the Azure Mountain.
<br><br>
Before the blurry figure pulled out the tip of the spear from his body, it weirdly disappeared. Then, it stabbed the body of the Ivory Mountain's leader next.
<br><br>
Puff! It penetrated, disappeared, and appeared...
<br><br>
In the next second, the spear skewered the leader of the Golden Mountain.
<br><br>
The four leaders died in succession.
<br><br>
However, none of the dead leaders nor the others noticed the order of killing.
<br><br>
They only saw four azure spear lights flash and pierce through the bodies of the four leaders at the same time. After the four leaders had died, the figure with huge wings appeared again.
<br><br>
Only then did they see its face. It was Emperor Charm of the Sun Crow race! Hancock and his companions cried out desperately as they ran for their lives. When they finally saw Emperor Charm, they felt a glimmer of hope amidst a crisis.
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm!"
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm of the Sun Crow race is here in person!"
<br><br>
"Thank heavens! We're finally saved!"
<br><br>
Of course, the people of the Oneness Sky Palace were worried and in a state of panic.
<br><br>
There was no one who could fight Emperor Charm except for Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
If they were well prepared, the leaders of the six mountains might be able to fight him.
<br><br>
Yet, Emperor Charm acted quickly and swiftly killed the leaders of four mountains just now.
<br><br>
Although there were many powerful warriors present, who could fight him head-on? Meanwhile, Emperor Charm floated in the air. As he slowly spread out his wings, a golden disk shadow appeared behind him. It was the faith object of the Sun Crow race, the sun totem.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
All the members of the Sun Crow race knelt when the sun totem came to light.
<br><br>
It was their rule that had existed for countless years, and they couldn't disobey it.
<br><br>
The members of the Sun Crow race, such as Elizabeth, Micah, and Bagot, also felt their legs tremble and were about to bend down when they saw the golden sun shadow.
<br><br>
But their instincts restricted them.
<br><br>
All of the people of the Sun Crow race suffered. Their bodies convulsed as their instincts fought with their limbs.
<br><br>
In the end, they didn't kneel. Their instincts had gained the upper hand.
<br><br>
Disappointment was written all over Emperor Charm's face when he saw Elizabeth, Micah, and the rest of them float in the air motionlessly.
<br><br>
Micah, Bagot, and the other members of the Sun Crow race were silent.
<br><br>
They didn't betray Emperor Charm, but the one in front of them.
<br><br>
When Emperor Charm received no answers, he didn't force them.
<br><br>
He raised his azure spear horizontally, and starlight spread throughout the sky once again.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
This time, seven rays of starlight appeared above the heads of the seven powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The people of the Oneness Sky Palace were still not over the deaths of the four mountain leaders.
<br><br>
Naturally, they clearly knew that the starlight above their heads would kill them.
<br><br>
Whoosh! When a member of the Ivory Mountain saw the starlight above his head, his face paled, and he impulsively ran away.
<br><br>
The other six did the same. They either used a secret technique to strengthen themselves or chose to escape.
<br><br>
While they were fleeing, Emperor Charm raised the heavy azure spear in his hand.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Everyone saw the spear stab all seven of them at the same time.
<br><br>
Such a killing method was powerful and overbearing, almost irresistible.
<br><br>
The people of the Oneness Sky Palace felt desolate. They were like a group of helpless lambs, unable to do anything to Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm, who had killed the seven people, flew back up the sky once again. He held his azure spear indifferently and chose his next target.
<br><br>
Chapter 3677 Fight Back In general, these warriors were powerful enough to dominate any province in the Source World.
<br><br>
However, their lives were in Emperor Charm's hands.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Another starlight descended and landed above the head of a bald man.
<br><br>
The bald man was called Norbert Chen, a close friend of the Ivory Mountain's leader.
<br><br>
His eyes were still bloodshot as he hadn't recovered from having watched Emperor Charm kill the mountain leader.
<br><br>
Now that the starlight fell above his head, the veins in his temples popped out and he roared, "This winged demon is attacking our Oneness Sky Palace! I will try my best to fight him!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Then, he stomped his feet in the air, which distorted the space beneath him.
<br><br>
His Other Shore Token appeared on his right hand. It was a tiger-shaped gauntlet.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
He rushed towards Emperor Charm as the tiger's eyes on his gauntlet turned red, and an immense power gathered within it.
<br><br>
His Other Shore Token was of strengthening type, which came from Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, he had more than one Other Shore Token! Aside from his tiger-shaped gauntlet, he also had another Other Shore Token in the form of a palm-sized wooden compass. He released the compass, and its needle began to spin like mad.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
In turn, Emperor Charm arched his brows at the sight of the compass.
<br><br>
Norbert Chen's tiger-shaped gauntlet was an ordinary Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Although it came from Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, it could only release a power of fifty thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the wooden compass was much more powerful! It was made of withered wood. Three compasses were discovered in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, but nobody knew who made them. Someone had guessed that the Instant Civilization had deliberately left the compasses behind as a malicious joke for the next generations.
<br><br>
The compass had three scales, and the first scale read 'one'. If the compass' needle was pointed to one, the power the owner released wouldn't change at all.
<br><br>
The second scale was zero. If the needle was pointed to zero, the power would return to zero, no matter how strong it was.
<br><br>
The third scale was three hundred! If the compass' needle was turned to three hundred, the power the owner exerted would be multiplied by three hundred times! In other words, Norbert Chen could unleash a terrifying power of three million divine megatons if he used the power of ten thousand divine megatons together with the compass! Three million divine megatons...
<br><br>
Not even the supreme masters in the Source World or the Chaos Ancient Gods could withstand such a blow.
<br><br>
If there were no other restrictions on the compass, it would probably be the strongest Other Shore Token in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore! Although there was only a one-third probability of the needle pointing to three hundred, such a force was enough to kill the opponent in an instant.
<br><br>
However, the compass itself was not a descending type of Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
It meant that the physical body that released the power had to bear all the power first.
<br><br>
In theory, it might be great to increase one's strength by three hundred times, but in reality, that amount of power could cause the owner's physical body to collapse.
<br><br>
Despite that, there was still a way to release a certain part of the power even if the physical body collapsed.
<br><br>
Someone had tried it before Norbert Chen.
<br><br>
There was a time when the leader of the Mountain Monkey race in the Source World had carried this compass. The Mountain Monkey race was a small race, located beside the Separate Abyss race. The Separate Abyss race had oppressed them for generations. During one battle, the leader of the Mountain Monkey race finally made use of this compass. At the same time, he employed another Other Shore Token, the Paramount Sky Bead! His body collapsed after he had used such an uncontrollable force, but the Paramount Sky Bead flew straight and smashed the leader of the Separate Abyss race to death.
<br><br>
It was safe to say that it was a compelling Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race had destroyed the Mountain Monkey race later on, but they had fought to the death until the end.
<br><br>
Therefore, the powerful masters of the Source World also knew what the compass was for. It was used for desperate moments in battle! "Strength! Gather!" Norbert Chen roared.
<br><br>
The tiger-shaped gauntlet on his hand continuously released surging amounts of power.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
After a while, the compass finally stopped. The needle on the compass slid past zero, past one, and finally stopped at the scale of three hundred.
<br><br>
"Swoosh..."
<br><br>
Under the influence of the compass, the power in the tiger-shaped gauntlet quickly increased.
<br><br>
The tiger-shaped gauntlet's strength had originally reached sixty thousand divine megatons, but after it multiplied three hundred, it reached up to eighteen million divine megatons.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
The power's immense pressure even caused the space locked up in the Cage of Heaven and Earth to collapse.
<br><br>
Norbert Chen was filled with grief when he saw that the mountain leader was dead. Now that he had chosen to fight desperately, how could he even hesitate? "Sky Splitting Attack! Go to hell!" he shouted.
<br><br>
Just as he uttered those words, he had already erupted eighteen million divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Even the Chaotic Source Spirits that he had nurtured for many years immediately dimmed and became exhausted.
<br><br>
Yet, his attack also burst along the tiger-shaped gauntlet at the same time! "Boom!"
<br><br>
A tiger-shaped fist shadow suddenly came out of his right hand and sent out a violent punch.
<br><br>
His current choice was more tragic and terrifying than burning the Other Shore Token. It was a much fiercer desperate battle.
<br><br>
The punch was so strong that its impact shook the entire Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
The tremors were felt even in the mountain far away, where the disciples of the three sword sects felt their legs weaken as they sat on the ground.
<br><br>
Lastly, the tiger-shaped fist tore up everything in its way and rushed towards Emperor Charm at top speed.
<br><br>
"The power of this punch is enough to kill Emperor Charm, isn't it?"
<br><br>
"Truly. Norbert Chen is not famous in the Ivory Mountain, but he could still launch such a powerful attack before his death..."
<br><br>
"Millions of divine megatons of power. That Other Shore Token is really amazing!"
<br><br>
Although the power was terrifying, Emperor Charm still had an indifferent expression on his face.
<br><br>
"No matter how powerful his strength is, it is useless if he fails to hit the target."
<br><br>
Just as the tiger-shaped fist shadow approached Emperor Charm, Emperor Charm's body once again turned into fist-sized squares.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race was good at flames and space. This destructive punch was indeed unable to hit Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
But just as Emperor Charm was about to leave, two more people appeared not far away from him.
<br><br>
One of them grabbed a leaf.
<br><br>
That leaf turned out to be the Grand Hidden Leaf! Under the leaf's cover, even a powerful and agile man like Emperor Charm didn't notice that the two of them had approached him.
<br><br>
The other man had a small black snake in his hand.
<br><br>
The little snake was a creature from Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The man and the snake had been together for so many years, and they shared a very deep relationship. He had even found a woman's body for the black snake, taught her to read and speak, and even married her.
<br><br>
At this moment of life and death, he and the little snake chose to fight until their end.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
The little snake's whole body burned hotly, and then it quickly bit Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm had planned to use the space theurgy to leave, but the little snake bit him, and the bite paralyzed his body. The space theurgy didn't work anymore, and the blue squares disappeared one by one.
<br><br>
Almost all the powerful warriors at present were top masters who had crossed Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. Thus, how could he kill them all at will? Chapter 3678 Duplicating Gemstone The tiger-shaped fist shadow zoomed and quickly rushed towards Emperor Charm. Because of the immense force, the surrounding space was constantly twisted and broken, forming a curved "bubble".
<br><br>
As the "bubble" approached quickly, a worried expression finally took form in Emperor Charm's face. He squinted his eyes and clenched his fists, as if anticipating the incoming danger.
<br><br>
He knew if this punch hit him, he would surely be smashed to pieces! The light in his eyes flickered and he tried to forcibly teleport away.
<br><br>
However, those small squares disappeared as soon as they appeared. After being bitten by the black snake, he had lost the ability to escape! This was how the battle between the strong was like.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful a warrior was in the Source World, they would still have setbacks if they were to encounter some special abilities. And indeed, Emperor Charm was in the middle of this situation.
<br><br>
If the "Heart of Accomplice" hadn't been used to kill Ware before, Emperor Charm would have been dead by now.
<br><br>
In the same way, Emperor Charm's Starlight Tracking Spear was also a very special killing weapon. This spear could only kill the people who were targeted by the Starlight Witness, and anyone who was targeted would be killed in one strike. That was how the Starlight Tracking Spear had directly killed the leaders of the several mountains before they could even react! But now, ironically, Emperor Charm was facing the same problem. The two warriors from the Ivory Mountain got close to him in a strange way, as if sneaking up to him. And then, one of them used the little black snake to bite him. Emperor Charm couldn't figure out the ability of the little black snake, so he couldn't break free from it. In addition to his already difficult and painful situation, with the powerful punch from Norbert, he was bound to die.
<br><br>
Pearce, Auden and the others of the Oneness Sky Palace looked expectant.
<br><br>
Of course, it would be great if Emperor Charm would be killed by this blow! A smirk was visible on their faces and their eyes were gleaming and hopeful.
<br><br>
A trace of anxiety appeared on Emperor Charm's face. As he gritted his teeth, a small gemstone suddenly appeared from the spot between his eyebrows. This gemstone was also an Other Shore Token. After it appeared, it shot upwards.
<br><br>
Just after the small gemstone left him, the tiger-shaped fist shadow had already approached him and hit his body head-on.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
The eighteen million divine megatons of force was by no means something a physical body could resist.
<br><br>
Under the gaze of everyone around, Emperor Charm turned into a cloud of dust and quickly dissipated. The tiger-shaped fist shadow continued to fluctuate diagonally upwards, shooting into the distance.
<br><br>
There were gasps and sighs of relief. "He made it!"
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm just got killed?"
<br><br>
"It's unbelievable!"
<br><br>
A trace of joy appeared on the faces of the people from the Oneness Sky Palace. The scene they had witnessed before their own eyes was beyond their imaginations. It was simply unbelievable. Regardless, the people felt as though a burden had been lifted from their shoulders.
<br><br>
The members of the Sun Crow race, however, were silent. In their consciousness, the death of Emperor Charm was the biggest grief to them.
<br><br>
Those members of the Bearing race all paled.
<br><br>
They had been hoping for Emperor Charm to help them out. Who would have thought that the powerful Emperor Charm would be smashed into pieces by one punch? However, most of them had missed the gemstone that was flying in the air.
<br><br>
After the gemstone flew away in a distance, it suddenly emitted a green light. The green light quickly became intense, and Emperor Charm, who had already been turned to dust, once again was reborn from the green light.
<br><br>
The joy on the faces of the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace was unmistakable. This happiness, however, only lasted for a few seconds before their expressions turned into astounded looks.
<br><br>
Zen, who was watching the scene from below, also had a puzzled expression in his eyes. He couldn't comprehend what had just happened.
<br><br>
"It's so strange. Emperor Charm should already have been killed."
<br><br>
The scene just now was definitely not an illusion. The tiger-shaped fist shadow clearly had smashed Emperor Charm into smithereens like crushing dry weeds.
<br><br>
"Those who have entered Stage Thirty-three naturally have a couple of tricks up their sleeves to save their lives. That Duplicating Gemstone is not rare in the Heavenly Treasure Cave. It can perfectly duplicate oneself after being carried. It is equivalent to gaining an extra life," explained Houyi.
<br><br>
"Duplicating Gemstone? Perfectly duplicate oneself?" Zen was stunned and confused. "Then if one gets a few more of the Duplicating Gemstones, won't that make them immortal?"
<br><br>
This was something new to Zen: the ability to perfectly copy oneself. Such Other Shore Tokens were simply too powerful. And according to Houyi, there seemed to be a great number of them? "Everyone can only carry one of such gemstone. If it is used, then you will not be qualified to carry a second one," Emperor Charm in his mind added concisely.
<br><br>
Such a treasure was precious, but everyone only had one chance to use it.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm had relied on the Duplicating Gemstone to avoid the calamity of death, and in this case, he had already used his one chance with the precious gemstone.
<br><br>
He looked down at the people below him angrily, the muscles on his face stiff. "If it weren't for my special trick, I would have been killed by you on the spot today!"
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The Starlight Tracking Spear in his hand shook again. It made an eerie buzzing sound, and then six rays of starlight descended.
<br><br>
Norbert had collapsed and died because he had unleashed a too great power.
<br><br>
The warrior who had taken out the little black snake was also burned to death together with the snake itself. This was a result of burning his Other Shore Token. Only the warrior who provided the Grand Hidden Leaf was still alive, and one of the six rays of starlight fell directly above that person's head.
<br><br>
When the man saw the Starlight Witness above his head, all his blood left his face and he was dead pale. Out of instinct to escape, he swiftly raised the Grand Hidden Leaf. His aura was completely hidden, and he disappeared.
<br><br>
However, the Starlight Witness followed him like a shadow. No matter which direction that invisible person moved to, the Starlight Witness also moved and followed. He would never be able to escape.
<br><br>
"Since you have offended me, you must be prepared to die," Emperor Charm said as he shook the Starlight Tracking Spear. His tone was fierce and his eyes were sharp as blade.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! At the same time, six avatars of Emperor Charm appeared behind the six powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace. Then, six rays of spear radiance pierced through them.
<br><br>
After killing the six people, Emperor Charm returned to his original position.
<br><br>
It took a while before he was able to calm down and when he finally did, his face became cold and arrogant again. His eyes swept over the people below him slowly, as if he were meticulously judging each person. He was choosing a new target.
<br><br>
When his eyes swept over Zen, he paused for a moment.
<br><br>
It was this guy who had shot down his suns...
<br><br>
It had cost him a lot of energy to use the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy.
<br><br>
If it weren't for the fact that he needed to help Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch, he wouldn't have used the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy, nor would he encounter such a strange thing.
<br><br>
However, Zen had successfully aroused his interest. Emperor Charm gave out a small smile and felt a bit excited.
<br><br>
Of course, he didn't want to kill Zen this easily. On the one hand, he wanted to know what Zen had relied on to shoot down his suns. On the other hand, the group of golden red Chaotic Source Spirits was still in Zen's hands.
<br><br>
Just as Emperor Charm was choosing the next group of targets to kill, Pearce moved his lips slightly and began to communicate with the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace through life vitality.
<br><br>
Although Emperor Charm was undeniably powerful, he had his own weakness.
<br><br>
Moreover, it was impossible, and of course, illogical for these people from the Oneness Sky Palace to wait to be slaughtered like lambs.
<br><br>
After a short discussion, Pearce's face suddenly looked determined. His expression was hard and his eyes were serious and sharp. He suddenly flew at Emperor Charm who was up in the air.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The air blew as Pearce's body ascended.
<br><br>
Led by Pearce, the other powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace also flew following him.
<br><br>
If it was only one or two powerful warriors that came to fight him, Emperor Charm would not be afraid.
<br><br>
But now that most of the people were rushing towards him, he naturally needed to act with caution.
<br><br>
"A desperate struggle?"
<br><br>
Disdain appeared on Emperor Charm's face. Just as he was about to fight them, the members of the Sun Crow race also came flying straight for him.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't bear to see the strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace face Emperor Charm alone, so he gave the order to the members of the Sun Crow race to attack him together.
<br><br>
Chapter 3679 Solution As Pearce rushed at Emperor Charm, he ordered his men to remove the Cage of Heaven and Earth.
<br><br>
The cage was only capable of trapping the members of the Bearing race, and would be ineffective against Emperor Charm. In fact, it restricted the activities of their own people.
<br><br>
It was Pearce's first encounter with the Starlight Tracking Spear and although he did not know its origin, he kept guessing at it.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful an Other Shore Token was, there was always a way to destroy it! The Starlight Tracking Spear was no doubt intimidating, but there should be some rules contained within it. If he could figure out the rules, he could definitely break the spear.
<br><br>
Judging by the way Emperor Charm used it, it seemed he could only attack those whose heads were covered by the starlight.
<br><br>
So if one could avoid the starlight, one would avoid Emperor Charm's attack too.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
With the sudden tremor of the space, the Cage of Heaven and Earth was removed.
<br><br>
Pearce was well prepared, disappearing the second the cage was lifted. He then reappeared behind Emperor Charm, faster than the eye could see.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm hadn't expected the cage to be removed so suddenly. He was even more surprised at Pearce's bold head-on attack! He had forgotten...
<br><br>
that the powerful warriors following Eastern Emperor Taiyi were hardened from hundreds of battles. The fear of death didn't even make them flinch.
<br><br>
"Equinox Flower, bloom!"
<br><br>
A huge red flower emerged above Pearce's head in full bloom, shimmering beautifully! "Emperor Charm, this is where you'll stay for the time being,"
<br><br>
Pearce said as a space illusion enveloped Emperor Charm, trapping him inside.
<br><br>
Playing a trick of space on Emperor Charm was like juggling before a king.
<br><br>
He had little difficulty avoiding the Cage of Heaven and Earth, so this illusory space he was now in wouldn't be tough to handle.
<br><br>
Small squares appeared on the surface of his body, and he quickly shuttled through the illusory space.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
There were lights and shadows of different colors all over. Red, white, black, yellow, green, blue and purple were spread throughout as if countless dye tanks had burst and spilled into space.
<br><br>
He traveled through but could not find a way out! The powerful warriors in the sky gathered around Pearce when Emperor Charm had been trapped.
<br><br>
They could not see Emperor Charm from the outside of the Equinox Flower.
<br><br>
The Equinox Flower was capable of creating a truly strange space, formed of many layers upon layers that locked him in. This was what made it difficult for even a powerful warrior like Emperor Charm to speedily find an escape.
<br><br>
But even if he couldn't find a way out now, it certainly did not mean he would never find one.
<br><br>
"I can't hold him in for too long," Pearce said in a low voice, deep in focus.
<br><br>
"Only working together will allow us to deal with him effectively!"
<br><br>
Defeating a powerful warrior like Emperor Charm would prove difficult in a head-on fight.
<br><br>
However, all of the powerful warriors present had merged with unique Other Shore Tokens. If they could make good use of their Other Shore Tokens' abilities and rely on their mechanisms, they might stand a chance.
<br><br>
"His speed is too fast. There is almost no way to grab hold of him. When he gets out of Elder Pearce's illusory space, we will not be able to catch him,"
<br><br>
said a warrior from the Bright Mountain worriedly.
<br><br>
As he finished speaking, Felicity of the Origin Mountain gently waved her hand, and a small cross arrow appeared in her palm. "I have an Other Shore Token. Although it can't capture Emperor Charm, it's enough to hold him down in a certain spot!"
<br><br>
When Auden saw the cross arrow, his eyes gleamed. "That is the Heavenly Immobilizing Marker!"
<br><br>
Felicity nodded.
<br><br>
Anyone targeted by the Heavenly Immobilizing Marker would be pulled back to their original position no matter how far away they had gotten, as long as the owner held the thought in their mind.
<br><br>
As an Other Shore Token of Stage Thirty-two, the Other Shore Power it could unleash was only dozens of divine megatons. Because of this, once anyone was located by the Heavenly Immobilizing Marker, there was absolutely no possibility of getting rid of it! "That makes it a lot easier!" "When Emperor Charm escapes from the Equinox Flower, he will definitely attempt to teleport away. That's when Felicity can use her Other Shore Token to pull him back!" another middleaged man suggested.
<br><br>
As he spoke, he took out an Other Shore Token as well. It was a huge bone stick, also dug out from one of the upper stages on the Other Shore. As an Other Shore Token of strengthening type, the bone stick could unleash an astonishing power.
<br><br>
Beside the middle-aged man was an old man who held a mirror. When the middle-aged man looked into the mirror, there soon appeared his reflection, who also held a bone stick in his hand and looked powerful and majestic.
<br><br>
The warriors readied themselves to launch the fatal blow once Emperor Charm escaped the illusory space.
<br><br>
Pearce grew more and more cautious as he stared the Equinox Flower before him. "He seems to have found the flaw and is breaking through!"
<br><br>
The layers of space were like the layers of petals on a rose, tightly wrapped around the real exit.
<br><br>
But Emperor Charm's knowledge in space was remarkable and in just a few moments he had already seen through the layers and began breaking through as if bursting from a cocoon.
<br><br>
Pearce was proud to have trapped him for as long as he did.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Within the Equinox Flower, Emperor Charm casually opened the layers of space following the invisible veins. When he reached the last layer, he suddenly halted his outstretched hand. "There are a total of nine hundred and ninety-seven layers in this space. This is the last layer," he muttered to himself calmly.
<br><br>
The slightest smile broke out and a trace of mockery appeared in his eyes.
<br><br>
He did not break through the last layer, but raised the Starlight Tracking Spear in his hand.
<br><br>
Pearce's nerves were rattled as he continued to stare at Emperor Charm in the Equinox Flower. "Everyone, get ready. He is coming... Oh no!"
<br><br>
When he saw that Emperor Charm had raised the Starlight Tracking Spear, his eyes narrowed before shooting wide open again in shock and terror.
<br><br>
"Rigoberto! Atticus! You..."
<br><br>
Just then, a figure appeared on the backs of Rigoberto, Atticus and four other warriors.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! The spear pierced through the six of them.
<br><br>
Five of the six shadowy figures of Emperor Charm that stood behind them disappeared in the blink of an eye, save for the one behind Rigoberto. With a gentle flap of his wings, innumerable little squares appeared on his body and he disappeared instantaneously. The next moment, he appeared in the sky once more.
<br><br>
He had used the power of the Starlight Tracking Spear to escape the Equinox Flower, hiding behind one of six warriors as protection from any attack. Naturally, he had escaped quite easily after that.
<br><br>
He looked down at Pearce and said condescendingly, "What a childish and ridiculous game..."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he noticed a strange look on Pearce's face. Before he could finish his words, six threads suddenly emerged from his body with figures at the end of them, figures of the six he had just killed. They now looked cold and lifeless like zombies at the end of the strings.
<br><br>
Earlier, Emperor Charm had exerted six rays of Starlight Witness on those including Rigoberto, Atticus and the other four warriors.
<br><br>
Pearce had been thinking of a solution to counter his skill this whole time.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm could come and go freely in the space. Even if he could trap him in the Equinox Flower, it could not imprison him permanently. It was almost impossible to seize him and attack.
<br><br>
In the end, he was left with no choice but to try to make some headway in this fight through the sacrifice of Rigoberto, Atticus and the other four.
<br><br>
Chapter 3680 Siege Pearce wasn't familiar with the exact abilities of every powerful warrior from other six mountains.
<br><br>
After all, some warriors chose to hide their Other Shore Tokens after they obtained them, so they could use them to take their opponents by surprise.
<br><br>
Having asked everyone about it through life vitality, he ended up turning to Master Hai.
<br><br>
Ever since Master Hai had fled to the Oneness Sky Palace and had been stationed in the Dragon City, he hadn't been in a single fight.
<br><br>
However, Master Hai had once fused with an Other Shore Token of Stage Thirty-two -- a thumb sized worm, which was known as the Corpse Weaver.
<br><br>
This tiny worm's ability was to creep into the body of a person who had just died, triggering a very unique effect: the corpse would come to life, in another form, and could attack the person who had just killed them.
<br><br>
Corpse Weavers were suitable for creating Latent Theurgies. However, Master Hai hadn't used this Other Shore Token ever since he fled to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, given the current circumstances, Pearce decided Master Hai needed to take action.
<br><br>
The ability of the Corpse Weaver could only be activated after someone died, which meant that someone among the warriors at present must be killed for them to catch Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
As all those warriors were afraid of death, they could only hope that Emperor Charm would break through the last layer of the Equinox Flower in the way they had anticipated.
<br><br>
However, Emperor Charm still ended up using the Starlight Tracking Spear to break out of the Equinox Flower, and at the time he was out, the six rays of Starlight Witness had already hung above the heads of six warriors.
<br><br>
Their initial plan was then rendered useless and the Corpse Weaver was activated.
<br><br>
Looking sadly at the six corpses before him, Master Hai shook his head slightly.
<br><br>
In such a short period of time, dozens of warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace had been killed. Even the leaders of the four mountains had been killed by Emperor Charm. It was indeed heartbreaking.
<br><br>
Although the six corpses moved a bit stiffly, they were incredibly fast.
<br><br>
The second they came to life, they pounced on Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm glanced at them indifferently. As the corpses approached him, he abruptly twisted his body, his vast white wings as sharp as two blades.
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack! The power of the wings was as great as tens of thousands of divine megatons -- but these corpses' bodies were as hard as gold and iron. They emerged from the attack unscathed.
<br><br>
However, the impact of the blow was enough to send them flying backward.
<br><br>
To Emperor Charm's annoyance, there was some sort of thread woven around him that linked him to the chests of the corpses. Just as he had sent them flying for about a few hundred feet, the threads suddenly grew taut and pulled them back.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's expression turned grim as he looked at the six corpses.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Reaching out his hand, a small square appeared on Emperor Charm's fingertip. With a flick of his finger, the square glowed a bright blue, enveloping one of the threads. When the square disappeared, the thread was still there, unharmed.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm frowned. He actually couldn't cut the thread off! While he wasn't afraid of these corpses, he didn't understand how the Corpse Weaver worked. He still needed to face the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace. Dragging these corpses around while fighting would be such a nuisance.
<br><br>
"Master Hai's method worked! The corpses have trapped him!" Pearce's eyes flashed. He felt a flicker of hope. "Everyone, go!"
<br><br>
Everyone had been waiting anxiously by the Equinox Flower. When he had broken through using the spear, their plan was disrupted. But now, Pearce was telling them to follow through. Without hesitating, everyone charged towards Emperor Charm, shouting at the top of their lungs.
<br><br>
Carrying the bone stick, the middle-aged man moved nimbly, appearing right behind Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Just then, another figure appeared. It looked exactly like him. He had made a duplicate using the mirror! The two figures raised their bone sticks above their heads, poised to strike.
<br><br>
The bone sticks flashed, and a powerful force surged out like a tidal wave.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Seeing two bone sticks coming at him one after another, Emperor Charm frowned slightly. In the blink of an eye, his whole body disintegrated into countless tiny squares.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's Grand Teleportation was special. He didn't teleport through the space channel, so the others could not block him by entering the space channel.
<br><br>
Normally, Emperor Charm could've appeared in another place, even in a place tens of thousands of miles away.
<br><br>
But this time, he was dragging six corpses. The situation was different now and the six corpses had not been teleported away.
<br><br>
What everyone could see was that the threads connected to the six corpses suddenly grew taut, and the corpses were yanked into the air.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! As the six threads intertwined with the space, it was as if they had been pulled into a gear, making constant cracking sounds. Along the way, various cracks appeared in the space, as if someone had cut the sky with an irregular saber.
<br><br>
Even though Emperor Charm was proficient in space theurgy, it was still impossible for him to teleport with the six corpses in tow.
<br><br>
After a few moments, his body appeared once more, not very far away.
<br><br>
How could the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace let go of this opportunity? At the moment when Emperor Charm appeared again, the two middle-aged men who had attacked just now vanished in a flash, then appeared next to him once more. The two bone sticks whistled in the air as they were swiftly swung towards Emperor Charm's head.
<br><br>
This time around, Emperor Charm didn't have the time to dodge. He tried to shield himself by wrapping his pair of white wings around his body.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Thunderous noises echoed through the air as the two huge bone sticks hit Emperor Charm's body, releasing an incredible amount of power.
<br><br>
Although Emperor Charm was able to protect himself with his wings, the force was enough to send him flying. His entire body fell down like a meteorite.
<br><br>
"Let me finish him!"
<br><br>
The voice came from a young man in black from the Bright Mountain. As he spoke, a black cross appeared above his head. Brandishing two swords, he launched himself towards Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! The two rays of sword radiance crisscrossed, aiming Emperor Charm at its center.
<br><br>
"Puff! Puff!"
<br><br>
When the two rays of sword radiance hit Emperor Charm, thin lines appeared on his pure, white wings. Then, blood seeped out from the lines.
<br><br>
"He's injured!" the young man in black cried out excitedly.
<br><br>
Usually, it wasn't a big deal for the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace or Emperor Charm to be slightly injured.
<br><br>
However, if a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm was injured, it usually meant that the Chaotic Source Spirits inside them were fatigued. And once the Chaotic Source Spirits did not work, the defensive power of Emperor Charm would greatly decrease! Just as the young man in black finished his attack, a golden arrow shot out from behind him, whizzing straight towards Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Boom! The arrow exploded, and rays of golden light shot out in all directions, piercing through Emperor Charm's dazzling wings. The archer, a strong warrior from the Bright Mountain, smiled in satisfaction when he saw his attack had also injured Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"And me!"
<br><br>
Another series of sword radiance slashed at him with a whistling sound.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm had killed the leaders of the four mountains. The strong warriors of these mountains hated him to the core. Everyone wanted a chance to strike him, to avenge the fallen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3681 Borrowing The warriors from the four mountains weren't the only ones eager to strike Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Even Auden and the others launched their attacks simultaneously.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! The attacks kept coming nonstop. As powerful as he was, Emperor Charm couldn't take these attacks head on.
<br><br>
His body flashed as small squares appeared on its surface. He tried to teleport once more, dragging the six corpses along.
<br><br>
However, he could never get far; the corpses were truly weighing him down. No matter where he tried to flee, the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace found him and attacked.
<br><br>
After circling the sky a few more times, Emperor Charm finally realized it'd be impossible for him to evade all these attacks, not with the six corpses he was dragging. His patience running thin, he suddenly roared furiously.
<br><br>
Then, a crack appeared between his eyebrows.
<br><br>
A blue eyeball peeked from beneath the crack. Obviously, this eyeball was some kind of Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
For warriors at Emperor Charm's level, they would only merge with the rarest and most precious Other Shore Tokens. The warriors who had been attacking him so fiercely just now hesitated slightly, not knowing what this Other Shore Token could do.
<br><br>
Swish! The blue eyeball emerged from the crack and floated in front of Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"Lend me your Other Shore Token," said Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
From millions of miles away, identical blue eyeballs appeared on the foreheads of the Divine Farmer, the Yellow Thearch, and Mahoney, the leader of the New Moon race.
<br><br>
"I thought you said this'd be a piece of cake. Did I overestimate you?"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch teased.
<br><br>
"Cut the crap," Emperor Charm snapped coldly.
<br><br>
Indeed, he had thought that, with the help of the Starlight Tracking Spear, killing these people should've been easy. He never expected he'd fall into such an embarrassing situation.
<br><br>
He had been so pushed into a corner that he was forced to use the Duplicating Gemstone, which could only be used once. To make things even worse, he had to ask for help from these fellows! "Whose Other Shore Token do you want? Divine Farmer's or mine?"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch asked.
<br><br>
"I want Mahoney's!" Emperor Charm exclaimed impatiently.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch raised a brow in astonishment. "What on earth are you up against?"
<br><br>
On the other hand, Mahoney responded calmly. Summoning her Other Shore Token, Mahoney reached out her hand and gently pressed her forehead.
<br><br>
Both the eyeball on her forehead and the one in front of Emperor Charm flashed blue simultaneously.
<br><br>
In an instant, Mahoney's Other Shore Token traveled through space and appeared above Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Apparently, the blue eyeball allowed them to borrow each other's Other Shore Tokens, no matter how far away they were from each other! The Other Shore Token that Mahoney lent Emperor Charm was called the Spearhead Armor of Destruction. It was an Other Shore Token of the descending type that could greatly enhance one's body and strength. In Emperor Charm's eyes, it was the most suitable one for this situation.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token floating above Emperor Charm melted like mercury and flowed around him, til it enveloped him completely, including his wings.
<br><br>
After fusing with the Other Shore Token, Emperor Charm emerged in front of the crowd. His eyes flashed with killing intent.
<br><br>
The middle-aged man who wielded the bone stick had been following him closely.
<br><br>
Buzz! The middle-aged man raised the bone stick in his hand the second he saw Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
To his surprise, Emperor Charm charged directly at him, instead of escaping. In a flash, Emperor Charm had stretched out his wings and smacked the middle-aged man with incredible force.
<br><br>
The middle-aged man was taken aback by this sudden attack. Without much time to react, he used the bone stick to try to block the blow.
<br><br>
Although the bone stick was sturdy, after fusing with a new Other Shore Token, Emperor Charm's strength increased greatly. Channeling the strength into his wings, the blow was strong enough to knock the bone stick out of the middle-aged man's hand.
<br><br>
Bang! Left defenseless, the middle-aged man was stunned. Emperor Charm took this opportunity to land a punch onto the middle-aged man's belly. The strength in that punch was enough to pierce his belly right through, destroying his inner world completely. The middle-aged man shrieked in pain as he fell down from the sky.
<br><br>
As the middle-aged man fell, two more warriors came at Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Raising their swords in the air, they shouted their battle cries. However, before they could even get close, a strong gust of wind blew them backwards.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm started to spin at an extremely high speed, wielding the six corpses strung to him as weapons! Since the corpses were indestructible, they became lethal missiles whizzing through the air.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! With two heavy thuds, the corpses managed to hit the two warriors, knocking them out of the sky as well.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Emperor Charm stopped trying to escape. Instead, he traveled through space and charged at the warriors head on.
<br><br>
The corpses that initially held him back were now some sort of weapon! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! He flung the six corpses around as he kept changing direction. Every time he emerged in the space, he would smash corpses towards the warriors in his way.
<br><br>
Bang! A warrior failed to dodge in time and fell from the sky after being hit by the corpses.
<br><br>
Another tried to use spatial transference to escape. However, before he could flee into the space crack, Emperor Charm clenched his fist, crushing the space channel into shreds.
<br><br>
The warrior stumbled out of the space channel, dazed and confused. Before he could react, a corpse smacked into him, knocking him out of the sky.
<br><br>
Although the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace didn't die after being hit by the corpses, their Chaotic Source Spirits were instantly exhausted, and could no longer sustain their bodies. Some were so gravely injured that they were forced to retreat.
<br><br>
Master Hai was dumbfounded as he watched this scene unfold before him.
<br><br>
He had never expected his Other Shore Token would be used against them.
<br><br>
After smacking warrior after warrior out of the sky, Emperor Charm managed to change the tide of the battle.
<br><br>
Just then, a burly man teleported to Emperor Charm's side, wielding a huge sword. With a roar, he swung the sword towards Emperor Charm's head.
<br><br>
The huge sword erupted eighty thousand divine megatons of force. When the sword radiance was produced, it was accompanied by a shrill scream.
<br><br>
The scream supposedly had the effect of disturbing one's mind.
<br><br>
However, Emperor Charm just sneered. Tilting his head slightly, a corpse was pulled backward. With a heavy crack, it smashed into the burly man's back. Staggering forward, the burly man was thrown off balance. Emperor Charm dodged the sword with ease, and turned to kick the burly man on the back.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! The man fell from the sky like a meteor and smashed into the Supreme Dragon Hall.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's kick had released tens of thousands of divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
The Supreme Dragon Hall collapsed with a loud bang at the impact.
<br><br>
In the center of the hall, Eastern Emperor Taiyi sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. He was still trapped on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Seeing that the Supreme Dragon Hall was destroyed, the expressions of the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace all fell.
<br><br>
"Go and protect Eastern Emperor Taiyi!"
<br><br>
"We can't let him approach the Supreme Dragon Hall anymore!"
<br><br>
"Stop him!"
<br><br>
Chaos erupted among the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace while Emperor Charm looked down at them from the sky.
<br><br>
He stared quietly at the figure of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Once upon a time, they were like blood brothers. However, in the end, they turned against each other and went along different paths.
<br><br>
And now, it was finally the time for him to end his life...
<br><br>
Originally, Emperor Charm planned to kill all the remaining warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace before facing Eastern Emperor Taiyi. However, at this moment, he suddenly felt that there was no need to go about it the hard way.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Taking a step forward, countless blue squares enveloped him, swallowing him into space.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Emperor Charm landed in front of the cross-legged figure.
<br><br>
Chapter 3682 A Giant Bird How could so many powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace let Emperor Charm approach Eastern Emperor Taiyi? The powerful warriors, who still had the strength to fight, instantly acted.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm was shuttling through the space, and they couldn't capture him, so they all shifted their target and immediately pounced on those corpses.
<br><br>
Pearce and Auden also joined them.
<br><br>
These powerful warriors grabbed the corpses and dragged them to the opposite direction. The Other Shore Power they emitted formed a joint force that couldn't be underestimated.
<br><br>
As a result, Emperor Charm's attacking momentum was forcefully stopped.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Emperor Charm showed up from the void and looked back at the people holding the corpses behind him. There was a glint of killing intent in his eyes. He turned back swiftly and crashed into the nearest person.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang, bang..."
<br><br>
Relying on Mahoney's Other Shore Token, Emperor Charm was practically able to go on the rampage in hand-to-hand combat. With his wild, violent fighting method, four people who were dragging a corpse were sent flying by his attack in an instant.
<br><br>
Without any pause, Emperor Charm went straight to another corpse Despite the fact that she was treating Elvinia on the ground below, Flamine's attention to the situation above never decreased. Seeing that Emperor Charm was gradually gaining the upper hand, she became more and more anxious.
<br><br>
She had exerted a lot of energy in this battle, so she was practically at the end of her tether now—she could do nothing to help.
<br><br>
In her anxiety, she looked around. When her sight fell on Zen, an idea suddenly popped out in her mind. She said, "Zen, go and carry Eastern Emperor Taiyi on your back. Let's escape together!"
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was the core essence of the Oneness Sky Palace. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi died, the Oneness Sky Palace would really be done for.
<br><br>
"Okay," Zen answered, nodding his head.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had told the members of the Sun Crow race to fight against Emperor Charm together. However, the Bearing race was watching the scene from the other side. When they saw that Emperor Charm gained the upper hand, they seemed to want to join the battle and help Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Zen sent some members of the Sun Crow race to stop Emperor Charm, while the rest was arranged by him to guard against the members of the Bearing race. At the very least, this arrangement should deter the Bearing race from acting rashly.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze fell on Lavender, Laquisha and Nelly.
<br><br>
The situation was critical now. Even though they met again, Zen didn't talk much with them. The three girls were quite considerate—they stayed in a corner quietly when they couldn't help.
<br><br>
"You can hide in my inner world first," said Zen.
<br><br>
Back then, he was willing to put them out of his inner world because the Oneness Sky Palace was very safe. But now that the Oneness Sky Palace was in turmoil, hiding in his inner world was the safest option for them.
<br><br>
None of them objected to Zen's suggestion. After all, they didn't have what it took to participate in a battle of this scale. If they stayed outside, they would only be a drag on Zen.
<br><br>
After taking the three girls into his inner world, Zen's figure zoomed away so fast that he looked like he suddenly disappeared from where he was.
<br><br>
Before long, he already appeared inside the hall.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked still calm. Since he was on the Other Shore, he didn't know what was happening here.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but let out a soft sigh when he saw Eastern Emperor Taiyi's serene expression.
<br><br>
It wasn't easy for the Oneness Sky Palace, which Eastern Emperor Taiyi personally ran, to develop to this level. In the blink of an eye, however, it was already on the verge of destruction. Zen couldn't help but sigh at this change.
<br><br>
He stretched out his hand, took Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and carried him on his back. With one light leap, he already appeared by Flamine's side again.
<br><br>
After dealing with Elvinia's injuries, Flamine also carried her on her back.
<br><br>
In fact, it was impossible for Elvinia to withstand that blow with her own strength. A force worth fifteen thousand divine megatons was enough to tear her apart. However, when her Chaotic Source Spirits were exhausted, a Latent Theurgy that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had personally planted in her quietly became active. This protective Latent Theurgy had saved her life at such a critical moment.
<br><br>
Seeing that Zen was going to carry Eastern Emperor Taiyi away, the powerful warriors of the Bearing race, who had been watching from afar, finally became agitated and started to make their moves. They couldn't just let such a good opportunity slip away.
<br><br>
Some members of the Sun Crow race noticed the uproar among the Bearing race. Vigilant expressions appeared on their faces. After all, Zen had ordered them to block these people.
<br><br>
"Guys, this is a good opportunity to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi. You guys work together and hold these birds back!" Hancock suddenly suggested.
<br><br>
The other members of the Bearing race also knew that they couldn't delay any longer. They had to take advantage of the current opportunity, so they took out the Other Shore Tokens they had and rushed towards the members of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
While the powerful warriors of the two races were engaged in a fierce battle, Hancock squinted, took a step back, and directly used the Grand Teleportation. Along with a spatial fluctuation, he appeared next to Flamine and Zen.
<br><br>
"Run!"
<br><br>
Hancock's sudden appearance made Flamine's expression change in an instant. As the divine flame of the Sun Crow race showed up in her hand, Flamine stretched her hand towards Hancock's head in her attempt to buy some time for Zen to escape.
<br><br>
Zen didn't want to stay any longer and hurried into the space channel.
<br><br>
Flamine's strength had been weakened greatly in the battle, and her speed was also much slower than before.
<br><br>
Seeing that Flamine stretched out her hand towards him, Hancock immediately moved and dodged Flamine easily. He bypassed her, stretched out his hand towards Zen's back, grabbed the shoulder of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and pulled him violently.
<br><br>
Zen had already stepped into the space channel when he felt the weight of the burden on his back disappearing. He looked back, only to find that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been pulled away by Hancock and that he had stepped into the space channel alone.
<br><br>
When Hancock captured Eastern Emperor Taiyi, a wild and arrogant smile bloomed on his face. In a flash, a scarlet dagger appeared in his other hand, and he swung it towards the top of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's head.
<br><br>
"Ding!"
<br><br>
In any case, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had stronger Chaotic Source Spirits than ordinary people.
<br><br>
Hancock's scarlet dagger carried a force of tens of thousands of divine megatons. But despite the crisp sound, Eastern Emperor Taiyi wasn't damaged.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the endurance of Chaotic Source Spirits was still limited. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi was stabbed repeatedly, his Chaotic Source Spirits would be exhausted sooner or later. It was just a matter of time.
<br><br>
"No!"
<br><br>
Flamine's face turned deathly pale. With Elvinia on her back, she pounced over and tried to headbutt Hancock.
<br><br>
Hancock didn't take her seriously. He casually kicked her away and stabbed the scarlet dagger towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi for the second time.
<br><br>
"Ding!"
<br><br>
A crisp sound once again rang. Eastern Emperor Taiyi's Chaotic Source Spirits withstood this attack again.
<br><br>
"As expected of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, you've managed to withstand my strikes twice only with the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Now, let me see if you can withstand my third strike!"
<br><br>
As he spoke, Hancock raised his scarlet dagger again.
<br><br>
At this moment, the weak Elvinia opened her eyes.
<br><br>
Just now, Flamine had spent quite a while in treating Elvinia's injuries so that her Soul of Light was gradually stabilized.
<br><br>
The moment Elvinia opened her eyes, she saw Hancock holding a dagger and trying to stab Eastern Emperor Taiyi with it. Despite her being still a little dazed, an unknown power burst inside her, and she directly pounced on Hancock.
<br><br>
When Hancock saw Elvinia rushed to him, his eyes glinted. Without thinking too much, he raised his dagger and swung it towards Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
The dagger pierced into Elvinia's neck. Blood spurted from her fair neck, and her head drooped to the side "Elvinia!"
<br><br>
Flamine let out a shrill scream.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen also appeared from the space channel. When he saw this scene, fury blazed in his eyes.
<br><br>
However, Hancock nonchalantly threw Elvinia to the side. He raised his scarlet dagger, intending to stab Eastern Emperor Taiyi again.
<br><br>
But right at this moment, the shadow of a giant bird suddenly appeared above Elvinia's head.
<br><br>
Along with the appearance of the shadow, a loud chirp that drew everyone's attention echoed around.
<br><br>
Chapter 3683 Kill With Poison When Zen saw the huge shadow of the bird, he was stunned for a brief moment, but then a look of ecstasy soon appeared on his face.
<br><br>
"The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow!"
<br><br>
It was the highest level treasure of the Star Falcon race. Zen clearly remembered giving this Other Shore Token to Elvinia before.
<br><br>
Flamine continued to grieve as she sat on the ground. A puzzled look was visible on her face as she witnessed the sudden appearance of the huge bird.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Hancock also looked surprised. 'Where did it come from? Am I the one who attracted it?' he thought.
<br><br>
They knew that it wasn't just any ordinary sparrow. Its aura was extremely strong, which definitely meant that it wasn't an ordinary Other Shore creature.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Before Hancock could react, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow already flew towards him and tried to peck his head.
<br><br>
The sparrow flew back and forth and attacked without ceasing.
<br><br>
In its first few attacks, Hancock was easily protected by the Chaotic Source Spirits. However, with the sparrow's last peck, the Chaotic Source Spirits were finally exhausted. The sparrow's long beak was able to break through and inflict a deep gash on his chest, which eventually bled profusely.
<br><br>
The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was such a savage creature that it treated Hancock like an earthworm. It was pretty determined to strike him until he became its meal.
<br><br>
However, Hancock was a pretty strong warrior who had reached Stage Thirty-two. There was no way that he would just stand by and become the sparrow's snack.
<br><br>
After he came to his senses, his face was quickly filled with anger as he readied for a counterattack. When he drew close enough, he used his bloodred dagger to slash the neck of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow.
<br><br>
Shing! Shing! Shing! Though his dagger was very sharp, the defenses of the huge sparrow were not to be underestimated. Ultimately, the dagger only left a few scratches on the sparrow's body.
<br><br>
"What the hell? Why can't I kill it?" Hancock was so annoyed that the sparrow was giving him a hard time.
<br><br>
He then changed his approach and attacked it with his fist.
<br><br>
Crash! The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was knocked back by the impact of Hancock's massive punch.
<br><br>
The sparrow was a sixth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Fourteen, but it didn't contain an endless amount of power like the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
As the top treasure of the Star Falcon race, it could easily deal with ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warriors. Unfortunately, its prowess would fall short in the face of an elite warrior like Hancock.
<br><br>
After the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow directly took Hancock's fist, it became more agitated. It suddenly flapped its wings so hard and aggressively flew towards him, intending to swallow him whole.
<br><br>
Hancock was able to dodge the attack and countered it by letting out a few heavy punches. Once again, the huge sparrow was forced to fly back.
<br><br>
Flamine's face grew paler by the moment. She didn't dare to look at her daughter's face.
<br><br>
She was frustrated with the fact that the sparrow appeared after her daughter was already dead. If it was trying to protect her, it should have done sooner.
<br><br>
While thinking about this, Flamine wasn't able to hold back her tears and began to sob.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the movements of the giant sparrow, and a plan started brewing in his head.
<br><br>
The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow could bring Elvinia back to life.
<br><br>
There weren't many Other Shore Tokens that possessed such incredible abilities.
<br><br>
But in order to do that, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow had to kill the person who had killed Elvinia.
<br><br>
The only problem was that the sparrow alone wouldn't be able to bring down Hancock. In fact, it was already being beaten slowly.
<br><br>
Upon hearing the sobbing voice of Flamine, Zen spoke in a soft voice, "Lady Flamine, take good care of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. It's not yet too late. We can still bring Elvinia back."
<br><br>
Flamine was so surprised when she heard Zen's words. She would not abandon any shred of hope if there was a chance that they could bring her daughter back to life.
<br><br>
Immediately, Zen dropped to the ground on all fours. Then, the structure of his body began to change.
<br><br>
Sclerites stood up all over his body except the ones on his head. In just a matter of seconds, Zen's appearance didn't look human any more.
<br><br>
As the sclerites continued to roll up, a tail formed and appeared behind him.
<br><br>
Flamine was stunned. She began to have doubts if Zen was actually a human. 'Was he just disguising himself this whole time? Did the Oneness Sky Palace know about this?' Zen didn't care about Flamine's thoughts at the moment. He needed to do what he could to save Elvinia. After activating the blood of the Chaos Ancient God, he crawled on the ground like a beast, and focused his eyes on Hancock.
<br><br>
The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was somewhat similar to the Corpse Weaver of Master Hai. Both of them were used to avenge the dead, but the Corpse Weaver was definitely more powerful as the corpses couldn't be killed at all. Even a powerful warrior like Emperor Charm wouldn't be able to destroy them.
<br><br>
In terms of endurance, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was also inferior.
<br><br>
After being bombarded by Hancock's attacks for quite a few times, it showed a trace of fatigue, and its power also decreased.
<br><br>
"I'll smash you to pieces, you damned bird!"
<br><br>
Crash! Crash! Crash! Hancock's fists were soon stained by the blood of the sparrow.
<br><br>
The weakened sparrow wasn't able to dodge most of his attacks, so it started retreating.
<br><br>
It lost its earlier aggressiveness and became the one who was on the defensive.
<br><br>
Not long after, many cracks appeared on the surface of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow. This was a sign that it was about to collapse.
<br><br>
Hancock was about to deliver his final blow. He put his hands together and an ominous red light began to shine brightly.
<br><br>
"I'm going to finish you off! Go to hell!' Just when Hancock was about to attack, Zen pushed his hands and feet so hard to the ground. Using them as a spring, he bounced off the ground and appeared beside Hancock in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
If Hancock was an ordinary warrior, he wouldn't have enough time to react and dodge Zen's sudden attack.
<br><br>
However, Hancock's strength was even comparable to that of Athemar and Goran. He reacted so quickly and even managed to maneuver for a counterattack.
<br><br>
"Are you kidding? You think you could pull off a sneak attack on me? I don't think so!"
<br><br>
The moment Hancock felt the space fluctuation near him, he retracted back and tried to punch Zen's chest as hard as he could.
<br><br>
Zen was also able to react quickly. He withdrew his hands to cover his chest with his arms.
<br><br>
Boom! He took a direct hit from Hancock and was sent flying backward.
<br><br>
When the power of tens of thousands of divine megatons smashed into his body, Zen felt his blood surge up that he almost suffocated.
<br><br>
However, as he flew backward, a smile appeared at the corners of his lips.
<br><br>
Noticing the weird smile on Zen's face, Hancock couldn't help but wonder inwardly, 'Is this guy insane? How could he still smile when he is getting a beating? Even if he isn't killed by that strike, I'm sure that he will be at least half-dead.' However, there was one thing that Hancock didn't put into consideration.
<br><br>
He ignored the change in the structure of Zen's body.
<br><br>
When Zen executed his sneak attack earlier, he quickly placed his tail at Hancock's nape. Before he was blasted off by Hancock, Zen's tail managed to pierce through his nape.
<br><br>
Much earlier, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was able to exhaust all of Hancock's Chaotic Source Spirits due to its ceaseless attacks. Therefore, without the safeguarding of the spirits, Zen was able to penetrate the back of Hancock's neck.
<br><br>
It was too late when Hancock noticed what Zen did.
<br><br>
Immediately after, Hancock's body trembled and his vision became blurry.
<br><br>
He reached the back of his neck with his wobbly hand and felt a trace of a tiny bloodstain. He looked at Zen in disbelief as his body continued to lose balance.
<br><br>
"What poison did you—" Before he could finish his sentence, his body dropped to the ground with a flop.
<br><br>
The same moment that he fell, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow hurriedly swooped down and swallowed him whole. It spread its wings and flew towards Elvinia.
<br><br>
Chapter 3684 Possessing The Body The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow flew over and tried to catch Elvinia in its mouth.
<br><br>
The sight shocked Flamine but she chose to stand her ground and not do anything yet.
<br><br>
Zen's reminder echoed in her mind as she remembered the treasure held by the Star Falcon race of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
She was still a member of the Sun Crow race when she heard about the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow. She had only heard of it back then but now, it was right in front of her.
<br><br>
After it completely swallowed Elvinia, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow bent down low and crawled on the ground.
<br><br>
In just a few short moments, it let out a long, shrill cry as it beat its wings wildly and leaped.
<br><br>
A giant egg was left from where it once stood.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
There was a series of large cracks as the egg broke into pieces, revealing a very much alive Elvinia.
<br><br>
With her appearance came the sharp roar of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow.
<br><br>
"Pop!"
<br><br>
One of its eyes had exploded, partially blinding the creature.
<br><br>
From what Zen heard before, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow had the ability to save its master thrice. Each rescue would result in blinding one of its eyes.
<br><br>
At the sight of the scene, Elvinia immediately understood what just happened. She died and used up one of the chances of salvation from the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow.
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
Now blinded on one eye, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow circled the air once before rushing down towards Elvinia and returning to the inner world that carried it.
<br><br>
After Zen restored the sclerites in his body, he walked over towards Flamine who looked at him with a complicated expression.
<br><br>
Hancock's tolerance to poison was far beyond anyone's imagination, but he instantly died after being stabbed by Zen's 'tail'. Just what kind of horrifying poison did Zen carry? Flamine was about to ask when another violent fluctuation came from the sky.
<br><br>
"Boom..."
<br><br>
It was so loud, deafening even, and for a brief second, they thought the world had been shattered.
<br><br>
Auden's body came tumbling down from the sky and smashed onto the Oneness Mountain like a broken sandbag.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
The impact caused the entire Oneness Mountain to shake violently.
<br><br>
A crack appeared in the peak, running across the entire length of the mountain! The east side of the Oneness Mountain was relatively flat and faced the Dragon City, while the west side, wherein the Phoenix Palace was located, was a bit more concave.
<br><br>
It was on the steep area of the west side that the crack appeared.
<br><br>
It wasn't just Auden who fell, a few more people also began to smash down onto the mountain face.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm was no doubt furious with how violent and heavy his attacks were.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
"Boom..."
<br><br>
People like Auden who were stronger than the average warriors could still survive the impact, though with serious injuries.
<br><br>
The weaker ones were not so lucky. Before they even reached the mountain, their bodies had already turned into a disgusting mass of flesh and blood.
<br><br>
As bodies continued to rain down from the sky, the crack in the middle of the mountain continued to expand, furthering the chances of the entire Oneness Mountain being cut in half! "We'd better get out of here as soon as possible!" Flamine told them. Pearce and the others had taken the risk in order to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi, while the members of the Bearing race were blocked by the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
This was their only chance to escape along with Eastern Emperor Taiyi! However, Zen didn't have the same thought process. As he looked at the mountain on the verge of collapse, he suddenly thought of Letitia and Margaret! It wasn't that big of a problem since everyone in the Flow Sword Sect could fly but it could not be denied that the Bloom Divine Province had become a dangerous place to be in. Zen knew he would have to bring them with him if they left.
<br><br>
Zen had planned for Elvinia to leave with Eastern Emperor Taiyi while he went to the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, before he could say anything, Emperor Charm suddenly appeared and swooped down over them.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token Mahoney lent him proved extremely effective in contending against dozens of enemies, to his advantage! "Run!" Flamine screamed.
<br><br>
With a wave of her hand, Zen, Elvinia, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were enveloped by a piece of space.
<br><br>
As a demon woman of the Divine Lair in the past, she was also quite proficient in space theurgy.
<br><br>
However, just as they were about to move, Emperor Charm was already at their heels.
<br><br>
He stretched out a finger and summoned a blue cube out of nowhere.
<br><br>
"Wow!"
<br><br>
This blue cube slammed down on Flamine, Zen, Elvinia, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, trapping them within.
<br><br>
There was no escape. The space around them was locked.
<br><br>
Flamine's expression darkened. She tried to create another space channel but the blue cube was unyielding.
<br><br>
There was no way they could get out of this one. The most proficient master when it came to space theurgy, aside from that Chaos Ancient God, was Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"Is it useless?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
His gaze hardened and he decided to throw a punch towards the cube.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Aside from a muffled sound, there was no sort of fluctuation in the entire space.
<br><br>
With them locked up, Emperor Charm became even more unbridled and direct.
<br><br>
He soared into the sky before diving back towards the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
As he descended, Emperor Charm's body dissolved into countless blue cubes that scattered all over the mountain. The strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, including Pearce, could only rely on their own physical bodies to collide with these cubes.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom..."
<br><br>
Numerous explosions erupted all over the mountain as Pearce and his companions collided against Emperor Charm's cubes.
<br><br>
Soon enough, Emperor Charm came out of the mountain and continued his assault, further widening the crack on the mountain face.
<br><br>
"I can't break Emperor Charm's space imprisonment!" Flamine exclaimed in panic.
<br><br>
She paced back and forth within the cube, her face marred with anxiety.
<br><br>
Elvinia couldn't help but feel restless upon seeing her mother so disturbed.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen was lost in thought as he stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
A strategy was currently being formulated in his mind. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi is on the Other Shore. If we control his physical body, then his strength could be used, right?" he asked.
<br><br>
Both Houyi and the real Emperor Charm remained beside him and hadn't yet returned to the Civilization Artifact. There was no way they were going to miss what was happening outside.
<br><br>
Houyi was the first one to speak. "You want our souls to possess his body?"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm shook his head. "As a supreme master, Eastern Emperor Taiyi surely has a powerful secret weapon to protect him. It won't be easy for us to control him with the energy soul."
<br><br>
Zen considered their inputs for a moment. "What about letting the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi try?" he asked.
<br><br>
In theory, the two Eastern Emperor Taiyis were the same person. This one in front of them was only a replica projected to this round of chaos.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's and Houyi's eyes flashed upon hearing Zen's suggestion.
<br><br>
Nobody in history had ever done such a thing, so naturally they needed to try it for themselves.
<br><br>
In no time at all, a third figure appeared above Zen's head, none other than Eastern Emperor Taiyi! Flamine's eyes widened upon the sight. This Eastern Emperor Taiyi felt so familiar yet also so strange to her.
<br><br>
Elvinia had seen this person in the Creation Myth Temple but was still stunned for a brief moment. Her heart thumped upon the realization of what Zen intended to do.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, do you mind letting us use Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body for the time being?" Zen asked. Flamine gaped at Zen.
<br><br>
She had no idea what the man intended to do.
<br><br>
However, since they were already in such a tight situation, anything was worth trying.
<br><br>
Chapter 3685 Eastern Emperor Taiyi's Energy Soul Flamine and Elvinia saw the energy soul of Eastern Emperor Taiyi as it went straight to his head.
<br><br>
"Eastern Emperor Taiyi owns a special soul pendant. This strand of soul..."
<br><br>
said Flamine, but she trailed off in hesitation.
<br><br>
With the protection of the soul pendant, no one could snatch Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell. The energy soul released by Zen would probably be instantly recognized by the soul pendant and then annihilated.
<br><br>
However, this energy soul was a strand of the soul of Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself, though it gave off a strange aura.
<br><br>
While Flamine was worried, the energy soul entered Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body without a hitch. Within a few seconds, his eyelids trembled and he opened his eyes.
<br><br>
His eyes shone brightly, as if stars were within them.
<br><br>
Flamine gave a hard look at Eastern Emperor Taiyi. She couldn't stop blinking in disbelief that he had woken up.
<br><br>
"Your Majesty..."
<br><br>
Flamine couldn't help but grab onto him, feeling him to make sure he was real and alive.
<br><br>
Embarrassed on behalf of Flamine, Elvinia pulled her back and said, "Mother, that is not my father."
<br><br>
From her experience on the Other Shore, she knew the truth.
<br><br>
However, she had no clue whether the man before them was the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi or not. After all, both the soul and the body belonged to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, though one was real and the other was a clone.
<br><br>
She couldn't help but still be puzzled.
<br><br>
"It's impossible," said Flamine, shaking her head.
<br><br>
If the body shell of Eastern Emperor Taiyi had really been snatched, his aura wouldn't be as familiar as it was right now. Because of this, she stuck to her judgment and decided that Zen probably woke up Eastern Emperor Taiyi by some means.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi took a look at Flamine and then turned towards Elvinia. He gave her a warm smile as he said, "We meet again. Is this your mother?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Elvinia replied with a nod. "She seems to have mistaken you for my father."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi nodded back and looked at Flamine. "I am indeed Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but not the one you knew. He was a seed I sowed in the chaos."
<br><br>
"A seed?" Flamine gasped, not knowing what was going on.
<br><br>
Seeing the confusion of her mother, Elvinia continued to explain, "The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi went to the Other Shore a long time ago. Mother, you must have heard of the human race on the Other Shore, right? My father was a clone created by the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi."
<br><br>
She made sure to keep it simple so that she didn't bombard Flamine with the news. Flamine nodded as she tried to absorb everything. She had heard of all kinds of legends about the human race on the Other Shore from her husband, but she had never seen them once in her life.
<br><br>
Zen, who observed from the side, gave a faint smile. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi, may I know how much strength you can display?"
<br><br>
He placed the energy soul of Eastern Emperor Taiyi into the body so that he had the power to go against Emperor Charm. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't exert all his strength, they might as well be doomed.
<br><br>
Just as Eastern Emperor Taiyi stood up, he reached out his arm and the Purple Rainbow Sword materialized. After he gave it a good look, his eyes looked up towards Zen. "What a good sword."
<br><br>
He couldn't help but be impressed. "The gap between souls can't be ignored," he continued, "but in other aspects, I may be able to display one hundred percent of the strength."
<br><br>
The strand of energy soul was too weak that Eastern Emperor Taiyi could not withstand the soul attacks. However, with the help of the soul pendant, he was not threatened by ordinary soul attacks. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that Emperor Charm would use the soul attack on him.
<br><br>
Just then, Eastern Emperor Taiyi began to read and analyze the Memory Flames of his clone. If it was a soul invasion, reading the Memory Flames would take a while and could even be rejected. This was because the Memory Flames did not belong to him.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not bothered with any of these problems. As if instantaneously, he was able to read and understand all the Memory Flames.
<br><br>
Boom! Right there and then, a loud boom echoed from the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
On the surface of the mountain, big holes and gashes appeared. Along with small blue squares, Emperor Charm flew high into the sky again.
<br><br>
As he dragged the corpses, they began to break even if they were woven by the Corpse Weaver. Apparently, even if they were determined to get revenge, they still had a limit.
<br><br>
As for the strong warriors like Pearce who hung onto the corpses, they were covered and smeared in dust and dirt.
<br><br>
At this point, Emperor Charm had thrown away many people, leaving only five people behind. Included among these people was Pearce.
<br><br>
"Since you seem so damn persistent, don't blame me for this," said Emperor Charm, looking back at Pearce with a smirk across his face.
<br><br>
As he spoke his last word, he opened his wings wide. A shadow of the sun appeared behind him, and the temperature of the atmosphere rose.
<br><br>
Because he'd already used the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy, he could not use it again. However, this was no problem to him, because he could still release the strongest divine flames of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! As his wings flapped and lifted him into the air, fire snakes grew out from the sun shadow behind him. These snakes stretched out their necks and spouted flames, all directed towards Pearce and the rest.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! As the flames rushed towards the group, they tried their best to dodge. If not, they would be burnt to ashes.
<br><br>
Clinging on to the mountain wall, Auden shouted, "Elder Pearce, please let go!"
<br><br>
It seemed that there was no point in trying to stop Emperor Charm, because he was determined to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
"No!"
<br><br>
Pearce used the back of his hand to wipe the mud off his face. He then summoned his Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Equinox Flowers began to sprout and bloom one after another around him and the others.
<br><br>
The Equinox Flowers were not as effective as the one that had trapped Emperor Charm before, but they were still capable of absorbing everything through the space theurgy. As the fire snakes spat out flames, the flowers absorbed them and they disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
"Haha..."
<br><br>
Seeing the helpless thing Pearce did, Emperor Charm couldn't help but let out a chuckle.
<br><br>
As more flames were thrown at the flowers, they rose into flames and the inner spaces were burned through and through.
<br><br>
Phew! Phew! All of a sudden, the blazing divine flames spread out and made their way towards one of the men, instantly burning him to ashes.
<br><br>
Though Pearce was not one to give up, he had to act smartly. He finally let go of the corpse, and the others followed suit. Pearce continued to move, but shook his head in disbelief. They had failed.
<br><br>
While the group retreated, the once indestructible corpses collapsed and were burnt to a crisp.
<br><br>
Just then, Pearce descended from the sky and landed on a huge stone, kneeling and facing down.
<br><br>
Crack! As soon as his kneel made contact with the stone, it disintegrated into powder.
<br><br>
In fact, the direction to which he knelt was the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
For countless years, he had been working for Eastern Emperor Taiyi with much loyalty and perseverance. He couldn't help but be consumed by disappointment due to the fact that he wasn't able to protect him.
<br><br>
After kowtowing, he continued to ascend back into the sky. At this point, all he could do was fight with his life.
<br><br>
Chapter 3686 The Fake Eastern Emperor Taiyi A gust of wind blew as Pearce jumped upwards. His hand shook violently, and the back of his palm up to his arm burst into cracks.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
Blood gushed from the cracks and spread out until it turned into a handful of blood mist.
<br><br>
He gently brushed the blood mist in his hand, and then a long sword condensed from the mist.
<br><br>
"God-detaining Sword!"
<br><br>
The moment he pulled out his sword, the area around him shook again, and another handful of blood mist bloomed. He stretched out his hand, and a second sword was condensed from the blood mist.
<br><br>
"Diabolic Sword!"
<br><br>
"Crane Sword!"
<br><br>
More blood mist spurted out from his arm and condensed another long sword. Afterwards, more than ten long swords floated beside him.
<br><br>
"Unite!"
<br><br>
As soon as Pearce uttered the word, all the swords piled up to form one sword and the aura of the sword became stronger.
<br><br>
"Demon-annihilating Hand!"
<br><br>
Just then, he brought out another Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
It was a black ghost hand with jagged skin and sharp nails.
<br><br>
The black ghost hand quickly replaced Pearce's original hand and fitted itself over his forearm like a glove.
<br><br>
Then, he grabbed the sword and disappeared in a flash.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
In the next second, he appeared behind Emperor Charm. He wasted no time and immediately swung his long sword, slashing towards Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
As a descending type of Other Shore Token, the ghost hand had also released many divine megatons of power.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the sword strike was especially forceful because Pearce forged his sword with the blood essence.
<br><br>
But as soon as the sword slashed down, the corners of Emperor Charm's mouth curved slightly. Suddenly, he grabbed one of the ghost hand's fingers, lifted it, and sent Pearce rolling in the air.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Pearce flew up high in the sky, and then landed on the ground not far away from Zen with a heavy thud.
<br><br>
He had consumed too much of his blood essence already. He almost collapsed after he fell, but there wasn't much blood that flowed from his wound. His face was even as white as a sheet.
<br><br>
'I... I've tried my best...' Suddenly, an idea flashed through his mind.
<br><br>
If there was still anything he could do to change the situation, that would be burning the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
However, burning the Other Shore Token was a taboo for many people in this world. Even if he didn't do so, he thought that Eastern Emperor Taiyi might not blame him.
<br><br>
Just as he lay on the ground waiting for Emperor Charm to kill him, his gaze turned to Zen.
<br><br>
His eyes narrowed into slits, and he quickly became shocked.
<br><br>
He saw Eastern Emperor Taiyi open his eyes and stand up...
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was awake? When he looked more closely at Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Emperor Charm who was in the sky looked down at the ground.
<br><br>
He was amazed and confused at the same time.
<br><br>
How did that happen? "Someone is possessing Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell..." he thought.
<br><br>
That was the first thought that came to his mind.
<br><br>
Since Eastern Emperor Taiyi was trapped on the Other Shore, it was impossible for him to return! After he came to a realization, his confusion and astonishment turned to anger.
<br><br>
He and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had a close relationship in the past. Even if he wanted to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he would not allow anyone to take Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell. Moreover, it was an act of humiliation to Eastern Emperor Taiyi! "Who the hell are you?" asked Emperor Charm in a cold voice.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked up at Emperor Charm in the sky, his face full of confidence. "I am Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the master of the Starry Sword Region!" he declared.
<br><br>
Once again, Emperor Charm was stunned.
<br><br>
Based on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's expression, he didn't look like he lied, but what did he mean by the master of the Starry Sword Region? Even Zen was a little shocked. It would be the best if he could frighten away Emperor Charm by taking advantage of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's own title.
<br><br>
Why did he say that he was the master of the Starry Sword Region, which confused everyone? Of course, Zen didn't know that Eastern Emperor Taiyi was trembling with excitement after he had obtained the physical body.
<br><br>
He had never seen the chaos for many years...
<br><br>
He had been there over a thousand chaotic eras ago...
<br><br>
And today, he got the same chance again. He wasn't afraid of fighting at all.
<br><br>
In fact, he wanted to battle.
<br><br>
If Emperor Charm really ran away, he would be very upset.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Emperor Charm's face darkened. He was already sure that someone had taken Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell. Anyway, he wouldn't even have a meaningless argument with Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
With a pinch of his hand, the blue cube began to shrink.
<br><br>
As the blue cube shrank, it was enough to crush the people inside into meat paste.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes narrowed into slits as he looked at the shrinking space with a smile.
<br><br>
He stretched out two fingers and gently scratched the space.
<br><br>
"Swish..."
<br><br>
When the two scratch marks appeared on the space, the space exploded.
<br><br>
"It is the perfect space construction method. However, such a small trick cannot be used to trap me. Ha-ha!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi said as he kicked the ground lightly and flew up.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Emperor Charm became even more confused.
<br><br>
It seemed that Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew his space theurgy very well.
<br><br>
In the air, Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked around. The current world was completely different from the 77th chaos. The 77th chaos was filled with the starry regions of various sizes, but this space right now was a vast and boundless land! He tore his gaze off his surroundings and held the Purple Rainbow Sword in his hand.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The Purple Rainbow Sword shook slightly, and a melodious sound filled the air. It turned out that Eastern Emperor Taiyi made a series of strange sounds with the sword.
<br><br>
The sound was melodious and pleasant at first, but as it became louder and louder, it suddenly made people feel irritable.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi. He wanted to see what the fake Eastern Emperor Taiyi was up to, so he listened carefully.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, Eastern Emperor Taiyi suddenly stretched out his finger and flicked the Purple Rainbow Sword.
<br><br>
"Ding!"
<br><br>
When the sound turned harsh, Emperor Charm felt as if his heart exploded.
<br><br>
Then, he was in a trance.
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi swiftly took advantage of this opportunity. He raised his sword and stabbed Emperor Charm! By the time Emperor Charm had regained consciousness, the tip of the sword had almost reached his chest. However, his expression changed. He barely dodged the stab, turned into countless blue squares and quickly disappeared.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm appeared not far away and stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi with his cold eyes. "Where did you learn the small trick?" he asked.
<br><br>
In turn, Eastern Emperor Taiyi held the Purple Rainbow Sword and said with a faint smile, "Someone almost died due to such a small trick..."
<br><br>
Now, not only Emperor Charm but also Pearce who lay motionless on the ground, Auden, and the others, understood that this person was not the Eastern Emperor Taiyi they knew! After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi regarded himself as a decent swordsman after he had founded the Oneness Sky Palace. He was honest and upright in his ways. He would never cultivate such a skill.
<br><br>
As for how this person had easily possessed Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body shell, they couldn't understand either.
<br><br>
Still, Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't care about the others' stares at all.
<br><br>
It wasn't easy for him to attain his freedom. Besides, he just wanted to apply what he had deduced for so many years, especially because the Other Shore's environment was still very different from the chaos.
<br><br>
Chapter 3687 Golden Rune Swords Emperor Charm stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi, his dark eyes expressing a strong killing intent.
<br><br>
"Then I want to see what your little trick is capable of!"
<br><br>
Swoosh! Emperor Charm stretched out his right hand, and the Starlight Tracking Spear appeared. He pointed his left hand at Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and then a beam of starlight fell and floated above the latter's head.
<br><br>
"Eastern Emperor Taiyi!"
<br><br>
Pearce and the other powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace immediately panicked at the sight of the starlight.
<br><br>
They had witnessed how Emperor Charm had used the Starlight Tracking Spear to kill many powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace. Of course, they didn't want Eastern Emperor Taiyi to end up the same.
<br><br>
However, they didn't have time to warn him. The Starlight Tracking Spear had already marked him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Emperor Charm lifted his spear and disappeared.
<br><br>
At that moment, Eastern Emperor Taiyi seemed to be still looking at the starlight above his head and thinking of a solution.
<br><br>
As soon as Emperor Charm vanished, Eastern Emperor Taiyi rushed towards the front of the mountain wall with the Starlight Witness.
<br><br>
Buzz! Just then, Emperor Charm appeared again and stabbed forward with his spear.
<br><br>
With his strength, Eastern Emperor Taiyi would never be able to avoid an attack launched behind him. Moreover, this Eastern Emperor Taiyi was just a fake one.
<br><br>
Crack! 'Did I stab him?' Emperor Charm thought.
<br><br>
But he quickly felt that something was wrong. He didn't feel like he had stabbed Eastern Emperor Taiyi. He looked into the distance and was shocked at what he saw.
<br><br>
In front of him was a huge mountain wall, and his spear had bored a huge hole on its surface.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! There was already a crack on the Oneness Mountain that continuously expanded. Now that a spear had struck it again, the crack extended even more. There was a rumbling sound, which meant that the mountain could collapse.
<br><br>
"How did he dodge my attack?"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm pulled out the Starlight Tracking Spear and looked at Eastern Emperor Taiyi above in disbelief.
<br><br>
Even the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi couldn't avoid the attack of the Starlight Tracking Spear. How did this fake dodge it so quickly? "You..."
<br><br>
The moment Emperor Charm opened his mouth, Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his finger at him and said lightly, "The mark can be moved away.
<br><br>
Your starlight is just a mark!"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi with doubt. Suddenly, he raised the Starlight Tracking Spear and charged again.
<br><br>
Crack! A second strike hit the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
The third strike...
<br><br>
The fourth strike...
<br><br>
Emperor Charm had missed his target in five strikes in a row.
<br><br>
What made it even worse was that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had the chance to counter him while he attacked, but the former had no intention to do so.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't make a move.
<br><br>
In fact, he just let Emperor Charm stab into the mountain wall every time.
<br><br>
"Is the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi so powerful?" Zen asked as he stared at the sky.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! We have lived for over a thousand chaotic eras. We are much more experienced than the clones," Houyi said. "I guess my clone is going to be furious," said the shadow of Emperor Charm above Zen's head.
<br><br>
Although these clones had different experiences from their owners, their tempers and personalities were the same.
<br><br>
For example, Emperor Charm was a serious and stubborn man, and his clone in the Source World was the same.
<br><br>
Naturally, he couldn't stand someone tricking him in a battle.
<br><br>
At the same time, the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace looked up and watched Eastern Emperor Taiyi constantly flash and dodge. All of them looked quite excited.
<br><br>
After all, Emperor Charm had killed dozens of their peers. To say they hated him was an understatement.
<br><br>
After five failed attacks in a row, Emperor Charm finally calmed down.
<br><br>
Anger brewed in his dark eyes. He was on the verge of exploding with fury.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked at him calmly.
<br><br>
The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had a good relationship with the real Emperor Charm in both the 77th chaos and the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Thus, he knew that the Emperor Charm in front of him was already quite enraged.
<br><br>
Swoosh! After a moment of silence, Emperor Charm spread his wings and his body began to rapidly expand.
<br><br>
"It's the Wild God Body..."
<br><br>
Flamine said as her eyes narrowed into slits.
<br><br>
In fact, by the end of ancient times, the embryos of the various super forces in the Source World had already formed.
<br><br>
At that time, there existed the three magnates of the Ear Mouse race, the captain of the Black Ship, the Yellow Thearch, the Divine Farmer, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi...
<br><br>
Before the truth changed, these powerful warriors entered the Land of Bone Tribulation on the Other Shore with their Wild God Bodies. There, they obtained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies and subsequently improved their bodies.
<br><br>
However, the cultivation of the Wild Gods had been prohibited since the middle ages, so the later generations weren't able to catch up with them.
<br><br>
That was why even if there were many outstanding warriors born in the next generations, there was a natural defect in their physical bodies. The remedy to this defect was to absorb the Chaotic Source Spirits, but the Chaotic Source Spirits had their limits. Even if the younger warriors had reached the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, their abilities were still much far from those of the people like Emperor Charm and Fuxi.
<br><br>
More importantly, there were two conditions to enter Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
One was to enter the Soul City, and the other was to make it through the Land of Bone Tribulation. Therefore, no matter how hard the masters like Athemar, Goran, Winchell, and Elizabeth worked, they couldn't enter Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Of course, they couldn't become the most powerful masters like Emperor Charm and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Among the people of the Oneness Sky Palace, only Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been to Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Splash! Emperor Charm's body quickly expanded until he turned into a giant with wings and a height of one hundred thousand feet.
<br><br>
He flapped his huge wings, and a hurricane formed.
<br><br>
Stones, dust, and other debris flew and rolled around everywhere.
<br><br>
"Are you serious?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi said with a faint smile.
<br><br>
He also activated the Wild God Power and his body began to expand rapidly as well.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he also turned into a giant of one hundred thousand feet in size, standing not far away from Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
He stretched out his hand and grabbed in the air as he said, "Grow!"
<br><br>
In turn, the Purple Rainbow Sword grew bigger and bigger.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had forged the sword with a special material. It was originally six hundred and sixty thousand feet long, but after he forged it with a secret technique, he had shortened its length to six feet and six inches. Now, it had returned to its original size.
<br><br>
At that point, Emperor Charm had completely lost his patience. His wings shook, and a scorching sun appeared behind him as he flew towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi slowly took a step back. The space around him quietly fluctuated, and he moved to a higher height.
<br><br>
The war between the Wild Gods would easily hurt the innocent. He didn't want to involve Zen in the battle.
<br><br>
After Emperor Charm missed his target, numerous blue squares emerged from his huge body, and he began to chase Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Just as he caught up to his opponent, a huge golden sword shadow appeared in the sky.
<br><br>
The shadow was so big that it almost covered the dome above the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
Buzz! The shadow spun to the side and turned into dozens of golden swords.
<br><br>
Then, those swords blocked the sky above the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
The tens of millions of creatures in the Bloom Divine Province were bathed in the golden light.
<br><br>
As for Flamine, Elvinia, and the others in the Phoenix Palace, they all covered their mouths when they saw the scene.
<br><br>
It turned out that those were the Golden Rune Swords, which were activated by the bloodline power of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
In the past, when Eastern Emperor Taiyi had gone all out, he could only activate three Golden Rune Swords at most. Even then, such a move was still quite powerful, and the other powerful warriors in the Source World were very afraid of it.
<br><br>
But now, the number of Golden Rune Swords in the sky was more than ten times bigger! Chapter 3688 One Chance Pearce, Auden and the others were shocked. They didn't know what the truth was.
<br><br>
Slowly, a smile crept on their faces as they watched the golden sword radiance light up the sky.
<br><br>
"His Majesty has grown stronger on the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
"Has His Majesty obtained an Other Shore Token that can strengthen the power of his bloodline?"
<br><br>
"These are Golden Rune Swords... This hasn't been used in ages, yet it's still incredibly powerful. Unbelievable!"
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace was not a force made up of members from the same clan. Only those in the Phoenix Palace shared the same bloodline with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, which made his bloodline rare.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
A huge vortex surrounded the Golden Rune Swords, as though energy was constantly being drawn towards its center.
<br><br>
Zen watched the vortex as though in a trance. "Master Houyi, Emperor Charm," he suddenly said, "does that vortex connect somewhere outside the chaos?"
<br><br>
Previously, Houyi and Emperor Charm had said that the energy in the chaos actually didn't come from the chaos.
<br><br>
However, the energy that was released was usually too little for people to find out this fact.
<br><br>
In theory, if the energy was strong enough, a vortex would form, connecting to the outside of the chaos.
<br><br>
Yet here it was, in the flesh. The power of the Golden Rune Swords was extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
"Exactly!" Houyi answered excitedly.
<br><br>
"Master Houyi, can your Sun Shooting Bow destroy these Golden Rune Swords?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Well..."
<br><br>
Houyi hesitated. Just then, Emperor Charm smiled bitterly and answered for him. "Nonsense. He was just lucky enough in the past to have shot down my suns..."
<br><br>
"Oh, I didn't expect the vortex would be so different from those in the suns," Zen muttered.
<br><br>
"It's not like that," Emperor Charm said. "The energy has different types and comes from different sources. Thus, cutting off the different types of energy will require different methods."
<br><br>
"In other words, there are ways similar to the Sun Shooting Bow that could be used to suppress the energy?" Zen raised his brow.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm nodded. "Yes, among us, the one who has studied this the longest time is the Primeval Lord of Heaven. However, despite his wisdom and the countless years he has spent on the research in this field, he's got nothing conclusive."
<br><br>
"Exploring things outside the chaos from within the chaos is like trying to peep at a leopard using a pipe," Houyi said lazily. "It's guaranteed the results will be inaccurate."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was known for his intelligence. Even the human powerhouses admired him for it. Yet, even a man as intelligent as him couldn't figure out the rules outside the chaos.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Golden light pierced the air as the Golden Rune Swords shot towards the sky.
<br><br>
Once the swords connected with each other, a powerful aura surged forth and the bright golden light enveloped the world.
<br><br>
"This is the extreme intent of swordsmanship!"
<br><br>
"His Majesty has indeed made a breakthrough!"
<br><br>
"It's too powerful. Emperor Charm is definitely no match for him!"
<br><br>
Watching this beautiful scene unfold before them, the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace were so giddy with excitement.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the members of the Bearing race trembled in fear, their faces as pale as death.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm was their only hope.
<br><br>
If he didn't succeed, there was no way the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace would let them go so easily.
<br><br>
As if the warriors weren't troublesome enough, they also had to face the wrath of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
As the golden light flashed in the sky, suddenly, a huge red fireball appeared.
<br><br>
It was another sun! Emperor Charm sighed bitterly.
<br><br>
He had just used the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy, so it was impossible for him to use it anytime soon.
<br><br>
Never in his wildest dreams did he expect to face Eastern Emperor Taiyi, or that the fake who was controlling him would be so powerful.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm was confident he knew Eastern Emperor Taiyi better than anyone else.
<br><br>
Yet, he was perplexed. How could the power of these Golden Rune Swords grow so rapidly? The soul curling up inside Eastern Emperor Taiyi's mind must be some kind of monster.
<br><br>
Just as quickly as the new sun appeared, a strong sword radiance shot out towards it.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Emperor Charm was left with no choice but to use the Grand Teleportation technique. This time, the sword radiance pierced the sun, causing it to burst into flames that quickly sputtered out.
<br><br>
However, the Golden Rune Swords covered the sky above the Bloom Divine Province. No matter where Emperor Charm moved, a Golden Rune Sword would follow.
<br><br>
Under Eastern Emperor Taiyi's control, the Golden Rune Swords picked up speed with every second that passed—but Emperor Charm was also able to teleport just as quickly.
<br><br>
Buzz buzz buzz buzz...
<br><br>
Emperor Charm darted across the sky in a flash, disappearing into countless blue squares each time he teleported.
<br><br>
Above the Clear Lake, the blue squares started to materialize. However, before Emperor Charm could even emerge, a golden light shot down from the sky, straight towards the blue squares. Reacting in a flash, Emperor Charm disappeared once more.
<br><br>
Splash...
<br><br>
The golden sword radiance pierced the surface of the water, causing ripples as large as a tsunami to sweep across the land.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the big cities around the Clear Lake had powerful warriors.
<br><br>
Together, they all took action to prevent the tidal wave from destroying their cities.
<br><br>
These masters were not too worried about the damages they'd suffer from the tsunami. Rather, they anxiously looked to the sky as they watched streaks of golden light attack a blue figure.
<br><br>
As the aborigines of the Bloom Divine Province, they could easily tell that the one who was attacking was Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself. As for the blue figure, very few could tell who he was.
<br><br>
That didn't matter to them. What was most important was for Eastern Emperor Taiyi to win. At least, the Bloom Divine Province would ultimately be safe.
<br><br>
Buzz! When Emperor Charm teleported away from the Clear Lake, he appeared on a plain in the west. But before he could even catch his breath, a Golden Rune Sword slashed at him.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack The blade of the Golden Rune Sword slashed into the ground, and the earth erupted. In the blink of an eye, a canyon was created right next to Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Gritting his teeth angrily, Emperor Charm had no choice but to teleport again.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi controlled the Golden Rune Swords easily with his mind.
<br><br>
"If you were wise, you'd have escaped by now...
<br><br>
But I know you won't run away." Eastern Emperor Taiyi smiled wickedly.
<br><br>
"You might've dodged my sword with the help of Grand Teleportation many times, but it's only a matter of time before you tire yourself out."
<br><br>
As Eastern Emperor Taiyi spoke, countless small squares suddenly materialized behind him.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's eyes flashed with killing intent as he emerged, poised to land a sneak attack.
<br><br>
However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi just laughed.
<br><br>
A huge Golden Rune Sword dashed towards them from the sky, threatening to pierce straight through Emperor Charm's head.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's face fell. Flapping his wings desperately, he managed to narrowly dodge the golden light.
<br><br>
But at that moment, another Golden Rune Sword came straight at him from behind! In a flash, Emperor Charm twisted his body to dodge that golden light by a hair.
<br><br>
However, as soon as he recovered, another sword slashed towards him from the side.
<br><br>
His expression darkened. There was no way he'd be able to dodge in time.
<br><br>
He could only turn to protect his vital parts.
<br><br>
Puff! Grunting, Emperor Charm realized the Golden Rune Sword cut off one of his arms and half of his wing.
<br><br>
His arm was more than four hundred thousand feet long, and his wing was two million feet long. When they were cut off, they returned to their normal sizes and fell from the sky.
<br><br>
Blood spurted from his wounds, raining all over the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
Chapter 3689 Traitor Emperor Charm's body trembled as he stared at his wounds.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi still stood with his hands behind his back, an indescribable sadness washing over him.
<br><br>
He had read through all the memories of his clone after taking his body.
<br><br>
The two emperors had once been as close as brothers, but had turned against each other in the end. The thought of it made Eastern Emperor Taiyi sigh.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Blood dripped down from Emperor Charm's body. Nobody dodged it, but instead looked up at the movements above them.
<br><br>
"You are no match for me," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said calmly.
<br><br>
If he was up against the real Emperor Charm, he might not come out on top, but compared to his clone, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was much more capable in terms of control of the blood and combat.
<br><br>
The corners of Emperor Charm's eyes twitched. He raised his hand and a huge flame began to condense into a long spear.
<br><br>
He would not allow himself to fail, even if it cost him his life! But just as the enormous flame spear formed, a crack suddenly appeared between his eyebrows and an eyeball drilled through it.
<br><br>
"Come back. You really are no match for him," said Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
The eyeball allowed them to not only share the Other Shore Tokens, but to observe and convey information to each other as well.
<br><br>
When Emperor Charm and Eastern Emperor Taiyi fought, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer were watching.
<br><br>
"Not only are you no match for him, but even I would meet the same fate as you if I faced him," said Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
Their tones were rife with caution. It seemed they regarded Eastern Emperor Taiyi as quite a formidable foe.
<br><br>
"Why?" Emperor Charm was not convinced. "He is not the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Why is he so powerful?"
<br><br>
"He is indeed not the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but he might be another Eastern Emperor Taiyi," said Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
"Another Eastern Emperor Taiyi? What do you mean?" Emperor Charm asked as his heart sank.
<br><br>
"Zen was able to deactivate your Nine-Sun Destruction Theurgy because someone called Houyi gave him a bow. There is another me, another Divine Farmer, and another Emperor Charm in this world."
<br><br>
"What?" This news surprised Emperor Charm. "How could such people exist?" he asked.
<br><br>
Same as the people of the Pear Hill, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer had been searching for the human race on the Other Shore since their birth.
<br><br>
However, the clues left by the human race on the Other Shore were all recorded in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree which was in the hands of the Snake Goddess. For this reason, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer knew much less about the human race on the Other Shore than the Snake Goddess did.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race in the upper stages had seen everything that the Moon Fire Slaves had seen, so they knew Zen had entered the Creation Myth Temple and taken the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
As the second ruling civilization, the Element Spirit race naturally knew the movements of the human race on the Other Shore. To them, the so-called secrets were not secrets at all.
<br><br>
But they had never revealed any information to Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer. The reason was very simple. They supported Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer because they wished to fragment the human race. So how could they tell them the history of the human race on the Other Shore? Yellow Thearch had just been to the Other Shore. It was not until he asked about Zen's Sun Shooting Bow that the Element Spirit race told him the secrets they knew. Now that they had reached this point, the Element Spirit race had complete control of them, leaving them no right to turn back.
<br><br>
But the truth shocked him and he immediately confessed it to Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"So I'm just a clone?" Emperor Charm murmured.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi still looked at him calmly. After Emperor Charm had turned into a Wild God, his body had become colossal. Although he murmured low and soft, Eastern Emperor Taiyi heard him clearly. Since Emperor Charm now knew he was a clone, he might have known some of the truth.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm lowered his head and thought a while before dissipating the Wild God Power.
<br><br>
His gigantic body shrunk back to its normal size.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi stared at the small sized Emperor Charm and dissipated his Wild God Power as well.
<br><br>
"You are the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, right?" Emperor Charm asked, disheartened.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi nodded and said, "Yes."
<br><br>
Emperor Charm looked down at the Oneness Mountain and said, "I want to see my real self."
<br><br>
This sudden request surprised Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but he didn't hesitate and quickly replied, "Okay."
<br><br>
The two came back one after another.
<br><br>
The powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace had no idea what they were up to, but seeing Emperor Charm making his way back made them nervous.
<br><br>
Among the warriors, only a few could still fight. Libby was one of them. As Emperor Charm came back, they stepped forward and surrounded him in case he decided to attack suddenly.
<br><br>
"Zen, he wishes to see his real self," said Eastern Emperor Taiyi through his life vitality.
<br><br>
Zen was astonished. He hesitated a moment and the real Emperor Charm said in his mind, "Let me meet him. I can talk to him."
<br><br>
Zen nodded in approval. Eastern Emperor Taiyi stood beside him while Emperor Charm, who had lost an arm and a wing, stood opposite Zen.
<br><br>
Buzz! A faint light flashed and the shadow of the real Emperor Charm appeared above Zen's head.
<br><br>
After staring at his real self for a while, Emperor Charm finally brought himself to ask, "They say I'm your clone. Is it true?"
<br><br>
"It's true," replied the real Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"Why did you create me?" Emperor Charm asked.
<br><br>
"We want you to make the last attempt to complete the Finale Way," the real Emperor Charm said.
<br><br>
"Is that also why you created Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch?"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm asked.
<br><br>
"That's correct. In fact, we have sowed many seeds, but most of them haven't survived. You are one of the lucky few, so are Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer," the real Emperor Charm said with a smile. "I can ask their energy souls to show up."
<br><br>
"No need." Emperor Charm waved his hand and continued, "But why are we on different paths? Why don't we follow the same path as Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi?"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm felt wronged. Finding out he was a traitor hurt his heart and filled him with regret. But he had betrayed them unintentionally, so he blamed his real self for it.
<br><br>
The real Emperor Charm sighed and said, "It didn't all go according to plan.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race intervened, and we were trapped in Stage Thirtythree. We could do nothing to help. It was not until Zen opened the Creation Myth Temple and bore the Civilization Artifact that our energy souls were released."
<br><br>
"Oh, I see. I took the wrong path," Emperor Charm said, lowering his eyes.
<br><br>
"Then I can choose another path."
<br><br>
While Emperor Charm asked these questions in the presence of Zen, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer listened intently in another area of the Source World. When they heard Emperor Charm say that he would choose another path, their demeanor shifted drastically.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had told them the truth because they were sure they would not dare to betray them.
<br><br>
Betraying them now, at this critical moment, would lead to unimaginable consequences.
<br><br>
Chapter 3690 Explosion Zen, Flamine, and the others were stunned.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm was powerful and with this power came extreme determination and a strong will. Once he chose a path, he would doggedly stick to it even if he was wrong.
<br><br>
But just a few words from the real Emperor Charm pushed him to change his mind.
<br><br>
The real Emperor Charm was not surprised and remained calm as usual.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm and the real Emperor Charm had similar personalities. The real Emperor Charm knew that his duplicate couldn't accept deception and betrayal.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm's duplicate had once been the king of the Sun Crow race, and hadn't considered his behaviors as betrayal. But things changed after the duplicate had discovered his identity.
<br><br>
At the time, Emperor Charm's duplicate had argued with Eastern Emperor Taiyi's duplicate about which path they should choose. And now that he had finally proved his fault, he wasn't about to accept anything else.
<br><br>
"Of course, you can choose another path if you want," the real Emperor Charm said.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm nodded.
<br><br>
He was still interested in the bloodline power of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
He also wanted to know what the human race and the real Emperor Charm were like in the past.
<br><br>
But Emperor Charm had just nodded when the eyeball on his forehead suddenly flashed a triangular black light, and a strange cry rang out from it.
<br><br>
"What's the point if you're willing to do that? You should also ask if we are willing to let you do it!"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm looked worried at these words. "Who-who are you?" he stammered.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had given this eyeball to Emperor Charm. But for a long time, Emperor Charm had always used it to communicate with the Yellow Thearch, the Divine Farmer and Mahoney, or to borrow Other Shore Tokens from them. But this scream was from none of them! "Who am I? Ha-ha!" The voice laughed but did not answer.
<br><br>
"I know who you are."
<br><br>
A figure appeared above Zen's head once again. It was none other than the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
When Zen had asked the energy souls of Emperor Charm, Houyi, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi for help, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had begun to pay attention to the outside world.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had finally chosen to show up when the voice of the eyeball had sounded.
<br><br>
The triangular black light in the eyeball stared at the Primeval Lord of Heaven's energy soul and its laughter became even more arrogant. "Nice to meet you again. Tell me, do you want to stir up trouble just by relying on this strand of energy soul?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven stared calmly at the triangular black light in the eyeball and said, "I have obtained the opportunity."
<br><br>
"Really? In that case, why are you hiding in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore? You are inferior even to the Nihility race!" The triangular black light continued to taunt him.
<br><br>
Every race on the Other Shore that believed in the Finale Way were suppressed. They either disappeared from the Other Shore, or joined the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Even the human race, which had been extremely powerful for a period of time, had been trapped within Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Only the Nihility race was an exception.
<br><br>
The path of cultivation that this race had chosen was completely different from that of the Element Spirit race. But before the Element Spirit race could begin to suppress them, the Nihility race had successfully attracted many talents and powerful warriors from many large races.
<br><br>
It had grown to an extent that the Element Spirit race had found it really difficult to suppress it.
<br><br>
"Your plan is unfortunately a little too late," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile. "You don't have an advantage in the chaos."
<br><br>
"This advantage is nothing for our Element Spirit race!"
<br><br>
Perhaps the voice wanted to prove that it didn't care. The eyeball began to suddenly blink.
<br><br>
Buzz! The eyeball turned red, a terrifying energy brewing within it.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi stood beside them and noted Emperor Charm's every movement. He was afraid that Emperor Charm would kill people and cause trouble.
<br><br>
When the energy began to spread, he transported himself so he was standing before Zen in a flash.
<br><br>
In the meantime, Emperor Charm had also guessed that something was up.
<br><br>
He turned to look at his subordinates and then glanced at the real Emperor Charm, saying, "This man is the real Emperor Charm. I'm just a clone.
<br><br>
Perhaps this is why you betrayed me. I'm willing to believe it, but please follow and support him."
<br><br>
As he spoke, small blue squares appeared around his body, and he appeared in the sky.
<br><br>
"Flamine, please forgive me,"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm said, looking down at Flamine.
<br><br>
Flamine had Sun Crow race's bloodline flowing in her veins.
<br><br>
When she had married Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Emperor Charm had obviously agreed.
<br><br>
But Flamine had been the one to cause the conflict between the two races at the beginning and she was considered to be a traitor in the entire Divine Lair.
<br><br>
Bang! Before Emperor Charm could finish speaking, the red eyeball exploded.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm had soared into the sky because he didn't want to hurt Zen, Flamine, and the others.
<br><br>
But although the eyeball was strong, the shock wave did not cover a large area. The explosion only caused Emperor Charm's head and the upper part of his body to shatter into pieces, causing the lower part of his body to fall from the sky.
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm!"
<br><br>
The members of the Sun Crow race were heartbroken at this development.
<br><br>
Elizabeth flapped her wings and flew upwards, catching Emperor Charm's broken body in her arms.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race needed to listen to Emperor Charm in Zen's mind because of the bloodline worship, but their memories and emotions were still there. This kind of grief bubbled up from the depths of their hearts.
<br><br>
Flamine bit her lips, her face lined with sorrow.
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't share a good relationship with Emperor Charm. The Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race had turned into enemies even before she was born. She detested the winged demon women of the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
But her mood soured when she sensed Flamine's sadness.
<br><br>
It was truly pitiful for a leader of a super force to die in this way.
<br><br>
The moment Emperor Charm died, everyone's eyes fell back on Hancock and his companions.
<br><br>
Hancock and his companions had wanted to escape in the beginning. But after Emperor Charm had launched an attack on the Bloom Divine Province, they had become unwilling to leave.
<br><br>
When all the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace were killed, they would be able to search and snatch any treasures on the seven mountains. A super force had a very deep foundation and abundant resources after all.
<br><br>
It never occurred to them that Emperor Charm could be no match for Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
In this moment, they were thinking about whether Emperor Charm could run away along with them. With Emperor Charm's strength and his control of the space theurgy, it would be easy for him to do it.
<br><br>
But they hadn't expected Emperor Charm to suddenly stop fighting and start a chat with them.
<br><br>
Moments after, Emperor Charm even soared into the air and exploded.
<br><br>
Hancock and the others were stunned and at this point, found it impossible to escape.
<br><br>
The moment the eyeball on Emperor Charm's forehead exploded, a violent vibration was transmitted to the foreheads of the Yellow Thearch, the Divine Farmer, and Mahoney in a different place in the Source World.
<br><br>
They frantically tried to sense Emperor Charm's eyeball, but the other side had fallen into darkness.
<br><br>
Chapter 3691 The Minimum Spaces Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer and Mahoney looked at each other in silence.
<br><br>
They had expected the Element Spirit race to punish Emperor Charm, but they hadn't expected it to be done by such violent means.
<br><br>
He had only exhibited a smidgen of rebellion. He hadn't even rebelled yet, and still they killed him without hesitation.
<br><br>
They were a truly cruel race.
<br><br>
There was also an eyeball buried into each of their foreheads.
<br><br>
They had once thought that this Other Shore Token would bring endless possibilities. With more Other Shore Tokens, they would be able to enhance each other's strength far beyond what was previously possible.
<br><br>
But now, all it seemed to be was a fatal tool to be used against them.
<br><br>
How could such powerful masters as Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer allow someone else to have such control over their lives? Taking their lives at any moment? Even the superior Element Spirit race should not be allowed that power! As they stood silently, the eyeballs on their foreheads opened. A triangular black light appeared from the center of the eyeballs, and the voice could be heard again.
<br><br>
"Have you seen the fate Emperor Charm has met?" the triangular black light asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
"Do you have any feelings about this?" the triangular black light continued.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch's eyes grew stern as he said, "We have already chosen our own path, and we will not stray from it. Emperor Charm made his choice to rebel. We do not need such a foolish ally!"
<br><br>
The triangular black light trembled for a moment before saying, "That's right. Remember, this world will eventually prove that the path we have chosen is indeed the right one. The Purge Way is the only way to survive. I don't want to see this happen again. You have seen his ending!"
<br><br>
Once it had finished speaking, the triangular black light vanished immediately.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch, Mahoney and Divine Farmer all remained silent.
<br><br>
The strong warriors following behind them were silent as well.
<br><br>
Their leaders' lives were in someone else's hands. All it would take was an order to be given and they would be dead. This thought dragged their spirits down.
<br><br>
But the eyeballs remained rooted in their foreheads and so even a private conversation was out of the question.
<br><br>
After a short silence, Yellow Thearch turned to Fire Emissary, one of the Five-element Emissaries, and said, "Go ahead with your work."
<br><br>
Fire Emissary looked at Yellow Thearch worriedly but nodded nonetheless.
<br><br>
He stretched out his arm and made a lifting gesture in the air, and wisps of cyan flames rose from his hands.
<br><br>
"Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle..."
<br><br>
The flames rose up and were sucked into the space above, like vortexes swirling and converging into a single point.
<br><br>
The space of the chaos had the smallest unit. If a space was constantly divided, the smallest space would be formed. This method was exclusive to the Chaos Ancient God, Othniel.
<br><br>
Fire Emissary now began condensing all the flames into this Minimum Space.
<br><br>
An hour later, the flames in the Minimum Space had finally reached a critical state. No matter how hard Fire Emissary tried, he couldn't compress any more flames into it.
<br><br>
"It's done," Fire Emissary said to Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch nodded at the huge eye in the crack of the abyss, and the Minimum Space slowly rose up.
<br><br>
Above the pitch black abyss, there were over a hundred of such Minimum Spaces. They were incredibly small, so small that the tip of a hair could hold over a million of them.
<br><br>
However, the sheer number of flames in them made the Minimum Spaces very conspicuous, especially in the darkness where the cyan dots of light were like dazzling stars.
<br><br>
"Are the concentrated flames really that powerful?" Fire Emissary asked.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch smiled faintly and said, "You may have a try if you wish."
<br><br>
"Okay!"
<br><br>
Fire Emissary was already very curious and so jumped at this opportunity.
<br><br>
He stretched out his hand, picked a cyan light dot from the air and pinched it hard.
<br><br>
Splash! The Minimum Space exploded.
<br><br>
It had already been filled to the limit with flames. If it weren't for the Chaos Ancient God named Othniel who had controlled it personally, the Minimum Space would have collapsed.
<br><br>
Othniel could achieve a wonderful balance in this Minimum Space.
<br><br>
The moment it exploded, the cyan flames spread out and plummeted down from the sky.
<br><br>
When they reached the bottom of the abyss, they rose upwards once more.
<br><br>
The abyss was so big that it could accommodate a large province, and yet it was instantly enveloped by flames.
<br><br>
"That fire is incredibly fierce!" Fire Emissary exclaimed, staring at the flames above. "But I think there are too many flames in it."
<br><br>
"The entire space exploded with your flames. That space itself turned into a part of the flames," Yellow Thearch explained.
<br><br>
"Is that little space so powerful?" Fire Emissary asked, totally stunned.
<br><br>
"Yes, the mechanism is very complicated and difficult to explain. All you need to know is that all materials in the chaos are made up of countless Minimum Spaces. No matter how the chaos is destroyed or reborn, these Minimum Spaces have always been here. Ordinary people can't usually use these Minimum Spaces." Divine Farmer reached out his hand to touch the flames around him. "The power of the flames is not very strong, but they are destructive enough to kill all the creatures in a province."
<br><br>
Those flames had already filled the huge abyss. Such powerful flames wouldn't cause any harm to people like Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch, but if they were placed in a large province, the creatures there would suffer.
<br><br>
If a Minimum Space exploded, a large province, as well as tens of millions of creatures there, would be burnt to ashes.
<br><br>
"How many provinces should I burn to make the Source World react?" Fire Emissary asked, frowning intently as he appeared to try and work it out himself.
<br><br>
Human nature was complicated.
<br><br>
Fire Emissary was a ruthless figure in the Bearing race and countless people had died by his hands.
<br><br>
But even burning the provinces and killing all the creatures like this gave him a reason for pause.
<br><br>
"According to my calculations, we will have to burn down at least three hundred provinces," Divine Farmer replied flatly.
<br><br>
Everyone fell silent again on hearing this.
<br><br>
The fact that the Element Spirit race had killed Emperor Charm already aroused feelings of rebellion within them.
<br><br>
The previous plans seemed logical until they carried them out. Then they felt like stopping and wanted to give up.
<br><br>
"I'll go first!"
<br><br>
Mahoney said, taking the initiative while everyone else remained silent.
<br><br>
Among the several super forces, the New Moon race was the smallest. In the past, they were not qualified to be ranked as a super force. They developed to this point with the support of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
At this crucial moment, Mahoney felt obligated to do something.
<br><br>
After the cyan flames that spread throughout the abyss disappeared, she flew up and stored the Minimum Spaces in her space ring. She then moved out of the abyss and Fire Emissary continued to compress the flames into the Minimum Spaces.
<br><br>
The Vast Sea Province was on the other side of the abyss.
<br><br>
Chapter 3692 Fast Destruction Soon after, Mahoney arrived above the Vast Sea Province and released a Minimum Space from her space ring.
<br><br>
The Minimum Space was almost weightless and so small that to the eye and touch it was almost nothing. If an ordinary person were to touch it, it would pass straight through their bodies.
<br><br>
Because of this, it was only through her space theurgies that Mahoney could move these Minimum Spaces.
<br><br>
After she released one, it floated slowly in the air.
<br><br>
With a gentle breeze, the Minimum Space, which was a million times smaller than dust, spiraled in the air and floated downwards.
<br><br>
The sun shone in the Vast Sea Province, so it was definitely not as dark as the abyss.
<br><br>
With the sunlight beaming, even if the Minimum Space emitted light, it was nowhere near as dazzling as the star and would be a little more inconspicuous.
<br><br>
It continued floating down gently before making its way down to an island below.
<br><br>
The Vast Sea Province was almost completely covered in water, with only a few large islands present on the surface.
<br><br>
On the island below, there lived a small race called the Fox Fish race. Their race's power was ranked high in the Vast Sea Province. But even if they were ranked in the top ten in the Vast Sea Province, it was still a very small and insignificant race when compared to the super powers in the Source World.
<br><br>
Any master from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race would be capable of destroying such a puny race.
<br><br>
However, as the Vast Sea Province was relatively remote, and there was no unique production, it had always been peaceful.
<br><br>
Except for the two great races fighting underwater from time to time, peace was maintained. Such a harmonious state was rarely seen in the Source World.
<br><br>
"Look over there. What's that?"
<br><br>
a member of the Fox Fish race said as he had noticed the dot of light falling from the sky.
<br><br>
Many of the Fox Fish race then looked up curiously.
<br><br>
"Is there a star falling?"
<br><br>
"It's daytime..."
<br><br>
"Let's go and have a look!"
<br><br>
They had no idea of the impending doom and still chased after the dot of light.
<br><br>
One of them was faster than the rest.
<br><br>
He had reached the consummation of True God Realm. He constantly flashed his figure and got below the light first.
<br><br>
"What a small dot of light! But it's so bright that it can be seen dozens of miles away. What sort of treasure is this?" he exclaimed, reaching out to touch the light still gliding down.
<br><br>
The moment he came into contact with this Minimum Space, it penetrated right through his hand and fell to the ground, going further down deep into the earth below his feet.
<br><br>
"What the..."
<br><br>
He was a little confused. Was that light actually real? Naturally, there was no way for him to understand how small the Minimum Space was. Compared with the Minimum Space, his body was like a rough sieve through which the space could just pass straight.
<br><br>
As he pondered on the dot of light, he felt a heat rising from beneath his feet.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A cyan flame burst from the ground and soared into the sky.
<br><br>
The other members of the Fox Fish race standing in the distance saw the soaring column of fire and their faces filled with horror. They all turned to run the other way, spurred on by their absolute terror.
<br><br>
But the cyan flame was spreading too fast.
<br><br>
Before they could turn, the cyan fire column had caught up to them, engulfing their bodies instantly.
<br><br>
It was as Divine Farmer had said; the flame released from the Minimum Space was not very powerful and wouldn't cause any harm to the masters at the Chaotic Source Realm or warriors at the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
However, 99.9% of creatures in the Source World were unable to resist it.
<br><br>
As the cyan flames continued to spread rapidly, the members of the Fox Fish race screamed, roared, and cried with despair as most of them were burnt to ashes in seconds.
<br><br>
Everything, including the trees and buildings, was set on fire...
<br><br>
The Fox Fish at the consummation of True God Realm laid an enchanted barrier against the flames rising from below, but it could only hold off the fire for a few seconds.
<br><br>
He swiftly switched to trying to use the Grand Teleportation to avoid the cyan flames.
<br><br>
But just as he had teleported to a position he thought was safe, the flames had already spread and enveloped him once again.
<br><br>
He used the Grand Teleportation again, but was still caught by the fast spreading cyan flames...
<br><br>
When he finally reached the sea surface, he found that the cyan flames seemed to have covered the entire Vast Sea Province! Splash! He leaped into the sea.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before the sea water began to boil.
<br><br>
But compared to the burning of the flames, he considered the water 'cool'.
<br><br>
At the very least, he could endure the heat of the boiling much easier.
<br><br>
He soon found, however, that even the bottom of the sea was not safe...
<br><br>
The cyan flames had spread to fill the entire Vast Sea Province. Even the sea water began steaming intensely under the frenzied burning of the flames, and the sea level began falling at a visible rate.
<br><br>
The large races at the bottom of the sea then fell into panic as well.
<br><br>
They didn't know where the flames had come from, but at the rate the water steamed and evaporated, it wouldn't be long before the sea water completely disappeared, and their fate would be no different from that of the creatures on the island.
<br><br>
What unfolded before their eyes was completely beyond their knowledge and expectations.
<br><br>
They couldn't understand why someone would kill the others and destroy everything for no reason.
<br><br>
As the flames continued to roll in the air, all the sea water in the Vast Sea Province was totally evaporated.
<br><br>
Floating high above in midair, Mahoney looked down indifferently.
<br><br>
Once the sea water had evaporated, the boundless salt was released. The salt and the black charcoal mixed together, forming an endless black salt land...
<br><br>
Puff...
<br><br>
The flames in the Minimum Space finally burnt out.
<br><br>
The flaming Vast Sea Province finally regained some semblance of coolness.
<br><br>
Only a minute number of creatures survived. Some of them were powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm who had special Other Shore Tokens, and two were powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm, sitting at the bottom of the sea.
<br><br>
Not long ago, these two supreme elders had been the strongest warriors of two races in the Vast Sea Province. They had fought for a resource for tens of thousands of years, and the two of them had always been at the forefront of the battle.
<br><br>
They hadn't expected that they could lose everything they possessed so quickly. The sea water had been evaporated and their clansmen burnt to a crisp. They were left with nothing.
<br><br>
The two of them looked at each other speechlessly, with awe, horror and hopelessness in their eyes.
<br><br>
Even though they were powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm, they could do nothing about that fire except protect themselves.
<br><br>
Tens of billions of creatures died in fear and anger right in front of them, as they watched.
<br><br>
Negative emotions could be infectious.
<br><br>
One person's negative emotions could be passed to a group, and that group could do the same to the world.
<br><br>
The negative emotions of tens of billions of creatures were like an invisible hammer that slammed down and began to shake the entire Source World.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Even Mahoney seemed to be affected by it. She took a deep breath before darting off towards the province next to the Vast Sea Province.
<br><br>
Chapter 3693 Pushing The Mountain The dreary battle between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race had finally come to an end. Since the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi showed up, the remaining members of the Bearing race were either captured or killed in the battle.
<br><br>
Strictly speaking, the Sun Crow race didn't suffer a heavy loss. However, in exchange for that, they had lost Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Most of the elite warriors of the Sun Crow race, including most members of the Divine Lair and Emperor Charm's royal guards, survived the battle.
<br><br>
During the war, when Emperor Charm was still alive, Elizabeth, Micah, and their other colleagues had undergone fierce mental struggles. When Zen ordered them to attack their emperor, there were a lot of contradictory feelings that couldn't be pushed aside.
<br><br>
Likewise, because they were his loyal subordinates, Emperor Charm wasn't able to fully harm them.
<br><br>
Now that Emperor Charm was no more, it meant that the core of the Sun Crow race had disappeared, and they had no other choice but to follow Zen with all their hearts.
<br><br>
Also, after defeating Emperor Charm, the energy soul of the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi gave up the body out of his own accord.
<br><br>
By then, Flamine, Pearce, and the others had already realized that the Eastern Emperor Taiyi that they knew was still in slumber, and there was someone else who occupied his body. This person was none other than the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi that was inside Zen.
<br><br>
"Considering the troubled times, I must say that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi can still stay in his body since the current one hasn't returned from the Other Shore yet," Pearce suggested In Pearce's mind, the most important thing at present was to ensure the safety of the Oneness Sky Palace. If there came another being that was as powerful as Emperor Charm and attacked them at their chaotic state, he knew that they might not be able to last.
<br><br>
In the meantime, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had already returned to Zen's inner world and entered the Civilization Artifact. Zen served as a mediator to deliver him Pearce's message.
<br><br>
After a while, Zen received Eastern Emperor Taiyi's response and a slight frown became visible on his face. "He refuses. He says that if the Oneness Sky Palace was in danger again, he would definitely help with all his might.
<br><br>
However, he doesn't want to stay in his body if it isn't necessary."
<br><br>
"Really? I heard that all the creatures on the Other Shore are reluctant to leave the chaos.
<br><br>
Why would he refuse to stay?" Pearce asked curiously.
<br><br>
Since he had been working for Eastern Emperor Taiyi for so long, Pearce was quite knowledgeable of the situation.
<br><br>
Those creatures that had been born in the chaos and then later entered the Other Shore, all missed their past old lives in the chaos because they were already trapped on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Some Other Shore creatures were even willing to be carried and become other people's Other Shore Tokens so that they could have a chance to cross and see the chaos again.
<br><br>
However, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi seemed to be unwilling to experience that.
<br><br>
"Maybe it's because he knows that this is just a temporary matter. He may be afraid that he can't give it up later," Auden chimed in and gave his opinion.
<br><br>
Most of the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace who managed to survive were all seriously injured.
<br><br>
Fortunately, due to their high cultivation level, recovery would be a sure thing.
<br><br>
That was why Auden, who also took severe damage during the earlier battle, looked much better now.
<br><br>
"Oh, at least someone understands!" Houyi suddenly appeared and commented on Auden's remark.
<br><br>
"We have been locked in the dark temple for countless years, motionless as a statue. We have lived without any desire, any greed or anything. Yes, it is so exciting to be able to come back to this world and experience the previous life. And that exactly is the main reason why he will be reluctant to leave later. So, he made the right choice!" Houyi explained.
<br><br>
He saw everyone staring at him in a daze. "And yeah, I'm leaving too!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In the blink of an eye, he returned to Zen's inner world too.
<br><br>
"Zen, who was that man?" Pearce couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>
Now they understood that none of the people residing within Zen's body was ordinary, especially the old man that just appeared suddenly and talked directly to the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
"That was Houyi. I borrowed his bow to extinguish Emperor Charm's suns."
<br><br>
Zen explained that the bow and arrows he had used to shoot down Emperor Charm's suns were from Houyi.
<br><br>
Pearce and the others present were all amazed by the story. They had never imagined that humans had once possessed such tremendous abilities.
<br><br>
At the same time, Libby was helping others treat their wounds in a nearby place. Naturally, she heard all the tales told by Zen. A trace of sulk appeared on her delicate and pretty face.
<br><br>
In this war, all her pride turned into dust.
<br><br>
This man, who had advanced so much faster than her, had turned the tide of the entire war all by himself. He had relied on his own abilities to suppress and defeat the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
He put under his control the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows and the members of the Sun Crow race, and ultimately defeated Emperor Charm to end the war.
<br><br>
With that said, everyone else in the Oneness Sky Palace just acted the supporting role.
<br><br>
As for Libby, it was already a great performance from her to be able to help and support Athemar and Goran in their battles.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! While Libby was lost in thought, sounds of explosions were heard coming from inside the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
During the fierce battle between Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm, the center part of the Oneness Mountain had been riddled with huge holes. Moreover, this part was the weakest point of the mountain. As the mountain couldn't bear the pressure from the upper area, the inner part gradually collapsed, and it began to slowly crumble.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Mountain is collapsing!"
<br><br>
someone immediately shouted.
<br><br>
If the upper part of the mountain fell, Dragon City, which was at the foot of the mountain, would be completely crushed to nothingness.
<br><br>
Although the Dragon City had already been in ruins, thanks to the members of the Bearing race, it was not completely destroyed. It could still be salvaged and be brought back to its original state. However, if the Oneness Mountain smashed it down, there would be nothing left to rebuild.
<br><br>
Boom! Crash! Upon seeing that the mountain was continuously tilting sideward, Zen immediately directed his order to the Sun Crow race, "Hold back the Oneness Mountain!"
<br><br>
As soon as they heard the order, the members of the Sun Crow race appeared on the side of the upper part of the Oneness Mountain in a flash.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The combined strength unleashed by several powerful warriors of the Sun Crow race couldn't be underestimated.
<br><br>
Also, some of the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace that had already recovered rushed forward to help the members of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
However, even with the combined efforts of the two groups, it wasn't enough to stop the sliding of the upper part of the Oneness Mountain The mountain was just too huge.
<br><br>
Compared to it, their bodies were like insects who were trying to push off an enormous boulder.
<br><br>
When they exerted their forces and pushed the mountain wall, the soft surface of the mountain began to crumble. As a result, they sank into it.
<br><br>
When the members of the Sun Crow race found this problem, they spread out their wings and tried to increase the surface area of their contact against the mountain. However, this tactic still failed and they also sank into it.
<br><br>
In this kind of situation, it would be easier if the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi used his Wild God Power.
<br><br>
However, since the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had already returned into Zen's inner world, it was not appropriate to call him right away.
<br><br>
As Zen perceived that the situation was getting out of hand, he also dashed and appeared on the side of the mountain.
<br><br>
'There's no other choice. Wild God Body!' In the blink of an eye, Zen turned into a colossal giant, and started pushing the falling part of the mountain with his entire body.
<br><br>
Chapter 3694 Eternal Warriors Even though Zen was an extraordinarily powerful warrior, he couldn't stop the mountain from sliding down.
<br><br>
He could only slow it down a bit.
<br><br>
Libby refused to sit back and watch this happen. Planting her feet firmly into the ground, she leapt and flew towards the sliding mountain in an attempt to block it. However, she ended up drilling right through it, failing even to slow it down.
<br><br>
When she had burst out from the mountain, suddenly, an idea crossed her mind. "Master Athemar, use the Lofty Sword!"
<br><br>
The Lofty Sword itself was massive. Athemar turned to look at her when she called him, and upon hearing her words, he nodded in understanding.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Athemar started to recite the spell. Then, multiple rings of light appeared in the air, and from the center of these huge rings, the Lofty Swords shot out.
<br><br>
In a flash, the huge Lofty Swords planted themselves firmly onto the side of the mountain. Elizabeth, Libby, and the others pressed themselves against the Lofty Swords, trying to push the mountain backward.
<br><br>
Athemar made sure to distribute the Lofty Swords around the mountain evenly, and wherever he looked, a strong warrior had gotten a hold of the Lofty Swords to push back the mountain.
<br><br>
Thanks to this newfound strategy, the collapsing of the upper half of the mountain slowed to a halt! At this time, Pearce finally gathered enough strength to speak. "Auden, you take Athemar and the others to cast the arrays. First, we must fix the mountain body."
<br><br>
Auden nodded and flew to Athemar to relay his orders. Immediately, they began to set up arrays in the area where the mountain initially broke.
<br><br>
It was no easy task to build arrays that would fix such a massive mountain.
<br><br>
Even though these arrays were just enough to make a temporary fix, it took them almost two hours.
<br><br>
As they worked on the arrays, Elizabeth and the others kept on pushing the mountain to keep it from sliding. This exhausted a considerable amount of divine crystals, yet they knew they had no choice but to use the power of their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Two hours later, the arrays were activated, finally stabilizing the mountain.
<br><br>
At the sight of this, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
When Zen saw that the mountain had settled down, he deactivated his Wild God Body and descended to join the others. Once he landed, Pearce stared at him strangely.
<br><br>
It was no secret in the Oneness Sky Palace that Zen had cultivated the Wild God Body.
<br><br>
Actually, even in this era, it wasn't too out of the ordinary to cultivate the Wild God Body.
<br><br>
While wild bones were indeed exhausted, that didn't mean that the super forces hadn't collected any of them from the past. In fact, their stocks were enough to allow a small number of people to cultivate the Wild God Body.
<br><br>
However, the reason why Pearce looked at Zen dubiously was because Wild Gods weren't supposed to be able to enter the Other Shore. Additionally, it was difficult for them to obtain more than one divine megaton of force, so it was practically useless to focus on cultivating the Wild God Body.
<br><br>
However, Zen was different. Not only was he strong in a Wild God Body, but he was also able to enter the Other Shore. This made Pearce finally realize another pressing problem.
<br><br>
"Zen, you really have made rapid progress in such a short period of time after you came to the Oneness Sky Palace," Pearce suddenly said.
<br><br>
Zen cast a confused look at Pearce, unsure of the latter's intentions.
<br><br>
Nodding modestly, he answered simply, "I'm flattered."
<br><br>
Pearce shook his head. "I know your physical body can enter the Other Shore, and naturally you will have great potential in the future. But more than a year ago, you were still in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World. And that was too far from the upper stages. I didn't expect you to step into the Desire World so soon." Pearce paused, his gaze fixed on Zen. "Besides, your soul is extremely stable. You have already reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, right?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded.
<br><br>
It wasn't difficult for him to reach the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. In fact, he was even able to help others reach this level.
<br><br>
"After the ancient times, countless people have reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul," Pearce continued indifferently. "But not a single one of them got the Myriad Tribulations Body. So, since then, no one has stood a chance to enter Stage Thirty-three."
<br><br>
"After ancient times, no one has entered Stage Thirty-three?" Zen echoed in surprise.
<br><br>
"Yes, there are two conditions for one to enter Stage Thirty-three. First, to transcend the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul to become a Holy Soul.
<br><br>
Second, to own the Myriad Tribulations Body. After meeting these two conditions, one will be able to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting in Stage Thirty-two and then get up to Stage Thirty-three, the Three Purities Stage!"
<br><br>
Pearce said excitedly, his eyes flashing with a hint of yearning.
<br><br>
He, Auden, and Athemar had all reached the Holy Soul Realm. But because they couldn't get the Myriad Tribulations Body, they failed to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting. Naturally, this meant they couldn't proceed to Stage Thirty-three. They were forced to limit their cultivation to Stage Thirty-two, which was fruitless.
<br><br>
This was their biggest regret.
<br><br>
Not far away, Micah and Bagot had been listening. The two exchanged helpless looks as they heard what Pearce was saying. They were by no means weak, but because of the Other Shore rules, they too were doomed to share the same fate.
<br><br>
"Eternal Scroll Painting?" Zen asked, his heartbeat quickening.
<br><br>
"Yes, it's a huge scroll painting floating in the air in Stage Thirty-two, with all sorts of powerful creatures drawn in it. The masters who enter the Eternal Scroll Painting are called Eternal Warriors, or 'Eternal Beings',"
<br><br>
Pearce smiled. He was pleased to answer Zen's question.
<br><br>
"Is Eastern Emperor Taiyi also an Eternal Warrior?" Zen asked, raising his eyebrow curiously.
<br><br>
"Yes," Pearce answered. "Only two people from the Oneness Sky Palace are Eternal Warriors: Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasamin. So, naturally, their strength is higher than that of the other five mountain leaders!"
<br><br>
After the battle between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race, Zen had gotten a general understanding of these people's strength.
<br><br>
Previously, he was under the impression that the gap between the other mountain leaders and Eastern Emperor Taiyi wasn't that big. However, now he realized that he had been wrong; while they were only one stage apart in cultivation level, the disparity in strength was extreme! "Your soul and body are qualified. I hope you can enter the Soul City as soon as possible and pass the Land of Bone Tribulation, and become an Eternal Warrior," said Pearce, looking at Eastern Emperor Taiyi who was sitting on the ground. "Maybe you can go to Stage Thirty-three to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi..." he said softly.
<br><br>
"If I'm qualified to become an Eternal Warrior just because my physical body can enter the Other Shore," Zen said, "what about Elvinia?" As he spoke, he looked at Elvinia, who was standing nearby.
<br><br>
Elvinia's situation was a little out of the ordinary.
<br><br>
Her own physical body did not enter the Other Shore, but her purified being's body did.
<br><br>
Pearce smiled. "Maybe. After all, the test of the Eternal Scroll Painting is on the Other Shore. Theoretically, anyone who passes it can enter Stage Thirty-three, but I can't be completely sure."
<br><br>
Elvinia's case was so different, even Eastern Emperor Taiyi could not be sure.
<br><br>
"I will definitely be an Eternal Warrior," Elvinia suddenly said determinedly. "I want to save Father!"
<br><br>
Pearce looked at her dotingly, his wrinkled face full of fondness. "I believe you will do it!"
<br><br>
Elvinia cast a glance at Zen.
<br><br>
She knew in her heart that the key to become the Eternal Warrior was still him.
<br><br>
Under the gaze of Elvinia, Zen looked a little uneasy. He glanced at the Oneness Mountain that had been stabilized and suddenly said, "I need to go back to the Flow Sword Sect!"
<br><br>
Although it was unlikely that the Bearing race would go to the three sword sects, Zen was worried. Now that the war in the Oneness Sky Palace had been settled, it was time for him to go back to check on his family.
<br><br>
The moment he finished speaking, he stretched his arms and launched himself into the sky.
<br><br>
During the battle, the Bearing race had destroyed the arrays that had been set up along the mountain. Because of this, Zen didn't need to climb the mountain anymore, he just flew straight to the top.
<br><br>
Chapter 3695 Taking Them Back To The Inner World The disciples in the Flow Sword Sect had also witnessed the groundbreaking scene.
<br><br>
They watched as the two giant figures of Emperor Charm and Eastern Emperor Taiyi fought fiercely—the sun versus the Golden Rune Sword, respectively.
<br><br>
Anxiously they rooted for their own leader, Eastern Emperor Taiyi. They hated to think about the consequences if he lost.
<br><br>
Trish and Carrie kept on heading outside the courtyard house to inquire if there was any news.
<br><br>
Letitia, however, decided to err on the side of caution and refused to leave the courtyard house.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Margaret was surprisingly calm. She only asked about Zen a few times, concerned for her husband's safety. She didn't concern herself with other matters from the outside.
<br><br>
The people in the courtyard continued to feel the earth quake as the battle raged on below. Initially, the ground trembled ever so slightly, but to their surprise, after a while, it felt like the whole mountain was sliding down! What would become of them if the huge mountain crashed? If it ever came to that, while the disciples of the three sects could easily flee by flying into the sky, they were still worried.
<br><br>
To their relief, the sliding of the mountain lasted only for a short while, and then they felt the ground beneath their feet stabilize once more.
<br><br>
Trish went out to inquire about the matter again and found out that the war in the Oneness Sky Palace had subsided. Relieved, she eagerly returned to relay the news to the others.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen landed in the courtyard. When the women saw Zen, joy filled their faces as they rushed towards him.
<br><br>
Although they believed that Zen would return to them in one piece, they had been worried since the Oneness Sky Palace was almost destroyed.
<br><br>
When they knew their beloved husband was facing powerful warriors of the Sun Crow race, there was nothing they could do but silently pray for his safety.
<br><br>
Thus, seeing him return to them unharmed was a huge relief.
<br><br>
After Zen, Letitia, Margaret and the other girls had settled down, Edna quietly walked out from a corner and asked in a low voice, "Creator, is the Evil God safe?"
<br><br>
Zen had corrected her several times before, telling her not to call him "Creator". It seemed, however, that she was incapable of changing her ways.
<br><br>
At the mention of the Evil God, Zen frowned slightly.
<br><br>
While Edna saw his abrupt change in expression, her heart sank. Could it be that the Evil God had died? She knew that her husband had already been refined into an Inner-world Generating Avatar, which was equivalent to Zen's avatar puppet. In this case, no matter how powerful the Evil God was, it would be difficult for him to betray Zen. He was most likely dead...
<br><br>
Edna was fully prepared to accept this.
<br><br>
"He has escaped," Zen said helplessly, his frown deepening.
<br><br>
"Escaped?" she echoed in surprise. "How is that possible..."
<br><br>
Zen shrugged.
<br><br>
The fact that the Evil God was able to escape was purely an accident. In theory, it was impossible for the Evil God to disobey Zen's orders.
<br><br>
However, when he was faced with the creatures he wasn't able to kill, he was able to flee, taking advantage of Zen's order to prioritize his freedom.
<br><br>
"Sorry..."
<br><br>
Edna apologized, her face full of shock.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "It's not your fault. I was negligent. Don't worry. I'll find him sooner or later."
<br><br>
Zen knew that even if the Evil God had found a way to escape, he was still his Inner-world Generating Avatar.
<br><br>
If they met each other one day, as long as they were close enough in proximity, the Evil God wouldn't be able to disobey Zen.
<br><br>
"Then, can I return to your inner world?" Edna asked.
<br><br>
She considered leaving his inner world as a gift from Zen. Now that the Evil God had wronged him, she felt that she didn't deserve this gift.
<br><br>
She knew that the Evil God would always find ways to disobey Zen.
<br><br>
However, she also was under the impression that the Inner-world Generating Avatar was strong enough to suppress the Evil God. She never thought he'd be able to run away like this. Thinking about this made her uneasy.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Edna indifferently. "I came back here to take Tia, Margaret, and Aura back to the inner world. If you don't want to return with them, I won't force you."
<br><br>
There was no Rebirth Land for Edna in Zen's inner world. Once she left, it was impossible to find she back.
<br><br>
"But," he continued, "the Source World is not peaceful recently. If you travel alone in this world, the chances of finding the Evil God are very small."
<br><br>
Edna was considered one of the top warriors in Zen's inner world, but in the Source World, she was quite weak. With her talent, it was possible she would be able to reach the Other Shore Realm, but it was still a futile mission.
<br><br>
Hearing Zen's words, Edna was stunned for a moment. Then, her eyes lit up excitedly, like a prisoner who had seen the sun for the first time in years...
<br><br>
"Creator, are you willing to let me go?"
<br><br>
"If that's what you want, I won't stop you," Zen repeated.
<br><br>
"Then, I want to leave!" Edna said firmly.
<br><br>
She could stay in Zen's inner world and wait for the Evil God to return, but what she really wanted was to search for him. No matter how dangerous it was, she didn't care.
<br><br>
"But my children are still in your inner world..." Although she loved the Evil God, their ways were different. As a mother, she cared for her children deeply.
<br><br>
"I won't interfere with the development of my inner world. I believe you know that," Zen replied indifferently.
<br><br>
In most cases, Zen would allow his inner world to evolve, and he wouldn't interfere anything unless someone as reckless as Evil God appeared.
<br><br>
Edna nodded. She felt reassured. Her Creator was a man of his word, after all. Without further hesitation, she took her leave. Now that the Oneness Sky Palace was recovering from the turmoil of war, the chances of someone stopping her were slim.
<br><br>
"I've already brought Lavender and the others into my inner world. You can also stay there to avoid any danger. Especially you, Margaret. You need a peaceful environment," Zen said, turning to face her.
<br><br>
Margaret must've changed a lot while he was gone. She nodded meekly, with no objections.
<br><br>
When they heard that Zen was going to take the women into his inner world, Trish and Carrie exchanged worried glances.
<br><br>
In the past few years, Zen's status in the Oneness Sky Palace climbed each day. Consequently, as his maids, Trish's and Carrie's status had also been elevated—at least, among the rest of the maids of the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
Even the other disciples were courteous to them. They had never experienced such respect before Zen came into their lives.
<br><br>
Moreover, the two of them had silently agreed that they would devote their lives to Zen.
<br><br>
Now that Zen was gathering his family to move them back to his inner world, the two maids felt uneasy.
<br><br>
"Mr. Luo, are you not coming back to the Flow Sword Sect?" Trish asked boldly.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Trish and realized shamefacedly that he had completely ignored the two maids.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace is not peaceful now," he said carefully. "If you two are willing to enter my inner world, you can also..."
<br><br>
Zen was still a little hesitant. After all, the two maids were born in the Source World; he was afraid they wouldn't be willing to live in a small inner world.
<br><br>
Yet, to his surprise, before he could even finish speaking, Trish and Carrie shouted in unison, "That would be great!"
<br><br>
Seeing that they couldn't wait to enter his inner world, Zen realized that his hesitation was unnecessary.

The Oneness Sky Palace was focused on clearing up the battlefield.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm and the Bearing race had only managed to destroy the Oneness Mountain and the Dragon City, and the Phoenix Palace had suffered the most damages.
<br><br>
Majority of the palace was smashed to pieces. They had no other choice but to rebuild it.
<br><br>
A few days had passed before the reinforcements from the Pear Hill finally arrived.
<br><br>
Before the Sun Crow race even launched their general attack, the Oneness Sky Palace had already sensed the unrest and sent for the Pear Hill, asking them for help.
<br><br>
However, the distance between the Pear Hill and the Bloom Divine Province was too long.
<br><br>
Besides, the real problem didn't lie in the distance. Just as the reinforcements of the Pear Hill were about to embark on the journey to the Bloom Divine Province, powerful warriors of the Divine Farmer race suddenly showed up in the north of their territory to wreak havoc.
<br><br>
But once the warriors of the Pear Hill showed up to face the Divine Farmer race, they quickly retreated.
<br><br>
It then became clear to them that the Divine Farmer race had just distracted them from helping the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
But even then, they could do nothing about it.
<br><br>
Fuxi had left the Source World because of something important, while the Snake Goddess was busy trying to rescue Eastern Emperor Taiyi from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer race repeated the operation for several times. Their powerful warriors neither launched attacks nor fled away. They just dawdled along the north area, taunting the Pear Hill teasingly.
<br><br>
Although there were also many powerful warriors in the Pear Hill, they couldn't risk leaving it unguarded.
<br><br>
It was not until the powerful warriors of the Divine Farmer race retreated that they dispatched over sixty people to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
However, the battle in the Oneness Sky Palace had already come to an end by the time they arrived. When they heard the news that Emperor Charm had been killed, the powerful warriors from the Pear Hill were shocked.
<br><br>
In their opinion, if Emperor Charm came to the Bloom Divine Province in person, only the Snake Goddess and Fuxi themselves were strong enough to defeat him.
<br><br>
To their surprise, however, it seemed that the Oneness Sky Palace had defeated Emperor Charm on their own.
<br><br>
Pearce smiled at them hospitably, but he didn't tell them all the details.
<br><br>
In his mind, what had happened to Zen was inconceivable. Even if these things were to be disclosed, the only one who should talk about it was Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, from outside the chaos, everything was covered in darkness.
<br><br>
No light, no matter how strong, could illuminate it.
<br><br>
Even if thousands of suns were thrown into the chaos, they would only look like specks of dust amidst the darkness.
<br><br>
There were, however, chaos clouds that emitted faint, brown light.
<br><br>
Among these chaos clouds lurked a huge Black Ship.
<br><br>
The Black Ships had always been notorious for being hard to find.
<br><br>
This one was a little special.
<br><br>
The front end of the ship was made of seven-star obsidian stones, and on both sides of the ship, there were blurry words carved. They looked like enlarged Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Just as the Black Ship emerged from the chaos clouds, a huge set of Eight Diagrams suddenly appeared in front of it.
<br><br>
The Black Ship's path was blocked. It had no choice but to stop above the chaos clouds. As the Eight Diagrams spun furiously, Fuxi appeared behind.
<br><br>
"Eight Diagrams Rope!"
<br><br>
Fuxi shouted.
<br><br>
Eight sets of the Eight Diagrams quickly appeared on all sides of the Black Ship, firmly holding the Black Ship to the spot.
<br><br>
In terms of strength, Fuxi was confident he could defeat any Eternal Warrior in the Source World, even this mysterious captain of this Black Ship.
<br><br>
But Fuxi had an Achilles' heel—his speed was ever so slightly inferior.
<br><br>
The reason why the Thunder Dimorphodon had managed to escape from Fuxi's grasp was because of its avatars and speed.
<br><br>
If Fuxi had managed to catch the Thunder Dimorphodon, one punch from him and it would be dead.
<br><br>
This time, however, Fuxi had learned from his previous mistakes. The minute he determined the location of the captain, he immediately trapped him.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! A wisp of black smoke suddenly floated, rolling continuously till it formed the silhouette of a hooded cloak. The figure wearing the cloak could not be seen clearly.
<br><br>
In fact, no one had ever seen what the captain actually looked like.
<br><br>
His existence was more of a symbol, even in the eyes of the members of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
"Oh, I didn't know the Human Sovereign was visiting. What can I do for you?" the captain asked flatly.
<br><br>
"The Descending Rings of our Chaotic Source World were taken away by the Thunder Dimorphodon," Fuxi answered coldly.
<br><br>
"Human Sovereign," the captain replied indifferently. "Then you can find the Thunder Dimorphodon and take them back from it."
<br><br>
Fuxi snorted. Raising his hand, he threw something into the air.
<br><br>
A ring unfolded, from which a huge bat's head slowly fell out.
<br><br>
When the person in the hooked cloak saw the bat's head, his body trembled slightly. The Thunder Dimorphodon, one of the top ten ferocious beasts in the chaos, had been killed by Fuxi? "Just because I haven't made a move in years, some idiots have already forgotten their place," Fuxi snarled. "They must be tired of living." As soon as he finished speaking, Fuxi threw a punch at the bat's head.
<br><br>
A fist mark with the shadow of Eight Diagrams was imprinted on the bat's head.
<br><br>
"Pop!"
<br><br>
The Thunder Dimorphodon's head instantly burst into fine powder.
<br><br>
The top ten ferocious beasts in the chaos were forces to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
In fact, their strength was comparable to that of an Eternal Warrior.
<br><br>
However, a force as formidable as the Thunder Dimorphodon was still killed by Fuxi! Indeed, Fuxi was quite terrifying.
<br><br>
"The Thunder Dimorphodon has taken away twelve Descending Rings, and six of them have fallen into your hands. Give them back to me," Fuxi said impatiently.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch had offered the Thunder Dimorphodon a handsome price to help them.
<br><br>
However, the Thunder Dimorphodon hadn't expected that, after being rewarded, he'd be chased by Fuxi until the end.
<br><br>
The first few times, it had managed to escape. Ultimately, however, Fuxi captured it. Before the Thunder Dimorphodon died, it had disclosed to Fuxi the whereabouts of the twelve Descending Rings: six went to the Divine Farmer, while the other six had been forcibly taken from it by this Black Ship.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, Fuxi had decided it would be better to go after the Black Ship.
<br><br>
After a moment of silence, the captain said slowly, "Human Sovereign, do you really think I can be trapped by just an Eight Diagrams Rope?"
<br><br>
His Black Ship had crisscrossed the chaos and the Source World. Even though he had pissed off many super forces, he managed to get away each time. That was all because he had a terrifying ability to escape.
<br><br>
"What if I told you I have a Ring of Prediction?" Fuxi asked coldly.
<br><br>
Standing on the deck, the captain in the hooded cloak seemed to be lost in thought once more. After a long time, he sighed quietly. As he stretched out a hand, three Descending Rings appeared. "I can return three Descending Rings to you, but on one condition. If you agree, I will tell you some more valuable information."
<br><br>
When Fuxi saw the three Descending Rings, he felt a little surprised.
<br><br>
He had thought that he would have a fierce battle with the Black Ship. He hadn't expected the captain would give up half of the Descending Rings so easily.
<br><br>
"What condition?" asked Fuxi, eyebrow raised curiously.
<br><br>
"I want those golden red Chaotic Source Spirits in exchange," said the captain bluntly.
<br><br>
"Golden red Chaotic Source Spirits?"
<br><br>
Fuxi was dazed for a few seconds. Then, it hit him.
<br><br>
After the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was killed, Zen had dug out some special Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
At the time, Yan had gifted one of them to Fuxi, so he could study it. Even though Fuxi had pondered over it for a long time, he still hadn't found a way to refine it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3697 Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake Fuxi immediately understood what was behind the Black Ship captain's words.
<br><br>
Until then, he had been misinterpreting things — the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits weren't used to strengthen one's power. Instead, they were necessary when something needed to descend into the chaos.
<br><br>
"And what if I refuse the exchange?" Fuxi then asked.
<br><br>
Thirty golden red Chaotic Source Spirits remained in Yan's hands. As far as he knew, Zen had obtained most of the remaining spirits.
<br><br>
Regardless of whether or not the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits were of great use, Fuxi didn't think it necessary to make the deal with the Black Ship's captain.
<br><br>
He was there to make him hand over the Descending Rings, not make a deal with the man.
<br><br>
"If you don't agree to my terms of exchange, you will never get the Descending Rings from me, believe it or not!" replied the captain of the Black Ship. "The chaos is vast," he added. "It will be easy for me to hide several Descending Rings from you."
<br><br>
Fuxi's face darkened, and a cruel glint flashed in his eyes. He began gathering his power as he threatened, "It seems you're still unwilling to admit defeat."
<br><br>
"Admit defeat?" The Black Ship's captain only smiled faintly and said, "Human Sovereign, you truly have the power to be confident. But have you ever considered why it was so easy for you to find the Black Ship that comes and goes without a trace in the Source World?"
<br><br>
Fuxi's face seemed to turn cautious upon hearing this. Quietly, he took a look around and examined his surroundings.
<br><br>
A black wisp of aura circled the place — something he had failed to detect because of the dark surroundings.
<br><br>
The captain's intent was clear — he knew that Fuxi was tracking the Black Ship, so he had purposely set a trap for Fuxi, giving himself a chance to negotiate with the latter about the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
"I don't have many spirits with me," Fuxi said, stretching out his hand.
<br><br>
The only one he had received from Yan then appeared in his palm.
<br><br>
Two golden beams of light flashed under the captain's cloak. "How many more of them can you get," he asked, sounding excited.
<br><br>
"About thirty," Fuxi answered.
<br><br>
He reported only the number of Chaotic Source Spirits in Yan's hand. While he could ask Zen for more, Fuxi didn't want the Black Ship's captain to get his hands on too many.
<br><br>
"We want all of them," claimed the captain of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
"Don't you think you're being too greedy?" Fuxi said with a frown.
<br><br>
"Not at all. I know you can get more if you want," answered the other nonchalantly.
<br><br>
While the Black Ship had plans to plunder Zen's, they hadn't had time to carry them out. Even without mentioning Zen, though, his threat was clear as day.
<br><br>
"Alright, I'll give you all of them. But you have to tell me what's wrong with the Descending Rings," Fuxi demanded calmly.
<br><br>
After killing the Thunder Dimorphodon, Fuxi had tried to scour the beast's memory.
<br><br>
But it had used a secret technique to jumble up its memories, setting a trap in its soul before it could be killed.
<br><br>
It was this trap Fuxi nearly fell into as he extracted the beast's memories.
<br><br>
"Of course, I will tell you about it. But everything must be done in accordance with the contract…" The captain spoke, rolling up his sleeve.
<br><br>
From under his sleeve, a living Other Shore Token slowly crawled out, revealing a twin-headed snake.
<br><br>
Its scales were of two brilliant colors — the head on the left was a bright red while the head on the right was a deep blue. The snake hissed aggressively out in the open.
<br><br>
"Is this… a Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake?" Once Fuxi identified the snake, his expression was flooded with astonishment.
<br><br>
"Human Sovereign, once you return to the Pear Hill, I won't be able to touch you. To honor our contract, please choose a snake head!" announced the captain of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
The Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake was an Other Shore Token of Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. It was the kind with strange habits and exceptionally powerful abilities.
<br><br>
Usually, it appeared before warriors who encountered desperate situations on Stage Thirty-three, otherwise known as the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
Previously, Fuxi had been forced into a desperate situation, having been chased by a swarm of powerful bees in a pool of the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
At the very end of the pool, he bumped into a Contract-restricting Twinheaded Snake that had offered to bail him out of danger, but he was required to complete a task for it in return.
<br><br>
Back then, Fuxi was left with no choice but to accept the terms — it was his means of survival.
<br><br>
Once he agreed, the twin-headed snake followed through on its end of the contract.
<br><br>
And afterwards, to keep his promise, Fuxi spent five to six thousand years on the edge of the Three Purities Stage to complete the snake's contract.
<br><br>
No one knew of the snake's nature — it seemed to appear before those who needed help.
<br><br>
It was a miraculous creature.
<br><br>
Some regarded it as a kind of mascot, while others saw it as a curse. But fulfilling its contracts was no easy task. Breaching it also meant a terrible price.
<br><br>
Most people who had been to the Three Purities Stage had either witnessed or heard of this magical creature.
<br><br>
But no one had ever managed to fuse with it as an Other Shore Token for them to carry in their inner world and bring to the chaos.
<br><br>
As the snake twisted its body, the red head suddenly spoke out in human language, "The contract is bound by lethal poison. So long as you keep your promise, the poison will be detoxified! Choose a snake head and make your contract now!"
<br><br>
"It makes no difference to me," Fuxi exclaimed.
<br><br>
In the next moment, he rushed to the deck and reached out to the twinheaded snake.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The red snake head then bit Fuxi's arm at lightning speed. Its venomous fangs didn't pierce the skin, instead, it left a unique bite mark.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, the blue snake head bit on the captain's arm.
<br><br>
And so the contract and its restrictions came into effect at the same time.
<br><br>
Both Fuxi and the Black Ship's captain were under their influence completely.
<br><br>
Once they were bound to the contract, the Black Ship's captain handed three Descending Rings to Fuxi as he explained, "These Descending Rings indeed help Other Shore creatures descend into the chaos, but they can't avoid the punishment of the truth. I've tried several times — every creature that descends into the chaos ends up being eradicated by the truth."
<br><br>
He promptly detailed the results of using the Descending Rings to Fuxi.
<br><br>
As Fuxi listened to his explanations, he realized that if it were him, he'd attribute the problem to the lack of golden red Chaotic Source Spirits as well — he understood why the captain of the Black Ship wanted to obtain them.
<br><br>
But a thought came to his mind just then, and his expression changed upon remembering it.
<br><br>
It was no secret that Zen had obtained most of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Both the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race must have known of it.
<br><br>
If the Yellow Thearch along with the others also aimed at the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, that meant Zen and the Oneness Sky Palace would also likely be in great trouble.
<br><br>
"Please send your men to the Pear Hill. I will ask someone to hand over the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits to you. I need to leave now!" After cupping hands, Fuxi employed the Grand Teleportation technique to quickly travel through the chaos.
<br><br>
"He is in such a hurry…looks like he figured it out, but it's all too late,"
<br><br>
murmured the Black Ship's captain once Fuxi left. "I bet the Oneness Sky Palace must have been conquered by now."
<br><br>
As Fuxi chased after the Black Ship, it had kept a close eye on the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
So he knew all there was to know about the war between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
But the result hadn't yet reached the Black Ship's captain — he believed that the Oneness Sky Palace was doomed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3698 The Land of Ashes Four days had passed since the Oneness Sky Palace stabilized, and Zen finally got into his inner world.
<br><br>
The moment he transformed into his incarnation, he spotted a huge round leaf that hovered in the sky. This leaf floated and rotated in midair, and glowed with a light green hue.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened at the sight of the leaf. With a flash, he came to the side of the leaf.
<br><br>
Right above the leaf were human beings who happened to be busy. They were carving strange arrays across the leaf.
<br><br>
Apparently, they were from the human race's Civilization Artifact, and they belonged to the human race of the 77th chaos.
<br><br>
When Zen created a separate continent for them, they never stopped building in his inner world.
<br><br>
"Excuse me, but what is this leaf?" Zen asked into the air, hoping one of them to answer.
<br><br>
One of them looked up as he recognized Zen's voice. After all, he was their ruler.
<br><br>
However, though Zen was their ruler, they were a cocky race. Because they were not born and raised in Zen's inner world, they did not revere him with respect and authority.
<br><br>
"It's the Divine Aura Leaf," one of them responded, without even looking up.
<br><br>
"And what is its use?" Zen continued.
<br><br>
"It has the ability to speed up cultivations of all the creatures in the world,"
<br><br>
the same man responded.
<br><br>
After hearing this, Zen paced around to get a better look at the leaf. He didn't realize that the Primeval Lord of Heaven would have these people cultivate such a useful feat in his inner world! He walked towards the edge of the leaf and small balls were floating a few feet away. "What are those?"
<br><br>
"They are Transformation Balls," the man replied, and without hesitation, he continued to explain, "Any True God can enter the Transformation Ball to cultivate, strengthen their souls, and make necessary preparations to enter the Other Shore..."
<br><br>
"And what are those storms in the distance?" Zen asked, pointing towards the dense grey clouds.
<br><br>
Looking around, Zen did not expect the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the rest to build so many things while he was gone.
<br><br>
Because he was gone for so long, Zen didn't know that the Primeval Lord of Heaven gathered the vast majority of the elites in the 77th chaos. Back then, they had created the most suitable cultivation methods and the most convenient methods, too.
<br><br>
After the Primeval Lord of Heaven confirmed Zen's inner world was indeed a primitive land, he put a lot of hard work into making it what it was now.
<br><br>
Aside from using the inner world as land, he also explored Zen's inner world in detail, including the forbidden lands and the composition of the races. Afterwards, he asked Fuxi and the rest to come up with a plan that would change the inner world completely.
<br><br>
No matter what, Zen believed in these humans and their potential. It was no surprise that he'd gifted the Primeval Lord of Heaven with full disposal of his inner world.
<br><br>
He was just surprised to see that it had been rebuilt and improved in such a short period of time.
<br><br>
In fact, not only did the Primeval Lord of Heaven modify the world, he had also guided it singlehandedly.
<br><br>
In the past, Zen's world structure was simple. This was when the powerful warriors in the entire world were controlled by the Evil God, and soon after, Edna and her clan controlled them. At that time, they wanted to control the inner world and had no interest in strengthening the humans. This was what made them such brutal tyrants.
<br><br>
However, after the Primeval Lord of Heaven took control of the world, he completely changed the dynamic.
<br><br>
This birthed the ancient legends that told people about the divine gate that led to the heaven. When one reached the True God Realm, they could step into the divine gate and reach such paradise.
<br><br>
In addition, they provoked the battles among several great forces, which sent the cultivation atmosphere to grow tense. Left and right, all sorts of creatures cultivated themselves to grow stronger. In the end, this was what the Primeval Lord of Heaven wanted to see.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Just as Zen finally grasped all the new knowledge, wisps of golden light flashed in the distance, rocketing into the sky.
<br><br>
"Then what is it?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"That... I'm not sure," the man replied, looking puzzled as ever.
<br><br>
The flashing lights seemed odd, so Zen took it upon himself to find out.
<br><br>
He teleported right to the place where the golden light was shining. There, he was shocked to be among a lot of large, golden pillars.
<br><br>
In the center of the pillars stood the Primeval Lord of Heaven, looking up at them with a big, genuine smile across his face.
<br><br>
"The Truth of Five Orientations, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent and the Truth of Void Destruction..." Zen looked around as he noticed the words etched on each pillar.
<br><br>
In total, there were 14 golden pillars, 13 of which had the Truths of Godly Ways recorded on them. However, one of the pillars was completely blank.
<br><br>
"Why did you engrave the Truths of Godly Ways here?" Zen asked politely.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed. "This is for the cultivation of the creatures in the primitive land. You might have forgotten, but because this is the primitive land, people here can reach the Other Shore once they comprehend the Truth of Godly Way."
<br><br>
Was it possible for the creatures in his inner world to be on the Other Shore with him? Zen had never thought about it.
<br><br>
"This blank golden pillar..."
<br><br>
Zen spoke out, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven interrupted, "I plan to engrave the Truth of Three-Energy Construction on it." As he walked towards the blank pillar, he added, "However, as you said, King Manard only imparted the Truth of Three-Energy Construction to you. I won't ask you to engrave it just yet. We may discuss things when we see King Manard."
<br><br>
"Then we can go now," Zen said enthusiastically.
<br><br>
This was perfect, especially since Zen already agreed to visit King Manard along with the Primeval Lord of Heaven before. Because of the war in the Oneness Sky Palace, their meeting had been severely delayed.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes lit up. "That is good."
<br><br>
He did not mean to be abrupt, but he had been waiting for this moment for a long time.
<br><br>
After they shook hands, Zen dissipated his incarnation while the Primeval Lord of Heaven summoned people from the book.
<br><br>
Right there and then, the energy souls of Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Emperor Charm, Zhurong, Gonggong and the others appeared beside the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Each of them had a personal interest in King Manard, but mostly, they wanted to meet King Manard who created the second Other Shore in the Land of Ashes.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, after dispersing his incarnation, Zen reappeared in his room, sitting cross-legged. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and began to silently activate the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
After a few moments of silence, a mysterious Truth of Godly Way surrounded him and he appeared in another space. It was not someplace unfamiliar, because this was the space Mount had exiled him to before.
<br><br>
He opened his eyes and looked around. In the distance, the ruins connected, and eventually formed a long, thin "trash belt".
<br><br>
Not long after, the Primeval Lord of Heaven led his group and they all appeared right above Zen's head. There were over 30 heads floating above him.
<br><br>
Seeing so many heads, Zen couldn't help but be a little tense.
<br><br>
However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others did not let petty worries bother them. Their eyes widened as they tried to familiarize themselves with the space.
<br><br>
"Everything in the Land of Ashes should have been destroyed, but these things were preserved so well. This is incredible..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke out, admiring this special space.
<br><br>
"What's more incredible is that King Manard has also transformed this world into an Other Shore," the Snake Goddess pointed out.
<br><br>
Chapter 3699 Ziya Jiang After moving along the trash belt for some time, they saw the dim light of the Deleting Pillars in the distance.
<br><br>
On his first time coming here, Zen had been disoriented and become a captive of those little monsters. This time, he was more level-headed and could appreciate the scenery.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! As they passed through the trash city, a few one-eyed monsters would crawl out of the remains and stare at them with wide-eyed awe.
<br><br>
These monsters no longer had enmity with Zen but when he passed, they would constantly jump around to surround him.
<br><br>
"These creatures all have very special auras," the Snake Goddess remarked.
<br><br>
It was not every day that the Snake Goddess and the others found something special. They had lived through many chaotic eras and witnessed the births of countless creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
They'd seen the unique creatures of the Metal Civilization and the Regal Jade Civilization so their shock threshold was set quite high.
<br><br>
Judging only from their appearance, these one-eyed little monsters looked ordinary but, just as the Snake Goddess said, the auras they exuded were special. In fact, they felt similar to the Truth of Three-Energy Construction Zen released.
<br><br>
Zen opted to provide them with an explanation. "The Truth of Three-Energy Construction is composed of three kinds of energy which allows me to construct things out of the void at will. Three kinds of monsters reside here and it seems that King Manard distributed the three kinds of energy among them."
<br><br>
Curiosity filled the Snake Goddess's eyes. "Oh? Is that so?"
<br><br>
Among all the heroes, she had always been the most curious, always inquisitive about what was happening in the world.
<br><br>
This was the reason why the Snake Goddess in the Source World often went out to explore, desperate to search for the human race on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven continued to size up his surroundings and contemplated their situation.
<br><br>
As they passed through the remains, the small star suddenly appeared.
<br><br>
On this planet was a huge statue.
<br><br>
"This is the statue of King Manard," Zen told them.
<br><br>
All eyes were fixed onto the statue, interested to know what he looked like and what kind of person he was.
<br><br>
There was no way King Manard, who was very clear about the Finale Way of the human race, could be an unknown figure in the human race.
<br><br>
He was the one who knew what Other Shore Tokens had been used and who executed the plans.
<br><br>
There was a moment of silence as everyone took their time to look at his statue.
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
It was Zen who first spoke. "Can any of you recognize him?" he asked.
<br><br>
"No."
<br><br>
"I've never seen him before!"
<br><br>
The response was unanimous. None of them knew who King Manard was.
<br><br>
Zen shrugged. "It doesn't matter. Once you meet him, you'll know who he is." He gently leapt onto the planet and flew towards the Deleting Pillars.
<br><br>
King Manard's palace was located at the node between the pillars and it was not difficult to find it.
<br><br>
Not long after, Zen arrived at the door of the palace just in time for Houyi, Snake Goddess, and all the other phantoms to retreat back into his inner world.
<br><br>
Two figures greeted him: a handsome man and an enchanting woman who were both disciples of King Manard.
<br><br>
These two were the only ones who stayed while King Manard led his other disciples to explore outside the chaos.
<br><br>
They knew Zen very well and greeted him with gladness and respect.
<br><br>
"Zen," the handsome man greeted by cupping his hands in front of him.
<br><br>
Zen returned the gesture. "May I know if your master, King Manard, is in the palace?"
<br><br>
The king was always out exploring the outside of chaos and it was not an easy feat to find him.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the handsome disciple nodded. "Yes. He is meditating in the palace. Have you got any news about the human race on the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
The two disciples grew up in this world and could only imagine what the chaos and the Other Shore looked like. However, they were concerned about their master's wish.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "Yes, I have."
<br><br>
The handsome man's eyes crinkled with joy. His master would be very happy to hear the news.
<br><br>
"I'll go and ask my master to come out!" he exclaimed with enthusiasm.
<br><br>
He quickly turned around to summon King Manard while the enchanting woman invited Zen in.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, Zen heard a hearty laugh just as a figure appeared beside him. "Haha, Zen! You've only been away for a short time but you already have news about the human race on the Other Shore?" There was expectation on his face but it was tinged with a hint of doubt.
<br><br>
"Legitimate news or groundless rumors?" King Manard asked.
<br><br>
He had previously gathered a bit of information about the human race on the Other Shore, courtesy of Zen, the Regal Jade Spirit, and No. 9527.
<br><br>
Traces of the human race popped up here and there but they were terribly good at hiding themselves from their opponents. Even the top ten civilizations, such as the Regal Jade Civilization, had never found them on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
There was very little chance for Zen to have found them on his own.
<br><br>
"I assure you, what I have aren't groundless rumors," Zen assured King Manard with a smile.
<br><br>
The king stared at him with a cautious look in his eyes.
<br><br>
Upon closer inspection, he could see numerous souls curling up in Zen's body.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Houyi, Emperor Charm, Gonggong, Zhurong...
<br><br>
One by one, the former heroes of the human race floated above Zen's head with the Primeval Lord of Heaven coming in last.
<br><br>
The sight of all these people rendered King Manard speechless.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was the first to speak. "I've heard about you from Zen. He told me that you are very familiar with our methods of completing the Finale Way in the past. You are by no means a nameless person in our human race. King Manard is not your real name." This declaration echoed through the hall as the Primeval Lord of Heaven uttered his critical question, "Who on earth are you?"
<br><br>
Plop! To everyone's surprise, King Manard plopped down onto the floor and knelt in front of the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Even Zen wasn't expecting this.
<br><br>
"Master!" King Manard's voice was full of excitement and adoration as he kowtowed.
<br><br>
Even his two disciples were shocked. They had never seen him like this before.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, whom King Manard was calling, was also confused.
<br><br>
He had accepted twelve disciples in the past and only these twelve had the privilege of calling him 'master.' After failing to complete the Finale Way, some died and a few others left. Nevertheless, he recalled every single one of their faces.
<br><br>
Who the hell was this King Manard? Seeing the slight embarrassment on the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face, King Manard quickly remembered the fact that he had changed his appearance years ago, over a thousand chaotic eras to be more precise.
<br><br>
Even his own aura had undergone a tremendous change. Of course his old master wouldn't be able to recognize him! King Manard quickly raised his hand and gently brushed his face, activating the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. His face began to morph until it returned to its original appearance.
<br><br>
"Ziya Jiang?"
<br><br>
"Ziya? Unbelievable!"
<br><br>
"Ziya! You are still alive?!"
<br><br>
(*TN: Jiang Ziya was an ancient Chinese military strategist, and also a main character in the popular novel Fengshen Bang written over 2, 500 years after his lifetime.) Everyone immediately recognized him once he revealed his true appearance.
