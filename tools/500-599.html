Chapter 3500 The New Record As the Land of Sword Grief's top warrior, Libby had also chosen a senior disciple to challenge when she first arrived. Her ranking had gone up to the 300th right after that battle.
<br><br>
It used to be an unprecedented record.
<br><br>
But today, this fact changed.
<br><br>
Never did anyone imagine that Zen could easily break that record.
<br><br>
Some disciples even believed that if it weren't for the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, Zen could easily challenge a second-floor disciple right away and ascend to the second floor on his first day.
<br><br>
After Zen left the arena, he quietly retreated to the side.
<br><br>
All the newcomers had to challenge at least one opponent after reaching the Land of Sword Grief to gain new rankings.
<br><br>
Many newcomers challenged each other as the rankings on the stone constantly shifted.
<br><br>
Among these newcomers were some warriors who could fight against the low-ranking senior disciples.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Elvinia, Milo, and Chaim were among such competent warriors.
<br><br>
But to be cautious, they chose not to challenge any senior disciples just yet.
<br><br>
Over a hundred people chose their own opponents and quickly carried out the one-on-one battles.
<br><br>
The number of names on the Ranking Stone continued to grow.
<br><br>
As expected, Chaim, Elvinia, and Dorothy ranked between the 1, 117th and 1, 125th.
<br><br>
But these rankings were merely temporary.
<br><br>
If one had extraordinary talent like Milo and Chaim, they could easily make rapid progress. Surpassing the Lust World, arriving at the Desire World and carrying the new Other Shore Tokens, most especially, promoted a quick rise in the rankings.
<br><br>
About six hours later, all the new disciples' rankings had been decided.
<br><br>
And so the Land of Sword Grief assigned everyone to their respective training rooms based on the rankings.
<br><br>
Once they entered the Land of Sword Grief, the warriors received their monthly salaries from the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
They were no longer "disciples", but "officials" of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
So long as they made steady progress, they could become influential top warriors.
<br><br>
As officials, they received proper compensation.
<br><br>
Salaries were decided according to their training room numbers.
<br><br>
The salary for the warrior of the first room was special and offered according to the second floor standards, so everyone was naturally envious of it.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen settled down in the first room, the top thirty warriors had immediately decided to exercise their right to challenge Zen at the beginning of the next month.
<br><br>
Although Cleon was thoroughly defeated, many people were making speculations about Zen and believed they could take him down.
<br><br>
Zen didn't look particularly powerful, after all.
<br><br>
Just as the first-floor seniors did, many warriors on the second floor were already paying close attention to Zen.
<br><br>
At the beginning of the next month, Zen had the right to challenge them too.
<br><br>
Now, his target was probably on the second floor, since he was already ranked first on the first floor.
<br><br>
But who would he choose to duel? On the first day, many newcomers had settled in.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were all busy—they were either heading off to the Dragon City to get tasks or training on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Normally, disciples were regularly heading in and out of the bronze palace.
<br><br>
And on their way, they'd take a look at the Ranking Stone.
<br><br>
Rankings on the stone generally changed at the beginning of every month.
<br><br>
As it was only in the middle of this month, most people paid particular attention to the new disciples.
<br><br>
"What... What happened?"
<br><br>
A middle-aged man clad in black suddenly exclaimed in front of the stone.
<br><br>
Some of the disciples next to him didn't seem fazed by his reaction.
<br><br>
Once Zen's name appeared, every person who happened to pass by the stone expressed some reasonable shock and disbelief.
<br><br>
"What… Cleon has been surpassed? This name on top isn't familiar at all!"
<br><br>
the man continued to yell.
<br><br>
"Well, he is a newcomer, after all," someone responded.
<br><br>
"How is it possible? The newcomers only just arrived today. Am I blind or is something wrong with the stone?" It would be hard to believe the fact without seeing it with their own eyes.
<br><br>
"You can consider it a mistake if you wish," said the man beside him, his lips curling strangely.
<br><br>
The middle-aged man clad in black took a moment of thought in front of the Ranking Stone before leaving. Realizing he had missed a wonderful battle, he hurried off to learn more about the story.
<br><br>
Another three came in after him.
<br><br>
Taking a look at the Ranking Stone, they were just as shocked as the man who came in before them.
<br><br>
"Damn it! What happened today?"
<br><br>
"Did we miss something?"
<br><br>
"He's a newcomer, isn't he?"
<br><br>
New names were only added to the Ranking Stone every ten years.
<br><br>
Naturally, most people could tell that Zen was a newcomer at a glance.
<br><br>
The several disciples guarding the Ranking Stone looked uneasy.
<br><br>
All they could do was to briefly explain the matter before sending the three guys away.
<br><br>
It was expected that all the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief would be greatly surprised after seeing the Ranking Stone.
<br><br>
Of course, Cleon was the most displeased.
<br><br>
He wasn't in the mood to cultivate at all, that day. Instead, he stood by the door of the second training room and quietly observed all the people get amazed by the Ranking Stone.
<br><br>
Someone had surpassed him beyond imagination, and he couldn't shake off the feeling of dejection.
<br><br>
From the outside, the bronze palace's training rooms looked very small.
<br><br>
But their interior area was as spacious as a palace.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't planned to stay in the Land of Sword Grief for very long, and he'd have preferred to stay in his courtyard house of the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
But it wasn't appropriate for him to leave so soon, as he had just arrived there, after all.
<br><br>
After night fell, Zen pulled out the Regal Jade chessboard and let the Regal Jade statues descend for his training.
<br><br>
The battle with Cleon did not turn out as easy as he thought it would.
<br><br>
While the strength of his Chaotic Source Spirits already seemed overbearing, he was still at the primary stage of the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
The gap between him and Cleon was undeniable.
<br><br>
But Zen could still use his Truth of Godly Way to ease the fatigue of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The endless Truth of Godly Way and the Chaotic Source Spirits formed a unique closed loop, extending the lasting time of the Chaotic Source Spirits to a great extent and easing their fatigue. The two complemented each other, doubling the power that could be produced.
<br><br>
The next morning, two stewards of the Land of Sword Grief knocked on the newcomers' training rooms and told them to enter the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After reaching the Chaotic Source Realm, one should be well-prepared to break through to the Desire World.
<br><br>
As the stewards informed the disciples, they realized that there was one missing.
<br><br>
When they felt confused, they discovered that this disciple was actually in the first room at the far right of the first floor, which surprised them so much.
<br><br>
Chapter 3501 Get Ready After receiving the notice from the two stewards, Zen headed back to his cultivation room.
<br><br>
In his room, he recited a Truth of Godly Way, and his Soul of Light immediately returned to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The newcomers in the other cultivation rooms also gathered themselves in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But what Elvinia was going through was different from all the others.
<br><br>
When her Soul of Light had left the Other Shore, her body remained in the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
As she finally entered the Other Shore, her eyes began to flutter and open in the stronghold.
<br><br>
She got up and carefully examined her body, trying to familiarize herself before walking outside.
<br><br>
At this time of the day, many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had gathered together. Some gasped and others whispered when seeing Elvinia walking out.
<br><br>
Few people knew that she had a physical body at the Other Shore. So they were much surprised seeing she walk out like a creature at this place.
<br><br>
In fact, she had so many options to cover up her identity. For instance, she could wear a veil to hide her face.
<br><br>
However, people from the Bearing race and other races had already seen her, so there was no point to hide.
<br><br>
A lot of newcomers of the Land of Sword Grief had arrived. Surprisingly, even Sally, Hutton and other Nine Li warriors had gathered here too. But for some reason, Chaim was nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
Yesterday, he had entered the Other Shore in advance after the intense fights in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore, he had descended from Stage Thirteen down to Stage Four to obtain some necessary resources for their breakthrough to Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
More than an hour had passed and people could finally spot Chaim heading towards them.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry to have worried everyone," said Chaim with a smile. The space ring in his hand began to glimmer, from which dark gold wheels started to appear. "Although you have already reached the Chaotic Source Realm, you still need a matchable Other Shore Token to become a real Chaotic Source Realm warrior," he explained. "Once in Stage Fourteen, you should fuse with a new one. Only then will you have the real strength of the Chaotic Source Realm. If all of this is accomplished, you won't have any more problems in challenging others in the Land of Sword Grief! These Cloud Flying Wheels are the key to ascend to Stage Fourteen. Lucky for you guys, I'll be giving one to each of you."
<br><br>
The people he was addressing were all newcomers to the Chaotic Source Realm. The thing that separated them and those high-level ones at the same realm was, in fact, the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Apart from Zen, Elvinia and Dorothy, the rest of the people's Other Shore Tokens only had no more than one thousand divine megatons of force. To fuse with better Other Shore Tokens was something they needed to do now.
<br><br>
As Chaim was distributing the Cloud Flying Wheels one by one, Zen asked in a low voice, "Can I have one more of this?"
<br><br>
A smile graced Chaim's blurry face. He then held out two Cloud Flying Wheels and handed them to Zen.
<br><br>
As he finished distributing the wheels, Chaim turned back and took out finger-size chunks of soul crystal.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace had spent heavily at this point in time. It had taken out almost all the soul crystal it had accumulated over the years.
<br><br>
The reason was simple. The closing of the Chaotic Source World meant that there would be no new Chaotic Source Realm warriors in the future. The Oneness Sky Palace had used all its resources on the last batch of Chaotic Source Realm warriors.
<br><br>
The sight of the crystal excited many disciples. They began absorbing the soul crystal as soon as they got it.
<br><br>
After they had gotten ready, they all left for the other end of Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
They didn't see many Souls of Light along the way.
<br><br>
If a person managed to step in Stage Thirteen, he or she had already been taken to the Chaotic Source World last time.
<br><br>
Those who couldn't enter the Chaotic Source World belonged to minor sects or weak forces.
<br><br>
After the members of many super forces returned to their own races, they began to enter Stage Fourteen all at once. This was not the case for Zen, though. He and his companions had been delayed for a few days at Pear Hill. In fact, they might be the last batch of people heading to Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
As they passed by the Dark Region, Zen kept looking into the darkness.
<br><br>
Likewise, Elvinia concentrated and watched very carefully. She whispered to Zen, "Do you think the three-eyed boy is still in there?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded, "Yes, I think so."
<br><br>
The last time they were there, they were forced by the three-eyed boy to make countless candles.
<br><br>
But then accidentally, Elvinia became a purified being while Zen inherited the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
For some reason, the three-eyed boy seemed to be against Blood Assembly.
<br><br>
Zen had no clue if they would ever come across each other again.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Dorothy had only been listening to their whispers, but kept silent. She seemed quite down.
<br><br>
Since she and Zen had entered the Other Shore, the two had had some secrets to one another that others were clueless to. However, after the events that unfolded in the Dark Region, Elvinia suddenly became involved.
<br><br>
On the other end of Stage Thirteen, there were many huge, scattered temples.
<br><br>
Most of the temples had already been explored, and each of them recorded a civilization of the past.
<br><br>
Hence, the group of Zen merely passed these temples and continued to move forward. The darkness on both sides continued to spread out towards the center of the road, making it a narrow belt. It seemed that the narrowest place was five feet wide.
<br><br>
"Twitter twitter."
<br><br>
"Hiss."
<br><br>
The creatures that roamed in the darkness seemed to be moving.
<br><br>
At one point, they even began to hear some voices. This brought chills down their spines.
<br><br>
"The road seems to be growing narrower by the minute..."
<br><br>
"The Dark Region is expanding fast. It's only a matter of time until this road is completely consumed by darkness."
<br><br>
"What if the creatures in the Dark Region begin to rush out at us?"
<br><br>
Sally asked, holding on to Hutton's clothes tightly. Nothing frightened her more than being killed in Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
Noticing the fear in her, Chaim reassured them, "Don't be afraid, everyone! The Dark Region is forbidden to us, as much as the Light Region is forbidden to the creatures in the Dark Region. If they come here, they will die for sure."
<br><br>
"That's right," Zen agreed. "We'll be fine."
<br><br>
However, just as Zen finished speaking, several tentacles suddenly squirmed from the Dark Region beside him. They began to make their way towards the light, and for some reason, were unharmed. These tentacles belonged to a plant, and its dark green skin could tolerate the Light Region for a short while! "Hiss hiss hiss."
<br><br>
The tentacles had begun to melt gradually in the light. But before they could completely melt, they had already wrapped themselves around Zen's neck and dragged him to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Ah! Look!"
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"Watch out..."
<br><br>
The others, who had just been reassured of their protection in the light, had no idea what to do.
<br><br>
And even if they did have a plan, it might not have been enough to save Zen in time.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Just then, Elvinia moved quickly and waved her hands at the sky, shedding bright light to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The demon plant screamed in agony, twisting and hissing madly from the effect of Elvinia's light.
<br><br>
Just like that, the plant had completely melted.
<br><br>
Though Zen's Soul of Light had been dragged into the Dark Region, the light led by Elvinia protected him from further damage.
<br><br>
Chapter 3502 The Energy Vortex Though it was a false alarm, the disciples who witnessed what happened couldn't help but feel frightened.
<br><br>
They tried to huddle together in the very narrow path.
<br><br>
But Zen remained calm.
<br><br>
After all, he had stayed in the Dark Region for a period of time and already knew how dangerous it was.
<br><br>
Moreover, they had Elvinia, who was a purified being, by their side. They could even roam the Dark Region freely if they wanted to.
<br><br>
Zen stood up and returned to the path. When he felt the fear among the disciples, he smiled and said, "You see, the creatures in the Dark Region are no match for Princess Elvinia."
<br><br>
"Everyone, please go first. I'll protect you," Elvinia announced.
<br><br>
The disciples just nodded and mentally sighed.
<br><br>
Many talented warriors had come forth among this generation in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
There were so many talents that even a genius like Milo, who was capable of Instant Enlightenment, was not considered outstanding among them.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he had been making miracles in both the Chaotic Source World and the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Elvinia, who was considered as mediocre in the Source World, was quite invincible on the Other Shore. She was incredibly skilled in killing the creatures in the Dark Region so easily, which was unheard of.
<br><br>
The disciples lined up in a straight line and continued to move forward on the narrow path, while Elvinia stayed behind to protect them.
<br><br>
Perhaps, Elvinia's ability shocked the creatures in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The roars that echoed in the Dark Region had completely died down. They didn't encounter any attacks along their way anymore.
<br><br>
After they walked along the narrow path for about ten minutes, the path finally became wide and a stone platform appeared in front of them. This stone platform was the edge of the Lust World.
<br><br>
The sky in the distance seemed to be washed with various colors of water.
<br><br>
It was quite a sight to behold.
<br><br>
Among the many hues was a small black hole, where all the colors apparently came from. "The energy contained in those flowing colors is so unique," said Zen as he gazed into the horizon.
<br><br>
He could clearly perceive the energy within those colors. It was extremely powerful and similar to the Ways-blending Energy, but they differed in aura.
<br><br>
Dorothy stared at the colors and said, "It is said that it's the energy of the Other Shore. It is the one that forms the thirty-three stages, little by little."
<br><br>
"The energy of the thirty-three stages?" Zen repeated, his eyebrows raised in surprise. "Yes, that's true," Chaim said with a nod.
<br><br>
"But we can't use the energy, so no one has ever studied it," he added.
<br><br>
"Chaim, is that vortex the place we are going to pass through?" Sally asked as she walked beside them. "Yes," Chaim confirmed.
<br><br>
"Now that we have arrived at the destination, we can advance to Stage Fourteen. We can't help each other from now on. We can only rely on ourselves and the Cloud Flying Wheels in your hands. Mind the colorful ribbons, as they are actually an extremely powerful flow of energy. Once you are sucked in, no one would be able to save you," he explained.
<br><br>
When he finished, everyone felt their hearts sink in their chests.
<br><br>
They were lucky enough to reach the Chaotic Source Realm, but it did not mean that their troubles were over.
<br><br>
They were still weak Souls of Light on the Other Shore, after all.
<br><br>
"Who goes first?" Chaim asked. The disciples fell into silence.
<br><br>
To be fair, it was their first time to experience such a thing, and the ones who went first would clearly face the biggest risks.
<br><br>
"Me," a man said as he stepped out. It turned out to be Milo, a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
"Milo, please," said Chaim with his cupped hands.
<br><br>
Milo did not feel any fear for what he must endure.
<br><br>
In a few moments, he stood on the edge of the stone platform and activated the Cloud Flying Wheel in his hand.
<br><br>
A thick cloud appeared as the Cloud Flying Wheel rotated continuously in his palm. At the same time, a force was exerted on his Soul of Light, which pushed him straight out of the stone platform and sent him flying in the air.
<br><br>
Milo's figure flew higher and higher, until he was just like a tiny black dot to everyone below. Still, they could see his location through the white cloud that the Cloud Flying Wheel had created.
<br><br>
Eventually, the white cloud approached the colorful vortex.
<br><br>
The closer one got to the vortex, the more dangerous it was for them.
<br><br>
Therefore, Milo controlled the Cloud Flying Wheel to carefully swirl amidst the energy ribbons.
<br><br>
Soon enough, he arrived at the center of the vortex. He felt as if an invisible gravitational force pulled him in, and then he was suddenly sucked into the vortex.
<br><br>
"The next one," said Chaim after Milo disappeared in the energy vortex.
<br><br>
Once the disciples saw how smoothly Milo went into the vortex, they felt braver and more encouraged. Another disciple took out his Cloud Flying Wheel and directly flew towards the energy vortex.
<br><br>
Zen observed them for a while, and then retreated to the back of the line and handed his Cloud Flying Wheel to Dorothy.
<br><br>
Other warriors only needed to fly to the Desire World once, while Zen needed to do it twice. His corporeal body also needed the Cloud Flying Wheel.
<br><br>
"Do you need me to pick you up?" Elvinia asked Zen with concern after Dorothy had put the Cloud Flying Wheel away.
<br><br>
Although Zen's corporeal body was much stronger than his Soul of Light, it was quite dangerous for him to go through the narrow path. Elvinia was worried about him.
<br><br>
"No, it's not dangerous for me," Zen said confidently.
<br><br>
Then, he disappeared on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
When Zen was gone, Elvinia and Dorothy exchanged knowing looks.
<br><br>
It was as if they could read each other's minds. Their strained relations surfaced.
<br><br>
"We can't look down on Zen, can we?" Dorothy said.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked a few times. "Are you upset? Because you can't help Zen?"
<br><br>
she asked.
<br><br>
A pink flush crept on Dorothy's cheeks at Elvinia's words. "No, I just don't think Zen is that incompetent," she immediately explained.
<br><br>
"Oh, I see," said Elvinia in an aloof voice. "You are jealous."
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Dorothy didn't know what to say.
<br><br>
"I guessed it right," Elvinia said calmly, and then continued, "I heard that you knew Zen before he came to the Source World. He joined the Oneness Sky Palace with your help."
<br><br>
Of course, there were many factors that caused Zen to join the Oneness Sky Palace, but the most important part was that Dorothy had acted as a gobetween for him in the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
"But there's one thing you need to understand. Zen doesn't belong only to you," said Elvinia.
<br><br>
It was true that Elvinia was a cold woman, but she was always straightforward and honest.
<br><br>
Chapter 3503 Trust Following her sojourn into the Dark Region with Zen, Elvinia's personality changed slightly, but not by much. She just became gentler toward Zen. She was still indifferent to everyone else, especially Dorothy when they were alone.
<br><br>
"I never said Zen belonged to me," Dorothy retorted, feeling even more embarrassed.
<br><br>
"But you were even willing to sacrifice your life for him. Why would you go that far if you don't want him to be yours?" Elvinia spoke.
<br><br>
In the Chaotic Source World, Dorothy had used the Heart of Accomplice regardless of the consequences. Elvinia had been floored by that. She never realized she had such a terrifying Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"I had no choice. The situation called for it," Dorothy pointed out, a little annoyed. Her patience was growing thin.
<br><br>
Elvinia felt smug seeing Dorothy so flustered.
<br><br>
She asked her the next question bluntly. "Do you like him?"
<br><br>
Dorothy was once again rendered speechless. She paused before replying, "That is none of your business."
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, Elvinia leaned forward and hissed in Dorothy's ear. "Of course it's my business. He belongs only to me."
<br><br>
Dorothy was stunned. But being used to Elvinia's straightforward manner, she responded just as frankly, "He already has a family."
<br><br>
"So what?" Elvinia straightened up. She now possessed the body of a purified being created through imagination. It was even more perfect than her previous body in the chaos. It radiated a different charm.
<br><br>
She looked up at the large vortex in the distance. "That is his past. I am talking about the future."
<br><br>
Dorothy frowned at Elvinia's apparent conviction.
<br><br>
She didn't know what Elvinia was thinking. But from what she knew of Zen, he would never just put his past behind him.
<br><br>
"What makes you so sure of that?" Dorothy asked slowly.
<br><br>
Elvinia ignored Dorothy and put on a cold face, as usual.
<br><br>
At the very beginning, Elvinia did hate Zen.
<br><br>
However, after their travel in the Dark Region and having regained her memory, she gradually became interested in him.
<br><br>
In the Phoenix Palace, Elvinia was able to chat with her three "disciples", mostly about Zen's past.
<br><br>
Lavender, who was a woman of few words, had spent the longest time with Zen.
<br><br>
But one thing they had in common was when they were talking about Zen, their faith in him was evident.
<br><br>
This level of trust shone clearly on their faces.
<br><br>
Elvinia's tragic experiences in the Divine Lair made her regard everything around her with hostility and indifference.
<br><br>
Even with Flamine consoling her all these years, her trauma wouldn't heal, and nothing could make her happy.
<br><br>
She wanted what was lacking in her life.
<br><br>
Elvinia suddenly found herself envying how Laquisha and the others looked so happy and trusting when they spoke of Zen.
<br><br>
Once the envy took root, the desire for that kind of happiness grew uncontrollable and became a mad obsession.
<br><br>
When they were at the Chaotic Source World, Elvinia finally felt, too, that Zen was a person she could trust unconditionally. She liked the feeling of being able to trust someone that deeply.
<br><br>
As the women were caught in their discussion, Chaim busied himself with something else.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace took the Cloud Flying Wheels and flew away, one by one.
<br><br>
Not long after, Zen's physical body arrived at the destination, having crossed Stage Thirteen on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Dorothy silently walked up to Zen and handed him another Cloud Flying Wheel. After that, Zen let his physical body dissipate. He returned to the Other Shore with his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
By this time, more than half of the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace had already gone.
<br><br>
Zen held the Cloud Flying Wheel in his hand and walked toward the edge of the stone platform. Dorothy and Elvinia followed behind him in silence.
<br><br>
They intended to go with him.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze fell on Elvinia. "The purified being dominates a certain stage.
<br><br>
After a living creature on the Other Shore becomes a purified being, they can only stay at that stage. I wonder if you can leave."
<br><br>
Creatures on the Other Shore were fixed at the stage they were in after becoming purified beings. Zen had learned this from Athemar.
<br><br>
However, Elvinia was an exception.
<br><br>
She was not a being on the Other Shore, so Zen didn't know whether she would be limited by this rule.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked at this. "I have asked my father. He also wants me to try to see if I can reach Stage Fourteen."
<br><br>
It would be a good thing for the Oneness Sky Palace if Elvinia could dominate only Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
But if she could continue to be promoted and reach other stages, it would be a new record that could make others uneasy.
<br><br>
A purified being who could grow and become more powerful was enough to change the structure of many forces on the Other Shore! "In that case, you can wait here," Zen said.
<br><br>
"Why?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze passed over Elvinia and landed on the place where his physical body disappeared. Elvinia immediately understood.
<br><br>
Although Zen was not a purified being, he could also reach the Other Shore with his physical body. After all, Zen needed to cross twice. Elvinia could wait for Zen and complete the crossing with Zen the second time.
<br><br>
"I'll wait for you, then," Elvinia said, nodding at Zen's explanation.
<br><br>
The other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were somewhat puzzled when they heard this. Zen was obviously here. Why would Elvinia still wait for him? Perhaps only Chaim, Dorothy and a few other warriors understood.
<br><br>
Soon after, Zen and Dorothy activated the Cloud Flying Wheels in their hands.
<br><br>
As a cloud of mist rose, Zen's Soul of Light flew in the air, followed by Dorothy's.
<br><br>
After they flew out for some distance, Zen looked back.
<br><br>
From this vantage, he could clearly see the layout of Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. It was like a huge island, with the Dark Region spreading from its flanks like dark clouds.
<br><br>
Below Stage Thirteen's lower edges, many thin lines extended down.
<br><br>
Zen surmised all these lines must be connected to the Star Doors of Stage Twelve. But from this angle, Zen could not see where it was.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen suddenly thought of the space where King Manard was.
<br><br>
Although King Manard considered the space to be the second Other Shore, it was not that large. It was incomparable to the real Other Shore.
<br><br>
To create the thirty-three stages in the chaos was truly a magnificent feat.
<br><br>
"Zen, be careful," Dorothy reminded him.
<br><br>
Just as Zen turned around to look, a colorful energy ribbon darted toward him. He gently turned over the Cloud Flying Wheel in his hand. As a puff of mist spread around, he easily dodged the ribbon.
<br><br>
It was not difficult to enter the energy vortex. He could enter it as long as he was careful.
<br><br>
All the disciples who ascended earlier had been sucked into the energy vortex successfully, but it was hard to say whether they were able to pass through it.
<br><br>
When Zen and Dorothy got closer to the vortex, a strong gravitational force started to pull them in.
<br><br>
The force was so strong that resistance was futile. The closer they got to the vortex, the greater the gravitational force became.
<br><br>
"Swoosh! Swoosh!"
<br><br>
Both of them were sped along faster and faster in the air until they were sucked into the vortex.
<br><br>
Chapter 3504 Dorothy's Affection There was a long and narrow channel inside the energy vortex, and the colored energy bands coiled around each other like pythons.
<br><br>
The wind beat Zen's and Dorothy's faces as they moved and flew through the channel at an extremely fast speed.
<br><br>
The Cloud Flying Wheels helped them adjust their direction, although it was a bit hard because of their highly swift pace.
<br><br>
At that moment, several energy bands in the distance abruptly rolled up.
<br><br>
They looked like several pythons jumping and curling around.
<br><br>
"Be careful on your right. Follow me," Zen told Dorothy who was behind him.
<br><br>
In turn, Dorothy tilted the Cloud Flying Wheel to the right, and both of them leaned towards the left of the channel.
<br><br>
After both of them had adjusted their positions, they successfully brushed past the energy bands without colliding into them.
<br><br>
"Left!" Zen shouted. The two of them quickly flew to the right.
<br><br>
The mist clouds their Cloud Flying Wheels released formed long white lines in the energy channel.
<br><br>
Since Zen had warned Dorothy in advance, they passed several dangerous spots safe and sound.
<br><br>
Dorothy held on to the Cloud Flying Wheel tightly and quietly followed behind Zen.
<br><br>
Her gaze swept across the brightly colorful energy bands around her as she lost herself in her thoughts.
<br><br>
Ever since Elvinia had arrived in their group, she had never been with Zen alone like this.
<br><br>
As soon as she realized it, she began to reminisce and miss the days she had spent in the Sea of Truth. 'I hope this is a very long channel...' she thought to herself.
<br><br>
Just then, a flurry of ripples showed up over the energy channel. Several thick energy bands came down.
<br><br>
"Down!"
<br><br>
Zen was also shocked when he saw these thick energy bands, but he didn't think it would be a problem for them to use the Cloud Flying Wheels to dodge them.
<br><br>
Just as he adjusted the Cloud Flying Wheel and began to fly downward, he suddenly felt that something was amiss behind him. Dorothy seemed to be absent-minded, as she was flying forward in a blank manner and did not descend like he did.
<br><br>
"Dorothy!" he shouted as he immediately turned the Cloud Flying Wheel around.
<br><br>
His entire body spiraled upwards, and the white mist spun around his body in circles.
<br><br>
As soon he got close enough to Dorothy, he grabbed her with one hand and seized her Cloud Flying Wheel with the other.
<br><br>
Mist sprayed out from the two Cloud Flying Wheels, while Zen and Dorothy fell straight downwards.
<br><br>
They still got to dodge the energy bands above their heads, but because they fell quite fast, they were dashing to the lower wall of the energy vortex at full speed.
<br><br>
Dorothy was scared silly that she huddled in Zen's arms, totally motionless.
<br><br>
When Zen saw that they were approaching the lower wall of the energy vortex even faster, he gritted his teeth and aligned the two Cloud Flying Wheels right downwards.
<br><br>
If they hit the lower wall, they would definitely die.
<br><br>
"Wow..."
<br><br>
More clouds and mists puffed out and acted as a buffer to weaken their downward momentum.
<br><br>
The moment Zen was only half a foot away from the lower wall, they finally stopped falling and began to float gently.
<br><br>
"Wow, that was so close!" Zen exclaimed and sighed in relief.
<br><br>
"How could you space out at such a time!?" he scolded.
<br><br>
Dorothy, however, just stayed limp in his arms.
<br><br>
She didn't explain nor refute him. "What's wrong with you?" Zen asked in confusion.
<br><br>
He could not see the expression on Dorothy's face, but he could feel that her Soul of Light currently gave out a somewhat loose aura.
<br><br>
Logically speaking, there was nothing that could affect souls in the energy channel. Therefore, just passing through it would not cause her Soul of Light any harm.
<br><br>
Now, Zen had planned to return her Cloud Flying Wheel to her and let her continue to follow him.
<br><br>
Yet, Dorothy just curled up in his arms and didn't say a word. Thus, he just had to hold her in one arm and grab the two Cloud Flying Wheels together in the other, and flew forward.
<br><br>
"Dorothy, what happened? Was your Soul of Light hurt? I have soul pills, um... and soul crystal..."
<br><br>
Soon after they had left Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, they arrived at the Desire World.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the pressure on souls was certainly stronger in the Desire World than it was in the Lust World.
<br><br>
Naturally, Zen also faintly felt such pressure—but since Dorothy had entered Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore together with him, he believed that she could withstand the pressure as well.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Dorothy just looked at Zen's blurry face. 'What a fool!' she thought.
<br><br>
She did hear him ask a series of questions, but she didn't answer any of them. When Zen finally didn't know what to say next, he moved forward in silence.
<br><br>
After a while, Dorothy suddenly said in a low voice, "If only this space channel has no end!"
<br><br>
"You must be joking, Dorothy," Zen said with a smile. "Even if the space channel does have no end, the energy in the Cloud Flying Wheels will be used up sooner or later.
<br><br>
By then, we will be transformed into..."
<br><br>
Suddenly, he stopped talking.
<br><br>
Even though Zen lacked a sense of romance, he soon realized that he and Dorothy didn't seem to be talking about the same thing.
<br><br>
Once Zen stopped speaking, Dorothy quickly tightened her arms that were around his neck and lowered her head onto his chest. Her lips stretched into a shy smile.
<br><br>
Clearly, her character was totally different from Elvinia's.
<br><br>
Everyone in the Oneness Sky Palace knew that Dorothy was warm and outgoing, but when actually faced with a man she liked, she was very shy and could not express her love explicitly.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Elvinia looked haughty and cold. She seemed to keep away from everyone else, but she was straightforward and honest when she fell in love with someone.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen's body was a little stiff.
<br><br>
He had spent most of his time with Dorothy since he had entered the Other Shore, and the two of them had also experienced several life and death crises together.
<br><br>
Still, he never expected that this little girl from the Origin Mountain would have a crush on him.
<br><br>
His heart felt warm at the thought of Dorothy using the Heart of Accomplice without the least hesitation in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
"But I..."
<br><br>
As soon as he began to speak, Dorothy stretched out her hand to cover his mouth. At the same time, she said, "I don't care about any 'but'..."
<br><br>
She never had a relationship with any man yet, and just like Elvinia had said, she wasn't brave enough to confess her feelings.
<br><br>
When Elvinia goaded her, however, she began to worry about losing Zen, and then couldn't hold back her affections any longer.
<br><br>
Although she was a beloved one in the Origin Mountain, she was very young, and her mentality was not very different from that of any other young girl.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he didn't know how to respond to her words.
<br><br>
Just then, dozens of energy bands rolled up like mad in the channel ahead of them. Energy flowed wildly and vented towards the channel in a deranged fashion.
<br><br>
It turned out that they had reached the most dangerous part of the vortex.
<br><br>
"Hold me tight!"
<br><br>
Of course, Zen couldn't afford to be distracted. As the two Cloud Flying Wheels turned slightly, he shuttled in multiple directions among the energy bands, like a swallow that flew in a thunderstorm.
<br><br>
Fortunately, it was not a long journey. After no more than half a minute, they had successfully passed through, and there was no more dangerous part ahead.
<br><br>
They flew in the peaceful vortex for about five minutes, then they finally saw the exit in front of them.
<br><br>
When Zen was about to get close to it, he suddenly felt a strong force thrust upon him. Unlike what had happened when he had entered the energy vortex, this thrust directly pushed him and Dorothy out.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a purple light curtain flashed everywhere in the sky outside.
<br><br>
The purple light curtain caused a trace of dreamy colors to wash over Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chapter 3505 The Change In The Vortex The thirty-three stages on the Other Shore were distributed such that there were thirteen stages in the Lust World and nineteen stages in the Desire World.
<br><br>
The Desire World gathered together the backbone power of the entire Source World.
<br><br>
Most people who could enter this world were at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
But they could enter Stage Fourteen even if they hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm. Only precursor was that their Souls of Light had turned into Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
But from Stage Fourteen onward, the Other Shore Power of the Other Shore Tokens measured at least one thousand divine megatons. Creatures that hadn't merged with the Chaotic Source Spirits wouldn't be able to unleash their full power.
<br><br>
One solution to this problem would be to fuse with an Other Shore Token of the descending type.
<br><br>
But there was a huge gap between the physical strength of the Chaotic Source Realm warriors and that of those who were not at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Beneath the energy vortex was a stone platform similar to the one located at Stage Thirteen in the Lust World. A few Souls of Light waited on this platform.
<br><br>
These Souls of Light belonged to the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Most of them were from the group that had ascended before Zen. But there were several Souls of Light that were imposing and serious. These belonged to the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
As Zen circled in the air alongside Dorothy, he felt an invisible pressure bearing down on them from the curtain of purple light floating in the sky.
<br><br>
But because Zen's and Dorothy's Souls of Light had long since become Indigo Souls, they could bear the pressure.
<br><br>
He held Dorothy in his arms as he descended slowly. He stepped carefully onto the stone platform before gently putting her down.
<br><br>
Dorothy blushed scarlet under the gaze of the crowd and retreated quickly to the side. Lucky for her, everyone was on the Other Shore and couldn't see her flaming face. But the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had seen what had happened and were stunned.
<br><br>
Passing through the energy vortex was dangerous. What the hell was this couple doing? A Soul of Light with a strong aura walked towards them and said, "Please tell us your names and show us your soul marks."
<br><br>
These senior disciples didn't know what was going on in the Lust World and were using the soul marks to verify their identities.
<br><br>
"Dorothy, from the Origin Mountain," Dorothy said, keeping her voice low as she showed him her soul mark.
<br><br>
"Zen, from the Flow Sword Sect," Zen said.
<br><br>
The senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief looked at him in unison when they heard his name. Many of them looked amused.
<br><br>
Before Dorothy had entered the Land of Sword Grief, they had already heard about her. After all, she was the apple of Yasamin's eye, and she and Elvinia were considered to be the top two women warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Zen had become famous because of the battle he had fought after he had entered the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
His ranking on the Ranking Stone had surpassed that of the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
"Gee, Madam Yasamin's granddaughter and Zen!"
<br><br>
"They make a perfect match. This boy was not born in a great clan but he has incredible talent and will make many, many achievements in the future."
<br><br>
"Archibald will be shocked to see this! I'll tell him after I get out of the Other Shore. I wonder how he will react outwardly, though!"
<br><br>
They communicated with each other through their life vitality.
<br><br>
There were only a few female members in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
Dorothy's and Elvinia's beauty attracted the attention of many senior disciples after they entered the Land of Sword Grief. Some admired them secretly, and some tried to ingratiate themselves with them.
<br><br>
Elvinia looked aloof, causing these warriors to feel so intimidated that they didn't dare try to get close to her.
<br><br>
Dorothy dealt with them cleverly. She received more attention than Elvinia.
<br><br>
Many people became jealous as they watched Zen hold Dorothy on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After Zen and Dorothy verified their identities by showing their soul marks and speaking their names, they silently stepped aside. Moments later, Zen said, "I'll leave the Other Shore now. You stay here and wait for me to come back."
<br><br>
His physical body was still in the Lust World. It was now his physical body's turn to come here.
<br><br>
"Okay! Be careful!" Dorothy whispered shyly.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Soon, Zen's Soul of Light had disappeared from the stone platform.
<br><br>
The others were waiting. When they found that Zen had dissipated his Soul of Light, they were confused, but didn't think much of it.
<br><br>
The next moment, Zen's physical body had reappeared on the stone platform of Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
Chaim was pleased to see Zen return. It looked like Zen's and Dorothy's Souls of Light had safely reached their destination.
<br><br>
But Zen didn't tell Chaim anything about his other name, 'Thad'. Chaim wouldn't reveal his secret or ask Zen about that.
<br><br>
Elvinia asked Zen worriedly, "Do you think my physical body will pass through that?"
<br><br>
"You can't stay in Stage Thirteen just for this physical body," Zen tried to comfort her. "Don't worry. The worst that could happen is that you'll have to abandon the purified being's body. Your Soul of Light will always be powerful."
<br><br>
"Okay. Zen, you have to protect me!" Elvinia said, a lovely but rare smile on her lips.
<br><br>
Elvinia was not an easy-going person. Zen had actually liked the version of Elvinia who had lost her memory.
<br><br>
But now, she was behaving like she used to be when she had lost her memory in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
At her expression, Zen's heart skipped a beat. But he was still confused.
<br><br>
Both Dorothy and Elvinia were behaving unusually today.
<br><br>
After many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, including Sally, had ascended to the next stage, only Zen, Chaim, and Elvinia were left on the stone platform.
<br><br>
"I'll go first, guys," Chaim said. He then pulled out the Cloud Flying Wheel and flew towards the energy vortex in the distance.
<br><br>
After Chaim had disappeared in the vortex, Zen said, "It's our turn. I'll lead the way since I have just passed through this vortex. You can follow me."
<br><br>
He then activated the Cloud Flying Wheel once again and shot off into the distance, Elvinia following close behind.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The two of them rose high into the air and flew towards the energy vortex.
<br><br>
The energy bands didn't react when Zen first approached the energy vortex.
<br><br>
But when Elvinia approached it, the bands seemed to instantly become frenzied and restless.
<br><br>
Elvinia frowned as she manipulated the Cloud Flying Wheel to pause in mid-air.
<br><br>
The energy bands were restless, but they didn't roll upwards. Zen observed them for a few seconds before saying, "It's alright! Let's speed up!"
<br><br>
Elvinia pursed her lips at this.
<br><br>
She told herself that she should believe Zen, and she let the doubt go.
<br><br>
They waited for a while outside and then suddenly sped up, rushing into the energy vortex.
<br><br>
But the moment they entered it, a weird change took place in the energy vortex. The energy bands in the outer layer rolled back in unison, tightly sealing their way to retreat.
<br><br>
Chapter 3506 Form A Path It was clear that Elvinia was causing the turmoil of the energy vortex.
<br><br>
The entrance was filled with energy—it was impossible to head back.
<br><br>
Inside the channel, the energy became manic. The colorful energy bands rose rapidly, filling every corner of the channel.
<br><br>
Neither Zen nor Elvinia said a single word to each other before flying forward.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The channel within the energy vortex only grew more and more manic as Elvinia continued further. The tumultuous energy bands flew around, forming a dense net with Elvinia and Zen as its targets.
<br><br>
By now, Elvinia felt the panic set in. "What should we do? Can we get out of the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
While the Cloud Flying Wheels could help them fly in the air, their pushing force was lackluster. Even with a corporeal body that was more flexible than a Soul of Light, neither of them could gain any momentum or speed.
<br><br>
And because corporeal bodies were far heavier than Souls of Light, they looked rather clumsy as they navigated in the air.
<br><br>
So how could they break through the net formed by the energy bands? The net before them was moving closer as the channel behind them continued narrowing.
<br><br>
At this rate, a maximum of 20 seconds was enough for the vortex to completely eat them up. How could they escape merging with the vortex? "Don't be afraid," Zen suddenly said.
<br><br>
He held up the Cloud Flying Wheel in the opposite direction to retreat to Elvinia's side and grabbed her arm.
<br><br>
The act only stunned her—she had no clue what Zen was planning to do to break the siege under the circumstances.
<br><br>
Just then, she witnessed a flash of lightning on Zen's back—following the sound of a thunderbolt, a pair of great thunder wings suddenly grew from his back.
<br><br>
"Thunder Materialization!"
<br><br>
Although he couldn't use the Shade Stone liquid on the Other Shore, the Godly Way's internal momentum was still available. He could still draw some internal momentum out of his inner world. Back in the Dark Region, he managed to use the Life Godly Way to treat the three-eyed boy, after all.
<br><br>
In the divine land, Zen quite often used the pair of thunder wings. But because the internal momentum was far weaker than the Other Shore Power in the Source World, Zen rarely pulled them out.
<br><br>
But in the most critical moments, the internal momentum could still save him.
<br><br>
Crack! A bright light flashed upon both his wings as he dragged Elvinia through the net like a bolt of lightning.
<br><br>
Seeing that she was fine, Elvinia went blank before soon understanding what had happened.
<br><br>
Although both of them were corporeal bodies, they differed in nature.
<br><br>
Elvinia obtained a powerful purified being's body when she entered the Other Shore with her Soul of Light, and Zen entered the Other Shore with his own corporeal body.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh… As soon as they passed through the energy net, the energy bands before them began intertwining into another net.
<br><br>
Then, Zen held Elvinia horizontally—his thunder wings crackled before once again shooting forward like lightning.
<br><br>
Crack! Clap! They broke through a net every time he bolted.
<br><br>
While the entire channel grew manic and the energy bands swept around, Zen's speed had increased rapidly. He seemed to be passing through the nets before they could even form.
<br><br>
Elvinia lay in Zen's arms peacefully, staring up at him with bright eyes.
<br><br>
Once Teague's soul was driven away, Elvinia recovered all the memories about the Dark Region. But she was quite an ignorant child in her memories —she couldn't escape the embarrassment as she browsed through the memories.
<br><br>
From these memories, she found a unique sense of peace and trust—it should have been the same as what Lavender, Nelly and Laquisha had felt.
<br><br>
Zen seemed to have a knack for finding unexpected ways to slip out of desperate circumstances—this was, perhaps, why Elvinia felt so assured.
<br><br>
At Zen's speed, he managed to cover a great distance in mere seconds. In around 20 seconds, they could rush out of the channel.
<br><br>
Although the plan was going smoothly, Zen couldn't help but feel a little worried.
<br><br>
Last time, When Zen passed the second half of the channel with Dorothy, there was a section full of restless energy.
<br><br>
But in the first half of the channel, Elvinia had caused a huge turmoil in the energy vortex, which meant the second half would possibly be even more troublesome.
<br><br>
Just as he was thinking, Elvinia suddenly called out, "Zen, look!"
<br><br>
His lips curled into a bitter smile when he clearly saw what was ahead of them.
<br><br>
Before he figured out how to cross it, the road ahead had been completely blocked by the energy bands.
<br><br>
With the channel behind them still narrowing, and the front exit getting sealed off by the energy bands, there was no way out at all.
<br><br>
"It looks like all I can do now is abandon this body," Elvinia said reluctantly.
<br><br>
It was everyone's dream to obtain such a powerful body on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But they had no other way to go—if she didn't give up the body, she and Zen would die there.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! The energy bands piled up until they were sandwiched in.
<br><br>
Crack...
<br><br>
Zen tried changing a few positions, but the space for him to dodge was lessening.
<br><br>
"Zen, don't hold on," Elvinia said firmly.
<br><br>
Ready to leave her body, she shut her eyes.
<br><br>
"Wait!" Zen called out as the lightning in his hand flashed, shifting into a spiral-shaped thunder halberd. Aiming at the channel's inner wall, he shot it.
<br><br>
Just as he expected, these energy bands were of very high grade.
<br><br>
Once the thunder and lightning the Thunderstorm Godly Way generated entered the area, they were constantly melted down by the energy bands, making it impossible to break through them.
<br><br>
The wall of energy bands formed a vortex. Several energy bands shot right at Zen.
<br><br>
He dodged them quite easily, but a thoughtful look appeared on his face.
<br><br>
Seeing the energy bands coming at her from both sides, Elvinia grew even more anxious. "Zen, what are you waiting for? If it goes on like this…"
<br><br>
In the middle of her thought, a lightning bolt flashed from Zen's fingertip, aiming at a spot on the wall.
<br><br>
Crack, crack...
<br><br>
Every time he attacked the wall, several energy bands would roll out.
<br><br>
Instead of returning to their original spots, they mixed in with other bands.
<br><br>
One by one, the bands rolled out from the wall until they left a great hole.
<br><br>
"You..." The sight had Elvinia too dumbfounded for words.
<br><br>
Never did she expect Zen to form a path by taking advantage of the energy bands' natural properties.
<br><br>
"There isn't only one way out." Zen was perfectly calm.
<br><br>
More thunder and lightning bolts were released from his body, shooting through the hole. Skillfully dodging the bands, he brought Elvinia to the hole.
<br><br>
The moment they entered the hole, the energy bands gathered in from the front and back, filling the entire channel.
<br><br>
Chapter 3507 Iron Plate The changes within the energy channel also manifested externally.
<br><br>
Chaim was the last to leave the vortex and enter Stage Fourteen, just before Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Upon exiting, he found that the previously stable energy vortex began to fluctuate with the energy bands constantly rolling around abnormally and blocking the exit.
<br><br>
Chaim couldn't help but gasp in astonishment. "This is..."
<br><br>
After Elvinia became a purified being, Chaim learned a few bits of important information.
<br><br>
From what he was able to gather, a purified being was the ruler of a stage, thus, in theory, they shouldn't be able to leave that certain stage.
<br><br>
If that was the case, then wouldn't that mean Elvinia had to stay behind and would be unable to reach the Desire World? She was bound to encounter some problems at least.
<br><br>
Looking at the energy channel, Chaim realized that the problem had just materialized itself. If the energy vortex was sealed then that meant Zen and Elvinia wouldn't be able to pass through it at all.
<br><br>
"What happened?!" "The passageway! It's closed!"
<br><br>
"Everyone from the Oneness Sky Palace got through, right?"
<br><br>
"I think so! That was really close. It's a good thing we were able to get through before it did that!"
<br><br>
None of the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace thought that the purified being had anything to do with it. To them, the vortex was simply strangely malfunctioning.
<br><br>
"Wait. I think someone is missing!" someone remarked.
<br><br>
"You're right! Where's Princess Elvinia? Was she unable to pass through? She is different from us anyway."
<br><br>
"Is it because she has a corporeal body on the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
The disciples began to whisper amongst themselves at this current development.
<br><br>
Dorothy's heart was erratic as she analyzed the situation.
<br><br>
"Elvinia, Zen..."
<br><br>
In an instant, she immediately dissipated her Soul of Light.
<br><br>
The next time she opened her eyes, she was back in her cultivation room, worried sick about what was currently brewing.
<br><br>
She didn't really care about Elvinia's safety, but Zen...he was an entirely different matter.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
Dorothy opened the door and headed straight to the No. 1 cultivation room in the far right where Zen was in.
<br><br>
Several senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief rushed over when they saw her in such a hurry. All of them sported flattering smiles on their faces.
<br><br>
"Princess Dorothy, what made you so anxious all of a sudden?"
<br><br>
Dorothy could only look at Zen's room in worry. "Can that door be opened?" she asked.
<br><br>
Her deepest fear would be if she opened that door and found only Zen's mangled corpse waiting for her.
<br><br>
The senior disciples who greeted her could only look at each other.
<br><br>
"This... it's a private place. It's not really advisable to disturb the cultivator inside. If the warrior inside is unwilling to open it, then the people outside should..."
<br><br>
However, Dorothy was in no mood to listen to their nonsense. "Can the door be opened?" she repeated with urgency. "Can it be broken or something?!"
<br><br>
Her suggestion was immediately met with obvious hesitation. "Break it? Well, it could work but..."
<br><br>
There was nobody that dared provoke Zen, not when he gained a bit of a reputation ever since coming to the Land of Sword Grief. Opening his cultivation room wasn't a wise thing.
<br><br>
"I'll bear the consequences, whatever they may be," Dorothy declared confidently.
<br><br>
The man smiled. "Alright then."
<br><br>
Since Dorothy already expressed her willingness to take accountability, he would willingly break the door down for her. Reaching out his hand, the man gathered the Other Shore Power in his palm.
<br><br>
With the force of over a thousand divine megatons, he pushed at the door and broke through! Whoosh! Dorothy wasted no time and rushed inside. "Stay outside!" she ordered the senior disciples clustered behind her.
<br><br>
All of them were curious but could guess why Dorothy had been so anxious and demanding.
<br><br>
"Do you think Zen died on the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"It's possible. They are supposed to leave the Lust World and enter the Desire World today."
<br><br>
"Died? How is that possible? He's so powerful. I can't imagine him not reaching the Desire World, given his skills."
<br><br>
Although the energy vortex could be dangerous, most warriors got through it with no problems.
<br><br>
Inside the cultivation room, Dorothy found Zen sitting cross-legged on the floor, with faint golden light glowing on the surface of his body. She gently pressed on the spot between his brows and breathed a sigh of relief when she sensed the fluctuation of his soul aura.
<br><br>
Within the vortex, Zen and Elvinia were moving in a very strange way.
<br><br>
He had gradually figured out the rules of the energy bands.
<br><br>
These energy bands composed the entirety of the vortex. However, Zen found that they could be divided into two layers. On the outer layer, the energy bands were in a dissociative state and were easily disturbed, sweeping up and attacking those that passed by.
<br><br>
The energy bands in the inner layer were more stable and formed the walls within the passage.
<br><br>
When Elvinia had approached the outer energy bands, it led to her getting attacked crazily.
<br><br>
This was the consequence of breaking the rules of being a purified being.
<br><br>
The inner energy bands, since they were more stable, did not harm Elvinia in any way. It was only when Zen hit them with the internal momentum of the Godly Way did they launch a counterattack.
<br><br>
Zen felt a bit more relaxed after learning all this.
<br><br>
He specially launched attacks towards the energy bands in a certain direction and waited for their reaction. Once they rolled up, the big hole continued to move forward.
<br><br>
A strange feeling came over Elvinia as she watched the energy bands that were tens of feet away around her.
<br><br>
In such a dangerous circumstance, it was hard to believe that the two of them not only survived, but were able to move forward bit by bit.
<br><br>
She couldn't help but sigh in relief.
<br><br>
"Can we dig into the Desire World by continuously doing this?" she whispered to Zen.
<br><br>
While focusing on releasing lightning, Zen said, "The direction should be right but it's hard to say. Duck!"
<br><br>
Zen warned just as an energy band flew right past his right arm.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Elvinia heard his warning just in time and lowered her head.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
A wound appeared on Zen's right arm. At the same time, all the light dots formed by the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body were extinguished, falling into a state of fatigue.
<br><br>
He couldn't bring the Shade Stone liquid with him to the Other Shore, but the Chaotic Source Spirits were different.
<br><br>
Since Zen's body had entered the Other Shore, the Chaotic Source Spirits, which were from there in the first place, could naturally work.
<br><br>
"The energy is so powerful..." he muttered in shock.
<br><br>
He initially thought he could count on the Chaotic Source Spirits to resist an energy band. But it seemed they couldn't even bear the force when an energy band merely brushed past him.
<br><br>
Zen found himself becoming more cautious as they moved forward.
<br><br>
He tried to lure only one energy band into attacking them at a time which slowed down their speed significantly. He pulled out the energy bands one by one as if painstakingly reeling threads from a silk cocoon.
<br><br>
Two hours later, Zen pulled out an energy band and found an iron plate in front of them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3508 The Iron House Both of them were baffled by the sight of this iron plate.
<br><br>
"What is this?" Elvinia asked, blinking.
<br><br>
Zen squinted at it. "Let's take a closer look."
<br><br>
The thunder wings on his back flapped as the two of them approached the iron plate. Zen reached out to touch it, his fingers grazing the cold surface.
<br><br>
Elvinia touched it curiously. "What is this made of? It isn't eroded by all this energy at all."
<br><br>
After a moment's thought, Zen drew out a great amount of force from his inner world and directed it at the plate.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The impact caused a loud sound, but the solid iron plate did not move at all.
<br><br>
Zen frowned slightly.
<br><br>
Whatever material this plate was made of, it seemed impossible for them to move it. They needed to get through this energy vortex, but this plate was proving to be an obstacle.
<br><br>
"Let's try going above it." Zen raised his head, fixing his gaze upwards.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Another lightning bolt flashed toward the space above them. Zen pulled down another energy band.
<br><br>
The two of them moved upwards little by little along the iron plate. After more than two hundred feet up, they had yet to see where it ended. This plate apparently went much higher than Zen had imagined.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked. "Let's move to the left!"
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
They continued moving, but now to the left side. This time, they reached the end after a short distance of less than thirty feet. The iron plate bent at a sharp right angle in this area.
<br><br>
When Zen saw this, his eyes lit up. "It's not an iron plate! This looks like a..."
<br><br>
"A house?" There was a confused look in Elvinia's eyes.
<br><br>
They obviously had the same thought in mind.
<br><br>
Who would have thought that there would be an iron house in this energy vortex? Driven by curiosity, Zen moved forward, following the newly discovered side. The wall was still made of the same iron material along the way, but after more than a hundred feet, he finally saw a small door.
<br><br>
The door was only two feet wide, about the same size as a fox hole. There were extremely complicated Sanskrit words engraved on it.
<br><br>
It was almost impossible to open the door by brute force. The iron material was quite strong.
<br><br>
As Zen gently pressed on the Sanskrit words, one of the words lit up.
<br><br>
Intrigued, Elvinia followed suit. Every time she pressed, one word would light up. After a few more presses, all of the Sanskrit words had been lit up.
<br><br>
However, the illumination soon faded away.
<br><br>
"It seems the words should be pressed in a certain order to open the door,"
<br><br>
Elvinia mused out loud. "Unfortunately, it would be difficult to guess what that order could be."
<br><br>
"If we know the meaning of the Sanskrit words, we may be able to solve it,"
<br><br>
Zen said.
<br><br>
Elvinia raised a brow. She did remember that Zen seemed to have some expertise in deciphering Sanskrit words, since he was able to interpret the Truth Enlightenment correctly before.
<br><br>
However, what Elvinia did not know was that it was not Zen who deciphered the Sanskrit words, but Geoffrey in his inner world.
<br><br>
All this time, the Regal Jade Spirit had been hiding in Zen's inner world, completely clueless of what was happening outside, which was why when Zen summoned the spirit, he was shocked to see where they were. "Zen, where are you now?"
<br><br>
"I am on the way to Stage Fourteen," Zen said.
<br><br>
At these words, the Regal Jade Spirit fell silent for a moment.
<br><br>
The entire Regal Jade Civilization had withdrawn from the Desire World.
<br><br>
He definitely knew about this vortex.
<br><br>
"What is it with this iron house? How can it not erode in the energy vortex?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked, staring agog at the iron gate.
<br><br>
"I don't know, but I want to take a look inside. Please ask Geoffrey to decipher the Sanskrit words," Zen replied.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit's curiosity was also piqued now, so he was only too glad to cooperate.
<br><br>
Zen waited for about five minutes before the Regal Jade Spirit relayed Geoffrey's response. "Your son said that you have to press the third word on the left, then the sixth on the right, and then the last one..."
<br><br>
As the spirit spoke, Zen pressed the Sanskrit words on the door one by one.
<br><br>
When he pressed a word, it lit up, giving off a bright light.
<br><br>
After Zen pressed twelve of the words as directed, a circle of Sanskrit words began to emit green light.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
As the green light flashed on the door, a loud click also sounded. The door had opened! "It worked!"
<br><br>
A grin spread on Elvinia's face.
<br><br>
"Go on! Get in!" the Regal Jade Spirit urged.
<br><br>
Zen opened the small door, supported Elvinia's body, and pushed her inside slowly. Then he went in after her.
<br><br>
The door was not big. It was obviously not designed for a human being.
<br><br>
After squeezing his way through the door, Zen raised his head and looked around. The interior wasn't small. Both he and Elvinia were able to stand upright once inside.
<br><br>
The two looked around the house, eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
The space inside was divided into two parts: one light, and one dark. The area near the door was illuminated and was empty, while the other area was pitch black. No one could see what was in the darkness.
<br><br>
"Is that half of the space already in the Dark Region?" Zen said, staring at the darkness ahead.
<br><br>
"I think so," Elvinia said, nodding. As a purified being, she was very sensitive to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
As they got closer to the darkness, a shrill scream rang out.
<br><br>
The voice sounded extremely forlorn. When it reached their ears, it felt like countless needles had been stuck in their souls.
<br><br>
Struggling through the pain, anger crossing her features, Elvinia raised her right hand and snapped, "Great Sanskrit Light!"
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
A white light so bright one couldn't stare at it directly shot toward the dark.
<br><br>
As it did, Zen clearly saw a row of iron cages hanging along the walls in the dark. The cages contained strange types of monsters.
<br><br>
The iron cage right in front of them contained a monster with a head like an owl's and a body like a leopard's, covered with dozens of thorny tentacles.
<br><br>
As it screamed, it was enveloped in the Great Sanskrit Light. Under the glare of the snow-white light, its body quickly began to melt. First its fur, then its flesh, its blood, and finally its bones.
<br><br>
Elvinia showed no mercy and didn't stop the Great Sanskrit Light until the monster was completely melted.
<br><br>
Her chest heaved up and down. It took her a while to calm down.
<br><br>
Obviously, she had been frightened.
<br><br>
"What the hell is this iron house?" Zen looked at the darkness and frowned slightly.
<br><br>
"No matter what this is, we should probably kill all the monsters in the cages," Elvinia said coldly.
<br><br>
She raised a finger. The bright light gathered around her hand once again.
<br><br>
Chapter 3509 Guard Elvinia didn't want to see these abominable monsters at all.
<br><br>
There were more than one iron cage on the wall. As the ball of light on her fingertips exploded, another blazing white light shot forward and illuminated another iron cage.
<br><br>
A snake-like creature was locked in the second cage. It had a terrifyingly strange face on its head.
<br><br>
When the light shone on the cage, the snake screamed and ran around frantically in the cage. It made strange noises that sounded like sizzling screams. Then at last, it was completely annihilated under the inescapable blinding light.
<br><br>
Seeing how the two creatures ended, the monsters in the other cages suddenly jumped up and down in the cages.
<br><br>
They had been locked here in the cages for quite a long time. But even if that was the case, it was better to be a living dog than a dead lion. In the end, they didn't want to be completely destroyed by the light.
<br><br>
For a moment, all kinds of weird and horrifying shrieks could be heard from the iron cages.
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't show any signs of mercy at all. With a flash of light in her hand, she was about to eliminate the monsters in the iron cages one by one.
<br><br>
At this time, Zen quickly reached out his hand and stopped her.
<br><br>
"Listen to me, don't kill them now," Zen said.
<br><br>
"But they..." Elvinia frowned in confusion.
<br><br>
"Only the first monster had attacked us. These other monsters are not attacking us, and they are locked in cages," Zen said seriously.
<br><br>
These monsters weren't hostile to them at all. Moreover, if they wanted to really know more about this iron house, then they would probably need to start with these monsters.
<br><br>
Under Zen's persuasion, Elvinia decided to stop what she was about to do.
<br><br>
With her personality, she would never show mercy or listen to others.
<br><br>
However, Zen's words really persuaded her. She then showed a sweet and understanding smile and asked, "Then what should we do next?"
<br><br>
"Let's go inside first and have a look," Zen said.
<br><br>
She didn't know if these monsters were intelligent or not, but she thought it would be best if they could somehow communicate with her.
<br><br>
She released two rays of light to cover the both of them, then they stepped into the darkness.
<br><br>
Because of the Dark Region's characteristics, even if he was very near something, he still could not see it. So, Zen couldn't see the situation of the cage that he was approaching.
<br><br>
After thinking about their situation for a while, Zen suddenly said, "Take out the Darkness Fruits."
<br><br>
Zen's physical body was unable to carry the Sumeru Space. So the last time he left the Dark Region, he had asked Elvinia to keep the candles and the Darkness Fruits.
<br><br>
Elvinia took out two Darkness Fruits and each of them swallowed one.
<br><br>
Then, the darkness in front of them slowly faded away. Although their surroundings were still filled with darkness, Zen was able to clearly see in the dark without the help of Elvinia's light.
<br><br>
The iron cage in front of Zen had a palm sized lizard locked inside. It curled up at the farthest side of the cage, trembling with fear.
<br><br>
Zen tried to communicate with the lizard, but the little creature was obviously clueless. It didn't respond to Zen at all.
<br><br>
He gave up on the lizard and walked to the next cage.
<br><br>
The monster in the next cage was even stranger. It just looked like a plain purple cube. Its body seemed sticky and it stayed motionless at the center of the cage.
<br><br>
When Zen approached, the "cube" suddenly trembled. Then, two big round eyes popped at the center of the cube and stared at him curiously.
<br><br>
When he saw this, Zen asked, "You... Can you speak at all?"
<br><br>
Zen did not expect this "cube" to speak like humans, but he hoped that it could give at least a meaningful response.
<br><br>
But at the next moment, the reaction made by the cube exceeded Zen's expectations.
<br><br>
The sticky cube suddenly dissolved and gradually turned into a pool of mucus. The pool of mucus was constantly rising and it seemed like it was forming itself into a figure. Finally, it turned into a human shape, complete with a nose, two eyes, a mouth, and a body...
<br><br>
Soon, a person who looked exactly like Zen appeared in the cage.
<br><br>
"What? This thing, it can turn into human shape..." Elvinia stared at the Zen in the cage with a strange and curious look.
<br><br>
"Kof, kof, kof..."
<br><br>
Suddenly, the thing in the cage coughed a few times and took a few short breaths. After adapting to its new form, it finally opened its mouth and said, "I, I can turn into any creature..."
<br><br>
When he heard this, Zen raised his eyebrows suddenly and asked, "You know human language?"
<br><br>
"Of course." After the thing adapted to its new body, it spoke more fluently and naturally. It sounded like it was nothing different from an ordinary human being. "This is the talent of Shape-shifting Spirits. We can imitate the language of countless races, including the human race."
<br><br>
"Well, I think it's a great thing that we can communicate. Do tell us, what is this place?" Elvinia asked, as she stared into the iron cage. Her fingertips began to flash white light again. Her face looked intimidating.
<br><br>
The "Zen" in the cage seemed to be instinctively afraid of the Great Sanskrit Light. It subconsciously took a step back away from the light. With a terrified look, it said, "I'm just a pet. Please don't kill me!"
<br><br>
Zen stopped Elvinia again, shaking his head. Then he said, "We came here by accident. Could you tell us where we are?"
<br><br>
The "Zen" in the cage breathed a sigh of relief and replied, "You'd better leave now. This is the Bleak Center, and my master might come back at any moment. Although I don't know how you got here in the first place, I am sure that you will die if my master finds out!"
<br><br>
"Bleak Center?" Zen's eyes narrowed slightly when he learned this new information. "How long has it been since your master left?"
<br><br>
"It's been more than ten thousand years," said the "Zen" in the cage seriously.
<br><br>
Over ten thousand years was only a short period of time for the Other Shore creatures that were easily able to live through several chaotic eras.
<br><br>
However, the master of this place hadn't returned for ten thousand years.
<br><br>
How could he possibly return now, at this exact moment? When he heard this, Zen quickly relaxed. He continued to ask, "What kind of place is this Bleak Center? What is it used for? And who is your master?"
<br><br>
The "Zen" in the cage looked a little hesitant. It seemed to be very cowardly, especially after it saw the Dark Region creatures in the previous cages die under the blinding light. It was frightened by the two humans in front of it, especially by Elvinia who stood next to Zen.
<br><br>
"Tell us at once!" Elvinia commanded fiercely and directly.
<br><br>
The other "Zen" glanced at the light that was shining in Elvinia's hand and said, "The Bleak Center is the place to build the passageway to the Desire World. My master is only a guard and he has been guarding here for many years. But in the last tens of thousands of years, he often went out and left us. This is all I know."
<br><br>
The monsters in the cages were nothing more than pets that gave the master company and pleasure while he was guarding this place. Naturally, they didn't know too much.
<br><br>
However, Zen still got a piece of important information from its words. The passage to the Desire World was not formed naturally, but it was built by this iron house! In theory, it was the Instant Civilization that had created the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Every stage and every passageway, including the energy vortex and the Star Doors, should be created by the Instant Civilization. Zen wondered if the master of the iron house was one of the members of the Instant Civilization.
<br><br>
Chapter 3510 Clues As Zen thought things over, Elvinia directly asked the Shape-shifting Spirit, "Don't you have the ability of shape shifting? Why don't you transform into your master so we can have a look what your master looks like?"
<br><br>
"Yes, that sounds like a good idea." Zen patted his head. The monster before them called itself Shape-shifting Spirit, so turning into the form of its master should be no problem for it.
<br><br>
The "Zen" in the cage hesitated. It seemed to be terrified of its master.
<br><br>
"Well, come on! Change!" Elvinia ordered, the impatience clear in her voice.
<br><br>
Although the iron house slightly piqued her interest, Elvinia didn't want to waste her time exploring it like what Zen and the Regal Jade Spirit wanted to do. In fact, Zen was the only reason she had enough patience to stay.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The ball of light Elvinia held in her palm began to twitch. What appeared as a harmless light source to Zen and Elvinia ended up being extremely dangerous to the Shape-shifting Spirit.
<br><br>
"I… Alright, I'll do it!"
<br><br>
The Shape-shifting Spirit finally compromised. Right then and there, its body, which was in Zen's form began to soften and become pliable and sticky to the touch like clay before changing into a round sphere.
<br><br>
It was translucent, and there were gently flickering flames burning within it.
<br><br>
It possessed no eyes, ears, mouth, or nose.
<br><br>
"This is what your master is like?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Yes. This is what he looks like," the Shape-shifting Spirit replied.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia had a hard time confirming this since they had never seen its master before. But then, the Regal Jade Spirit that had been watching them secretly finally said in a serious tone, "This… is a member of the Element Spirit Civilization. "
<br><br>
"Element Spirit Civilization?" Zen was stunned.
<br><br>
He had heard about this particular civilization before through the Regal Jade Spirit. The Instant Civilization was the first civilization to ever exist. It was also the civilization that had initiated all the civilizations in the entire chaos.
<br><br>
For a long time, everyone doubted its existence because there was little to no proof of it. Therefore, everyone acknowledged the second civilization— the Element Spirit Civilization—as the first one instead. What was more, the last flaw of the Ways-blending Energy should also be in their hands.
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit Civilization has five big branches, which are metal spirits, wood spirits, water spirits, fire spirits and earth spirits," the Regal Jade Spirit enlightened. "What the Shape-shifting Spirit is showing us is a fire spirit, hence the flames encased within it," the Regal Jade Spirit continued.
<br><br>
Even during the peak of the Regal Jade Civilization, they were no match against the powerful Element Spirit Civilization. In fact, the latter had already become a dominant power on the Other Shore at that time.
<br><br>
And as the second civilization, they were presented with numerous advantages.
<br><br>
The first civilization that was naturally formed in the chaos...
<br><br>
The first civilization to enter the Other Shore...
<br><br>
The first civilization that produced a Chaos Ancient God...
<br><br>
With their abundance of first titles, they were able to cover some truths in the long time of their development. There was no mistaking the great power they held.
<br><br>
"The energy vortex has served as a bridge between the Desire World and the Lust World. For countless years, numerous beings from various civilizations traveled through it with extreme caution. But I never thought that the Element Spirit Civilization was always guarding it." The Regal Jade Spirit heaved a sigh.
<br><br>
With them guarding, they could let anyone pass.
<br><br>
As for how to enter the iron house, the civilizations following it were clueless as to how it was done.
<br><br>
If it wasn't for Elvinia—the purified being that triggered the counterattack on the entire energy vortex—Zen would've never found the iron house.
<br><br>
Even if someone found it, it'd be impossible for them to enter since the Sanskrit words etched in the door were difficult to decipher. Luckily, Zen had Geoffrey in his inner world who was able to easily decipher Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
By some strange circumstances, Zen was able to break in.
<br><br>
Zen's questions were finally answered by the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
He blinked his eyes before proceeding to ask the Shape-shifting Spirit, "Since your master is the guard of this iron house, he can control the energy vortex as well, correct?"
<br><br>
"I..."
<br><br>
It was clear that the Shape-shifting Spirit didn't dare to reveal too much.
<br><br>
Elvinia began to threateningly toss the ball of light in her palm up and down. Her control of the Great Sanskrit Light was growing better every day.
<br><br>
Splash...
<br><br>
The Shape-shifting Spirit quickly changed back to its original form. Then, it began to say, "Indeed, my master can control the energy vortex. Every once in a while, he closes the passageway. Once, it was closed for a very long time…"
<br><br>
"It's true," the Regal Jade Spirit informed Zen in his mind. "The energy vortex has been closed for many times, but every time it was closed, it was soon opened. It is said that it was closed for a long time, during the 750th chaotic era. Then suddenly, it opened once more and no one knew what had happened."
<br><br>
"Where does your master control the passageway?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Within the iron house, except for the cages hanging on the wall, it was almost empty.
<br><br>
"Above there," replied the Shape-shifting Spirit.
<br><br>
Zen looked to the corner of the wall that it pointed at which was covered with a dozen Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
"My master could go up once he activates the Sanskrit words. I've never been there. You probably won't be able to go up either…"
<br><br>
Although the Shape-shifting Spirit was proficient in the languages spoken by many races and could change into various forms, it was incapable of understanding Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
"Really?"
<br><br>
Zen's lips curled up as he walked towards the corner of the wall and stood in front of the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
"What is that human doing?" asked the Shape-shifting Spirit.
<br><br>
"Trying to decipher the Sanskrit words, probably," Elvinia informed it with a shrug of her shoulders.
<br><br>
"That's impossible! Sanskrit words are never easy to decipher!" The Shapeshifting Spirit exclaimed, doubting Zen's success.
<br><br>
"Nothing is impossible. Don't forget how we came in," Elvinia reminded it coldly.
<br><br>
The Shape-shifting Spirit had been confined in this iron house for countless years, and it had forgotten that there were still those Sanskrit words set outside the iron house. The door wouldn't have been opened if those Sanskrit words were not deciphered.
<br><br>
"So you're saying…he really can decipher the words?" As the Shapeshifting Spirit stood still in disbelief, Zen reached out towards the Sanskrit words and began to press them.
<br><br>
"Buzz buzz buzz buzz…"
<br><br>
As Zen pressed a finger to each word, it began to glow. Soon, after he pressed ten times, a green light glowed on each word in the dark and the sound of metal grinding against each other could be heard. A metal staircase slowly began to descend from above.
<br><br>
"You…you did it…"
<br><br>
The Shape-shifting Spirit was left speechless.
<br><br>
Ever since it was trapped here, no one had successfully managed to break into the iron house. Now here it was witnessing an individual with great ability doing exactly what its master could do.
<br><br>
Where did he learn to decipher Sanskrit words so effortlessly? It had never seen such a thing happen before.
<br><br>
As the staircase drew closer to Zen, Elvinia drew near him as well.
<br><br>
Zen furrowed his brows as soon as he stepped on the stairs. He turned his head and stared at the Shape-shifting Spirit.
<br><br>
"Zen, what's wrong?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
She worried that the Shape-shifting Spirit might've told a lie and would eventually lead them right into a trap.
<br><br>
Zen quickly walked to the iron cage and asked, "You... have seen humans before?"
<br><br>
The Shape-shifting Spirit was different from other creatures on the Other Shore. It could morph into various creatures. Zen was sure it was only the first time that it had morphed into him, yet it mimicked him perfectly, with the exact appearance, movement, and language. It meant this was by no means the first time that the Shape-shifting Spirit had become a human.
<br><br>
Chapter 3511 Control The Energy Vortex Since the Shape-shifting Spirit felt that there was no room for it to bargain, it just told everything it knew.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the Element Spirit race especially liked to take the Shape-shifting Spirits as their pets.
<br><br>
It was mainly because the Element Spirit race did not have a stable form.
<br><br>
In fact, as one of the powerful civilizations, it was easy for the Element Spirit race to shape themselves into any form they wanted.
<br><br>
When a civilization was born and developed, however, their own consciousness could not change. Therefore, they stubbornly maintained their original state while they admired the wonderful forms of civilizations after them.
<br><br>
Overall, the entire race had the hobby of collecting pets and imprisoning slaves.
<br><br>
As it happened, the extremely powerful elites of the Element Spirit race were qualified to detain beings from any race as slaves and pets.
<br><br>
On the contrary, not all the members of the Element Spirit race on the Other Shore were considered as powerful, and some weak ones couldn't collect enough slaves to entertain themselves.
<br><br>
So, the easiest method available to them was to raise Shape-shifting Spirits.
<br><br>
After the Shape-shifting Spirits were trained, they could be transformed into almost anything that the Element Spirit race needed.
<br><br>
"Before I was sold to my master, I was locked up in a temple in Stage Twenty-five of the Other Shore like other Shape-shifting Spirits. There were many beings from civilized races held inside the temple, including two humans--a man and a woman," the Shape-shifting Spirit said.
<br><br>
Basically, the Shape-shifting Spirits were treated like a kind of commodity, as the Element Spirit race traded them. To become a qualified "commodity", the Shape-shifting Spirits must first learn to change themselves into many forms before they could become useful to their future masters.
<br><br>
Thus, the purpose of the many living creatures held in the temple was to serve as a guide for them to imitate. "Stage Twenty-five of the Other Shore?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"It's the Long Night Stage," Elvinia said.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in response. The Long Night Stage was still within the Desire World, which meant that there were humans in the Desire World.
<br><br>
"How long ago was the time when you were kept in the temple and met those human beings?" he asked again. If it was during the current chaotic era, then the news would be of low value.
<br><br>
Human beings had set foot on the Other Shore since the ancient times, in the form of physical body.
<br><br>
At that time, the Element Spirit race could easily capture even members of the Nine Li race. It wasn't even a big deal for them to catch the humans from the Pear Hill, but those races didn't have much to do with the human race of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"I don't remember. There should be at least ten chaotic eras ago..."
<br><br>
answered the Shape-shifting Spirit. Ten chaotic eras...
<br><br>
If that was the case, then the humans the Shape-shifting Spirit had met in the temple had nothing to do with the humans born in the present era.
<br><br>
It was safe to say that they were definitely the humans from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"What is the name of the temple?" Zen asked once more. "It's a temple of the Element Spirit race, built by the fire branch of the race.
<br><br>
It's called the Dark Fire Temple," said the Shape-shifting Spirit.
<br><br>
Zen kept the information in mind, then turned to climb the metal staircase.
<br><br>
Elvinia silently followed him.
<br><br>
When they reached the top of the iron house, their calm demeanor simultaneously changed into surprised looks.
<br><br>
The upper floor of the iron house was a completely different world compared to the desolate lower floor! Not far away from the stairway entrance was a large tank. Although it was tightly shut, they clearly felt a surge of strong power from it despite the distance. The power felt really pure, without anything messy mixed in.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia looked at each other and exclaimed, "The soul crystal!"
<br><br>
It wasn't long before Zen strode towards the tank and opened the lid.
<br><br>
His eyes glittered at the sight. The pure soul crystal filled up the large tank! "Oh, my God! There's so much of it!"
<br><br>
Even though Elvinia was good at hiding her emotions, she couldn't help crying out in excitement as well when she saw the huge amount of soul crystal.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen was also thrilled.
<br><br>
According to the Shape-shifting Spirit, those who kept Shape-shifting Spirits as pets had relatively low status in the whole Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Thus, how could a guardian of such a low position get so much soul crystal? While Elvinia was still in shock over the soul crystal, Zen had already calmed down and walked into the room.
<br><br>
There was an iron table beside the large tank, and a row of Sanskrit words were engraved on both of its sides.
<br><br>
Quite different from the previous dreary Sanskrit words, these Sanskrit words continuously emitted red light.
<br><br>
In the middle of the two rows of Sanskrit words was a sunken place, inlaid with a strangely shaped metal token.
<br><br>
Zen tried to pull out the metal token, but it didn't move at all when he used a bit of strength. He then continued to increase his strength, but it seemed that the metal token was merged with the metal table. He absolutely couldn't pull it out.
<br><br>
After he thought for a while, he ended up turning to Geoffrey for help again.
<br><br>
In only a short time, Geoffrey had figured it out and told Zen what to do through the Regal Jade Spirit. It turned out that there were two ways to use the Sanskrit words. One was to take the metal token out, and the other was to turn it on.
<br><br>
"Taking it out is easy to understand, but what does it mean to turn it on?"
<br><br>
Nevertheless, he followed Geoffrey's instructions and pressed the Sanskrit words. When the two rows of the red Sanskrit words shone with a green light, he was able to take out the token from the iron table easily.
<br><br>
Out of curiosity, he inserted the metal token back into the iron table and pressed the Sanskrit words in another order.
<br><br>
This time, instead of green light, a colorful beam of light came out of the Sanskrit words--and it was the same color as the energy vortex outside! Now, another interesting thing was happening at the same time as well.
<br><br>
There was a colorful wave of light that began to glow in the middle of the room in the upper floor. Soon enough, a small energy vortex appeared in front of Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
"This energy vortex..." Elvinia muttered.
<br><br>
She couldn't help but be surprised once again.
<br><br>
"Don't be afraid, it's just a phantom," Zen assured her. This energy vortex had no energy at all, or at least Zen could not feel any from it.
<br><br>
Although it was a phantom, the energy vortex in front of them should be in harmony with the large vortex outside. Now, both ends of the channel were closed, just like what Zen and Elvinia had encountered outside.
<br><br>
"The guard..."
<br><br>
"Turning it on..."
<br><br>
"Control it..."
<br><br>
The information from the Shape-shifting Spirit and Geoffrey filled Zen's mind and kept him thinking. A thought flashed in his brain, then he stretched his hand towards the vortex. The area he touched was soft as cotton.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to pull it, the center of the small vortex twisted.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the center of the energy vortex outside began to twist from the middle.
<br><br>
He thought more for a while, before he stretched his hands towards both ends of the small and long vortex, then curled it up.
<br><br>
At the same time, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, who were still waiting on the stone platform of the Desire World, screamed.
<br><br>
"The energy vortex has changed again!"
<br><br>
"The passageway is not only closed, it is also completely rolled up. What happened?"
<br><br>
"Isn't it still changing its shape? The energy vortex has turned into the shape of a human, right? Is it some trick of the eye?"
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace could not understand what was happening.
<br><br>
Even Dorothy also stared blankly at the energy vortex. She was confident that Zen was still alive, but she was still worried because Zen hadn't reached the Desire World by now. It meant that he was still trapped.
<br><br>
Was the change in the energy vortex related to anything that might be happening to Zen? Chapter 3512 Rummage Around The energy vortex swirled and constantly changed its shape in Zen's hands.
<br><br>
According to the information Geoffrey and the Shape-shifting Spirit had provided, the guard might be able to control the energy vortex freely through this way.
<br><br>
Then again, that was only his guess. After all, he was in the iron house, so he couldn't see the outside world.
<br><br>
The sight of Zen rubbing the energy vortex's phantom made Elvinia a little curious. "Go to the door and see if those energy bands disperse," he ordered.
<br><br>
In turn, Elvinia nodded and went downstairs to the entrance of the iron house.
<br><br>
When she looked out along the entryway, her face looked slightly surprised.
<br><br>
The energy bands had besieged the iron house, but now the energy bands were far away.
<br><br>
She immediately returned to the upper floor and told Zen, "Those energy bands are already far away."
<br><br>
It looked like Zen had already guessed it, though. He pointed to the energy vortex in his hand and said, "The iron house is in this part of the energy vortex, and we're out of the vortex now."
<br><br>
"If that's the case, can we step into the Desire World directly?" Elvinia asked. However, Zen shook his head and replied, "Maybe we can't."
<br><br>
The Other Shore seemed to be a complex multi-layer space.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Desire World and the Lust World might not be in the same space. On the other hand, the energy vortex played a role in connecting the two worlds.
<br><br>
Therefore, anyone who wanted to enter the Desire World had to go through the energy vortex.
<br><br>
"Then what should we do?" Elvinia asked, her eyes blinking a few times.
<br><br>
Despite her questions, Elvinia was also clever enough to figure it out on her own.
<br><br>
As she stayed with Zen, however, it seemed that she didn't think too much about it.
<br><br>
"Since the energy vortex can be controlled, it's easy for us to go through it,"
<br><br>
Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
At that moment, he reached out and grabbed the phantom of the energy vortex again. He gently fiddled with it, and then the energy vortex became elongated. Finally, he was able to expand the passageway in the middle.
<br><br>
In Stage Fourteen, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace saw that the energy vortex wriggled a few times before it returned to its original state, but the energy channel, which was already restored to its original state, was still twisting. This energy vortex stretched constantly and extended down to the Desire World. Furthermore, the small passage in the center was surprisingly wide and went down like a staircase.
<br><br>
"What happened to the energy vortex?"
<br><br>
"With such a large space, it's easy to pass through..."
<br><br>
"Is it because of Princess Elvinia?"
<br><br>
"It's impossible!"
<br><br>
Many of the Oneness Sky Palace disciples were still dumbfounded as they watched the energy vortex change.
<br><br>
They guessed that Elvinia had found a big secret in the energy vortex, and controlled the entirety of it. This assumption, however, wasn't logical at all.
<br><br>
Quite some time had passed, and the energy vortex still floated between Stage Thirteen and Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
History told that the origin of this powerful energy vortex was still unknown. A few people speculated that it was the foundation for the construction of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But to control a mass of pure energy? It was impossible.
<br><br>
Among so many disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace, perhaps only Dorothy believed that such a thing was possible.
<br><br>
After all, she and Zen had travelled on the Other Shore, and she had seen him do many seemingly impossible things.
<br><br>
Yet, on a second thought, Dorothy guessed that Zen might have completed that thing along with Elvinia. The idea suddenly made her displeased.
<br><br>
"Dorothy, what's wrong with you?" Chaim asked in curiosity.
<br><br>
It turned out that he sensed the distressed emotions Dorothy's Soul of Light had released.
<br><br>
Now, the sudden change in the energy vortex meant that there was a high chance of Zen and Elvinia's survival. Dorothy should be happy about that, shouldn't she? "Nothing," Dorothy answered coldly.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Chaim was an experienced and wise man. When he thought about the past behaviors of the two women when they stayed with Zen, he was able to come up with an answer.
<br><br>
These two outstanding women from the Oneness Sky Palace both had extraordinary backgrounds. It would be difficult for Zen to deal with them in the future...
<br><br>
Meanwhile in the iron house, Elvinia stood in front of the tank.
<br><br>
The soul crystal in the tank swirled around and turned into a thin shiny thread, which was absorbed by her space ring.
<br><br>
The tank contained a large quantity of soul crystal. All the soul crystal the Oneness Sky Palace had collected in Stage Four might not even reach onethird of the soul crystal in the tank.
<br><br>
Although Elvinia's and Zen's Souls of Light had turned into Indigo Souls, they would suffer more pressure in the Desire World, and there was a higher demand on their Souls of Light.
<br><br>
There was always a lack of soul crystal, so Elvinia would not leave even a little bit of it.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he searched around in the room.
<br><br>
Next to the iron table were two cases, both unlocked.
<br><br>
Zen rudely opened one of them. The first case was empty and dark inside.
<br><br>
He opened the other one, and saw a row of black jades displayed in it.
<br><br>
He took out a piece of jade and placed it on his palm. Suddenly, an ice cold sensation spread throughout his being.
<br><br>
"What's this?"
<br><br>
The black jade exuded a unique aura, but it didn't contain the Other Shore Power. At that moment, he remembered No. 9527's words that he shouldn't underestimate those things that didn't contain the Other Shore Power, because they must have a special use.
<br><br>
Of course, he was very interested in them.
<br><br>
"This is the Body-strengthening Jade," the Regal Jade Spirit quickly replied.
<br><br>
"Body-strengthening Jade? What's it used for?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"It is used for body refining, similar to the soul crystal. It can be used to strengthen the body after it is refined, but..." The Regal Jade Spirit thought for a second, and then continued, "This might be useless to you."
<br><br>
Generally speaking, one could also cultivate themselves when their physical body had entered the Other Shore. Aside from cultivating slowly in the stages, there were also some shortcuts. One of them was to use the Bodystrengthening Jade to refine the body, which could quickly strengthen the body.
<br><br>
It was also the good way for the cultivation of the Wild Gods! In the past, the warriors didn't need any Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
It was still a pity that the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was prohibited, and even the Body-strengthening Jade became rare. Many super forces sold them at cheap prices, after they discovered some Body-strengthening Jades.
<br><br>
Now, the value of the Body-strengthening Jade was naturally much less than that of the soul crystal. "Since it can strengthen the body, why is it useless to me?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"The foundation for you to enter the Other Shore is not the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. You don't need to use it, but you can try," the Regal Jade Spirit proposed.
<br><br>
Zen had entered the Other Shore through the unique Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
Even his physical body was no longer his body in its true sense, but rather a completely supernormal one that was created through body refining.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Regal Jade Spirit was certain that the Body-strengthening Jade wouldn't be useful to Zen.
<br><br>
Regardless of whether he could use the thing or not, Zen took all the Bodystrengthening Jades from the bottom of the iron case and placed them into Elvinia's space ring.
<br><br>
Then, he rummaged around the iron house once more. Before he was about to leave, his eyes fell on the metal token embedded in the iron table.
<br><br>
Without too much hesitation, he reached out to light up the Sanskrit words around the token one by one, and then took the token out.
<br><br>
Chapter 3513 Myriad Spirits City The use of the metal token was to control the energy vortex.
<br><br>
Before Zen pulled it out, the Sanskrit words orbiting it emitted a red light.
<br><br>
Zen immediately came to the conclusion that the red light indicated Elvinia's existence as the purified being. When the token sensed the presence of a purified being stepping into the energy vortex, its mechanisms would be triggered to activate. The following reaction would be so vicious that it would cause the purified being to instantly perish inside the energy vortex.
<br><br>
Although Zen had managed to extend the energy vortex to a considerable degree, there was still a chance of him facing an assault if he left the iron house to enter the channel.
<br><br>
Because of that, it was in his best interest to pick it up and take it with him.
<br><br>
Upon reaching the lower floor of the iron house, Zen prepared to move past the darkness to leave the house. Before he could make his way out, he heard a familiar voice call out to him from behind.
<br><br>
"Wait, stop!" Elvinia demanded as she stopped in her tracks.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Zen asked, looking back, seemingly confused by her sudden change of mind.
<br><br>
Her eyes were barren of all emotions, as they screamed of murderous intents. "The Element Spirit Civilization is too powerful. We can't afford to offend them. They won't let us go that easily, as we've taken too many things."
<br><br>
As she spoke, her fingers glowed visibly as a light began to gather at her fingertips.
<br><br>
The monsters behind the iron bars of the cages became aware of her intentions for them. They shrunk themselves to a corner as they trembled in fear.
<br><br>
The Shape-shifting Spirit pleaded pitifully, "Please, I beg of you... Spare us! I've told you everything I know, just don't kill us..."
<br><br>
However, Elvinia stood with an unfaltering resolve. She showed no signs of going back on her decision.
<br><br>
Just as the blazing white light slowly became more violent amidst the darkness, Zen quickly acted up and grabbed ahold of her arm. "Stop it, Elvinia. Let them go."
<br><br>
Elvinia glanced at Zen with questioning eyes reflecting complicated emotions. She turned away and said in a low voice, "Don't blame me for being cold-blooded. You know the consequences of letting them go."
<br><br>
She was aware of Zen's tendency to feel sympathetic towards others and treat them with leniency. However, she didn't expect him to stop her in this situation.
<br><br>
"No, you have my word. My lips are sealed. I won't utter a word to anyone!" The Shape-shifting Spirit begged as it screamed with its voice filled with sincerity to gain Zen's favor. It even went as far as to morph into a human girl and got on its knees to plead with both hands clasped near its chest.
<br><br>
At this sight, Zen couldn't help but let out a loud sigh. Even if the spirit kept its word and didn't expose them, its master would still have various means of obtaining information from its memory.
<br><br>
He turned his gaze towards the monsters and asked, "You have been confined for so long. Have you ever thought of escaping?"
<br><br>
"Escape?" the Shape-shifting Spirit switched its gaze between Zen and the cage and spoke with low spirits. "We can't leave the darkness."
<br><br>
More than half of the iron house remained cloaked in darkness, which was similar to the environment of the Dark Region. The Shape-shifting Spirit and the monsters trapped in cages were living creatures of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Their adaptive nature towards the dark and their poor resistance against the light were obvious.
<br><br>
"Then how did you get trapped in here?" Zen asked, seemingly confused.
<br><br>
"We were brought here in a box. There must be a black box," replied the Shape-shifting Spirit.
<br><br>
As soon as he heard it talk about a 'black box, ' a recollection of encountering that object transmitted in Zen's mind. The furrows on his brows relaxed as the past confusion now cleared up. "I see..."
<br><br>
After he finished his words, he turned around and climbed back up on the upper floor and took down a black box stationed at the corner of the wall.
<br><br>
He had overlooked the black box before. The Body-strengthening Jades had directed his complete attention towards them, causing him to disregard it.
<br><br>
Curious as he was, he began to explore to uncover what was so special about this object. The bottom of this black box seemed to have nothing out of the ordinary. However, as Zen reached to discover what was inside it, he found an independent Dark Region lying dormant underneath the box.
<br><br>
"Is this what you were talking about?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes! This is it!"
<br><br>
Realizing its days of being trapped were about to end, the Shape-shifting Spirit couldn't help but give in to its emotions and felt thrilled. During its rush of excitement, it forgot it had morphed itself into a naked human woman and even made provocative postures. Zen's eyes widened before he looked away instantly and scowled in an annoyed tone, "Transform back immediately!"
<br><br>
After the Shape-shifting Spirit switched back to its original shape, Zen broke the iron cages as though they were insignificant planks of wood.
<br><br>
The initial appearances of those monsters were intimidating, but they weren't violent in the slightest way. It also helped ease the tension amongst them after they communicated with the Shape-shifting Spirit. One by one, the monsters walked out of their respective iron cages without uttering a word before getting into the black box in Zen's hands.
<br><br>
After storing the black box securely into Elvinia's Sumeru Space, the pair advanced to the small door in front of them.
<br><br>
Zen was the first to walk out of the door. Soon after, a cracking sound echoed in the distance as the dazzling thunder wings appeared on his back and fluttered gracefully before spreading wide. Shortly after, Elvinia walked out of the door and rushed into his embrace, holding onto him tightly.
<br><br>
The original channel of the energy vortex had expanded seven to eight times. As a result, it was far more spacious. The restless energy bands were rendered useless as they had no effect at all. Elvinia could fly leisurely between them without a hitch by using the Cloud Flying Wheel if she wanted.
<br><br>
However, she didn't intend on it. She'd rather remain in Zen's arms and let him escort her to their destination. Silently, she curled up in his embrace and held onto him tightly.
<br><br>
Flying on the broad and quiet channel was as easy and simple as walking on the ground for Zen. He maneuvered himself with ease, and within less than half a minute, Zen had rushed out of the energy channel and fell on the stone platform. As he flew, he left behind a series of electric light that fluttered in the air before it disappeared.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia!"
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia has finally returned!"
<br><br>
"What a relief..."
<br><br>
Seeing Elvinia descend with the safe embrace of Zen, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace who awaited their return quickly surrounded them.
<br><br>
At the sight of Elvinia and Zen so close to each other, Chaim instinctively glanced at Dorothy, who stood beside him. She watched them with empty eyes as she clenched her fists and bit her lip. Unlike the others, she stood rooted to the ground.
<br><br>
Curious as they were, the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief also huddled around Elvinia and began throwing numerous questions her way, pestering her.
<br><br>
Not wanting to explain, Elvinia brushed past them after saying a few cold words.
<br><br>
The senior disciples could do nothing but bear with Elvinia's cold treatment of them. They had heard of many tales regarding Thad and his strength, and now they finally had the opportunity to see him up close.
<br><br>
They were looking forward to meeting with Thad and Elvinia the most.
<br><br>
The Lust World and the Desire World were worlds apart. The battles that took place in the Desire World were far more violent. However, this time, the Oneness Sky Palace weren't just going to encounter the super forces but also the powerful forces belonging to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It didn't matter whether it was Thad or Elvinia, it was clear both of them would prove to be a great help to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
After all the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace gathered, they were led out of the stone platform by the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, and they headed towards the depths of Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Although they were both situated on the Other Shore, the Lust World and the Desire World were notably different from one another.
<br><br>
Stage Thirteen in the Lust World was capable of applying pressure on the Souls of Light, but that pressure was resistible. However, the purple light curtain hanging in the sky of the Desire World put even more intense pressure onto them.
<br><br>
Some of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were unable to resist it.
<br><br>
Hence, they were forced to constantly consume soul pills after walking a certain distance to support themselves.
<br><br>
After a short period of being led by the senior disciples, they passed through a mountain. Their gaze fell upon a huge city placed in front of them, with massive aura emanating from it.
<br><br>
Zen had encountered cities before in the Lust World. He had visited the large city of the Abyss Spirit race.
<br><br>
However, the number of creatures in the Lust World could not be compared with that of the Desire World. Even their strength was on a league of its own. The city of the Abyss Spirit race was simply not on par with the one in front.
<br><br>
"Are there living creatures of the Other Shore in that city?" A new disciple asked while giving his shoulders a nervous rub.
<br><br>
"Of course, this is the Myriad Spirits City. It obviously has creatures of the Other Shore inside it, and their numbers are immense. But don't worry. As there are many powerful races in this stage, creatures have to follow the rules. As long as they don't act recklessly, we'll be safe," a senior disciple replied to calm the nerves of the anxious disciple.
<br><br>
Even the senior disciples were nervous when they stepped into Stage Fourteen for the first time.
<br><br>
Chapter 3514 Blackmail Two giant figures stood at the main entrance of the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
The giants were as tall as hills, but their heads were not much larger than a human's.
<br><br>
They would have made for a funny sight were it not for their threatening auras. The weapons in their hands were only ordinary-looking, thick wooden clubs, but light constantly flashed through the cracks on them.
<br><br>
They were clearly not ordinary weapons.
<br><br>
When the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace arrived at the gate, one of the giants shifted the thick wooden club in his hand and blocked the way.
<br><br>
The senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were used to this. One of them walked forward and talked to the two giants politely. He took out some soul pills from his space ring.
<br><br>
The cost of entering the Myriad Spirits City was not high, but there were more than a hundred disciples, so in sum, it was a large expense.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Oneness Sky Palace would foot the bill.
<br><br>
But even after the senior disciple paid the soul pills, the giant refused to open the door. He pointed at Zen and Elvinia with his wooden club. "Those two can't enter!"
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia frowned.
<br><br>
The giant didn't seem to be highly intelligent and only knew souls. He apparently saw Zen and Elvinia as creatures on the Other Shore. Even if strictly speaking, they didn't really belong to that classification.
<br><br>
"Why?" the senior disciple asked, confused.
<br><br>
"You have to pay tenfold soul pills for creatures on the Other Shore," the giant said.
<br><br>
No one from the Oneness Sky Palace had ever come to the Myriad Spirits City with their corporeal bodies before, so even the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief had no idea about this rule.
<br><br>
Tenfold soul pills were not a big amount. Moreover, the Oneness Sky Palace would compensate for the extra soul pills. The senior disciple paid them without hesitation, and even gave another twenty thousand soul pills to the two giants as a gift.
<br><br>
After receiving the extra soul pills, the two giants grinned contentedly and turned to press their hands on the huge door.
<br><br>
Creak! Creak! The huge door was pushed open by the two giants.
<br><br>
'The giants' strength is about 1, 200 divine megatons, ' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
Such strength was nothing in the Source World, but it was still very powerful on the Other Shore. At the very least, the Souls of Light would have found it difficult to handle.
<br><br>
However, Zen and Elvinia, who was a purified being, should be able to put up a resistance to it.
<br><br>
But there would be other powerful creatures in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
After the door was pushed open, a straight and wide path was revealed to everyone, extending ahead of them to the far distance.
<br><br>
The buildings in the Myriad Spirits City were of different styles. Some of them were unusually large, while some were small and low. This was really a city where many races dwelt.
<br><br>
From time to time, creatures of completely different shapes and appearances passed along the path.
<br><br>
Although there were also many races in the Source World, they were all born in the same round of chaos, and made up of flesh and blood. However, many creatures on the Other Shore had fled from the past rounds of chaos, like the Regal Jade Civilization and the Metal Civilization. Their forms differed greatly. These creatures were naturally stranger.
<br><br>
"Look! What creature is that?"
<br><br>
someone asked, pointing at what looked like a hemp rope crawling on the ground.
<br><br>
The gray hemp rope was made up of over one thousand sections. It resembled a snake, but had no head or tail.
<br><br>
"This is not just one creature. There are about a thousand creatures connecting to each other. They are the Thousand-Section race," a senior disciple replied.
<br><br>
Hearing this, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace grew curious and surrounded the rope.
<br><br>
The rope started trembling before its constituents scattered away, and then gathered together again to form a strange shape.
<br><br>
At this, a sudden change came over the senior disciples. One of them quickly came forward, smiling, and spoke to the members of the ThousandSection race in a pacifying voice.
<br><br>
After a while, the members of the Thousand-Section race scattered again, returned to the rope-like formation, and resumed crawling on the ground.
<br><br>
"These creatures won't just attack anyone, but you must be careful with your words and deeds. If you unwittingly provoke them, you will suffer consequences," the senior disciple warned.
<br><br>
The creatures had actually been in a battle array just now. Although each of them was only the size of a thumb, when all of them were gathered together, their explosive power was enough to instantly kill the Souls of Light present.
<br><br>
"Understood,"
<br><br>
the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace replied in unison. They would take care to behave themselves from here on out.
<br><br>
These creatures were the same as the Abyss Spirit race in Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
They couldn't afford to offend them.
<br><br>
After they had walked along the path for a distance, the disciples were led to another remote path. A senior disciple pointed ahead. "Our stronghold is up ahead," he said.
<br><br>
In the horizon, there was a low wooden building, old and shabby in appearance.
<br><br>
The disciples felt a little disappointed at the sight. The Oneness Sky Palace seemed to be much weaker in the Desire World than it was in the Lust World.
<br><br>
At least in Stage Four, the Oneness Sky Palace had a lofty temple. It seemed to have nothing in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Sensing the disappointment of the disciples, one of the senior disciples sought to appease them. "Stage Fourteen is just a springboard. The strongest warriors of our Oneness Sky Palace are all in the upper stages. If you are talented and persistent, you won't stay in this stage for long."
<br><br>
Zen, unlike the other disciples, wasn't surprised by the situation of the Oneness Sky Palace in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
The Abyss Spirit race dominated Stage Eleven and had all the super forces in the Source World under their command. The creatures in the Desire World were stronger and were in larger numbers. Naturally, the Souls of Light didn't have as high a status as them.
<br><br>
However, Zen still found it unbelievable just how low the Souls of Light's status here was.
<br><br>
As they approached, they saw several creatures walk through another path.
<br><br>
These creatures walked upright with two feet, but their heads resembled that of insects, their arms as sharp as steel cones.
<br><br>
They gathered around the doorway of the wooden building. "Come out and meet us!" one of them called out in a sharp voice.
<br><br>
At this, several Souls of Light hurried out, led by Abdul. There were usually some disciples guarding the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Abdul was usually arrogant and fierce in front of disciples who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but he was very subservient to the insect men. "My friends, what brings you here?"
<br><br>
The leader of the insect men scoffed disdainfully, "You are merely Souls of Light. How dare you claim to be the Oneness Sky Palace? That's hilarious! But no matter! When will you give us the thirty finger-size chunks of soul crystal and thirty jades?" the insect-looking leader demanded.
<br><br>
The reason the weak Souls of Light had difficulty establishing a foothold in the Myriad Spirits City was that they were constantly blackmailed like this by these creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chapter 3515 Trade Your Life For The Jade The insect man's request gave Abdul a terrible headache.
<br><br>
Thirty finger-size chunks of soul crystal were equivalent to around 30 million soul pills. Even if the Body-strengthening Jade wasn't considered useful for Souls of Light, it still wasn't cheap and cost around 20 million soul pills.
<br><br>
Normally, fifty million soul pills weren't that high of a price for the Oneness Sky Palace; however, the costs added up considering they had paid five times over the course of six months to a different race each time! "My friends, don't you think you've asked too much from us?" Abdul asked with a frown.
<br><br>
The insect man smirked. Without any warning, he raised his right arm from which a pointed cone flew out, brushing past Abdul's side and hitting the wooden building behind him. The round hole left behind by the cone was not a reassuring sight.
<br><br>
"This is the price set by Master Ghost Scorpion. Surely you won't dare disobey?"
<br><br>
This Ghost Scorpion was very notorious in the Myriad Spirits City, often cited as one of the most powerful forces in it.
<br><br>
"We've already paid a lot to the city guards this year..." Abdul countered.
<br><br>
"I don't know what you're talking about. Those guards are entirely different from Master Ghost Scorpion. Bah! I'm wasting my time with you Souls of Light!" the insect man spat, raising the sharp cone in his hand.
<br><br>
There were rules set in the Myriad Spirits City against fighting but the Oneness Sky Palace did not have a good foothold in terms of power and influence. It wouldn't be seen as that big of a deal if the Tail Insect race killed a couple of Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Realizing that he was left with no room for negotiation, Abdul was forced to retreat and return to the wooden building.
<br><br>
He was able to survive Stage Seventeen with his strength.
<br><br>
But there were not many people in the Land of Sword Grief, so the Oneness Sky Palace saw it fit to send some of them to guard this place every once in a while.
<br><br>
It was an annoying job. Even though Abdul hated it, he had no choice but to obey what the Oneness Sky Palace told him to do.
<br><br>
He collected the necessary amount of soul crystal and Body-strengthening Jade, reluctantly handing them over to the people of the Tail Insect race.
<br><br>
Abdul couldn't help but feel extremely depressed when he handed over those 30 finger-size chunks of soul crystal! That amount could've greatly strengthened his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
It was understandable that he would be greatly unwilling to give them to other races.
<br><br>
Abdul could only watch as the leader of the Tail Insect race put away the soul crystal and the jade. Master Ghost Scorpion would surely be pleased with them and would naturally give them a small percentage of their earnings.
<br><br>
Just as they were about to leave with their haul, the Tail Insect race turned and spotted the Oneness Sky Palace disciples on the other side of the road.
<br><br>
The senior disciples from the Land of Sword Grief had a bad feeling about this and chose to lead the new disciples to leave. "Wait! Come here, all of you," the insect man screamed.
<br><br>
Abdul's heart skipped a beat, worrying whether the people of the Tail Insect race would pick on the disciples or something.
<br><br>
These senior disciples did not dare disobey, choosing to bite the bullet and leading the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace to the entrance of the wooden building.
<br><br>
The leader of the Tail Insect race tutted. "Tsk, tsk! You brought so many dirty souls from the Lust World again?"
<br><br>
According to the belief system of the creatures in the Desire World, Souls of Light were dirty beings who continued to corrupt themselves since they did not have the protection of their bodies. They were to be despised according to culture.
<br><br>
Of course, this was not taken well by the disciples especially since they had recently improved to the Chaotic Source Realm. To be considered dirty by these insects was a great offense. Though they did not refute, the disciples trembled with restrained fury.
<br><br>
Elvinia herself threw the insect man a murderous look.
<br><br>
Their nerve to look down on them was enough for her to consider killing them on the spot.
<br><br>
Zen, in contrast, was much calmer.
<br><br>
There were always idiots who were ignorant, rude, and arrogant. The correct way to deal with them, as Zen learned, was to just remain calm.
<br><br>
Killing them wasn't going to be that much of an issue, but they had to consider the fact that they were newcomers. Causing trouble for the Oneness Sky Palace could have unforeseen circumstances later on; thus, Zen chose to observe rather than act.
<br><br>
"Each new soul should pay a hundred thousand soul pills, which means you owe us ten million in total. As for the Body-strengthening Jade, you can give me eight pieces since I'm feeling generous," the insect man demanded with a smug smirk.
<br><br>
Abdul couldn't help but gasp. "What? Is that also an order from Master Ghost Scorpion?"
<br><br>
The insect man scoffed. "It's my order! Why? Can't I give out my own orders?"
<br><br>
Just as Abdul was about to open his mouth to argue, a few disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't help themselves and burst out.
<br><br>
They had long since known that the Desire World was filled with all sorts of trouble but never to this extent. To see their seniors live in such a way where literal insects bullied them was depressing! Any longing for the Desire World disappeared at that moment.
<br><br>
"What makes you think we'll give you the soul crystal?"
<br><br>
"Didn't we already pay you a lot?"
<br><br>
"This is blackmail! Is Myriad Spirits City truly this lawless?!"
<br><br>
The disciples couldn't help but air out their grievances one by one.
<br><br>
Abdul and the senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief turned pale and were already thinking up of ways to control this situation.
<br><br>
"Are you questioning me?" the insect man asked. They did not expect such attitudes from the newcomers. Normally, the Tail Insect race got their way owing largely to their influence and connection to Ghost Scorpion. "Let me tell you something." Or rather, he showed them something.
<br><br>
In a flash, the insect man raised his sharp cone towards the nearest disciple and attacked.
<br><br>
The force was enough to smash the Soul of Light! "Wait."
<br><br>
Zen had come forward, with Elvina following closely behind.
<br><br>
The sight of these two perplexed the Tail Insect race.
<br><br>
Humans on the Other Shore were rare but Elvinia seemed to be a real living creature. They hadn't seen one for so many years.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen confused them since they couldn't see his appearance clearly. Yet, they could deduce that he entered the Other Shore with his physical body! That wasn't supposed to happen! However, their strangeness wasn't enough for the Tail Insect race to treat them seriously. The Other Shore was filled with creatures strange, powerful, and strong so this bit of weirdness wasn't as concerning to them as one would think. "What are we supposed to be waiting for?"
<br><br>
In contrast to the disinterested Tail Insect race, the new disciples, Abdul, and the senior disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were practically beaming with hope at the sight of Elvinia.
<br><br>
She had a body! Their only hope now was that she was strong enough to protect them. They still worried a great deal about her since they weren't sure just how powerful she was. Angering a master in the Myriad Spirits City could potentially be bad news to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"I have the pieces of jade," Zen said, taking out a few and showing them to the members of the Tail Insect race.
<br><br>
Perhaps it was because the two had physical bodies that made the Tail Insect race slightly more courteous. "You should have taken them out a long time ago since you had them! Ha!" The insect man let out a hearty laugh and motioned to take the jade away from Zen's hand.
<br><br>
Abdul and the others heaved a sigh of relief. This should be enough to buy peace for some time.
<br><br>
However, just as the insect man was about to take his earnings, Zen retracted his hand. "I didn't say I was going to give them to you for free."
<br><br>
He was obviously teasing and the insect man did not appreciate it one bit.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?"
<br><br>
Zen tilted his head and smirked. "If you want them, pay for them with your life."
<br><br>
When he said this, a strong wave of killing intent suddenly burst out from Elvinia. Her entire body trembled with raw power as she grabbed the head of one of the insect men.
<br><br>
Chapter 3516 A Patron Even though the members of the Tail Insect race could react quickly, Elvinia launched an attack too suddenly that they could not retaliate.
<br><br>
Because of this, the member of the race had no time to react before his head was pulled away from his body by Elvinia.
<br><br>
Getting a glimpse of the green blood about to gush from the headless body, Elvinia tossed it hundreds of feet away. It landed with a solid "boom" into the wall.
<br><br>
She then tossed the head right to the ground like it was nothing. Her eyes were so dark, thirsty for murder. The other members of the Tail Insect race refused to even look her in the eye.
<br><br>
"This... Princess Elvinia, this..."
<br><br>
Abdul and the other senior disciples from the Land of Sword Grief could not believe their eyes.
<br><br>
On the one hand, when they heard that Elvinia had a corporeal body, they immediately knew that she could be a great advantage for the Oneness Sky Palace. However, she had just reached the fourteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. According to normal pace, her current strength was not supposed to be this powerful.
<br><br>
On the other hand, they all agreed that she shouldn't have gone out of her way to kill the member of the Tail Insect race.
<br><br>
What Abdul feared was not the members of the Tail Insect race, but the force behind them.
<br><br>
Her reckless move could just get them all into trouble.
<br><br>
Abdul and others had no clue that Elvinia had been holding back for so long. Her sudden course of action might have taken them by surprise, but they were not aware of what went on with her.
<br><br>
If she were being reckless, she would have torn all the members of the Tail Insect race to pieces by now. They had insulted and disrespected the Oneness Sky Palace before, which made her even more angry.
<br><br>
She was never one to show mercy, especially to weak creatures she despised. The creatures in the Dark Region were a prime example, and the Tail Insect race would have been no exception.
<br><br>
If Zen hadn't warned her to restrain her emotions, there was no telling what she would have done already.
<br><br>
It was not until they had gone too far that she finally stood her ground.
<br><br>
"You... How dare you kill our clansman?!" the leader of the Tail Insect race hissed, disgusted by what she had just done.
<br><br>
He was not expecting a measly human to actually show any signs of resistance—especially like this.
<br><br>
Looking at Zen, Elvinia smirked, "I think I want to get rid of more insects..."
<br><br>
"Alright." Zen nodded with a smile. "Just make sure you leave one alive."
<br><br>
As soon as he gave the go signal, Elvinia dashed in their direction, leaving streaks of light trailing behind her.
<br><br>
At Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, there were no suitable clothes for her.
<br><br>
Because of this, she was covered in clothing knitted from threads of light.
<br><br>
That was why she resembled a shooting star as she ran at full speed.
<br><br>
To the crowd, she was a flash of white light. Just then, the heads of the members of the Tail Insect race crashed into the sky, leaving only headless bodies behind.
<br><br>
Within a couple of seconds, the bright light sped through the crowd, leaving only the leader of the Tail Insect race alive.
<br><br>
He looked around, trying to process what had just happened. Just a moment ago, he had planned to fight back, but seeing Elvinia's abilities left him trembling in his shoes. Nevertheless, he still stood his ground. "You've killed so many of our clansmen. There is no doubt that Master Ghost Scorpion..." He tried his best to appear fearless, though a drop of sweat trickled down his temple, "Master Ghost Scorpion will definitely kill you!"
<br><br>
Zen came out from behind, smiling. "Which is why I instructed her to keep you alive," he chuckled. "Go on, inform your Master Ghost Scorpion. I wonder how he plans to get rid of us."
<br><br>
The lone member of the Tail Insect race was astonished to hear what Zen said. He saw Zen as too confident to care about the Tail Insect race or even their Master Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
But since Zen seemed so willing to let go of him, he didn't dare speak another word. There was no way he wanted to die for no reason.
<br><br>
Just as the survivor was about to walk away, Abdul gritted his teeth and said, "Well, I guess we should just kill them all at this point... Don't want to leave some that could cause future trouble!"
<br><br>
It would be a big trouble that the members of the Tail Insect race had all died at a place of the Oneness Sky Palace. However, the Oneness Sky Palace could still deny it, and settle their actions with a large amount of soul pills at the worst. But if they allowed one member of the Tail Insect race to stay alive, the consequences would be unimaginable.
<br><br>
Elvinia gently rubbed her fingertips at the sound of Abdul's idea. To her, she didn't care about the insects one bit. She simply thought that they were too dirty, so she suddenly wanted to get a sword from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
She looked at Zen, silently asking if they should follow through to kill the last member of the Tail Insect race.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, was not convinced. "Let him go," he said, walking away.
<br><br>
The reason why he had allowed Elvinia to kill them was because he wanted to intimidate the force behind the race.
<br><br>
He didn't think it was a good idea to compromise, especially when their group was at a disadvantage. He didn't agree with Abdul's approach.
<br><br>
"Excuse me, but who the fuck are you? Are you trying to harm the Oneness Sky Palace?" Abdul slammed his palm on Zen's chest, shouting at him and gritting his teeth.
<br><br>
He was knowledgeable of Thad's name from the Land of Sword Grief. But very little was known of his identity and his relation with the Oneness Sky Palace, so it was hard to tell if Thad was actually a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
For Abdul, offending creatures on the Other Shore would only put the Oneness Sky Palace in danger. He believed that he had every right to be angry.
<br><br>
Zen shook off Abdul's hand, and leaned in close, smiling. "My name is Zen."
<br><br>
The senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were stunned to hear his name. All their eyes widened and mouths opened.
<br><br>
Likewise, the disciples who had just entered the Chaotic Source Realm were stunned as well. They remembered that Zen had been absent since his Soul of Light reached Stage Fourteen. Some people who had an inkling never dared to ask him. Now they were sure that "Thad" was in fact, Zen.
<br><br>
As for Chaim, he had already guessed it correctly before, so he was not at all surprised at the turn of events.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had unintentionally exposed some of his secrets in the Chaotic Source World. At this point, there was no need for him to hide this fact any longer, especially because it limited much of his actions. That was why now was the perfect time to reveal this secret.
<br><br>
In front of the wooden building, Zen suddenly turned around and patted his forehead. "By the way, make sure that insect gives back the jade and soul crystal he took from us just now."
<br><br>
He winked at everyone, and then made his way into the wooden building, somewhat enjoying everyone's speechlessness.
<br><br>
Nearly every super force had one or even several races on the Other Shore as their patron, and the Oneness Sky Palace was no exception.
<br><br>
However, the race that was behind the Oneness Sky Palace was not very strong in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. This placed the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief in a very compromising position, a position of disadvantage. Over the past years, they had just been giving in. It was through this persistent perseverance that they were able to find a place to reside in. This was the main reason why they were unwilling to stay in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
With a sternness in his expression, Abdul did not fail to mention the current situation of the Oneness Sky Palace to Zen. "What you are doing will make us unable to do anything on the Other Shore," he said harshly.
<br><br>
"I wonder how major races, like the Bearing race and the Separate Abyss race, are treated in Stage Fourteen anyway," Zen replied calmly, facing the already agitated Abdul.
<br><br>
"Their patrons are all strong in Stage Fourteen, so they definitely have no threats on the Other Shore," Abdul responded impatiently. This brought about a sense of dismay among the senior disciples from the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
After all, they were all notable and outstanding members of the Oneness Sky Palace. None of them was willing to be bullied on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After being in deep thought, Zen said with a smile, "If you always give in, the insects may only go further. And because we don't have a powerful patron behind us, that should be our number one priority right now."
<br><br>
"Easy for you to say! Who would we even find to be our patron? Would you do it? Would you be our patron?" one of the senior disciples asked.
<br><br>
Zen turned his head and looked at Elvinia, who was sitting calmly by his side. Her corporeal body of purified being had been carved to perfection, as it was a product of imagination. On top of that, she was full of charm and zest. Then, Zen turned around and answered, "If we can't find a patron, we'll make one of our own."
<br><br>
Chapter 3517 Entrusted Streaks of dark-red light flickered in the compound eyes of the insect man.
<br><br>
He shuttled nimbly through the Myriad Spirits City, his heart filled with grief and indignation for his dead companions.
<br><br>
Because the lowly Souls of Light managed to find a couple of corporeal bodies, they wanted to challenge Master Ghost Scorpion. They were merely courting death.
<br><br>
Many ferns covered the northern part of the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Strange races populated the Other Shore, all of them sorted into classes.
<br><br>
The Tail Insect race lived up north, where several bug-like creatures resided.
<br><br>
When the member of the Tail Insect race came to the northern part of the city, he headed straight into a deep cave. Various small pots hung within the cave walls, in which a variety of strange bugs were kept.
<br><br>
When he reached the very bottom of the cave, a strange fragrance filled the space.
<br><br>
It was the scent of the Fragrant Butterfly race. Master Ghost Scorpion was particularly fond of this fragrance. He always kept several female members of the race close by.
<br><br>
Soon, the insect man reached the end of the path.
<br><br>
A hoarse voice resounded. "Have you collected the Body-strengthening Jade and soul crystal as I asked?"
<br><br>
From within the darkness, a black scorpion rested his tail on the ground. A small hook at the end of his tail reflected a harsh light, making the insect man swallow down his nerves hard.
<br><br>
He had seen how Master Ghost Scorpion punished his subordinate before.
<br><br>
The subordinate's skin was merely scratched by the hook before his entire body turned black. He died in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
The member of the Tail Insect race was feeling anxious about the news he had to bring back. He knew he would undoubtedly piss the Ghost Scorpion off.
<br><br>
"Yes," he replied nervously.
<br><br>
"Haha! I didn't expect the Oneness Sky Palace to endure it." The Ghost Scorpion laughed in the darkness before continuing, "Hand over the jade and soul crystal. I'll have someone else collect them another day."
<br><br>
The Ghost Scorpion hadn't ever acted against the Oneness Sky Palace. The latter was under the protection of the Myriad Spirits City guards, after all.
<br><br>
But the Ghost Scorpion was entrusted to continue suppressing the palace.
<br><br>
He was determined to see how long they could endure.
<br><br>
"But…" There was a moment of hesitation before the messenger continued, "The Oneness Sky Palace has taken back the jade and soul crystal I've collected."
<br><br>
"What?" The Ghost Scorpion's voice turned deadly-cold. His tail curled up from where he rested on the ground.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace seems to have found two corporeal bodies. A human woman took action and killed my comrades. She left me alive so I could bring you the news. Master Ghost Scorpion, please uphold justice for us!" The insect man seemed grim.
<br><br>
"Corporeal bodies? How could they have corporeal bodies?" the master asked in confusion.
<br><br>
Because only Souls of Light were allowed to enter the Other Shore, it had been many years since he had ever seen a corporeal body. The news was truly puzzling.
<br><br>
"It's true… My comrades wouldn't have died otherwise…" the messenger continued.
<br><br>
A moment of silence passed before the Ghost Scorpion leaned in from the darkness. "They left you alive so that you could inform me of what happened?"
<br><br>
"Yes, that's right."
<br><br>
"Then your mission has been completed."
<br><br>
Suddenly, his tail rose and stabbed at the messenger with incredible speed.
<br><br>
While the sharp hook managed to slice through the messenger's body, it failed to cut his shell, leaving only a thin, invisible wound on the surface.
<br><br>
All the messenger could see was the Ghost Scorpion wagging his tail.
<br><br>
Realizing that he was in a highly dangerous situation, he turned around, ready to flee. But before he could even take another step, he suddenly went numb and fell to the ground, losing consciousness in an instant.
<br><br>
In the darkness, a sturdy creature took slow steps forward.
<br><br>
A layer of black armor covered the creature, and six pairs of eyes sat on his head. His hateful face looked strong.
<br><br>
Standing on his feet, he positioned his long tail behind him.
<br><br>
Two beautiful women of the Fragrant Butterfly race followed him behind.
<br><br>
They resembled humans with their graceful bodies.
<br><br>
"Master Ghost Scorpion, are you going to attack the Oneness Sky Palace?"
<br><br>
The woman's voice was incredibly alluring.
<br><br>
"Since someone entrusted me to do it, I have no other choice," replied the creature.
<br><br>
"The Souls of Light of the Oneness Sky Palace can be killed rather easily,"
<br><br>
the woman continued. "But how should we deal with the two corporeal bodies?"
<br><br>
The Ghost Scorpion gently flicked his tail and pierced it into the dead messenger's head. Soon after, he obtained his memory, witnessing in his mind everything that had just unfolded.
<br><br>
The creature's lips curled into a subtle smile. "Take them as two creatures on the Other Shore."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace Hearing Zen's words, Abdul didn't feel relieved. Instead, he grew worried.
<br><br>
"It's easier said than done. The Ghost Scorpion will be coming for us soon.
<br><br>
Do you know that …"
<br><br>
As Abdul rambled on, a cold light flashed in Elvinia's eyes. "If you're afraid, then leave the Other Shore. If you keep talking nonsense, I won't hesitate to kill you as well."
<br><br>
Elvinia might not have been much of a match for Abdul in the Land of Sword Grief, but on the Other Shore, Abdul was nothing more than a fly she could squish between her palms.
<br><br>
Abdul fell into silence, and so did the other senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace belonged to Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Since Elvinia took Zen's side, what else could they say? But Zen didn't care much about Abdul's attitude. He merely turned to the other disciples and said, "Everyone, you have reached Stage Fourteen. For safety's sake, you can temporarily withdraw from the Other Shore. I will make further plans once Elvinia and I explore this place more thoroughly."
<br><br>
The disciples there were rather discouraged. If they were involved in a fight, they might be trapped by something like the Soul Binding Thread, unable to escape.
<br><br>
"Well then… Zen, Princess Elvinia, be careful!"
<br><br>
"We must leave now."
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
And so one after another, the disciples' Souls of Light began to dissipate.
<br><br>
Before withdrawing from the Other Shore, Abdul threw Zen a fierce glare.
<br><br>
At last, only Zen, Elvinia, and Dorothy were left.
<br><br>
"Dorothy?" Zen called out.
<br><br>
"I'm here with you," she called back.
<br><br>
"What?" Elvinia said with a frown.
<br><br>
"I didn't say that I wanted to stay with you. I am merely accompanying Zen," Dorothy explained flatly but firmly. Though she had been rather quiet for a while, she couldn't help but throw back a retort.
<br><br>
"You're only risking your life by staying here. You'd better leave." Elvinia was still defiant.
<br><br>
"Oh, really?" A mocking smile appeared on Dorothy's face. "Do you really think you're stronger than me with this corporeal body?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3518 The Door Dorothy's words surprised Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
The difference between the Soul of Light and the physical body was obviously vast.
<br><br>
Zen had no idea how powerful Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the Snake Goddess were on the Other Shore, but at least on Stage Fourteen, there was a world of difference between the Soul of Light and the physical body.
<br><br>
Moreover, Elvinia's purified being body was much stronger than that of a normal creature on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"I really don't know how you could be so confident," Elvinia sneered, staring at Dorothy.
<br><br>
"Oh, do you want to find out? I can show you," Dorothy snapped in response.
<br><br>
From their tone of voice, it was obvious the two women were raring for a fight.
<br><br>
Zen decided he could no longer just stay silent.
<br><br>
He had never been good at dealing with relationship problems. Back then, the bickering between Margaret and Letitia had also troubled him a lot.
<br><br>
Zen strode over and stood between the two. He faced Dorothy, speaking to her gently, "This place is too dangerous for you. You can come back after Elvinia and I deal with this matter."
<br><br>
"I won't be a burden!" Dorothy retorted stubbornly.
<br><br>
She had always brimmed with confidence, being the renowned talent of the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
This had only gone unnoticed because she had always been content to just play backup to Zen, who tended to draw all the attention.
<br><br>
She would never stand for being treated like a liability! "If you don't want to get in the way, then get out of here," said Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Elvinia!" Zen hissed, a warning in his low voice.
<br><br>
Elvinia shrugged and took a step back, looking indifferent.
<br><br>
Zen then turned back to Dorothy. "I have never seen you as a burden.
<br><br>
Without your help, I wouldn't have made it this far." He paused, before adding, "Besides, I've seen your door."
<br><br>
While Dorothy and Elvinia were both top women talents in the Oneness Sky Palace, they were different on essential points.
<br><br>
Elvinia was the biological daughter of Flamine and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
She had inherited their bloodline.
<br><br>
On the other hand, it seemed that Dorothy didn't inherit the bloodline of Yasamin. No one had ever mentioned the reason to Zen, but it didn't mean that he couldn't guess it.
<br><br>
The reason why Yasamin still thought highly of Dorothy was not just that she cared for her and doted on her. It was because there was something special in Dorothy. Zen had discovered in the Sacred Mallow Temple the sealed door that had been hidden within Dorothy's soul.
<br><br>
Dorothy trembled at Zen's words.
<br><br>
"I happened to discover it when I made use of the Great Dominance Technique at that time," Zen explained. "You don't need to deal with the weak creatures on Stage Fourteen. Just trust me and wait for us in the Land of Sword Grief, okay?"
<br><br>
Dorothy decided to compromise.
<br><br>
Although she could open the door after she reached Stage Fourteen, her grandma, indeed, cautioned her that she should only open it as a last resort.
<br><br>
"All right." Dorothy nodded at Zen. Then her eyes met Elvinia's again.
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't avoid her gaze, staring back coolly.
<br><br>
"Humph!"
<br><br>
Dorothy snorted at Elvinia as her soul finally dissipated.
<br><br>
After Dorothy left, Elvinia tilted her head. "You are in quite the dilemma, aren't you?" she asked Zen with a playful smile.
<br><br>
"I don't understand what you're talking about," Zen muttered unconvincingly.
<br><br>
"I'll make you understand, soon enough." Elvinia smiled slyly, amusement glinting in her eyes.
<br><br>
The stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace was now empty. Only Zen and Elvinia were left there.
<br><br>
In contrast, the bronze palace in the Land of Sword Grief was now in an uproar! "Zen and Elvinia made short work of the members of the Tail Insect race!"
<br><br>
"Wouldn't that enrage the Ghost Scorpion?"
<br><br>
"Pissing off the Ghost Scorpion in the Myriad Spirits City would only mean trouble! I shall go report on this matter!"
<br><br>
Abdul exited the training room. Soon, the news had spread out.
<br><br>
The news spread from the first floor to the second floor. The disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were shocked to learn about this development.
<br><br>
"Even if Elvinia has a physical body, she still wouldn't be able to fight against the powerful creatures of Stage Fourteen."
<br><br>
"I'm afraid this means we can't take even a single step in the Desire World in the future!"
<br><br>
"I really didn't expect them to cause such trouble!"
<br><br>
But they could do nothing but wait anxiously.
<br><br>
It was impossible to change the situation. There were some warriors who volunteered to enter the Other Shore to persuade Zen and Elvinia to come back, so the Oneness Sky Palace could send others to mediate in the dispute.
<br><br>
However, this plan was rejected by Abdul and the others. They knew that given Zen's and Elvinia's personalities, they would not be persuaded easily.
<br><br>
As the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief racked their brains on what to do, dozens of members of the Tail Insect race poured into a street from the north of the Myriad Spirits City, rushing forward at high speed from both sides.
<br><br>
The living beings in the Myriad Spirits City were divided into different grades. The Tail Insect race was known for being domineering and bloodthirsty, and they grew even more unscrupulous after they pledged allegiance to the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
When the other creatures of the Other Shore saw them, they all scrambled out of their way.
<br><br>
Soon, the Tail Insects were directly outside the wooden building of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
At one nod from the leader of the group, the other members of the race stretched out their hands, each of which held what appeared to be a green grass ball. The smell that emanated from the ball was like that of the Soul Interdicting Water and the Soul Binding Thread. Such an item was obviously used to prevent anything from leaving the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Swish, swish, swish! The Tail Insects threw the grass balls through the open wooden doors.
<br><br>
The balls exploded when they landed inside, diffusing a thick green smoke.
<br><br>
Whoever was infected by this smoke would not be able to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Soon, a cloud of thick smoke had filled the wooden building. Just as the members of the Tail Insect race moved to raid the building, a voice came from behind them. "Are you looking for me?"
<br><br>
The Tail Insects were stunned. The few who reacted quickly stomped their legs, causing their Other Shore Power to erupt. They waved the sharp cones in their hands and charged at Zen.
<br><br>
"Too slow."
<br><br>
Zen stood still, not making a move at all.
<br><br>
As the cones came toward him, Zen just twisted slightly, evading them completely.
<br><br>
His hands darted out.
<br><br>
Biff, biff, biff! He plucked out the approaching creatures' heads, as easily if he were simply picking vegetables.
<br><br>
Every head he plucked off was sent flying in the air. After doing that nine times in a row, Zen stepped back. The bodies of the nine Tail Insects remained standing, even as their heads fell to the ground.
<br><br>
"How disappointing. Are these useless creatures all Master Ghost Scorpion can send to a fight?" Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
Having just witnessed the massacre of their peers, the compound eyes of the other members of the Tail Insect race gleamed with panic.
<br><br>
Chapter 3519 Taking Action Personally The members of the Tail Insect race had received an order from the Ghost Scorpion asking them to kill everyone belonging to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
It never occurred to them that no Soul of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace remained on the Other Shore. Moreover, a powerful human being was now standing before them. How could they not be afraid? The remaining members of the Tail Insect race panicked and began to chuck the green grass balls at Zen.
<br><br>
Before the balls could explode, another figure appeared behind them. It was none other than Elvinia.
<br><br>
A long sword appeared in Elvinia's hand.
<br><br>
She did not want to touch these dirty bugs.
<br><br>
When she had found a long sword in the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace, she had known that it would come in handy, even though it was ordinary.
<br><br>
She slashed the sword at the creatures, drawing a long, uneven line that turned green almost instantly. Every member of the Tail Insect race, except the last one, dropped dead.
<br><br>
Zen walked out of the billowing green smoke. Elvinia glanced at him and said, "You're tainted with this smoke. What if you can't get out of the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"I don't intend to leave," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
Elvinia pursed her lips. The Ghost Scorpion hadn't shown up yet, and they didn't know how powerful the Ghost Scorpion was. But Zen looked pretty confident.
<br><br>
"You, you...," the last survivor uttered, his voice trembling.
<br><br>
"Tell the Ghost Scorpion to come and meet us in person," Zen said, his voice sending chills through the survivor's spine.
<br><br>
Relieved, the Tail Insect quickly made his escape.
<br><br>
News traveled fast among the races in the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
The news that a number of Tail Insects had died in close proximity to the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold spread like wildfire. The Tail Insect race followed the Ghost Scorpion, which meant that the Oneness Sky Palace would surely have pissed off the Ghost Scorpion this time.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace? Human beings can only enter the Other Shore with their souls, right?"
<br><br>
"These souls have always been weak and easy to bully. They are courteous when they meet the members of our race. How dare they provoke the Ghost Scorpion?"
<br><br>
"They are in serious trouble!"
<br><br>
The ones who were curious moved towards the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold. Some hid behind the wall and some went into the living area to secretly take a peek at the goings-on.
<br><br>
They were shocked to see the corpses of the Tail Insects scattered on the ground.
<br><br>
A man sat at the door of the wooden building, his back erect and posture majestic, while a woman stood beside him, with a sword in her hand. They had no intention of escaping or of letting anyone escape.
<br><br>
"It's going to be a good show!"
<br><br>
"It looks like they are not afraid of the Ghost Scorpion."
<br><br>
"That's because they don't know how strong the Ghost Scorpion is! They will die miserable deaths!"
<br><br>
In the City Guard House of the Myriad Spirits City Two giants entered the City Guard House to report on the news of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
A bear-like creature sat on the host's seat of the hall of the City Guard House. At the news, he only said, "I see."
<br><br>
"Sir, should we stop the Ghost Scorpion?" one of the giants asked.
<br><br>
"No need," the black bear replied, shaking his head.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace usually sent in a considerable amount of soul pills every year in hope of the City Guard House's protection in exchange.
<br><br>
Ordinarily, the City Guard House would solve it in person. But this time, it had, alongside the Ghost Scorpion, been entrusted with the mission to take action against it.
<br><br>
What was more, even if the Ghost Scorpion didn't make a move, the City Guard House definitely would.
<br><br>
An hour later, three red giant scorpions and over a hundred Tail Insects crawled out of the underground cave at the north of the city.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia had already killed two groups from the Tail Insect race, but they still weren't successful in attracting the Ghost Scorpion's attention. It looked like the Ghost Scorpion had no intention of fighting them personally.
<br><br>
The three giant scorpions weren't intelligent but were ferocious creatures.
<br><br>
They were forbidden from entering the Myriad Spirits City. But some of the rules were only for those at the bottom of the society. And the Ghost Scorpion didn't have to comply with the rules.
<br><br>
The three scorpions, carried by the Tail Insects, moved along the street and caused complete chaos, shrieks to fill the air.
<br><br>
This excited the creatures of the Other Shore, who were observing them secretly.
<br><br>
"The Ghost Scorpion has sent the Red Scorpion Squad!"
<br><br>
"They can kill the man and the woman ten times over!"
<br><br>
"They are not strong enough but they still want to fight the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
How arrogant do they have to be!"
<br><br>
When the three red scorpions were carried into the path, another cloud of green smoke rose.
<br><br>
It was a few minutes before the green smoke dissipated gradually.
<br><br>
The many creatures hiding in the darkness were shocked as they watched this scene.
<br><br>
The three red scorpions lay on the ground, their tails cut off. The corpses of the Tail Insects were piled up like a hill.
<br><br>
This time again, Zen left alive one member of the Tail Insect race and asked him to go back and inform the others.
<br><br>
"They have destroyed the Red Scorpion Squad so easily!"
<br><br>
"Are these two human beings that formidable?"
<br><br>
"Something is wrong!"
<br><br>
The Red Scorpion Squad was the backbone of the Ghost Scorpion, and each red scorpion had extraordinary levels of strength.
<br><br>
These giant red scorpions were at the very least stronger and more powerful than many creatures at Stage Fourteen except for the creatures of the Dark Region. But they being killed so suddenly and in one fell swoop shocked those creatures of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
An hour later, many huge butterflies emerged from the underground cave at the north of the city, their fragrance spreading in all directions. The burly figure of the Ghost Scorpion soon followed.
<br><br>
If the first group of the Tail Insects had been only to test them, the Red Scorpion Squad he had later sent should be enough to kill the two human beings.
<br><br>
But the situation hadn't gone as the Ghost Scorpion had expected. Even the members of the Red Scorpion Squad had been destroyed. Only one Tail Insect had survived and returned to tell the story.
<br><br>
"Sir, is it necessary for you to kill the two human beings?" a woman from the Fragrant Butterfly race asked.
<br><br>
The Ghost Scorpion squinted and responded, "I will take personal action against them."
<br><br>
The Ghost Scorpion rarely left his underground cave.
<br><br>
He had lurked in the Myriad Spirits City for many years, and didn't get on well with the City Guard House. But the City Guard House couldn't do anything about him. Catching the Ghost Scorpion was a distant daydream for the City Guard House.
<br><br>
"But will the City Guard House..." another woman from the Fragrant Butterfly race said worriedly.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. The City Guard House won't create any disturbance," the Ghost Scorpion sneered.
<br><br>
The Ghost Scorpion then led the women of the Fragrant Butterfly race onto the path. Soon, they spotted Zen and Elvinia in the distance.
<br><br>
His six pairs of eyes glowed with a bright red light. And as he noticed the corpses of the three giant red scorpions, he filled with rage. How dare these insignificant human beings kill the members of the Red Scorpion Squad! Zen still sat there in silence, a calm expression on his face.
<br><br>
The moment he saw the Ghost Scorpion's sturdy black body, and his thin, long tail, he spoke, "You are finally here."
<br><br>
"All of this will be over if we kill the Ghost Scorpion, won't it?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
"It's hard to say," Zen said, shaking his head.
<br><br>
After Zen and Elvinia had entered the Myriad Spirits City, these creatures had caused trouble for the Oneness Sky Palace, which was not coincidental.
<br><br>
There must be a reason for it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3520 Tell The Truth Zen's identity had already been exposed in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
At least from the Soaring Snake Sword, they could easily tell where Zen came from.
<br><br>
Perhaps the Bearing race wouldn't attack the Oneness Sky Palace so soon, but that didn't mean that they wouldn't want to assault Zen on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was known that the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold on Stage Fourteen was not difficult to find, and it was easy to observe the movements of their disciples.
<br><br>
Thus, it would be effortless for the Bearing race to use the Other Shore creatures to attack him. "When will it end?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
"When they are afraid," Zen said as the corner of his lips curved up. He slowly got up and announced, "You step back. I'll fight this battle."
<br><br>
After all, the sharp edge of the Ghost Scorpion's tail contained a highly toxic poison, and he didn't want Elvinia to take the risk.
<br><br>
In reality, he had indeed guessed the truth.
<br><br>
When he and the other members of the Oneness Sky Palace entered the Desire World, the Sun Crow race discovered them. Soon enough, the news quickly spread to the other races.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace was weak on Stage Fourteen, a complete opposite to the powerful forces on Stage Fourteen like the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
There were a total of two cities on Stage Fourteen, namely, the Myriad Spirits City and the Sky Water City. There were a large number of Other Shore creatures in these two cities. The Star Falcon race, which came from the same origin as the Sun Crow race, was the leading force in the Sky Water City. The relationship between those two races was similar to that of the Separate Abyss race and the Abyss Spirit race.
<br><br>
Although the Star Falcon race didn't exactly hold great power in the Myriad Spirits City, they were still a powerful Other Shore race, and it was still easy for them to deal with the likes of the Oneness Sky Palace--which appeared on the Other Shore in the form of souls.
<br><br>
Three thousand feet away from the wooden building of the Oneness Sky Palace was an oval-shaped building with a terrace on top. More than a dozen Souls of Light stood on the terrace, which turned out to be from the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and other two races.
<br><br>
"At first, I was worried that if they directly retreated from the Other Shore, then we would have no way to deal with them," a Soul of Light said in a lazy voice.
<br><br>
"Retreat from the Other Shore? That's impossible. Unless they don't plan to improve their cultivation, it's inevitable that they will enter the Other Shore," another Soul of Light sneered. It had two wings spreading on its back, which obviously told that it came from the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
"But I think these two people are quite confident about themselves. They don't have the slightest intention of giving in."
<br><br>
"Well, it's actually a good thing. Overconfidence would bring them death.
<br><br>
When they are dead, out task is finished..."
<br><br>
The best way to kill Elvinia and "Thad "was to do it on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and the other two races had undoubtedly chosen the simplest and most effective way to solve the problem.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen sauntered towards the Ghost Scorpion and said, "We have no grudge against each other. Someone must have entrusted you with the task of attacking me. Tell me who it is."
<br><br>
The Ghost Scorpion, however, thought of the two humans as mere fish on the chopping block, especially now that they had been tainted with the green smoke. It was impossible for them to escape.
<br><br>
They were the ones who should have felt despair! In a normal case, Zen should have knelt down and begged for mercy, in hopes that he could spare his life.
<br><br>
Yet, what he was currently doing was completely out of the Ghost Scorpion's expectation. Zen didn't feel anxious. In fact, he didn't seem to be so afraid of anything, and not even the slightest fear could be felt from him.
<br><br>
"You killed my subordinates, of course you have to die. How could you say that I have no grudge against you?" the Ghost Scorpion smirked.
<br><br>
No matter what happened, the Ghost Scorpion had ethics and those who had entrusted him with the task had given him a generous reward. So, why would he tell who was behind the scheme all just because of a word from Zen? It was true that this human warrior would end up as a corpse soon, but there were a lot of spies in the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
In fact, the Ghost Scorpion clearly felt that there were many eyes staring at their position now.
<br><br>
At that moment, a few huge creatures ran towards them from the other end of the path.
<br><br>
They were mice as tall as an ox! In addition, they carried the Souls of Light of the Ear Mice on their backs! Squeak! "Master Ghost Scorpion! Please don't hurt him!" one of the Ear Mice shouted.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were creatures that could be seen almost anywhere.
<br><br>
In the Desire World, their power could not be underestimated.
<br><br>
The murine creatures in the Desire World in particular had quite a close relationship with the Ear Mice. They were a compelling force in the Myriad Spirits City, strong enough to contend against the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had also formed a close relationship with Zen on Stage Thirteen, and they also benefitted a lot from him in the Chaotic Source World. Besides, they also got a fair share of Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
After their spies which penetrated everywhere had gotten the news about the Oneness Sky Palace, they immediately jumped into action.
<br><br>
Their efforts led them to where they were right now, with the purpose to convince the Ghost Scorpion not to harm Zen.
<br><br>
"Don't hurt him? That is impossible!" the Ghost Scorpion said flatly. "The mice from the southern area actually want to mess around! Who do they think they are?!"
<br><br>
"Ear Mice, you'd better not provoke Master Ghost Scorpion. This is not something you can change!" The women of the Fragrant Butterfly race sneered.
<br><br>
If it had been another time, the Ghost Scorpion might have given them some face.
<br><br>
Given the special situation today, however, the Ghost Scorpion clearly wouldn't listen to them.
<br><br>
"Master Ghost Scorpion, I think we could work something out. The price can be negotiated," one of the mice said.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice appeared to be very generous, and there were no doubts about their powerful financial capacity.
<br><br>
"There is nothing we can talk about on this matter. You can leave now," the Ghost Scorpion coldly replied.
<br><br>
"Master Ghost Scorpion..."
<br><br>
Just as one Ear Mouse was still trying to persuade the Ghost Scorpion to change his mind, Zen interrupted them and said, "I appreciate your kindness, but I'll take care of this."
<br><br>
The Ear Mice who sat on the back of the giant mice looked at Zen in confusion.
<br><br>
According to the information they had obtained before, Thad was powerful, but he might not be strong enough to fight against the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
"Did you hear that? This little guy doesn't want you to intervene. Mice, you'd better get out of here," the Ghost Scorpion chuckled. He seemed to become more and more interested in Zen. Zen's next words, however, suddenly made his body stiff.
<br><br>
"Let's continue our conversation about who ordered you to kill me. Now, tell me the truth, and I can give you a quick death," Zen said in a calm voice, as if he had already decided the fate of the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
The women of the Fragrant Butterfly race, who watched from behind, were all stunned.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice beside them were also dumbfounded, and even the giant mice that they sat on stared at Zen with eyes wide open.
<br><br>
Only Elvinia, who stood in front of the wooden building, looked rather indifferent.
<br><br>
At that point, rays of light that were as thin as needles danced nimbly on her fingertips.
<br><br>
Recently, she had gotten more and more proficient in using the Great Sanskrit Light. The light her fingers emitted looked ethereal, and could change into almost any shape according to her will. In addition to being able to turn it into clothes, she also wanted to try if she could turn it into a pair of wings.
<br><br>
Chapter 3521 Dismemberment All the Other Shore creatures that lurked, peeped, and eavesdropped in the buildings on both sides of the road couldn't believe their ears.
<br><br>
"What did that young human say? Did I hear it wrong?"
<br><br>
"He was threatening Master Ghost Scorpion!"
<br><br>
"Oh, my God! He must be crazy!"
<br><br>
The Ghost Scorpion might not be the strongest Other Shore creature in the Myriad Spirits City, but he was definitely a local powerhouse. He controlled almost the entire underground world in the north of the Myriad Spirits City by himself, and even the City Guard House couldn't do anything to him.
<br><br>
Whoever dared to provoke him would have a miserable ending. Usually, they seldom had the chance to see the sunrise on the next day.
<br><br>
Yet, there was Zen, who unhesitatingly instigated such a being. The creatures on the Other Shore all thought something was wrong with him.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and other races, who stayed on the terrace of the oval-shaped building three thousand feet away, were also shocked and confused at Zen's words.
<br><br>
"That guy's reaction is a little unexpected..."
<br><br>
"Humph! He is only trying to pretend and bluff when he is dying!"
<br><br>
"Anyway, he knows he is going to die. Maybe he felt it was good to pretend to be a hero before he dies."
<br><br>
In their opinion, it was still impossible for Zen to fight against the Ghost Scorpion even if he had a corporeal body. After all, it had cost them a lot of resources to hire the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Ghost Scorpion went stiff for about a dozen seconds, before he finally let out a muffled wild laugh.
<br><br>
"Hahaha!"
<br><br>
As the Ghost Scorpion's laughs rang out, the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race behind him burst into giggles as well.
<br><br>
"Humans are so interesting. I..."
<br><br>
Before the Ghost Scorpion could finish his words, Zen took a step forward.
<br><br>
That one step he took towards the Ghost Scorpion was over a hundred feet.
<br><br>
He was able to do so because he used his heels to generate power and forcefully suppress the ground, thereby leaving a crater behind. At the same time, he stretched his hand towards the Ghost Scorpion and gently passed by his body. Then, he stood behind his opponent, at the side of the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race.
<br><br>
At that moment, his hand was holding the Ghost Scorpion's right arm.
<br><br>
"He didn't tell the truth, so I have no choice but to let him die in pain. Take it," he said flatly.
<br><br>
The female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race who had been cackling with the Ghost Scorpion at Zen's words, had never thought that things would change in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
The wide grins on their faces froze as they stared at the arm Zen was holding in disbelief. One of them glanced at the Ghost Scorpion, only to find that his right arm was indeed detached from his shoulder.
<br><br>
When Zen saw that none of the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race wanted to take the arm, he shook his head and casually threw the disconnected limb on the ground. Then, he turned around and stomped his foot once again.
<br><br>
"Dong!"
<br><br>
A muffled sound came from the soft ground once again. The high pressure caused the soil to spread out everywhere like waves, and created a bottomless hole in the ground. At the same time, Zen once again passed by the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
This time, however, the Ghost Scorpion had time to react.
<br><br>
He wasn't slow to react by any means, it was just that Zen's current speed was far beyond his limit.
<br><br>
The moment Zen attacked him for the second time, the Ghost Scorpion chose to fight back.
<br><br>
He stretched out his remaining arm towards Zen and simultaneously swept his tail.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
Yet, Zen had gotten away from him in a flash.
<br><br>
Moreover, he also took the Ghost Scorpion's left arm with him! In just two confrontations, Zen had already removed both of the Ghost Scorpion's arms, but the latter didn't look bothered at all. Instead, his lips stretched into a grim smile. "Human, your speed is indeed beyond my expectations, but it's a pity for you..."
<br><br>
He wagged his tail as he spoke, and the hook on it glowed faintly.
<br><br>
He was quite proud of his tail, which could move extremely fast.
<br><br>
Without any warning, the tail's hook swept past Zen's waist.
<br><br>
Now, the Ghost Scorpion was sure that he could kill Zen with his tail.
<br><br>
To his surprise, however, he heard Zen say indifferently, "Have you heard of the Chaotic Source Spirit?" "The Chaotic Source Spirit?" Ghost Scorpion said dumbly.
<br><br>
As a master in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, he did not know much about the higher stages of the Desire World. He had heard that the Chaotic Source Spirit was connected with the Source World before, but he didn't think that was important. Thus, he had no idea why Zen mentioned it out of the blue.
<br><br>
"Your attack just now was far from enough to exhaust my Chaotic Source Spirits," Zen said with a shake of his head. "It is even less than sufficient to harm me, not to mention... I'm not afraid of the poison at all."
<br><br>
Zen had experienced all kinds of highly toxic poisons before. Therefore, the poisonous hook on the Ghost Scorpion's tail couldn't harm him.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the Ghost Scorpion's attack did not exhaust the Chaotic Source Spirits, nor did it cut through his skin.
<br><br>
Such were the big advantages of the Chaotic Source Realm warriors.
<br><br>
While the Ghost Scorpion still pondered over Zen's words, Zen's body flashed across him with two muffled sounds once again.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen had detached one of the Ghost Scorpion's legs.
<br><br>
Naturally, he lost his balance and fell down to the ground.
<br><br>
"Ahhh!" the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race behind Ghost Scorpion let out a series of shrieks.
<br><br>
After a while, they finally came back to their senses, but they didn't seem to have any better means of expression other than screaming.
<br><br>
Then, two of them flapped their wings and released a gust of colorful poisonous smog. The poisonous smog could be inhaled through mouths and noses. Anyone who had absorbed it would become paralyzed and unable to move.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the poisonous smog, the Ear Mice immediately went away to dodge it.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he simply ignored the existence of such poisonous smog, and he didn't pay any attention to the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race. He once again passed by the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
The other leg of the Ghost Scorpion was also taken away by Zen.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Even his tail, which he was very proud of, was also detached from his body.
<br><br>
Now with only a head and a torso, he lay on the ground, unable to move.
<br><br>
Lying on the ground, he felt like he was dreaming.
<br><br>
Just now, he had been thinking about how to deal with this arrogant and unruly human. But less than half a minute later, he had almost been dismembered by Zen. He could not help but doubt the facticity of all this.
<br><br>
"I'll give you one more chance to tell me whose orders you're under," Zen asked.
<br><br>
He thought he had guessed it correctly, but still he wanted to confirm his guess.
<br><br>
Without even launching any powerful attack, the Ghost Scorpion had lost his arms, legs, and even his tail. It was not until then that he was finally filled with fear.
<br><br>
He had accepted the commission without thinking too much. Now, it turned out that he had fallen into such a deep pit, which was way beyond what he had predicted.
<br><br>
He felt a lot of remorse and hatred for the one who had asked him to do all this. "It's the Star Falcon race! The damn Star Falcon race!" Ghost Scorpion shouted loudly.
<br><br>
Zen had just arrived at the Myriad Spirits City and didn't know much about the races on the Other Shore in the Desire World, so of course, he didn't know anything about the Star Falcon race.
<br><br>
An Ear Mouse who was not far away explained to him, "The Star Falcon race is a major race in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. They occupy another city, which is called Sky Water City. They have been supporting the Sun Crow race."
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were well-informed, so they clearly knew about such information.
<br><br>
"The Sun Crow race?" Zen pursed his lips.
<br><br>
"Let me go..."
<br><br>
Just as the Ghost Scorpion was about to beg for mercy, he saw that Zen had stretched his hand towards his head. When he realized what was about to happen, his head was already decapitated.
<br><br>
Chapter 3522 Wealth Witnessing the death of the Ghost Scorpion, the members of the Fragrant Butterfly race took on a ghastly expression.
<br><br>
They had relied on the Ghost Scorpion, king of the underground world in the northern part of the Myriad Spirits City. Massive change was bound to happen due to his sudden death.
<br><br>
Overwhelmed with anxiety, they froze in place, unable to even consider fleeing.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light on the terrace of the oval-shaped building were also dumbfounded.
<br><br>
"The Ghost Scorpion is actually weak?"
<br><br>
"That man is too powerful. The Ghost Scorpion was no match for him..."
<br><br>
"Alas, I made a wrong judgment before. I have to go back to report this."
<br><br>
These Souls of Light had stayed to watch Thad and Elvinia die. They had thought that their demise was certain, so the unexpected turn of events shocked them numb.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A demon woman disappeared from the terrace and returned to the Source World.
<br><br>
The demon women were not staying in the Divine Lair all the time. Most of the time, they lived in golden divine trees. When the demon woman appeared in a golden divine tree, she spread out her wings and flew towards the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
At the sight of the flying figure, the Sun Crows rose high into the air and squawked excitedly.
<br><br>
Upon the arrival of the demon woman, she knelt before Elizabeth.
<br><br>
"The Ghost Scorpion at Stage Fourteen was easily killed by the man named Thad?" Elizabeth clarified.
<br><br>
"Yes, he had no power to fight back," the demon woman answered, head still bowed.
<br><br>
Even though she had witnessed the whole thing with her own eyes, she still couldn't believe it.
<br><br>
"I see." Elizabeth nodded calmly. "The Ghost Scorpion is just an unimportant pawn, anyway. Don't worry. Continue observing. Someone else will fight Thad."
<br><br>
The creatures at Stage Fourteen were the weakest in the entire Desire World. It didn't matter even if they failed.
<br><br>
However, something bugged Elizabeth.
<br><br>
It was very likely that Thad was actually Zen. Although Elizabeth hadn't been able to confirm it, it didn't matter. As long as she could get rid of Thad and Elvinia, she would be willing to pay the price.
<br><br>
Spreading out her massive wings, she closed her eyes and transferred to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race and the other two races were not the only stunned ones.
<br><br>
All the creatures that secretly watched were also speechless, shocked stiff.
<br><br>
Everyone was afraid of the Ghost Scorpion, the leader of the underground world. Ordinary creatures didn't dare to provoke him. They would stay away from him lest they cause trouble. However, just now, he didn't even have a chance to strike back and died at the gate of the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace was just an ordinary force in the eyes of the creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The lowly Souls of Light of the Oneness Sky Palace were very careful to keep a low profile, and were usually polite to any creatures they stumbled across in the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
In fact, many creatures had taken advantage of their meek nature and robbed them of their soul pills, and occasionally, even soul crystal.
<br><br>
"Is that human brat an outsider hired by the Oneness Sky Palace?"
<br><br>
"I have never seen that woman. But that human man has actually come to the Other Shore with his corporeal body!"
<br><br>
"I extorted 20, 000 soul pills from them not long ago. If they find out what I did, I might be in big trouble!"
<br><br>
The people from the Source World could leave the Other Shore at any time if they wanted to, but the creatures on the Other Shore couldn't. If they had offended someone they shouldn't have, they'd have no choice but to run away from the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Like the other creatures on the Other Shore, the several Ear Mice that were watching from the backs of giant mice were also dumbstruck, staring at the corpse of the Ghost Scorpion. They had originally planned to help Zen get out of this situation, but apparently, he didn't need their help! At the same time, they felt somewhat relieved.
<br><br>
At the very least, they didn't have any bad blood with Zen. Then again, if they had been able to lend Zen a hand at the time, they could've asked for something in exchange.
<br><br>
"Ear Mice," Zen suddenly called out, interrupting their thoughts.
<br><br>
With a squeak, the leader of the Ear Mice answered promptly, "Thad, what can we do for you?"
<br><br>
Zen glanced at the corpse of the Ghost Scorpion and asked, "Since the Ghost Scorpion has occupied the northern part of the Myriad Spirits City for many years, he should have accumulated quite a bit of wealth and resources, right?"
<br><br>
Hearing Zen's words, the Ear Mice suddenly shivered.
<br><br>
They had been so shocked by Zen's power that they forgot this.
<br><br>
The Ghost Scorpion occupied the underground world in the northern part of the Myriad Spirits City. Over the years, he had accumulated wealth, but with his death, what would become of it? As long as the news of the Ghost Scorpion's death was spread to the north of the city, the creatures that followed the Ghost Scorpion would definitely scramble to take as much of the wealth he had left.
<br><br>
"I want half of his accumulated wealth. The other half belongs to you," Zen said.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice exchanged glances. Their leader promptly said to an underling, "Hurry up! Go to the north of the city!"
<br><br>
Like the Ghost Scorpion, the Ear Mice were also active in the underground world of the Myriad Spirits City. The Ghost Scorpion was in the north, while the Ear Mice were in the south. They each minded their own business, without interfering with each other.
<br><br>
Now that the Ghost Scorpion was dead, naturally, this was a great opportunity for the Ear Mice. Not only could they collect the immense wealth, but they could also take over the northern territory. As for Zen's request, they wouldn't have objected even if he asked for all of the wealth! The appointed Ear Mouse left quickly.
<br><br>
Zen indifferently glanced at the women from the Fragrant Butterfly race not far away, who had tried to attack him with poison just now.
<br><br>
However, he knew they were powerless against him, especially since the Ghost Scorpion was killed. He waved his hand at them and said, "You can go now."
<br><br>
The women trembled slightly as Zen addressed them.
<br><br>
They had been standing there, not daring to run away.
<br><br>
To their surprise, Zen just asked them to leave like that.
<br><br>
They couldn't believe their ears.
<br><br>
Once Zen finished his words, he immediately turned around and walked straight towards Elvinia. Unexpectedly, Elvinia cracked a smirk and joked, "Those women are beautiful. Take them back!"
<br><br>
"What? Since when did you make jokes?" Zen raised an eyebrow amusedly.
<br><br>
Elvinia's cheeks flushed.
<br><br>
It was true that she had become quite cheerful in the past six months.
<br><br>
Sometimes, she'd just blurt out something without thinking first.
<br><br>
It suddenly dawned on the women of the Fragrant Butterfly race that Zen truly didn't have any intention to deal with them, so they heaved a sigh of relief. Fluttering their wings, they prepared to flee.
<br><br>
Just as they took off, they heard something whistling through the air.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! All of a sudden, sharp green arrows rained from out of nowhere, piercing the women's wings and bodies.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the several beautiful women had been shot ruthlessly by countless sharp arrows.
<br><br>
Chapter 3523 Black Bear Creatures from the Other Shore resembling mole crickets, stood firm and held long bows. They pulled back on their bows and released a wave of sharp arrows.
<br><br>
Zen heard the sound behind him and turned towards it. He frowned as he looked on.
<br><br>
The arrows weren't aimed at him and Elvinia, but at the women of the Fragrant Butterfly race instead, killing them all.
<br><br>
Once all the arrows had been released, a 10-foot tall black bear emerged from behind the mole crickets. He stood tall, strong and unmistakably domineering with aggression glowing in his green eyes.
<br><br>
"The people of City Guard House are here..."
<br><br>
"Good timing!"
<br><br>
"The City Guard House and the Ghost Scorpion have always been at odds. I doubt they would offer any help to the Ghost Scorpion now."
<br><br>
All kinds of creatures from the Other Shore chimed in their speculations.
<br><br>
On the round terrace, Souls of Light of the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race all smirked when they saw the black bear.
<br><br>
If the Ghost Scorpion was not strong enough to kill Zen, the City Guard House should be able to do the trick! "The city guard!"
<br><br>
"Squeak! Sir!"
<br><br>
Several Ear Mice bowed respectfully at the sight of the black bear.
<br><br>
The city guards were a special force in the Myriad Spirits City. Many races from the Other Shore lived here and were constantly engaged in conflicts with one another. Because of this, the city guards had created laws and acquired a considerable amount of strength in order to maintain the peace within the city.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse race might have been quite powerful in the south of the city, but they still required the City Guard House's support and naturally had to show their respect to the black bear.
<br><br>
The black bear strode past the bodies of the Fragrant Butterfly women, paying no attention to the Ear Mice. He glanced at the dead Ghost Scorpion lying on the ground and cursed inwardly, 'Useless!' He then turned his glare towards Zen and asked, "Was it you who killed the Ghost Scorpion?"
<br><br>
"Yes, it was," replied Zen indifferently.
<br><br>
"Do you know what happens to those who commit murder in the Myriad Spirits City?" the black bear pressed further.
<br><br>
Hearing this made the Ear Mice uneasy.
<br><br>
One of the Ear Mice then raced up to him to explain, "Sir, it's the Ghost Scorpion that..."
<br><br>
"Fuck off!"
<br><br>
the black bear yelled at it impatiently and slapped the giant mouse away, sending it flying into the air.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Ear Mouse was quick enough to jump off its back and avoid being hit.
<br><br>
The black bear had no intention to kill the Ear Mouse. The giant mouse could bear the power of the bear's slap. Having only a Soul of Light, the Ear Mouse, however, was too weak and would have had its soul sent to pieces.
<br><br>
The rudeness of the black bear turned Elvinia's face grim. Silently, she lifted the long sword inserted into the ground next to her.
<br><br>
Zen's face showed no emotion, but his burning anger could be felt in his aura.
<br><br>
"Do you know the consequence of committing the crime of murder?" the black bear asked again.
<br><br>
"No, I don't," Zen replied coldly.
<br><br>
They were enemies, so Zen had no reason whatsoever to be polite.
<br><br>
"By the law of the Myriad Spirits City, the killer should be arrested by the City Guard House and sentenced accordingly. Please come with me to the City Guard House," the black bear ordered.
<br><br>
"The law of the Myriad Spirits City..." Zen put a finger to his chin and looked at the bodies of the Fragrant Butterfly women. "You had these innocent women killed. According to the law, how should you be punished?" he asked.
<br><br>
It had never occurred to the black bear that Zen would fire back with that.
<br><br>
His face darkened and he snorted disdainfully. "The City Guard House represents the law of the Myriad Spirits City. So what if I had these women killed?" he said with his head held high.
<br><br>
Zen sighed softly. "What you're saying is that the strongest around represents the law of the Myriad Spirits City. Am I understanding that correctly?"
<br><br>
"Exactly!" the black bear replied confidently.
<br><br>
"Really?" Zen said with a smirk cracking through. "If that's the case, then I'll represent the law here myself!"
<br><br>
Before the black bear could figure out his meaning, Zen had begun rushing straight towards him.
<br><br>
The black bear's green eyes widened when he saw Zen's terrifying speed.
<br><br>
Now he understood how the Ghost Scorpion had been killed by this human! But the Ghost Scorpion was underground creature of the Other Shore. He couldn't compete with the strength of the warriors of the City Guard House! The black bear roared ferociously and stretched out a pair of sharp claws, slamming them as he attacked Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's only choice was to retreat in order to prevent himself from being smashed into paste.
<br><br>
But retreating was not in Zen's nature. He continued rushing towards the black bear, and stretched his own hand out on either side, quick as a bolt of lightning, and clutched the black bear's claws.
<br><br>
"What is this?" The black bear's green eyes filled with panic for the first time.
<br><br>
Very few creatures within Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore were a match for him in terms of strength! But the grip of the human felt like he was being held down by two huge iron doors. He just couldn't move an inch from Zen's clutches.
<br><br>
"Turns out that around two thousand three hundred divine megatons of force is enough to represent the law of Myriad Spirits City..." Zen's words brimmed with disappointment.
<br><br>
The black bear gritted his teeth and suddenly lifted both his palms. Not letting go, Zen was hoisted up as well. The black bear turned and placed Zen in front of the mole crickets and roared, "Shoot him to death!"
<br><br>
The mole crickets were all elite archers of the City Guard House. Their Green Kylin Bows possessed incredible penetrating power. The black bear had expected that even with Zen's super might, he would not be able to dodge the fierce arrows.
<br><br>
The last syllable left the black bear's mouth and he was instantly petrified by what he saw.
<br><br>
The archers and their bows were all broken to pieces, brown blood flowing among them.
<br><br>
Stood beside the piles of fragments, wiping the long sword in her hand clean, was Elvinia. She stared at Zen and said, "Let me test the strength of the law of the Myriad Spirits City."
<br><br>
"Sure! Catch!"
<br><br>
Without a beat, Zen chucked the black bear with an Other Shore Power as strong as three thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
The black bear flew towards Elvinia.
<br><br>
Zen was unable to bring the Shade Stone liquid onto the Other Shore when he was at Stage Thirteen. His physical strength was extremely limited, and the power that erupted from his body was less than a thousand divine megatons. It was enough to defeat weak creatures like warriors from the Separate Abyss race, but in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen, such strength was far from enough.
<br><br>
Even the Snake Goddess herself probably wouldn't have guessed that the one who would gain the most from reaching the Chaotic Source Realm would be Zen! When Truth of Powerful Holy Body wasn't prohibited, Wild Gods could enhance their bodies with the help of the Body-strengthening Jade.
<br><br>
Truth of Powerful Holy Body was later banned and powerful warriors of the Source World could only rely on Chaotic Source Spirits to cultivate their bodies.
<br><br>
However, Zen had accidentally brought the Chaotic Source Spirits back to the Other Shore, leading to his abrupt increase in strength at Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Zen could now easily exert three thousand divine megatons of force after reaching the Chaotic Source Realm by relying on the Other Shore Power of Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
If Zen had had such strength in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen, he wouldn't have been that embarrassed, and he wouldn't have needed Elvinia's help to flee that place.
<br><br>
Chapter 3524 Greet Respectfully Just then, the black bear was sent into the air, feeling as if the world was spinning around him.
<br><br>
When he landed, he noticed that he was thrown near that delicate human girl. This excited the creature.
<br><br>
Sure, the human man who'd just thrown him into the air was powerful - but there was no way this measly girl could match him. The perfect prey, he thought.
<br><br>
What the black bear didn't know, was that the girl in his sight was Elvinia, who was frighteningly powerful even when only relying on her physical strength. If Zen hadn't relied on the Chaotic Source Spirits, he wouldn't even be a contender against Elvinia on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
A cold expression flashed in Elvinia's eyes. All of a sudden, she waved the sword in her hand. The hemline of her dress, which was made of light, fluttered and emphasized her gracious figure.
<br><br>
Her petite body burst out with immense power, and her skin appeared transparent enough to see the blueness in her veins.
<br><br>
"Chop!"
<br><br>
The treasures the Oneness Sky Palace had on Stage Fourteen were too weak, including the sword Elvinia was holding. How could it bear such a powerful strength? As Elvinia struck her sword, the blade broke into hundreds of fragments.
<br><br>
Just then, the moon-shaped sword radiance had managed to form. It wrapped around the fragments, and came straight towards the black bear! At first, the black bear was planning to keep the girl hostage and run away.
<br><br>
He had no idea that she actually had such immense power, power that proved to be a lot more intense than the man's.
<br><br>
At this point, the black bear was shocked and at the same time, confused about what was happening now.
<br><br>
How did these two humans appear in the first place? Phew! In one swift movement, the sword radiance Elvinia slashed out hit the black bear's chest with great precision, slicing him in half.
<br><br>
After the job had been done, she lightly tapped the ground and her body retreated instantly, making sure to avoid the black bear's body that was gushing out blood left and right.
<br><br>
The area around the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace was usually rowdy and noisy.
<br><br>
But at the sight of Elvinia's battle with the bear, the Other Shore creatures all grew silent, as if they had reached an agreement with each other.
<br><br>
On the circular terrace, the Souls of Light from the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Sun Crow race stood motionless and speechless. They felt bitterness fill their hearts.
<br><br>
"That Elvinia had entered the Chaotic Source World the same time as we did..."
<br><br>
"How in the world did she become so powerful when she just entered Stage Fourteen! There's no way her strength in the Source World can be stronger than mine!"
<br><br>
"What about the other human? The man named Thad? He's very likely to actually be Zen. Do you think he's stronger than you though?"
<br><br>
Some of these warriors had entered the Chaotic Source World with Zen and Elvinia, while some had been staying on Stage Fourteen for a long time, like those senior members of the Land of Sword Grief. They had heard about the battle between Zen and the Evil God, making them quite knowledgeable of his existence.
<br><br>
They were concerned if Zen would be finally killed or not. But to some other Other Shore creatures, now that Zen had killed the black bear, it probably meant something else.
<br><br>
There were many Other Shore races residing in the Myriad Spirits City. But there were only three forces that could actually control the city, namely the Dark Bear race, the Giants, and the Guide Weasel race. In the past, the Giants had taken absolute control in the Myriad Spirits City, but now, the powers were divided.
<br><br>
In recent years, the Dark Bear race suddenly rose in power. As they grew stronger and won a fierce battle, the City Guard House fell into their hands in the end. At this point, the leader of the Dark Bear race became the governor of the City Guard House, which made him almost the ruler of the whole Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
He said that he could represent the law of the Myriad Spirits City, and this was no lie.
<br><br>
If killing the Ghost Scorpion could cause a commotion underground in the northern part of the city, then the death of the governor would most probably shake the entire Myriad Spirits City! Not too far away, three members of the Guide Weasel race were filled with excitement, their eyes gleaming.
<br><br>
The Guide Weasel race had once been a large group on Stage Fourteen, but over the past years, they had struggled to defeat the Dark Bear race.
<br><br>
Squeak, squeak... "Look how the Dark Bear race lost today!"
<br><br>
"Humph! All these years, the Dark Bear race only won because they relied on the support from the upper stages! Now they definitely got what they deserved!"
<br><br>
"What should we do now?"
<br><br>
"Well, it seems like these two humans are very powerful, but they're just passing by Stage Fourteen. Maybe we should just support them! I will report to our leader! You two stay here!"
<br><br>
With a whooshing sound, one of the Guide Weasels rushed out. He transformed into a streak of light and disappeared at the corner of the street.
<br><br>
Aside from the Guide Weasel race, the other Other Shore races also began to move.
<br><br>
The news of the City Guard House's defeat spread out quickly all throughout the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Zen took a look at the wooden building, then turned towards the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
"This building is too shabby to be the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace," he told them with much concern. "Do you have any suggestions about where we can find a better place?"
<br><br>
At this point, the Ear Mice were all very giddy. Since the governor of the City Guard House was dead, it put an end to the Dark Bear race's rule over the Myriad Spirits City. Hence, they would all embrace a new era from today.
<br><br>
"This place really isn't fit for the Oneness Sky Palace!" an Ear Mouse responded respectfully. "I might know a place that could be perfect." The Ear Mouse smiled, glad that it could help Zen.
<br><br>
"Well then, please lead the way," Zen said, gesturing towards the Ear Mouse with his hand.
<br><br>
"If you two would prefer it, you may take rides on the giant mice!" an Ear Mouse offered in delight.
<br><br>
A free ride was so tempting that Zen and Elvinia couldn't refuse. They leapt onto the giant mice and rode them like horses.
<br><br>
Though the two giant mice seemed ferocious, they were trained very well by the Ear Mice. They carried the two humans with utmost caution as they walked steadily out of the small path. Eventually, the group had walked along the widest road in the Myriad Spirits City and reached the end.
<br><br>
Because there were countless races in the city, no matter who was appointed the lord of the city, it would cause a quarrel among the many large races on the Other Shore. There was no pleasing everyone. Eventually, they had come up with a compromise and accepted the system of the City Guard House. And in fact, the governor of the City Guard House was the lord of the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
The reason why the black bear was able to rule the City Guard House was because he relied mostly on his powerful strength and continuous support from upper stages on the Other Shore. Without these advantages, the Dark Bear race were nothing.
<br><br>
As Zen and Elvinia headed towards the City Guard House, the forces in the Myriad Spirits City could hardly sit still.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Ear Mice had completely taken over the underground cave in the northern area of the city.
<br><br>
This was possible only through force. The Ear Mice got rid of all the creatures that tried to resist, like the Tail Insect race and the other scorpions.
<br><br>
With the help of the giant mice and other mice that had very strong combat abilities in the Myriad Spirits City, they were able to successfully take over the place. Once the Ghost Scorpion died, his subordinates were just a group of weaklings.
<br><br>
The stench of blood and rottenness filled the entire underground world in the north of the city. At this point, the Ear Mice had plundered all the savings of the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
When the Dark Bear race had learned that their leader was murdered, they quickly reacted. They even started to gather the strong warriors of their race to go against Zen and Elvinia. But before they could set out, they were killed by the joint attack of the Giants and the Guide Weasel race. Even the members of the Dark Bear race that guarded the City Guard House had been slaughtered.
<br><br>
So when Zen and Elvinia arrived at the entrance of the City Guard House riding on the giant mice, the members of the Guide Weasel race were already there, all lined up to greet them respectfully. The stench of blood still permeated the air.
<br><br>
Chapter 3525 The City Guard House The Myriad Spirits City was an ancient city rich in history which included several hundreds of chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Whereas the City Guard House's opulence wouldn't be anything worth mentioning in the Source World, it was considered to be quite a rare sight on the Other Shore. Neither the Stage Four temples nor the Stage Thirteen strongholds could hold a candle to it.
<br><br>
The Guide Weasel race was known for its intelligence. Once they confirmed that the former city lord was killed, they wasted no time in allying with the Giants to eradicate the Dark Bear race once and for all.
<br><br>
However, they didn't dare to steal any of the resources that were kept at the City Guard House upon successfully occupying it.
<br><br>
They focused on their main goal — controlling the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
They knew that Zen and the Oneness Sky Palace he was representing wouldn't remain in Stage Fourteen. Therefore, there was no need for offending them.
<br><br>
That was why the Guide Weasel race was willing to surrender the City Guard House to Zen with utmost sincerity.
<br><br>
"This dress...it won't fit me."
<br><br>
"Nor will this one..."
<br><br>
"And this one..."
<br><br>
Elvinia complained as she picked and chose from a pile of clothing. Ever since her trip to the Dark Region, she had always robed herself with lightformed attire that couldn't exactly be considered material. She wasn't like Zen whose vague shape could be barely recognized even if he was naked.
<br><br>
Although she'd already become more skilled in controlling the Great Sanskrit Light and the garb she created for herself was enough to cover her decently, she always wanted to find a better solution.
<br><br>
There were also some women of the Fragrant Butterfly race living in the City Guard House, and they had many clothes.
<br><br>
The only problem was that they were too unsuitable and revealing for her taste. After taking her time going through her options, she finally gave up.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, Princess Elvinia! We'll ask the servants to tailor dresses for you immediately. It'll only take half a day!" a member of the Guide Weasel race offered before he hurriedly left to give orders.
<br><br>
As she threw the revealing clothes onto the floor, Elvinia walked out of the room and headed towards the backyard.
<br><br>
There, a myriad of weapons was lined up in an orderly fashion on the ground.
<br><br>
As Zen scanned through them, disappointment clouded his eyes.
<br><br>
"Theoretically," he began to speak, "some of the races residing on the Other Shore descended from those ancient civilizations of the chaos. They must have brought with them their best treasures when they fled to the Other Shore. So what on earth are these useless scraps we've found here in Stage Fourteen?"
<br><br>
From Zen's perspective, these were nothing but mere scraps of metal. The only ones that provided any real value were the Green Kylin Bows used by the mole crickets. Supposedly, these were specially made with carefully selected materials by the mole crickets.
<br><br>
Zen believed that there were many legendary weapons like the Soaring Snake Sword in the past. To his disappointment, he failed to find any of them in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Because the Guide Weasel race was indigenous to the Other Shore, they hardly knew anything about the chaos and so they couldn't answer any of Zen's questions.
<br><br>
An Ear Mouse moved forward and answered on their behalf, "As far as I know, the legendary weapons were obtained only by the most powerful masters. Since they've gone on to the higher stages, it'd be impossible to keep them in Stage Fourteen."
<br><br>
"That's right," another Ear Mouse agreed.
<br><br>
Zen nodded to confirm that he heard them. He never thought getting a decent sword in Stage Fourteen would be this difficult.
<br><br>
As he leaned forward to pick up a thin sword to test its weight, Elvinia arrived. He grinned at her before throwing the sword towards her.
<br><br>
She swiftly caught and brandished it before snapping it in half with ease.
<br><br>
"Well," she said with a smile across her face, "I guess that sword was too fragile for me to wield!"
<br><br>
A look of disbelief fell on the faces of the Guide Weasels that witnessed this scene. 'Is she aware of the true extent of her power?' they thought to themselves.
<br><br>
"Are we ever going to find swords that are good enough for us here at Stage Fourteen?" Elvinia grumbled, sounding depressed.
<br><br>
A member of the Guide Weasel race hesitated for a moment before saying, "In fact, the Riverside race are very famous weapon refiners who have forged many excellent weapons. However, they all moved to the Sky Water City a few hundred years ago..."
<br><br>
"The Sky Water City... Isn't it the city of the Star Falcon race?" Zen muttered.
<br><br>
He knew the Ghost Scorpion — along with the black bear — was asking for trouble under the order of the Star Falcon race.
<br><br>
Both the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race were determined on killing him, their hostility evident in their revenge which knew no bounds.
<br><br>
However, Zen didn't feel worried at all. He suspected that it wouldn't be long before the members of the Star Falcon race themselves would arrive and bring all this chaos upon themselves.
<br><br>
"Forget it. My friends are still waiting in the Source World. It's time for them to return to the Other Shore," Zen informed with a grin.
<br><br>
The Land of Sword Grief was currently full of lower-ranked disciples who were panicking.
<br><br>
Things were just fine for those on the second and third floors who usually stayed in the higher stages of the Other Shore and didn't need to return to Stage Fourteen so frequently.
<br><br>
But it was a different story for the disciples on the first floor. Most of them just started their adventure in the Desire World. Their stronghold in Stage Fourteen served as a gathering place just like the Stage Four temples.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, with the new disciples' arrival at Stage Fourteen, a massive conflict between them and the Other Shore creatures came.
<br><br>
"It's all the newcomers' fault!"
<br><br>
"Why did they have to provoke the Other Shore creatures when they didn't have the power? Now I'll have to remain in Stage Fifteen. I can't go back to the stronghold now!"
<br><br>
"You've got better luck than me. I was right outside a Stage Fourteen temple when I left. How will I be able to return to the Myriad Spirits City? I'll certainly be arrested once I arrive at the city gate…"
<br><br>
"Don't blame the other new disciples. We all know that Zen and Princess Elvinia are the ones to blame. It's them you should be confronting regarding all of this — if you have the guts, that is."
<br><br>
Zen reached the top of the Ranking Stone on the first floor in only one day.
<br><br>
None of these people would have the ability to challenge him. As for Elvinia, who would dare to confront her, considering her high status? "I just want to know how those two are doing," Abdul sighed.
<br><br>
Previously, he had been angry with the two of them, but Zen and Elvinia were still members of the Oneness Sky Palace. Though they had physical bodies on the Other Shore, Abdul couldn't help but wonder if they were strong enough to face the creatures of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Many of the new disciples stood aside and said nothing.
<br><br>
Soon, the deep and heavy feeling in the room became too much to bear.
<br><br>
Chaim finally gave in and exclaimed, "Stop worrying! Have some faith in Zen and Princess Elvinia, will you?"
<br><br>
"That's right. Princess Elvinia can also be considered an Other Shore creature, right? I'm sure defeating them will be no problem for her," Milo added in agreement with Chaim.
<br><br>
Abdul sneered and said, "Before the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was banned, taking on the physical form while roaming the Other Shore was considered common. However, hardly anyone could defeat those Other Shore creatures as soon as they reached Stage Fourteen!"
<br><br>
It was no easy feat to improve one's physical form on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was never a wise decision for any new-comer in Stage Fourteen to become an enemy of the Other Shore creatures. It wasn't difficult to kill an ordinary Tail Insect, but the consequences would be unimaginably terrible once the Ghost Scorpion was involved.
<br><br>
Chapter 3526 Confused While the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief sulked, the door of one of the training rooms suddenly opened. Looking up, they saw Elvinia walk out with grace.
<br><br>
Though Elvina was someone with special status, her room in the Land of Sword Grief was still in accordance with her ranking.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia?"
<br><br>
"She came out!"
<br><br>
"Did she manage to escape?"
<br><br>
For the senior disciples on the first floor, Elvinia was doomed the moment she agreed to face against the Ghost Scorpion. However, she could still escape since she wasn't obstructed by the Soul Binding Thread. She could definitely run away at such a critical time.
<br><br>
Abdul stepped forward and respectfully cupped his hands. "Princess Elvinia, how are things going in the Myriad Spirits City?"
<br><br>
She gave him a cold glare. "Everything is fine. Zen just asked me to inform you all that it's safe to go back to the stronghold now."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"We can go back?"
<br><br>
"How is the Ghost Scorpion?"
<br><br>
Elvinia retained her aloofness and refused to answer any of their questions.
<br><br>
The only person she was really nice to was Zen and that wasn't going to change anytime soon.
<br><br>
With her message delivered, Elvinia turned around and made her way back, making sure to slam the door in her wake.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia!"
<br><br>
"Just what on earth happened in the Myriad Spirits City?"
<br><br>
The disciples continued to hurl their questions at her despite her departure.
<br><br>
No matter how loud they shouted though, Elvinia did not answer them, preferring solitude in her training room.
<br><br>
Now they were even more confused.
<br><br>
"What should we do?" someone asked. Another disciple shrugged in noncommittal reply.
<br><br>
Could they really trust Elvinia's words? What if it turned out that the situation in Myriad Spirits City hadn't been dealt with? Entering the Other Shore rashly could then lead to serious consequences. It would be like courting death! Chaim, however, had already been convinced. "Since Princess Elvinia said it's been solved, then I guess we can go back now."
<br><br>
Milo nodded in agreement. "I believe her too!"
<br><br>
"Really? What if Zen was captured and tied by the Ghost Scorpion who then threatened Elvinia to lure us back to the Other Shore?" Abdul muttered in panic.
<br><br>
It was a bit far-fetched but nobody refuted what he said.
<br><br>
Everything was possible and it was their lives that were on the line here.
<br><br>
"I can go back first and assess the situation for you guys if you want,"
<br><br>
Dorothy offered.
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes landed on her.
<br><br>
"I'll go with you!" Chaim said.
<br><br>
"There's nothing to be afraid of," Milo told them.
<br><br>
Several warriors had a good relationship with Zen and trusted him unconditionally. They believed that he would never let them walk into such a dangerous trap.
<br><br>
Dorothy followed through with her offer, sitting down and leaning against the wall of the bronze palace. When she was about to enter the Other Shore, Abdul suddenly arrived to stop her. "Don't do it! Look, Dorothy, you're young and noble. I'm not going to let you take the risk."
<br><br>
He exchanged a look with Chaim who only nodded.
<br><br>
Both Dorothy and Elvinia had special status. If anything bad happened to them, it would mean great trouble for the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
To Abdul, there was only one person who could enter the Other Shore and check the situation.
<br><br>
That look was enough to tell Chaim all that Abdul wanted to say.
<br><br>
"I'll go first then," Chaim said.
<br><br>
Like Dorothy, Chaim made himself comfortable while sitting on the ground before activating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Chaim was once again back on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
He made his way into the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold and found nothing.
<br><br>
There was only a little bloodstain on the outside path.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
Just as he was racking his brains for an answer, someone asked, "You are the disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace, aren't you?"
<br><br>
When Chaim turned, he found a giant mouse standing not far away from him. On the back of the giant mouse sat a Soul of Light of an Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
Chaim recognized the Ear Mouse's Soul of Light immediately, having seen them in the Chaotic Source World before. "Yes. Do you know what happened here?"
<br><br>
"Why did you come here alone? Where are the other disciples?" the Ear Mouse asked, not really answering his question.
<br><br>
Zen told the Ear Mouse that there were over one hundred new disciples it would have to bring to the City Guard House.
<br><br>
Chaim felt a bit embarrassed to tell the Ear Mouse that nobody wanted to come to the Other Shore since they were scared, so he settled for a little white lie. "They'll be here soon. Let me just go back and get them."
<br><br>
He left the Other Share with some urgency.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Abdul and the others kept staring at Chaim's body with bated breath, scared that he would suddenly drop dead at any moment.
<br><br>
They all breathed a sigh of relief when he finally opened his eyes.
<br><br>
"Chaim!" they exclaimed once he got back. "How was the situation?"
<br><br>
Abdul asked.
<br><br>
"It's alright. There was nothing except bloodstains on the ground."
<br><br>
"What about Zen and Princess Elvinia?" Abdul continued.
<br><br>
Dorothy's eyes flickered in fear. She wholeheartedly believed in Zen but she couldn't help but be worried for him.
<br><br>
"I didn't see them. There was an Ear Mouse waiting at the scene though and it told me to bring everyone back to the Other Shore," Chaim replied, narrating to everyone what he saw.
<br><br>
His news was met with confusion. It didn't really tell them what happened in the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
"You don't have to go in if you're afraid. The new disciples can go with me to the Other Shore. I promise everything will be fine," Chaim assured everyone before entering the Other Shore once more.
<br><br>
The aforementioned new disciples knew Zen and had confidence in him They readily followed Chaim to the Other Shore, believing him wholeheartedly.
<br><br>
Abdul could only sigh in resignation. It was a risk but it seemed they were going to have to take it. He turned to the others. "Let's go!"
<br><br>
Judging from his tone, it was evident that he was ready to risk everything.
<br><br>
The senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief followed, sitting crosslegged in order to enter the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
More and more Souls of Light appeared within the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold as everyone arrived.
<br><br>
Abdul was the first to walk out the stronghold and saw the Ear Mouse Chaim had mentioned earlier.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse let out a squeak as it regarded the new arrivals. "It seems everyone has arrived safely. Please come with me!"
<br><br>
Abdul's brows furrowed in confusion. "Come with you?" he repeated.
<br><br>
"Where?" However, the Ear Mouse wasn't going to give him a straight answer.
<br><br>
"You'll know when we get there."
<br><br>
There wasn't anything abnormal in front of the stronghold but Abdul and the senior disciples couldn't help but remain uneasy with their surroundings.
<br><br>
Then again, the moment Abdul decided to come back here, he had already decided to risk everything. Thus, he followed the Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
If something bad burst out suddenly, then Abdul was ready to get out of the Other Shore and never venture into it ever again.
<br><br>
The senior disciples followed Abdul's lead, walking out of the small path and heading towards the wide road.
<br><br>
Unbeknown to them, the shocking news of what had taken place in the Myriad Spirits City already spread like wildfire.
<br><br>
The matter about the Oneness Sky Palace was made known to the many races of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
As the human Souls of Light traversed the road, they were not met with the usual scorn or contempt. Instead, the races of the Other Shore treated them with a hint of reverence.
<br><br>
Chapter 3527 Sitting On The Top "Abdul, what's wrong with those Other Shore creatures? Why are they staring at us like that?" a senior disciple from the Land of Sword Grief asked in a low register, feeling uncomfortable under the gaze.
<br><br>
But even Abdul was baffled.
<br><br>
Normally, they had to be extra careful when going in and out of the Myriad Spirits City. The Other Shore creatures had always been arrogant, given their great strength. Usually, they only had contempt in their eyes upon seeing them.
<br><br>
But today, their eyes were completely different—it was as though there was even some kind of awe in them.
<br><br>
Were they suddenly afraid of the Souls of Light? Abdul and his companions had yet to realize that it wasn't the Souls of Light they were afraid of.
<br><br>
They would soon find out that they acted like this because Zen and Elvinia had occupied the City Guard House.
<br><br>
On the way there, everyone was feeling quite uneasy.
<br><br>
Soon, they reached the end of the road at the gate of a magnificent building.
<br><br>
"The City Guard House?"
<br><br>
Abdul was rather stunned as he stood in front of the structure.
<br><br>
"Has Zen provoked the members of the City Guard House? Were we brought here for them to kill?" A worried voice came from one of the senior disciples.
<br><br>
For a moment, Abdul was about to agree to the thought, but on second thought, he realized that it wasn't a very logical conclusion.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace was known to always follow the rules. They even paid their tributes to the city guards every year—it was highly unlikely for them to have provoked the people of the City Guard House. Besides, Zen was standing up against the Ghost Scorpion, who had always been at odds with the City Guard House, anyway.
<br><br>
'Could the City Guard House have saved Zen and Princess Elvinia?' Abdul wondered after giving it a thought.
<br><br>
After thinking it through, he shared the possibility with those around him.
<br><br>
"That must be the case! The City Guard House has always wanted to kill the Ghost Scorpion, hasn't it? But the creature has always been hiding in the underground in the north of the city. When he attacked Zen and alerted the City Guard House, they must have taken the chance to kill him!"
<br><br>
"Zen is so lucky!"
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, a warrior beside him suddenly chimed in, "But even if the City Guard House killed the Ghost Scorpion, why would they invite us here?"
<br><br>
Now, Abdul was stumped.
<br><br>
The City Guard House had real control of the Myriad Spirits City—they normally paid no mind to the Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
What could have gotten them invited to the City Guard House? "Don't think too much. The City Guard House won't kill recklessly like the Ghost Scorpion anyway!" Unable to figure it out, Abdul ended up dropping it.
<br><br>
They then entered the city lord's mansion.
<br><br>
On either side of the mansion stood a dozen Giants, motionless like iron towers.
<br><br>
As the group continued moving forward, they saw the members of the Guide Weasel race standing on both sides.
<br><br>
All these Other Shore creatures were the elites of their races. Their very aura was strong, especially coupled with their fierce and bold appearance.
<br><br>
Normally, they were considered mighty warriors of the Myriad Spirits City, but at this moment, they were merely serving as guards of the City Guard House.
<br><br>
The grand scene before them had Abdul and the rest rather frightened, doubt growing within them. While the City Guard House had always been controlled by the Dark Bear race, they hadn't spotted any of them.
<br><br>
Entering the main hall, Abdul looked up at the very top of the hall. Just as he got ready to bow, his entire body froze still.
<br><br>
The other senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were also dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Sitting upright on the very top of the main hall was none other than Zen.
<br><br>
Beside him was Elvinia, wearing a bored expression. In front of her was a long, black table that had various dishes and fruits—it was a feast. She picked up a fruit and popped it in her mouth, staring at Abdul and the rest with cold eyes.
<br><br>
"Princess… Princess Elvinia!"
<br><br>
Finally, Abdul managed to call her name with great respect. It had taken a minute for him to come back to his senses.
<br><br>
Although Elvinia held special status, the warriors in the Land of Sword Grief were also arrogant and proud in front of her. They paid their respects to her merely because of her noble birth. But the way Abdul had just addressed her seemed genuine.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand… Although they couldn't quite see all his features, they were sure that it was Zen sitting there. They could hardly believe it! How could he take that seat? Only the governor of the City Guard House, one who controlled the Myriad Spirits City, was qualified to sit on that chair.
<br><br>
"Everyone, don't be so stiff," Zen said with an easy smile.
<br><br>
"Z-zen, what's going on?" In his confusion, Abdul managed to ask.
<br><br>
"Nothing," Elvinia said simply as she stuffed a dark-red fruit into her mouth. Her mouth crushed the cold, soft pulp, making a faint, fruity fragrance. The food on the Other Shore might not be much better than that in the Source World, but it sure had a unique taste. "We have killed the Ghost Scorpion, and the City Guard House has arrived to give us some trouble. I guess the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race are behind this."
<br><br>
"The City Guard House came with trouble?"
<br><br>
Abdul and the rest could feel their hearts tremble in their shock.
<br><br>
"But we've also killed the governor of the City Guard House, so this place now belongs to us," Elvinia added nonchalantly.
<br><br>
This didn't bother many of the newcomers—it was their first time in the Desire World, after all. They couldn't yet fathom how fierce the fights among the Other Shore creatures were.
<br><br>
But Abdul and the other senior disciples were clearly baffled by Elvinia's casual remarks.
<br><br>
On their way there, a strange feeling had already come over them. Now, thinking about how the Other Shore creatures looked at them in awe, they realized that those eyes were not for them, but for Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
"So this City Guard House belongs to us now?" Chaim had a smile coming on as he asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, this will be the new stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace. That old wooden building was far too shabby," Zen said pleasantly. "So, you don't need to feel restrained here!"
<br><br>
The new disciples finally sighed in relief.
<br><br>
Zen could ensure their safety, anyway. It was a good thing that this place had become the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold.
<br><br>
Abdul and the other senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, however, still felt like they were in a dream.
<br><br>
Just then, an Ear Mouse stepped into the main hall of the City Guard House and bowed to Zen, who remained sitting at the very top. "The savings of the Ghost Scorpion have all been recorded—there are five hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal, five hundred and twenty Body-strengthening Jades and twenty thousand soul pills! Apart from that…"
<br><br>
For so many years, the Ghost Scorpion had occupied the northern part of the city—of course, he had accumulated many things. Once the Ghost Scorpion died, his subordinates took many things away from his lair when they fled, but a good portion of things was still left underground. The Ear Mice also moved quite fast—within an hour after the Ghost Scorpion died, they had already made their way into the underground of the northern part of the city, plundering all the remaining treasures.
<br><br>
The amount of savings reported by the Ear Mouse had everyone shocked, save for Zen, who merely waved his hand and said, "You don't have to report every detail. All these things will be shared equally between your race and our Oneness Sky Palace."
<br><br>
"Shared equally?!" Abdul exclaimed in shock. The Ghost Scorpion's legacy was so great that half of it was already amazing. And to think that Zen easily gave that half to the Ear Mice, Abdul couldn't help but stammer, "Zzen… since you are the one who killed the Ghost Scorpion, his legacy naturally belongs to you, as well as the Land of Sword Grief... It doesn't make sense for you to share it with the Ear Mice like this…it's beyond generous."

After all, it had existed longer than the present round of chaos.
<br><br>
Both Flamine and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had travelled across the Desire World and passed by the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
They were rather weak during that time. They faced much more powerful beings from the Other Shore and had to swallow all the insults and live in silence, just like other feeble creatures.
<br><br>
Therefore, they had never thought that Zen and Elvinia would've occupied the Myriad Spirits City as soon as they entered the Desire World.
<br><br>
"Those two youngsters are more ambitious than I was," Eastern Emperor Taiyi mused with a faint smile.
<br><br>
Flamine blinked a few times before she anxiously said, "The Element Spirit race is currently the dominant race on the Other Shore, while many races from the Source World such as the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race control the different stages of the Other Shore, respectively. Since Elvinia and Zen did such big acts, I'm afraid those races would take revenge on them."
<br><br>
"Hmph! Even if they didn't commit such acts, they still might be attacked,"
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi said coldly. "I'm only afraid that the ruler of Stage Fourteenth of the Other Shore would do something against Elvinia. I'm not afraid of anything else."
<br><br>
Without a doubt, Elvinia's successful rise into the Desire World was great news for the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
After all, a purified being who could grow was terrifying.
<br><br>
The Bearing race and the Sun Crow race would definitely regard her as a thorn in their flesh. With her strength as a purified being, however, she had no reason to be afraid of ordinary creatures on the Other Shore, or even powerful creatures in the Dark Region. She could easily melt all of them with her Great Sanskrit Light.
<br><br>
Yet, there was a ruler in charge of the Dark Region in each stage, starting from Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. It would be rather troublesome if Elvinia confronted such a ruler.
<br><br>
"So, I'll send a message to the two young ones and tell them to be careful,"
<br><br>
said Flamine with a nod.
<br><br>
"Alright," Eastern Emperor Taiyi agreed as his eyes glimmered with deep light. "Now, it's almost time to have a showdown. I hope that they can both grow up quickly and rise to a higher stage. In that case, maybe they can help the Oneness Sky Palace."
<br><br>
A smile graced Flamine's face. "They will definitely be able to help the Oneness Sky Palace. As of now, Elvinia has reached the suitable age for marriage. Your Majesty, will you arrange a marriage for her?" she said.
<br><br>
It could be said that Elvinia had become a purified being because of Zen.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he was in no way inferior to Elvinia's potential on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi still hadn't figured out how Zen had sent his corporeal body to the Other Shore, until now.
<br><br>
Apparently, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had secretly observed Zen. He had faintly sensed the unique Truth of Godly Way from Zen's body, but he had never felt such an aura of the Truth of Godly Way from anybody else. Thus, he couldn't find any clue at all.
<br><br>
"Haven't I told you? Everybody has his or her destined mate. Now that Zen already has wives and a child, how can he satisfy Elvinia?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked back.
<br><br>
"I had a long talk with Elvinia after she got back from the Chaotic Source World. I'm sure she's satisfied with Zen. As her mother, of course I have to help her on the matter.
<br><br>
We don't need to attach so much importance to her status, but..." "But what?" asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
"I've heard that the old lady's granddaughter also likes Zen. I'm afraid..."
<br><br>
Flamine calmly explained, her lips curving into a slight frown.
<br><br>
Yasamin was a powerful figure who was second only to Eastern Emperor Taiyi in the Oneness Sky Palace. She, however, had a strange temper. Only a few people from the other mountains liked her. Moreover, they had a conflict last time when they were in the Vastness Mountain. That instance made Flamine dislike Yasamin even more.
<br><br>
"You mean Dorothy?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi questioned. There was an instance when Yasamin had mentioned some of Dorothy's secrets to Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
She had painstakingly cultivated and raised Dorothy for many years, who was considered as the apple of her eye.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi always had a headache at the thought of the stubborn Yasamin.
<br><br>
"I'll find a chance to sound out Yasamin's opinion," said Eastern Emperor Taiyi with a wry smile. He had never thought that his outstanding daughter would have to compete with another girl for a husband.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Land of Sword Grief had been peaceful for a few days. All the disciples struggled to contain their uncontrollable excitement.
<br><br>
"Our Oneness Sky Palace can finally hold our heads high on the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
"Occupying a large city is really something I had never dared to think of!"
<br><br>
"You guys on the second floor! Do you want to come down and have a look? Hahaha..."
<br><br>
The last comment didn't actually mean to go down from the second floor to the first floor, but rather from the higher stages of the Other Shore to Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Although many disciples on the first floor had nothing to do with occupying the Myriad Spirits City, they still felt honored.
<br><br>
Many of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace scurried back from Stage Fifteen, Stage Sixteen, and even Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. They all wanted to witness the grand occasion in the Myriad Spirits City. At the same time, Zen was so generous that he intended to distribute a part of what he had gained among the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace Previously, Zen knew that he could get more resources and support from the Oneness Sky Palace after he entered the Land of Sword Grief. And, he understood that many disciples had contributed to those resources.
<br><br>
Although he didn't like what Abdul had said, he still thought that he had to give something in return after he had stayed in the Oneness Sky Palace for a long time.
<br><br>
Once he had finished his tasks, he moved his soul to the Myriad Spirits City. Then, he went on a short-term seclusion after he had exited the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Even though he had shown his mighty strength in the Myriad Spirits City, he clearly knew that the Other Shore was definitely not as simple as it looked.
<br><br>
The creatures in the Light Region might not compare to him and Elvinia, but what about those in the Dark Region? Besides, there might be another purified being in the Dark Region in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Therefore, the purpose of his cultivation in seclusion this time was to refine the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed he had acquired from the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
In the secluded cultivation room, Zen held in his palm the seed that emitted blue light.
<br><br>
"If I refine the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, will Chiyou's bloodline disappear completely?" he asked No. 9527 with a bit of hesitation. He simply wanted to obtain more blood of the Chaos Ancient God in order to become stronger, but he was still a member of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
If he eliminated all traces of his original bloodline, then he would no longer have any blood connection with the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
"Hey, there's nothing to worry about! The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed will not change your bloodline. It can only copy blood. When you have copied enough blood of my master, the sclerite on your chest will continue to grow. You can store the extra blood in the sclerite," No. 9527 answered.
<br><br>
"The sclerite..."
<br><br>
When Zen had merged with the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline for the first time, a sclerite started to grow on his chest. No. 9527 had previously hid inside the sclerite, and the Truth Crystal had come out from it as well.
<br><br>
Since then, he had never had the chance to procure any more blood of the Chaos Ancient God, so the sclerite didn't grow.
<br><br>
Now that it was unnecessary for him to worry about his original bloodline, he didn't hesitate anymore.
<br><br>
He gently tossed the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed and made it float in front of his chest. He then put his palms over his chest, which activated the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline. Green light gathered around his hands, and a Truth Crystal gradually took shape.
<br><br>
It wasn't difficult for him to refine the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. The Snake Goddess had simply given him some instructions, which he had always kept in mind.
<br><br>
Chapter 3530 Transformation As the Truth Crystal turned solid, Zen waved his hand at it. It began to dissipate into a green eddy.
<br><br>
Zen gently hooked one of his fingers, then it turned into a stream of energy and dashed toward the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed.
<br><br>
There were six cracks on the surface of the seed, hence the name. The energy merged with the seed, slowly seeping through the cracks and flowing into the seed.
<br><br>
The azure blue light of the seed gradually faded, replaced by a cyan green light. The seed now contained the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God! "The power of the bloodline is so strong." Zen's eyes showed a hint of surprise.
<br><br>
It was no wonder the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed was extremely precious in the Source World. Any bloodline could be directly copied by the seed once it was absorbed. It was a truly amazing ability.
<br><br>
"What a fascinating object!" exclaimed No. 9527.
<br><br>
Zen reached out his hand and pointed at the seed. At this, the seed promptly darted straight into his open mouth.
<br><br>
It felt strange to swallow the seed after the bloodline had fused into it. But Zen just followed what the Snake Goddess told him to do.
<br><br>
At first, nothing happened after Zen swallowed the seed. But soon, he felt a sharp pain in his stomach.
<br><br>
Zen could see that the seed had unfurled in his belly. In the middle of the seed, a green ball of light had started to glow. Each time a beam of light burst out, he felt a burst of sharp pain.
<br><br>
The green light was the power of Gerald's bloodline.
<br><br>
The power of the bloodline soon seeped into Zen's internal organs. It flowed, almost consciously, along the meridians in his body, gathering in his chest. A small sclerite began to grow out from the area.
<br><br>
"The second sclerite!"
<br><br>
As No. 9527 said this, more sclerites started to grow on Zen's chest, as more of Gerald's bloodline gathered there.
<br><br>
The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed allowed one to inherit all the power of the bloodline from the previous generation, just like Zen and Yan inherited the bloodlines of Chiyou and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Thus, Zen was inheriting the complete power of the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline! The pain in his stomach grew more intense as the power continued to flow through his internal organs and gather at his chest. The third sclerite started to grow! The sclerites emerged one by one from Zen's chest, down to his lower ribs.
<br><br>
Then they started to grow at his waist.
<br><br>
Ten sclerites.
<br><br>
Twenty.
<br><br>
Thirty.
<br><br>
The sclerites started to emerge from his spine, going up until they grew around his neck.
<br><br>
The sclerites cut through Zen's insides, causing immense pain. But he was able to tolerate it. Through the whole ordeal, Zen kept a poker face.
<br><br>
A flicker of fear crossed his features, however, as the sclerites started to grow in his head.
<br><br>
He was used to seeing strange appendages on a human body, but the head was the most vital part. An accident could cause irreversible damage. If these sclerites damaged his head, it could destroy him.
<br><br>
"Don't be afraid. This is just what happens when you absorb a bloodline.
<br><br>
Just remember even the bloodline of Chiyou could not hurt you, let alone these sclerites," No. 9527 said, encouragingly.
<br><br>
He was right. Zen once had three heads and six arms, and it did not cause any damage to his body. They grew quite naturally.
<br><br>
Realizing this, Zen stopped worrying. He calmed down and let the sclerites grow in his head! The sclerites grew in a manner so precise that although they cut through his flesh and skull, they avoided all the vital parts, therefore not causing any substantial damage. With Zen's strong ability to recover, the ruptured flesh quickly healed and wrapped around the new sclerites.
<br><br>
After the sclerites had emerged in Zen's head, the sclerites in his arms and legs started to grow.
<br><br>
An hour later, the green light of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed finally dimmed. The sclerites also stopped growing.
<br><br>
"There are eight hundred and sixty-one sclerites in total,"
<br><br>
Zen counted, using his inner vision.
<br><br>
He stood up and tried to move his body, but almost instantly fell to the ground. These new sclerites still felt strange and uncomfortable.
<br><br>
"You'll feel better once you get used to them. These sclerites have greatly enhanced your body," No. 9527 remarked.
<br><br>
Zen suddenly remembered how, in the Chaotic Source World, Mount was so powerful, almost invincible. Even the Evil God, who had absorbed the power of many bloodlines, was unable to kill him. Mount had the power of the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline, and his body was strong enough to match a warrior in the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
He was a human being on the outside, but the structure inside his body was totally different from normal people. Now Zen was just like him! Zen walked back and forth in the cultivation room, adjusting to his new body structure. Soon enough, he began to grow accustomed to it. He started to run and jump. He adapted very quickly. It wasn't long before he was using those sclerites as if he was born with them.
<br><br>
"The sclerites on both sides of the stomach protect the elixir field well."
<br><br>
"Those on the legs bring greater support, boosting the legs' power."
<br><br>
"Interesting! These sclerites did not grow randomly, but in a way that perfectly enhanced my body."
<br><br>
Zen stopped moving with a satisfied look on his face.
<br><br>
"Of course! My master is perfect. Otherwise, he would not have made it from the last chaos to this one," No. 9527 pointed out, matter-of-factly.
<br><br>
"I want to try the truth-level theurgy."
<br><br>
Zen stretched his arms, and the eight hundred and sixty-one new sclerites inside his body responded accordingly.
<br><br>
The power of a single Truth Crystal was indeed not enough. But Zen was now able to mobilize all the sclerites in his body. His entire body was filled with the bloodline from the Chaos Ancient God. He was no longer the same as before.
<br><br>
"Wait!"
<br><br>
Before No. 9257 could stop him, Zen already activated all the sclerites. A strange scene unfolded.
<br><br>
Chapter 3531 The Other Shore Key All of the golden blood around Zen's body started to circulate, and the sclerites continued to unfold. His hands instantly became much thicker and stronger. The sclerites on his back broke through his skin, turning into sharp thorns.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the sclerite at the end of his backbone spread out completely and extended into a strong tail.
<br><br>
The tail was similar to that of the Ghost Scorpion on the Other Shore. There was even a black needle embedded on its end! "What happened to me? Why did I change into this?" he complained. He awkwardly stood there like a fool as he observed the changes in his body.
<br><br>
On the other hand, No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit were used to the change of form. After all, they knew that the physical body was just a vessel.
<br><br>
Zen, however, was still unable to accept it at the moment. If he had three heads and six arms, at least he maintained the human shape, but now he was like a monster.
<br><br>
"It's normal to change into the form of the Chaos Ancient God. Don't forget that my master, Gerald, is actually a huge scorpion. In the last round of chaos, he belonged to the Spiritual Scorpion Civilization," No. 9527 comforted him.
<br><br>
Zen had previously seen Gerald's initial appearance in the illusion created by the Snake Goddess, which was in the form of a huge scorpion. Still, he didn't expect himself to turn into a scorpion.
<br><br>
He thought for a while, and then a helpless smile graced his lips. "You are right. I will not show my strange appearance in front of others!" he declared.
<br><br>
He unfolded his hands again, and the green vortex began to gather between his thick palms.
<br><br>
Square Truth Crystals appeared between his hands and quickly accumulated in the vortex. As he placed his hands above his head, a bright green star was formed.
<br><br>
Despite his efforts to suppress it, it was already a thousand times more powerful than the previous Falling Star Palm. If the star fell, the training room would probably be destroyed completely. Thus, he was careful not to drop it.
<br><br>
The energy aura of truth level the vortex had released carried a strong penetrating power. The Land of Sword Grief's training room could block most of the energy aura, but no one expected that someone had cultivated the truth-level theurgy inside it during the time it had been designed.
<br><br>
Even the disciples on the first floor had sensed the energy aura. They were utterly surprised when they felt it.
<br><br>
"What's going on in the first room?"
<br><br>
"What kind of energy aura is that? Why can't the array of the training room block it?"
<br><br>
"It's so strange. The array of the training room was designed by a great master. But why..."
<br><br>
Although they were confused, they didn't dare enter the training room to check what happened. Nevertheless, they became more curious about Zen.
<br><br>
The energy aura lasted for only nine seconds. Zen had absorbed all the energy in the vortex into the sclerites. At the same time, all the sclerites turned over and shrank back. He reverted back to the human form in the blink of an eye, and all the blood power of the Chaos Ancient God had returned inside the sclerites.
<br><br>
To tell the truth, Zen could also use the Chaos Ancient God's blood power even if he didn't activate his form. But if he wanted to try his best, he did have to turn into the strange appearance, which was like a scorpion.
<br><br>
Now that he had a complete set of blood power, he could continue to cultivate Gerald's theurgy. The Falling Star Palm was just Gerald's basic theurgy, but the way the Truth Crystals would be utilized in the future was up to No. 9527.
<br><br>
Yet, at that point, Zen found that something was wrong with the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed he had swallowed.
<br><br>
"The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed is supposed to disappear after being refined, but why did this happen?" he asked curiously. Naturally, he was confused.
<br><br>
The originally unfolded seed had fully divided into two parts inside his body. Between those two parts floated countless lines of various lengths.
<br><br>
At that moment, his eyebrows suddenly shot up to his forehead. "These lines are the same as those of the Other Shore Key!"
<br><br>
As he thought about it for a little while, the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed that he had swallowed before went up along his belly, and then he spat it out.
<br><br>
After he had refined the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, the inside of the seed was completely empty. When he placed the two parts of the seed together, those lines appeared again! "Apart from copying bloodline, does the seed have any other uses?" Just then, his eyes immediately flashed.
<br><br>
As he recalled the Snake Goddess' reaction that day, he remembered that she had shown a rare, hesitant look when they discussed the matter of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed.
<br><br>
If it could only be used to carry the blood power, the Snake Goddess shouldn't have reacted like that.
<br><br>
The thought of it made him even more interested in those lines! He stretched out his hand and flipped on the space ring, and a divine crystal appeared in his palm. Then, with a pinch of his hand, the divine crystal was shattered and the internal energy flowed onto the lines.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A beam of pale blue light glowed, and the divine crystal had finally activated the Other Shore Key. A map appeared, along with a Sanskrit word! "It's true that there is an Other Shore Key inside this small Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. It's amazing!" Zen could not help but shout.
<br><br>
Not only Zen but also No. 9527 couldn't understand that.
<br><br>
In the past few years, the Pear Hill had closely protected the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree so that the outsiders couldn't reach it. Only Fuxi and the Snake Goddess in the whole Source World knew the secrets contained in the seeds.
<br><br>
At first, the Snake Goddess didn't want to hand over the Six-Pattern Bloodstoring Seed, but over the past few years, there was no important information discovered from the seeds. Of course, it made Fuxi and the Snake Goddess disappointed. After all, the last seed was hung on the tree as their beacon of hope. They had never picked it off, and at last they gave it to Zen.
<br><br>
They didn't expect that there was an Other Shore Key hidden in the last seed! Zen carefully protected the seed, and then sent it into his inner world to let Geoffrey decipher it.
<br><br>
By now, Geoffrey was quite familiar with such things. After he had deciphered the Sanskrit word on the Other Shore Key, he said, "Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore..."
<br><br>
Since Zen now had the map and also knew that the temple was located on Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore, it would be easy for him to accurately confirm its position. The other words Geoffrey had said seemed to be meaningless, but they were similar to the Truth of Godly Way. With those words, he could bring the Other Shore Key straight to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he had done something similar on Stage One of the Other Shore. "Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore?" he said as his eyes narrowed slightly.
<br><br>
Stage Seventeen was not far from Stage Fourteen. His current abilities could allow him to dash there in a snap.
<br><br>
But, why was an Other Shore Key of Stage Seventeen hidden in the SixPattern Blood-storing Seed? Who had put this key inside? What did it have to do with the Pear Hill? After Zen settled down in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, he decided to investigate this matter.
<br><br>
Chapter 3532 Invitation In Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore, a giant golden-winged bird soared graciously in the air, spreading out the aura of ferocity.
<br><br>
Such golden-winged birds named Garudas might as well be considered the number one predator of the food chain in this stage. Most creatures on the Other Shore and Souls of Light would flinch and dodge every time they came across one.
<br><br>
The Garuda hovered over a cliff that had a sunken path.
<br><br>
Though the path had existed for quite some time, no one knew how or when it was made.
<br><br>
At the end of the path was a Soul of Light, who had a pair of wings spread out behind the back. They resembled the wings of the demon women in the Divine Lair, except they were larger and more powerful. It was Elizabeth - head of the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
"Before these two had set foot into the Desire World, I had asked help from the Star Falcon race. I wanted them to use all their resources and facilities to kill them," she began explaining.
<br><br>
"However, we failed and the Dark Bear race was wiped out."
<br><br>
Previously, she had been too impatient in dealing with Zen in the Chaotic Source World, which had led to much downfall.
<br><br>
After that experience, she knew not to act so rashly again. She had to remain calm in order to win.
<br><br>
But her calmness did not mean surrendering. She had a plan, and she was going to push through with it no matter what.
<br><br>
However, Zen had shown a great amount of strength the moment he entered the Desire World. He was sure to pose a great threat to her race and their allies.
<br><br>
"Humph! We should not have relied on the Sun Crow race in the first place!" the person beside Elizabeth spewed out. This person was one of the Five-element Emissaries of the Bearing race, the Earth Emissary.
<br><br>
Elizabeth's face darkened at the sound of this. "How can you blame the Sun Crow race for this? The two humans are too powerful. One of them is a purified being!"
<br><br>
The Earth Emissary gasped, "A purified being? How did this purified being even set foot into the Desire World? You might be dreaming." There was no way the Earth Emissary was going to buy it.
<br><br>
When the word spread about Elvinia, they had already speculated that she was a purified being from the very beginning. She was the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but she suddenly reappeared on the Other Shore with a clear appearance. Her being a purified being was the only reasonable explanation for this to happen.
<br><br>
But her presence in the Desire World had confused everyone, including Elizabeth.
<br><br>
It was of common knowledge that purified beings could not roam around all stages, because they were rulers of particular stages. If she had managed to enter the Desire World, that would only be possible if she wasn't a purified being. This drove everyone to wonder and debate over her true identity.
<br><br>
"This is not important," Elizabeth snapped. "What's important is their strength. I should ask the Star Falcon race to act soon."
<br><br>
The Star Falcon race resided in the Sky Water City, and proved to be the strongest race in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
"And what if the Star Falcon race fails again?" The Earth Emissary challenged Elizabeth. He did not trust anyone at this point.
<br><br>
"Then..." Elizabeth's eyes narrowed. "Then I am afraid no one in Stage Fourteen would be able to defeat them. All we can do is wait for them to move up to the next stages."
<br><br>
"Allowing them to reach higher stages would only make them stronger along the way. You and I probably wouldn't even stand a chance against them!" he shook his head in frustration. "Elizabeth, I have no choice but to report to our emperor. He will report to the Blood Assembly and have the Dark Region deal with them once and for all."
<br><br>
"The creatures of the Dark Region can only act in the darkness. How do you suppose we lure them into the darkness when they know for a fact, that it is dangerous there?" Elizabeth asked.
<br><br>
"Hey, don't worry about that," the emissary chuckled. "I have a plan."
<br><br>
"And your plan is...?" Elizabeth asked, doubting the emissary a little bit.
<br><br>
"All you have to do is ask the Star Falcon race to act as planned. If they kill the two humans, then good for us. But if they fail, you'll be the first one to know my plan." he replied with a smug look on his face.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the inner yard of the city lord's mansion, a black Bodystrengthening Jade was being held safely in Zen's hands. This particular stone could increase one's body strength in a similar way that the soul crystal could improve the Souls of Light. After entering the Other Shore, all the Wild Gods needed such jades to strengthen their bodies.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack... "
<br><br>
With only a slight push, Zen put enough pressure on the stone for it to turn into fine black powder. He gently sent it into his elixir field.
<br><br>
Within seconds, the substance made its way through the elixir field to Zen's meridians. Less than a minute had passed and it was already distributed evenly across his body.
<br><br>
Almost instantly, Zen felt his body grow stronger a bit.
<br><br>
If the Other Shore Power had been destroyed or removed, all the creatures in the Source World would lose much strength. Zen was not an exception to this. His physical strength had been less than a divine megaton at one point.
<br><br>
Even after fusing with the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline, his strength did not improve significantly.
<br><br>
Though he was considered to be a big threat to everyone else, his physical strength was still very poor as compared to his Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
"Master Regal Jade, you said before that I would be unable to refine the Body-strengthening Jade," Zen said to the Regal Jade Spirit in his body, "but I just devoured it and everything seems fine."
<br><br>
Prior to entering the Desire World, Zen had never actually seen a Bodystrengthening Jade.
<br><br>
His first ever encounter with it was in the iron house inside the energy vertex.
<br><br>
At that time, the Regal Jade Spirit had predicted that Zen wouldn't be able to refine the Body-strengthening Jade, because his body was not cultivated with the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. He proved it wrong by refining the jade quite smoothly into his body.
<br><br>
"It's a little weird." The Regal Jade Spirit thought for a moment and continued, "I guess this means that the Truth of Godly Way of your body has a connection with the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been able to refine it at all."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit couldn't seem to understand it either, but it was probably because the Truths of Godly Ways were hard to understand. Other creatures in the chaos wouldn't understand them clearly either.
<br><br>
There were many features of the Truths of Godly Ways. Some of them repelled one another and some had commonalities. At the time Zen went against the Evil God, he was able to pour the Truth of Three-Energy Construction into the Imperial Sword Seal. This was because this Truth of Godly Way had something in common with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.
<br><br>
Zen felt great and happy that his strength had been improved. He didn't plan to stop after refining that first Body-strengthening Jade.
<br><br>
Breaking Zen's solitude, Elvinia stepped in and spread out her arms, smiling at him. "What do you think?"
<br><br>
She wore an ocean blue dress that had light green lace detailing at the hem.
<br><br>
Her dress was exquisite, beautiful, and at the same time, emitted a tiny bit of energy.
<br><br>
"You look extraordinary. Was it made by the Guide Weasel race?" Zen asked, appreciating the beauty in front of him.
<br><br>
"Yes! I didn't expect them to be so good with their hands," she said giddily.
<br><br>
The dress was not only powerful, but it put her in a great mood.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement. Just then, he picked up another piece of Bodystrengthening Jade and handed it to her. "You're here just in time," he said.
<br><br>
"Try and see if you can refine this jade."
<br><br>
As a purified being, Elvinia was physically and mentally strong. However, she still had things to learn, like how to use her power wisely.
<br><br>
Zen didn't doubt that she could refine the jade. It seemed that the Other Shore creatures were able to do it, so it should be nothing to Elvinia.
<br><br>
She blinked a couple times and then took the cool-to-touch jade in her hand.
<br><br>
"Okay," she said and then turned around and took a seat right next to Zen.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the stone in her hand shone a brilliant light. "I forgot to tell you something," she said, looking at Zen intently.
<br><br>
"What is it?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"I invited Letitia and Margaret to live in my Phoenix Palace for a while,"
<br><br>
she replied, trying not to look him in the eye.
<br><br>
Zen was stunned upon hearing this.
<br><br>
Chapter 3533 An Attack Back then, Zen had first met Elvinia at the Seven Mountains Meeting.
<br><br>
Some time later, Zen returned home after obtaining the Shade Stone, only to find out that Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly had been "invited" by Elvinia to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Furious, he had stormed the Phoenix Palace to face Elvinia right then and there.
<br><br>
To his surprise, the three women were actually quite content there, so Zen didn't force them to come back. However, now, Elvinia had invited Letitia and Margaret. What was she up to? "Why didn't you tell me in advance?" Zen frowned deeply.
<br><br>
Elvinia smiled apologetically. "I thought they were bored in the Flow Sword Sect, so I invited them to the Phoenix Palace. Besides, you were busy practicing in seclusion the other day, so I didn't get the chance to tell you."
<br><br>
The Phoenix Palace was not a dangerous place after all, and to a certain extent, it was actually safer than the Flow Sword Sect. Still, it was a bit suspicious that Elvinia was being courteous to Letitia and Margaret.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. He couldn't figure it out.
<br><br>
He just said, "Forget it. Let's just refine the Body-strengthening Jade."
<br><br>
"Okay." Elvinia nodded meekly.
<br><br>
Zen thought he saw a hint of amusement in her eyes, but it quickly disappeared. She then concentrated on crushing the Body-strengthening Jade for her body to absorb it.
<br><br>
Just like Zen, refining the Body-strengthening Jade was easy for Elvinia.
<br><br>
It was more efficient to strengthen the corporeal body than to enhance the Soul of Light.
<br><br>
For Zen, strengthening his corporeal body meant he could use it outside the Other Shore. Elvinia, on the other hand, couldn't bring her corporeal body outside the Other Shore, so it seemed a bit wasteful to strengthen it.
<br><br>
However, after occupying the Myriad Spirits City, Zen had obtained a lot of resources. Even after he distributed some to the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, there was still a lot of leftover.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to continue refining the Body-strengthening Jade, a bright yellow shadow darted into his line of sight. When his eyes adjusted to the figure approaching him, he realized it was the leader of the Guide Weasel race, Clyde.
<br><br>
"Sir, something is happening in the Sky Water City," Clyde reported anxiously.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia exchanged glances.
<br><br>
These days, the Guide Weasel race had been closely observing the movements of the Sky Water City. No matter what the news was, they would report everything to Zen.
<br><br>
"What is it?" Zen asked with one eyebrow raised.
<br><br>
"The elite members of the Star Falcon race are coming straight to the Myriad Spirits City." Clyde's small, beady eyes looked serious as he spoke.
<br><br>
The Star Falcon race was able to occupy the Sky Water City, and their strength was far greater than that of the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race. In the past few years, the Star Falcon race had also thought of attacking the Myriad Spirits City, but it would cause a lot of trouble, so the two races had been living a relatively peaceful time.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, because of Zen and Elvinia, the Star Falcon race decided now was the time to strike. In Clyde's eyes, they were a force to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
However, to the Guide Weasel race, while this might have seemed like imminent doom, it was also a rare opportunity.
<br><br>
If Zen wiped out the elite members of the Star Falcon race, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race would be able to counterattack and take charge of the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
So when Clyde saw the elite members of the Star Falcon race come out, he excitedly raced to Zen to tell him the news.
<br><br>
Zen handed over the Body-strengthening Jade to Elvinia, who tucked it into her space ring. Looking up to the sky, Zen asked, "How long before they arrive?"
<br><br>
"With the speed of the Star Falcon race, roughly two hours," Clyde replied.
<br><br>
"We're ready to fight at any time!"
<br><br>
Knowing Zen and Elvinia were incredibly powerful, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race were confident. Banking on the two's strength, they were willing to go all out.
<br><br>
"Good. Ask all the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace to leave the Other Shore. You, come with me to the gate of the city." Zen stood up and walked out of the City Guard House, with Elvinia at his heels.
<br><br>
Standing at the gate, Zen had an overlooking view of the broad plain in the distance.
<br><br>
The purple light was dancing in the sky. It was constantly giving off pressure. The Souls of Light could feel the coldness if they were shrouded in the purple light, but when it struck on Zen's body, it was like a piece of hot charcoal, causing a faint burning sensation from time to time.
<br><br>
On the city wall, the mole crickets, carrying Green Kylin Bows in their hands, stood still. They were the aboriginals of the Myriad Spirits City, and they had always obeyed the orders of the City Guard House. After Zen took over the City Guard House, they became somewhat like his private soldiers.
<br><br>
In addition to the mole crickets as archers, many Giants who held massive clubs also stood on the city wall. They looked menacing, as though a swing of a club would break down half the city wall.
<br><br>
As for the members of the Guide Weasel race, they were hiding on both sides of the city wall. Like the Ear Mice, they were small, so they were not suitable for direct combat. However, they were agile and nimble; their secret tactic was to land fatal blows up close, which was extremely hard to guard against.
<br><br>
Roughly an hour later, there was a dot of light in the distance, as though a star suddenly lit up. In the blink of an eye, many more stars appeared, dotting the broad plain before them.
<br><br>
"What beautiful stars!" Elvinia said under her breath.
<br><br>
"They are not stars," said Clyde, who overheard her. "They are Star Falcons. They're almost upon us!"
<br><br>
The Star Falcon was a very ferocious bird, with a dazzling star-like diamond embedded on its chest.
<br><br>
As the Star Falcons got closer and closer, Elvinia could see their wings flapping with the wind.
<br><br>
"You stay here and don't leave the city wall," Zen suddenly said to Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't know how to fly. Even though she had a strong body as a purified being, it was still risky for her to face the Star Falcon race.
<br><br>
"Fine." Elvinia frowned slightly. She didn't like to feel useless in times of trouble.
<br><br>
"Thirty thousand feet!" Clyde announced.
<br><br>
"Twenty thousand feet!"
<br><br>
"Ten thousand feet!"
<br><br>
Clyde narrowed his beady eyes at the flying figures closing in on them.
<br><br>
"Eight thousand feet! Shoot!"
<br><br>
he commanded the archers.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Like green rain, arrows whizzed through the air towards the Star Falcons.
<br><br>
From the receiving end of the arrows, the largest Star Falcon at the forefront squinted at the city wall.
<br><br>
It was the leader of the Star Falcon race, Hans.
<br><br>
Thanks to their exceptional vision, the Star Falcons could see the figures on the wall of the Myriad Spirits City clearly.
<br><br>
Finally, Hans' eyes landed on what he was looking for. "Strange," Hans murmured. "The two targets are in plain sight."
<br><br>
He didn't care about the failures of the Ghost Scorpion and the Dark Bear race.
<br><br>
The Star Falcon race was above all the races in the Light Region of Stage Fourteen; they were the rulers there.
<br><br>
The second Hans received the request from the Sun Crow race, he had agreed with no hesitation. It seemed to be a good opportunity to invade the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Unbothered by the volley of arrows coming straight for him, Hans simply flapped his wide wings.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A strong wind blew from Hans' incredible wings, sending the arrows backwards till they plummeted to the ground.
<br><br>
Chapter 3534 Counterattack Witnessing their chief flick away the volley of arrows as though they were but toothpicks, the rest of the Star Falcon race cheered.
<br><br>
"The Myriad Spirits City is still weak!"
<br><br>
"They are too weak! This city should have been occupied by our Star Falcon race long ago!"
<br><br>
"You know nothing! The best way is to control it through the Dark Bear race. There is no need for us to take over this city!"
<br><br>
The members of the Star Falcon race cackled amongst themselves as they flew towards the city wall. The Star Falcon race thought very highly of themselves, and had always belittled the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
So it had piqued their curiosity when their chief decided to gather all their forces just to kill two human targets.
<br><br>
This was unacceptable-- beneath them, really.
<br><br>
Due to their relationship with the Sun Crow race, the Star Falcon race had always protected the Souls of Light of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race. And these two races also enjoyed a high status in the Sky Water City, but even so, the Star Falcon race still thought lowly of humans.
<br><br>
In their eyes, the humans were weak. But their human targets had even bodies on the Other Shore! "Aoo!"
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Hans let out a high pitched cry, commanding his troops to strike back.
<br><br>
Obeying their chief, all the Star Falcons spread out their wings in unison.
<br><br>
The diamond embedded in their chests glowed, emitting a trace of star radiance that formed a ring.
<br><br>
This ring grew bigger and bigger, till it was as big as their massive bodies.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! From within the ring, thousands of long and thin light swords with star radiance shot out towards the city wall. These swords were several times more powerful than the green arrows shot by the mole crickets! Squeak! "Activate the array!" Clyde ordered promptly.
<br><br>
In no time, several Guide Weasels hiding in the darkness activated the array that was arranged on the city wall.
<br><br>
The Guide Weasel race had lived in the Myriad Spirits City since time immemorial. Over the years, they had planted arrays in the city. One, in particular, was the Heavenly Harmony Array at the front of the city. This array had been gifted to them a long time ago by an ancient civilization.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
A thick, white fog rose from the ground, enshrouding the whole city wall.
<br><br>
Once the Star Falcons' swords pierced the fog, it was as though they had landed in jelly. The long, thin swords then abruptly turned around, and shot back from whence they came.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! "The white fog is sending our starry swords back!"
<br><br>
"Split up!"
<br><br>
The Star Falcons that had been soaring in the air panicked, and anxiously spread out to dodge the swords shooting back at them. Amazingly, no one got hurt.
<br><br>
"Chief, what should we do?"
<br><br>
"The array they're using is strange... How did they bounce back our starry swords!"
<br><br>
However, Hans just snorted at them. Impatiently, he let out another piercing cry.
<br><br>
"Keep attacking!"
<br><br>
This order confused many Star Falcons. But since it was given by their chief, they just obeyed, and continued to form more starry rings, shooting more starry swords towards the city.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Facing the second volley of thin swords, the Giants standing on the city wall laughed.
<br><br>
It was a well-known fact that the Star Falcon race was the strongest race in Stage Fourteen. However, this battle seemed to be proving that fact wrong.
<br><br>
How could the Star Falcon race be so foolish as to launch the same attack once more? Undoubtedly, these starry swords would be bounced back to the sky by the Heavenly Harmony Array again, no matter how powerful they were.
<br><br>
The instant the starry swords fell, a tearing sound suddenly came from below the city wall.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! With a burst of roars coming from the bottom of the city wall, a great number of creatures in green armor drilled out from the ground. They were from the Mountain Breaking race. They had lived in the Sky Water City and followed the Star Falcon race since a long time ago.
<br><br>
Back when the Dark Bear race was in charge of the City Guard House, the Star Falcon race had already dug out all the secrets of the Myriad Spirits City. Of course they'd been expecting the Heaven Harmony Array! The Star Falcon race launching attacks from the sky was actually a distraction. In order to let the Mountain Breaking race sneak in from underground, they were willing to risk looking foolish.
<br><br>
Alas, the array's foundation was destroyed. The white fog that had been shrouding the city dissipated into thin air. Then, the starry swords shot down like heavy rain.
<br><br>
A Giant who had been smirking just seconds prior was suddenly impaled by a starry sword, falling to the ground with a heavy thud. Pained cries filled the air as other creatures were being shot.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
Raul brandished a thick metal club. The club shadows covered Zen's and Elvinia's heads, smashing the starry swords that fell on this area into pieces.
<br><br>
"Sir! The Heavenly Harmony Array has been destroyed. We have to retreat!" Clyde said urgently.
<br><br>
The biggest advantage of the Star Falcon race was that they could fly.
<br><br>
On the contrary, the Giants were good at head-on combat, whereas the Guide Weasels were good at sneaky assassination. Neither of the two races had a chance against the enemy they were facing now.
<br><br>
Click! Click! Click! As each of the starry swords dropped, it would pierce the city wall, leaving a deep gash. In the blink of an eye, the city wall was already riddled with holes.
<br><br>
"If we retreat, we can't kill them," Zen said firmly, staring at the Star Falcons in the sky.
<br><br>
"If they want to occupy the Myriad Spirits City, they will have to land first.
<br><br>
Only then will we have a chance!" Clyde analyzed.
<br><br>
"Clyde's right. But their target is the two of you," echoed Raul, who stood nearby.
<br><br>
Although they were full of fighting spirit, they were keenly aware that they couldn't fight against the Star Falcon race without the Heavenly Harmony Array. It was reasonable for them to retreat first.
<br><br>
"There's no need to retreat," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
Elvinia gently asked, "Do you want me to send you up?"
<br><br>
"Okay." Zen smiled.
<br><br>
Elvinia suddenly yanked the metal club from Raul's hands, leaving him stunned.
<br><br>
A mighty creature like Raul should've been able to respond quickly, since he regarded his weapon as important as his own life.
<br><br>
But even if Raul had been quick enough to respond, in that moment, he had felt an incredible power from Elvinia's slender arms. There was no way he could've resisted. The metal club was instantly taken away by Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia then raised the metal club towards the sky, and Zen jumped onto it.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
From Elvinia's fingers erupted a powerful force, which was channeled through the club, shooting Zen thousands of feet into the air.
<br><br>
If Zen's body was any weaker, this strike would've destroyed his body.
<br><br>
Raul was absolutely dumbfounded. Even the residual force from the smash hurt his face. But Zen was able to withstand it. How strong was this man? As Zen shot into the sky, a pair of thunder wings appeared on his back.
<br><br>
Thanks to Elvinia's little trick, Zen flew like a flash of lightning.
<br><br>
Before the Star Falcons had the time to react, they heard a thunderous roar and then felt a heavy blow on their chests. Disgruntled, they lost their balance and plunged to the ground.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Zen's body had suddenly turned into a lightning arc in the air, hitting Star Falcons one after another without a break. Once his body arc hit a Star Falcon, it would plummet down, a black mark seared on the chest.
<br><br>
In about ten seconds, more than twenty Star Falcons had already plunged to their deaths, most of which were elites! The rest of the Star Falcons were shocked. Hans, shaking his head, tried to gather his wits.
<br><br>
Chapter 3535 Capture The Leader Of course, letting Zen kill them like that was out of the question.
<br><br>
According to their intel, there was no record of Zen being able to fly. They imagined Zen would be struck down by the human woman's club! Zen's flexible figure was reflected in Hans' eyes.
<br><br>
"Aoo..."
<br><br>
With a piercing cry from Hans, all the Star Falcons spread their wings and quickly distanced themselves from each other! This space between them made it difficult for Zen to kill them.
<br><br>
Zen could not fly very fast as he was relying on the Thunderstorm Godly Way to fly.
<br><br>
He had just been shot up into the air by Elvinia's power, and as he rose he was able to strike down more than twenty Star Falcons in an instant with his great power. But now, he began to get slower and slower.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
He rushed at another Star Falcon, who suddenly tilted his wings and flew to the other side, dodging Zen's attack with great agility.
<br><br>
After Zen failed to hit anything, a huge Star Falcon dashed towards him.
<br><br>
His name was Garth and he was Hans' assistant, second only to Hans in terms of strength and status in the Star Falcon race.
<br><br>
On the front end of his wings were many silver spangles.
<br><br>
The surface of the spangles was engraved with an ancient array. Under the array, all the spangles were sharp as blades.
<br><br>
This was the magic weapon created by the Riverside race.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
Garth raised his wings and charged at Zen at an astonishing speed, moving like a flying saber. In the blink of an eye, he slashed at Zen.
<br><br>
Seeing the dazzling spangles on his wings, Zen abruptly somersaulted in the air and nimbly dodged the attack.
<br><br>
But the Star Falcon race was a flying race after all, so every member could pretty much fly from birth. Naturally they were more experienced in aerial combat than human beings.
<br><br>
Garth seemed to have predicted Zen's movement and as he moved backwards, Garth screeched excitedly and flew in the same direction as he did. He rushed towards him rotating his body at the same time! "Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
The other Star Falcons' eyes ignited with joy on seeing this.
<br><br>
"Garth's blade cyclone!"
<br><br>
"It will cut anything in its path to tiny pieces!"
<br><br>
"That brat is doomed!"
<br><br>
The Star Falcons hadn't expected Zen to kill more than twenty of their companions in an instant, so their great resentment was to be expected. Of course they hoped that Garth would chop Zen into pieces and that they could then eat him after.
<br><br>
However, what they did not know was that battling with the physical body was the least of Zen's fears.
<br><br>
Garth's wings rotated crazily and rolled towards Zen, when in a flash Zen grabbed at Garth ferociously.
<br><br>
"How dare you lay your hands on me! Brat!" Garth sneered.
<br><br>
The spangles on his wings were called 'Heavenly Feather Teeth'. Each of them was carefully made by the most renowned craftsmen of the Riverside race. In order to make and gather 36 spangles, both the Riverside race and the Star Falcon race had paid a hefty price.
<br><br>
Except for a few defensive weapons of Stage Fourteen, nothing else could withstand the wings' slicing ability, let alone the physical human body. Even the city walls of the Myriad Spirits City were soft as mud before his wings.
<br><br>
A huge clang rang out as Zen's hand blocked Garth's right wing. Not only had his wing failed to cut Zen's hand, it had slammed into something unbelievably hard! "Oh no! What is in this human brat's palm? It has somehow managed to block my Heavenly Feather Teeth!"
<br><br>
Garth was startled and attempted to withdraw his right wing.
<br><br>
Only then did he feel Zen's iron grip as his hand didn't budge at all. Garth was stuck.
<br><br>
In a moment of desperation, he slashed at Zen with his left wing, but before the blow could land, his wing was clamped by Zen's other hand! "Aoo..."
<br><br>
In a panic, Garth squawked a sharp cry for help, at the same time dragging Zen and rolling desperately in the air.
<br><br>
Even Hans, the leader, had believed that Garth could defeat Zen, yet he had cried for help so soon. He was considered as one of the best fighters in the Star Falcon race! Shocked at the scene before them, no Star Falcon nearby dared to rush forward! Finally, Hans flew up and swooped at Zen. No matter what, he had to save Garth first! "He is finally coming!"
<br><br>
Zen noticed Hans approaching as he was rolling over.
<br><br>
The most effective method was to kill the leader of the race first, just as he had killed the leader of the Dark Bear race and then destroyed the rest.
<br><br>
Once the leader was taken care of, dealing with the rest would be a piece of cake.
<br><br>
Hans was massive and had been issuing all the orders. Zen had long set his sights on him as his highest priority target.
<br><br>
"Hey..."
<br><br>
Zen grabbed Garth's wings and pulled him towards his chest. Garth shot at him with a shriek.
<br><br>
Zen curled up and suddenly stretched his legs out to bounce off of Garth! "Boom!"
<br><br>
Zen kicked off him releasing a power of around 2000 divine megatons.
<br><br>
The physical body of a bird was weaker than an ordinary creature. How could Garth bear this force? Zen's foot prints sank down into Garth's chest. The bones and viscera in his body shattered and his huge body plummeted down.
<br><br>
Zen darted like an arrow, at incredible speed once more, by using the counterforce.
<br><br>
As the chief leader of the Star Falcon race, Hans was the smartest and most powerful of them all.
<br><br>
He remained vigilant, his eyes focused intently as he approached Zen. He had seen how he handled Garth and this put him on guard.
<br><br>
To Hans' surprise, when he was still over 200 feet away, Zen had stamped on Garth and rushed to him by means of the counterforce! 'I'm his target?' An idea popped into Hans' mind.
<br><br>
"Illusory Transformation! Escape!"
<br><br>
The bird's innate alertness would probably save him, if Zen was not the one he was up against.
<br><br>
Hans displayed a weird movement skill. His wings rolled and formed many golden shadows which spread in all directions like thousands of Star Falcons.
<br><br>
"You hope to escape with just a little trick?"
<br><br>
Zen's gaze was fixed on Hans' real figure and he stretched out towards him.
<br><br>
But his hand went right through the figure like it was a cloud and it disappeared before his eyes.
<br><br>
This bodily movement skill was somewhat similar to the Eight Smoky Melodies that Zen had cultivated and even the feather of Wing King.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, using such a skill before Zen was a display of one's meager ability to an expert.
<br><br>
Chapter 3536 Die With Me Failing to capture Hans, Zen activated the Civilization Artifact in his body, and then a cyan feather suddenly sprouted from his body.
<br><br>
He felt his body become extraordinarily light. He reached out his hand again and this time, successfully grabbed Hans' tail though he moved swiftly via Illusory Transformation! "Aoo!"
<br><br>
Hans howled in frustration. He flapped his wings wildly, stirring up strong winds that buffeted Zen.
<br><br>
Now that he had been caught by Zen, how would he be able to escape? Elvinia who stood on the city wall, focused her eyes on the scene that had unfolded in midair. It was not exciting for her; she even felt a bit bored.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Raul and Clyde gasped in shock as their eyes widened in awe.
<br><br>
"Isn't that Hans, the leader of the Star Falcon race? This is incredible!"
<br><br>
Clyde exclaimed.
<br><br>
As the leader of the Guide Weasel race, Clyde had already encountered Hans in the past.
<br><br>
That powerful Star Falcon had shown true arrogance in front of the Guide Weasel race. Clyde was already the leader of the Guide Weasel race but he still felt inferior in front of Hans.
<br><br>
It was hard to believe that Hans was seized by Zen so easily, and he looked extremely miserable, "I have wanted to smash that face myself for so long!"
<br><br>
Raul grunted as he looked at his own metal club in Elvinia's hand.
<br><br>
Elvinia held it with one hand casually.
<br><br>
The metal club was thick and extremely heavy. It took Raul a lot of effort to carry it. However, the thin human girl had been able to hold it easily in just one hand. Seeing her toughness and strength made Raul doubt the talents of the Giants.
<br><br>
"If Zen really defeats Hans, that's one less problem for us," Clyde mused with a chuckle.
<br><br>
The Star Falcon race had taken advantage of their tremendous strength to put the Sky Water City under their control.
<br><br>
When their strength waned and people noticed it, a rebellion would probably take place to overthrow their power in the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
In the past, the Dark Bear race had used their strength to forcibly take over the City Guard House. Unexpectedly, it was not Zen who made the first move to control the City Guard House but the Guide Weasel race and the Giants. Zen's role was only to kill the strongest one, and that was all they would have required of him.
<br><br>
Hans tried his best to shake Zen off. He dragged Zen up and down while the other Star Falcons followed closely behind them. Fear and panic were visible in their eyes. They needed to think of a way to rescue their leader from Zen's clutches, fast.
<br><br>
"Kill him!" Hans ordered in a commanding voice.
<br><br>
The moment they heard his order, all of the Star Falcons raised their wings in response, forming starry rings.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! Starry swords shot straight towards Zen from all directions, looking like sparkling golden streaks.
<br><br>
However, as Zen had grasped Hans by his tail, the other Star Falcons hesitated in attacking in fear of injuring their leader. As a result, they weren't able to shoot at Zen accurately.
<br><br>
Moreover, it seemed like Zen was protected by invisible rules after he had activated the feather of the Wing King. Even if there was a stray starry sword that luckily managed to get within striking distance from Zen, he would have easily dodged it by shaking his body slightly.
<br><br>
Therefore, even a synchronized attack from such a multitude of Star Falcons wasn't enough to put even the tiniest scratch on Zen.
<br><br>
Zen slowly made his way up Hans' body by grabbing his tail bit by bit until he eventually reached Hans' back. Suddenly, he leaped to grab Hans' neck and whispered coldly, "If you still want to live, go down!"
<br><br>
It was extremely easy for Zen to kill the Star Falcon right then and there, but it would produce a better reaction if he controlled him in the Myriad Spirits City! "Do you want the Star Falcon race to surrender? Over our dead bodies!"
<br><br>
Hans lifted his head proudly.
<br><br>
"You think you have a choice?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Breaking the giant Star Falcon's neck was just like snapping a twig for Zen.
<br><br>
"Of course I have! Star Stasis!"
<br><br>
Hans trilled once again. In response, the gem embedded in his chest began to glow brightly, scintillating with a brilliant starry light.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
A huge starry ring rapidly spread out along his wings and formed a sphere, totally engulfing his body together with Zen.
<br><br>
The scant space within the sphere was just enough to contain Hans' bird body and Zen's own. His large wings still extended beyond the boundaries of the sphere.
<br><br>
As the sphere enveloped Zen, it also exerted a resistance force. Zen suddenly felt his strength being sapped, as if he had fallen into quicksand, the resistance weighing his body down at a great extent.
<br><br>
Aside from losing his strength, he also felt that the flow of blood and air, as well as the transmission of sound, were extremely slowed down.
<br><br>
"What... Is... This... Strength..." Even Zen's speech became slurred. An expression of surprise came over his features.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter what type of strength it is; I'm taking you down with me!"
<br><br>
Hans sneered.
<br><br>
A slight tilt of Hans' wings outside the sphere made both of them glide in the sky and turn towards the east of the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Clyde, who had been standing on the city wall, was shocked when he saw what happened. "Oh no! It looks like Hans wants to bring Zen into the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
"The Dark Region?" Elvinia blinked her eyes in shock, refusing to believe what she had just heard.
<br><br>
"Yes! East of the Myriad Spirits City, and beyond the Heavenly Dark Mountain and the Earthly Dark Mountain, there is a corner of the Dark Region. That must be where they are headed!" Clyde explained, a tinge of worry in his voice.
<br><br>
"Zen will be doomed," Raul said with a horrified expression.
<br><br>
Both Raul and Clyde were creatures from the Other Shore. They had always stayed in the Light Region as it was ingrained in them that the Dark Region was a dangerous place. All the creatures in the Light Region were taught to be cautious of the Dark Region from the moment that they were born.
<br><br>
"He has..."
<br><br>
Elvinia stopped in the middle of her sentence. She had wanted to reassure them that Zen had Darkness Fruits and candles that were enough to enable him to stay in the Dark Region, but she belatedly realized that Zen had not been carrying a space ring on his body. All of the Darkness Fruits and candles were in her possession! "Gosh! Take me to the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
Elvinia threw Raul's metal club forcefully. The club tumbled in the air for more than ten times then embedded into the city wall with a metallic clang.
<br><br>
As she launched herself into the air, she straightened her legs together tightly. Her whole body resembled an arrow that had just been shot from a bow, heading directly east! Clyde and Raul followed closely on her heels.
<br><br>
Raul's body was immense, and every step he took would have spanned about three hundred feet. Clyde's extreme speed was one of his advantages over other creatures. Both of them had not been able to catch up to Elvinia, but they weren't far behind her.
<br><br>
They could not help themselves from worrying.
<br><br>
If Zen met his fateful end here, it wouldn't end well for them, either! On the other hand, they wouldn't achieve anything good by going there! No one was able to prevent Hans from bringing Zen with him into the Dark Region! Although Zen had been engulfed by the Star Stasis, dying had been far from his mind. He knew that with his current body, those starry swords would be harmless to him.
<br><br>
But when Hans took Zen and leapt through two mountains, a dark area was revealed in front of their eyes! "The Dark Region! You want to drag me into the Dark Region?!" Zen's expression rapidly changed into a dire one.
<br><br>
Without the Darkness Fruits and candles, no one who had entered the Dark Region had ever survived. Zen didn't think that he was an exception.
<br><br>
He probably knew far more about the Dark Region than Hans, who had been a creature of the Light Region! "My starry gem has already begun to burn, and there is no chance for me to live. You should feel honored that I'm taking you to die with me!" Hans shrieked.
<br><br>
The starry gem was a gemstone embedded in the chest of the Star Falcons.
<br><br>
The Star Stasis with the greatest resistance could only be activated by burning the starry gem.
<br><br>
Once the starry gem was fully consumed and burnt out, it would also be the end of Hans' life.
<br><br>
Chapter 3537 The Light From The Crack One could compare the Dark Region to a huge, black beast that spanned the eastern region of Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
The area Zen saw was part of the Dark Region's far end, closest to the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Hans had no intention of perishing together with Zen. He was the mighty leader of the Star Falcon race! He had a lot to live for.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that death was the only way to go after he discovered Zen's true power.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! There was a sharp sound as the wings outside the ball flapped and carried Zen towards the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Chief!" one of his followers called out. "There's no need to perish with this human man!"
<br><br>
"Chief, please! There must be another way!"
<br><br>
The other Star Falcons continued to plead as they followed behind their leader.
<br><br>
Only an hour had passed since their attack on the Myriad Spirits City but in that short time period, all elite members of their race had been eliminated.
<br><br>
Garth, so mighty and strong, also died in Zen's hands. The only solution Hans could think of in order to subdue Zen was to bring him into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The Star Falcons could only grovel at his feet to persuade him not to go.
<br><br>
"Get out of the way!" Hans roared, his patience worn thin by his insistent followers.
<br><br>
He had already made his decision and there was no way he was going to change his mind.
<br><br>
His roar sent his followers scampering away. There was no stopping their leader anymore. All they could do was stay out of his way and let him head into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen was struggling within the ball.
<br><br>
The power released by the Star Stasis was strange. It was a type of sealing power that froze Zen's entire body.
<br><br>
He looked on as the ball took him closer to the Dark Region, his expression growing grimmer by the second.
<br><br>
In between the Heavenly Dark Mountain and the Earthy Dark Mountain was a low mountain ridge.
<br><br>
Elvinia rushed to the foot of the ridge and released her full strength, shooting forward like an arrow.
<br><br>
The force she exerted was enough to shake the earth.
<br><br>
Clyde and Raul trailing behind her could only look on in shock as cracks appeared on the ground Elvinia walked on.
<br><br>
Over time, Elvinia's speed decreased and she fell on a slope at the side of the mountain.
<br><br>
Crack! A huge crack like a spider web appeared where she stood before she was suddenly off again! Elvinia stopped for two or three times more to get a break. Pretty soon, she saw the Star Falcons and Hans rushing towards the Dark Region at breakneck speed.
<br><br>
A trace of horror appeared in her eyes. "No..."
<br><br>
There was no way she could allow Zen to be brought into the Dark Region like this! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Clyde and Raul, who had been closely following her this whole time, were shell-shocked at what they saw.
<br><br>
"He's doomed." Raul muttered hopelessly.
<br><br>
Clyde shook his head. "The Star Stasis is said to be able to stop the flow of all energy. There's no way he'll be able to resist it."
<br><br>
Falling into the Dark Region had a multitude of consequences. No matter how strong Zen was, death was inescapable.
<br><br>
However, Clyde had a plan.
<br><br>
Zen's death wasn't going to be that big of a deal if Elvinia was still alive.
<br><br>
Her strength wasn't any weaker than Zen's, or that was what Clyde thought since she was undefeatable in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
While the two paused to think about their current situation, Elvinia began to release a soft aura.
<br><br>
As she did so, her pupils rolled up so that the only thing visible were the whites of her eyes.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia..." Raul called out in shock by her appearance.
<br><br>
Clyde was the same and could only helplessly call out for her, "Princess Elvinia?"
<br><br>
She seemed to have lost her consciousness but her body thrummed with power. Elvinia's hands were raised in front of her with wisps of white light emanating between her fingers.
<br><br>
Light wasn't something that could be easily controlled.
<br><br>
Most, if not all, usually scattered and formed a simple line.
<br><br>
However, the one Elvinia released was forming several unique shapes.
<br><br>
"What are those?" Raul asked.
<br><br>
The sight of these blazing white lights made Clyde's eyes twitch.
<br><br>
As the leader of the Guide Weasel race, he was privy to the legends that circulated about the Dark Region.
<br><br>
It was said that purified beings could create lights that had the ability to eliminate all creatures of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Could it be as the legends said? Was Elvinia a purified being? There was no way! She was from a world outside the Other Shore. There was no way she could be a purified being.
<br><br>
However, the more Clyde thought about it, the more confused he became. If Elvinia wasn't a purified being, then what other explanation would be reasonable? The moment Elvinia crossed her hands, the light in her eyes suddenly went out, revealing her pupils once again. Her face was pale with fatigue and she promptly passed out on the ground.
<br><br>
Just as she fell, Raul reached out and caught her in his huge palm. "Princess Elvinia!" he cried out, trying to shake her awake. "Oh, my God..." Clyde murmured in disbelief.
<br><br>
"What the heck happened?" Raul asked with a helpless expression.
<br><br>
Darkness covered the whole Dark Region.
<br><br>
However, at that moment, a huge crack suddenly appeared in the sky above the edge of the Dark Region. It emitted a blazing white light that blinded anyone who dared look at it.
<br><br>
The Star Falcons could do nothing but watch as their leader was swallowed in the darkness and disappeared from view.
<br><br>
As soon as Hans entered the Dark Region, the energy within it began to erode his corporeal body.
<br><br>
His hair, his flesh, and even his bones cracked instantly.
<br><br>
Zen, who was wrapped in the Star Stasis, was able to resist.
<br><br>
However, as creatures of the Light Region, it was only a matter of time before they got completely devoured by the darkness.
<br><br>
Just when Hans thought he had achieved his goal, a crack suddenly appeared in the sky and bright light flooded the Dark Region.
<br><br>
This bright light completely won over the darkness and illuminated an area with a radius of a hundred miles.
<br><br>
"What the heck?!"
<br><br>
Hans exclaimed in disbelief.
<br><br>
They were in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Where in the world did this light come from? There was no way that was possible. Hans racked his brains but couldn't figure out an explanation.
<br><br>
The creatures of the Dark Region were the ones that bore the brunt of this light's sudden appearance. The moment it touched them, they all burned to ashes and died.
<br><br>
It was in this way that the dark demon plants, which stood ten thousand feet high, and the five-color earthly dragons perished.
<br><br>
Chapter 3538 The Pear Hill Stronghold It was known that despite having turned into ashes, things in the Dark Region could not exist in the light.
<br><br>
The white light had eroded them, and as a result their ashes had completely dissipated.
<br><br>
Almost everything was swept away, to the point that the area within a hundred-mile radius was practically spotless and abnormally clean.
<br><br>
As for the creature from the Star Falcon race, Hans, he was now on the verge of death.
<br><br>
He had burned his starry gem, while the Dark Region had eroded his whole body.
<br><br>
"How... How did you make it?" he couldn't help but ask Zen when they fell down together. Apparently, he thought that Zen had created that beam of light.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the Star Falcon in front of him, who was at the last moments of his life. "Because we have a purified being," he said with a smile.
<br><br>
Back in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, he had witnessed how Elvinia had released such a terrifyingly powerful burst of light.
<br><br>
Yet at that time, the Great Sanskrit Light, which had descended from the sky, was only sustained for a short period of time. Now, the Great Sanskrit Light that came from the space crack was almost too dazzling, as if it was going to change the entire Dark Region into the Light Region.
<br><br>
It meant only one thing, and that was Elvinia's abilities had improved.
<br><br>
"A purified being?" Hans gasped.
<br><br>
His originally enlarged eyes glinted with anxiety.
<br><br>
Zen noticed it, and wondered what Hans was worried about. Before he could ask about it, Hans' eyes closed shut and he fell straight down.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed into slits as he looked up at the huge crack in the sky.
<br><br>
He suddenly felt curious. "How could the crack be filled with Great Sanskrit Light? What kind of world is inside?" he muttered.
<br><br>
Even Elvinia couldn't answer the question, and unfortunately it was also impossible for him to explore the crack now.
<br><br>
He was still in the Dark Region and didn't know how long the crack would be there. Once it closed, the Dark Region would probably be back again.
<br><br>
Without Hans' disturbance, the thunder wings on his back spread out once more. Zen sped up in the air and quickly left the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The other members of the Star Falcon race had seen Zen and Hans enter the Dark Region, but they didn't expect such a strange thing to happen. When they saw Zen fly back with the help of the thunder wings, all the Star Falcons immediately flew away in all directions.
<br><br>
Zen didn't plan on chasing and killing them anyway.
<br><br>
Now that Hans, the chief of the Star Falcon race was dead, all the other things could be easily solved.
<br><br>
Just as the Star Falcons had flown away, the crack in the sky slowly healed, and the incandescent light gradually disappeared into the crack. The Dark Region had engulfed the originally white-colored area, and it was once again covered in darkness.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen saw the endless darkness envelope the space in front of him, something popped up in his mind. The Dark Region and the Light Region belonged to two different areas, but he didn't know how the Dark Region came into being.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
Zen's thunder wings let out a sizzling sound. He flew up towards the Heavenly Dark Mountain and Earthly Dark Mountain at once.
<br><br>
When he passed through the ridge that was connected to the two mountains, he saw Clyde and Raul, as well as Elvinia who was in Raul's huge palm.
<br><br>
Zen frowned and immediately flew down.
<br><br>
The two creatures of the Other Shore, Raul and Clyde, did not react at all until now.
<br><br>
They just stayed there with dull expressions on their faces. "What happened to Elvinia?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Well, you can blame it on what happened just now. She used too much of her strength," Raul said and pointed up at the sky far away. "So, she fainted."
<br><br>
Placing his hand on Elvinia's forehead, Zen detected that her soul wasn't damaged and her breathing was even. He was relieved. Afterwards, he gently lifted her off Raul's palm and put her on his back.
<br><br>
"Let's go back and discuss the thing further!" As he spoke, he spread out his wings and flew towards the direction of the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Just like that, the battle with the Star Falcon race ended.
<br><br>
Zen had originally thought that things would've gone simpler. It turned out that he had underestimated the creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Another day had passed.
<br><br>
The atmosphere was busy as the strong warriors of the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race gathered together in the City Guard House.
<br><br>
A creature from the Other Shore stood in the front of the hall. He looked like a human being even with his blue skin, long hands and feet, and the long beard on his face that touched the ground.
<br><br>
"Who is this?" Zen asked upon seeing the strange creature. "He belongs to the Riverside race," Clyde answered respectfully.
<br><br>
There was a time when Zen heard that the Riverside race belonged in the Myriad Spirits City before.
<br><br>
Later on, they moved to the Sky Water City. All of them were known for being skillful craftsmen.
<br><br>
"The Riverside race? From the Sky Water City?" Zen asked. "Sir, all the members of the Star Falcon race have fled back to the Sky Water City after they were defeated.
<br><br>
Now, the Sky Water City is in a mess, and our race is also suffering. Please send people to drive the Star Falcon race out of the Sky Water City!" the man from the Riverside race pleaded.
<br><br>
Overall, the creatures of the Other Shore in the city had lived in peace when the Star Falcon race had controlled the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
Yet, the Star Falcon race suddenly became weak, so the races they had suppressed naturally started to rebel. Some races even intended to eliminate the whole Star Falcon race, as proof of their surrender to Zen, just like what the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race had done before.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the members of the Riverside race were born to be fond of peace and calm life, and didn't like to fight with other races. That was why the man from the Riverside race had rushed to the Myriad Spirits City, in hopes that Zen would occupy the Sky Water City right away.
<br><br>
"Sir, we, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race will go to the Sky Water City. There's no need for you to go there in person!" Clyde added hastily.
<br><br>
Zen casually glanced at Clyde, then was able to read his mind.
<br><br>
The Star Falcon race had lost its core leaders after Hans and Garth died. As a result, their fighting capacity was reduced by several levels. Zen could now conquer the Sky Water City quite easily.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Elvinia had been in a coma since she returned to the City Guard House. Thus, Zen wasn't in the mood to besiege the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
Besides, he wasn't in a hurry--but the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race were extremely anxious! Of course, he would leave Stage Fourteen sooner or later. By then, the two races would work together to control the Sky Water City and the Myriad Spirits City. That was what they had been dreaming of for so long. In the past, they could only fantasize about such a thing. Now that they already had a foundation to realize their dreams, what else could they do but pursue them? To wipe out the Star Falcon race, the Guide Weasel race had most likely instigated the Riverside race to seek help from Zen.
<br><br>
"In this case, you can go there and fight," Zen said faintly.
<br><br>
His words were like a king's decree as Clyde and Raul quickly lit up with excitement. In a snap, they were gone along with the man from the Riverside race.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before the news about the defeat of the Star Falcon race and Hans' death had spread throughout the Sky Water City. At that time, most of the members of the Star Falcon race tried to stabilize and comfort the other races of the Other Shore in the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
When dusk came, six members of the Star Falcon race quietly left the Sky Water City and flew south.
<br><br>
Many great races in the Source World had chosen to establish their strongholds in the Myriad Spirits City or the Sky Water City, but there were some exceptions.
<br><br>
For example, the stronghold of Pear Hill wasn't located in either of those cities, but at another area in Stage Fourteen. After a while of flying in the air, the six members of the Star Falcon race finally landed on top of the Pear Hill stronghold.
<br><br>
Chapter 3539 Evil Plot It was true that not all of the strong races established their strongholds in either the Myriad Spirits City or the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
In fact, many of them chose to open up a gathering place in the wilderness of the Other Shore, and founded their strongholds there. It was dangerous, but it gave them more freedom.
<br><br>
For instance, the Pear Hill's stronghold in Stage Fourteen was in the wilderness not far from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Since the Pear Hill had settled there, some relatively weak races and even some creatures from the Other Shore had also moved to the same place.
<br><br>
After half a chaotic era had passed, their stronghold had grown to a certain size and formed a small town.
<br><br>
The six Star Falcons soared up above the town, their huge bodies covered in the darkness. Only the starry gems shone brightly on their chests.
<br><br>
If one didn't look carefully, the bright dots in the sky looked just like equally-distanced stars, instead of the actual Star Falcons that were flying up above.
<br><br>
In the town below, a white-haired ape was observing the six stars.
<br><br>
The ape came from the White Ape race in Stage Fourteen. The White Ape race used to live in the Sky Water City, but later on they became an enemy of the Star Falcon race due to some conflicts. At last, they were even driven out from the city.
<br><br>
In these years, the White Ape race had been working hard to return to the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
The ape, however, didn't exactly know about the chaos that had been happening in the Sky Water City over the past few days. He only knew that someone from the Star Falcon race had contacted him and asked for help. If he succeeded, then the whole White Ape race could return to the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
It was truly a great opportunity for the White Ape race! This ape had been staying in the small town for a long time, so he had a good relationship with the Pear Hill. Moreover, he had helped some of the Souls of Light from the Pear Hill when they had been in trouble.
<br><br>
When he was done gazing at the six stars in the sky, he looked at the stronghold of the Pear Hill and said, "The White Ape race has helped the Pear Hill a lot. Now, it's time for you to repay us..."
<br><br>
Afterwards, he walked straight into the Pear Hill's stronghold.
<br><br>
As the Pear Hill members were familiar with the White Ape race, none of them stopped the ape when they saw him.
<br><br>
The ape entered the inner area, where he found a member of the Snake Goddess race from the Pear Hill. Her name was Naomi, and she was the leader of the Snake Spirit Sect. She had been at the Chaotic Source Realm for over a hundred years.
<br><br>
Recently, she had returned to Stage Fourteen to guide the members of the Pear Hill who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
"Whitehead, what brings you here?" Naomi asked. The ape, which they called Whitehead, sported a mysterious look.
<br><br>
"The Other Shore Key to the Sun Crown Temple in the north has emerged.
<br><br>
As far as I know, that temple hasn't been explored for two chaotic eras. It's a huge chance!" he announced.
<br><br>
Naomi was touched upon hearing the ape's words, and she became a little excited.
<br><br>
Ever since her members who had recently reached the Chaotic Source Realm got to Stage Fourteen, the Pear Hill also had been short of resources.
<br><br>
If she could lead her members to explore this temple in secret, then they would surely be able to resolve their burning needs. "But who has the key?"
<br><br>
Naomi asked.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Key to a temple that had been sealed off for countless years would surely be expensive if it had appeared.
<br><br>
Just then, Whitehead reached out his fluffy hand and thin lines appeared on his palm. "The Other Shore Key is here, but this time the White Ape race needs to earn some. Whoever from the Pear Hill wants to get to the temple has to pay one hundred thousand soul pills," he explained.
<br><br>
"Okay," Naomi answered without hesitation.
<br><br>
A hundred thousand soul pills were absolutely a good deal. She waved her tail to summon a woman, who left the Other Shore and informed the members of the Pear Hill to return to the Other Shore as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Whitehead secretly cackled in his mind when Naomi agreed so frankly.
<br><br>
He didn't care about those soul pills, and the Other Shore Key he spoke of was absolutely fake. In reality, his goal was to deceive her.
<br><br>
At Naomi's announcement, the members of the Pear Hill who were at the Chaotic Source Realm continuously assembled in the stronghold. The majority of them had snake tails and were from the Snake Goddess race, while the others were humans.
<br><br>
As the Pear Hill members continued to appear, Whitehead also kept an eye on them.
<br><br>
The goal of the Star Falcon race was to capture a human woman called Yan.
<br><br>
Thus, he needed to ensure that she was on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
At the sight of the dozens of human Souls of Light that were in the stronghold, Whitehead suddenly smiled and said, "I've heard that many new talents of Pear Hill have entered the Desire World this time.
<br><br>
Congratulations!"
<br><br>
Naomi felt a bit confused. The creatures on the Other Shore rarely paid attention to the matters in the Source World because they were destined to stay on the Other Shore their whole lives. Yet, Whitehead appeared to know her race well.
<br><br>
Despite her uncertainty, she politely replied, "Yes, they are very talented.
<br><br>
They are promising." "Is Yan in the stronghold now?" Whitehead abruptly asked.
<br><br>
Now, Naomi was even more confused. Yan had just entered Stage Fourteen not long ago. How did Whitehead know her? Still, she didn't think too much about the ape's intentions. She pointed towards the two human women nearby and said, "She's there."
<br><br>
As soon as Yan and Natalie heard that a temple would be opened, they quickly came to the Other Shore together. Those who had just entered the Desire World were surely eager to get a good Other Shore Token, and of course, Yan and Natalie were no exception.
<br><br>
One of the best ways for them to get such Other Shore Tokens was to explore temples. "What's wrong?" Natalie glanced at Naomi and asked.
<br><br>
Beside her, Yan blinked and looked at the white-haired ape, as she too felt that something was off.
<br><br>
At that moment, Whitehead's body unexpectedly flashed, and a handful of green sand appeared in his hand. He ran over to them and sprinkled the sand on both Yan and Natalie.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Yan and Natalie didn't even try to dodge. When they realized what had happened, the Soul Restraining Sand was already firmly stuck on their Souls of Light.
<br><br>
The commotion somewhat stunned all the other Souls of Light present, including Naomi. Then she angrily hissed, "Whitehead, what are you doing?"
<br><br>
It was known that on the Other Shore, the acts of throwing things like the Soul Restraining Sand, the Soul Interdicting Water, and the Soul Binding Thread to other beings were seen as a declaration of war. The White Ape race, however, were in good terms with the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Thus, Whitehead had no reason to specifically attack Yan and Natalie at all.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." Whitehead apologized as he retreated out of the stronghold. At the same time, he waved his long white arms in front of him.
<br><br>
"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the six huge Star Falcons came down and stood upright behind Whitehead. Their sharp eyes emitted a ferocious and cold aura.
<br><br>
As for Whitehead, he just continued to apologize, "I'm sorry, guys. I have to do this for the sake of White Ape race. I have to obey them…"
<br><br>
Some of the members of the Pear Hill reacted quickly. When the Star Falcons landed, many Souls of Light from the Pear Hill had left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The others retreated as they wanted, but the Soul Restraining Sand stopped Yan and Natalie.
<br><br>
"The Star Falcon race! We, the Pear Hill, have no conflict with you! Don't mess around! Otherwise... " Naomi shrieked. She could have left at her own will, but she stood in front of Yan and Natalie.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
Before she could finish her words, a starry sword pierced her Soul of Light, passing through the space between Yan and Natalie, then finally penetrating the wall of the stronghold.
<br><br>
"No, Naomi!"
<br><br>
Natalie and Yan screamed as they saw Naomi's Soul of Light collapse.
<br><br>
Chapter 3540 Sent To The Dark Region The stronghold of the Pear Hill was very safe, as far as Yan and Natalie knew.
<br><br>
It had been a while since they entered the Desire World. Since they had no need to enter the Myriad Spirits City, they never got the chance to come into contact with any of the rather rebellious races on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
All the races in the small town were relatively gentle and peace-keeping.
<br><br>
They also treated the Souls of Light of the Pear Hill as equals.
<br><br>
When Yan and Natalie saw the Star Falcons, they were a little worried about their aggressiveness, but never did they expect them to kill Naomi instantly.
<br><br>
Their senior's death was far too much for the two. Instead of feeling scared, they were terribly heartbroken.
<br><br>
"Why?" Yan stared blankly at the dispersing Soul of Light, unable to do a thing.
<br><br>
A Star Falcon dashed into the Pear Hill's stronghold and examined the area, finding a few bold members of the Pear Hill standing in the corner.
<br><br>
"We don't wish to kill anyone," he said. "Yan Luo is all we want—this has nothing to do with the people of the Pear Hill. Where is she?"
<br><br>
Still processing the situation, Yan was about to answer on instinct, but Natalie stepped forward before she could and claimed the name. "I am Yan Luo."
<br><br>
Natalie didn't want to take the risk.
<br><br>
The Star Falcon gave no reason for wanting Yan, but she couldn't let them take her away.
<br><br>
Behind her, Yan was stunned speechless.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, the Star Falcon took one look at Natalie and burst into booming laughter. "Take these two away!"
<br><br>
Once the Star Falcon left the stronghold, two wings came in from the outside. Yan and Natalie were taken to the back of a Star Falcon.
<br><br>
And so the six Star Falcons flew into the air and left the small town.
<br><br>
Watching their figures receding in the distance, Whitehead from the White Ape race finally sighed deeply in relief.
<br><br>
He still felt guilt, but he had always believed that what he did was for the sake of the White Ape race.
<br><br>
By the time the Star Falcon race completed the plan, the White Ape race could return to the Sky Water City and restore their previous glory with the Star Falcons' support. By then, Whitehead would be considered a hero.
<br><br>
"Where are we going? The Star Falcon race is closely related to the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Do you know who we are? Do you want the Pear Hill to annihilate the Sun Crow race?"
<br><br>
With piercing eyes, Natalie threatened the Star Falcon from atop his back.
<br><br>
While the Sun Crow race was also considered a super force, they weren't quite strong enough to fight against the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
But no matter what threats Natalie spewed, the Star Falcons didn't seem to pay her any mind. They remained silent throughout the entire journey.
<br><br>
Soon, they reached the edge of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"It's the Dark Region!" Natalie cried out when she saw the vast darkness.
<br><br>
Yan raised her head to take a look. By then, she was still numb with sorrow —she couldn't accept Naomi's death.
<br><br>
When she was in Stage Thirteen, Yan had seen the Dark Region, but never had she entered it, nor did she know much about it. The area was a complete mystery to her. Even the Souls of Light and the creatures on the Other Shore believed they'd surely die if they entered it.
<br><br>
Upon reaching the edge of the Dark Region, the Star Falcons flew down.
<br><br>
"What do you want?" Natalie asked, this time, a little more helpless and wary.
<br><br>
"We'll take you into the Dark Region," said a Star Falcon plainly.
<br><br>
"Enter the Dark Region? If you want to kill us, just do it. Why bother sending us in there?" There was some panic in Natalie's voice. She knew that if they entered the Dark Region, they wouldn't come out alive.
<br><br>
Not bothering to say any more, the Star Falcon flapped his wings, materializing two fruits.
<br><br>
"Swallow them! Absorb them into your souls! With these, you'll survive in the Dark Region," ordered the Star Falcon.
<br><br>
Initially, Natalie had planned to resist. But thinking of the boundless Dark Region, she figured she had to compromise.
<br><br>
Yan, however, didn't resist at all.
<br><br>
Once the two of them integrated the Darkness Fruits into their souls, they found the Dark Region not as dark as it once was. Their eyes widened as they realized that they could actually see its interior.
<br><br>
As the Dark Region grew clearer, Nathalie screamed—several black monkeys were staring straight at the girls, crowded together near the edge of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Head inside!"
<br><br>
The Star Falcon waved his great wings, and Natalie dashed into the Dark Region, Yan stumbling behind.
<br><br>
Because they didn't eat the Darkness Fruit, the six Star Falcons couldn't see anything in the Dark Region. But that didn't matter much—they only needed to send Yan into the appointed place.
<br><br>
"We must now inform that man in the Myriad Spirits City…" one of the Star Falcons said thoughtfully.
<br><br>
The Star Falcons couldn't deny how deep their hatred was for Zen. They wanted to chop him to pieces.
<br><br>
But both Garth and their leader had been killed by Zen—they understood that they were no match for him.
<br><br>
"Who will do it?" he asked once again.
<br><br>
They were aware that Yan was Zen's sister. If Zen knew that Yan was in their hands, the one who went to him as a messenger would be risking getting killed.
<br><br>
"I'll go," said the shortest Star Falcon.
<br><br>
Their race had reached a dead end. Now, all they could do was sacrifice themselves in desperation.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The starry gems in the Star Falcons' chests flickered with brilliant lights.
<br><br>
"May the starlight be with you."
<br><br>
"May the starlight be with you."
<br><br>
Once the Star Falcons sent out their blessings, the shortest one flew toward the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Elvinia had been stuck in a coma for an entire day and night before she opened her eyes. She struggled to open her eyes, looking haggard.
<br><br>
Naturally, it took great energy to activate the crack in the light. Even the most powerful purified beings couldn't do it as they pleased.
<br><br>
Just as Elvinia was struggling to get up, a pair of hands gently held her shoulders down before she heard Zen's voice. "Don't move. You just woke up. You're exhausted. You have to have a proper rest."
<br><br>
Elvinia's lips quirked up as she heard the guilt in Zen's voice.
<br><br>
The moment was rather enjoyable on her end—she was hoping Zen could owe her even more in the future.
<br><br>
Before Elvinia could say anything, a Guide Weasel burst in. "Sir, I have something to report!"
<br><br>
Both Zen and Elvinia frowned at the news. "What is it?"
<br><br>
"A Star Falcon has descended outside the City Guard House. He's requesting to see you," replied the Guide Weasel.
<br><br>
"A Star Falcon asked to see me?" Zen was stunned. Was the Star Falcon race ready to admit defeat? Since it had come to this, it was meaningless to admit defeat. Even if Zen wanted to merely let go of the Star Falcon race, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race weren't about to let them off so easily.
<br><br>
But Zen went straight to the gate anyway.
<br><br>
Standing at the gate was the Star Falcon. Seeing Zen, he said, "Your sister, Yan, has been sent to the Dark Region."
<br><br>
Chapter 3541 Set Off What the Star Falcon had said pierced like a dagger into Zen's chest.
<br><br>
His eyes immediately widened, blazing with anger and a thirst for blood.
<br><br>
And even though the man who had delivered the message already knew the possibility of death, he couldn't help but tremble at the sight of Zen's change in expression.
<br><br>
Initially, Zen had a firm belief that the Pear Hill was a good place for Yan to be taken care of. After all, they had strength that surpassed the Oneness Sky Palace. Even the super forces, like the Sun Crow race, did not dare cross a line with them.
<br><br>
However, Zen proved to be a little naive.
<br><br>
Because Zen's and Elvinia's corporal bodies were growing to be more and more threatening, the four big races would do anything to get rid of them.
<br><br>
Moreover, the connection between Yan and Zen had been revealed when they were in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
That gave the four races an advantage to lure Zen and Elvinia into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
As planned, they attacked Yan even before they proved Thad's identity to be Zen. Their rough, unethical tactics just proved that they were in a hurry to kill him.
<br><br>
Several members of the Guide Weasel race grew worried as they had sensed Zen's strong, powerful aura. They had so many questions; If Zen was a member of the Oneness Sky Palace, didn't that mean his sibling was a member too? And if so, why was she captured by the Star Falcon race at such a critical time? "What do you want?" Zen asked firmly, but in a hushed tone.
<br><br>
Because the Star Falcon race used Yan to threaten him, this probably meant that his sister was safe for the time being.
<br><br>
In actuality, taking Yan as a hostage was not the idea of the Star Falcon race —it was the Sun Crow race's. That was a problem for Zen, who just wanted to know what it would take for them to release Yan safely.
<br><br>
"Poor Zen," the Star Falcon scoffed, "you should probably ask the Guide Weasel race and the Giants to withdraw their troops first."
<br><br>
The Guide Weasel race and the Giants, led by Clyde and Raul, were headed towards the Sky Water City. Because the Star Falcon race had weakened, they were in no place to suppress these races. If these two races stepped foot into the city, it would ultimately lead to the annihilation of the Star Falcon race.
<br><br>
"If I do so, will you let go of Yan after they retreat?" Zen asked, making sure that it was not a trick.
<br><br>
"If you want to save Yan, you'll have to make your way to the Dark Region yourself," said the Star Falcon.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed. He sneered at the man before him. "Then why would I ask the Guide Weasel race and the Giants to retreat?"
<br><br>
Though in deep distress, Zen had a point. The initial purpose of taking Yan was to send Zen into the Dark Region, and nothing else. Asking the two races to retreat was not supposed to be part of the arrangement.
<br><br>
"Zen, if you don't do that.. your sister will die!" the Star Falcon hissed, threatening Zen even more. There was a flash of panic in his eyes, but it only lasted for a second. Zen was determined to save his sister by all means.
<br><br>
Lowering his head and closing his eyes, Zen thought hard. Then he turned his head saying, "Notify Clyde and Raul and tell them that I have asked them to come back."
<br><br>
"Sir..." a Guide Weasel trailed off, hesitant to go through with the orders.
<br><br>
"Do as I say," Zen ordered, and his voice was tense and stern.
<br><br>
The Guide Weasel shuffled off right away, ready to fulfill Zen's order.
<br><br>
Afterwards, Zen turned to the Star Falcon and said, "I know that your purpose is to send me to the Dark Region. And even if they don't withdraw the troops, I am certain that my sister won't die."
<br><br>
Hearing Zen's words sent the Star Falcon in a state of anxiety. How could he catch a lie that had been so strategically planned out? "So, tell me," Zen demanded calmly. "Who kidnapped my sister in the Dark Region?"
<br><br>
"It was... It was the black monkeys," the Star Falcon replied, refusing to lie even anymore.
<br><br>
"Well then, you may go now," Zen uttered without looking back.
<br><br>
The other Guide Weasels followed him, and they made their way into the City Guard House.
<br><br>
At the beginning of his mission, the Star Falcon intended to meet Zen with the idea that he could die. He had no idea that Zen wasn't even going to lay a finger on him. Soon enough, his nervousness eased and he noticed that he had been sweating in fright the whole time.
<br><br>
"Splash..." His sweat dripped.
<br><br>
In a hurry, he spread his wings and left the Myriad Spirits City in a panic.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the City Guard House, Elvinia was concerned as she saw Zen enter with a look of irritation on his face. "What happened?" she asked soothingly.
<br><br>
Zen waved the question off and extended his hands towards her, "Hand me the candles and the Darkness Fruits."
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyes widened, "Are you going to the Dark Region?" Candles and the Darkness Fruits were the keys to entering the Dark Region, but she could not comprehend why Zen would want to return to such a horrible place.
<br><br>
"Just give them to me," he snapped, "and stop asking so many questions!"
<br><br>
The last thing he wanted to do was stress out Elvinia, who needed a lot more rest. Zen intended to go to the Dark Region alone.
<br><br>
However, Elvinia would not back down for anything. A cold expression crossed her face and she gripped hard onto her space ring, "Whatever you're going there for, I'll go with you."
<br><br>
The ring was in Elvinia's keeping, and Zen would only be able to have it if she let him.
<br><br>
Zen narrowed his gaze on her and expressed with all seriousness what had happened outside the City Guard House.
<br><br>
Being such a smart individual, it took her no time to absorb everything Zen said.
<br><br>
The plan was simple—since the Sun Crow race assumed that creatures of the Other Shore could not deal with Zen, they were going to have him tortured in the Dark Region instead.
<br><br>
"Did they not recall that Dark Region creatures stand no chance against me?" Elvinia chuckled in confidence.
<br><br>
Though creatures in the Dark Region were a thousand times stronger than those in the Light Region, she was unafraid of them. She was the bane of the Dark Region creatures.
<br><br>
"Either they don't know about it, or they have other plans for you," Zen pointed out. "Like putting you against another purified being."
<br><br>
Apparently, there happened to be another purified being within Stage Fourteen. This being was said to be far stronger and more powerful than any ordinary living creature on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"But if that purified being stood on their side, he or she would have already come to kill us, right?" Elvinia went on, trying to figure out what would happen.
<br><br>
Purified beings had the ability to freely travel through both the Light and the Dark Regions. If they had a purified being on their side, they should not have gone through the trouble to lure Zen and Elvinia into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Zen was frustrated that he couldn't grasp their plan. "Whatever." He shook it off. "Let's just go to the Dark Region first. We need to find those black monkeys first!"
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia had already come into contact with the monkeys when they were at Stage Thirteen. They were chased and attacked by them, and almost died at the hands of those pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
At that time, Zen was weak. He did not have the power to put up a fight against them, but this time, he was different.
<br><br>
They were more prepared than ever.
<br><br>
About an hour had passed and they went through the ridge in between the Heavenly Dark Mountain and the Earthly Dark Mountain. Eventually, they arrived at the edge of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
When Elvinia was just about to light up the Dark Region, Zen suddenly lifted his arm and stopped her.
<br><br>
"We're here to save my sister," he whispered. "Don't make too much noise."
<br><br>
Yan was in the hands of ruthless, unforgiving creatures. If they had found out that he was already in the Dark Region, they might kill her soon.
<br><br>
They had to attack by surprise.
<br><br>
Thus, each of them ate a Darkness Fruit before stepping into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
They had to be stealthy and careful, especially based on their past experience. Elvinia had opened the crack of light before, and all the Dark Region's creatures within a radius of a hundred miles were destroyed. This left the place deserted and burnt to a crisp; Zen had seen it with his own eyes that day.
<br><br>
Elvinia was stunned to see her power, and the consequences of her actions.
<br><br>
It was at that moment that an electric light shocked her mind, and opened a crack in the sky. She fainted when the crack opened, and that was the end of it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3542 The Green-skinned Men They traveled dozens of miles in the Dark Region before the surrounding scenery gradually returned to normal.
<br><br>
A number of dark plants formed a boundless jungle.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia made to pass through the dense jungle when the branches of the plants began to shake.
<br><br>
One single branch might not be strong, but thousands of branches could entangle even a strong prey to death.
<br><br>
These branches were now considering Zen and Elvinia as potential preys and were preparing to attack them.
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyes flashed as she glared at the approaching branches. "You're about to turn to ash. Excited, are you?" she asked, venom dripping her voice.
<br><br>
These demonic plants were sentient and could think. Elvinia's threat caused them to rapidly shrink away, like ants fleeing in all directions.
<br><br>
The plants had formed a clump in the middle of the jungle, making it difficult to cross. But at Elvinia's threat, they began to part, forming a convenient path as they fell to ground.
<br><br>
"That's more like it," Elvinia sneered and walked forward, her head held high.
<br><br>
Zen smiled and shook his head at her back. It was obvious that these creatures in the Dark Region were terrified of Elvinia.
<br><br>
Once they passed through the dense jungle, they saw dark, high mountains loom up ahead of them. The tops of the mountains seemed to graze the sky, but because of the darkness, they could not tell how high these mountains actually were.
<br><br>
The first thing they had to do after entering the Dark Region was to find the black monkeys.
<br><br>
But they were difficult to find since there was no intelligent creature around.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia traveled for a distance along the mountains' lengths when they spotted fire in the distance.
<br><br>
The only thing apart from the Great Sanskrit Light of a purified being that could produce light in the Dark Region was a candle. The light that they could now see was probably produced by a candle.
<br><br>
They approached the light cautiously and as they had expected, spotted a candle not far from them.
<br><br>
The ignited candle sat in an open space, burning alone.
<br><br>
The power of the candlelight could not be compared to that of the Great Sanskrit Light or the natural light in the Light Region, but it was still threatening to the creatures in the Dark Region. Unless they ate the Light Fruit, they could easily be hurt if they were within the candlelight's range.
<br><br>
It seemed like someone had intentionally put this candle here, though they didn't know who and why.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia remained silent as they hid, observing the candle and its surroundings.
<br><br>
It was not long before rustling sounds could be heard through the darkness.
<br><br>
A huge cricket-like insect, which was nearly three feet tall, jumped out and moved towards the candle.
<br><br>
Going by the fearless way in which it entered the candle's periphery, the insect seemed not to be afraid of the candle.
<br><br>
The gentle yellow light of the candle began to work on the insect, causing it to erode more with every passing second.
<br><br>
In no time, the surface of the insect's body had become mottled, and its thin limbs had fallen off its body. It wasn't long before it fell with a thud in the candlelight.
<br><br>
The candlelight still worked on the big insect's body. If no one interfered, it would eventually disappear in the candlelight.
<br><br>
But a small loop of rope suddenly shot out and wrapped around the insect's body and pulled it out of the range of the candlelight.
<br><br>
All this happened very quickly, as if done by someone that was quite skilled.
<br><br>
Before Zen could react, the big insect had already been pulled into darkness.
<br><br>
"There must be an intelligent creature behind. Let's go and find it!" Elvinia whispered into Zen's ear.
<br><br>
The intelligent creatures living in the Dark Region must know the whereabouts of the black monkeys.
<br><br>
Elvinia made to walk towards where the insect had disappeared, but Zen reached out and grabbed her hand.
<br><br>
The risks in the Dark Region were much greater than in the Light Region.
<br><br>
They had to be vigilant no matter what. He said, "Let's wait and see first."
<br><br>
They stayed where they were, keeping an eye on the candlelight.
<br><br>
Minutes later, they could hear more rustling sounds from the grass.
<br><br>
This time it was a big black centipede that was about a dozen feet long that was creating the sound. The centipede raised its long slender body to observe the candlelight before unhesitatingly crawling forward towards it.
<br><br>
It met the same end as the cricket-like insect. .
<br><br>
A loop of rope shot out again and tied itself around the body of the centipede before dragging it towards the grass.
<br><br>
The big centipede was tenacious and struggled as it went.
<br><br>
While the big centipede struggled, Zen followed the course of the rope and spotted a big, dark green hand pulling at it from the grass. He didn't know which race this creature was from, but he was sure it wasn't one of the black monkeys.
<br><br>
"They're just using the candlelight to catch weak insects. Nothing interesting here," Elvinia said, bored.
<br><br>
"Let's go around it then," Zen said, nodding.
<br><br>
They weren't out to hurt anyone and shouldn't be viewed as enemies. They just wanted to make some inquiries.
<br><br>
Just as Zen stood up, something in the sky began to buzz.
<br><br>
Dozens of huge wasps circled in the air above them and shot towards Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Their bodies were colored brilliantly, making it obvious that they were highly poisonous.
<br><br>
"Hide behind me!"
<br><br>
Zen pulled Elvinia behind him.
<br><br>
He then turned and stretched out a hand to slap at the wasps.
<br><br>
His strike was so quick that the poisonous wasps were immediately smashed into pieces.
<br><br>
They had barely dealt with the poisonous wasps when they found giant spiders and foot-long colored centipedes making their way to them on the grass nearby.
<br><br>
Zen was not afraid of these poisonous insects, but the appearance of these strange insects caused Elvinia's hair to stand on end.
<br><br>
Had she not been afraid of alerting the enemy, she would have released massive amounts of Great Sanskrit Light to burn off all the poisonous insects in this area.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia had no choice but to retreat from their hiding place. The moment they did so, two green-skinned men rushed out of the grass, moving nimbly as they did.
<br><br>
They had dark red hair that looked like weeds and looked terrifying.
<br><br>
The men had emerged, throwing loops of rope towards Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia looked at each other. A tacit understanding passed between them and they did not dodge the rope loops.
<br><br>
The green-skinned men were overjoyed to see that their targets were easily trapped. But before they could tie up the ropes, they felt an irresistible force coming from the other end of the ropes. They were being dragged towards Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men realized that something was amiss and were about to drop to the ground, intending to jump into the grass. But the moment they did so, they felt two tiny rays of white light flashing past the corners of their eyes. Sharp pain pinched at their feet. Looking downwards, they discovered that the light rays had pierced their feet and they were now firmly nailed to the ground.
<br><br>
Chapter 3543 The Dark Nether Bugs The two light rays were condensed at high speed.
<br><br>
To the creatures in the Light Region, they were almost harmless, but to the creatures in the Dark Region, they were lethal.
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men stayed frozen to their spot, unable to move at all. If they attempted to flee, the light rays would slice them in half.
<br><br>
Elvinia walked forward with a grim expression. She was about to ask why the two dared to attack them, but abruptly stopped in her tracks. Turning to smile at Zen, she said sweetly, "You ask."
<br><br>
Zen nodded. Taking a step forward to face the two green-skinned men, he said, "We're just passing by. Why did you attack us?"
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men looked Zen up and down. Compared to Elvinia, this man didn't look so scary.
<br><br>
One of the green-skinned men opened his mouth and squeaked. He gestured with his hands, trying to explain himself. But Zen shook his head, unable to understand a word he said.
<br><br>
"You don't speak the human language?" Zen frowned.
<br><br>
The human language was commonly used both on the Other Shore and in the Source World. It was quite rare for a creature to be unable to speak it.
<br><br>
"If you don't speak the human language, then you are of no value to us. Go to hell!" Elvinia spat, her eyes flashing coldly.
<br><br>
While Elvinia was very conscious of her image around Zen, these two green-skinned hooligans were getting on her nerves.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Countless light awls extended from Elvinia's fingertips, like shining fingernails. Just as they were about to hit one of the green-skinned men, he hurriedly cried out, "Don't kill me! Don't kill me!"
<br><br>
Elvinia stopped. Turning again to smile at Zen, she said sweetly, "You ask."
<br><br>
Zen nodded, but he was secretly amused by Elvinia's behavior. He could tell that Elvinia was trying to make a good impression on him.
<br><br>
"So, you do speak the human language. Tell me. Why did you try to attack us secretly?" Zen asked once more.
<br><br>
"We're insect catchers," one of the green-skinned men answered. "We are trying to catch the Dark Nether Bug. If you stay here, you will scare it away. Then our tribe will be damned!"
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men were skilled at catching insects. After setting up a candle, they had used a special method to cover up their own auras.
<br><br>
If other insects showed up, they would have captured them too, but their ultimate goal was to catch the Dark Nether Bug.
<br><br>
"Please let us go. We really need to catch the Dark Nether Bug," another green-skinned man pleaded pitifully.
<br><br>
"Withdraw the light," Zen said to Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia rolled her eyes and reluctantly tapped her finger. The light that pinned down the legs of the two green-skinned men vanished in an instant.
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men let out a sigh of relief. But before letting them go, Zen asked, "I want to inquire about something. In the Dark Region..."
<br><br>
As Zen spoke, suddenly a wind began to blow from the gloomy forest nearby. The crowns of the trees swayed ominously, and a strong scent of blood permeated the air.
<br><br>
"What's that smell?"
<br><br>
A strange expression appeared on Zen's and Elvinia's faces when they smelled the blood.
<br><br>
As the metallic scent filled their nostrils, their heart beat quickened. For some reason, they felt a hint of desire for that blood.
<br><br>
"It's the Dark Nether Bug!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God! It's coming!"
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men's faces turned ghastly pale. One of them flipped his hand, and a bamboo tube appeared. Pouring some brown powder from it onto his palm, he begged Zen and Elvinia, "The Dark Nether Bug is the key to our survival. It has a keen sense of smell. If it smells you, it will flee immediately." Raising his powder-covered palm to the two humbly, he asked, "Please, let me sprinkle this powder on your bodies!"
<br><br>
The other green-skinned man bit his lip anxiously, while eyeing the gloomy forest before them.
<br><br>
After a while, Zen slowly nodded.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! After the green-skinned man sprinkled the brown powder, he asked Zen and Elvinia to hide in the grass on the other side. In a low voice, he whispered, "I don't know what you two want to know, but after we capture the Dark Nether Bug, we'll definitely oblige you."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the trees in the dense forest in the distance parted to both sides.
<br><br>
A bug emerged from the forest.
<br><br>
The bug was completely white, with a crystal clear shell. Through the transparent shell, they could see its blood vessels pumping steadily.
<br><br>
The bug was not big, roughly half a person high. But even so, it was releasing such a powerful aura as it crawled forward.
<br><br>
The moment their eyes landed on the bug, the strange feeling in Zen's and Elvinia's hearts grew stronger. Strangely enough, their stomachs began to growl, as though they were starving.
<br><br>
"It's strange..." Zen was very surprised. He had long forgotten the feeling of hunger, since he had stopped eating completely. Yet now, he stared at the bug as though it was the most delicious thing his heart desired.
<br><br>
But he quickly managed to suppress this weird feeling.
<br><br>
Elvinia, on the other hand, was different.
<br><br>
Her eyes were fixed on the white bug, as though it had captured her soul.
<br><br>
Opening her mouth slightly, she drawled as though in a trance, "I... I want to eat that bug..."
<br><br>
As she spoke, she was about to stand up, but Zen quickly pulled her down.
<br><br>
"Elvinia, what's wrong with you?"
<br><br>
"Hush!"
<br><br>
the two green-skinned men said anxiously.
<br><br>
Because of this, the Dark Nether Bug that had been slowly crawling forward abruptly stopped. Raising its head to survey its surroundings, its beady eyes darted about vigilantly.
<br><br>
After a while, it let its guard down and continued crawling slowly towards the candle.
<br><br>
One of the two green-skinned men held a long and thin bamboo pole, and the other clutched a rope. Once the Dark Nether Bug crawled into the range of the candlelight, they were ready to catch it.
<br><br>
Zen eyed Elvinia worriedly.
<br><br>
She was still fixated on the Dark Nether Bug. The smell of blood emanating from the bug was a fatal attraction to her.
<br><br>
If it weren't for Zen, she might have pounced on the Dark Nether Bug by now.
<br><br>
"It's almost there! Get ready!" one of the green-skinned men hissed in a low voice.
<br><br>
The other green-skinned man clutched the rope tightly in anticipation. Just as he was about to throw the rope at the bug, the forest trees swayed to the side once more. Three more Dark Nether Bugs emerged, each one twice as big as the first one and as tall as an adult human! When the two green-skinned men saw the three Dark Nether Bugs, their expressions fell.
<br><br>
Their plan had been to catch only one Dark Nether Bug. But now, with the addition of three more, the situation suddenly became extremely complicated.
<br><br>
Chapter 3544 The Enraged Bugs These Dark Nether Bugs were powerful.
<br><br>
As trained insect catchers, the green-skinned men were very familiar with the habits of all kinds of insects in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Those Ghost-faced Centipedes and the Cold Earth Bugs might have looked ferocious and were highly toxic, but the insect catchers always had ways to deal with them.
<br><br>
The Dark Nether Bugs were white and plump, and didn't seem to be harmful. But looks can be deceiving; their strength alone was enough to be ranked first among all the insects in the Dark Region! It was difficult for an insect catcher to capture even one Dark Nether Bug, but now, faced with four bugs, they were at a loss.
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men stood upright in the grass, with miserable expressions. It seemed they had no intention of making a move.
<br><br>
"Why not take action?" Zen asked them through his chaotic energy.
<br><br>
One of them faced Zen piteously and said, "The three other Dark Nether Bugs are adults. They are incredibly powerful. If we tried to catch that larva, we'd be killed for sure."
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men had painstakingly gone to great lengths to prepare for this hunt. And now that they had managed to attract a Dark Nether Bug, they could do nothing about it. Naturally, they were upset.
<br><br>
While they were busy feeling sorry for themselves, Elvinia suddenly cut in and said, "Just do what you need to do. I'll take care of the other three Dark Nether Bugs for you."
<br><br>
The two green-skinned men couldn't believe their ears. This powerful being who, minutes prior, had almost killed them, was now going to help them! This woman was able to release dazzling light, which could penetrate the darkest corners of the Dark Region. If she could help them deal with the Dark Nether Bugs, they would be more than happy.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, frowned slightly. Ever since the Dark Nether Bugs appeared, Elvinia had been acting strangely. Her eyes clearly showed a strong desire for the Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen also had a strange appetite for them, but the appetite soon disappeared after he restrained himself. Now, it seemed Elvinia couldn't control her appetite.
<br><br>
"But I have one request." Elvinia's eyes flashed hungrily. "The three Dark Nether Bugs will belong to me."
<br><br>
"Of course, you can have them!" one of the green-skinned creatures hastily replied.
<br><br>
Their goal was only to catch one Dark Nether Bug. Even though capturing more Dark Nether Bugs would benefit them greatly, it was beyond their capacity and they were satisfied with just one.
<br><br>
Duh duh duh...
<br><br>
The smaller Dark Nether Bug sped up and barged into the area illuminated by the candlelight.
<br><br>
The candlelight usually eroded all the creatures in the Dark Region, but the moment its light hit the Dark Nether Bug, something unexpected happened.
<br><br>
Under the pale yellow candlelight, some part of the skin of the Dark Nether Bug had been corroded, and at the same time, it began to shrink. The blood vessels in its transparent body began to glow with bright red light. It seemed to have absorbed a portion of the candlelight into its body! When the Dark Nether Bug got close to the candlelight, it stopped and let itself bathe in the light. The blood streaks in its body shone brightly.
<br><br>
The other three Dark Nether Bugs followed suit. They stopped after they entered the area of the candlelight and enjoyed bathing in it.
<br><br>
The two green-skinned creatures exchanged glances then nodded. One of them used his hand to put some medicinal powder with strong spicy aroma onto the rope. Suddenly, he threw the spicy-smelling rope towards the smallest Dark Nether Bug in the candlelight.
<br><br>
His throw was surprisingly accurate; the loop instantly tightened around the head of the Dark Nether Bug.
<br><br>
After realizing it was caught, the smallest Dark Nether Bug struggled desperately. Even though it was nothing but a larva, it was strong enough to make the two green-skinned men struggle to restrain it.
<br><br>
But as the spicy medicinal powder on the loop took effect, the bug gradually stopped struggling. Its body grew numb and stiff, till it lay motionless on the ground.
<br><br>
The two green-skinned creatures quickly reeled in the rope, dragging the bug through the grass.
<br><br>
Woo...
<br><br>
When the other three Dark Nether Bugs discovered that their littlest companion had been captured, the blood streaks in their bodies spread furiously. The original white, fat bugs turned to blood red in an instant.
<br><br>
After the two green-skinned creatures put the Dark Nether Bug into a special bag, they cautioned Elvinia, "Master, the three Dark Nether Bugs have already reached a furious state. Please be careful!"
<br><br>
They were well aware how terrible it would be to feel the wrath of a furious Dark Nether Bug. As they spoke, they clutched the bag containing their prize tightly, ready to flee if need be.
<br><br>
However, Zen put his hand on the bag. "We can deal with the three Dark Nether Bugs, but you two can't leave now. Don't forget what you promised."
<br><br>
Zen still had to ask them about the black monkeys. How could he let them go now? The two green-skinned creatures sighed.
<br><br>
If they stayed, they already knew the terrible outcome if the two humans were killed by the Dark Nether Bugs. Now that they finally caught the Dark Nether Bug, it was only natural they wanted to escape.
<br><br>
But with Zen's hand firmly clutching the bag, they found that they couldn't move at all! While Zen was speaking, Elvinia had already rushed out.
<br><br>
It was more accurate to say that it was this physical body of the purified being that wanted to devour the bugs than Elvinia's own desire to do so. The consciousness that this body naturally emitted affected her own judgment, which made her believe that such desire was generated from her own instinct.
<br><br>
"Woosh, woosh, woosh..."
<br><br>
The blood streaks that were flowing within the bodies of the Dark Nether Bugs trembled, then the bugs suddenly spurted out rays of blood radiance from their backs. Ten rays shot towards Elvinia at lightning speed.
<br><br>
Elvinia hardly expected that the blood radiance would come at her so quickly. Gritting her teeth, she tumbled on the ground, having narrowly avoided that sudden strike of blood radiance. However, before she could recover, one ray of blood radiance shot through her left shoulder. The body of the purified being was pierced clean through, leaving a hole the size of a fist on her shoulder. For a moment, blood dripped from the hole.
<br><br>
"Elvinia!"
<br><br>
Zen cried anxiously.
<br><br>
He had been under the impression that Elvinia was powerful enough to deal with these bugs effortlessly. He never expected she'd get injured. No wonder the two green-skinned insect catchers were so afraid. It turned out that once these white and fat Dark Nether Bugs were enraged, they were extremely powerful beings in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to rush into the battle, Elvinia held up her hand, indicating she was fine. Suddenly, she bent down and raised both her hands.
<br><br>
White light beams shot out from her hands, forming two swords with blades hundreds of feet long. Clapping her hands together, the two swords of white light slashed at the three Dark Nether Bugs before her.
<br><br>
With Elvinia's strength, she could have easily destroyed these Dark Nether Bugs by simply using the Great Sanskrit Light.
<br><br>
But she had concerns. On the one hand, she was determined to eat the Dark Nether Bugs. If the bugs melted and evaporated under the Great Sanskrit Light, she would have nothing to eat. On the other hand, the Great Sanskrit Light would spread far away in the Dark Region, which might alert other ferocious beasts.
<br><br>
Phew! Phew! The white light swords were formless and they could extend or contract according to Elvinia's will. The speed at which they slashed at the ground was astonishing.
<br><br>
Before the three Dark Nether Bugs could react, their bodies were swept by the long white light swords. In the next moment, they lay on the ground lifeless.
<br><br>
Upon a closer look, Zen could see a thin crack on their bodies. They had been sliced in half so cleanly.
<br><br>
When the two green-skinned creatures saw that Zen wanted to rush up to help, they thought of seizing the opportunity to escape, but before they even had a chance to take one step forward, they witnessed Elvinia easily killing the three adult Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
Both of their jaws dropped to the ground. Who was this woman? Chapter 3545 The Food For Purified Beings The green-skinned men were the weakest creatures in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
They had little understanding of how harmful the light rays were.
<br><br>
As expected, light rays could erode their bodies easily.
<br><br>
On the other hand, while the Dark Nether Bugs were very powerful creatures in the Dark Region, they were not very intelligent. The greenskinned men would lure the Dark Nether Bugs with candlelight and then capture them with overpowering drugs.
<br><br>
Otherwise, they couldn't even face the Dark Nether Bugs head on. They would have to retreat.
<br><br>
But Elvinia had cut down three powerful Dark Nether Bugs in an instant! The two green-skinned men were astonished.
<br><br>
Elvinia stepped into the range of the candlelight without hesitation after killing the Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
"Be careful! The candlelight!"
<br><br>
"The light will erode you!"
<br><br>
the two green-skinned men called out to Elvinia urgently.
<br><br>
They had earlier wanted to run away, afraid they might get killed by the Dark Nether Bugs. But there was no need to retreat now that the threat had been extinguished. Now, they wanted to stay to get on Zen and Elvinia's good graces.
<br><br>
The green-skinned men had never seen creatures from the Light Region before. For them, everything from the Light Region was incomprehensible and untouchable.
<br><br>
Both Elvinia and Zen were from the Light Region, so of course light did not harm them.
<br><br>
The green-skinned men realized this as Elvinia stepped into the light.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"She is unfazed by the candlelight! Has she eaten the Light Fruit?"
<br><br>
They stared wide-eyed, marveling at Elvinia.
<br><br>
Except for the Dark Nether Bugs, they knew no other creature who could remain unscathed by the candlelight. Even the ground itself would be corroded if the light shone long enough. But here came this woman, stepping into the light like it was nothing! Elvinia's eyes were fixed at the dead bodies of the Dark Nether Bugs as she stepped into the illuminated area.
<br><br>
The strong smell of blood filled her nose. The temptation grew even more irresistible. She strode toward one of the bodies, buried her hand into it, and pulled out blood vessels.
<br><br>
Before Elvinia could put them into her mouth, Zen quietly appeared by her side, staying her hand.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" Elvinia asked in confusion.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "I know you want to eat this, but try to hold off until we're certain it's safe," he said.
<br><br>
After all, they had no idea where the Dark Nether Bugs came from and whether they were poisonous or not. One couldn't just consume them carelessly.
<br><br>
"But..." A look of pained frustration crossed Elvinia's face.
<br><br>
Her bodily instincts were telling her these Dark Nether Bugs were her food.
<br><br>
But Zen's words made her snap out of it. How could she eat such disgusting things? Elvinia felt torn between impulse and reason.
<br><br>
At that moment, one of the green-skinned men stood at the edge of the illuminated area. "The Dark Nether Bugs are inedible. They are fatally poisonous to us, especially their blood. If we eat it, we bleed to death," he warned.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Zen's resolve to stop Elvinia just grew stronger.
<br><br>
Elvinia put down the bloody mess, but she continued to look wistfully at it, unwilling to part from it. She looked miserable, as if she had just been deprived of the most delicious food.
<br><br>
"Well, if you can't eat the Dark Nether Bugs, why do you capture them?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, turning to the two green-skinned men. They had worked so hard on the Dark Nether Bugs' capture. They must have some value to them.
<br><br>
"These bugs are for the Royal Monkey race. Of course we can't eat them.
<br><br>
Even if they were for us, we wouldn't dare eat them," one of the greenskinned men explained.
<br><br>
"The Royal Monkey race?" Zen raised his eyebrows slightly. "You mean the black monkeys in the Dark Region?"
<br><br>
When the green-skinned men heard Zen's description, their faces turned pale. "Don't call them that! They'll kill you!" one of them hissed anxiously.
<br><br>
It seemed that the Royal Monkey race was quite influential in the Dark Region. The green-skinned men were terrified of them even when they weren't around.
<br><br>
Zen frowned. "Then what will the Royal Monkey race do with the Dark Nether Bugs? Are they the ones who eat them?"
<br><br>
"Of course they don't eat them either," one of the green-skinned men said.
<br><br>
"The Dark Nether Bugs are highly poisonous to all living creatures, except to our stage ruler, for whom they are a delicacy. That is why we have to turn in the Dark Nether Bugs we capture to the Royal Monkey race."
<br><br>
"Your stage ruler?" Zen and Elvinia shot each other a look.
<br><br>
"Yes, the most powerful being in the whole world!" A look of piety crossed the green-skinned men's faces.
<br><br>
The green-skinned men were natives in the Dark Region. They didn't know much about the outside world. The Dark Region was their entire world.
<br><br>
They had no idea of the existence of the Other Shore or its stages. Neither did they know of the Source World.
<br><br>
In their minds, the stage ruler was the most powerful existence, and therefore, the one god.
<br><br>
Although they were coerced to capture Dark Nether Bugs for offerings, their resentment only extended to the Royal Monkey race, who made the direct demands. They had no hatred for their stage ruler at all.
<br><br>
But Zen and Elvinia knew that this stage ruler was nothing but a purified being in a stage of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Since the stage ruler could eat the Dark Nether Bugs, most likely, so could Elvinia.
<br><br>
Seeing Elvinia's eyes brighten up at this realization, Zen shook his head again. "You can store these Dark Nether Bugs in your space ring first. Once we confirm they are safe to consume, I would let you."
<br><br>
If the stage ruler constantly needed to consume the Dark Nether Bugs, it probably meant they were good for purified beings. But they had to be sure.
<br><br>
Once they verified this, Zen himself would recommend Elvinia consume them.
<br><br>
It took Elvinia a great deal of effort to suppress her instincts. She activated the space ring and waved it lightly over the bodies, which were immediately absorbed.
<br><br>
The green-skinned men had never seen a space ring before. They were once again dumbfounded when the carcasses disappeared.
<br><br>
Once the bodies were stored away, the smell of blood also gradually disappeared. Before long, Elvinia felt a little better, the impulse having subsided.
<br><br>
Zen stared steadily at the green-skinned men. "Do you bring the captured Dark Nether Bug to the Royal Monkey race yourselves?"
<br><br>
"No," one of the green-skinned men answered, shaking his head. "We're not allowed to enter their territory."
<br><br>
"The Royal Monkeys will come pick up the Dark Nether Bug tomorrow.
<br><br>
That's why our Insect Master race has deployed hundreds of insect catchers.
<br><br>
We will be in great trouble if we can't deliver," the other green-skinned man continued.
<br><br>
For the Royal Monkeys, the Insect Master race's lives had no value at all.
<br><br>
All they were good for, they thought, was catching the Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
Chapter 3546 Royal Monkeys Since Zen found the clues regarding the black monkeys, he did everything he could to not let the opportunity slip through his fingers. Immediately, he proposed on accompanying the two green-skinned creatures.
<br><br>
Unaware of the ongoing feud between Zen and the black monkeys, the two creatures happily agreed to his offer with gratitude.
<br><br>
Because the creatures were familiar with the area, not a single dangerous encounter occurred throughout the journey with them leading the group.
<br><br>
Zen even managed to learn more about the Insect Master race through them.
<br><br>
The Insect Master race was a low-level race in the Dark Region. They lived by catching, raising, and taming insects.
<br><br>
The two green-skinned creatures were insect catchers. Once they brought them back, they'd forward them to experts known as "insect raisers" that would be responsible for rearing them.
<br><br>
After a certain period, they would then be relayed to the expert insect tamers.
<br><br>
The insects that had previously attacked Zen and Elvinia were the ones that the Insect Masters had tamed.
<br><br>
Mercer, the smaller green-skinned creature, and Miller, the taller one of the two, were brothers. They were elated knowing that they successfully and safely captured a Dark Nether Bug. Once they brought it back for their entire race to see, they'd be welcomed and hailed as heroes by the whole Insect Master race.
<br><br>
After they advanced along the black mountain range for two hours, there was a huge crater in front of them. And in the crater, there were some messy steps.
<br><br>
As they descended to the base of the rickety-looking staircase, they were met with densely-packed caves that flanked them on both sides.
<br><br>
Numerous green-skinned creatures slipped in and out of the caves alongside numerous insects.
<br><br>
These insects came in various, strange shapes and had vicious looks plastered on all their faces. Despite that, they were all obedient in this col.
<br><br>
Once Miller and Mercer made their entrance, they lifted the bag they brought with pride and shouted in unison, "We've captured a Dark Nether Bug! We've caught one!"
<br><br>
Instantly, all the green-skinned creatures dropped what they were doing and looked towards the duo's direction.
<br><br>
The col had been enveloped in a deep depression.
<br><br>
The Royal Monkey race was looming over everyone's heads like a guillotine ready to slaughter anyone who disobeyed. Over the past few days, the insect catchers failed to capture a Dark Nether Bug. If they still didn't catch one tomorrow, they would have nothing worthy to offer the Royal Monkey race.
<br><br>
Five years ago, a similar situation occurred wherein no one could successfully capture a Dark Nether Bug. As punishment, the Royal Monkey race slaughtered nearly half of the Insect Master race. This time, failure might mean the total annihilation of their entire race.
<br><br>
With Miller and Mercer's successful capture, everyone in the col cheered with joy and relief.
<br><br>
Numerous green-skinned creatures emerged from the caves to gather around the duo for a closer look.
<br><br>
As the two of them untied the bag, the Dark Nether Bug was revealed— barely mature, sleeping soundly, and totally unaware of the situation.
<br><br>
Roar! Howl! No one knew who first started the roar. Wherever it came from, it managed to trigger all the green-skinned creatures to roar as well—a deafening whole reverberating along the cave walls and into the valley.
<br><br>
With the roar continuing, a few of the green-skinned creatures came up with a black plate onto which they carefully placed the snoozing Dark Nether Bug and then they carried it away.
<br><br>
By then, Mercer silenced the entire col with a quick wave of his hand.
<br><br>
"Now," he began to speak, "we are saved thanks to these two guests. Let us prepare a nice treat for them!"
<br><br>
Everyone began to cheer loudly once more.
<br><br>
All of this noise didn't sit well with Elvinia. In fact, she wanted to drag Zen away right then and there and leave.
<br><br>
They came here to get more information about the black monkeys, not to get stuck and witness the lives of a race in the lower class.
<br><br>
Zen pulled Elvinia aside to stop her from leaving. "We're not leaving," he informed her with the shake of his head. "We're staying here until tomorrow."
<br><br>
Realizing her pouting was useless, she finally gave in to his orders and agreed to stay.
<br><br>
The Insect Master race concurred that a grand feast must be held to entertain Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
To their dismay and horror, all of the meals served were anything but appetizing—filled with bugs, larvae, and eggs that no human would consume unless they were desperate. Zen politely refused each offer they made.
<br><br>
Here in the Dark Region, the transition from day to night wasn't conspicuous. As outsiders to the Dark Region, Zen and Elvinia barely noticed when dawn turned to dusk, unlike the Insect Masters. Silence suddenly passed among all the Insect Masters.
<br><br>
Both Zen and Elvinia ate a Darkness Fruit in secret as they waited quietly in the dark.
<br><br>
Eight hours later...
<br><br>
The sound of sudden, heavy footsteps came from the other side.
<br><br>
"Clack clack clack clack..."
<br><br>
They sounded like hooves.
<br><br>
Zen squinted and raised his head towards the direction where the sound came from. A band of black monkeys riding on horseback came into view.
<br><br>
The black monkey that led the group gently pulled his horse's mane. This caused the horse to neigh loudly and raise its chest and hooves to the sky. A bright, red light burst from the hooves just as the horse brought them back down to the ground—right on the edge of the col.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
As the entire col began to shake under the power, the two caves directly below the horse began to collapse. All the green-skinned creatures that resided in the caves were now trapped underneath the debris.
<br><br>
As the tremors began to worsen, all of the green-skinned creatures came out of hiding. Flustered and frightened, they all diverted their attention towards the creatures riding on horseback who were responsible for this destruction —the Royal Monkey race.
<br><br>
A few of the green-skinned creatures dropped to their knees and bowed towards the Royal Monkeys, hoping that would help to slightly suppress their rage.
<br><br>
"Have you caught the bug we wanted?" the Royal Monkey at the helm asked in a high-pitched voice.
<br><br>
"Yes! We have, Master Royal Monkey!"
<br><br>
A group of green-skinned creatures momentarily left to retrieve the black plate and carry it towards the Royal Monkeys. The plate was now decorated and in the middle of the plate appeared the fairly young Dark Nether Bug, still sound asleep.
<br><br>
They climbed up the slope on the side of the col as they delivered their offering.
<br><br>
The Royal Monkey glanced at it and said, "One isn't enough. I want two."
<br><br>
"Two?"
<br><br>
"For many years, one is enough. How come this time we have to hand in two?"
<br><br>
"But we only caught one Dark Nether Bug!"
<br><br>
The green-skinned creatures' faces turned pale. It was useless trying to reason with these monkeys. Already, they were imagining in their minds the consequences that they would bestow on their race.
<br><br>
"This time is different. Our stage ruler is ravenous. What? Can't you offer another one?" A hint of coldness could be felt in the Royal Monkey's voice now.
<br><br>
The Royal Monkeys thought that these green-skinned creatures were useless now. Why keep them alive when they could easily reproduce hundreds or thousands more incompetent beings into this world? If they couldn't hand in one more Dark Nether Bug, then that would give enough reason for them to kill these creatures off.
<br><br>
An eerie silence fell over the green-skinned creatures, fearing that a single sound uttered would just enrage the Royal Monkey even further. No one dared to answer his question.
<br><br>
Miller and Mercer also looked anxious. There were three Dark Nether Bugs in Elvinia's hands, but the stage ruler only ate living Dark Nether Bugs and would not touch any dead ones.
<br><br>
If only they'd known this would happen, they would've stopped Elvinia from killing all of them. Oh how they wished to turn the tables right then and there! Neither of them knew that even if they had two in their hands, the Royal Monkeys would still require them to offer a third one. As the old saying went, "He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick."
<br><br>
Just as all of the green-skinned creatures were about to give up, Zen's voice floated up from the bottom of the col. "I have what you want—another Dark Nether Bug."
<br><br>
Chapter 3547 Punishment Cold sweats trickled down the foreheads of Miller and Mercer in response to their growing anxiety after they heard Zen's words.
<br><br>
Zen would have to pay the consequences with his life if he were to present the Royal Monkey race with the dead Dark Nether Bug.
<br><br>
Giving in to his worries, Mercer nudged lightly at Zen's shoulder and spoke in a hurried voice, "Friend, what they want is a living Dark Nether Bug, not a dead one."
<br><br>
Zen smiled faintly and whispered back to him, "Don't worry. I am talking about the living Dark Nether Bug."
<br><br>
"Do you have a living Dark Nether Bug?" Mercer's eyes widened as he took a step back. His gaze fell on Elvinia who smirked and gave her space ring a confident tap. Soon, a Dark Nether Bug the size of half a mortal fell from it and planted itself on the ground.
<br><br>
Where on earth did she get ahold of the Dark Nether Bug? Mercer and Miller stood with their heads tilted to the side as they displayed conflicted expressions of shock and confusion.
<br><br>
As far as they remembered, the three Dark Nether Bugs that were the size of an adult were killed.
<br><br>
Moreover, they remembered that both Zen and Elvinia had no idea of what the Dark Nether Bug was. Then how were they able to catch one? There was something else that made them suspicious about the whole scenario.
<br><br>
As they studied the Dark Nether Bug before them, they realized it was not drugged to remain as calm as it was. Normally, this would contradict with its usual irritable nature. Why was it displaying its utmost obedience now? "Don't ask any questions. Just hand it over," Zen whispered in a low tone that was only audible to them.
<br><br>
Despite their doubt reigning over their existence, Mercer and Miller obediently placed the Dark Nether Bug on the iron plate. Then they crawled out from the foot of the col and sent it on its way to the Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
Since Zen and Elvinia kept their appearances disguised, the Royal Monkeys were oblivious of their presence.
<br><br>
With a quick scan, the head of the Royal Monkeys studied the Dark Nether Bug and pouted in disappointment. A Royal Monkey stationed beside him received the Dark Nether Bug with careful hands. With a cold snort, the head turned around and left with his subordinates.
<br><br>
Demanding a second Dark Nether Bug was supposed to be an excuse for the Royal Monkey race to obliterate the Insect Master race. However, they never expected the Insect Master race to possess one. Since they couldn't ask for a third one, they had no other option but to retreat.
<br><br>
After the Royal Monkey had led his team for a certain distance, he suddenly looked around and shouted, "Zimba! Linus! Respond to my call!"
<br><br>
"I'm right here!"
<br><br>
"I'm here!"
<br><br>
After hearing his command, two tall black monkeys riding on horseback appeared from both sides, each burly and strong in appearance.
<br><br>
"Those Insect Masters have caught two Dark Nether Bugs, but they intended to hide one from us. It is unforgivable. As a form of punishment, I want you to dispose of half of them!" the Royal Monkey snarled in a cold voice devoid of all emotions.
<br><br>
"Your wish is my command, Sir!"
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Zimba and Linus rode their horses and headed towards the col where the Insect Masters resided, each in charge of six Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
As they watched the Royal Monkeys leave their territory, the Insect Masters' tensed nerves relaxed as they loosened their stiff bodies and let out a sigh of relief. They were certain they would have died today had it not been for Zen's intervention when he brought out the Dark Nether Bug.
<br><br>
Naturally, they eyed him up with gleaming eyes filled with gratitude.
<br><br>
With the assistance of others, a respectable insect raiser approached Zen as he walked out of his cave. When he stood before him, he lowered his gaze, knelt down with humility and said, "Thank you for saving our race. We are deeply grateful."
<br><br>
"Don't mention it." Zen held up the insect raiser to turn his gaze towards him and continued, "As far as I could tell, the Royal Monkey race was desperately searching for an excuse to finish you off. Although you avoided it for now, you might not be so lucky next time."
<br><br>
As if Zen had struck a nerve with his comment, uncontrollable tears flooded the eyes of the insect raiser as he wept bitterly. "We are no match for them in terms of competence. What else could we do except letting them slaughter us?"
<br><br>
Continually overshadowed by the overpowering presence of the Royal Monkey race, the Insect Master race felt helpless and miserable. The Royal Monkey race could kill them as they saw fit.
<br><br>
Mercer seized the chance and inquired Zen about his previous doubts, "Where did you get that Dark Nether Bug? As far as I can tell, you shouldn't have any in your possession at all."
<br><br>
Despite thinking on it long and hard, Mercer and Miller couldn't figure out how Zen was able to pull out a living Dark Nether Bug to present to the Royal Monkey race.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen was not going to lay it all bare to them. At their puzzled expressions, he let out a playful chuckle. He planned to diffuse their curiosity with a perfunctory reply when suddenly, the vibrant noise of hooves clattering against the ground of the col reverberated in his ears and alerted him.
<br><br>
Gradually, the sounds of galloping horses approached them at a steady speed as they listened on carefully. The once relaxed atmosphere tensed up once more. Their heartbeats thumped in unison with the sounds of the hooves.
<br><br>
As if they were struck by something that left them in a jolt, their expressions shifted visibly.
<br><br>
Not long after, a dozen Royal Monkeys perching atop their horses stood in a formation at the edge of the col. Leading the march from the front, Zimba shouted with an authoritative voice, "Our general has given an order. The Insect Master race had the intention to hide the Dark Nether Bug. This crime cannot be forgiven, and thus half of you will be killed as a form of punishment!"
<br><br>
Zimba's loud and clear declaration echoed around the walls of the col and announced itself in various frequencies as it bounced back in the ears of the Insect Masters. Upon hearing this, the faces of all the Insect Masters turned as white as a sheet as they reflected fear and vulnerability.
<br><br>
They never expected the return of the Royal Monkeys after they had dealt with them and gave them the Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
"All Insect Masters must come to the valley to accept their punishment!"
<br><br>
Zimba scorned above the col in a stern tone.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Royal Monkey race, the Insect Master race was insignificant and inferior. They viewed them as cowards who lacked the guts to retaliate against them. They used their weakness as a means to force them to obey their orders. The Royal Monkeys didn't even bother to kill them in the col. Instead, they ordered the Insect Masters to obediently come on their own to face their consequences.
<br><br>
The Insect Masters in the col remained glued to the ground. None of them showed any signs of movement to approach the Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
They didn't wish to voluntarily walk into the clutches of death that seemed to be inviting them in the face of the Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
"It seems you wish to die together as a group. Alright then, let me fulfill it for you!" Linus roared as his glare became sharp. He dismounted from the horse and flashed a long and sharp spear-like stick in his hand.
<br><br>
Still rooted in their respective spots out of trauma, the Insect Masters began to tremble in fear at the sight of an angry Linus. At this moment, Zen's voice echoed in their ears as he said, "Just hold on a second."
<br><br>
Zimba and Linus were alerted as Zen made his presence known. They immediately recognized the voice. It was the same voice that declared it had a Dark Nether Bug.
<br><br>
As Zen and Elvinia remained out of sight, they concluded Zen to be one of the Insect Masters. But when the pair made their sudden appearance, the Royal Monkeys in the ranks felt slightly stunned.
<br><br>
"Who the hell are you?" Linus asked as he scanned Zen from head to toe.
<br><br>
The Insect Masters watched Zen nervously as if he were their last ray of hope in terms of survival. He had just swooped in to save them by averting the Dark Nether Bug crisis singlehandedly, so they naturally hoped he would have other methods up his sleeve to persuade the Royal Monkeys to leave once more. Although deep down, they had a feeling it was just their wishful thinking.
<br><br>
As if annoyed by the obvious question, Zen let out an exasperated sigh and spoke indifferently, "If you had left with the other Royal Monkeys, you would have lived long enough to see the next day. It's a pity you chose to return only to seek your own death. Don't blame me for that."
<br><br>
The Dark Nether Bug Zen had offered to them wasn't the real deal. In fact, it was the Shape-shifting Spirit.
<br><br>
Back in the iron house, Zen had picked up the black box and allowed the Shape-shifting Spirit into it. Initially, he had planned to release it in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
But now, Zen was growing impatient in pursuit of getting his sister back, so he was left with no other choice.
<br><br>
Since the Royal Monkey race had demanded a second Dark Nether Bug, Zen materialized the Shape-shifting Spirit into a Dark Nether Bug to act as a replacement.
<br><br>
In the beginning, the Shape-shifting Spirit was hesitant in going by the plan, but it didn't have the strength to oppose Zen and thus caved under pressure.
<br><br>
At the same time, as a preventive measure, Zen asked Elvinia to leave a soul mark on its body so they could later track its location and retrieve it.
<br><br>
But like the Insect Master race, he didn't expect the Royal Monkeys to return so soon.
<br><br>
When Zimba, Linus, and the other Royal Monkeys heard Zen's threat, their faces revealed a hint of mockery as they struggled to suppress their laughter.
<br><br>
Only a few creatures dared to speak to them in this tone in the Dark Region of Stage Fourteen. They wouldn't have believed it had they not heard it with their own ears.
<br><br>
"What did you say? Seek our own death? Foolish human! It's you who's courting your own death!" With a fit of mocking laughter, a conniving smile stretched across Linus' face as he jumped up using his powerful legs as a boost with the long stick in his hand.
<br><br>
The long stick circled in midair and hacked down towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Chapter 3548 Follow Zen Until now, the other Royal Monkeys remained seated on the horseback as their eyes cast playful looks below.
<br><br>
At the top of their group was Linus. The impact of the blow was enough to pulverize Zen into bits of flesh.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Insect Masters immediately felt frightened and scampered away in all directions when they saw Linus jump down. "Run! Right now!"
<br><br>
the old insect raiser shouted at Zen.
<br><br>
He ran towards Zen's direction as he yelled, and then pushed the latter away in order to take the blow instead.
<br><br>
Yet, all the Insect Masters were very clear that no matter what they did, Zen and Elvinia would definitely die.
<br><br>
Still, Zen held on to the old insect raiser with one hand, and reached upward with the other.
<br><br>
When Linus saw that Zen had tried to grab his long stick with his bare hand, he couldn't help but laugh mockingly. Zen was a lunatic. Not only was this guy from nowhere so arrogant, but he was also stupid! 'This blow is enough to smash him into a pile of mud. How dare he take it with his hand?' While Linus thought about it, the long stick had already touched Zen's hand.
<br><br>
Zen grabbed and pulled the stick. Suddenly, his right arm released its strength and stopped the stick from falling.
<br><br>
The other side of the stick endured Linus' power. The entire stick curved like an arch bridge, but it didn't break.
<br><br>
"The stick is good," Zen praised.
<br><br>
Linus stared dumbfoundedly at Zen, not knowing what just happened.
<br><br>
Just then, the stick turned and Linus felt a burning pain in his hands. Zen had taken the stick away! A painful tremor hit Linus' chest right after, and it turned out that the stick had pierced through his breastbone.
<br><br>
The stick started to spin, and Linus' burly body spun as well. A strong surge of Other Shore Power travelled along the stick and as it spun some more, Linus' body collapsed.
<br><br>
Zen grabbed, pulled, and turned the stick. In three simple movements, Linus ended up dead. The whole process took only a few seconds.
<br><br>
To top it all off, Zen's other hand was even holding the trembling insect raiser! The whole col was silent. After all, the Insect Masters didn't think that the two strange visitors who came from far away were terribly powerful, and were able to kill Linus so easily.
<br><br>
Of course, Mercer and Miller lit up with joy. They knew that Zen was a powerful cultivator, but they were still surprised at the strength he had just shown.
<br><br>
Unlike them, however, the Royal Monkeys above the col did not look happy. Their horses smelled the tangy odor of blood in the area and didn't dare to move.
<br><br>
If Zen had killed Linus so easily, it meant that his strength was far beyond their imagination.
<br><br>
Zimba was the quickest to react. He pulled the horse's mane and shouted, "Let's go!"
<br><br>
The Royal Monkeys quickly tried to escape but the second they did so, Zen cried out, "Since you're back, how could you still want to leave?"
<br><br>
"You can't stop us!" Zimba turned around and angrily shot back at Zen, who was in the col. This time, however, Zimba's horse suddenly let out a neigh because it was too nervous and terrified.
<br><br>
Another horse had thrown out the Royal Monkey that sat on it due to its anxiousness.
<br><br>
The horses in the Dark Region were by no means ordinary. In fact, the horses the Royal Monkeys rode were Demonic Blood Horses. They were incomparably strong and had immense fighting power, and there were very few things that they were afraid of.
<br><br>
Thus, Zimba was confused. His eyes narrowed into slits, and then he saw a human woman who stood in front of the horse.
<br><br>
He was still puzzled. Why could this human woman scare his horse to such an extent? Before Zimba could find out the reason, he saw the woman spread her hands, and two beams of blazing white light shone brightly.
<br><br>
Zimba looked at the white light with fear.
<br><br>
As a Royal Monkey, he had spent so many years in Stage Fourteen. He had met the stage ruler and witnessed the Great Sanskrit Light. He clearly knew that everything that the light illuminated would vanish without a trace, as if they had never been in this world.
<br><br>
He was also aware that the Great Sanskrit Light had purified the west part of the Dark Region some time ago. Thus, everything within a hundred-mile radius of it was completely gone.
<br><br>
There were many rumors that attempted to explain the situation. Some said that it was the stage ruler who had done it, while others said that there was something wrong with the stage.
<br><br>
When Zimba saw the white light that came from the human woman's hands, he put the pieces together and came to a realization.
<br><br>
It seemed that it wasn't the stage ruler who had done it, but rather a new purified being who was in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Zimba did not have the chance to bring the news back to his race.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The moment Elvinia flicked her fingers, the white light had touched the horses and the Royal Monkeys. The light swept around only a few times, but the Royal Monkeys and the horses were cut into pieces.
<br><br>
This ability of Elvinia enabled her to make them disappear without a trace.
<br><br>
She, however, had already consumed too much of her power before and had been restraining herself since she entered the Dark Region.
<br><br>
After Zen climbed out of the col, the Insect Masters followed one by one.
<br><br>
They stared numbly at the chopped up body parts on the ground, as they never thought that such a thing would happen. The two humans in front of them had killed the superior Royal Monkeys! Who on earth were they? "Clean this place up," Zen said.
<br><br>
Several insect tamers took out small round boxes and released a swarm of black bugs. The numerous tiny bugs looked like a mass of black sand as they covered the corpses of the Royal Monkeys and the horses.
<br><br>
They had eaten up the bodies in no time, and even the bloodstains on the ground were gone.
<br><br>
"Even if we have cleaned this place up, I'm afraid the Royal Monkey race won't let us go," said one of the Insect Masters with a bitter look on his face. "We will die in a couple of days," Mercer wailed miserably.
<br><br>
More than a dozen Royal Monkeys had died. It was highly possible that the Royal Monkey race would vent their anger on the Insect Masters and kill all of them.
<br><br>
"It won't happen," Zen comforted.
<br><br>
"Why not?" Mercer asked. "Because all of the black monkeys will die," Zen replied calmly. There were some things that he might concede to, but threats to him that involved Yan were not something he could allow.
<br><br>
No matter what kind of force stood behind these black monkeys, he would never give in to them.
<br><br>
Despite his words, the Insect Masters still looked uneasy.
<br><br>
Although he and Elvinia had just killed more than a dozen Royal Monkeys, the Royal Monkey race had many other masters.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen had already sensed the Shape-shifting Spirit's direction, so there was no need for him to stay any longer. He and Elvinia decided to continue their pursuit.
<br><br>
Just as the two of them were about to leave, Mercer and Miller plucked up the courage to ask Zen if they could follow along.
<br><br>
Chapter 3549 The Ghost Wing Bird The two brothers—Mercer and Miller, were determined in following Zen.
<br><br>
Now that the situation became worse, they believed that it was better to pin all their hopes on these two human beings than do nothing. Perhaps, they could really create a miracle.
<br><br>
Luckily for Zen, he had the Shape-shifting Spirit's guidance, so he didn't really need the help of the Insect Master race that much.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Insect Masters were more familiar with the Dark Region than he and Elvinia were, so it actually wasn't bad that the two tagged along with them.
<br><br>
After a while of thought, Zen nodded and said, "It's a pity that Elvinia acted too ruthlessly just now, that none of the horses was left."
<br><br>
"Those Demonic Blood Horses were the Royal Monkeys' exclusive mounts.
<br><br>
Even if they were still alive, they wouldn't let us ride them anyway," said the old insect raiser as he climbed up the col. Then, he took out a small bamboo flute and handed it to Mercer.
<br><br>
In turn, Mercer placed the bamboo flute's mouthpiece by his lips, then gently played it. Soon enough, several black beetles emerged from the cave below the col.
<br><br>
"Those are... Holy Beetles!" The moment Mercer saw the beetles, he got a little too excited.
<br><br>
The Insect Master race raised all kinds of insects, snakes, and ants, and among all of them, the Holy Beetles were the most difficult to tame.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, juniors like Mercer didn't have the chance to control the Holy Beetles.
<br><br>
"Our benefactors can ride these Holy Beetles. Mercer and Miller, you two should take good care of them," the old insect raiser ordered.
<br><br>
Zen could fly even in the Dark Region, but the process was somewhat troublesome.
<br><br>
That was because the Godly Way energy was in conflict with the Dark Region. If he condensed the Thunder Materialization, the darkness would probably damage his pair of thunder wings in an instant.
<br><br>
But since the Insect Master race just gave them the flying mounts, he didn't refuse the kindness.
<br><br>
In a few moments, Zen, Elvinia, Miller, and Mercer each took a Holy Beetle to mount and rode on them. Then, Mercer played the bamboo flute gently, and the Holy Beetles carried them into the dark sky.
<br><br>
As the Holy Beetles flew up to a higher altitude, the visibility in the Dark Region became less clear. The originally dim ground quickly became blurry.
<br><br>
The dark sky was like an endless black hole. When Zen raised his head, he could faintly feel the pressure that the darkness emitted. It felt as if something was spying on him from the endless void.
<br><br>
"Has your Insect Master race ever explored the sky above the Dark Region?" Zen asked curiously. "I haven't seen it before," Mercer answered honestly.
<br><br>
"But according to the records of our Insect Master race, our great ancestor once rode a Holy Beetle into the dark sky!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
"Did he find anything?" Zen asked again. "No," Mercer said with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
He continued, "Our great ancestor never came back. Although the other clansmen all say that he stays in the dark sky, I think he must have died there..."
<br><br>
As a native race in the Dark Region, the Insect Master race had always sought survival in the conflicts between the large races. They were too weak.
<br><br>
The great ancestor Mercer referred to was the greatest Insect Master, who had tamed a powerful insect and thus led the Insect Master race to a brilliant period of development. After the great ancestor had left, however, the remaining insect tamers still could not obtain a position in the Dark Region and therefore, the Insect Master race had declined even more over the years.
<br><br>
"The dark sky..."
<br><br>
According to Zen's understanding of the Other Shore, the stages of the Other Shore were superimposed over one another. It was true since it could also be proved by the things he had seen when he left the Lust World.
<br><br>
Yet, when Elvinia had opened a crack in the sky, wouldn't it mean that there was a crack in Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore? Was Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore on the top of the so-called dark sky? It sounded unexplainable in a spatial sense.
<br><br>
While Zen was deep in his thoughts, the white light in Elvinia's pupils glowed slightly. "Something is following us," she told Zen in a low voice.
<br><br>
Upon hearing her words, Zen, Mercer, and Miller all turned their heads to look around, but they couldn't see anything in the darkness.
<br><br>
Soon enough, they heard the sound of wings flapping, then several huge black shadows came down from above. They turned out to be giant birds, and each of them was about thousands of feet wide! "They are Ghost Wing Birds!" Mercer screamed in fright.
<br><br>
As soon as he saw the huge black shadows above his head, his eyes instantly went wide open in horror and panic overtook him. Miller was no better, as he also went pale with fear like his brother.
<br><br>
As one of the strongest creatures in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, the Ghost Wing Bird had almost no natural enemy.
<br><br>
They flew high in the sky all year round and almost never descended. No one had ever even found a nest of the Ghost Wing Bird. Even a powerful force like the Royal Monkey race would die if they encountered the Ghost Wing Birds.
<br><br>
Both Mercer and Miller had once seen the Ghost Wing birds glide in the sky back when they were in the col. At that time, all the Insect Masters held their breaths and didn't dare to do anything. They didn't move even after the Ghost Wing Birds captured a few of their clansmen, but simply watched them leave in silent distress.
<br><br>
Still, that instance had deeply impressed Mercer and Miller.
<br><br>
The two brothers never expected to encounter such powerful beings especially not shortly after they set out.
<br><br>
"Lower the height," Zen told Mercer.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Mercer was at a loss and didn't know what to do. When he heard Zen's instruction, he tried his best to hold back his fear and played the bamboo flute in his hand. In turn, the Holy Beetles quickly descended.
<br><br>
When the Ghost Wing Birds saw that Zen and his companions go down from the sky, they immediately followed them closely.
<br><br>
Their huge wings were like sails as they flapped continuously. As the Ghost Wing Birds got closer and closer, their appearance gradually became clear.
<br><br>
Brown feathers covered their slender heads, and their eyes were slanted in shape. Overall, they looked rather terrifying.
<br><br>
"Woosh—"
<br><br>
The nearest Ghost Wing Bird stretched out its long and thin beak, then tried to grab Mercer with its mouth.
<br><br>
Compared with the huge body of the Ghost Wing Bird, Mercer was as small as an ant.
<br><br>
"Elvinia, drive them away!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
He knew that Elvinia's Great Sanskrit Light was too blinding in the Dark Region. So, the reason why he had asked Mercer to lower their altitude was not because he wanted to escape, but because he wanted to assist Elvinia in driving those birds away.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
As soon as Zen finished speaking, Elvinia raised her hand. Light swords, which extended up to a thousand feet upward, swiftly shot up into the air.
<br><br>
"Puff, puff, puff..."
<br><br>
Just like shabby canvases, the nearest Ghost Wing Bird's wings were mangled as the light swords instantly pierced through them and left numerous holes.
<br><br>
Of course, Elvinia still wasn't satisfied with the damage she had done. She gently flipped her palm, and the light swords dashed towards the junction between the wings and the torso of the Ghost Wing Bird. It was clear that she actually wanted to cut off the Ghost Wing Bird's wings.
<br><br>
The Ghost Wing Bird felt the sharp stab of pain and desperately wanted to escape.
<br><br>
Elvinia's light swords, however, were too fast for it to dodge. The second the light swords moved, the Ghost Wing Bird's wings immediately fell off, and its enormous body fell heavily from the sky.
<br><br>
Boom! When the other Ghost Wing Birds saw what had happened, they didn't dare to stay any longer. They were afraid that the blazing white light swords might also decapitate their wings, so they flew up and away, then disappeared into the darkness.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Mercer and Miller sat stiffly on the backs of the Holy Beetles, before they finally sighed in relief and wiped the sweat off their foreheads.
<br><br>
They had thought that they would be doomed to death this time, but to their surprise, the human woman's white light swords had defeated the extremely powerful and influential Ghost Wing Birds of the Dark Region with ease.
<br><br>
It almost seemed that these two humans were able to do whatever they wanted in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Chapter 3550 The Splendid Jade Pass To the west of the Dark Region was the Splendid Jade Mountain, and within it was a mountain pass.
<br><br>
Behind the pass was the Royal Monkey race's territory.
<br><br>
It was naturally impossible for the Insect Masters to get through this smoothly.
<br><br>
Ten miles away from the pass, Mercer ordered the Holy Beetles to land in a forest. He turned to the others with a serious expression on his face.
<br><br>
"There should be Royal Monkeys stationed at the pass. I'll send a spy bug to check it out," he said, opening his pocket where a bug flew out.
<br><br>
This bug was the same size as a mosquito and was as light as dust, making it incredibly difficult to spot with the naked eye.
<br><br>
Mercer and Miller were no good at fighting. This was the only way they could help Zen. Just as the bug was about to fly away though, Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
"There's no need." Mercer frowned. "Why not?"
<br><br>
His question went unanswered as Zen turned his attention to Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Follow me," he told her.
<br><br>
The Shape-shifting Spirit had gone far. They both felt it, which meant that the Royal Monkeys' destination was far away from the pass.
<br><br>
They had to be extremely careful around these black monkeys. Yan was still in their hands after all.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, they had to kill the group of black monkeys they encountered earlier, and it was only going to be a matter of time before the other monkeys found out. It was currently a race against time.
<br><br>
'So many Royal Monkeys...' Mercer thought to himself.
<br><br>
Then again he remembered how Elvinia had killed those Ghost Wing Birds before, so maybe a few monkeys weren't going to be a problem.
<br><br>
The pass was currently being guarded by patrolling Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
This was the only entrance to their race's territory, and thus, the security here was top notch and extremely strict. What was more, there had been a rise in the number of Royal Monkeys sent here.
<br><br>
It was already well-guarded but the number of additional patrolmen somehow made the leader of the pass a bit uneasy.
<br><br>
There was no way more Royal Monkeys were sent here to guard the pass for no reason. He wasn't dumb. Trouble was surely afoot for their race! Could it be the one-eyed creatures from before? A couple of years ago, these one-eyed creatures descended upon their pass but they promptly taught them a lesson. Now, they were at the top of the Dark Region of Stage Fourteen. It was impossible for those one-eyed creatures to come here now unless they were seeking death.
<br><br>
Besides, that purified being was currently receiving the best care by the Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
"Chief!" a Royal Monkey on patrol shouted, interrupting the monkey chief's thoughts. "Something's coming!" The warning came as a shock to the monkey chief.
<br><br>
"What did you say?!"
<br><br>
He went out of his quarters, craning his neck to see what his subordinate had spotted.
<br><br>
The sight above them stunned him. "Holy Beetles?!"
<br><br>
These bugs were considered as the Insect Master race's rare treasures. What were they doing here? Did that mean the Insect Masters were here? Why? Were they crazy or something? The chief's eyes narrowed, a trace of anger appearing in their depths.
<br><br>
"Insect Masters! You green-skinned men and your bugs! If you get any closer, we won't hesitate to kill you!"
<br><br>
Insect Masters were cowards by nature, at least to the Royal Monkeys. He figured he'd be able to scare them away through verbal threats.
<br><br>
However, the Insect Masters showed no signs of retreat and continued their approach with their Holy Beetles.
<br><br>
"You're courting death!" the chief roared though he did feel a bit apprehensive about how things were going.
<br><br>
He winked at his two subordinates who immediately drew their javelins from their backs.
<br><br>
Mercer and Miller thickly swallowed when they saw the Royal Monkeys bring out their weapons.
<br><br>
Just as the Royal Monkeys took aim and were about to throw their javelins, a whistle suddenly drew their attention.
<br><br>
The monkey chief turned to find a human man hanging on the wall. "A human?!" he exclaimed in astonishment. "What is a human doing here in the Dark Region?! He also seems to have a physical body!"
<br><br>
Zen's appearance caused quite a shock to the monkey chief. He felt his heart clench when he looked at him. Just a few days ago, a group of elite Royal Monkeys escorted the Souls of Light of two human women through the pass.
<br><br>
Could it be related to this human? His apprehensions lasted only a moment though. "Kill those who break into the pass without permission!"
<br><br>
With his command, the two subordinates raised their arms and threw their javelins towards Zen.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The speed at which the javelins traveled was extremely fast but all it took was a slight twist for Zen to avoid them.
<br><br>
Instead of his body, the javelins firmly lodged themselves deep into the wall. Zen saw it fit to use them as a makeshift chair. "Have you confirmed it?" he said to no one in particular. "Are there no other black monkeys around?"
<br><br>
At the mention of the insult "black monkey," the Royal Monkeys immediately grew solemn. They didn't know who Zen was talking to but a voice answered, seemingly out of nowhere, "No. All black monkeys are here."
<br><br>
Zen smiled and nodded firmly. "Let's do this then!"
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Numerous beams of light appeared from the sky, enveloping the monkeys in the pass.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, they all found themselves obliterated by the power of the Great Sanskrit Light. Once all monkeys were eliminated, the ground on which they once stood melted away and bore a circular hole within the pass.
<br><br>
This let the light eliminate the black monkeys that were still inside.
<br><br>
Among everyone in the pass, only the chief survived.
<br><br>
He was a war veteran and his prestige had him in charge of guarding the Splendid Jade Pass. Now though, he watched as his entire brethren perished from the white light that suddenly fell from the sky.
<br><br>
The only thing in his mind then was confusion. The purified being had attacked them, but why? Why? Why? Why? He tried to come up with a reason but there was none.
<br><br>
Terrified by what he had just witnessed, the monkey chief stood up and poised to run away.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Zen wasn't going to let him go so easily. The only reason he was kept alive was to provide valuable information.
<br><br>
Just as the monkey chief was about to run away, Zen pulled out the javelin he had been sitting on and flew towards his prey. The stick at the end of the javelin hit the chief, hard.
<br><br>
"I want to know something," Zen muttered dangerously as he pinned the chief on the wall.
<br><br>
"As far as I know, you kidnapped the Soul of Light of a human girl."
<br><br>
The monkey chief's eyes flashed knowingly. It was as he had thought. The human was here because of the two girls.
<br><br>
"I-I just..." the monkey chief stuttered, still in a bit of a shock from the entire ordeal. Just as he spoke, dozens of thin light awls descended from above and nailed themselves on his feet, legs, shoulders, wrists, and chest.
<br><br>
On the other side of the city wall was a human woman's figure, the source of these thin light awls.
<br><br>
"The light of the purified being came from this woman," the chief muttered.
<br><br>
He was completely restrained by the awls and the slightest movements could end up with him getting cut into pieces.
<br><br>
"You want to live? Then tell me what I want to know, or else you'll end up like them," Zen threatened, nodding his head at the void.
<br><br>
If the chief didn't comply, he'd end up being obliterated by the Great Sanskrit Light, just like the rest of his race.
<br><br>
Chapter 3551 An Empty City The monkey chief was in fright, as if he'd just come close to a ghost.
<br><br>
At this point, the monkey had no other choice. No one had asked him to keep a secret anyway.
<br><br>
In order to survive, the monkey didn't hesitate for too long. "I can tell you.
<br><br>
But you must let me go. Alive," he said.
<br><br>
"I promise you." Zen nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
"And how about... How about her?" the monkey asked, pointing at Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia saw this and nodded her head in approval, then the monkey let out a sigh before continuing to speak. "A few days ago, there were two human women passing here," he said very carefully. "But they were escorted by the Coldness Monkey Guards."
<br><br>
"What is the Coldness Monkey Guard?" Zen questioned.
<br><br>
"They are the elites of our race and guard the Chief Flag Monkey," the monkey continued. "The Chief Flag Monkey is the commander in chief of the Royal Monkey race in Stage Fourteen. At first, I, too, was curious as to why they brought two human Souls of Light back..."
<br><br>
The monkey went on to tell Zen everything he knew. He even pointed out the location of the Coldness Monkey Guards after asking Zen to take out a map from his pocket.
<br><br>
"Mercer," Zen called out. He had everything he needed.
<br><br>
Mercer, who was riding on a Holy Beetle, gradually flew to Zen and cupped his hands towards him. "Kill him," Zen ordered, pointing at the monkey.
<br><br>
The monkey's eyes widened in shock. What just happened? "You...you promised me!" he screeched.
<br><br>
"Yes, I did." Zen smiled. "But he didn't promise you." After his last word, he jumped down from the pass with Elvinia following right behind him.
<br><br>
Mercer, on the other hand, was stunned to have been given such an order.
<br><br>
But because he was loyal to Zen, he was going to do it either way.
<br><br>
The Royal Monkey had no escape. No matter how powerful he was, he was trapped by the light awls fixed on his limbs. Just like that, he was at the disposal of Mercer.
<br><br>
After thinking for a moment, Mercer reached into his pocket. From here, he took out several black bugs, which struck terror into the monkey immediately. He knew exactly what they were.
<br><br>
These bugs were known as the blood devouring bugs. Just as their name implied, they would drill themselves into the host's body, multiply instantly, and suck every drop of blood.
<br><br>
After the Splendid Jade Pass, the terrain around it gradually opened up.
<br><br>
It allowed for better viewing, that even in the darkness, Zen could spot the low houses from a distance. This was where the Royal Monkeys lived.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen raised up the javelin and gave a good look at the area. He then turned to his map as he tried to identify the place better. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. "The Coldness Monkey Guards mentioned by that monkey are here," he stated. "They are positioned over there!"
<br><br>
Elvinia looked in the direction Zen pointed out. "It's at the same direction of the Shape-shifting Spirit... How can we get in?"
<br><br>
The main goal of their journey was to save Yan, and this should be done without disturbing the Royal Monkeys. To do so, they could not afford to make any mistakes. If the Royal Monkeys held Yan hostage to coerce Zen, Zen might yield to all their requirements.
<br><br>
"I think we can use these," Mercer said, holding out the spy bugs in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Zen smiled and nodded at him in agreement.
<br><br>
With a gentle toss, the bugs flew to the air and vanished into the darkness, heading to where the Royal Monkeys lived.
<br><br>
Five minutes had passed and Mercer was finally able to gather information on the city. But just as he was about to report to Zen, his face shifted.
<br><br>
"No..." he trailed off.
<br><br>
"What is it?" Zen asked with much concern.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry to say this...but the city is completely abandoned," Mercer said.
<br><br>
"None of the monkeys are here!" He believed that his spy bugs would never deceive him.
<br><br>
"How...how is that possible?" Zen hissed, "Did you make a mistake?"
<br><br>
"These spy bugs are always accurate. How could I be wrong?" Mercer answered affirmatively, looking ahead.
<br><br>
Furrowing his eyebrows, Zen looked at both Mercer and Elvinia. "Well, let's go and take a look."
<br><br>
As they entered the city, they finally confirmed that everything Mercer said was true. It was deserted, and no one could understand why.
<br><br>
How could they have left so suddenly? "It seems that the stupid monkey from the Splendid Jade Pass had no idea about this..." Zen said, frustrated.
<br><br>
Elvinia felt Zen's despair and wanted to turn things around. "Let's find the Shape-shifting Spirit first."
<br><br>
Without hesitation, they headed towards the north of the city and began their search using the soul mark. Not long after, they ended up stopping before a wide building.
<br><br>
Zen felt something about the building, so he pushed open the door to investigate.
<br><br>
"Creak..."
<br><br>
The moment the door swung open, whistling sounds travelled through the air.
<br><br>
"Swish... Swish..."
<br><br>
Just then, what seemed like thin, shiny needles began to shoot out from the walls of the building.
<br><br>
Elvinia raised her eyebrows, sensing the trap. All of a sudden, the light in her hand burst out! "Buzz!"
<br><br>
When the needles were exposed to Elvinia's light, they completely vanished. Moreover, when the light filled up the entire building, they heard screams - it was the Shape-shifting Spirit. "No, don't hurt me," it murmured.
<br><br>
"It's me! The Shape-shifting Spirit!"
<br><br>
Instead of stopping, Elvinia radiated the light even more. It grew and grew, protecting both her and Zen.
<br><br>
It was not until the sound of the last needle snapping, that Elvinia stopped.
<br><br>
Finally, the two could clearly see what was going on in the building.
<br><br>
The Shape-shifting Spirit had already returned to its original form, hanging upside down from a rope.
<br><br>
In a haste, Zen suddenly threw the javelin and snapped the rope. "What just happened?" he asked the spirit. "Why were you hung there?"
<br><br>
The spirit let out a sigh. "When I was sent to this city, I was detected..." It was very sullen with what it had just said.
<br><br>
Though it was skilled in morphing itself, it could only be regarded as a pet.
<br><br>
This was because it was not strong enough to go against anyone.
<br><br>
Apparently, after getting beaten up by the Royal Monkeys, it was hung upside down and left behind there.
<br><br>
"They didn't kill me though," the spirit pointed out. "I'm supposedly the bait that would lure you here."
<br><br>
Zen nodded, acknowledging this. After all, the needles were already an attempt to kill him. "But why are all the Royal Monkeys gone?"
<br><br>
"The monkeys mentioned that they could not defeat you because you have a purified being," the spirit explained. "They also said that if you two are looking for the human woman's Soul of Light, you'd find them there." It gestured out, pointing towards a corner in the building.
<br><br>
Across the wall was a poorly drawn map. The place they had to go to was clearly marked.
<br><br>
Analyzing the map, Zen let out a heavy sigh of relief. He then turned towards Elvinia and smiled. "A few days ago, your light had eroded an area of the Dark Region," he said. "I think you've frightened these monkeys! They retreated without us even doing anything!" Zen chuckled.
<br><br>
This was true. In fact, Elvinia could easily kill the entire Royal Monkey race in a rage. At least now, they had gone before she could do anything.
<br><br>
"So what? They can't hide forever," said Elvinia expressionlessly.
<br><br>
"True. But one creature from the Dark Region is not afraid of the Great Sanskrit Light," Zen added.
<br><br>
Just then, everything clicked in Elvinia's mind. Her face froze and her voice lowered. "Their goal is to lure us into facing the purified being of Stage Fourteen."
<br><br>
Chapter 3552 The Black Marsh A vast black marsh stood at the foot of the mountain in the north of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
While the pool was tranquil all year round, an occasional bubble would burst, emitting a deadly poisonous mist.
<br><br>
If it could be avoided, no creature in the Dark Region would willingly approach the black marsh.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! Over ten horses were galloping in the black marsh.
<br><br>
Being able to move at that speed, they were clearly familiar with the area.
<br><br>
It was the elite of the Royal Monkey race, the Coldness Monkey Guards, that rode the horses. In the lead was the Chief Flag Monkey, the race's commander.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss! As the group of monkeys marched forward, a small black snake rushed out from the marsh beside them, trying to bite the Chief Flag Monkey.
<br><br>
Swish! The Chief Flag Monkey's reaction was keen—with a casual wave of his hand, the little black snake had been cut into pieces.
<br><br>
He grabbed the head in his hand and examined it before frowning. "It's poisonous! Be careful!"
<br><br>
The black marsh was known to be a highly toxic place. Any creature that could survive there was not to be underestimated.
<br><br>
Once the Chief Flag Monkey gave his warning, he pulled his horse's mane and led the group forward.
<br><br>
In the middle of the group, the horse carried both Yan and Natalie on its back.
<br><br>
With the strength of ordinary Souls of Light, they weren't even matched against the ordinary creatures on the Other Shore. And those in the Dark Region were far stronger than those in the Light Region—Yan and Natalie didn't stand a chance against them in battle.
<br><br>
"All I know is that the Dark Region is boundless darkness. I didn't expect there to be any complex forces within," Natalie commented, looking around the marsh.
<br><br>
With a frown, Yan said, "I wonder why they bring us here from so far away."
<br><br>
She had nothing to do with the Star Falcon race—why did they suddenly decide to make a move? Along the way, Yan and Natalie tried prodding the black monkeys for answers, but they had no problem ignoring them completely.
<br><br>
Quack! A strange, harsh scream suddenly broke the atmosphere.
<br><br>
They all looked up into the sky to find the source.
<br><br>
Several huge birds swooped down, coming for the Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
"Commander! The Ghost Wing Birds are here!" one of the Royal Monkeys confirmed.
<br><br>
The Coldness Monkey Guards were the most powerful group of Royal Monkeys—both their mentality and strength were far superior to those of ordinary Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
If the other monkeys saw the birds approaching, they would have already been panic-stricken.
<br><br>
"These beasts… They've come to make trouble at the most critical moment!" Coldness came over the Chief Flag Monkey's face before he gave the order, "Disperse!"
<br><br>
"But this is the black marsh…" one of the Royal Monkeys remarked hesitantly.
<br><br>
It was true that the Ghost Wing Birds posed a threat, but the monkeys scattering into the black marsh was nothing short of courting death.
<br><br>
"It's too late. The birds are approaching fast!" another Royal Monkey pointed out.
<br><br>
If they were outside the black marsh, they'd have a way to deal with the birds. But all the creatures were subject to limitations in the black marsh, save for the creatures that could fly, like the Ghost Wing Birds.
<br><br>
"You go first. I will guard the rear!"
<br><br>
When he stopped his horse, the Chief Flag Monkey's armor began glowing with a golden light—his power was accumulating.
<br><br>
This time, the senior leaders ordered for Yan to be brought into the Dark Region and sent to the purified being. The Chief Flag Monkey had to complete the mission, even at the cost of his own life.
<br><br>
Quack! Quack! Quack! Just as the great Ghost Wing Birds swooped down rapidly, the black marsh suddenly shook in the distance, from where a slender snakehead rolled out.
<br><br>
Whoosh! It passed through tens of thousands of feet with accuracy and precision, catching a Ghost Wing Bird instantly.
<br><br>
The creature didn't even have time to respond—it was dragged away by the snake's tongue in mere seconds before it disappeared completely in the depths of the marsh.
<br><br>
Quack! Quack! Quack! The rest of the birds screamed nervously, maneuvering their wings in an attempt to escape.
<br><br>
But the tongue that rolled back shot out rapidly again, sweeping away another Ghost Wing Bird in an instant.
<br><br>
"Da!"
<br><br>
"Da!"
<br><br>
"Da!"
<br><br>
In mere seconds, eight Ghost Wing Birds in the air were completely swept away by the tongue.
<br><br>
Natalie and Yan were stunned frozen by the scene.
<br><br>
They already considered the Royal Monkeys extremely powerful creatures in the Dark Region—never did they expect the creatures to fall to a natural enemy like the Ghost Wing Birds. As Natalie silently relished in the fact that the Ghost Wing Birds couldn't leave the Dark Region, a great tongue dashed out and swallowed up all the Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
Where did the tongue come from? While Natalie and Yan couldn't exactly be optimistic about their fate, they couldn't help but sigh at the scene they had just witnessed—they had no clue what other secrets they might come across on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"It's the stage ruler!"
<br><br>
"The stage ruler has made a move!"
<br><br>
"That was close..."
<br><br>
Surprisingly, the Royal Monkeys seemed excited to see the huge tongue.
<br><br>
The Chief Flag Monkey even rode to the front line and ordered, "Take out the Dark Nether Bugs!"
<br><br>
The ruler of Stage Fourteen did not belong to any force. Over the years, the Royal Monkeys had tried all they could to build a good relationship with the stage ruler, but to no avail—the latter was far too irritable. In the years that they offered Dark Nether Bugs as tribute to the stage ruler, many of them were swallowed up.
<br><br>
Soon, six Royal Monkeys got off their horses and each raised an iron plate above their heads. On the iron plates, Dark Nether Bugs were curling up.
<br><br>
"Slow down!"
<br><br>
"Don't bear any hostility—the stage ruler is very sensitive!"
<br><br>
"Slower!"
<br><br>
The Chief Flag Monkey didn't fail to remind his team members.
<br><br>
And so the Royal Monkeys carried the iron plates, carefully moving step by step. If they moved even slightly too fast, they'd end up being the stage ruler's food just as the Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
Although there were only a few miles ahead, the Royal Monkeys walked for ten whole minutes.
<br><br>
When they reached the edge of a black marsh, the tongue shot out once again and swept over one of the monkeys—along with the Dark Nether Bug above his head, he was dragged into the darkness.
<br><br>
The scene had all the other Royal Monkeys trembling in fear. But they were the Coldness Monkey Guards—they wouldn't shy away from death. None of them had the slightest intention to throw away the Dark Nether Bugs and flee.
<br><br>
"Stage ruler!"
<br><br>
The Chief Flag Monkey hurried over to the edge of the marsh and bowed respectfully.
<br><br>
Having already tasted the delicious Dark Nether Bug, the stage ruler wasn't likely to attack again so soon.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop! From the dark marsh emerged a head covered in spikes of flesh. A pair of orange eyes sat on the sides of the head, the pupils flickering back and forth so fast that they looked like lines. A hoarse voice then resounded. "You're using the Dark Nether Bugs to please me again?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3553 The Bait When Yan and Natalie saw the true face of the so-called stage ruler, they frowned. It was unsettling.
<br><br>
There must be some sort of reason as to why these black monkeys brought them to their stage ruler.
<br><br>
It was not for the first time that the Chief Flag Monkey had encountered the stage ruler. He knew that the Dark Nether Bugs were a kind of food that the stage ruler would not refuse, but it was a well-known fact that the Dark Nether Bugs were very difficult to capture.
<br><br>
The candles that were used to capture Dark Nether Bugs by the Insect Master race, or any other race for that matter, were all supplied by the Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
He had been doing this for so many years, in order to make use of this stage ruler in case of a tricky situation.
<br><br>
"Stage ruler, I have worked hard to collect these Dark Nether Bugs. Please accept them," the Chief Flag Monkey said, bowing deeply.
<br><br>
"Well, tell me, what's your purpose? And why did you bring two Souls of Light?" The stage ruler's eyes fell on Natalie and Yan. As a purified being, he could instantly perceive that the two girls came from the Light Region.
<br><br>
Glancing indifferently at the two girls, the Chief Flag Monkey answered, "These two are also an offering from the Royal Monkey race."
<br><br>
The stage ruler sneered. "You want me to devour the Souls of Light? Well, it's better than nothing..."
<br><br>
When he finished speaking, he stuck his tongue out towards Yan and Natalie. The two girls shut their eyes tight, awaiting their deaths. They knew they were no match for such a powerful being.
<br><br>
Just as the stage ruler was about to devour the two girls, the Chief Flag Monkey suddenly cried out, "Please wait!"
<br><br>
"What?" A dangerous light flashed in the stage ruler's eyes. It peeved him whenever anyone stopped him from eating his food. The only thing keeping this insolent monkey alive was the fact that he had offered him Dark Nether Bugs for many times in the past.
<br><br>
"I offer these two Souls of Light to you, not for you to eat," the Chief Flag Monkey explained carefully.
<br><br>
Looking at the monkey in confusion, the stage ruler asked, "Then, what do you want to do?"
<br><br>
"These two are just bait. They will lure another purified being who is lurking around the Dark Region. I believe that you will be more interested in this purified being," the Chief Flag Monkey continued.
<br><br>
"Another purified being..."
<br><br>
Since he was one himself, the stage ruler of course knew the rules of purified beings very well.
<br><br>
Once he became a purified being, he was bound to this stage of the Other Shore. There shouldn't have been another purified being in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"You know the price you would have to pay if you're lying to me," the stage ruler said, curling up the tongue in his mouth. The killing intent in his eyes was like a solid mist thickening.
<br><br>
As the commander of the Royal Monkey race, the Chief Flag Monkey knew that he had to keep calm. Confidently, he answered, "I dare not lie to you.
<br><br>
That purified being came from Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. We don't know how she entered the Desire World. But just a few days ago, that purified being used the Great Sanskrit Light to erode everything within a radius of a hundred miles!"
<br><br>
The stage ruler fixed his eyes on the Chief Flag Monkey and looked somewhat curious when he saw the monkey seemed quite sure of what he had said. At the same time, he said slowly, "You are so foxy. You can't contend with that purified being, so you want me to fight for you, right?"
<br><br>
Although the stage ruler seldom went outside, he was not stupid after all.
<br><br>
Obviously, the Royal Monkeys wanted to make use of his strength to kill that purified being.
<br><br>
Unflinchingly, the Chief Flag Monkey answered calmly, "I thought you would be interested in another purified being, and... it is true, we are not strong enough to defeat her." With eyes narrowing slightly, he continued, "Stage ruler, if you are unwilling to face that purified being, I will take these two Souls of Light away..."
<br><br>
The Chief Flag Monkey was, however, very certain that the stage ruler wouldn't turn away from this opportunity.
<br><br>
"You've already brought them here, so just let them stay," the stage ruler said hastily.
<br><br>
The Chief Flag Monkey could not help but internally sneer at the stage ruler. He was acting the exact way he had expected him to. Turning to his followers, the Chief Flag Monkey barked, "Send the two human Souls of Light here under escort! And Seal them here!"
<br><br>
After putting down the Dark Nether Bugs, several Royal Monkeys stepped forward and escorted Yan and Natalie down. Another Royal Monkey drew a trap array on the ground. Then Yan and Natalie were pushed into the trap array by the Royal Monkeys.
<br><br>
"Stage ruler, please enjoy the food." The Chief Flag Monkey bowed with a courteous smile on his face. Then, he hurriedly led the other Royal Monkeys away.
<br><br>
The Chief Flag Monkey didn't care which purified being would win and which would lose. He was only afraid that when the two purified beings fought, the heaven and earth would be destroyed as a result, so he didn't want to stay here to find out.
<br><br>
Sitting inside the trap array, Yan and Natalie exchanged silent glances.
<br><br>
Judging from the Royal Monkey's words, they were nothing but disposable bait to lure another purified being here.
<br><br>
"Who on earth is that purified being?" Natalie asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
Yan shook her head, also at a loss.
<br><br>
It had been kept a secret that Elvinia was a purified being. The warriors from the Pear Hill had no idea about this, which was why Yan and Natalie were so confused.
<br><br>
Besides, it never crossed Yan's mind that Elvinia would enter the Dark Region to rescue her.
<br><br>
"Will it be your elder brother?" Natalie suddenly asked, eyes flashing excitedly.
<br><br>
Yan thought for a moment. It wouldn't be a surprise, in a sense, since Zen was always going on adventures and things always seemed to happen to him.
<br><br>
Moreover, it made sense that if Yan was kidnapped, Zen wouldn't hesitate to rescue her.
<br><br>
"No way..." Yan whispered.
<br><br>
Even though she was in grave danger, she didn't want her brother to get into trouble in the Dark Region because of her.
<br><br>
Swish! Suddenly, the stage ruler's long tongue shot out like lightning and curled around a Dark Nether Bug that lay next to the two girls. In the blink of an eye, the stage ruler had sucked it into his mouth. After chewing it thoughtfully, he swallowed it and smiled in satisfaction.
<br><br>
Both Natalie and Yan watched in horror, but there was nothing they could do since they were trapped in the array.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, the stage ruler devoured all the Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
Seeing he had eaten all the food, he sat down on the side of the swamp, eyeing the two girls curiously. "The Darkness Fruits in your bodies could only last for around six hours." Then, he smiled mischievously. "It seems the monkeys were under the impression that the other purified being would come by then."
<br><br>
"I don't know about that," Natalie replied coldly.
<br><br>
The stage ruler just smiled. No longer asking any other question, he waited patiently by the side of the swamp.
<br><br>
Three hours passed by.
<br><br>
The stage ruler's eyes rolled around in a bored fashion, then suddenly, he sat up vigilantly. Looking towards the distance, he let a smile creep on his face.
<br><br>
Without any warning, he opened his mouth and his tongue shot out into the darkness.
<br><br>
Yan and Natalie craned their necks to turn around to look at where the stage ruler was sticking out his tongue, but they couldn't see anything.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The tongue stuck out then retracted, and once again stuck out, retracted...
<br><br>
This went on for a while. However, it was fruitless. On the contrary, bloodstains appeared on his tongue, which had obviously been cut by a sharp weapon.
<br><br>
Yan and Natalie exchanged confused glances.
<br><br>
They wondered who the stage ruler was fighting with. The newcomer seemed so powerful that even the ruler of a stage of the Other Shore couldn't seem to do anything about it, and was instead wounded! Chapter 3554 Confrontation The stage ruler's several attacks failed. What was worse, his tongue was injured by the two people in the distance.
<br><br>
His head that had been bobbing on the surface of the black marsh till just now suddenly rose as he climbed out of the marsh.
<br><br>
Only then did Yan and Natalie realize how big this stage ruler actually was.
<br><br>
"Those monkeys were right. They do have some skills." The stage ruler cocked his head to the side to look at the two trembling girls. "They're trying to save you, aren't they?"
<br><br>
Yan tried to say something, but she was too struck with fear.
<br><br>
Stretching out his huge claw, the stage ruler tried to reach for Yan and Natalie.
<br><br>
The two thought that the stage ruler was going to kill them, so they shut their eyes tight. However, much to their surprise and relief, the claw grabbed the trap array and the soil under their feet. Carefully, the stage ruler tossed them onto his back.
<br><br>
"He... He doesn't plan to kill us?" Natalie cried incredulously.
<br><br>
Yan's eyes were trained on the two mysterious figures. "He's not interested in us. He's interested in the ones flying over there!"
<br><br>
The two figures in the distance had suddenly launched themselves into the air, flying towards them at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
Yan squinted. She couldn't tell who the other one was but she recognized the woman. She was Elvinia from the Oneness Sky Palace! Yan and Natalie had seen her before in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Back then, Elvinia didn't perform well in the Chaotic Source World. Yet now she was able to have a physical body on the Other Shore, and even her appearance could be seen clearly.
<br><br>
"Is she the purified being?" Natalie blurted out.
<br><br>
"I suppose so. But who is the other person?" Yan pondered.
<br><br>
Back in the Chaotic Source World, Elvinia had been following her brother the whole time. It was very likely her companion was no other than Zen.
<br><br>
Narrowing her eyes at the indistinct figure, Yan realized the shape and movement were familiar. "Zen..." she said softly.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
As the two figures in the distance steadily approached, the stage ruler crawled on the ground, cracking his mouth wide open and laughing maniacally.
<br><br>
The laughter echoed in the black marsh like dull thunder. The poisonous creatures that lurked in the black marsh panicked and fled everywhere.
<br><br>
When Zen saw the huge monster in the distance, he frowned slightly.
<br><br>
It turned out that the purified being of Stage Fourteen was actually a huge lizard! Upon seeing the huge lizard, Zen scanned the area. Finally, his gaze landed on the two faint human figures on his back. Even if he was far away, Zen was sure that they were two Souls of Light.
<br><br>
'Yan...' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
A trace of anger welled up inside him, and he sped up.
<br><br>
Elvinia, who had been flying next to him, felt his change in behavior.
<br><br>
Obviously, Zen was worried about his sister most. Elvinia raised her eyebrow, deep in thought.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, the two of them finally landed in front of the giant lizard.
<br><br>
"Haha..."
<br><br>
The stage ruler's muffled laughter finally ceased once the two landed in front of him. Stretching out a long, scaly claw to point at Elvinia, he hissed, "Are you the purified being the monkeys mentioned?"
<br><br>
Elvinia looked at the stage ruler coldly but said nothing.
<br><br>
Although the stage ruler's appearance was different from hers, she could still feel a sense of familiarity from him. This familiar feeling indicated to her that the stage ruler was the same as her.
<br><br>
Elvinia frowned deeply. How could such an ugly thing be her own kind? "Answer me!"
<br><br>
The originally calm stage ruler suddenly became irritable.
<br><br>
He was the ruler of Stage Fourteen. The creatures from the Dark Region and the Light Region didn't dare to ignore him.
<br><br>
But Elvinia was completely indifferent to him.
<br><br>
Zen, who stood in front of Elvinia, pointed at the back of the stage ruler.
<br><br>
"The black monkeys are using my sister as bait. If you don't want to be mindlessly manipulated by the black monkeys, please just let them go."
<br><br>
The moment Zen spoke, Yan gasped softly. Natalie was also pleasantly surprised. It was really Zen! The stage ruler's eyes swept over Zen's figure. Elvinia was a purified being, but Zen was not. However, this was the man who had hurt his tongue, which puzzled him.
<br><br>
"The black monkeys want to use me to kill your sister..." the stage ruler echoed.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen nodded. "Please don't be fooled by those monkeys."
<br><br>
"Those ugly monkeys can't fool me!" Pointing his claw at Elvinia, the stage ruler smiled. "I will release the two Souls of Light if you give her to me.
<br><br>
What do you think?"
<br><br>
When Elvinia heard this, she sneered. Zen, on the other hand, remained calm. "What if I don't agree?"
<br><br>
"Then all of you will have to stay." The stage ruler opened his big mouth and made a muffled, guttural sound. Now, he was interested in not only Elvinia, but also Zen.
<br><br>
The scales on his huge body suddenly spread out, and thousands of colors blossomed from the edges of the scales.
<br><br>
The lights that the lizard released were not just in white, but in many other colors.
<br><br>
The originally dark and lifeless swamp suddenly came to life, illuminated in colors. It was like the first breeze in spring, gently nudging the sleeping nature to an awakened state.
<br><br>
The lights couldn't hurt Yan, Natalie, Zen, and Elvinia, but they were fatal to the other creatures in the swamp.
<br><br>
Everything that came into contact with the lights all turned into nothingness.
<br><br>
What was even more terrifying was that all the creatures in the marsh seemed to be drawn towards the colorful lights. Snakes that were more than ten thousand feet long, crocodiles lying in the depths of the marsh, bugs in the shadows... All the creatures rushed towards the lights for some reason, only to be gruesomely annihilated.
<br><br>
Then, it dawned on Zen. The creatures were actually sacrificing themselves! "The stage ruler is really powerful..."
<br><br>
Zen muttered, tightening his grip on the javelin he was holding.
<br><br>
Not long after Elvinia became a purified being, her strength far surpassed that of any ordinary creature on the Other Shore. Even the creatures in the Dark Region were no match for her.
<br><br>
The stage ruler in front of him was an ancient monster that had lived for countless years. His understanding of himself, the Other Shore, and the Great Sanskrit Light was not something that Elvinia could compare with.
<br><br>
The stage ruler threw his head back, unleashing a thunderous roar.
<br><br>
Then, his sharp claw swung out to try to reach for Zen's head.
<br><br>
Zen saw this coming. Reflexively, he flew to the side like a ghost.
<br><br>
Boom! After the claw smashed into the marsh, ripples quivered across its surface and spread out in all directions.
<br><br>
Zen leaped high into the air to dodge the stage ruler's blow. A sharp light flashed in his eyes, and he threw the javelin in his hand, aiming at the spot in between the stage ruler's eyes.
<br><br>
Chapter 3555 Cycle The javelin whistled through the air.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
The stage ruler was caught off guard, and the javelin sank into his forehead.
<br><br>
Zen had thrown the javelin with a lot of force. If it had managed to pierce the stage ruler's skull, it would've shattered his head.
<br><br>
However, this was not the case. Such a powerful strike even failed to pierce through his skin. Only the tip of the javelin had hit him.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
Even though his forehead had been struck, the stage ruler fiercely swiped at Zen who was still floating in the air with a claw. Zen didn't have the time to dodge.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Zen was smashed into the marsh, ripples waving from where he had landed.
<br><br>
Elvinia's face fell as she saw what happened. Before she could take a step towards Zen, the stage ruler's other claw was reaching for her. "I've stayed on Stage Fourteen for a long time," the stage ruler's voice boomed. "I've tasted almost all the creatures here, but the most delicious is still the Dark Nether Bugs. But, I think you will taste just as good..."
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The huge claw encircled Elvinia in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
However, she was quick on her feet. Immediately, she somersaulted backwards, narrowly avoiding his clutches.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
The stage ruler's sharp claw kept swiping towards Elvinia. She continued to move nimbly on the black marsh, dodging the claw like a dragonfly skimming on the surface of a pond.
<br><br>
Actually, it had been extremely dangerous while she was retreating to evade his attacks.
<br><br>
After she had become a purified being, she had made great progress relying on this physical body. Back when she was on Stage Thirteen, she could easily unleash a power of more than three thousand divine megatons, which surpassed even Zen's strength.
<br><br>
Now that she had entered Stage Fourteen, her physical body was definitely not considered weak, but her opponent was the ruler of Stage Fourteen who had numerous years of experience. The difference in strength was painfully obvious.
<br><br>
Swish! Whoosh! Phew! As she retreated, her body kept transforming into different shapes to evade the claw which was only inches away from her.
<br><br>
"Let me see how long you can keep this up!"
<br><br>
The eyes of the stage ruler revealed a trace of excitement.
<br><br>
As the ruler of Stage Fourteen, he had been standing at the top of this stage for too long.
<br><br>
In the entire Stage Fourteen. there seemed to be nothing worth his attention.
<br><br>
Now that he finally met someone powerful enough, naturally, he felt somewhat of a thrill.
<br><br>
As he rushed forward, he reached out his two claws. As the two claws intersected, colorful lights pierced through the darkness.
<br><br>
Elvinia clenched her teeth and continued to dart from left to right in the shadows.
<br><br>
"Puff..."
<br><br>
A sharp claw swiped at her chest, slicing through her flesh. A deep gash appeared under her clavicle, a wound so deep that one could see her bones.
<br><br>
Elvinia winced and was about to leap to the other side, but the stage ruler had already guessed her next move and yanked at her before she could even try.
<br><br>
"I'm done for..."
<br><br>
Her heart sank. She suddenly realized that her journey on the Other Shore would come to an end.
<br><br>
Yet somehow, even in the face of death, she felt no regret.
<br><br>
Ever since she entered Stage Thirteen, until now, she had gotten to know herself better.
<br><br>
But if she died, then, Zen...
<br><br>
Before she could even finish the thought, she realized the sharp claw that was reaching for her abruptly stopped a few inches from her face.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked confusedly, it was as though time had stopped.
<br><br>
Not only did the stage ruler's claw not move forward, it actually seemed to be slowly moving backward. Turning to look at the stage ruler's face, Elvinia was surprised to see an intensely angry expression.
<br><br>
As the massive claw retreated inch by inch, the stage ruler let out a deep roar.
<br><br>
Only then did Elvinia notice that Zen was holding the tail of the stage ruler tightly, dragging the huge lizard backwards! "Damn human!"
<br><br>
the stage ruler roared and gave up chasing Elvinia. Turning around furiously, he pounced on Zen.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
As the mud splashed, Zen was thrown under the stage ruler.
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
Yan screamed from the back of the big lizard, but she could do nothing as she was still trapped inside the array.
<br><br>
As Elvinia watched this scene, she gradually regained her senses. This whole time, she had been evading the stage ruler; however, upon seeing Zen in trouble, she was enraged. Planting her foot into the mud, she suddenly launched herself into the air, rushing towards the huge lizard.
<br><br>
But before she could even get close, the stage ruler's tail swept an arc in the air.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The stage ruler's tail alone was enough to land a blow with four thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Elvinia collided right into the tail, and was smashed into the ground. Letting out a muffled groan, she tasted a fishy, bittersweet taste well up from her throat. Dazed, she lay in the ground motionless for a moment.
<br><br>
Ignoring Elvinia, the stage ruler focused his attacks on Zen.
<br><br>
Under such a situation, Zen had almost no room to retreat. He could only lie on the ground and try to resist with his arms.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
After the stage ruler landed a blow, the light spots within Zen's body became extremely active, helping Zen absorb the power of the blow.
<br><br>
But the power of the stage ruler was too strong. While the Chaotic Source Spirits bore the power, they started showing faint signs of fatigue.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
At the same time, the golden light in Zen's body also glowed. It was the Truth of Godly Way washing over him, restoring the energy of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The stage ruler's huge eyes flashed with a strange light.
<br><br>
He had never left Stage Fourteen, so he naturally had never seen anything like the Chaotic Source Spirits. He had been under the impression that Zen's body was just extraordinarily tough.
<br><br>
But no matter how tough one thing was, there had to be a limit! Determined, the stage ruler launched another strike at Zen.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits, which had just been washed by the Truth of Godly Way, once again were on the verge of falling into the state of fatigue.
<br><br>
However, while Zen was momentarily suffering from the attack, the Truth of Godly Way quickly restored the Chaotic Source Spirits...
<br><br>
After being attacked by the stage ruler twice in a row, not only was Zen completely unharmed, the Chaotic Source Spirits were still full of vitality.
<br><br>
A sly smile crept on his face.
<br><br>
Recently, when Zen was testing the Chaotic Source Spirits within his body, he had come up with a theory.
<br><br>
When the Chaotic Source Spirits' power reached a certain level, the Truth of Godly Way of his body and the Chaotic Source Spirits could operate in a cycle, which could greatly slow down the speed of the Chaotic Source Spirits getting exhausted.
<br><br>
As a result, the attack that the Chaotic Source Spirits inside Zen's body could withstand was ten to twenty times more powerful than what others could bear...
<br><br>
What if the Chaotic Source Spirits continued to grow in power? The Truth of Godly Way used the attacks Zen suffered to fuel the Chaotic Source Spirits. As long as Zen wasn't killed in one blow, his physical body would be practically indestructible! What was happening right now was proving his theory correct.
<br><br>
The power of the stage ruler was indeed very strong, but he was unable to destroy the Chaotic Source Spirits all at once, which meant that the Chaotic Source Spirits would never fall into exhaustion thanks to his Truth of Godly Way! "Boom!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Every time the stage ruler landed another attack, the shock and disbelief in his eyes intensified.
<br><br>
In all his years, he had never encountered such a strange thing before. At one point, he even began to doubt himself. Was he too weak, or was this human too strong? Chapter 3556 The Son Of Light The three girls' hearts sank at the sight of what happened to Zen. However, the stage ruler had an unusual expression of shock on his face.
<br><br>
Yan gazed at the black mud, but she couldn't find any trace of Zen's body.
<br><br>
Under such devastating attacks, Zen might have been severely crushed into the mud.
<br><br>
Elvinia was still stuck in the swamp, her whole body covered in dirt. She struggled to get up from the swamp, but her body was seriously injured that she had difficulty moving.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Out of nowhere, the stage ruler struck out another ten powerful attacks to the area where Zen was previously standing.
<br><br>
As Elvinia witnessed it, confusion appeared on her anxious face.
<br><br>
She was wondering if it was even necessary to do that since Zen could not fight back anymore.
<br><br>
Furthermore, she noticed the restless expression on the stage ruler's face.
<br><br>
Immediately after, the stage ruler unleashed another barrage of attacks. This time, he had struck out at least twenty strong ones. With this, the three girls realized that there must be something wrong.
<br><br>
They didn't know what exactly was happening, but they were sure that the behavior of the huge lizard was definitely odd.
<br><br>
The stage ruler's strength was limited. After releasing more than thirty rounds of attack using his full strength, he finally got exhausted. He took a step back, and heavy breaths came out from his nostrils.
<br><br>
Elvinia, Yan, and Natalie all fixed their eyes on the location where Zen was previously standing. A huge pit was created in the area due to the relentless attacks of the stage ruler. The pit was then filled with black mud up to the surface.
<br><br>
Soon after, the mud on the pit parted as Zen's figure started to emerge out of the mud, completely unharmed.
<br><br>
"Z-Zen is fine!" Yan exclaimed with a trembling voice.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Natalie was rendered speechless as if she had seen a ghost. 'Is that even possible?!' In Natalie's mind, it was already an incredible miracle that Zen was able to enter the Other Shore with his corporeal body. This time, though she had doubts, she remembered that Yan had always described her brother as omnipotent. For this reason, she was starting to accept that Zen could really be more amazing than she thought he was.
<br><br>
Needless to say, Zen had proven himself for being unscathed after receiving about thirty unreserved attacks from the ruler of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Natalie thought that this kind of thing could only happen in dreams, but she completely knew that this was real since her Soul of Light had already entered the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the worry on Elvinia's face was thoroughly replaced by astonishment and relief.
<br><br>
"It seems like you're on your limit." Zen raised his head and gave a faint smile to the stage ruler.
<br><br>
"You, bastard… How did you do it?" The stage ruler stared at Zen as he couldn't fully comprehend how Zen could be completely unharmed with all the attacks that he had thrown at him.
<br><br>
He was so sure that the body of the young human shouldn't be this strong.
<br><br>
He thought that there seemed to be something incomprehensible happening to him.
<br><br>
However, no matter how smart the stage ruler was, he wouldn't be able to grasp something that was way beyond his knowledge. Furthermore, no one had ever been able to see through Zen's Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
"What makes you think that I'll tell you?" Zen answered. "Besides, if you don't know, then you have already lost."
<br><br>
As a purified being, Elvinia didn't possess any theurgy other than the free control of the Great Sanskrit Light, and a strong corporeal body.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen had speculated that this huge lizard might have had the same situation.
<br><br>
Since the giant lizard became the stage ruler, no one ever dared to treat him this way.
<br><br>
Previously, all corporeal bodies and Souls of Light that passed through Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, as well as the creatures rooted in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, respected and feared him. Since then, all he received were reverent gazes.
<br><br>
This was for the first time that he had heard some ruthless mockery since he became the stage ruler. Upon hearing all this, he raised his head and roared viciously.
<br><br>
White light burst out from under his scales. With the refraction of the scales, the light scattered into seven colors.
<br><br>
The light traveled a very far distance.
<br><br>
After handing Yan and Natalie to the stage ruler, the Chief Flag Monkey tried to leave the black swamp and dashed away without stopping.
<br><br>
As the stage ruler began to roar, the Royal Monkeys had just left the edge of the black swamp.
<br><br>
At the same moment, they suddenly saw a flash of blinding light.
<br><br>
"Hey! That's the light of a purified being!" one of the Royal Monkeys yelled.
<br><br>
"Run! Hurry up! We're going to be vaporized by that thing!" Another Royal Monkey covered his face and ran away without turning back.
<br><br>
When the Royal Monkeys saw the light, it meant that the light was already being transmitted to where they were.
<br><br>
Although their location was quite far away from the stage ruler, the Great Sanskrit Light was invincible. It could devour everything in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Realizing that the situation was getting worse, the Chief Flag Monkey rode on a horse and also ran away at full speed. However, it was kind of too late as the light was quickly devouring the demonic plants and grasses along the way. Eventually, the spreading light caught up to the Royal Monkeys, including the Chief Flag Monkey.
<br><br>
After the Chief Flag Monkey got promoted as the commander of the Royal Monkey race, he had successfully led the race and made great development.
<br><br>
Under his command, their race was even ranked first in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. They were able to trample their old nemesis, the one-eyed creatures.
<br><br>
In the end, no one thought that the commander of the Royal Monkey race as well as his Coldness Monkey Guards would die in such an unexpected way.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Mercer and Miller of the Insect Master race were staying farther from the black swamp.
<br><br>
The brothers originally planned to follow Zen, putting their lives at stake.
<br><br>
However, as Zen and Elvinia were about to enter the black swamp, Zen stopped them and told them to simply wait outside.
<br><br>
"It's that light!"
<br><br>
"It's coming closer!"
<br><br>
Fear was written all over their faces. Even the Holy Beetles, who had been completely tamed, were trembling in fear. The creatures in the Dark Region had an instinctive fear towards the Great Sanskrit Light.
<br><br>
However, the two brothers didn't run away. As they looked around, they saw a large pit nearby. The two of them jumped into the pit without hesitation.
<br><br>
The Great Sanskrit Light was indeed powerful, but it still had to erode everything on the surface before it could touch the two, who were hiding inside the deep pit. Eventually, they successfully evaded the looming disaster.
<br><br>
When the light gradually disappeared, the entire black swamp disappeared as well.
<br><br>
Along with the swamp, tens of thousands of snakes, insects, and some Other Shore races also vanished.
<br><br>
As creatures of the Light Region, Zen and the three girls weren't affected by the Great Sanskrit Light.
<br><br>
Since the whole swamp was eroded, the solid rocks beneath it all showed up.
<br><br>
Standing on the two huge rocks, Zen and Elvinia stared at the stage ruler.
<br><br>
A pair of light wings grew on the back of the stage ruler. White light twisted into lines that covered his entire body, illuminating the surrounding sky.
<br><br>
"You don't know much about the purified beings, do you? I will show you what power the son of light could possess!" the stage ruler uttered with a dull smile.
<br><br>
As he finished speaking, the twisted lines gathered around his body to his chest, forming a spiral pattern.
<br><br>
Boom! A white wave of light shot out from his chest, dashing directly towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack.
<br><br>
Just as the wave of light was about to hit Zen, the rocks around his feet already cracked due to the pressure being imposed by it.
<br><br>
"I see. Your power became much stronger, huh!"
<br><br>
Zen's pupils slightly contracted as the thunder wings on his back surfaced.
<br><br>
If Zen used the thunder wings in the Dark Region beforehand, the internal momentum of the Thunderstorm Godly Way would instantly be devoured by the darkness. However, now that the darkness had been completely expelled by the stage ruler, there was nothing to hinder Zen from using the thunder wings.
<br><br>
Bang! As the thunder wings created a loud sound on Zen's back, he turned into a flash of lightning and flew sideward. At the same time, he grabbed Elvinia, who was severely injured, in his arms.
<br><br>
Chapter 3557 Scorpion Poison As the light fell from the air, a visible shock wave surged in all directions.
<br><br>
The light penetrated everything that dared cross its path, forming a mighty column that pierced through the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Just as the circle of shock wave spread out, Zen grabbed hold of Elvinia and quickly flew away from the site of destruction.
<br><br>
Elvinia held on tight to Zen. "What kind of method is that? How can it be so powerful?" she exclaimed, eyes wide with shock.
<br><br>
Both she and the stage ruler were purified beings but this method was completely unknown to her. True, she could control the Great Sanskrit Light at will but never to this extent.
<br><br>
"How do you expect me to know if even you don't know?" Zen laughed bitterly, making sure that his grip on her was tight so that she wouldn't fall.
<br><br>
The stage ruler snorted coldly when he failed to hit Zen. His light wings flashed behind him and he immediately flew towards Zen at top speed. As he flew, rays of light gathered and spread from his chest in a spiral pattern.
<br><br>
Elvinia pointed to the sky in panic.
<br><br>
"It's coming!"
<br><br>
As soon as she shouted her warning, the light wave from the stage ruler's chest shot straight towards them! "Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The earth trembled as the light wave descended.
<br><br>
Zen felt the terrifying pressure without even turning his head. With gritted teeth, he willed himself to go even faster, the thunder wings on his back cracking as he accelerated.
<br><br>
"Pop!"
<br><br>
As the light wave descended, the shock wave spread along the Dark Region, completely annihilating everything in its path.
<br><br>
Zen moved Elvinia in front of him and used his back to block the shock wave force while using it as a boost to go even faster.
<br><br>
It was a high-speed chase between Zen's thunder wings and the stage ruler's imposing light wings.
<br><br>
While this chase went on, the creatures of the Dark Region worried greatly for their lives.
<br><br>
The shock wave from the light column would destroy everything in its path within a ten-mile radius. What made them even more terrified was the stage ruler's wings that constantly released Great Sanskrit Light.
<br><br>
Wherever Zen and the stage ruler went, destruction surely followed as sections of the Dark Region eroded in the presence of such imposing light.
<br><br>
The stage ruler's wings plowed out an ever growing ditch more than two hundred feet wide and thirty miles long.
<br><br>
Zen also felt the great pressure from the light wave.
<br><br>
He had no doubt that the power of this light wave was beyond the limit of his physical body. If the Chaotic Source Spirits were to be exhausted, then Zen could face the possibility of being seriously injured or even dying.
<br><br>
"Be careful on the left!"
<br><br>
Elvinia reminded him.
<br><br>
"It's at the right rear!"
<br><br>
He immediately flew towards the left to dodge the light waves but the stage ruler suddenly flipped and overtook Zen. It was with great shock that Zen suddenly found the stage ruler in front of him, especially when he suddenly opened his mouth.
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
A long, thin tongue came out of his mouth and headed towards Zen at high speed.
<br><br>
Zen never thought in a million years that the stage ruler would attack him with his tongue. He immediately threw Elvinia away, not wanting to involve her in whatever their opponent had in store for them.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but wonder if the stage ruler wanted to use his tongue to grab him and pull him towards his mouth. He shivered at the thought of being eaten. However, once the tongue reached him, it didn't wrap around his body like he expected, but instead, it drew back and hit him ruthlessly.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The force was enough to send Zen flying right into the light wave.
<br><br>
"Pop!"
<br><br>
As Zen's body was enveloped by the light, it popped and shone brightly.
<br><br>
The light had formed into a ball that slowly descended from the sky. A trace of cold satisfaction appeared on the stage ruler's face. It took a lot out of him to deal with this human.
<br><br>
Natalie could only look at this scene with distress. "Zen," she muttered. "He might be truly defeated this time."
<br><br>
Yan couldn't say anything, also overwhelmed by what had just happened.
<br><br>
When Zen threw Elvinia away, the young woman landed hard onto the ground. However, the pain was completely overwhelmed with a strong feeling of sadness and worry when she saw what happened to Zen.
<br><br>
It took twelve whole seconds for the light ball to descend and gradually fade away.
<br><br>
In its spot was a large crater where a creature lay.
<br><br>
It was the same size as a human being, but its appearance was utterly horrendous with spikes extending from its back and a tail that sprouted from its bottom.
<br><br>
"What is this? Where's Zen?" Natalie asked, her eyes filled with panic at what she saw.
<br><br>
Yan could only stare at the monster in confusion. "Where's my brother?"
<br><br>
she also wailed.
<br><br>
Elvinia was rendered speechless from the shock of seeing Zen in such a form. She had to blink a few times to make sure she wasn't seeing things.
<br><br>
It wasn't just them. Even the stage ruler was shocked at the result of his own attack.
<br><br>
He descended into the crater and landed just a couple of steps away from the monster. "Whoosh..."
<br><br>
Just as they were ruminating on their confusion, the monster's limbs suddenly sprang up.
<br><br>
It took the opportunity of its opponent's vulnerability and launched an attack. Before the stage ruler had a chance to spread his wings and fly away, the monster had already stuck itself to his body.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
The stage ruler's skin was rough and thick. When Zen threw a javelin at him before, the javelin failed to even break through the outer layer. However, this monster managed to pierce through him by just using the spikes on its tail.
<br><br>
Panic danced behind the stage ruler's eyes. He waved a sharp claw at his opponent but the monster was surprisingly agile and avoided his attack. The stage ruler didn't even get the chance to move away as the monster's tail stiffened and stabbed his neck.
<br><br>
Not satisfied, the monster drew its tail back and once again let the black spikes pierce through the stage ruler's abdomen.
<br><br>
It took three consecutive stabs before the monster left his body alone and let him plop down onto the ground.
<br><br>
Soon after, a strange thing happened to the stage ruler's body.
<br><br>
Three rays of green light began to spread from his chest, his neck, and his abdomen.
<br><br>
As the light spread, his black thick skin softened and disintegrated into green mud.
<br><br>
"What is this? What kind of poison is this?" the stage ruler screamed.
<br><br>
He knew his body was strong, so there was no way any ordinary poison would have this type of effect.
<br><br>
In his desperation, the stage ruler activated the Great Sanskrit Light and set it to the maximum in order to try and refill his body with energy.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, no matter how powerful his technique was, it proved ineffective in curing his poisoning.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The stage ruler panicked and flew into the air, roaring in the sky.
<br><br>
However, his struggle was futile. It only took about thirty seconds for him to exhaust himself and fall onto the cold, hard ground. The light wings on his back dimmed and his aura completely disappeared in a flash.
<br><br>
When he fell, the darkness that had once been dispersed began to close in.
<br><br>
Before the place was completely shrouded, Elvinia waved her hand and a ray of white light fell from the sky to illuminate the vicinity.
<br><br>
She made her way towards the monster that now crawled on the ground.
<br><br>
She stopped just a couple of paces away, careful not to startle it. "Zen?" she called out.
<br><br>
This monster's outline was blurry, so it might have entered the Other Shore with its physical body like Zen did. However, it was simply too different from Zen's appearance.
<br><br>
Chapter 3558 The Land Of Inheritance The monster that lay prostrate on the ground suddenly jumped up and stood upright. The hideous thing looked a bit like the Ghost Scorpion.
<br><br>
Yet, its appearance was more ferocious and aggressive--especially its thick scorpion tail, which glowed with a dark green light. It looked like it was ready to kill anyone who approached it at any time.
<br><br>
When Elvinia saw the monster get up, she instinctively took a few steps back.
<br><br>
The monster's figure looked a little blurry and it was hard to see it clearly, just like when Zen had entered the Other Shore with his physical body.
<br><br>
Elvinia knew that this creature was most likely Zen, but she was still a little afraid and remained vigilant. "Is my appearance too horrible?" Zen suddenly piped in.
<br><br>
Elvinia sighed in relief when she heard the familiar voice. "You should have spoken earlier. Why did you frighten me?" she complained.
<br><br>
"This is the first time I have seen such an expression from you," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
A red flush crept up Elvinia's cheeks in embarrassment. "It's also the first time I've seen you look like this!" she snorted.
<br><br>
"Fortunately, we are on the Other Shore. If we were in the Oneness Sky Palace, I'm afraid I would've really scared you."
<br><br>
Zen retracted the protruding bones as he spoke. The bone pieces folded into his body, then the tail, the spikes on his back, and the wide arms all disappeared and he returned to normal. Afterwards, he went straight to the stage ruler.
<br><br>
The stage ruler's life energy had been cut off and his entire body was covered in green mud.
<br><br>
"Zen! Are you okay?" Yan shouted from her position in the array that trapped her. The array beneath her feet separated her from the outside world.
<br><br>
Thus, both she and Natalie were not affected by the destruction.
<br><br>
Zen nodded at his sister in response. The thunder wings on his back flashed and he swiftly flew towards the back of the stage ruler's corpse. Then, he held the entire array in his arms and moved it down.
<br><br>
"Step back," he said.
<br><br>
In turn, Yan and Natalie went back to the other side of the array. Zen raised his hand and gently chopped the array, which caused it to explode and then collapse.
<br><br>
Next, he stepped forward and took his sister in his arms. "I'm sorry. I got you involved for no reason..." he apologized.
<br><br>
His sister did not deserve to suffer from such a catastrophe. Indeed, it was unfortunate that she was kidnapped and trapped in the Dark Region when she did not offend anyone.
<br><br>
Yan pursed her lips and consoled Zen softly, "It's not for no reason. Your enemy is also my enemy."
<br><br>
Although the two siblings had chosen different super forces to join, they had the same stand in the end.
<br><br>
The accident was completely because of the fact that the Other Shore was too complicated and they had gotten set up.
<br><br>
"Speaking of this, I am the one who was involved for no reason. Zen, shouldn't you apologize to me?" Natalie, who was behind them, chided with a grin.
<br><br>
Just before they were kidnapped, the Star Falcon race couldn't tell which one of them was Yan. Thus, they abducted both of them together. Truly, Natalie had been quite unlucky as well.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to speak, Elvinia interjected and said, "You should feel lucky to be saved. You are dreaming to get an apology."
<br><br>
Since Yan was Zen's sister, Elvinia usually ignored whatever words or emotions she conveyed. As for Natalie, Elvinia ruthlessly dissed her.
<br><br>
Then again, Natalie was also known for her arrogance in Pear Hill. Her face froze when she heard Elvinia's words.
<br><br>
"Why are you talking like that?" she hissed. "So what?" Elvinia shot back.
<br><br>
"Elvinia!" Zen quickly interrupted them and frowned.
<br><br>
Despite that, Elvinia wasn't angry and she did not argue with Zen.
<br><br>
Instead, she retreated to the side with a smile, which made Natalie extremely mad.
<br><br>
When Zen was about to console Natalie, his eyes suddenly lit up. He looked over and saw that a circle of light floated above the stage ruler's corpse.
<br><br>
The circle of light revolved around the air once, then it floated straight towards him. "What is that?" Natalie asked.
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, the circle of light came and enveloped Zen at lightning speed.
<br><br>
Once the circle of light had fully covered him, he disappeared in front of Elvinia and the others like magic. The three women were left standing there in a daze, and did not know what just happened.
<br><br>
Even Zen did not expect such a thing to happen, either. The circle of light swooped down on him too fast and he didn't have the time to dodge. While he was in the light, he only felt the sky and earth spin continuously around him. When he opened his eyes again, everything he saw was filled with light, as if he had fallen into a world full of blazing brightness. There was nothing but a vast expanse of white in all directions.
<br><br>
"Where am I? Elvinia? Yan?" he called out, but there was no response.
<br><br>
It looked like that the circle of light had teleported him into another place.
<br><br>
He squatted down and touched the ground for a while, and he felt a cold and smooth floor.
<br><br>
"This is not an illusion, but a real world..."
<br><br>
When he came to this conclusion, he began to walk forward as his footsteps echoed loudly in the empty space.
<br><br>
After he had wandered aimlessly for a distance in the snow-white world, he felt that his eyes had adapted to the environment. Eventually, he was slowly able to distinguish some white outlines.
<br><br>
The white pillars in the distance gradually revealed themselves. There seemed to be something among the pillars, but it was still very difficult for him to see what it was. Even if he was very close to these pillars, he still couldn't see anything but white.
<br><br>
"No. 9527, Master Regal Jade, what's this place?" At that moment, he could only turn to the two of them for help.
<br><br>
"I don't know." No. 9527's voice came through.
<br><br>
When Zen had used the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God just now, No.
<br><br>
9527 felt extremely alarmed. As for the snow-white world, No. 9527 had never seen it before.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Regal Jade Spirit first observed the surroundings for a while after Zen had summoned him, then asked, "Did you kill a purified being?"
<br><br>
"Yes," confirmed Zen.
<br><br>
"I see.
<br><br>
This is the Land of Inheritance, the Land of Inheritance of the purified beings," the Regal Jade Spirit said. "The Land of Inheritance?" Zen asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"Well, after a purified being dies, their killer will replace them and become the new stage ruler, which I'm certain of--but the Land of Inheritance is just what we, the Regal Jade Civilization call it. I haven't been to this place before. As for how to inherit the title of stage ruler and what this white world is really called, I have no idea." the Regal Jade Spirit explained.
<br><br>
"The new stage ruler?" asked Zen. Needless to say, he was shocked. "If I become a stage ruler, will I be bound to Stage Fourteen?" he asked again.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the stage rulers on the Other Shore were limited to the stages they had dominated.
<br><br>
Among the numerous stage rulers, Elvinia was the only exception. She had only encountered problems when she crossed the energy vortex.
<br><br>
The situation in the Lust World, however, was probably different from that in the Desire World. There was a reason Zen was worried.
<br><br>
"It might be possible. At least, I've never seen a stage ruler like Elvinia, who could leave the stage she dominated," the Regal Jade Spirit answered honestly.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Zen immediately became wary.
<br><br>
Becoming a purified being would enable him to travel freely in the Dark Region, but the price would be to stay on Stage Fourteen forever. For him, the loss simply wasn't worth the gain.
<br><br>
Chapter 3559 The Images On The Slates Since Zen didn't know what to do yet, he wandered in the white world for a while. Apart from the pillars, he was still unable to distinguish anything else.
<br><br>
He felt helpless and eventually, he just sat on the smooth floor. "I don't think I need to worry about whether or not I would be bound to Stage Fourteen now. It's a problem for me to even leave here," he said with a bitter smile.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 both remained silent. They observed the place really carefully, but they couldn't even see the vague pillars. Thus, they couldn't offer any help to Zen.
<br><br>
There were a total of nineteen purified beings on the nineteen stages of the entire Desire World. Those purified beings rarely participated in the feuds among many great races, as they were either independent individuals or chose to live in a remote place and protect their own races, not paying any attention to the affairs that happened in the world. Now, even though the Regal Jade Civilization had once been one of the ten great civilizations, they still didn't know much about the purified beings.
<br><br>
Meanwhile in the Dark Region, Elvinia took care of Yan and Natalie so none of the creatures in the area would dare provoke or attack them.
<br><br>
Truth be told, the stage ruler's abnormal behavior had already caused a great uproar in the Dark Region. As a result, those creatures that hid in the Dark Region risked their lives and sent their forces to investigate the stage ruler's whereabouts.
<br><br>
However, they were extremely shocked to find out that the stage ruler was dead when they saw his corpse lying prostrate from afar.
<br><br>
The creatures of the Dark Region naturally wanted to attack Elvinia, but when they saw her activate the Great Sanskrit Light, they didn't even dare approach her anymore.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he simply sat quietly in the vast, white world.
<br><br>
Since the Regal Jade Spirit said that this was the Land of Inheritance, there must be a method to inherit the title of the stage ruler.
<br><br>
He gently waved his hand in the air, but didn't feel anything unusual. The Great Sanskrit Light should also be a kind of energy, and based on the light the giant lizard had unleashed before, the method of using such energy should also have different levels. Elvinia, however, couldn't release that level of light wave like the lizard did.
<br><br>
Moreover, the process of Elvinia becoming a purified being was also quite strange. She did not enter this Land of Inheritance, and the one who had gone in instead was that pig-faced monster called "Teague". But just as Teague had become a purified being and was about to come out, he merged with Elvinia.
<br><br>
"If that pig-faced monster can make it, then I can make it too. Since the Great Sanskrit Light is a kind of energy, there must be a way to control it..."
<br><br>
A few moments later, Zen sat cross legged and meditated.
<br><br>
Five minutes had passed...
<br><br>
An hour had passed...
<br><br>
Two hours had passed...
<br><br>
The white colored world was still as snow-white as ever, and it couldn't be touched, nor anything could be seen through within it.
<br><br>
Despite that, Zen didn't feel anxious in the slightest as he calmly stared at the white scenery in front of him.
<br><br>
After he had stared quietly in the same position for six hours, he finally found something different. The white seemed to have moved, like the way the clouds in the sky rolled subtly.
<br><br>
"Eh? What happened? The white moved?" he muttered, his brows arched up.
<br><br>
A smile tugged at the corner of his lips. He turned to look at the pillars again, and the outline of the pillars became more distinct! "I'll continue to observe!"
<br><br>
Another four hours had passed, and the number of times the white changed had increased.
<br><br>
The white light was no longer a motionless scene, and instead it continued to roll. As it did so, Zen also noticed that there were some shiny dots within the white light, which he didn't see before.
<br><br>
Those light dots slowly floated around like aimless insects.
<br><br>
"Does the key point lie in these light dots?" he mumbled.
<br><br>
As soon as the thought came to his mind, he stood up and walked towards them. The second he stepped forward, however, the aura in the entire space became chaotic. All the light dots fluctuated with the change of the aura and quickly escaped from his side.
<br><br>
"These light dots are almost weightless. A slight fluctuation of energy will make them float..." He thought for a bit again, then summoned the Wing King's feather.
<br><br>
When he moved once more, the feather reduced the impact on the surrounding space by a huge amount. Just to be on the safe side, he even used the Truth of Cultivation Nature.
<br><br>
"Swoosh…"
<br><br>
The light dots still slightly fluctuated when he approached them again, but the fluctuation was minor. At the very least, it was manageable.
<br><br>
He walked straight towards the light dots and tried to make them meet his eyes.
<br><br>
When the light spots merged with his pupils, he suddenly felt that everything around him had become clearer.
<br><br>
"Indeed, I was right..."
<br><br>
It turned out that if one wanted to see the world clearly, they had to integrate those light dots into their eyes.
<br><br>
Zen had remained motionless since he entered this world. A lot of light spots accidentally entered into his eyes, which naturally made him see more and more clearly.
<br><br>
However, the process was too slow. After all, the absorption of the light dots was purely based on luck.
<br><br>
Now that he had found how everything worked, how could he still hold back? In the next second, he briskly walked forward and continued to absorb the light dots.
<br><br>
After about five minutes, he had already absorbed a hundred light spots into his eyes. The rolling white clouds and fog from before slowly dimmed, and the outline of the surroundings became clearer and clearer. Only then did he realize that he was standing in a white palace.
<br><br>
On the left side of the palace stood many huge pillars, and in the center of the pillars were white slates. There were abstract images drawn on the slates. Although the images were abstract, he still could distinguish them.
<br><br>
"This is a jellyfish?"
<br><br>
"This is a wolf..."
<br><br>
"This is a giant lizard. Is it that stage ruler?"
<br><br>
His eyes flashed as soon as he saw the image of the giant lizard, as if he had understood something.
<br><br>
He swept past the images on the slates while he counted them. "There are a total of twenty slates here. Are there twenty purified beings in the entire Desire World?" he said.
<br><br>
"No, there are only nineteen stages in the Desire World. Theoretically, there are nineteen purified beings," the Regal Jade Spirit told him.
<br><br>
Although the Regal Jade Spirit couldn't see those images, he could understand something from Zen's mumblings. "But don't forget that there appeared a purified being in the Lust World all of a sudden," he added.
<br><br>
There was originally no purified being in the first thirteen stages, and Elvinia was the first one.
<br><br>
Upon hearing the Regal Jade Spirit's reminder, Zen looked up and saw a strange pig-faced monster drawn on the slate on the top. However, that image of the strange pig-faced monster was a little special. There was a woman's head on his fat pig body.
<br><br>
Of course, he couldn't help but laugh when he saw it.
<br><br>
Something wrong had happened when the pig-faced monster occupied Elvinia's soul, so it affected the Land of Inheritance. That was why it had shown such a mixed image.
<br><br>
After all, the purified being was originally a pig-faced monster, while Elvinia was just an occupant. He wondered what Elvinia would think if she saw this image.
<br><br>
Once he had scanned all the "portraits" of the purified beings, he looked at the other side of the palace. His usual expression suddenly turned into surprise.
<br><br>
On the other side was a huge slate with densely packed Sanskrit words drawn on it.
<br><br>
There were so many Sanskrit words, to the point that the number had far exceeded anything that Zen had seen before! Chapter 3560 A Special Cultivation A single Sanskrit word normally recorded a great amount of information.
<br><br>
Zen was quite taken aback when he found an abundance of Sanskrit words — what sort of things needed to be recorded with so many of them? Sensing Zen's emotional fluctuation, the Regal Jade Spirit asked, "Zen, what do you see?"
<br><br>
"So many Sanskrit words!" Zen exclaimed in excitement.
<br><br>
"A great number?" Even the spirit was rather surprised.
<br><br>
He was quite interested in the Land of Inheritance for the purified beings. It could involve higher-level secrets of the Instant Civilization, after all.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen's gaze swept across the slate, giving him a rough estimate.
<br><br>
"There are about three hundred to four hundred Sanskrit words in total — they all look strange to me. I should ask Geoffrey…"
<br><br>
These days, Geoffrey was growing more and more proficient in deciphering Sanskrit words. Every time Zen spotted a new one, he'd think of him.
<br><br>
But before Zen could finish his words, the fact that he was now on the Other Shore suddenly came to mind. It was impossible for him to bring Geoffrey there to decipher Sanskrit words. Even if he could, Geoffrey probably wouldn't be able to see the words with his naked eyes because of the white light. Neither No. 9527 nor the Regal Jade Spirit could see them, after all.
<br><br>
It was even more unrealistic to copy them with duplicating stone tablets as it was impossible for Zen to bring those to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
While the Regal Jade Spirit tried figuring out what to do, Zen's eyes were suddenly fixated on the slate. The first Sanskrit word seemed to have moved.
<br><br>
The second one followed, and then the third, and the fourth, and so on.
<br><br>
Rows of Sanskrit words began rolling like waves as they began flipping one after another. Zen's gaze was completely pulled in by the movement.
<br><br>
"I think you can try lending Geoffrey your eyesight in the place of his," said the Regal Jade Spirit. "Perhaps that will work." But Zen paid no mind to his words, let alone responded.
<br><br>
"Zen? Zen, what do you think?"
<br><br>
After calling his name a few times, the spirit finally realized Zen's unusual state.
<br><br>
He was standing as still as a statue, staring blankly ahead.
<br><br>
In Zen's vision, the Sanskrit words on the slate had completely come to life.
<br><br>
They were like several little rats tumbling about. As they did, their movements conveyed specific information.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't absorbing the information by 'reading, ' instead, he was gaining understanding rather automatically when he went through the words.
<br><br>
In the past, Zen needed Geoffrey to decipher each Sanskrit word he had come across. But these words on the slate before him were somehow different — they instantly conveyed their meaning.
<br><br>
When Zen's gaze reached the final word, they all began flipping in reverse.
<br><br>
Each word flipped at a different angle, conveying new information.
<br><br>
For a long while, Zen stood still, watching the words move around.
<br><br>
A couple of hours later, the words finally stopped rolling.
<br><br>
"Zen! Zen! Can you hear me?"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit's voice seemed to be coming from afar, but Zen gradually regained his consciousness until he seemed responsive.
<br><br>
"What happened to you just now?" asked the spirit.
<br><br>
There was excitement on Zen's face as he pointed at the slate. "I've comprehended the words on that slate."
<br><br>
"Really? Can you decipher Sanskrit words now?" the other asked in surprise.
<br><br>
But Zen shook his head before giving the Regal Jade Spirit a rundown of what had happened on the slate. "The information within these Sanskrit words must be a unique theurgy. When these contents entered my head, it was like I fell into a strange state," he added.
<br><br>
It was the first time he had ever experienced such a special cultivation.
<br><br>
As he spoke, he reached out and flicked his fingers. With his eyes narrowing in concentration, a white light began gathering at his fingertips, forming a dense ball of light. Just as Elvinia could, Zen could now freely control the Great Sanskrit Light.
<br><br>
When Zen turned his hand over, his body absorbed the light, forming winding lines and spiraling patterns on his palm.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A small light wave emerged from the spiral. With a flick of Zen's finger, the light wave shot upwards.
<br><br>
While the light wave's power was far inferior to that of the giant lizard, it held the same form and effect.
<br><br>
"It turns out that the giant lizard's powerful light wave was something learned from the slate — the Illuminating Wave, it's called. Elvinia hasn't been to this world, so she hasn't learned it, nor does she know how to employ it."
<br><br>
Most interesting was the fact that this method of using the Great Sanskrit Light was beyond description.
<br><br>
Once he observed the Sanskrit words' movement, Zen grasped the method rather naturally. But he later realized that he couldn't explain how the theurgy worked with mere words — the knowledge had become a kind of instinct.
<br><br>
"So do you know the way out of here?" The Regal Jade Spirit asked in return.
<br><br>
"The way out…"
<br><br>
Zen's gaze swept across the area, finding nothing but pillars. No door or anything of the sort could be found on the walls — there was no exit whatsoever. It seemed to be an entirely isolated space.
<br><br>
But as he wondered about leaving, the theurgy within his mind began working on its own.
<br><br>
Buzz! A circle of light enveloped Zen's body before he instantly disappeared within it.
<br><br>
In the next moment, he had returned to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
For several hours, Elvinia, Yan, and Natalie had been waiting there. After a while of boredom, they soon began chatting away about Zen. Distracted by all the chatter, they had eventually forgotten the little conflict between Natalie and Elvinia.
<br><br>
At Elvinia and Natalie's pressing request, Yan told them about Zen's childhood, as well as his early adventure in the Eastern Region.
<br><br>
Zen's life stories sounded incredible to the two girls who had grown up in the Source World.
<br><br>
While Elvinia wasn't too astonished because she had already heard some stories from Lavender, Natalie's face was full of disbelief.
<br><br>
Everyone in the Source World was born with great power, after all. So long as they had adequate talent, becoming a True God wasn't all that difficult.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, was born among the lowest level of beings in his father's inner world. The fact that he had reached his present level coming from that situation was nothing short of miraculous, Natalie believed.
<br><br>
A circle of light suddenly appeared beside them, from where Zen emerged.
<br><br>
"He's back!" Yan's eyes lit up with absolute joy upon seeing her brother's safe return.
<br><br>
"What exactly is this circle of light? How did it take you away?" Elvinia asked curiously.
<br><br>
"You can check it out for yourself if you want to, you know," Zen threw an easy smile in Elvinia's direction. He wanted to send her into the palace of light. After she grasped the Sanskrit words on the slate, she would get the answer on her own.
<br><br>
But surprisingly, the circle of light didn't appear at his command. The three women stared at him curiously, wondering what he meant.
<br><br>
Zen smiled wryly in mild embarrassment.
<br><br>
"Well… it seems that I failed…"
<br><br>
Chapter 3561 A New Stage Ruler Purified beings couldn't enter the palace of light at will. Otherwise, the giant lizard would have already hidden within the palace, when he found he stood no chance to defeat Zen.
<br><br>
The latter had just mastered the Great Sanskrit Light, but he couldn't create the circle of light—now, all he could do was wait for the next best opportunity.
<br><br>
Now that Yan was safe, there was no need for him to stay in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
When the four of them were ready to leave, some of the creatures hiding in the shadows surrounded Zen and knelt before him, kowtowing devoutly.
<br><br>
Otherwise known as the stage rulers, the purified beings had absolute strength, recognized as a spiritual symbol by many creatures.
<br><br>
Once the great lizard passed away, it meant new authority appeared in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
For a moment, Zen and the others paused. If they continued moving forward, the white light would annihilate all these creatures from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Get up, everyone. You can leave now," Zen simply said.
<br><br>
His words had all the creatures standing up and bowing to him respectfully before retreating in all directions.
<br><br>
But something returned to Zen's mind—he pointed at a one-eyed monster that happened to be nearby.
<br><br>
He had seen the one-eyed monsters in Stage Thirteen—they had even tried to snatch away the Civilization Artifact. They seemed to be widely distributed on the Other Shore, much like the Royal Monkey race.
<br><br>
As it turned out, the one-eyed monster Zen pointed at was the leader of his race.
<br><br>
The appearance of a new stage ruler wasn't something that the races on the Other Shore would be pleased to hear about, but that wasn't something for them to decide. They had to spend some time understanding the temper and preferences of the new stage ruler.
<br><br>
But the last one was ruthless and tyrannical. Because the Royal Monkey race fawned over him for so long, the stage ruler tended to favor them.
<br><br>
For the one-eyed monsters, at least, the shift in power was a good thing.
<br><br>
The leader came forward and cupped his hands toward Zen. "What can I do for you?"
<br><br>
"I have some friends in the Dark Region. Help me take care of them," Zen said flatly.
<br><br>
"May I know who you are talking about?" The leader's eyes lit up at Zen's order—it was an excellent opportunity to please the new stage ruler. It would be highly beneficial to satisfy any of Zen's requests.
<br><br>
"The Insect Master race."
<br><br>
"The Insect Master race?"
<br><br>
The leader frowned in confusion before he realized that the Insect Master race was a small, unknown group under the Royal Monkeys' control.
<br><br>
If someone else had requested it, the leader would have probably considered the Royal Monkey race's attitude. But it was none other than Zen who had given the order.
<br><br>
"I will arrange everything well!"
<br><br>
The leader was overjoyed. This way, he wasn't only doing Zen a favor, but also taking the opportunity to suppress the Royal Monkey race. It was an excellent opportunity for the one-eyed monsters.
<br><br>
Taking the order, the leader retreated.
<br><br>
Then, Zen and his group headed west. Upon arriving at the edge of the Dark Region, Zen asked Elvinia to pull out the black box. He then released the monsters from it, including the Shape-shifting Spirit.
<br><br>
"We're already in the Dark Region, so I shall fulfill my promise and let you go," Zen said.
<br><br>
The monsters had been imprisoned in the iron house for countless years.
<br><br>
Finally, they could taste freedom. All of them were excited as they explored their new surroundings. Some of them had come from the upper stages of the Other Shore, but their strength was suppressed after entering this lower stage. Given more time, though, they'd make a great splash in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Soon, the monsters had scattered in all directions, save for the Shapeshifting Spirit.
<br><br>
"Why aren't you leaving?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
The spirit remained still with a complicated look in its eyes.
<br><br>
Although it used to be a pet, it could fend for itself in the outside world. But for some reason, it felt that it should follow Zen. The one who opened the iron house was by no means ordinary, after all.
<br><br>
"I… I want to follow you," it suddenly spoke up.
<br><br>
"Follow me?" For a moment, Zen was stunned, but he recovered quickly.
<br><br>
"You can follow me," he started with a smile. "But you know, I won't be staying in the Dark Region most of the time. I'm usually in the Light Region. You'll have to stay in this small space."
<br><br>
It was the box emitting black light that he was referring to.
<br><br>
"That's fine with me," said the Shape-shifting Spirit with a shrug.
<br><br>
For countless years, it had been imprisoned in the iron cage. The black box made no difference to it.
<br><br>
This spirit could turn into any creature—a useful skill for critical moments.
<br><br>
Once Zen let it enter the black box and put it away in Elvinia's space ring, they stepped out of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Mercer and Miller had to wait quite a while in the cave before they could climb out—they didn't want to get caught in the battle of the purified beings.
<br><br>
Without seeing Zen for some time, all they could do was ride the Holy Beetles and leave. Nothing happened on their way back.
<br><br>
After they reported what had happened in the black marsh, all the Insect Masters were filled with fear.
<br><br>
"Didn't the benefactor go to find the Royal Monkeys? Why did he defy the stage ruler?" an Insect Master eagerly asked.
<br><br>
On the surface, the Insect Master race had always fallen to tragedy at the hands of the Royal Monkey race. In truth, it was because the stage ruler needed to devour the Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
But most of the creatures of the Dark Region believed in the stage ruler, and the Insect Master race was no exception. While they carried some resentment in their hearts, it was more for the Royal Monkey race than the stage ruler.
<br><br>
"Challenging the stage ruler means courting death…" another respected Insect Master shook his head disapprovingly.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid that the Royal Monkeys will blame our race soon after. We will…"
<br><br>
Mercer and Miller's news put an extremely grim atmosphere over the Insect Masters. They were now all imagining soon being slaughtered by the Royal Monkey race.
<br><br>
Just as the Insect Masters seemed down, a set of noisy footsteps resounded from afar.
<br><br>
Afraid that the Royal Monkey race was approaching, they stared nervously into the distance.
<br><br>
From the darkness, over a dozen figures emerged in succession. They were the one-eyed monsters.
<br><br>
These creatures could fight against the Royal Monkeys head-on. Naturally, the Insect Masters felt far inferior to them. As the two races were far from each other, they never had much interaction.
<br><br>
"Are you Insect Masters?" a one-eyed monster suddenly asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
"Yes!"
<br><br>
several of them answered automatically.
<br><br>
"You don't have to be so courteous," said the monster in a friendly tone.
<br><br>
"The new stage ruler asked us to take good care of you. This place is too close to the Royal Monkeys' territory. Please follow us. We must lead you out."
<br><br>
"The new stage ruler?"
<br><br>
"We have a new stage ruler?"
<br><br>
"Who is it?"
<br><br>
All the Insect Masters were completely dumbfounded by the news.
<br><br>
Even Mercer and Miller were stunned. They both had a good guess about who it was.
<br><br>
Chapter 3562 Sky Water City It wasn't difficult to verify their conjecture from the one-eyed monster.
<br><br>
When the one-eyed monster told the Insect Master race that the new stage ruler was a human being, all the Insect Masters had become excited.
<br><br>
Only then did Mercer and Miller understand why the arrogant one-eyed monsters were treating them so politely.
<br><br>
That night, all of the Insect Masters packed up and drove all kinds of poisonous insects and ants to move with the one-eyed monsters.
<br><br>
A different fate awaited them. As the Insect Master race wasn't strong, they might not be able to achieve much in the Dark Region even if they were given more time. But under the protection of the one-eyed monsters, they wouldn't be as miserable as before. They could even dare to hope a little.
<br><br>
It was peaceful in the Light Region of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore these days.
<br><br>
The Sky Water City had previously been in chaos. It would collapse even without the attack of the Giants and the Guide Weasel race.
<br><br>
However, the originally aggressive Giant race and Guide Weasel race had suddenly retreated to the Myriad Spirits City under Zen's order. Many of the large races in the Sky Water City thought that the two races showed weakness and cowardice before the Star Falcon race.
<br><br>
This naturally deepened the prestige that the Star Falcon race felt and they in turn intimidated many large races in the Sky Water City, which helped the Star Falcon race stabilize the situation.
<br><br>
In the early hours of the morning, over one thousand White Apes had gathered outside the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
The White Ape race used to be part of the Sky Water City, but they were later expelled by the Star Falcon race.
<br><br>
This time, Whitehead, from the White Ape race, helped the Star Falcon race find Yan and lead Zen into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The Star Falcon race, pleased with their contribution, bestowed on the White Ape race the right to enter the Sky Water City again. They also gave them a large area within the city.
<br><br>
The leader of the White Ape race walked ahead, Whitehead closely following him.
<br><br>
Whitehead looked like a hero coming back with great honor as he walked with his head held high.
<br><br>
It was all thanks to him that the White Ape race had achieved what it had.
<br><br>
The leader had even chosen him as his successor. After they entered the Sky Water City, the leader would let him succeed him as the new leader of the race.
<br><br>
Two massive Star Falcons sat on the city wall, staring down from their perch. These were two elders of the Star Falcon race, Hanley and Tomas, who were guarding the city.
<br><br>
When the Star Falcon race had lost, these two elders had taken charge of the situation and sent the six Star Falcons to take Yan away.
<br><br>
"Hanley, why are you letting these losers enter the city?" Tomas said, staring at the White Apes disdainfully.
<br><br>
The White Ape race had once been expelled from the Sky Water City and was no longer qualified to enter it.
<br><br>
"The White Ape race helped us at a critical moment," Hanley answered in earnest.
<br><br>
"So what? We can reward them accordingly. But if we allow such good-fornothing creatures to enter the Sky Water City, other races will laugh at us,"
<br><br>
Tomas said heatedly.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter," Hanley said, his eyes shining shrewdly. "We have to let every race in the Sky Water City know that even now, there are forces that choose to follow us! We won't lose anything by giving the White Ape race a piece of land. What we are doing is killing two birds with one stone."
<br><br>
Tomas nodded. "Is there still no news from the Dark Region?" he asked.
<br><br>
Hanley shook his head. "All of these are trifles," he said, pointing at the White Apes below. "What I care most about is news of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The woman called Elvinia is a purified being. I'm afraid even the Royal Monkey race will find it difficult to deal with her."
<br><br>
The creatures in the Dark Region were generally stronger than those in the Light Region. But Elvinia was a purified being, the nemesis of the creatures in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"The two human beings haven't returned yet. They must have died in the Dark Region!" Tomas said, "Don't forget that there is a stage ruler in the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
At the mention of the stage ruler, Hanley's confidence increased.
<br><br>
The Star Falcon race didn't know much about the Dark Region, but they had a general idea of what was going on there. The Royal Monkey race would most likely take advantage of the stage ruler and kill the two human beings.
<br><br>
If the stage ruler were to really take action against them, they would have already died there.
<br><br>
"I'll send someone to the Dark Region to inquire about it," Hanley said, nodding.
<br><br>
Hanley felt a sudden tremor under his feet before the whole wall began to shake.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
"What happened?" Tomas's eyes were wide as saucers, surprised.
<br><br>
The members of the White Ape race that had entered the Sky Water City one by one, also looked up at the shaking city wall.
<br><br>
"What is going on?" the leader of the White Ape race said.
<br><br>
Not knowing what was going on, Whitehead turned around and shouted, "Members of the White Ape race! Hurry up! Enter the city as soon as possible!"
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
It was at this moment that the sound of something being ripped apart echoed through the air. A huge crack, extending from the top to the bottom of the wall, appeared just a few feet away from them.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
With a resounding boom, a part of the city wall collapsed, and four figures appeared beside it. Zen and his companions had arrived.
<br><br>
Whitehead paled at the sight of these people. He knew something bad was going to happen. The Star Falcons were also shocked at the sight of Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
"Yan, you all can leave the Other Shore first," said Zen.
<br><br>
Yan's and Natalie's Souls of Light were still too weak. They would be in danger if they were to remain in the midst of a chaotic battle.
<br><br>
"Okay," Yan acquiesced.
<br><br>
"Remember! It's that White Ape! It is that White Ape that killed Naomi!"
<br><br>
Natalie said, jabbing a finger towards Whitehead.
<br><br>
Before this, both Natalie and Yan hadn't understood why, when the Pear Hill and the White Ape race were on good terms, Whitehead had chosen to betray them. They had their answer now. He had betrayed them just to return to the Sky Water City! Natalie and Yan soon left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
A howling sounded through the skies.
<br><br>
More than ten Star Falcons had spread their wings and were headed straight for Zen.
<br><br>
These Star Falcons were the guards of the Sky Water City. They didn't know why Zen and the others had come here and were treating them merely as ordinary intruders.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed at these Star Falcons. He stomped his feet and turned into a lightning arc, shooting towards the guards.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
The lightning arc continually cut through the group of Star Falcons. Before anybody could react, charred bodies of the guards began to rain down into the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
With a crack, the lightning flashed in a huge arc in the air and struck the ground at Whitehead's feet, emitting a burst of thunder and causing the members of the White Ape race to clap their hands over their ears that had begun to ring.
<br><br>
Zen's figure appeared in the lightning, his eyes cold. "You cooperated with the Star Falcon race and kidnapped my sister just to get a foothold in the Sky Water City. How could you be so reckless?"
<br><br>
"I... I..." Whitehead was beginning to panic. He was beating a hasty retreat but looked up at the sky from time to time.
<br><br>
"Are you counting on the Star Falcon race to save you?" Zen sneered, "I defeated the entire Star Falcon race on my own. Don't you know? Hans and Garth didn't even stand a chance to defeat me. The Star Falcon race asked you to take my sister away because there was no way out for them."
<br><br>
Chapter 3563 Abandon The City Shocked at the words Zen just uttered, Whitehead kept his mouth wide open.
<br><br>
Even the leader and elders of the White Ape race were dumbfounded.
<br><br>
The White Ape race had left the Sky Water City too long ago, so naturally, they didn't know much about the current situation in the city. It never crossed their minds that such a thing had happened before.
<br><br>
"No, it's impossible..." Whitehead shook his head in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Why is it impossible? It's not just the Sky Water City. Now, even the entire Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore belongs to him. He is now the ruler of Stage Fourteen," said Elvinia, who had come down from the city wall as well.
<br><br>
However, as she was descending, she carried a small portion of the city wall on her shoulder. When she was finished speaking, she suddenly threw the piece of the city wall out.
<br><br>
The piece smashed into a huge statue of a Star Falcon in the square nearby.
<br><br>
This statue had stood there for countless years, yet now it was but a pile of rubble.
<br><br>
"The ruler of..."
<br><br>
"Is he the new stage ruler?"
<br><br>
"So the one in the Dark Region..."
<br><br>
The range of activities of purified beings was not limited to the Dark Region, so the creatures in the Light Region naturally knew about them.
<br><br>
After all, they were the strongest in a certain stage of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"That one has already been killed." Elvinia dusted off her hands nonchalantly.
<br><br>
Hanley and Tomas exchanged glances, each filled with disbelief.
<br><br>
Finding Zen and Elvinia in the Sky Water City was the worst news for the Star Falcon race right now.
<br><br>
This meant that the Royal Monkey race had failed.
<br><br>
However, deep in their hearts, both Hanley and Tomas deduced that the Royal Monkey race hadn't actually failed. Instead, the only logical explanation was the Royal Monkey race had been unable to ask the stage ruler to make a move. This was because if the stage ruler did make a move, there was no possible way these humans could have survived.
<br><br>
If this was the case, the Star Falcon race still had hope! But according to Elvinia, they had actually killed and even replaced the stage ruler.
<br><br>
"Is that human woman telling the truth?" Hanley asked, his voice trembling.
<br><br>
"It can't be true. She must be lying..." Tomas said, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Even if she's lying, we can't keep our place in the Sky Water City," Hanley murmured. "If it's all true, then the Star Falcon race will be annihilated. We need to inform the others to flee..." Hanley spread his wings wide, ready to fly off.
<br><br>
Whitehead, on the other hand, was still frozen in shock. Hanley and Tomas leapt into the sky, twittering loudly.
<br><br>
Immediately, the rest of the members of the Star Falcon race in the entire Sky Water City followed suit and launched into the sky to follow the two elders. In a matter of seconds, the Sky Water City was completely abandoned.
<br><br>
Their sudden departure left the remaining races, including the White Ape race, speechless.
<br><br>
Today was supposed to be a great day for the White Ape race. However, when they had just marched into the city, the Star Falcon race had even chosen to abandon the city! Oh, the irony...
<br><br>
"Your White Ape race was on good terms with the Pear Hill, so, supposedly, you could have returned to the Sky Water City without conflict." Zen paused, and then frowned. "Unfortunately, you made a grave mistake..." As Zen spoke, he reached out his hand and placed it gently on Whitehead's head.
<br><br>
At this point, Whitehead didn't dare resist; he didn't even have the courage to run away. Wordlessly, he stood there, trembling. A deep sense of regret filled his heart.
<br><br>
Because the Star Falcon race had fled so quickly, Whitehead figured that Zen was speaking the truth. 'I shouldn't have taken the trouble to try to please the Star Falcon race...' he thought with remorse.
<br><br>
However, no medicine in this world could have healed him from this regret.
<br><br>
Then a piercing sound came from above, and a lightning bolt arced through the air until it enveloped Whitehead in a sea of blinding light.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he had disintegrated into fine, white dust in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Seeing Whitehead's powdery remains, the rest of the White Ape race were filled with fear, as they anticipated Zen's punishment.
<br><br>
They had all gotten into this mess because of Whitehead, but they had still been eager for success.
<br><br>
From this point of view, every one of the White Ape race had offended Zen.
<br><br>
Turning to the White Ape race, Zen shouted coldly, "Leave Sky Water City!"
<br><br>
The leader of the White Ape race had been awaiting Zen's order. Upon hearing he was letting them go, he felt joy well up within him.
<br><br>
Given the situation, it was already incredibly lucky for them to come out of the city alive.
<br><br>
After the White Ape race had retreated from the Sky Water City, Yan and Natalie returned to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Eyeing Whitehead's remains, Natalie shook her head coldly. "This guy is lucky to have died this way. He killed Naomi, after all. If it were up to me, I'd have hacked him into pieces..."
<br><br>
Yan also sighed. "May Naomi rest in peace."
<br><br>
Since the Star Falcon race had left, there was no need for Zen to stay here.
<br><br>
The Sky Water City was now a city with no leader. Even so, Zen couldn't possibly occupy the city by himself.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to return to the Myriad Spirits City, another three creatures of the Other Shore walked up to him. These three creatures represented the three large races only second to the Star Falcon race in the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
The purpose of these three races was very clear. Since Zen had driven away the Star Falcon race, he was now viewed as the owner of the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen couldn't manage such a large city alone, so it was best if he left it up to the three races to manage it for him.
<br><br>
The actions of the three large races mirrored that of the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race back in the Myriad Spirits City, but the difference was that the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race were more sincere. Before Zen even needed to give the order, the two races destroyed the Dark Bear race.
<br><br>
Obviously, the three large races didn't dare take action while the Star Falcon race was still a threat. But now, the Star Falcon race had already fled.
<br><br>
"You are too late." Zen cast an indifferent glance at them, and then proceeded to walk out of the city with Elvinia and the others.
<br><br>
The leaders of the three large races looked at each other. They were all quite perceptive, and instantly understood what Zen meant: he had already found a suitable candidate to manage the Sky Water City! "No matter who you choose, no one is more suitable than us. We are from the Sky Water City..." a leader tried to speak tactfully to Zen, in the hopes of changing his mind.
<br><br>
Zen stopped abruptly. Slowly, he turned to face the leader. In a cold voice, he said, "You should consider yourself lucky that the Star Falcon race decided to flee. Otherwise, the Sky Water City would've been a slaughterhouse. You wouldn't have been able to escape."
<br><br>
The leader immediately shut up. Narrowing his eyes, Zen turned and proceeded to leave the city.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the distance, dozens of Souls of Light had gathered on the rooftops of several buildings in the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
These Souls of Light came from the Sun Crow race, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the New Moon race.
<br><br>
As they watched Zen's receding figure in the distance, their faces fell.
<br><br>
"Oh my God! First the Myriad Spirits City, now the Sky Water City!"
<br><br>
"What's worse, we even can't stay in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
"How did things get this far?"
<br><br>
The fact that the Star Falcon race was expelled meant that they lost the Sky Water City, and that their days of prosperity were coming to an end. There might be no place in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore for them to stay.
<br><br>
Chapter 3564 Challenge Before leaving the Myriad Spirits City, Zen had called back Clyde and Raul.
<br><br>
Raul now waited anxiously, pacing back and forth at the City Guard House, carrying a thick metal club.
<br><br>
No one dared approach him except for Clyde, the leader of the Guide Weasel race. The full force of Raul's manic attack was enough to smash any living being.
<br><br>
He and his team had been about to take over the Sky Water City when Zen's order came a few days ago.
<br><br>
Thinking of this made him restless. It left a bitter taste in his mouth.
<br><br>
On the other hand, he really was worried about Zen's and Elvinia's safety.
<br><br>
The Dark Region was much more dangerous than the Light Region. One couldn't act too rashly lest they risk their chance of survival.
<br><br>
At some point in the past few days, Raul had wanted to take the Giants to try to seize the Sky Water City again, but he had been stopped by Clyde.
<br><br>
Clyde refused to act without Zen's authorization. He was unconcerned about the remaining forces in the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
As Raul grew more anxious, Zen and Elvinia finally returned to the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
As soon as Raul laid eyes on Zen, he rushed over to him, alight with excitement. "Sir, you're back safe and sound!"
<br><br>
Zen knew that Raul's excitement was more about what his return implied for the Giant race, but the fact that an Other Shore creature was so concerned about his safety still touched him.
<br><br>
Inside the City Guard House hall, the core figures of the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race now gathered.
<br><br>
Clyde thought for a long time before posing his burning question to Zen.
<br><br>
"When will you attack the Sky Water City, Sir?"
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures of the Myriad Spirits City apparently didn't know that Zen had already been there. Zen told them this now.
<br><br>
"What?" Clyde was surprised by this.
<br><br>
"The Star Falcon race already fled the Sky Water City. You can bring your people to take it over. No one will put up any resistance," Zen continued.
<br><br>
The Star Falcon race's escape, of course, was futile. They were still on Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
After losing their base and suffering a heavy blow from Zen, they would not be able to recover immediately.
<br><br>
The only small mercy for them was that Zen had no interest in hunting down their remaining members himself. He left it to the large races of the Sky Water City and the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Three days later, the Giant race and the Guide Weasel race took control of the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
Sure enough, just as Zen had said, no one even tried to stop them from entering the city. In fact, the several large races in the city were scrambling to join them.
<br><br>
These large races would have posed some difficulty if they had decided to fight back as a united force. Clyde and Raul knew very well the only real reason they were able to take over the Sky Water City so smoothly was because of Zen.
<br><br>
Hence, Zen had now occupied the only two cities of Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
After the takeover of the Sky Water City, he invited the Pear Hill to establish a stronghold in the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill initially refused. They had seen no need for strongholds in any cities over the years.
<br><br>
However, Zen persuaded them to change their minds. He didn't want Yan to have to be so far away from him anymore.
<br><br>
With these developments, Stage Fourteen had effectively fallen into the control of the Oneness Sky Palace, or rather Zen.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were elated by the news.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace could never have imagined having this much influence in Stage Fourteen just two months ago.
<br><br>
The disciples on the first floor were now all in respectful awe of Zen.
<br><br>
A new month began a few days later.
<br><br>
According to the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, during this period, all disciples would automatically obtain a right to challenge other disciples on the same floor to determine their rankings.
<br><br>
The top ten disciples all coveted the number one spot held by Zen, and were intent on displacing him from the top rank.
<br><br>
They weren't able to do so at the beginning of last month because of Zen's closed-door cultivation. No one on the first floor had dared to disturb him.
<br><br>
But since today marked the beginning of another new month, the disciples on the first floor all either paused or finished their cultivation to challenge their opponents. The arena behind the bronze building was now teeming with disciples.
<br><br>
Zen also came to the arena, coming out of the room meant for the top rank and making his way to the front of the audience.
<br><br>
His arrival attracted many people's attention.
<br><br>
"Zen has finished his cultivation!"
<br><br>
"Is he going to challenge someone this time?"
<br><br>
"Will he challenge someone on the second floor?"
<br><br>
"That's possible!"
<br><br>
Zen ignored the hubbub around him and kept his eyes on the ongoing match in the arena.
<br><br>
Chaim was facing off with a senior disciple of the Land of Sword Grief, Layton Zhao, who was ranked 600th.
<br><br>
Chaim was a newcomer exercising his right of challenge only for the second time, but he already had the guts to challenge someone holding the 600th spot.
<br><br>
The newcomers had actually been all performing well, so far. Elvinia, Dorothy, Milo and some others had made it to the top 1, 000 at the beginning of last month, which was an admirable accomplishment.
<br><br>
The only reason their stellar performance largely went unrecognized was Zen, of course, outshone them all.
<br><br>
Clap! Clap! Clap! On the arena, Chaim hovered around Layton, moving like a gale.
<br><br>
Without using their Other Shore Tokens, they competed on physical strength and fighting techniques alone.
<br><br>
Layton had an absolute advantage in terms of physical strength, but his bodily movement skill was not as good as Chaim's. Every time he tried to approach Chaim, Chaim would deftly dodge.
<br><br>
Layton became a little impatient with Chaim's evasion.
<br><br>
He quickened his pace, meaning to force Chaim into a dead corner.
<br><br>
But it seemed Chaim could see through Layton's plan. With a slight twist of his shoulder, he flashed past Layton like a nimble fish.
<br><br>
Layton didn't expect this move. He inadvertently left his back exposed.
<br><br>
Chaim wouldn't miss such an opening.
<br><br>
He stopped mid-air and turned, gathering all his strength into three palm strikes on Layton.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
Chaim's every move was calculated. The reason he dared to make this challenge was that he had merged with a new Other Shore Token in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
The power given by the Other Shore Token from the Desire World was much stronger than that in the Lust World. This was what made Chaim so confident.
<br><br>
The three palm strikes were powerful. Each palm strike contained nearly three thousand divine megatons of force, and they overlapped with each other, magnifying their strength.
<br><br>
Layton reached the Chaotic Source Realm a long time ago. With long-term cultivation, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body had already made great progress. But even he couldn't put up a resistance in time.
<br><br>
The powerful palm force on his back slammed into his body. The Chaotic Source Spirits in his body started to lose energy. As the impact surged within him, he spat out a mouthful of blood.
<br><br>
Chaim had won the match. He turned to Layton and straightened up, his hands cupped neatly in front of him. "I won," Chaim said, with a curt bow.
<br><br>
Layton felt dejected. Losing to a newcomer was always humiliating. But he suddenly remembered Cleon, who had also lost to a newcomer. He started to feel a little better. He nodded civilly back to Chaim and left the arena.
<br><br>
"Layton was defeated?"
<br><br>
"We can't underestimate Chaim. He has only been in the Land of Sword Grief for one and a half months, but he has already been able to defeat someone of a much higher rank!"
<br><br>
"No matter how powerful he is, though, he is still no match for Zen."
<br><br>
When Chaim overheard this, he smiled sheepishly to himself.
<br><br>
The new Other Shore Token that he had merged with was a gift from the Ear Mouse race. And they only gave it to him because of Zen.
<br><br>
After all, everyone in the whole Myriad Spirits City was trying to get on Zen's good graces.
<br><br>
Admittedly, before entering the Chaotic Source World, Chaim had once thought he might have a chance against Zen.
<br><br>
By now, of course, he had realized how foolish it was to ever think that.
<br><br>
Chapter 3565 The Imperial Edict Chaim came down from the arena and noticed Zen off stage. Smiling, he asked, "Zen, have you finished your cultivation as well?"
<br><br>
Most of the disciples were watching the fight on the arena and only a few had seen Zen here, in front of it.
<br><br>
Chaim's words pricked the ears of all the disciples on the first floor, who suddenly turned towards Zen.
<br><br>
Zen had turned the City Guard House of the Myriad Spirits City into the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace. However, lately he'd spent most of his time either travelling away or communicating with the races in the city.
<br><br>
Getting an audience with him on the Other Shore was not easy.
<br><br>
However, in the Land of Sword Grief, he was a junior disciple. The difference in status between them was slight, so naturally this made them more comfortable in making requests of him.
<br><br>
"Hello, Zen! I seem to recall some race gifting you a rare golden turtle.
<br><br>
Could I have it please?"
<br><br>
"Zen, when will you distribute the soul crystal again?"
<br><br>
"Zen, I have received two hundred thousand soul pills. May I keep them for myself?"
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace was not very rich on the Other Shore. Even in the Desire World, the soul crystal was rare.
<br><br>
Neither finding the soul crystal nor obtaining soul pills was an easy task for the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, but they still had to share what they got with the stronghold.
<br><br>
The stronghold would take care of the disciples and distribute the resources according to their needs. However, several races in the Myriad Spirits City often blackmailed the Oneness Sky Palace before, forcing them to pay a large number of tributes every year. This imposed a heavy burden on the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
But once Zen had arrived, they didn't need to pay the tributes anymore.
<br><br>
Instead, the Myriad Spirits City now paid tributes to them, and so did the Sky Water City.
<br><br>
It seemed as though the resources of the entire Stage Fourteen rested in Zen's hands. How could the Land of Sword Grief's disciples not be jealous? Zen had already let Chaim and Dorothy distribute the resources once.
<br><br>
And all the disciples on the first floor had benefited greatly.
<br><br>
But the human beings' desire knew no bounds. The Oneness Sky Palace had been quite poor in the past. The disciples had to cultivate on their own because the palace didn't have many resources for them.
<br><br>
But Zen was now obscenely rich.
<br><br>
The disciples from Stage Fifteen, Stage Sixteen, and Stage Seventeen, as well as those from the higher stages such as Cleon, who was at the top of the first floor, intended to head back to Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Cleon might have a grudge against Zen but that mattered little compared to the soul crystal and the other benefits possible.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Zen was surrounded by the numerous disciples on the first floor.
<br><br>
"Well..."
<br><br>
Chaim had not at all anticipated a reaction like this when he greeted Zen.
<br><br>
Zen didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He certainly hadn't expected this either.
<br><br>
Seeing the crowd only growing larger, all he could do was wave his hand and yell out, "Everyone, please leave these dealings on the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
This rule was well understood by all.
<br><br>
But getting a meeting with Zen in the Myriad Spirits City was quite difficult. They had to turn to the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race. But Zen was here in person. They would not let this opportunity slip by.
<br><br>
"Talking about them here is the same as talking about them on the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
"We are both disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. There is no need to complicate things."
<br><br>
"Zen, I..."
<br><br>
"Shut up!"
<br><br>
A sharp and menacing voice bellowed over the rest.
<br><br>
Everyone turned to discover that it came from Dorothy.
<br><br>
Zen had carried Dorothy all the way from Stage Thirteen to Stage Fourteen that day. The disciples were aware of their relationship and the knowledge of it had spread through the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
Moreover, Dorothy was held in high esteem and so no one would dare to respond to her cold rebuke.
<br><br>
"If you need or want to do something, turn to Chaim. He will record your requests. If your requests are reasonable, Zen will fulfill them. He may have taken over the Myriad Spirits City but the resources are not limitless. You should know that he doesn't owe you anything," Dorothy continued.
<br><br>
After occupying the Myriad Spirits City, Zen had given the resources he had collected to Chaim for allocation and hadn't imposed any restrictions.
<br><br>
Almost all the requests of the disciples were granted.
<br><br>
But human beings were all greedy. The disciples on the first floor waited eagerly in the Myriad Spirits City. Apart from the share left for Zen, the resources that were collected were instantly divided up by them.
<br><br>
If things continued this way, it wouldn't be long before all the disciples on the first floor were waiting in the Myriad Spirits City for Zen to raise them.
<br><br>
This was not only disadvantageous for Zen, but for all the disciples of the entire Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
"Princess Dorothy is right. Zen has asked me to act on his behalf. If you have any requests, present them to me," Chaim responded with a smile.
<br><br>
However, their demands were mostly excessive and unreasonable and Chaim would not agree to them. Plus, Dorothy's words had upset them.
<br><br>
"Humph, what's the use of turning to you?"
<br><br>
"It's said that the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race turn in as much as ten thousand finger-size chunks of soul crystal every month, but we get only one finger-size chunk."
<br><br>
"Chaim, I have already asked you to help me get an Other Shore Token from Clyde. It's not a difficult task, yet you refused me point blank."
<br><br>
The disciples who had just been fawning over Zen now flipped their attitudes to blame Chaim.
<br><br>
It implied that Zen was under fire too.
<br><br>
But they dared not offend Zen and instead targeted Chaim.
<br><br>
Zen frowned at their sudden change in attitude.
<br><br>
He knew he would obtain a massive amount of resources when he occupied the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
The resources in Stage Fourteen were too many for just him. As a member of the Oneness Sky Palace, he figured he should repay the palace. He was also willing to share some of the resources with the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief but he had never expected this reaction.
<br><br>
Just then, from the back door of the bronze building, Elvinia walked out. In an icy tone she said, "Do not cut down the tree that gives you shade. You were bullied in the Myriad Spirits City for ages and said nothing. Now that Zen and I have taken it, you can't seem to ask for enough."
<br><br>
Elvinia had also contributed to the prosperity of the Oneness Sky Palace in Stage Fourteen. Her words left everyone dead silent.
<br><br>
Some were still not satisfied. From the corner, Abdul suddenly spoke out, "According to the law of the Land of Sword Grief, the disciples should turn in half of the resources they have got and the remainder should then be distributed among the rest of us. We have followed this law before, so the requests we make..."
<br><br>
Before he could finish, a golden scroll appeared in Elvinia's hand. She sneered and opened the scroll. "The imperial edict of Eastern Emperor Taiyi says that all the resources Zen and I obtain belong to us. We don't need to share them with the Land of Sword Grief. We can distribute them as we like. Read the edict carefully!" she growled.
<br><br>
Elvinia would show no politeness towards these despicable ingrates.
<br><br>
Chapter 3566 Rocco Zheng Upon saying those words, Elvinia threw the scroll she held behind her.
<br><br>
Like an arrow being released from its bow, the golden scroll was nailed to the door. Its contents were revealed for all to see.
<br><br>
Of course, the imperial edict on the scroll that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had personally issued was not as straight forward as what Elvinia had said. But they almost had the same meaning.
<br><br>
While Zen was busy with his cultivation over the past few days, Elvinia spent that time staying in the Myriad Spirits City. This allowed her to get in contact more frequently and better with the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
As for the problem regarding resource distribution, it was one that she had already expected.
<br><br>
Despite Stage Fourteen being at the bottom of the Desire World, the rules it enforced were not to be ignored. Otherwise, everything would fall into utter chaos.
<br><br>
Once Elvinia secretly made her return to the Phoenix Palace, she went straight to Eastern Emperor Taiyi to request that he issue an imperial edict.
<br><br>
The jaws of the disciples on the first floor dropped once they saw the imperial edict.
<br><br>
They were hoping for more. Elvinia's move caught them all by surprise. No one could disobey Eastern Emperor Taiyi's order.
<br><br>
The noisy crowd fell silent.
<br><br>
If what Elvinia said was true, they wouldn't be able to secure the resources they wanted.
<br><br>
"According to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, you're able to distribute the resources as you like. I'm curious as to how you plan to do that?" someone asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
Elvinia shrugged and then nodded towards Zen.
<br><br>
The disciples were met with his indifferent glance.
<br><br>
He had already tried his best to satisfy them before. But of course, as was human nature, they always longed for more. "As I've said before," Zen sneered, "Chaim will be distributing the resources on my behalf."
<br><br>
In fact, the imperial edict that Elvinia took out served as a "stick"—a part of the "carrot and stick". Once the reckless disciples recieved the "carrot" Zen gave them, they would thank him profusely.
<br><br>
"If you have any requests, you can approach me. Now, line up!" Chaim announced with a smile.
<br><br>
Now that the resource distribution problem was settled, no further complications would arise under Chaim's supervision.
<br><br>
Soon, a few disciples proceeded to jump onto the arena to compete for their rankings.
<br><br>
They all chose to challenge their equals. None of them dared to challenge Zen.
<br><br>
There were two reasons for this. First, Zen was known for his high position on the Other Shore. Second, the image of him defeating Cleon was still vivid in their minds. They all agreed that Zen was anything but weak.
<br><br>
Zen took his time and silently observed the arena.
<br><br>
More than 10 matches were held before he finally walked up to the arena.
<br><br>
Although none of them dared to walk up to meet him, he could always choose an opponent to challenge.
<br><br>
The crowd watching had an expectant look on all their faces as they focused on Zen standing in the center of the arena.
<br><br>
"Zen plans on challenging someone from the second floor this time, right?"
<br><br>
"Once he joined the Land of Sword Grief, he bagged first place. Do you think his second battle will be enough to get him to the second floor?"
<br><br>
"That's impossible! But maybe he'll be different…"
<br><br>
Zen became famous among the crowd for the skills he showed in the Land of Sword Grief and on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to reveal who he was about to challenge next, those who were on the second floor looked down into the arena below them.
<br><br>
Two hundred and three people occupied the entire second floor.
<br><br>
They were much stronger than those disciples on the first floor.
<br><br>
Even the lowest-ranking member of the second floor, Ronnie, was stronger than Cleon.
<br><br>
Cleon had challenged Ronnie several times before to try and reach the second floor. Each time, however, he was met with a miserable defeat.
<br><br>
A single place was what separated Cleon and Ronnie, but it was a rather large gap between the first floor and second floor.
<br><br>
"I'm guessing Zen's planning on challenging you, Ronnie," a fair-skinned man hinted with a smile.
<br><br>
Next to the man stood Yusuf who nodded in agreement and added, "If he defeats you, he'll make it to the second floor. That'll be his first step!"
<br><br>
Ronnie, with his dark complexion, stood next to the two. He garnered the last position among those on the second floor.
<br><br>
"Let's be honest," Ronnie began to say with pride, "he doesn't have enough strength to withstand the second floor."
<br><br>
"Don't get too cocky now, Ronnie. That might not be the case," Yusuf warned with the shake of his head. "Don't forget that he's occupied Stage Fourteen due to his exceptional capabilities!"
<br><br>
"Regardless, he's still not strong enough to challenge me," Ronnie retorted.
<br><br>
"Besides, the fact that he reached the Chaotic Source Realm not too long ago just tells me that he might have relied on some unorthodox skills to get this far. I will surely defeat him if he decides to challenge me!"
<br><br>
As luck would have it, Zen pointed towards Ronnie from the arena.
<br><br>
"So he does want to challenge me?" A cold expression flashed across Ronnie's face. Despite being on the second floor, he didn't take much pride in being the last place because it constantly concerned him. Now that Zen challenged him, he felt somehow upset. "Well then, I guess it's time to show him the true strength of a disciple on the second floor…"
<br><br>
As Ronnie began to prepare himself for the upcoming battle, Zen said, "I want to challenge Rocco Zheng of the second floor!" It turned out he was not pointing towards Ronnie but the second floor he was on.
<br><br>
A wave of silence swept over the arena before a deafening uproar broke it —an ocean wave crashing on the sandy shore.
<br><br>
"Zen wants to challenge Rocco!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God!"
<br><br>
"First he challenged Cleon, the top contender on the first floor. Now he wants to challenge the top contender on the second floor? This guy is nuts! Does that mean he'll challenge Libby, who ranks first in the Land of Sword Grief, next time?"
<br><br>
"He will sooner or later. But he's only been in the Land of Sword Grief for less than two months…"
<br><br>
Who exactly was Rocco? He challenged someone from the third floor seven years ago. Once he failed, he had no intention of committing the same mistake ever again. All of the disciples on the second floor continued to challenge him, but none was successful in taking him down.
<br><br>
While all two hundred and two disciples were on the same level, they knew that he'd always be one level higher—for now, at least.
<br><br>
The faces of everyone on the second floor, including the fair-skinned man, Yusuf, and Ronnie, were incomprehensible. With the flick of his wrist, the fair-skinned man unraveled his folding fan before turning to Ronnie. "I'm afraid we guessed wrong. He doesn't consider you a worthy opponent."
<br><br>
"He doesn't consider you as one, either," Ronnie retorted.
<br><br>
"We're all on the same boat, then," Yusuf voiced out with a chuckle.
<br><br>
None of them expected Zen to skip them and go ahead for the all-powerful Rocco.
<br><br>
Chaim, Milo, and Dorothy were just as dumbfounded as the others. Was Zen planning to activate the Inheritance of World here? If he wasn't, then challenging Rocco would be asking for a death wish. The gap between their levels of power was too wide.
<br><br>
"Rocco is somewhere else, at the moment. I'll relay your challenge right now!" one of the bystanders announced.
<br><br>
Many of those on the second floor started to mumble and buzz like bees in a hive, keeping themselves busy to fill in the awkward silence. They hoped that it wouldn't be too difficult for the bystander to find Rocco. Then, the real challenge would begin.
<br><br>
Chapter 3567 On The Arena The rightmost cultivation room of the second floor belonged to Rocco.
<br><br>
Everyone knew that disturbing another's cultivation in seclusion was prohibited. However, in the Land of Sword Grief, the right of challenge could be exercised on the first day of each month.
<br><br>
And unless the person being challenged was stranded on the Other Shore, they had no choice but to take up the challenge.
<br><br>
Rocco had just returned from the Other Shore several days ago, where he had found clues about a temple. Based on his findings, he was very likely to discover a temple that had been hidden for a long time.
<br><br>
Today, he sorted out all the clues he'd gathered and planned to go out.
<br><br>
However, he had to decipher three Sanskrit words among the clues before moving forward.
<br><br>
Aside from Eastern Emperor Taiyi, there were a few others who could decipher Sanskrit words in the Oneness Sky Palace. But he knew that if he sought out help from these people, he would have to shell out too much.
<br><br>
Plus, it might take a while for them to decipher the words, but he did not have any time to waste.
<br><br>
Even so, Rocco didn't have many choices. He considered even consulting the people by Clear Lake who could also decipher Sanskrit words, but he learned that they worked even slower than those in the Oneness Sky Palace to begin with.
<br><br>
"Tap-tap..."
<br><br>
Just then, someone knocked on the door.
<br><br>
The sound of the knock brought him an overwhelming sensation of annoyance.
<br><br>
It reminded him that today was the first day of the month, meaning that it was the challenge day in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
All the disciples on the second floor wanted Rocco to be pulled down from his position. Over the years, he had been challenged many times, but people had always failed to knock him down.
<br><br>
Around four months ago, Rocco grew tired of the endless challenges that he injured one challenger badly. As a result, the other disciples grew afraid and stopped challenging him.
<br><br>
After that fight, Rocco had lived a peaceful life. Having grown used to the silence, he did not expect to be challenged so soon.
<br><br>
'Maybe I did not injure the last guy enough, ' he thought.
<br><br>
Rocco opened the door to see a man standing before him. The man was ranked 168th on the second floor.
<br><br>
"You? You dare to challenge me?" Rocco questioned the man, his face stiff and cold.
<br><br>
The man smiled awkwardly and said, "I wouldn't dare."
<br><br>
Only a handful of people on the second floor dare challenge Rocco, and obviously, this man was not one of them.
<br><br>
"Then who is it?" Rocco asked again.
<br><br>
"The challenger's name is Zen Luo," the man replied in a flustered manner.
<br><br>
"He's already standing in the arena."
<br><br>
"Zen Luo? His name does not ring a bell." Rocco shook his head, surprised to hear Zen's name.
<br><br>
He had been isolated in his secluded cultivation room for so long that he had no clue about the recent happenings in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
The name was not familiar at all. Rocco doubted if Zen was on the second floor.
<br><br>
The confusion across Rocco's face sent the other man laughing. "That guy is the number one disciple on the first floor," he chucked. "He hasn't even stepped foot onto the second floor yet."
<br><br>
Hearing that the number one disciple on the first floor had challenged him confused him. Rocco was the number one disciple of the second floor, and Zen had no idea what was coming to him.
<br><br>
Rocco's face grew stiff again, with a hint of a smirk.
<br><br>
The second floor's top ten disciples had to think twice before challenging Rocco, so who did this "Zen" guy think he was? Did he want to get injured? Did he want to die? As he walked out of the cultivation room with the man beside him, he couldn't help but ask, "Does this guy know what he signed up for?"
<br><br>
He then caught a glimpse of the arena from a window on the second floor.
<br><br>
In the arena, a man stood with his hands behind him. He looked intently at the second floor with bright eyes and a confident stature.
<br><br>
This was Zen, waiting patiently for his opponent to arrive.
<br><br>
When people saw Rocco beside the window, an uproar in the arena suddenly burst.
<br><br>
"Rocco has come out!"
<br><br>
"It seems he'll accept the challenge!"
<br><br>
"I'd like to see if Zen will create one more miracle this time..."
<br><br>
The crowd was jeering, with people hoping for Zen to win, despite their belief that he could never beat Rocco.
<br><br>
Zen had made a miracle before, but asking for another one seemed nearly impossible at this point.
<br><br>
The disciples on the second floor, including Yusuf and Ronnie, also fixed their eyes on Rocco. All they could think of was how Rocco would react to this challenger.
<br><br>
Everyone knew that Rocco was in no mood for a challenge. However, because Zen was the number one disciple on the first floor, he had the right to challenge Rocco, while Rocco had no right to refuse.
<br><br>
"I heard that you want to challenge me?" Rocco shouted towards the arena, "How dare you?!"
<br><br>
He stared at Zen coldly, as if his gaze alone would make him retreat.
<br><br>
It was like a giant looking down at an ant.
<br><br>
It was obvious that Rocco had no idea who Zen was, nor the battles he had won before. If he did, he probably would have watched his tongue.
<br><br>
All he knew was that Zen was a new, prominent disciple on the first floor who had grown so proud. So proud that he wanted to challenge the number one disciple on the second floor.
<br><br>
Zen cocked his head towards Rocco's direction and stared back. "This is my right, one that every disciple in the Land of Sword Grief is granted." He spoke with a sudden calmness.
<br><br>
"Is that so?"
<br><br>
Rocco stepped out of the window.
<br><br>
Every time he took a step forward, fist-sized blocks hovered beneath his feet, catching them. They formed stairs for him to walk safely to the arena.
<br><br>
This was a theurgy of the Truth of Void Destruction.
<br><br>
Eventually, he made it down safely from the second floor and onto the arena. "I don't have time to play games with you," he said. "I know you have the right to challenge me, but you should just give up now while you have the chance. There are many others who are on your level."
<br><br>
Rocco pointed to the second floor.
<br><br>
At this point, disciples on the second floor left their cultivation rooms and stood by the windows to get a glimpse of the fun.
<br><br>
After spending so much time alone, Rocco was surprisingly patient.
<br><br>
If this were happening four months ago, he wouldn't have even warned Zen.
<br><br>
But now that he had given Zen an opportunity to surrender, Rocco thought that Zen would have done it by now.
<br><br>
To his surprise, Zen was unmoved by the gesture. "I'm not interested in you," Zen spat back. "The reason why I wanted to challenge you is because you hold first place on the second floor. I can't challenge the third floor unless I defeat you first. So, naturally, I have to get rid of you first." Zen spoke so confidently that it surprised people who didn't know him.
<br><br>
However, those who did know him were not surprised at all. This was the typical Zen.
<br><br>
After all, Zen's performance had already surpassed Libby's. It was only a matter of time before he stepped onto the third floor.
<br><br>
But still, those who had no idea who Zen was couldn't help but gasp.
<br><br>
"What happened while I was cultivating in seclusion?" a random disciple whispered. "Where does this arrogant guy come from?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3568 Confusion To the second-floor disciples who didn't know Zen, it looked as if Rocco had tolerated Zen and was even considerate enough to not put him in an awkward situation.
<br><br>
Zen's insistence in challenging him only showed his ungrateful and reckless nature.
<br><br>
Yusuf shook his head and smiled. "He came out of nowhere. He's a new disciple and has only been in the Land of Sword Grief for less than two months."
<br><br>
"Maybe two months weren't enough for him to know the Land of Sword Grief's situation..." The disciple's words faltered when he realized something. "Wait!"
<br><br>
This guy was ranked first on the first floor but he had only been here for two months. Did that mean it only took him two months to nab the top spot? "Two months? Are you serious, Yusuf?" he asked. The disbelief was clearly obvious on his face.
<br><br>
Those on the second floor all had been on the first floor too. Becoming the number one fighter on the first floor was incredibly difficult, but Zen was able to do it in two months? That was impossible! None of the disciples on the second floor could believe this.
<br><br>
"Not in two months," Yusuf clarified.
<br><br>
The disciples relaxed hearing this. They thought perhaps there was a misunderstanding, so they waited for Yusuf's explanation. However, what he said next shocked them even more. "On his first day entering the Land of Sword Grief, he defeated Cleon and became number one."
<br><br>
Not two months, but only a day! Yusuf squinted at the scene below. "It doesn't really matter though. The fact remains that he wants to challenge Rocco after less than two months."
<br><br>
A genius at Zen's level was rare, even in the Oneness Sky Palace. He was very confident too since he dared to challenge Rocco in just a short amount of time.
<br><br>
Where exactly did his confidence come from? Even Rocco himself was confused at Zen's brashness. Did he have some sort of secret technique? A magical ace up his sleeves? "Rocco!" another disciple shouted from above. "Don't underestimate this guy! He ranked first on the first floor on his first day of entering the Land of Sword Grief!"
<br><br>
This piece of information greatly cleared up all the speculation in Rocco's head.
<br><br>
Now he understood why Zen was so confident! "Ranking first on your first day! Outstanding," he couldn't help but remark in amazement. "There has never been such an amazing person that appeared in the Oneness Sky Palace before. Not even Libby was able to do it. That's a really outstanding feat, but I still think it's too early for you to challenge me."
<br><br>
Rocco waved his hands and the Other Shore Power surged throughout his whole body.
<br><br>
A strange aura emanated from him, plunging the arena into a state of intense pressure.
<br><br>
The flash of murderous intent in his eyes did not go unnoticed by Zen.
<br><br>
Rocco had been ranked first on the second floor for quite a long time now.
<br><br>
He even challenged the disciples on the third floor before, but he always failed. In the earlier days, someone even had defeated him and got promoted to the third floor. Rocco knew that a talent like Zen was also destined to reach third floor one day.
<br><br>
The thought made him burn with jealousy.
<br><br>
Just now, he only planned to teach Zen a lesson, but that slight twinge of resentment made him want to kill the brat.
<br><br>
Those watching could only stare in wide-eyed wonder at the sudden power that surged out of Rocco's body.
<br><br>
They all knew Rocco was number one on the second floor but none of them ever expected his power to actually be this great. His power was condensed in an almost solid state of pressure, as if he could crush a person with one move.
<br><br>
"It's a pity I can't use the ability of the Other Shore Token on the arena, otherwise I could increase my strength threefold..." Rocco murmured to himself.
<br><br>
When Zen felt Rocco's power, he became just a bit more serious about this challenge he was proposing. His opponent had just extracted more than five thousand divine megatons of power on a whim. Who knew what his limit was? Not only that, Rocco's Other Shore Token could even increase his strength threefold. It was fortunate that he couldn't use it in the arena.
<br><br>
As soon as Rocco finished talking, he jumped and immediately pounced.
<br><br>
He was determined to make the first move and didn't give Zen any sort of warning whatsoever.
<br><br>
He raised his hand and allowed the Other Shore Power to rush towards his right hand, forming a powerful spiral.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
This powerful fist was headed straight towards Zen! There was no need to be stupid and try to take on Rocco's punch. Zen immediately side-stepped and dodged.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Instead of Zen, Rocco's fist hit the ground and made the entire arena shake violently. The array flickered momentarily, having taken the brunt of his attack.
<br><br>
"You shouldn't dodge like a coward!" Rocco exclaimed.
<br><br>
"Since you were the one to propose the challenge, you should face me like a man!"
<br><br>
Disciples mainly competed in terms of Chaotic Source Spirits and Other Shore Power here in the arena of the Land of Sword Grief. There wasn't really any other skill to prove beside those two.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Zen decided not to dodge Rocco's second punch. Instead, he reached out and tried to block his fist! Rocco snickered at Zen's chosen move.
<br><br>
"Idiot..."
<br><br>
He didn't think Zen would take his words so seriously. Rocco only said that to rile him up, but it seemed to have worked since the young man was now determined to face him head-on.
<br><br>
How could such a stupid person become number one so easily? There was no way Zen was going to survive his explosive power now.
<br><br>
Maybe those guys on the second floor lied to him? It didn't really matter though.
<br><br>
Zen was going to lose this fight after this punch.
<br><br>
Would he die? That depended on his luck. Rocco didn't really have the time to dally with these first-floor fighters since he had to deal with the Sanskrit words. His only choice was to go all out and finish the fight as fast as possible without any heed for the consequences.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Just as he expected, Zen had been unable to block his punch with his hands.
<br><br>
As a result, Rocco's fist directly collided with his chest.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The force was enough to send Zen all the way to the edge of the arena. He would've fallen, had he not stopped himself at the last moment.
<br><br>
Any other ordinary warrior would've been pleased by this result.
<br><br>
However, there was nothing but a serious frown on Rocco's face because he expected more.
<br><br>
That punch should've pierced through Zen's chest and made his internal organs collapse! However, Rocco had failed to tire out Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Did that mean Zen had already cultivated the Chaotic Source Spirits to the middle stage? Once the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace reached the Chaotic Source Realm, they would immediately get recruited in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
Did Zen also just reach the Chaotic Source Realm? Rocco looked at Zen in confusion. "How long have you been in the Chaotic Source Realm?" he asked.
<br><br>
Chapter 3569 Overwhelming Force Generally speaking, the three floors of the Land of Sword Grief represented the three stages of the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
At that moment, Rocco did not use his full strength--but the power he had just unleashed was impossible for someone who had just entered the Chaotic Source Realm to resist.
<br><br>
They said that Zen had just entered the Land of Sword Grief less than two months ago, so he also entered the Chaotic Source Realm not long ago? It should be impossible...
<br><br>
His Chaotic Source Spirits weren't exhausted yet after they took his punch.
<br><br>
It was true that Zen was at the middle stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, but how did he reach this stage in just two months? There was only one possibility. Many years ago, Zen had already stepped into the Chaotic Source Realm, but the Land of Sword Grief had just recently received him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Rocco joined the Land of Sword Grief long after he had entered the Chaotic Source Realm. Although his case was rare, it still existed.
<br><br>
"How long?" Zen didn't expect for Rocco to ask about such a thing. He lowered his head and thought for a while, then he said, "About three months."
<br><br>
Upon hearing his words, Rocco's face darkened. "Do you think I'm a fool? It's impossible for you to get to the middle stage of the Chaotic Source Realm in around three months!" he bellowed.
<br><br>
He refused to believe Zen's words at all! The new disciples around the arena began to speak and assure him that Zen was correct.
<br><br>
"Just only three months. Zen is one of us!"
<br><br>
"How could it be wrong as we all entered the Chaotic Source World together?"
<br><br>
"Yes. Exactly speaking, it's three months and nine days!"
<br><br>
At the sight of those disciples' affirmative looks, Rocco was completely confused.
<br><br>
Just then, Yusuf who was on the second floor said loudly, "Rocco, Zen is a disciple of our Flow Sword Sect! He is indeed one of those disciples who have just entered the Chaotic Source Realm."
<br><br>
Since Rocco knew Yusuf, he knew that the man wouldn't lie to him.
<br><br>
After Yusuf's confirmation, Rocco was even more confused. He stared curiously at Zen and asked, "Then how did you do it?"
<br><br>
He wasn't the only one who was dumbfounded. Some people with insight even guessed that Zen had made rapid progress ever since he had obtained the Chaotic Source Spirits. There must be some secrets he was hiding! Then again, there was actually a limit to the "rapid progress" that everyone believed. They had thought he might be only two times faster than the others.
<br><br>
But now, Rocco believed that Zen had stepped into the middle stage of the Chaotic Source Realm. That was not the kind of rapid progress they had thought! To put it simply, that was super rapid progress! Zen looked nonchalantly at Rocco and said, "You have also stepped into the Chaotic Source Realm. Why did you ask such a naive question?"
<br><br>
In order to become stronger, warriors naturally tried every means possible to improve. Moreover, it wasn't unusual that everyone had their own secrets. Why would they expose their secrets to other people anyway? As for the secret of the True Enlightenment, Zen could expose it to the Oneness Sky Palace to make contributions to the orthodox swordsmanship.
<br><br>
But, how could he tell the others the secrets of his body and the Truth of Godly Way? "Naive?" Rocco hissed.
<br><br>
"Since you don't want to tell me, then I guess I'll have to investigate it myself!"
<br><br>
When he was done speaking, he took a step forward.
<br><br>
A strange ripple appeared inside the whole arena. The ripple seemed to have come from a feather-light step, but it actually contained a great amount of power. Suddenly, Rocco had disappeared in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Even the disciples on the first floor below the arena couldn't see Rocco.
<br><br>
Only a few people on the second floor had thought of looking up, and saw Rocco's figure flying above.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen hesitated just for a second when he saw Rocco disappear. Then ripples appeared in the arena again. He was now in the center of the ripples! "He's up there!"
<br><br>
Zen instinctively looked up, but he quickly frowned.
<br><br>
"It's too late," said Yusuf as he shook his head.
<br><br>
"That guy can't avoid this step." The fair-skinned man echoed Yusuf's sentiments.
<br><br>
"Rocco is very serious this time. His step may contain 7, 000 divine megatons of the Other Shore Power. I'm afraid that Zen might end up disabled!" Ronnie agreed.
<br><br>
No matter how talented Zen was, his skills were still too far from Rocco's.
<br><br>
If he could constantly dodge and consume Rocco's strength, then he might have a slight chance of winning. However, it was almost impossible to do such a thing.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen realized that, he had no room to dodge. Of course, the consequences of withstanding such attacks weren't hard to imagine.
<br><br>
However, some of the disciples on the first floor who watched the fight felt differently about it.
<br><br>
Some of them looked pleased to see Zen in misfortune. But Elvinia and her companions were genuinely worried and actually cared about Zen.
<br><br>
It was known that Rocco was the number one warrior on the second floor.
<br><br>
Thus, it was too difficult for Zen to challenge him.
<br><br>
Despite that, Zen did not have the slightest intention of dodging this time! He slightly tilted his body, then the Civilization Artifact released majestic Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
He knew that even if the Regal Jade Civilization was restrained in Stage Thirteen, its Civilization Artifact could still unleash eight thousand divine megatons of force! Back when he had been previously limited by his physical body, he could only use such a powerful force while activating the Inheritance of World.
<br><br>
Now as he had stepped into the middle stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, his Chaotic Source Spirits were able to bear four to five thousand divine megatons of force. Furthermore, the Truth of Godly Way in his body could greatly increase the Chaotic Source Spirits' ability to contain force.
<br><br>
Splash! The Civilization Artifact finally unleashed the Other Shore Power contained inside it. Almost all of the Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's body were maxed out to the limit, while the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits swelled up one by one and bulged on his skin.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits were almost on the edge of exhaustion, but at the same time, he infused them with the Truth of Godly Way to maintain their original state.
<br><br>
"Eight thousand divine megatons of force!"
<br><br>
At that point, he directed his punch straight to Rocco's foot sole! Yet, Rocco didn't take Zen's attack seriously. The truth was, he wanted to cripple Zen, then find the secret of rapid progress from him. If he could really know this secret, he would have a chance to get a place on the third floor and perhaps even defeat Libby, an unrivaled talent and the strongest warrior on that floor.
<br><br>
The moment he stepped down, however, he felt a strong force come from his right foot. He could tell that the force was stronger than his own! "How is that possible?" Rocco exclaimed in utter shock. "Click! Click! Click!"
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits that glimmered in Rocco's body were immediately extinguished.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the force had rapidly spread from his right leg to his whole body! "Crack! Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
In the next second, the power that hadn't been offset by his Chaotic Source Spirits started to invade his whole being.
<br><br>
Specifically, the force that went up along his right leg travelled to his right arm and the right side of his body, then broke them with a crisp sound.
<br><br>
Almost without any resistance, he miserably fell out of the arena with a soft thud.
<br><br>
Nothing but silence filled the whole land.
<br><br>
Chapter 3570 The Second Imperial Edict Everyone present couldn't say anything, and they were all stunned in silence.
<br><br>
The disciples on the second floor just stared blankly at Zen on the arena.
<br><br>
At first, they simply wanted to have fun and let Rocco, the number one warrior on the second floor, teach him a lesson. Therefore, someone took the initiative to call Rocco over.
<br><br>
Even though Zen was extraordinarily talented, he had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
It was already a great miracle that he had defeated Cleon, and they believed he couldn't possibly fight Rocco back.
<br><br>
However, he still fought head on. He didn't rely on his strong body alone but instead, he used both his body and strength to defeat Rocco in a face-toface combat.
<br><br>
After he had won that round, he jumped from being the number one on the first floor to the number one on the second floor, and subsequently passed all the disciples on the second floor.
<br><br>
The deathly silence lasted for a long time. Finally, Yusuf who was on the second floor opened his mouth and said, "This is too crazy..." "He has directly become the number one on the second floor. My God!" Ronnie exclaimed with eyes as wide as saucers.
<br><br>
"I've been on the second floor for several hundred years, but I haven't even made it to the top one hundred!" another disciple commented. "What's more is that he is only in the fourteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm," the fairskinned man muttered.
<br><br>
Overall, the competition on the second floor was much fiercer than it was on the first floor. There were only two hundred and three people competing, but it was extremely difficult to advance even just one place.
<br><br>
Many people on the second floor had stayed there for countless years, and their names had remained in the same places on the Ranking Stone.
<br><br>
It was certainly not an easy thing for them to improve their rankings.
<br><br>
Chaim, who was watching under the arena, was also taken aback.
<br><br>
As a new comer like Zen, he naturally paid attention to Zen's strength.
<br><br>
Zen had unleashed more than eight thousand divine megatons of force in the Chaotic Source World, but that terrifying amount of power was way beyond what he could endure.
<br><br>
If one wanted to use seven or eight thousand divine megatons of force without the help of the Inheritance of World, they would have to practice in the Chaotic Source Realm for many years. However, Zen had done such a thing so easily! His growth speed was simply too fast. If he continued at that rate, he would probably leave the Land of Sword Grief soon.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Rocco lay on the ground in pain. He stretched out his left hand to grab his right arm and gently twisted it. The broken bone in his arm quickly returned to its original position. After that, he continued to press on his chest, all the way to his right leg, until the bones on the right side of his body were corrected.
<br><br>
After that, an Other Shore Token appeared above his head. The Other Shore Token spun around and a green light covered his head, which then instantly healed all the wounds on the right side of his body.
<br><br>
Then he got up from the ground, took a look at Zen, and left.
<br><br>
It was known that Rocco was an aloof and arrogant man. Thus, it was like a big joke to him to lose to the number one warrior on the first floor.
<br><br>
Like the others, he was also quite confused, but it was obvious that Zen wouldn't ease his doubts. Therefore, he didn't want to stay any longer.
<br><br>
Once he was gone, the disciples on the first floor released their uncontrollable excitement.
<br><br>
"Zen won so easily!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God! Especially when I know Rocco is simply an invincible existence…"
<br><br>
"There are very few people who can make it to the third floor these years.
<br><br>
Rocco should be the most promising one. I didn't expect that Zen would replace him…"
<br><br>
The disciples on the first floor let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
Since Zen had been above all of them from the very first day, quite a number of disciples naturally felt ashamed. However, they felt a bit better when he had surpassed even the disciples on the second floor.
<br><br>
Now, the powerful warriors on the third floor might be able to defeat him.
<br><br>
His name on the Ranking Stone on the first floor quietly disappeared and at the same time, everyone's rankings went up by one place. Even Cleon, who Zen had previously defeated, was no exception.
<br><br>
Truth be told, Cleon had mixed feelings about returning to the first place on the first floor in such a way. Still, he now understood that he truly couldn't fight against Zen. In just two months, their skills already differed greatly from each other.
<br><br>
Cleon calmed down a little at this thought.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Ranking Stone on the second floor showed that more than two hundred people had all dropped by one place, and Zen was ranked first. Therefore, Rocco had to give up his cultivation room on the second floor to Zen.
<br><br>
While all of those happened, the battle on the arena continued.
<br><br>
In order to compete for the rankings at the beginning of each month, the battle would last for a few days. It also went without saying that the rankings on the Ranking Stone would change as well.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen came down from the arena, Dorothy immediately went up to him.
<br><br>
"Congratulations, Zen. You've made it to the second floor so fast!" she said excitedly. "Are you going to challenge Libby and take the top ranking of the Land of Sword Grief next month?" Chaim asked with a laugh.
<br><br>
"Take the top ranking of the Land of Sword Grief?" Zen thought about it for a while, shook his head and smiled. "I can't do that in a month. You must be kidding," he chided.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the disciples on the third floor were almost on par with the likes of Athemar. If they left the Land of Sword Grief, they would have the chance to become Oneness Governors. Still, it would be difficult for Zen to fight them straight, even if he activated the Inheritance of World.
<br><br>
It was simply too hard for him to do all of those in only a span of a month.
<br><br>
"Well, I'll give you two months!" Dorothy pursed her lips and smiled.
<br><br>
"Can you give me more time?" Zen asked bitterly.
<br><br>
"No." Dorothy shook her head, pretending to be serious. Just then, Elvinia appeared beside Zen.
<br><br>
She glanced coldly at Dorothy and said, "I just announced one imperial edict. In fact, my father has issued two imperial edicts."
<br><br>
"What's the second imperial edict about?" Zen asked in surprise.
<br><br>
"My father wants to see you. Now follow me to the Phoenix Palace," she told him.
<br><br>
'Eastern Emperor Taiyi wants to see me?' Zen thought, surprised.
<br><br>
His mind subconsciously thought about the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Fortunately, his son had deciphered the Truth Enlightenment, but he hadn't completely comprehended it.
<br><br>
If Eastern Emperor Taiyi urged him, he would only offer five hundred words at most.
<br><br>
"Why does Eastern Emperor Taiyi want to see me?" In reality, he actually wanted to hesitate.
<br><br>
"You'll know when you meet him."
<br><br>
Elvinia grabbed Zen's arm and pulled him away, leaving Dorothy stunned as she watched the two of them leave.
<br><br>
As for Chaim, he was in deep thought. "Is Eastern Emperor Taiyi going to grant Zen a marriage?" he asked out of the blue.
<br><br>
"What?" Obviously, Dorothy was shocked! When Chaim saw how Dorothy looked, he immediately realized that he had said something wrong. "It's not necessarily true. It's probably because of what happened within Stage Fourteen," he said hastily.
<br><br>
Although Chaim tried to explain, Dorothy was already at a loss.
<br><br>
Elvinia had already fallen in love with Zen, and Zen had made a name for himself. Eastern Emperor Taiyi might really grant him a marriage.
<br><br>
Dorothy was too reserved when it came to relationships. Now, she felt a greater sense of anxiety.
<br><br>
Her lips curved into a deep frown and she swam in her thoughts for a long time. After a while, it seemed that she had finally made a difficult decision.
<br><br>
She left the Land of Sword Grief alone and headed straight for the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Chapter 3571 Writing It Down In the very center of the Phoenix Palace was the magnificent Supreme Dragon Hall.
<br><br>
If there was an important guest, or any important event to be held, this was where Eastern Emperor Taiyi would be.
<br><br>
In front of the hall, two rows of warriors clad in golden armor stood straight, looking steadily forward, and exuding some kind of solemnity.
<br><br>
Standing before the hall, Zen felt the solemn aura and put a grave expression on his face.
<br><br>
The last time he met Eastern Emperor Taiyi was in his resting place—that couldn't be regarded as an official meeting.
<br><br>
But to think that he was summoned to such a great hall—what were they planning? Elvinia had also kept everything to herself.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a loud voice resounded from within. "Princess of Spirit Peace, Zen Luo, enter the hall!"
<br><br>
"Princess of Spirit Peace?" Zen blinked in confusion.
<br><br>
"It's my title," Elvinia merely said. "Let's go inside!"
<br><br>
With a nod, Zen entered the hall alongside Elvinia.
<br><br>
Over twenty people were standing on either side.
<br><br>
The golden armored warriors outside were merely Oneness Guards, but the people inside were different—almost every one of them emitted an outstandingly strong aura. Zen even spotted Athemar and Goran standing among them.
<br><br>
"These people..."
<br><br>
Zen observed his periphery and was rather shocked at what he found.
<br><br>
The people were arranged from front to back according to their strength levels.
<br><br>
As Oneness Governors, both Athemar and Goran could only be ranked at about the tenth place. The two in the back emitted a deep, unpredictable aura, not much weaker than that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
These were probably the pillars of the Oneness Mountain or even the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Quietly, Zen observed them from the corner of his eyes—they were staring at Zen with a burning gaze.
<br><br>
All of them had heard of Zen, but apart from Athemar and some others, it was the first time they had met him in person. Legends of Zen on the Other Shore piqued their curiosity.
<br><br>
After walking along the hall, Zen bowed before Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The latter smiled and asked, "Zen, you've been in the Land of Sword Grief for almost two months. You must have made rapid progress. I heard that you are ranked first on the first floor now?"
<br><br>
Hearing the emperor's words had all the strong warriors on both sides of the hall widen their eyes in shock.
<br><br>
Only two months after entering the Land of Sword Grief, Zen was already ranked first on the first floor.
<br><br>
Such rapid improvement was unheard of.
<br><br>
Zen was clearly no ordinary talent.
<br><br>
"Father, Zen has ranked first on the first day he entered the Land of Sword Grief. Today, he has already defeated Rocco and now ranks first on the second floor," Elvinia said indifferently, as though the news wasn't insanely shocking.
<br><br>
The news of Zen defeating Rocco hadn't yet spread within the Oneness Sky Palace. Surely, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and his high-ranking officials hadn't heard of it.
<br><br>
"You defeated Rocco?" An old man next to Athemar looked at Zen in disbelief.
<br><br>
The latter merely nodded.
<br><br>
Smiling, Athemar said, "I heard your nephew was trying to break through to the third floor… but Zen defeated him. How unexpected."
<br><br>
The old man smiled bitterly and shook his head. "My nephew is arrogant, but he was defeated by someone who entered the Chaotic Source Realm just a little over three months ago. I'm afraid it will be difficult for him to accept the fact."
<br><br>
The fact that Zen ranked first on the first floor within two months was already highly shocking to these high-ranking officials.
<br><br>
But to think that Zen had become first on the second floor as well...his progress was amazing.
<br><br>
It was simply unheard of in the Land of Sword Grief. Even if Zen had obtained another powerful Other Shore Token, he still had to follow the rules of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
In the Land of Sword Grief, people were forbidden to use the abilities of Other Shore Tokens. Instead, they could only use the Other Shore Power to fight against each other. Because the Land of Sword Grief merely tested their Other Shore Power and Chaotic Source Spirits, no special tricks were allowed on the battleground.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was stunned upon hearing Elvinia's words. "Zen, are you really ranked first on the second floor?" he asked Zen.
<br><br>
"It's absolutely true. If you don't believe it, you can go check the Ranking Stone yourself," Elvinia continued.
<br><br>
She wasn't surprised that he was still in disbelief, not having seen the rankings with his own eyes.
<br><br>
But Elvinia's look was so serious that no one present believed she could be lying.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi nodded and said, "I do believe it. But it's just too incredible."
<br><br>
Gracefully, he shifted the subject. "Zen, you've been in the Land of Sword Grief for some time. Have you deciphered more of the Truth Enlightenment?"
<br><br>
At the mention of the Truth Enlightenment, all the high-ranking officials had their ears perk up.
<br><br>
The Truth Enlightenment that Zen had handed over was first passed down among the hands of these people. While there were only two hundred words, they had benefited a great deal, drastically increasing their strength.
<br><br>
If they could cultivate the complete Truth Enlightenment, they'd definitely undergo qualitative changes.
<br><br>
'As expected...' Zen murmured inwardly.
<br><br>
That confirmed that Eastern Emperor Taiyi was indeed targeting the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Since he had planned to expose the Truth Enlightenment to the public, it wasn't really difficult for him to tell them about it.
<br><br>
But Zen still felt that something was wrong—if Eastern Emperor Taiyi only wanted the Truth Enlightenment, there was no need for him to summon so many of them.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen said, ignoring his lingering confusion. "I've deciphered the Truth Enlightenment to five hundred words. Shall I hand it to you later or write it down here?"
<br><br>
The high-ranking officials there could obtain the Truth Enlightenment no matter how Zen offered it. The difference lay in whether it was handed over to them by Zen or by Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi invitingly gestured at Zen and said, "These old officials are all old friends of mine. There's no need to hide anything from them, Zen. You can write it down here and they can observe as they like."
<br><br>
"Okay."
<br><br>
Nodding in agreement, Zen gently pressed the space ring on his finger. A single sheet of paper appeared in the air, along with a brush, which he promptly grabbed.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! "For warriors and soldiers, they build their bodies with clarity of mind and comprehension of the heart…"
<br><br>
Zen's words vigorously appeared on the sheet of paper.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the high-ranking officials stared hard at the sheet, afraid of missing a single detail.
<br><br>
But after a while of staring, they all felt dizziness come over them. A middle-aged man of lower strength even fainted.
<br><br>
That had Zen pause for a moment. "Masters, comprehending this Truth Enlightenment cannot be accomplished overnight. If you cultivate it forcefully, I'm afraid it will hurt your souls."
<br><br>
Cultivating the Truth Enlightenment was much more difficult than cultivating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Even for both Zen and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, it was difficult to speed up their cultivation. In fact, it was also difficult for them to read it.
<br><br>
The high-ranking officials were all well aware of this, even more so than Zen, but they didn't want to waste a single moment of this opportunity. As they tried to comprehend it rapidly, their Souls of Light naturally took some damage.
<br><br>
Fortunately, all the high-ranking officials were powerful people. After a few seconds, the man who had just fainted woke right back up. He got up from the ground on his own, bowed before Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and retreated to the side.
<br><br>
Chapter 3572 A Gracious Reward It wasn't long before five hundred words were already put on the paper.
<br><br>
Zen gently placed the brush down and stored it in his space ring. He turned to Eastern Emperor Taiyi. "I have written down all that I have deciphered, Your Majesty."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi beamed happily as he gazed at the output.
<br><br>
He still hadn't figured out how Zen could decipher Sanskrit words. He thought it was blind guessing, at first. However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself was proficient in deciphering Sanskrit words, and he knew one couldn't get this far just by guessing.
<br><br>
He had no doubt that with Zen's help, they would soon decipher the full text of the Truth Enlightenment. Eastern Emperor Taiyi was thrilled at the thought.
<br><br>
"If we can decipher the Truth Enlightenment completely, it will be a great boon to the Oneness Sky Palace," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said, a bright smile on his face.
<br><br>
The Oneness Governors and other high-ranking officials nodded their heads in agreement, proud and excited of this development. None more so than Athemar.
<br><br>
He thought of how fortunate they were that Zen had joined the Sword Light Palace. Athemar had never imagined he would make such great contributions to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Given Zen's talent, he would probably prove even more valuable in the future. Athemar looked forward to seeing him accomplish more as time went by.
<br><br>
"It is my honor, Your Majesty," Zen responded, modestly.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi turned his smile on Zen. "But there is another reason why I called you here today."
<br><br>
At these words, Elvinia, who had been standing beside Zen, stared at the ground and began to blush shyly, a rare sight to see.
<br><br>
"How else may I help you, Your Majesty?" Zen asked, confused.
<br><br>
He had noticed that this occasion seemed unusually grand, but the thought had left his mind as he concentrated on his earlier task.
<br><br>
At this moment, a pleasant voice rang out, "Do you remember that I promised I would reward you graciously?"
<br><br>
Flamine walked out from the back of the palace.
<br><br>
She was dressed in fiery red silk, with fire phoenixes hanging at her cuffs and waist. She looked utterly regal and glamorous.
<br><br>
"Reward me graciously?"
<br><br>
Zen had to rack his brains before realizing what Flamine was talking about.
<br><br>
He had forgotten all about it until she mentioned it again just now.
<br><br>
Back then, Zen and Elvinia were trapped in the Dark Region, facing mortal danger. Only after they were stuck in the light column were they able to leave the Other Shore and come back to the Source World. Even so, they were still in danger then.
<br><br>
Flamine had asked Zen then to protect her daughter, promising to reward him for her safe return.
<br><br>
In fact, Zen hadn't paid much attention to those words. By the time they left the Dark Region, Elvinia had already become a purified being, while Zen had obtained the Civilization Artifact, which was all the reward he wanted.
<br><br>
There was also the matter of Elvinia coming back with her Memory Flame in disarray, her intelligence temporarily degenerating to that of a child's.
<br><br>
Flamine had been very upset about that and forgot the reward thing.
<br><br>
That she would now bring up it, however, came as a surprise.
<br><br>
"I do remember you saying something of the sort, Lady Flamine, but what reward will you give me?" Zen asked, carefully.
<br><br>
Flamine chuckled and looked at Elvinia. "The gracious reward is right by your side," she pronounced.
<br><br>
Zen turned his startled eyes on Elvinia. Seeing her blush and fidget made him realize what was happening. "Lady Flamine, do you mean...?"
<br><br>
"I want Elvinia to marry you," Flamine declared flatly.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Zen's heart dropped.
<br><br>
This was starting to look like a complicated mess.
<br><br>
"Would you take my daughter's hand in marriage?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked seriously.
<br><br>
The high-ranking officials flanking both sides of the hall turned to look at Zen expectantly.
<br><br>
They thought it would be a perfect match.
<br><br>
Although Zen was cultivating in the Oneness Sky Palace, he still joined them as an outsider, since he had the bloodline of the Nine Li race If he married Elvinia, he would truly be part of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Zen straightened up, cupping one hand over the other in front of him respectfully. "Your Majesty, Lady Flamine, I already have a principal wife."
<br><br>
Elvinia was the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. She couldn't compromise her status by being a concubine of Zen, could she? But Zen had been together with Letitia for so long. Surely, he would never forgive himself if he suddenly gave her up for another.
<br><br>
"Of course I know that," Flamine responded gracefully. "But once Elvinia marries you, she will have that status. She is, after all, my beloved daughter with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and can settle for nothing less. Even your principal wife understands this, and has given her consent."
<br><br>
Zen's eyebrows shot up at these words. "Tia has agreed to this, Lady Flamine? She said this personally?"
<br><br>
Zen had been so busy on the Other Shore of late that he had had no time to visit Letitia and the others at the Flow Sword Sect. He remembered, however, Elvinia telling him that Letitia would be taken to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Zen thought it was unusual, at the time, but he didn't worry too much about it. He knew Letitia would be safe in the Phoenix Palace, at least.
<br><br>
It dawned on Zen now why Letitia and Margaret had been brought here.
<br><br>
"Of course. It came directly from her," Flamine said, nodding emphatically.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Elvinia before speaking again. "May I see Tia, then?"
<br><br>
Zen indeed had plans to visit Letitia and the others now that he had also been summoned here to the Phoenix Palace. But the developments of this visit so far had been completely unexpected.
<br><br>
Flamine blinked slightly before regaining her composure. "They are cultivating in seclusion in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. They have activated the Soul Fire Swirl. I'm afraid it's not appropriate to interrupt them at this moment."
<br><br>
The Soul Fire Swirl was a kind of cultivation method in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. Flamine wouldn't lie to Zen, would she? On the other hand, Zen thought, she could very easily manipulate others into thinking what she wanted.
<br><br>
Elvinia almost looked pitiful by Zen's side, her wide eyes gazing at him hopefully.
<br><br>
She desperately wished he wouldn't let her down now. Today, her father had summoned all the high-ranking officials to the palace, supposedly for the deciphering of the Truth Enlightenment. However, his real purpose was to seal the marriage, in front of witnesses.
<br><br>
"You are overthinking this, Zen. This is a wonderful thing," Athemar told him, gently.
<br><br>
"That's right! You seem to love each other. What else is there to consider?"
<br><br>
another high-ranking official chimed in.
<br><br>
Zen barely glanced at them before responding to Flamine, "My apologies. I just cannot decide without consulting Letitia myself. Please excuse my leave."
<br><br>
He turned around and walked out.
<br><br>
The high-ranking officials in the Phoenix Palace grew abuzz, turning to each other in astonishment and confusion.
<br><br>
The old man beside Eastern Emperor Taiyi, in particular, was seething. He had gone to countless life-and-death battles with Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The two of them were like brothers.
<br><br>
It angered him to see Zen daring to humiliate Eastern Emperor Taiyi like this.
<br><br>
"Stop, you brat!" the old man roared furiously.
<br><br>
A terrifying aura rushed from inside the hall, seemingly chasing after Zen.
<br><br>
The guards in golden armor posted outside the hall trembled.
<br><br>
Zen continued to stride out purposefully even as this threat hounded him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3573 I Also Want To Know The Answer Seeing Zen so unaffected, the old man's rage only flared up further.
<br><br>
With a hot temper, he would never let Zen get away easily! ROAR! The old man moved to grab Zen, his clawed hand launching a huge blue wolf head straight at him.
<br><br>
But just as the snarling phantom was about to snap at its target, Eastern Emperor Taiyi raised his hand, making it disappear in thin air.
<br><br>
The old man turned to look at Eastern Emperor Taiyi, surprised at the interruption.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head. "Pearce, calm down. Zen is stubborn. It would do no good to force him to stay."
<br><br>
"Humph! He was offered a rare chance only so few are blessed with over generations! Yet, he showed no gratitude and even walked out arrogantly! How can I just stand for it?" Pearce ranted angrily.
<br><br>
A hint of helplessness dimmed Flamine's beautiful eyes. "It's all my fault. I just arranged everything without considering Zen's feelings," she said guiltily.
<br><br>
Naturally, Flamine deemed her daughter the best girl in the world. It never occurred to her any man would refuse her.
<br><br>
Flamine never expected Zen would react so defensively to keep his principal wife.
<br><br>
Flamine turned to look at Elvinia apologetically. She felt sorry for her daughter the most.
<br><br>
Elvinia had changed so much around Zen, her character growing for the better. It had made Flamine so happy.
<br><br>
Elvinia must feel devastated right about now.
<br><br>
But to Flamine's surprise, Elvinia's expression remained neutral. Elvinia returned her mother's stare. "He's probably headed for the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. I'll go and have a look."
<br><br>
With these words, Elvinia strode out the Supreme Dragon Hall and headed for the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.
<br><br>
In the Fire Bearing Hall of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace, Letitia, Margaret, Lavender, Nelly, and Laquisha sat cross-legged on the floor. A burning red chain hung above their heads, emitting waves of scorching heat.
<br><br>
This was the Soul Fire Swirl, a unique cultivation method in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.
<br><br>
Lavender, Nelly and Laquisha had made great progress with their cultivation.
<br><br>
Letitia and Margaret, meanwhile, had been here for only a month, so they had some ways to go.
<br><br>
However, Letitia cherished this opportunity very much. She knew she would never catch up with Zen, but she didn't want to lag too far behind in terms of cultivation. She took all her training thus far very seriously.
<br><br>
In contrast, Margaret was purposefully proceeding slowly.
<br><br>
As she sat, she moved her hands over her abdomen. Streaks of purple light gathered around her belly, which had started to swell.
<br><br>
Over the years, only Letitia, among all Zen's women, had borne him a child.
<br><br>
This had made Margaret anxious, but she couldn't do anything about it.
<br><br>
Last time Zen had returned from the Chaotic Source World, he had stayed in the independent courtyard house for days. About two months after Zen left for the Land of Sword Grief, Margaret had discovered the good news within her.
<br><br>
Because it hadn't been that long, the change in her body wasn't noticeable yet. Margaret decided to keep it a secret for now.
<br><br>
Just as Margaret touched her belly, Zen stepped into the Fire Bearing Hall.
<br><br>
When he saw that Letitia and his other partners were safe and sound, he was slightly relieved. Although he didn't think Flamine would do anything to harm them, he had still gotten worried when she mentioned Letitia.
<br><br>
When Zen's eyes fell on Margaret, she was lost in thought and hadn't noticed his arrival. But he immediately sensed the change in her. He walked quickly up to her, his face shining with joy. "Margaret, are you...?"
<br><br>
Margaret hadn't been expecting Zen. But now seeing Zen apparently wise to her pregnancy, a shy smile blossomed on her lips. "After I came to the Phoenix Palace, I couldn't leave as I wished, so I didn't know how to tell you. I'm sorry," she whispered.
<br><br>
Upon discovering she was pregnant, Margaret had wanted to inform Zen immediately.
<br><br>
However, as she was new to the Phoenix Palace and had no servants to order to relay the message, she could only wait for Zen's return and protect the growing baby in her womb.
<br><br>
Zen's sudden presence here was a pleasant surprise.
<br><br>
Although Margaret lowered her voice, Letitia still overheard everything.
<br><br>
"You should have told me you are pregnant! You shouldn't have subjected yourself to the Soul Fire Swirl in your condition," Letitia said reproachfully.
<br><br>
Margaret scoffed at that. "Why would I tell you first?"
<br><br>
Although she and Letitia had been on good terms for a long time now, she wanted to share the news with Zen first. It would have been awkward to tell Letitia, of all people.
<br><br>
"But Margaret, it is dangerous to cultivate here while you're pregnant.
<br><br>
Think of the child. You cannot be rash like this. You should have informed them of your condition," Zen admonished.
<br><br>
Margaret nodded at that, humbled. "You're right. I'm sorry." For the first time, Margaret wasn't angered at being admonished. She had rarely gotten angry since she got pregnant.
<br><br>
Zen gently touched Margaret's head and lifted the red chain, removing the Soul Fire Swirl for her.
<br><br>
Then he turned to Letitia. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi summoned me today."
<br><br>
Letitia dropped her eyes. She knew what Zen would say next.
<br><br>
"How could you just decide things on your own like that?" Zen pressed, staring at Letitia.
<br><br>
Letitia lowered her head. "Lady Flamine talked to me. If you marry Elvinia, the Oneness Sky Palace would always be there to help you. It would be good for you. I'll be fine. It makes little difference to me."
<br><br>
Flamine had actually met with Letitia three times. She had been upfront about her purpose and had patiently explained the situation in detail.
<br><br>
Letitia was smart enough to recognize Flamine's painstaking efforts.
<br><br>
She also admired Flamine's honesty.
<br><br>
If Zen became the husband of the Oneness Sky Palace's princess, it would be of great benefit to him. That was why Letitia gave her consent to Flamine.
<br><br>
"I just knew it." Zen sighed. Even before talking to Letitia, he had already guessed she would say something like this.
<br><br>
"So, did you agree to the marriage?" Letitia asked, staring at Zen.
<br><br>
The practical side of her thought was Zen should seize the opportunity. But a part of her was grieving at the thought.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "No."
<br><br>
"Why?"
<br><br>
Hearing Zen's answer, Letitia felt relieved and dismayed at the same time.
<br><br>
Honestly, she couldn't understand herself, at times.
<br><br>
"There are just some things that can't and shouldn't be changed," Zen said firmly.
<br><br>
A faint smile appeared on Letitia's face. At this moment, she exuded a kind of quiet charm. A split second later, however, she gave Zen a sly look. "Do you like Elvinia?"
<br><br>
Letitia didn't know Elvinia that much, unlike Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly who constantly interacted with Elvinia and even regarded her as their master.
<br><br>
"I also want to know the answer."
<br><br>
A faint voice came from the entrance of the Fire Bearing Hall. It was Elvinia.
<br><br>
Chapter 3574 A Conspiracy Letitia fixed Zen with a look.
<br><br>
Margaret looked up at the newly arrived Elvinia as she placed a hand instinctively on her belly.
<br><br>
The old Margaret would have already shown some hostility to Elvinia, jealous of any woman who got close to Zen.
<br><br>
But now she was pregnant, she kept a level head. It hadn't been easy to bear this child. She didn't want her emotions to fluctuate too much and endanger the pregnancy.
<br><br>
Elvinia's face was surprisingly calm, but there was stubbornness in her delicate eyes.
<br><br>
Zen's reaction at the Supreme Dragon Hall to their proposed marriage had subjected Elvinia to embarrassment, but she didn't care. The only thing she wanted to know now was how Zen really felt about her.
<br><br>
Elvinia's lips trembled as she struggled to keep her chin up. She admitted she had a rough relationship with Zen in the beginning, but since their journey to the Dark Region, she had been infatuated with the sense of security she had when she was with him.
<br><br>
She also knew that Zen trusted Dorothy more than her, so she had to be aggressive in making her feelings known.
<br><br>
Zen turned to Elvinia. "Even if I like you, it doesn't mean that you can do this to Tia, manipulating her into doing what you want."
<br><br>
This caused a small smile to play on Letitia's lips. Despite it all, she had still hoped she was the most special one in Zen's heart.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Margaret pursed her lips. That was just like Zen to say that.
<br><br>
This was why she had spent almost a lifetime at odds with Letitia.
<br><br>
Elvinia, meanwhile, was just happy she finally got her answer. The nervous look in her eyes was replaced almost immediately by relief. "Alright then. It will not happen again."
<br><br>
Smiling to herself, she swept out of the Fire Bearing Hall.
<br><br>
As Zen puzzled over Elvinia's reaction, Letitia, who was next to him, beamed up at him. "That was amazing diplomacy, darling! You made Princess Elvinia compromise."
<br><br>
"Compromise?" Zen blinked in confusion.
<br><br>
"She got the answer she wanted. The least she could do is compromise,"
<br><br>
Margaret muttered.
<br><br>
Zen walked over to Margaret and gently crouched beside her. "Now, don't be like that. Be mindful of your condition. Anyway, the Fire Bearing Hall is not suitable for you. We need to get you out of here as soon as possible."
<br><br>
Zen turned to look at Letitia. "I know you want me to use the Oneness Sky Palace to revive the Nine Li race, but the situation in the Source World has become extremely complicated."
<br><br>
After his visit to the Pear Hill, Zen had come to realize it was meaningless to simply gather the remaining members of the Nine Li race and just start over with so few of them. He needed to complete a more important mission for the Nine Li race's revival.
<br><br>
After he returned to the Oneness Sky Palace from the Pear Hill, he went to the Land of Sword Grief, so he was not able to explain the situation in detail to Letitia then.
<br><br>
Zen was now keeping her up to speed, but only broadly, as he lectured her intermittently on her recent reckless decisions. Although she was being scolded, Letitia had a faint smile on her face all throughout. Zen's concern for her made her happy deep inside.
<br><br>
Through all this, Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly had been preoccupied cultivating under the Soul Fire Swirl. Zen thought it best not to interrupt their meditation.
<br><br>
Even before arriving here at the Phoenix Palace, Zen had already planned to bring Letitia and Margaret back to the Flow Sword Sect. All the more he wasn't hurrying to return to the Land of Sword Grief now. He gave Carrie some divine crystals and asked her to go to the Dragon City to buy some prenatal healthcare treatments for Margaret.
<br><br>
When Letitia was pregnant with Geoffrey, Zen hadn't been there for her because he had been preoccupied with things in the Upper World. This time, Zen vowed he would fulfill his responsibility as a father.
<br><br>
In the Vastness Mountain, some important people had gathered behind closed doors of the Mighty Sword Hall.
<br><br>
Natasha, Holden, and the two leaders of the intelligence agency of the Vastness Mountain were waiting on their leader.
<br><br>
Wearing a pair of delicate shoes and her red garments, Natasha paced back and forth, a slight frown marring her features.
<br><br>
On the throne at the top of the Mighty Sword Hall, Gethin sat cross-legged, his eyes closed. He was roaming on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
He opened his eyes shortly. They flashed like lightning on his unreadable face. It was obvious he had returned.
<br><br>
"Emperor Gethin!"
<br><br>
The two leaders of the intelligence agency walked forward and bowed to him.
<br><br>
Gethin stroked his beard and frowned. "They will be making a preemptive strike."
<br><br>
Hearing this, Holden and Natasha exchanged a look.
<br><br>
"A preemptive strike? Under present conditions? Wouldn't that just put us at risk?" Natasha asked pointedly.
<br><br>
Although the Vastness Mountain was one of the top three forces in the Oneness Sky Palace, it was far from being as strong as the Oneness Mountain or the Origin Mountain. Moreover, with Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin guarding the two mountains, respectively, making a move against them would mean certain death.
<br><br>
Holden nodded in agreement. "A preemptive strike would only put us at a disadvantage."
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm is ready," Gethin pointed out.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race was adjacent to the territory of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
They would be the first to attack in a war.
<br><br>
"There is only the Sun Crow race that will take them on?" Natasha only became more hesitant about the idea.
<br><br>
The Vastness Mountain was turning against the Oneness Sky Palace because of Gethin's personal ambition, and on the other hand, he had also lost his faith in them.
<br><br>
But the Oneness Sky Palace was more established, having accumulated resources and allies for countless years. The Sun Crow race would find it hard to destroy them alone. And if the Vastness Mountain acted rashly and was found to be actually behind this conspiracy, they would be put in a precarious situation.
<br><br>
Gethin stared at the door of the Mighty Sword Hall with a faraway look in his eyes. "Their plan is to trap Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin on the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
The two strongest forces of the Oneness Sky Palace were Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi. If they were trapped on the Other Shore, the strength of the Oneness Sky Palace would indeed be greatly diminished.
<br><br>
Natasha nodded slowly as she started to understand the strategy. Her eyes flashed hungrily.
<br><br>
"They have supposedly already begun work on Yasamin, though I don't know if they have succeeded or not," Gethin continued. "But someone's name kept coming up."
<br><br>
"Who?" Natasha asked.
<br><br>
"Zen," Gethin replied.
<br><br>
It was true that Zen was a talented warrior, but he held no threat to the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"Do you want us to kill him?" A trace of excitement lit up Natasha's face.
<br><br>
Things didn't end well the last time they kidnapped Zen and took him to the Vastness Mountain. All the trouble hadn't been worth it. What was worse, the Vastness Mountain actually didn't dare do anything to him.
<br><br>
"We need to capture him alive. Zen seems quite important to them." Even Gethin seemed torn about this. Everyone knew Zen was an outstanding talent, but what was the point of keeping him alive? "That's good enough," Natasha sneered, a glint of malice in her eyes.
<br><br>
On the Origin Mountain, a forest of emerald-green trees surrounded a small lake.
<br><br>
Countless arrays had been engraved around these trees.
<br><br>
All together, they formed the Spirit-shaking Array, which protected the small lake and its immediate surroundings.
<br><br>
It was also fully activated whenever Yasamin entered the Other Shore. It was risky, after all, for a powerful being like her to just leave her physical body behind, which was vulnerable to any attack.
<br><br>
Anyone who crossed the Spirit-shaking Array when it was activated would immediately be killed, except for a select few of the Origin Mountain who were allowed to enter it.
<br><br>
Presently, Dorothy stood outside the forest. She paused for a moment before smoothly entering the threshold.
<br><br>
The Spirit-shaking Array released a rune to cover the surface of Dorothy's body. The surrounding trees flashed with a red light.
<br><br>
The light died down as the rune apparently verified Dorothy's identity and allowed her through.
<br><br>
Chapter 3575 Something Unforeseen In The Origin Mountain Dorothy passed through the forest and walked halfway around the lake before she arrived at the pavilion.
<br><br>
She pushed the door of the pavilion open, only to find a wholly different space greeting her from within.
<br><br>
Countless rays of sword light floated in the air, circling around like a big whirlpool. This was the famous Origin Sword Light.
<br><br>
Among all the disciples in the Origin Mountain, few had the chance to be taught by Yasamin herself. And among these few, Dorothy was the only one who had the right to cultivate the Origin Swordsmanship in this space.
<br><br>
Dorothy went up to the whirlpool formed by the sword light.
<br><br>
Yasamin was floating in the center of this whirlpool. She seemed to be adventuring on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The moment Dorothy approached, a ray of sword light flew towards her.
<br><br>
She stretched out a hand and gently played with the sword light. A long, melodious sound was immediately transmitted into the big whirlpool.
<br><br>
Yasamin was able to sense this on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If someone else were to play the sword light in an attempt to wake Yasamin, she would have become furious. She would then just ignore the sound and stay on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But every time Dorothy played the sword light, Yasamin retreated from the Other Shore as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Dorothy played the sword light for a while before she sat down, arms around her knees and waiting for her grandmother to wake up. She was also mentally preparing herself to talk to her grandmother, trying to decide what to say to her.
<br><br>
Her grandmother had figured out her affection towards Zen a long time ago and wanted to help her fulfill her wish. That was why Yasamin had had the conflict with Flamine in the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
But though Dorothy was passionate, she was extremely reserved when it came to relationships between man and woman. And though Yasamin was anxious for her granddaughter, she could do nothing about it.
<br><br>
At the time, Dorothy had liked traveling with Zen on the Other Shore. She hadn't thought that Elvinia would appear suddenly.
<br><br>
Chaim had reminded her of her love in the Land of Sword Grief. Only then had Dorothy realized that she should strive for her love, just like Elvinia had.
<br><br>
But the question of how to speak euphemistically to her grandmother still remained.
<br><br>
She fought an internal battle for quite a while. When she came to her senses, she found that five minutes had passed, but her grandmother was still floating at the center of the sword light whirlpool.
<br><br>
Dorothy was confused. Even though Yasamin was on the Other Shore, she should have known that Dorothy was coming. But five minutes had passed and she still hadn't retreated from the Other Shore. Could she have been trapped somewhere unusual? There were some places like the Dark Region and the temples that warriors were not allowed to exit at will.
<br><br>
Dorothy was discomfited as she remembered the provocative look in Elvinia's eyes. So she merely waited.
<br><br>
She waited for about one more hour before she realized that there seemed to be something wrong with her grandmother. Yasamin's body seemed somewhat illusory in the midst of the sword light, but Dorothy could still see her clearly.
<br><br>
Yasamin's wrinkled face was usually ruddy, but it was now pale as paper.
<br><br>
"Grandma!"
<br><br>
Dorothy's cultivation level was not very high, but she knew that something was wrong.
<br><br>
She played the sword light once again. The sword light buzzed sharply and was transmitted to within the whirlpool. Her grandmother would wake up the moment she heard this sound, she knew it.
<br><br>
But Yasamin remained motionless. Her face paled with every passing second and every ray of Origin Sword Light in the entire space began to vibrate.
<br><br>
This sword light could be seen as Yasamin's avatar. It would usually be taken back to her body. But when she cultivated here, she'd release all the Origin Sword Light from her body.
<br><br>
Dorothy was familiar with the sword light. It trembled and howled, as if sensing that Yasamin was in danger. It sobbed and complained to Dorothy.
<br><br>
"Grandma! Grandma!"
<br><br>
The scene unfolding before Dorothy reminded her that Yasamin was in trouble.
<br><br>
She took a couple of steps forward before she realized that she couldn't get close to her grandmother. She remembered that every time Yasamin had woken up, she emerged from the whirlpool by herself.
<br><br>
Dorothy thought for a moment before she turned around and rushed out of the pavilion. Emerging from the forest, she pulled out the message runes and crushed them one by one.
<br><br>
Before long, beams of light flew up from the halls in the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
They headed straight for the top of the mountain, gathering outside the forest.
<br><br>
Each of these had a strong aura. Not for nothing were they the backbone of the Origin Mountain. Winchell, one of the few people qualified to enter the forest, led the group.
<br><br>
At Dorothy's words, he went straight into the forest without hesitation.
<br><br>
Two other people accompanied him into the forest.
<br><br>
Dorothy meant to follow them but the moment she took a step forward, she felt her foot become heavy.
<br><br>
It looked like even a powerful existence like her grandmother, who was at the top level of the Other Shore Realm, couldn't avoid danger.
<br><br>
She was afraid that once she entered the forest, she would see her grandmother's soulless body before her.
<br><br>
She trembled with fear at the thought, but someone caught her from behind.
<br><br>
"Aunt Felicity!" Dorothy cried out.
<br><br>
"Don't be afraid. Everything will be fine," Felicity said, comforting her while looking at the forest. "Madam Yasamin will safely leave the Other Shore."
<br><br>
It would actually be very difficult for a warrior at such a high level as Yasamin to die on the Other Shore, because the souls of strongest warriors like them had already risen to another level.
<br><br>
'So, did something unexpected happen on the Other Shore?' Felicity had many possibilities mapped out in her mind, but she did not say anything. She merely tried to comfort Dorothy in a soft voice.
<br><br>
After a long time, Winchell walked out of the forest.
<br><br>
Dorothy felt her heart plummet at the seriousness on his face. She then heard him say, "I think Madam Yasamin is trapped in a dangerous situation, but she is still fighting hard. I don't know how long she can hold on. I'm going to the Phoenix Palace."
<br><br>
The seven mountains under the Oneness Sky Palace were closely connected to each other, like siblings. And especially the Oneness Mountain and the Origin Mountain. Now that something terrible was happening to Yasamin, they had to inform Eastern Emperor Taiyi as soon as possible.
<br><br>
With gloom dangling over them, Felicity, Dorothy, and the other powerful warriors of the Origin Mountain watched Winchell leave.
<br><br>
In the Flow Sword Sect...
<br><br>
Margaret had been very satisfied over the past few days. Zen had been with her all the time, and even Letitia had taken good care of her. The atmosphere in the independent courtyard house had never been so harmonious.
<br><br>
Letitia had once suggested that Margaret enter Zen's inner world. If the time flow rate rose, she would be able to give birth to the baby sooner. But Margaret refused because she didn't want her pregnancy to pass quickly.
<br><br>
"A Fetus Nourishing Pill, worth two million divine crystals, can nourish the innate spirit!"
<br><br>
"An Earth Longevity Pill, worth five hundred thousand divine crystals, can help you live for a million years even if you don't cultivate or become a True God!"
<br><br>
"A Talent Upgrading Pill, worth five million divine crystals, can help you improve your cultivation talent greatly!"
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Trish displayed before Zen the pills that she had bought.
<br><br>
Zen could not help but feel amazed after learning of the effects of these pills. It looked like the starting point in the Source World was much higher than in the divine land. And these pills had little to no side effects when used to nourish the fetus.
<br><br>
Chapter 3576 Three Thousand And One Godly Ways With the current resources Zen possessed, the cost of tens of millions of divine crystals wouldn't be an issue. He was capable of producing the Sword-reading Liquid, which was highly valuable. As such, he had made a batch before he returned to the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
As for the earnings, Zen had requested Monica to distribute the divine crystals to the Sword Light Palace disciples instead of keeping them for himself.
<br><br>
After all, Zen had Stage Fourteen to back him. The place had a massive amount of wealth. The number of divine crystals he gave to these disciples was nothing to him.
<br><br>
Margaret didn't have the easiest time refining the nourishing pills that her baby needed. However, with Trish's guidance, she showed exceptional tenacity and was able to focus a full week on refining all the pills using complicated methods.
<br><br>
During the past few days, apart from taking care of Margaret and accompanying Letitia and Aura, Zen also visited the neighboring courtyard house.
<br><br>
Hutton, Sally, and the other Nine Li members waited for Ambrose to pick them up after they returned to the Oneness Sky Palace. However, Ambrose never arrived. They never mentioned anything about leaving, either.
<br><br>
The tiny kingdom belonging to the remaining members of the Nine Li race couldn't hold a candle to the majesty of the Oneness Sky Palace. Luckily, Despite that they were unable to enter the Land of Sword Grief, Zen was able to provide them with the required resources in the Myriad Spirits City.
<br><br>
Thanks to his help, they made rapid progress.
<br><br>
If Sally could get into the Land of Sword Grief, she could attain a rank within the top nine hundred on the first floor.
<br><br>
Soon after he returned to his own courtyard house after the visit, a strange sensation passed throughout Zen's body. With a slight frown, he sat crosslegged on the floor. With a slight thought in his mind, an avatar had appeared within his inner world.
<br><br>
Even with the removal of the Evil God's Rebirth Land, everything within it remained.
<br><br>
Ever since the Evil God was brought back to Zen's inner world, he had been imprisoned together with his wife, Edna.
<br><br>
She proved her loyalty well, choosing to stay at his side despite her imprisonment.
<br><br>
This time, when the Evil God returned, Edna noticed he seemed depressed.
<br><br>
He talked less than usual, barely uttering a single word to her. She also noticed how he was lost in thought as if thinking of something profound.
<br><br>
All of this worried her.
<br><br>
She knew that her husband would never compromise or give up. He was as stubborn as a bull, never wanting to give up a chance to turn the tables— unless he was destroyed.
<br><br>
The Creator of the world the Evil God and Edna were imprisoned in was an omnipotent being—all that existed in his inner world was essentially a part of him. If the Evil God even just thought about rebelling, the Creator would know immediately.
<br><br>
Edna herself never dared to give any thought to the idea, afraid that if the Creator found out, he would be more wary of her husband.
<br><br>
If there was anything she was thankful for, it was that the Creator gave her husband the Blood Essence Godly Way. Ever since then, he'd been fully immersed in fusing the Godly Ways. It relieved her knowing that he had found something he was interested in.
<br><br>
The Evil God had offered the Creator his Rebirth Land, and even a "Civilization Artifact"—which Edna, although not knowing much about it, knew that it possessed terrifying and threatening energy. In fact, the power it contained would be countless times more terrifying than that of the Waysblending Energy her husband had.
<br><br>
If her husband could manage to find a way to seamlessly merge the Blood Essence Godly Way into the Ways-blending Energy, then he'd receive atonement for his sins and get the opportunity to roam freely in this world.
<br><br>
Perhaps then, she and he could return to their old happy days.
<br><br>
Lost deep in thought, Edna was startled back to reality by the sudden flash of lightning.
<br><br>
The Evil God held a ball of great power in his right hand. It was the Waysblending Energy, a power comprised of two thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight Godly Ways. His left hand wielded the Thunderstorm Godly Way which startled her earlier.
<br><br>
He gently opened his left hand, and with a cracking sound, the Thunderstorm Godly Way had shot into the Ways-blending Energy. The Evil God was happy to see it still remain stable.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
With the wave of his left hand, a streak of small, blood-red energy spiraled around his fingers and turned into a blood-red dragon.
<br><br>
There was no denying that the Evil God had an extraordinary understanding of the various Godly Ways. After Zen got the Blood Essence Godly Way, he didn't pursue practicing it. As for the Evil God, he now actually could use it with such ease and at a super level.
<br><br>
The blood-red dragon twined through his fingertips until it made its way to the ball of Ways-blending Energy. By then, the ball already had three thousand kinds of internal momentum within it! The Evil God had previously tried to combine the arc light energy with the other Godly Ways in order to reach three thousand Godly Ways in the Ways-blending Energy. However, it clashed with the Thunderstorm Godly Way. So he began his long journey of trying various ways to combine but there was always a Godly Way that was rejected.
<br><br>
Now, the Evil God was successful. He managed to replace the arc light energy with the Blood Essence Godly Way.
<br><br>
"I did it!"
<br><br>
The Evil God finally managed to smile after all this time as he gazed at his success in his hands—the ball of energy really had three thousand Godly Ways in it. It had been a while since he felt this happy.
<br><br>
If it was before, the Evil God would have thought that he had finally achieved the Godly Ways Great Unity.
<br><br>
But he already knew that there were more than three thousand types of internal momentum—around three thousand and two according to Zen. So, even if it reached three thousand, that still wouldn't be enough for him to achieve the Godly Ways Great Unity.
<br><br>
After successfully merging the Blood Essence Godly Way with others, his fingertips now flashed with the arc light energy which he shot towards the Ways-blending Energy he still held in his other hand.
<br><br>
Once the arc light energy disappeared, the Ways-blending Energy began to alter once more. Unfortunately, it became unstable, and more than thirty Godly Ways escaped the powerful orb.
<br><br>
"How can this be? I…I did everything right…"
<br><br>
The Evil God was slightly shocked. He only hesitated for a moment. Seeing that the Ways-blending Energy was about to explode, he flicked his left hand and merged the more than thirty Godly Ways separately into a ball and then merge them with the Ways-blending Energy again.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The Ways-blending Energy became stable once more. The fusion of the internal momentum of three thousand and one Godly Ways was successful.
<br><br>
"It appears that fusing the more than 30 kinds of internal momentum that have escaped is what's required to stabilize the Ways-blending Energy and succeed." The Evil God muttered as a wave of relief washed over him.
<br><br>
Such a creation of power wouldn't have been possible without the extraordinary talent showcased by the Evil God. Any other person who dared to re-enact what he just accomplished would have to explore for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years.
<br><br>
Once three thousand and one Godly Ways were fused together, the Waysblending Energy morphed once more into a bright, purple-tinged light.
<br><br>
"Darling, the power seems to keep getting stronger!" Edna exclaimed as she drew near to her husband's side.
<br><br>
"Yes!"
<br><br>
The Evil God nodded, a smile of satisfaction plastered on his face. With each gentle wave of his hands, the Ways-blending Energy continued to shift into the shape of diamond. Then it began to overlap itself.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the Evil God had made the diamond-shaped energy superimpose into nearly one hundred layers! "Go!"
<br><br>
The Evil God flicked his fingers, and the diamond-shaped energy shot forward.
<br><br>
Bang! Suddenly, the diamond shaped-energy exploded and emitted a blazing white light that shone as bright as the sun with hints of purple-tinged streams scattered throughout.
<br><br>
Edna quickly covered her eyes and hid behind her husband. The Evil God, on the other hand, gazed at it head-on in excitement.
<br><br>
The power of Evil God's Ways-blending Energy had reached beyond ten thousand divine megatons. This surpassed his expectations.
<br><br>
He knew that with his current limits, he could enable the Ways-blending Energy to have up to one hundred and ninety-three layers. If this was the power that one hundred layers could achieve, surely nothing could stop him once he reached his limit.
<br><br>
Using all of his strength would enable the power to double itself! The light emitted by the Ways-blending Energy shot in all directions. Just as it was about to wreak havoc in Zen's inner world, the light suddenly froze before shrinking back once more into its original diamond-shaped state. It was as if someone had forced the hands of the clock backward.
<br><br>
Zen appeared beside the diamond-shaped energy and gently reached out to take the ball of energy in his hand, watching it thoughtfully.
<br><br>
Chapter 3577 Reward Zen was thoroughly alarmed the moment the Evil God had succeeded in completely blending the Godly Ways.
<br><br>
The power within the diamond-shaped energy greatly exceeded the expectations of the Evil God. It was also way beyond Zen could have ever imagined.
<br><br>
As the diamond-shaped energy exploded, it released a huge amount of energy that transcended ten thousand divine megatons of force. Without a doubt, Zen thought he probably wouldn't have been able to withstand this extreme amount of force if it had happened outside his inner world.
<br><br>
Thankfully, this didn't pose much of a problem inside Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
Here, he was an omnipotent being. He was the absolute ruler of this place and his power was unparalleled. Therefore, he could easily restore everything in their original forms.
<br><br>
The Evil God had intended this enormous amount of energy to explode completely. He wanted to observe and ascertain its full might.
<br><br>
However, Zen halted his experiment midway. He was annoyed and frowned at the sudden interruption.
<br><br>
Zen didn't have to raise his head and look at the Evil God for he knew that there was a change in his emotions. He felt the annoyance and bitterness the Evil God felt. "I'm afraid this huge amount of power would obliterate more than half of my inner world if it completely explodes. You have to understand why I stopped it," he explained.
<br><br>
"Oh, is that it? So you also have something to be afraid of, huh?" The Evil God sneered at Zen's remark. He still couldn't keep the annoyance out of his tone.
<br><br>
Zen held the diamond-shaped energy on his palm as he slowly flew over to where the Evil God was. "Well theoretically, there shouldn't be anything that could make me afraid in my own inner world. However, your presence is an exception."
<br><br>
Essentially, the creation of the Evil God took up some of Zen's best talents.
<br><br>
There were always pros and cons to his existence. If the Evil God stayed inside Zen's inner world, then as a primitive land, it would go through many tribulations. These ordeals also served as great trials for Zen.
<br><br>
Zen hovered in front of the golden fence and handed the diamond-shaped energy to the Evil God. "You did a great job." He faced the Evil God and praised him sincerely. He had to admit that he was impressed at this display of power.
<br><br>
"It didn't do me any good, though, did it?" The Evil God seemed dejected as he scowled at Zen.
<br><br>
"Yes, it did. For that, I will give you a handsome reward," replied Zen.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Evil God wasn't surprised by Zen's words. He also didn't seem interested in it.
<br><br>
Zen had once set the Evil God free after he helped him blend the many Godly Ways. However, he believed that Zen wouldn't make the mistake of doing that again after his open betrayal of him. He desired nothing else but his freedom. Therefore, he showed absolutely no interest in Zen's so-called reward.
<br><br>
"Would you kindly repeat the process of blending the Godly Ways to me?"
<br><br>
Zen asked courteously.
<br><br>
From inside the fence, the Evil God merely glanced sideways at Zen as he disintegrated the diamond-shaped energy in his hand. He couldn't be bothered to repeat the whole process in front of Zen.
<br><br>
"My dear, the Creator himself demands this from you. So please, just do it again," coaxed Edna who was standing behind the Evil God. She never thought it was a wise move to go against the will of their creator.
<br><br>
"He doesn't really need me to do it again. He is able to get the knowledge by himself," retorted the Evil God coldly.
<br><br>
The corners of Zen's mouth curled into a smile. He reached out in front of him and clenched his fist. A long sword instantly appeared in his hand. He conjured it out of thin air.
<br><br>
Normally, a sword created in such a casual way was fragile and of poor quality. However, this was Zen's inner world. Therefore, he was able to improve and enhance it to the highest level with just a single thought.
<br><br>
He remained motionless with the sword in his hand for a short time. Several visions playing one after another flashed in front of his eyes.
<br><br>
In Zen's mind, the scene of the Evil God blending the Godly Ways began to unfold. Impressively, it didn't leave out any details at all! Buzz! The Ways-blending Energy began to gather around the long sword in Zen's hand. Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine kinds of internal momentum assembled first. These were followed by the Thunderstorm Godly Way and the Blood Essence Godly Way. The arc light energy came in last! Whoosh! After Zen blended them in order, he encountered the same accident that the Evil God had experienced a while ago. There were more than thirty kinds of internal momentum of the Godly Ways that automatically split from the others.
<br><br>
Zen had already observed this odd occurrence so he was well prepared for it. With a flick of his hand, these more than thirty Godly Ways formed into a mass of energy and merged into the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
There was a flash of purple light that emanated from it. This signaled that Zen was successful in blending all of them together.
<br><br>
As Zen held the sword in his hand, he said, "I don't have any spare time to cultivate the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship. Fortunately, it is much similar to the diamond-shaped energy you have created. Therefore, I can just learn from your experience of creating this energy!"
<br><br>
Zen had to admit that he was a bit envious of the Evil God's sheer talent of blending the Godly Ways.
<br><br>
The Evil God was able to create this method almost instinctively. Even though the diamond-shaped energy he created was not a specific skill, it still had a much greater stability and comprehensibility than the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship written by Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
It was extremely noteworthy that it took Eastern Emperor Taiyi a lot of time and energy to complete the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship. This was regarded far and wide as a supreme swordsmanship manual. Compared to that, it was only a short span of time from when the Evil God had first grasped the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
It was true that there were times when Zen had felt the urge to devour the Evil God and take his talent as his own. However, he would immediately pull himself together as he thought of the Regal Jade Spirit's warning.
<br><br>
Suddenly, there was a clanging sound.
<br><br>
Three gleams of purple sword radiance merged together. Zen summoned them according to the methods of the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship. But during the course of it, Zen made some changes and turned the sword radiance into diamond-shaped energy. He used the method he had just learned from the Evil God while he blended them.
<br><br>
When Zen returned the Evil God to his inner world, he gathered all of the Evil God's Other Shore Tokens and everything else that belonged to him.
<br><br>
These included his memories and experiences as well.
<br><br>
However, Zen did not pry into the Evil God's memories out of respect. He only acquired his knowledge of blending the diamond-shaped energy.
<br><br>
Ten layers...
<br><br>
Fifty layers...
<br><br>
One hundred...
<br><br>
One hundred and ninety...
<br><br>
As the number of the energy layers gathering on the sword increased, the Ways-blending Energy also became increasingly formidable.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the Ways-blending Energy on the long sword became so intimidating that even the Evil God gasped in astonishment. "This energy will be unbelievably powerful when used in swordsmanship," he remarked.
<br><br>
"Eastern Emperor Taiyi is one of the most powerful masters in the Source World. His strength is comparable to that of the Black Ship's captain. It can be expected that the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship he wrote has its merits. If you are interested to read it, I can get it for you," offered Zen.
<br><br>
As mentioned before, the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship was regarded as a supreme swordsmanship manual. Therefore, it was not allowed to be handed down to outsiders. However, Zen could lend it to the Evil God if he wanted.
<br><br>
As he finished saying this, Zen suddenly raised his hand that held the sword.
<br><br>
The sword slashed and pierced the air at the distance. The purple sword radiance contained almost twenty thousand divine megatons of force. As it erupted forth, the space in its path was shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
But before the sword radiance had completely exploded, Zen created a huge black rift in space using his mind. It appeared in front of the sword radiance and swallowed it whole.
<br><br>
He could not allow the sword radiance to explode inside his inner world. It was powerful enough to obliterate the entirety of this world.
<br><br>
"What's the point of learning this swordsmanship if I cannot leave your inner world? It will only be a waste of time and talent." The Evil God hung his head and replied sourly.
<br><br>
Zen fixed his gaze at the Evil God. "Well, I agree. It will be such an awful waste to keep you imprisoned inside my inner world."
<br><br>
As he heard these words, the Evil God instantly raised his head. He stared confusedly at Zen and wondered whether he was telling the truth.
<br><br>
Zen reached out his hand toward the Evil God and offered him a handful of Chaotic Source Spirits. Then, he said, "Here's two hundred Chaotic Source Spirits. These will be enough for you to reach the Chaotic Source Realm."
<br><br>
The Evil God was fully aware of the Chaotic Source Spirit's absolute importance because he had once been sent into the Chaotic Source World by the Black Ship. However, he had given up hope of ever reaching the Chaotic Source Realm after his rebellion against Zen failed. Never in his wildest dreams had he expected that Zen would freely hand him such a gift.
<br><br>
Zen knew that the Evil God would plainly refuse any other kind of reward.
<br><br>
However, if he offered him Chaotic Source Spirits...
<br><br>
The Evil God took them from Zen without any second thoughts.
<br><br>
Chapter 3578 Release In the future, the Chaotic Source World would no longer exist, and thus there would be no way to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits. This was probably the last chance for the Evil God to step into the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
"You need to arrange an array to refine the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits. I'll help you get the array arrangement method later," Zen added.
<br><br>
His tone was steady, as if he was confident despite the worrying situation he was in.
<br><br>
After the Chaotic Source Spirits had been successfully placed into his body, the Evil God needed a magic array to refine them.
<br><br>
This place was too far away from the abandoned Chaotic Source World. It was impossible for Zen to let the Evil God go there to refine the Chaotic Source Spirits. Besides, Zen thought the array used to refine them shouldn't be difficult to arrange. He would find an opportunity to inquire about it to make sure before he acted.
<br><br>
"What do you mean by that?" the Evil God asked. Curiosity gleamed in his eyes as he spoke.
<br><br>
Indeed, he was interested in the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
However, he was more interested in what Zen had just said.
<br><br>
A smile appeared in Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
The Evil God was indeed unwilling to be trapped in his inner world.
<br><br>
"I want to let you out," said Zen calmly.
<br><br>
"Let me out?" The eyes of the Evil God flickered. His brows were crossed and his glare was steady. It was hard to believe what he had heard and he couldn't hide the surprise and excitement he felt after hearing what Zen said.
<br><br>
Ever since he was caught by Zen, the Evil God had been desperate and uneasy as he waited for Zen to devour him.
<br><br>
Yet, unexpectedly, Zen didn't do that. Instead, he just imprisoned him and let him study the Ways-blending Energy. However, with his intelligence, he knew just why Zen did this.
<br><br>
Just as Zen had said before, if he really was the malice of this world, absorbing him would only bring greater trouble to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen had let him go before, but at that time, he had used the Rebirth Land to bind him.
<br><br>
However, Zen had already discovered the defects of the Rebirth Land, and because of this, he wouldn't use it again.
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God was thinking, Zen spoke, "There's only one condition.
<br><br>
You'll have to become my Inner-world Generating Avatar."
<br><br>
Before entering the Chaotic Source World, the Evil God had learned about the Inner-world Generating Avatar. It was a method of refining the creatures in one's inner world into avatars.
<br><br>
Previously, the Evil God also wanted to refine Zen into his own avatar. If he could possess a powerful body like Zen's, then he would be even more powerful.
<br><br>
To his surprise, the final result was the opposite.
<br><br>
Zen continued, "However, the ordinary Inner-world Generating Avatar has no consciousness and serves as the avatar of its owner, but I plan to let you keep your consciousness. In other words, you have freedom in most cases, but you can't disobey my orders."
<br><br>
After returning to the Oneness Sky Palace, Zen spared some time learning about the Inner-world Generating Avatar. It was not a complicated theurgy.
<br><br>
He could directly control the avatar in this way, so it was more practical than the Rebirth Land.
<br><br>
Refining the Evil God into an ordinary avatar wouldn't be of much use to Zen. In fact, when it came to physical strength, the Evil God was far inferior to him. But the Evil God was more talented than him in some aspects. Zen thought that if he could use the Evil God's talents properly, it would be a great help to him.
<br><br>
After explaining, Zen straightened his body and cleared his throat to ask, "Are you willing to do that?"
<br><br>
"Well, it looks like I have no choice," the Evil God said with a smile.
<br><br>
Deep down, the Evil God was willing to do what Zen offered. No matter what, Zen's offer was much better than being trapped in his inner world.
<br><br>
Moreover, he thought that the Inner-world Generating Avatar might not be...
<br><br>
As the Evil God was about to be absorbed in his thought, he stopped and realized something. Since Zen was able to read his mind, he couldn't think of some things.
<br><br>
Zen took a few steps forward and waved his hand at the golden fence. The whole fence broke, and the mountain collapsed with a loud thud.
<br><br>
When the mortals in the kingdoms below saw the mountain collapse, they all panicked in fear. There were shrieks and sounds of the people's feet in stampede.
<br><br>
"Creator, I..." Edna floated in the air and looked at Zen with a pleading expression.
<br><br>
There were many living beings in the inner world, but they weren't aware that there was a big world outside, so naturally, they didn't have too many thoughts in their hearts.
<br><br>
Once they knew about the outside world, they wouldn't be willing to be confined in this world.
<br><br>
As the Evil God's wife, Edna had known for a long time that there existed a big world outside. However, rather than visit that big world, she was more willing to follow the Evil God.
<br><br>
"You can leave with him. I don't have any restrictions for you," Zen said directly.
<br><br>
The expression on Edna's face changed and she immediately cheered, "Thank you, Creator!"
<br><br>
Even the Evil God was quite surprised, and there was a trace of joy in his eyes that he hadn't had for a long time.
<br><br>
Then, with Zen's permission, the Evil God and Edna went to the main continent to say goodbye to their children.
<br><br>
Although the Evil God had left for a long time, he already became a legend in Zen's inner world. Many secrets of this world were controlled by his children. Even without his presence, his children still turned out to be outstanding in this world.
<br><br>
When his children saw that he had returned, they couldn't hide their surprise. When they heard that their father and mother were going to leave together, they were wistful. However, as the children of the Evil God, they understood his pursuit.
<br><br>
After Zen dissipated his incarnation, he regained his consciousness. The moment he opened his eyes, he felt a warm breath on his face. Then he saw Margaret's face was very close to him.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" Zen asked, dumbfounded. He blinked his eyes rapidly and crossed his brows.
<br><br>
Glaring at Zen, Margaret said, "I saw you meditating in the yard. I was afraid that something might happen to you..."
<br><br>
She thought Zen had gone to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Letitia, Lavender and the other women had a certain understanding of the Other Shore, but Margaret was completely unable to understand it. In all honesty, she had no interest in understanding it. She only knew that the Other Shore was very dangerous.
<br><br>
Zen touched Margaret's head and comforted her in a soft voice, "I just went to my inner world."
<br><br>
"Why did you go there?" She leaned in towards him, obviously wanting to hear more details. Curiosity was reflecting in her eyes as she waited for his response.
<br><br>
"Someone is coming out," Zen answered Margaret simply.
<br><br>
At his words, Zen stood up and circled around. He stopped in an empty place and led his hands to the air from his abdomen. Then, Edna in white appeared in the courtyard.
<br><br>
It was the first time for Edna to come to this world. She looked terrified and curious at the same time.
<br><br>
"Creator, do you live in this place?" Edna asked.
<br><br>
In her eyes, Zen was an all-powerful and invincible god. Although this independent courtyard house was truly exquisite, it was very ordinary and too low for Zen. This mundane environment confused her.
<br><br>
"Zen, who is she?"
<br><br>
A moment ago, Margaret was as docile as a sheep, but as Edna appeared, her face darkened, as if she was about to lose her temper.
<br><br>
"She is from my inner world. I promised to release her," Zen explained.
<br><br>
"Just because she is beautiful?" Margaret complained. Her brows were raised and her tone was probing. Margaret narrowed her eyes and gave Edna a look from her head to toe.
<br><br>
Edna, as the Evil God's wife, was exceedingly beautiful. Margaret felt a great sense of crisis in her heart. In fact, Letitia was looking down from the second floor. Not far away, Trish, Carrie and Aura were secretly sizing Edna up.
<br><br>
"You're thinking too much." Zen smiled and shook his head, dismissing the jealousy in Margaret's tone. "Her husband hasn't come out yet. I'll arrange an array for him."
<br><br>
Although Zen wasn't really afraid of the Evil God escaping, he thought he should be well prepared and make sure everything was all right before releasing the Evil God.
<br><br>
Seeing how Margaret acted aggressively in front of Zen, Edna widened her beautiful eyes in surprise. Her behavior took her aback.
<br><br>
Chapter 3579 An Intelligent Puppet A frown couldn't help but form on Edna's face. 'Who is this woman? How dare she talk to the Creator like that?' she thought.
<br><br>
Although she had a lot of questions in her mind, she didn't dare ask any of them in front of the "Creator".
<br><br>
Since the Creator had said that he would set up an array, she immediately stepped away. She had left the Creator's inner world as a free body, but it might not be easy for her husband to do so.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Margaret had also stepped back after she had heard Zen's explanation. However, she remained vigilant.
<br><br>
Zen then busied himself in arranging the array in the independent courtyard house.
<br><br>
The array for creating an Inner-world Generating Avatar wasn't difficult to master. It involved using a special method to refine the inner world creature into a "puppet." Of course, such a puppet was different from ordinary puppets.
<br><br>
Now, the Evil God would have his own free will most of the time, but Zen could take over the Evil God's body for as long as he wanted.
<br><br>
It took an hour for Zen to set up the array. After it was done, he drew out the Evil God from his inner world once again.
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God emerged from Zen's inner world, the array immediately trapped him and simultaneously released a white beam of light. The ray of white light pierced through Zen's head, then went straight towards the Evil God's forehead.
<br><br>
Both of their consciousnesses were connected, and they could both feel each other's existence.
<br><br>
However, their statuses were different from each other: Zen was the primary, and the Evil God was the secondary.
<br><br>
The array continued to flash for nearly an hour. When it slowly became dim, the Inner-world Generating Avatar was finally completed.
<br><br>
"Honey!" Edna exclaimed.
<br><br>
Just as she was about to approach the Evil God, her husband suddenly stretched out his hand and stopped her.
<br><br>
Naturally, she was surprised. Although the man in front of her was indeed her husband, his behavior, expression, and aura were all completely different. At that moment, the Evil God had clearer eyes and wore an aloof expression, which was more similar to the "Creator."
<br><br>
Indeed, Zen was the one who currently occupied the Evil God's body. He had suppressed the Evil God's own will and had absolute control over the avatar.
<br><br>
As the Evil God's eyes closed and opened again, Zen's consciousness left his body. The Evil God's own consciousness returned, from which a faint trace of evil aura had spread out. He stretched out his hand and held Edna, who stood not far away, into his arms.
<br><br>
She knew that this was her husband now.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked around and then asked, "Where am I?"
<br><br>
"The Flow Sword Sect in the Oneness Mountain under the Oneness Sky Palace," Zen answered.
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes wandered around the independent courtyard house.
<br><br>
He had once struggled in life in the Source World, and he knew that it was a much more awful place than Zen's inner world. Therefore, it was clear that he did not think about things in the same way as Edna, who thought that the outside world was wonderful and that Zen was a very powerful man.
<br><br>
"You're indeed well treated in the Oneness Sky Palace," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
On the contrary, his previous situation in the Black Mountain Guild was countless times worse. He always had to be on guard even when he cultivated, in case he was suddenly attacked.
<br><br>
"If you want such kind of treatment, you have to strive for it yourself," Zen said as he pointed at the main door of the independent courtyard house with his mouth.
<br><br>
As of the moment, the Evil God was still an "unregistered" person in the Source World. However, with his current strength, it was inappropriate for him to stay in the Dragon City for a while and then climb the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen personally spoke to the leaders. Then the Flow Sword Sect accepted the Evil God as a member and arranged him a building to stay in.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God stayed in the building for only three days.
<br><br>
Three days later, the Flow Tower was opened.
<br><br>
The Evil God performed amazingly in the Flow Tower. Although he didn't break Zen's record, he still defeated all the others effortlessly. Eventually, he was also given an independent courtyard house just like Zen.
<br><br>
When Trish and Carrie had heard of the news, they couldn't help but be shocked. A powerful talent like their young master was already quite rare, but now a creature from his inner world turned out to be that strong. They didn't understand how such a thing could be possible.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen didn't bother to explain things to them because he was busy refining the Chaotic Source Spirits for the Evil God.
<br><br>
In reality, it was beyond his abilities to set up that kind of array. He could only turn to Athemar for advice, but the latter was absent and nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the entire Oneness Sky Palace had been rather tense ever since Yasamin of the Origin Mountain was trapped on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After all, Yasamin was the second most powerful figure in the Oneness Sky Palace. As long as she was trapped on the Other Shore, it was like the Oneness Sky Palace had lost a powerful hand.
<br><br>
What made things worse was that the incident had put the Oneness Sky Palace in danger. Now that someone had actually laid a finger on Yasamin, it was obvious that whoever did so could also do the same to the Oneness Sky Palace itself.
<br><br>
All the arrays in the seven mountains of the Bloom Divine Province were activated. The channels to all the passes, transmission arrays, and boundary walls all increased their security. The Oneness Guards who had been staying in the Dragon City were sent out, as if they would face a formidable enemy.
<br><br>
Despite that, Zen did not notice such changes for he had stayed in the Flow Sword Sect. In addition to those changes, even Athemar had also been busy running around arranging the Oneness Sky Palace's defenses.
<br><br>
He didn't return to the Flow Sword Sect until a week later.
<br><br>
Still, he was not surprised when he heard that Zen wanted an array to refine the Chaotic Source Spirits. He had witnessed Zen previously obtain a considerable number of Chaotic Source Spirits outside the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Thus, he granted Zen's request without hesitation. The arrays in the Chaotic Source World had many functions, and refining the Chaotic Source Spirits seemed to be the simplest use.
<br><br>
A few days later, three masters from the Unique Array Sword Sect personally set up an array in the Evil God's independent courtyard house.
<br><br>
Then, the Evil God went inside the array and refined the Chaotic Source Spirits, entering the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Since he had already entered the Chaotic Source Realm, he became qualified to enter the Land of Sword Grief. On the next day, Zen urged Margaret to take good care of herself and ordered Trish and Carrie to look after her well. After that, he went down the mountain with the Evil God and headed straight for the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
The new disciples at the Chaotic Source Realm, including Chaim, were startled when they saw the Evil God.
<br><br>
Even though they knew that Zen had subdued him, they honestly thought that Zen should dispose of him. Much to their surprise, the Evil God actually followed behind Zen. He had even entered the Chaotic Source Realm! In their world, there was probably only one person who was able to help the Evil God enter the Chaotic Source Realm, and that was Zen.
<br><br>
When they saw the Evil God closely follow behind Zen obediently, however, Chaim and the other experienced and knowledgeable warriors quickly realized that the Evil God in front of them seemed to have become an Inner-world Generating Avatar.
<br><br>
"Go find Abdul and ask him to arrange a secluded cultivation room for you," Zen said to the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God never liked it when others ordered him to do things. He seldom obeyed even the extremely powerful warriors in the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Even Shera had to butter him up most of the time just to make him comply.
<br><br>
So when he heard Zen's order, he couldn't help but frown, but he tried his best to suppress his inner impulse to resist.
<br><br>
That was because he did not forget his identity. It was just that he was now a puppet, though he could think.
<br><br>
In the end, he simply nodded and went away to look for Abdul as Zen had instructed.
<br><br>
It wasn't until Chaim saw the Evil God leave that he asked Zen, "Zen, did you know that many things have happened to the Oneness Sky Palace recently?"
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen asked curiously. He did not know of those things because he had been preoccupied with taking care of Margaret in the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
The disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were all elites from the seven mountains. Therefore, if anything happened to the Oneness Sky Palace, the news would spread to the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
Chaim then told Zen all of the current events one by one, including Yasamin being trapped on the Other Shore and the Sun Crow race causing trouble in the Mountain Viewing Province.
<br><br>
With each piece of passing news that Chaim narrated, Zen's brows furrowed more and more tightly.
<br><br>
Somewhere else at the same time, Abdul and a few other senior disciples observed the Evil God with cautious eyes.
<br><br>
Of course, they knew that the Evil God was a disciple who had just entered the Chaotic Source Realm while his Soul of Light was still on Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Therefore, they wondered why he joined the Land of Sword Grief at this time.
<br><br>
Chapter 3580 Restrain "Hey! Newbie! Are you from the Flow Sword Sect of the Oneness Mountain?" Abdul squinted his eyes at the Evil God.
<br><br>
A strong wave of evil energy emanated from him, which greatly displeased Abdul and the other senior disciples.
<br><br>
The Evil God nodded. "Yes."
<br><br>
"Why didn't you join the Land of Sword Grief with the others?" Abdul asked.
<br><br>
The Evil God replied with a shrug, "I don't know."
<br><br>
His less than elaborate reply was met with disapproval from Abdul and the others. "Forget it then. Just tell me your name so I can add it to the Ranking Stone."
<br><br>
Since he came last, his name would be ranked at the lowest place.
<br><br>
"My name is Evil God."
<br><br>
Abdul was a bit taken aback and thought he had misheard.
<br><br>
"What was that? Can you say that again?"
<br><br>
"My name is Evil God," the newcomer repeated.
<br><br>
"Haha!"
<br><br>
His serious answer made the senior disciples burst into laughter.
<br><br>
True Gods could lead long, amazing lives but none of them was cocky enough to call themselves 'Evil God.' This guy who dared to name himself 'Evil God' was a joke! As Abdul and the other senior disciples laughed, the Evil God stewed with restrained anger.
<br><br>
Had it been in the past, he would've already killed them all.
<br><br>
However, Zen specifically instructed him to register with Abdul in order to get himself a cultivation room. The Evil God had no choice but to follow through with his creator's command, so he powered through the ridicule.
<br><br>
"Go and register his name," Abdul said to a disciple once they were done laughing.
<br><br>
It was a fairly straightforward process and soon enough, the Evil God's name had been added to the Ranking Stone.
<br><br>
Abdul then proceeded to tell the Evil God the rules: he had the qualifications to challenge everyone on the first floor on his first day and only after he got a rank could he get his own cultivation room.
<br><br>
"Including you?" the Evil God asked. Abdul couldn't help but scoff in amusement, "Yes, including me but only if you dare!"
<br><br>
"I see." The Evil God nodded in understanding before giving Abdul a determined look. "I'll challenge you then."
<br><br>
The sudden declaration made Abdul freeze, not really knowing how to respond.
<br><br>
It wasn't just him. Everyone who heard was also rendered speechless by the Evil God's sudden challenge.
<br><br>
"Is he an idiot?"
<br><br>
"He must really be crazy then. I mean, who names themselves Evil God?"
<br><br>
Abdul cleared his throat before giving the challenger a mocking smile.
<br><br>
"Well, since you dare challenge me, then there's no way I can refuse!"
<br><br>
Ever since their several shameful defeats by the new disciples, it seemed everyone had begun looking down on the senior disciples of the first floor.
<br><br>
This challenge was seen as an opportunity by Abdul. Perhaps it was time to show his strength to gain back the respect owed to them.
<br><br>
"Where should I challenge you then?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
"Follow me. We're going to the arena!" Abdul instructed. He nodded at the Evil God and went towards the back door of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
"A new disciple is going to challenge Abdul!"
<br><br>
"The battle is about to begin!"
<br><br>
"Abdul has made some progress! This is going to be interesting! Don't miss it, everyone! We'll be able to see his current level through this battle!"
<br><br>
There were still two days left before the new month started and most people in the Land of Sword Grief had already exhausted their challenge rights.
<br><br>
This fight was the first in quite a while.
<br><br>
Of course, it attracted a lot of attention.
<br><br>
With Zen occupying the Myriad Spirits City, the new disciples who were close to him got the most benefits, followed by Abdul. It had been his responsibility to guard the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace before Zen after all.
<br><br>
Since it was said that Abdul's strength had greatly improved, then it might be possible for him to finally reach the top thirty on the first floor. He hadn't given a definite answer when someone asked him about it, but it was pretty obvious that he changed a lot in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Everyone was eager to see just how much he'd improved.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Chaim was busy informing Zen of what happened in the Oneness Sky Palace. "Dorothy hasn't come to the Land of Sword Grief in days?"
<br><br>
Chaim nodded. "Yes. I haven't been seeing her lately."
<br><br>
Everyone knew about Yasamin and Dorothy's relationship and now that the former was in trouble, it was only natural for the latter to feel bad about it.
<br><br>
It seemed Dorothy no longer had the time to come to the Land of Sword Grief to cultivate, but Zen wasn't sure if she had gone to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Yasamin's matter was related to the top masters in the Source World, which was beyond Zen's scope. He could do nothing about it.
<br><br>
At that moment, several cheers and shouts interrupted their conversation.
<br><br>
Zen frowned when he heard what the senior disciples were saying.
<br><br>
"Challenge Abdul?"
<br><br>
Even Chaim frowned in confusion. "He should have the strength to challenge Cleon, right?" asked him.
<br><br>
A lot of the new disciples, Chaim included, didn't like the Evil God mostly due to the fact that he slaughtered the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace back in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
However, since the Evil God had been caught by Zen, they had to let him go.
<br><br>
They were well aware of his strength though. The Evil God was no weaker than Zen so it was a bit of a waste for him to challenge Abdul.
<br><br>
Zen waved his hand dismissively. "Come, let's go to the arena and watch."
<br><br>
Abdul was already standing on the arena.
<br><br>
His eyes were full of desire as he regarded his opponent below.
<br><br>
Zen had asked Chaim to help him deal with everything in the Myriad Spirits City, so the latter was extremely busy.
<br><br>
Abdul had guarded the Myriad Spirits City on behalf of the Oneness Sky Palace and was very familiar with the races that resided in the city. Back when he eliminated the remaining members of the Dark Bear race, he was able to come upon a very unique Other Shore Token. This token was at least the fifth grade and he'd taken it for himself without telling anyone.
<br><br>
He was able to break through to the top ten with the aid of the token.
<br><br>
Today, since he was challenged by the Evil God, he figured it would be a good idea to bring it out.
<br><br>
"Please come up." He gestured to his opponent.
<br><br>
The Evil God stepped onto the arena wordlessly, only emanating a faint evil energy. Back then, his energy alone had been enough to send his opponents running but now, he had to restrain himself.
<br><br>
Those new disciples watching with eagerness all became confused when they saw him step up onto the platform.
<br><br>
"Why is he here?"
<br><br>
"Wasn't he supposed to be taken back into Zen's inner world?"
<br><br>
"Hasn't he been defeated already? How was he able to reach the Chaotic Source Realm?"
<br><br>
Seeing the Evil God in front of them was like a nightmare for these new disciples. Nobody really wanted to see him ever again.
<br><br>
Yet here he stood in the Land of Sword Grief, unharmed and well.
<br><br>
Chapter 3581 As Weak As An Ant The senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief watched the arena with amusement.
<br><br>
Zen had challenged Cleon as soon as he reached the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
But not everyone was as powerful as Zen.
<br><br>
The Evil God had likewise challenged Abdul as soon as he reached the Land of Sword Grief. But judging from the aura of his Soul of Light, he hadn't even reached Stage Fourteen. He appeared to be simply arrogant.
<br><br>
"Since it's your first time to step into the arena, I have to make some rules clear," Abdul told him, with a sneer. "You can't use the abilities of the Other Shore Tokens here. The battle is about pure strength..."
<br><br>
The Evil God wasn't really listening to anything Abdul had to say. But he kept his temper in check and just stared at his opponent calmly.
<br><br>
Battles usually excited the Evil God, but he had no interest in fighting a man like Abdul.
<br><br>
"Did I make myself clear?" Abdul asked patronizingly, after running through the rules.
<br><br>
"I have a question," the Evil God piped up.
<br><br>
Abdul rolled his eyes. "Go ahead."
<br><br>
"Can I use the Godly Ways here?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
"Godly Ways?" Abdul was taken aback.
<br><br>
The senior disciples were stunned into silence for a moment. They all burst out laughing in the next instant.
<br><br>
"Does he even know what he's talking about?"
<br><br>
"Hey, do you know what his name is on the Ranking Stone? Evil God!"
<br><br>
"Haha! What a pompous name!"
<br><br>
The onlookers earlier just wanted to know how much Abdul had improved, especially those ranked before him, who had felt threatened. But now, the Evil God had caught everyone's attention.
<br><br>
Now, the audience was more interested in him.
<br><br>
The new disciples watching, however, knew better than to consider the Evil God as just a mere oddity. They stared at him warily.
<br><br>
They knew it was possible for him to kill Abdul instantly in a fit of anger.
<br><br>
They wondered if he still had the same strength as before. Since Zen dared to release him, he must even be well-prepared.
<br><br>
The Evil God turned a deaf ear to the mockery.
<br><br>
"Of course, you can use the Godly Ways. The arena only forbids the abilities of the Other Shore Tokens. If you want to use the Godly Ways, no one will stop you," Abdul said with a smirk.
<br><br>
"Very well," the Evil God said with a curt nod.
<br><br>
Abdul grinned at him cheekily. "Let's hope you learn your lesson. Next time, remember to carefully choose your opponent!"
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the Other Shore Token in his body began to stir. The surging Other Shore Power began to gather all over his body.
<br><br>
Abdul didn't intend to use his full strength to teach a newcomer a lesson. He only meant to use his full strength to break through to the top ten. It would be wasted on this fellow in front of him now.
<br><br>
"You should be glad that this is the Land of Sword Grief."
<br><br>
Abdul launched himself at the Evil God. " After all, we're both from the Oneness Sky Palace. Don't worry. I won't disable..."
<br><br>
The new disciples held their breath, wondering if the Evil God would use the power of the Inheritance of World. The senior disciples, meanwhile, waited for the Evil God to be sent flying through the air with broken bones and injuries all over his body.
<br><br>
The events that unfolded, however, defied the onlookers' imagination.
<br><br>
Abdul appeared right in front of the Evil God. Before Abdul could finish his words, a ball of energy suddenly appeared in the Evil God's hand.
<br><br>
"Internal momentum?" Someone with sharp eyes recognized it immediately.
<br><br>
"It seems to be a mixture of several Godly Ways, but it's not powerful,"
<br><br>
someone else said, puzzled.
<br><br>
"But this mass of internal momentum..."
<br><br>
Before anyone could come to a conclusion, the ball of energy exploded on Abdul.
<br><br>
Boom! A scorching sun bloomed in the arena.
<br><br>
Purple energy arrows were spread within the blast, each containing overwhelming divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Abdul never got to finish his statement. The explosion left him stunned.
<br><br>
His flesh, blood, and bones were mutilated in the impact. The Chaotic Source Spirits in his body were suddenly drained of power. His entire body was sent flying backward, his energy continuing to be depleted.
<br><br>
Bang! Abdul crashed onto the side of the bronze building. He was grievously injured.
<br><br>
It grew extremely quiet in the arena.
<br><br>
Everyone knew the dangers of battle, but the strength gap between disciples on the first floor usually wasn't too wide. Too, all participants were protected by the Chaotic Source Spirits, so nobody expected they would be seriously injured.
<br><br>
This was the first such serious casualty that happened in the arena.
<br><br>
"Humph! You are as weak as an ant,"
<br><br>
the Evil God snorted. He turned and walked out of the arena.
<br><br>
The disciples' mouths hung wide open as they watched the Evil God leave.
<br><br>
After a long while, someone finally cried out, "Hurry up! Help Abdul!"
<br><br>
Several senior disciples rushed over and pulled Abdul down from the wall.
<br><br>
After someone used a skill to protect his breath of life, he was hurriedly transported away.
<br><br>
The new disciples were left morose at the development. The Evil God was still the same. It seemed that he was controlled by Zen, though, so he was quite restrained.
<br><br>
If he hadn't been, Abdul would probably not be the only one injured in his attack. Everyone here would have been harmed.
<br><br>
The Evil God walked up to Zen. "You didn't stop me, so I went ahead and taught him a lesson."
<br><br>
The Evil God was actually clever.
<br><br>
He knew that Zen wouldn't stand for him killing someone.
<br><br>
So the Evil God left Abdul alive. At least he was punished for his arrogance.
<br><br>
"Well done!"
<br><br>
Zen remarked.
<br><br>
He had long disliked Abdul, actually. He had made such great contributions to the Land of Sword Grief, but Abdul still disliked him.
<br><br>
Back then, his target on the first floor was Cleon, however. Abdul was not good enough to be his target.
<br><br>
So the Evil God ended up teaching Abdul a hard lesson on his behalf.
<br><br>
With Abdul's defeat, the Evil God rose from past one thousand to only past five hundred on the Ranking Stone.
<br><br>
But those who had seen the Evil God's attack now understood that he was likely as powerful as Zen. He was completely qualified to defeat all the disciples on the first floor and even the second floor.
<br><br>
He was a ferocious fighter. Everyone's guard quietly went up. They decided to keep a low profile lest he challenge them next.
<br><br>
After his victory, the Evil God chose to cultivate in seclusion in the cultivation room.
<br><br>
He had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but his soul had yet to reach the Desire World. Only after he accomplished this could he be considered a real Chaotic Source Realm warrior.
<br><br>
Chapter 3582 Secret Contact Even though Zen could take control, he didn't interfere too much in the Evil God's cultivation.
<br><br>
After he heard what Chaim had said before, he felt an alarming sense of urgency. He also needed to improve himself immediately.
<br><br>
The rising wind foreboded the coming storm, or so they said. It seemed that the peacefulness in the Source World wouldn't last long.
<br><br>
In Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, a Soul of Light continued to condense until it quickly turned into a human figure.
<br><br>
This human figure emitted a sinister and evil aura. It was the Evil God, the notorious Soul Devouring Demon in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World.
<br><br>
Not far from the Evil God were several Souls of Light who came from different races and had different forms.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, all the powerful and qualified creatures in Stage Thirteen had been to the Chaotic Source World. They had all left the Lust World and reached the Desire World, and only a few relatively weak Souls of Light who didn't get the tickets were left behind.
<br><br>
They gestured to each other when they sensed the Evil God's powerful Soul of Light. Then, one of them walked towards the Evil God and said, "Human friend, we just got the key to a temple. Would you like to explore it with us?"
<br><br>
The Evil God coldly glanced at them. He had only disappeared for a few months, but these creatures in the Lust World seemed to have forgotten him.
<br><br>
"Leave me alone," he hissed.
<br><br>
It took him a lot of effort to come to the Other Shore, and he had something more important to do.
<br><br>
If it wasn't for his current situation, he would've swallowed them all up alive.
<br><br>
However, the creatures did not leave. One of them, who appeared to be their leader, suddenly brought out a handful of Soul Restraining Sand and scattered it on his body.
<br><br>
The green sand enveloped his body and soon enough, he couldn't escape from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Let's attack him together! He's got a strong Soul of Light! We'll gain a lot from this!" the creature cried out.
<br><br>
Whoosh! At that moment, a rope went straight towards the Evil God and firmly bound his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Yet, the Evil God seemed unbothered. He simply asked in an icy voice, "What do you want?"
<br><br>
The leader of the creatures was overjoyed to see that they had caught the Evil God quite easily.
<br><br>
"You have such a powerful Soul of Light. We can refine a lot of soul crystal with it!" he exclaimed. "Refine soul crystal?" said the Evil God, as his eyes narrowed into slits.
<br><br>
As far as he knew, the soul crystal couldn't be refined because it was difficult to erase the memories of the Souls of Light. Only after numerous years of purification could pure soul crystal be formed.
<br><br>
Thus, he wondered why these creatures claimed that they were able to refine soul crystal.
<br><br>
"Yes, you don't have to think too much." The creature chuckled and said, "Let's take him back together!"
<br><br>
At their leader's command, the other creatures rushed forward and hoisted the Evil God above their heads.
<br><br>
Just as they were about to set out, they suddenly felt a sharp stab of pain in their arms, which felt like they were splashed with sulfuric acid. In the next second, their arms were burnt off.
<br><br>
The pain was too unbearable for them that they wanted to drop the Evil God, but their hands and feet had already melted into his body, which made it impossible for them to let go of him.
<br><br>
"Splash!"
<br><br>
Eventually, the Evil God quickly devoured the creatures' heads, bodies, legs, and feet… In just a few seconds, the Evil God had consumed all the creatures that carried him.
<br><br>
Only the outermost creature had half of his body left, but he clearly wouldn't be able to pull himself out of the Evil God's Soul of Light. "You, you are the legendary Soul Devouring Demon..." he stammered.
<br><br>
"Yes, you are right," the Evil God answered. He lightly shook his body, and the rope that bound him broke inch by inch. After that, he grabbed half of the creature's body and absorbed it in a split second.
<br><br>
In the Source World, Zen controlled the Evil God's every move. The Evil God had no other choice but to obey.
<br><br>
However, it was different on the Other Shore. As long as Zen didn't bring the Evil God back into his inner world, he wouldn't be able to find the Evil God's memories of the Other Shore in his mind.
<br><br>
The Other Shore was the Evil God's only chance.
<br><br>
As soon as he found his direction, he wasted no time and ran away.
<br><br>
There were many strongholds of great races, both large and small, that were densely packed in the west area of Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
When the Evil God arrived at his destination, he concealed his aura and shuttled through those strongholds.
<br><br>
Not long after, he found a low building.
<br><br>
At the building's entrance were two human-shaped creatures.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" one of the human-shaped creatures snapped when he saw the Evil God.
<br><br>
"The ship sails without limits," replied the Evil God.
<br><br>
The two human-shaped creatures recognized the code, and their hearts pounded in their chests. Then, they quickly made way for the Evil God.
<br><br>
There were several creatures that guarded the low building.
<br><br>
They were the most powerful creatures of the Black Mountain Guild. They would even be considered as talented disciples if they were in a super force.
<br><br>
Of course, they still weren't qualified to join the Black Ship. After all, the members of the Black Ship were so-called one-in-a-million talents.
<br><br>
"Hello, Evil God!"
<br><br>
"I heard that your creator had caught you in the Chaotic Source World!"
<br><br>
"Even the invincible Evil God has to surrender. Hahaha..."
<br><br>
Some of them sneered at him when he arrived.
<br><br>
They had all suffered losses because of the Evil God in the Black Mountain Guild, and two of them had even almost died in his hands. However, their hearts held no real resentment, as they were used to the infamous cruelty of the Black Mountain Guild.
<br><br>
"Cut the crap. Can you get in touch with the Black Ship?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
One of the burly creatures shook his head as he said, "The Black Ship came frequently when you were in the Black Mountain Guild. Since you went to the Chaotic Source World last time, the Black Ship has never appeared."
<br><br>
There was no doubt that these creatures were very jealous of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"I remember that there is a contact array in the Black Mountain Guild.
<br><br>
When you are in danger, you can call for the Black Ship to descend," the Evil God said.
<br><br>
"As you said, we won't use the array unless we are in danger," the burly creature answered.
<br><br>
"I'm in danger now," the Evil God said in a deep voice.
<br><br>
"You are not one of us." The burly creature's laugh filled the space.
<br><br>
The Evil God stood still for a few seconds. He knew that it was unrealistic for him to expect these creatures to help him, but it would be great if they didn't add insult to injury.
<br><br>
He thought for a while, and then he proposed, "Whoever helps me contact the Black Ship will be awarded with ten finger-size chunks of soul crystal!"
<br><br>
The Evil God himself didn't need soul crystal. He only needed to continuously devour the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Souls of Light in front of him were very hungry for soul crystal.
<br><br>
The moment the Evil God offered his price, some of the creatures lit up in excitement. The burly creature realized that he couldn't pass up such a good chance, so he agreed first. "Ten finger-size chunks of soul crystal, and I'll help you contact the Black Ship now!" he declared.
<br><br>
"I don't need ten finger-size chunks. Nine is enough."
<br><br>
"Give me six! I'll activate the contact array!"
<br><br>
It turned out that there was no unity among the creatures of the Black Mountain Guild. Since it wasn't difficult to activate the contact array, the other creatures immediately chose to compete with the burly creature.
<br><br>
The Evil God simply ignored them and turned to the burly creature. "You activate the contact array, and I'll go find the soul crystal," he said.
<br><br>
Afterwards he went straight out of the stronghold.
<br><br>
The corner of his lips curved up into a small smirk. It was definitely an easy task for him to plunder ten finger-size chunks of soul crystal.
<br><br>
Chapter 3583 Change In some province, the big Black Ship cut across the sky quick as a flash.
<br><br>
Following behind the Black Ship were two huge golden Buddha statues being carried atop the shoulders of a ten-thousand-foot-tall bald giant.
<br><br>
The bald giant's eyes shone green and an immense string of Buddha beads hung around his neck and rested on his chest. His upper body was bare and his muscles bulged like massive hills.
<br><br>
"Now that I am here, don't even try to escape! Hand them over! It's time we settle the score!"
<br><br>
roared the bald giant.
<br><br>
The words thundered from his mouth, sending out strong and powerful reverberating sound waves through the air.
<br><br>
There just so happened to be a medium-sized country below the bald giant, with several types of creatures living there. Most of them were mortals with a lifespan of less than a hundred years.
<br><br>
To them, the rumbles from the sky were like the end of the world.
<br><br>
Many of them didn't even have the chance to react before they were hit by the sound, turned into a cloud of blood mist and disappeared into thin air.
<br><br>
The tall buildings, walls and streets were all blasted into powder, reducing the city to a dusty desert.
<br><br>
There were many mortals in the Source World who lived like ants. Dying in an instant as powerful warriors fought was quite common for creatures like them.
<br><br>
The bald giant had been referring to the Descending Rings the Black Ship had taken from the Thunder Dimorphodon when he spoke.
<br><br>
Since they had snatched the Descending Rings, the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race had been working together and attempted to lay siege to them many times in the Source World.
<br><br>
But time and time again the Black Ship had disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
They had still not managed to destroy the Black Ship or even get hold of a single member of the crew thus far.
<br><br>
At the end of the Black Ship hung a dinghy with two gold locks. When the Black Ship flew at high speed, the dinghy moved like a swing floating in the air.
<br><br>
Sitting on the swinging dinghy was Shera.
<br><br>
Hearing the giant's roar, she replied with a smile on her face, "I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about."
<br><br>
Her voice was not as loud as the giant's but traveled far away. The creatures throughout half the province could hear it all the same.
<br><br>
They looked around from below, in search of the source of the voice but to no avail.
<br><br>
"You're asking for it now!"
<br><br>
The malicious aura on the bald giant's face flashed, and his shoulders suddenly trembled. The two Buddha statues on his shoulders rose up.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
The bald giant waved his hands towards the Black Ship, and the two Buddha statues mirrored him.
<br><br>
Tens of millions of huge palm prints swept across the sky in an instant.
<br><br>
At first, they were scattered chaotically but soon began overlapping, turning into a mighty and solid palm print.
<br><br>
The palm print quickly covered the Black Ship.
<br><br>
This sight excited Shera to her core. It seemed as though she had something she wanted to verify here.
<br><br>
Creak! Creak! Creak! The Black Ship began creaking under the terrifying pressure of the palm print. It sounded as if it would snap and disintegrate any moment now.
<br><br>
But as the palm print approached the Black Ship, a circle of silver light suddenly appeared on the Black Ship's surface. The palm print touched the light and left a palm print on it.
<br><br>
With a smile on her face, Shera flicked her fingers at the bald giant, softly uttering, "Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The bald giant's broad chest suddenly sank, a huge palm print appearing on it.
<br><br>
His own terrifying attack had just been deflected back at him.
<br><br>
Caught off guard, the bald giant was slapped down from the sky and fell hard.
<br><br>
Boom! His huge body smashed into the ground, forming a crater millions of feet deep. The hundreds of gigantic mountains around him collapsed one by one. Countless creatures were injured and died.
<br><br>
The bald giant's bronze body was incredibly tough. Even a strike of this magnitude only managed to stop his breathing for a few seconds. He smashed his enormous fist on the ground, and bounced into the air once more.
<br><br>
But when he looked into the distance, to his surprise, there was nothing there. The Black Ship had escaped.
<br><br>
Shera got up from the dinghy and made her way towards the cabin.
<br><br>
There, she found the "bamboo pole" complaining, "Since we acquired the Descending Rings, we've been hunted constantly, being chased every other day."
<br><br>
The new Other Shore Token the Black Ship had obtained, a silver sphere, floated above the head of the "bamboo pole".
<br><br>
This was the first time it had been put to use and its effects were more than satisfactory.
<br><br>
"This sort of life is not new to us," Shera said, trying to comfort the "bamboo pole".
<br><br>
"But the Descending Rings are useless! The three warriors that descended have all died. They are flawed," the "bamboo pole" whined discontentedly.
<br><br>
"The problem lies in the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, but Zen has taken them," Shera sighed.
<br><br>
The Black Ship had done a thorough investigation into Zen's identity and Shera suggested the captain head to the Oneness Sky Palace and capture him.
<br><br>
However, not only was it incredibly difficult to remove Zen in the base of the Oneness Sky Palace, it seemed there was something else the captain was afraid of. So for now, they could do nothing but wait.
<br><br>
But while they waited, they were chased the entire time and this was what upset the "bamboo pole".
<br><br>
Just as Shera comforted the "bamboo pole", an unremarkable contact rune beside lit up.
<br><br>
She looked at the contact rune and a strange expression contorted her face.
<br><br>
"The contact array of the Black Mountain Guild has been activated. Is someone planning an attack on them?"
<br><br>
"Leave them alone," the "bamboo pole" huffed.
<br><br>
The Black Mountain Guild was not under the direct control of the Black Ship. There was no obligation for them to protect the Black Mountain Guild.
<br><br>
Shera blinked and the figure of the Evil God appeared in her mind.
<br><br>
An odd feeling swirled in her gut and this prompted her to return to her room. Once there, she took out a small bottle, the blurry figure of the Evil God still outlined in it.
<br><br>
Since the Evil God had been put into Zen's inner world, this figure hadn't moved. All it proved was that he was still alive but his current state was unknowable.
<br><br>
Although Shera had already given up, she would still pull out this bottle and have a look at it from time to time.
<br><br>
"Eh?"
<br><br>
Shock and uneasiness filled Shera's eyes. The blurry figure of the Evil God sat cross-legged in the bottle, as if he was cultivating.
<br><br>
'Has he regained his freedom? That's impossible.' Shera threw this thought out immediately. If the Evil God had achieved freedom, he would have already tried to contact her.
<br><br>
Had he obtained freedom but was under Zen's control? That was probably the case.
<br><br>
Shera had judged the situation accurately in a snap.
<br><br>
Chapter 3584 The Colorless Soul In Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, a row of transparent jars, each filled with soul crystal, sat in the inner hall of the City Guard House.
<br><br>
Zen was sitting upright in the form of his Soul of Light, continuously absorbing the soul crystal.
<br><br>
The situation in Stage Fourteen had been stable for a while now.
<br><br>
The Guide Weasel race and the Giant race controlled the two large cities, and these two races were Zen's subjects.
<br><br>
Zen didn't have to do anything. All the resources belonging to Stage Fourteen would be automatically, continuously sent to him.
<br><br>
But it was impossible for Zen to stay in Stage Fourteen. He needed to climb up to the upper stages and for this purpose, he had to strengthen his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Zen's soul was absorbing the soul crystal and slowly turning it into a part of his soul. From afar, his Indigo Soul looked to be a shade of deep purple.
<br><br>
The purple light on the surface of Zen's soul thickened as Zen absorbed more and more of the soul crystal.
<br><br>
After all the soul crystal from the jars had been absorbed completely, Zen looked up and asked the Giants to bring him more soul crystal.
<br><br>
Several Giants entered the inner hall, jars in their hands. They put them in a neat order and then retreated respectfully.
<br><br>
Zen pointed to the jars, turning the soul crystal in them into a thin line, which then began to fuse with his body.
<br><br>
Once Zen had absorbed the soul crystal from three jars, it felt to him like he had hit a wall. The purple light on the surface of his body seemed to have reached its limit.
<br><br>
Zen frowned and tried harder to absorb the soul crystal. But a sense of rejection washed over him.
<br><br>
"What is going on?" Zen muttered curiously.
<br><br>
Warriors needed to continuously devour the soul crystal. As long as they got enough soul crystal, their soul cultivation would increase rapidly.
<br><br>
Dorothy had told him this in Stage One when Zen had first laid eyes on the soul crystal.
<br><br>
But now he was unable to absorb it. Why? Zen was still confused when No. 9527 said, "You have reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. You can't improve it any further."
<br><br>
"The ultimate level of the Indigo Soul?"
<br><br>
Zen stretched out a hand and looked at the surface of his palm, which was shining, bathed in a strong purple light.
<br><br>
"Yes. The soul crystal cannot infinitely improve your soul. It will reach its limit after absorbing enough soul crystal. This limit is called the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul," No. 9527 explained.
<br><br>
Zen thought for a while before asking, "If this is the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, have Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Master Athemar, and Lady Flamine all reached this level?"
<br><br>
Zen still couldn't believe what No. 9527 had said.
<br><br>
Zen had felt a lot of pressure while facing strong masters like Elizabeth and Athemar. He had known then that the auras their souls were emitting were much stronger than his.
<br><br>
"It's true, theoretically speaking," No. 9527 said. "But there are still other ways to strengthen your soul after you reach the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. Once you make it to Stage Twenty Nine, also known as the Constant Glory Stage, you will enter the Soul City, transform your soul into Colorless Soul, and step into a new level."
<br><br>
"Colorless Soul?" It was the first time that Zen had heard of it.
<br><br>
"That's right," No. 9527 said, nodding. "By then, your soul will no longer be ordinary. The Colorless Soul is much stronger than the ordinary soul.
<br><br>
You will be strong enough to fight against the bodies."
<br><br>
The Souls of Light had always been depressed on the Other Shore. No matter which stage they were in, they had been suppressed by any and every Other Shore creature without being able to resist them.
<br><br>
But if they were to achieve a Colorless Soul in Stage Twenty Nine, things would drastically change for them.
<br><br>
The physical bodies were undoubtedly powerful. But they would have the power to counterattack once their souls transformed into a new form. Some of the more outstanding souls even had the strength to kill Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
"Besides, I want to correct your notion," No. 9527 continued. "Lady Flamine, Elizabeth, and Athemar have all been to the Soul City and cultivated the Colorless Soul. But Eastern Emperor Taiyi is different. He has entered Stage Thirty Three, the Three Purities Stage, which is why his soul level is higher. It is stronger than the Colorless Soul."
<br><br>
"There's another level above the Colorless Soul?" Zen asked, his eyes flashing.
<br><br>
"More than one level," No. 9527 said, smiling.
<br><br>
"More than one level?" Zen exclaimed.
<br><br>
"Yes. The Three Purities Stage is the core of the Other Shore. Every section provides its own opportunities. Both physical bodies and souls are suffering, yet becoming stronger. Those who step into it are extraordinary.
<br><br>
Until now, no one has entered the depths of the Three Purities Stage. No one knows what level the soul can reach and how strong the physical body can become there. You can ask the Regal Jade Spirit," No. 9527 said.
<br><br>
"No. 9527, you have explained everything in detail. You must have stepped into the Three Purities Stage before," the Regal Jade Spirit said.
<br><br>
No. 9527 hesitated before saying, "I don't have any memories of my master going into the Three Purities Stage. But as far as I know, he must have reached the Grand Pure Realm."
<br><br>
The Three Purities Stage was divided into three realms. The outermost realm was the Grand Pure Realm, the middle realm was the Supreme Pure Realm, and the innermost one was the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit let out a sudden sigh. This conversation seemed to remind him of something from the past. He said, "Back in the day, the Wing King led us to explore the Three Purities Stage. We had covered three million miles of the Grand Pure Realm by then and it was said that we would see the edge of the Supreme Pure Realm if we traversed one million miles more. But we weren't lucky enough to step into it."
<br><br>
"Is the Three Purities Stage that dangerous? You couldn't even get through it with your physical bodies?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Physical bodies?" The Regal Jade Spirit shook his head and smiled. "In the age of the Regal Jade Civilization, the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was not forbidden on the Other Shore. The Wing King boasted of a strong physical body at the time, but it had still been difficult for him to move even a single step in the Three Purities Stage."
<br><br>
All creatures of the Regal Jade Civilization had extremely powerful physical bodies.
<br><br>
"As far as I know, no one was able to even enter the Supreme Pure Realm before our era. The Jade Pure Realm, which is considered the core, remains a dream," the Regal Jade Spirit continued.
<br><br>
Many civilizations had explored the Other Shore for many chaotic eras. But they had only wandered around the periphery of the Three Purities Stage for a long time.
<br><br>
At the Regal Jade Spirit's words, Zen's eyes lit up. He was very obviously interested in the upper stages on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Since he had devoured enough soul crystal and reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, he was going to break through to the upper stages.
<br><br>
And although Zen was still quite some distance from the Constant Glory Stage, he had reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul and would probably traverse the distance with ease. But then again, he still had an Other Shore Key from Stage Seventeen in his hand.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Key had been obtained from the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. It was likely to be related to the secrets of the human race on the Other Shore. He had no choice but to investigate it.

<br><br>
A considerable part of the soul crystal collected was distributed to the disciples on the first floor of the Land of Sword Grief. Even Cleon, who ranked first, received some. Almost all the disciples on the first floor retreated to Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
But Zen himself had also reserved a considerable amount of soul crystal, which he intended to give to Yan, Dorothy, Elvinia, and the Nine Li people.
<br><br>
Once the soul crystal was removed, the Giants positioned a stack of Bodystrengthening Jades. Simultaneously, Zen retreated from the Other Shore before reentering with his physical body.
<br><br>
Many Body-strengthening Jades were crushed one after another, each one absorbed and refined by Zen.
<br><br>
Now, Zen's body drew strength from several aspects. First, the strength of his body itself was incomparable to any other's even before he reached the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Second, he had the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Through the Truth of Godly Way produced by his weapon body, Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits had grown leaps and bounds ahead. Now that Zen had almost reached the later stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, the limit his physical body could bear was even greater.
<br><br>
Third, after absorbing more blood of the Chaos Ancient God, his body structure had changed—the sclerites could greatly strengthen his body in a special kind of way.
<br><br>
Lastly, he had the Shade Stone liquid. It was a pity that the stone was so rare—he had already asked the Ear Mouse race to help him find some. So long as they found any sort of treasure made of the Shade Stone, they could buy it for him at any price. Such a method of strengthening body was also rather unique.
<br><br>
Apart from the Chaotic Source Spirits, Zen seemed to use rather unique strengthening techniques.
<br><br>
It was the most common way to strengthen his body with the Bodystrengthening Jades. But right now, only Zen and Elvinia could use such a method.
<br><br>
After absorbing a few Body-strengthening Jades, Zen picked up another one and asked, "The soul's limit is the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, so does that mean that the body has a limit as well?"
<br><br>
After a moment of silence, No. 9527 burst into laughter. "It's a physical body—of course there's a limit."
<br><br>
In ancient times, the Wild Gods had absorbed the Body-strengthening Jades to grow stronger on the Other Shore. It was then called the Wild God Body Realm, which corresponded to the level of Indigo Soul.
<br><br>
But once the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was forbidden, no one had continued cultivating the method any more. Fewer and fewer creatures came to know about the Wild God Body Realm. Theoretically, the Chaotic Source Realm merely referred to a means of strengthening body—it wasn't that accurate to call it a realm.
<br><br>
But no one could do anything about the rules of the entire chaos.
<br><br>
"Is there a place like the Soul City in an upper stage for body strengthening?" Zen raised another question.
<br><br>
"Bingo! But it's not in Stage Twenty-nine. It's in Stage Thirty, called the Land of Bone Tribulation," replied No. 9527.
<br><br>
"The Land of Bone Tribulation…" Zen muttered, more to himself, keeping the name in mind.
<br><br>
He would get to that place sooner or later, he decided, no matter what. Right now, his priority was strengthening his body.
<br><br>
Body-strengthening Jades were sent in one after another, and Zen acquired them all.
<br><br>
The Giants in charge of sending the Body-strengthening Jades seemed a tad envious.
<br><br>
Whether it was the soul crystal or the Body-strengthening Jade, both were highly useful for Other Shore creatures. But their body-strengthening range remained quite limited.
<br><br>
Limited by this stage, once they reached a certain level, they wouldn't be able to grow any further.
<br><br>
The amount of Body-strengthening Jades Zen had absorbed was enough to work on over a hundred Giants. Seeing how Zen's momentum seemed endless, they couldn't tell how many more he'd absorb.
<br><br>
"Again!"
<br><br>
Zen gave the order after absorbing the rest of the jades.
<br><br>
Even though he was aware of how many he was absorbing, his body hadn't seemed to reach its limit yet.
<br><br>
One of the Giants cupped his hands toward Zen. "Sir, there is no Bodystrengthening Jade left in the Myriad Spirits City…"
<br><br>
"There's no more left?" Zen's face dropped in disappointment.
<br><br>
"Both our Giants and the Guide Weasel race still have some. If you need them, I can go find Master Raul," added the Giant.
<br><br>
These Giants could raise their position in the Myriad Spirits City because of Zen's help. While they were known to be fierce and merciless in battle, they were honest and loyal companions. They contributed all they could to Zen without any reservation.
<br><br>
"No," Zen shook his head. He knew that the Giants would willingly bring out all the Body-strengthening Jades, but he had no need to absorb their stock. "What about the Sky Water City?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"A batch of Body-strengthening Jades had been sent here from the Sky Water City. You and Master Elvinia have already refined them. I'm afraid it's quite difficult for them to collect and send more so soon…" the Giant answered regretfully.
<br><br>
Compared to the soul crystal, the Body-strengthening Jades were much more popular. Ordinary Other Shore creatures didn't climb to the higher stages, after all. They needed the Body-strengthening Jades to strengthen themselves, so they didn't have many kept away.
<br><br>
"I see," Zen nodded in understanding.
<br><br>
After that, he headed over to another inner hall.
<br><br>
Here, Elvinia was also absorbing the Body-strengthening Jades.
<br><br>
She could only strengthen her purified being's body on the Other Shore after absorbing the jade. Elvinia's own body in the Source World couldn't benefit from it. Still, increasing the limit of her purified being's body was good for her—she wasn't planning on slacking off.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen arrive, she crushed the last Body-strengthening Jade and quickly absorbed it. Then, she smiled and turned to Zen. "I've refined all of them!"
<br><br>
Elvinia could feel how much her purified being's body had strengthened—it made her hope for more Body-strengthening Jades.
<br><br>
After Zen had refused her in the Oneness Sky Palace, she had remained rather calm. She knew what Zen was thinking, after all. There was no need to rush. Instead, she went over to her father to offer him comfort.
<br><br>
"We've refined all the Body-strengthening Jades in Stage Fourteen. If we want to collect more, we'll have to ascend to higher stages," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
"So we're leaving this stage?" Elvinia's eyes flashed with excitement.
<br><br>
It was unrealistic to stay in Stage Fourteen, after all. She had long hoped to move on to higher stages alongside Zen.
<br><br>
"There are two more things to see to before we leave," Zen said.
<br><br>
The Dark Nether Bugs seemed to be strongly attractive to the purified beings. With that, Zen concluded that devouring the Dark Nether Bugs was a way to enhance the purified beings' abilities.
<br><br>
So during this time, he had ordered the Guide Weasel race to enter the Dark Region and communicate with the one-eyed monsters, in the hopes of capturing more Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
Devouring the bloody, fleshy Dark Nether Bugs with some grace wasn't much of a problem—the attraction force of the Dark Nether Bugs came from their blood essence. Elvinia could absorb it after separating it from the bug body.
<br><br>
Aside from the Dark Nether Bugs, he wanted to get his hands on another Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Zen's Strength God Totem was an Other Shore Token of strengthening type from Stage Thirteen, containing 1, 200 divine megatons of force only. It wasn't weak by any means in Stage Thirteen, but it couldn't meet his requirements now that he was in Stage Fourteen. Besides, the Civilization Artifact in Zen's body could provide much Other Shore Power. So, he had to replace the Strength God Totem if he got the chance.
<br><br>
Chapter 3586 Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow After Zen had taken out the black box, he quickly began to deal with the bloody Dark Nether Bugs.
<br><br>
It was just as he had guessed. The blood inside them was strongly attractive to living beings.
<br><br>
That was why when he and Elvinia first saw the bugs, they felt a strange sensation.
<br><br>
However, Zen restrained himself and dismissed such feelings. On the contrary, Elvinia couldn't abandon the desire in her body, as she was a purified being.
<br><br>
Since Zen had killed the stage ruler, he had also become a purified being and probably understood Elvinia's impulses. When he had opened the black box, he was eager to swallow the mass of blood and flesh. It was very difficult for him to restrain himself with his willpower alone.
<br><br>
"Since it's because of the blood, the corpses can be disposed of..."
<br><br>
He squeezed out all the blood from the Dark Nether Bugs, and then took out the broken corpses from the black box. The Light Region would completely devour the bug corpses once they arrived there.
<br><br>
As for the blood in the dark box, he had tried to taste it, but he didn't feel that much of a desire except for being able to tell it had a delicious taste.
<br><br>
Once he had confirmed that it was completely fine, he let Elvinia have a few sips. A smile graced her small face.
<br><br>
"I almost ate this disgusting bug in the Dark Region. I didn't expect that I would drink its blood now..." she commented.
<br><br>
Immediately after both of them shared the Dark Nether Bugs' blood, Zen tried to release the Great Sanskrit Light and also let Elvinia try it.
<br><br>
As Elvinia waved her hand, her body released a blazing white beam of light. The entire inner hall was filled with the white light for a while. "How do you feel now?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Maybe it has grown a little bit..." Elvinia answered hesitantly. "The blood has only a little effect. It seems this kind of bug isn't considered that precious.
<br><br>
If you want to grow substantially, you might have to swallow a lot of bugs,"
<br><br>
Zen said with a grin.
<br><br>
The ruler of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore had stayed in the Dark Region for so many years, and he had devoured numerous Dark Nether Bugs. Yet, he still hadn't become invincible, which meant that consuming only one or two Dark Nether Bugs would have little effect.
<br><br>
Elvinia just stuck out her tongue childishly and sighed. Although the Dark Nether Bug was quite attractive, she still felt nauseous at the thought of having to drink the blood of many bugs.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Guide Weasel race had already laid out the Other Shore Tokens they had previously collected.
<br><br>
There were many Other Shore Tokens in this particular batch, totaling to more than six hundred. Some of them were weapons that the Giant race and the Guide Weasel race had treasured for many years.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen wouldn't secretly keep those Other Shore Tokens. After he and Elvinia selected what they wanted, he would ask Yan and the Nine Li members to pick their own next. Then, the disciples of the Land of Sword Grief could also choose their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Beside the Other Shore Tokens were two Ear Mice on standby.
<br><br>
In the Guide Weasel race's opinion, all of the Other Shore Tokens were either relatively powerful weapons, or magic treasures that contained energy. It was hard for them to sort and separate the good from bad.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Ear Mice were talents who were all good at dealing, and also adept at identifying the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
In addition, although the Other Shore Tokens in front of them were rare, they might have already seen, used or kept a considerable portion of them in the past.
<br><br>
"Master Thad, there is only one sixth-grade Other Shore Token among them. Please have a look," one of the Ear Mice said when it saw Zen.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen looked over and saw a golden sparrow statue.
<br><br>
Based from its appearance, the sparrow statue didn't appear to be anything special. However, it was at the sixth grade, so it was likely that it wasn't as simple as it looked.
<br><br>
"This Other Shore Token is called the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow," the Ear Mouse explained. "It has only appeared once in the history of the entire Source World."
<br><br>
A trace of curiosity filled Elvinia's eyes as she stood beside Zen and looked on. She asked, "What ability does this Other Shore Token have?"
<br><br>
"Once the Other Shore Token has been fused, it can't be activated or used in normal times. It can only be activated after the owner dies," the Ear Mouse replied.
<br><br>
"After death?" Zen slightly frowned.
<br><br>
He had seen similar abilities before. Some of the Latent Theurgies would only be activated after death, but since the owner was dead, what was the use of activating them? Even Elvinia just shrugged. They couldn't activate it until they died. No matter how powerful the Other Shore Token was, it didn't mean much if that was the case.
<br><br>
Upon seeing Elvinia's reaction, the Ear Mouse added, "Don't underestimate the ability of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow. After it is activated, it will enter a state of wrath and kill and devour whoever kills you.
<br><br>
It's extremely powerful!" "So what? It can only be used to kill the enemy after its master dies, right?" Elvinia muttered.
<br><br>
"After it devours the opponent, it will give birth to its master again inside its body. Everything will be as good as before after its master's rebirth," the Ear Mouse said in response.
<br><br>
Naturally, Zen was shocked when he heard what the Ear Mouse had said. "It can bring its master back to life? You mean one can still be reborn even after they break into pieces?" he asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
"That's right. Not to mention their broken bodies, even their magic treasures, weapons, and their space rings can be restored afterwards. Strictly speaking, the ability of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow is not to revive someone, but rather to completely restore its master and their items to the previous condition."
<br><br>
Indeed, the abilities of Other Shore Tokens were always extremely amazing.
<br><br>
For example, Chaim's golden abacus was a very powerful object. Even if he were to face a strong warrior in the Source World, let alone Mount with a low cultivation base, he could use the abacus to restrain their Other Shore Power, no matter how great it was.
<br><br>
Such unique abilities were often beyond imagination.
<br><br>
"If one could fuse with this Other Shore Token, does it mean that they can not be dead?" Elvinia asked. It appeared that she, too, was quite interested in the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"Of course not. Every time the one who has fused with it dies, one eye of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow will be blind. Once it gets blind three times, it would be completely destroyed and cannot be used again.
<br><br>
Even so, since this Other Shore Token is in the sixth grade, it is definitely not weak," the Ear Mouse answered. "If it can revive its master infinitely, I think it can completely surpass the sixth grade, right?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
Even the incomparable Other Shore Token like the Heart of Accomplice had quite a catch—one had to sacrifice their own life while they utilized it, and it was a one-time use only.
<br><br>
Then again, to fuse with the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow meant being immortal, and it could even devour one's opponent. It was simply too powerful that Zen felt it was truly incredible.
<br><br>
Squeak! "It has limits. After you have activated it, it needs to devour the opponent to revive its master. Furthermore, it could only be used three times, and one eye will be blind every time you use it. Lastly, the Threeeyed Dragon Sparrow is not invincible. If your opponent has fled away after killing you, or if they are too powerful to be devoured, it clearly wouldn't be able to resurrect you," the Ear Mouse replied.
<br><br>
Chapter 3587 Stage Fifteen Of The Other Shore Even though the Ear Mouse had specified some flaws regarding the Other Shore Token, it was still undeniably powerful.
<br><br>
This Other Shore Token was the most powerful treasure of the Star Falcon race. It could also be activated on the Other Shore and be turned into a powerful Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had their eyes on the Other Shore Token for a long time.
<br><br>
However, the Star Falcon race would not give in no matter how grand the price they were offered.
<br><br>
Now that the Star Falcon race had been exterminated, their most powerful treasure fell into the hands of Zen.
<br><br>
Although the Other Shore Token was extremely powerful, Zen wanted something else.
<br><br>
As he noticed that Elvinia was actually interested in it, he asked, "What kind of Truth of Godly Way is needed to fuse with this Other Shore Token?"
<br><br>
He thought that if the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent didn't match the Other Shore Token, Elvinia might not be able to merge with it.
<br><br>
"The Truth of Cultivation Nature," the Ear Mouse quickly replied.
<br><br>
Zen stared at Elvinia's face. As he was about to speak, Elvinia said, "I've already successfully cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature."
<br><br>
She was indeed very talented. Even Flamine once said that Elvinia matched the Truth of Cultivation Nature to a high degree. It was just that her cultivation was restricted when she was young.
<br><br>
However, as Elvinia had gone deeper and deeper in the Other Shore Realm, these restrictions were gradually lifted and ceased to exist.
<br><br>
"Then that's great. You can take this Other Shore Token and fuse with it,"
<br><br>
Zen added with a faint smile.
<br><br>
Since she really wanted it, Elvinia didn't decline the offer and gladly accepted the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
After that, Zen gazed across the table and looked at the other items present.
<br><br>
The two Ear Mice were very considerate in answering all of Zen's queries about the items. They had a deep understanding of every Other Shore Token, which impressed Zen very much.
<br><br>
After some time of thorough inspection, he wasn't able to find an Other Shore Token that would be suitable for him to fuse with. However, there was a long sword that caught his attention.
<br><br>
The long sword turned out to be forged by the Riverside race. There were layers of cloud patterns on the sword, and the structure was very complicated and exquisite.
<br><br>
"This sword is a precious one from the Riverside race. If it were assessed as an Other Shore Token, it would easily be considered as a fourth-grade one in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore," an Ear Mouse explained.
<br><br>
"Really? I want this one," Zen responded.
<br><br>
"Do you want to fuse with it as an Other Shore Token?" the Ear Mouse asked.
<br><br>
An Other Shore Token could be used as a weapon, but Zen had something else in mind.
<br><br>
"No, I don't," Zen smiled faintly as he shook his head. "I would use this one as my accompanying sword on the Other Shore."
<br><br>
Zen had already entered the Other Shore for a long time, but he didn't have a decent weapon. He was just basically fighting with his bare hands. He thought that this might be a good choice to have a long, handy sword.
<br><br>
After selecting the Other Shore Tokens, they had to consider going to the higher stages of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If the one-eyed monsters got a hold of any Dark Nether Bugs in the Dark Region, they would give them to the Insect Master race. After they returned to Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore later, they would surely come get them.
<br><br>
Elvinia was totally determined to follow Zen to the higher stages.
<br><br>
At the gate of the Myriad Spirits City, Raul and Clyde saw them off in person. As soon as Zen left, the entire Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore was managed by the two races.
<br><br>
Before leaving, Zen quickly asked, "Has Dorothy entered the Myriad Spirits City?"
<br><br>
"Well, not recently," one of the Guide Weasels replied.
<br><br>
"Should I go to the Origin Mountain and see her?" Zen turned to Elvinia and asked.
<br><br>
When he went back to the Land of Sword Grief, Chaim filled him in on what had happened to the Origin Mountain. This made Zen quite concerned about Dorothy.
<br><br>
"The Origin Mountain is in a state of anxiety right now. I think it won't be wise for you to go there at this moment. Plus, there are so many powerful warriors in the Origin Mountain. I think Dorothy would be safe in their hands." Elvinia tried to comfort him.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Zen nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
Zen exhorted Clyde for a while. He told him that all the resources should be distributed according to Chaim's requirements. However, he instructed that Dorothy must be able to have any resources she needed, including Zen's resources, once she entered the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Zen also left some resources specifically for the Evil God.
<br><br>
Since the Evil God entered the secluded cultivation room, Zen had never disturbed him. He didn't know if the Evil God would be able to leave the Lust World and enter the Desire World in a short time, but he hoped he would have great progress while he was away.
<br><br>
In the outside world, since the Evil God had become Zen's Inner-world Generating Avatar, Zen was able to interfere with the Evil God's actions at any time. However, that wouldn't be the case as he entered the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen would not be able to know what the Evil God was doing, and so he had no choice but to trust him and let him proceed on his own.
<br><br>
In the Lust World, the stages of the Other Shore were interconnected by star rings, and very race had an independent star ring. The same went for the Desire World.
<br><br>
At the north of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, star rings were neatly placed.
<br><br>
Although Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore had always been the home field of the Sun Crow race, the Star Falcon race had failed to occupy the Myriad Spirits City. Thus, the Star Falcon race wasn't able to control the star rings to collect the soul pills, failing the attempt to imitate what the Separate Abyss race did in Stage Eleven of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
As Zen walked towards the star rings, he briefly stopped in his tracks.
<br><br>
"Is there something wrong?" Elvinia asked as she noticed Zen's behavior.
<br><br>
"I just thought of a serious problem." Zen looked at her with a quaint smile.
<br><br>
"I wonder if we can pass it successfully this time,"
<br><br>
As a purified being, Elvinia had gotten into great trouble when she crossed the energy vortex which connected the Lust World and the Desire World.
<br><br>
This also almost caused Zen to die. Though the circumstance later turned to be a blessing in disguise, Zen didn't want such a dangerous thing to happen again.
<br><br>
Theoretically, a purified being shouldn't be able to leave a certain stage of the Other Shore. Otherwise, it would not be appropriate for them to serve as the ruler of that stage.
<br><br>
"We just have to give it a try!"
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't give it too much thought and seemed quite confident instead.
<br><br>
She was a smart and wise woman. In the past, it was impossible for her to act so recklessly in any situation. However, ever since she experienced a few difficult crises with Zen, she developed an attitude of trusting Zen no matter how bad the situation had gotten.
<br><br>
As a result, this hurdle seemed to be nothing for her since she was with Zen.
<br><br>
"Well, yeah, you're right. We'll never know if we don't try. I'll go in first,"
<br><br>
Zen answered, nodding his head.
<br><br>
To be on the safe side, he took the initiative to step into the star ring first.
<br><br>
As the star ring released traces of white light, Zen felt like his body was being disintegrated.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Outside, Elvinia saw that the star ring shot out rays of white light upwards.
<br><br>
A nervous smile crept up at the corners of her mouth. "Everything is fine, isn't it?"
<br><br>
As Zen disappeared, she also stepped into the star ring and flew towards Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Both of them felt relieved as they realized that what they worried about didn't happen. Both Zen and Elvinia smoothly reached Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore. Perhaps it was because they were not Other Shore creatures that the rule preventing the stage ruler from traversing to other stages of the Other Shore didn't take effect.
<br><br>
As soon as they reached the next stage, the anxiousness that they earlier felt dissipated.
<br><br>
As Zen left the star ring, a dark world immediately emerged in front of him.
<br><br>
He perceived that the Dark Region existed in all directions, and felt a strange sensation within him.
<br><br>
"Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore… is a complete Dark Region?" Zen couldn't believe what he saw.
<br><br>
"I've heard a long time ago that Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore had almost been completely eroded by the Dark Region, except for the center area. I didn't expect that the Dark Region was still expanding up until now. It seems that even the center area is being devoured," Elvinia said softly behind Zen, also surprised at the gloomy sight.
<br><br>
The entire Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore, except the area where the star rings were placed, was engulfed by the Dark Region. For ordinary people, there was no value in this and it would just be a waste of time to explore this stage.
<br><br>
Chapter 3588 The Elephant Men Both Zen and Elvinia could freely explore the Dark Region with their abilities.
<br><br>
However, Zen thought constantly about the Other Shore Key for Stage Seventeen. Thus he merely passed through Stage Fifteen and continued his ascent.
<br><br>
The two of them made their way upwards.
<br><br>
They did not stay too long in Stage Sixteen either and journeyed on.
<br><br>
Finally, they arrived in Stage Seventeen and came out on top of a mountain.
<br><br>
After they crossed three stages rapidly, the pressure on the Other Shore increased.
<br><br>
This type of pressure would've been unbearable for others but the two of them managed. Elvinia had previously absorbed enough soul crystal and had already reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. Zen also did not feel anything with his physical body.
<br><br>
"We're at Stage Seventeen. Do we continue to go up?" Elvinia asked him. In front of them lay only endless desert.
<br><br>
The sight of emptiness on top of that huge mountain made Elvinia feel desolate. It would be better to go to the upper stages.
<br><br>
Zen, however, shook his head. "No. We'll stay here."
<br><br>
"Is there anything important here?" she asked, throwing him a strange look.
<br><br>
If it was about Other Shore Tokens, Zen could easily find better ones in the upper stages.
<br><br>
"Yes. Just wait here for me," he told her, not divulging much information on what he was currently planning.
<br><br>
Without a word, Zen withdrew from the Other Shore and activated the Other Shore Key from the Blood-storing Seed. He then began to recite the Sanskrit words deciphered by Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Sand ...bone...separate..."
<br><br>
As he finished reciting the words, Zen reached out and gently pressed the Other Shore Key's lines.
<br><br>
When he returned to the Other Shore, his palm was covered with lustrous map lines.
<br><br>
"An Other Shore Key?" Elvinia muttered, staring at his palm in wonder.
<br><br>
Zen nodded as the map shimmered in his palm.
<br><br>
"Yes."
<br><br>
Despite his confirmation, a trace of doubt remained in Elvinia's eyes.
<br><br>
Other Shore Keys were valuable but why was Zen interested in Stage Seventeen's? If he really wanted one, Elvinia could very well get him one from a higher stage.
<br><br>
Still, Elvinia chose to trust Zen. If he wanted to explore this stage, then they would do so. Maybe there were some secrets in this stage that needed to be uncovered.
<br><br>
Using the map on his palm as reference, Zen commenced with his exploration by first looking around and comparing the terrain.
<br><br>
He frowned. The surrounding terrain didn't seem to match his map.
<br><br>
It was understandable. The Other Shore was vast and Stage Seventeen's geography could be quite complicated. It might take them a lot of effort to find the corresponding terrain.
<br><br>
Their current location was relatively desolate and the star rings were set in the center of the mountain range. A few races resided here but none of them had built anything as big as the Myriad Spirits City or the Sky Water City in Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia thought it best to go down the mountain and head south.
<br><br>
It was a pretty fruitless start. The direction they took had nothing but low and barren mountains for miles.
<br><br>
Zen continued to check the map in his hand but not once did the terrain match up.
<br><br>
The two of them then started to slow down.
<br><br>
They were able to walk a little over 50 miles to the south in a day and a night, but there was still a lot of distance to cover. Stage Seventeen was vast in all directions.
<br><br>
At this rate, it would take Zen a long time to find what he was looking for.
<br><br>
"We can't go on like this. It's a waste of time!" he huffed.
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded. "I agree but if we continue going south, we could stumble upon the Elephant Men's territory and ask them for a map."
<br><br>
Her words implied that she had already known they wouldn't find the temple on their own. Zen remained silent as he ruminated on her suggestion.
<br><br>
This was the first time he looked for a temple with the aid of the map and he didn't have that much experience. He pursed his lips and nodded at Elvinia, giving in to her idea.
<br><br>
After they walked about a hundred miles south, the low mountains gave way to grassland. This grassland area was closed in by huge fences on both sides.
<br><br>
"Why are the fences so high? And the grass is high, too," Zen said. His eyes gleamed with surprise.
<br><br>
The fences that closed off the grassland were ten thousand feet high, way taller than any of the mountains they'd traversed so far.
<br><br>
Not only that, but the grassland itself was incredibly vast and overwhelmingly high. Each blade of grass stood several hundred feet high and swayed like trees in the wind. Zen and Elvinia would be nothing but mere ants once they entered.
<br><br>
Elvinia shook her head. It was obvious that she did her research, but there were just so many weird and unexplainable things that existed on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Let's go inside and have a look then," Zen said.
<br><br>
The two of them had arrived at their destination. They crossed the fences and ventured into the grassland. Only ten miles in did they suddenly hear the loud blowing of a horn.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
As it rang, the ground began to tremble, as if a huge earthquake had just been summoned.
<br><br>
Zen quickly grabbed hold of Elvinia's hand and summoned his thunder wings. He rose into the air and took a quick look at what was happening.
<br><br>
At the height of ten thousand feet, he finally saw what was happening.
<br><br>
Black bulls, twenty to thirty thousand feet tall, were rampaging within the grassland. Behind them was a group of human-shaped creatures that were a little over ten thousand feet tall.
<br><br>
These humanoids were bipedal, gray-skinned and had elephant heads. They were the Elephant Men Elvinia had mentioned earlier! These Elephant Men chased after the bulls, which caused the ground to tremble.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia were like two, pesky mosquitoes compared to these giants.
<br><br>
The black bulls were heading towards the fences. Though tall, there was no way these fences would be able to withstand the impact from these beasts.
<br><br>
However, just as the bulls were about to breach the barriers, one of the Elephant Men raised his horn.
<br><br>
"Woo... Woo..."
<br><br>
Textures appeared on the surfaces of the seemingly ordinary fences at the exact moment the horn was blown.
<br><br>
"Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle..."
<br><br>
Thick lightning gathered on the fences, forming into chains that wrapped around the bulls.
<br><br>
Bound and restrained by the lightning chains, the bulls could only lie helplessly on the ground as their pursuers closed in on them.
<br><br>
"These fences contain such a strong power of lightning," Zen murmured, admiration obvious on his face.
<br><br>
"It's made of lightning wood, which is a relatively rare Other Shore Token,"
<br><br>
Elvinia told him. "I never expected there to be so much in the Elephant Men's territory."
<br><br>
As they marveled at the lightning wood, the two of them failed to notice the huge shadow behind them. A dull and rough voice suddenly boomed, "Chief! Those damned mice have sent their spies again!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3589 Belligerence A giant Elephant Man stood behind Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
He seemed to be angry at their arrival. The moment he finished speaking, a huge hand slapped Zen and Elvinia around their heads.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen turned to protect Elvinia and the slap landed on his body. The two of them crashed to the ground.
<br><br>
The Elephant Man quickly located Zen and Elvinia through the grass, raised one huge foot and stomped hard down on them.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! Dong! The Elephant Man was huge, his explosive power naturally astonishing.
<br><br>
He continued to stomp on them for a while before another Elephant Man stopped him. "Ramsay, you've trampled the spies into meat paste!"
<br><br>
Ramsay snorted and walked towards the black bulls.
<br><br>
It had been several days since the Elephant Men started to chase these bulls.
<br><br>
They finally drove the bulls towards the fences made of lightning wood.
<br><br>
They could easily knock the black bulls down using the lightning contained within the lightning wood. The black bulls could serve as their food for half a month.
<br><br>
Ramsay had just turned when a rumble of thunder sounded across the skies.
<br><br>
The sound wasn't loud, but it was clear and audible.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Ramsay was surprised when a tiny bolt of lightning flashed before his forehead and came to a stop a few feet from him. This mosquito-sized fellow hadn't been crushed into meat paste after all! "Hey, foreign friend!" Zen said, an amused smile playing on his lips.
<br><br>
He hadn't come to the Elephant Men's territory to cause trouble. He had only wanted to know more about Stage Seventeen's terrain. And although Ramsay had thrashed him around like a rag doll, he managed to restrain his anger.
<br><br>
"You are still alive!"
<br><br>
Ramsay had no interest in communicating with Zen. He brought his huge fist smashing down towards Zen's head again.
<br><br>
Ramsay's fist was about eight hundred feet wide and to Zen, it looked like a flying hill was coming for him.
<br><br>
Zen frowned at the sight of the fist and he finally let the anger show on his face.
<br><br>
He knew that if he didn't teach them a lesson, they weren't going to talk nicely.
<br><br>
The moment the fist landed before Zen, he punched into the air. Ramsay's fist was three thousand times bigger than Zen's.
<br><br>
It looked like a man's fist was fighting a flying mosquito.
<br><br>
Ramsay had good eyesight. Even if Zen looked like a tiny speck, he could still clearly see all of Zen's movements.
<br><br>
How could a mosquito fight him? Ramsay sneered.
<br><br>
But the moment he came in contact with Zen, he felt a dull throbbing pain in his fist.
<br><br>
He had been forcefully blocked by a man the size of a tiny mosquito! "This is impossible!"
<br><br>
Ramsay said, his eyes wide in disbelief.
<br><br>
The Elephant Men were large, arrogant, and confident about their own size and strength.
<br><br>
How could Ramsay allow a mere mosquito to block his attack? The muscles in his right arm bulged and his strength continued to explode in an attempt to suppress the mosquito in front of him.
<br><br>
But the tiny mosquito was like a wall that could not be crossed.
<br><br>
All the other Elephant Men had originally headed straight for the black bulls but they turned around at the sounds. They watched Ramsay's movements, confused.
<br><br>
"What's wrong, Ramsay?" asked the chieftain of the Elephant Men.
<br><br>
It was difficult to see Zen from where they were standing.
<br><br>
Ramsay's face turned red with anger. He used up all his strength, gritted his teeth, and said, "This little thing's strength is terrifying!"
<br><br>
As he spoke, he withdrew his fist and sent it flying at Zen again.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Boom! This punch hit the invisible wall as well. The air stirred around them and the tall grass came crashing to the ground. But Zen still managed to stand his ground.
<br><br>
To take the brunt of Ramsay's fist, Zen drew out his force and turned it into a fist that was over a thousand feet tall.
<br><br>
If he had gathered his strength in his body just to take Ramsay's punch, he would probably have drilled into Ramsay's fist like a steel needle.
<br><br>
"I don't believe it!"
<br><br>
Ramsay roared, and his fists lashed out at Zen yet again.
<br><br>
Zen stood upright in the air and raised his hand. Under the spread of the invisible force, the transparent space around him twisted and formed a tall wall of force that blocked Ramsay's attacks.
<br><br>
Zen planned to talk to Ramsay after his power was exhausted.
<br><br>
But at this moment, Elvinia called out, "Zen, watch your back!"
<br><br>
Despite her cautioning, she wasn't really worried about Zen's safety.
<br><br>
The Elephant Men were terrifyingly tall, over ten thousand feet, but they were only creatures from the Light Region of Stage Seventeen. They weren't ridiculously strong and wouldn't be able to do anything to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen had barely turned around when a giant hand grabbed him. An Elephant Man was intending to crush him to death.
<br><br>
As the Elephant Man clenched his fist, he felt like he was holding a hard stone in his hand. How was he supposed to crush it? A thought seemed to occur to him as he tossed Zen aside and pulled out a stone spear from behind him. He raised the spear and swung it towards Zen.
<br><br>
Crack! It was at this moment that Zen's body expanded suddenly.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, his body had grown to become several hundred feet tall.
<br><br>
His body continued to grow rapidly while blocking the stone spear. It had very quickly grown to a height of more than ten thousand feet. He then grabbed the tip of the stone spear with one hand and frowned at the two Elephant Men in front of him.
<br><br>
The Elephant Men that were hunting the black bulls were stunned as they watched Zen's body expand from the size of a mosquito to match their size.
<br><br>
Their huge ears drooped as their jaws dropped in disbelief.
<br><br>
"My friends, you should know that I will give my all if you insist on fighting with me!"
<br><br>
Zen said, pulling the stone spear out of the hands of the Elephant Man. He waved it in the air before crushing it in his hand.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! With a resounding crack, Zen had crushed the stone spear, which was over ten thousand feet long.
<br><br>
The stone spear was sturdy and was made of solid white stones. There weren't many of it in the Elephant Man race.
<br><br>
The Elephant Men gulped in fear at this display of Zen's power.
<br><br>
Their chieftain was quick to react. Realizing that they couldn't afford to offend Zen, he hurriedly stepped forward and said, "Sir, there must be a misunderstanding. Please don't get angry."
<br><br>
Chapter 3590 Cross Reference Zen turned his head to glance coldly at the chieftain of the Elephant Man race. "You changed so quickly. Just now, you were intent on killing me, yet you say this is a 'misunderstanding'?"
<br><br>
The chieftain nervously looked away from Zen. "Ramsay," he hissed, "apologize to him, quickly!"
<br><br>
Ramsay dumbfoundedly looked at Zen, who had suddenly grown as large as a hill. He had never experienced the era of the Wild Gods, so naturally, he didn't know it would take only a split second to enlarge a mosquito to the size as big as himself with a theurgy.
<br><br>
However, Zen's sudden transformation to a giant over ten thousand feet tall was shocking enough. Ramsay was fully convinced. Curling up his long trunk, Ramsay bowed and apologized sincerely.
<br><br>
Zen watched indifferently. Bending down, he reached out and gently scooped Elvinia into his arms. Then, he placed her on his right shoulder carefully.
<br><br>
Although Elvinia had heard of Wild Gods before, she hadn't actually seen Zen use this skill. Thus, she too was stunned at the sudden appearance of a ten thousand-foot tall Zen.
<br><br>
Sitting on Zen's shoulder, she turned to look at his massive head, which was as tall as a building. Dazed, she shook her head, rendered speechless.
<br><br>
Since the misunderstandings had been cleared out, the Elephant Men became polite to Zen.
<br><br>
The other Elephant Men began to deal with the black bulls that were killed by the lightning wood, while the chieftain of the Elephant Man race formally introduced himself to Zen. "I'm the chieftain of the Elephant Man race, Richie. You are not from any Other Shore race, right? However, the woman on your shoulder seems to be a human... "
<br><br>
The Elephant Man race usually isolated themselves, which meant they rarely ever communicated with the outside world. However, as its chieftain, Richie had stayed on Stage Seventeen for a long time; naturally, he knew much more than the ordinary Elephant Men.
<br><br>
Richie had noticed the woman sitting on Zen's shoulder. He could see her features clearly. Almost immediately, he had realized that she was a creature from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"You're right," Zen answered. "She is a human from the Other Shore."
<br><br>
As he spoke, Zen carefully observed the expression on the face of the chieftain.
<br><br>
He firmly believed that there were clues about the human race on Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. The creatures from here might know something about it, so Zen deliberately claimed that Elvinia was a human from the Other Shore and waited to see how the chieftain would react.
<br><br>
However, to his disappointment, there was nothing suspicious in Richie's reaction. He just nodded and asked, "Sir, may I know why you have come here, to our territory?"
<br><br>
"I came here to look for the map of Stage Seventeen. I wonder if you Elephant Man race can offer me one. I can buy it with soul pills or Bodystrengthening Jades," Zen answered truthfully.
<br><br>
Richie, however, was not stupid. The moment Zen mentioned the map, he nodded in understanding. "Sir, are you here for the temple on Stage Seventeen?"
<br><br>
The Other Shore Key had only marked the location of the temple on a map, but there was no clue as to its direction. Zen was hoping to get his hands on another large map to use as a cross reference.
<br><br>
Even though Richie had read his mind, Zen remained calm.
<br><br>
"We don't have the overall map of the whole Stage Seventeen," Richie said quickly. "However, we do have a map of the south part. I'll take you back to our tribe to get it." Richie waved his hand cheerfully. "You don't have to pay for it. We're happy to assist you in any way!"
<br><br>
The chieftain was very generous.
<br><br>
After the Elephant Men turned over the black bulls, they used stone spears to pierce through their necks cleanly, and strung them. Working in pairs, they carried the eight black bulls forward.
<br><br>
Zen followed the team that had had a good harvest and walked south along the middle of the grassland.
<br><br>
The grassland in the south of the Other Shore seemed to be endless. The deeper they trudged into the grassland, the more green they saw in the distance, as though it went on infinitely.
<br><br>
Elvinia sat on Zen's shoulder, taking in the view as though she stood atop a moving mountain. This feeling was strange and novel.
<br><br>
She knew that her father, Fuxi and several other powerful beings could all become very huge, because they had once cultivated the Ancient God Cultivation Method. But to her knowledge, no one else had cultivated such a method afterwards. While she had long since suspected that Zen did not come from this era, the fact that he used the Wild God theurgy further solidified her suspicions.
<br><br>
After traveling through the grassland for half a day, they suddenly saw many low houses dotting the horizon.
<br><br>
Of course, these houses were only small in comparison to the massive Elephant Men. Their height was still more than ten thousand feet, after all, and they looked quite simple and crude.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't known the Elephant Man race for very long, but he was able to draw his own conclusions: the Elephant Man race was probably a native race born on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If the creatures in the chaos had experienced a long-term development, even if they moved to the Other Shore, they would've been able to form a relatively developed civilization.
<br><br>
As for a native race like the Elephant Man race, they didn't have much contact with the outside world. Because they had always lived remotely, they weren't exposed to progress and were naturally still quite primitive.
<br><br>
Therefore, their food, clothing, and weapons were quite simple. They were just impressive in their strength and huge bodies.
<br><br>
The group of Elephant Men led by Richie proudly returned to their tribe with their spoils. A large number of Elephant Men came out of the low houses to welcome them. Zen noticed that most of the Elephant Men that were left in the tribe were the old, the children, the sick, and the weak.
<br><br>
Naturally, they relied on the young and strong to go out and hunt for food.
<br><br>
Many Elephant Men were surprised when they saw Zen. Even the children raced to hide inside their houses, peeking at Zen curiously from the slatted windows.
<br><br>
"Sir, please follow me," Richie said. "I'll take you to fetch the map."
<br><br>
Following closely behind Richie, Zen arrived at a house that sat in the center of the tribe. Although it was still modest, it was larger in scale compared to the other houses.
<br><br>
Upon entering the house, Zen saw an Elephant Man sitting cross-legged in the middle of the house. His body was covered in brightly colored paint, forming intricate patterns on his skin. The paint was evenly applied across his body and one could not even tell the original color of his skin.
<br><br>
"This is our high priest Murkub." Richie gestured towards the painted Elephant Man.
<br><br>
Obviously, the position of the high priest was even higher than that of the chieftain. Richie bowed deeply to the painted Elephant Man. "High priest, this is our friend from another race. He wants to see the map of the south."
<br><br>
Murkub looked at Zen up and down a few times. Because he had managed the affairs of the tribe with Richie since time immemorial, Murkub trusted Richie's judgment.
<br><br>
Without uttering a word, the high priest nodded and proceeded to take out a board from a wooden box, no questions asked.
<br><br>
Turning the board over, Zen saw it was an intricately carved map. Murkub then retreated to the side of the house to continue meditating.
<br><br>
"This is the south part of Stage Seventeen, and we are here." Richie pointed at a location on the map, which was the center of the grassland.
<br><br>
Zen studied the map closely. He realized that more than half of the grassland was barricaded by fences made from lightning wood. 'It must not have been easy to build these fences, ' he pondered quietly.
<br><br>
It was unknown if they were built by the human race or by other creatures.
<br><br>
Every stage had its own secrets. Even though Zen was very curious about the fence, he decided against asking the chieftain about it, since it was their business. Instead, he focused on his goal to find the location of the temple.
<br><br>
With a flick of his hand, the map that was reflected by the Other Shore Key came into view. Zen proceeded to look for the temple on the map carved on the board while cross referencing with the map from the Other Shore Key.
<br><br>
Chapter 3591 A Dangerous Place He studied the two maps carefully, cross-checking each area, one by one.
<br><br>
The terrain of the grassland area in the south was relatively straightforward, so Zen didn't pay much attention to it. The key was to compare the four corners on the board with the map in his palm.
<br><br>
About five minutes later, Zen had finished comparing the two maps. His originally relaxed eyebrows were now furrowed tightly. His target was not on this map.
<br><br>
Noticing Zen's expression, Chieftain Richie asked, "You didn't find it, did you?"
<br><br>
This map only portrayed the south region of Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore, so it wouldn't have been surprising if Zen couldn't find what he was looking for. Zen nodded with a sigh. He had no choice but to look for it elsewhere.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to bid Richie farewell, Elvinia piped up excitedly from his shoulder, "Wait a minute, Zen! Look at the rightmost area of the map."
<br><br>
Zen frowned slightly, as though he didn't understand her. Then, it dawned on Elvinia that he couldn't hear her due to their massive difference in body size. Channeling her strength into her voice, she repeated it again loudly.
<br><br>
Finally understanding what Elvinia was saying, Zen turned to look at where she was pointing.
<br><br>
On the rightmost side of the map, the grassland area suddenly stopped and was replaced by what seemed to be a desert. On the carved map provided by the Elephant Man race, it was carved vaguely, which was why Zen hadn't noticed it before.
<br><br>
But even so, the junction of the grassland and the desert formed a triplegourd shaped area.
<br><br>
"Now look at the left side of the map on your palm. Is there a wavy line?"
<br><br>
Elvinia continued excitedly.
<br><br>
When Zen looked at the map formed by the Other Shore Key on his palm, his eyes lit up. This wavy line was just enough to match the lower part of the triple-gourd! He even pressed his palm down and observed the two maps more carefully.
<br><br>
The more he studied it, the more he felt they were a match.
<br><br>
"Thanks for your careful observation, Elvinia," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
"Certainly." Elvinia smiled back sweetly.
<br><br>
Then, Zen turned to face the chieftain. Richie looked back at him uneasily.
<br><br>
Pointing his finger on the map, Zen asked, "Chieftain Richie, I think this area goes beyond the territory of the Elephant Man race. Do you know where this is?"
<br><br>
"That place..." said Richie hesitantly.
<br><br>
Zen studied Richie curiously. Was this place special? At this moment, the high priest suddenly cut in. "Humans, I advise you to give up your plans of going there. That's not a place you can set foot on."
<br><br>
"Why not?"
<br><br>
Of course, Zen wouldn't back down just because some priest was warning him.
<br><br>
"It's very dangerous there—very! No one is more powerful than the ruler of Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. However, even three of them lost their lives there, one after another," the high priest blurted out.
<br><br>
Zen knitted his brows, slightly surprised at the high priest's sudden outburst.
<br><br>
Elvinia, who had been listening too, frowned deeply.
<br><br>
With the strength of the purified being, they had gone through the Other Shore very easily. This place didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.
<br><br>
It never would've crossed their minds that it was so dangerous that three purified beings had died there.
<br><br>
"The stage rulers died there? And as many as three? How was that possible?" Zen asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Young people tend to forget about this history, but it has been seared into the memories of us older ones," the high priest said in a hazy tone. "Back then, they had fought fiercely for years in Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore, just so they could earn the title of stage ruler. No matter which side won, they would immediately head there as soon as possible."
<br><br>
Pointing at the rightmost area of the map, the high priest continued, "They did all that just to reach that place. However, it was just far too dangerous.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, even the stage rulers were not able to enter that place and make it out alive!"
<br><br>
"Who were they?" Zen narrowed his eyes.
<br><br>
"I don't know," the high priest answered, shaking his head. "At that time, I was just a child. Our Elephant Man race often suffered unexpected disasters. It was not until they had failed three times did they finally choose to give up. Since then, our race has begun to live a peaceful life..."
<br><br>
The high priest's tone turned bitter at the memory.
<br><br>
"But according to your story, there were more than just one force?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, there were at least three forces," the high priest replied.
<br><br>
If these forces were able to compete with each other directly for the position of stage ruler, they must have been among the top civilizations on the whole Other Shore.
<br><br>
The one-eyed monsters and the black monkeys instantly came to his mind when Zen realized this. In addition, the three-eyed boy in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore must have come from another force. Could it be-- were these the three forces the high priest was talking about? "So you'd better not go there. Otherwise, you will die," the high priest warned ominously.
<br><br>
Although he hadn't seen Zen's fighting skills with his own eyes yet, he knew that Zen was by no means an ordinary person. But no matter how powerful he was, there was no way he could survive. The high priest didn't think he could be stronger than those stage rulers.
<br><br>
"Thank you for the warning. If it truly is too dangerous, then it's not worth taking the risk." Zen cupped his hands and bowed respectfully towards the high priest.
<br><br>
Elvinia, who had been sitting on Zen's shoulder this whole time, glanced at him confusedly.
<br><br>
The Zen she knew wouldn't have shrunk back from the face of difficulty.
<br><br>
After that, Zen bade them goodbye, despite Richie inviting them to stay.
<br><br>
Together with Elvinia, Zen headed out into the grassland once more.
<br><br>
Not long after leaving the Elephant Man race's settlement, Zen's body began to shrink rapidly. .
<br><br>
He grabbed Elvinia, and they fell onto a blade of grass like two raindrops.
<br><br>
"Are you really leaving?" Elvinia asked with hands on her hips. She eyed Zen suspiciously.
<br><br>
"Of course not." Zen shook his head, his eyes twinkling mischievously.
<br><br>
"But it seemed like the Elephant Man race didn't want us to go there."
<br><br>
"And so? Are they qualified to stop us?" Elvinia said haughtily.
<br><br>
Even though she was tiny compared to an Elephant Man, she was confident she would be able to kill them all.
<br><br>
"Of course they can't stop us," Zen smiled gently. "But I suspect that the Elephant Man race is related to those great civilizations, which means, the Elephant Men might have been left here on purpose by the other civilizations, in order to keep watch."
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had suspected that the fences were not built by the Elephant Man race. Now, it seemed that the purpose of building those fences was probably to divide the territory and to confine the Elephant Man race to the grassland.
<br><br>
"That's just your speculation," spat Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Whether I'm right or wrong, we'd better go to that place after bypassing the Elephant Man race. It will be much safer that way."
<br><br>
"You're right..."
<br><br>
After the conversation, they started to head north, straight towards the area marked on the map.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the house that stood in the center of the Elephant Men's settlement, the high priest suddenly bolted upright, "Richie, hurry! Take down the Heavenly Spirit Bead!"
<br><br>
Richie trembled slightly at the high priest's sudden request.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Spirit Bead was a sacred treasure of the Elephant Man race.
<br><br>
It had always been placed on the top of the totem pole, where it was worshiped by all the members of the race.
<br><br>
The bead had been sitting on the top of the totem pole since time immemorial. It had played an important role in providing the Elephant Man race with power.
<br><br>
No one was allowed to touch this sacred treasure, not even the high priest himself. Yet now, the high priest was demanding he take it down right this instant! To his horror, Richie suddenly realized that the situation must have been much more grave than he could possibly imagine.
<br><br>
Chapter 3592 Transmission In the Elephant Man race, no one knew the origin of the Heavenly Spirit Bead, except for the high priest.
<br><br>
As for the actual use of the Heavenly Spirit Bead, no one knew either.
<br><br>
But since the high priest had given the order, Richie didn't dare refuse.
<br><br>
Stepping outside, he headed straight for the totem pole and began to climb it.
<br><br>
"Chief..."
<br><br>
"You...!"
<br><br>
"That's our sacred treasure! How dare you!"
<br><br>
The other Elephant Men had come out of their homes to see what their chieftain was doing. To their horror, they saw he was headed straight for their treasured Heavenly Spirit Bead.
<br><br>
"It's our mission to take down the sacred treasure," the high priest suddenly said, emerging from the massive house.
<br><br>
In the Elephant Man race, the word of the high priest was considered the law. Most of the time, however, the high priest left the chieftain to manage everything.
<br><br>
"Why?" an Elephant Man asked innocently.
<br><br>
"Because the reason why the sacred treasure stays here," the high priest said seriously, "is to wait for some creatures to arrive. And now... They have arrived."
<br><br>
"Your Holiness, are you referring to those two humans?" another Elephant Man asked.
<br><br>
The high priest nodded.
<br><br>
The high priest had been very clear since the beginning that the Elephant Man race was insignificant. They had but one mission, and before it was completed, they might have had some reason to exist.
<br><br>
However, upon completion of this mission, they would become dispensable.
<br><br>
The outcome could be imagined, but that didn't matter; they only knew they needed to obey.
<br><br>
Once the chieftain handed over the Heavenly Spirit Bead, Murkub set it on the ground.
<br><br>
The Elephant Men stared at the Heavenly Spirit Bead, eyes gleaming. Only the high priest could activate the power of the Heavenly Spirit Bead.
<br><br>
Everyone wondered what was going to happen.
<br><br>
Just as everyone was guessing what sort of power the high priest was going to unleash, Murkub suddenly grabbed the stone spear that was strapped to Richie's back.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In the blink of an eye, he had swung the stone spearhead onto the Heavenly Spirit Bead.
<br><br>
"Ah!"
<br><br>
"Your Holiness!"
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
At this moment, even Richie was stunned, but he dared not stop him. He could do nothing but watch as Murkub slammed the spear onto their treasured bead.
<br><br>
Bang! Finally, the Heavenly Spirit Bead shattered into transparent white shards.
<br><br>
All the Elephant Men stared at the remnants in absolute shock. Was the high priest crazy? Just as panic began to well within their hearts, the white fragments scattered on the ground suddenly started to tremble.
<br><br>
These white fragments might've been very small compared to the Elephant Man race, but the Heavenly Spirit Bead itself was around 700 to 800 feet in diameter. Each fragment was around the size of an ordinary human's fist.
<br><br>
As the white fragments continued to move, they gradually began to form a circular array. Then, all the white fragments released powerful energy, activating a unique array! Whoosh! A white light shot straight into the sky from the grassland.
<br><br>
Not far from the Elephant Men's settlement, Zen and Elvinia had been trudging through the grassland. To their surprise, they suddenly saw a white beam of light in the distance.
<br><br>
"It's from the territory of the Elephant Man race," said Elvinia seriously.
<br><br>
"It doesn't seem like someone is ascending." Zen pursed his lips.
<br><br>
The white light that went up was somewhat similar to the star ring. It hadn't been long since they had left the Elephant Men's settlement. This couldn't be a coincidence.
<br><br>
"It's probably because of the Other Shore Key in your hands," Elvinia surmised.
<br><br>
According to the Elephant Man race, the dangerous place at the edge of the grassland was no secret. At least those great forces knew the existence of this place. It was just that they couldn't do anything about it.
<br><br>
"Most likely." Zen looked at the white light expressionlessly, and the light gradually dissipated and disappeared from his sight. "We have to hurry..."
<br><br>
Crack! Without hesitation, his thunder wings roared to life. Wrapping his arm around Elvinia's waist, together they flew across the vast grassland like lightning.
<br><br>
The white light continued to rise until it reached Stage Eighteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
On the top of a high mountain of Stage Eighteen, there was a small magic array. The moment the white light entered Stage Eighteen, this array also released a white light, which shot towards Stage Nineteen.
<br><br>
In turn, in a valley of Stage Nineteen, a small array was activated.
<br><br>
Stage Twenty...
<br><br>
Stage Twenty-one...
<br><br>
Stage Twenty-two...
<br><br>
Stage Thirty...
<br><br>
Stage Thirty-one...
<br><br>
Stage Thirty-two! Inside a huge hall, there was a massive metal array.
<br><br>
The metal array rotated continuously. As all kinds of patterns intertwined, a terrifying energy surged within it.
<br><br>
Crack! When the white light entered Stage Thirty, the metal array trembled violently.
<br><br>
"Hmm?"
<br><br>
A little ball of light made a strange sound.
<br><br>
Inside the ball, there was a blue wave of water light. The water light condensed and formed intricate ice crystals.
<br><br>
It was a member of the Element Spirit race, and just so happened to be the weakest water spirit in this race. That was why it was sent here, to guard the metal array.
<br><br>
'The array of Stage Seventeen has been activated? What happened on Stage Seventeen?' the water spirit pondered.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the members of the Element Spirit race would only pay attention to Stage Twenty-nine and above. There was nothing worth their attention below Stage Twenty-nine.
<br><br>
A few days ago, there was news that there were purified beings within Stage Fourteen, and the two purified beings were of the human race.
<br><br>
Even so, the Element Spirit race only issued an imperial edict to let those humble black monkeys take action. The Element Spirit race did not take any further action, because they had deemed it unnecessary.
<br><br>
However, that happened not too long ago. Now, their guards in Stage Seventeen had activated the magic array. Naturally, the water spirit was curious.
<br><br>
Stage Seventeen...
<br><br>
'Could it be because of that dangerous place?' The blue light suddenly spread out from the body of the water spirit.
<br><br>
This flashing blue light served as a signal, telling its companions that it had some news.
<br><br>
The members of the Element Spirit race had the ability to fuse with each other. The moment they called out to their companions, their voices would automatically adjust to be heard.
<br><br>
Therefore, in an instant, all the members of the Element Spirit race who could respond to the water spirit gathered in its body.
<br><br>
Within the little orb of light, dazzling golden lights and blazing flames appeared.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?"
<br><br>
"This seems to be news coming from a low stage..."
<br><br>
"Humph! It's only Stage Seventeen. Did you really need to call everyone here?"
<br><br>
Naturally, the other members of the Element Spirit race grew impatient.
<br><br>
The water spirit didn't say anything. It let the metal array speak for itself.
<br><br>
As the metal array continued to rotate, a blurry picture appeared in front of everyone. In the picture, it was the high priest of the Elephant Man race, Murkub.
<br><br>
The transmission of information was very complicated on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Even the Element Spirit race who had a thorough understanding of the Other Shore could only pass through the transmission stage by stage.
<br><br>
After having to go through so many stages, it was already amazing in itself that the array was able to show the picture of the Elephant Man.
<br><br>
Chapter 3593 Descend At that moment, Murkub couldn't see what was happening on the other side.
<br><br>
What he saw was only a blurry white light ball that appeared above the array He clearly knew that the white light ball represented that certain powerful race.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the reason the Elephant Man race had survived on Stage Seventeen until now was also because of that powerful race.
<br><br>
It could be said that the light ball was like God who had saved the Elephant Man race.
<br><br>
After a few moments, Murkub gestured and signaled all the Elephant Men to kneel down.
<br><br>
In turn, all of them including Richie, knelt on the ground and devoutly bowed to the white light ball.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the water spirit, or the gathering of the many Element Spirits that were on Stage Thirty-two watched the scene rather impatiently.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race were known for being the purest creatures, as all of them were made up of the most basic elements.
<br><br>
For them, all living creatures with flesh and blood were filthy and impure! Of course, the Elephant Man race were no exception.
<br><br>
"What's the matter?" the water spirit asked. Although the water spirit had convened its companions, it was still the owner of the body where everyone was gathered.
<br><br>
Thus, out of politeness, it should be the one to speak first.
<br><br>
"I saw the Other Shore Key! It's the one to this place!" Murkub exclaimed.
<br><br>
He placed the board in a vertical position and pointed to the right side of it, which was the area shaped like a triple-gourd.
<br><br>
As soon as Murkub finished speaking, the consciousnesses inside the body of the water spirit began to fluctuate.
<br><br>
"Is it the temple in the past?"
<br><br>
"Has the key to the temple finally appeared?"
<br><br>
"We had tried every way we had to enter it at that time--but those forces had fought for so many years, and no one ever succeeded in the end!"
<br><br>
"Indeed... and now, we finally got this great opportunity!"
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race quietly communicated with each other immediately through their consciousness. In just about three seconds, they had already talked about the past of Stage Seventeen.
<br><br>
Back then, the Element Spirit race, along with two other forces, had all obtained the position of the ruler of Stage Seventeen. At that time, the Element Spirit race had also thought that only they could dig out the thing in that dangerous place, but in the end they just failed.
<br><br>
However, the failure of the other two forces made the Element Spirit race feel relieved, so the exploration of the dangerous place in Stage Seventeen was then put aside.
<br><br>
The only reason the Element Spirit race had casually supported the Elephant Man race on Stage Seventeen was so the latter could work for them.
<br><br>
If ever the Other Shore Key appeared one day, they would naturally know at the first time.
<br><br>
Truth be told, the Element Spirit race didn't have much hope that the Elephant Man race would discover anything. They even almost forgot about the Elephant Man race for a long time, until their race's high priest, Murkub, had crushed the Heavenly Spirit Bead. "What should we do? Let those monkeys think of a solution?" a fire spirit asked.
<br><br>
"Humph! Those monkeys can only hide in the darkness. What's their use anyway? They had screwed things up on Stage Fourteen not long ago. They couldn't do anything right!" a metal spirit complained.
<br><br>
"The key point is that the monkeys are not strong enough, and the purified being of Stage Seventeen is not under our control. I'm afraid we can only let the Moon Fire Slaves go down there..." the water spirit suggested.
<br><br>
There were no doubts about the strength of the Moon Fire Slaves, but if they directly went down from Stage Thirty-two, then there would be a great price to pay. Furthermore, the strength of the Moon Fire Slaves would also be greatly reduced.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves normally did not appear in areas lower than Stage Thirty, but such an opportunity was rare and hard to get--which was why the Element Spirit race found it worthy of their great attention.
<br><br>
When the other members of the Element Spirit race hesitated, a fire spirit asked, "Which race does the creature who holds the Other Shore Key belong to?"
<br><br>
Murkub, who stayed in the metal array while he waited for the light ball's orders, had heard the light ball's question and answered honestly, "Humans, two of them to be exact. There is one of them whose face I couldn't see clearly, but he can be as tall as us when his Wild God body is activated..."
<br><br>
The news about what Zen and Elvinia did on Stage Fourteen had spread widely. The Element Spirit race also knew about it, but they did not pay much attention.
<br><br>
As soon as Murkub finished speaking, the Element Spirits immediately understood what had happened.
<br><br>
It turned out that the human who had occupied Stage Fourteen had now stepped into Stage Seventeen.
<br><br>
Moreover, this human happened to have the Other Shore Key. They knew that it was not a coincidence! "Make the Moon Fire Slaves descend!"
<br><br>
"I agree!"
<br><br>
"I agree!"
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Not long after, the door of the hall opened from the middle.
<br><br>
Three huge Moon Fire Slaves walked forward, and the entire hall trembled slightly with their footsteps.
<br><br>
Green flames spread from their necks, waists, and ribs, and the fierce and tyrannical aura they emitted was very palpable.
<br><br>
As soon as the three Moon Fire Slaves stood in the center of the metal array, the metal array began to rotate again.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As the metal array spun wildly, they turned into a white ray of light and eventually flew straight towards Stage Thirty-one. There were traces of dark green flames that were visible in the white light.
<br><br>
Some powerful creatures that lived on Stage Thirty-one and Thirty-two saw the dark green flames and immediately knew what the Element Spirit race were doing. They were bringing karma fire and calamity to a lower stage again.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Moon Fire Slaves descended all the way to Stage Thirty-one.
<br><br>
Stage Thirty...
<br><br>
Stage Twenty-nine...
<br><br>
Stage Eighteen...
<br><br>
Until they finally reached Stage Seventeen! While all of those were happening, the Elephant Men were still on their knees.
<br><br>
To the ignorant and backward Elephant Man race, that ball of white light was the manifestation of God. As long as it was there, they did not dare to leave without permission.
<br><br>
Most of the Elephant Men deeply revered and were highly devoted to the God. They thought that since the God had manifested himself, then would the God bless them with graces? As they hoped and waited, a white and green beam of light was cast down.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"
<br><br>
The second the white and green light shone down, it destroyed the entire array into pieces. The damage in the center of the array left a crater with a diameter of five thousand feet! If it had been in a normal world of humans, that crater would be unimaginably huge.
<br><br>
However, the Elephant Man race were all over ten thousand feet tall. Thus, the huge crater was only the same size as the water tanks they used.
<br><br>
Just then, three huge Moon Fire Slaves slowly crawled out of it.
<br><br>
Once they had fully gotten out and saw the Elephant Men who were much bigger than them, they were rendered speechless.
<br><br>
It was true that they had a towering height of about three hundred feet, but they were nothing compared to the Elephant Men who were over ten thousand feet tall.
<br><br>
"Well, the repressive force of Stage Seventeen hasn't come yet," said one of the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
"How should we deal with these Elephant Men?"
<br><br>
"How? They might already be dead..."
<br><br>
When Stage Seventeen did not suppress the power of the Moon Fire Slaves, they were as strong as they had been on Stage Thirty-two. In fact, the shock waves of the flames their bodies released were enough to burn everything on Stage Seventeen.
<br><br>
As for Richie, Murkub, and the Elephant Men who stood closest to the Moon Fire Slaves, they were oblivious to what had happened. They only felt that a heatwave had washed over them, until they completely lost consciousness and their bodies had turned into coke.
<br><br>
Chapter 3594 Arrival The Elephant Men who were a bit far away from the Moon Fire Slaves were shocked by what they saw.
<br><br>
The scorching hot aura had spread towards them, forcing them to retreat.
<br><br>
"Chieftain..."
<br><br>
"High priest..."
<br><br>
the Elephant Men murmured as they retreated.
<br><br>
They didn't understand why these things that had come down would kill the high priest.
<br><br>
Didn't they appear because they felt their piety? But why would they kill the devout believers? "No. 12, what should we do with these Elephant Men?" asked one of the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves didn't have their own names.
<br><br>
In fact, it was not only them, but most of the members of the Element Spirit race that didn't have names.
<br><br>
A name was a noble symbol in the Element Spirit race. It represented a distinct individual and ordinary creatures were not qualified to have one.
<br><br>
The names of the Moon Fire Slaves were a series of numbers. The closer the numbers were to number one, the stronger they were.
<br><br>
The names of the three were No. 12, No. 13 and No. 14. They were incredibly powerful among the Moon Fire Slaves and No. 12 was the strongest among them. Naturally, he was the leader of the three.
<br><br>
"They are useless. Get rid of them," No. 12 replied indifferently.
<br><br>
No. 13 took a slow step forward and lightly pressed his foot to the ground.
<br><br>
As he did, a ball of green flame spread from beneath his foot throughout the entire village.
<br><br>
Some Elephant Men realized something was terribly wrong and rushed to escape the village.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong...
<br><br>
A chaotic rumble of footsteps sounded from the tribe as they rushed out, but no matter how fast they were, escaping the spreading green flames was impossible.
<br><br>
The village continued to burn and the sprinting Elephant Men were turned to huge balls of fire. The low buildings, grass, totems, everything the tribe owned, were ignited and engulfed in dark green flames.
<br><br>
As the Elephant Men were burned, three small balls appeared above the heads of the three Moon Fire Slaves and moved into their bodies, quickly suppressing their amazing strength. This suppressive force came from Stage Seventeen, and it was almost impossible to resist.
<br><br>
The strength being pushed down was followed by great pain. They struggled but eventually managed to adapt to it.
<br><br>
"I heard those two are purified beings. Their strength can't be underestimated," said No. 14 worriedly.
<br><br>
When one's strength was suppressed, their confidence often went with it.
<br><br>
"If they are really purified beings capable of crossing the stages of the Other Shore, that would be troublesome to deal with," No. 13 agreed.
<br><br>
"Before, that was true, but now it may not be that difficult," No. 12 replied menacingly.
<br><br>
No. 13 and No. 14 remained silent.
<br><br>
The suppressive force of the Other Shore was impossible to overcome. This was a known fact set in stone.
<br><br>
Until now. The Element Spirit race had found a way to avoid it, and all it would cost was their lives.
<br><br>
No. 12 might have only been a little stronger than the other two, but he was the leader here. If someone needed to be sacrificed to remove the suppression, it would have to be either No. 13 or No.14.
<br><br>
"Let's go. Hopefully we'll be a step ahead of them and reach the dangerous region first," No. 12 ordered, not caring what the others thought. All he needed was to complete the task assigned by the Element Spirits.
<br><br>
A gust of wind swept by, causing the several hundred feet high grass of the grassland to bend and sway like a field of rolling green waves.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia were still moving through the north of the grassland, unaware of what had happened to the tribe of the Elephant Men.
<br><br>
If this grassland were not so huge and vast, Zen would have sped through terrifyingly quick. But here, the lightning he had turned into was but a tiny needle...
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
Suddenly, behind Zen, buzzing sounds could be heard. A few giant bees the size of houses flapped their translucent wings as they swiftly chased after Zen.
<br><br>
"Three more bees have come..."
<br><br>
Zen narrowed his eyes and warned Elvinia, "Get ready!"
<br><br>
He then threw Elvinia high into the air. As she flew, his body began expanding and became ten thousand feet high in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Now a giant, Zen swung his palms and slapped down hard, smashing the three giant bees into pieces.
<br><br>
The moment they were crushed, Zen turned and shrunk down to his regular size, catching Elvinia as she fell back down and continued on his way forward.
<br><br>
It was hard to tell how many times they had come across these giant bees on their way. Although they were both capable of killing the bees, capturing and killing them would take a lot more effort than if Zen transformed into a Wild God.
<br><br>
After only two encounters, Zen had devised this simplest plan to deal with them—slap them to death the way he would kill a fly.
<br><br>
A few rounds of this and Zen was already very skilled at it, effortlessly sending them to a quick death.
<br><br>
Half a day later, giant wood fences appeared before them. These fences marked the edge of the grassland.
<br><br>
"We have arrived at the edge of the grassland," said Elvinia.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in acknowledgment and made his way through the fences.
<br><br>
It seemed that only the grassland in the south of Stage Seventeen was filled with giant creatures. Everything went back to normal once they crossed to other side of the fences.
<br><br>
However, there was a cyan gray gobi adjacent to the grassland, and farther away from the gobi was a vast desert.
<br><br>
According to the map, once they crossed the grassland they should walk along the gobi.
<br><br>
After confirming their direction, Zen and Elvinia continued on, following the map.
<br><br>
They had only gone a short distance, when in the corner of the gobi, the heads of several mice stuck out of many little caves.
<br><br>
"Squeak! There are outsiders coming this way again!"
<br><br>
"Their objective seems clear, they should be heading for the dangerous place!"
<br><br>
"If they wish to die, there is no need to stop them. They can't even survive meeting the lamps. They will die for sure. Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
"Squeak! No one has visited the dangerous place for many years. We'd better be careful. We have to inform the others..."
<br><br>
The mice quickly ducked back into their caves.
<br><br>
After walking down more than two hundred miles, Zen and Elvinia finally caught sight of the end of the gobi. They could now see the desert and the grassland intertwined in the distance, the two areas forming a circle.
<br><br>
"Here it is..."
<br><br>
Zen opened his palm, stared at the map presented by the Other Shore Key, and said, "This circle should be the bottom part of the gourd-shaped area!"
<br><br>
Finally finding the destination marked by the Other Shore Key had Zen brimming with excitement. After observing and taking it all in for a moment, he and Elvinia then flew towards the desert.
<br><br>
Chapter 3595 Black Lamps As he hovered in the sky above the desert, Zen looked around but still failed to find anything special.
<br><br>
He flew past the circular desert bordered by grassland without stopping.
<br><br>
Soon, he came across another similarly shaped terrain.
<br><br>
This time, the circular area was the grassland being surrounded by a desert.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, Zen flew past it as well and arrived at the end of a third circle.
<br><br>
"I bet the temple must be around here!" Zen exclaimed.
<br><br>
After going over the area, he was certain they were on the right track.
<br><br>
Elvinia gave her surroundings a confused look. "Why would a temple be located here? There's nothing but sand for miles," she complained.
<br><br>
The third circular piece of land was a vast expanse of flat gobi, including the end of it. If the temple was here, they should've been able to spot it by now.
<br><br>
Once they landed, Elvinia lowered her head to carefully tread across the ground they stood.
<br><br>
"Huh?"
<br><br>
Her eyes suddenly lit up in surprise. She pointed to the ground and yelled, "Zen! Come and have a look!"
<br><br>
Directly beneath her feet was the long outline of what remained of some sort of foundation. Most of it was buried underground.
<br><br>
Zen walked up and down the foundation's remains, tediously observing it alongside Elvinia.
<br><br>
An idea suddenly popped up in his mind. Swiftly, he flew towards the sky and hovered before looking down and narrowing his eyes.
<br><br>
As expected, everything was much clearer from a bird's eye view.
<br><br>
He hadn't paid any attention to the ground upon arriving.
<br><br>
But now seeing it from up here, he could clearly see the frame of a huge temple beneath him! "Do you see anything?" Elvinia bellowed from below.
<br><br>
Zen nodded as he made his slow descent from the sky. "Yes. The foundation of the temple is buried underneath the gobi," he replied.
<br><br>
"Then that means… the temple we've been searching for is right beneath our feet?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
"It's possible." Suddenly, Zen shook his head from left to right as he recalled something. "However, something's still off here. This is the temple's foundation. If we can see it from here, then that means the temple is erected at this spot and that we should've been inside its walls by now,"
<br><br>
Zen raised his hand to point at their surroundings.
<br><br>
"So you're saying we're already inside the temple?" Elvinia asked again, the doubt still all over her face.
<br><br>
"Well, there's one way to confirm that. We won't be able to leave the Other Shore if we're right inside a temple, so let's give this one a try." Once Zen finished speaking, he began chanting the Illusion Breaking Rune.
<br><br>
Normally, using the rune would've returned him to his cultivation room in the Source World. But that didn't happen this time. Instead, he remained on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Elvinia's curiosity grew as she witnessed this. She began to follow suit, chanting her own Illusion Breaking Rune. But her Soul of Light, just like Zen, was unable to escape the Other Shore too. Could this mean they were both trapped within the confines of an invisible temple? "What a strange place this is,"
<br><br>
she commented, the fear making her voice tremble ever so slightly. She walked along the temple's foundation and left the temple's confines before giving it another shot.
<br><br>
This time, as soon as she finished chanting the Illusion Breaking Rune, her body of the purified being closed her eyes and knelt down on the ground, motionless. It was obvious that her Soul of Light had left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before her body began to regain consciousness as her soul returned. As she sat on the ground with an astonished look, she looked up into Zen's eyes. His suspicions were right all along.
<br><br>
"Zen, what's going on?" she asked him.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head and said with a frown. "Maybe we entered the temple in a wrong way, and thus we can't see it even if we are inside it."
<br><br>
"But how are we supposed to enter it? We can't even find a proper keyhole for the Other Shore Key," Elvinia reminded him.
<br><br>
If they could use the Other Shore Key, the temple would probably appear clearly in their vision. But now all they could see was miles and miles of barren gobi surrounding them. Where could they find the keyhole? Zen wandered around as he examined every inch of earth. However, no clues could be found.
<br><br>
He raised his palm to check the map on it. Although he had deeply carved the map into his mind, he had made a new discovery after a careful observation.
<br><br>
Normally, the temple was marked at the center of a map.
<br><br>
But on this map, the temple was located somewhere on the lower portion.
<br><br>
Instead, it was the three circular regions Zen had passed over that were in the map's center.
<br><br>
Zen's intuition told him that there might be a hidden meaning to those three circular regions.
<br><br>
"Come with me!"
<br><br>
Zen stepped forward and grabbed Elvinia's hand. They soared high into the sky, once more.
<br><br>
"What did you find?" She asked him curiously.
<br><br>
"The temple is here. I'm sure of it! It's just that we entered it the wrong way," Zen explained.
<br><br>
"Then how do we correctly enter the temple?" Elvinia asked, confused.
<br><br>
Zen didn't answer. He brought her back to the edge of the first circular region they had passed earlier.
<br><br>
On the map, he discovered a small opening in the north of the circle. As they landed by the opening, they entered the circular region by walking from north to south along the edge of the desert.
<br><br>
As soon as they set foot on the sand, the scenery around them changed dramatically.
<br><br>
Numerous lamp stands rose out of the scorching desert sand one at a time — the tips of their wicks burning with black flames.
<br><br>
The other ends of the extremely long wicks extended to the ground, with shadows bound to them. The shadows were in various shapes. There were shadows of humans, beasts, monsters and so on.
<br><br>
A few shadows sat still on the ground while others struggled in desperation around the lamp stands they were attached to which left circular trails on the sand.
<br><br>
As an ominous aura emanated from them, Elvinia felt a chill running up and down her spine. Frowning, she asked, "What…what the hell is this place?"
<br><br>
"The only way to the temple entrance," Zen replied calmly, his voice free of any fear.
<br><br>
The high priest from the Elephant Man race had warned them of the dangers this place held.
<br><br>
In fact, three purified beings that possessed great power had met their end here. Zen never expected them to enter this place easily.
<br><br>
"Wait here. I'll go have a look first," Zen ordered her.
<br><br>
The lamp stands were arranged in such a way that they were at equal distances apart from each other. All lamps had wicks long enough for the shadows to move in a hundred-foot radius around the stands — leaving no space to go around the shadows.
<br><br>
Realizing that there was no shortcut, Zen had no choice but to break through the terrifying path before him.
<br><br>
He slowly approached the nearest lamp stand to which the shadow of a dog was tied. It dozed off, snoring and lying motionless on the ground.
<br><br>
Once Zen entered the area bathed in lamplight, however, the dog woke up and immediately pounced on him ferociously.
<br><br>
Zen subconsciously dodged to the side, but the shadow's speed was surprisingly fast.
<br><br>
Realizing he couldn't avoid the attack, Zen outstretched his hand to defend himself. The dog bit deep into his arm.
<br><br>
However, something odd happened. Zen didn't feel the slightest bit of pain from its teeth. His Chaotic Source Spirits received no damage. As it turned out, the shadow was just like a ghost that could easily pass through his body. All that it left was a vague bite mark on his arm.
<br><br>
Chapter 3596 The Hidden Spirit Lamp And The Hidden Beast Suspicion grew within Zen as he stood still, analyzing the bite mark on his arm.
<br><br>
It wasn't painful or itchy. It just looked like a harmless gray tattoo.
<br><br>
The dog landed and almost immediately rushed at him again with blinding speed.
<br><br>
Zen leaned back and tried to dodge again, but failed and was bitten on the neck! There was now a bite mark on his neck as well, neither painful nor itchy.
<br><br>
After being bitten twice, Zen unleashed a burst of strength from his legs and retreated to Elvinia's side.
<br><br>
The dog shadow pulled the black wick straight, roaring at Zen non-stop.
<br><br>
"Zen, are you okay?"
<br><br>
Elvinia grabbed Zen's arm and looked at the gray bite mark.
<br><br>
"It will probably be fine, but I'm afraid these bite marks are not that simple," Zen said with a frown.
<br><br>
He had no fear of these vicious beasts tied to the lamp stands attacking him head on. With the suppressive force of Stage Seventeen present, the creatures in this stage wouldn't be too powerful. He believed he would be able to withstand anything thrown at him.
<br><br>
But these bite marks had given him cause for pause.
<br><br>
"Then... it'd be better to not go in, right?" asked Elvinia.
<br><br>
She didn't know what was going on with the temple. She thought that if it was too dangerous, they should just give up.
<br><br>
"No," Zen replied firmly.
<br><br>
His determination left Elvinia not knowing what to say next.
<br><br>
Zen stood motionless, surveying the lamp stands. As he did so, he asked, "No. 9527, Master Regal Jade, do you have any knowledge of what this is?"
<br><br>
It was naturally much easier for him to know the world considering he had two wise people within his body.
<br><br>
"I did not expect such a strange place to exist in Stage Seventeen. My master has never come into contact with this before," answered No. 9527.
<br><br>
No. 9527 had some memories of Stage Seventeen from its master, but its master had never come here.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit hesitated for a long while before replying, "This seems to be the Hidden Spirit Lamp. Although it has been a long time, and I've only seen it once, it's most likely what it is!"
<br><br>
"What is the Hidden Spirit Lamp?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Whatever it was, having any sliver of information on it was valuable.
<br><br>
"It's a kind of lamp in the Three Purities Stage. When the Wing King and I went to Stage Thirty-three, we saw one. The beasts tied to the lamps are called Hidden Beasts. The Cyan Grasshopper that explored the stage with us was attacked by a Hidden Beast, leaving a gray mark on its head."
<br><br>
"What happened to it after that?" Zen asked, listening intently.
<br><br>
Although it took place in Stage Thirty-three, it sounded very much like what they were going through.
<br><br>
"The Cyan Grasshopper was around as strong as I was. When it was attacked by the Hidden Beast, nothing strange occurred. But once we had traveled some distance, its head suddenly exploded!" the Regal Jade Spirit recalled.
<br><br>
"It's that deadly?" Zen asked with his eyebrows suddenly raised and his concern growing.
<br><br>
All creatures of the Regal Jade Civilization possessed extremely tough bodies. Not only that, the Cyan Grasshopper was a formidable master in the thirty-third stage of the Other Shore Realm, said to be as powerful as a Chaos Ancient God. And yet, the Hidden Beast had killed it.
<br><br>
A gloom fell over Zen as he stared at the gray mark on his arm.
<br><br>
"Yes, it's that deadly," the Regal Jade Spirit nodded.
<br><br>
"Were there others attacked by that Hidden Beast?" Zen followed up.
<br><br>
"After the Hidden Beast launched an attack, the Wing King rushed to the lamp stand and extinguished the black flame on it. Once the black flame was extinguished, the Hidden Beast died," the Regal Jade Spirit informed.
<br><br>
The shadow's speed was so astonishing even Zen was unable to dodge it.
<br><br>
One could not comprehend the speed of the Hidden Beast of Stage Thirty- three.
<br><br>
Fortunately, speed was what the Wing King was best at. Putting out the black flame saved the lives of other creatures.
<br><br>
"So putting out the black flame is the way to take care of these Hidden Beasts..." Zen stared at the nearest lamp stand. The dog ceased its roaring, but kept its focus trained on him.
<br><br>
"It's not yet time to extinguish the black flame," the Regal Jade Spirit said worriedly. "Try leaving this area first. The power of the gray bite mark may work and I'm not sure if you can withstand it, but you must try."
<br><br>
The damage of the Hidden Beast was delayed. The Cyan Grasshopper was fine when it was bitten. It was only later that the damage showed itself and killed it. Zen was fine now, but what would happen later? Zen took the suggestion of the Regal Jade Spirit. "Follow me!" he exclaimed to Elvinia.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked, clueless to what Zen had just learned about the lamp stands.
<br><br>
Without answering, Zen turned around and walked towards the gobi at the edge of the circle.
<br><br>
The moment he stepped into the gobi, the Hidden Spirit Lamps and the Hidden Beasts all disappeared.
<br><br>
Then, at the same time, two powerful forces came at him, biting his arm and neck.
<br><br>
Zen was well prepared for this. The Chaotic Source Spirits were activated and they withstood the biting forces.
<br><br>
Elvinia was very close to Zen and could not help but scream when she felt the explosive power from the gray bite marks.
<br><br>
Zen's body shook violently before the bite marks disappeared completely.
<br><br>
He heaved a long sigh of relief and let out, "Fortunately, I can handle it..."
<br><br>
Elvinia looked at him, bewildered, and asked, "What the hell was going on?"
<br><br>
Zen smiled and explained the story of the Hidden Spirit Lamp and the Hidden Beast. On hearing this she said, "So if you're attacked too many times by those Hidden Beasts, they'll leave more and more gray marks which will surely kill you when they finally explode."
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
That was why the Regal Jade Spirit had asked him not to put the flame out yet. He wanted him to test the power of the dog's bite and see if he could handle it now and understand it more.
<br><br>
When Zen returned to the desert, the dog crawling stood up once more, trying to pounce on him.
<br><br>
The corner of Zen's mouth curled up slightly, and his legs suddenly jumped with unparalleled strength. He charged towards the lamp stand like a sharp darting arrow! "Wrrr!"
<br><br>
The dog pounced at Zen as usual.
<br><br>
But this time he had calculated the dog's trajectory. As he rushed forward, he suddenly lowered his body and somersaulted on the ground. He hit the lamp stand with a bang.
<br><br>
It was extremely solid and almost unshakable, but his intention was not to smash it down.
<br><br>
He jumped up and reached out to pinch the black flame.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish...
<br><br>
The moment the black flame was out, the shadow of the dog froze in the air and remained motionless. Now it was an immovable shadow.
<br><br>
Chapter 3597 Repeated Settlement Zen let out a sigh of relief as he looked at the motionless shadow.
<br><br>
According to the Regal Jade Spirit, so long as the black flames on the lamp stands were extinguished, then the Hidden Beasts would remain motionless.
<br><br>
After making sure that the dog wasn't going to move anytime soon, Zen turned to Elvinia. "Follow me. I'll extinguish the flames one by one, so we can pass through."
<br><br>
Elvinia couldn't help but look at the motionless dog. "Are you sure this Hidden Beast won't move again?"
<br><br>
She had understood just now that the Hidden Beasts killed warriors relying on delayed settlement and accumulation.
<br><br>
If one got attacked by a Hidden Beast, the best course of action would be to leave the area to settle the damage. Consecutive, accumulated attacks were dangerous and could lead to a quick death.
<br><br>
How could Zen not understand this? No matter how fast he moved, the Hidden Beasts would still land their attacks on him. If Zen could settle all their hits repeatedly, then it wouldn't be that hard for him and Elvinia to pass through this area.
<br><br>
He wanted to ask the Regal Jade Spirit for help but the latter was unable to give him any answers.
<br><br>
"The situation was critical when we encountered the Hidden Spirit Lamp.
<br><br>
When the Wing King extinguished the flame, he took us deeper. I don't know if the Hidden Beast will move again," the Regal Jade Spirit told him.
<br><br>
"Forget it then. Let's just go inside," Zen said, giving Elvinia what he hoped was a reassuring smile.
<br><br>
Before them were three lamps and each one had a Hidden Beast tied to its post. The shadows' shapes told them these were wolves.
<br><br>
Zen confirmed the direction just now. Since the path before him was the shortest, he chose to challenge the lamp post directly in front of him.
<br><br>
As he stepped forward, the wolves began to get restless, dragging the wicks and trying their best to pounce.
<br><br>
Zen merely ignored the wolves on the left and right sides. They couldn't reach him and all he needed to focus on was the one in front of him.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
Sensing his nearing presence, the wolf howled and prepared to give Zen a full blow.
<br><br>
When Zen noticed the wolf's movements, he took a decisive step forward and, as expected, the wolf suddenly pounced! "This is an opportunity!"
<br><br>
Prepared for this sudden attack, Zen halted and dodged from the side.
<br><br>
Whoosh! His speed was at the maximum but the wolf was also surprisingly agile, quickly catching up to him. It twisted its body and clawed at his back, leaving behind a distinct grey scratch.
<br><br>
Of course, it had no intention of only landing one hit. After it scratched Zen, the wolf snapped its jaws and attempted to bite off the man's head.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen was able to snuff out the black flame before it got the chance to tear his head off. With the flame gone, the wolf froze in midair with its jaws open wide.
<br><br>
"I was scratched again," Zen muttered bitterly.
<br><br>
"The power of this wolf's claw is strong," Elvinia told him with evident concern on her face. "Let's settle it first, okay?"
<br><br>
Having figured out the rules of these Hidden Beasts, the two of them felt much more relaxed. Zen then simply turned back towards the first lamp post and left the desert, enduring the scratch on his back.
<br><br>
The wolf was stronger than the dog but not strong enough to tire out Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
However, the Hidden Beasts in the inner layer still worried him. Zen knew that the deeper they went, the stronger these beasts would be.
<br><br>
If those in the innermost layer turned out to be powerful enough to leave Zen unable to withstand their attacks, then that was going to be a big problem for him.
<br><br>
There was no way he was giving up though. He was already past the point of no return, so he simply entered the desert all over again.
<br><br>
This time, a huge tiger awaited him. With his quick reflexes, Zen managed to get through this one unscathed.
<br><br>
Next came a lion that was able to hit him twice, which forced him to leave in order to settle the claw marks on his body.
<br><br>
The fifth Hidden Beast he faced was a slow rhinoceros and Zen didn't have any problem extinguishing its lamp.
<br><br>
The sixth one...
<br><br>
The seventh one...
<br><br>
It was a cycle: he would go in, get a few scratches, and then withdraw for settlement. This went on for an hour before he finally arrived at the center of the desert. However, just when he and Elvinia thought that things had finally turned out in their favor, a depressing scene made their hearts sink to their stomachs.
<br><br>
Elvinia pointed at something behind him. "Zen, look!"
<br><br>
He had been so focused on dealing with the Hidden Beasts, so it had been Elvinia's job to look around.
<br><br>
Zen turned to where she was pointing at and found the dog. It was originally motionless but slowly began to move as its extinguished lamp lit up again.
<br><br>
"This is the worst part," he sighed from exhaustion.
<br><br>
As the lamps lit up one by one, he found his retreat effectively blocked, so there was no way he would be able to settle his injuries now.
<br><br>
Elvinia wanted to grab Zen's hand and pull him all the way out. It wasn't too late to leave, but then she recalled just how determined the man was about all this. There was no way he was going to give up.
<br><br>
"I'll send you out first," he told her.
<br><br>
The first desert was already so dangerous and the following grassland and round gobi area would be even more so. Zen wasn't going to put Elvinia in that sort of peril, so he grabbed her hand and prepared to take her away.
<br><br>
However, she wrenched herself away from his grip. "My body may not be as strong as yours but I can still take a couple of injuries!" she told him. "I can help you extinguish the lamps!"
<br><br>
So long as the damage they took was in the range of their endurance, then going through this area wasn't going to be so terrifying.
<br><br>
Elvinia had already made up her mind. If Zen was staying, then so was she.
<br><br>
The man looked on to the path they still needed to traverse. "We're going to have to be more careful from now on."
<br><br>
A huge, grey bite mark was on Zen's chest after he passed through two more lamp posts. The Hidden Beast that had bitten him was huge and had a mouth so big that it could swallow him in one gulp. One could only imagine how powerful this grey bite mark would be after it was settled.
<br><br>
As he pushed forward, Zen couldn't help but look back at the lamp posts he had once extinguished but were now all lit up again.
<br><br>
There was no settling this grey bite mark. All he could do was let it accumulate on his body.
<br><br>
Just as he thought about this, three green flames suddenly appeared at the entrance in the distance.
<br><br>
Chapter 3598 The Second Way For Settlement Although the green-colored flames were quite a distance away, Zen was still able to see them clearly.
<br><br>
The flames took human shapes and wore sturdy armors. Green flames spurted out from all the parts that weren't covered by their armors.
<br><br>
Noticing Zen's unusual behavior, Elvinia also turned and saw the three human-shaped flames. Her face turned pale in an instant as she caught sight of them.
<br><br>
They weren't certain about the origins of the human-shaped flames, but even with their distance, they could still feel the tremendous power emanating from these creatures. Elvinia couldn't help but take a few steps back because of fear.
<br><br>
"Grrr!"
<br><br>
A dragon-shaped Hidden Beast roared somewhere behind them.
<br><br>
Extremely surprised, Elvinia lost her balance as she tried to quickly turn.
<br><br>
Before she fell, Zen immediately held her waist and helped her regain her balance. "Don't be afraid," Zen said softly as he tried to calm her.
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded, though it was obvious that she was still in a state of shock.
<br><br>
She actually had complete trust in Zen, but she just couldn't shake off her fear and anxiousness of being trapped between the Hidden Spirit Lamps and the three unknown creatures.
<br><br>
After calming Elvinia, Zen asked the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 about the origin of the human-shaped flames.
<br><br>
This time, both of them seemed to know the answer. They had enough knowledge about the human-shaped flames.
<br><br>
"These creatures are born in the flames. They belong to the Element Spirit race," the Regal Jade Spirit answered.
<br><br>
"They are called the Moon Fire Slaves. Among the members of the Element Spirit race, these creatures are very powerful warriors," No. 9527 added.
<br><br>
"What's strange is that they usually appear in the higher stages. What are they doing here in Stage Seventeen?"
<br><br>
After listening to No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit, Zen concluded, "There's only one thing that could explain this: the Element Spirit race must have been informed of our arrival."
<br><br>
"You're right. It was the Elephant Man race," No. 9527 replied.
<br><br>
Back on the grassland, Zen surmised that the Elephant Man race was probably a group of spies for some large race. It seemed that his guess was indeed correct.
<br><br>
"Fortunately, though the Moon Fire Slaves are very powerful, their strength has been greatly suppressed after they entered this stage. However…" No.
<br><br>
9527 paused abruptly.
<br><br>
"What is it?" Zen quickly asked.
<br><br>
"Their strength might be suppressed, but they still have tremendous life energy. It would still be very difficult to kill them," No. 9527 explained.
<br><br>
Zen was still asking for more information about the Moon Fire Slaves when the three human-shaped flames seemed to have already discovered them.
<br><br>
"I have a visual of the targets. The Elephant Men didn't lie," No. 12 reported.
<br><br>
"But these Hidden Spirit Lamps are hindering us," No. 13 said as he looked at the lamp posts.
<br><br>
"Humph! How powerful can the Hidden Spirit Lamps in Stage Seventeen be? Hey, No. 14! Kill them but remember to keep their hands intact!" No.
<br><br>
12 ordered in a stern voice.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves knew that the Other Shore Key was on one of the hands of Zen or Elvinia. Their trip to Stage Seventeen was for this very purpose.
<br><br>
"But..."
<br><br>
No. 14 briefly hesitated.
<br><br>
Before they had come down to this stage, they had also heard about its current situation.
<br><br>
The place wasn't as simple as it looked. Moreover, the injuries inflicted by the Hidden Beasts were settled together. No. 14 thought that it probably wasn't a wise choice to rush things and act rashly.
<br><br>
"Don't be such a wimp! You won't die. Besides, I want to see the strength of these Hidden Beasts," No. 12 argued.
<br><br>
"Or we can extinguish the Hidden Spirit Lamps first," No. 14 asserted in a low voice.
<br><br>
"Don't test my patience!" No. 12 was getting annoyed at No. 14's dillydallying.
<br><br>
Despite his resistance, No. 14 couldn't disobey No. 12. No. 14 couldn't do anything but bite the bullet as he rushed towards Zen.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! Just as No. 14 was close enough to the Hidden Spirit Lamps, the Hidden Beasts that were tied to the lamp posts rushed to him right away.
<br><br>
Giant dogs, wolves, tigers, leopards… Vicious creatures in various forms rabidly bit and clawed at No. 14 continuously.
<br><br>
The injuries caused by the Hidden Beasts weren't settled immediately, hence only leaving traces of gray scars upon the body of No. 14.
<br><br>
It actually took Zen an hour to go from the entrance to the center of the round desert. To get rid of the injuries that he had suffered, he needed to get in and out repeatedly, which was why it took him a lot of time.
<br><br>
However, being pressured by No. 12, No. 14 rushed into the inner layer of the round desert disregarding the injuries that would accumulate. In just a few seconds, the Moon Fire Slave was just about a thousand feet away from Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Stand behind me," Zen calmly instructed Elvinia.
<br><br>
Not far from them, a huge dragon-shaped Hidden Beast was intently staring at them.
<br><br>
Zen took about two steps forward while exercising full caution.
<br><br>
At the same time, even at a distance of more than a thousand feet, Zen could still feel the burning aura of the Moon Fire Slave. The green flames that were oozing out from his body were terrifying, but there was no hint of fear in Zen's eyes. After all, he couldn't be harmed by fire. However, Elvinia was relatively weak against it. That was why Zen was determined to finish off the Moon Fire Slave as soon as possible.
<br><br>
As the Moon Fire Slave got closer and closer, the heat waves being emitted were also getting stronger.
<br><br>
"Zen, it's so hot. I don't think I can take it anymore."
<br><br>
Elvinia was in a total pinch as she had nowhere to go. The Moon Fire Slave was getting closer in front, and the dragon-shaped Hidden Beast was just about a foot behind her.
<br><br>
As the Moon Fire Slave cut the distance of about five hundred feet, Elvinia suddenly felt like her body was being cut by a knife and her hair was being engulfed by fire. She couldn't help but scream in agony.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Zen gritted his teeth and clenched his fists. He couldn't wait anymore. He had to stop the Moon Fire Slave from approaching further, or Elvinia would really be burnt by the flames.
<br><br>
However, just as Zen was about to rush over, the approaching Moon Fire Slave suddenly trembled and halted.
<br><br>
Immediately after, an extremely terrifying force burst out from his body.
<br><br>
The armor worn by No. 14 was instantly shattered. His mountain-like body collapsed and his flames were extinguished. The broken armor scattered all over the ground.
<br><br>
"Is he dead?" Zen was a little confused and stunned.
<br><br>
As the scorching waves disappeared, Elvinia was finally able to breathe properly. There was a sigh of relief as she fixed her charred hair. "How could he die all of a sudden?" Elvinia asked as she caught her breath.
<br><br>
"His injuries must have been settled!" Zen's face brightened up as he realized what happened.
<br><br>
According to the Regal Jade Spirit, if they were attacked by the Hidden Beasts, the injuries accumulated would only be settled after they retreated a certain distance.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that there was more than one way for the injuries to be settled.
<br><br>
No. 14's framework was huge and he didn't bother dodging any attack made by the Hidden Beasts.
<br><br>
As he rushed to Zen's location, several attacks from the Hidden Beasts accumulated on his body.
<br><br>
"I guess when the power of the Hidden Beasts' attacks reaches a fatal limit, it will be automatically settled," Zen told the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
"That should be it."
<br><br>
"I agree!"
<br><br>
No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit affirmed Zen's deduction.
<br><br>
In the distance, No. 12 and No. 13 were standing still. Their angry faces were outlined by the flames in their helmets.
<br><br>
"Really? Only half the distance, and No. 14 was killed," No. 12 uttered in surprise.
<br><br>
"We can't take any more chances. We need to extinguish the lamps first before we chase them," No. 13 urged.
<br><br>
It was true that the Moon Fire Slaves were tough creatures. For now, No. 14 had died, but they still had a way to bring him back to life later.
<br><br>
Chapter 3599 Stop No. 12 watched the two human beings in the distance. After thinking for a while, he finally said, "Let's put out the lamps!"
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had initially sent out the Moon Fire Slaves in order to snatch the Other Shore Key from the two of them.
<br><br>
It wasn't the Moon Fire Slaves' job to explore this dangerous place, or the temple in it.
<br><br>
They figured it would be for the best if they stayed out of this dangerous place. However, now that they chased after them, it was inevitable that they had to enter that place.
<br><br>
Having a large body, No. 13 made a big stride forward and reached out to touch the first lamp stand easily. After all, each Hidden Beast's movement could only cover an area with the diameter of two hundred feet.
<br><br>
He pinched the black flame on the wick, extinguishing it instantly.
<br><br>
However, being large in size also had its disadvantages. When No. 13 stretched out his hands to extinguish the black fire, the surrounding Hidden Beasts attacked him. His arms were then covered in grey marks from this.
<br><br>
"No. 12. What should we do now?" No. 13 turned around and held his arms up in front of No. 12.
<br><br>
To extinguish one Hidden Spirit Lamp, No. 13 had to be attacked so many times. If he put out the flames of a few more lamps, the attacks that he would suffer would probably not be less than that of No. 14! After surveying his surroundings, No. 12 said, "It seems that the design of this place only allows creatures under ten feet high to pass through. We need to shrink."
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slave was a kind of fire spirit. They could become large or small in size, even their armor adjusted to their size.
<br><br>
No. 13 nodded. Immediately, the bodies of the two Moon Fire Slaves shrank. Their armor melted into a silver liquid. Finally, once the two had condensed to a height of roughly ten feet, their armors solidified, fitting them snugly.
<br><br>
Now that they were small, they were able to move more nimbly.
<br><br>
No. 13 then took a step forward, his momentum causing a gust of hot wind.
<br><br>
He was headed straight for the second lamp stand...
<br><br>
"They are going to catch up," said Elvinia, pursing her lips anxiously.
<br><br>
There was no way she'd want them to get close again. She had already suffered enough from the first Moon Fire Slave.
<br><br>
"They won't be able to catch up soon," Zen said reassuringly. "Let's continue moving forward."
<br><br>
Anyway, there was no other way to go but forward.
<br><br>
Although the Moon Fire Slaves were able to move faster now, they still weren't as fast as the Hidden Beasts.
<br><br>
While extinguishing four lamp stands in a row, No. 13 had still been attacked three times. Thinking of the ones he had already received when he had a huge body, he was a little worried.
<br><br>
"Once these injuries break out, I'll have to suffer a lot..." No. 13 said anxiously. "I'll retreat and settle them outside."
<br><br>
If No. 13 died here, No. 12 would be forced to fight in person. Of course, No.12 didn't want that to happen. Waving his hand impatiently, he said, "Hurry up."
<br><br>
Similar to what Zen did, No. 13 retreated to the gobi outside the desert to allow the gray marks dotting his body to explode. After that, he rushed back to No. 12's side.
<br><br>
After No. 12 and No. 13 went deep into the group of lamp stands, they soon found that the method of leaving the area for settlement did not work any more.
<br><br>
The lights they had just extinguished were somehow lit again. They had no choice but to move forward.
<br><br>
Zen had expected the Moon Fire Slaves would encounter such a problem.
<br><br>
Not bothering to look back to check, he focused all his attention on the Hidden Beast in front of him.
<br><br>
The Hidden Beast in front of him was a unicorn. Narrowing his eyes, Zen attempted to leap upwards, when the unicorn followed suit at incredible speed, stabbing its sharp horn into Zen's belly.
<br><br>
Zen gritted his teeth but managed to reach out and put out another black flame. Staggering backwards, he checked his stomach to find more grey marks. These were probably going to cause him great suffering later on.
<br><br>
Elvinia watched him inspect his scars. Her heart sank. Zen had incurred several wounds already, and she was worried his body would collapse if he settled them all at the same time...
<br><br>
"Let me deal with the next lamp," Elvinia said firmly.
<br><br>
Not far away, a Hidden Beast looking like a cat curled up on the ground.
<br><br>
This Hidden Beast was obviously agile and nimble. If Zen didn't move fast enough, he'd probably incur yet another wound.
<br><br>
"Don't worry," Zen shook his head. "I'll be fine."
<br><br>
After saying that, he transformed into an arrow again and shot forward.
<br><br>
Whizzing past the cat, he rushed to the lamp stand ahead.
<br><br>
However, as Elvinia expected, two more scratches appeared on Zen's body.
<br><br>
This spiritual cat didn't seem to be large, but the two scratches it left were shining with silver gray light, indicating they were serious injuries.
<br><br>
The Hidden Beasts in the second half of the journey were much more powerful than those in the first half. This meant that the rest of the journey would prove perilous.
<br><br>
Zen hurried on to pass through three more lamp stands, each time incurring more wounds. At this point, even the Regal Jade Spirit spoke, "Zen, if you get injured one more time, I'm afraid it'll be troublesome to settle the injuries..."
<br><br>
"What can I do? We can't turn back. I can only trust my luck now," Zen answered, as he eyed the Hidden Beast before him. It was a centipede with twelve pairs of wings.
<br><br>
"I just thought about it and found that there seemed to be something wrong with the way to settle the injuries. Back then, when the Cyan Grasshopper received a fatal attack from the Hidden Beast in the Three Purities Stage, the settlement didn't come immediately. Instead, it came after a while and the Cyan Grasshopper directly died," the Regal Jade Spirit said.
<br><br>
Zen was just about to rush to the lamp stand, but upon hearing the Regal Jade Spirit's words, he abruptly stopped in his tracks.
<br><br>
Although Zen was persistent and brave, that didn't mean he wasn't afraid to die.
<br><br>
Studying the gray scars that painted his body, he felt anxious. They were like ominous blades that hung over his head, ready to fall at any moment.
<br><br>
"According to the situation of that Moon Fire Slave, the Cyan Grasshopper should have died on the spot, not after a while," said Zen slowly.
<br><br>
"Yes!" The Regal Jade Spirit added, "The rules of the settlement are somewhat different from what I thought."
<br><br>
"However, the result is the same..." Zen responded faintly.
<br><br>
Although the Moon Fire Slaves' strength was suppressed by Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore, Zen doubted he was stronger than them.
<br><br>
"But think about it," the Regal Jade Spirit pressed. "What if a person is seriously injured, and stays in this area the whole time?"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes lit up. Was it the third method of settlement? "Are you saying the injuries will be settled when the time is up?" Zen asked slowly.
<br><br>
"It's very likely." The Regal Jade Spirit nodded confidently.
<br><br>
"If so..."
<br><br>
Zen whipped his head around to look at the Moon Fire Slaves in the distance.
<br><br>
They seemed to be in a worse predicament than him.
<br><br>
Pondering over this for a bit, Zen decided to stop moving forward. If what the Regal Jade Spirit had said was true, he would have to try staying put for a while.
<br><br>
Seeing that Zen had stopped pressing forward, No. 13 was overjoyed. This gave him renewed strength, and he proceeded to extinguish the Hidden Spirit Lamps as fast as he could.
<br><br>
He was getting close. But suddenly, studying the gray scars on his body, he hesitated to move forward.
