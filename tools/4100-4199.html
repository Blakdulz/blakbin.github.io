Chapter 4100 The Origin Of The Ancestry-level Bloodline Zen didn't expect that the Monkey Spirit King would bring him back to the Ghost Mountain because he needed help regarding the wolf teeth.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King had just awakened.
<br><br>
The wolf teeth were very important to him. If there was only a chance to infuse the bloodline power into them, he would definitely do it.
<br><br>
Seeing how Zen personally repaired the thirteen wolf teeth, he immediately realized that Zen would be the key.
<br><br>
Now that he knew that Zen possessed the ancestry-level bloodline, there was no way that he would let this opportunity slip by.
<br><br>
However, after being surprised by the Monkey Spirit King's request, Zen let out a sigh as a slight frown emerged on his face.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid I can't do it," Zen finally said. "Why is that?" the Monkey Spirit King asked as his brows furrowed.
<br><br>
"The ancestry-level bloodline is not really under my control," Zen tried to explain briefly.
<br><br>
He was telling the truth. In fact, he even wanted to ask the Monkey Spirit King on how he could control and use the bloodline.
<br><br>
As expected, the Monkey Spirit King didn't believe him right away.
<br><br>
"You know, I don't like to force others. So, you can name a higher price.
<br><br>
That won't be a problem," the Monkey Spirit King insisted.
<br><br>
"I apologize, but please believe me," Zen said with all sincerity. "I don't know if it just chose me by pure coincidence or not, but right now, it's living inside my body and I can't really control it. About the wolf teeth, the bloodline repaired them on its own."
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King didn't really want to accept Zen's explanation, but he didn't find any reason for Zen to lie about it.
<br><br>
"With that, I am actually hoping if you can give me some advice on how I can properly control the ancestry-level bloodline," Zen added.
<br><br>
After all, the Monkey Spirit King was one of the heads of the Four Spirits Sect, and also its founder. Naturally Zen thought that the Monkey Spirit King should know more about the bloodline than him.
<br><br>
"Really? How could this happen?" The Monkey Spirit King let out a deep sigh as an obviously disappointed expression revealed on his face. Zen already explained his side of the story.
<br><br>
Now it was up to the Monkey Spirit King whether he would believe Zen or not.
<br><br>
"Well, let me think about it first."
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King raised his head and looked at the ceiling of the inner layer of the Ghost Mountain. He tried his best to search his memories regarding the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Zen just kept silent and waited patiently and expectantly.
<br><br>
After a while, the Monkey Spirit King rubbed his chin and said, "Sheehan was the one who obtained the ancestry-level bloodline. Then, Kincaid studied its abilities, and Cornelius built the Eternal Divine Courtyard afterward. Damn it, I'm the only one who doesn't have anything to do with the ancestry-level bloodline!"
<br><br>
In the beginning, the four sect leaders divided their duties.
<br><br>
Sheehan, the Bird Spirit King, was the one responsible for the exploration of different things. Kincaid, the Human Spirit King, was the smartest, so he was in charge of studying and making researches. Cornelius, the Snake Spirit King, was also very bright, but what he was known for were his resourcefulness and detailed execution.
<br><br>
Lastly, the Monkey Spirit King's strength lay in his expertise in dominating battles.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters and the monkey spirits didn't possess high intelligence but they were fearsome fighters.
<br><br>
Wherever the Monkey Spirit King led them, they followed suit, and victory was theirs.
<br><br>
If new powerful weapons were made in the Four Spirits Sect, the Monkey Spirit Sect had the liberty to use and try them out first.
<br><br>
That said, the leader of the Human Spirit Sect, Kincaid, was the one who helped the Monkey Spirit King inject the bloodline powers into the Thirteen Teeth Necklace.
<br><br>
As Zen heard the Monkey Spirit King's answer, his mouth almost opened wide as he was rendered speechless.
<br><br>
It turned out that the Monkey Spirit King actually knew nothing about the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The omnipotent Monkey Spirit King was apparently the only reckless leader among the four heads of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Fortunately, while Zen was still in a daze, the Monkey Spirit King seemed to have remembered something helpful. "I think there are still some documents about the ancestry-level bloodline in the Ghost Mountain."
<br><br>
After all, the Four Spirits Sect shared important resources and ensured that everyone had a copy.
<br><br>
Whenever the Human Spirit Sect found something new, they would give a copy to the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Thus, the Monkey Spirit King knew that they must have some documents regarding the ancestry-level bloodline somewhere in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
They just tended to forget because they didn't pay much attention to these documents. The same was true for every member, including Manuel and the other Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
Back when the Primeval Lord of Heaven was locked up in the Ghost Mountain, he had inquired about the blended bloodlines from Manuel and Tearrag.
<br><br>
However, they did not remember that the documents related to that topic actually existed. Fortunately, the Monkey Spirit King had a slightly better memory than the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
"I see. Then, can I borrow those documents?" Zen's eyes suddenly lit up.
<br><br>
"Yes, sure," said the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
"If it will help you gain better understanding of the bloodline, I'll be more than willing to lend you those," he added.
<br><br>
He had already been skilled at using thirteen kinds of bloodline power.
<br><br>
Because of that, he could maximize the power of the Thirteen Teeth Necklace and release tremendous strength.
<br><br>
And if he obtained twenty-two kinds of bloodline power, he would be able to improve his strength to a whole new level.
<br><br>
For that, he was hoping that Zen could control the ancestry-level bloodline and help him.
<br><br>
It was like hitting two birds with one stone. Zen was also eager to gain control of the bloodline in his body, so it would be both a win for them.
<br><br>
"But I'm afraid I won't be able to do it alone. I need two other people to help me with this," Zen said. "No problem. Do what you got to do," the Monkey Spirit King agreed without hesitation.
<br><br>
After a while, the Monkey Masters went to the Night View Island to invite the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess. They were the two people in Zen's mind that could greatly help him.
<br><br>
As they didn't know why Zen was abruptly summoned to the Ghost Mountain, they naturally looked at him with inquiring eyes.
<br><br>
Zen quickly understood the meaning of their stares, so he told them the overview of the Monkey Spirit King's request.
<br><br>
As the leader of the Ghost Mountain, the Monkey Spirit King appeared to be very omnipotent in the eyes of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
After all, he was a leader of the Four Spirits Sect, the master of everything.
<br><br>
That was why when they heard everything that Zen said, they were extremely shocked.
<br><br>
Apparently, the strongest being in the Four Spirits Sect was the one who didn't know anything about the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess had mixed feelings about what they heard.
<br><br>
Of course, it was a given that they were extremely surprised, but they were also overjoyed because it meant that they had the chance to read the documents about the ancestry-level bloodline. Gaining knowledge from the esteemed Four Spirits Sect was something that they would absolutely indulge on.
<br><br>
Soon after, several Monkey Masters had escorted them to the hall at the top floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
As they entered the hall, they instantly saw that it was covered with thick dust. They could just imagine how many years had passed by without anyone setting foot in that place.
<br><br>
Tearrag also entered and walked towards the end of the hall. As he gently touched a spot on the wall, a rumbling sound was instantly heard. A rectangular stone coffin surfaced from the wall. Inside it, there were multiple square stone tablets, on which distinct Sanskrit words were engraved.
<br><br>
"These are the records about the ancestry-level bloodline. Study them for as long as you want. However, don't touch the other stone coffins on the wall," Tearrag warned them.
<br><br>
They assumed that the history, unique skills, and bloodline theurgies of the Monkey Spirit Sect must have been recorded there.
<br><br>
Although they were well organized, the Monkey Masters never bothered to take time to read them.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess just nodded at Tearrag as their eyes focused on the stone tablets in front of them.
<br><br>
They had stayed in the Ghost Mountain for a long time so they now had a good understanding of Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
However, they recognized that it would still take them several hours to completely read all the words on the stone tablets. This would make their work both inefficient and inaccurate.
<br><br>
This was an important task so the two stared at Zen after they looked at all the stone tablets.
<br><br>
Zen quickly knew what they meant. He asked the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher the contents on the stone tablets for them.
<br><br>
After they were translated, Zen told them the words.
<br><br>
According to the records on the stone tablets, Sheehan managed to obtain the ancestry-level bloodline on one of his explorations.
<br><br>
Back then, he had lost his way and went into a Time Vessel.
<br><br>
However, the time and space in the main world were totally different from what Zen and the others knew.
<br><br>
Therefore, they weren't able to imagine what the Time Vessel was like.
<br><br>
They could only guess that it was some kind of vessel that was related to time.
<br><br>
Then, the records said that the ancestry-level bloodline was obtained in the Time Vessel.
<br><br>
At that time, the Four Spirits Sect was already quite influential, but it was far from being able to dominate the main world.
<br><br>
However, after they acquired the ancestry-level bloodline, everything changed. The human spirits, bird spirits, snake spirits, and monkey spirits were endowed with all sorts of abilities, and their strength increased at an incredible rate.
<br><br>
Realizing that they could obtain more power, Kincaid and Cornelius became greedy and weren't willing to stop at that point. They weren't satisfied with what they had yet, knowing that the energy contained in the ancestry-level bloodline was infinite.
<br><br>
Chapter 4101 Records According to the records, the four kings had been on good terms and trusted each other.
<br><br>
Any creature in the Four Spirits Sect could have a try to obtain the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
After the strength of the Four Spirits Sect increased, they began to expand and enlarge their scale.
<br><br>
Their demand for ancestry-level bloodline also grew in return.
<br><br>
However, merging with the ancestry-level bloodline could only be done by a small number of the talents in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
The vast majority of the members tried many times, but they all resulted in failure.
<br><br>
However, there was one attempt that marked a turning point—Kincaid's.
<br><br>
He had divided the ancestry-level bloodline with a not very complicated method.
<br><br>
For experiments, the human spirits captured a large number of snow-white mice with wings called Heron Mice. These mice were pinned down and forcibly injected with the ancestry-level blood.
<br><br>
The energy contained in the ancestry-level bloodline was overwhelming, making it unbearable for the mice.
<br><br>
The only consequence for them after absorbing the ancestry-level bloodline was to explode and die.
<br><br>
The experiments yielded the same results repeatedly.
<br><br>
Fortunately, tens of billions of Heron Mice thrived in the forest closest to the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
The monkey spirits in the Monkey Spirit Sect had the most important task of capturing the mice for decades.
<br><br>
Nearly a million mice had died from all the experiments when, finally, one of them managed to survive.
<br><br>
It wasn't because the mouse was special, but because the ancestry-level bloodline had become "tired".
<br><br>
In the beginning, both Cornelius and Sheehan believed the power of the ancestry-level bloodline to be inexhaustible, but Kincaid didn't agree. He felt that everything had its limits.
<br><br>
Orlando himself was not interested in the mystery of the ancestry-level bloodline. He was also unwilling to learn about it, so he blindly agreed with Kincaid.
<br><br>
Only the Human Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect supported the research on the ancestry-level bloodline. The Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect showed no concern with it.
<br><br>
When Kincaid injected the ancestry-level bloodline into the body of the Heron Mouse, he keenly sensed the slight change that occurred in the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The inexhaustible energy of the ancestry-level bloodline had proved unsuitable for the fusion before.
<br><br>
He assumed that this kind of ability of the ancestry-level bloodline could be considered as a kind of poison, the poison of rejection, but the poison had limitations.
<br><br>
After causing countless mice's death, its toxicity had weakened. The ancestry-level bloodline finally yielded and successfully merged into the mouse's body.
<br><br>
The mouse instantly changed. It started to breathe heavily and moved as if it wanted to break free.
<br><br>
It displayed an incredible skill from the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
At that time, whoever could obtain the ability of the ancestry-level bloodline would immediately become a powerhouse.
<br><br>
Both the mouse's strength and speed greatly increased. After the experiment, it managed to attack three human spirits and killed them all. It planned to escape afterward, but Kincaid came to restrain and take it under his control.
<br><br>
Kincaid was overjoyed. He delighted at the thought of his success.
<br><br>
The poison of rejection had only been his speculation, yet it proved true.
<br><br>
He had proudly created a new bloodline from the mouse.
<br><br>
The Human Spirit Sect called this new bloodline the source bloodline.
<br><br>
The source bloodline had an ability of the ancestry-level bloodline but it was incomplete.
<br><br>
Some of the source bloodlines had inherited only one-tenth of a single ability, while some had two-tenth.
<br><br>
Compared to the abilities given by the ancestry-level bloodline, the source bloodlines were not that powerful, but they were highly adaptable.
<br><br>
The majority of the spirits in the Four Spirits Sect were able to fuse with this source bloodline.
<br><br>
There were only a small number of talented warriors who could merge with the ancestry-level bloodline before.
<br><br>
But everyone could now use the ancestry-level bloodline. The members of the Four Spirits Sect shouted and jumped for joy when they found out about the news.
<br><br>
However, Kincaid only allowed the members of the Monkey Spirit Sect to fuse with this source bloodline.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed as he attentively listened beside Zen, "This must be the core problem."
<br><br>
"The Four Spirits Sect was an integral whole. It's undeniable that the Monkey Spirit Sect made great contributions, but the fact that Kincaid showed favoritism for this sect would surely bring a conflict," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit Sect's contribution to producing the source bloodline from the ancestry-level bloodline had always been recognized. After all, it was because of their tireless capture of the mice that Kincaid's experiments were pushed through.
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect felt angry with the way things turned out.
<br><br>
Although they didn't express their emotions at the time, they might in the future.
<br><br>
This was one of the matters that affected the harmony of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
They continued to capture a large number of mice even after creating the source bloodline.
<br><br>
After the two millionth mouse died, Kincaid obtained the second source bloodline as expected. Its ability was completely different from the first one.
<br><br>
Then came more and more source bloodlines which all displayed different abilities.
<br><br>
During the process, however, the number of mice in the forest plummeted.
<br><br>
Their bones piled up into mountains in the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Although he had acquired many, Kincaid grew dissatisfied with the power of the source bloodlines.
<br><br>
It was because the source bloodlines could only release one-tenth or twotenths of an ability of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Their strength wasn't enough—they were simply too weak.
<br><br>
To solve this problem, Kincaid gathered the smartest men among the human spirits for a discussion. The sun rose and set for many days, and then they finally came to a conclusion.
<br><br>
The mice were naturally weak, which determined their weak abilities even after they'd absorbed source bloodlines.
<br><br>
To obtain powerful source bloodlines, they had to use powerful creatures as well.
<br><br>
The main world didn't have many powerful creatures, leaving the Four Spirits Sect with few choices.
<br><br>
They explored and hunted, which led them to several selected targets.
<br><br>
Among these were numerous ants of several hundred feet in size and black midges.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect agreed that capturing these creatures was difficult, but they appreciated the human spirits' efforts and asked their members to join them in working.
<br><br>
The division of labor in the Four Spirits Sect led to a great improvement in their efficiency.
<br><br>
Soon after, the experiments were carried out with the powerful creatures.
<br><br>
Everything went smoothly. After about one hundred thousand ants died, Kincaid once again obtained a much stronger source bloodline.
<br><br>
It had possessed forty percent of a single ability of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Kincaid named it root-level bloodline, and the previous one was named the source-level bloodline.
<br><br>
With the popularity of the source-level and the root-level bloodlines in the Four Spirits Sect, their strength excelled once again.
<br><br>
They were able to produce elites in batches which could only be resisted by very few races in the main world.
<br><br>
Even so, Kincaid remained dissatisfied.
<br><br>
He aspired to obtain a much stronger bloodline, or better, to figure out a method to directly fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
However, he had not fulfilled this wish because of the absence of both an extremely powerful and populous race in the main world.
<br><br>
Chapter 4102 Bold Conjecture House The general trend was that the stronger a certain race was, the smaller its number of members would be. The direct opposite also held true.
<br><br>
This particular trend could be observed in both the main and secondary worlds.
<br><br>
Although Kincaid failed to find a powerful race with enough individuals to serve as subjects for his experiment, he refused to give up.
<br><br>
He had sacrificed the Heron Mice first, to be the specimens on testing the repelling power of the ancestry-level bloodline. When they were all depleted, he had started using different and stronger creatures to further the experiment.
<br><br>
However, even with this, the experiment still failed in the end.
<br><br>
The main reason was that the repelling power of the ancestry-level bloodline had strange judging criteria. It could only be utilized to a certain type of creature or race. If the experimental subject changed into a totally different one in the middle of the process, the repelling power would recover completely and all of the prior progress would be lost.
<br><br>
This strange phenomenon was recorded in detail on the stone tablets.
<br><br>
After the attempt of strengthening the root-level bloodlines had failed, Kincaid decided to take a new route and tried to merge different bloodlines this time.
<br><br>
As Zen translated the words on the tablets at this point, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was greatly surprised. "Whoa. So, it turns out that the Human Spirit King has begun merging bloodlines so much earlier than I did," he said with a trembling smile.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had also conducted countless experiments in the Ghost Mountain, and he knew how difficult it really was to merge bloodlines.
<br><br>
Well technically, it was not difficult to simply combine two different kinds of bloodlines. However, soon after they were merged, the abilities of the paired bloodlines would start rejecting each other, causing the energy to be very unstable.
<br><br>
Because of this, most blended bloodlines could only exist for a few seconds, while others could last for a couple of hours at most.
<br><br>
After experimenting for quite a long time, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was successful to maintain several types of blended bloodlines up to a few months before they finally disintegrated.
<br><br>
Such bloodlines would be unsuitable to be fused with warriors. However, since the sole purpose of his experiment was only to help awaken the Monkey Spirit King, this drawback could be ignored.
<br><br>
When Kincaid was the one performing the experiments, he had much better conditions and resources than the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Most people around the Primeval Lord of Heaven had only obtained the source-level bloodlines, and only a very few ones had obtained the rootlevel bloodlines.
<br><br>
On the other hand, after Kincaid did a lot of experiments, all kinds of source-level and root-level bloodlines could be found in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Human Spirit King had more options to select from compared to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
It should have been much easier for him to attain dramatic progress because of his resources.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Kincaid didn't carry out the experiments on his own. He should have many capable assistants in the Human Spirit Sect to help him out.
<br><br>
After a series of complicated experiments, he had finally created four new blended bloodlines.
<br><br>
These were the four origin-level bloodlines that Zen had witnessed in the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
The origin-level bloodlines were much more superior. Anyone who could fuse with them would instantly be regarded as top-level talents and would be highly valued in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Of course, in addition to these well-known origin-level bloodlines, Kincaid still created other blended bloodlines like them afterward.
<br><br>
Their powers were just as extraordinary as the initial ones. However, this time, Kincaid decided to not make them public. Instead, he only applied them to very few people.
<br><br>
Among them, the Monkey Spirit King was the one he picked to fuse with the most kinds of bloodlines.
<br><br>
"The Monkey Spirit King acquired thirteen kinds of powerful bloodlines.
<br><br>
This is the origin of the Thirteen Teeth Necklace," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
"I think so," Zen replied. "From what we know so far, it seems that there is no special trick in merging bloodlines. Anyone could succeed by trial and error, but of course, one would need several resources to increase the rate of success."
<br><br>
They soon learned that the conditions on the Night View Island weren't enough for them to conduct similar experiments.
<br><br>
In fact, they realized that even the entire chaos might not have sufficient resources for this.
<br><br>
Zen clearly remembered that the source-level and root-level bloodlines in the Eternal Scroll Painting were far from enough.
<br><br>
If they wanted to really create blended bloodlines by themselves, they would have to use the ancestry-level bloodline itself and start from scratch. However, they all knew that it would take a lot of time to produce viable results.
<br><br>
Realizing that this was such an impossible task, they couldn't help but just sigh in frustration. "Let's read on the other stone tablets to find out more information," the Snake Goddess finally suggested.
<br><br>
Currently, Zen had already deciphered a total of six stone tablets, and there were still a dozen more to go.
<br><br>
"Look here. There's a signature on this tablet," Zen said as he pointed at the lower corner of the stone tablet.
<br><br>
From the ones that Zen had already finished translating, this was the first stone tablet he encountered that contained a signature. "What does it say?"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven inquired Zen slightly tilted his head as if quite confused at the words written. "It says Bold Conjecture House, Human Spirit Sect."
<br><br>
"Bold Conjecture House?" the Snake Goddess repeated with furrowed brows. "That's a strange name."
<br><br>
They already knew that there were several houses affiliated to the Human Spirit Sect, but this was their first time hearing this one.
<br><br>
"Well, let me go ask about it first," Zen offered.
<br><br>
He walked straight to the door where Tearrag was standing guard, looking bored stiff.
<br><br>
"Master Tearrag," Zen greeted as he bowed to him.
<br><br>
Tearrag had just finished yawning as he cast a nonchalant glance at him and asked, "What is it?"
<br><br>
"I just want to ask if you have heard of the Bold Conjecture House of the Human Spirit Sect before," Zen inquired straightforwardly. Tearrag lightly scratched his head as if he wasn't sure of what he heard.
<br><br>
"What? Bold Con…" Tearrag asked in confusion. "Bold Conjecture House," Zen repeated.
<br><br>
"What the heck is that name? I don't think I could be of help. There are all kinds of houses in the Human Spirit Sect, and most of them have confusing names like the one you mentioned. I really can't distinguish them," Tearrag answered after he thought for a little while.
<br><br>
"Oh, alright. Thank you anyway," Zen replied in a soft voice.
<br><br>
'Come on. No wonder these monkey spirits were the first ones to be eliminated by the Snake Spirit Sect, ' he thought to himself as he returned to the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
At least for now, they knew who wrote the stone tablets. Since they were the ones who knew so many secrets about the ancestry-level bloodline, Zen surmised that this Bold Conjecture House must have a very high status in the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
As he returned, he just shook his head while the other two stared at him.
<br><br>
They immediately understood that he didn't get any useful information.
<br><br>
With that, Zen just took out the seventh stone tablet and began deciphering it.
<br><br>
From the translated inscriptions, it said that with the creation of the originlevel bloodlines, the strength of the Four Spirits Sect was greatly enhanced.
<br><br>
It was described that each of the four origin-level bloodlines was even stronger than a single ability endowed by the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The only problem was that the four origin-level bloodlines required a very high level of comprehension. Many people had dedicated their entire lives to fully comprehend them, but still failed. In the end, they weren't able to fuse with the bloodlines.
<br><br>
But they clearly knew that if anyone succeeded in merging with them, they would definitely become invincible in the entire main world.
<br><br>
Up to that point, Kincaid's achievement had already been astonishing and incomparable.
<br><br>
Although Sheehan was the one who discovered and brought back the ancestry-level bloodline, Kincaid's progress on its usage was undoubtedly a more brilliant feat.
<br><br>
However, even with all those achievements, Kincaid was still dissatisfied.
<br><br>
His ultimate goal was to grasp the ancestry-level bloodline itself. For him, it was the most perfect power in the world, and he wouldn't settle for less until he got what he wanted.
<br><br>
In his long years in the main world, Kincaid had almost tried all sorts of methods just to study it.
<br><br>
He even tried to merge all of the three hundred and seventy-three sourcelevel bloodlines in an attempt to create a new ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
But in the end, he failed.
<br><br>
Zen continued reading the contents of the stone tablet which almost seemed like diary entries of someone from the Bold Conjecture House.
<br><br>
"After countless trials, we discovered that the ancestry-level bloodline has a life of its own.
<br><br>
We should have noticed that earlier. It's alive and it has its own mind. But still, the real problem is how we could effectively communicate with it..."
<br><br>
"The construction of the Eternal Divine Courtyard was already completed, and Master Cornelius required that the ancestry-level bloodline be stored in the sacred cup. Master Cornelius ordered that no one is allowed to get close to the ancestry-level bloodline if there is no important reason, not even Master Kincaid. Even the members of the Bold Conjecture House are prohibited from entering the Eternal Divine Courtyard. That's just too much!"
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid said that since we couldn't find a better way to produce greater results, we have to use the simplest method. He said that we needed to refine a body that could withstand the overwhelming power of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
But that's just impossible. I asked Master Kincaid what kind of body would be able to withstand the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
He said that it must be a body that is as strong as the sacred cup.
<br><br>
I didn't really get it. Did he mean that we should refine a creature's flesh into metal? At first, I thought that Master Kincaid must have gone crazy.
<br><br>
However, the Bold Conjecture House really started achieving this requirement!"
<br><br>
'They did what?' Zen's mouth remained open after reading the contents of the stone tablet.
<br><br>
As he raised his head and looked at the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess, he saw the same astonishment on their faces.
<br><br>
Chapter 4103 A Method The process Zen went through in order to inherit the ancestry-level bloodline was very abrupt and quite strange.
<br><br>
Although he thought himself already quite talented, he knew there was a great gap between him and the human spirits.
<br><br>
Judging from the reactions the four statues in the Eternal Divine Courtyard had when they saw Zen absorb the ancestry-level bloodline, they were also quite shocked. It was virtually impossible for such a freak like him to exist in this world.
<br><br>
The Human Spirit King, the Monkey Spirit King, the Snake Spirit King, the Bird Spirit King, and all other geniuses had failed to do that, yet a human from a secondary world, had achieved such a feat.
<br><br>
Coupled with surprise was also a bit of confusion on Zen's part.
<br><br>
Was it because his physical body was special? His body was essentially a weapon but then didn't the Four Spirits Sect have skills that enabled them to create anything? Those people created the chaos from which even the Metal Civilization appeared.
<br><br>
It shouldn't be that difficult for them to have forged a body similar or even superior to Zen's.
<br><br>
So why in the world did the ancestry-level bloodline favor Zen? It was only when he looked through the human spirit's diary that Zen was able to find some clues.
<br><br>
"If that is the case, Zen, then I'm afraid your physical body becoming such a weapon is part of someone's plan," the real Snake Goddess said with a frown.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid that the Bold Conjecture House had found the solution. Go on and continue reading the diary," the Primeval Lord of Heaven urged.
<br><br>
Zen decided it best to continue deciphering the contents on the stone tablet.
<br><br>
"We tried thousands of containers but discovered that the ancestry-level bloodline repelled most of the materials.
<br><br>
Even dead wood and soil were rejected.
<br><br>
However, we've discovered that if the wood is burnt until it turns into charcoal or if the soil is heated until it becomes solid brick, then the repelling force would disappear!"
<br><br>
"Alvaro went out to the Eternal Divine Courtyard again. He had a fight with the statues that were guarding it. Even if the human spirits, monkey spirits, snake spirits, and bird spirits each have a statue there, they actually follow the Snake Spirit Sect's orders! These damned fellows! They did let him in eventually. Alvaro finally found the reason why we failed. His Infinite Eyes can see what is normally too far or too little to be seen. According to him, there are very small living creatures in the soil and wood which have gone unnoticed by ordinary people. These creatures are very weak and would promptly die if subjected to the smallest of flames.
<br><br>
This way, it was made clear to us that the ancestry-level bloodline repels all living creatures but not dead creatures.
<br><br>
Elder Xue forwarded this assumption and hypothesized that there might be a condition for absorbing the ancestry-level bloodline. According to him, it may require a creature that is both alive and dead at the same time.
<br><br>
That doesn't make any sense, though! What's dead will remain dead and what is alive shall continue to live until death. How can a creature be both at the same time? Our puppet technique can construct puppets that look and move the exact same way as a living, breathing person but, at the end of the day, those puppets remain dead things. If we put the ancestry-level bloodline into a puppet's body, it would be as good as pouring it all into the sacred cup.
<br><br>
This is not absorbing the ancestry-level bloodline, nor can we use the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
We can also create metal creatures but when we tried putting the ancestrylevel bloodline in them and even in creatures made of other different elements, they'd promptly explode and die.
<br><br>
Elder Xue remained persistent and began to teach us lessons again. Master Kincaid even got scolded. He said there were too many unknown and incomprehensible things in the main world and though the Four Spirits Sect was powerful, it was not omniscient.
<br><br>
Elder Xue disappeared the next day. He only left a letter behind saying he was going to try and find a solution.
<br><br>
That old man is very stubborn. He must have gone to the Deep Space.
<br><br>
There are a lot of strange things up there like the Time Vessel. The place is simply too dangerous. Master Sheeran almost lost his life when he went there. How can Elder Xue dare go there alone..."
<br><br>
The diary ended there and made no further mention of Elder Xue's fate.
<br><br>
Further entries expressed records of dissatisfaction of the Bold Conjecture House with the Snake Spirit Sect who began to change the rules of entering the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
By their rules, it became increasingly more difficult to gain entry.
<br><br>
Sheehan had originally taken out the ancestry-level bloodline and made it accessible to everyone in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, after the establishment of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, this open access enjoyed by the sect eventually disappeared.
<br><br>
Over time, the ancestry-level bloodline became a sacred relic to the Four Spirits Sect and was fiercely guarded and protected.
<br><br>
Save for the time when the Eternal Divine Courtyard opened to allow warriors to get some power, it would normally be impossible for anyone to even look at it.
<br><br>
A fierce quarrel between Kincaid and Cornelius erupted because of this but the latter ended up gaining the upper hand.
<br><br>
Nobody knew what sort of method Cornelius used to persuade Sheehan to agree with him but the Four Spirit Sect eventually gave the Eternal Divine Courtyard supreme power in order to facilitate development for the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
However, taking control of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the Snake Spirit Sect were selfish, and they devised a few sketchy rules and left a back door for their sect.
<br><br>
Their sketchy rules made it very difficult for human, bird, and monkey spirits to accept the ancestry-level bloodline's test while their people met no obstructions whatsoever which only led to Kincaid's growing frustration.
<br><br>
Inevitably, an intense conflict broke out.
<br><br>
Dissatisfied and frustrated by the current state of things, Kincaid poured his annoyance into his work and soon came up with a method to activate the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
It was a rudimentary method but he still wanted to try it. Everything was well and good until he was stopped by the entrance and was told that he was forbidden from entering the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
In a fit of anger, he smashed the dome and caused some heavy damage onto the courtyard.
<br><br>
Elite members of the Snake Spirit Sect all came and surrounded him.
<br><br>
Cornelius was also there and criticized Kincaid for what he had done.
<br><br>
Afraid of the brewing fight between the two kings, Orlando immediately rushed over.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Monkey Spirit King unconditionally stood by the human spirits' side.
<br><br>
It was after the Monkey Spirit King involved himself that a gap in strength was observed. Cornelius had no choice but to concede and allow Kincaid to continue his experiment.
<br><br>
However, the former made it clear that this was the only exception and that it wasn't a privilege that would be granted to him ever again.
<br><br>
That made Kincaid unhappy.
<br><br>
However, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and agree. Nobody was exempt from the rules, not even the four kings.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, despite all the ruckus he caused to touch the ancestry-level bloodline, Kincaid's method ultimately failed.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline showed no reaction at all.
<br><br>
This result confused Kincaid since he was quite sure that his method would've been very effective.
<br><br>
How could the ancestry-level bloodline show no reaction at all? Was it perhaps resistant to Kincaid? That seemed to be the only logical explanation. Since magical blood was sentient, it could reject external interference.
<br><br>
Kincaid's method was recorded on No. 17 stone tablet.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes lit up when he read this.
<br><br>
"No. 17 stone tablet!" he cried out.
<br><br>
He had deciphered sixteen stone tablets and No. 17 stone tablet was up next.
<br><br>
This tablet contained Kincaid's method and the real Primeval Lord of Heaven and Snake Goddess became extremely interested when they realized this.
<br><br>
Soon enough, Zen picked up the tablet.
<br><br>
This one was very different from the ones he held before.
<br><br>
There were only four Sanskrit words on the tablet and they glowed a dull blue.
<br><br>
Zen also noticed that the way these words were written was very strange with extremely thin lines twisted together.
<br><br>
The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization deciphered the tablet for him and the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Snake Goddess patiently waited for him to speak.
<br><br>
After a minute or so, Zen pursed his lips. "They're undecipherable..."
<br><br>
The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization relied on a large amount of calculation to decipher words. However, the problem was that these four Sanskrit words were in a form that it had never seen before so it had no idea how to calculate it.
<br><br>
Chapter 4104 Coral Blood Sword Since the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization couldn't decipher the Sanskrit words on the seventeenth stone tablet, they had no choice but to leave it to the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
Although there was little hope, Zen still decided to take the stone tablet to them to ask.
<br><br>
Upon receiving the stone tablet from Zen, Tearrag didn't show any impatience. He looked it over for a bit before declaring, "These are not Sanskrit words."
<br><br>
"Not Sanskrit words?" Zen echoed, raising his eyebrows slightly.
<br><br>
Earlier, the records on the stone tablets Zen read were all written in Sanskrit. Could there possibly be another language in the Four Spirits Sect? Tearrag held up the stone tablet. "It's a Blood-controlling Method," he said. "Look at these curved lines. Don't you think they look like a monkey?"
<br><br>
Zen, the real Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess all turned their gazes to the stone tablet to study it once more.
<br><br>
Now that Tearrag pointed it out, they could vaguely make out a figure.
<br><br>
Although these lines were messy, they were actually very similar to the meridians in one's body.
<br><br>
"I think it looks more like a human..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't help but speak up.
<br><br>
"Monkey!" Tearrag snapped decisively, casting him a glare.
<br><br>
One of the reasons why the Human Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect were very close to each other was that their bodies were similar in form.
<br><br>
Thus, if the human spirits could use the methods created by Kincaid, the monkey spirits wouldn't have any problem performing the same.
<br><br>
However, it was a different story for the bird and snake spirits.
<br><br>
"How does one use this Blood-controlling Method?" Zen cleared his throat.
<br><br>
"Just operate according to the meridians on the pattern. These four pictures are four small circulations, and they form one big circulation..."
<br><br>
As Tearrag spoke, his fingers were tracing the lines on the stone tablet.
<br><br>
Suddenly, his expression changed. "This operation method is so strange.
<br><br>
Does this really have anything to do with the ancestry-level bloodline?"
<br><br>
In fact, the Blood-controlling Method created by Kincaid was no secret in the Four Spirits Sect. However, the Monkey Masters had no interest in matters outside their sect. While they had great talent in cultivation, they only really cared about the methods they could make use of.
<br><br>
If one couldn't merge with the ancestry-level bloodline, the Bloodcontrolling Method was deemed useless to them, so the Monkey Masters didn't concern themselves with it.
<br><br>
However, what appeared to be a useless waste to the Monkey Masters turned out to be extremely important to Zen. Talk about one man's trash being another one's treasure! The real Snake Goddess suddenly spoke up. "Back then, when no one could absorb the ancestry-level bloodline, what was the point of creating this Blood-controlling Method?"
<br><br>
"Puppets," Tearrag answered gravely. "I remember, some people from the Human Spirit Sect had asked us to collect all kinds of materials to make puppets. The Blood-controlling Method wasn't used on living beings.
<br><br>
They wanted to use it on puppets." His eyes narrowed. "But it should have failed..."
<br><br>
At that time, the Human Spirit Sect had used all the methods they could think of.
<br><br>
However, puppets weren't living things, after all. So the Blood-controlling Method didn't work on them.
<br><br>
As Tearrag trailed off, he shifted his gaze towards Zen.
<br><br>
He suddenly clapped his hands and said excitedly, "Since this Bloodcontrolling Method didn't work on puppets, how about we try using it on you?"
<br><br>
Actually, this thought had crossed the minds of Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess earlier.
<br><br>
"I'll try it now..." Zen said decidedly.
<br><br>
Previously, all the miracles that happened to Zen's body were thanks to the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
However, the ancestry-level bloodline was not under Zen's control, and sometimes, it had a mind of its own. If this Blood-controlling Method actually worked, then Zen could say he stumbled upon the jackpot of methods! Tearrag didn't try to stop Zen. In fact, the Monkey Spirit King was hoping Zen would find a solution here.
<br><br>
Zen sat cross-legged and closed his eyes to concentrate. Then, an invisible force lifted the stone tablet and it floated in front of him.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had tried various ways to control the ancestry-level bloodline, but none of them worked. After so many failed attempts, he didn't know what to expect this time.
<br><br>
Zen shoved his doubts to the back of his mind as he envisioned the pattern of meridians in the first small circulation.
<br><br>
The pattern started from the right shoulder and terminated in the left leg.
<br><br>
Once he could clearly picture the pattern of meridians, he manipulated his blood to flow along the pattern.
<br><br>
Strangely enough, this time, the originally uncontrollable ancestry-level bloodline followed meekly. The ancestry-level bloodline was like a docile kitten as it flowed in the direction that Zen guided.
<br><br>
Even the real Primeval Lord of Heaven, the real Snake Goddess, and Tearrag, who were not far away, sensed that something was out of the norm.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline might be gentle and obedient now, but they all knew that things could change in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
This pattern was very complicated, and the lines contained rules that Zen found difficult to read.
<br><br>
As he guided his blood, Zen quietly marveled at the intricacy of the pattern.
<br><br>
If it was his own bloodline, he would be able to explore it bit by bit as he slowly took control of it. And it would not be surprising that he would finally master the Blood-controlling Method.
<br><br>
However, Kincaid had never absorbed the ancestry-level bloodline. Zen didn't know how he had drawn these lines. What kind of talent it required to enable him to complete such work? About a quarter of an hour later, Zen carefully neared finishing the first small circulation.
<br><br>
The moment he completed it, he suddenly felt a chill rushing up from his meridians.
<br><br>
Frowning, he then felt something stirring in his mind.
<br><br>
That thing was a square, with a simple rune wrapped in the middle. The rune was in the form of a ring hidden in the middle of a triangle.
<br><br>
"What's this?"
<br><br>
It didn't look like Sanskrit, neither did it look like it was in any language he knew.
<br><br>
So far, it seemed as though Zen had never come across such a rune before.
<br><br>
"The second small circulation begins..."
<br><br>
Zen decided to shrug it off and proceeded to cultivate the second small circulation.
<br><br>
Another quarter of an hour later, Zen finished the second small circulation and another square appeared in Zen's mind.
<br><br>
It was also a rune wrapped in a square, but this time, this square joined the first square, like two puzzle pieces connecting.
<br><br>
Zen ignored this and began to cultivate the third small circulation, and then later, the fourth one.
<br><br>
After he finished the large circulation in this Blood-controlling Method, the four squares that formed in Zen's mind pieced together in sequence to form one large square.
<br><br>
The four patterns in the square were also perfectly connected, like a completed puzzle! When Zen tried to use his consciousness to explore the big square, a sense of familiarity arose, as though he somehow obtained the ability to understand the runes.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, his eyes popped wide open, and his hands trembled violently.
<br><br>
"What's wrong, Zen?" the real Snake Goddess asked with concern.
<br><br>
"Are you all right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven piped in.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Tearrag glanced at Zen indifferently.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was very interested in the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline, but these Monkey Masters thought differently.
<br><br>
It was because of the ancestry-level bloodline that the Four Spirits Sect was reduced to this situation. In the eyes of the Monkey Masters, this thing was the source of their downfall, and would not bring any benefits to the Monkey Spirit Sect. Thus, they looked at it with disdain.
<br><br>
"I'm fine..." Zen said shakily.
<br><br>
Wincing slightly, he opened his right hand, palm facing up.
<br><br>
His palm began to crack, and traces of bright red blood began to fill the palm.
<br><br>
Raising his hand gently to study it, thin blood streaks painted his palm, like an intricate coral reef.
<br><br>
Then, a thought crossed Zen's mind. Like lightning, the streaks of blood responded immediately. In the blink of an eye, the blood streaks moved around to form the shape of a blood sword, which was exactly what Zen had been thinking! Because it was woven from threads of blood, the blood sword was filled with pulsating coral branches. It truly resembled an intricately-shaped coral.
<br><br>
The moment Tearrag's eyes landed on the coral blood sword, he immediately took a few steps back.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters had a strong fighting instinct, and Tearrag immediately sensed that this strange blood sword was dangerous.
<br><br>
The real Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess didn't budge, but they recalled to mind that time Zen and the resentment-level Treacherous Being had fought back on the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
At the time, Zen's body had been devoured; only coral-like streaks of blood were left of him.
<br><br>
Chapter 4105 Reckless At that time, Zen had directly got into the body of the resentment-level Treacherous Being. He killed it instantly with the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
If not for his quick action, Zen and his companions would probably have all been killed on the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
Now these coral-shaped blood streaks had reappeared, and they actually formed a sword at Zen's will! "It's a basic Blood-controlling Method. If used on any other bloodlines, it wouldn't be very strong. I wonder how powerful the ancestry-level bloodline would be if this method is used on it?" Tearrag said, staring intently at the coral blood sword.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was feeling somewhat confused. "Master Terrag, may I ask you something? After one merges with a bloodline, one will naturally be able to display its theurgy. What then is the use of this Blood-controlling Method?"
<br><br>
Usually, after a warrior merged with a bloodline, its power would become the warrior's basic talent.
<br><br>
For Eternal Realm warriors, such a Blood-controlling Method seemed unnecessary.
<br><br>
Tearrag was not interested in these theories of the Human Spirit Sect, but he knew a lot about secret skills and theurgies. He snorted at the Primeval Lord of Heaven's question. Coldly, he said, "The Blood-controlling Method is the most basic use of the bloodlines, and it can also stimulate the bloodline to the limit. The Eternal Realm warriors in your system only make use of less than thirty percent of their bloodlines!"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was stunned, so was the Snake Goddess, whose bright eyes widened at Tearrag's words.
<br><br>
Was it true? The bloodline that they had always been proud of, which they had classified as the bloodline of the Eternal Realm, was only thirty percent activated? "Or maybe a bit more," Tearrag added.
<br><br>
"But..." The Snake Goddess sounded unconvinced. "Why isn't there any Blood-controlling Method in the chaos?" she asked, looking directly at Tearrag.
<br><br>
This simple question stumped him. For a moment he was silent, at a loss for words.
<br><br>
He knew the Blood-controlling Method, but he didn't know how to build secondary worlds. He didn't even know why there was the need to build secondary worlds. He only knew that they could obtain energy from the secondary worlds.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke up. "Could it be that one can only learn the Blood-controlling Method by becoming a member of the Four Spirits Sect?" he suggested.
<br><br>
Tearrag nodded. "Yes. If those monkeys in the secondary worlds are smart enough, after joining our Monkey Spirit Sect, we will naturally teach them the Blood-controlling Method. Those in the secondary worlds are not qualified to learn the skill."
<br><br>
The real Snake Goddess and the Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed inwardly.
<br><br>
They had only used thirty percent or less of the bloodline power they were proud of. The gap was bigger than they could have imagined.
<br><br>
"Is the Blood-controlling Method only a skill of using bloodlines?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
Zen seemed to only have extracted his bloodline and converted it into a sword just now.
<br><br>
This time, Tearrag shook his head. "Of course not. Different Bloodcontrolling Methods have different focuses. Most of them focus on bringing out the potential ability of one's own bloodline, but a small portion are concerned with the direct usage of the bloodline power. For example, the Blood-controlling Method of the Divine Flame Blood is to directly extract the blood and turn it into divine flames that can be wielded as a weapon against others."
<br><br>
As he spoke of the Divine Flame Blood, a slight frown appeared on his face. It was the strongest and most outrageously powerful of the root-level bloodlines, yet it also caused terrible side effects.
<br><br>
In the past, many members of the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect had inherited the Divine Flame Blood. If they fought in a battle using the Divine Flame Blood, they had to consume their own bloodline until they were completely drained, leading to their death.
<br><br>
The Blood-controlling Method left on the stone tablet by Kincaid should be working in the similar way. It only made Zen extract the bloodline directly instead of strengthening the ability of his bloodline. After all, the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline were too complicated.
<br><br>
"The power of the ancestry-level bloodline is quite extraordinary," said Tearrag. "For instance, Rodney—a member of the Human Spirit Sect— once used a drop of ancestry-level bloodline as a hidden weapon. When he injected it into his opponent's body, it caused his enemy to explode and die!"
<br><br>
No living being could bear the power of the ancestry-level bloodline. If they came into contact with it, it caused an explosion, and they died. Thus, it was definitely one of the most powerful hidden weapons a warrior could use.
<br><br>
However, the drop of ancestry-level bloodline that Rodney had tried hard to extract was eventually taken away by the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"I wonder how powerful Zen's blood sword is," the Primeval Lord of Heaven mused.
<br><br>
"We could try it on the Star Stones in the Ghost Mountain," the Snake Goddess proposed.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests of the Ghost Mountain also had their cultivation places. The Star Stones were very solid, and could be used to test the power of the hatred-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
"No need to go through all that trouble," said Tearrag, smirking. He pointed at his own chest. "Go on, stab me right now!"
<br><br>
Zen raised an eyebrow. He and his companions looked at Tearrag as though he was insane, wondering if he was serious.
<br><br>
They knew that Monkey Masters were famous for their bravery and recklessness, but this went beyond that. Tearrag was brave to the point of foolishness.
<br><br>
But Tearrag ignored their stares. "Don't worry," he said in a tone of indifference. "You can't kill me as long as you don't use the Light of Annihilation, and if you do manage to kill me, I can revive in the Ghost Mountain. So hurry up! I want to see the power of your blood sword."
<br><br>
"Master Tearrag, this blood sword is formed from the ancestry-level bloodline," Zen said slowly. "I don't know what special ability it would have..."
<br><br>
Zen certainly had no intention of stabbing Tearrag with the coral blood sword.
<br><br>
He had seen the power of the ancestry-level bloodline, and it was tremendous. There was nothing it could not dissolve.
<br><br>
Although Treacherous Beings were powerful and seemingly indestructible, it was still possible for them to be killed.
<br><br>
But Tearrag had no patience for Zen's hesitation. Even as Zen tried to dissuade him, he reached out and grabbed Zen's wrist. To everyone's shock, he pulled Zen's arm forward.
<br><br>
Zen looked astonished as Tearrag drove the sword into his chest.
<br><br>
In an instant, the coral blood sword was embedded deeply in Tearrag's body.
<br><br>
The real Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess watched the scene with expressions of disbelief.
<br><br>
It was well known that these Monkey Masters were powerful figures, and they were also reputed to be frank and straightforward in their personality.
<br><br>
But this was too much. Why had Tearrag dared to do such a thing? Was he truly insane? If there were more Monkey Masters like him in the Monkey Spirit Sect, then no wonder their sect was trapped on the small Night View Island for so long! "Master—Master Tearrag!" Zen spluttered, staring at him.
<br><br>
"It's just a blood sword," Tearrag said calmly. "It's sharp and can break through my defense. It's power is quite impressive. But... but I..."
<br><br>
In the instant after he stabbed himself, Tearrag had seemed unchanged, as though he didn't care about the sword buried in his body. But as he spoke, he suddenly trailed off, his voice taking on a strange tone.
<br><br>
The moment the blood sword pierced Tearrag's chest, it had sent coral branches throughout the meridians of his body. Within seconds, they had spread out over his entire body.
<br><br>
Zen and the others gaped at Tearrag. The surface of his skin was covered with a net of fine red lines, and his body was growing stiffer and stiffer.
<br><br>
He opened his mouth but was no longer able to speak, although his eyes remained wide open.
<br><br>
There was an enormous boom.
<br><br>
Tearrag's body had exploded.
<br><br>
His body, in the form of a Treacherous Being, cracked along the lines of the red net on his skin. Chunks of his body flew in all directions, splattering all across the hall.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Treacherous Being was not made of flesh and blood. If a normal body had disintegrated like this, the entire hall would be stained with gore.
<br><br>
"Master Tearrag!"
<br><br>
Zen, the real Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the real Snake Goddess gazed around them at the pieces of Tearrag's body, wearing looks of helplessness and anxiety.
<br><br>
"I'm going to find other Monkey Masters for help!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
These Monkey Masters were all elites in the Monkey Spirit Sect. They had to explain what had happened, so no one would think that a Monkey Master had been killed by Zen.
<br><br>
They were startled when a familiar voice suddenly spoke.
<br><br>
"No need for that," said Tearrag.
<br><br>
The pieces scattered across the hall began to wriggle towards each other.
<br><br>
In a few moments, they had all joined together to reform Tearrag's body.
<br><br>
Indeed, the Treacherous Beings were truly terrifying. Their bodies were flexible and virtually indestructible. Even a Treacherous Being who had been cut into thousands of pieces, like Tearrag, could regenerate almost immediately.
<br><br>
Of course, if Zen had used the Light of Annihilation, the result might be different.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven heaved a deep sigh of relief upon seeing that Tearrag had completely recovered.
<br><br>
Tearrag came up to Zen and studied his coral blood sword closely. There was a trace of envy in his eyes.
<br><br>
So, the most basic Blood-controlling Method could actually achieve such power. How terrifying would it be if all the potential of the ancestry-level bloodline in Zen's body was brought out fully? Chapter 4106 Request After Zen had completely mastered the Blood-controlling Method, he went to meet the Monkey Spirit King again.
<br><br>
The latter was surprised to see Zen's coral blood sword. It was an unusual thing.
<br><br>
However, as a monkey, he knew no more about the ancestry-level bloodline than Tearrag did.
<br><br>
Even if he knew nothing about it at all, it wouldn't matter. All he cared about was whether Zen could grant him the blended bloodlines. He was not interested in the ancestry-level bloodline itself; not unless he could fuse with it.
<br><br>
His past had been rather unfortunate. He was unable to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline before his corporeal body got destroyed. He might have had a chance at that time. But now, he had become a Treacherous Being, which meant it was impossible for him to do so anymore.
<br><br>
"Alas, I was under the impression that Kincaid had left the methods of merging bloodlines somewhere here," the Monkey Spirit King sighed.
<br><br>
There was a look of regret and helplessness on his face.
<br><br>
Zen cupped his hands towards him and said, "Don't worry. I am sure we can still find a way."
<br><br>
"Really? Is there something you can do?" the Monkey Spirit King asked disdainfully.
<br><br>
He admired Kincaid from the bottom of his heart.
<br><br>
In his eyes, only Kincaid could help him in this world. Zen was nothing to him and he was only paying the man any attention because there was a slight chance Zen could help him.
<br><br>
Besides, Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess were all fake human spirits.
<br><br>
The only reason the Monkey Spirit King hadn't chased them away was that they had saved his life. In any case, it was preposterous to expect them to come up with a way to merge the bloodlines.
<br><br>
Zen himself knew the Monkey Spirit King was rather arrogant. And to be honest, if he were the Monkey Spirit King, he would also have looked down upon the humans.
<br><br>
However, he said in a tone that was neither humble nor pushy, "Although we are not human spirits, we still are sentient, intelligent beings. The Primeval Lord of Heaven managed to merge the source-level bloodlines even though there were only a few dozen of them. You should have noticed this before."
<br><br>
Looking back, when the Monkey Spirit King had been trapped in the dream, he had felt the auras of the blended bloodlines, which had brought him a little glimmer of hope.
<br><br>
"Is it true? Did you do that?" the Monkey Spirit King asked, staring at the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
"Good job." The Monkey Spirit King suddenly complimented him with a laugh and then continued in a serious tone, "If you want me to give you some benefits, you can ask directly. Whatever you do, don't lie to me about blended bloodlines. Although I'm not good at studying, I'm not a fool! And I can easily spot a liar!"
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King suddenly began burning with anger. Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess immediately felt a heavy stone-like pressure pressing down on their hearts.
<br><br>
It was true! The Monkey Spirit King was not stupid, and neither were the Monkey Masters. In fact, they were extremely intelligent creatures, and their intuition was quite strong.
<br><br>
Lying to them was impossible! Zen had the ancestry-level bloodline in his body. If the Primeval Lord of Heaven really was confident about merging bloodlines, he would never have bargained in this vague way.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King knew this very well.
<br><br>
"Please calm down, Monkey Spirit King," Zen called out, cupping his hands once again. "You misunderstood me."
<br><br>
"Oh, really?" the Monkey Spirit King sneered coldly.
<br><br>
He hated a lot of things but what he hated most was when others treated him as a fool. Kincaid was an exception.
<br><br>
"From what we could learn and decipher from the stone tablets in the coffin, we can merge bloodlines, and the process is not difficult. However, it will take a long time, and we will need a lot of manpower as well as material resources," Zen explained.
<br><br>
"I am patient! I can wait," the Monkey Spirit King replied as he waved his hand.
<br><br>
The wind pressure he was exerting on the people in front of him was lifted. A noise like rolling giant stones could be heard in the hall when that happened.
<br><br>
He had been waiting for countless years. He had all the time in the world.
<br><br>
"You can, but the chaos cannot! And the Snake Masters and the Bird Masters can't either. They will definitely not be satisfied with this," said Zen.
<br><br>
"They can come if they want to. No one is blocking them!" the Monkey Spirit King replied indifferently.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit Sect was like the weapon of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
And the Monkey Spirit King himself was the strongest weapon in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Those birds and snakes meant nothing to him.
<br><br>
Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess fell silent when they saw his expression.
<br><br>
They knew that the Monkey Spirit Sect had once been defeated by the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King clearly realized what they were thinking about and said in a low, diffident voice, "Look! If we were in the main world, those snakes would have been torn to pieces by my hands. Even if Cornelius himself were to confront me, he would face no good end. But it is hard to say what would happen in the chaos."
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King had been completely invincible in the main world.
<br><br>
"We are familiar with the chaos. As the continuation of human spirits, we will try our best to help you. But you must understand that it's difficult for us to fight them or stand against them. Please grant us the Bloodcontrolling Methods, and let us fuse with a few Treacherous Beings. That way, we will at least stand a chance against the Snake Spirit Sect. And we will fight alongside your sect."
<br><br>
Zen made a request again.
<br><br>
The Ghost Mountain had once had several strict rules.
<br><br>
Only the Great Ghost Priests were allowed to fuse with hatred-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Among the human heroes, only four of them had obtained hatred-level Treacherous Beings, while the others merely had resentment-level ones.
<br><br>
But the most important thing right now was the Blood-controlling Methods.
<br><br>
They could increase the power of one's own bloodline by a factor of three, which was an extremely strong boost for the human heroes.
<br><br>
Zen was trying his best right now, and saying whatever he needed in order to persuade the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
The human race didn't only need help from the Monkey Spirit Sect. They also needed the sect to treat them as allies, just like they had been allies with the Human Spirit Sect before. This was much more important than any help they could give.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King looked at Zen with his big eyes. He knew clearly what Zen was implying.
<br><br>
But to him, Zen was like a child making an unreasonable request to an adult. It was ridiculous.
<br><br>
However, the Monkey Spirit King had an intuition that he should trust this human.
<br><br>
And that was only because of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Kincaid knew the most about the ancestry-level bloodline. Zen's fusion with the ancestry-level bloodline was sure to have something to do with Kincaid.
<br><br>
Kincaid's decision was always the right one.
<br><br>
Thinking about that, the Monkey Spirit King felt relieved, and then put on a lazy look. "Tearrag, take them to fetch the Blood-controlling Methods.
<br><br>
They can choose whatever Treacherous Beings they like in the Ghost Mountain."
<br><br>
If he were to be honest, the Monkey Spirit King had a few measures he could use to control Zen. However, he had always trusted his instincts, and he was going to do the same today.
<br><br>
Right now, he was treating these humans as members of the Human Spirit Sect, so he would not resort to those despicable methods.
<br><br>
Very soon, Zen and the others left the Ghost Mountain and went to the grotto in the south of the Night View Island.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen announced news of fusion with hatred-level Treacherous Beings, the humans in the grotto got excited.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yasamin, King Ieuan and the three Eternal Realm Hunters looked at Zen with expectant eyes. They were wondering whether they could fuse with Treacherous Beings as well.
<br><br>
After all, they had come from outside the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen knew what they wanted. He smiled faintly and then set them at ease. "Everyone can choose a Treacherous Being and fuse with it.
<br><br>
I also have another piece of good news."
<br><br>
"What is it?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"The Monkey Masters will give you the Blood-controlling Methods," Zen replied with a smile.
<br><br>
"What are they?" Fuxi asked in a confused tone.
<br><br>
"They are methods to activate the bloodlines of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
They can improve your bloodline power," Zen explained.
<br><br>
Chiyou asked curiously, "Really? How much improvement? I mean how much of a difference would it make?"
<br><br>
"A lot! They can improve your bloodline power by about three times,"
<br><br>
Zen replied with another big smile.
<br><br>
Chapter 4107 Eliminate Hidden Dangers "Three times?!"
<br><br>
The crowd couldn't help but exclaim and ask repeatedly if what they heard was correct.
<br><br>
All of the Eternal Realm warriors that were present had already lived for countless years.
<br><br>
In those years, they had already used their bloodlines to the fullest, especially the human heroes.
<br><br>
And in the current civilization, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the Eternal Realm Hunters were in the same situation.
<br><br>
It actually meant that there was almost no room for further development anymore.
<br><br>
That was why it was very hard for them to imagine that a Bloodcontrolling Method could easily increase their blood power by three times.
<br><br>
After being extremely surprised, expressions of joy instantly filled everyone's faces.
<br><br>
"Zen, can you really confirm that?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in disbelief. "Yes. It should be true," Zen answered confidently.
<br><br>
"Everyone's bloodline comes from the Four Spirits Sect. Generally, only after one joins the Four Spirits Sect can he or she be taught with the Blood-controlling Method. However, this time, it is sort of a special exception," he continued.
<br><br>
Currently, the Monkey Spirit King did not have much confidence to deal with the ferocious Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
And although the strength of these human beings was much inferior compared to the Monkey Masters, they became worthy of being favored by the Monkey Spirit Sect. Moreover, Zen possessed the precious ancestry-level bloodline, meaning that his potential was limitless.
<br><br>
"I can't believe that there are such methods in this world!"
<br><br>
"It seems that there is still so much that we don't know."
<br><br>
"Well, the Blood-controlling Methods are from the main world outside the chaos. We should just be grateful that we can get a hold of this knowledge."
<br><br>
Everyone talked about it. Even the usually calm ones couldn't help but join the joyous conversations.
<br><br>
There was a huge cave inside the Heavenly Square City.
<br><br>
The cave extended from the left side of the Heavenly Square City to the right side. Then it winded its way west.
<br><br>
It almost extended to every corners of the Heavenly Square City.
<br><br>
However, none of the rooms of different sizes inside the city was connected to it.
<br><br>
Cornelius, the Snake Spirit King, dwelled and was hidden in this cave.
<br><br>
Beneath the Heavenly Square City, his body spread along the cave and to all the corners of the city.
<br><br>
From the outside, it would look like an ordinary city, but its true face was a lair of Cornelius.
<br><br>
Sewell entered from the top of the Heavenly Square City and climbed down to the center of the huge cave.
<br><br>
This was where Cornelius's head was located.
<br><br>
His head was covered with dark red scales, and each of these scales had unique patterns with red-blood light flowing within them. From these scales, a devastating aura was being constantly emitted.
<br><br>
On the head of the Snake Spirit King was a peculiar pair of cockscombs.
<br><br>
Currently, his huge dreadful eyes were closed.
<br><br>
As Sewell arrived in front of Cornelius, he slightly bit his lip before approaching.
<br><br>
"My king..." Sewell whispered as he knelt in front of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Soon after, Cornelius slowly opened his eyes.
<br><br>
Two crescent-shaped figures appeared in his pair of huge snake eyes.
<br><br>
"So, you failed?" Cornelius asked straightforwardly.
<br><br>
"Yes, I'm sorry," Sewell replied in a soft voice.
<br><br>
"It doesn't really matter. We still have a chance," Cornelius said in an indifferent tone.
<br><br>
"But..." Sewell reluctantly continued. "The Monkey Spirit King has awakened."
<br><br>
Before escaping from the Ghost Mountain, he had already sent some spies to keep watch in the area. Through them, although he wasn't able to detect every movement in the Ghost Mountain, he still had a general grasp of what was happening on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Until now, Sewell was still confused.
<br><br>
If the Thirteen Teeth Necklace couldn't wake the Monkey Spirit King before, then why were they able to succeed this time using the same item? He couldn't think of what mistake he had committed allowing this failure to happen.
<br><br>
After Cornelius heard Sewell's news, his eyes slightly dilated.
<br><br>
He seemed to be also surprised at that.
<br><br>
But soon after, his eyes returned to their normal state. "That monkey is only invincible in the main world. Right here, I can even kill him twice.
<br><br>
Don't be too depressed about it."
<br><br>
Cornelius was famous for being cruel, but when it came to his subordinates, he was actually quite lenient.
<br><br>
With this kind of attitude from the Snake Spirit King, Sewell felt more ashamed of his failure.
<br><br>
"However, we need to kill the monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City and remove their coordinates. Do this discreetly," Cornelius strictly instructed.
<br><br>
In the Heavenly Square City, there were also monkey spirits and human spirits aside from the snake spirits.
<br><br>
After their leaders had fallen, these monkey spirits and human spirits started treating the Heavenly Square City as the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Although they were still on guard against the Snake Spirit King, they had no choice but to stay here and work for the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Originally, Cornelius planned to control the Monkey Spirit King. Once their king was already at his disposal, then it meant that he could also control the monkey spirits.
<br><br>
But now that the Monkey Spirit King had completely awakened, these monkey spirits immediately became hidden dangers that were necessary to be eliminated. They had to do it quickly before the monkey spirits could plot something against the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
"Consider it done!"
<br><br>
With that, Sewell immediately withdrew from the cave and planned on how he would execute the task given to him.
<br><br>
An hour later, all of the monkey spirits in the city were gathered.
<br><br>
"Master Sewell, what's the matter? We were told that something urgent came up," the leader of the monkey spirits asked.
<br><br>
He was Alston, one of the previously most powerful warriors in the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
"That's right. Your coordinates have been moved to the Supreme Pure Realm," Sewell announced.
<br><br>
"The Supreme Pure Realm? Why?" Alston asked in confusion. Even the other monkey spirits started murmuring with each other.
<br><br>
"We actually found some clues about the Monkey Spirit King," Sewell replied.
<br><br>
The monkey spirits glanced at each other. There were mixed emotions as they heard Sewell's news.
<br><br>
"He is in the Supreme Pure Realm?"
<br><br>
"Did he wake up already?"
<br><br>
The monkey spirits simultaneously asked a lot of questions, expressing concern for their king.
<br><br>
"No. He's actually trapped on the Night View Island and is being guarded by the bird spirits," Sewell replied. "He needs your help, but the entrance to the Night View Island is sealed. I can help you enter the island, but you can only revive through the coordinates."
<br><br>
"I'll do it!"
<br><br>
"Me too! We're going to invade the island!"
<br><br>
"Hurry up! Kill us now!"
<br><br>
Looking at the monkey spirits' determined and impatient faces, Sewell almost couldn't suppress his laughter. 'Such a group of idiots! They're actually begging us to kill them?' However, he didn't reveal any emotion so as not to get caught. Then, he said, "Everyone, please wait a moment. After we fetch and activate the Light of Annihilation, we will kill you. We have already arranged a large number of snake spirits that will guide you to the entrance of the Night View Island. When you come back to life, we will cooperate together.
<br><br>
Those birds would surely not stand a chance."
<br><br>
With a flick of Sewell's tail, hundreds of snake spirits swarmed over.
<br><br>
Sharp white bones were inserted into their heads, inlaid with the Holy Stones.
<br><br>
As long as the white bones were stabbed into the bodies of the monkey spirits, the Light of Annihilation would immediately kill those Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute, Master Sewell. May I just ask why are we not informed about the matter of moving our coordinates?" Alston asked.
<br><br>
The monkey spirits had the strong intuition.
<br><br>
Although Sewell explained everything clearly, and he didn't show any expression that could harbor doubts, Alston was still quite hesitant. He just felt that something was amiss, and this situation was so rushed.
<br><br>
"I lurked into the Night View Island and was ultimately repelled by the Divine Hummingbirds, so I had no choice but to arrange your coordinates there in a hurry," Sewell replied.
<br><br>
Alston's suspicion grew continuously. "But how come there are so many snake spirits here just to kill us? Are you afraid that we will resist?"
<br><br>
As soon as Alston said this, the other monkey spirits had also become alert. They started to realize that there was something strange going on.
<br><br>
They were willing to defy all difficulties and danger for the Monkey Spirit King, and they were also ready to be killed just so they could enter the Night View Island.
<br><br>
It was quite abnormal for Sewell to arrange so many snake spirits that carried the Holy Stones.
<br><br>
"Come on. You're just thinking too much," Sewell said with a smile and still played it cool.
<br><br>
"Then how about we go to the Night View Island by ourselves? No matter how troublesome those birds are, I don't think we, the monkey spirits, would be defeated by them," Alston insisted.
<br><br>
Sewell's lips started to twitch as he became annoyed with the monkey spirits' stubbornness. "You don't need to do that..." He finally forced a smile as he lost his patience. "I've decided. All of you shall die here, right now!"
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, he wagged his tail and immediately ordered the snake spirits to attack them.
<br><br>
Without the Holy Stones, the monkey spirits were unable to kill the snake spirits even with their monstrous strength. Even if they tore the bodies of the snake spirits into pieces, they would just recover immediately.
<br><br>
On the other hand, once the monkey spirits were stabbed by the white bones infused with the Light of Annihilation, they would instantly die.
<br><br>
It turned out to be a cruel massacre.
<br><br>
The battle was fierce at first but the monkey spirits' resistance was futile.
<br><br>
The monkey spirits were able to battle it out against the snake spirits for an hour before they were all finally eliminated.
<br><br>
"Go and erase their coordinates," Sewell said coldly after watching all of the monkey spirits dissipate after the vicious battle. "You brought this to yourselves. I was actually merciful enough to give you a quick death, but you asked for such a tragic one."
<br><br>
Chapter 4108 The Red Stairs On the huge pillar, Geoffrey was climbing the steep staircase step by step.
<br><br>
In actuality, climbing up the huge pillar was a very complicated thing.
<br><br>
Every one thousand steps, there would be a statue blocking his way.
<br><br>
When it came to the rotten and scrapped statues, he dealt with them with ease. He only needed to carefully pass them without making any contact.
<br><br>
However, the intact and mobile ones were great trouble.
<br><br>
Every time Geoffrey encountered a statue that could move, he would forcefully pull the rope that connected him and Ziya.
<br><br>
Then, at the foot of the pillar, Ziya would pull Geoffrey down from the pillar.
<br><br>
Ziya wasn't able to clearly see what was happening on the pillar, so he was there as a support for Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he could still control his physical strength very well.
<br><br>
So whenever Geoffrey would be in danger, Ziya would immediately drag him down. And before he hit the ground, Ziya would firmly catch him.
<br><br>
When the statues started chasing after them, they would run towards the nearest cave.
<br><br>
However, the mobile statues were tenacious. Once they locked on their targets, they wouldn't give up easily until they were destroyed.
<br><br>
They circled down the stairs and chased after Geoffrey into the nearest world.
<br><br>
After several attempts of repeating the same process, Ziya realized that they were up for a long-term battle. Thus, he decided to put up a big array at the entrance of the world.
<br><br>
Geoffrey and Ziya entered the array first.
<br><br>
When the statues chased after them and entered the array, the array was instantly activated.
<br><br>
Streaks of golden lightning burst out from all directions and pierced into the weak parts of the statues.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! The statues were charred by the bolts of lightning, but they still weren't completely destroyed. With that, Ziya took out his God Lashing Whip.
<br><br>
He let out tens of thousands of golden whip shadows, lashing out the solid statues until they finally disintegrated.
<br><br>
"Fortunately, the statues have been corroded over time, so they were quite easy to destroy," Ziya said after crushing the statues to pieces.
<br><br>
The powers possessed by the statues in the past were absolutely greater compared to what they were experiencing now. Even Ziya couldn't fully resist them.
<br><br>
After destroying the most recent statue, Ziya noticed a frown on Geoffrey's face. "What's wrong?" he asked.
<br><br>
"I'm just tired," Geoffrey answered as he let out a sigh.
<br><br>
Personally, Geoffrey didn't have a persistent attitude.
<br><br>
Back then, he just came to explore the four pillars because he found them really interesting.
<br><br>
At first, he was fascinated by what he found out about it.
<br><br>
He could control other people's Other Shore Tokens at will, and he could climb up the stairs. He wondered what he would encounter if he was able to climb up to the top of the pillar.
<br><br>
He also thought that if he could find his father's Other Shore Tokens there, he would have the opportunity to change them to more powerful ones. He was excited to know how his father would react when he found out that his Other Shore Tokens were upgraded.
<br><br>
But all of that was just his wishful thinking. The reality that he found out was so much different from what he imagined.
<br><br>
The pillar was too high that he couldn't say for sure if he would be able to reach its top.
<br><br>
In the beginning, Geoffrey was still counting the steps that he had climbed.
<br><br>
Whenever he had climbed about one thousand steps, he would encounter the statues that would attack the intruders.
<br><br>
Since he had no means to defeat the statues, he would pull the rope and descend to the bottom, and then he would let Ziya deal with the statues.
<br><br>
After the statues were successfully destroyed, he would continue climbing up.
<br><br>
The higher he climbed, the longer it took him to get back when a statue started attacking.
<br><br>
There were even times when he had mistaken a stationary statue for a mobile one. Because of that, he accidentally pulled the rope, so Ziya immediately dragged him down. In those cases, he really regretted wasting so much energy and effort.
<br><br>
The process was getting so boring.
<br><br>
Geoffrey, who was the one climbing the pillar, was already running out of patience and wanted to give up.
<br><br>
Surely, Ziya also knew about that.
<br><br>
He knew how tiresome and dangerous it was.
<br><br>
However, the fact remained that the pillar could control the Other Shore Tokens in the chaos.
<br><br>
Its importance was very evident.
<br><br>
"We've been here for a long time, huh?" Ziya sighed. "I know it's tough for you, but—"
<br><br>
"Yes, I know," Geoffrey interrupted him before he could finish his sentence.
<br><br>
Then, he grabbed the rope that was lying on the ground and climbed up again without saying anything.
<br><br>
Ziya was surprised at first, and then a faint smile appeared on his face.
<br><br>
Over the years, Geoffrey had always acted on his own and rarely accepted any responsibility.
<br><br>
This was totally new to him, but at the same time, it was the perfect training.
<br><br>
While he climbed and fell repeatedly, he eventually learned how to be patient.
<br><br>
He also learned how to see the positive side of what they were doing.
<br><br>
In fact, there was an interesting feat that could be seen when he climbed up the pillar.
<br><br>
The pages were connected to many Other Shore Tokens. Through the silk threads on these pages, he could witness what was happening on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Once, he saw a group of humans through the rays of light on the stairs.
<br><br>
He tried communicating with them, but he got no response.
<br><br>
So, he realized that the rays of light could only project the scenes from the Other Shore, and they couldn't transmit his voice.
<br><br>
What he could do was upgrade their Other Shore Tokens by changing the rays of light.
<br><br>
However, there were too many Other Shore Tokens in there, and they came in various forms.
<br><br>
They were in the form of sand, a leaf, a stone, and generally anything else.
<br><br>
There were so many creatures residing on the Other Shore, so it was simply unrealistic to check them one by one. With that, he also gave up looking for the ones possessed by Zen.
<br><br>
Therefore, as time passed by, Geoffrey started ignoring the Other Shore Tokens and just kept climbing to the top.
<br><br>
When he climbed to a certain height, he noticed that all of the statues guarding the pillar were almost rotten, and they no longer chased him.
<br><br>
Thus, his determination got a boost, and his speed steadily increased.
<br><br>
A few months had passed, and Geoffrey was now able to reach such a great height.
<br><br>
He stuck his head out of the stairs and looked up. He wanted to check if he could already see the top of the pillar.
<br><br>
Finally, he saw that he was quite near. It was still high, but already achievable.
<br><br>
He also tried to look down the pillar.
<br><br>
However, he couldn't see anything except for the rope that was hanging.
<br><br>
After all, he was already at such a great height.
<br><br>
He and Ziya were only connected by this rope.
<br><br>
Then, he suddenly thought that if the rope had extended to such a great length, it should have become very heavy by now. But he noticed that it was still the same.
<br><br>
A strange thought came to Geoffrey's mind, so he looked down again and tried to inspect the rope more intently this time.
<br><br>
His expression suddenly changed as he realized that his guess was actually true. He saw that the rope was torn apart.
<br><br>
But Geoffrey was so busy climbing, so he didn't know when it broke.
<br><br>
'This is bad. Should I go back?' However, as soon as this thought entered his mind, he shook his head and slapped his cheeks with both hands.
<br><br>
Although he still felt tired, he realized how he had worked so hard to climb this height. It would all be in vain if he retreated now.
<br><br>
He still had great confidence that there were no more statues that were going to chase him, so he convinced himself to climb all the way to the top and have a look at what was waiting for him there.
<br><br>
Finally, Geoffrey made up his mind and continued climbing up the stairs without Ziya's protection.
<br><br>
In the upper half of the pillar, he noticed that the rays of light shining upon the stairs had gradually become scarce.
<br><br>
Previously, the light was densely distributed to every step. But now, every stair only had about one or two rays of light on them.
<br><br>
There were still extraordinary Other Shore Tokens at the end of the light, but Geoffrey just continued to move up.
<br><br>
After climbing for a few more days, he was now very close to the top of the pillar. Then suddenly, he noticed that the color of the stairs beneath his feet had changed.
<br><br>
The previously gray-colored stairs glowed bright red.
<br><br>
Moreover, on these bright red-colored stairs, there was no more light shining on them.
<br><br>
"The absence of light means that there are no Other Shore Tokens connected to them," Geoffrey muttered as he observed the stairs.
<br><br>
On the side of each stair, there were still many small black stones, but none of them was emitting light anymore.
<br><br>
As he continued to climb, the stairs that he had stepped on all became bright red in color, and there was still no light on them.
<br><br>
But after about five or six stairs, he finally saw a ray of light from one of the stairs.
<br><br>
The previous ones released an orange light, while this one emitted a bright red light.
<br><br>
Chapter 4109 I'm Human 'It seems that the higher I climb up, the stronger the Other Shore Tokens are at the other end of the light, ' Geoffrey thought.
<br><br>
Then again, he had long confirmed such a theory.
<br><br>
However, a distinct boundary between the steps formed by the pages did not previously exist. He only knew that the Other Shore Tokens were always better in the next page.
<br><br>
Now that there was a distinct boundary, his interest naturally increased a lot.
<br><br>
He squatted on the side of the page and pointed towards the red light.
<br><br>
The moment he touched the red light, he saw a long, simple sword.
<br><br>
A layer of white cloth wrapped around the hilt of the sword, and it appeared worn down.
<br><br>
It also had a rough and dented blade with thin cracks.
<br><br>
Despite the sword's flaws, surprisingly, it emitted great energy all the time! "Where is this sword located? It appears to be inside a tower…"
<br><br>
Then, he moved his fingers back and forth along the red light so he could adjust the angle of sight.
<br><br>
The inside of the tower was quite empty, but many Other Shore Tokens were neatly hung up on the wall.
<br><br>
"Is this a cultivation tower of some civilization?"
<br><br>
He had noticed before that there were some Other Shore Tokens placed with the other tokens in an orderly fashion.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, some civilizations and forces collected the Other Shore Tokens for their disciples to use.
<br><br>
This tower was no exception.
<br><br>
But compared to what he had observed before, there was more variety of Other Shore Tokens in this place.
<br><br>
While he observed the tower, the old man at the top of the tower suddenly saw something strange. At that moment, he dashed and went inside the tower.
<br><br>
Since he was connected to the Mysterious Yellow Tower, he could notice everything happening inside the tower as soon as it occurred.
<br><br>
For instance, he sensed that someone was observing the situation inside the tower just now.
<br><br>
The old man's movement also caught the attention of the young man in cyan robes. In the blink of an eye, the young man in cyan also rushed to the old man's side.
<br><br>
"What's wrong? Did anything happen?" the young man in cyan asked.
<br><br>
The old man looked around and said in a grave voice, "Someone is observing the Mysterious Yellow Tower."
<br><br>
The young man in cyan also followed the old man's gaze and smiled, "Did you have an illusion? Today is not the day to ring the bell. Why... "
<br><br>
"Shut up!" the old man scolded sternly.
<br><br>
The old man was usually quite amiable, while the young man was rather rude in front of him. However, the old man rarely scolded him in such a harsh tone.
<br><br>
The young man knew that something was wrong, so he shut his mouth.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the old man proceeded to go around the thirty-first and thirtysecond floors of the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Finally, he stopped in the middle of the thirty-third floor and looked at the sword inside it.
<br><br>
It was the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
It was an Other Shore Token with little information, so it was hard to evaluate its grade.
<br><br>
Furthermore, no one knew who had used it.
<br><br>
Neither did anyone know what kind of abilities it had.
<br><br>
The only thing that was clear about it was that one could merge with it with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, no one knew how to use it after the merge.
<br><br>
For example, the old man had fused with the sword with his unique talent, but he still could not use it. It seemed that it was just an ordinary sword.
<br><br>
Still, the old man did not believe that it was.
<br><br>
In the end, he placed the Lone Sword in the Mysterious Yellow Tower and waited for someone who could make use of it.
<br><br>
After a while of silence, his voice filled the floor.
<br><br>
"Here!" he said in a trembling voice.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the mysterious observer just stared at the sword shamelessly without even bothering to hide his gaze.
<br><br>
The young man in cyan robes looked at the Lone Sword for a while.
<br><br>
He had also tried to use the weapon, but like the old man, he had failed.
<br><br>
"Could it be that there is something in the sword? Maybe there is a soul trapped inside? Or even a Treacherous Being!"
<br><br>
The young man in cyan robes carefully examined the sword and even sniffed it a little, but he did not sense anything strange.
<br><br>
"No…" the old man muttered. "The mysterious presence came from the other side of the Other Shore Token!" he explained.
<br><br>
The young man's eyes narrowed in doubt at the old man's words. "That seems odd… Are you sure?" he asked. "Yes!" said the old man.
<br><br>
The young man was also shocked, "It..."
<br><br>
Of course, he did not dare to doubt the old man.
<br><br>
Besides, the old man would never talk nonsense about the matter.
<br><br>
The old man stared at the Lone Sword for a while, while the eyes behind its blade continued to observe.
<br><br>
"Hello? Can you hear me?" the old man asked.
<br><br>
"Hello? Can you answer me if you heard me?" he asked again.
<br><br>
"Who are you? Where are you?"
<br><br>
Now, Geoffrey, who stood on the step formed by the page, heard and saw everything.
<br><br>
He even saw the nostrils of the young man in cyan robes quite clearly.
<br><br>
The tower and its owner must have come from a powerful background, and he also wanted to communicate with him.
<br><br>
The old man had sensed his gaze with his keen observation. It was already a miraculous thing because no one had ever noticed him before! Naturally, he wanted to answer the old man's question.
<br><br>
The problem was that he could not do it at all.
<br><br>
'How can I communicate with him? Do I use my consciousness? But the light is one way, and it is impossible to transmit sound!' he thought.
<br><br>
He was now as anxious as ants on a hot pan.
<br><br>
At that point, the young man in cyan robes in the Mysterious Yellow Tower rolled his eyes and said, "If you can hear us, you can stop staring for the time being!"
<br><br>
"Stop staring? Yes, that is also a way of communication!" Geoffrey exclaimed.
<br><br>
Therefore, he did what the young man said, and his fingers left the red light.
<br><br>
In turn, the old man noticed that the gaze behind the Lone Sword had disappeared.
<br><br>
"He heard us," the old man said joyfully.
<br><br>
Whoever was behind that gaze not only heard them but also understood their language! The young man in cyan robes was so smart. Since they could not communicate through such a one-way observation channel the light had formed, he quickly came up with an effective solution.
<br><br>
"Since you can understand our language, you should be able to write in our language too. Remember, please do as I say. We write according to the sequence of letters," said the young man in cyan robes.
<br><br>
"The first letter is A; the second letter is B; the third letter is C, so on and so forth.
<br><br>
If you blink once, then that means the first letter; twice for the second letter; three times for the third letter and so on," he explained.
<br><br>
All the words in the world consisted of letters.
<br><br>
The person on the other side could not speak, but he could control his gaze, which made it possible for them to communicate.
<br><br>
When the old man heard his disciple's idea, a faint smile graced his face.
<br><br>
It was not unusual to spell words in letters to communicate, but his disciple had thought of it in a critical moment. Indeed, the young man was quite smart.
<br><br>
"It's your turn, old man," the young man in cyan said and waved his hand.
<br><br>
The old man asked the first question, "Who are you?"
<br><br>
On the other side, Geoffrey thought for a moment and gently moved his fingers on the red light.
<br><br>
Soon enough, he finished.
<br><br>
The letters spelled "human".
<br><br>
When the old man saw his answer, his face changed dramatically.
<br><br>
"Old man, has he given an answer already? That quickly?" the young man in cyan robes asked. Even then, he still looked impatient.
<br><br>
"Human," the old man said.
<br><br>
"Human!" The young man in cyan robes thought of this word in his mind, and he was also surprised. "It is a human spirit!" he declared.
<br><br>
"It is impossible. The human spirits, monkey spirits, snake spirits, and bird spirits cannot return to the main world. It's impossible to go back. It can't be a human spirit!" The old man shook his head.
<br><br>
On the opposite side, Geoffrey was also baffled.
<br><br>
'What is the human spirit they are talking about? I'm human!' Thus, he began to fiddle with the red light with his fingers.
<br><br>
He wanted to add the word "race."
<br><br>
His fingers moved the red light according to the way they agreed on.
<br><br>
Before he even finished, however, the old man already had the word in his mind.
<br><br>
Chapter 4110 Suspicion The old man was stunned. After a few moments, the young man in cyan robes next to him urged, "Old man, what did he or she say?"
<br><br>
"Human race, he or she is from the human race," the old man replied.
<br><br>
The young man's eyes flashed as he stared at the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
These two words contained so much information that both the old man and the young man tried to think harder.
<br><br>
Human spirits were equivalent to the "humans" of the main world, but they never recognized themselves as human race.
<br><br>
Many arrogant human spirits even insisted that they were completely different from the human race.
<br><br>
This kind of situation was usual among the monkey spirits, the bird spirits, and the snake spirits. Some spirits in the Four Spirits Sect had a natural sense of superiority. They never agreed that the races from the secondary worlds were their kind.
<br><br>
"Did you come from the chaos?" the old man asked a second question.
<br><br>
The person at the other end of the light answered him in a slow and troublesome manner. The old man was afraid that problems might occur if he asked too many questions, so he only asked one by one.
<br><br>
The gaze behind the Lone Sword began to flicker intermittently.
<br><br>
After a while of observing the flicker, the old man got the answer. It was "yes".
<br><br>
"Since you are from the chaos, how did you get out?" the old man continued.
<br><br>
The young man in cyan robes came to a strong realization. The human outside was really his kind! The problem was, the chaos was a closed world.
<br><br>
How in the world could one get a chance out of a closed world? 'That human probably met an unforeseen opportunity, ' the young man thought.
<br><br>
As the gaze flickered some more, the old man once again received a brief answer.
<br><br>
"I just crawled out."
<br><br>
The old man could not hide his amazement precisely because he had been to the main world.
<br><br>
He knew it was impossible to just crawl out of the chaos.
<br><br>
It was already difficult to break the barrier between the Other Shore and the chaos, let alone the barrier between the chaos and the main world.
<br><br>
The old man felt the other party might have been fooling him so he reminded himself to be vigilant.
<br><br>
It might be someone who worked for the snake spirits.
<br><br>
They might have found a way to return to the main world and get back to the four pillars. They were trying to confirm their location through Other Shore Tokens and it was a very dangerous act.
<br><br>
It wasn't only the old man who doubted the other party. Geoffrey on the other end was also conflicted in answering the questions.
<br><br>
He felt uncertain about the other party's purpose.
<br><br>
Ziya didn't tell him that the secrets of the Deleting Space could not be disclosed, because it was almost impossible for him to come into contact with anyone.
<br><br>
But he was not stupid. It was risky to expose such a secret to outsiders.
<br><br>
This old man might not be trustworthy.
<br><br>
There was a hint of suspicion as they approached each other. This caused a gradual unease in their communication.
<br><br>
"Where did you get out? What's your name? Can you roam freely in the main world? Can you climb up that pillar?"
<br><br>
The old man asked several questions in a row, but Geoffrey stopped answering any of them.
<br><br>
He put his finger on the red light and silently watched the two of them.
<br><br>
After a long while, Geoffrey decided to fiddle with it again. "Who are you? Are you humans from the Source World?"
<br><br>
The old man smiled bitterly at the response. It turned out that the other party was also doubtful of him.
<br><br>
However, it didn't matter if the other party found out about his identity.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect knew him and had been looking for him anyway.
<br><br>
"I'm the leader of the Human Sect, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord," he replied.
<br><br>
Hearing the name, Geoffrey tried to recall and soon gave up. "I've never heard of it."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had never mentioned this name, and Ziya never said he had such an uncle.
<br><br>
The old man wasn't surprised at all.
<br><br>
Although he was famous in the 77th chaotic era, he had been hiding in the Jade Pure Realm for so long. Times had changed and legends about him had long been lost in history.
<br><br>
They exchanged several questions but remained on their guard and avoided sensitive problems. It was more like they tested each other until the conversation began to lead nowhere.
<br><br>
"The less trouble, the better..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey muttered. He knew he'd better finish his goal first.
<br><br>
He had climbed the pillar for so long and ought not to waste time on this accident.
<br><br>
Just as Geoffrey was about to end the conversation and pull his fingers from the red light, the big bell in the Divine Bell City of the Ruin Graveyard suddenly clanged.
<br><br>
It was Rocher.
<br><br>
In only a short period, he had already made progress again.
<br><br>
The Bell Ringing Meeting in the Divine Bell City was held every month.
<br><br>
It was not yet the day, but after Rocher broke through, the force ruling the Ruin Graveyard made an exception for him.
<br><br>
As expected, he had successfully entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
The old man and the young man in cyan robes didn't expect the bell to ring, and they had never revealed themselves to others before. The old man gently waved his hand and used a deceptive trick to disable Rocher from seeing them.
<br><br>
Rocher showed great excitement, ringing the bell with all his might.
<br><br>
He knew that his cultivation level had advanced so fast, all thanks to the Monta Stone.
<br><br>
The Mysterious Yellow Tower was indeed helping him! The Monta Stone was by no means an ordinary strengthening-type Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
After entering the thirty-second floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, he did not intend to carry any Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
With the help of the Monta Stone, he became confident to break through the topmost part of the tower - the thirty-third floor! Naturally, those who were good at swordsmanship were sensitive to swords.
<br><br>
Rocher had glanced at the Lone Sword hanging at the thirty-third floor too many times from afar.
<br><br>
The simple sword must have incredible power! 'It won't be long before I take off this sword myself, ' Rocher thought as he observed.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was getting ready to leave when he noticed another presence.
<br><br>
He never thought that an acquaintance of his would suddenly arrive in the tower–Uncle Rocher! Although he didn't have much interaction with Rocher, they had spent some time in the Cloud Hall and the fairy palace.
<br><br>
"Why is Uncle Rocher in this tower?"
<br><br>
he almost cried out.
<br><br>
This was the first acquaintance he had seen through the light.
<br><br>
Rocher wandered around the Mysterious Yellow Tower for a while before he withdrew from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
He was unaware and didn't feel anything unusual.
<br><br>
Geoffrey paused for a while, thinking whether he should say something or not. Finally, he made up his mind to move the red light again.
<br><br>
"I know him! Rocher!"
<br><br>
After getting this information through the flicker of the gaze, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was puzzled.
<br><br>
What the hell...
<br><br>
How could the guy behind the Lone Sword know Rocher? Geoffrey continued sending messages through the light as his emotions stirred.
<br><br>
About a quarter of an hour later, the old man burst into laughter when Geoffrey finished.
<br><br>
"That's great! Really great! My nephew has actually done such a feat! I didn't expect such a coincidence in the world! Hahaha..." he exclaimed while raising his fists just like he won something.
<br><br>
The young man in cyan robes didn't dare to interrupt and stayed silent.
<br><br>
After a while, he could no longer help himself from asking. "What is it, old man? Who is the nephew you mentioned?"
<br><br>
"Ziya!" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord beamed with pride. It was as if he had never been so happy in the past tens of millions of years.
<br><br>
"Ziya? He is still alive?" The young man in cyan robes blinked as he was also shocked.
<br><br>
Chapter 4111 A Damaged Sword After revealing such confidential information, Geoffrey started becoming quite nervous.
<br><br>
Most of the humans in the Source World and the divine land knew very little about the truth of the chaos, and they were blindly optimistic about the future.
<br><br>
Their naive optimism sprang from their ignorance. Once the disaster finally befell them, they would not even have a chance to react before they were wiped out from the world.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Geoffrey had acquired vast amounts of information from his father, so he was more aware of the impending crisis than most people.
<br><br>
He was well aware that the chaos was not as stable as most people falsely believed. On the contrary, it was more like a candle flickering in a storm, and it could be snuffed out at any time.
<br><br>
He couldn't anticipate what the consequences would be now that he had revealed so much information to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
However, since the old man was someone Rocher could trust, he hoped he was someone worthy of his trust as well.
<br><br>
But Geoffrey would never have known the old man was Ziya's uncle.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord became excited for a while before he regained his composure and asked, "As far as I know, the space and time of the main world are vastly different from those of the chaos. Even if Ziya and you managed to leave the chaos, it would be difficult for you to move even a single step. Have you ever experienced the Red Jade Rite?"
<br><br>
Within the entire human race, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was the only one who knew so much about the main world, and that was only due to his mysterious and unique past journeys.
<br><br>
He knew that there was a special and secret method in the Four Spirits Sect that could transform creatures from the secondary worlds into creatures of the main world.
<br><br>
However, this secret method hinged on the availability of some extremely rare materials from the main world. Moreover, those qualified to undergo the Red Jade Rite were usually the most important disciples of the Four Spirits Sect, and this was only performed in very rare cases.
<br><br>
Most importantly, the current Four Spirits Sect might no longer have the ability to perform such a rite.
<br><br>
'What is the Red Jade Rite?' Geoffrey mused. He had never heard of such a thing. After pondering, he then replied, "No, sir. Master Ziya can't see anything in the main world, but I can. I've brought him all the way here..."
<br><br>
"What?! You have sight in the main world? Is this true?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord demanded in shock.
<br><br>
"Yes," Geoffrey simply stated.
<br><br>
Although the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had known it was impossible for Geoffrey to climb up the pillar if he couldn't see within the main world, he was still awed when he received the confirmation.
<br><br>
This should have been virtually impossible...
<br><br>
"What's your name?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord questioned.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey Luo," Geoffrey answered truthfully.
<br><br>
Upon hearing his surname, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord reflexively thought of Zen. He blurted out the resulting conjecture, "Is Zen Luo your father?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Geoffrey replied. "How do you know my father?"
<br><br>
Since Rocher had appeared in this tower, it confirmed that this old man must have connections to the divine land.
<br><br>
Therefore, Geoffrey was not surprised that this old man knew his father.
<br><br>
Still, he wanted to know how he knew his father.
<br><br>
After careful consideration, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord started narrating his stories.
<br><br>
"The Grand Weapon Refining Method your father practiced at the start of his cultivation was passed down from me..."
<br><br>
The Grand Weapon Refining Method had been the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's prized possession for many years. He had followed the advice of his predecessor during the mysterious journey and had been very cautious about selecting a suitable user.
<br><br>
After the 77th chaos, humans had vanished from the Source World for many chaotic eras.
<br><br>
As time trickled by, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had been at a loss on how to deal with the Grand Weapon Refining Method.
<br><br>
Should he relinquish it to another ruling civilization? But that wouldn't do...
<br><br>
Most ruling civilizations had refused to oppose the powerful Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Once a chaotic era ended, a small number of elites of the ruling civilizations retreated into the Other Shore, where they would usually join the Element Spirit Civilization for survival.
<br><br>
Still, only a small number of ruling civilizations had ever chosen to fight against the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had secretly observed these civilizations, including the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
For example, the Wing King had been high up on his list.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, at that time, the Regal Jade Civilization had cultivated a great enmity with not only the Element Spirit Civilization but also the Nihility race. In addition, there was a significant difference between the Regal Jade Civilization and the human race.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had crossed him off the list in the end.
<br><br>
After another three hundred chaotic eras, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord still hid away in the Jade Pure Realm, silently observing the world.
<br><br>
When the current chaotic era came, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord finally found a better opportunity.
<br><br>
The seeds human race had sowed finally sprouted in the Source World! The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Divine Farmer, Yellow Thearch, Zhurong, Emperor Charm, Gonggong, Chiyou... It was a great era of talents.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord kept on observing in secret as he searched for the most suitable candidate.
<br><br>
After the appearance of the Primitive Land, the competition within it grew fierce.
<br><br>
Some of the young talents perished in the competition, such as Gonggong and Zhurong.
<br><br>
Many others were powerful, but they chose to join the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had been waiting for so many chaotic eras, so he was particularly patient in this era.
<br><br>
This was a matter of great importance, and he needed to ensure everything was suitable.
<br><br>
Originally, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had considered Fuxi as the ideal candidate.
<br><br>
Being powerful, Fuxi had the assistance of the Snake Goddess, and the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds inside the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
However, with the support of the Element Spirit Civilization, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer continued to amass strength. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord became hesitant.
<br><br>
In the end, the Nine Li race was annihilated. Chiyou exiled the divine land from the Source World.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord then pinned his hope on the divine land.
<br><br>
He decided to choose this new land as the hiding place of the precious Grand Weapon Refining Method, where it was then discovered by Bromley.
<br><br>
Geoffrey silently listened as he sat on the pillar.
<br><br>
It was exhausting for him to communicate through the red light, therefore, he remained silent while he could.
<br><br>
"I didn't know Father had been involved in so many great secrets..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey murmured to himself.
<br><br>
After listening to the entire story, Geoffrey suddenly asked, "Is it because of the Grand Weapon Refining Method that I am able to move freely in the Abstruse Energy World?"
<br><br>
"That is the only possible conclusion we can draw for now," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord agreed with a chuckle. "Do you have any siblings? Do they possess the same abilities as you do?"
<br><br>
"I was an only child when I left home..." Geoffrey replied. He was unaware that Margaret had given birth to his sister after his departure.
<br><br>
"Then set this aside for the time being," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said. "Which stair have you reached on the pillar now?" he changed the topic.
<br><br>
"I almost reach the top." Geoffrey's eyes shone with joy. "Is there something I can do to help you? I can modify the ability of the Other Shore Tokens," he offered.
<br><br>
"What?! Can you modify their abilities directly?!" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord couldn't help but exclaim in astonishment.
<br><br>
The young cyan-robed man's ears immediately perked up with curiosity.
<br><br>
"Yes! If you don't believe that, let me change this sword for you now!"
<br><br>
As Geoffrey spoke, he extended his hand towards the end of the red light, where a small black stone was.
<br><br>
"Please don't!" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord hastily interceded. "This Lone Sword is a powerful weapon. Even though many have carried it, none of them could unleash its power. We've been waiting for someone who can unravel the mysteries within it."
<br><br>
The more mysterious things were, the more attractive they became.
<br><br>
Even the omniscient Grand Supreme Elderly Lord clung to the same belief. He hoped that someone could discover the truth about this mysterious sword.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Geoffrey let out a chuckle as he replied, "I know why nobody could unleash the power of this sword! It's because a part of this page has been damaged..."
<br><br>
As Geoffrey was about to remove the small black stone, he discovered a deep crack on the step.
<br><br>
He didn't know what had initially caused this crack, but he believed this was why the sword couldn't unleash its power.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey shared this information, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and the cyan-robed young man exchanged dismayed glances.
<br><br>
It now appeared that this mysterious sword that they always cherished was actually a damaged Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Chapter 4112 Black The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had spent a lot of time working on the Lone Sword. He was a little depressed about this unsatisfactory result.
<br><br>
After finishing speaking, Geoffrey pulled out the black stone from the page.
<br><br>
The page also had a row of square holes embedded in it. Geoffrey found the innermost hole and integrated the black stone into it.
<br><br>
Crack! As the two parts assembled, a ray of red light blazed from it, traveling a distance towards the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
When the red light reached and established a link to it, a faint blue light suddenly flashed on its surface.
<br><br>
The surface of the sword began to produce a chill.
<br><br>
The chill spread at an incredible speed, and before the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord could react, a thick layer of ice had already covered the inner wall of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
Splash, splash, splash...
<br><br>
Out of thin air, ice statues started to appear.
<br><br>
The statues shook as they struggled to grow from the ice wall, and then they stood still, like soldiers on duty.
<br><br>
Their stance radiated a very powerful aura.
<br><br>
"The ability of the Lone Sword has changed..." the young man in the cyan robe said stiffly.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord also took a deep breath, as the cold aura also caused his body to chill.
<br><br>
Regardless of the shivers down his spine, he stared at the Lone Sword and said, "The attribute of the Lone Sword has really been changed... How did you do it?"
<br><br>
"It's very simple. Just change the black stone's position," Geoffrey replied.
<br><br>
"Can it be moved to a higher page or even the top?" wondered the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
"I can have a try," replied Geoffrey.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord seemed to have gotten the idea as his face lit up with excitement. His hands trembled slightly as he waited on Geoffrey's move.
<br><br>
The young man in the cyan robe observed his master and sighed with contentment. This old man had not acted like this for many years.
<br><br>
The small black stone was portable and could be easily carried by Geoffrey. If he encountered something uncertain, he could place it into a page nearby. This way, he could ask the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord at any time. It was killing two birds with one stone.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey pulled the small black stone away, the cold air from the Lone Sword immediately stopped blowing. The ice wall within the Mysterious Yellow Tower had also cracked quickly.
<br><br>
However, the rows of ice statues in front did not disappear. They revealed their consciousness after being separated from the Lone Sword and expressed intent of hostility towards the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
Before they could make a move, the young man in the cyan robe had already rushed over like a gust of wind.
<br><br>
He had dashed across without any sign of making a move.
<br><br>
When he stopped at the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's side, the row of ice statues melted into a pool of water.
<br><br>
Geoffrey started to climb up the steps again and saw a few more red light rays.
<br><br>
Some of these red light rays were connected to the Supreme Pure Realm, and some were connected to the Jade Pure Realm. However, more red light rays were connected to the inner worlds.
<br><br>
Geoffrey got closer to reach the top. He didn't bother to observe the red light rays leading to inner worlds and paid more attention to the Other Shore Tokens in the Jade Pure Realm and the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
In the middle of the journey, Geoffrey stopped to communicate with the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and asked about his father's situation. He wanted to find Zen through the red light rays.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had easily observed the Source World before, but his Celestial Eye had not been repaired after being broken by the Evil God's punch. He could only guess roughly and told Geoffrey that Zen was now in the Pear Hill and had entered the Supreme Pure Realm of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Supreme Pure Realm and the Jade Pure Realm were both large.
<br><br>
Finding Zen through just a few Other Shore Tokens was already like searching for a needle in a haystack.
<br><br>
After trying to find him through dozens of red light rays, Geoffrey gave up and proceeded to move towards the top of the pillar.
<br><br>
Four hours later, Geoffrey stopped again.
<br><br>
He was only ten page stairs from the top now.
<br><br>
The ten stairs had become very thick and each of them was ten feet high! The red light had disappeared and was replaced by black light.
<br><br>
"Well, this energy is sickening..."
<br><br>
When Geoffrey fixed his eyes on the black light, he was feeling dizzy.
<br><br>
What kind of Other Shore Tokens were these black light rays connected to? Out of caution, Geoffrey didn't dare to get close to the black light.
<br><br>
Instead, he inserted the small black stone into the eleventh stair, and a red light ray once again connected to the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
The eleventh stair had the strongest energy among the red light rays. The Lone Sword flickered like blazing flames, and even the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord took a few steps back.
<br><br>
Geoffrey immediately told the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord what he had seen. "The last ten stairs seem to have much stronger energy with these black light rays!"
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was not surprised at his statement. "The Other Shore Tokens connected to the last ten stairs are in the hands of the Snake Spirit King," he answered.
<br><br>
The young man in the cyan robe was neither surprised. He had previously heard it from his master.
<br><br>
The power of the Four Spirits Sect did not only come from the ancestrylevel bloodline but also the four holy pillars.
<br><br>
The snake spirits, the bird spirits, the human spirits, and the monkey spirits each controlled a holy pillar.
<br><br>
In the past, the holy pillars gave energy to the people of the Four Spirits Sect, but not too much to the secondary worlds.
<br><br>
The four holy pillars shined with dense vivid lights all year round, including the orange light and red light.
<br><br>
These rays of light passed through infinite space and connected with the Other Shore Tokens uniquely, giving the Four Spirits Sect more power.
<br><br>
The power of the ancestry-level bloodline had been very strong, but it was still limited.
<br><br>
Because of the four holy pillars, the Other Shore Tokens had changing abilities derived from the ancestry-level bloodline, and the threshold of them was lower compared to that of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The energy of the four holy pillars came from the energy pools—the secondary worlds that spread over the main world.
<br><br>
As the energy absorbed by the four holy pillars increased, the power of the Other Shore Tokens also increased. The power of the Other Shore Tokens on the highest pages of the pillars was even stronger than that of the origin-level bloodlines.
<br><br>
Those who were qualified to merge with the Other Shore Tokens on the highest pages of the pillars were top masters from the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
The leaders of the four sects also controlled the Other Shore Tokens of the last ten stairs.
<br><br>
"The holy pillar you are climbing belongs to the Snake Spirit Sect, and the strongest ten Other Shore Tokens are probably kept by the Snake Spirit King. It is said that these ten Other Shore Tokens control nearly one-third of the energy of the holy pillar," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord spoke.
<br><br>
"One-third..." Geoffrey's eyes widened. "Then, isn't the Snake Spirit King able to destroy the chaos in an instant?"
<br><br>
He concluded that the energy in the holy pillar was too strong...
<br><br>
The chaos was no match for the holy pillar.
<br><br>
"No." The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shook his head. "The energy pools are almost destroyed and the power of the Other Shore Tokens is much weaker than before. On the other hand, the chaos is a very special world–a trap carefully set up by the Snake Spirit King. It is far stronger than the ordinary secondary worlds."
<br><br>
In the main world, the Monkey Spirit King was almost invincible. The Snake Spirit King was nothing compared to him, and both the Human Spirit King and the Bird Spirit King appeared to have no advantage against him.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King had surprisingly pulled the other three kings into a lower-level world. This was the reason why the Snake Spirit King had been able to kill them back then.
<br><br>
Chapter 4113 Holy Item The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord acquired all the necessary information about the Four Spirits Sect and the main world from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But regarding what he said about the Snake Spirit King's strength, it was merely a rough estimate. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was not thoroughly certain about it.
<br><br>
Moreover, he was not entirely sure if the Snake Spirit King still had all those ten Other Shore Tokens in his possession.
<br><br>
If the Snake Spirit King was still able to use his full strength until now, he would have already managed to defeat the Bird Spirit King long ago.
<br><br>
These two races had been warring with each other for over hundreds of chaotic eras. One could say that they were mortal enemies.
<br><br>
"If that's the case, then I will destroy all of his Other Shore Tokens..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey had already acknowledged the Snake Spirit King as his father's greatest enemy after the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord explained everything.
<br><br>
He knew that these Other Shore Tokens could be destroyed. All he needed to do was to pull them out.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had succeeded to do that lots of times before. He accomplished this while he was climbing the pillar.
<br><br>
If the person who owned the Other Shore Token seemed wicked, he would immediately pull out the black stone and throw it away.
<br><br>
He was also the one who threw away the black stones of those Other Shore Tokens belonging to the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
However, he was eager to reach the top as soon as possible. He realized that there were too many black stones on the pillar. It would take him a couple of years to pull them all out. Therefore, he left it entirely up to his mood whether or not he would pull out certain stones.
<br><br>
It meant that during this period of time, all sorts of strange things had been happening on the Other Shore. Every now and then, some people found that their Other Shore Tokens had suddenly stopped working.
<br><br>
Even though Geoffrey's proposal to pull out the Snake Spirit King's Other Shore Tokens sounded a little childish, it was actually very straightforward and effective.
<br><br>
It would be best if he succeeded in pulling them out and was able to destroy the ten Other Shore Tokens as well.
<br><br>
"You are welcome to try but you have to be extremely careful," replied the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. He was obviously concerned about Geoffrey's safety.
<br><br>
At this moment, he felt full of regret.
<br><br>
He should have learned more about the Four Spirits Sect in the past. That way, he could have been of greater help to Geoffrey. Alas! He had already missed his chance.
<br><br>
"Okay! Here I go!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey said as soon as the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord expressed his agreement. Very carefully, he climbed onto the tenth step.
<br><br>
Based on his previous experience, he pointed at the black light in the middle of the step.
<br><br>
It was actually a risky move but he had no other choice now. Entering the Abstruse Energy World was a kind of adventure in its own way.
<br><br>
Boom! As soon as Geoffrey's fingertip came into contact with the black light, the scene he saw through it exploded and expanded around him.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, he noticed a brown cloud floating slowly and steadily in the distance.
<br><br>
Soon enough, it had entered his field of vision. Up close, Geoffrey observed that the brown cloud was spiral shaped.
<br><br>
"Huh? A chaos cloud?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey scratched his head as he had no idea what just happened.
<br><br>
He originally thought that all the Other Shore Tokens should have been on the Other Shore. He didn't expect that the Snake Spirit King's tenth Other Shore Token would be in the chaos.
<br><br>
Geoffrey adjusted his visual range and saw a black bead. Much to his surprise, he found that the bead was embedded into a wall.
<br><br>
The chaos was supposed to be empty. How could there be a wall here? Thoroughly confused, Geoffrey adjusted his line of vision once more. He tried to figure out where the wall ended.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the surroundings were filled with chaotic energy. All he could see was a small portion of the wall.
<br><br>
Just as Geoffrey was adjusting his line of sight, he suddenly discovered some bulges protruding below the bead. He focused his vision closely and carefully looked at it. He was utterly shocked after he figured out what it was! It was a woman that had been embedded into the wall! The bumps were actually some parts of her body sticking out of the wall.
<br><br>
Geoffrey pondered about how long the woman had been in there. Her face, chest, legs, and stretched arms were the only parts floating serenely outside the wall.
<br><br>
Astonishingly, Geoffrey realized that this woman was still alive despite of her current condition.
<br><br>
Her skin remained snow-white and full of vitality even if it had already been exposed for an indefinite amount of time. It was as though there was an abundant life force emanating from her body.
<br><br>
Upon closer inspection, he saw that the woman's eyes were different. Her pupils were slits instead of the normal round ones. They were almost like thin crescent moons. They were not human eyes but a pair of snake eyes! This woman had remained in this restrained position for countless years.
<br><br>
All this time, all she could do was gaze into the distance.
<br><br>
Her state of mind had remained the same for over a thousand chaotic eras.
<br><br>
If she could struggle against her bonds, she would definitely break free of them. Then, she would be able to end her life as quickly as possible.
<br><br>
Sadly, she couldn't...
<br><br>
Aside from that, she had to stay embedded in the wall and continuously sacrifice herself for the snake.
<br><br>
And because everything was already settled a long time ago, her struggle would be futile.
<br><br>
Her heart had already become numb. She couldn't feel anything else in this silent void.
<br><br>
However, she immediately felt it when Geoffrey looked at her. How could she not? She hadn't felt any other presence for such a long time. Naturally, she would notice if something changed.
<br><br>
There was a sparkle of light in her somber gray eyes. Her crescent-shaped pupils flickered with a faint golden glow.
<br><br>
'Is there someone out there? Someone is spying on me...
<br><br>
...in order to humiliate me? Oh no! I can feel its presence! Someone is undoubtedly spying on me through the Evil Bead! Someone managed to climb up the pillar!' There was a sudden change in the features of her beautiful face. The face that was once immutable for billions of billions of years looked different.
<br><br>
There was something unusual about her facial expression.
<br><br>
Clearly, the muscles on her face hadn't moved for a very long time, so it became almost harder than steel. Therefore, cracking sounds could be heard when she tried to put on a stunned expression.
<br><br>
She started coughing as she struggled to speak out.
<br><br>
It sounded like her throat was full of sand.
<br><br>
It took her some time before she finally spoke through gritted teeth, "Who is it? Who is spying on me?"
<br><br>
Her voice did not seem like it came from a woman. At the very least, it did not match her beautiful face. It sounded hoarse and husky.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey heard her talk, he became extremely curious.
<br><br>
Where was this woman located in the vast chaos? Why had she been embedded in that wall? Most importantly, who was she? However, he could only ask these questions in his mind.
<br><br>
By using special means, Geoffrey had been able to communicate with the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord earlier. He tried using the same method to reach out to the woman. He began to pluck the black light.
<br><br>
Every time he would pluck the black light, his head felt as if it would explode like a firecracker.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth and held on.
<br><br>
'This woman must have an extraordinary origin, ' he thought. This would be the only opportunity he had to find out who that woman was.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the woman merely stared obliviously at the Evil Bead above. She was utterly confused.
<br><br>
She couldn't understand the way he communicated. Instead, she just said, "The holy pillars... Have they become so unstable? It seems that they would collapse at any moment."
<br><br>
"Then it's fine. If the holy pillars collapse, then these grudges among the four sects would easily be solved..."
<br><br>
Actually, Geoffrey's flickering gaze had misled the woman. She thought there wasn't someone observing her, but there was something wrong with the holy pillars.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey realized the woman didn't get it, he became a little anxious and plucked the black light faster.
<br><br>
However, the woman still couldn't understand what he wanted to say.
<br><br>
Communicating with her this way proved to be rather pointless.
<br><br>
After trying for a while, Geoffrey felt a sharp pain in his head. It was as though it had been split open. Finally, he gave up.
<br><br>
The woman discovered that the gaze on the Evil Bead had disappeared.
<br><br>
Once again, her expression became stiff and impassive. She remained motionless and assumed her previous state of being.
<br><br>
The chaos cloud that enveloped her became a little thinner. Gradually, more parts of the wall that bound her were revealed. It appears that the wall extended out of the chaos cloud and stretched endlessly towards the far distance.
<br><br>
After leaving the black light, Geoffrey headed back and returned to the eleventh step. He immediately told the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord what he had seen.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord frowned when he heard what he just said.
<br><br>
He didn't expect that there was a wall in the chaos. Moreover, there was a beautiful woman with snake eyes embedded in it.
<br><br>
He couldn't quite understand why such a bizarre thing existed in the chaos.
<br><br>
Needless to say, Geoffrey didn't get an answer from the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. Then without saying anything, he stood on the ninth step and touched the black light.
<br><br>
This time, Geoffrey's gaze landed directly on the Heavenly Square City.
<br><br>
There was an irregularly-shaped piece of metal floating in the middle of a small room.
<br><br>
The moment Geoffrey laid his eyes on the metal piece, the whole Heavenly Square City trembled violently.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King suddenly opened his eyes and growled, "My Holy Item! Who dares spy on my Holy Item?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4114 The Danger (Part One) The ten strongest Other Shore Tokens stored on the top of a holy pillar were referred to by the Snake Spirit Sect as the Holy Items.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King Cornelius had selected the ten items himself and strategically ordered them to be placed in this specific location for a very important reason.
<br><br>
If someone was spying on him now through one of these items, it meant that they had climbed up the holy pillar.
<br><br>
"My king, may I know what happened?" Sewell asked, trying to look and sound as respectful as he could be.
<br><br>
He was the first one to come to the Snake Spirit King, and he did not want to try his patience.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King granted his request, filling him on what was happening to the holy pillar. When Sewell heard what the Snake Spirit King said, his neutral expression became somber.
<br><br>
"We have left the main world for too long, my king. After the slaughter, many creatures might have been born there. I guess that some of them accidentally climbed up the holy pillar," Sewell said, his voice sounding worried.
<br><br>
This only confirmed what the Snake Spirit King refused to hear. The main world was not empty. It was not dead.
<br><br>
It was simply not prospering the way it did before.
<br><br>
Long ago, the Snake Spirit Sect had sent the members of the Element Spirit Civilization into the main world to have them gather as much information about it as they could.
<br><br>
From this mission, they discovered that there were already small races forming in the main world. Even worse, some of them were strong.
<br><br>
In terms of size and strength, however, they were not much in comparison to the Four Spirits Sect, but this did not mean they were to be discarded.
<br><br>
After all, a threat was a threat.
<br><br>
"To think that those losers had the audacity to approach our holy pillar.
<br><br>
When I come back to the main world, I will tear them into a thousand pieces," the Snake Spirit King said, each of his words laced with spite.
<br><br>
The holy pillars were forbidden areas in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
After all, people could see many things that they had no right to know through the holy pillars.
<br><br>
Climbing up the four pillars without losing life would be next to impossible for anyone, but Geoffrey had tested his luck.
<br><br>
Before the Snake Spirit King finished his sentence, Sewell's eyes narrowed, squinting to check if what he heard matched what he would see.
<br><br>
Inside of Sewell's thick tail was a black spiral awl, which was given to him by the Snake Spirit King himself. The awl was a Holy Item too.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King responded to his reaction. "Did you detect something?" he asked, readying himself for the answer.
<br><br>
Sewell switched his attention from the awl to his king, nodding his head in confirmation.
<br><br>
"Show me," the Snake Spirit King ordered Sewell.
<br><br>
Sewell bowed his head in submission, wagging his tail to release the awl from it. The spiral awl made its way around the location—from top to bottom, from left to right—before introducing itself to the face of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King looked at the spiral awl in front of him. Through it, he spoke to the intruder, his voice filled with anger. "This is the leader of the Snake Spirit Sect. Who are you? What are you doing on our holy pillar?"
<br><br>
As he was speaking, his beady eyes began to turn golden, and a strong spell glowed around them.
<br><br>
When his eyes would meet another's, the latter would immediately fall to his feet, completely submitting themselves to him. Even the most stubborn person could not stand a chance.
<br><br>
Despite being in a different world, the Snake Spirit King remained confident in his powers. It had never failed him before. With just one look, he knew he would be able to make the intruder fear.
<br><br>
However, just as the Snake Spirit King's eyes lit up, the intruder's gaze in the spiral awl disappeared.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King narrowed his eyes. "The intruder is quick to react,"
<br><br>
he remarked while his eyes began to darken, losing their glow.
<br><br>
"Such a pity, my king," Sewell said in response, genuinely disappointed in what just passed.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King rolled his eyes in vexation. Right after, he summoned the Other Shore Tokens from many places in the Heavenly Square City, and they moved in circles above his head.
<br><br>
As long as the intruder touched a ray of the dark light again, he would cast the spell through his eyes immediately. Then, the intruder's mind would swell up in confusion, forgetting what he was there for in the first place.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King waited and waited. However, moments passed, and there was still no negative reaction from the Holy Items. The intruder was not doing anything.
<br><br>
"What a cunning lad," he commented, his patience nearing its end. He returned the Holy Items to their original places. He addressed his attention to Sewell and asked, "What do you think that intruder is there for? Do you think he or she is here to break the connection between the Holy Items and the holy pillar?"
<br><br>
Sewell shook his head. "From what I know, no matter how hard a person tries, the connection between the Holy Items and the holy pillar would be impossible to break off."
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, that's not true," the Snake Spirit King interjected.
<br><br>
"Although the connection between the items and the holy pillar is supposedly unbreakable, if a person has enough time and the correct resources, he or she would be able to cut it all off," he continued, revealing a fit of growing anger in his expression. "After all, the Deep Space favors no one."
<br><br>
"The Deep Space favors no one"—this was something the Human Spirit King Kincaid would always remind him. The Deep Space was never purposely on anyone's side.
<br><br>
The Deep Space meant a great lot to the main world. Both Sheehan and Kincaid believed it to be the origin of all that existed.
<br><br>
However, despite the supposed greatness of the Deep Space, it was also mysterious and unpredictable, therefore making it dangerous. No one knew what to expect from it, not even the Four Spirits Sect did when it was at its peak! Most members of the Four Spirits Sect believed the reason why they would rule the main world was because it was a blessing from the Deep Space back then. But Kincaid had a different opinion.
<br><br>
Chapter 4115 The Danger (Part Two) To him, the prosperity of the Four Spirits Sect had nothing to do with the Deep Space's favor. It was all simply blind luck! This was why the Snake Spirit King decided to take matters into his own hands. He thought that if the Four Spirits Sect disappeared from the main world, more powerful races would rise and take their places.
<br><br>
His plan was clear, thorough, and well-thought-out. He did what he could to achieve his vision, and all was going according to his plan.
<br><br>
However, if there was anything he failed to take into consideration, it would be Sheehan's personality.
<br><br>
The way the Snake Spirit King saw it, Sheehan, the Bird Spirit King was the most restrained one among the four leaders of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
However, he did not expect him to be so stubborn.
<br><br>
When the Snake Spirit King put an end to the Four Spirits Sect, Sheehan decided to put an end to the Snake Spirit King's plan.
<br><br>
Thinking about this bothered him deeply, having to remember how someone planned to destroy something he had spent so much time and effort on.
<br><br>
He simply could not understand why Sheehan was so stubborn, why he could not simply let things go according to the plan. He even resisted against him after he died.
<br><br>
"Whatever happens, we cannot let those weaklings from the main world get in our way. We have to make our move," the Snake Spirit King said, his drive for succeeding in his plans becoming fiercer.
<br><br>
"But it is not yet time to take action," Sewell worriedly reminded the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King disagreed. "There is no better time than now.
<br><br>
Although Sheehan is not awake, those birds are incredibly intelligent. It will only be a matter of time before they recognize the direction of our plan. For now, what we need to focus on is the Monkey Spirit King, who has already awakened from his sleep. We need to carry out our plan ahead of schedule. Tell the others," the Snake Spirit King said.
<br><br>
If they followed their original plan, they would have to stay in the chaos for a longer period.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King and his men initially didn't pay attention to the rounds of chaos.
<br><br>
They did not take the ruling civilizations into account simply because they thought the civilizations wouldn't even be a bother. They thought they wouldn't even make a scratch in their plans.
<br><br>
However, unexpectedly, the Bird Spirit Sect became involved. Thus, the Snake Spirit King was forced to act quickly, changing his strategy.
<br><br>
This led him into choosing the Purge Way, which would lead to zero rounds of Chaos, and all went according to his expectations again.
<br><br>
But to the agony of the Snake Spirit King, another disruption was about to happen.
<br><br>
Geoffrey rested his back against the side of the stair. He did his best to catch his breath, while his heart attempted to steady itself. His arms and legs had become so exhausted to the point of being numb, but he had to pick himself up again. He could not allow himself to faint.
<br><br>
When the spiral awl floated in front of the Snake Spirit King's face, he had a hunch that what was to come next could not be good, and he was right.
<br><br>
When the Snake Spirit King's eyes began to blaze with a golden light, he knew he had to look away from his direction to protect himself.
<br><br>
In fact, he was unable to protect himself from making eye contact with the Snake Spirit King. Moments ago, he just took a step back in a panic, losing his balance.
<br><br>
Luckily, the ray of dark light slip through his fingers, too, which saved his life.
<br><br>
It was indeed a life and death situation! 'That was too close.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King. I just saw the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
I almost died just about now!' Geoffrey's thoughts came flooding into his head in heavy torrents. He needed more than a while to calm down.
<br><br>
'I'm not sure if I can continue with this. I am too weak, too unready. If Father or Master Ziya were here instead of me, they would do so much better in facing the Snake Spirit King!' Geoffrey thought to himself, resisting the frustration he had felt.
<br><br>
"How dare you try to take my life!" Geoffrey screamed. "I'll destroy your precious Other Shore Tokens!" he continued.
<br><br>
With no hesitation, he stretched his hand out. He curled his fingers around the black stone, grabbing it.
<br><br>
In the past, he easily removed the black stones with a single pull; however, with this stone, no matter how hard he pulled, he couldn't remove it! "Damn it..." he said. It was becoming more difficult with the sweat dripping down his forehead blurring his vision.
<br><br>
He tried other methods to grab the stone, but none of them worked.
<br><br>
As his mind and body grew more tired, it became more and more difficult to accomplish his mission. The black stair and the black stone were too difficult to deal with.
<br><br>
After a few more tries, Geoffrey, in pure exhaustion, finally gave up.
<br><br>
He rested his body after a long time of struggling, not daring to touch another ray of dark light.
<br><br>
'If the Snake Spirit King is around the Other Shore Tokens, I would be in serious trouble, especially if I make eye-contact with him. I can only imagine how harsh the punishment would be, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
He decided to completely leave the dark rays of light alone and headed towards the top of the holy pillar.
<br><br>
As he was climbing his way to the top, he couldn't help but think of the Four Spirits Sect, how they built these gigantic pillars.
<br><br>
His feet finally landed on the top of the holy pillar. When he was there, he discovered he was standing on a round platform, which measured about ten thousand feet wide! In the middle of the platform was a relief sculpture of a giant snake, which seemed almost life-like.
<br><br>
He took a quick look at it, only to realize that he was face-to-face with the relief sculpture of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Chapter 4116 The Sky Geoffrey took a few steps forward, carefully studying the relief sculpture on the platform.
<br><br>
The relief of the Snake Spirit King was extremely intricate, but something caught Geoffrey's eyes.
<br><br>
It seemed some parts of the carving were smelted, as though someone had tried to burn them.
<br><br>
Did someone climb to the top of the pillar to destroy the relief before? The pillar was undoubtedly very solid. Geoffrey wouldn't have been able to damage it, even if he tried.
<br><br>
Back when he was at the foot of the pillar, he had asked Ziya to give it a try, but even Ziya couldn't leave a mark on the pillar.
<br><br>
Except for these strangely burnt parts, there was nothing exquisite about the relief.
<br><br>
Geoffrey frowned in disappointment.
<br><br>
It hadn't been easy for him to climb all this way, yet the journey seemed fruitless.
<br><br>
At the very least, he had helped the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord connect the sword to the eleventh stair.
<br><br>
An Other Shore Token on the eleventh stair was supposedly quite decent; however it was still connected to a red light beam like before. This meant it was surely inferior compared to the Other Shore Tokens on the last ten stairs.
<br><br>
'If I drill a square hole here and insert the black stone in it, will it work?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey's eyes flashed excitedly as he came up with this bold idea.
<br><br>
But he dismissed the idea just as quickly as he hatched it.
<br><br>
The pillar was too solid. There was no possible way he'd be able to dig a hole in it! 'What if I asked Ziya for help...' It had taken him several months to climb to the top of the pillar, which meant it'd take several more months to go down. Thus, it would take him nearly a year to make a round trip.
<br><br>
As he pondered over this, he inadvertently walked to the center of the platform, where the Snake Spirit King's eyes lay.
<br><br>
Without even looking where he was going, Geoffrey accidentally stepped right on the Snake Spirit King's eyes. Then, the sky began to stir, as though it was unsettled.
<br><br>
Initially, the sky of the main world was as dark as a moonless night.
<br><br>
Whenever he looked up, the sky was always pitch black.
<br><br>
But the instant Geoffrey stepped on the Snake Spirit King's eyes, he noticed a huge courtyard floating nearby.
<br><br>
It was floating in the center of the four pillars.
<br><br>
Upon a closer look, Geoffrey realized the courtyard was tethered by thick chains that glowed brightly. The glowing chains were connected to the tops of the four pillars.
<br><br>
"Why is there a courtyard here?" Geoffrey's mouth fell open in shock.
<br><br>
Back when he was at the foot of the pillar, he didn't notice any courtyard.
<br><br>
But from where he stood now, it was impossible to miss! Right underneath the courtyard were three cone-shaped stones. It looked as though the floating, massive stones were supporting the courtyard, keeping it afloat.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's gaze shifted from the bottom of the courtyard to its top. His eyes suddenly widened in shock.
<br><br>
"The sky... Is this the real sky of the Abstruse Energy World?"
<br><br>
To his surprise, the sky had changed miraculously.
<br><br>
Instead of the pitch blackness, the sky was now a deep and threedimensional space.
<br><br>
It was as though it extended infinitely, with strange yet beautiful things floating around in it.
<br><br>
A huge, windmill-shaped object floated far away, with its wheel spinning unimaginably fast.
<br><br>
In the distance, a shape that almost resembled a sphere glowed a deep red, almost like a sun, but it kept changing shape.
<br><br>
In addition, there were also some fragments floating within its orbit.
<br><br>
Everything seemed so far yet so huge. Geoffrey was in utter awe.
<br><br>
For a long time, he stared blankly into the sky in wonder.
<br><br>
When he finally snapped back to reality, he took a step forward.
<br><br>
Everything disappeared in an instant. Even the courtyard was gone.
<br><br>
Cautiously, he took a step backward, and the sky changed once more.
<br><br>
"Is this some trick of the Four Spirits Sect?"
<br><br>
Although it felt a little strange, Geoffrey's interest was definitely piqued.
<br><br>
Once he figured out that the trick was to step on the Snake Spirit King's eyes, an idea flashed through his mind. 'What if I try climbing onto that courtyard?' The courtyard was connected to the pillar he was on by a thick chain.
<br><br>
Geoffrey could easily cross over to the courtyard through the chain.
<br><br>
Moreover, he could check out the other three pillars, since the courtyard was chained to them, too.
<br><br>
The only catch was, if he stepped away from the Snake Spirit King's eyes, everything would disappear.
<br><br>
However, did they—the courtyard, the chains, and the sky—truly disappear? Or were they just invisible? After memorizing the location of the chain, Geoffrey took a deep breath and left the Snake Spirit King's eyes. Cautiously, he walked towards the platform's edge.
<br><br>
He felt his way along the edge carefully, until his fingers brushed against something cold. It was a link in the chain! Each link was about ten feet wide. Although the chain was completely invisible, Geoffrey was confident he would be able to navigate.
<br><br>
The distance from the pillar to the courtyard was long, about half the distance between the two pillars. It was at least a ten-day climb to reach the courtyard.
<br><br>
After climbing for a few hundred feet, Geoffrey looked down.
<br><br>
He trembled slightly as he realized there was nothing under him.
<br><br>
If he fell from such a height, there was no possible way he'd survive.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Star Crane City, Crane Blood Province, Source World, a huge stone heart was beating slowly yet energetically.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch lay on the throbbing stone, staring into space blankly.
<br><br>
His once incredibly strong body was now extremely weak.
<br><br>
Claire occupying his body was taxing enough in itself, but the price he had to pay when she was defeated after descending to the Source World was even more unimaginable.
<br><br>
He was lucky to be alive, but now, the Yellow Thearch was overcome with regret.
<br><br>
He had chosen to join the Element Spirit Civilization to grow in strength.
<br><br>
But the so-called strength of the Element Spirit Civilization turned out to be bait! And the Yellow Thearch fell for it. After taking the bait, he had now become the Element Spirit Civilization's puppet.
<br><br>
Now, there was no turning back. He had absolutely no ability to resist, and was completely subject to their control.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! Someone was approaching.
<br><br>
Although the Yellow Thearch's body was badly damaged, he could still acutely sense things around him.
<br><br>
Instantly he knew that the person approaching him was the Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
"What're you doing here?" the Yellow Thearch asked sourly.
<br><br>
After the battle with the Pear Hill, the Divine Farmer had actually rescued him.
<br><br>
But secretly, the Yellow Thearch loathed the Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
It would've been better to die in battle than to continue living as a puppet.
<br><br>
"The Eye Spirit has sent a message," said the Divine Farmer calmly.
<br><br>
"The Eye Spirit" were the last three words that the Yellow Thearch wanted to hear, but he had no choice. With a sigh, he struggled to sit up.
<br><br>
He knew that the Eye Spirit could be spying on them at any given time.
<br><br>
"What did he say?" the Yellow Thearch asked tiredly.
<br><br>
"Kill the Evil God," the Divine Farmer said bluntly.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch laughed bitterly. "How are we supposed to do that, especially in this condition?"
<br><br>
In the battle with the Pear Hill, two of the three Chaos Ancient Gods who advocated the Purge Way had perished. Othniel was the only survivor, but no one knew where he was now. How could they possibly kill the Evil God after they suffered such huge losses? "We have to do it. The Eye Spirit will help us." The Divine Farmer shrugged.
<br><br>
"He will help us? How?"
<br><br>
"We still have Othniel. The Element Spirit Civilization will support us, and the Eye Spirit said he will teach us a special method." There was a hint of excitement in the Divine Farmer's voice.
<br><br>
"What method?"
<br><br>
"The Blood-controlling Method. It's a method to activate the bloodline theurgies, developed from outside the chaos..."
<br><br>
Chapter 4117 Everything Was Under Control Yellow Thearch was confused after he heard what Divine Farmer said.
<br><br>
When one obtained a bloodline, it would fully belong to them.
<br><br>
On top of that, the more one used their obtained bloodline, the more powerful their theurgy would be.
<br><br>
That was how Yellow Thearch thought the bloodlines worked ever since he became an Eternal Realm warrior.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit even told him the same thing before.
<br><br>
But now that he knew about the existence of the Blood-controlling Method, he thought everything he knew came into question.
<br><br>
"Master Eye Spirit didn't have the Blood-controlling Method before. It was given to him by a master," Divine Farmer told him.
<br><br>
"A master..." Yellow Thearch's eyes flashed with combined intrigue and surprise.
<br><br>
It seemed that he was right in assuming that these Treacherous Beings were not as simple as they seemed.
<br><br>
There was no way such powerful and terrible creatures came from within the chaos.
<br><br>
Another matter to also consider was the relationship between the Element Spirit Civilization and the Treacherous Beings, but Yellow Thearch pushed this to the back of his mind for the time being.
<br><br>
"Can a master truly activate a stronger bloodline theurgy with just a Blood-controlling Method?" he asked. Divine Farmer's words still made him doubtful.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer merely smiled in reply.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the blood within his body began to boil.
<br><br>
His blood power used to be extremely fierce and violent but now, it was incredibly gentle.
<br><br>
In just a few moments, a figure sporting a goat head with huge horns took shape.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer had just transformed into a goat monster! "What do you intend to do?"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch immediately became alert.
<br><br>
In this form, Divine Farmer's strength greatly increased but his consciousness was virtually non-existent. He essentially turned into a heartless goat monster.
<br><br>
Was he perhaps planning to kill Yellow Thearch? A powerful aura emanated from Divine Farmer's monster form, so powerful that it was enough to disrupt rubble on the ground.
<br><br>
To Yellow Thearch's surprise, Divine Farmer spoke, "I'm just trying to prove something to you."
<br><br>
"Can you control your goat monster body?" Yellow Thearch asked in amazement.
<br><br>
"Completely," Divine Farmer replied. "I can freely choose and control any of the three forms of transformation."
<br><br>
Back then, Divine Farmer's transformation forms came at random and, though they were powerful, there was always a risk that he did not get the one he wanted.
<br><br>
"After cultivating the Blood-controlling Method, I was also able to obtain a fourth form. It consumes a lot of energy but its strength is far more complicated than that of the first three forms!" The elation in Divine Farmer's face was unmistakable as he made this declaration.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Yellow Thearch remained doubtful.
<br><br>
Could the Blood-controlling Method be truly so magical? There was only one way to find out. "Master Eye Spirit, will you impart such a wondrous method to me?" Yellow Thearch asked hopefully.
<br><br>
Before Divine Farmer could even open his mouth, his forehead suddenly split open to reveal an eyeball.
<br><br>
"Of course," the Eye Spirit replied.
<br><br>
"With the Blood-controlling Method, me and Divine Farmer will steadily grow in power." The Eye Spirit's words excited Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
All the regret and distress from the past few months completely disappeared in his mind.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The eyeball in the middle of Divine Farmer's forehead flickered and soon, numerous Sanskrit words floated in front of Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
"This is the Blood-controlling Method suitable for you. This battle is not related to the Pear Hill or the Finale Way. The only thing you have to do is to fight against the Black Ship," the Eye Spirit told him. "Don't let me down."
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch stared at all the Sanskrit words given to him with greed and desire.
<br><br>
"Master Eye Spirit, may I ask a question?" he asked. "What is it?"
<br><br>
the Eye Spirit replied.
<br><br>
"The Blood-controlling Method is so powerful," Yellow Thearch began.
<br><br>
"Why did you not teach it to us in advance? We wouldn't have suffered so miserably in the battle of Pear Hill back then if you had taught us."
<br><br>
"Well, we have just been taught, too."
<br><br>
There was a hint of dissatisfaction in the Eye Spirit's tone.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization wholeheartedly served the Snake Spirit Sect but they were not always treated as amicably as they would like.
<br><br>
To the Snake Masters, creatures of the chaos simply weren't qualified to learn nor had the ability to grasp the Blood-controlling Methods.
<br><br>
Deeming his deed done, the eyeball disappeared, and the crack that appeared in the middle of Divine Farmer's forehead closed.
<br><br>
"How long will it take to cultivate the Blood-controlling Method?" Yellow Thearch asked Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
"Very soon, especially since we already have a good grasp on how to use our bloodline. It only took me four days to cultivate it," Divine Farmer answered.
<br><br>
"Once I master the Blood-controlling Method, I will look for the Evil God!" Yellow Thearch declared. This Blood-controlling Method gave hope to him.
<br><br>
Up above the Roaring Lake Province, the aforementioned Evil God's body floated in the air like a leaf.
<br><br>
"Wind..." he uttered as he closed his eyes.
<br><br>
He was an image of tranquility as he floated by.
<br><br>
Soon, however, a stronger wind blew and he found himself hurtling through the sky at an astonishing speed.
<br><br>
"Strong wind..."
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
It wasn't long before the strong wind turned into violent gales that swept through the entire Roaring Lake Province.
<br><br>
The wind was strong enough to suck in the huge lakes and plow the ground into many ditches.
<br><br>
It was a truly destructive storm.
<br><br>
This wasn't the first time the Roaring Lake Province was devastated by such a violent shock wave.
<br><br>
Numerous creatures that lived near the lakes now lay either dead or injured. Those who were lucky to survive moved around the Roaring Lake Province to try to stay far away from the danger.
<br><br>
They couldn't leave the Roaring Lake Province entirely since it was their home.
<br><br>
As the storm raged, no living being in the entire Roaring Lake Province could escape.
<br><br>
Water and soil mixed together and formed a ten-thousand feet high pile of debris. Soon enough, the ground was squeezed all over again.
<br><br>
Countless creatures lost their voice and died instantly.
<br><br>
This would go on for an entire hour.
<br><br>
Afterwards, the winds finally calmed.
<br><br>
From up above one would be able to see the extent of the damage: a graying brown mud plain wherein countless broken limbs lay.
<br><br>
A large hole appeared in the middle of it all wherein a huge turtle shell surfaced from the hole. Underneath this shell were numerous creatures! One of the creatures it protected was at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
The sight of his race being exterminated broke this Chaotic Source Realm warrior's heart, and his Other Shore Token, the Sacred Earth Armor, could only save a few people.
<br><br>
"You dodged my storm," the Evil God remarked with indifference as he floated down. "Your strength is not too shabby."
<br><br>
To everyone's combined surprise and horror, the Evil God did not move his mouth. Rather his voice emanated from the earth itself.
<br><br>
His words could be heard from within and across the Roaring Lake Province itself! It was like he suddenly became the land's ruler.
<br><br>
Anger erupted from the Chaotic Source Realm warrior's eyes when he heard this.
<br><br>
With the turtle shell on his head, he made a mad dash towards the Evil God and roared, "Why? Why did you destroy our Roaring Lake Province?"
<br><br>
The Evil God simply raised his hand and the turtle shell atop the Chaotic Source Realm warrior's head shattered with a bang! "I want to correct your words," the Evil God told him. "This is not your Roaring Lake Province, but mine."
<br><br>
"I'll kill you!"
<br><br>
The Evil God's insensitive words pushed the Chaotic Source Realm warrior to the limit.
<br><br>
He was determined to burn his Other Shore Token just to fight against this malicious character.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, he soon discovered that even if he maxed out his potential, he still couldn't move.
<br><br>
"It's not just the Roaring Lake Province," the Evil God began, "but everything in the Source World. The flowers, the trees, the buildings and even your lives all belong to me now. Everything is under my control and I can do everything that I want."
<br><br>
Clap! Despite his best efforts to burn through his Other Shore Token, the Chaotic Source Realm warrior still turned into blood mist and completely disappeared from the world.
<br><br>
Chapter 4118 The Strongest Hatred A black ship slowly approached the Evil God.
<br><br>
On the side of the ship sat Shera, who had yet to recover from her shock.
<br><br>
The former captain of the ship sat beside her in silence, deep in thought.
<br><br>
He had only helped the Evil God devour Usman because the Grandmaster of Heaven asked him to.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God himself was like a Pandora's box, full of uncertainty. No one knew how he would affect the future and what he would bring to it.
<br><br>
"Is this the power of the Source World?" Shera asked.
<br><br>
"My power," the Evil God answered with a pout.
<br><br>
He had already considered himself the ruler of the entire world.
<br><br>
"Your power is truly something else… It's on a par with that of the Chaos Ancient Gods," Shera continued.
<br><br>
All the Eternal Realm warriors in this world could destroy a province, but it was a time-consuming task.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Evil God only moved for a bit, but he had wiped out the entire Roaring Lake Province in just an hour. Only the Chaos Ancient Gods could achieve such a feat! "The Chaos Ancient Gods?" There was a trace of contempt in the Evil God's voice.
<br><br>
Indeed, those Chaos Ancient Gods might have grasped the highest level of truths.
<br><br>
However, there were some truths that might not work in his territory! The more compatible he was with the Source World, the stronger the power he would have.
<br><br>
At that moment, he suddenly thought of something that deeply bothered him. It was an issue that was close to his heart.
<br><br>
The image of a person filled his mind, and he immediately closed his eyes.
<br><br>
Then, his spiritual sense flowed out like water and began to wash over the entire Roaring Lake Province.
<br><br>
When Shera felt his spiritual sense, she asked curiously, "Who are you looking for?"
<br><br>
"A person," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
"A person? Who?" Shera asked again.
<br><br>
"I don't know, either." The Evil God closed his eyes and shook his head.
<br><br>
After he had fused with the Source World, he became immensely sensitive to everything within it.
<br><br>
That was why the Source World had sensed a concern in his heart and gave feedback to him.
<br><br>
The problem was that he could not possibly care about anyone in the Source World. The feeling was quite strange and out of character for him.
<br><br>
A few moments later, his spiritual sense appeared in the center of every large province in the Source World and quickly spread everywhere, until it covered all of the great provinces.
<br><br>
It was probably the broadest spread of spiritual sense in history! Once all the spiritual sense had spread out, the Evil God saw everything in the Source World.
<br><br>
Eventually, he caught sight of a woman.
<br><br>
"Edna!"
<br><br>
However, his lips curved into a slight frown.
<br><br>
The concern he felt was for his wife.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he did not expect that Zen had released her.
<br><br>
Did Zen let her leave his inner world on purpose and leave her to perish by herself? No...
<br><br>
He was not a narrow-minded man.
<br><br>
Edna must have asked to leave his inner world and gotten his permission.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, the Evil God quickly concluded that it was the case.
<br><br>
Although he had always regarded Zen as an opponent whom he had to defeat, deep in his heart, he admired Zen.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he knew that the Evil God was a troublemaker, but he still set him free. Such an opponent deserved the Evil God's admiration.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Edna was now in bad condition.
<br><br>
However, she was very happy when Zen had released her.
<br><br>
She wanted to find the Evil God, so she naturally did not stay in the Divine Bloom Province. Instead, she headed west and passed through two large provinces in a row.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace still controlled those two provinces, so they were relatively safe.
<br><br>
Yet, it was not long after when the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race came and attacked the Oneness Sky Palace. They passed through exactly where Edna went. Since she had already reached the consummation of True God Realm, of course, they did not treat her as an ordinary civilian and captured her.
<br><br>
Now, she was in the Moon Shield City in the Blood Sea Province.
<br><br>
The Moon Shield City was a military stronghold of the Bearing race. A large number of warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace remained imprisoned in the city.
<br><br>
As soon as Edna arrived, the guards threw her and the other prisoners from the Oneness Sky Palace into a smelly dungeon.
<br><br>
She leaned against the dirty wall with her arms around her legs, her eyes full of sadness.
<br><br>
Back in Zen's inner world, she had been born as a beauty. After she married the Evil God, she was like the queen in Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
Even when Zen had defeated her husband, she had never suffered any hardships.
<br><br>
On the contrary, her situation now was far beyond what she could bear.
<br><br>
"Ahhh!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, a series of miserable screams came from the depths of the dungeon.
<br><br>
The prisoners' hairs stood on their ends upon hearing the piercing cry.
<br><br>
There was a horrible rumor that spread among them.
<br><br>
It was said that the warden of this prison was a ruthless warrior in the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. He had a mysterious type of Other Shore Token, which needed to absorb life energy to unleash its power.
<br><br>
The more potent the source of the life energy was, the better.
<br><br>
The number of warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the Source World was small, compared to that of the warriors at True God Realm.
<br><br>
Therefore, the warden's most favored targets were naturally the consummate True Gods.
<br><br>
During that period, they had taken away more and more prisoners at the consummation of the True God Realm, and miserable cries always followed after.
<br><br>
One could only imagine how tragic those prisoners' lives had ended.
<br><br>
Fear was written all over Edna's face. After all, she did not want to die! At first, she felt relieved when she finally left Zen's inner world—but before she could find her husband, she was going to die.
<br><br>
It was devastating.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Her thoughts were interrupted when the prison doors opened, and a prison guard of the Bearing race came in.
<br><br>
He looked around indifferently and pointed at a person in the corner, then shouted, "You, you and you, get up!"
<br><br>
The three people he pointed to quickly blanched. It meant that their lives were about to come to an end.
<br><br>
"Don't kill me, please! I'm a member of the Bai Clan at the Clear Lake.
<br><br>
I've never joined the Oneness Sky Palace! I can join the Bearing race, I'll ask my clan... "
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
Before the man could even finish his words, the prison guard already stabbed him with a long spear, then threw him out of the prison just like a dead dog.
<br><br>
These people could not resist at all because their inner worlds had been sealed. But even if their inner worlds were not sealed, they were no match for the prison guard.
<br><br>
The prison guard had planned to take three people away, but because he just killed one of them, he had to find a substitute.
<br><br>
"You! Come together with them!"
<br><br>
This time, the prison guard pointed at Edna.
<br><br>
Chills ran down her spine, and her body trembled with fear.
<br><br>
Still, there was a little bit of pride inside her compelled her to go on.
<br><br>
She stood up and followed the other two people out without any resistance.
<br><br>
'Will I really die and no longer see my husband forever?' she sighed in her heart.
<br><br>
Her eyes looked up to the sky.
<br><br>
However, there was no sky, only dungeon walls covered with spider webs.
<br><br>
As she walked along the long corridor, her legs felt like lead.
<br><br>
When they reached the end of the corridor, the prison guard coldly said, "You two go into the penalty room first!"
<br><br>
The other two prisoners had no choice but to go inside in despair.
<br><br>
Then, the prison guard's wicked eyes fell on Edna.
<br><br>
It was easy for the citizens in the Source World to change their appearances, so most of them looked good.
<br><br>
However, Edna's beauty had an indescribable aura to it, which made the prison guard feel a certain kind of impulse.
<br><br>
Of course, she felt the prison guard's unwavering gaze. "What do you want to do?" she asked cautiously.
<br><br>
"Anyway, you are going to die. Why not have some fun in your last moment?" the prison guard said with a sinister laugh.
<br><br>
"How dare you!" Edna felt utterly flustered when she realized what the prison guard meant.
<br><br>
Then, the prison guard advanced towards her. Despite her struggles, he grabbed her hair and took her into another empty room.
<br><br>
Just then, a strong spiritual sense spread out in the Blood Sea Province.
<br><br>
The spiritual sense even reached the whole dungeon under the ground.
<br><br>
As a great warrior at the Other Shore Realm, the prison guard also felt the strong spiritual sense right away. He looked up strangely and muttered, "Who dares to be so bold and release spiritual sense recklessly in the Moon Shield City?"
<br><br>
Unbeknownst to him, the spiritual sense had already covered the entire Blood Sea Province.
<br><br>
Edna looked up blankly, then her jaw dropped.
<br><br>
She felt that this powerful spiritual sense was somewhat familiar. Then, she quickly realized that it came from the Evil God! "Dar... darling...
<br><br>
Are you here to save me?" she croaked.
<br><br>
Suddenly, she changed her mind and shouted, "Don't come here! This is the Bearing race's territory! They will kill you!"
<br><br>
Even at her final moments, she still cared about the safety of the Evil God first. She did not want him to risk his life to save her.
<br><br>
The Evil God, who was far away in the Roaring Lake Province, naturally saw this scene and also heard Edna's cries.
<br><br>
At that point, vicious killing intent surged from his body.
<br><br>
His killing intent was also the strongest that was ever released in history, as it covered every corner of the Source World.
<br><br>
After all, it was hatred that came from the Source World.
<br><br>
Chapter 4119 Cut Ties Evil God always saw love as a ridiculous desire.
<br><br>
The only thing he pursued passionately was strength.
<br><br>
He would remove anything that attempted to keep him from this objective.
<br><br>
Even when he realized he couldn't defeat Zen in Zen's inner world, Evil God refused to give up.
<br><br>
Glory, wealth, and family didn't mean much to him compared to his ultimate goal.
<br><br>
But now he couldn't contain his anger.
<br><br>
It was until he felt hatred that he became aware of what he was doing.
<br><br>
'Why would I get so angry? What a worthless emotion!' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
He had also bid farewell to his past when he left Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
Edna was aware of his thoughts yet continued to support him without hesitation.
<br><br>
Although the Evil God was able to think rationally, anger still overwhelmed him.
<br><br>
"I still care about her..."
<br><br>
he said as he quickly figured out the reason he was mad.
<br><br>
There was no one to blame but his wife.
<br><br>
Edna was a liability for him, and he would never let her hold him back.
<br><br>
'I can't let her live, ' the Evil God decided.
<br><br>
It was the second time that he had tried to take Edna's life.
<br><br>
He had stabbed Edna's chest with a sharp broken knife and planned to also kill himself afterward. But Zen came to their rescue.
<br><br>
Evil God closed his eyes as he began to sense Edna's condition and emotions.
<br><br>
He saw that Edna was worried about him and that she was relieved upon finding out that he was alive. Her temperature even rose that she slightly trembled with excitement.
<br><br>
The guard of the dungeon was taken aback by how Edna reacted.
<br><br>
"Are you saying the aura belongs to your husband?" the guard asked Edna.
<br><br>
Judging by the powerful aura, he speculated that the visitor was at least a master at the Holy Soul Realm or Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
No matter what the mysterious man was up to, the guard was certain that he could not afford to mess with the man. Soon after, another thought occurred to him.
<br><br>
The guard let out a snort. "If your husband was this strong, you wouldn't have ended up here. You are a terrible liar. Ha-ha!" he mocked before Edna could even answer his question.
<br><br>
He reached out his hand, going towards Edna's neck.
<br><br>
Despite how powerful he appeared to be, the Moon Shield City was the territory of the Bearing race. No one could risk stirring up trouble here.
<br><br>
As he clenched the fabric of Edna's collar, strong hatred filled the dungeon.
<br><br>
It was hot in the dungeon, yet Edna and the guard froze. They felt cold saturating the place as if it was an ice cellar.
<br><br>
The creatures in the entire Source World felt a rising pressure as well, but it was much stronger in the dungeon of the Blood Sea Province.
<br><br>
"Is he coming after me?" the guard murmured with eyes wide open in disbelief.
<br><br>
He looked at Edna who was staring at a spot behind him.
<br><br>
The guard turned around and saw a handful of dust slowly whirling on the ground.
<br><br>
The dungeon of the Moon Shield City was forcefully dug out from the ground. Its walls, ground, and ceiling were made of earth. Dust would naturally fall from either the ceiling or the walls all year round.
<br><br>
After the dust and soil twirled across the ground, they quickly gathered into a mass that formed a figure.
<br><br>
It turned from the size of a fist into a humanoid shape.
<br><br>
It looked exactly like the Evil God! "Darling..." Edna called out as she recognized the figure.
<br><br>
"What nonsense are you talking about? It's a man made of soil. It's just a trick!" the guard said.
<br><br>
He paced towards the man of soil and thrust his spear into its body, crushing it into pieces.
<br><br>
But much to his surprise, the smashed man of soil instantly returned to its original form.
<br><br>
Soil kept falling from the ceiling and walls, and in a blink of an eye, a dozen men of soil assembled.
<br><br>
As a powerful cultivator of the Other Shore Realm, the guard had the strength of forty divine megatons. It was a piece of cake for him to handle these men of soil.
<br><br>
He tried to smash the men of soil with the spear in his hand once again.
<br><br>
At that moment, Edna was at ease. 'Evil God didn't come here in person.
<br><br>
He used some secret skill, ' she thought to herself.
<br><br>
It was easy for the guard to deal with the men of soil in the beginning, but soon it became difficult as their bodies became harder each time they restored to their original state.
<br><br>
He thrust his spear forcibly, boring a deep hole into the abdomen of the man of soil, but as he tried to draw his weapon from its body, he couldn't pull it out anymore.
<br><br>
"Damn it! These men of soil.... they are..."
<br><br>
The guard felt scared, even regretful that he chose to attack the men of soil.
<br><br>
'I could have just run away. Why did I stay here to fight them?' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
The men of soil ran towards the guard. They grabbed him by his hands, disabling him to move.
<br><br>
The man of soil then pulled out the spear from its abdomen. The guard continued struggling to loosen their grip. He tried to squirm in an attempt to break free when the man of soil suddenly thrust the spear into him.
<br><br>
The guard gasped as he felt the spear pierce through his elixir field. He was dying with every second. The men of soil threw him to the ground.
<br><br>
Then one of them walked up to Edna.
<br><br>
It looked exactly like the Evil God.
<br><br>
With a smile on her face, Edna approached the man of soil. She opened her arms in a bid to hug it.
<br><br>
But she stopped, shocked at the sight in front of her.
<br><br>
The man with a splitting image of the Evil God pointed the spear at her.
<br><br>
"I don't have time for weakness," it said while it tightened its grip.
<br><br>
Edna's smiling face turned deadly pale.
<br><br>
She knew the Evil God better than anyone else.
<br><br>
In an instant, she already understood the Evil God's plan.
<br><br>
"My dear, are you still going to kill me?" Edna asked. Tears cornered her eyes as she bit her lips.
<br><br>
"Yes," the man of soil answered, emotionless.
<br><br>
Without any complaint, she stood straight, closed her eyes, and waited for the man of soil to kill her next.
<br><br>
Although the guard was dying, he remained in his right senses. He was dumbfounded as he witnessed the scene.
<br><br>
'So those men of soil came here to kill and not save this woman? She and her husband must be out of their minds!' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
After a while, Edna felt the man of soil stroke her face with its hand.
<br><br>
The man caressed her and said, "Wait for me here. I'll come to get you."
<br><br>
It kissed Edna gently and stepped back.
<br><br>
Seeing Edna submit to her fate calmly, the Evil God didn't have the heart to do it. He was taken over by guilt.
<br><br>
He just couldn't cut ties with her.
<br><br>
Under his manipulation, the men of soil destroyed and turned the dungeon into a mess. They killed the warden and guards to keep Edna alive for the time being.
<br><br>
In order not to arouse the suspicion of the Bearing race, the Evil God created lots of men of soil in other places under their jurisdiction. He controlled them to cause chaos in those areas.
<br><br>
After that, the Evil God said to the Shera and the former captain, "I am going to drop by the Blood Sea Province."
<br><br>
"Blood Sea Province..." Shera repeated. She arched her eyebrows as she thought for a while. "No, you can't go there. That's the place of the Bearing race!" she disagreed strongly.
<br><br>
Although the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race both suffered a great casualty in the battle of the Pear Hill, Othniel was still alive and the Bearing race had the Element Spirit Civilization to support them.
<br><br>
It was highly risky to break into the territory of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"I'm not asking for permission," the Evil God said indifferently. "Did you forget who I am?"
<br><br>
He was the owner of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
The former captain and Shera were his subordinates and they took orders from him.
<br><br>
Soon, the black ship turned around and sailed towards the ancestral land of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Chapter 4120 Kill Them Everyone in the entire Source World was shocked by the recent events that just unfolded.
<br><br>
From the super forces in the cities, to even the small races living in the remotest places, everyone discussed amongst themselves and tried to figure out who released that sudden stream of consciousness and resentment.
<br><br>
Some of them guessed that it was Zen who had caused all this.
<br><br>
What happened in the large provinces under the control of the Bearing race was even more bizarre.
<br><br>
Men made of soil, of all shapes and sizes, appeared in droves and set out to burn, kill, and plunder everything in their path.
<br><br>
These strange men of soil had varying levels of strength, but all ended up dying by the hands of the warriors of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
The men of soil that attacked the Moon Shield City of the Blood Sea Province were of the largest number. The warden, a bunch of prison guards and prisoners died in the dungeon.
<br><br>
Those prisoners who were lucky enough to survive were temporarily transferred and imprisoned in the north of the city.
<br><br>
Edna and the other prisoners had finally left the dark dungeon only to get locked up in a huge, iron cage.
<br><br>
Edna couldn't help but lean against the bars of the cage and stare into the distance with unease.
<br><br>
It seemed that the Evil God was able to obtain the power that was beyond her imagination.
<br><br>
This was something that had been inevitable in her eyes. The Evil God was talented and she always knew it was only a matter of time before he truly became a force to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
However, if he did come, he would have to face off against the entire Bearing race and directly fight against Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
"I heard Yellow Thearch is at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
He's inherited the most powerful bloodline.
<br><br>
No one can step into the Eternal Realm in these years.
<br><br>
With my husband's strength, how could he be his match?"
<br><br>
The other prisoners soon found out that Edna seemed to have lost her mind. She kept muttering under her breath all day long, just repeating those words every single day.
<br><br>
"Can you not come over? Please..."
<br><br>
Of course, the Evil God could hear her.
<br><br>
However, her begging did not work whatsoever.
<br><br>
The black ship continued to sail at an unprecedented high speed.
<br><br>
A layer of invisible space membrane was wrapped around it so it seemed as if it swam through ordinary space. In truth, however, it was moving within an independent space where its speed increased tenfold.
<br><br>
In just four days, the black ship was able to cross dozens of provinces and soon arrived at the edge of the Bearing race's territory: the Black Gorge Province.
<br><br>
Over the years, both the Bearing and the Divine Farmer races expanded their territories by occupying large provinces. Soon enough, the two races became neighbors.
<br><br>
Compared to the other super forces, these two races adopted a special feature for their territories. A green, crystal wall was erected in between every two provinces wherein modified Sanskrit words were written.
<br><br>
Only the members of their own races could pass through the walls. Any outsider who dared enter would have to break the walls and fight against the two races.
<br><br>
Underneath the Black Gorge Province's crystal wall was a huge outpost position wherein a huge bear statue was erected.
<br><br>
The black ship soon arrived at the outpost position, which quickly attracted the people's attention.
<br><br>
Dozens of people came out from the outpost to look at these new arrivals.
<br><br>
Most of those who came out were at the eighth or ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm, three were at the thirteenth stage, and one was at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
It seemed this outpost position was composed of very powerful people.
<br><br>
A warrior at the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm yawned and said, "It seems another reckless idiot gets lost."
<br><br>
"Wouldn't it be better if it is a cargo ship that gets lost? At least we'd be able to get something from them," another warrior at the ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm remarked.
<br><br>
These warriors were powerful but there was no denying that their jobs here were quite boring.
<br><br>
A lost ship was a potential source of fun, so there was no way they would let it go so easily.
<br><br>
Nobody in the entire Source World could afford to offend the Bearing race, so they usually got away with their crimes. Even trade groups dared not say anything when they forced them to hand over their stuff.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Realm warriors all flew up towards the ship as it arrived with the full intent of crossing the crystal wall.
<br><br>
Only the Chaotic Source Realm warrior didn't make a move.
<br><br>
As he stared at the approaching ship, he felt that something was wrong.
<br><br>
There was no indication at all of the ship slowing down as it approached, almost as if it was determined to hit the crystal wall.
<br><br>
When the ship got close enough, the Chaotic Source Realm warrior's eyes widened in recognition. "That's the Black Ship!"
<br><br>
Although the Black Ship was famous in the Source World, most people had yet to see it with their own eyes. This Chaotic Source Realm warrior had only seen it once but was immediately able to recognize it at a glance.
<br><br>
When the Other Shore Realm warriors heard his words, their faces immediately darkened.
<br><br>
The Black Ship was famous for its overpowering warriors. The weakest ones there were at the Holy Soul Realm. There was no way that mere Other Shore Realm warriors like them would be able to face against them! Like mice that suddenly met with the big cats, the warriors quickly retreated.
<br><br>
"Don't panic. Even if it is the Black Ship, it will still take them a long time to break the crystal wall without our special Sanskrit word." Heightened with caution, the Chaotic Source Realm warrior saw it fit to assure his allies.
<br><br>
Murmurs of approval followed. "That's right. The crystal wall isn't that easy to break."
<br><br>
"Inform the defending troops of the province! Quickly!"
<br><br>
"Tell them the Black Ship is coming!"
<br><br>
This crystal wall was rebuilt through a method provided by the Element Spirit Civilization and its strength was three times stronger than other, ordinary, crystal walls.
<br><br>
Since the black ship refused to slow down, it soon got to the point where it was about to hit the crystal wall.
<br><br>
Shera couldn't help but turn towards the Evil God. "This crystal wall seems to be a little different."
<br><br>
They had passed through several crystal walls before this.
<br><br>
Those walls were completely under the Evil God's control so that whenever the black ship approached, a huge hole would appear as if greeting to let them through.
<br><br>
However, this crystal wall did not do that. The Evil God, however, merely sported a look of indifference. "It's been modified. Just change it back."
<br><br>
As he thought for a moment, the thick crystal wall began to twist crazily.
<br><br>
The green light within quickly faded and turned into amber in just a blink of an eye! Clatter! A huge crack soon appeared and let the black ship pass through with no resistance whatsoever.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Realm warrior from the Bearing race could only stare up in shock as the ship easily made its way inside their previously protected province.
<br><br>
The other Other Shore Realm warriors were also dumbfounded to the point of silence.
<br><br>
The Evil God stood on deck and looked down at the people in indifference.
<br><br>
"Weak as ants," he uttered in distaste.
<br><br>
Rumble, rumble, rumble...
<br><br>
From below, the originally solid ground let out a roar, and stone pillars suddenly came out of nowhere. Each pillar stabbed through the warriors that guarded the outpost position.
<br><br>
"Run away!"
<br><br>
Having realized the hopelessness of their situation, the Chaotic Source Realm warrior gave the order and was about to use the Grand Teleportation.
<br><br>
The other warriors thought the same thing and intended to escape as far away as possible.
<br><br>
However, when they used the space theurgy, they found that the space had no reaction—it had been sealed.
<br><br>
This feat, sealing the space, was a piece of cake for the Evil God.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the members of the Bearing race found themselves wrapped in endless stalagmites.
<br><br>
These stalagmites were as powerful as those men of soil! A blow could shatter these stalagmites but it did not completely destroy them, as they reconstructed and their strength doubled.
<br><br>
Not long after, the warriors found themselves impaled onto the stalagmites.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Realm warrior soon exhausted his strength as he lay dying upon a stalagmite pillar. "I'm the direct descendant of the Ji Clan! You cannot kill me like this!" he roared.
<br><br>
When he said those words, the stalagmites suddenly stopped and a glimmer of hope rose in his chest. It seemed that the Ji Clan's reputation still terrified people.
<br><br>
However, he soon found out that his assumption was wrong.
<br><br>
"A member of the Ji Clan? Then it would be best if you die a slow, painful death."
<br><br>
The stalagmites slowly rotated and caused the Chaotic Source Realm warrior intense pain as they drove deep within his flesh.
<br><br>
Shera stared at the sight with a grimace. "Are you going to kill all of them like this?" she asked.
<br><br>
The Evil God shrugged. "I guess so."
<br><br>
The corners of Shera's eyes twitched.
<br><br>
This guy was truly crazy. She had no idea what he aimed to achieve with all this chaos.
<br><br>
Chapter 4121 The Last Bit Of Obsession (Part One) The method the Evil God used to destroy cities and murder people required little to no effort from him.
<br><br>
Every time the Black Ship passed by a big city, countless stalagmites would emerge from the ground.
<br><br>
Because no one knew the exact locations where the stalagmites would emerge from, when they did, the city would collapse and it would cause great chaos on the land.
<br><br>
With the stalagmites doing all the job, he didn't even have to break a sweat in doing what he wished to do.
<br><br>
The stalagmites also made it incredibly difficult for people of all kinds who wished to flee the land to do so. These included the True Gods, warriors at the Other Shore Realm, and even warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm. Even if they attempted to escape to the best of their abilities, the stalagmites would continue to emerge from nowhere, block their paths, or simply push them to the brink of exhaustion until they fully decided to give up.
<br><br>
Some big cities were guarded by warriors at the Holy Soul Realm, who would charge towards the Black Ship to stop it from causing further damage.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God steered the ship as if it were lightning.
<br><br>
The ship was so fast that as soon as the warriors at the Holy Soul Realm arrived at the destination where the it was said to have been, the ship would already have left.
<br><br>
The warriors, however, not being able to accept this, would make use of the spatial transference, only to discover that the space was sealed. As they looked back, they would realize that in the moments they spent in trying to use the spatial transference, their city had already been destroyed by the uncountable stalagmites.
<br><br>
It was a scene that happened again and again, but no one seemed to learn much from it.
<br><br>
Wherever the Black Ship passed, the place was left in ruins.
<br><br>
After flying across and destroying several territories, the Black Ship neared the Blood Sea Province.
<br><br>
In the Moon Shield City stood three powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm, all left with the duty of protecting the city.
<br><br>
Recently, the Bearing race had suffered a lot. The presence of the Black Ship was more than enough reason for the people of the Bearing race to not sleep at night. However, their strongest warrior of the Ji Clan had still not done anything to better their situation, which caused distrust and panic among the people.
<br><br>
The three warriors at the Holy Soul Realm, who were meant to protect the Moon Shield City, were also deeply anxious as they stood in a hall.
<br><br>
"I hope the Black Ship bypasses our Blood Sea Province! Please let the ship streak straight to the Grand Cyan Province!" a long-haired warrior at the Holy Soul Realm said.
<br><br>
"I wish so too, but I fear it's impossible," an old man at the Holy Soul Realm said. "The Black Ship is simply going on a straight route. They're not even afraid that their path's become predictable. They don't care if someone is right on their tail or plans to ambush them. They're confident they'll be able to defeat anyone or anything standing in their way. That's what makes them even scarier," he continued.
<br><br>
The old man showed the guards his map, which had a straight, black line indicating the course the Black Ship had been taking—from where it had been to where it was heading to.
<br><br>
From what the map showed, it did seem impossible that the ship even had the slightest intention of avoiding the Blood Sea Province. It seemed clear that they were heading right for it.
<br><br>
The question they needed to be answered, however, was what the Blood Sea Province had that piqued the interest of the Evil God and his Black Ship so much.
<br><br>
There was absolutely nothing in the area he could have use for! All they had was a military stronghold, nothing else.
<br><br>
"This is ridiculous. The Black Ship will arrive any minute, ready to turn our province into a cave floor. We're all about to meet our doom, and the Yellow Thearch is still nowhere to be found. Where could he possibly be? What could be more important than this?" Jimena Ji said, raking her hair with her fingers in heavy frustration. She was Yellow Thearch's niece, her status even ranking among the top five in the Ji Clan.
<br><br>
"Do you think the reason your uncle isn't here is that he was seriously injured in the battle at the Pear Hill?" the old man said in an obvious attempt to retrieve a definite answer from the rumors.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch was an Eternal Realm warrior, which meant he served an extremely important part in the race's security from attacks. Eternal Realm warriors were the backbones of the super forces. If this backbone collapsed, not only would it be a devastating blow to the entire Ji clan but also to the entire race.
<br><br>
"I don't know. Maybe he has other plans," Jimena Ji sighed.
<br><br>
Only a very small number of people knew that Yellow Thearch had been seriously injured, and she had to keep it secret.
<br><br>
Suddenly, they all felt something approaching. Its presence was nearly unbearable. They all rushed out of the hall, shooting themselves into the air as swiftly as they could.
<br><br>
From their view, much to their dismay, they saw a black ship floating above the Moon Shield City.
<br><br>
"Octavio, you stay here. Guard the Moon Shield City.
<br><br>
Jimena, come with me. We're going to stop the Black Ship,"
<br><br>
the old man commanded.
<br><br>
The old man and Jimena Ji rushed towards the Black Ship and blocked its way. They readied themselves for its attacks.
<br><br>
However, strangely enough, the Black Ship did not act as they expected.
<br><br>
This situation was unlike they had ever heard of before, making the old man feel uneasy.
<br><br>
From what they had heard in the past, the ship was always flying at an incredibly rapid speed.
<br><br>
When the Black Ship passed through a city, the city would be destroyed.
<br><br>
Nothing would be left of it. This was why the old man asked Octavio to stay put and guard the Moon Shield City. However, nothing was happening. It was all too strange.
<br><br>
A few moments passed until they heard heavy footsteps on the deck.
<br><br>
Walking out was the Evil God. His eyes scanned the surroundings, only to meet Jimena Ji's.
<br><br>
When this happened, an unidentifiable expression crossed Jimena Ji's face.
<br><br>
They sensed a familiar aura from each other, almost like they had met each other before. And in some way, they did.
<br><br>
In the past, after Yellow Thearch brought Usman back to their race, it was Jimena Ji who was put in charge of training him.
<br><br>
Later, the Evil God had devoured Usman together with the memories he held. Because of this, the Evil god recognized the woman, and oddly enough, felt a desire for her, a desire which stemmed from the young Usman.
<br><br>
Usman grew strong fast under Jimena Ji's borderline torturous training.
<br><br>
She was incredibly tough with him, and her strength drove him mad. He longed for her so deeply.
<br><br>
Chapter 4122 The Last Bit Of Obsession (Part Two) However, during the time, Usman was still too weak to defeat Jimena Ji.
<br><br>
Every time he attempted to throw a punch, he would get a hit first. Every time he attempted to give her a kick, she would be able to dodge it with ease.
<br><br>
He could not defeat her, and he could not stop thinking about her. As time went by, an obsession formed in his mind, and it was emerging at this very moment.
<br><br>
Likewise, Jimena Ji was able to tell the identify of this man through Usman's aura. "You must be the Evil God," she said to him.
<br><br>
"Jimena," the Evil God responded, making it known that he knew who she was.
<br><br>
As the Evil God confirmed her speculation of who he was, she smiled, thinking of ways she could use to her advantage. "Evil God, perhaps there is no reason for us to stand against each other. We can work together," she said and stared at him with her soft and beautiful eyes.
<br><br>
The Evil God sneered at her suggestion. "Are you suggesting we cooperate with you? But how?"
<br><br>
"Join us, and we can fight against the Pear Hill together." Jimena Ji replied slyly.
<br><br>
"If you truly wish to cooperate with us, why don't you join my Black Ship? We can fight against the Pear Hill then," the Evil God said smugly.
<br><br>
He was not one that could be convinced so easily, but Jimena Ji refused to give up. She flashed him a seductive look, attempting to have him go more easily on her. "But I'm a member of the Ji Clan. If I join enemy forces by my own will, I would betray my clan. It truly is a pity I can't do so."
<br><br>
The Evil God scoffed. "It is easy. Just become my woman."
<br><br>
She felt the Evil God's longing for her. She smiled, believing she had the upper hand in the situation. "Can you give me at least two days to think about your offer?"
<br><br>
Given the current situation of the Ji Clan, uniting with the Black Ship by marriage should be a good thing.
<br><br>
The entire time, Shera, who was also on the black ship, was listening to the conversation. When she heard what Jimena Ji said, her slender eyebrows immediately shot up.
<br><br>
The Evil God stared at Jimena Ji for a long time, making her believe that he was truly appreciating her beauty. However, in a flash of a second, his entire expression changed. His look of admiration turned into a look of derision.
<br><br>
"The women of the Ji Clan are truly extraordinary. You tried to steer me, didn't you? You wanted to take advantage of Usman's memory to buy more time for yourself. You should have known better. You're about to find out the high price you have to pay to be my woman, but I must tell you, you are not qualified," the Evil God said menacingly.
<br><br>
"Buzz! Buzz!"
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God finished speaking, two conical containers fell on the old man and Jimena Ji, trapping them inside.
<br><br>
When Jimena Ji processed what just happened, she immediately went feral. Her fingers began to emit astonishing energy, clawing at the surface and the walls of the container in an attempt to free herself.
<br><br>
Crack! The energy radiating from her fingertips was from an Other Shore Token on Stage Thirty-three. The energy was so strong and powerful that anything it touched would be destroyed.
<br><br>
The conical space was no exception. She placed her hands upon one of its walls. When she removed her fingers, the surface revealed ten, burning prints. After a few seconds, the container broke into tiny pieces.
<br><br>
She thought she was free. She was ready to attack the Evil God. However, right after she broke the first conical container, a second conical container came from above her head, entrapping her body once again. She looked up, only to see that a third one was waiting to go down on her once she escaped the one she was currently in. And forming above the third one was another conical container, and another waited after that— all waiting for their turn to imprison the Ji Clan warriors.
<br><br>
From the hands of the Evil God appeared two streams of Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
He flew into the sky, making his way towards the conical containers. He placed his hands upon them, and streams of Ways-blending energy began to gather within the containers.
<br><br>
The Evil God gave a sinister laugh. "Have you ever seen the most perfect power of the Godly Ways Great Unity? You must look at how majestic it is, and you are about to know how majestic it feels. As the first one to die under it, you should feel honored."
<br><br>
In the past, the Evil God was almost killed by Maximized Energy, but at that time, the energy of all the Godly Ways had been perfectly fused. It wasn't him at the end of the stick anymore. This time, it was him holding it.
<br><br>
Feeling the strength of the energy's aura, Jimena Ji began to panic, pushing on the walls of the container as hard as she could. This could not be the end of her. She had to find a way to survive. Her mind was already going haywire.
<br><br>
"We can talk about this! The Ji Clan will agree to our marriage! I'll be yours! You can be my master!" she screamed, tears streaming down her cheeks.
<br><br>
The Evil God began to raise his arms.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! They all heard two muffled sounds coming from inside the conical containers.
<br><br>
The entire scene was terrifying. The energy the Evil God used was enough to destroy more than half of the province, and he locked it all up in the conical containers, where none of the energy was able to leak out.
<br><br>
Both the old man and Jimena Ji had completely disappeared.
<br><br>
Octavio, who stood guard before Moon Shield City, was left paralyzed by what he saw. He did not know how to react.
<br><br>
The old man and Jimena Ji were among the top five warriors from the Bearing race. They had fought and survived numerous battles. Had they just died like this? Was this the end of them? Octavio could not bear to think about it.
<br><br>
As his mind began to weaken so did his body. He began to tremble, both out of fear and exhaustion. He lost all will to fight, fleeing from the scene and into the furthest end of Moon Shield City.
<br><br>
The Evil God knew there was another warrior at the Holy Soul Realm on the run, but he had no interest in hunting him down. He already accomplished what he came here to do.
<br><br>
Now that Jimena was done for, so was Usman's obsession for her, his heart finally silencing its call. "Show's over," he told his crew. They then left, heading north of the city.
<br><br>
Chapter 4123 Absolute Trust The commotion over the Moon Shield City went practically unnoticed, even with the death of two cultivators at the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
The people didn't stir, possibly because they didn't even know that two cultivators had just been killed.
<br><br>
Just then, the Evil God was slowly descending into the prison in the north of the city.
<br><br>
The prison guards barked orders at each other while swarming out to rush towards him.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Evil God, these guards meant absolutely nothing to him.
<br><br>
Barely even shooting them a glance, countless stalagmites as thick as wrists suddenly popped out from the ground and strung the guards together.
<br><br>
Then, the prison's walls and fences collapsed with a loud bang, frightening the prisoners inside.
<br><br>
The prisoners didn't dare to make a move, staring fearfully at the Evil God who was descending from the sky.
<br><br>
With a smile on her face, Edna slowly walked towards the Evil God as he landed on the prison ground.
<br><br>
She had been consumed with worry and had hoped that the Evil God wouldn't come in person. However, now that he was here, she couldn't help but be drawn towards him.
<br><br>
Without uttering a word, she fell into the arms of her husband.
<br><br>
"Let's go," the Evil God whispered into her ear.
<br><br>
Wrapping his arms around her waist tightly, he then launched themselves into the sky and flew to the deck of the black ship.
<br><br>
As soon as she set foot on the deck, she felt a blazing gaze boring into the back of her head.
<br><br>
Turning around, she saw Shera glaring at her with a hint of jealousy.
<br><br>
Edna met Shera's gaze calmly. "Nice to meet you."
<br><br>
Shera was planning to say something first, but was immediately caught off guard by Edna's courteous greeting. At a loss for words, she didn't respond.
<br><br>
However, seeing Edna leaning on the Evil God intimately, she felt her heart sink.
<br><br>
The Evil God had come all the way to the Blood Sea Province to save Edna. What more could she say? However, Shera was a veteran in battle. Surely she could survive these trivial matters. Forcing a smile, she asked in a strained voice, "Who are you to him? What are you doing in the Blood Sea Province?"
<br><br>
"She's my wife, and she's also from Zen's inner world," the Evil God suddenly cut in, answering for her. "Not long ago, Zen let her go, but she was taken here by the Bearing race."
<br><br>
"I see," Shera said through gritted teeth. "Since we've saved her already, can we go now?"
<br><br>
She and the former captain had predicted that the Yellow Thearch would take action shortly after they entered the Bearing race's territory. However, he hadn't shown up since, which made Shera feel a bit uneasy.
<br><br>
Since the Yellow Thearch didn't show up, there was no need for the Black Ship to stir up any more trouble. Now, leaving the territory of the Bearing race seemed like the best choice.
<br><br>
"No." The Evil God shook his head. "The Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer are coming soon. I want to challenge them."
<br><br>
Hearing this, both Shera and the former captain, who was standing nearby, frowned slightly.
<br><br>
Along the way, the former captain had been reporting the situation of the Evil God to the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
There were too many risks involved in challenging the Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
He had to ask Grandmaster of Heaven for advice.
<br><br>
To his disdain, however, the Grandmaster of Heaven had no means to stop the Evil God. Instead, he hoped to assess the true strength of the Evil God.
<br><br>
However, in order to do so, he wanted the Evil God to fight the Yellow Thearch alone.
<br><br>
If the Divine Farmer got involved, the situation would change drastically.
<br><br>
Edna looked at her husband when he said that. She had heard of the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
Back in the Flow Sword Sect, she had asked for information on the masters in the Source World.
<br><br>
These two were Eternal Realm masters.
<br><br>
And the way to the Eternal Realm had been sealed, so at this point, it was impossible for the Evil God to reach the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Even so, she no longer felt anxious. She had learned to trust in her husband.
<br><br>
"Are you confident you'll win?" the former captain asked. "Shera and I can help you pin down one of them."
<br><br>
Although there were no other members left, there was still Shera, who was at the top level of the Holy Soul Realm, and the former captain himself, an Eternal Realm warrior.
<br><br>
"There's no need for you to do anything. They're already here," the Evil God said, turning suddenly to look at the space on the side of the ship.
<br><br>
"I'm sure they've heard what I just said."
<br><br>
Buzz! A unique triangular space appeared, and from within, the figures of the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer floated.
<br><br>
The triangular space had completely sealed off the auras of the two people. They were so close, yet the former captain and Shera didn't notice them till the Evil God pointed them out.
<br><br>
"Young people are really something. You haven't even reached the Holy Soul Realm, yet you dare to challenge the two of us," the Yellow Thearch said calmly, locking eyes with the Evil God.
<br><br>
The corners of the Evil God's mouth curled up slightly. "I'm a little curious. In just a few days, you seem to have changed into a different person. Is the Blood-controlling Method really so powerful?"
<br><br>
At the mention of the Blood-controlling Method, the Yellow Thearch's expression darkened slightly. "How did you know?"
<br><br>
The Evil God looked at him knowingly, as though he could see everything the world had to offer. "The Source World can't keep too many secrets from me."
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch's frown deepened.
<br><br>
This ability was much too terrifying! Usman, who they cultivated so painstakingly, turned out to be a steppingstone for the Evil God.
<br><br>
However, the more the Yellow Thearch thought about it, his heart began to beat faster.
<br><br>
Usman wasn't strong enough to control the Source World.
<br><br>
Obviously, the Evil God was infinitely stronger than Usman, at least in terms of merging with the Source World.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch began to explore the idea of using the Evil God. If he could somehow find a way to control or devour him, he could benefit greatly.
<br><br>
"Well, we're not ones to step down from a challenge. Let's fight to the last breath, right here, right now." As the Yellow Thearch spoke, he turned his head towards the sky. "Othniel!"
<br><br>
A huge creature suddenly appeared in the sky above the Blood Sea Province.
<br><br>
With the huge creature blotting out the sun, a huge shadow fell over the entire province. Confused, the people in the Moon Shield City looked to the sky to see what was going on. Chaos ensued as the people's hearts were struck with fear.
<br><br>
If a battle this massive were to take place, the whole Blood Sea Province would suffer collateral damage! "Othniel is here!"
<br><br>
Shera and the former captain frowned deeply as they watched the huge creature hovering in the sky.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer were already a handful to begin with. Now, with the Chaos Ancient God Othniel involved, the Black Ship had no chance of winning.
<br><br>
The first thing the former captain thought of was to ask the Grandmaster of Heaven to come help them.
<br><br>
"This place is not large enough. Come into my illusion!"
<br><br>
As soon as Othniel finished speaking, a triangular door appeared in front of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Othniel's invitation was a thinly veiled challenge.
<br><br>
"You are all famous masters in the chaos. It's ridiculous for you to stoop so low as to face the Evil God together," Shera shouted to them. Then, turning to the Evil God, she pleaded, "Don't fall into their trap, please!"
<br><br>
The Evil God looked at the triangular door and pressed his hand against it cautiously. Closing his eyes, he tried to feel the space beyond it. Turning to his wife, he said abruptly, "Wait for me." Without further hesitation, he entered the door and disappeared in it.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The very next moment, the triangular door closed and vanished.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch, the Divine Farmer, and Othniel also disappeared quickly.
<br><br>
The people of the Moon Shield City were all relieved to see that the huge creature was gone. Naturally, they didn't want to suffer from collateral damage.
<br><br>
"The Evil God has gone in! What should we do now?" Shera cried anxiously.
<br><br>
Without a word, the former captain sat down cross-legged and began to recite the Truth of Godly Way. He planned to enter the Other Shore again to communicate with the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Seeing how flustered Shera was, Edna took her hand gently. "Don't worry, my husband will be fine. He will win."
<br><br>
"You know nothing!"
<br><br>
Shera yanked her hand away, shooting Edna an indignant glare.
<br><br>
How could a weak True God know how fierce the battle of top masters was? What Shera said stunned Edna, but she decidedly remained calm. "I don't know who is stronger, but I know my husband. Since he asked me to wait for him, he will definitely come back."
<br><br>
Edna's eyes shone with an almost child-like innocence as she spoke. Shera turned away in disgust, secretly praying in her heart that what Edna was saying was true.
<br><br>
Chapter 4124 Life And Death Holy Way The illusory space created by Othniel looked as though it was made up of countless huge spaces.
<br><br>
It seemed like the illusory space extended infinitely. If one looked from afar, even Othniel's massive body looked minuscule compared to the vastness of the space.
<br><br>
"That guy is brave. He went straight in, no hesitation." Othniel's voice echoed throughout the illusory space.
<br><br>
"If I didn't come on my own volition, you'd have dragged me in," the Evil God said calmly.
<br><br>
"It's good that you know that," Othniel smiled, shooting the Evil God an amused glance. "I'm sure you can tell what the outcome of this battle will be. Why not surrender now?"
<br><br>
"The outcome of this battle?" the Evil God echoed, eyebrows shooting up angrily. His tone suddenly grew serious. "The only outcome I can see is of you being torn to pieces."
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and Othniel all burst into laughter, as though they'd just heard the funniest joke in the world.
<br><br>
Othniel continued, "This is an illusory space. There's no way you'll come close to even hurting me here. I appreciate your courage, though. Beg for mercy now, and I'll grant you a swift death!"
<br><br>
"Illusory space?"
<br><br>
The Evil God raised his hand and closed his eyes to feel the space around him.
<br><br>
He sensed that the rules which kept the space running were completely independent.
<br><br>
"It's true that you have created this independent illusory space, but this space is still within the Source World..." the Evil God suddenly said, opening his eyes to shoot Othniel a mischievous glance.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" asked Othniel, visibly confused.
<br><br>
"Can you bear the external pressure?" the Evil God asked and smiled menacingly.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, the whole Source World shook.
<br><br>
Then, it shrank slightly...
<br><br>
While the Source World only shrank by a minuscule fraction, under the Evil God's control, it seemed to affect the illusory space on a large scale.
<br><br>
In other words, the illusory space was compressed by the Source World! "Crackle..."
<br><br>
As the external pressure hounded on the illusory space, the seemingly infinite background that once looked like a giant net suddenly began to crack.
<br><br>
"Othniel, what's happening?" Yellow Thearch asked as he worriedly eyed the cracks forming all over the space.
<br><br>
In terms of the use of the space theurgy, no one in the entire chaos could surpass Othniel. Now that the illusory space had actually been broken, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer were quite confused.
<br><br>
"What did you do!? Why is there such a strong pressure?" Othniel couldn't believe his eyes.
<br><br>
"Do you want more pressure?" The Evil God's eyes flashed crazily and he grinned like a madman. "I can deliver!"
<br><br>
He seemed to be enjoying himself immensely.
<br><br>
Truly, it was quite pleasurable, seeing these arrogant warriors' confused expressions.
<br><br>
"Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle..."
<br><br>
The cracks climbed all over the illusory space at a rapid pace. It was only a matter of time before the entire space collapsed.
<br><br>
The Evil God laughed as he thought of an apt metaphor. 'It's like a fragile egg that's constantly being knocked over!' As more and more cracks appeared, the illusory space lost its invisibility and suddenly appeared above the Blood Sea Province. However, everything was in a different hue! "Evil God!"
<br><br>
"Darling!"
<br><br>
Through the cracks, Shera and Edna could observe what was happening within the space.
<br><br>
Othniel growled in rage as he struggled to keep the illusory space together. "Yellow Thearch, kill him immediately!"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch's expression darkened. Gently patting the side of his waist, he summoned a fierce-looking sword. Simultaneously, the bloodline power within him was activated.
<br><br>
Phew! As the bloodline surged excitedly, a holy way appeared and enveloped Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
His bloodline lay in the power of the holy ways.
<br><br>
He had learned how to use his bloodline all by himself, so he had always been under the impression that he had reached the full potential of the power of the holy ways.
<br><br>
However, only after he came into contact with the Blood-controlling Method did he realize that he had been so naive. His use of the bloodline had been too superficial! "Let me show you what the real holy ways are!" he roared.
<br><br>
"Emperor Holy Ways!"
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Ten huge holy ways appeared and enveloped Yellow Thearch. The aura contained within these holy ways was several times more terrifying than before! At the end of each holy way, there was a statue of an emperor, and each statue was different. As the ways intersected with each other, a unique and mysterious aura flooded out.
<br><br>
From outside the battle, the former captain of the Black Ship froze when he saw Yellow Thearch's Emperor Holy Ways. He hadn't found the Grandmaster of Heaven after he entered the Other shore, so he had hurriedly retreated to the Source World, only to stumble upon this heated battle. "I can't believe Yellow Thearch has cultivated the holy ways to such a level..."
<br><br>
Before, the former captain could've sworn that he could face Yellow Thearch in a fight, and that it'd likely end in a draw.
<br><br>
However, seeing the current Yellow Thearch before him, he was sure he didn't stand a chance.
<br><br>
"The Evil God said that he had practiced some Blood-controlling Method, but I never imagined it would increase his bloodline power to such an extent!" Shera exclaimed.
<br><br>
Even as the Evil God watched the Emperor Holy Ways shooting towards him, his expression remained unchanged.
<br><br>
Calmly raising his hand, he vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
A moment later, he appeared at the edge of the space.
<br><br>
"Do you think you can escape?" Othniel's voice boomed.
<br><br>
Then, two footprints floated in the space where the Evil God stood moments earlier. They were exactly Evil God's footprints.
<br><br>
Just as Othniel finished speaking, the Evil God was drawn back, right on top of the footprints.
<br><br>
Phew! The Emperor Holy Ways, which were mixed with numerous sword shadows, all shot towards their target.
<br><br>
It was like a heavy rain of sword shadows pouring towards the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled, his eyes glistening with the reflection of the Emperor Holy Ways closing in on him. "That's your plan? To fix me in a place and then kill me?" The Evil God smiled even wider. "Pathetic."
<br><br>
Then, the Evil God's expression grew serious. Suddenly, the Waysblending Energy began to pour out from his body, turning into colorful little snakes that shot upwards.
<br><br>
Whenever a sword shadow collided with a little snake, a terrifying energy vortex would be produced after a violent explosion.
<br><br>
Just as the Emperor Holy Ways were about to strike down the Evil God's head, hundreds of energy vortexes appeared above him.
<br><br>
"Break!"
<br><br>
The Evil God clapped his hands.
<br><br>
All the energy vortexes rushed up at the same time and collided into the ten Emperor Holy Ways.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom Countless explosions rang throughout the illusory space.
<br><br>
The Emperor Holy Ways, which had initially seemed so terrifyingly powerful, all shattered as they collided with the energy vortexes! "Your so-called power of the holy ways is still too weak," the Evil God sneered. "Even if you have cultivated the Blood-controlling Method, you still can't defeat me."
<br><br>
Hearing what the Evil God said, Yellow Thearch frowned slightly.
<br><br>
His bloodline was indeed not that strong, something he realized when he battled with Fuxi in the past. Although the power of the holy ways was intimidating, it was quite fragile and easy to break. This was one of the reasons why he had been depressed.
<br><br>
However, that was in the past, not now.
<br><br>
Now that he had obtained more incredible theurgies through the Bloodcontrolling Method, he felt confident his bloodline was stronger than that of any of the Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
"Is that so? Maybe it was true in the past, but not now! Let me show you the complete power of the holy ways!"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch grinned fiercely and pointed his sword towards the Evil God.
<br><br>
A slender blood line, as thin as thread, suddenly enveloped the Evil God.
<br><br>
More blood lines appeared and these blood lines formed indistinguishable paths.
<br><br>
Through the cultivation of the Blood-controlling Method, Yellow Thearch had gained much insight.
<br><br>
When the Evil God was busying himself in destroying the territory of the Bearing race, Yellow Thearch had seized this opportunity to cultivate the Blood-Controlling Method. This was why the Evil God met no obstacles on his journey to the Blood Sea Province.
<br><br>
A powerful holy way didn't necessarily have a physical form.
<br><br>
All the kinds of holy ways that the Yellow Thearch had cultivated before were visible and had form.
<br><br>
Even the powerful Emperor Holy Ways still belonged to the visible ways.
<br><br>
However, Yellow Thearch later discovered that the strongest holy way was actually invisible.
<br><br>
"Life and Death Holy Way!"
<br><br>
This time, no holy way could be seen. Only a few, barely visible lines faintly glowed in the space.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
Those thin lines instantly shot towards the Evil God like possessed silk threads.
<br><br>
The second the threads of holy ways touched the Evil God, he felt his body tremble slightly, then he collapsed. All the life force in his eyes faded away, and his smirk was immediately wiped from his face.
<br><br>
"Anyone who enters my Life and Death Holy Way are bound to meet their doom there. Feel free to take your time before you finish your journey..."
<br><br>
A pitiful look flashed in Yellow Thearch's eyes as he said this.
<br><br>
Chapter 4125 An Indestructible Enemy Even Yellow Thearch himself was afraid of the power of the Life and Death Holy Way.
<br><br>
The power of the Life and Death Holy Way was outrageous and overpowering. Whoever stepped into the way would voluntarily walk towards their doom.
<br><br>
There wasn't a trace of struggle nor hope...
<br><br>
They all appeared to be willing to step into destruction and die on their own.
<br><br>
It was more like a mysterious type of Other Shore Token than a kind of bloodline power.
<br><br>
If Yellow Thearch himself accidentally stepped into it, he would be killed as well.
<br><br>
Despite the danger it held, the Life and Death Holy Way was Yellow Thearch's most powerful trump card.
<br><br>
This time, he used this trump card to face the Evil God without hesitation.
<br><br>
The Evil God walked slowly along the void like a lifeless puppet.
<br><br>
His body quickly turned into wisps of black smoke and gradually dissolved.
<br><br>
He deteriorated from the outside–starting from the locks of his hair down to his flesh and blood. After a short while, only his skeleton was left moving forward. In the end, the skeleton also vanished into a black line.
<br><br>
"He really died just like that?" Divine Farmer said in surprise.
<br><br>
"No one could survive once they step into the Life and Death Holy Way,"
<br><br>
said Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
"Could I resist it?" Othniel asked curiously.
<br><br>
"With your physical body, you might be able to walk a little further along the way, but you still couldn't escape death," Yellow Thearch replied with certainty.
<br><br>
"It's a pity that the Evil God died this way," Divine Farmer said regretfully.
<br><br>
According to the Eye Spirit, it would have been best if they controlled the Evil God.
<br><br>
But he didn't expect Yellow Thearch's Life and Death Holy Way to be so powerful that it could kill the Evil God so soon.
<br><br>
On the black ship, the former captain and Shera stared blankly into space as their eyes were filled with horror.
<br><br>
Had the Evil God been killed by Yellow Thearch? They bargained it was too early to draw such a conclusion.
<br><br>
Previously, when the Evil God merged Godly Ways, he had avoided the explosion of the Maximized Energy. He had also appeared in front of them safe and sound.
<br><br>
The problem was, this time, the Evil God walked the Life and Death Holy Way. They had clearly seen his body dissipate bit by bit.
<br><br>
Edna was left speechless as she stood on the deck.
<br><br>
She didn't know what had happened, but she was more than sure that the Evil God was still alive! "Shall we leave?" Shera asked the captain in a low voice.
<br><br>
The captain smiled hesitantly. "It's too late to leave now."
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
He began to stroke the Descending Ring gently.
<br><br>
Facing Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and Othniel, they could only place their hopes on the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
When the former captain of the Black Ship entered the Other Shore earlier, he found no one in the Amber Cave. The Grandmaster of Heaven would not be able to descend.
<br><br>
The illusory space began to disperse.
<br><br>
Othniel once again hid his huge figure in space.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer flew over and approached the front of the black ship.
<br><br>
"Long time no see. How have you been, captain?" Yellow Thearch greeted with a smile.
<br><br>
In the battle with the Pear Hill, the Black Ship suddenly appeared and took away Usman, which came as a staggering blow to the Bearing race.
<br><br>
This caused a great grudge between them.
<br><br>
The former captain of the Black Ship cupped his hands towards Yellow Thearch. "In only a few months, your strength has improved greatly. Even I feel inferior to you now," he commended.
<br><br>
The smile on Yellow Thearch's face grew even wider. "You are so modest.
<br><br>
I still want to spar with you. I hope you can give me some advice."
<br><br>
"I'm really no match for you," the captain said bluntly, waiting for Yellow Thearch to read between the lines. 'If you want to kill me, just do it, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
As Yellow Thearch heard this, the smile on his face faded. He said directly, "I can let go of the Black Ship, but you have to hand over the Descending Rings in your hands."
<br><br>
Last time, he had suffered a lot and almost died when Claire descended into his body.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization's unique method of summoning powerful warriors from the Other Shore had a bad side effect.
<br><br>
If he obtained the Descending Rings, he would be able to summon the Other Shore creatures, saving him a lot of trouble.
<br><br>
"If you had only asked for something else, we would have tried our best to satisfy you. But if it's about the Descending Rings, sorry, it's nonnegotiable," the captain said firmly.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer said directly, "If we kill you, the Black Ship will be destroyed and the Descending Rings will still fall into our hands."
<br><br>
"Why don't you try?" the captain provoked.
<br><br>
He and Shera were very much aware that they would have to fight to death here.
<br><br>
Just as the two sides were talking, a guard on the city wall of the Moon Shield City suddenly fell to the ground.
<br><br>
The guard trembled as he lay like he was suffering from a seizure.
<br><br>
"Payton, what's happening to you?" Several guards rushed over and attended to him.
<br><br>
One of the guards helped him up and saw that his face was distorted.
<br><br>
The muscles on his face were contracting as if an invisible hand was kneading his flesh! After the contractions stopped, Payton's face returned. The guard who supported him was suddenly startled and reflexively pushed him away.
<br><br>
"You-you're not Payton! Who are you?" he shouted.
<br><br>
It was not Payton's face. It was a face of malice.
<br><br>
The other guards all pulled out their weapons and surrounded the Evil God.
<br><br>
They all thought that a spell had been cast unto Payton.
<br><br>
The Evil God completely ignored them. He took a step forward and floated towards the black ship.
<br><br>
Just as Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer were about to fight the captain, the Evil God suddenly appeared from the other side of the black ship.
<br><br>
"Your opponent is me," he said with a cynical smile.
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer instantly froze.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer also secretly glanced at Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch stared back at him. What did that suspicious look mean? "How could it be? I had clearly just killed you!" Yellow Thearch said angrily.
<br><br>
The Evil God shrugged. "Yes, you killed me, but that doesn't mean I can't be revived."
<br><br>
"How did you come back to life?"
<br><br>
"Why should I tell you?" the Evil God mocked him with a smirk.
<br><br>
"Well then, I'll have to kill you again!"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch raised his sword. Several more lines silently swept towards the Evil God's feet.
<br><br>
Evil God didn't dodge and once again fell into the Life and Death Holy Way.
<br><br>
He walked towards one direction as his head dropped. Black smoke started to emit from his body. His skin, flesh, and bones slowly evaporated into thin air once again.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch was excited to watch it happen all over again. He believed that his strongest skill could successfully kill the Evil God.
<br><br>
He stood on the black ship and looked around, trying to see if the Evil God resurrected.
<br><br>
Shera also inspected the surroundings as she was also curious. How could the Evil God come back to life? The captain smiled bitterly.
<br><br>
He used to be one of the big shots in the chaos, but now he seemed to be excluded and ignored.
<br><br>
Among these people, the weakest one was Edna. She leaned against the rail calmly and didn't look worried at all.
<br><br>
Not long after, another guard had a seizure on the city wall of the Moon Shield City. As his entire body twisted and turned, he transformed into the Evil God. He waved at the Black Ship above and shouted, "Hey, I'm here!"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch's eyes flashed with anger as he was about to rush down.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer took his place ahead of him. "Let me finish him!"
<br><br>
As Divine Farmer swooped down, his bloodline was activated.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he turned into a monster with a goat's head, a tiger's body, and a bull's hooves. A layer of dark black crystal covered his entire body.
<br><br>
This was his fourth form! It was also his most powerful one! With his current physical strength, he was confident to fight anyone headon.
<br><br>
After reaching the city wall, he opened his mouth wide and snatched the Evil God. He chewed forcibly for a few times before swallowing his sudden meal.
<br><br>
Just after Divine Farmer swallowed, another guard's entire body twitched from a distance. A brand new Evil God was now looking slyly at Divine Farmer. With arms crossed, he tapped his fingertips rhythmically as if he was waiting for a next move.
<br><br>
Chapter 4126 Outnumbered As soon as Divine Farmer devoured the Evil God, a new Evil God quickly materialized right in front of him. He was extremely dumbfounded at this strange phenomenon.
<br><br>
He refused to believe that the Evil God had the ability to be reborn an infinite number of times. He indignantly took a step forward and once again grabbed the Evil God with his massive arms, stuffing him into his humongous mouth.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! After he had torn and ground the Evil God's body with his sharp teeth, Divine Farmer quickly swallowed the mass of flesh and bones into his stomach.
<br><br>
However, just as the second Evil God's body had settled in his stomach, one of the guards transformed into a new Evil God, the same smug smile stamped on his face.
<br><br>
'What the hell just happened? How was he able to do that?' Divine Farmer thought incredulously.
<br><br>
Tendrils of fear slowly crept in his mind, but the shame of feeling this fear inside him infuriated him more. Once again, he charged towards the next incarnation of Evil God.
<br><br>
The third, fourth, and fifth Evil Gods were quickly devoured by Divine Farmer, one after the other.
<br><br>
This went on until the last guard on the city wall had been transformed, and subsequently, consumed. There was no Evil God in sight, and Divine Farmer thought he had seen the last of him.
<br><br>
However, even before Divine Farmer had a moment to release a sigh of relief, a dozen more people emerged as they climbed up from the other side of the city wall.
<br><br>
All of these people were just ordinary citizens from Moon Shield City, with no capability to even reach the True God Realm in their original state. But when they reached the top of the city wall after their ascent, their bodies twitched and transformed into more clones of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Did you turn them all into replicas of yourself?" Divine Farmer was starting to lose his mind.
<br><br>
He believed that the real Evil God must be hiding somewhere nearby, controlling these replicas remotely.
<br><br>
The only way he could win was if he found and killed the real Evil God! "Replicas?"
<br><br>
The front-most Evil God slowly raised his hand, a mass of Ways-blending Energy slowly swirled in his palm. "You should have known by now that each of us is a real me."
<br><br>
Divine Farmer was at a loss for words.
<br><br>
He was proud of his sharp teeth that could tear almost everything in the world.
<br><br>
Although the Evil God's body was nowhere near as strong as Zen's, its toughness was comparable to the bodies of Holy Soul Realm warriors.
<br><br>
When Divine Farmer devoured what he thought were replicas, he had already sensed that each one of them was equivalent in strength to the Evil God himself! There wasn't anyone else who had the ability to create such powerful replicas.
<br><br>
"You can revive infinitely using other people's bodies..." Divine Farmer couldn't help but cry out this realization, his voice trembling uncontrollably.
<br><br>
This realization meant that the Evil God was actually an opponent that could forever evade death. He only needed to constantly copy himself to be invincible.
<br><br>
"You got that right," the Evil God smiled cruelly.
<br><br>
He then suddenly lunged towards Divine Farmer, the Ways-blending Energy looked like a comet with a trail of color in the air.
<br><br>
In an attempt to stop Evil God, Divine Farmer extended his strong arm in front of him to strangle the Evil God's neck, but Evil God was fearless. He slammed the Ways-blending Energy into Divine Farmer's outstretched arm.
<br><br>
Crack! Boom! Divine Farmer had snapped the Evil God's neck like a wooden branch.
<br><br>
However, the Ways-blending Energy had already exploded and ravaged Divine Farmer's arm.
<br><br>
A blindingly bright flash of light suddenly lit up the entire place, and was extinguished as quickly as it came.
<br><br>
When the explosion had died down, the black crystals that covered Divine Farmer's body had all cracked.
<br><br>
"My Wonder Body..." Divine Farmer couldn't help but feel heartbroken and depressed as he gazed at his damaged body.
<br><br>
The Wonder Body was the most powerful form of Divine Farmer's bloodline theurgies. It was even more than ten times stronger than the goat monster he had transformed into.
<br><br>
Ideally, in his current state, even a Chaos Ancient God would not be able to go head-to-head with him in melee combat. Unfortunately, the Waysblending Energy was so powerful that it had cracked his body all over.
<br><br>
"The complete form of the Ways-blending Energy is supposed to be more powerful than this," another Evil God commented as he stealthily approached from behind Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer's reflexes were quick; he turned around and slammed his fist on the Evil God's head. It was smashed into a bloody mist.
<br><br>
But the Evil God was quicker. He had already landed the Ways-blending Energy on Divine Farmer's back.
<br><br>
Boom! With another bright flash of light and an explosion, several of the black crystals on Divine Farmer's back were also destroyed.
<br><br>
"The full potential of the Ways-blending Energy's power is yet to be discovered..."
<br><br>
"But it won't need more than this to finish you..."
<br><br>
two more Evil Gods chimed in as they closed in on him from both sides.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer flinched in the face of such crazy suicide attacks. He tried to retreat and was about to launch himself into the air, but three more Evil Gods suddenly appeared above his head. One of them grabbed his head, while the other two restrained one arm each.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! A few more explosions of Ways-blending Energy reverberated throughout the place.
<br><br>
Soon, the light died down and the dust eventually settled.
<br><br>
As if by a miracle, Divine Farmer had managed to escape from the ground and hovered in the air.
<br><br>
But, alive as he might be, most of the black crystals that covered his body had now been destroyed. Black blood was spurting out of his wounds. He appeared as pitiful as a drowned mouse.
<br><br>
"How, how were you able to do that?" Divine Farmer gasped, his breathing labored.
<br><br>
"Given your intelligence, you should have been able to figure that out," a new Evil God said as he materialized in front of Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
"You just can't accept the reality," another Evil God appeared behind him simultaneously.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Two more loud thuds, and the Divine Farmer's body was injured more drastically.
<br><br>
His Wonder Body had been blessed with a powerful regeneration ability.
<br><br>
Even though the black crystals covering him were destroyed, they were able to recover at an extremely rapid speed and quickly reshaped to protect him.
<br><br>
But there was a limit even with their recovery speed. The Evil God's destructive power clearly overwhelmed Divine Farmer's healing ability.
<br><br>
Aboard the black ship, Shera's eyes glinted with an unusual light as she commented, "The Evil God wasn't using a resurrection technique. On the contrary, he wasn't killed at all..."
<br><br>
The former captain smiled and turned to Yellow Thearch, "When each and every creature in the world, including us, is a real him, what do you think would be the best way to kill him?"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch clutched his sword tighter as he blankly observed the battle below.
<br><br>
From where he was watching, he could see more Evil Gods approaching rapidly towards Divine Farmer from all over Moon Shield City.
<br><br>
It was such an awe-inspiring scene that Yellow Thearch felt a chill run down his spine.
<br><br>
At that moment, both he and Othniel reached the same conclusion in their minds.
<br><br>
The only way to definitely kill the Evil God, once and for all, was to destroy the entire Source World.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch became more frustrated as he further thought about it. He had only just mastered the powerful Life and Death Holy Way, but that was very insignificant compared to the Evil God's miraculous ability.
<br><br>
"Let's leave this place," Othniel suggested. "We don't have a chance of winning this battle anyway."
<br><br>
Within the entirety of the Source World's range, the Evil God was practically invincible.
<br><br>
Right after uttering his pronouncement, Othniel started to employ the truth power.
<br><br>
He intended to utilize the space power to teleport himself, Yellow Thearch, and Divine Farmer away from the place. While he was focused fully on the task at hand, three Evil Gods appeared silently overhead.
<br><br>
"Why do you want to leave so badly?" one of them asked him.
<br><br>
With that, they released a massive amount of Ways-blending Energy from their bodies that exploded right above Othniel.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! The sky erupted with a blinding white light as if a blazing sun had exploded.
<br><br>
The Chaos Ancient God's body might be colossal in size but it wasn't significantly stronger than Divine Farmer's body.
<br><br>
Luckily, and due to his quick reflexes, Othniel was able to duck swiftly when the Ways-blending Energy exploded, and avoid a huge rift that extended dozens of miles above him.
<br><br>
"Humph! Who are you to stop me from leaving?" Othniel snapped angrily.
<br><br>
Being the Chaos Ancient God who mastered the space truth gave him the ability to come and go as he wished in the entire chaos. He didn't believe that the Evil God would be able to stop him.
<br><br>
A significant amount of truth power radiated from his body.
<br><br>
His gargantuan body started to flicker, as did Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
It went on for several seconds, but they surprisingly remained where they were instead of being teleported away.
<br><br>
Othniel was paralyzed with shock.
<br><br>
As a unique being in the chaos, this was the first time that he did not know what to do anymore.
<br><br>
"What... What did you do?" he asked in a trembling and uneasy voice.
<br><br>
The annoying smile never left Evil God's face. "Did you really expect the Blood Sea Province to be somewhere you can come and go whenever you wanted to?" he snorted insultingly.
<br><br>
As he finished speaking, they saw that multitudes of people throughout the entire Moon Shield City began to convulse before falling to the ground.
<br><br>
Pavilions, prisons, streets... They were everywhere.
<br><br>
When these people stood up, they saw that they were all turned into Evil Gods. They simultaneously used the teleportation technique to quickly reappear upon Othniel's broad back.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, more than ten thousand Evil Gods were now standing on Othniel's back! Chapter 4127 The Fight Is Over Othniel was the most powerful among the six Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
Only a few could be a match for Chaos Ancient Gods. Even if the Chaos Ancient Gods confronted those who were stronger than them, they could manage to run away unscathed.
<br><br>
That was why Othniel successfully fled from the battle in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
This time, however, he encountered an unprecedented crisis.
<br><br>
He activated the truth power in an attempt to teleport himself away.
<br><br>
But even after releasing all his truth power, he couldn't escape nor get rid of the space cage that enclosed him.
<br><br>
Othniel was shocked that someone in the chaos could disable his space theurgy.
<br><br>
He was fully aware that the Evil God couldn't do that.
<br><br>
'This guy is using the power of the Source World.
<br><br>
Had we been outside the Source World, he wouldn't be able to trap me even if he was ten times stronger.
<br><br>
But unfortunately, we are in the Source World.
<br><br>
I was caught unaware.
<br><br>
If I had known that he possessed such powers, I wouldn't have come here.
<br><br>
But it's too late to regret now, ' Othniel pondered as he fumed with anger.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Ways-blending Energy that over ten thousand Evil Gods released blasted simultaneously.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Each Ways-blending Energy exploded, producing a blazing golden light.
<br><br>
It was understandable how thousands of Ways-blending Energy could be fatal.
<br><br>
"You want to take my life? That's not gonna happen!" Othniel shouted.
<br><br>
Faint energy started to fluctuate on the surface of his body, spreading from his trunk and across the length of his limbs.
<br><br>
The energy turned into a layer of azure space armor, quickly covering his huge body.
<br><br>
Making the space armor almost cost Othniel all the truth power. The thick space armor protected him from any energy including the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! The space armor shielded Othniel from the outburst of thousands of Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
After all the deadly explosions of the Ways-blending Energy, he remained uninjured.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! Little useless tricks! You really thought you can hurt me?"
<br><br>
Othniel provoked triumphantly.
<br><br>
The Evil Gods condescendingly looked at Othniel. One of them asked, "Have you always been this stupid?"
<br><br>
Othniel was confused. Then he realized that there were still over ten thousand Evil Gods standing on his back.
<br><br>
He almost forgot that he had to deal with so many opponents. This was the first time that he had been in such a dangerous situation! The Evil Gods stretched out their hands as they mustered the strength to gather the Ways-blending Energy once more.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! All the Ways-blending Energy flew to the sky emitting blazing lights that shone as bright as the sun.
<br><br>
Each Ways-blending Energy pierced Othniel gaping a hole on his body.
<br><br>
After being hit too many times, his massive body became riddled with holes.
<br><br>
He started to descend from the sky like a giant wrecked ship.
<br><br>
Just like that, a Chaos Ancient God perished in the hands of the Evil God.
<br><br>
In the past chaotic eras, there had also been cases where the Sons of Truth, namely Chaos Ancient Gods had been slaughtered.
<br><br>
However, those powerful beings were killed by ruling forces.
<br><br>
Even in the battle of the Pear Hill, the two Chaos Ancient Gods were killed by the crowd and not a single person.
<br><br>
But the Evil God finished Othniel off on his own. It was indeed an unforeseen event.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer stared blankly at the falling Othniel as he sensed fear overwhelming him.
<br><br>
'Othniel died like this? Having been killed by a human?' Divine Farmer thought to himself in sheer shock.
<br><br>
When Divine Farmer transformed into a monster a few moments ago, he felt invincible as if nothing could hurt him a bit.
<br><br>
But after he witnessed Othniel's death, he was not sure if he could survive the Evil God's attacks. At that moment, he only wanted to escape; but at the thought of even Othniel failing to escape, panic and frustration flooded him.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! More Evil Gods teleported themselves to Divine Farmer's side. Once they were near him, the Ways-blending Energy could explode in an instant.
<br><br>
"Please don't...
<br><br>
It doesn't have to come this far! What do you want from me? I can..."
<br><br>
Divine Farmer tried to beg for mercy, but the Evil God was indifferent and simply ignored his pleas.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! His voice slowly faded as he ended up being blasted into pieces.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch, on the other hand, was more courageous compared to Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
He raised the sword in his hand with a face full of determination. It was evident that he wanted to fight until his last breath.
<br><br>
"Life and Death Holy Way!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! "Life and Death Holy Way!" he shouted more ferociously.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The Life and Death Holy Way surrounded him at his command.
<br><br>
Every time an Evil God approached him, the Evil God would be trapped in the Life and Death Holy Way and die on the spot.
<br><br>
Hundreds of Evil Gods started to walk on the Life and Death Holy Way a few seconds later. Even before they realized, all of them had already stopped breathing.
<br><br>
The Evil God could, in fact, terminate Yellow Thearch more efficiently.
<br><br>
However, he preferred to torture him.
<br><br>
"Hey, aren't you Zen's enemy?" an Evil God asked casually as he floated beside Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
"That's none of your business!" Yellow Thearch roared, "Life and Death Holy Way!"
<br><br>
The Evil God who spoke to him was dragged to the Life and Death Holy Way and walked down it silently.
<br><br>
After he got rid of one, another Evil God appeared.
<br><br>
"He created me. I ought to be grateful to him," the Evil God said.
<br><br>
"You? A grateful person? Who are you kidding?" Yellow Thearch stared at the Evil God scornfully and dragged him to the Life and Death Holy Way as well.
<br><br>
'If the Evil God was really grateful, he wouldn't have joined the Black Ship, ' Yellow Thearch thought as he dismissed the Evil God's words.
<br><br>
"If I take you down, then Zen wouldn't have a chance to get even with you. He might be disappointed," another Evil God said.
<br><br>
"Are you willing to let me go?" Yellow Thearch asked lifting his head.
<br><br>
"No," the Evil God replied as he flashed an evil grin. "I will be happy to see him disappointed."
<br><br>
"Quit playing me and shut up!" Yellow Thearch said furiously. He stuck another Evil God in the holy way again.
<br><br>
The Life and Death Holy Way was indeed powerful. No one could survive and make it out alive.
<br><br>
Although it was a brilliant bloodline theurgy, one needed to use the bloodline power to make it work. Once the bloodline power ran out, any theurgy couldn't be unleashed anymore.
<br><br>
One by one, the Evil Gods stepped into the holy way and gradually died.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Yellow Thearch's bloodline power was quickly decreasing.
<br><br>
His face turned pale as Yellow Thearch was running out of the bloodline power. His handsome face started to wrinkle and he had aged in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
He couldn't hold on any longer and it hit him–he was already dying. He suddenly recited the Truth of Godly Way and went to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch had married a woman from the Pure race on the Other Shore. Male members of this race looked like monsters while its female members resembled ordinary human women who gave off an unworldly aura.
<br><br>
When he was depressed back then, he spent most of his time keeping this woman company on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch knew that he was about to die, so he seized one last moment to enter the Other Shore to say goodbye to her.
<br><br>
When he saw the woman, she almost ran to come and greet him. Her eyes glowed ecstatically the second she met him.
<br><br>
As a creature on the Other Shore, she couldn't go to the Source World to be with Yellow Thearch. She could only patiently wait for his return.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry, honey..." Yellow Thearch said.
<br><br>
The woman frowned as she asked curiously, "What happened? Are you alright?"
<br><br>
"I..."
<br><br>
Before he could finish his sentence, his body in the Source World had been shattered by the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
He vanished in front of the woman as soon as his entire flesh was destroyed.
<br><br>
Chapter 4128 The Next Goal Blood oozed out of Othniel's heavily wounded body, which lay on the vast plain.
<br><br>
At that moment, the mountains collapsed, and the ground cracked. The land caved in as several cities and villages around his body crumbled.
<br><br>
The remaining survivors looked at his large body in horror. They did not know what happened and thought that the end of the world had come.
<br><br>
The faces of the Evil Gods who stood on Othniel's body began to blur and shrink back to their original forms. Their minds, which the Evil God had occupied, also returned to their original states.
<br><br>
They did not die; they didn't know what happened. When they regained their senses, they just stared blankly at the body beneath them.
<br><br>
"What kind of monster is this?"
<br><br>
"It's so big!"
<br><br>
"It's a Chaos Ancient God!"
<br><br>
There were many knowledgeable men among the crowd.
<br><br>
They recognized that the injured corpse belonged to the Chaos Ancient God, Othniel.
<br><br>
Then, did that mean that the Chaos Ancient Gods would also be killed? Had the world gone mad? The matter confused them, but it did not last long. They quickly realized something and exchanged greedy glances.
<br><br>
It was the corpse of a Chaos Ancient God! Both his flesh and bones were rare treasures! They immediately cut and scraped the body with their bare hands; some of them even fought for it. They were like a group of ants that swarmed a beast's corpse.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the black ship still floated in the air, and an Evil God climbed onto the deck.
<br><br>
He wore a black armor, which was the uniform of the guards in the Moon Shield City.
<br><br>
When Shera sensed his presence, she became alert and cautiously asked, "Are you... the Evil God?"
<br><br>
"Yes," the Evil God said with a cold smile.
<br><br>
Of course he knew what Shera wanted to ask.
<br><br>
The Evil God's body already perished. Based on Shera's reaction, the person in front of her was no longer the original Evil God.
<br><br>
"But you don't... This body is..." Shera said hesitantly.
<br><br>
"From the Source World's perspective, even you are me, and so is the former captain of the Black Ship," the Evil God said and pointed at the two of them. Lastly, he looked at Edna. "But she is not me," he continued.
<br><br>
He represented the Source World.
<br><br>
Therefore, everything that was born in the Source World belonged to him.
<br><br>
However, Edna was not born in the Source World. She came from Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
"You are my husband. No one can replace you!" Edna cried as she went up to the Evil God and clutched his arm.
<br><br>
She already knew that the Evil God had changed his body, but she would always be with him no matter what her husband became. Besides, he still looked the same as before.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute. You mean that all the creatures in the Source World can turn into you?" Shera asked.
<br><br>
She knew that the former captain wanted to ask these questions, but the Evil God had always been quite rude to him. After all, the Evil God was cautious around the Grandmaster of Heaven, who supported the captain.
<br><br>
Thus, she had to communicate with the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Yes. The creatures born in and live in the Source World can do that," the Evil God answered.
<br><br>
"No limit to the number?" Shera asked again.
<br><br>
Shera and the captain had been utterly shocked by the excessive number of Evil Gods.
<br><br>
The Evil God's physical body did not reach the Eternal Realm. However, because of the Ways-blending Energy, he was more powerful than most of the Holy Soul Realm warriors and almost as strong as the Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, over ten thousand top-level Holy Soul Realm warriors already formed a really terrifying force.
<br><br>
If he turned all the creatures in the Source World into himself, it would be even more unbelievable.
<br><br>
"Theoretically, that is the case, but I can't do it now," the Evil God said with a shrug.
<br><br>
That was because over ten thousand people being transformed into him was his limit.
<br><br>
The Source World's power was not unlimited. The Evil God could only use a part of it, and it took time to recover if he used it up all at once.
<br><br>
If he drew more than what was allowed, he and the Source World would suffer considerably.
<br><br>
"Well, if that is the case, what will you do next?" Shera asked.
<br><br>
The Evil God suddenly became excited and said, "Of course, I will kill Zen."
<br><br>
Zen was the opponent who he could never defeat, and who had controlled his fate several times before.
<br><br>
He never felt grateful to Zen for letting him off on multiple occasions.
<br><br>
Lastly, Zen's sympathy was his biggest humiliation. Now, he had a chance to wash it all away.
<br><br>
"But I still have to wait. The power used to kill the Chaos Ancient God needs to be restored, and I still have not completely comprehended the Ways-blending Energy," he added.
<br><br>
"I just want to get one thing straight. Why do you put so much importance to Zen?" Shera asked in confusion.
<br><br>
Everyone knew that Zen was powerful and had astounding growth progress.
<br><br>
But now, the Evil God had even killed the Chaos Ancient God. With his current strength, it would be easy for him to take down the Pear Hill and kill Zen.
<br><br>
He glanced at Shera and shook his head. "You don't know him," he muttered.
<br><br>
He had lived in Zen's inner world for a very long time, so he knew Zen's capabilities well.
<br><br>
For him, Zen was vastly different from any opponent in this world. Even the Chaos Ancient Gods could not compare to him.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, his wife begged to differ. "Could you please let Zen off? He treated us well," Edna pleaded.
<br><br>
In turn, the Evil God gently stroked her black hair and explained, "Of course I can let him off, but he has to become my vassal. I will make him someone that is powerful and can control many things in the Source World, just as I did in his inner world back then!"
<br><br>
"You know that he would not accept that," Edna said with a bitter smile.
<br><br>
"Then he can only be a part of me," the Evil God deadpanned.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore The Eye Spirit's eyeball was filled with indescribable rage.
<br><br>
He saw everything that had happened through the eyeballs on the foreheads of Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
A mistake...
<br><br>
He had made the biggest mistake...
<br><br>
He never imagined that the Evil God had controlled the Source World to such an extent in only a short time! Back then, Usman followed the Black Ship for a long time after he was born. However, his power couldn't compare to the Evil God's.
<br><br>
Although the Godly Way energy was gone, it was not a big deal, as the Element Spirit Civilization was not held responsible. But now, even the Source World had fallen into the Evil God's hands.
<br><br>
"Eye Spirit, why didn't you tell me to take action again?" asked Claire.
<br><br>
"Even I can't kill him myself, let alone you," said the Eye Spirit. "Why did such a unique power fall into his hands? The Grandmaster of Heaven is so lucky," he lamented.
<br><br>
"I think the Evil God was born rebellious, and even the Grandmaster of Heaven can't control him. Furthermore, he and the Pear Hill will fight.
<br><br>
Since he killed Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer, he will surely invade the Pear Hill!" Claire exclaimed.
<br><br>
"I hope so. Claire, You can leave now, I'll report this to the Snake Master,"
<br><br>
the Eye Spirit sighed.
<br><br>
Claire glanced helplessly at the Eye Spirit. Since such a thing had happened, the Snake Master would probably punish her leader again.
<br><br>
After she left, a golden rune appeared in the Eye Spirit's eyeball and immediately turned into three cross-shaped stars. The stars gathered together, and then Sewell's coordinates were complete.
<br><br>
Then, a small white snake came out from the coordinates.
<br><br>
"Master Sewell," said the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Sewell twirled around, and faced him. "Why did you summon me?" he asked.
<br><br>
In return, the Eye Spirit briefly explained what had happened to the Evil God.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Sewell was utterly shocked and speechless.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had always executed the Snake Masters' control of the chaos for a long time. Their arrangement had been stable and rarely went out of control.
<br><br>
When the Eye Spirit had reported that the Evil God had devoured Usman last time, Sewell did not take it seriously.
<br><br>
An outsider could only use a small amount of power in the primitive land at most. They could not control the primitive land entirely, and such a thing had never happened before.
<br><br>
However, the tables had turned over now. Everything related to what had happened exceeded Sewell's expectations.
<br><br>
Chapter 4129 The Black Phoenix Candle A stream of blood-like substance flowed down from the top of the Pear Hill just like a bloody waterfall.
<br><br>
If one observed carefully, they would see that this "bloody waterfall" was actually a stream of pure energy.
<br><br>
It flowed halfway down the mountain, thus dying the entire upper half of the mountain red.
<br><br>
This was naturally a shocking sight for both the leaders and the disciples of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"If I'm not mistaken, this is the bloodline theurgy of the Snake Goddess."
<br><br>
"It's very similar to the aura the shadow of Snake Goddess has."
<br><br>
"But this is purer and stronger than that."
<br><br>
After the Snake Goddess reached the Eternal Realm, her strength could be said to have reached its peak.
<br><br>
In the past few years, she had changed her Other Shore Tokens to better ones, but her strength never really made any progress.
<br><br>
Because of that, the power her shadow currently showed naturally amazed everyone. It was obvious to them that she had gained a lot on the Other Shore this time.
<br><br>
Splash! The bloody waterfall suddenly converged, forming a huge shadow of Snake Goddess that floated above the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A split second later, the Snake Goddess on the jadeite platform had soared to the sky.
<br><br>
When she hovered in the air, the strong air current blew her hair upright.
<br><br>
Her gaze was extremely solemn.
<br><br>
Upon mastering the Blood-controlling Method, the Snake Goddess had been itching to give it a try.
<br><br>
Therefore, despite this being her first day returning to the Pear Hill, she already went all out in using her bloodline theurgy.
<br><br>
"Kendrick, are you ready?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
Buzz! A formidable force surged out of the inside of the Pear Hill. This force was the power of truth.
<br><br>
The moment the power of truth gushed out of the Pear Hill, a layer of cyan-colored shell suddenly enveloped the entire mountain.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was about the size of a large province. One could only imagine the size of this shell.
<br><br>
"You can begin." Kendrick's voice came from inside the mountain.
<br><br>
Kendrick didn't participate in the battle of the Pear Hill before because the battle was already over when he arrived.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, after he went into the mountain, he still deployed his strongest defense moves to protect the mountain.
<br><br>
Since the Snake Goddess wanted to test her strength, they decided to let her strength go against Kendrick's shell and see how it went.
<br><br>
"Be careful!" the Snake Goddess shouted. Her eyes were burning with excitement.
<br><br>
Splash! The huge shadow began to transform.
<br><br>
Countless crimson energy particles solidified into one, forming something that looked like a huge rose floating in the sky.
<br><br>
Hiss! The energy particles suddenly converged at the root of the rose.
<br><br>
Immediately afterward, the huge rose crashed downward following the Snake Goddess's violent hand gesture.
<br><br>
"It's so scary!"
<br><br>
"So powerful!"
<br><br>
"Will the Snake Goddess destroy the Pear Hill?"
<br><br>
As the creatures in the Pear Hill saw this scene, worry and fear crept into their gazes.
<br><br>
"Don't be afraid. The enchanted barrier above us is formed by the power of truth. No matter how powerful the Snake Goddess is, she won't necessarily be able to defeat the Chaos Ancient God."
<br><br>
Buzz! The rose formed by the shadow of Snake Goddess pierced the shell but couldn't get through.
<br><br>
However, energy particles continued to gather at the point where the rose pierced the shell. Along with the movement of the energy particles, the rose continued to drill madly into the turtle shell.
<br><br>
A sharp, shrill noise echoed in the sky. It made some flying birds erratic as if they were drunk.
<br><br>
The people of the Pear Hill were protected by the shell, so they weren't hurt by the noise, though it still made many people uncomfortable.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, your power can't penetrate through my shell," Kendrick remarked.
<br><br>
The air current became even fiercer, and the Snake Goddess's long hair also fluttered even more wildly.
<br><br>
Energy beams shot up to the sky and converged at high speed.
<br><br>
She was pushing the power of her bloodline to the limit.
<br><br>
Her shadow, which was originally crimson, had now turned deep purple.
<br><br>
A destructive aura was constantly released from her shadow.
<br><br>
According to the information in the Blood-controlling Method, the shadow of Snake Goddess itself had tremendous destructive power, and pushing it to the limit would trigger the Black Phoenix Candle.
<br><br>
"Let me look! I want to feel the power of the Black Phoenix Candle! Show it to me!"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess roared.
<br><br>
Every inch of her muscles was taut, and her slender body was brimming with power.
<br><br>
After the last trace of purple color in her shadow faded, her shadow suddenly shattered and materialized again into a black flame.
<br><br>
It seemed to contain an immeasurable destructive aura.
<br><br>
"This is the Black Phoenix Candle!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! A black phoenix flew down from behind the Snake Goddess and drilled into the shell.
<br><br>
Cracks appeared on the surface of the originally hard shell.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The enchanted barrier that Kendrick created was one whole entity.
<br><br>
If one part couldn't be broken, the whole enchanted barrier wouldn't be broken.
<br><br>
If one part was broken, the whole enchanted barrier would also be broken.
<br><br>
The cracks spread all over at an incredible speed. Before long, the shell shattered with a loud bang.
<br><br>
The moment the cyan-colored turtle shell broke, dragon scales appeared and covered the Pear Hill. This was the second enchanted barrier.
<br><br>
Kendrick had set up three layers of defense on the Pear Hill. After the turtle shell, which was his outermost layer of defense, was broken, the second layer of defense would replace it. This layer of defense was known as the Dragon Scale Defense.
<br><br>
"Good job. You've done very well by breaking my turtle shell. However, you should stop now—you can't break the Dragon Scale Defense," said Kendrick.
<br><br>
They were just sparring with each other, and he didn't want to consume too much power of truth.
<br><br>
But the Snake Goddess didn't reply. It was as if she didn't hear what he said. She just continued to force the Black Phoenix Candle to drill through the defense.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The Dragon Scale Defense was much stronger than the turtle shell.
<br><br>
But under the erosion of the Black Phoenix Candle, there was a faint sign of breaking.
<br><br>
The increasing energy of the Black Phoenix Candle made Kendrick a little flustered. "That's enough, Snake Goddess. This is just a spar!"
<br><br>
But the Snake Goddess seemed to have not heard of what he said.
<br><br>
Her eyes became dark as if she was out of control.
<br><br>
Crack! The Dragon Scale Defense was broken.
<br><br>
The third enchanted barrier quickly appeared over the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
It was a layer of ancient grey shell—Kendrick's shell.
<br><br>
"Stop! Stop the Snake Goddess! Anyone! If this goes on, both of us will only suffer!"
<br><br>
Kendrick surely had the means to counterattack the Snake Goddess. His shell could bounce back most of the Black Phoenix Candle's power.
<br><br>
But if he did so, the Snake Goddess would most likely be killed in an instant, and he naturally didn't want to see that.
<br><br>
At this moment, a figure quietly appeared beside the Snake Goddess. It was Fuxi.
<br><br>
Splash! The Snake Goddess didn't even turn to look at Fuxi. She just waved her hand, sending the turbulent black flame towards him.
<br><br>
The expression on Fuxi's face didn't change much. He opened and closed his arms, forming an invisible Eight Diagrams circle on his palms.
<br><br>
Splash! A strange scene appeared in front of everyone. The destructive flame revolved along the Eight Diagrams circle in Fuxi's hands like an obedient child.
<br><br>
It was obviously unwilling to be imprisoned inside the Eight Diagrams circle, but it couldn't break out of the cycle no matter how hard it tried.
<br><br>
When Fuxi put his hand on the Snake Goddess's shoulder, she trembled slightly and came to her senses. A second later, however, she fainted into Fuxi's arms as she had exhausted all her power.
<br><br>
Fuxi calmly took her back to the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, King Ieuan, and Yasamin looked at the Snake Goddess with dread.
<br><br>
That the Blood-controlling Method could greatly improve the strength of cultivators at the Eternal Realm was already known by them, but they never expected that the Snake Goddess would make such progress that she could fight against the Chaos Ancient God head-on.
<br><br>
Chapter 4130 Bad News It took a long time for the Snake Goddess to recover. She slowly opened her eyes as she lay weakly in Fuxi's arms.
<br><br>
"Are you feeling better?" asked Fuxi.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded and gently freed herself from his arms.
<br><br>
She realized that she had almost been completely lost. Her consciousness was controlled by that destructive force.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, was that the limit of your strength?" A turtle about ten feet long was crawling on the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
On his right side was a sloth, and on his left was a scorpion.
<br><br>
Gerald, Judson, and Kendrick had been hiding inside the Pear Hill. To conveniently communicate with the others, they each created an avatar.
<br><br>
"Well..." The Snake Goddess paused as she thought for a while. She shook her head and denied, "No."
<br><br>
Just now, she felt her power almost becoming limitless. It was because of this infinite destructive power that she was lost. The power seemed to give her everything.
<br><br>
Kendrick smiled bitterly. "It appears that I can't block your black flame."
<br><br>
"You are strong indeed, but this power can make you lose your mind.
<br><br>
You'd better not use it," Fuxi suggested worriedly.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi said, "Maybe it's because we don't know much about the bloodline power. After we master the Blood-controlling Method, it will take us some time to adapt."
<br><br>
After he, Yasamin, and King Ieuan mastered the Blood-controlling Method, their strength also increased greatly. It might be incomparable to the Snake Goddess's or Fuxi's level, but they were almost the same.
<br><br>
In the Dark Haze Peak, Zen, Yan, and the others saw what happened in the sky.
<br><br>
"The strength of the Snake Goddess is frightening!" Lavender couldn't hide the surprise from her eyes.
<br><br>
Yan smiled. "The strength of the Snake Goddess has improved so much.
<br><br>
Zen, you should make more progress, too!"
<br><br>
"My situation is a little special. I haven't made much progress," Zen said as he looked to the ground.
<br><br>
The Blood-controlling Method he cultivated was the most basic one. It could help him improve his strength, but the improvement wouldn't be as great as those of other Eternal Realm cultivators. After all, he didn't really control the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
While he was lost in thought, a girl walked to him. She had hair put up in pigtails, a small round face, and a pair of eyes as pure as big black gemstones. She faintly resembled Margaret.
<br><br>
"Father, I want a hug!" The girl requested while stretching out her arms to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen held the girl in his arms and lifted her above his head. She giggled.
<br><br>
The girl was Salome, he and Margaret's daughter. She had been in the fairy palace after being born in his inner world.
<br><br>
After Zen had returned from the Other Shore, he enjoyed some rare leisure days and invited all the women out of the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Although Salome was less than two years old, she was intelligent enough to read over a thousand words under the guidance of her mother and the others. Now she could read some simple Sanskrit words on her own.
<br><br>
She had the ability similar to Geoffrey's, but she was much more obedient than him.
<br><br>
This was only the second time Salome had seen Zen, but the two of them didn't feel estranged from each other.
<br><br>
After playing with Salome for a while, Zen handed her to Margaret. Only then did he catch Letitia's glance and notice her. She stood not far away with eyes filled with sadness.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had been in the Deleting Space for a long time, but there had been no news about him yet.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen tried to communicate with Ziya through the Descending Ring and failed.
<br><br>
Letitia grew more worried with each passing day that Geoffrey's condition remained unknown.
<br><br>
Zen walked towards her and placed his hand on her shoulder. Letitia looked up as she smiled tearfully. Zen held her in his arms, comforting her.
<br><br>
He couldn't go to the Deleting Space and he couldn't do anything to help.
<br><br>
He felt helpless as he could only place his hope on Ziya.
<br><br>
A few days later, shocking news started to spread throughout the Source World and the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Chaos Ancient God Othniel died.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch died.
<br><br>
And the Divine Farmer also died! With the support of the Element Spirit Civilization, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were undoubtedly the strongest super forces in the Source World.
<br><br>
The news that the leaders of these two super forces and a Chaos Ancient God had died was no less shocking than the battle of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Since the Moon Shield City had not suffered a devastating blow, many people witnessed the battle. The scene that the Evil God fought against three masters alone had also spread.
<br><br>
When the news reached the Pear Hill, it immediately attracted attention, causing great discussion among the people.
<br><br>
All the important figures of the Pear Hill arrived and assembled on the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
The death of the Yellow Thearch was good news, yet a heavy atmosphere surrounded them.
<br><br>
The Evil God had killed not only the Chaos Ancient God Othniel but also the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer. It was too amazing that he had done this all alone.
<br><br>
The three Chaos Ancient Gods guarded the Pear Hill mainly to defend against the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race. Now the leaders of the two super forces had been killed, but they were facing an even more terrifying enemy.
<br><br>
"The Evil God can produce many avatars, and each of them has his strength.
<br><br>
His power of the Ways-blending Energy is astonishing.
<br><br>
Most importantly, the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer were also very powerful. They must have obtained the Blood-controlling Methods from the Element Spirit Civilization. The Yellow Thearch had actually killed hundreds of the Evil God's avatars." After Fuxi initiated the conversation, he threw the green crystal in his hand to Zen.
<br><br>
The green stone was known as the Memory-recording Crystal. As its name suggested, it was a kind of crystal that recorded memories in the Source World.
<br><br>
The owner of the Memory-recording Crystal hid in a corner of the Moon Shield City. He watched the battle from an excellent angle, wide enough to observe everything that took place.
<br><br>
His Memory-recording Crystal became known and was sold at a very high price. The Ear Mouse race afforded to buy it and sent it to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Zen caught the Memory-recording Crystal and put it on his forehead.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, it was as if he had been present in the Moon Shield City. He witnessed how over ten thousand avatars of the Evil God killed Othniel.
<br><br>
After that, Zen carefully threw the Memory-recording Crystal to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who later passed it to Yasamin after his reading.
<br><br>
Everyone fell into a deafening silence after they had read the Memoryrecording Crystal.
<br><br>
With their insight, they had a collective intuition of the strength of the Evil God. It was intimidating indeed! "Those who have something to do with you are all monsters, Zen," said Fuxi.
<br><br>
Aside from Zen, his children also had special talents. Even the Evil God who popped out of his inner world could grow to such a terrifying level.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess interrupted, "But one thing is very strange about this."
<br><br>
"What is it?" asked Fuxi.
<br><br>
"The Evil God will definitely target the Pear Hill and Zen next," the Snake Goddess concluded. "However, if he wants to attack us, he shouldn't have left so many survivors in the Moon Shield City. His ability could kill all its people and even those in the Blood Sea Province. Why would he let these people live and spread the news?"
<br><br>
If the Evil God sneaked into the Pear Hill and used his exceptional power, the Pear Hill would be left defenseless and completely defeated.
<br><br>
Everyone looked at Zen after hearing the Snake Goddess's analysis. He was the one who knew the Evil God best.
<br><br>
Zen answered instantly, "Because he's certain of himself."
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Evil God, this was a sure win. No matter how hard Zen resisted, he would never be able to escape.
<br><br>
Chapter 4131 Unexpected "He's certain of himself... You're absolutely right!" Fuxi nodded. "He wasn't afraid that we would know about his deeds and be alert given his arrogant character."
<br><br>
The very first time Fuxi laid eyes on the Evil God, he already hated the guy.
<br><br>
It was at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World where they first met and Fuxi wanted so much to kill him but couldn't due to the overall situation.
<br><br>
Zen nodded with a smile. "That's right. This is not something he needs to think about."
<br><br>
"How should we counterattack?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi had a worried look on his face.
<br><br>
It was not easy for him to return from the Other Shore and he did not want to hide in the Pear Hill all his life.
<br><br>
A few days ago, Eastern Emperor Taiyi gathered Pearce, Auden and a few other important officials to discuss the Oneness Sky Palace's reconstruction.
<br><br>
The disciples were able to return to the Bloom Divine Province with Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin's leadership.
<br><br>
He was extremely happy to have heard the news about Yellow Thearch's and Divine Farmer's death and he felt it even more reasonable for them to return to the Bloom Divine Province now that there was no more threat of powerful enemies.
<br><br>
However, he soon found out that it wasn't good news at all. There was a huge crisis behind it all! "How do we counterattack?"
<br><br>
"This guy's ability is really too strange and remarkable."
<br><br>
"He seems to be able to possess other people's bodies at will."
<br><br>
Everyone saw via the Memory-recording Crystal just how the people of Moon Shield City suddenly turned into the Evil God with no warning at all whatsoever.
<br><br>
If the Evil God entered the Pear Hill and took over the bodies of all Eternal Realm warriors, then the possibility of a counterattack would be null.
<br><br>
"There must be some restrictions to his power," Judson muttered lazily. "If he can possess other people's bodies at will, then he could've turned Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer into him, but why didn't he?"
<br><br>
"You're right." The Snake Goddess nodded. "Master Gerald, have you ever heard of such a method?"
<br><br>
Gerald was lost in thought after watching the Memory-recording Crystal.
<br><br>
He was more shocked than anyone else after having observed the Evil God's methods.
<br><br>
A green light soon flashed in Gerald's eyes. "Life controlling."
<br><br>
Suddenly, a burst of power spread out from his body.
<br><br>
Several peacocks with blue tail feathers walked arrogantly under the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
However, when Gerald released his power of truth, one of the peacocks trembled and its eyes turned dark green. The next moment, it jumped up and stood in the center of the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Once it landed, it suddenly morphed into a burly, human man.
<br><br>
The aura he emitted was by no means small and he was as powerful as a Holy Soul Realm warrior.
<br><br>
Gerald said, "I can do this. I can directly control creatures and infuse my own strength into them. For those at the Holy Soul Realm, I can control forty to fifty at most...
<br><br>
The Evil God can control over ten thousand people with cultivation and strength no different from his own. That's not something within my range of expertise.
<br><br>
If I'm not mistaken, he is able to do that by using the power of the Source World. Although it's not as pure as the power of truth, it is terrifyingly strong and he can use it at will.
<br><br>
Due to these circumstances, I have a suggestion."
<br><br>
"Go ahead," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
"We leave the Source World," Gerald replied.
<br><br>
Since the Evil God now controlled the Source World, it was obviously not a wise choice to attack him in his domain.
<br><br>
"Leave?"
<br><br>
"Do you mean to say that we have to escape from the Source World?"
<br><br>
"Is it appropriate?"
<br><br>
His suggestion greatly shocked everyone.
<br><br>
There was no way the Snake Goddess was willing to leave the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin shared her thoughts and were also unwilling to give up the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
King Ieuan shared the same sentiments. The Ear Mice were the original inhabitants of the Source World. If they left, they would lose everything.
<br><br>
However, Zen and Fuxi were very taken with this suggestion.
<br><br>
Fuxi did not like staying in the Pear Hill and preferred to travel the world.
<br><br>
Zen, meanwhile, was not a native of the Source World. If he left, he could return to the divine land. "If we can't think of a way to counterattack, we can choose to temporarily avoid the danger."
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess shook her head. "The Pear Hill is the foundation of our race. We can't give it up so easily."
<br><br>
Gerald nodded in understanding. "Of course. I understand you're not willing to leave but..."
<br><br>
Just as he was about to finish his words, his expression suddenly changed.
<br><br>
The previously green eyes of the man who was transformed from the peacock soon turned into two, black flowers that emanated a strong, evil aura.
<br><br>
Someone was trying to control him! "Fuck off!" Gerald shouted.
<br><br>
His anger effectively drove the unknown invader as a ray of dark green light filled the man's eyes again and expelled the darkness.
<br><br>
However, traces of black light remained within the edges of his pupils that continued to replace Gerald's dark green light.
<br><br>
It was a battle of control and Gerald was not backing down.
<br><br>
A strong amount of life energy gushed out of his body and onto the man.
<br><br>
The green soon won over the dark and tiny vines grew out from his eyes.
<br><br>
Two forces currently fought within the man's mind.
<br><br>
It was the kind of power that could be considered the strongest in the chaos. The man was only a temporary form for the peacock, so how could his physical body withstand such opposing forces? It was understandable for the man to scream in pain.
<br><br>
"Ahhh!"
<br><br>
As he screamed, his body swelled up.
<br><br>
With the sudden turn of events, Kendrick quickly pointed his finger and summoned hexagonal enchanted barriers to surround the burly man.
<br><br>
Bang! There was a muffled sound as the man's body exploded and turned into a mist of blood that splattered in all directions.
<br><br>
Thanks to Kendrick's enchanted barriers, nobody got splashed by the man's blood.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! At this time, a strong gust of wind began to blow from the top of the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Thousands of dust grains gathered from the force generated by the wind and soon formed a man in the air. This man had the same appearance and build as the Evil God's.
<br><br>
"No wonder you're the Chaos Ancient God in charge of life truth. You can actually take the control away from me," the Evil God said to Gerald.
<br><br>
A pair of compound eyes on Gerald's head glared coldly at the Evil God.
<br><br>
"You are nothing without the Source World's power."
<br><br>
It was true. Without the Source World's power, the Evil God was just a Holy Soul Realm warrior who did not have much to offer at all.
<br><br>
"Without the life truth, you're even worse than a good-for-nothing! Hahaha..." The Evil God, instead of getting mad, laughed.
<br><br>
Gerald hadn't been at a disadvantage when he fought the Evil God for the man transformed from the peacock earlier.
<br><br>
In fact, the Evil God failed several times in trying to gain the upper hand.
<br><br>
So in a fit of rage, he decided to make the man explode.
<br><br>
He was millions of miles away, but had he been in the same vicinity, then Gerald would not have won the fight.
<br><br>
After laughing, the Evil God turned to Zen. "You've let me down even more," he said in a mocking tone. "You planned to run away before seeing me. I didn't think you'd be such a coward."
<br><br>
Chapter 4132 Irreconcilable Zen couldn't care less about the Evil God's ridicule. Instead, he asked, "Are you eavesdropping on us?"
<br><br>
"There is nothing in the Source World that can escape my perception," the Evil God scoffed. "Everything here belongs to me and can be used by me.
<br><br>
Why would I ever need to eavesdrop on you?"
<br><br>
This was an exaggeration, because the Source World was not his inner world. He wasn't all-knowing as he claimed.
<br><br>
However, it was true that no one could surpass his control over the Source World.
<br><br>
The Evil God continued, "If you submit to me, I will make you the ruler of the Source World. All the creatures and super forces of the provinces will submit to you. We can build the Source World together. What do you think?"
<br><br>
As he said this, he waved his hand gently.
<br><br>
Numerous emerald green vines quickly grew around the Pear Hill. Leaves ten feet wide uncurled and revealed strange flowers. The refreshing fragrance of flowers spread everywhere, and soon enough, the whole mountain was an emerald green sea.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess race and the human race that were in the Pear Hill at that time were shocked to see this unfold.
<br><br>
"Whose method is this?"
<br><br>
"With so much greenery covering the mountain, I'm afraid only the Chaos Ancient God who is in charge of the life truth can do it."
<br><br>
"Why did he do that?"
<br><br>
Because the people of the Pear Hill didn't know the existence of the Evil God, they weren't afraid at all.
<br><br>
"I politely refuse," Zen said without hesitation.
<br><br>
He was completely different from the Evil God, which meant there was no way he would cooperate.
<br><br>
The Evil God was not surprised at Zen's answer. With one wave of his hand, the plants swayed towards him as if they were bowing. "There are three hundred and twenty-three million nine hundred and seventy thousand creatures living in this huge mountain. Most of them are weak.
<br><br>
If they absorb even a drop of poisonous fog, they'd be dead. It is quite pitiful to kill all of them at once."
<br><br>
A low plant hidden away among the sea of plants was summoned by the Evil God; it was called the Poisonous Dust Grass. In the center of the grass lay a fist-sized fruit that held the deadliest poison.
<br><br>
Pop! The Evil God pointed his finger at the fruit, and it cracked. Just then, a poisonous bright yellow mist burst out and began to spread.
<br><br>
Whatever the poisonous mist enveloped withered and died. It was obvious that the mist was toxic.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm warriors were not afraid of the poisonous mist. From experience, it had always been difficult for the poisonous mist to kill the Chaotic Source Realm warriors.
<br><br>
However, there were only a few people above the Chaotic Source Realm in the Pear Hill. If the Evil God released all the poisonous mist from the grass, surely ninety-nine percent of the people on the mountain would die.
<br><br>
"Why don't you reconsider my suggestion?" the Evil God threatened Zen with a sneer.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
Gerald chuckled.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, a green light flashed within his eyes and a green magic array hovered over his head, spinning non-stop.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The life energy of the flowers and trees across the mountain quickly faded and were absorbed by Gerald's body.
<br><br>
As Gerald extracted all the life energy of the plants within a second, the Poisonous Dust Grass also withered and died.
<br><br>
He said, "Do not ever threaten us with such a dirty trick!"
<br><br>
Though it was true that the Evil God had killed one Chaos Ancient God, three Chaos Ancient Gods and a group of Eternal Realm warriors still existed in the Pear Hill. It would never be easy to get rid of them all.
<br><br>
Seeing that Gerald destroyed his plants as if they were nothing, the Evil God did not flinch.
<br><br>
Instead, he grinned. "Well then, I can only use the real method."
<br><br>
Once he finished speaking, his body disintegrated and the dust flew away with the wind.
<br><br>
In the Sword Blade Peak, a group of human disciples concentrated on their cultivation.
<br><br>
The youngest disciple was only twelve years old. Despite his young age, he had great talent and made rapid progress within half a year after he'd entered the Sword Blade Peak.
<br><br>
He was already comprehending the Truth of Godly Way with a sword in his arms.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, his face blurred. The next moment, his body transformed into the Evil God and he jumped up from the ground. The sword he held broke in the hands of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"What's going on?"
<br><br>
"Who are you? What are you doing here?"
<br><br>
"Where is our little brother?"
<br><br>
"Did you just take over him?"
<br><br>
The surrounding disciples were left speechless.
<br><br>
Even though many of them were Other Shore Realm warriors, they had never witnessed a theurgy that allowed someone to directly possess a body. The aura emitted by the Evil God was too strong and was most probably at the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
"Do not fear. You are a part of me too." The Evil God smiled.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the disciples' faces blurred in the same way as the twelveyear-old disciple did. Just then, they all turned into the Evil Gods.
<br><br>
In his battle against Othniel, the Evil God better grasped the body possessing theurgy.
<br><br>
It seemed that even if he was physically hundreds of millions of miles away, he could directly possess another being. The person he possessed gave him a body to use, which allowed him to possess the people around him, too.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The next moment, dozens of Evil Gods from the Sword Blade Peak appeared in the air above the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
This didn't happen in only Sword Blade Peak.
<br><br>
The other peaks went through the same thing.
<br><br>
The members of the Snake Goddess race and the human race turned into the Evil Gods and one by one appeared above the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Letitia, Lavender, Margaret and Zen's other women in the Dark Haze Peak had no idea what happened outside. All they saw was the greenery that blossomed all of a sudden, and withered the next moment.
<br><br>
Letitia and Lavender had a bad inkling in their guts. Just then, a few of their servants began to twitch. When they turned around to get a better look, they saw that their faces had changed.
<br><br>
"The Evil God!" Letitia couldn't believe her eyes.
<br><br>
They did not anticipate the Evil God's appearance.
<br><br>
When the newly transformed avatars of the Evil God caught sight of Letitia, Lavender, and the others, sinister smiles plastered across their faces. "Interesting... Zen actually let you out. It's too bad that you aren't from the Source World. I can't possess you."
<br><br>
The Evil God could only control creatures from the Source World.
<br><br>
Because Letitia, Lavender, and the rest were from the divine land, they were completely out of the loop.
<br><br>
As they saw the Evil Gods approach them, Margaret raised her eyebrows.
<br><br>
"What do you want to do?"
<br><br>
Letitia, Lavender and the other women pulled out their weapons and held their fighting stances.
<br><br>
"All I want is for your husband to cooperate with me. It would be best for you to be obedient too," the Evil Gods recited in chorus.
<br><br>
Letitia frowned and considered her options. She looked up and said without fear, "Evil God, Zen has done nothing but treat you well. He even let go of your wife, Edna. It's unreasonable of you to attack us."
<br><br>
Seeing Letitia's determination, the Evil Gods merely snorted at her.
<br><br>
Nothing could ever restrain the Evil God. Otherwise, he wouldn't have returned to Zen time to time.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that what Letitia had said affected him. One of the Evil Gods hesitated for a moment then snapped his fingers. "Retreat!"
<br><br>
The Evil Gods didn't lay a finger on any of them and eventually, disappeared.
<br><br>
Once they were gone, Margaret began to worry about Zen. "The Evil God has so many avatars. I fear Zen's safety."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Letitia ran out of the hall and looked up to the sky. Her jaw dropped.
<br><br>
The sky above the Pear Hill was packed with the Evil Gods that hovered and increased in number.
<br><br>
Chapter 4133 Countermeasures The Eternal Realm warriors on the jadeite platform stood still, frozen in shock. They had just read the Memory-recording Crystal which had just revealed to them how the Evil God used over ten thousand avatars to kill Othniel.
<br><br>
Their expressions were grim. The Evil God once again was proving himself to be an extremely formidable enemy.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi put his hands behind his back, clutching a golden sword pointing at the sky. An overwhelming sword intent emanated from his body, spreading outwards infinitely.
<br><br>
Yasamin held the long sword horizontally. She frowned deeply, her wrinkles accentuating her tiredness more than usual. Despite her old age, enemies would've quaked in fear at the incredible power she exuded.
<br><br>
Any one at the Eternal Realm who had mastered the Blood-controlling Method could dominate the Source World.
<br><br>
However, the number of Evil Gods kept on increasing. They almost completely covered the sky.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was at a loss. Tears filled her eyes as she helplessly watched her disciples turn into Evil Gods.
<br><br>
Although they were being possessed by the Evil God, these people were still her disciples.
<br><br>
With every addition of an Evil God, the Pear Hill lost a disciple.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess didn't have the heart to kill her own people.
<br><br>
"Can you stop the Evil God?" the Snake Goddess pleaded to the three Chaos Ancient Gods through life vitality.
<br><br>
Judson shook his head. "He directly possesses the creatures in the Source World. We can't stop him."
<br><br>
"I have an idea," piped up Gerald. "But I can only save dozens of people at most."
<br><br>
He was thinking he could stop the Evil God's body possession with the truth of life, but ultimately, it would've been futile since the number of Evil Gods was increasing rapidly.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Two streams of energy, one black, one white, flowed forth from beneath Fuxi's feet, converging to form an illusory Eight Diagrams seal.
<br><br>
"Spare no mercy," Fuxi said gravely. "They're our enemies now. There's nothing we can do about that."
<br><br>
Swoosh! The Eight Diagrams seal formed an invisible force that started to revolve around Fuxi.
<br><br>
In the past, Fuxi focused only on improving his own strength. Exerting his bloodline power to the extreme, he sought the fastest and strongest methods to destroy.
<br><br>
After cultivating the Blood-controlling Method, he had gained a new understanding of his bloodline.
<br><br>
"Stupid," the Snake Goddess snapped. "It's not a matter of whether they are enemies or not. We have no chance of winning!" The Snake Goddess shot an angry look at Fuxi.
<br><br>
"Right. It's useless to kill them. No matter how many people we kill, the Evil God can always possess more," Gerald agreed.
<br><br>
This was simply an unfair battle.
<br><br>
The Evil God was invincible, so it was useless to exert too much effort just trying to put a dent on him.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the sky for a while and pondered. "If we don't have any chance of winning, why don't we focus our efforts on escaping from the Source World?"
<br><br>
The Evil God could possess the creatures in the Source World. However, his power couldn't reach outside of the Source World.
<br><br>
"Escape?" Gerald analyzed, "Othniel was the best at that, yet even he was unable to escape. It won't be easy for us to get out of here."
<br><br>
Gerald had been studying the Memory-recording Crystal, which was how he came up with the idea of escaping the Source World. Indeed, it seemed like the only reasonable thing they could do in this situation.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God was monitoring Zen's every movement, so chances of escaping were extremely slim, if not impossible.
<br><br>
"This is the only way," Zen said to the crowd telepathically. "We have to give it a try. Let's separate the Pear Hill from the Source World."
<br><br>
Everyone's expression changed slightly as they pondered over this idea.
<br><br>
This was probably the only way to save the Pear Hill from total annihilation.
<br><br>
"While this might be a reasonable suggestion, the Evil God won't be so stupid as to do nothing!" Fuxi countered.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, ask the Primeval Lord of Heaven to descend with the Descending Ring to help us when necessary," Zen said. Then, turning to look at the sky, he said, "I'll pin down the Evil God first."
<br><br>
Before returning to the Pear Hill, Zen had given two Descending Rings to the Primeval Lord of Heaven just in case. He never expected he'd need to use them so soon.
<br><br>
After saying that, Zen quickly left the jadeite platform and flew into the sky.
<br><br>
Even then, the number of Evil Gods was still increasing, one after another.
<br><br>
It had already surpassed ten thousand, but he showed no signs of stopping.
<br><br>
He was not in a hurry.
<br><br>
As long as he was in the Source World, he was invincible.
<br><br>
The Chaos Ancient Gods, the Eternal Realm warriors and Zen were all no match for him.
<br><br>
He waited patiently for them to make the first move. 'It'd be more interesting that way, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen's approach, he said aloud, "The Eternal Realm warriors have mastered the Blood-controlling Method. That must mean you have, too, right?"
<br><br>
Over ten thousand Evil Gods stared at Zen in unison. Their gazes were oppressive, making him feel stressed.
<br><br>
However, only the one in the lead spoke.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Zen.
<br><br>
The eyes of the Evil God lit up. "Then, show me your strength!"
<br><br>
"You can have a taste!" Zen said, smiling suddenly.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, the Evil God gently spread out his palm, and a nearly perfect Ways-blending Energy was formed.
<br><br>
Zen cautiously stared at the Ways-blending Energy, vigilantly taking in his surroundings.
<br><br>
Since he wanted to pin down the Evil God, he needed to provoke him some more.
<br><br>
"Is this the complete Godly Ways Great Unity?" Zen asked, pretending to be curious.
<br><br>
"Yes, it's the complete Ways-blending Energy. I haven't been able to comprehend the truth power yet. If you are willing to follow me, I can teach you," said the Evil God calmly.
<br><br>
"I'm not interested." Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
"You will be interested soon!"
<br><br>
The Evil God's arm shook slightly, and the Ways-blending Energy formed a long sword. Then, he swung his body, and the blade slashed towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
With the strength at the peak of the Holy Soul Realm and the power of the Ways-blending Energy, the Evil God was more powerful than many Eternal Realm masters.
<br><br>
As the Evil God swung towards Zen, he gently opened his palm to reveal a thin thread of blood. The blood thread quickly converged to form a hollowed-out blood sword.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Swish! The sword made of the Ways-blending Energy and another one made of bloodline connected with a deafening noise.
<br><br>
Buzz! For a split second, no one knew what had happened.
<br><br>
Then, in the next moment, the Evil God's body collapsed into countless fragments that dissipated with the wind. Even the sword formed from the Ways-blending Energy disappeared.
<br><br>
The other Evil Gods all showed shocked expressions.
<br><br>
While the Evil God was well aware that he was no match for Zen alone, he had no idea that the disparity in strength was so great.
<br><br>
The blood sword in Zen's hand was too special. The Ways-blending Energy was extinguished the second it connected with the blood sword.
<br><br>
What kind of bloodline power was this? The Evil God had never been to the Eternal Scroll Painting. He didn't know much about the bloodline power, but he could instinctively sense that Zen's bloodline was special.
<br><br>
If he could devour Zen, then he would have his bloodline power.
<br><br>
When this thought crossed his mind, the Evil God grew even more excited.
<br><br>
"You deserve to be my creator! Again!"
<br><br>
This time, two Evil Gods stepped out and attacked Zen left and right.
<br><br>
As Zen kept the Evil God busy, the enchanted barrier underground that Kendrick had set up suddenly started to work.
<br><br>
The Dragon Scale Defense, like a sharp knife, was trying to separate the Pear Hill from the Source World.
<br><br>
Chapter 4134 Confronting Separating an entire province from the Source World was a fairly easy task for a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
Three enchanted barriers had covered the top of the Pear Hill. Now, Kendrick needed to draw the barriers into the underground.
<br><br>
Around three minutes later, an enormous and deep circular trench appeared in an area outside the Source world! If they viewed the Source World as a large rounded fruit, the area where the Pear Hill stood had now been cleanly sliced off by the Dragon Scale Defense.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill could be separated from the rest of the Source World with just a little push from the inside.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, dozens of Evil Gods were still fighting against Zen above the Pear Hill. It seemed as though they were deliberately fighting him at such a leisurely pace.
<br><br>
The Evil God had been thoroughly enjoying this way of fighting. He could probably do this the entire day without getting tired.
<br><br>
He practically had an infinite amount of power. The power was like a noose that was gradually tightening around Zen's neck.
<br><br>
This was the only way he could force Zen into exhausting every bit of his power. Then, he would make Zen surrender miserably to him! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Dozens of Evil Gods charged wildly towards Zen like a pack of hungry wolves. Each of them was carrying Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen stood his ground and remained oddly calm.
<br><br>
He was well aware of the plan. Kendrick was trying to detach the Pear Hill from the rest of the Source World.
<br><br>
This meant that the longer he could hold off the Evil God, the more advantageous it would be for the Pear Hill. A long delay was what they needed.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He swiftly drew the blood sword and held it tightly in his hand.
<br><br>
The blood sword slashed rapidly in every direction.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the blood sword underwent an esoteric transformation. It released several blood lines that pierced through the Evil Gods. After that, they formed an intricate yet chaotic pattern all throughout their bodies.
<br><br>
As Zen made a pulling motion, the sharp patterns quickly streaked past the Evil Gods and chopped them to pieces.
<br><br>
The scene looked absolutely gruesome as blood gushed out and splashed everywhere.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess was trembling. Her heart ached terribly as she watched this grisly scene unfold.
<br><br>
As the head of the Pear Hill, the Snake Goddess obviously had the inherent disposition of a true leader. She had always been courageous and resolute.
<br><br>
She knew that there would always be sacrifices in any battle. However, it was extremely painful for her to watch as their members ended up as the sacrifice.
<br><br>
The Evil God possessed the bodies of the people nearby. The Evil Gods battling with Zen were actually the elites of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
They had no knowledge of what happened and what they were doing. It meant that Zen had to kill them not because of their own actions, but of the Evil God's. The Snake Goddess couldn't express her pain and regret in mere words.
<br><br>
Out of the blue, they heard someone shout. "I have done it! I have finished cutting the Pear Hill!"
<br><br>
It was Kendrick's voice that everyone heard in the midst of the battle.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the two Chaos Ancient Gods slightly froze in surprise. It was done! Now that the first step had been completed, the next step would be to push the Pear Hill out! When Zen heard Kendrick's voice, his expression did not change even the slightest. He remained focused on the Evil Gods' attacks.
<br><br>
"Incredible! Well, let's see if you can block my next attack. How about a hundred people?" the Evil God exclaimed with such excitement and anticipation.
<br><br>
All at once, over one hundred Evil Gods charged towards Zen.
<br><br>
There were a hundred and one Evil Gods rapidly converging on him! One of them swooped directly in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Puff! Zen instinctively drew his blood sword and stabbed the Evil God straight in the chest. "This method of attack is futile," he remarked coldly.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God smiled at Zen derisively before he could cut him into pieces. "I want you to know that it's useless to move the Pear Hill out of the Source World."
<br><br>
When he heard this, Zen looked at him darkly. He gently pulled the blood sword in his hand and instantly dismembered that Evil God. Afterwards, he bellowed, "Everyone! Move!" As soon as they heard him, they immediately took action.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! They heard loud booming sounds that came from inside the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the other Eternal Realm warriors moved away from the jadeite platform. Subsequently, they each appeared at the top, on the mountainside, and some other places of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Each of these places had a dome-shaped enchanted barrier. These were the areas that had been marked by Kendrick beforehand. They were supposed to apply force in these designated points.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm warriors considered the Pear Hill fragile. But by targeting these areas, their powers would be evenly distributed. It would help them hit the huge mountain simultaneously.
<br><br>
As soon as the Eternal Realm warriors appeared on the dome-shaped barriers, they slammed those specific areas with their full strength all at once.
<br><br>
In fact, a Chaos Ancient God would be able to push the Pear Hill out of the Source World. It could even be accomplished by him alone if there was enough time.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, they still had an unpredictable and all-powerful Evil God to deal with. Therefore, the only way they could execute their plan was to do it without warning.
<br><br>
Kendrick had already cut the edge of the Pear Hill using the Dragon Scale Defense. When the combined powers of the Eternal Realm warriors and the Chaos Ancient Gods erupted, there wasn't a single crack on the surface of the Pear Hill. The cut was completely smooth! Swish! Swish! Swish! All of a sudden, they heard a strong rushing sound.
<br><br>
Boundless chaotic energy surged from the cut at the foot of the mountain.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the three enchanted barriers Kendrick had set up earlier covered the entire Pear Hill. These enchanted barriers could completely block flow of the chaotic energy.
<br><br>
However, they noticed a huge problem. The Pear Hill was slowly sinking! "What just happened?" Fuxi yelled amidst the commotion.
<br><br>
"The Pear Hill collapsed!" It was Yasamin who answered.
<br><br>
"I can't believe it! How could such a huge mountain collapse?" King Ieuan mumbled in disbelief.
<br><br>
There were several large cities of the human race and the Snake Goddess race located in the Pear Hill. These cities were built on the flat mountainside. All of a sudden, the people residing there felt that the entire mountainside was sinking. This phenomenon was way beyond their understanding.
<br><br>
At this point, there were more than ten thousand Evil Gods hovering in the sky. They watched as the Pear Hill began sinking gradually. The mockery in their eyes became even more evident.
<br><br>
Then, the Evil God spoke tauntingly, "You don't even stand a chance against me. What makes you think you can take on the Source World?"
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God finished talking, something unusual happened. All of a sudden, the space crystal wall around the Pear Hill changed color.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill's entire inner space was completely sealed! This kind of space sealing was extremely strong and sturdy. It was even quite impossible for Othniel to break free from it.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had already sunk hundreds of feet. But now, its descent was stopped.
<br><br>
Out of nowhere, they heard someone shout. "Truth gives me greater strength!" Gerald roared at the top of his lungs.
<br><br>
When they heard this, Judson and Kendrick also began to extract their truth bloodline fervently.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi's hair was fluttering wildly as the Eight Diagrams beneath his feet were rotating at an extraordinary speed.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Yasamin, King Ieuan, and the Snake Goddess began to exert more strength as well.
<br><br>
Crack! They heard a loud splitting noise.
<br><br>
Crack! It was getting even louder! Crack! The ripping sound that came from around the Pear Hill was deafening. It was as if two invisible and out-of-place cogwheels were grinding against each other.
<br><br>
Little by little, the Pear Hill began to sink once more.
<br><br>
"Your united strength is very commendable. However, you have to remember who you are fighting against." Over ten thousand Evil Gods smiled gracefully at the same time.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, everything that happened this day was according to the Evil God's plan. He even deliberately left the space unlocked just for fun. Otherwise, it would have been extremely difficult for the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and other Eternal Realm warriors to scatter at the Pear Hill's specific places.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
Without warning, numerous blue space chains shot out from every Evil God's body. These space chains were like hidden weapons. They had easily pierced through Kendrick's enchanted barriers and were now drilling into the interior of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
These space chains were highly effective in penetrating and containing the entire mountain. They didn't need to pierce through any of the pressure bearing points.
<br><br>
Afterwards, the Evil Gods pulled the space chains and ascended into the sky.
<br><br>
Originally, the Evil God had a much simpler plan to prevent the escape of the Pear Hill. He had already thought of just killing the Eternal Realm warriors and the Chaos Ancient Gods. However, he thought that it seemed more interesting to deal with the Pear Hill using the space chains.
<br><br>
More than ten thousand Evil Gods were previously Holy Soul Realm masters. Therefore, the power that erupted simultaneously was utterly phenomenal! Together with the power of the space sealing in the Source World, the Pear Hill immediately stopped sinking! In addition to that, it also began to rise gradually! Crack! Crack! Crack! The sound of enormous cogwheels clashing resounded through the whole place once more. Each time they heard a loud cracking sound, the Pear Hill rose by ten feet! In just a short span of time, the entire Pear Hill was lifted from the ground! It was quite unbelievable to watch as the enormous mountain floated in the air. This phenomenon was probably the first one to occur in the Source World! "If you like flying, then fly even higher!" The Evil God laughed wildly.
<br><br>
Everything was going right according to his plan.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
More Evil Gods began to appear at the top of the mountain. Each of them was holding on to a space chain.
<br><br>
And then, ten thousand more Evil Gods appeared.
<br><br>
Now, there were more than twenty thousand of them...
<br><br>
Then thirty thousand...
<br><br>
As the number of the Evil Gods increased, the Pear Hill was also being raised even higher! Chapter 4135 The Helper The current battle was like a tug of war between children and adults.
<br><br>
There was just too big of a difference between both sides.
<br><br>
Despite that, the Pear Hill still did not give up.
<br><br>
"Go down!"
<br><br>
Fuxi yelled and smashed his fist on the ground.
<br><br>
Then, the black and white pattern of the Eight Diagrams shook violently and unleashed a massive force.
<br><br>
Kendrick had constructed the spot where he stood, but it appeared that it was about to collapse.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the other Eternal Realm warriors followed suit.
<br><br>
In the face of almost invincible power, they no longer held back.
<br><br>
They released all their bloodline theurgies and Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
As a result, the downward force increased explosively.
<br><br>
The originally rising mountain began to descend slowly.
<br><br>
However, tens of thousands of the Evil Gods continued to drag the chains upwards.
<br><br>
One of them did not drag the chains. Instead, he folded his arms and looked down. "I appreciate your effort, but this is useless," he scoffed.
<br><br>
After he finished speaking, he stretched out his hand and grabbed downwards into the air.
<br><br>
Splash! At that moment, the whole Pear Hill trembled slightly.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before it stopped falling and slowly rose.
<br><br>
The Evil God could move directly any space, including the vast land of Pear Hill.
<br><br>
When he had lifted the Pear Hill with tens of thousands of avatars, it was just a trick.
<br><br>
"Master Fuxi! Let the Primeval Lord of Heaven descend," Zen said to Fuxi telepathically.
<br><br>
"I... I've already informed him of the situation here. He is still trying to figure out a way," Fuxi answered.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was only at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
He might be stronger than the Eternal Realm warriors of Pear Hill in terms of strength, but it was useless.
<br><br>
One more Eternal Realm warrior could not reverse the situation.
<br><br>
"Ask him to come now!" Zen urged.
<br><br>
At that point, Fuxi's mind was a mess. All he wanted to do now was maximize his strength for the fight. When Zen urged him, he activated the Descending Ring.
<br><br>
Buzz! A beam of golden light flashed, then the Primeval Lord of Heaven descended upon the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Fuxi had informed him of the situation in the Pear Hill through the Descending Ring, so he roughly knew what had happened.
<br><br>
As soon as he arrived, however, he was still shocked when he saw the enormous mountain rising upward. The situation was worse than he had imagined! "A helper from the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
The Evil God's voice rang throughout the sky. He saw how extraordinarily powerful the Primeval Lord of Heaven was, and his aura was even comparable to that of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked up at the Evil God, and cursed loudly, "Evil man!"
<br><br>
Right after that, he disappeared.
<br><br>
He returned to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It made the Evil God confused.
<br><br>
This seemingly powerful man turned out to be rather timid. He ran away without even making a move! Even Zen and Fuxi were rendered speechless.
<br><br>
What was the Primeval Lord of Heaven up to? Not long after, Fuxi glanced up with a strange expression. "Look…"
<br><br>
The Descending Ring flashed again.
<br><br>
Buzz! Upon seeing what happened, Fuxi threw the Descending Ring away.
<br><br>
Then, the Descending Ring unleashed a strange aura, and a massive creature appeared on the Pear Hill. It was the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
As an experienced fighter, the Primeval Lord of Heaven knew well that the Source World was a primitive land, which was difficult to resist.
<br><br>
Thus, in a moment of desperation, he could only ask the Monkey Spirit King for help.
<br><br>
He had already wanted to try it, but he never actually thought that the Monkey Spirit King was quite friendly.
<br><br>
When the Monkey Spirit King heard that Zen was in danger, he agreed without hesitation.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven just went to check the current situation, then he handed the Descending Ring over to the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
"Are you the evil side of the world?" the Monkey Spirit King asked as he looked at the avatars of the Evil God.
<br><br>
The negative emotions of a world were not a new thing.
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect had witnessed such emotions since they had built many worlds.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King never cared about those things, but he had fought many evil creatures from various worlds, so he could tell the Evil God's origin at a glance.
<br><br>
"Who are you?"
<br><br>
The avatars of the Evil God looked at the Monkey Spirit King, and all their arrogance was gone.
<br><br>
The Evil God had keen senses and particularly sharp eyes.
<br><br>
He felt an indescribable aura from this extraordinarily giant ape. He truly admired such powerful strength.
<br><br>
Even the Grandmaster of Heaven and the Primeval Lord of Heaven could not make him feel the same things, but this giant ape had done it.
<br><br>
What kind of creature was this? He was not the only one who was puzzled, though.
<br><br>
There were many warriors at the Holy Soul Realm on the Pear Hill, who all looked at the Monkey Spirit King in disbelief.
<br><br>
His unparalleled strength shocked them hugely.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Monkey Spirit King grinned and ignored the Evil God.
<br><br>
For him, an evil creature from a small energy pool was not even worth mentioning.
<br><br>
Still, it did not mean that it was easy to kill the Evil God.
<br><br>
Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven had asked him for help, he would use the simplest way to solve the problem.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! To do so, he stretched out his hands and fiercely slapped the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Before he did that, Kendrick temporarily removed the three enchanted barriers. Otherwise, the barriers would collapse under his slap.
<br><br>
The moment he slapped the mountain, two palm prints with a diameter of ten thousand miles appeared, his enormous body at the center.
<br><br>
Even if the palm prints were quite huge and he applied the power evenly across the mountain, many parts of the mountain still collapsed.
<br><br>
Large boulders submerged some large cities, and violent earthquakes killed multitudes of mortals in the cities. Millions of people had died or gotten injured. Today was a disaster for the disciples of the Pear Hill, and it was the end for the ordinary people who were born and raised in this place.
<br><br>
Afterward, the Pear Hill, which the Evil God had dragged upwards, began to sink quickly.
<br><br>
The speed at which it sank far exceeded the rate before and even tens of thousands of Evil Gods in the sky fell.
<br><br>
Indeed, the Monkey Spirit King's power had fully reversed the situation.
<br><br>
"You want to escape? It's not that easy!"
<br><br>
One of the Evil Gods gritted his teeth.
<br><br>
He wanted to use the power of the Source World to keep the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Yet, even if the locked space was powerful, it was useless against the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the force continually tore the locked space apart, while blue lightning kept shooting out from the area around the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Splash! A few seconds later, the Pear Hill finally sank to the ground, passed through the shallow earth, and fell out from the chaos.
<br><br>
As for the Source World, its vast territory floated above everyone's head.
<br><br>
The people below it could not see its entirety from such an angle. They only saw a big, circular hole in the place where the Pear Hill was formerly located.
<br><br>
When the Pear Hill fell out of the Source World, so did tens of thousands of Evil Gods.
<br><br>
After they left the Source World, the space chains on the Evil Gods' bodies immediately disappeared. At the same time, the effect of possession also faded away, and they returned to their original appearances.
<br><br>
The only thing was that they had no idea that the Evil God had possessed them, nor did they know why they floated between the Pear Hill and the Source World. They felt confused.
<br><br>
Buzz! They heard an odd sound, and fortunately, Kendrick responded fast.
<br><br>
Before the chaotic energy swept towards these tens of thousands of people, an enchanted barrier had already enveloped them and immediately pulled them back to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Only then did Zen and the others sigh in relief.
<br><br>
Although the Pear Hill suffered many losses, they still managed to get out of the Source World.
<br><br>
Just as they were about to settle down, they heard the Evil God's roaring voice from the gap in the Source World. "You want to escape? No way!"
<br><br>
Then, the gap in the Source World cracked until it formed a large mouth.
<br><br>
The mouth, which spanned across about seven provinces, bit towards the Pear Hill like a shark preying on small fish.
<br><br>
Chapter 4136 The Battle Of Consciousness Since the birth of the Source World as the primitive land, it had been quietly floating and never moved away.
<br><br>
Under the Evil God's control, the moving speed of the Source World became much faster than that of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Zen, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others were dumbfounded as the Source World revealed a huge mouth.
<br><br>
At this speed, the Pear Hill would quickly be devoured by the Source World again.
<br><br>
"What should we do?"
<br><br>
"The Pear Hill can't speed up!"
<br><br>
"If it continues to move at this speed, it will definitely be swallowed up!"
<br><br>
Everyone was anxious, their hearts racing at the events that unfolded before their eyes.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was different from the divine land. The divine land was a large ship that Chiyou had planned for a long time before it set sail. He had accumulated a huge amount of divine crystals to drive the divine land.
<br><br>
However, the plan to separate the Pear Hill from the Source World was a spur of the moment. There was no fuel to drive the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Evil God stood in the middle of the mouth. The billowing chaotic energy blew past him, but he remained unmoved.
<br><br>
"You can't escape. What a waste that all your efforts will be in vain!"
<br><br>
he declared with eyes full of excitement.
<br><br>
His voice reverberated from the Source World and echoed throughout the empty chaos.
<br><br>
As the Source World drew closer and closer to the Pear Hill, the Evil God's body suddenly trembled as his face was struck with confusion.
<br><br>
After a few moments, he felt something breaking into the consciousness of the Source World.
<br><br>
The consciousness of the Source World had always been controllable. The Evil God entered it without any obstacle blocking his way.
<br><br>
After continuously fusing with the consciousness of the Source World, the Evil God built a wall in the Land of Consciousness to prevent the entrance of external beings.
<br><br>
Breaking into the consciousness of the Source World was difficult. The Evil God didn't think anyone else in the Source World could do it.
<br><br>
He built the wall just in case, but now something unexpected had really arrived! Controlling the movement of the Source World consumed a lot of the Evil God's energy. If he wanted to resist external invasion, he could just give up chasing after the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Evil God tried to make a choice decisively.
<br><br>
Although it was important to take down the Pear Hill and Zen, the Source World was the foundation of his strength.
<br><br>
Once he was expelled from the Land of Consciousness in the Source World, he would lose everything.
<br><br>
After weighing the pros and cons, the Evil God gave up chasing after the Pear Hill with no hesitation. He chose to focus on fighting against the invader.
<br><br>
Zen and the others had already lost hope.
<br><br>
If the Pear Hill was taken back by the Source World, they would completely be annihilated.
<br><br>
Although the Monkey Spirit King was not afraid of the Evil God, the Evil God could avoid him and kill all the people in the mountain.
<br><br>
As everyone fell into great despair, the Source World suddenly slowed down and gradually stopped. In return, the Pear Hill instantly drifted away from the Source World.
<br><br>
"Why did the Source World stop?"
<br><br>
"Did the Evil God give up?"
<br><br>
"Is he going to let us go?"
<br><br>
Everyone on the mountain was puzzled about what just happened.
<br><br>
Zen, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess all returned to the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
They looked at the huge crack and were curious as to why it was leaving.
<br><br>
"With the character of the Evil God, he would never give up at such a critical moment," said Fuxi.
<br><br>
Zen agreed, "Unless he meets some kind of irresistible force that poses a huge threat to him."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess tilted her head, concentrating harder. "The Evil God has snatched Usman's power. Usman worked for the Yellow Thearch, the Element Spirit Civilization, and even the Snake Masters. I don't think they'll just sit around and do nothing."
<br><br>
The others nodded as they all came to an understanding.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was most likely right.
<br><br>
The Source World was the largest primitive land in the chaos upholding its status.
<br><br>
It was not a big deal that the Evil God had devoured Usman and gained his power. But now that the Evil God was about to take complete control of the Source World, could the Element Spirit Civilization and the Snake Masters manage to stay still? Fortunately, the Pear Hill had escaped from disaster and protectively floated into the depths of the chaos.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King stayed in the mountain for a long time before returning to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In the consciousness of the Source World, thousands of white snowballs floated in the air.
<br><br>
The snowballs were soft and a little cold. These were the consciousness of the Source World.
<br><br>
The consciousness of the Source World was illusory and motile. It was almost impossible to touch or even find it.
<br><br>
In the Source World, some legends said that if the mortals in the provinces happened to see and make wishes to the snowballs, the Source World would help them grant their wishes.
<br><br>
The Evil God, however, wasn't sure whether these legends were true or not.
<br><br>
He had found the Land of Consciousness by using Usman's power.
<br><br>
Only he was able to find it. The wall he built using the consciousness of the Source World was not solid and performed no function at all.
<br><br>
A black snake writhed rapidly through the Land of Consciousness. He drilled into one of the white snowballs, tainting it dark from the inside out.
<br><br>
The black snake then jerked to the next snowball.
<br><br>
The moment just enough white snowballs turned black, this snake could also obtain the power of the Source World.
<br><br>
But he soon met his opponent.
<br><br>
At a distance, some red snowballs started to float, and one of them turned into the shape of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Who are you? How did you get here?" the Evil God asked as he stared at the little black snake.
<br><br>
He found that the black snake emitted a strange and powerful aura which was similar to that of the giant ape.
<br><br>
This crushed him.
<br><br>
He had once thought himself to be the strongest in the chaos.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization was nothing compared to him.
<br><br>
The Nihility race even had to obey everything he ordered and assured to meet all his demands.
<br><br>
With the support of the Source World, the Evil God didn't expect highly of the two strongest forces on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But that giant ape suddenly appeared, causing him confusion.
<br><br>
Where did the giant ape come from? Was there such a powerful creature in the chaos? The giant ape was the one who saved the Pear Hill while an equally strong little snake appeared in the Land of Consciousness.
<br><br>
Doubts began to flood the Evil God as he realized his flawed understanding of this world.
<br><br>
"The primitive land doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve to have a hand in it," the little black snake hissed.
<br><br>
The Evil God laughed. "How do you say it isn't mine? Do you own it?"
<br><br>
"Of course, it's ours. We haven't made a move because it isn't time yet,"
<br><br>
the snake boasted. "You still have time to leave, just after you return all the contaminated consciousness," he ordered.
<br><br>
Previously, when the Evil God absorbed Usman, it did not attract the Snake Masters' attention.
<br><br>
Usman represented the negative will. He could not invade the Land of Consciousness and it had never happened before.
<br><br>
But the Evil God had done it, so the Snake Masters didn't think twice of making a move.
<br><br>
When the Evil God maximized the power of the Source World, his body also changed into its weakest. They seized the chance to take action at their obvious advantage.
<br><br>
The little black snake had just contaminated seven snowballs. The Evil God had stayed here for a long time. Tens of thousands of red snowballs floated behind him.
<br><br>
The Evil God sneered, "I guess it's too late for you to leave now."
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The red snowballs swarmed towards the little black snake, like a snow storm that coalesced to blanket him.
<br><br>
Chapter 4137 Abnormal Phenomena It had been a small fight within the Land of Consciousness.
<br><br>
Anyone at the Holy Soul Realm could deal with the Evil God, and the black snake here without any difficulty.
<br><br>
However, because the Land of Consciousness was different, any powerful figures could not enter it. Even formidable beings such as the Evil God and the black snake could not unleash their full soul force within the land.
<br><br>
The fight had caused great disaster in the Source World though.
<br><br>
When the Evil God and the little black snake had contaminated the consciousness of the Source World, many dramatic changes began to take place in the provinces.
<br><br>
When the creatures began to fight using their powerful minds, the consciousness of the Source World quickly fell into great chaos and disorder.
<br><br>
Booming crashes echoed harshly.
<br><br>
The crystal walls surrounding the Grey Fish Province shattered into pieces, and its fragments scattered in all directions. The jagged pieces rained down on the provinces nearby, wounding and piercing through countless creatures.
<br><br>
The oceans of the Wood Province surged and rolled, the water evaporating to form a thick vapor that smothered the entire province.
<br><br>
Within the Ice Province the ground had cracked to divide the land into many parts.
<br><br>
Numerous kinds of strange phenomena were taking place all over the provinces. As a result, countless inhabitants in those places were either injured or dead.
<br><br>
It was fortunate then that the phenomena did not last long.
<br><br>
It had taken eight hours, but the Source World finally returned to a peaceful state.
<br><br>
The Land of Consciousness though was in a mess.
<br><br>
Despite the fact that the little black snake was a part of the Snake Spirit King's soul, his time within the Land of Consciousness was too short compared to that of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Nearly half of the Source World's consciousness had been corrupted by the Evil God, while the black snake had only been able to pollute a small portion of it.
<br><br>
The black snake might have been far stronger than the Evil God, but he still fell at the hand of the latter.
<br><br>
The only reason the Evil God had won was his strategy to use the Source World's own consciousness against the snake.
<br><br>
Lost in thought, the Evil God stared down at the dead snake as he contemplated devouring his soul for his power.
<br><br>
He of course had the ability to absorb souls, so it shouldn't pose an issue.
<br><br>
After another moment of short consideration, the Evil God controlled his greed and decided against it.
<br><br>
The little black snake was too mysterious, too much of an unknown.
<br><br>
There was really no telling what would happen if he devoured his soul.
<br><br>
It was much too risky to take the chance.
<br><br>
So he picked up the snake and tossed him over his shoulder to disappear in the Land of Consciousness.
<br><br>
An ear-splitting roar suddenly split the sky. It came from the Heavenly Square City of the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Cornelius was going ballistic.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's body lay across the whole city, but he always tried to remain unseen within the city.
<br><br>
He entrusted most of his affairs to the Snake Masters. Majority of the creatures within the city didn't know of his existence.
<br><br>
The roar had caused some sections of the space to collapse, forming large, jagged cracks. From the cracks crawled numerous Treacherous Beings and creatures from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
As they all looked up to the sky, a monstrous snake head was glaring down at them.
<br><br>
Cornelius hissed sharply at them, commanding their attention.
<br><br>
Fury was evident in his eyes. A slimy, forked tongue flicked from his mouth, and his crescent-shaped eyes glinted with dark golden light.
<br><br>
The human spirits of the Joy, Broad and Black Houses walked out of the Heavenly Square City and stared blankly up at the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"What has the Snake Spirit King so angry?"
<br><br>
"This is the first time I've ever seen him throw a tantrum..."
<br><br>
"Hopefully he won't decide to take it out on us."
<br><br>
Even though the human spirits had always been loyal to the Snake Spirit King, they still feared his wrath.
<br><br>
The leader of the Joy House, Alphonse observed the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
He felt a trickle of happiness inch down his spine, but he made sure to show no outward sign of the emotion.
<br><br>
Alphonse thought about what the king's anger might mean for them. It could mean his original plan failed, or something stood in its way, so he had to strategize a new one. This could bode well for them.
<br><br>
The Black House, the Joy House and the Broad House in the Ten Directions House of the Human Spirit Sect, had joined the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Both Gianni's and Alphonse's coordinates were in the hands of the Snake Masters.
<br><br>
There was no way to take back their freedom without their coordinates.
<br><br>
The air broke apart with a loud whooshing sound.
<br><br>
Sewell had snapped his tail as he'd climbed to the top of the Heavenly Square City.
<br><br>
"My king, what makes you so angry?" he asked, his voice shaking. He had seldom ever seen the king become so enraged.
<br><br>
"A piece of my soul has failed his mission..." the Snake Spirit King snarled.
<br><br>
Sewell raised his head abruptly, and looked at the Snake Spirit King in shock.
<br><br>
Sewell knew exactly what had angered the king from those few words.
<br><br>
The last time Sewell had witnessed the Evil God's display of power in the Blood Sea Province, he knew he was a danger to them. He had immediately reported everything to the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
At the time, the Snake Spirit King did not take his words seriously.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King had ruled over the chaos for an incredibly long time. Everything was under his strict control. But the unconscious Bird Spirit King and the recently awakened Monkey Spirit King unnerved him.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King believed the Chaos Ancient Gods and warriors of the Eternal Realm in the Source World were insignificant and did not deserve any thought or consideration.
<br><br>
Sewell was assured though at the time by the Snake Spirit King's calm attitude.
<br><br>
Even though the Evil God had control of the primitive land, Sewell believed that his king would be able to conquer it once more.
<br><br>
But now that his king was admitting defeat, Sewell was drowning in the shock of it.
<br><br>
'What are we going to do now?' Sewell, who was always calm, was unsure of what to do now.
<br><br>
'The primitive land is a crucial part of our plan. It can't be in the hands of other people.' The Snake Spirit King regained his composure, and glanced down at the Treacherous Beings and creatures from the Other Shore that had gathered.
<br><br>
"Take the coordinates of these Treacherous Beings to the Mist City. It is time to end the battle that has lasted hundreds of chaotic eras," he said.
<br><br>
There was a flash of surprise in Sewell's eyes. "Wouldn't that be too rash, Your Majesty? Perhaps we should give it a little more thought, come up with a better idea," he tried.
<br><br>
"This is not up for discussion! It is an order!" The Snake Spirit King spoke coldly, "If the Bird Masters know about the situation and react quickly, our plan that has lasted over a thousand chaotic eras would be ruined."
<br><br>
The worst part of it all was not that the Evil God controlled the Source World. What scared the Snake Spirit King the most was the thought that the Bird Masters might learn how to utilize the Source World.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Snake Spirit King had to destroy that possibility at any cost.
<br><br>
The battle in the Jade Pure Realm had lasted hundreds of chaotic eras because the coordinates of either side were in their respective strongholds.
<br><br>
Both parties had battled many times, but they had never suffered any losses and the coordinates were the reason for that.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King had ordered the coordinates taken to the Mist City, and things were different now.
<br><br>
While the Treacherous Beings on the side of the Snake Spirit Sect could come back to life within the Mist City, increasing the odds of the sect winning, it came with a massive risk.
<br><br>
That way, if they were defeated, their coordinates would be erased by the Bird Masters and the people of the Snake Spirit Sect would be dead for good.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, Cornelius would never think to adopt this terrible strategy for it was too much of a risk.
<br><br>
But the intervention of the Evil God left him no other choice.
<br><br>
Chapter 4138 Show Up Having received the Snake Spirit King's orders, Sewell and the Snake Masters quickly mobilized and transmitted the commands to their subordinates.
<br><br>
Soon enough, all major forces in the Heavenly Square City began to move out.
<br><br>
Truth be told, the Treacherous Beings found this war kind of boring.
<br><br>
They knew almost all the names of their opponents and some of them even recorded the times they'd killed each other.
<br><br>
"I've killed that same guy forty-nine times. Just leave him to me! I'll make my count reach fifty!"
<br><br>
"I hope the Bird Masters won't target me again."
<br><br>
"I want to fight against my opponent alone!"
<br><br>
These were the kinds of conversations that could be heard among the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Endless resurrection had rendered death insignificant and they felt no fear in the face of impending doom.
<br><br>
This time, however, the Snake Masters informed them that their coordinates were to move out of Heavenly Square City and into Mist City.
<br><br>
The Mist City was currently occupied by the Bird Masters.
<br><br>
It seemed that the Snake Masters chose to put up a desperate fight to gain control.
<br><br>
This caused the Treacherous Beings to doubt the operation and a few radical warriors even refused outright to go.
<br><br>
However, their coordinates were in the hands of the Snake Masters so any sort of resistance was futile.
<br><br>
News soon spread across the three human houses and the human spirits could only look at each other in understanding.
<br><br>
They already knew something was up with the Snake Spirit Sect. The suspicion towards the sect was deeply set in their hearts the moment they awoke.
<br><br>
The prospect of leaving crossed their minds but they knew it would be meaningless if they couldn't take their coordinates with them.
<br><br>
Now that the Snake Spirit King gave this order, they realized that this was potentially a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
<br><br>
Alphonse, the leader of the Joy House, was the most eager for this chance.
<br><br>
He had long been aware of the Snake Spirit Sect's hypocrisy and itched to take back what was his.
<br><br>
"This time, the three houses of the Human Spirit Sect are under Gianni's command!" a Snake Master announced. "Listen to him! If you don't, I'll erase your coordinates and kill you."
<br><br>
Gianni was someone who had always been loyal to the Snake Spirit Sect so they naturally trusted him to lead the operation.
<br><br>
"Alphonse, Hamilton, I'd appreciate it if you lend me a hand if we ever run into trouble in Mist City," Gianni remarked with a smile.
<br><br>
Their faces instantly darkened and a lot of the other human spirits present shot Gianni a harsh glare.
<br><br>
As a general of the Ten Directions House, Gianni was able to come into power by groveling to the Snake Masters and punishing his own clansmen. He was, essentially, a disgrace to the human spirits.
<br><br>
Even those from the Broad House did not associate with Gianni but did not dare to complain given the latter's status.
<br><br>
Not long after, they began their journey towards Mist City.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, inside the Mysterious Yellow Tower, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's beard had gotten warped.
<br><br>
"Dale, you have to go."
<br><br>
"No," the young man in a cyan robe vehemently refused. "I don't want to die!"
<br><br>
They were within the protective bubbles at the bottom of the Jade Pure Realm. If they left, they would most likely be discovered, which equated to a swift death. There was no way the young man would be willing to die.
<br><br>
"You are the one with the most special ability amongst all disciples. The possibilities of them discovering you are small," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord assured him.
<br><br>
However, Dale shook his head stubbornly. "We can wait for Geoffrey and have him deliver the messages," he said.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord sighed and tried to reign in his annoyance. "There's no time for waiting. Zen and the others have already left the Source World and the snakes and birds are set to fight anytime soon. We cannot let this opportunity pass."
<br><br>
Based on their previous plan, Geoffrey was the one tasked to deliver the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's messages.
<br><br>
However, after he greatly enhanced the Lone Sword's power, Geoffrey climbed towards the top of the pillar and was never heard again.
<br><br>
They got no news of him whether he was in trouble or if he was alright.
<br><br>
"One more day," Dale bargained.
<br><br>
"No!"
<br><br>
"Half a day?"
<br><br>
"No!"
<br><br>
"Two hours?"
<br><br>
"Get out!"
<br><br>
To Dale's horror, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord began to forcibly expel him.
<br><br>
The ground began to bubble and a huge force sucked Dale's body out.
<br><br>
As soon as he was swallowed up by the ground, several vines quickly shot out towards him.
<br><br>
These plants grew in the Jade Pure Realm and possessed extraordinary intelligence. They moved like snakes, placid and still at first yet ready to strike when Dale came near.
<br><br>
Completely wrapped by the plants, he had no choice but to stop moving.
<br><br>
After a while, Dale's body soon turned a shade of emerald green and became one with the vines that crawled along the ground.
<br><br>
This was his bloodline power: to turn into anything and everything in this world.
<br><br>
Several green vines began to make their way forward. They crawled for over a hundred miles until they arrived in front of a pure black desert which was one of the places with a bad environment in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
When they entered the vicinity, the sand began to shake and countless thumb-sized insects emerged.
<br><br>
These insects attacked any living creature that entered the desert.
<br><br>
However, before they could launch their attacks against the vines, the plants suddenly split into hundreds of pieces. From dark green, they transformed into pure black and morphed into the appearance of the black insects.
<br><br>
Dale continued to change his form along the way and was able to leave the Jade Pure Realm successfully as a group of rats.
<br><br>
It was quite a sight to see a dozen rats enter the Grand Pure Realm. Dale was heading north, towards the Night View Island's entrance.
<br><br>
However, as soon as he arrived, two Monkey Masters stopped him, or rather them since his form was a group of rats.
<br><br>
In order to prevent any future damage to the Night View Island's passageway, the Monkey Spirit Sect saw it fit to employ two powerful Monkey Masters to guard it.
<br><br>
They had sharp eyes and were immediately alerted by the arrival of these rats.
<br><br>
"Who are you?!" one of them barked. "Show your true self."
<br><br>
With his demand, the rats began to pile up and soon morphed into Dale's true form.
<br><br>
He bowed to the Monkey Masters respectfully. "Monkey Masters, I have something important to report."
<br><br>
It was a good thing that the Monkey Masters knew of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zen's group so they did not dare to reject humans. They did not ask Dale any more questions and took him into the Night View Island.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had just finished dealing with the Pear Hill's matter since its separation from the Source World caused the human heroes a bit of considerable panic.
<br><br>
So he was a bit curious when he was told that a human had requested to see him.
<br><br>
The sight of Dale dumbfounded the human heroes. What was the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's eldest disciple doing here? "Dale?"
<br><br>
"You're not dead?!" "You're alive!"
<br><br>
Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who was always the epitome of calm, was stunned.
<br><br>
Dale pouted sourly. "Did you guys expect me to die?"
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Primeval Lord of Heaven simply brushed off his attitude.
<br><br>
"How is the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord?" he asked. "Is he still alive?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4139 Initiate Zen Into Cultivation The human heroes all looked at Dale with concern.
<br><br>
"Yes," Dale replied with a nod. "He's still alive."
<br><br>
The human heroes were stunned at this revelation. The Primeval Lord of Heaven let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
It was the answer he was hoping for. It was like a thorn was just pulled from him.
<br><br>
This meant the human race in the seventy-seventh chaos did not really fall into decline! After all, the human heroes led by the Primeval Lord of Heaven survived to this day, and now, they had found that so had the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was also doing fine, although he was now on the opposing side.
<br><br>
The survival of the three fellow disciples was nothing short of a miracle.
<br><br>
"So where is he? Why did he disappear after entering the Jade Pure Realm?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven pressed.
<br><br>
"It's a long story. After entering the Jade Pure Realm, we ran into some trouble..." Dale then launched into the story of what happened to their party a long time ago.
<br><br>
"We had been hiding in the bubbles all this time to evade the Snake Spirit King. It was near-impossible to leave, but I took a huge risk to come here."
<br><br>
"What was so urgent that you had to come here, then?" the Snake Goddess asked curiously.
<br><br>
Dale's gaze swept through the human heroes. Apparently not finding who he was looking for, he turned his attention back to the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"I'm here for Zen."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess and the others all shot each other a knowing look.
<br><br>
Dale didn't need to say anything more. They were sharp enough to know what he came here for.
<br><br>
Zen had displayed exceptional abilities since he had entered the Creation Myth Temple.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess also knew from having entered Zen's inner world as energy souls that it was a primitive land. From there, Zen had evolved more and more until he finally obtained the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
This growth was extraordinary and could not be attributed to mere luck.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess were thus able to deduce that Zen had an extremely powerful backer.
<br><br>
But that only left them more confused.
<br><br>
Even the Monkey Spirit King wouldn't be able to orchestrate such a feat.
<br><br>
Who could possibly be so powerful that they could enable Zen to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline? It was beyond imagining! All this time, none of them could figure it out.
<br><br>
"So it was my senior fellow disciple all along?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven mused aloud with a quizzical look.
<br><br>
He respected the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord very much, but if he was the one behind Zen, it would be somewhat of a blow to his ego. It would imply the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was far more advanced than him now.
<br><br>
"That is correct. In fact, the Grand Weapon Refining Method that Zen cultivated was given by my master," Dale answered.
<br><br>
"The Grand Weapon Refining Method..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven muttered, with some bitterness in his voice. "His theurgies must be far beyond my reach now."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess pursed her lips. She had always wondered where the Grand Weapon Refining Method had come from, but Zen hadn't known either when she had asked him. She would never have thought it was related to the long-missing Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
"But my master is not as powerful as you think," said Dale with a smile.
<br><br>
"The Grand Weapon Refining Method was not a theurgy he created. It was given by a human spirit."
<br><br>
"Given?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven's white eyebrows shot up. "How about the ancestry-level bloodline?"
<br><br>
"That's because of the Grand Weapon Refining Method," Dale answered.
<br><br>
"Do you have any way to control it?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
Zen had already mastered the Blood-controlling Method, but he hadn't been able to fully control the ancestry-level bloodline yet.
<br><br>
"That's precisely why I'm here," Dale said. "Can you summon Zen to the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded and took out the Descending Ring.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had been floating in the chaos for a few days. It hadn't moved around too much.
<br><br>
But to the hundreds of millions of creatures occupying the mountain, their world had been upended.
<br><br>
They were still reeling from losing the support of the Source World, although the drifting chaotic energy was blocked by the enchanted barrier and most of them wouldn't have left Pear Hill anyway.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had ordered all the large cities in the west of the mountain to move to the east. The relocation was completed in just a few days.
<br><br>
Streaks of purple energy now flowed around the stones on the west mountainside. When the energy touched the stones, they would turn into golden iron or silver steel, constantly changing shapes.
<br><br>
It was the truth power of the Chaos Ancient God Judson.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had left in a hurry, driven only by the power of the three Chaos Ancient Gods. There had been no change to its speed since then.
<br><br>
Judson's truth power could create and reshape materials at will. He was currently trying to turn Pear Hill into a giant ship so that it could travel in the vast chaos.
<br><br>
Standing at the western mountainside, Zen looked at the transformation and thought of the divine land.
<br><br>
He had been in the Source World for so many years. He had no idea where the divine land was now.
<br><br>
Once the ship was completed, Zen had planned to request the Snake Goddess to have him pilot it in search of the divine land.
<br><br>
Zen was lost in these thoughts when the space around him suddenly started rippling. Fuxi promptly appeared in front of him. "The Primeval Lord of Heaven summons you to the Other Shore."
<br><br>
Zen nodded and sat down to recite the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, transporting him in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven," Zen greeted as he arrived, bowing slightly and cupping his hands.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled warmly in response. "We have some good news. We have found the answer to your longstanding question of where the Grand Weapon Refining Method came from."
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows. At this moment, he spotted the stranger in a cyan robe not far away.
<br><br>
Bromley had obtained the Grand Weapon Refining Method in the chaos, but even he had never been convinced it was entirely coincidental. After all, the probability of picking up a palm-sized golden page in that vast space was infinitesimally small.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" Zen asked the stranger.
<br><br>
"My name is Dale," Dale said, bowing slightly and cupping his hands in reverence. "I came here under orders of my master to initiate you into cultivation."
<br><br>
"Initiate?" Zen repeated in confusion.
<br><br>
He had been cultivating for many years, working so hard that he had finally reached the Eternal Realm. Wasn't he long past the initiation stage? The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were likewise puzzled by Dale's statement.
<br><br>
But Dale held firm. "Yes, initiate. May I enter your inner world to have a look?"
<br><br>
Zen glanced at the Primeval Lord of Heaven. He nodded encouragingly.
<br><br>
Zen then created an avatar in his inner world, and also placed the souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess and Dale into his inner world.
<br><br>
Zen's inner world had developed quite well. Everything appeared to be running in an orderly manner, due in part to the efforts of the souls of the human heroes.
<br><br>
But Dale took one look and let out a long sigh. "My master was right.
<br><br>
This primitive land is just desolate."
<br><br>
Chapter 4140 A Conjecture Dale's words displeased the Primeval Lord of Heaven. He was annoyed at what the former thought.
<br><br>
The human heroes' energy souls had stayed inside Zen's inner world before. Once there, they had spent a lot of time and energy in making it a better place.
<br><br>
Compared to the inner worlds of other people, Zen's inner world could easily be marked as one of the best.
<br><br>
But Dale was saying that it was a desolate place, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven felt humiliated.
<br><br>
"Ahem..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven tried to hide his anger with a cough and then asked, "Dale, this inner world is built according to the human race's Heaven and Earth Separation Method. What's more, the world runs remarkably well considering its complexity. Why are you saying that it is a desolate place?"
<br><br>
Dale glanced at the Primeval Lord of Heaven and then explained with a smile, "It is true that the Heaven and Earth Separation Method is the best way to build the inner worlds of ordinary warriors. However, that is not valid here. This is the primitive land. Even if the world runs so well, it's of no use here. It's too small..."
<br><br>
Once again, Zen's inner world was not small, especially when compared to those of ordinary warriors. One could even say that it was remarkably larger than people usually thought possible.
<br><br>
Dale, however, was coming up with these comments because he was judging that world by the standards of the primitive land.
<br><br>
Compared to the Source World, Zen's inner world was easily as tiny as a dust particle.
<br><br>
This time, the Primeval Lord of Heaven did not refute his statement.
<br><br>
Instead, he asked, "Do you know a way to expand his inner world?"
<br><br>
After the Primeval Lord of Heaven's soul fragment had entered Zen's inner world, he had also tried his best to expand it, but had been unsuccessful.
<br><br>
Theoretically, it had the potential to grow infinitely.
<br><br>
In fact, when the Source World was born, it wasn't as huge as its contemporary presence. It had slowly expanded over time by devouring the chaotic energy.
<br><br>
But the Primeval Lord of Heaven had been unsuccessful because to be honest, he didn't know much about the primitive land, and therefore, couldn't find a way to expand it. In the end, he had been left with no choice but to treat the primitive land as an ordinary inner world.
<br><br>
"Of course." Dale nodded. "I know a way, which is also the key to controlling the ancestry-level bloodline."
<br><br>
Once warriors reached the Other Shore Realm, then the inner worlds became less important. The biggest function of these inner worlds was to carry the objects their owners had obtained from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In fact, the Chaotic Source Realm and the Holy Soul Realm were merely enhanced realms on the Other Shore Realm. The real change happened when one entered the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
At that point, their inner world became almost completely insignificant.
<br><br>
It was true that the bloodline inherited from the Eternal Scroll Painting could affect the inner world.
<br><br>
For example, Fuxi had created huge Eight Diagrams in his inner world.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess' shadows were flying around everywhere in her inner world. The inner world could also store a portion of the bloodline power.
<br><br>
However, the capacity was limited. The amount of bloodline power that could be stored was less than one-tenth of the cultivators' own power. That could be easily overlooked.
<br><br>
"What should I do?" Zen asked in a confused tone.
<br><br>
Judging by what Dale was saying, it looked like he had completely ignored the real function of his inner world.
<br><br>
He was omniscient in his inner world, but that omniscience did not reach outside.
<br><br>
And expanding his own inner world was beyond Zen's talents and knowledge.
<br><br>
"Direct the ancestry-level bloodline into your inner world, and this will allow you to create a world of blood and flesh," said Dale.
<br><br>
Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess looked at each other with a confused expression on their faces. They couldn't understand what Dale was saying. How was he supposed to create a world of flesh and blood? "That is what that human spirit told us," Dale continued explaining.
<br><br>
"However, my master told me that the human spirit was not fully confident of its success. It is only a conjecture that the ancestry-level bloodline can be controlled in the primitive land. And now, Zen has a chance to verify this conjecture!"
<br><br>
Dale's proposal was interesting. The domain Zen had got his hands on was something that the Four Spirits Sect had never reached, or perhaps even heard of.
<br><br>
The advantage was that he might obtain power that even the Human Spirit King, the Monkey Spirit King, the Bird Sprit King, or the Snake Spirit King could never catch up with. However, the flip side was that no one knew what he should do next. His only way forward was to explore the unknown bit by bit. Even the human spirit had only pointed out a possibility...
<br><br>
"So you are not going to teach him the cultivation method of the ancestrylevel bloodline?" The Snake Goddess curled her lips. Her expectations had been raised after hearing the possibilities a few moments ago, but now Dale was telling them it was all just a conjecture. Was he kidding? "There is no cultivation method..." Dale shook his head.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven still did not seem discouraged. Instead, he suddenly asked, "That human spirit you're talking about... Is his surname Xue?"
<br><br>
Dale's eyes opened wide in shock. "How did you know..."
<br><br>
No matter how powerful the Primeval Lord of Heaven was, it was impossible for him to guess that human spirit's surname. Some secrets were way too hidden even for people like him to find out. But he had.
<br><br>
Not only that, Zen's and the Snake Goddess's eyes also flickered. Then the Snake Goddess piped up, "If our guess is right, then the human spirit should be Elder Xue from the Bold Conjecture House!"
<br><br>
When they had looked through the stone tablets of the Monkey Spirit Sect, they had found a few clues about the ancestry-level bloodline. In addition to Kincaid, who was the Human Spirit King, another highly important name that they had come across was of Elder Xue. In order to find a way to merge with the ancestry-level bloodline, Elder Xue had gone to the Deep Space. And no news had been heard of or from him ever since.
<br><br>
When the Primeval Lord of Heaven had heard the word "conjecture", the name had crossed his mind immediately and he'd just blurted it out without too much thought. He never could have expected that he would end up being right.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue's achievements with regards to the ancestry-level bloodline should not be considered inferior to that of the Human Spirit King.
<br><br>
Moreover, he had gone to the Deep Space and chances are, he might have gained something whilst he was there," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with a smile. "Although I don't know much about the main world, judging by what the records on those stone tablets say, I also came up with a few conclusions. Since the ancestry-level bloodline is from the Deep Space, a way to control it is likely to be found there as well. That makes Elder Xue the most likely one to find it."
<br><br>
"I can give what you said a shot," Zen piped up.
<br><br>
Previously, he had been unable to activate ancestry-level bloodline at will.
<br><br>
But after cultivating the Blood-controlling Method, it was not a difficult task for him.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, his avatar sat down cross legged and floated up into the air inside his inner world.
<br><br>
To be honest, he still had some doubts in his heart.
<br><br>
Although the Blood-controlling Method allowed him to activate the ancestry-level bloodline, it only allowed the simplest usage of the bloodline. Furthermore, it was unable to provide him with a means to divide the ancestry-level bloodline. Once a portion of the ancestry-level bloodline was forced into his inner world, it would definitely cause some backlash! He had to be ready for that.
<br><br>
There were risks, but Zen also knew that often, a mere thought, word, or idea that ordinary people couldn't even imagine coming up with, could work wonders.
<br><br>
The moment the first drop of the ancestry-level bloodline was injected into his inner world, Zen's body began to tremble violently.
<br><br>
His entire body turned as white as paper all of a sudden, and all trace of blood vanished from every single part of his body. Even his eyes, ears, nose and mouth were drained of color.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline couldn't wait to leave Zen's physical body and madly rushed into his inner world.
<br><br>
Once Zen's meridians were completely dried up, his life force quickly faded away, as if he was about to die.
<br><br>
Out of the blue, Zen's real body and his avatar in his inner world fell down with a flop. His body seemed cold now.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess saw this scene, her expression changed. She quickly withdrew her soul fragment from Zen's inner world. She couldn't let Zen die.
<br><br>
With a gentle wave of her hand, a green leaf appeared in the center of her palm. She grabbed Zen's jaw and forcefully stuffed the leaf into his mouth.
<br><br>
This leaf was known as the Heavenly Immortal Leaf and it contained an enormous amount of life energy. Once Zen had absorbed enough life energy, his face turned red once again, and the blood in his body began to flow once more. However, the blood flowing in his meridians was no longer the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was now inside his inner world and floating around like a free child. It suddenly turned into a huge mass of blood mist and spread out in all directions at an astonishing rate, enveloping his entire inner world like radiation.
<br><br>
A gust of wind blew, and a fishy and sweet smell spread throughout every corner of his inner world.
<br><br>
Chapter 4141 A New Flesh World After the Evil God had left Zen, his inner world grew and prospered.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven implemented new rules to unite several human forces. All sorts of new forces flourished like sprouting bamboo shoots.
<br><br>
For most of the inner worlds, the more people and races there were, the more wars they would inevitably have. However, the new forces in Zen's inner world lived together in harmony, rarely entertaining any conflicts.
<br><br>
Now blood mist spread across the sky as its stench filled the entire inner world. The people were once again alarmed.
<br><br>
"This blood is a threatening sign!"
<br><br>
"What's happening to our world?"
<br><br>
"Is a disaster approaching us?"
<br><br>
As the people saw the blood mist covering the horizon, they were filled with indescribable agony.
<br><br>
They were facing imminent danger, but where could they escape? Splash! Splash! The blood mist formed from the ancestry-level bloodline spread to the edge of the inner world. It flowed to a tide merging with the chaotic sea.
<br><br>
From dark brown, the chaotic sea gradually changed into a bright red.
<br><br>
"Master Dale, what does the ancestry-level bloodline want?" Zen asked worriedly.
<br><br>
He knew that the ancestry-level bloodline had its consciousness and was never under his control. Even the Blood-controlling Method only allowed him to have an elementary control.
<br><br>
Now the ancestry-level bloodline was like a wild runaway horse galloping through his inner world. This made him nervous.
<br><br>
"How would I know?" answered Dale.
<br><br>
Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven glared at him as if they wanted to swallow him alive.
<br><br>
Dale couldn't stand their ferocious stares and hurriedly said, "Didn't I say a world of blood and flesh would be built?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at the sea of blood and nodded.
<br><br>
"The inner worlds are filled with all sorts of strange things, but I'm afraid that only Zen's inner world has such a scene."
<br><br>
After a few moments, Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Dale finally understood what the world of blood and flesh pertained to.
<br><br>
As the chaotic sea transformed into blood, several continents began to shake and rumble. They rose as flesh-like substances appeared from beneath them.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! The flesh pulsated, producing new growth that quickly connected to the thick continents.
<br><br>
While the people in Zen's inner world panicked, blood-red flesh popped out from the ground. It grew into a flesh tree in the blink of an eye, with suckers crawling on its surface.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! These suckers could reach several hundred feet and into humans' bodies.
<br><br>
Whoever was sucked would be stripped of flesh and blood, leaving an obliterated body.
<br><br>
Tens of millions of flesh trees bloomed on the continents, warning to suck all the creatures in the inner world.
<br><br>
"Run!"
<br><br>
Everyone fled frantically. The continents were swarmed with flesh trees with no way to escape.
<br><br>
Zen could allow the ancestry-level bloodline to transform his inner world, but he would never let it kill the creatures in such a cruel way.
<br><br>
He frowned and stretched out a hand as he tried to grab and raise it.
<br><br>
Rumble! The continents began to float under Zen's power.
<br><br>
The flesh trees grew from the flesh substances at the bottom of the continents. They couldn't be severed from those flesh substances. As the continents floated, the flesh trees were forcefully torn from the continents.
<br><br>
"Zen, your inner world will undergo a tremendous change. There's no need to pity these lives." Dale felt that Zen was being too kind.
<br><br>
Once Zen's inner world expanded, it would be multiple times larger and the creatures within it would also be much more powerful.
<br><br>
Zen was like a rich man who possessed a beggar's attitude—knowing how to cherish even just a handful of rice.
<br><br>
"No matter what change could happen, I don't want them to be devoured.
<br><br>
They are all living beings," Zen said with utmost concern.
<br><br>
He had developed his inner world carefully. The people inside were all created by him. They lived with their spouses and children, experienced joys and sorrows, and dealt with reunions and separations.
<br><br>
Zen wouldn't let them all be killed by the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
As the continents drifted in the air, the people were able to escape death.
<br><br>
Only the creator of this world could do that.
<br><br>
Those people knew that it was Zen who had saved their lives, so they all fell in worship with their heads toward the ground.
<br><br>
Although Zen hadn't appeared for a long time, the legend about him spread widely in this world.
<br><br>
"This is boring," Dale remarked as he shook his head.
<br><br>
But it was not that he felt heartless about what took place.
<br><br>
The things involved in the primitive land were too significant. He didn't like Zen to interfere with them using his strength.
<br><br>
However, there was really no way for Dale to change Zen's mind. He was the master of this world.
<br><br>
After the continents were lifted, more flesh substances formed at the bottom of the world.
<br><br>
As the number of flesh substances increased, the area of the blood sea began to rapidly decrease. Not long after, the blood sea had disappeared completely and the entire inner world was covered by the flesh substances.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! The flesh contracted like thousands of hearts beating simultaneously at the same speed.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline ceased taking further action as the inner world reached this point.
<br><br>
"Is it over?"
<br><br>
Zen's avatar descended from the sky and stepped on one of the pieces of flesh.
<br><br>
He had been omniscient within his inner world and there was nothing hidden from him.
<br><br>
Yet he knew nothing about the flesh substances. When he tried to sense them, a resistance force radiated from them.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and Dale also descended. "I don't think so.
<br><br>
The most critical thing hasn't happened yet," Dale said.
<br><br>
"Do you mean expansion?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," Dale replied with a nod.
<br><br>
For a primitive land, expansion was the priority. Zen's inner world was far too small.
<br><br>
"Will the world expand relying on these flesh substances?" Zen questioned Dale.
<br><br>
Dale didn't answer. He didn't know the answer either, but looking at the vast mass of flesh substances, he felt that the world ought to expand next.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! All the flesh substances began to beat faster. They appeared to be growing, squeezing unto each other more and more fiercely.
<br><br>
Five minutes later, Zen suddenly felt a crushing intense pain. It throbbed non-stop as if giving him a signal of his cinnabar field close to shattering.
<br><br>
Chapter 4142 Rebuilding The expansion of his cinnabar field caused some pain.
<br><br>
When it expanded, so did his inner world.
<br><br>
But naturally, the scale of their expansion differed.
<br><br>
His cinnabar field had only expanded half a finger's distance, while his inner world had expanded beyond a thousand miles.
<br><br>
The next second, his cinnabar field began shrinking. But his inner world did not follow—it only stopped expanding.
<br><br>
Following that, while his cinnabar field continued to expand, his inner world expanded over a thousand miles.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Zen's body seemed to have entered a subtle state.
<br><br>
With every second, his inner world was expanding a thousand miles.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, who guarded Zen from outside, took notice of his wondrous state. She then transformed into a strand of soul and drilled into his inner world—her clear eyes widened in surprise at the sight before her.
<br><br>
Previously, the continents occupied nearly seventy percent of space within Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
But now, all the continents floated in the sky, occupying less than ten percent of the inner world.
<br><br>
The primitive land had expanded so fast, the expansion not ceasing in the least.
<br><br>
Each time Zen's inner world expanded, some of the flesh substances at the bottom of the world disappeared, turning into blood-red meridians that extended toward the edge of the inner world.
<br><br>
Both Dale and the Primeval Lord of Heaven had already understood that the expansion of Zen's inner world was based on the flesh substances.
<br><br>
"The expansion of about a thousand miles will consume over a hundred masses of flesh," remarked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"To be exact, a hundred and three masses of flesh," Zen said in return.
<br><br>
"And the expansion will extend for a thousand and two hundred miles, to be exact. There are a total of fourteen million masses of flesh in my inner world."
<br><br>
At that number, the Snake Goddess' eyes widened. "How vast will Zen's inner world be?"
<br><br>
"It will be an inner world with a diameter of over a hundred million miles.
<br><br>
It must be countless times larger than it is now, but it's still far smaller than the Source World," Dale answered with a smile.
<br><br>
"At this rate, it will probably take several months to completely consume all of the flesh," remarked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Zen had also realized that the rate of expansion was rather slow. "It shouldn't have to take so long," he chimed in.
<br><br>
Gently turning his hand, he made a burning joss stick appear in his grip, emitting a curling fragrance.
<br><br>
Buzz! Simultaneously, a strange light enveloped him, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and Dale, along with the continents and the fairy palace above.
<br><br>
Once Zen changed the time flow rate of his inner world, everything began advancing rapidly.
<br><br>
The flesh substances disappeared in an instant as his inner world continued rapidly expanding.
<br><br>
When the joss stick in Zen's hand was completely burnt, the flesh substances beneath their feet finally disappeared, which were then replaced by a broad space. Its bottom was made up of meridians that were tens of millions of miles long.
<br><br>
Compared to such a space, the continents floating in the sky served as tiny building blocks.
<br><br>
"The world is so empty," Zen said.
<br><br>
"Zen has to create more lives?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"I don't know," Dale said in return, scratching his head.
<br><br>
"..."
<br><br>
Once again, the other three stared at him with fierce eyes.
<br><br>
There was nothing Dale could do but deliver his master's message.
<br><br>
"Let me try to build the world."
<br><br>
With Zen's omniscient power, building a creature-filled world was an easy feat.
<br><br>
Sea water was important to the inhabitants—he wanted to first fill his empty world with sea water.
<br><br>
In the past, he had already done it twice.
<br><br>
The first time was when he formed his Soul Sea, and the second was when the chaotic sea was created. Now, it was the third time.
<br><br>
But just as he was going to exercise his omnipotent power, his body stiffened slightly, stunned.
<br><br>
At that moment, the power that ruled everything in his inner world had disappeared! For several times, Zen tried waving his arms, getting flustered. "I… I'm not the master of this world?"
<br><br>
Everyone was supposed to be omniscient in their own inner worlds with everything under their control. Space, earth, water, time, and lives were no exception. Such was the most basic rule of the Grand World Cultivation Method.
<br><br>
Now, the invasion of the ancestry-level bloodline rendered Zen's omniscient power ineffective—he couldn't help but feel flustered.
<br><br>
"Strictly speaking, this world is constructed by the ancestry-level bloodline—it may not be obedient to you right now," said the Snake Goddess, pointing at the blood mist that had spread across the sky.
<br><br>
"The ancestry-level bloodline has once deprived you of control over your body. This can't be worse than that," remarked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Zen shrugged helplessly. "You're right."
<br><br>
As for how to deal with the huge inner world, all they could do was wait and see.
<br><br>
But at this very moment, the meridians at the bottom of the world began trembling as a white mist gushed out.
<br><br>
The moment it appeared, Zen's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's expressions shifted slightly.
<br><br>
The two felt the aura of the bloodline power simultaneously.
<br><br>
"This is Gonggong's bloodline power." Even the Snake Goddess noticed it.
<br><br>
"No." The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head. "His bloodline power is purer, but the aura in the white mist is far more complicated."
<br><br>
"In addition to the seven abilities in the creation quadrant, there are also four other abilities in the life quadrant," Zen said.
<br><br>
As he obtained the ancestry-level bloodline, he managed to analyze the nature of any kind of energy. Such an analytic ability was given by the ancestry-level bloodline. Later on, it took the ability back.
<br><br>
But for some reason, in his inner world, Zen had regained the analytic ability.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Boundless white mist covered the world. It continued piling up and rising slowly, approaching Zen and the rest.
<br><br>
As the white mist rose into the sky, it shifted into clouds. Once they were thick enough, they would form a heavy rain.
<br><br>
Splash! It began to rain in the inner world. This time, a real sea was finally formed within Zen's body, replacing the former chaotic sea.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! A bolt of lightning shot out from the blood mist, streaking through the sky and sinking right into the sea.
<br><br>
"The lightning contains the sixteen abilities of the destruction quadrant,"
<br><br>
Zen remarked in astonishment.
<br><br>
Rumble! High mountains in the sea rose continuously, containing two abilities of the creation quadrant.
<br><br>
Suddenly, one of the mountains split apart, allowing lava to flow from it.
<br><br>
The lava seemed to be emitting the aura of the bloodline power as well.
<br><br>
Enlightenment then struck Zen at that moment.
<br><br>
The power of the ancestry-level bloodline was everywhere in this newly constructed inner world.
<br><br>
If the inner world was completed, wouldn't it be easy for him to obtain the power within? Chapter 4143 The Only Shelter As things escalated to this point, realization dawned on the faces of Dale, the Snake Goddess, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven as well.
<br><br>
It turned out that Zen had cultivated the Soul Sea Realm anew.
<br><br>
Once a warrior had reached the Soul Sea Realm, their life vitality became liquefied and formed a Soul Sea. Afterward, the sea of life vitality in their inner world would regularly provide life vitality for the warrior.
<br><br>
After all, even if one had mastered the Godly Ways, they still used the life vitality in essence.
<br><br>
Currently, the power Zen had used to reconstruct his inner world directly came from the ancestry-level bloodline. The difference was self-evident.
<br><br>
For instance, the world created by using life vitality was secondary in one's body.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the world created by using chaotic energy was chaos.
<br><br>
Therefore, was the world created using the ancestry-level bloodline the Abstruse Energy World? The Primeval Lord of Heaven's heart skipped a beat at the thought, and he quietly glanced at Dale beside him.
<br><br>
Dale acted like he was only a messenger and didn't know anything else, but was that really the case? However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had no idea what time and space in the Abstruse Energy World were like. The creation of the world before his eyes was still fresh in his mind, which contradicted his assumption.
<br><br>
Thus, he ignored his confusion and did not say anything.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen's inner world evolved at an even faster speed.
<br><br>
Earth continued to emerge from the sea, and volcanoes erupted destructive hot lava.
<br><br>
The seawater extinguished the lava that came to destroy everything, then an area in the shape of a coiled snake was formed. Lastly, life began to take shape in the place.
<br><br>
It was a kind of bright green seaweed, and everyone was sure those were just plants.
<br><br>
Yet, the thumb-sized plants quickly grew wings that were as thin as a cicada's and flew away.
<br><br>
Then, hundreds of millions of those "seaweed creatures" flew up the sky towards the continents that Zen had created before.
<br><br>
From afar, the mass of seaweed creatures looked like an enormous green hurricane.
<br><br>
"What do they want to do?" the Snake Goddess said worriedly.
<br><br>
"Let's go and have a look!" Zen said seriously.
<br><br>
Since he had lost the ability to know everything in his inner world, he could not move freely as before. He could not appear anywhere in his inner world with just a thought like he previously did.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the restrictive force of the Space Law in this world was not strong, so they could still teleport at will.
<br><br>
A few moments later, Zen, the Snake Goddess, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Dale arrived at the edge of the continents.
<br><br>
The green seaweed creatures swarmed the continents, then attacked the creatures that lived there! Although the seaweed creatures were small, they were highly poisonous.
<br><br>
All the creatures that they touched died in an instant! "These green seaweeds... They are attacking the world I created!"
<br><br>
Zen's face darkened at the sight of the seaweed creatures that swarmed the continents like locusts.
<br><br>
He had painstakingly built and developed these continents, and he would never allow anyone to destroy them, especially when his inner world had just gotten rebuilt. How could he allow these seaweed creatures to slaughter the living beings that lived on them? "We have to stop these seaweeds!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
As he had lost the almighty power in his inner world, it was not easy to remove all of the green seaweeds. Only the other three who tagged along could help him.
<br><br>
"Clean them up."
<br><br>
"I'll activate the enchanted barrier!"
<br><br>
"These seaweed creatures are quite weak, and they only came in large numbers. It's not a big deal to finish them..."
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Dale were about to make a move, Zen suddenly waved his hands and said, "No need.
<br><br>
Let me deal with them!"
<br><br>
Then, he gently raised his hand.
<br><br>
A strong gust of wind blew across the continents, which stirred the endless sand into the air.
<br><br>
"Kill them all!"
<br><br>
With a wave of his hand, the sand in the sky changed course and flew towards the seaweed creatures.
<br><br>
Each grain of sand pierced through a seaweed creature, and not long after, the numerous grains of sand had silently punctured millions of seaweed creatures.
<br><br>
Only the master of the inner world could perform such a precise attack.
<br><br>
When Zen returned to the continents, he found his omniscient abilities had recovered.
<br><br>
Not long after, the sand had completely wiped out all the seaweeds that surrounded the continents.
<br><br>
However, their relief was short-lived: the seaweeds kept emerging from the seawater and swarmed the continents again. Furthermore, the number of seaweed now multiplied up to a hundred times more than that of the previous batch! "No matter what reason you have to attack my world, if you don't stop, I will never forgive you!" Zen screamed as he looked up at the sky in despair.
<br><br>
In many cases, he was no match for the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
But now that he had regained his omniscient and omnipotent powers, he could now compete against it.
<br><br>
Once he finished speaking, a faint sound came from the red mist that shrouded the sky.
<br><br>
He listened carefully and vaguely heard a burst of laughter, like a group of cats screaming in the middle of the night.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the strange screams disappeared, and the seaweed creatures seemed to have lost their souls. They all fell into the sea, and the primitive land stopped attacking.
<br><br>
"It appears that it will take some time for us to coexist with each other peacefully," Zen said in a solemn voice.
<br><br>
It was true that he was still the master of this world, but his authority was only limited to these continents.
<br><br>
"Your situation now is out of the ordinary. You can only explore slowly by yourself, but in the end, you should be able to find a way to coexist with the ancestry-level bloodline," the Primeval Lord of Heaven assured him.
<br><br>
As for Dale, he glanced at the boundless ocean and thought for a moment.
<br><br>
"The primitive land has now expanded to this size. Zen, can you check the area outside the primitive land?" he asked.
<br><br>
"The area outside the primitive land..." Zen arched his eyebrows and said, "Everyone, please follow me!"
<br><br>
He then created another avatar in his inner world to prevent the ancestrylevel bloodline from attacking the continents again.
<br><br>
There was an avatar that guarded the place, and another avatar followed the other three to the edge of the primitive land.
<br><br>
There was a time when over a thousand Sanskrit words bounded his inner world, but those had disappeared and were replaced by "walls" woven from the meridians. If one looked closer, they would see the blood that rapidly flowed within the walls.
<br><br>
"The chaos should be outside the wall," Dale confirmed.
<br><br>
"Well, that's a problem. How can we observe the outside world then?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"Zen, try to communicate with the ancestry-level bloodline again and ask it to let us out..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven suggested.
<br><br>
Before he could finish speaking, Zen snorted coldly and placed his palms on the wall. He felt the wall's temperature.
<br><br>
Then, without saying anything, he clawed at the wall and tore it down, which caused a huge crack! As a result, the chaotic energy surged and flowed straight into the crack.
<br><br>
Upon seeing his reckless behavior, Dale, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess all smiled helplessly.
<br><br>
The primitive land and its master did not have a harmonious relationship.
<br><br>
Most areas in the chaos were even empty and were devoid of life.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, they went out through the crack and looked around.
<br><br>
There was still nothing else in sight, except for the slowly drifting chaos clouds.
<br><br>
"Zen, can you sense the location of the primitive land?" asked Dale.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head, and replied, "No."
<br><br>
When his inner world had just been built, he could sense its location—but after that, he could not locate it anymore.
<br><br>
"You have to find a way to locate it. The primitive land will be your only shelter," Dale said in a deathly serious tone.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Its entire northern area was the base of the Snake Spirit Sect, while the central area was the most critical.
<br><br>
It was not easy to get there.
<br><br>
"Why do you want to go to the center of the Jade Pure Realm?" Dale asked in confusion.
<br><br>
For him, Zen should have focused on developing his primitive land instead of thinking about other things.
<br><br>
"Someone asked me to," said Zen.
<br><br>
"Who? The Monkey Spirit King?" asked Dale.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King didn't know anything. He couldn't even give any useful advice at all.
<br><br>
"Master Dale, you have also entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, right? Do you know who built it?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"The brush-wielder," Dale answered quickly.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before he was introduced to this name. After his master traveled through the main world, he found out about all the passageways to the secondary worlds being controlled by the brush-wielders.
<br><br>
The brush-wielders knew many secrets. Once, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had secretly supported a talented creature in Stage Thirty-two on the Other Shore. He helped him enter the Eternal Scroll Painting with a subtle motive–he wanted to contact the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
The creature successfully passed through the Eternal Scroll Painting and reached the Eternal Realm, but he didn't see the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
When the creature failed, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord decided to give up his plan.
<br><br>
Dale was filled with excitement as Zen mentioned the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
"How about you? Have you seen him before?" he wondered.
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen nodded. "He is the one who asked me to go to the center of the Jade Pure Realm."
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, Dale frowned. "That was all he said?" His tone changed as if he was expecting more.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen replied. "Should there be anything else?" he asked while scratching his head.
<br><br>
The brush-wielder did not reveal too much information. Even the conflicts in the Four Spirits Sect were pieced together by Zen later.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!" Dale sneered. "It seems that the brush-wielder has no idea. We can't enter the center area now. Our efforts will only be in vain even if we overcome many obstacles in entering it."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"My master has been there," said Dale.
<br><br>
During the long war between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect, it was not only the Snake Spirit Sect that always had an advantage.
<br><br>
There were several times that the Bird Masters almost reached the Heavenly Square City.
<br><br>
Their goals were completely different from the Snake Masters'. Their objective was not to occupy the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Instead, they all had a strong desire for destruction. They aimed to stop everything so they could annihilate the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had no chance to leave the bubbles.
<br><br>
However, when the Bird Spirit Sect suppressed the Snake Spirit Sect, an opportunity presented. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord successfully broke into the center of the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
"Did the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord find anything?" Zen asked eagerly.
<br><br>
Dale glanced at him and replied, "A huge altar was buried there. My master tried his best to enter, but a door stopped him."
<br><br>
"A door?"
<br><br>
Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at each other.
<br><br>
"There was a sound behind the door. A strange song, as if someone was whispering in a soft voice," said Dale.
<br><br>
"It is Sanskrit," said Zen.
<br><br>
Dale nodded. "It was a pity that my master couldn't understand Sanskrit.
<br><br>
Aside from the sound being nearly inaudible, he didn't know what it was about."
<br><br>
Among the creatures in the chaos, only Zen and his son could communicate in Sanskrit.
<br><br>
Geoffrey could even freely travel within the main world.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen relied on the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher Sanskrit quickly.
<br><br>
Although the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had traveled through the main world, it was not an ordinary tour. Elder Xue created a huge illusion for him. The illusion showed him everything about the Four Spirits Sect, yet he was still unable to understand Sanskrit.
<br><br>
"My master tried every means but still failed to open the door," Dale said regretfully. Only a few doors could block the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Later, my master speculated that the one behind the door was probably the Human Spirit King, Kincaid," said Dale with a suspicious face.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately," he sighed, "we can't find the key."
<br><br>
"I have that key," Zen blurted out.
<br><br>
"What?" Dale said, astonished.
<br><br>
"I said I have the key," Zen repeated seriously.
<br><br>
He opened the Sumeru Space and took out a key then handed it to Dale.
<br><br>
The key looked unremarkable. It didn't even appear to be anything special.
<br><br>
After running his fingers through the key in his hand, Dale stared at Zen in disbelief. He felt as if he was being fooled.
<br><br>
"It's true. You can ask the Primeval Lord of Heaven if you don't believe me. I got it from the cabin on top of the Soul City," Zen said convincingly.
<br><br>
Dale turned to look at the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "It's absolutely true,"
<br><br>
the latter confirmed.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven never lied. Dale took a deep breath and headed to leave. "I'll go report it to my master now!"
<br><br>
Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven wanted to go to the Jade Pure Realm with Dale, but he rejected them. He insisted on going alone.
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect were fighting fiercely in the Jade Pure Realm. It was a complicated situation.
<br><br>
Dale relied on his bloodline talent to quietly pass through the Jade Pure Realm. If he took Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven with him, they would be exposed.
<br><br>
They had to wait for the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord to make a decision.
<br><br>
Not long after Dale left, a visitor arrived in the Night View Island.
<br><br>
It was the Wing King followed by one hundred and ninety-nine Treacherous Beings swarming towards the land.
<br><br>
These Treacherous Beings were the human spirits living on the Whining Road. They were also known as the world builders.
<br><br>
When Zen woke Campbell up, he had cleared the Pure Sky Platform of trouble and made it easier for the other human spirits to awaken.
<br><br>
At that time, he had to hurry to the Night View Island so he entrusted the challenge to the Wing King.
<br><br>
The Wing King thought it was easy in the beginning. As long as the human spirits possessed other creatures, they could run to the Pure Sky Platform by themselves. The Wing King only needed to carefully follow them all the way and when they woke up, he would tell them the truth.
<br><br>
But the problem was the human spirits' wishes were different. The wishes of some of them were not on the Pure Sky Platform, so the Wing King and the awakened human spirits had to spend more time helping others wake up.
<br><br>
For the past years, the two hundred human spirits had been living in a daze.
<br><br>
They felt indescribable emotions as they met again in the Night View Island.
<br><br>
After Campbell, the first human spirit to awaken, told them about the situation of the Four Spirits Sect and the chaos, they were furious and swore to avenge the Human Spirit Sect and Kincaid.
<br><br>
Dozens of them were already positioned, preparing to rush out.
<br><br>
"You think you're stronger than the Monkey Spirit King? Even the Monkey Spirit King hasn't taken any action. Are you really going to launch an attack now?" Zen stopped the human spirits with his voice resonating from his inner world.
<br><br>
Although his inner world had transformed, the continents had been completely preserved.
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization remained, helping Zen communicate in Sanskrit.
<br><br>
The human spirits were just hostility-level Treacherous Beings. They were proficient in building the secondary worlds, but they were weak.
<br><br>
Dealing with them might be difficult because they wouldn't die, but the Light of Annihilation emitted from a Holy Stone was enough to shatter their souls.
<br><br>
Chapter 4146 Teeth The human spirits had calmed down after hearing the words directly from Zen.
<br><br>
Plotting revenge against the Snake Spirit Sect was like digging their own graves. It was a useless and self-destructive plan.
<br><br>
"We understand. But what else can we do?" one of the human spirits chimed in.
<br><br>
This human spirit's name was Powell. He was regarded as the leader of this group of world builders. Campbell and all the other human spirits were completely obedient and loyal to him.
<br><br>
"Your understanding of the chaos is deeper than ours. We need your help if we ought to find out where the Human Spirit King is," Zen humbly replied.
<br><br>
"And why should we believe in you human beings? How can we trust you?" Powell stared at Zen. There was a look of utter skepticism in his face.
<br><br>
These world builders created the human beings. It was because of them that Zen and the others existed.
<br><br>
Powell considered human beings like Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven as mere carvings of the human spirits. Therefore, how could the human beings of the secondary world be the ones to lead the human spirits of the main world? This was quite unthinkable to them.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, Campbell and the others had the exact same thoughts.
<br><br>
They couldn't quite accept that notion.
<br><br>
Because they were their creators, it was normal for the human spirits to think that they were superior to human beings.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Zen didn't care about Powell's doubts and concerns. He just smiled gently and said, "Because the Monkey Spirit King trusts me."
<br><br>
With that, Powell and the other human spirits fell silent. They could not argue with that.
<br><br>
In actuality, the world builders didn't have a good position in the Four Spirits Sect. They weren't even permitted to enter the Ten Directions House.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King chose to put his trust on Zen. This proved to be the biggest support in Zen's favor. After that conversation, the world builders had temporarily settled down on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
In the past few days, Judson had tirelessly remolded the Pear Hill. He worked on it day and night.
<br><br>
He had already dug out about one-third of the west side of the entire Pear Hill. The stones he unearthed had been turned into metals using the force of truth. In turn, these metals were placed in a certain pattern. They formed an enormous circular structure that was thousands of miles in length.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Kendrick had set up an array upon the huge structure.
<br><br>
"The array has already been set up. It can be activated at any point in time," Kendrick said to Zen impassively.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and took out the mother butterfly given to him by the real Snake Goddess. Slowly, he began to sense the location of the young butterflies.
<br><br>
One of these young butterflies was attached to the primitive land.
<br><br>
Therefore, he would be able to feel the primitive land's location using the mother butterfly. According to the real Snake Goddess, this would work no matter how far away he was.
<br><br>
He closed his eyes and infused his consciousness into the mother butterfly. Afterwards, he felt a faint existence deep in his heart. Following where it led, he found the location of that specific butterfly.
<br><br>
He opened his eyes and said, "Northwest! Towards that direction!"
<br><br>
Zen immediately pointed at the distance.
<br><br>
"Change the direction," Kendrick conveyed to Judson emotionlessly.
<br><br>
There was a deep rumbling sound as Judson began the adjustment of the structure.
<br><br>
The enormous circular structure leaned against the side of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Judson had made a huge turntable. Under his careful manipulation, the turntable adjusted the direction of the huge structure.
<br><br>
"Okay! Go!" Judson motioned to them.
<br><br>
Seeing his signal, Kendrick and Gerald released the truth power simultaneously.
<br><br>
Aside from the two Chaos Ancient Gods, the Eternal Realm warriors and the Holy Soul Realm warriors also had contributions. Each one of them released their blood power.
<br><br>
In a short amount of time, massive amounts of energy began to accumulate in the west of the Pear Hill. This energy was channeled into a tall tower. And at its top, sat a young girl named Yan.
<br><br>
She had already started to utilize the function of the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
As soon as the violent and gentle energy accumulated inside the Energy Shaft, she immediately transformed it.
<br><br>
All the energy absorbed by the Energy Shaft poured intensely into the array upon the enormous rounded structure.
<br><br>
As the massive amount of energy flowed into the array, it emitted a loud buzzing sound.
<br><br>
Soon after, the entire array began to flash. A bright and blinding light shot out of it.
<br><br>
It exerted a mighty push onto the enormous circular structure.
<br><br>
Subsequently, the force was evenly distributed to the entire Pear Hill to help speed up its movement.
<br><br>
Whoosh... Whoosh...
<br><br>
Gradually, the Pear Hill began to change its direction.
<br><br>
This colossal structure left a long trace in the empty chaos. After adjusting its course, it began to move at such an extraordinary speed towards the northwest of the chaos.
<br><br>
As the Pear Hill set off its new course, Zen sighed. "It's a pity we didn't meet the Sky Rending Rhinoceros. If we just go directly through its space cave, I'm sure we can save a lot of time..."
<br><br>
Zen had once traveled through the space cave created by the Sky Rending Rhinoceros. During that time, he was headed to the Source World from the divine land. The space cave was a shortcut to the Source World.
<br><br>
Kendrick was standing next to Zen the whole time. When he heard this, he laughed softly. "It's quite impossible for the Pear Hill to pass through the space cave made by the Sky Rending Rhinoceros. If Othniel was still alive, we could have gone through the space cave he made."
<br><br>
The Sky Rending Rhinoceros was one of the top ten beasts of the chaos.
<br><br>
Its strength was merely comparable to that of an Eternal Realm warrior.
<br><br>
Naturally, the Chaos Ancient Gods didn't take it seriously.
<br><br>
"Stop worrying. With the help of the array and Yan's Energy Shaft, the Pear Hill can move at an extremely high speed. Let's just wait and see..."
<br><br>
Judson chimed in as he heard them talking. He had absolute confidence in their abilities.
<br><br>
Zen smiled and agreed. "With the help of three Chaos Ancient Gods, the human race is truly lucky."
<br><br>
The Pear Hill's speed was steadily accelerating.
<br><br>
Right now, there was an immense distance between the Source World and the Pear Hill. The Source World actually looked like a full moon up in the sky.
<br><br>
The hundreds of millions of human beings and the members of the Snake Goddess race on the Pear Hill had been extremely terrified in the past few days. Never in their lives did they imagine that the Pear Hill would leave the Source World and carry them to an unknown place. They had no idea of what kind of fate awaited them in the days to come.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen's inner world was still evolving at breakneck speed. All he could do was to watch as it developed.
<br><br>
Every time a monstrous tsunami occurred, a large patch of land would emerge from the sea.
<br><br>
In the beginning, the land only appeared gradually and occupied a very small part of the sea. Not long after, more volcanoes at the bottom of the sea began to erupt. This terrifying and catastrophic force would cause a monstrous tsunami.
<br><br>
Soon enough, more patches of land sprang up like mushrooms after rain.
<br><br>
These lands began to merge with each other and formed large continents.
<br><br>
After a while, different kinds of plants began to appear. One moment, it was still a bare continent. The next, it had turned into a lush grassland.
<br><br>
The time flow rate was so fast that it made people feel suffocated.
<br><br>
The inner world's development trend in the past revealed that all sorts of creatures would appear after the plants. These creatures would slowly obtain intelligence and establish tribes. Afterwards, these tribes would turn into cities. These cities would transform into great forces, empires, and even civilizations.
<br><br>
Zen was not allowed to interfere with the development of the primitive land. Therefore, he could only watch in silence as it evolved.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the situation did not develop as Zen imagined. There were so many things that didn't go according to his plan.
<br><br>
Some kind of bamboo shoot-shaped plants grew on these continents. After these plants were born, they began to devour other plants frenziedly. They started growing ceaselessly.
<br><br>
Therefore, the other plants on the continents merely became food for the bamboo shoot-shaped plants.
<br><br>
After a short amount of time, all of the plants on the continents were devoured by these predatory plants. These plants also quickly grew from dozens of feet to thousands of miles in height and extended all the way to the edge of the primitive land! Zen had seen some gigantic plants in the Source World. Some intelligent plants were even able to reach the Other Shore Realm. However, none of them could compare to these bamboo shoot-shaped plants.
<br><br>
As these insatiable plants became thousands of miles tall and hundreds of miles in diameter, they intersected and gathered at the edge of the primitive land.
<br><br>
Zen frowned as he observed them for a while. His pupils narrowed slightly, and one word popped into his mind.
<br><br>
"Teeth?" This was what he imagined they were.
<br><br>
If he imagined the primitive land as the head of a giant beast, then these bamboo shoot-shaped plants were the teeth of this beast.
<br><br>
Chapter 4147 Downgrade As Zen arrived at the edge of the primitive land, he approached the huge plants which resembled bamboo shoots with great caution.
<br><br>
When these plants reached their current size, their cyan color faded and was replaced by a golden sheen. They appeared very sturdy and strong.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to move closer, the plants in the shape of bamboo shoots that had intertwined to resemble dog teeth suddenly separated and began to snap at Zen within a few seconds.
<br><br>
Zen was not prepared and barely had any time to dodge. His whole body was bitten, ground, and chewed to pieces by the teeth.
<br><br>
Luckily for him, it was just an avatar.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
On the continent at the center of the primitive land, Zen's avatar condensed again. He appeared angry and disgraced.
<br><br>
In the past, he had always had complete control over his inner world though it was still quite small.
<br><br>
Now that it had expanded, he couldn't believe that he was bound to it instead of the other way around.
<br><br>
"Do you want to fight with me?" Zen challenged, looking into the blood mist in the sky.
<br><br>
Just then, a thick cloud of blood mist floated in the air above him like an animal taunting its prey.
<br><br>
"Then come on!" Zen's said coldly.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, he had an idea.
<br><br>
The continents floated in the sky had linked to one another.
<br><br>
As long as he remained on these continents, Zen was omniscient. He had to use this to his advantage.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
As the continents connected, Zen stretched out his hand and grabbed in the air.
<br><br>
The newly combined continent rose and eventually, reached the highest point of the primitive land.
<br><br>
Before Zen knew it, the blood mist that came from the ancestry-level bloodline hovered right above his head.
<br><br>
Zen slowly stretched out his hand and immersed it in the blood mist, "Seize it!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
A powerful storm formed at the center of Zen's hand.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
With one toss, the storm swept up and with astonishing speed, sucked the floating blood mist within seconds.
<br><br>
"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline wouldn't go down without a fight.
<br><br>
It morphed into blood red winged bugs in an attempt to escape the storm.
<br><br>
However, a storm created by the all-powerful creator could not be resisted. This was the general rule of any inner world.
<br><br>
Though this was a special case as the primitive land was wrapped around the inner world, the rule still applied within the range of the continent.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Eventually, as a large amount of the blood mist was sucked into the storm, the storm became tinted with red.
<br><br>
On that note, the ancestry-level bloodline counterattacked.
<br><br>
The plants in the shape of bamboo shoots at the edge of the primitive land turned and pierced towards the continent. All of a sudden, thousands of stalagmites sprouted from the bottom of the primitive land and shot straight up into the sky! If no one put a stop to the plants and stalagmites, it would only be a matter of minutes until the entire continent would be smashed into pieces.
<br><br>
However, just as they approached the continent, Zen's eyes flashed and an invisible space wall appeared at the edge of the continent.
<br><br>
His almighty abilities made the space wall indestructible.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
The plants in the shape of bamboo shoots rushed towards the space wall but could not penetrate it.
<br><br>
The stalagmites that grew from the ground met the space wall and shattered! "Though you are powerful, this is my inner world. I am still in charge here!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
The storm that was once a small ball in Zen's hand spread out and covered more areas. He controlled the continent to move in the primitive land as it absorbed all the ancestry-level bloodline it could find.
<br><br>
Drip, drip, drip...
<br><br>
Once the blood mist was completely sucked into the storm, it returned to Zen's palm and became drops of viscous blood.
<br><br>
Before, Zen could do nothing to the ancestry-level bloodline. When the bloodline was driven mad, it took control of Zen's body without hesitation.
<br><br>
Now that Zen brought the ancestry-level bloodline into his inner world, the tables had turned.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline that gathered into a ball formed into a bloody human. It reached out and grabbed Zen's chest.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
The hand grasped Zen's chest and turned into threads that drilled through Zen's body. He was sliced into a thousand miniscule pieces.
<br><br>
It was a good thing that this was only Zen's avatar. Within a moment, another avatar appeared and grinned at the "bloody man".
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
The bloody man showed no mercy. He raised his hand, gripped Zen, and began to slice through the avatar once again.
<br><br>
Not long after, Zen's third avatar appeared. He decided to go with a different approach. "We should sit down and have a good talk."
<br><br>
He had a feeling if he'd attacked, the same thing would have happened again. When Zen spoke calmly, the bloody man calmed down. He did not attack Zen again, but he did not respond either.
<br><br>
Zen let out a huge sigh of relief.
<br><br>
Ever since he fused with the ancestry-level bloodline, Zen exerted much effort to communicate with it. However, the ancestry-level bloodline always ignored him and acted on its own thoughts.
<br><br>
Now, the bloodline no longer resisted his communication.
<br><br>
Zen raised his hand and two chairs appeared before them. He gestured for the man to sit before he made his way to his own chair.
<br><br>
The bloody man silently looked at Zen and sat down. The moment he sat down, he mimicked Zen's body but was still made up of blood.
<br><br>
"If it weren't for the primitive land, you'd be no match for me," the bloody man spoke out. Not only did he mimic Zen's body, but his voice, too.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline could analyze all kinds of energy and deal with any bloodline power, no matter how strong they were.
<br><br>
Now that it was connected to the primitive land, it became bound to the rules. This was the main reason Zen could take it back when it was merely blood mist. If not for the primitive land, even if Zen were ten times stronger than he was now, he wouldn't have been able to do anything to the bloodline.
<br><br>
"Ah, so you could talk even before? Why did you keep silent all the time?" Zen asked with smile.
<br><br>
Spiritual creatures could gain extraordinary wisdom after they lived a long time. The ancestry-level bloodline was no exception to this.
<br><br>
"Because I had to observe you well," the bloody man said, emotionless.
<br><br>
"Observe me for what?" Zen raised an eyebrow.
<br><br>
"To see if you are trustworthy," the bloody man nodded.
<br><br>
After the ancestry-level bloodline was brought back by the Bird Spirit King Sheehan, it had been trapped in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
During those years, the Four Spirits Sect kept exploiting its power.
<br><br>
It had no clue where it came from nor whom it belonged to. The bloodline spent its life aimlessly.
<br><br>
When it decided Zen was an excellent host, it wasted no time and immediately integrated with him.
<br><br>
As Zen carried the ancestry-level bloodline, the bloodline reconstructed Zen.
<br><br>
"You have become a part of me. Don't I deserve your trust?" Zen said welcomingly.
<br><br>
The bloody man coldly glanced up at Zen and looked back down. "In a world that has been downgraded, no one could be trusted. Not even you..."
<br><br>
"Downgraded?" Zen shook his head in confusion, "What do you mean?"
<br><br>
The bloody man sighed and continued to explain, "If a creature in the main world becomes a creature in the chaos, it has been downgraded.
<br><br>
After the Monkey Masters died, they became Treacherous Beings. That, is a kind of downgrade."
<br><br>
Chapter 4148 The Origin Of The World Upon hearing the blood man's explanation, Zen soon understood. He smiled and paraphrased, "So, all the creatures of the main world have been downgraded..."
<br><br>
All members from the Four Spirits Sect had perished in the chaos, and they had all been transformed into Treacherous Beings. In theory, they had all been downgraded to creatures of the chaos.
<br><br>
The blood man stared disdainfully at Zen as he continued to clarify, "It's not just the creatures that have been downgraded, but also the entire main world."
<br><br>
"What?!" Zen was almost dumbstruck. "The entire main world has been downgraded? How is that even possible?"
<br><br>
"Why would it be impossible?" The blood man added in a nonchalant voice, "The chaos emerged from the downgrade of the main world. The so-called world builders knew the method of downgrade, and they unfolded a portion of the main world. That was how they created secondary worlds."
<br><br>
"They unfolded a portion of the main world..." Zen's eyes were like saucers with astonishment.
<br><br>
Campbell had never made any mention of such things to him before.
<br><br>
He was only aware that the world builders were responsible for constructing secondary worlds and extracting energies from the secondary worlds through the four pillars.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, they didn't know that once the downgrade had begun, there would be no turning back. Sooner or later, the entire main world would be downgraded," the blood man explained.
<br><br>
"Why are you so confident of these things?" Zen queried.
<br><br>
Ziya had been in the Abstruse Energy World for a very long time, and Geoffrey could adapt to the environment of the main world. Moreover, Zen knew there were still creatures living within the main world, such as Pompeo's kin.
<br><br>
The blood man leaned closer to Zen and whispered with a smile, "Because the main world was also birthed from downgrade. The entire main world is an unfolded section from a higher-level world..."
<br><br>
This unexpected information struck Zen silent.
<br><br>
For a moment, he was utterly speechless.
<br><br>
The main world was already vastly beyond his comprehension. What could a world at a higher level than the main world be? The gears in his mind were spinning as he tried to imagine this! The blood man had already anticipated Zen's reaction. He rocked back in his chair and explained in a lazy voice, "In fact, you've already heard of that higher-level world. It's known as the Deep Space among the Four Spirits Sect."
<br><br>
"You came from the Deep Space."
<br><br>
Zen exclaimed as realization flared in his mind.
<br><br>
He had read about the Deep Space in the stone tablets of the Monkey Spirit Sect, and he memorized the most relevant information pretty well.
<br><br>
Among the Four Spirits Sect, the Deep Space was seen as the origin of everything. For instance, the ancestry-level bloodline also originated from the Deep Space.
<br><br>
"You're right." The blood man nodded his head sagely. "The Deep Space is what the Four Spirits Sect named it. In truth, it is called the Stellar World, and it is a fifth-grade world. A long time ago, a part of the Stellar World was downgraded, and it became the so-called main world. The main world is actually called the Grand Lower World."
<br><br>
"That means our world..."
<br><br>
Before Zen could finish speaking, the blood man answered his unspoken question, "It is a third-grade world, the Lower Extreme World. It's a world of energy diversification. Every time a world is downgraded, different kinds of its energy diversify and split up. A sixth-grade world has eightysix kinds of energy. A fifth-grade world has one hundred and forty kinds, and a fourth-grade world has three hundred and seventy-three kinds..."
<br><br>
Three hundred and seventy-three... Zen knew this number intimately. That was the exact number of all the abilities contained in the ancestry-level bloodline's four quadrants.
<br><br>
"What about a third-grade world? Could it be—" Zen was thinking of another number.
<br><br>
"Three thousand and one," the blood man said, instantly seeing where Zen's mind was going. "There are a total of three thousand and one types of energy in this world."
<br><br>
Zen stared straight at the blood man and sensed the vigor of the bloodline power surging throughout his body. He couldn't restrain himself and remarked with pity, "Although the energy has varied greatly, their power became weakened at the same time."
<br><br>
The power of the Godly Ways could never match up to the power of the bloodlines that originated from the ancestry-level bloodline. In fact, they couldn't even hold a candle to the Other Shore Tokens, let alone the bloodlines. The only exception had been the powerful Ways-blending Energy that emerged when the Evil God had merged all of the Godly Ways together.
<br><br>
"There is a heavy cost involved in downgrade," the blood man continued.
<br><br>
"Then why would the Four Spirits Sect have chosen to downgrade their world?" Zen blurted out in confusion.
<br><br>
"They were deceived," the blood man simply stated.
<br><br>
"What?!" Zen was startled. He would never have seen this answer coming.
<br><br>
"The entire Four Spirits Sect has been lied to. Downgrade is a highly dangerous act," the blood man said.
<br><br>
"What danger does it involve?" Zen's interest was burning with curiosity now.
<br><br>
Even though the energy had been greatly weakened, everyone seemed to live and go about their business.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were now considered to be indestructible.
<br><br>
The blood man once again looked down at Zen with an aloof gaze as he said, "Since a world can be downgraded from the fifth grade to the fourth grade, and from the fourth grade to the third grade, then it's possible that it can also be further downgraded from the third grade, becoming a secondgrade world."
<br><br>
"A second-grade world..." Zen felt a sense of foreboding fill him, and his face darkened.
<br><br>
"You don't need me to paint you a picture. You have visited similar worlds," the blood man explained.
<br><br>
"The Eternal Scroll Painting," Zen confidently replied.
<br><br>
"Yes," the blood man grimly nodded.
<br><br>
The strange experience in the Eternal Scroll Painting had left a grim impression on Zen. He had been completely transformed into a twodimensional figure like a painting, and moving had been a task of great difficulty.
<br><br>
"You were not completely downgraded when you turned into a part of the Eternal Scroll Painting. You could still escape from the painting and observe everything around you. Once the world is completely downgraded, all you would see will be lines of different lengths, and you wouldn't be able to distinguish one thing from the next..." the blood man explained. "The types of energy will increase, becoming less mighty, from three thousand and one to eight hundred and thirty thousand."
<br><br>
Zen tried to envision the second-grade world as described by the blood man, and he couldn't help but shudder at the thought.
<br><br>
Although there would be many more kinds of energy, one would only be able to see lines there! What a boring world it would be? "Everything has been hazy since I left the Deep Space. Many of my past memories about the Deep Space are now lost. I can't even recall who I was or where I came from, but I still remember my one true mission, which is to prevent the world from being downgraded," the blood man said resolutely.
<br><br>
"However, the downgrade has already begun, and the entire Four Spirits Sect has become involved. I couldn't tell who is really behind the downgrade, so I had to watch everything in silence.
<br><br>
I couldn't trust you then because you might also be the downgrader."
<br><br>
The "Zen" transformed from the ancestry-level bloodline became pensive and gazed thoughtfully ahead. From where he stood, no one was trustworthy, including Zen.
<br><br>
Strictly speaking, world builders like Campbell could be seen as enemies of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"How could I be the downgrader?" Zen rolled his eyes at the blood man.
<br><br>
"Believe me, it must be the Snake Spirit King. After all, he deceived the three other kings into entering the chaos and killed them all."
<br><br>
"The Snake Spirit King is the most probable suspect, but the Bird Spirit King also holds a dubious distinction and so does the missing Human Spirit King..." The blood man's face became grave as he said, "I can offer you all my help, but you have to assist me by finding and killing the downgrader, even if that person is Kincaid, the Human Spirit King."
<br><br>
Zen hesitated for a brief moment, but the determination burned in his eyes.
<br><br>
He didn't know why the world had been downgraded, but he knew without any doubt that if it continued like this, everyone would be doomed.
<br><br>
This would be much more terrifying than the collapse of the chaos.
<br><br>
If there really was a downgrader, Zen would use all of his skills to kill that person. He wouldn't hesitate, even if his opponent was Kincaid, the Human Spirit King.
<br><br>
"I will find and kill the downgrader. I swear to you," Zen pledged solemnly.
<br><br>
The blood man smiled, and then he was transformed into the original form of the ancestry-level bloodline. "Then, my power is now yours..."
<br><br>
Chapter 4149 Following Zen did not restrain the ancestry-level bloodline, and as a result, it turned into a blood mist and evaporated in the air in the primitive land.
<br><br>
In turn, the primitive land began to tremble again, and blood waterfalls flowed out from the blood mist on the dome.
<br><br>
When the blood waterfalls had flowed down to the bottom, they condensed and formed blood pillars.
<br><br>
There were a total of three hundred and seventy-three blood pillars, and each of them had a corresponding type of blood power of the ancestrylevel bloodline.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Bright blood light suddenly appeared within the blood pillars, and then turned into long arrows that flew towards Zen.
<br><br>
However, he did not dodge and allowed the arrows to hit him.
<br><br>
Puff! As soon as the first blood arrow struck him, he felt something appear in his mind, and it turned out to be the blood power.
<br><br>
That blood power was an ability in the creation quadrant.
<br><br>
Before he could even test it out, more blood-red arrows shot towards him.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff...
<br><br>
Every time a blood-red arrow hit him, a specific kind of blood power appeared in his mind.
<br><br>
More than thirty seconds had passed, and all the blood-red arrows had entered his body. Then, the full power of the ancestry-level bloodline started to appear in his mind.
<br><br>
"The power of space..."
<br><br>
At that moment, he stretched out his hand and pointed to the distance.
<br><br>
Afterward, layers of square spaces appeared somewhere in the primitive land.
<br><br>
The spaces were surprisingly stable and almost as good as the space Othniel had created with the truth power.
<br><br>
"Destructive power! Explode!"
<br><br>
Red flames filled the air as all the spaces exploded at the same time. The destructive power spread out, and fires engulfed the entire primitive land in the blazing heat.
<br><br>
"Creation..."
<br><br>
Just then, Zen spread out his hands in the air.
<br><br>
When the energy in the creation quadrant fanned out, long swords appeared out of thin air from all directions.
<br><br>
Naturally, none of the swords were ordinary weapons as they appeared out of nowhere. Thousands of them fell like rain and collided with each other, making crisp and pleasant sounds. Soon enough, they quickly piled up into a sword mountain.
<br><br>
In general, the Chaos Ancient God, Judson, could create things out of thin air. Ziya could also do the same with the help of the Truth of ThreeEnergy Construction, but the grade, quality and speed of the items they created were far inferior to Zen's.
<br><br>
"Life..."
<br><br>
Zen glanced down.
<br><br>
The emerald life energy began to gather and turned into over a hundred light dots, which took shape into a human.
<br><br>
Not long after, human figures walked out of the light dots.
<br><br>
They looked exactly like Zen, and their physical strength and power were on par with the Eternal Realm warriors'.
<br><br>
Although he could create many incarnations in the continent, they could not leave his inner world. However, these men who looked like him were genuine "people" who could be released to participate in the battle.
<br><br>
"Pick up the swords!" he shouted.
<br><br>
Upon his command, all of the "Zens" picked up the swords on the ground.
<br><br>
With a slight shake of their wrists, they turned around and slashed towards the sky.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! Over one hundred rays of immensely sharp silver sword radiance flew straight up to the sky and cut across the dome of the primitive land. After that, they stopped.
<br><br>
It seemed that the ancestry-level bloodline's most basic ability still had such extraordinary power. At this, Zen looked extremely satisfied.
<br><br>
In the Jade Pure Realm A group of grey beetles flew close to the ground with a faint, flapping sound.
<br><br>
These beetles were quite agile, as they nearly dodged all the obstacles in front of them while they maintained a one-inch distance above the ground at high speed. If one did not look carefully, they could even go unnoticed.
<br><br>
Then again, the Jade Pure Realm was a magical land, where there was never a shortage of magical Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
One variety of palm-sized traveling birds had extensive sighting ability.
<br><br>
No matter how small or hidden something was, their eyes always discovered it.
<br><br>
"Goo! Goo! Goo..."
<br><br>
When the birds saw the group of grey beetles that hovered just above the ground, they immediately swooped down.
<br><br>
While the grey beetles were not slow by any means, the birds were significantly faster.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the birds had swept the beetles away and popped them into their mouths.
<br><br>
"These annoying birds..."
<br><br>
It turned out that Dale had formed the grey beetles. If he had not encountered those troublesome birds, he could have smoothly returned in that form.
<br><br>
Buzz! At that point, dozens of the grey beetles' bodies turned golden, and then swooped towards the birds.
<br><br>
Usually, Dale was not afraid of these birds.
<br><br>
However, his master, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, had told him that he could not return to his original form in the Jade Pure Realm at any time, or else the Snake Spirit King could catch him.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, he could only use limited methods in his current form.
<br><br>
Now, he had no choice but to let the grey beetles explode.
<br><br>
Bang, bang, bang, Bang...
<br><br>
The golden beetles exploded as soon as the birds put them inside their mouths, and detonated the birds' heads in the process.
<br><br>
"You're courting death..." Dale whispered.
<br><br>
Just as he finished speaking, he suddenly heard more bird sounds. He looked up, only to be stunned.
<br><br>
The explosion just now attracted more birds, and tens of thousands of them rushed downward! Only one beetle remained in the group. If the birds pecked that one last beetle, Dale would die in this place.
<br><br>
Luckily, he got to change at the last moment. He quickly turned into a pangolin, stabbed the ground hard, and narrowly avoided such a disaster! It was much safer to sneak around in the form of a pangolin, but his speed got considerably reduced. It took him several days to find the bubble.
<br><br>
Eventually, he found the bubble, entered it and transformed into his own form. After that, he called out tiredly, "Old man..."
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord appeared by his side and pointed at the entrance of the bubble. Then, the entrance quickly vanished without a trace.
<br><br>
As Dale watched the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's swift movement, he suddenly seemed to have realized something. "Old man, is someone following me?" he asked.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded and solemnly said, "There is a trace of an aura that doesn't belong to you. I'm afraid someone has targeted you..."
<br><br>
"That's impossible! I've never transformed into a human form," said Dale.
<br><br>
Even if one used their spiritual sense to check the Other Shore creature he had formed, they could not tell if the creature was real or not. He was quite confident in his bloodline ability.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the war between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect was in full swing, so they could not possibly have the time to look for him.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord didn't say anything. He just controlled the bubble to move deeper into the ground.
<br><br>
In the past few years, others had discovered the bubble about two times, but it could freely move as it was not a fixed cave. When it got caught, it naturally hid in a more secluded place. Still, the Snake Spirit King thought that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was insignificant, just like a rat that hid underground.
<br><br>
Right now, the Snake Spirit King was ready to kill everyone. Both the Bird Spirit King and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, who hid underground, had to be wiped out. Of course, they would receive even worse treatment than before.
<br><br>
Chapter 4150 Lurk In The Dark When the bubble began to move, it alerted the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's other disciples.
<br><br>
After all, this bubble had been underground and immobile for quite a long time.
<br><br>
"Master, what's happening?"
<br><br>
"Master, are you doing that because we were detected?"
<br><br>
the disciples asked the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had many disciples before, but only ten had followed him into the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
He lost four disciples in their explorations. Another two disciples tried to leave the bubble and ended up being killed by the people of the Snake Spirit Sect. Thus, there were only four left with him in the bubble. They were Dale, Arthur, Derrick and Austin. Dale could transform into anything.
<br><br>
Arthur was a pot-bellied man who always wore a beatific smile on his face, like Buddha.
<br><br>
Derrick was almost the opposite of Arthur with his lanky frame and an ever-serious unsmiling expression.
<br><br>
Justin was tall and sturdy and carried a purple-golden furnace. His right arm was covered with many flame-shaped tattoos, which would turn into actual fire for the furnace. The fire in the furnace had never been put out in the past tens of millions of years. He took it with him wherever he went.
<br><br>
Arthur, Derrick and Justin treated the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord with more reverence than Dale did.
<br><br>
"Yes. We have been detected," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord replied tersely, his face grim.
<br><br>
He focused on keeping the bubble moving.
<br><br>
The bubble confined and concealed the aura of the occupants. Moreover, it camouflaged itself such that it would look like part of its surroundings to an observer.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord concentrated on moving the bubble somewhere they would be safe.
<br><br>
The bubble continued forward underground.
<br><br>
Only the sound of crunching earth could be heard all throughout.
<br><br>
The bubble made slow progress onward.
<br><br>
The four disciples remained calm. They had been in similar situations before. They fixed all their attention on the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
Suddenly, noises came from outside the bubble.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! They were spurred alert by the sound, immediately knowing what it was.
<br><br>
"It's a metal-devouring beast!" Arthur exclaimed.
<br><br>
There were many mysterious creatures living underground in the Jade Pure Realm, and the metal-devouring beast was one of them.
<br><br>
The creatures were so named because they fed on the various metals in the earth.
<br><br>
They had a keen sense for detecting metal, and even the bubble could not stop them from getting at it. Metal-devouring beasts had broken the bubble with their teeth several times.
<br><br>
"I'll scare it away!" Dale offered.
<br><br>
"You may not be a match for it," Justin warned.
<br><br>
"Justin and I will handle it. Justin could capture it and I can just swallow it," Arthur said.
<br><br>
"I agree," Derrick said.
<br><br>
Right now, they knew it would be best for them to stay within the bubble, so everyone agreed on this plan. They immediately got to executing it.
<br><br>
Justin and Arthur went to the side of the bubble where the surface already appeared to be bulging. Outside, the metal-devouring beast was trying to break through.
<br><br>
"I'm going to catch it now. Get ready," Justin said as he placed his palms on the bulging wall.
<br><br>
An Other Shore Token slowly emerged from Justin's back. It was an ink brush as tall as a person. The tip of the brush was awash not in ink but with the blue power of space.
<br><br>
Justin closed his eyes, and the ink brush began to draw automatically in the air.
<br><br>
The blue power of space was depicting the outline of the metal-devouring beast.
<br><br>
When the outline was done, Justin opened his eyes, now glowing with a blue light.
<br><br>
The metal-devouring beast outside was dragged into the bubble.
<br><br>
The creature was completely caught by surprise. It stared blankly at the two human beings suddenly in front of it.
<br><br>
Before it could get its bearings, Arthur opened his mouth.
<br><br>
Arthur's mouth quickly grew wider and wider until it was almost the size of a cavern.
<br><br>
In one gulp, Arthur devoured the ten-foot-long metal-devouring beast.
<br><br>
Arthur patted his belly with satisfaction. "Got it!"
<br><br>
He and Justin then returned to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's side.
<br><br>
The bubble continued drilling tens of thousands of feet deeper and hundreds of thousands of feet northward. Finally, it stopped. Everyone in the bubble heaved a sigh of relief. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord felt safe enough to converse at this point. "How did it go on the Night View Island?" he asked Dale.
<br><br>
"Everything went well. Just as you said, the primitive land expanded after the ancestry-level bloodline entered it," Dale replied.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's face lit up with joy. "That is good!"
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had wanted to believe Elder Xue, but it was still just the latter's speculation.
<br><br>
Now he had confirmation that Zen had succeeded, which meant all his efforts had paid off. Everything was going according to plan.
<br><br>
"But I have also made another discovery," Dale pronounced.
<br><br>
"What is it?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Zen has the key," Dale answered.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord pressed.
<br><br>
"He obtained a key in the Soul City. The brush-wielder from the Eternal Scroll Painting told him that he could use the key to open the door of the altar," Dale reported.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Arthur, Derrick and Justin started sputtering in shock.
<br><br>
"Are you sure?" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was more surprised than his disciples. Opening the door to the altar was his greatest wish.
<br><br>
Dale had a playful streak. He was not beyond making exaggerated statements.
<br><br>
Dale looked affronted. "Of course, I am. Don't you trust me?"
<br><br>
"I never have," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord responded without missing a beat.
<br><br>
Defeated, Dale simply shut his mouth and pouted.
<br><br>
There was a basin a hundred miles wide at the southern part of the Jade Pure Realm. Water that smelled like wine pooled there, earning it the name Wine Basin.
<br><br>
Across the Wine Basin was a narrow path that led to the peninsula located at the edge of the Jade Pure Realm. The peninsula was the stronghold of the Bird Spirit Sect. Hence, the Wine Basin was an important pass for the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The troops of the Snake Spirit Sect in the Mist City had recently been raiding the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings had already gathered outside the Wine Basin today.
<br><br>
Sewell, the troops' commander, was preparing to launch their twelfth attack on the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
It was a short distance between the Mist City and the Wine Basin. When the Treacherous Beings got killed, they would come back to life in the Mist City and join the invasion on the Wine Basin again.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings could be resurrected infinitely, but it took time. If a Treacherous Being got killed too many times in a short period, it would take him or her longer to come back.
<br><br>
Sewell had a simple strategy.
<br><br>
He would order his men to attack the Bird Masters and kill them again and again. That way, the speed of their resurrection would be slowed down and he could finally take the stronghold of the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Right before Sewell gave the order to execute the plan, a white snake came to his side, whispering, "The coordinates are in place."
<br><br>
"Are they in the bubble now?" Sewell asked.
<br><br>
The white snake nodded. "Yes. Abel and I had put our coordinates in a metal-devouring beast's stomach. It had just been captured and brought into the bubble."
<br><br>
"You two will not join the battle, then. If you get killed and come back to life, it might tip them off. But we will find them right after we take over the Bird Spirit Sect," Sewell said, steely determination in his voice.
<br><br>
Chapter 4151 Erase Coordinates There were a total of four teams behind Sewell, the Divine Snake Department, the Black Snake Department, the Cyan Snake Department, and the Abdomen Poison Department.
<br><br>
Sewell himself led the Divine Snake Department which consisted of the strongest elites of the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
"The Black Snake Department, and the Cyan Snake Department, you attack from both sides!" Sewell commanded with authority.
<br><br>
"The Cyan Snake Department got it!"
<br><br>
"The Black Snake Department, attack!"
<br><br>
the two Snake Masters standing respectively on the left and right teams responded, leading the teams to charge towards the Wine Basin...
<br><br>
"Divine Snake Department, follow me to attack!"
<br><br>
Sewell rushed into the Wine Basin first after his order.
<br><br>
His body expanded rapidly the moment he rushed into the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
The high water splashed on both sides.
<br><br>
The elites of the Divine Snake Department followed his lead and also stepped in! The last one of the four teams, the Abdomen Poison Department, specialized at using poison. They usually wandered around when a battle was in full swing, but at this moment, they stayed put.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
On the right side of the Wine Basin, a group of human spirits walked fast on the water. They skimmed like dragonflies across the water–advancing with naturally graceful movements.
<br><br>
The three houses of the Human Spirit Sect were regrouped and joined the Cyan Snake Department. Together with the other members of the Cyan Snake Department, they hurried to the right side of the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
The bird spirits had built many complicated bird nests in the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
These nests were sturdy and huge, supported by complex internal structures.
<br><br>
Since they couldn't use spatial transference, the several teams could only break in by force relying on their bodies.
<br><br>
"This time, we people of the three houses will try our best to take down the first three bird nests. If anyone slacks off, I will report them to the Cyan Snake Department and have their coordinates erased forever!"
<br><br>
Gianni shouted, walking in front of the team.
<br><br>
The human spirits of the Black House, the Broad House, and the Joy House had long been dissatisfied with the Snake Spirit Sect. Previously, they only guarded the various Pure Sky Platforms and did insignificant things. But now they were involved in a battle with the Bird Spirit Sect, the anger in them intensified.
<br><br>
The human spirits, monkey spirits, snake spirits, and bird spirits were supposed to be a family. Why had they come to kill each other like this? Shivers ran down their spine when they heard Gianni's warning.
<br><br>
In the last round of attack, Heath of the Joy House and Uriel of the Black House purposefully got themselves killed by the Bird Masters. Gianni then reported this to the Snake Masters, and the Snake Masters immediately erased their coordinates.
<br><br>
The two human spirits then died permanently.
<br><br>
The chaos was just a small pond, and all the Treacherous Beings believed that this state was temporary. Sooner or later they could return to the main world, yet the thought of dying in this small pond was grim and excruciating.
<br><br>
Despite the horror, the human spirits had their own plans.
<br><br>
Once the fight actually began, the situation would certainly be chaotic.
<br><br>
So, it would be normal if anyone accidentally got killed.
<br><br>
"You can't slack off," Gianni emphasized. "On top of that, I will erase the coordinates of the five people who die first."
<br><br>
Everyone's face darkened with sorrow and fear.
<br><br>
Alphonse and Hamilton frowned and exchanged glances secretly.
<br><br>
When they set foot on the journey, the two human spirits had already devised a plan. If they had a chance, they would lead the human spirits of the three houses to take back the coordinates and escape from the Jade Pure Realm! When they stepped into the battlefield, they realized that they had no chance to carry out the plan.
<br><br>
The coordinates were closely guarded in the Mist City. Moreover, Gianni also helped the Snake Masters watch them closely! Gianni sensed the emotions of the human spirits. He smiled faintly and said, "This is the order of the Snake Masters. I'm just passing on the words so you won't dare slack off! If you are not convinced, you can ask the Snake Masters yourselves."
<br><br>
Everyone stayed silent.
<br><br>
To confirm it with the Snake Masters was no different from courting death.
<br><br>
As the human spirits rushed dozens of miles forward, three huge bird nests appeared in front of them.
<br><br>
The lower part of the nest was supported by a row of straight trunks while the upper part was oval-shaped covered in thick thorns.
<br><br>
When the human spirits saw the bird nests, the bird spirits in the nests also spotted them.
<br><br>
"Aoo..."
<br><br>
A frightening cry of eagles reverberated from the bird nests.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...
<br><br>
Out came flying a flock of snow-white birds.
<br><br>
"It's the Snow Bird Department! They exchanged positions!" someone reminded the others loudly as he recognized the birds.
<br><br>
In the previous rounds of attacks, the human spirits fought the Iron Bird Department. These were bird spirits that looked like eagles who had vigorous wings.
<br><br>
In this round of attack, they thought they would face the Iron Bird Department again, but the Bird Spirit Sect seemed to have changed their strategy! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
After the Snow Birds flew to a peak, they spiraled down like snowballs crashing down on everyone.
<br><br>
The Snow Birds didn't seem powerful with the attack, yet they posed a great threat.
<br><br>
When they were several thousand feet from the warriors of the three houses, everyone felt a chill rushing among them.
<br><br>
In the Wine Basin, the water up to people's knees quickly began to condense into ice. Even the newly condensed ice was as strong as a weapon. Some people couldn't pull their legs as they became planted to the ice! "Puff, puff, puff..."
<br><br>
Three human spirits who couldn't get out of the ice were directly hit by the Snow Birds.
<br><br>
The freezing air blew and enveloped them, turning them into ice sculptures.
<br><br>
Killing Treacherous Beings had never been easy.
<br><br>
They were able to recover after being cut into little pieces, let alone being frozen.
<br><br>
However, the bodies of the Snow Birds had sand grain-sized Holy Stones hidden in them. The Holy Stones burst out as the human spirits froze.
<br><br>
When the Light of Annihilation enveloped the ice sculptures, it produced a magical effect. The Treacherous Beings melted like snow lying under the sun's heat...
<br><br>
As the other human spirits witnessed this, they all turned to look at Gianni. Death was not scary–what was terrifying was the removal of their coordinates.
<br><br>
"Three people died already?" asked Gianni with a wicked smile on his face. "It seems that five people is not enough. I will double the number.
<br><br>
The ten people who die first will have their coordinates erased!"
<br><br>
The human spirits shuddered. Overcome with resentment, they decided to proceed. They all used their best skills to counterattack.
<br><br>
"Sword haze, destructive move!"
<br><br>
Alphonse somersaulted and a bright long sword appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
The long sword was made of Holy Stone. Countless rays of snow-white sword radiance mixing with the Light of Annihilation shone upwards.
<br><br>
"Puff, puff, puff..."
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation instantly pierced through the Snow Birds, shattering them into pieces.
<br><br>
Under Alphonse's lead, the human spirits all launched a counterattack.
<br><br>
Although the Snow Birds had a populous destructive tendency, their defense was extremely weak. They lost their fighting power after being hit by the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
The human spirits of the three houses were not weak. They worked together forming a strong line of defense.
<br><br>
Despise their large number, the Snow Birds fell one after another from only a hundred feet away. In less than three minutes, more than ten thousand Snow Birds had been eliminated, leaving no Snow Bird flying out from the nests again.
<br><br>
Chapter 4152 Battle Of Attrition "Keep moving,"
<br><br>
Gianni barked, after having dealt with the Snow Birds.
<br><br>
Every round of attacks required all human spirits to die in battle.
<br><br>
However, this time, all the human spirits stopped in their tracks.
<br><br>
The three human spirits that were just killed would have their coordinates erased.
<br><br>
It was said that seven more were to suffer the same fate.
<br><br>
"General Gianni, all of us will die in a round of attack," Alphonse said with a hint of anxiety in his tone. "Do you mean the coordinates of ten people will definitely be erased after every round of attacks?"
<br><br>
"General Gianni, we are all human spirits," Hamilton pitched in. "How could you be so cruel?"
<br><br>
Both Alphonse and Hamilton were leaders of their respective houses, and were far stronger than ordinary human spirits. It was unlikely they were going to die first.
<br><br>
However, the members of the three houses were of the same sect and race.
<br><br>
They tended to look out for each other. When Gianni treated their lives like trash, they felt indignant yet helpless.
<br><br>
Gianni stared at Alphonse with mock. "If you think ten is too many, then sacrifice yourselves. Once we reach the quota of ten, the remaining people will be safe."
<br><br>
All the human spirits who overheard this felt anger stir in their hearts.
<br><br>
Even the several human spirits of the Broad House that followed Gianni were furious. One of them, a burly man, cursed loudly. "Gianni! It was stupid of me to follow you this whole time!"
<br><br>
"General Gianni, as a general of the Ten Directions House, you are so ruthless..."
<br><br>
"General Gianni, go to hell..."
<br><br>
The human spirits began to curse him, one after another.
<br><br>
As Gianni heard these offensive and harsh reproaches, his disposition remained unchanged. With a bored expression, he said, "The monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City have all been executed. Is that what you want?"
<br><br>
The sole reason why the Snake Masters allowed the three houses to exist was because they still found them useful. The second they lost their value, the Snake Masters would exterminate them swiftly and mercilessly.
<br><br>
A hush fell over the crowd. Exchanging nervous glances, no one dared utter another curse.
<br><br>
Naturally, no one wanted to die here, in this small pond. Only by living on could they possibly see light at the other end of the tunnel.
<br><br>
Through gritted teeth, Alphonse said, "Warriors of the three houses, charge!"
<br><br>
Then, taking the lead, he rushed forth into the battlefield.
<br><br>
Shooting each other helpless glances, the other human spirits had no choice but to follow suit.
<br><br>
Gianni watched the people rush into the bird nests with a grim expression.
<br><br>
Just then, a small snake-shaped mark appeared on Gianni's shoulder. From the mark, a voice rang out, "Gianni, you did a good job."
<br><br>
"Thank you for your praise, Master Balfour," Gianni replied. Any trace of regret was wiped from his face and was instantly replaced with excitement.
<br><br>
"Take down the nest in the far right, and our Snake Spirit Sect will reward you generously," Balfour said. "When we return to the main world in the future, you will be in charge of the Human Spirit Sect."
<br><br>
The Snake Masters, snake spirits and all the other Treacherous Beings were extremely dissatisfied while trapped in this small chaos.
<br><br>
They had all hoped that one day they would return to the main world.
<br><br>
Even the Snake Spirit King promised that if they were able to come back, the Four Spirits Sect would be rebuilt.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect would be the ruling force, and the other three sects would probably serve as vassals.
<br><br>
However, the status of Human Spirit King was still good, despite being a vassal. "Master Balfour," Gianni said, practically beaming, "you are so kind. I will do my best!"
<br><br>
Then, the snake-shaped mark dimmed gradually, until it completely disappeared from his skin.
<br><br>
From a hundred miles away, Balfour, leader of the Cyan Snake Department, sneered arrogantly, "When the Bird Spirit Sect is taken down, you will no longer be of any use to me. You want to return to the main world? And become the Human Spirit King? What a ridiculous dream..."
<br><br>
Creating a divide amongst the Four Spirits Sect was no easy task for the Snake Spirit King. Why on earth would he want to rebuild it upon returning to the main world? Yes, it was true that they planned that the Four Spirits Sect would still exist once they returned, but the Snake Spirit King would be their sole ruler.
<br><br>
After muttering to himself for a while, Balfour then turned to his soldiers.
<br><br>
"The rate of those damned birds' revival is slowing down," he announced.
<br><br>
"Let's take the nests in this round! Charge!"
<br><br>
The Cyan Snakes, which were currently coiled before Balfour, had all been quivering with excitement. They were one of the main forces of the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
As soon as Balfour gave the order, the snake spirits dashed towards the nests, their forked tongues slipping in and out of their narrow lips excitedly.
<br><br>
The nests built by the Bird Spirit Sect were a natural fortress. From the outside, they looked like a haphazard mess. From the inside, however, the structure was incredibly unique.
<br><br>
The bird spirits could spread their wings and fly with ease inside these nests, but any enemy that attacked from outside would've troubles navigating, being blocked layer by layer. Thanks to the nests' unique structure, the Bird Spirit Sect were able to block the Snake Spirit Sect's attacks until this point.
<br><br>
Swish! Upon entering one of the nests, Balfour moved quickly yet quietly, like a ghost.
<br><br>
Two rows of sharp blades stuck out from the sides of his body, making him resemble a centipede. This was his fighting form.
<br><br>
The second a shadow of a bird spirit entered his cone of vision, he'd lunge forward.
<br><br>
Without having the time to even cry out, bird spirits would be cut to pieces by the sharp blades.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Balfour had felled countless bird spirits when a huge figure emerged from one of the nests. The figure stretched out a pair of sharp claws and swiftly grabbed at Balfour. However, Balfour saw it coming and turned his body slightly, and the blades on the sides of his body clashed with the incoming sharp talons.
<br><br>
Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang...
<br><br>
As dozens of blades collided with the sharp claws, the sound of clashing metal echoed throughout the bird nest.
<br><br>
Balfour retreated a few feet till he found a pillar he could coil around.
<br><br>
Climbing up the pillar, his beady eyes finally caught a full view of the figure that had just attacked him. "Duran, long time no see. How have you been?"
<br><br>
The giant bird glared at him. He was Duran, the second strongest Bird Master of the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
With a snort, Duran narrowed his eyes at Balfour. "You're going to die soon, I'm afraid this reunion will be cut short."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, he spread his wings and launched himself towards Balfour. In the blink of an eye, he closed the distance between him and Balfour, talons poised to strike.
<br><br>
Balfour immediately raised his coiled body, coming to meet Duran like a spiral blade.
<br><br>
However, Duran was much faster than Balfour. He moved like lightning, flashing here and there and striking Balfour swiftly. Each time Duran swooped in, he left deep claw marks on Balfour's back, head, and tail.
<br><br>
Additionally, there were also Holy Stones embedded in Duran's sharp claws. The Light of Annihilation penetrated through the claw marks into Balfour's body, destroying his body little by little.
<br><br>
Seeing he was at a disadvantage, Balfour tried to get out of this tricky situation.
<br><br>
He flew upwards, trying to make his way around the complex bird nest, simultaneously trying to dodge Duran's attacks.
<br><br>
But obviously, Duran knew the bird nest better than Balfour. No matter where Balfour went, Duran followed.
<br><br>
Balfour had nowhere to hide. He desperately rushed to the top of the nest and knocked open a big hole in its roof, flying into the open sky.
<br><br>
However, just as he had flown a thousand feet, Duran swiftly closed the distance. A pair of sharp claws wrapped around the snake's body firmly, despite the blades sticking out of Balfour's body. Unable to fight back, Balfour could do nothing but watch helplessly as Duran dragged him back to the nest.
<br><br>
Chapter 4153 Punishment Trampled under Duran's feet, Balfour remained fearless. Instead, he smiled sinisterly and said, "I'm indeed no match for you, but since you showed up, this probably means that the Bird Spirit Sect cannot deal with our continuous attacks, right?"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect launched eleven attacks before, but Duran did not participate in any.
<br><br>
Duran's presence only meant that the Bird Spirit Sect was worn out. They had no choice but to send their stronger Bird Masters to counter the attacks of the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
"Shut up!"
<br><br>
Vengeance appeared in his eyes. Balfour's words struck the wrong cord.
<br><br>
The battle between the Bird Spirit and Snake Spirit Sects in the Jade Pure Realm had been fierce. However, the two forces were not evenly-matched and the Bird Spirit Sect was always left at a disadvantage.
<br><br>
However, it proved impossible for the Snake Spirit Sect to take down the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Though the Bird Spirit King Sheehan hadn't awakened, he still had extraordinary strength. It was difficult for the Snake Spirit King to send the Bird Spirit Sect on their knees.
<br><br>
Thus, this seemingly endless war continued for countless years. It never ceased.
<br><br>
According to the will of Sheehan, the Bird Masters supported the Nihility race in a plot to destroy this chaos.
<br><br>
With the help of the Bird Masters, the Nihility race grew in strength and number. The Bird Masters were notably impressed with the performance of the Grandmaster of Heaven, and they were pleased to see that in this round of chaos, the Evil God that joined the Nihility race had controlled the Source World for their advantage.
<br><br>
Nothing like this had ever happened in the past.
<br><br>
This was the Bird Masters' opportunity.
<br><br>
If they used the Source World to destroy the chaos, everything would easily return to zero.
<br><br>
However, not long after the Evil God took control of the Source World, the Snake Spirit Sect launched another attack.
<br><br>
They had even moved the coordinates to the Mist City - they were determined to win the battle.
<br><br>
This Bird Spirit Sect had no choice but to resist and counterattack.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings from the Snake Spirit Sect launched eleven attacks. The Bird Masters and spirits eventually grew exhausted. A few of the bird spirits were still being revived, which would take much time.
<br><br>
Because some bird spirits hadn't been revived, Duran had to fill the vacancy.
<br><br>
However, the attacks of the Snake Spirit Sect never ceased. They assumed that the Snake Spirit Sect would launch countless more attacks until the Bird Spirit Sect's Treacherous Beings had no more back-up.
<br><br>
Their tactic of repeated attacks to weaken their army aggravated Duran.
<br><br>
He was furious.
<br><br>
"Since you are so angry, why don't you just kill me?" Balfour said, emotionless.
<br><br>
He didn't care at this point. He just wanted it to be over. After all, he could be revived even if he died.
<br><br>
Duran looked at the Snake Master with a sudden kindness, "I won't kill you. I will merely imprison you!"
<br><br>
As he spoke his last word, he grabbed Balfour with his claws and flew away.
<br><br>
If Balfour was imprisoned, he could not revive himself. This meant a great deal for them, because Balfour would not be able to participate in the next round of battle.
<br><br>
"Duran, you don't think we've thought this though?" Balfour said with a smug grin.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the Light of Annihilation exploded from Balfour's body.
<br><br>
His Treacherous Being form collapsed and disappeared from the grasp of Duran's claws, leaving only a few Holy Stones that fell to the ground.
<br><br>
Just like that, the twelfth attack of the Snake Spirit Sect ended after a full day.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect failed while the Treacherous Beings that participated in the charge were completely annihilated.
<br><br>
However, the Bird Masters felt exasperated. Meanwhile, the group gathered together to discuss countermeasures.
<br><br>
Behind the Wine Basin, golden coordinates floated in the air.
<br><br>
Most of the surfaces on the coordinates were dim, which only meant that they lacked energy and needed time to recover.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit Sect would not give them enough time to do so. No doubt the thirteenth round of attack was already underway.
<br><br>
The atmosphere of the Snake Spirit Sect in the Mist City seemed more relaxed after what had happened.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Snake Masters, it was only a matter of time until they defeated the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
In the northwest of the Mist City, golden coordinates glowed brightly and the human spirits of the three houses returned to life.
<br><br>
At the same time, Alphonse exited his coordinates in his human form. He appeared fatigued.
<br><br>
He went all out in this battle to impress the Snake Masters just so they would make things easier for the three houses.
<br><br>
But when he saw Gianni with his arms crossed across his chest, his expression darkened.
<br><br>
As the human spirits resurrected, Balfour stealthily slithered over.
<br><br>
He scanned through the human spirits present, and then his gaze landed on Gianni. "You did a good job in this round of attack," he praised. "The revival of the human spirits is fast. The three houses of the human spirits are an indispensable force for our Cyan Snake Department!"
<br><br>
When the human spirits heard Balfour's words, their jaws dropped and their hearts skipped a beat.
<br><br>
If Balfour actually valued the three houses, there was no way he would erase their coordinates.
<br><br>
Gianni responded modestly, "This is all thanks to your clever plan." He bowed and continued, "The human spirits feared that their coordinates would be erased, so they fought long and hard. If their lives are not threatened, they would still hold back in the fight."
<br><br>
"So you mean..." Balfour blinked repeatedly as he analyzed what he'd said.
<br><br>
"I had intended to erase ten people's coordinates. Since the three houses performed well, I suggest we still stick to the original plan of only erasing five people's coordinates!" Gianni concluded.
<br><br>
"Do as you say," Balfour replied.
<br><br>
Both Alphonse and Hamilton were furious.
<br><br>
The surrounding human spirits glared at Gianni in anger.
<br><br>
However, Gianni acted as if he didn't care. "In the twelfth round of attack, the first five people who died were Yurem, Ezekiel, Rishi, Shaun and Jaidyn!"
<br><br>
Every time someone's name was called, that person turned pale and trembled with fright.
<br><br>
"General Gianni! Give me one more chance!" Yurem fell down to his knees and begged.
<br><br>
"Master Balfour, I died only because I was careless this time. I did fight with all my strength..." Ezekiel attempted to persuade.
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
As Gianni faced these people's excuses and begging, his cold expression never changed. "Rules are rules. If these rules could be so easily changed, then no one would be working hard."
<br><br>
He walked to the coordinates of the five with a golden hammer condensed in his hand. This weapon was given to him by Balfour, and was used to dispose of coordinates.
<br><br>
With one swing, he lightly hit on one of the coordinates and it shattered to pieces.
<br><br>
The human spirit named Yurem shrieked in agony. Then, his body lightened and lightened as it slowly turned into a transparent shadow that eventually disappeared.
<br><br>
"How... How dare you really do this to us! I will fight you to death!"
<br><br>
"Let's fight together!"
<br><br>
Ezekiel and Rishi nodded at each other and rushed towards Gianni, while the other human spirits didn't react.
<br><br>
Everyone, including Alphonse and Hamilton, was extremely angry, but none of them wanted to walk to their deaths.
<br><br>
Before Ezekiel and Rishi could even get close to Gianni, Balfour curled his tail and swung it. Just like that, these Treacherous Beings dispersed.
<br><br>
Gianni looked at them and scoffed, then continued to break the remaining coordinates one by one.
<br><br>
Within a minute, the four human spirits lost the chance to revive forever and died in the secondary world.
<br><br>
Chapter 4154 Release Silence hung thick in the air as the human spirits of the Broad House, Joy House, and Black House stayed quiet.
<br><br>
They knew well that if they spoke out at this time, they would end up in the same miserable situation as those five people, and their coordinates would be shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Balfour was quite satisfied with Gianni's deterrence.
<br><br>
It seemed that it was a wise decision to hand over these human spirits to Gianni, who would rule over them.
<br><br>
"Snake Master, our Human Spirit Sect is ready. When will we start the thirteenth round of attack?" Gianni asked, loyalty evident in his face.
<br><br>
Balfour thought for a moment, and said, "We might have to wait two days before launching the thirteenth round of attack. Although our Cyan Snake Department performed well this time, the Bird Spirit Sect violently counterattacked the Black Snake Department and the Divine Snake Department, and some of the snake spirits haven't gotten revived yet."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect suffered huge losses, and the Bird Spirit Sect was even worse.
<br><br>
Based on the current situation, the Bird Spirit Sect would have a hard time defending if they got attacked one or two more times.
<br><br>
However, the revival speed of the snake spirits was too slow, and it was even a burden to the entire Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
"You human spirits resurrected quite fast. Sewell asked me to bring your coordinates into the battlefield of the Wine Basin," said Balfour. Then he added, "So after you die next time, you can resurrect quickly and launch the attack again…"
<br><br>
Upon hearing his words, many of the human spirits felt scared once again.
<br><br>
It was already very dangerous to put the coordinates in the Mist City. How could they bring those directly to the battlefield of the Wine Basin? If Balfour died, the Bird Masters would surely destroy all the human spirits' coordinates.
<br><br>
Of course, they would also die by then! Even the ever-loyal Gianni's face darkened.
<br><br>
"When I enter the Wine Basin, surely there will be powerful Bird Masters there who will target me. So, I want to hand over the coordinates of the human spirits to you. What do you think?" Balfour asked.
<br><br>
Alphonse, Hamilton, and the rest all looked at Gianni, who was shocked.
<br><br>
"That's not applicable. If I'm in charge of the lives of the human spirits, I'm afraid I can't take on this responsibility well," he stated.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter. I trust you. You don't have to fight personally. You only need to command the battle," Balfour encouraged.
<br><br>
Indeed, Gianni had earned Balfour's trust through his performance in this period. Most importantly, the Snake Spirit King had lost his patience and asked his members to take down the Bird Spirit Sect as soon as possible, so the entire Snake Spirit Sect acted rashly.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the three human houses were powerful in combat, so Balfour wanted to use their strength to the limit.
<br><br>
"Thank you for your trust. I won't let you down!" Gianni bowed to Balfour respectfully.
<br><br>
Balfour nodded and walked to the golden coordinates. With a flick of his long tail, he took Gianni's coordinates away.
<br><br>
Although he trusted Gianni, he had to be careful to prevent Gianni from retaliating.
<br><br>
Once again, all the human spirits trained their gazes on Gianni. This person had complete control of their coordinates. No one knew what would happen.
<br><br>
Two days later, the Snake Spirit Sect launched the thirteenth round of attacks.
<br><br>
The troops of the Snake Spirit Sect crushed the Wine Basin yet again.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Gianni still led the three houses' human spirits to the far right side of the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
All the human spirits looked numb. After all, according to the current situation, they would still have a hard time even if they defeated the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
After they passed through the right side of the Wine Basin, the bird nests appeared in front of them again.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Gianni waved his hand and arrogantly shouted, "Stop!"
<br><br>
"What other instructions do you want to give us?" Alphonse asked, his voice dripped with sarcasm.
<br><br>
Gianni stood on the water with a strange expression on his face, as if he thought deeply about his life.
<br><br>
In reality, he was a little disappointed and helpless. A sigh escaped from his lips, and he surprisingly felt courageous at that point. "Retreat from the far right, bypass the Mist City, and return to the center of the Jade Pure Realm. Now that the Snake Spirit Sect has sent their full force to battle, no one is guarding there," he said.
<br><br>
In turn, Alphonse, Hamilton, and the others were stunned and stared at Gianni. They wondered what he was up to.
<br><br>
"Gianni, what do you mean?" Alphonse asked.
<br><br>
"Escape. Run away with your coordinates. Everyone will be free by then! This is the only chance!" Gianni said excitedly.
<br><br>
Then, he waved his hands and threw out hundreds of golden coordinates.
<br><br>
Naturally, many human spirits became ecstatic when they saw their coordinates.
<br><br>
After all, their biggest weakness was those coordinates , but to their surprise, Gianni took the initiative and handed them over.
<br><br>
"Are you going to let us go?" Alphonse asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Yes," Gianni answered and stared at him. "It was quite hard to get the coordinates back from the Snake Masters. Our only chance was to gain their trust. Still, I feel sorry for those who died!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect had sent the three human houses to the Pure Sky Platforms to guard some unimportant things in the past.
<br><br>
Gianni had always been diligent and never showed any dissatisfaction with the Snake Spirit Sect. He had always been loyal and devoted, but that did not mean that he did not see through the Snake Masters' ambitions.
<br><br>
"Don't you still want to be the Human Spirit King?" Hamilton asked.
<br><br>
"These Snake Masters are all vicious. Once the human spirits are not useful for them, will they still let us live? They have eliminated all the monkey spirits. When they destroy the Bird Spirit Sect, all of us will die.
<br><br>
Do you think they will help me become the Human Spirit King? Even a three-year-old child would not believe such a silly promise," Gianni replied with a laugh.
<br><br>
As soon as he uttered those words, the people's disgust towards him disappeared immediately.
<br><br>
"But your coordinates is still with Balfour," Hamilton said.
<br><br>
"I'm not going to leave," Gianni responded with a faint smile.
<br><br>
When Balfour took his coordinates, he had already made up his mind.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
A look of regret crossed Alphonse's face. "We've wronged you this whole time," he muttered.
<br><br>
"If you haven't treated me like that, how could I get the chance?" Gianni said.
<br><br>
"But the Other Shore is so big. Even if we escape with the coordinates, I'm afraid it would be hard to find a place to hide," Alphonse mumbled anxiously.
<br><br>
Gianni stared at Alphonse and asked, "Why did the Snake Spirit King suddenly want to kill the monkey spirits?"
<br><br>
The monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City were surely not weak, and they were even much more powerful than the three human houses.
<br><br>
Moreover, they were quite loyal and obedient. They were good helpers of the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Despite that, the Snake Spirit King suddenly removed their coordinates and annihilated all of them. Something was not right.
<br><br>
Alphonse only shook his head as he couldn't figure out what was going on.
<br><br>
"Monkey spirits are usually loyal to the Snake Spirit King, but what if the Monkey Spirit King woke up?" Gianni asked.
<br><br>
"You mean..." There was silence as Alphonse stared wide-eyed at Gianni in disbelief.
<br><br>
Gianni nodded and continued, "I've seen a few human beings on the Pure Sky Platform, and they saved the world builders. I don't know if the awakening of the Monkey Spirit King has anything to do with those humans, but I suggest you go to the Night View Island!"
<br><br>
It was not a secret that the Monkey Spirit King remained on the Night View Island. The human spirits also knew that the passageway to the Night View Island had gotten destroyed. Therefore, Gianni deduced that something had happened on the Night View Island based on the information he had learned.
<br><br>
At that moment, the snake-shaped mark on his shoulder suddenly lit up.
<br><br>
Chapter 4155 Sheehan's Wish Gianni covered the snake-shaped mark with his hand and ordered, "Run!"
<br><br>
"But…" Hamilton said reluctantly.
<br><br>
"What are you waiting for? Go, now!" Gianni roared.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Alphonse glanced at Gianni and also commanded, "All of you, take your own coordinates and leave with me! I won't hear any excuse!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Alphonse took the lead and made a series of ripples on the surface of the water as he moved.
<br><br>
The other human spirits also followed closely behind after putting away their coordinates.
<br><br>
As Gianni saw that the images of the human spirits receded little by little in the distance, a grin gradually appeared on his face.
<br><br>
He then removed his hand, exposing the snake-shaped mark. "Gianni! What are you doing? Why aren't you attacking the bird nests?" Balfour asked in a loud voice.
<br><br>
"In a minute," Gianni replied.
<br><br>
"Why? What happened? Why did you even hesitate?" Balfour continued asking.
<br><br>
"Some bird spirits blocked us halfway. It wasn't a wise decision to recklessly attack them," Gianni lied with a straight face.
<br><br>
"But you're the only one left!" Through the snake-shaped mark, Balfour immediately found out that something wrong was going on.
<br><br>
"Cut the crap and stop being nosy!" Gianni snapped back, losing his patience.
<br><br>
He suddenly reached out his hand and tapped the snake-shaped mark which instantly trembled and broke into pieces.
<br><br>
Balfour was taken aback when he was suddenly reprimanded by Gianni.
<br><br>
He fell silent for a while before he was able to let out an angry roar.
<br><br>
It was too late for him to confirm what had really happened.
<br><br>
Everything could only be verified after the end of the attack. After all, the thirteenth round of attack had already begun, so it was far beyond the reach of his power.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of the fierce battle between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect, the human spirits of the three houses quickly left the battlefield situated in the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
They bypassed the Mist City and the checkpoint of the Snake Spirit Sect, and took the opportunity to head straight into the center of the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
However, this didn't go unnoticed in the eyes of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
When the thirteenth round of attack from the Snake Spirit Sect began, Cornelius, the Snake Spirit King, finally made his appearance in the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
There was an amber-colored diamond-shaped gem embedded in Cornelius's head, which was a Holy Item called the Limited Omnipotent Stone.
<br><br>
With the aid of this gem, he was able to see everything within a limited area. Thus, everything that was happening in the Jade Pure Realm couldn't escape from his eyes.
<br><br>
Previously, when Dale returned to the bubble, he had been captured by Cornelius. Then, Sewell quietly sent the coordinates into the bubble afterward.
<br><br>
"There are some deserters," Cornelius said in an annoyed tone.
<br><br>
Surprise instantly appeared in Sewell's eyes as he heard what the Snake Spirit King said. "Who dares to escape?" he asked.
<br><br>
"The human spirits from the three houses," Cornelius answered briefly.
<br><br>
"Then I'll go and capture them right now," Sewell quickly responded.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King looked at the edge of the Wine Basin and shook his head. "There's no need to do that. We don't have to deal with them personally. Besides, there's nowhere they can go that I can't see. What we need to focus on is the Bird Spirit King."
<br><br>
On the peninsula behind the Wine Basin, the bird spirits used the rare gold threads to make a huge nest. On the nest was a giant bird that looked like a swan. His wings appeared to be symmetrical rhombuses, like two magnificent crystal mines as they were spread out.
<br><br>
The giant bird's head was resting on the ground of the nest, motionless.
<br><br>
His eyes remained wide open, and they were now filled with so much chaos and killing intent.
<br><br>
"They should be punished.
<br><br>
No one is innocent in this world, and I have to remove all their sins.
<br><br>
Those snakes are the root cause of all sins!" the giant bird said in his sleep.
<br><br>
It was Sheehan, the Bird Spirit King. For countless years now, he had been crawling on the ground in this position.
<br><br>
Even in his unconscious state, he still had a lot of appetite for destruction.
<br><br>
Therefore, even as a Treacherous Being, his combat effectiveness was still terrifying. This was the very reason why the Snake Spirit King had never dared to take him down before.
<br><br>
"Our king! You don't have to concern yourself with this skirmish."
<br><br>
"We can take care of them on our own."
<br><br>
"That's right! We, the bird spirits, can't be defeated by them!"
<br><br>
Three Bird Masters bowed before the Bird Spirit King and kept on persuading him not to leave the nest.
<br><br>
The leader of the three Bird Masters was called Lawler. He was ranked first in terms of strength among all the Bird Masters. The second was Duran, and the third was Orval. They all wore a suit of heavy armor that made them look like giant reptiles instead of birds.
<br><br>
The three of them were supposed to participate in the battle happening at the Wine Basin. However, when they knew that the Bird Spirit King wanted to set out personally, they had no choice but to stay behind and persuade their king to change his mind.
<br><br>
The problem was Sheehan wasn't totally awake. His subconsciousness was what made him move.
<br><br>
Since he had turned into a Treacherous Being, he had been so full of resentment towards everything in the world. It was his obsession to destroy everything.
<br><br>
In fact, the three Bird Masters were already killed by him countless times.
<br><br>
This had been going on for many years. Actually, the Bird Spirit King's thirst for destruction had not been that vigorous recently. He might have gotten tired, or perhaps part of his wish had been satisfied already.
<br><br>
However, the fact remained that his wish was still to destroy everything.
<br><br>
Although the Bird Masters knew that Sheehan wasn't on his right mind, as his subordinates, they had no choice but to stay loyal to him. They were even willing to ruin the entire chaos if they had to.
<br><br>
It was because they knew that this was the only way to truly wake their king up.
<br><br>
"I can't sit idly by! They have caused my people to suffer. I will kill them all if that's what I need to do," Sheehan muttered in his sleep.
<br><br>
"We can do that ourselves. We're also Treacherous Beings that could revive repeatedly. Please, my king, let us handle this," Lawler pleaded.
<br><br>
The truth was the Bird Spirit Sect was already in great trouble, but Lawler still chose to hide it from Sheehan.
<br><br>
"Those snake spirits are getting closer and closer!" Sheehan suddenly raised his head and looked straight ahead in the direction of the Wine Basin. "He has appeared. He finally dares to come for me!" Sheehan's expression changed drastically.
<br><br>
He got so excited that there was a huge smile on his face while still emitting strong killing intent.
<br><br>
The light purple gleam on his every feather began to shine brightly.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! He gradually raised his head and body.
<br><br>
The hard diamond-shaped feathers collided with each other, producing a sound likened to a handful of shells banging together. It was both crisp and harsh.
<br><br>
Although the golden nest was still quite far from the battlefield, his eyes were already focused on the image of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Sheehan only had one wish.
<br><br>
What he wanted the most was to kill Cornelius and then crush the whole world to ruin.
<br><br>
One could only imagine how cruel and desperate he had been before he died.
<br><br>
"My king! Please listen to us. You can't act rashly!"
<br><br>
"This is the Snake Spirit King's ploy. He wants to lure you out!"
<br><br>
"You mustn't go out right now."
<br><br>
The three Bird Masters were extremely anxious as they pleaded before their king.
<br><br>
However, because Sheehan was still unconscious, he wasn't able to think clearly. The words of the three Bird Masters fell into deaf ears.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! Sheehan had no intention to stop now.
<br><br>
Streaks of purple light danced around his wings, and the surrounding space twisted and cooperated in his every move.
<br><br>
Swoosh! In an instant, the three Bird Masters were left there as the Bird Spirit King disappeared. He only left streaks of purple lights that extended towards the battlefield in the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
Chapter 4156 The Fastest Speed Among the four sect leaders, the Bird Spirit King Sheehan was the fastest.
<br><br>
He also had the most profound understanding of space.
<br><br>
To the creatures of the main world, the Deep Space was an obscure and incomprehensible area.
<br><br>
Many of them, including those of the Four Spirits Sect, had entered and explored the Deep Space. However, only Sheehan could explore it easily and effortlessly.
<br><br>
He had once reached the unreachable depths of the Deep Space, making him the only one who could bring back the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King observed Sheehan's every move through the Limited Omnipotent Stone and he saw him flap his wings. "Sheehan is going to make a move," he warned.
<br><br>
But Sheehan was too fast. Even if the Snake Spirit King watched his movement, he couldn't do anything to stop him. There was always a way to deflate other theurgies, but the winner was defined by speed.
<br><br>
After the Snake Spirit King's alert, Sewell stood on guard. The next moment, they noticed wisps of purple light.
<br><br>
Sewell felt a slight chill as a wisp of purple light swept past his body. He then saw a huge bird's claw appear in front of him.
<br><br>
The claw disappeared quickly before his eyes. Sewell blinked, uncertain whether it was a phantom or not.
<br><br>
At the next minute, an unforeseen force pressed down on them.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Three crevices of tens of thousands of feet long imprinted around Sewell.
<br><br>
These were Sheehan's claw print. Sewell was then crushed into the depths of the ground, breaking his body into several pieces.
<br><br>
Despite the ghastly power of Sheehan's claw, it couldn't kill a Treacherous Being without the help of the Light of Annihilation. Sewell's broken body parts wriggled like earthworms. They moved towards each other and slowly reconnected into a whole.
<br><br>
Sewell couldn't avoid Sheehan's claw, neither could the Snake Spirit King beside him.
<br><br>
After all, Sheehan's target was the Snake Spirit King. The purple light wrapped the Snake Spirit King and a strong force clashed unto him—it was Sheehan's huge body.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! Because of the impact, the Snake Spirit King recoiled in the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
The high water splashed into an enormous wave because of the Snake Spirit King's weight.
<br><br>
After the Snake Spirit King retreated a full distance of about forty thousand feet, he stopped rolling as his thick snake tail pierced into the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
As a snake, he was weak in battle.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The purple light shone brighter from above. Sheehan slowly descended from the sky, revealing his complete figure.
<br><br>
An overwhelming aura was released from Sheehan's body. His dark eyes reflected indescribable hatred from within.
<br><br>
"Cornelius. You finally dare to come. I have been waiting for you,"
<br><br>
Sheehan said through a loud and thunderous voice.
<br><br>
The high frequency made the water in the whole Wine Basin vibrate, producing a series of ripples.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King raised his body and silently stared at Sheehan. He felt his opponent's undisguised intent of killing him.
<br><br>
Within the four sects, the Monkey Spirit Sect was reckless and aggressive, the Human Spirit Sect was proficient in studying, and the Bird Spirit Sect was noble and peace-loving. Sheehan treated Kincaid, Cornelius, and Orlando as good friends.
<br><br>
Even as the internal conflict of the Four Spirits Sect became fiercer through time, Sheehan still tried to maintain peace and order.
<br><br>
He naively believed that as long as he tried his best, the four sects would be as united as they were at the beginning, and that they would altogether fight off one powerful race after another.
<br><br>
In the Four Spirits Sect, Sheehan made the greatest contributions. He found the ancestry-level bloodline which was deemed to be the Four Spirits Sect's foundation, but he never claimed credit for himself or became arrogant. Instead, he selflessly offered his help.
<br><br>
But his goodwill didn't bring peace, but more serious disputes.
<br><br>
What he didn't expect was the Snake Spirit King would want to destroy not only the entire Four Spirits Sect but also the main world.
<br><br>
When he entered the chaos and found out that the Snake Spirit King was to blame, Sheehan sank into hopelessness. He was overwhelmed by desperation as everything he upheld was shattered.
<br><br>
This world was so ugly. The only way to purify it was to ruin everything.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King needed to pay the highest price! The purple light once again beamed from Sheehan's body. The area formed by the light belonged to him.
<br><br>
This was the case in the chaos, the main world, and even the Deep Space.
<br><br>
The space rules he conceived could be used in the spaces of all levels. His talent was indeed unimaginable.
<br><br>
Splash! Sheehan disappeared again after the purple light circled the Snake Spirit King's body.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! With two muffled sounds, Sheehan's sharp claw had quietly gripped the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He flew to the other side of the Wine Basin grasping onto the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
When these two huge creatures flew over the Wine Basin, their figures became invisible from anyone on the battlefield. Even Sewell who watched the Bird Spirit King was clueless about where they went.
<br><br>
The battlefield in the Wine Basin was located in the southernmost area of the Jade Pure Realm. After flying at an incredible speed, Sheehan then landed at the edge of the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he tossed the Snake Spirit King out of the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Sheehan wished to destroy everything. The simplest way to kill the Snake Spirit King was to throw him into the Void Dust so that he would be swallowed alive.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! Even as a Treacherous Being, the Snake Spirit King couldn't escape the devouring power of the Void Dust.
<br><br>
The huge body of the Snake Spirit King squirmed desperately in the Void Dust, but after struggling for a while, he was consumed completely.
<br><br>
After he was annihilated, Sheehan's brutal stare weakened a little.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was his biggest enemy, but killing him was not enough to satisfy him.
<br><br>
Sheehan flapped his wings and the purple light floated to the other side.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to follow it, a ball suddenly appeared not far away.
<br><br>
The ball rapidly expanded, producing a set of golden coordinates.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King slowly broke out from the golden coordinates. The Limited Omnipotent Stone on his forehead remained intact. After he emerged, the ball engulfed the golden coordinates and disappeared.
<br><br>
"You... You didn't die?" Sheehan's eyes widened with confusion.
<br><br>
"Hiss! You are stupid because you haven't awakened." The Snake Spirit King shook his head mockingly.
<br><br>
To kill Treacherous Beings once and for all, their coordinates had to be destroyed. It was not a secret in the Jade Pure Realm, but Sheehan seemed to know nothing about it.
<br><br>
"Well then, I'll kill you over and over until you finally die!" Sheehan roared, once again overcome by killing intent.
<br><br>
Chapter 4157 The Source Of Curse Sheehan's plan was simple.
<br><br>
His objective was to kill Cornelius, so from the very beginning, he focused on him alone, locking him as his target.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Half of the sky was overlaid with the dispersed purple light.
<br><br>
In the purple zone, Sheehan was nearly indestructible. This was his game.
<br><br>
No one would be able to calculate his movements, what more to counter them.
<br><br>
Just now, Sheehan did not fly over the long distance when he took the Snake Spirit King to the edge, nor did he open a space channel. He just disappeared from a place and reappeared at another place. To Sheehan, it was quite simple, but to the others, it was incomprehensible.
<br><br>
With Sheehan's unpredictable movements, there was no way for anyone to be able to locate where he was or to determine when to strike. Within the purple light, he was moving too fast.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, Sheehan disappeared once again.
<br><br>
Cornelius, the Snake Spirit King, felt his body tremble, and then, before he was able to react, he was lifted into the air and then thrown into the Void Dust again. It all happened too fast.
<br><br>
Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...
<br><br>
Just like that, Cornelius was completely devoured by the Void Dust, leaving nothing behind, Then the ball that wrapped around his coordinates appeared again.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for Sheehan, the ball appeared outside of the purple light.
<br><br>
He knew he had to get the ball, but if he were to step outside of the light, he would put himself in danger.
<br><br>
As he extended his wings, the purple light extended as well, reaching for the ball.
<br><br>
He treated the light as if it were a part of his body. If he were able to move it far enough to meet the ball, he would be able to claim it without breaking a sweat.
<br><br>
However, as the light inched closer to the ball, something strange happened.
<br><br>
The ball avoided the light. If the light flew towards the ball, the ball would fly even further from it. The two moved at the same speed, making it nearly impossible for the two to meet.
<br><br>
After the nearly hundred-mile-chase, the Snake Spirit King emerged from the ball.
<br><br>
As soon as this happened, Sheehan immediately began his attack, once again enveloping the Snake Spirit King with the light and throwing him into the Void Dust.
<br><br>
However, this time, it was different. Even though the Snake Spirit King was still struggling, his beady, crescent-shaped eyes were telling a different story—one of vengeance. Little did Sheehan know that a threeheaded snake was crawling at his back.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was not stupid. From the very beginning, he knew that with Sheehan's abilities, especially in terms of speed, he would not be able to compete.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King had all the resources he needed, but he knew he didn't need to exhaust all that to defeat Sheehan. A Holy Item could do it for him.
<br><br>
The three-headed snake, which was named the Source of Curse, was the second Holy Item in the Snake Spirit King's collection.
<br><br>
It had long been in his collection and had been used by him for a long time. The Source of Curse was able to put three curse marks on three targets. As long as the opponent killed one of the targets, from the back of the opponent would emerge a three-headed snake.
<br><br>
The twist was only the Snake Spirit King could see the three-headed snake; it was invisible to anyone else, even to the one who carried it.
<br><br>
Whenever the carrier would kill one of the targets, one of the snake's head would open its eyes. This went on until the carrier killed three targets to open all of the heads' eyes. Once all of the eyes were open, the threeheaded snake would be in full effect, controlling its carrier.
<br><br>
In the past, when the Snake Spirit King used the Source of Curse, he would have to sacrifice three snake spirits.
<br><br>
In this situation, as the Snake Spirit King revived himself in the form of the Treacherous Being, he would be able to sacrifice himself three times to fully activate his curse.
<br><br>
Hiss, hiss, hiss...
<br><br>
The three-headed snake snapped all of its eyes open.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Sheehan began to feel something strange appearing behind him. His resting wings sprung up, trembling with unusual vigor.
<br><br>
Against his will, he kept flying in the purple light. Eventually, his body began to leap crazily in all sorts of directions.
<br><br>
As the flying speed of Sheehan increased, the Snake Spirit King saw countless figures flashing within the purple light. He stared at them, realizing they were neither illusions nor shadows. These figures were all Sheehan, who, in the high speed of flight, appeared to the ordinary eye as multiple bodies. The Snake Spirit King laughed manically.
<br><br>
"It's useless, Sheehan. Whatever you do, you won't be able to get rid of the Source of Curse," he said, sadistically amused with what he was seeing.
<br><br>
The way the Source of Curse operated was reminiscent of a blooming flower. The more Sheehan struggled, the more it thrived, spreading its power further and even greater within its host. As it physically exhausted Sheehan and sucked all of his power out, it grew stronger and stronger.
<br><br>
Eventually, it had completely entangled Sheehan.
<br><br>
The purple light shrank, and Sheehan fell from the air, grasping for his breath.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King looked at him mockingly and smiled down on him condescendingly. "You are so pitiful..." "Throw him into the Void Dust,"
<br><br>
he commanded, with no ounce of mercy.
<br><br>
Usually, even without the Spiritual Boat, Sheehan would be able to sail through the Void Dust with the help of his large and powerful wings.
<br><br>
However, with the Source of Curse sucking all of his power dry, he wouldn't be able to help himself, leaving him to be devoured by the Void Dust.
<br><br>
Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...
<br><br>
Soon, Sheehan's Treacherous Being body was dragged by the Snake Spirit King's three-headed snake and thrown into the Void Dust.
<br><br>
After that, the battle between the Bird Spirit King and the Snake Spirit King finally ended.
<br><br>
"The Limited Omnipotent Stone," the Snake Spirit King muttered.
<br><br>
The diamond-shaped gem etched onto his forehead began to glow, and he began to see everything in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
To protect Sheehan, the Bird Spirit Sect hid his coordinates.
<br><br>
However, in the Three Purities Stage, there were only a few things that could avoid the Limited Omnipotent Stone. One of them was the bubble of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
Having activated the Limited Omnipotent Stone, the Snake Spirit King was made aware of where Sheehan's coordinates was hidden. He immediately went to the ground, running towards the battlefield in the Wine Basin.
<br><br>
In the middle rear of the battlefield were the three Bird Masters of the Bird Spirit Sect, Lawler, Duran, and Orval, fighting fiercely against Sewell.
<br><br>
At first, the three Bird Masters followed behind the Bird Spirit King, trying to protect him from danger, but the Bird Spirit King was simply too fast. They were unable to catch up with him. By the time they arrived at the Bird Spirit King's destination, they had found that he already disappeared with the Snake Spirit King, leaving only Sewell.
<br><br>
Because they were so worried about Sheehan's safety, even though they did not want to, they fought Sewell, forcing him to tell them where the Bird Spirit King went.
<br><br>
The problem was that Sewell did not know where the Bird Spirit King went with the Snake Spirit King. Even if he knew where they were, it would be impossible for him to say it. The battle was already decided for him.
<br><br>
Even Lawler was able to hold Sewell to a draw alone. Moreover, he had the help of Duran and Orval now.
<br><br>
Even though Sewell was trying to keep his composure, under the siege of the three Bird Masters, he could hardly hold on.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Lawler's body was held frozen as if he forgot to breathe.
<br><br>
"Lawler, what's the matter with you?" Duran asked in confusion, worrying for his friend. He had been working with him for so long, but this was the first time he had seen him stunned into immovability.
<br><br>
Lawler gently waved his right wing, revealing the golden coordinates.
<br><br>
When Duran and Orval saw this, their expressions changed drastically, joining that of Lawler's.
<br><br>
"Our king..."
<br><br>
"He has been killed!"
<br><br>
"Has he lost the battle with the Snake Spirit King?"
<br><br>
The three Bird Masters were all in a state of confusion and panic, their distressed voices overlapping each other's questions.
<br><br>
At this time, this was the last thing they wanted to happen.
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit King's strength was not less than the Snake Spirit King's; in this aspect, they probably equaled each other. To think of Sheehan dying was unacceptable to them, but the result was not that shocking to them as he had not awakened and the Snake Spirit King possessed the Holy Items.
<br><br>
What shocked them more was the short period wherein this happened.
<br><br>
While the three Bird Masters were stirring in their sad air, Sewell, on the other hand, was overcome with joy. He had been continuously defeated, but seeing this was more than enough to provide him with great courage.
<br><br>
His body suddenly sprung up into the sky, flying towards the coordinates on Lawler's wing.
<br><br>
If the coordinates were destroyed, the Bird Spirit King would completely perish. Because of this, Lawler, despite his extreme sadness, carried on, doing his best to protect it from Sewell.
<br><br>
As Sewell went for his wing, Lawler withdrew it, soaring higher into the sky.
<br><br>
However, as he was about to shoot higher up in the air, a huge shadow enveloped him.
<br><br>
Chapter 4158 Bring A Message Although Lawler's reaction was fast, he was still nowhere near the Snake Spirit King's level.
<br><br>
Before he could even think to dodge, the Snake Spirit King's tail had already hit him square on the chest.
<br><br>
Boom! A huge hole appeared on the Wine Basin as Lawler's body was shattered into pieces and the set of golden coordinates hidden under his wing was exposed.
<br><br>
Duran and Orval exchanged looks and quickly spread their wings to rush towards the golden coordinates.
<br><br>
Their loyalty to their king was absolute and they would do everything to protect him.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! However, before the two Bird Masters could even get close, the Snake Spirit King had already lashed at them.
<br><br>
Their hearts dropped to see the Snake Spirit King's long tail snatch the set of golden coordinates from Lawler. To their horror, he immediately put it into his mouth.
<br><br>
Ordinary people wouldn't be able to destroy coordinates so easily and often needed a special space hammer to do so.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King was no ordinary person. "My kindest and most honest friend," he muttered with the golden coordinates in his mouth, "goodbye."
<br><br>
Just as he bit down, a black light suddenly flashed ten feet away from his tail.
<br><br>
As this black light reached him, the Snake Spirit King instantly stiffened in fear.
<br><br>
Buzz! To his absolute horror, the black light continued to spread and move along his body.
<br><br>
Treacherous Beings did not have bones, neither did those at the Snake Spirit King's level but this black light outlined his spine and skull clearly.
<br><br>
"We can't kill Sheehan," the Snake Spirit King suddenly declared.
<br><br>
Sewell frowned in displeasure. "Why not?!"
<br><br>
"Because he is still useful," the Snake Spirit King replied.
<br><br>
"He'll ruin our plans!" Sewell pointed out.
<br><br>
"Just do as I say!"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King spat out the golden coordinates he had previously put in his mouth and threw it towards Duran.
<br><br>
Filled with great inertia, the golden coordinates smashed Duran to the ground.
<br><br>
"I..."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was very unwilling to give up and wanted to rush towards the golden coordinates. However, just as he was about to step forward, his body stiffened. He turned around and promptly left the battlefield.
<br><br>
This left Sewell, Duran, Orval, and Lawler gaping in astonishment. They absolutely had no idea what just happened.
<br><br>
"My king! My king!"
<br><br>
Sewell shouted as he followed after the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"Retreat."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's order was concise and demanded to be followed.
<br><br>
Sewell, however, was still unwilling and shook his head.
<br><br>
"We can annihilate the whole Bird Spirit Sect at this point. We can't stop now. We have to..."
<br><br>
However, before he could finish his words, the Snake Spirit King shot him a cold glare and silenced him. "Do you dare disobey me?"
<br><br>
As the second most important figure in their sect, Sewell was someone who served the Snake Spirit King with the utmost loyalty and devotion.
<br><br>
This was probably the most serious warning his superior gave him.
<br><br>
Sewell opened his mouth as his gut clenched in fear. "I... I dare not," he stammered in response before issuing the order to retreat.
<br><br>
Almost all the Treacherous Beings on both sides had been killed. Even if Sewell did not give the order, the Treacherous Beings would still return after they died.
<br><br>
Thus, the fierce battle in the Jade Pure Realm ended in such a strange, abrupt manner.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Divine Bell City of the Ruin Graveyard, the bell began to ring.
<br><br>
This was a constant thing that happened once a month and everyone at the Other Shore Realm buzzed with excitement.
<br><br>
Soon, many Other Shore Realm warriors began to ring the bell.
<br><br>
Rocher was the most eye-catching one.
<br><br>
The fact that he made it to the thirty-second floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower was amazing and shocked the entire Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
With this feat, he suddenly became everyone's hope to reach the top.
<br><br>
After he managed to obtain the Monta Stone, his cultivation speed increased exponentially and he was able to reach the thirty-second floor quickly. He now set out to challenge the thirty-third floor.
<br><br>
Dong! After a long and melodious ring, he once again sat under the divine bell.
<br><br>
Rocher closed his eyes and entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
He liked the tower's atmosphere very much and every time he entered, he felt a great sense of joy. Rocher had the impression that the owner was an incredibly optimistic person.
<br><br>
However, when he entered, he sensed a subtle change in the air. It felt more dignified and solemn.
<br><br>
Rocher couldn't help but take note of this change. 'Is it because I've reached the top?' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
He was already on the thirty-third floor and his eyes were already fixated on the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
The atmosphere in the tower made him straighten his back more.
<br><br>
Rocher's suspicions were correct. There was indeed a dignified presence within the tower. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and his four disciples had gathered in the tower to watch him.
<br><br>
"Let Rocher get that sword," Dale said.
<br><br>
Arthur nodded. "I agree."
<br><br>
Justin was quick to affirm, "I also have no objections."
<br><br>
"It's all up to you, Master," Derrick said.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded. "Back then, there was something wrong with the Lone Sword but Geoffrey was able to repair it.
<br><br>
He was able to connect the sword to the eleventh stair and make it so much more powerful. Are you all sure that you won't regret it if Rocher gets it?"
<br><br>
There was no hesitation at all as the four disciples shook their heads.
<br><br>
They'd been trapped in this bubble for so long and their ambitions had long since evaporated into thin air.
<br><br>
"I won't regret it," Dale confirmed. "We've deliberately trained Rocher and guided him to the thirty-third floor precisely for him to obtain this sword."
<br><br>
"Geoffrey is still in the main world though and there is still no news of him. What if he tries to deliver a message through the sword?" Arthur asked. To be fair, he had a point.
<br><br>
However, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had already prepared for that possibility and showed them a blood-red, jade pendant in his hand.
<br><br>
His disciples' expressions changed when they saw the pendant on his palm. "That's the Blood Soul Jade Pendant," Dale muttered in a low voice.
<br><br>
This pendant was formed by the bloodline of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and nurtured by him for many years. It was an avatar he created and the power it contained was comparable to his own.
<br><br>
"Summon a soul and I'll integrate your souls into the Lone Sword," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord told them.
<br><br>
"Why, Master?" Justin asked. They absolutely had no idea why their master would make such an arrangement.
<br><br>
A soul normally served as a back-up plan during a huge crisis but they'd been safe in this bubble for so long now.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's face became serious. "Since Dale came back, I've been uneasy because our location has already been exposed."
<br><br>
"But the bubble can't be tracked. We've already changed our location and Arthur's already swallowed up the metal-devouring beast," Justin said, perfectly assured of their safety.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord could only sigh, "I know but I've been so uneasy these days. Just leave your souls in case something happens."
<br><br>
Though they did not know what their master was worried about, the four disciples still did as he asked and summoned their souls to drill into the jade pendant.
<br><br>
Their master then reached out and hung the pendant onto the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
The moment it was placed upon the sword, the jade pendant changed into blood threads that attached themselves onto the blade and seeped into the steel.
<br><br>
Rocher couldn't see nor hear them. He also had no idea of what had just happened when the jade pendant integrated itself onto the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
Compared to the last time he saw it, the Lone Sword's aura had changed and the energy that emanated from it was extremely astonishing. It was no longer the broken weapon that exuded no aura. It seemed like a proper, powerful weapon now.
<br><br>
Rocher felt it but couldn't figure out how it happened. However, he remained very interested in the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The big bell in the Divine Bell City began to tremble intermittently. Time was almost up.
<br><br>
With a smile on his face, Rocher reached out and grasped the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
Once the sound stopped, he would automatically leave the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
However, when he turned around, he found an old, sage-like man in front of him.
<br><br>
His first instinct was to ask this man for identification. "Who are..."
<br><br>
However, he changed his mind halfway. "Are you the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower?" Rocher asked.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded.
<br><br>
"Did you show up because I reached the top?" he asked. Rocher wasn't that surprised at the owner's appearance.
<br><br>
In fact, he figured that it was only a matter of time before this happened.
<br><br>
However, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shook his head. "I want you to deliver a message to Mike."
<br><br>
Rocher's eyes widened. "Bring a message to Holy Mike?"
<br><br>
It wasn't easy for him to reach the thirty-third floor yet when he got there, the owner of the tower suddenly appeared and asked him to deliver a message to Zen's father. What exactly was going on? Rocher shook his head. He shouldn't think about it too much right now.
<br><br>
"What's the message?" he asked.
<br><br>
A small butterfly appeared upon the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's hand.
<br><br>
He tossed it and Rocher watched it fly down and land on the eighth floor.
<br><br>
"Let Mike ring the bell and enter the tower to bear this butterfly," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord instructed.
<br><br>
Chapter 4159 Something Arthur Shouldn't Eat Rocher was still in a daze, even as he left the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
'Reaching the top was no easy task... As the owner of the tower, shouldn't he congratulate me or assign me some tasks? He could have at least revealed the truth of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, or the significance of the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
He didn't even reward me somehow.
<br><br>
Instead, he just asked me to deliver a message to Holy Mike. Why?' Rocher pondered in silent misery.
<br><br>
By the time he had come to his senses, he found himself under the big bell.
<br><br>
Everyone in the Divine Bell City watched him expectantly.
<br><br>
Rocher had never disappointed them before. He was outstanding in all he did in the Divine Bell City. This time, he'd reached the top. Everyone's eyes were fixed on him.
<br><br>
"Rocher, did you succeed?" Bromley, who was standing nearby, asked with concern.
<br><br>
Rocher glanced at his inner world briefly then nodded. "The sword is already in my inner world."
<br><br>
Splash! Although they had expected this, the crowd still burst into an uproar.
<br><br>
"Finally, Rocher has reached the top!"
<br><br>
"Rocher, did you try climbing outside of the tower to see what it's like?"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Everyone bombarded him with questions, barely giving him room to respond.
<br><br>
Bromley waved his hand, and everyone immediately shut up. "Go to cultivate in seclusion and bear the sword."
<br><br>
Only after the Other Shore Token was carried in one's inner world and a real link was established could one truly own it.
<br><br>
Rocher nodded and stood up, eyeing Mike in the group.
<br><br>
Even though Mike was a Holy Being in the divine land, he still had to line up to ring the bell in the Divine Bell City.
<br><br>
"Holy Mike," Rocher greeted, bowing courteously.
<br><br>
Mike bowed back politely. "What's the matter?"
<br><br>
"Are you going to challenge the ninth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower this time?" Rocher asked warily.
<br><br>
Mike nodded. "Yes, I want to reach the ninth floor."
<br><br>
Rocher was a creature born in Mike's inner world, and later on, he was reborn. In a short period of time, he had become a consummate True God, and after entering the Ruin Graveyard, he had even reached the thirtythird floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Mike was still at the eighth floor, which was equivalent to the eighth stage of the Other Shore Realm. As a Holy Being of the divine land, he was lagging behind.
<br><br>
Of course, Mike wasn't an isolated case. The other Holy Beings, except Bromley, were in even worse situations.
<br><br>
Moreover, Rocher was only able to reach the thirty-third floor thanks to the help of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and Dale. However, Rocher wasn't aware of this; no one was. Everyone was just under the impression that Rocher was extremely talented.
<br><br>
"When I reached the thirty-third floor, an old man appeared," Rocher said seriously.
<br><br>
Beside them, Bromley, Holy Jay, and many other humans exchanged strange glances.
<br><br>
Mike's eyes flashed. "Is he the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower?"
<br><br>
Mike had learned more about the Other Shore from his wife, Lorena. He knew that even in the Source World, it was not easy to become a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm. Among all the members of the Nine Li race, only Chiyou had been to Stage Thirty-three on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In everyone's eyes, the Mysterious Yellow Tower was like a completely independent Other Shore. They could only imagine how powerful its owner must be! "He said he was," Rocher answered with a nod.
<br><br>
The expressions of Mike, Bromley, Holy Jay and the others changed slightly. "What did that old man say?" Bromley asked.
<br><br>
Bromley was now a member of top management of the Ruin Graveyard, but he knew very little about it. In fact, even the natives of the Ruin Graveyard didn't know much about it.
<br><br>
"He asked Holy Mike to go to the eighth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower and bear a butterfly-like Other Shore Token," Rocher replied gravely.
<br><br>
Hearing this answer, Bromley, Mike and Holy Jay all scratched their heads in confusion.
<br><br>
"The eighth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower?" Mike frowned. "I remember that among the four hundred Other Shore Tokens on the eighth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, none of them looks like a butterfly."
<br><br>
"The old man just put it there," Rocher replied.
<br><br>
Mike's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
Since it was put there by the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, it must be extraordinary.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Realm warriors who had been waiting in line in the Divine Bell City stepped to the side, clearing a path for Mike.
<br><br>
He rang the bell firmly, then went into the Mysterious Yellow Tower and quickly found the butterfly.
<br><br>
After bringing the butterfly back to the Divine Bell City, Mike could barely contain his excitement. He couldn't wait to bear it! This was a new Other Shore Token! However, when he tried activating the butterfly's ability after he bore it, he found that the butterfly was pitifully weak. It only had about ten divine megatons of force, and it had no other special ability.
<br><br>
"What's the use of this Other Shore Token?" Mike said sulkily.
<br><br>
The butterfly floated alone in the air above Mike's Evolutionary Universe.
<br><br>
It was very nimble, but unfortunately, it was indeed quite weak.
<br><br>
Holy Jay, Bromley and Rocher looked at each other in dismay. The butterfly was so much weaker than the Other Shore Tokens on the eighth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
"It's strange. Why must Mike bear this Other Shore Token?" Holy Jay pondered aloud, stroking his beard.
<br><br>
"Since the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower specifically requested it, you have no choice but to bear it now," Bromley said. "He probably has a bigger plan set in motion."
<br><br>
Mike nodded, deciding to shrug off his disappointment for now.
<br><br>
Even if he bore this Other Shore Token, it wouldn't hinder his cultivation.
<br><br>
He could change it when he reached a higher floor in the future.
<br><br>
After a period of time of acceleration, the Pear Hill's speed was now hundreds of times faster than before.
<br><br>
Whenever this giant mountain passed through the chaotic clouds, the clouds rippled outward.
<br><br>
The first destination of the Pear Hill was Zen's primitive land. Second would be the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
With the help of the first butterfly, Zen could sense the location of his primitive land. The second butterfly was brought into the Jade Pure Realm by Dale. Its location had always been very strange, so he could only feel it vaguely.
<br><br>
The moment Mike brought the butterfly back to the Divine Bell City, a clear location showed up in Zen's mind.
<br><br>
Zen, who was still cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes and looked alert.
<br><br>
"The west," he muttered.
<br><br>
In the bubble, when he saw that Mike took the butterfly, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord heaved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
The Lone Sword was the most powerful inheritance in the Mysterious Yellow Tower. That butterfly would lead Zen straight to the Ruin Graveyard! The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded in satisfaction. He had done what he could.
<br><br>
"I wonder how the war between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect is going," said Dale.
<br><br>
Because the bubble's location had been exposed before, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord didn't allow them to observe the war in secret anymore. After all, if they were not careful enough, they could be caught by the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"Since the Bird Spirit King hasn't awakened, he definitely is no match for the Snake Spirit King," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord concluded without thinking about it too much.
<br><br>
"I just hope that the Bird Spirit Sect can hold on..." Arthur said. Rumble! Just then, Arthur's huge stomach grumbled loudly.
<br><br>
"Did you eat something strange?" Dale asked curiously, eyebrows raised.
<br><br>
"You're kidding. I can eat anything," Arthur said with a shrug.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the expression on Arthur's face changed dramatically. His eyes rolled to the back of his head, and only the whites could be seen.
<br><br>
"But not long ago, he ate something that he shouldn't have eaten," Arthur said in a strange voice. "Do you remember that metal-devouring beast? Hahaha..."
<br><br>
Chapter 4160 Invasion Arthur laughed manically. He was exuding a completely different aura. It was the aura of a Treacherous Being! Dale, Derrick, and Justin grew pale.
<br><br>
"Who are you?"
<br><br>
"Get out of Arthur's body!"
<br><br>
"How'd a Treacherous Being get in him?"
<br><br>
They took all precautions when exploring the Jade Pure Realm, knowing full well how dangerous Treacherous Beings could be. They knew Arthur was in a dire situation.
<br><br>
Amid this commotion, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord assessed the situation calmly.
<br><br>
He had been feeling uneasy the past few days, sensing something amiss.
<br><br>
Now he knew why.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being in Arthur's body had mentioned the metaldevouring beast that Arthur had swallowed. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord deduced that coordinates had probably been planted in that creature.
<br><br>
Arthur could devour everything but he couldn't destroy the coordinates.
<br><br>
They had stayed in his stomach.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord strode forward and slapped Arthur's forehead with his hands. Arthur's mouth flew wide open.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord then activated a pill-sized Holy Stone emitting the Light of Annihilation, popping it directly into Arthur's open mouth before quickly snapping it shut.
<br><br>
"Ouch!"
<br><br>
A pained expression crossed Arthur's face. He flailed around wildly, apparently struggling against something the others couldn't see.
<br><br>
The powerful Light of Annihilation was exploding within his body, causing him agony.
<br><br>
The resentment-level and the hatred-level Treacherous Beings could tolerate the Light of Annihilation to some extent, but they were very sensitive to it.
<br><br>
Purr! Unable to bear it any longer, white Treacherous Beings soon emerged from Arthur's ears.
<br><br>
They began to return to their original forms. They were two Snake Masters of the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
One of them was Abel, ranked sixteenth among the Snake Masters. The other one was Holcomb, who ranked seventeenth. They could be considered part of the backbone of their group.
<br><br>
"Haha!" Abel laughed gleefully. "We finally found the rats hiding underground!"
<br><br>
"Hmph! They are too weak. They're not even worth fighting. Otherwise, our king would have already eliminated them," Holcomb said with disdain.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect had already sensed the existence of the bubble, but it had been elusive. The Snake Spirit Sect had tried to locate and capture it several times, but had always failed until now.
<br><br>
Sharp spiked scales began to appear on the surface of Dale's body, adding to his bulk. "Are you here for us? What an honor," he sneered.
<br><br>
With a flick of his hand, Justin took out a huge writing brush from his Sumeru Space. "You've gone through so much trouble to get here. You deserve to rest in peace here, as well!"
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and his disciples had been in the Jade Pure Realm for a long time now. They knew how to deal with Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
There was currently only one thought in their minds. They needed to subdue the two Snake Masters so the bubble's location could never be exposed.
<br><br>
Buzz! Justin swung the huge writing brush. The blue power of space flowed from its tip.
<br><br>
Abel and Holcomb reacted quickly, writhing away. Crescent shaped patterns appeared on the surface of Abel's body.
<br><br>
"Get ready!"
<br><br>
Abel's body flashed with a bright light that engulfed Holcomb.
<br><br>
They became extremely fast, darting around the bubble. They looked like flowing bands of light, leaving long and thin shadows.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
"It's show time!"
<br><br>
Abel and Holcomb then deployed their theurgies.
<br><br>
Single-colored thorns materialized from Abel's body and shot toward the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. Holcomb released sinister icicles which shot out in all directions. The small bubble was filled with freezing cold air.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and his four disciples were all at the Eternal Realm, but they were much stronger than most.
<br><br>
Moreover, Elder Xue had also taught the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord the Blood-controlling Method.
<br><br>
In terms of pure bloodline power, the five were equal to each other in strength.
<br><br>
"You're dead meat!"
<br><br>
Arthur smiled widely.
<br><br>
Circles of threads appeared on the surface of his shiny belly. As they spun out, they formed vortexes in the surrounding space.
<br><br>
The single-colored thorns and icicles fell into them and were quickly sucked into Arthur's stomach.
<br><br>
Dale's body continued transforming. In addition to the spiked scales, his head began to shrink, and his hands turned into claws. He got on all fours and darted forward, giving chase to the two Snake Masters like a moving shadow.
<br><br>
The power of the thorns and icicles was extraordinary. They would have caused serious injuries on ordinary Eternal Realm fighters. But Dale dashed through at high speed, easily dodging them.
<br><br>
The Snake Masters, however, were just as fast, darting here and there as Dale chased after them. An ordinary observer would have seen what looked like three bands of light, one black and two white, shooting about in the bubble. The chase went on for a few moments.
<br><br>
"Dale, take a break! Let me handle this!"
<br><br>
As Justin spoke, he swung his writing brush again.
<br><br>
The writing brush began drawing in the air, as if controlled by a graceful artist. It outlined the figures of the two Snake Masters.
<br><br>
Buzz! Two blue lights flashed, and Abel and Holcomb were suddenly pulled directly in front of Justin.
<br><br>
Derrick, who was beside Justin, had been ready.
<br><br>
He held two runes tightly in his hands. The runes were inlaid with Holy Stones. As soon as Abel and Holcomb appeared in front of them, Derrick wasted no time slapping the runes on them.
<br><br>
Clap! Clap! The runes immediately released the Light of Annihilation on the two Snake Masters' bodies. Their bodies began to tremble violently, as if they were being electrocuted.
<br><br>
Abel and Holcomb struggled to get the runes off, but they were specially made to deal with Treacherous Beings. It wouldn't be that easy.
<br><br>
No matter how hard they struggled, the runes were attached firmly to them.
<br><br>
However, they were hatred-level Treacherous Beings. The ordinary Light of Annihilation could suppress them, but it could not cause them substantial damage.
<br><br>
Justin drew a few strokes on their bodies with the writing brush. The blue power of space turned into a rope, tying them up tightly.
<br><br>
"Arthur, quickly! Find the coordinates in your belly!" Derrick said.
<br><br>
Destroying the coordinates would kill the two Snake Masters once and for all.
<br><br>
Chapter 4161 The Irreversible Downgrade Placing their coordinates in the body of the metal-devouring beast was a big risk for the Snake Masters. These coordinates were, after all, their lifelines.
<br><br>
But Arthur wasn't careful to check himself after swallowing the metaldevouring beast, which gave the two Snake Masters a chance.
<br><br>
At Derrick's warning, Arthur began to look inside his belly, holding it with both hands, trying to look for the two sets of coordinates within his body.
<br><br>
"Master, how's it going on the outside?" Dale asked the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had been lost in thought, but Dale's question shook him out of his reverie.
<br><br>
"It's coming," he said seriously.
<br><br>
"What is coming?" asked Dale.
<br><br>
"The biggest trouble," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord replied.
<br><br>
The fact that the two Snake Masters had appeared in the bubble was causing them the most trouble. Their appearance meant that the bubble's location had already been exposed to the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, trying to control the bubble and move it underground, had sensed that something was wrong.
<br><br>
"The biggest trouble?" Dale said, the corners of his eyes twitching.
<br><br>
This cat and mouse game had gone on in the Jade Pure Realm for many years and had now finally come to an end.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Arthur was still searching for the coordinates in his stomach, a space so large that it had formed a world of its own. It was difficult for any creature to get out of his stomach alive, the only exceptions being the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
But before he could find the coordinates, he heard a muffled sound from above his head. The bubble had cracked open. Sewell and more than ten Snake Masters were making their way in through the crack.
<br><br>
Dale, Derrick, Arthur, and Justin had pumped up, brimming with fighting spirit. They had been of the opinion that as long as they properly handled everything, they could still survive in the bubble.
<br><br>
But their hearts sank at the sight of the Snake Masters.
<br><br>
"Go inside!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shouted at them.
<br><br>
The Mysterious Yellow Tower was emitting a strong gravitational force, sucking the four disciples into it.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had his hands pressed together and continually changed his movements. A faint yellow light appeared on the surface of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, causing it to look like an endless amount of power was accumulating on it.
<br><br>
Sewell coiled in the air, looking down upon the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord below him. His lips were curled in a mocking sneer as he said, "Don't even try to fight back. It won't be of any use."
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord smiled as he said calmly, "I don't think so."
<br><br>
"Letting you go caused me some small troubles. But what's the point of reviving the Monkey Spirit King? The real end is not in this Other Shore,"
<br><br>
Sewell said.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization reported everything important to Sewell, who then sifted through it and reported the most important information of the lot to the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Sewell knew way more than the Snake Spirit King did.
<br><br>
He could guess that these people were probably the reason why the humans had been able to make rapid progress and even awaken the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord laughed, every wrinkle on his face trembling. "Do you think you know the real end? Even Cornelius doesn't! He is stupid."
<br><br>
Sewell sneered and said, "You've been underground for far too long. It looks like you're so scared that you've begun to talk nonsense."
<br><br>
According to the Snake Masters, Cornelius was a wise king.
<br><br>
Right from the internal strife in the Four Spirits Sect to the trap and to the present, he had meticulously planned every step. How could he be called stupid? "Cornelius, I know you're looking at us," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said suddenly.
<br><br>
Sewell's eyes glinted coldly before sharp spines came shooting out of his body in quick succession. He didn't want this old human man to talk nonsense and offend the Snake Spirit King. How dare he call him by his name? Sewell was about to pounce on the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord when a voice sounded in his mind.
<br><br>
"Let him continue."
<br><br>
"But this old man—"
<br><br>
"Calm down. I don't care."
<br><br>
A truly powerful figure wouldn't care about the words of the weak.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King used the Limited Omnipotent Stone to explore everything in the bubble. And now, he wanted to hear what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord wanted to say.
<br><br>
Sewell said to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, "My king allows you to continue."
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord sneered and said, "The Four Spirits Sect has been deceived. You have all been deceived."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Sewell asked, as instructed by the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"The downgrading," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
Sewell's countenance became serious.
<br><br>
He thought that the rats hiding underground had been able to survive for so many years only because they had accidentally obtained the bubble to protect them. What more could they know? "Go on," Sewell continued, his eyes narrowing.
<br><br>
"The downgrading is irreversible," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
The other Snake Masters remained stoic because they didn't know what the downgrading meant.
<br><br>
Sewell, on the other hand, was shaking.
<br><br>
Cornelius had once told him the meaning of downgrading. The chaos and the other secondary worlds were extension of the main world.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect had been able to defeat the other three sects of the Four Spirits Sect because they had planned everything in advance in the chaos, obtained an advantage in the downgraded world, and as a result, won the battle.
<br><br>
Now, the Snake Spirit King's next step was to upgrade. All the members of the Snake Spirit Sect would return to the main world, where the Snake Spirit Sect would rule.
<br><br>
"You are just a creature from the secondary world. You can't even take a single step in the main world, but you dare talk a lot of nonsense! Do you think I believe you?" Sewell sneered again.
<br><br>
"This fraud began when you planted the first Holy Stone and the first holy pillar began to grow. Did any of the secondary worlds you mentioned collapse? Were any of them restored to the main world? Even if the secondary worlds were destroyed completely, they would still exist. Am I right?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord continued.
<br><br>
He had never been to the main world, but had a clear understanding of everything through Elder Xue's dream.
<br><br>
Sewell hesitated yet again, and this time, so did the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Back then, the Four Spirits Sect had built many secondary worlds, a number of which had collapsed. These worlds had been defective, but once they had been built, they would not disappear and would remain there forever.
<br><br>
However, the main world was large. Who would care about these small caves? "They gave you the power to lead you to destruction. Someone from the Bold Conjecture House of the Human Spirit Sect had discovered this, but he was killed before he could send out this news. You, the Snake Spirit Sect, are the stupidest for being willing to be their lackeys!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, his voice rising.
<br><br>
In the past, he had aimed for the completion of the Finale Way. But after he had entered Elder Xue's dream, he discovered that the chaos was much more complicated than he had imagined, and that they needed more than the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Chapter 4162 The Broken Bell During the days of the 77th chaotic era, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the other human heroes had made their judgment.
<br><br>
According to them, it took more than nine million divine megatons of power to complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
That was what they had concluded under certain conditions.
<br><br>
However, such a conclusion turned out to be so rash and childish.
<br><br>
In the next chaotic eras, many ruling creatures still wanted to complete the Finale Way, and the amounts of power they calculated varied.
<br><br>
Among them, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had made an accurate calculation, and at the same time, they figured out that they needed one hundred and sixty million divine megatons of power to do that. The amount of power they calculated was far greater than what the human race had computed.
<br><br>
Still, their result was not comprehensive nor was it the most precise one.
<br><br>
Based on the information Elder Xue had provided, only ten million divine megatons of power was needed to complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
After all, the purpose of restarting the whole chaos and entering a cycle of reincarnation was to provide energy to the four pillars. The process of restarting shouldn't consume too much energy.
<br><br>
The only thing was that the chaos was different from all the other secondary worlds.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect had once transformed the world, and it took a large amount of power to complete the Finale Way. Furthermore, Elder Xue had said that an exceptionally powerful being existed behind the Snake Spirit King, so the energy needed to complete the Finale Way would be equivalent to infinite.
<br><br>
Halfway through Elder Xue's dream, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord already understood that perhaps the only way to stabilize the chaos' situation was to kill the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
That was a nearly desperate answer.
<br><br>
After all, the Snake Spirit King had defeated even the Human Spirit King, the Monkey Spirit King, and the Bird Spirit King. How could the human race or the other races in the secondary world beat him? Those ruling forces that planned to complete the Finale Way didn't know what kind of powerful opponents they were about to face. If only they knew, they surely would not fight at all! However, it was not until the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord finished passing through the dream when he realized that there was a turning point in this matter.
<br><br>
Elder Xue had a way to bear the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
After the disaster in the main world, all the creatures went extinct. None of them, including the Snake Spirit Sect, could return to the main world.
<br><br>
There was only one smooth passageway existing, and it was the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Elder Xue handed over the difficult task to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and asked him to select an Other Shore Realm warrior to obtain the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had already completed the seemingly impossible task.
<br><br>
Even in the face of the Snake Spirit King, he remained calm and composed, and he had already reached his limit! All the Snake Masters were stunned and speechless upon hearing the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's words. Some of them even secretly glanced at Sewell.
<br><br>
Was what the old man had said true? Sewell still stayed in his original posture as he looked down at the human elder below.
<br><br>
A little while later, the Snake Spirit King's voice filled Sewell's mind.
<br><br>
"Kill him."
<br><br>
In turn, Sewell said, "Kill them!"
<br><br>
Swish, swish, swish...
<br><br>
The Snake Masters had prepared for such an event for a long time. Upon Sewell's command, they rushed towards the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord like mad.
<br><br>
Although they appeared eager, they still had doubts in their hearts.
<br><br>
However, they could not question their king's order. They could only hide their doubts, confusion, and even unease in the back of their minds.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's eyes narrowed as he raised his hand.
<br><br>
"Rise!"
<br><br>
Rumble...
<br><br>
The earth cracked as the massive Mysterious Yellow Tower rose from the ground.
<br><br>
"Suppress!"
<br><br>
Boom! As a result, the Mysterious Yellow Tower crushed the Snake Masters, who had rushed to the front, into pieces.
<br><br>
"Light of Annihilation..."
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Then, bright white light enveloped the injured Treacherous Beings. With the help of the Mysterious Yellow Tower's killing power, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord slew several Snake Masters.
<br><br>
"It's just a small trick. Go to hell!"
<br><br>
At that point, Sewell joined the battle, and bone thorns grew all over his body.
<br><br>
In the Divine Bell City At the foot of the big bell sat Augustus in a cross-legged position.
<br><br>
He tried to break through to the twentieth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
A loud, metallic clang filled the space as the bell rang, and he entered the tower.
<br><br>
As soon as he entered, he realized that he had already reached the twentieth floor. He was secretly pleased.
<br><br>
At that moment, however, the Mysterious Yellow Tower shook violently.
<br><br>
He also saw four people above him.
<br><br>
The news that Rocher had seen the owner of the tower already spread, so of course, Augustus knew about it.
<br><br>
Naturally, he wanted to try his luck in the Mysterious Yellow Tower. If he met the owner of the tower, he might be able to get something useful and valuable.
<br><br>
He did not expect that he didn't meet the so-called owner of the tower, but he saw four young men instead.
<br><br>
He croaked, "You..."
<br><br>
The moment he spoke, Dale turned around and glanced at him. He coldly pointed at him and said, "Get out!"
<br><br>
An irresistible force had hit Augustus. His head spun, and then he was sent out of the Mysterious Yellow Tower! The bell still rang, which meant that only half of the time had passed.
<br><br>
When the other warriors at the Other Shore Realm saw that Augustus came out so soon, they thought he had chosen the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"What's wrong, Augustus?"
<br><br>
"Did you get the Other Shore Token on the twentieth floor?"
<br><br>
Bromley and Hallet asked as they came over to him.
<br><br>
Augustus was still in a daze. When he came back to his senses, he shook his head and said, "No."
<br><br>
"Why? You haven't reached the twentieth floor yet?" Bromley asked curiously.
<br><br>
In general, with Augustus' strength, it should be quite safe for him to climb up to the twentieth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
"I saw four people..." Augustus uttered.
<br><br>
"Four!" Hallet was slightly shocked.
<br><br>
"But one of them kicked me out!" Augustus felt wronged and miserable.
<br><br>
He did not even get to speak before they drove him out! A frown crossed Bromley's face. "Aside from the four people, did you see anything else?" he asked.
<br><br>
"The Mysterious Yellow Tower shook so violently that I didn't know anything else," Augustus said and shook his head.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard had many speculations about the Mysterious Yellow Tower. One of those speculations, which Rocher had confirmed, was that the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower was most likely a human being, or at least supported the human race.
<br><br>
It was evident when Bromley had received special care after he went to the Ruin Graveyard, and in the changes after the divine land entered the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
"According to Lorena, the human race is not a powerful force on the Other Shore. They will surely encounter strong enemies. I hope they can get through them safely," Bromley said anxiously.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Realm warriors in the Ruin Graveyard relied on the Mysterious Yellow Tower. If the tower was gone, it would be hard for everyone to progress in their cultivation.
<br><br>
"Let me go there and try," Hallet suggested.
<br><br>
He suspected that Augustus had offended the people in the tower because he spoke too recklessly.
<br><br>
Afterward, Hallet took out his fishing rod and swung it forcefully, about to ring the bell.
<br><br>
But before he touched the big bell, it started to ring.
<br><br>
"Dong!"
<br><br>
The bell let out a strange chime, and even the people outside the Divine Bell City heard it clearly.
<br><br>
In the end, however, the sound became high and sharp. It was so shrill that even the Other Shore Realm warriors couldn't help but cover their ears.
<br><br>
"Dong! Crack!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, the sound stopped.
<br><br>
A crack appeared in the middle of the big bell, and the bell's surface abruptly curled up.
<br><br>
If so many Other Shore Realm warriors hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they would have thought that someone had destroyed the bell.
<br><br>
Chapter 4163 The Burial Land As the Other Shore Realm warriors in the Divine Bell City saw that the big bell was broken, they were all stunned.
<br><br>
They started thinking about who could have done it. It was such an important item for the whole city.
<br><br>
The warriors fell silent, in disbelief of what just happened.
<br><br>
Hallet was the first to speak. "It wasn't me! I didn't ring the bell!" he yelled with sincerity in his eyes.
<br><br>
He knew how significant the big bell was to all the Other Shore Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Thus, he didn't want to be blamed for breaking it.
<br><br>
"You don't have to worry. I saw it. I don't want to sound mean, but you don't have the ability to do that either," Augustus said.
<br><br>
"If no one deliberately destroyed it, then why did it break?"
<br><br>
"What does this mean? Will our cultivation road be cut off?"
<br><br>
"I still want to advance to the upper floors!"
<br><br>
When the Other Shore Realm warriors realized what the consequences of this event entailed, they all went crazy.
<br><br>
Bromley immediately stepped forward and inspected the bell with a serious look in his eyes.
<br><br>
Back when Augustus entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower, he already discovered that something was wrong with it. Then, after he got out, they found out that the big bell was destroyed. It could mean that the Mysterious Yellow Tower was most likely in danger.
<br><br>
"Let me see it."
<br><br>
A nonhuman creature at the Other Shore Realm walked towards the bell and also inspected it.
<br><br>
He was from one of the large races in the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Not only the human race but also other races would definitely be affected by what happened to the big bell. So, all of them expressed concern and thought of a way to fix it.
<br><br>
The creature stood in front of the bell with his hands hanging down and head raised. This was his way of cultivation.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! A burst of green light suddenly came out above his head. As he recited the Truth of Godly Way silently, he slammed his hands on the big bell.
<br><br>
Bang! The bell made a deafening sound that reverberated throughout the city.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The green light on the head of the creature began to dim. When it completely dissipated, he shook his head and said, "It's no use. I couldn't enter."
<br><br>
"Then, it's really broken?"
<br><br>
"Is there no way to fix it?"
<br><br>
"What should we do now?!"
<br><br>
The Other Shore Realm warriors couldn't help but complain loudly.
<br><br>
After the creature attempted to enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower through the broken bell, several others also rushed and tried, but they too failed.
<br><br>
Even so, the creatures in the Ruin Graveyard refused to give up.
<br><br>
Several races began to gather human masters to try and find a way to repair the bell.
<br><br>
They did the simplest and most direct method. The human race formed a group of skilled craftsmen from the divine land to straighten the edge of the bell and carefully fill the gap with metal.
<br><br>
After working for three whole days and nights, they managed to return the bell to its original state. Then, they tried ringing it again.
<br><br>
To make sure that the bell wasn't going to break again, they made a cultivator at the first stage of the Other Shore Realm do it.
<br><br>
Clang! Clang! Clang! The bell seemed to have been repaired physically, but it didn't make the same sound as before. Furthermore, the cultivator who rang the bell still couldn't enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
At that moment, that was when all their hopes began shattering. They realized that they couldn't repair it anymore.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, at the Heavenly Square City in the Jade Pure Realm, the Snake Spirit King was having a conversation with the black light.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's long tail extended in front of him, and the black light that was embedded in his tail constantly flickered.
<br><br>
"So why didn't you even let him finish what he was saying?" the Snake Spirit King asked in a nonchalant tone.
<br><br>
"Why would I? His words were meaningless," the black light responded.
<br><br>
Its voice came from within the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"Then, is the secondary world really irreversible?" the Snake Spirit King asked again, trying to confirm what he heard.
<br><br>
"Didn't I already show you? You would rather believe the words of a mere human?" The black light returned the question.
<br><br>
"If it is reversible, then why do we have to wait for so long? More than a thousand chaotic eras have already passed. Even if we calculate that time with the method in main world, it is still more than enough. What now? Are you planning to wait until the next chaotic era?" the Snake Spirit King asked with a serious face.
<br><br>
Previously, he wouldn't dare to talk back like this to the black light. He didn't even have the guts to ask about its origin.
<br><br>
After all, he owed everything that he had to the black light. Moreover, at any moment, it could also take all of them away.
<br><br>
According to their original plan, the Snake Spirit King still needed to wait for a long time.
<br><br>
However, he started harboring doubts after all the recent troublesome events. Also, one major factor that contributed to this was how the black light didn't allow him to kill the Bird Spirit King yet.
<br><br>
With all these things happening, he grew more impatient. He realized that he couldn't delay their plan any longer.
<br><br>
Understanding how Cornelius was currently feeling, the black light fell silent for a moment and eventually said, "I'll give you the permission to open the Burial Land. Then, I will light up the black lamp and upgrade."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's eyes suddenly dilated as they flashed with golden lights. This was exactly what he wanted. This was what he wanted to hear from the black light.
<br><br>
According to their original plan, the Snake Spirit King had instructed the Element Spirit Civilization to support the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and other known powerful races to completely control the Source World. Once they completed the Purge Way, he could wait patiently, as long as the chaos was already under his control.
<br><br>
However, now that the Evil God had mastered the Godly Ways Great Unity, and the Source World fell under his control, their situation became extremely complicated. There was no way that their plan was going to go smoothly now.
<br><br>
"All right. I'll go ahead and open Burial Land," the Snake Spirit King said without any hesitation in his eyes.
<br><br>
In the entire chaos, there were two infamous dangerous places. The first one was the Ruin Graveyard, and the other one was the Burial Land.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful a creature was, once they entered the two places, they wouldn't be able to leave alive.
<br><br>
Coincidentally, both places were in the depths of the chaos. For some races that lived in the chaos, they would sometimes accidentally enter these places not knowing that they would be trapped there forever. But most creatures would not leave the Source World. In this case, they wouldn't accidentally stumble in these places, so these places only existed in legends.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Looked from afar, the Burial Land appeared like a triangular piece of land. Its surface was dark cyan, and it quietly drifted slowly in the chaos.
<br><br>
The Burial Land was supposed to be a huge land mass, but with over a thousand kinds of savage races that lived there, it was still very crowded.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a group of red-eyed black birds flew across the black sky.
<br><br>
They had just finished hunting for their prey, and the strong smell of blood still lingered on their sharp claws. After finishing their meal, they planned to return to their lair.
<br><br>
However, just when they were about to get back, thin claws suddenly clutched on their necks at lightning speed. In an instant, their heads were decapitated and their blood was squeezed out of their bodies.
<br><br>
Splash! Streams of blood dripped from the sky.
<br><br>
On the ground, there were creatures restlessly waiting with their huge mouths opened wide. They devoured all the blood that poured on them while roaring in excitement.
<br><br>
This was a cruel and bloody world.
<br><br>
However, even in this kind of chaotic land, a rule was still in place.
<br><br>
All of these savage races could fight each other in a barbaric way, but no one should dare to provoke the snake-shaped statue that was located at the center of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Anyone who even just dared to approach the said statue would be instantly killed, and there had never been an exception in the countless years since its establishment.
<br><br>
As time went by, the races living in the land deemed the area as a restricted one. No one ever tried to get close to it because it was already tested. What was the use of caring about the statue's origin if one would already be killed immediately after? That was how the Burial Land went on. But today, the statue suddenly moved on its own.
<br><br>
The black snake left its spot and writhed down on the ground like a living creature.
<br><br>
"I have never interfered with this place since the moment it was created.
<br><br>
But I didn't expect it to be in such a chaotic state!"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King swept his gaze across the area and was instantly vexed by the strong smell of blood throughout the land.
<br><br>
He then controlled the black snake to soar into the sky. As it stopped in midair, a bright red light was released from its eyes. A powerful spiritual sense spread out through the red light that enveloped the entire Burial Land.
<br><br>
Chapter 4164 The Black Lamp There were over a thousand savage races in the Burial Land yet none of them knew what had just happened.
<br><br>
These barbaric races feared nothing yet that sudden burst of terrifying will had them trembling in their boots.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
With the arrival of thunder was a booming voice that spread across the land.
<br><br>
Three streaks of white lightning appeared at the edge of the world and all creatures that were unfortunate enough to have been struck died instantly before they could even scream.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Snake Spirit King's voice spoke to the world.
<br><br>
"Do you want strength?" he asked. His voice was encompassing and made even the strongest hearts tremble.
<br><br>
Though these savage races were currently in panic, the sheer worship and devotion in their eyes were unmistakable. This black snake's power was truly something divine.
<br><br>
'I also want that type of power....' 'We can control everything with such level of power!' 'This invincible force can make me strong!' The Snake Spirit King's offer filled everyone with excitement and fighting spirit.
<br><br>
"I want strength! I want power!"
<br><br>
"Master! Grant upon us such power!"
<br><br>
"I will pursue this path towards greatness no matter the cost..."
<br><br>
Their enthusiastic response did not surprise the Snake Spirit King. In fact, he expected it.
<br><br>
This world was devoid of morality and order and these savage races only knew slaughter. They would do anything if it meant more power.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
From the place where the three streaks of white lightning intersected formed a snake-shaped totem. It was so big and dazzling that it could be seen from across the entire Burial Land.
<br><br>
"Go towards the totem!" the Snake Spirit King ordered.
<br><br>
"It is there that you will obtain unprecedented power!"
<br><br>
As the totem was put in place, the entire Burial Land began to change shape.
<br><br>
A crack split open on each of the three sides of the Burial Land. The land began to morph into something that resembled a three-mouthed monster.
<br><br>
With its job done with, the Snake Spirit King's consciousness returned to the Jade Pure Realm. "The Burial Land is ready," he said to the black light.
<br><br>
"Let us commence with our plan then," the black light replied. "Go and ask the Blood Snake Girl to light up the black lamp."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's eyes flashed coldly at the mention of her name.
<br><br>
"Blood Snake Girl..."
<br><br>
However, he did as he was asked.
<br><br>
A few seconds had just passed when a woman, inlaid on the wall at the side of the chaos, suddenly opened her eyes - she was the Blood Snake Girl! Her eyes shone like two beautiful crescent moons. "Father? Is that you?"
<br><br>
"Activate the Evil Bead," the Snake Spirit King ordered harshly.
<br><br>
The Blood Snake Girl tilted her head. "Are you still so stubborn?"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King couldn't help but let out a series of laughter. "You know that the only reason I still let you live is to make you see how this all goes down. You will witness who was actually right in the end."
<br><br>
There was no need to argue and the Blood Snake Girl decided to just shut her mouth.
<br><br>
She had tried to resist more than a thousand chaotic eras ago and ended up imprisoned for so long.
<br><br>
At this moment, she was somewhat expectant to see her father sport a desperate, helpless expression when he failed in the end.
<br><br>
"Alright. I'll activate the Evil Bead."
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Soon enough, the aforementioned Evil Bead above her head began to spin and traces of blood light began to gather within.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
An unprecedented amount of energy soon surrounded the Evil Bead. The energy fluctuated like powerful waves across the infinite sea, pushing away the chaotic energy around.
<br><br>
One thousand divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
Ten thousand divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
A million divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
Ten million divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
As time passed, the power hidden within the Evil Bead increased exponentially.
<br><br>
Among all the ten Holy Items on the Snake Spirit Sect's holy pillar, it was only the Evil Dead that had the ability to absorb unlimited energy from the pillar.
<br><br>
The terrifying energy was compressed into this small bead. If this energy exploded, even the Source World would be unable to withstand it. It was enough to create a huge hole in the Source World and destroy hundreds of large provinces! "Go ahead and light it up..." The Blood Snake Girl sneered.
<br><br>
"Pop!"
<br><br>
With a sharp popping sound, the Evil Bead suddenly released a ray of blood light that flew towards the boundless chaos.
<br><br>
The terrifying energy absorbed by the bead was compressed into that single ray of blood light, which shot upward at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
Whoosh! At that moment, the Pear Hill continued to fly in the chaos at high speed.
<br><br>
To everyone's surprise, the ray of blood light, as thin as a finger yet faster than anything they'd ever seen, suddenly swept past just thirty thousand miles away from them.
<br><br>
Had Pear Hill been a little bit slower, it would've gotten penetrated by that ray of blood light.
<br><br>
Despite it being thirty thousand miles away, the massive energy it contained alerted the powerful warriors in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Zen, and the three Chaos Ancient Gods looked east at the exact same time they felt an irresistible force suddenly rush past them.
<br><br>
"What was that?"
<br><br>
"How could there be such great power in the chaos?"
<br><br>
"It was too fast. I couldn't see it."
<br><br>
That sudden burst of power came and went so suddenly that there wasn't even any time to process or guess what it had been.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, the blood light reached the top of the chaos and hit its thick dome.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
With its devastating power, the ray of blood light smashed the dome and revealed a small lamp.
<br><br>
It was a small black oil lamp.
<br><br>
This lamp had a basic shape and looked positively ancient. Despite the simplicity of its form, however, various complex patterns were engraved on its four, wooden pedestals. Inside the lamp was a glazed cup and a thin wick.
<br><br>
If not for this lamp, the ray of blood light would've been able to pierce straight through the dome. This small, ancient relic was able to withstand such a heavy blow.
<br><br>
Withstand, however, wasn't the right word. In truth, the lamp had absorbed all that power.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The blood-red light circled around the oil lamp and gathered at its wick.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
From the darkness, a tiny, blood-red flame came alive.
<br><br>
If the powerful warriors of the Four Spirits Sect saw what just happened, they would've been immobilized by fear.
<br><br>
Back then, the Snake Spirit Sect lit up this very lamp and destroyed everything in the main world.
<br><br>
In order to survive, the Human and Bird Spirit Sects were forced to escape and seek refuge in the chaos.
<br><br>
Now, this harbinger of destruction, was once again alive.
<br><br>
Countless crystals formed from within the oil lamp and began to spread out onto the chaos. These crystals contained the mysterious power of space.
<br><br>
The chaos clouds grew restless when they met with these crystals.
<br><br>
They usually floated quietly within the chaos and remained unchanging, unless they were absorbed by other things.
<br><br>
Yet now, the presence of these crystals stirred something within these clouds as they began to rapidly absorb the chaotic energy.
<br><br>
These chaos clouds that stretched out for trillions of miles were split into tens of thousands of pieces and began to take numerous shapes.
<br><br>
By some weird power, the crystals morphed the chaos clouds into the many heads of strange beasts.
<br><br>
These strange beasts had a bit of similarity to each other and the expressions they sported looked crazy.
<br><br>
As the crystals continued to spread further into the chaos, the chaos clouds continued to transform and morph into these strange beast heads.
<br><br>
They floated quietly in the chaos with their eyes closed.
<br><br>
Chapter 4165 Devouring Each Other Unique creatures were living in the boundless chaos, and the Chaos Winged Beast was one of them.
<br><br>
The Chaos Winged Beasts lived in groups and were ferocious. They launched violent attacks on any other creature approaching their lairs.
<br><br>
The lairs floated like huge cages in the chaos.
<br><br>
These lairs were also living creatures. They had extremely special sensitivity to creatures from afar.
<br><br>
Once they did, they would emit a faint stench that guided the Chaos Winged Beasts to find their targets.
<br><br>
If the sensed creatures were powerful, the lairs would emit a stronger stench. This served as a warning, reminding the Chaos Winged Beasts to avoid those creatures that inhabited the chaos.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The falling crystals absorbed the chaotic energy, turning into huge heads floating in the chaos. A rotten smell started to fill the lairs as if a corpse had been decaying for days.
<br><br>
The Chaos Winged Beasts that stayed inside the lairs felt nauseated from the stench and came out.
<br><br>
The smell reminded the Chaos Winged Beasts that terrifying creatures had been surrounding them.
<br><br>
When the Chaos Winged Beasts flapped their wings and soared from their lairs, the sight stupefied them.
<br><br>
Many huge heads drifted around. A strong sense of crisis radiated from them even though they didn't move.
<br><br>
"Waah..."
<br><br>
"Waah... Waah..."
<br><br>
The Chaos Winged Beasts communicated with each other.
<br><br>
Any creature had a way of living. If it didn't, it could have already been extinct.
<br><br>
The Chaos Winged Beasts didn't choose to attack the heads rashly. They sent dozens of subordinates to check instead.
<br><br>
The subordinates cautiously approached the heads and evaluated them.
<br><br>
The heads did not emit any aura of life. They only closed their eyes tightly like huge static rocks that appeared to be dead.
<br><br>
"Woo, woo..."
<br><br>
One of the Chaos Winged Beasts shouted and drew closer to one of the heads. It stretched out its sharp claw, gently touching it.
<br><br>
When the tip of its claw landed on the head's surface, its eyes opened suddenly.
<br><br>
A blinding light blazed from the pair of huge eyes. The head opened its monstrous mouth, attempting to swallow the Chaos Winged Beasts.
<br><br>
The Chaos Winged Beasts were fast. As they discovered the danger, they instantly flapped their wings and turned into streaks of black light to escape. However, it was too late—the huge mouth had sucked them all.
<br><br>
The Chaos Winged Beasts were barely enough to fill the gaps of its teeth.
<br><br>
Its eyes quickly locked onto the lairs, spotting more to eat. More than ten lairs were connected, and in the blink of an eye, the head devoured them all.
<br><br>
However, the head still felt hungry. To consistently enhance its strength, it needed to swallow everything that could be swallowed. But what more was left to devour in the empty chaos? Soon, it began to target its kind.
<br><br>
Swoosh! It flew towards another head and bit it hard. The other head woke up and was provoked to bite back. Both of them tried to devour each other.
<br><br>
One of the heads was completely gobbled up by the other, doubling the size of the surviving head.
<br><br>
At this point, the head still felt hungry. It fixed its eyes on the next head.
<br><br>
With its advantage in size, it was easier for other heads to fall into its prey.
<br><br>
It then started to devour other heads.
<br><br>
The heads that filled the chaos woke up in various forms and set off devouring each other crazily.
<br><br>
The heads that woke up first grew stronger exponentially and stood out from trillions of heads.
<br><br>
However, the ones to grow fastest in the chaos were not them, but the Burial Land on its corner.
<br><br>
From the moment the heads were born, the three big mouths at the edges of the Burial Land already began to devour them. It grew larger every time it swallowed a head.
<br><br>
After the Burial Land devoured all the heads around it, its size expanded more than ten times.
<br><br>
As the size of the Burial Land continued to increase, the speed at which it devoured the heads also doubled. Its three mouths opened as wide as a whale's as they devoured the heads.
<br><br>
However, the Burial Land was still too small. Although it was also a primitive land, it had never been paid attention to by the Snake Spirit King. Even though it had expanded more than ten times, it was still not as big as a province in the Source World.
<br><br>
When the crystals landed around the Source World, they turned the chaos clouds into huge heads.
<br><br>
As the heads awakened, they did not take their companions as first targets.
<br><br>
The huge Source World beside them was enough. Without hesitation, they swarmed towards the Source World.
<br><br>
The outer wall of the Source World was several hundred miles thick.
<br><br>
Although the heads devoured at a fast speed, it would still take a long time for them to enter the Source World.
<br><br>
In the Source World, the Evil God floated atop a mountain. In front of him was a ball of colorful Ways-blending Energy. Although the Ways-blending Energy was only the size of a fist, it was highly condensed for an explosion enough to destroy large provinces.
<br><br>
After the Pear Hill successfully escaped, the Evil God placed his avatars in all the large provinces in the Source World. He visited the major forces and announced to them that he was the ruler of the Source World.
<br><br>
When the Evil God released the evil intent that spread throughout the Source World, all the super forces and great forces already speculated the presence of a ruler. The Evil God's appearance confirmed their intuition.
<br><br>
These forces could not separate a large province from the Source World like the Pear Hill did. They had no other choice but to surrender to the Evil God who came to them.
<br><br>
However, other than making them surrender to him, the Evil God did not take any further action. To him, the creatures in the Source World were no different from ants. Even the several powerful warriors at the Eternal Realm were only slightly stronger ants.
<br><br>
The giant ape that suddenly appeared when the Pear Hill left the Source World lingered in the Evil God's thoughts. He asked the former captain to inquire from the Grandmaster of Heaven about the giant ape's origin.
<br><br>
He didn't know what had happened on the Other Shore. The Grandmaster of Heaven and his people seemed to have disappeared without any response.
<br><br>
Therefore, he had to rely on himself.
<br><br>
Realizing that there was such a terrifying creature in this world, the Evil God became more eager to enhance his strength.
<br><br>
On one hand, he wanted to further strengthen his control over the Source World, but on the other, he needed to comprehend the truth power from the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
His control over the Source World gradually increased. It wasn't difficult for him to completely control everything, but when he comprehended the Ways-blending Energy, he encountered unsolvable problems.
<br><br>
In a short period, he had already understood the embryos of the truth power from the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
The six embryos corresponded to the abilities of the six Chaos Ancient Gods. However, other than the truth power, the Evil God had captured something unusual in the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
He was lost in thought for several days.
<br><br>
Not far away, Edna walked down the ship and draped a black robe that she made over the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God stared at the Ways-blending Energy in front of him and muttered, "The power of the Ways-blending Energy is not just about the six kinds of truth power. It should have been thousands of times stronger now. Why is it so weak in my hands? This shouldn't be..."
<br><br>
Edna couldn't help but shake her head at her husband's situation.
<br><br>
Her husband was already the ruler of the Source World. Even the leaders of the super forces had already surrendered to him, but he was still obsessed with strength. She pondered whether it was good or bad.
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God was concentrating, he suddenly heard a strange sound from the Source World. He frowned as he directed his sight to the outer wall. His eyes reflected the heads that were frantically devouring it. He raised his eyebrows, puzzled.
<br><br>
"What are they?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4166 Difficult To Deal With The Heavenly Martial Province was located at the top of the Source World. It was the biggest exit from the Source World to the chaos.
<br><br>
In the past, the exit of the Heavenly Martial Province had been very bustling and prosperous. The flying ships of trade groups from various races had passed through it to engage in commerce. After all, it was much faster to travel through the chaos than through the crystal walls of those provinces.
<br><br>
However, after the Evil God took control of the Source World, he issued a ban that affected all those making a living in the area. No race in the Source World was allowed to go out without permission; otherwise, they would be killed.
<br><br>
Because of this, most of the trade in the Source World stopped, and even if they were to trade, they could only take the routes within the Source World.
<br><br>
At the huge exit of the Heavenly Martial Province, there were tens of thousands of merchant ships docking.
<br><br>
The people in charge of the flying ships grew depressed. The longer they stayed, the more divine crystals they would lose. They could not do anything about their situation.
<br><br>
"How long is the ban going to last?"
<br><br>
"Who knows? According to our patriarch, the Source World is now being controlled by a human being named the Evil God. He can lift the ban whenever he wants."
<br><br>
"Why? Have all the Eternal Realm masters in the Source World died? Why are they giving him so much power? How could a young man of the human race be so arrogant?"
<br><br>
someone shouted, being very indignant.
<br><br>
In their eyes, the Eternal Realm warriors were the top-level masters in the Source World, and the Evil God was at most at the Holy Soul Realm. How could someone of his stature control the Source World? "Shh!"
<br><br>
one of the warriors said, making a gesture with his pointer finger. "Don't talk nonsense. I have heard that the Evil God is lurking everywhere."
<br><br>
"Bullshit! Even the Eternal Realm warriors can't do that, let alone a Holy Soul Realm warrior. Do you think the Evil God is at the Eternal Realm? Do you really dare say he has surpassed those who are far greater than him?" one of the people in the area said, devoid of fear.
<br><br>
Obviously enough, the man did not believe the Evil God could be so powerful.
<br><br>
Ever since the Other Shore environment had changed, there had been no sign of an Eternal Realm warrior appearing in the world. The newcomers were destined not to reach the Eternal Realm. They couldn't surpass the Eternal Realm warriors; therefore, that man thought that the Evil God being there was nothing but a rumor told to instill fear within the public.
<br><br>
Just as he finished talking, the body of the warrior in front of him suddenly shook, and his face became blurry.
<br><br>
As the warrior continued to shake, his body, appearance, and aura began to go a drastic change. None of them knew how this was happening.
<br><br>
Soon, from the warrior's body, a new Evil God appeared.
<br><br>
The Evil God stared at the man with a scornful smile and asked, "The Eternal Realm? Tell me, what is that?"
<br><br>
The man who made those rude remarks earlier was left shocked, unable to throw out his words. He stammered, "You, you, you... You are..."
<br><br>
"I'm the Evil God," the Evil God said, completing his sentence.
<br><br>
"I... I didn't mean to... Don't kill me..."
<br><br>
the man begged, making it more difficult to control his urge to cry. He didn't expect for the Evil God to truly be able to hear all that was being said from every corner of the Source World. He feared he had realized this too late.
<br><br>
"Why should I kill you?" The Evil God showed a puzzled expression. It was difficult to determine if it were genuine or not.
<br><br>
"Don't you want to kill me?" the man asked, a glimmer of hope sparkling from within his heart. "You are a broad-minded man. Please don't take my words seriously." he continued.
<br><br>
The Evil God chuckled at him. "I won't kill innocent people indiscriminately, especially when I need more people. But I will possess your body," he uttered, coming toward the man.
<br><br>
"Possess..."
<br><br>
The man's body began to tremble, and his face began to blur. In the blink of an eye, he had become the second Evil God.
<br><br>
Although the Evil God did have the ability to monitor all the creatures in the Source World, it was still considerably large, requiring an enormous amount of effort from him. There were countless creatures in it. If someone cursed the Evil God, the Evil God would not be able to find the culprit from all those who were there.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Evil God happened to come to the Heavenly Martial Province to deal with the heads outside of the Source World, so he naturally heard the two's ongoing conversation on the flying ship.
<br><br>
When the others on the ships saw this scene, they couldn't even dare to breathe. They did not want to attract the Evil God's attention. If their bodies were occupied by the Evil God, who knew whether they would come out of the possession dead or alive? However, the Evil God did not have the intention of possessing other people's bodies. Instead, he looked at the Heavenly Martial Province's exit leading to the chaos. This was the weakness of the Source World. The speed at which the heads bit and devoured things was very fast, and they nearly bit through the Heavenly Martial Province.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
At this time, a harsh biting sound came from near the exit. The sound was incredibly loud, and every time it was transmitted, the entire Heavenly Martial Province trembled.
<br><br>
"What's that sound?"
<br><br>
"Creatures in the chaos?"
<br><br>
"Are they attempting to enter the Source World?"
<br><br>
The people of different races on the flying ships discussed in a hushed tone.
<br><br>
The Evil God waved his hand at the trade groups. "All the flying ships, retreat."
<br><br>
When the people on the flying ships heard the Evil God say this, they did not even dare to stay any longer. They steered their flying ships and retreated immediately, desperate to get out.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
The sound near the exit was getting louder and louder, and the Heavenly Martial Province quaked more and more violently.
<br><br>
Unlike the others, the Evil God did not try to rush out of the Source World rashly. It was not because he was timid. It was because it was unnecessary for him.
<br><br>
It was abnormal for these heads to appear in the chaos all of a sudden. The Evil God's intuition told him that this was not a simple matter. He knew he had to be more cautious in dealing with this.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! The exit of the Heavenly Martial Province finally collapsed.
<br><br>
The flying ships of the trade groups opened their shields at the same time, trying to protect themselves.
<br><br>
They had traveled around the Source World for a long time and were very familiar with the environment of the chaos. Once the exit collapsed, a large amount of chaotic energy would surge in. They opened their shields to block the chaotic energy coming to engulf them.
<br><br>
However, what they didn't know was that the chaos clouds in the entire chaos had disappeared, being replaced by the huge heads.
<br><br>
Therefore, the moment the exit collapsed, it was not the chaotic energy that surged in, but fierce heads.
<br><br>
After they devoured the outer wall of the Source World, their bodies expanded in a second. Each head was one million feet high, like a mountain flying in the air, and these heads were off to bite people.
<br><br>
"About two hundred heads are invading the Heavenly Martial Province!"
<br><br>
someone screamed.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The two Evil Gods raised their hands at the same time, and the Waysblending Energy gathered upon their palms.
<br><br>
A trace of space truth enveloped the Ways-blending Energy. After a few moments, the Ways-blending Energy disappeared from the hands of the Evil Gods and appeared right in front of the two heads.
<br><br>
These heads could not discern the matters of the outside world. They only had one purpose: eat! They would devour both energy and materials. If it were possible, they would surely even devour the void! Facing the sudden Ways-blending Energy, the heads swallowed it without hesitation.
<br><br>
"Explode!"
<br><br>
the two Evil Gods commanded at the same time.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! The Ways-blending Energy exploded. A blazing white light flashed from within the mouths of the heads, causing them to explode into countless pieces.
<br><br>
Cheers came from the flying ships in the distance.
<br><br>
"Amazing!"
<br><br>
"Two huge heads have been killed just like that!"
<br><br>
However, the Evil God's face darkened.
<br><br>
He had planned to kill all the heads with the explosion created by the Ways-blending Energy, but the strength of these heads greatly exceeded his expectations! He had underestimated them greatly.
<br><br>
About two hundred heads were no threat to the Source World, but the Evil God knew there were more of them coming. There were probably millions of heads crazily biting on the outer wall of the Source World. Their number was increasing exponentially! He knew that if he did not stop the heads, the entire Source World would be bitten into pieces.
<br><br>
As the Evil God thought of this, the two hundred or so people on the flying ships began to convulse, and their features began to disappear from their faces. After a few seconds, they all turned into about two hundred Evil Gods, raising their hands to release bursts of Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! The Ways-blending Energy appeared in the mouths of about two hundred heads. This destroyed them in an instant, and shards from the rupture of the heads fell to the ground at a dramatic rate.
<br><br>
Chapter 4167 The Trouble Of The Pear Hill Once he had taken over the Source World, the Evil God had grown complacent, seeing he was in a most advantageous position.
<br><br>
However, he never expected that the chaos would undergo tremendous change so soon.
<br><br>
The millions of heads that were nibbling at the Source World were like leeches that latched onto the Evil God's body, sucking at his life force. If he didn't get rid of these things soon, he would be in trouble.
<br><br>
The only solution he could think of was to mobilize the major forces in the Source World to join forces with his tens of thousands of avatars.
<br><br>
Together, they'd launch a massive attack.
<br><br>
He wasn't sure whether he'd be able to get rid of the heads this way, but at this point, he had no other choice.
<br><br>
Wherever there were chaos clouds, the heads would appear.
<br><br>
From the depths of the chaos, some of the weaker races and forces were devoured by these heads.
<br><br>
Even the famous top ten beasts in the chaos were in grave danger.
<br><br>
At first, they traveled about the chaos quickly, fighting off these crazy enemies.
<br><br>
However, after a while, they started to grow desperate.
<br><br>
No matter where they went, these strange heads loomed everywhere. It seemed they occupied the entire chaos! Why was this happening? How many heads were there? No one could answer these questions.
<br><br>
Not long after the heads showed up, the Pear Hill, which was flying at a high speed, also encountered them.
<br><br>
Kendrick was the first to sense the existence of the heads, because some of the heads had crashed into his enchanted barrier, immediately alerting him to their presence.
<br><br>
Ordinary creatures would've instantly shattered into pieces at such a violent impact. After all, the entire Pear Hill was moving at an incredibly high speed.
<br><br>
Not only did those heads emerge from the blow unscathed, they opened their wide mouths to reveal rows of sharp teeth and chomped down on the enchanted barrier.
<br><br>
To Kendrick's surprise, the heads seemed to be eating the enchanted barrier. This meant that these vicious heads were capable of devouring both substances and energies! "Judson, Gerald, some strange things have appeared in the chaos,"
<br><br>
Kendrick alerted them.
<br><br>
"We see them," Gerald said calmly from the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the chaos clouds in the distance began to surge. Countless heads emerged from the chaos clouds, all rushing towards the flying Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"Will it be easy to deal with them?" Judson asked.
<br><br>
"They can devour the enchanted barrier," answered Kendrick, frowning unhappily. "But it shouldn't be too hard to kill them."
<br><br>
Dozens of big and small rings suddenly appeared on the enchanted barrier on the east side of the Pear Hill. These rings shrank towards the heads, and then transparent swords appeared on the surface of the enchanted barrier.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! The transparent swords smashed the heads into pieces swiftly.
<br><br>
"They have been disposed of," reported Kendrick.
<br><br>
"Is it just this area that's problematic, or is the entire chaos filled with these things?" Gerald asked, his voice hinting at concern. "There seems to be too many of these heads."
<br><br>
"Are they related to that terrifying energy?" Judson asked.
<br><br>
"Who knows? Anyway, we have to be careful."
<br><br>
Even as Kendrick spoke, the Pear Hill was rushing towards a large group of heads.
<br><br>
Moments earlier, it was just a large chaos cloud. Now, it turned into thousands upon thousands of strange heads, and the Pear Hill was heading straight for them! Bang! Bang! Bang! As soon as the heads smashed into the enchanted barrier, they sank their teeth into it and chomped on it like crazy.
<br><br>
"Go to hell! Trillions of enchanted barrier swords!"
<br><br>
The enchanted barrier began to shake violently, as countless swords pierced through the surface of the enchanted barrier and shot towards the heads.
<br><br>
However, more and more heads kept bumping into the enchanted barrier around the Pear Hill. No matter how many they killed, more took their places.
<br><br>
"Trillions of enchanted barrier swords!"
<br><br>
"Trillions of enchanted barrier swords!"
<br><br>
Kendrick gritted his teeth. The situation was looking grim, but he kept on attacking the heads.
<br><br>
Even the truth power of the Chaos Ancient God was limited. On one hand, these heads would absorb Kendrick's power, and on the other hand, using trillions of enchanted barrier swords would cost a lot of truth power.
<br><br>
After a few more rounds, Kendrick had exhausted a lot of truth power, but the number of heads did not decrease. Instead, more and more heads appeared. Only then did he realize exactly how serious the situation was.
<br><br>
"Gerald, Judson, you need to help me."
<br><br>
"Judging from what we're seeing right now, we will need backup," Gerald said as he eyed the countless strange heads eating the enchanted barrier.
<br><br>
Soon, the Eternal Realm warriors of the Pear Hill were gathered on the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
When Zen, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others saw these heads, they were also extremely confused and shocked.
<br><br>
"These heads... Where are they from?"
<br><br>
"Why is the chaos suddenly so terrifying?"
<br><br>
"Can you hold them off, Master Kendrick?"
<br><br>
Kendrick replied impatiently, "No, I can't!"
<br><br>
At this point, there were about forty thousand heads lying on the enchanted barrier of the Pear Hill. Kendrick's truth power was nearly completely exhausted. Once the enchanted barrier collapsed, it would be a catastrophe.
<br><br>
"Then, we shall fight." the Snake Goddess said decisively.
<br><br>
Then, she dragged her shadow to the surface of the enchanted barrier. The shadow that was attached to her body stretched out her hands, and tens of thousands of energy beams shot across the surface of the enchanted barrier, slicing through the heads as they went.
<br><br>
Zen, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin also quickly joined in on the action.
<br><br>
With the help of the Blood-controlling Method, their current combined strength was definitely a force to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
With all these Eternal Realm warriors fighting side by side, all of the heads that were lying on the surface of the enchanted barrier were killed.
<br><br>
However, it wasn't long before the Pear Hill bumped into more heads.
<br><br>
Some even had the audacity to chomp on Zen, the Snake Goddess and the others, trying to devour them.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Zen and his companions swiftly got rid of the heads, but when they turned around, they frowned slightly. Even more heads had latched onto the enchanted barrier, their sharp teeth biting at it viciously.
<br><br>
"Kill all of them!" The Snake Goddess's face crumpled with rage, and a malicious aura emanated from her body.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm warriors and the Chaos Ancient Gods continued to launch attacks on the strange heads.
<br><br>
However, Zen suddenly stopped. The voice of the ancestry-level bloodline from his inner world was trying to tell him something.
<br><br>
"Zen, it's useless for you to do this."
<br><br>
Zen immediately stopped in his tracks. "Why?"
<br><br>
"These things are all over the entire chaos, and there are trillions of them.
<br><br>
How could you possibly kill them all? You will only be devoured by them, little by little, until your numbers dwindle," the ancestry-level bloodline said.
<br><br>
"They're all over the entire chaos?" Zen asked, his expression horrified.
<br><br>
"In a sense, these heads are your food, so there is no need for you to kill them," the ancestry-level bloodline added.
<br><br>
"My food?" Zen's mind was whirling.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline continued, "The downgrading has begun again. Their first step is to turn the chaos into their own world."
<br><br>
"How?"
<br><br>
"The more heads are devoured, the bigger the primitive land will become, until the primitive land fills the entire chaos. This is a game that only a primitive land can play," the ancestry-level bloodline said seriously.
<br><br>
"Primitive land as big as the chaos..." A trace of fear appeared in Zen's eyes, but at the same time, he was a little confused. "Why do they do this? What does this have to do with the downgrading?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4168 Another Way Even the biggest Source World was but an island in the huge ocean that was the chaos.
<br><br>
They were definitely not on the same level.
<br><br>
What would it be like to expand the primitive land to such a massive size as the chaos? What kind of power would the ruler of this primitive land possess? "Previously, these secondary worlds could also be considered a type of downgrading, but they could not be considered perfect—a kind of 'pseudo downgrading', if you will," the ancestry-level bloodline explained.
<br><br>
"Through complicated methods, the secondary worlds could be reversed and restored to the main world."
<br><br>
"So it was possible to reverse secondary worlds..." Zen raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>
"Yes," the ancestry-level bloodline said. "However, if the Snake Masters unify the whole chaos and complete the downgrade, then there will be no turning back for the main world. By then, the entire main world will collapse, and the chaos will be able to expand indefinitely, occupying all the space of the main world."
<br><br>
"Sounds good," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
As creatures living in the secondary world, the third-grade world was obviously more suitable for Zen and the others. He had been at a loss in the higher-level Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
In other words, the creatures in the third-grade worlds and the four-grade worlds were against each other.
<br><br>
"But the Snake Spirit King's goal is to return to the main world, right? Is he really going to ruin his plan by doing this?" Zen asked suddenly.
<br><br>
"From the very beginning, the Snake Spirit King was wrong. He will definitely pay for his stubbornness," the ancestry-level bloodline replied.
<br><br>
"Now, you must devour as many of these heads as you can so that you may expand your primitive land. Only by seizing this opportunity can you defeat the other party in the competition."
<br><br>
"How?"
<br><br>
"I will help you."
<br><br>
The edge of Zen's primitive land suddenly cracked, forming a crack that was a thousand miles wide.
<br><br>
As soon as the crack was formed, groups of heads started to chomp on it from the outside.
<br><br>
But as soon as the heads started to bite down, countless bamboo shoots shot out from the crack and began to intertwine with each other.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The bamboo shoots rammed into the heads, chewing down on them till they were ground to pieces.
<br><br>
"So, these are truly teeth?" Zen's eyes widened.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied the ancestry-level bloodline calmly.
<br><br>
It had been preparing for this day ever since it entered Zen's primitive land.
<br><br>
Now that the heads had finally appeared, it was time for it to show what it was truly capable of.
<br><br>
After the primitive land devoured the first batch of heads, Zen suddenly felt his cinnabar field swelling slightly. He raised his eyebrows and asked, "Is the primitive land expanding again?"
<br><br>
"The more heads it devours, the faster the expansion will be," the ancestry-level bloodline explained.
<br><br>
As soon as it finished speaking, the crack at the edge of the primitive land once again opened, and a large group of heads rushed in eagerly.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't believe what was happening. In such a short period of time, the primitive land had expanded threefold! Zen drew his gaze from the primitive land and looked at Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others. They were still trying their best to destroy those heads. Only then did Zen understand what the ancestry-level bloodline meant: these heads were all his food, and his alone. It was really a waste to kill them like this.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze swept across the chaos, and at the same time, he used the mother butterfly to sense the location of his inner world. After a while, he said loudly, "You can't kill all these heads."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess made her shadow slash several heads into two pieces.
<br><br>
"That's true, but we can't just sit still and wait for death," she said bluntly.
<br><br>
"I have found another way," said Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's words made the others stop in their tracks. They all looked at him expectantly.
<br><br>
With their combined strength, they could protect the Pear Hill for some time, perhaps days or maybe even weeks. But their bloodline power would eventually grow exhausted. The same went for the three Chaos Ancient Gods. It was only a matter of time before the Pear Hill was devoured.
<br><br>
The people inside the Pear Hill knew this, and were now in a state of panic.
<br><br>
No matter where they stood, they could see strange flying heads gnawing at their enchanted barrier.
<br><br>
Even the citizens of the large cities were filled with uneasiness.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess then asked Zen with narrowed eyes, "What way?"
<br><br>
Zen didn't reply right away, as he did a rough calculation inwardly.
<br><br>
Finally, he said, "Try your best to draw the heads to the west."
<br><br>
Right now, Zen's primitive land was right in the west of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
After having flown in the chaos for so long, they were slowly closing the distance. They would meet each other in a day at most.
<br><br>
"And then?" asked Fuxi, brows furrowed tightly.
<br><br>
"Let the Pear Hill enter my primitive land," replied Zen.
<br><br>
The several Eternal Realm warriors and three Chaos Ancient Gods were stunned.
<br><br>
Kendrick asked, "Are you kidding? How could your inner world accommodate the Pear Hill?"
<br><br>
Although the Pear Hill was a mountain, it was as big as a large province in the Source World.
<br><br>
Although Zen's primitive land had expanded, it was still incomparably small next to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"Has your primitive land expanded again? Can it accommodate the Pear Hill?" the Snake Goddess asked urgently.
<br><br>
"No," Zen said as he shook his head. "As of right now, it's only as big as one percent of the Pear Hill."
<br><br>
"Then how could the Pear Hill possibly enter it?" Kendrick asked impatiently.
<br><br>
"My primitive land rapidly expands when it eats these heads," Zen explained, pointing at the hungry heads in the sky. "If it can devour all of the heads, then accommodating the Pear Hill won't be a problem."
<br><br>
"How does the primitive land swallow the heads?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked, still dumbfounded.
<br><br>
"Let me lure these heads to the west," the Snake Goddess said, ignoring him.
<br><br>
At this point, they were out of ideas. Whether they liked it or not, they had no choice but to follow Zen.
<br><br>
With a gentle wave of the Snake Goddess's hand, the energy beams from her shadow became as thin as spider threads. In this way, her shadow could reach a farther distance.
<br><br>
While multitudes of those strange heads kept chasing and intercepting the Pear Hill, there were countless more that hadn't even woken up yet.
<br><br>
The thread-like energy beams floated past the motionless heads, immediately waking them up. Using their keen intuition, those newlyawakened heads locked in on the Pear Hill as their target.
<br><br>
Originally, there were about three hundred thousand heads chasing after the Pear Hill, but after the energy beams spread out like a beacon, there were now over a million heads chasing after them.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was horrified when he saw how densely-packed the heads were, chomping on the enchanted barrier. He couldn't help but say, "Snake Goddess, your ability to lure them is so powerful..."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess glanced at Zen questioningly. Zen said, "Don't stop.
<br><br>
Lure in more of them."
<br><br>
With a wave of the Snake Goddess's hands, her shadow extended even farther. More heads awoke and started to chase after the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
After a few hours, tens of millions of heads followed closely behind the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm warriors and the three Chaos Ancient Gods present eyed them anxiously.
<br><br>
If these heads caught up to the Pear Hill, they were done for.
<br><br>
Chapter 4169 Feast On The Heads It was truly horrifying to see a massive army of heads follow behind the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Everyone in the Pear Hill, ranging from mountain leaders, sect leaders, Eternal Realm warriors, to ordinary citizens, all felt chills run down their spines.
<br><br>
If there was even a slight mistake, the Pear Hill would meet its end right now.
<br><br>
"I didn't expect that the chaos would be so dangerous. Was it a wrong choice for the Pear Hill to have left the Source World?"
<br><br>
"The chaos should be filled with chaotic energy. Where has the chaotic energy gone, and why are there so many horrible heads?"
<br><br>
"Who knows? Maybe the Snake Goddess can answer your question... "
<br><br>
The people on the roof of the gate tower and on the hillside couldn't do anything but look up and pray.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Until now, the Snake Goddess still did not stop luring the heads.
<br><br>
Her shadow, which had condensed behind her, increasingly got smaller and dimmer. It had all turned into thin energy beams and floated farther away, to help Zen lure more heads.
<br><br>
The entire Pear Hill was like a fishing boat that sailed in the deep sea, while the shadow of Snake Goddess was akin to a large fishing net that caught the heads one after another.
<br><br>
"If it goes on like this, the number of heads would probably exceed a hundred million," the Snake Goddess said as she stared at Zen. "Zen, are you sure about your plan?" she asked.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure.." Zen confessed.
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others were speechless.
<br><br>
A few hours later, Zen used the mother butterfly once again to locate the primitive land. It turned out that it was already quite close.
<br><br>
"Is that the primitive land?" the Snake Goddess suddenly asked.
<br><br>
Somewhere in front of Pear Hill was a small, brown oblate ball. Because everyone was still a bit far from it, the ball looked like it was as tiny as a pea to their eyes.
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
Although his avatar in his inner world had been to the outside of the primitive land, he had not seen its entirety. It was also his first time to see what it was truly like.
<br><br>
Blue stripes covered the brown oblate ball's surface, and there was a crack on its side. From afar, the primitive land was like an oval clamshell.
<br><br>
"Should I control the Pear Hill to go there directly?" Judson asked.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed into slits, and he thought for a moment. Then, he nodded and said, "Yes, but don't bump into the primitive land. Control the Pear Hill to fly around it!"
<br><br>
"Got it," Judson answered.
<br><br>
The large circular structure behind the Pear Hill was like its helm. This circular structure controlled the direction it went. Since Judson was the one who had constructed it, he was like the captain who steered the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! The large circular structure slightly tilted upwards, and the energy it released also changed its direction. In turn, the Pear Hill's angle changed, and it began to rush towards the bottom of the primitive land.
<br><br>
Five minutes later, the Pear Hill passed by the primitive land from below.
<br><br>
Even though the primitive land was only one percent of the size of the Pear Hill, it was still a massive piece of land.
<br><br>
When the two intersected, everyone felt as if a large city had skimmed over the top of the Pear Hill, then the primitive land plunged into the army of heads that followed behind the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"It's your show time," Zen said as his voice traveled over the primitive land.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had waited for a long time. The primitive land hit the large group of heads, and at the same time, the crack on its edge had opened.
<br><br>
Hundreds of heads passively went into the primitive land.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack..."
<br><br>
The plants that resembled bamboo shoots intertwined then chewed the huge heads into pieces.
<br><br>
Previously, the primitive land had devoured only a small amount of heads, and the "teeth" formed by the two rows of bamboo shoot-shaped plants were enough to deal with them. Now, the heads from the chaos arrived in a large group, and many of them still escaped from the "teeth". Worse, some of them rushed to the continents in the center after they entered the primitive land! When Zen saw that the situation had gone awry, he had no choice but to form an avatar in his inner world to protect those continents.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had also realized this problem, so it activated its power once again. Just then, a rumble came from the primitive land, and more rows of bamboo shoot-shaped plants quickly grew out. These plants shot up in a crisscross manner and occupied almost one-fourth of the primitive land, which made it hard for the heads to pass through them.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack..."
<br><br>
The faster the heads were devoured, the faster the primitive land expanded.
<br><br>
By the time the primitive land eliminated the group of heads, it's size had more than doubled! Swoosh! It took nearly two hours for the massive Pear Hill to adjust its direction.
<br><br>
Afterward, it drew an arc in the chaos that was ten million miles long to lure those heads towards the primitive land again.
<br><br>
When the primitive land had doubled in size, its ability to devour heads also doubled.
<br><br>
This was the second time the primitive land and the Pear Hill had passed by each other. The primitive land swallowed over a million heads, and its size doubled again. Now, it was almost one-twentieth the size of the Pear Hill! "The primitive land sure expands quite fast…" Fuxi muttered, his eyes full of surprise.
<br><br>
Of course, Gerald, Judson, and Kendrick were also shocked.
<br><br>
They had floated in the chaos for quite a long time and had seen some unique spaces within it.
<br><br>
However, they had never seen anything as unique as Zen's primitive land! "After it swallowed two batches of heads, it expanded four times, equivalent to one-twentieth of the Pear Hill's size," the Snake Goddess said as her eyes lit up. "If there are enough heads for the primitive land to devour for five more times, it would be even bigger than the Pear Hill!"
<br><br>
she exclaimed.
<br><br>
All of them had been anxious at first, but now they were full of hope.
<br><br>
Without saying a word, Judson adjusted the helm for the third time.
<br><br>
As Zen stared at the primitive land that went further away, he asked, "Ancestry-level bloodline, why didn't those heads attack the primitive land directly? Why did they go inside the crack in the primitive land instead?"
<br><br>
Those heads were quite insane. They bit and devoured anything they saw.
<br><br>
However, when they reached the primitive land, they quietly bypassed the other areas and went straight inside the primitive land's big mouth. That was rather odd.
<br><br>
"Those heads only know to devour everything, and they are quite stupid.
<br><br>
Look at the blue lines outside the primitive land," the ancestry-level bloodline said.
<br><br>
"These are..."
<br><br>
"A net formed by the power of space. It can cover the whole primitive land," the ancestry-level bloodline explained.
<br><br>
"A space net..." Zen murmured.
<br><br>
At that moment, he thought of the Evil God and the Source World.
<br><br>
Since the heads had spread all over the chaos, the Source World had probably encountered numerous attacks from them.
<br><br>
He did not know if the Evil God had found a way to deal with them. If he did not, then the Source World would probably suffer a disaster, the tens of thousands of races and creatures that lived in it included.
<br><br>
At that point, the Pear Hill had passed by the primitive land for the third time… The fourth time...
<br><br>
The fifth time...
<br><br>
Every time the two territories passed by each other, the primitive land's size increased, and more of the heads that followed closely behind the Pear Hill were subsequently devoured by the primitive land.
<br><br>
When the Pear Hill passed by the primitive land for the sixth time, the latter appeared to be half the size of Pear Hill, and had devoured nearly one-third of the heads already! The seventh time the Pear Hill passed by the primitive land, half of the heads remained behind the Pear Hill still, but the primitive land was slightly larger than it.
<br><br>
Chapter 4170 Shadows Currently, Zen's primitive land was already large enough to accommodate the entire Pear Hill.
<br><br>
However, if they wanted to let the Pear Hill inside the primitive land, they had to slow it down first.
<br><br>
The problem was that over forty million heads were chasing behind the Pear Hill. Once it slowed down, it would then be engulfed by the sea of heads.
<br><br>
Therefore, they had no choice but to change its direction once again and flew past the primitive land for the eighth time.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In an instant, they redirected the Pear Hill in the other direction.
<br><br>
The huge mouth of the primitive land was still wide open.
<br><br>
It could actually devour the entire Pear Hill and the millions of heads in one gulp.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The heads chasing behind weren't fast enough to change their trajectories, so they drilled directly into the mouth of the primitive land.
<br><br>
After swallowing the heads, the primitive land expanded again at an incredible rate.
<br><br>
In an instant, its size doubled again.
<br><br>
Now, it was more than twice the size of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
But more importantly, the heads that were chasing after the Pear Hill were finally gone. There was not a single one to be seen in the void anymore.
<br><br>
Without them chasing the Pear Hill, it could now begin to slow down.
<br><br>
However, with such a huge mountain moving at a high speed, it would take much time and effort to slow it down.
<br><br>
It took them an hour to finally decrease its speed to a thousand feet per three seconds. Then, they positioned the Pear Hill to fly directly towards the primitive land.
<br><br>
When they were just dozens of miles away, the primitive land opened its big mouth, waiting for the Pear Hill to drill into it.
<br><br>
Everything went quite well. Zen and the Eternal Realm warriors were finally relieved to see that they were going to be safe.
<br><br>
However, what they didn't expect was that the primitive land actually brought fear to the creatures of the Pear Hill. It was partly their fault because they didn't explain to the residents of Pear Hill what the primitive land really was.
<br><br>
"The heads were all gone?"
<br><br>
"I think they were eaten by that huge monster!"
<br><br>
"Wait! That monster increased its size again!" "Is it trying to devour the Pear Hill? We're doomed!"
<br><br>
Only Zen and the Eternal Realm warriors knew what the primitive land was. Thus, it was natural for the hundreds of millions of creatures residing in the Pear Hill to shiver in fear in the face of this "enormous monster".
<br><br>
As the Pear Hill rushed steadily to the mouth of the primitive land, panic spread quickly.
<br><br>
Several mountain leaders flew towards the Snake Goddess and asked why they weren't changing the direction of the Pear Hill, and why it seemed like they were drilling into a huge clam monster's body on purpose.
<br><br>
"Did they just refer it as a clam monster?" After taking a better look at the primitive land, Zen finally saw what they were talking about. He smiled bitterly as he stared at the primitive land that actually looked like a huge clam with many sharp teeth.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess wasted no time and explained to the mountain leaders what really was going on.
<br><br>
When the mountain leaders learned the truth, they quickly bowed their heads and apologized for their intrusion. However, they knew that all the people were still panicking, so they said, "We're glad that the Pear Hill is alright. But please tell the people what's going on. It'll be better if the information comes directly from you to alleviate their worries."
<br><br>
"I understand. It's my fault that I put this matter aside as we were focused on how to ensure the safety of the Pear Hill. Don't worry. I'll speak to them," the Snake Goddess responded with sincerity.
<br><br>
Immediately after, she took a deep breath, and a penetrating voice quickly spread in the entire Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"People of the Pear Hill, please don't panic! There have been huge changes in the chaos. As you saw earlier, there were heads everywhere, and there are other things that are currently going on. Right now, we have to find a safe place to hide. That huge clam-like monster is actually Zen Luo's inner world. Once we enter it, we should be safe!"
<br><br>
The other mountain leaders, the sect leaders and members, and even the citizens in the cities were all shocked as they heard what the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
They all knew that building an inner world wasn't an easy task.
<br><br>
Zen's inner world could even float within the chaos. That was new to them.
<br><br>
And to top it all, Zen's inner world was so enormous that it could accommodate the entire Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Although it sounded inconceivable and insane, they believed the words of the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
After all, she had high prestige in the Pear Hill. Both the Snake Goddess race and the human race fully put their trust in her.
<br><br>
With that, the people of the Pear Hill finally calmed down.
<br><br>
At the same time, on one of the peaks, Elvinia was standing there with a surprised look on her face as she heard the Snake Goddess mention Zen's name.
<br><br>
It had been a while when she last saw him. She didn't expect that Zen's inner world had already grown so large.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Finally, the Pear Hill started to slowly enter the primitive land.
<br><br>
Everyone's attention was caught as they saw rows of plants that resembled bamboo shoots above.
<br><br>
As the primitive land continued to expand, these plants also grew bigger and stronger. If they pressed down, the entire Pear Hill would be instantly crushed.
<br><br>
The entire process of sending the Pear Hill inside the primitive land lasted for about sixteen hours. Once it was done, Zen said to Kendrick, "Master Kendrick, please remove your enchanted barrier."
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The enchanted barrier that was attached to the surface of the Pear Hill gradually disappeared.
<br><br>
A wave then came from the vast blood mist in the sky, and slender plants emerged from the sea.
<br><br>
The plants flew up from all directions, drilled into the bottom part of the Pear Hill, and firmly fixed it to the ground of the primitive land.
<br><br>
Zen's inner world would continue to expand, meaning that some unpredictable dangers might occur. To prevent the Pear Hill from rolling further inside, the ancestry-level bloodline came up with this method to stabilize its hold on the primitive land.
<br><br>
"Zen, I actually have a question if you don't mind. What are you now?"
<br><br>
Fuxi asked as he approached Zen.
<br><br>
"What do you mean? Is there something wrong with me?" Zen asked with a confused look on his face.
<br><br>
"Well, since you are now in your own inner world, doesn't that make you an avatar?" Fuxi tried to explain with a smile.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others looked at Zen as they heard Fuxi asking him this question. They were also curious about this.
<br><br>
Zen was now inside his own inner world.
<br><br>
It was like saying that a big cup was holding a small gourd, but at the same time, the big cup was inside the small gourd. This would create a logic paradox. Was the cup the one holding the gourd, or was it the other way around? However, it was truly happening right now.
<br><br>
"Hmm, one thing's for sure. This body is not my avatar." Then Zen pointed to the space beside him and said, "But this is."
<br><br>
Upon saying those words, an avatar that took his image gradually condensed. The aura emitted by the avatar was exactly the same as his.
<br><br>
Soon after, more and more avatars appeared one by one.
<br><br>
In a short while, there were over a hundred avatars that stood beside Zen.
<br><br>
Each of them possessed extraordinary strength.
<br><br>
"Really?!" Fuxi exclaimed.
<br><br>
Although Fuxi's strength had already increased dramatically, he instantly perceived that he wouldn't be able to deal easily with even one of those avatars. Even if they didn't use any theurgy, Zen's avatars could kill Fuxi effortlessly. And to think that Zen could easily summon over a hundred of them, one could just imagine how strong Zen had finally become.
<br><br>
"Well, it seems that we will become members of Zen's inner world."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi let out a deep sigh.
<br><br>
"The battle in the chaos has far exceeded our imagination," the Snake Goddess said calmly. Zen stood beside her, listening intently to what she was saying with furrowed brows.
<br><br>
"The Pear Hill is lucky to have this world to serve as its shelter.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill is lucky to have this world to serve as its shelter.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill is lucky to have this world to serve as its shelter."
<br><br>
Zen was surprised when he heard that the Snake Goddess's words repeated a few times.
<br><br>
He felt a strange wave run through his head. He was holding his head as if he was experiencing a mild headache.
<br><br>
"Zen, what happened? Are you alright?" The Snake Goddess instantly noticed that Zen was acting a little strange.
<br><br>
Zen just shook his head and said, "Yes, I'm fine."
<br><br>
He then waved his hand, making all his avatars disappear.
<br><br>
With his current state, he shouldn't have any auditory hallucinations. He thought that perhaps it was because he summoned too many avatars at the same time.
<br><br>
However, just when he dispersed his avatars, he noticed that there were shadows all over the sky.
<br><br>
As he looked at the Snake Goddess beside him, there were also more than a dozen shadows that surrounded her.
<br><br>
He tried to look around and he saw that there were more than ten shadows of Pear Hill.
<br><br>
'What's going on? Why is the world full of shadows?!' Chapter 4171 Variable Images These shadows appeared to be real and not mere hallucinations.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head and stared at them. However, they all gathered back together instantly.
<br><br>
Surely, they must have all come, somehow, from the people they resembled, and they were now like overflowing water, about to spread out at any time.
<br><br>
The strange visions persisted for a few moments more before Zen finally broke out of his stupor.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others all gathered around him, concern written across their faces.
<br><br>
At Zen's level of cultivation, he couldn't possibly become this disoriented unless he was confronted with a powerful soul pressure.
<br><br>
But who in Zen's inner world was that powerful? "Zen, are you all right?" the Snake Goddess asked worriedly.
<br><br>
As the visions faded away, Zen came to his senses. He looked around in a daze. "I saw numerous shadows just now."
<br><br>
"Shadows? You must be mistaken. They were probably hallucinations,"
<br><br>
Fuxi replied, furrowing his brows. Zen must be so fatigued facing so much pressure that he was starting to see things.
<br><br>
"Hallucinations?"
<br><br>
Zen frowned. "They didn't seem to be hallucinations, or afterimages. They seemed real."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi stared at Zen, not comprehending.
<br><br>
However, Zen became more and more convinced he was right. He pointed at the distance. "I saw twelve Snake Goddesses, ten Fuxis, eleven Pear Hills, and six Eastern Emperor Taiyis. They were really there."
<br><br>
Fuxi gave Zen a blank look. Finally, he burst out, "Crazy! You've gone crazy!"
<br><br>
"I haven't," Zen said calmly. "There must be something wrong with this place, not me!"
<br><br>
"Alright. Let's say there's an anomaly in this space. But why would there be twelve of me?" the Snake Goddess asked seriously.
<br><br>
Compared to Fuxi, the Snake Goddess was more inclined to trust Zen.
<br><br>
If Zen said that what he saw was real, then she chose to believe him.
<br><br>
"I don't know." Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
The number of the visions of the people varied. The Snake Goddess had the largest number, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had the least. Zen couldn't figure out what the determining factors possibly could be.
<br><br>
"The Variable Images. Zen, what you saw might have been the Variable Images..." Gerald's voice suddenly floated over from the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Zen and the Snake Goddess turned to look at Gerald and approached him at the platform. The Snake Goddess was the first to ask. "What is the Variable Image?"
<br><br>
"Only people with a deep knowledge of space can see the Variable Images," Gerald continued. "In this round of chaos, the first person to see the Variable Images was Othniel. After comprehending the truth of space, he saw the Variable Images several times."
<br><br>
"I remember that he had tried to show it to us," Kendrick, who was beside Gerald, added.
<br><br>
It was only in the early stages of chaos that the six Chaos Ancient Gods had no conflict with each other, so what Kendrick said must have happened in the earlier stages of the world.
<br><br>
"Yes. He said I had twenty Variable Images," Gerald recalled. "Kendrick had seventeen, and Othniel himself had the least number, only eight."
<br><br>
"But what exactly are those Variable Images?" The Snake Goddess pressed, more curious than the others.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure," Gerald said. "Othniel had carefully observed the Variable Images, and he said that they were all just versions of the same people."
<br><br>
"So I really have twelve versions of myself?" the Snake Goddess said, bewildered.
<br><br>
"That's what Othniel said. His understanding of space had reached an unfathomable level, far beyond our knowledge," said Gerald. "But from the perspective of life, I don't agree with what he said."
<br><br>
Gerald, who controlled the truth of life, had his own definition for it.
<br><br>
"I remember Othniel saying that, normally, one's Variable Images overlapped with themselves completely, so that even if he strained the truth of space to the limit, he would never be able to perceive them. Only when the time sequence in the entire chaos fluctuated and they became out of sync did the images become perceptible to him," Gerald continued.
<br><br>
"A fluctuation in the time sequence? When does that happen?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"You must have all experienced it before," said Gerald.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes lit up first. "I know! It was with the Shade Stone!"
<br><br>
"Yes." Gerald nodded. "Whenever the Shade Stone appears, there will be subtle fluctuations in the time sequence of the chaos. It was at this time that Othniel would see the images."
<br><br>
According to legends in the Source World, the Shade Stones had fallen from the hourglass of time. It was said the Shade Stones could calculate the lifespan of the chaos.
<br><br>
A short time after Zen had arrived at the Source World, he had also had a Shade Stone merged into his body. However, after inheriting the ancestrylevel bloodline, his body, in a way, had been rebuilt. He found that both the Shade Stone and the Chaotic Source Spirits had disappeared.
<br><br>
"Maybe there was another Shade Stone appearing in the Source World just now, and you have reached an understanding of space comparable to Othniel's, which is why you are now more sensitive to the fluctuation of the time sequence of chaos and can see those Variable Images," Gerald mused aloud.
<br><br>
Such an explanation made sense.
<br><br>
After all, now that Zen had mastered the ancestry-level bloodline, his attainments in space could match that of the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
Coincidentally, a Shade Stone just descended, and Zen was able to see the Variable Images.
<br><br>
But what were these Variable Images? If Othniel hadn't known, it was impossible for Zen to know now.
<br><br>
"Enough about the Variable Images. I'm more concerned about the Ruin Graveyard right now," the Snake Goddess pronounced.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard was a world floating in the chaos, also vulnerable to an attack by the heads at any moment now.
<br><br>
"Right! The Ruin Graveyard is also in danger!" Zen clapped his hands, suddenly alert.
<br><br>
According to their previous plan, once the Pear Hill went into his inner world, they would turn it around to search for the Ruin Graveyard! With the help of the mother butterfly, Zen could easily sense the positions of the primitive land and the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Zen wouldn't have been in a hurry before. He would have had enough time to find it.
<br><br>
But the Ruin Graveyard might get attacked soon. He didn't know if the creatures on the graveyard could survive that.
<br><br>
A grim air descended over Fuxi and the others.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had three Chaos Ancient Gods and several Eternal Realm warriors, but even they found it difficult to deal with those heads.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard probably didn't even have any Eternal Realm warriors. What chance did they have against the attacks? "Master Kendrick, please make the Pear Hill turn around. We'll set off right away," said Zen.
<br><br>
Although the Pear Hill was located inside the primitive land, the primitive land could crack open just enough for it to drive the whole land forward.
<br><br>
In addition to the Pear Hill's power, the primitive land would also help, so its speed shouldn't be slow.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on the northwest side of the chaos, the Ruin Graveyard, indeed, was currently in grave danger.
<br><br>
Hundreds and thousands of heads were already launching attacks.
<br><br>
These heads did not have any preferences. They would simply bite off and swallow anything or anyone they caught.
<br><br>
The divine land was at the center of the Ruin Graveyard now, so it was not damaged yet. But the huge tombstones around the Ruin Graveyard had already been gnawed into pieces.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard occupants estimated that the tombstones were big enough to keep the heads at bay.
<br><br>
In the meantime, they racked their minds, trying to think of a way out.
<br><br>
However, after the heads devoured tombstones as big as they were, their size started to double! Several heads had become inconceivably huge in the next few days. At the rate they were growing, it wouldn't be long before they could devour the entire Ruin Graveyard! Chapter 4172 Appearance There were several figures on the huge tombstones and all of them used the Grand Teleportation technique all of a sudden.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
A number of space channels appeared and with them came Mike, Holy Jay, Bromley, Jeremiah and Joy.
<br><br>
When they stopped, there was a head biting a tombstone before them.
<br><br>
It had just made its way into the Ruin Graveyard and was twice its original size.
<br><br>
"I'll go first. Holy Jay, follow me," ordered Bromley.
<br><br>
"What about me?" asked Mike.
<br><br>
"You guard the rear," said Holy Jay chuckling.
<br><br>
Mike sulked, feeling helpless.
<br><br>
A Holy Being's strength was similar to that of a warrior at the fifth or sixth stage of the Other Shore Realm. However, with a powerful Other Shore Token, the Holy Being's strength would double.
<br><br>
Mike had borne the butterfly as instructed by the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Shortly after, the Mysterious Yellow Tower had been destroyed and he now wouldn't even have a chance to go change this Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
What the hell was this! What was going on! Buzz...
<br><br>
A huge seal appeared above Bromley's head. It appeared to be carved with the ghost rock on Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. It was a seal of extraordinary quality and was carved out by none other than the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's fourth disciple, Justin.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
In a flash, Bromley appeared near the giant head.
<br><br>
These heads would usually attack living creatures.
<br><br>
But now, they seemed to gorge themselves on the tombstones, unable to pull themselves away and react to their surroundings.
<br><br>
"The Punishment Seal!"
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack, crack...
<br><br>
The seal continued to cover the head, creating marks all across its surface.
<br><br>
"Let's make our move, now!"
<br><br>
Bromley roared once he'd placed the seal.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Joy, Holy Jay, Mike and Jeremiah then appeared around the head and attacked the marks at the same time.
<br><br>
They didn't exert so much strength, each of them only releasing one divine megaton of power.
<br><br>
Yet in three seconds, they had already attacked the marks dozens of times.
<br><br>
Such an amount of power might not cause any damage to the head, but it could trigger the Punishment Seal! Each time the Punishment Seal was triggered, a force pierced through the internal space and spread into the target's body. The force was so powerful that it could not be fought against.
<br><br>
This was the power of the Punishment Seal! The head carried nothing and continued munching down on the tombstone. Hundreds of incredible powers began circulating within it and after a slight tremble, countless cracks broke out from the surface and shattered the ground beneath.
<br><br>
"We killed another one!" Joy yelled with a smile.
<br><br>
"Killing one is no easy task," replied Holy Jay, his eyes filled with worry.
<br><br>
There were too many heads...
<br><br>
Usually, if the creatures were large in number, each individual was very weak. But here, each head was extremely powerful. Zeke, the Holy Being, had accidentally been swallowed by one of the heads and could now do nothing more than restore his body in the divine land.
<br><br>
"Find another target," said Mike.
<br><br>
They were about to use the Grand Teleportation technique when a massive monster suddenly rushed over from close by. It was a head, a hundred times larger than the rest! It moved unimaginably fast and before they even knew what was going on, a large mouth covered them, attempting to swallow them in a single gulp.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
All the Holy Beings used the Grand Teleportation technique and disappeared. They appeared in the sky, over a hundred miles above, all harboring a lingering fear.
<br><br>
If they had reacted too slowly, they would have no doubt all been killed.
<br><br>
"Where is Jeremiah?" Bromley suddenly asked.
<br><br>
Holy Jay scanned their surroundings and revealed in horror, "I'm afraid he was devoured!"
<br><br>
"We'll kill it together!" Joy yelled, frowning deep in anger.
<br><br>
"We are no match for a head a hundred times stronger than the last one.
<br><br>
Let's get out of here!" Bromley bellowed, decisively ordering a retreat.
<br><br>
Just then, a figure walked out of the space channel.
<br><br>
"It's Rocher!"
<br><br>
The sight of Rocher lit them up.
<br><br>
The younger generation had now completely surpassed Holy Beings like them. The strength of Hallet, Augustus and other disciples all surpassed Bromley's.
<br><br>
Rocher was the most remarkable of them all and seemed to be the strongest warrior in the Ruin Graveyard! He nodded to the Holy Beings and took out a sword.
<br><br>
It was the Lone Sword! It was only once he had the sword in his possession did Rocher realize how terrifyingly powerful it was.
<br><br>
The sword had the endless destructive power and he had still yet to tap into its full potential! Splash...
<br><br>
The destructive power continued flowing around the Lone Sword and even Rocher, with a clear mind, was affected by the violence within it. He waved his sword with a glimmer of enjoyment shining through.
<br><br>
The power that radiated off tore the incomprehensibly massive head into pieces, snapping it like dry branches.
<br><br>
"Amazing! A truly astonishing power!" praised Joy.
<br><br>
Mike stood complacent, his hands tucked behind his back. Rocher was from his Evolutionary Universe after all.
<br><br>
Rocher was a stark contrast, however. He held the Lone Sword in his hands, an indescribable struggle visible on his face.
<br><br>
He was clearly incompatible with the devastating power the sword contained.
<br><br>
When he had first noticed the Lone Sword and set himself on retrieving it, it did not possess such destructive power.
<br><br>
Something must have happened to the Lone Sword before he reached the thirty-third floor.
<br><br>
Rocher's intuition was sharp, but he had never expected Geoffrey to have tampered with the holy pillar and changed the position of the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
This "modification" was both a repair and an enhancement.
<br><br>
The Lone Sword was at the eleventh stair, second only to the Snake Spirit King's Holy Items.
<br><br>
Even so, Rocher didn't like it...
<br><br>
He cupped his hands towards the Holy Beings and was about to teleport away using the Grand Teleportation technique.
<br><br>
There were over a hundred heads in the Ruin Graveyard that were a hundred times larger than ordinary heads. Hallet and Augustus couldn't deal with them and had to rely on Rocher to kill them alone.
<br><br>
Just as Rocher was about to leave, a voice suddenly came from the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
"You are too slow. They will grow a thousand times or even ten thousand times larger than they are now, before you can kill them. With the power of this sword, you will not be able to kill them at all."
<br><br>
The voice startled Rocher. "Who are you? Who is inside my sword?" he asked immediately.
<br><br>
Bromley, Mike and the others were confused as well when they saw Rocher's reaction.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Wisps of souls condensed on Rocher's sword, and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and his four disciples appeared all at once.
<br><br>
"You are the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower!" said Rocher utterly surprised.
<br><br>
"The owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower?"
<br><br>
"Why is he hiding in the Lone Sword?"
<br><br>
Not far away, Bromley, Holy Jay and the others were surprised and pleased by what they heard.
<br><br>
If the old man really was the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, then he must also be the owner of the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
"It's me," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord replied flatly.
<br><br>
"Sir, do you have a way to save the Ruin Graveyard?" Rocher asked hurriedly.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord looked around the Ruin Graveyard. The huge heads in the distance were still madly devouring everything they could, growing rapidly. "When I designed this area, I knew this day would come. But I only have one chance at this."
<br><br>
Chapter 4173 A One-time Array There were six extremely huge tombstones in the Ruin Graveyard, but two were missing to make room for the exit and entrance.
<br><br>
Between the tombstones were several large spaces and behind them was a dull gray forest, known as the Rotten Tree Forest.
<br><br>
The Rotten Tree Forest had been grim and lifeless for many years. The human race were not the only ones who did not like this place; even the native races of the Ruin Graveyard hated it.
<br><br>
Rocher used the Grand Teleportation technique over and over again to rush towards the forest, several Holy Beings following closely behind.
<br><br>
Although he had carried an Other Shore Token from the thirty-third floor, his achievements in space were not much better than those of the Holy Beings and so they were still able to catch up to him.
<br><br>
Buzz! In the sky above the Rotten Tree Forest, Rocher and the several Holy Beings stepped out of the space channel one after another.
<br><br>
Rocher held the long sword tight and placed it horizontally in front of him. The figure of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord emerged once more.
<br><br>
He looked down and said, "Clean up the rotten trees within a radius of ten miles, with the middle one as the center."
<br><br>
The second he finished speaking, Joy smiled and said excitedly, "Let me do it!"
<br><br>
She fell backwards and flew towards the Rotten Tree Forest.
<br><br>
As she landed, a purple mist rose from a large area of the ground.
<br><br>
It spread out quickly and formed a massive circle within the forest, enveloping a range of ten miles in radius, no more, no less.
<br><br>
Swish! The surging sword intent then soared into the sky and every rotten tree within the range was pierced through by a purple sword.
<br><br>
They then soared into the sky and went straight to Joy, finally gathering in her body.
<br><br>
The spreading purple mist then thinned out and all the rotten trees had disappeared. The center of forest had been turned into a circular plain.
<br><br>
"That's quite a unique technique," remarked the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord as he looked at Joy.
<br><br>
Joy smiled and had butterflies fluttering in her stomach. Being praised by the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower was a great compliment to her Grand Purple Aura Technique.
<br><br>
The soul of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord then jumped down and stood in the plain that had been created.
<br><br>
He stamped his feet lightly and a golden light began expanding around him; a stone array appeared on the ground.
<br><br>
"This array exists under the Rotten Tree Forest!" Bromley exclaimed, totally surprised.
<br><br>
He had been in the Ruin Graveyard a long time but he never knew there was an array hidden here. He wasn't the only one; the native races did not know either.
<br><br>
"Yes, it was prepared for a day such as this," revealed the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
He then began controlling the array.
<br><br>
When the array was activated, the entire Rotten Tree Forest shook, and the bitten tombstones began glowing.
<br><br>
Once the array was fully activated, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord patted its center and roared, "Open!"
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! The Rotten Tree Forest shook more violently.
<br><br>
Splash! A huge dragon-shaped mark suddenly lit up within the forest. A light dragon then soared upwards into the sky and then towards the heads on the tombstones.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Splash! Splash! Massive dragon-shaped marks appeared one after another, shooting the light dragons straight up.
<br><br>
A few seconds later and tens of thousands of light dragons had rushed out.
<br><br>
Rocher, Bromley, Mike, Holy Jay, and Joy were all stunned by this terrifying energy they were witnessing.
<br><br>
A single light dragon wasn't a big deal; Rocher's sword strike could surpass it quite easily.
<br><br>
But in just a few seconds, there were tens of thousands of light dragons, and their number continued increasing. By the end, there might be millions or even tens of millions of them. No matter how powerful the warriors were, they would find it difficult to stand up to such an overwhelming amount.
<br><br>
"What happened to the Rotten Tree Forest?"
<br><br>
"What a terrifying energy reaction!"
<br><br>
"Is that the secret weapon of our Ruin Graveyard?"
<br><br>
The creatures in other parts of the Ruin Graveyard were witnessing this too.
<br><br>
The invasion of the heads had made the human race and other races desperate. They had never imagined the Ruin Graveyard held a secret weapon like this and it filled them all with great excitement.
<br><br>
The light dragons seemed to have a mind of their own as they rushed towards the heads on the tombstones.
<br><br>
All the heads, those at their original sizes and those a hundred or a thousand times larger, were devoured by the light dragons in a flash. Huge balls of light then burst out, one after the other.
<br><br>
They shone like suns and erupted one at a time, sending a blinding light enveloping the entire Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
This lasted for five minutes.
<br><br>
Finally, the light dimmed and the dragons and heads on the tombstones disappeared.
<br><br>
"We made it!" Holy Jay yelled in happiness.
<br><br>
"It turns out the Ruin Graveyard is really powerful!" Mike couldn't contain his elation.
<br><br>
"Sir, how many times can this array be used?" Rocher asked enthusiastically.
<br><br>
Bromley, Joy and the others were curious about this as well.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord slowly raised his hand and said, "Once.
<br><br>
The energy in the array has now been used up."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
This rendered the Holy Beings silent and left them somewhat disheartened.
<br><br>
"But with your great theurgy, you will eventually lead us through this calamity," said Rocher matter-of-factly.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
Mike, Bromley and the others hoped he could reopen the Mysterious Yellow Tower, but they didn't get the chance to ask their questions just yet.
<br><br>
However, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord sighed and revealed, "The original plan was I would stand in the Ruin Graveyard and lead you through this disaster. However, things have changed."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Rocher asked.
<br><br>
"Forget it."
<br><br>
The change that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord referred to was the fact that Zen had successfully opened up his primitive land, which meant the Ruin Graveyard, which was used as a back-up, was no longer needed.
<br><br>
If it weren't for Zen's success, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord would have bet everything on the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
But he did not want to tell them this; it would be a huge blow to their confidence.
<br><br>
He considered for a moment and then said, "The change in the plan was caused by a sudden attack on the Mysterious Yellow Tower, which has now been completely destroyed. My four disciples and I have all died, but I had a premonition and placed wisps of our souls into the Lone Sword so that part of us is still alive."
<br><br>
What! The Mysterious Yellow Tower was destroyed and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was dead! Rocher and the Holy Beings were stunned.
<br><br>
The powerhouse who had built the Ruin Graveyard and the Mysterious Yellow Tower had died. How terrifying was the opponent he had faced? "If that's the case, how do we fight against these heads?" Bromley said gravely.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had used the array to clean up all the heads here, but there were still more in the chaos.
<br><br>
"You can't deal with them," answered the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
"Then all hope is lost," Mike murmured.
<br><br>
The news that the Mysterious Yellow Tower had been destroyed devastated him. He had been looking forward to obtaining a better Other Shore Token. Now, however, he lost all hope. What was worse, from what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had said, he couldn't even stay in the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
"No, there's still hope," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said with a smile. "You are the hope."
<br><br>
Chapter 4174 A Giant Clam Mike shook his head, confused by the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's words. "Sir, what hope? What do you mean?"
<br><br>
Bromley was the first to react. "Is it because of the butterfly Mike carried?"
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded in response.
<br><br>
"That butterfly... Does it have any secret?" Mike asked.
<br><br>
"If he comes, I believe he will save the whole Ruin Graveyard," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord answered with a smile.
<br><br>
In fact, he no longer attached much importance to the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
He now placed all his hopes on Zen, so this place became dispensable to him.
<br><br>
He and his disciples left their souls because they wondered how things could develop. Even if Zen did not arrive, it wouldn't have mattered.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, he was convinced that Zen would come.
<br><br>
After all, both the divine land and his parents were here.
<br><br>
"He? Who is it that you refer to?" Mike asked frantically.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord grinned and his body began to fluctuate.
<br><br>
While he returned to Rocher's Lone Sword, he spoke calmly, "Hold on.
<br><br>
He should be coming any moment now."
<br><br>
Then, he disappeared and everyone grew silent. They could not believe someone was going to save them.
<br><br>
In terms of strength, Rocher reached the thirty-third floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower and was already a master in the thirty-third stage of the Other Shore Realm. With this, he was well recognized as a top master in the chaos. If anything, Zen might not even stand a chance against him.
<br><br>
Was the man who the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord mentioned even more powerful than Rocher? Though no one said it aloud, everyone doubted what he had said.
<br><br>
He did not make a promise or reassure them. His words sounded more like encouragement so they could push through future difficulties.
<br><br>
"No matter what, the Ruin Graveyard is the last place we will live in. Let's hold on until reinforcements arrive," Bromley reassured.
<br><br>
Outside the Ruin Graveyard, all the heads, big and small, were cleared up.
<br><br>
However, a large number of heads still arrived from afar.
<br><br>
After what happened in the Rotten Tree Forest, all the races from the Ruin Graveyard sent their clansmen and warriors to inquire.
<br><br>
With full transparency, Bromley explained everything they knew and what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had said.
<br><br>
People had very mixed reactions.
<br><br>
When the heads initially attacked, the native races of the Ruin Graveyard did not fight to the fullest of their abilities.
<br><br>
They had doubts about each other and suspected the humans. Moreover, they made intricate escape plans if it was necessary.
<br><br>
Once the Ruin Graveyard was completely destroyed, they would gather the remaining members to escape.
<br><br>
They figured that though the heads covered almost everywhere, they might only be distributed across the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
As they had anticipated this to unfold, the races preserved their strength for the escape rather than the attacks.
<br><br>
However, they grew excited as they caught sight of the light dragons in the Rotten Tree Forest.
<br><br>
As expected, the Ruin Graveyard was protected by a powerhouse.
<br><br>
On top of that, Bromley's words excited them even more. They began to give an all-out fight.
<br><br>
Just like that, all the powerful warriors of the human race and the other races had gone out.
<br><br>
If the heads even came close, they would be instantly killed to prevent them from devouring and growing stronger.
<br><br>
In the first three days, almost no head survived in the Ruin Graveyard under the joint efforts of many races.
<br><br>
But on the fourth day, the dynamic changed.
<br><br>
The number of heads had increased, and they were ten to twenty times larger than the previous heads that attacked the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Although all the races did their best to fight the heads off, some managed to escape and devoured many creatures almost instantly.
<br><br>
Once these heads entered the Ruin Graveyard, they grew rapidly as they devoured. This made them more threatening opponents.
<br><br>
By the fifth day, hundreds of heads that grew a hundred times larger, and two that grew a thousand times larger appeared in the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Realm masters of the various races died, and many Holy Beings of the divine land were injured and killed as well.
<br><br>
If the two heads which were a thousand times larger continued to devour, they would grow to a size bigger than the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Even Rocher felt powerless as he faced the gigantic heads. With the help of dozens of warriors at the high stages of the Other Shore Realm, he launched an attack on one of the gigantic heads but failed.
<br><br>
Though they managed to injure the head, almost half of the warriors in this attempt died.
<br><br>
Once again, the Ruin Graveyard was in grave danger.
<br><br>
Floating in the air, Rocher looked at the heads from a distance. He held the Lone Sword horizontally before him and asked, "Sir, is there really no other way to save the Ruin Graveyard?"
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord remained silent.
<br><br>
The answer was obvious.
<br><br>
At this point, the Ruin Graveyard was a cub pushed into an arena. Even if Rocher became the sharpest claw of the cub, they would still have no hope to win the battle.
<br><br>
There was no other choice but to hold on.
<br><br>
Six hours later, the other huge head grew to ten thousand times larger than the ordinary ones.
<br><br>
It was easily seen throughout the Ruin Graveyard. The women and children who hid in the depths of the Ruin Graveyard looked up at the large creature and were flushed with panic.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the divine land docking within the Ruin Graveyard began to move.
<br><br>
When Zen left, the divine land was left in the control of the reincarnated Harper.
<br><br>
He paid close attention to the disaster in the Ruin Graveyard. When he saw that it was about to be devoured, he moved to help out.
<br><br>
Once the Ruin Graveyard broke open, he would control the divine land to rush out as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Another two hours passed, and a massive tombstone was devoured. This head grew by twenty thousand times.
<br><br>
At the sight of this, every living being sank into a sense of hopelessness.
<br><br>
"Sir, if I burn the Lone Sword, can I kill that head?" Rocher asked with a tinge of hope left.
<br><br>
If the Other Shore Tokens were burned, great powers would be unleashed.
<br><br>
On top of that, the power of the Lone Sword could be more unimaginable if it were burned.
<br><br>
However, it would lead to the punishment of truth.
<br><br>
Even the Memory Flame could not save him from this, which meant he wouldn't have the possibility of rebirth, either.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord remained silent.
<br><br>
If they ever burned the Other Shore Token, it would only mean that the Ruin Graveyard was completely hopeless.
<br><br>
Rocher thought he couldn't give up so easily.
<br><br>
Even if he had to sacrifice himself, he wouldn't think twice.
<br><br>
He reached out his hand and gently stroked the sword. His eyes widened, but just as he was about to make a move, Bromley's voice echoed from not too far away. "Something is coming."
<br><br>
Rocher turned his head to see, but merely gazed into a blank distance.
<br><br>
However, after a few moments, a bean-sized thing could be seen moving from the depths of the chaos.
<br><br>
"Oh, look how fast it is!" Mike squirmed in delight.
<br><br>
The bean-sized thing grew larger as it moved closer.
<br><br>
Slowly, it was close enough to be recognized. It was a giant clam with a big mouth.
<br><br>
"Is that the hope?" Mike asked in a disappointed tone.
<br><br>
Joy shrugged her shoulders. "It looks more like a joke."
<br><br>
As they looked at it, they saw that the clam with large teeth and an odd shape was not there to save them at all.
<br><br>
Chapter 4175 Figure As Tiny As Dust A great distance stood between them and the giant clam, making it difficult for them to tell its actual size.
<br><br>
However, as the giant clam approached them, it began to grow bigger and bigger. The astonishment in the eyes of the Holy Beings, and the warriors at the Other Shore Realm intensified.
<br><br>
The divine land was massive enough. The Ruin Graveyard was already several times larger than the divine land, but this giant clam was several times larger than the Ruin Graveyard! The giant clam headed straight for the Ruin Graveyard without pausing or changing direction.
<br><br>
Everyone looked at the heads, which were growing like crazy, and then back at the giant clam, which was approaching them at a rapid pace. Their hearts began to sink.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard would be doomed.
<br><br>
When the huge clam was just hundreds of thousands of miles away from the Ruin Graveyard, its serrated crack had already opened.
<br><br>
Then, it slowed down. It did in the same way a giant would slow down to crouch down and feed itself food.
<br><br>
"Let's stop fighting. It's useless to struggle," Holy Jay said helplessly.
<br><br>
Even if they killed the heads, they still wouldn't be able to save the Ruin Graveyard. They were destined to be swallowed by the huge clam, and by the size of the clam's mouth, it could surely do it in one gulp! No matter how hard they tried, they would die eventually.
<br><br>
Even Rocher, who had been bravely fighting day and night without taking any breaks, drew back his Lone Sword. After distancing himself from the heads, he stood looking up at the sky. Despite the situation, he almost looked calm, but none of them could tell how he was actually feeling.
<br><br>
Above the divine land stood another group of people who were watching them. Most of them were Consummate True Gods.
<br><br>
One of them was Rachelle who had previously died but was revived because of Nelly's pleading. She had become a Consummate True God again and had been wholeheartedly comprehending the Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
With her talent, it wouldn't be long before she mastered the Truth of Godly Way, allowing her to ring the bell and reach the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
However, before she could finish cultivating the Truth of Godly Way, bad news struck. The bell had been broken.
<br><br>
When Rachelle learned this, she fell into a depression. She didn't expect to meet such a great disappointment. Now, the Ruin Graveyard was about to get destroyed, and there was nothing she could do to escape the divine land. She hit a dead end, and she didn't know how to get out of it.
<br><br>
Not far in front of Rachelle, there was a warrior in the sixth stage of the Other Shore Realm standing with his hands behind his back. This was Mike's disciple—Harold.
<br><br>
Like Rachelle, Harold had been waiting to enter the seventh stage of the Other Shore Realm for a long time. To prepare, he had put himself into seclusion.
<br><br>
When he received the news, he became as depressed as Rachelle. He was already about to ring the bell after breaking through, only to find out that the bell was broken.
<br><br>
Because he was so busy mourning over this, he didn't even expect that in just a few days, he would find something new to mourn over— the Ruin Graveyard's doom! To them, it seemed that no one could escape the tragedy that was about to come.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Boom! Crack! Crack! Crack! As the heads continued to bite, a tombstone, which was even larger than the divine land, cracked.
<br><br>
When it collapsed, it made an earth-shattering sound and buried countless creatures under it.
<br><br>
However, the powerful warriors in the Ruin Graveyard didn't care about such a noise. They didn't even bother to look at it.
<br><br>
The giant clam was already very close to them now, its mouth hung open.
<br><br>
After a few more seconds, it reached the Ruin Graveyard, swallowing it whole.
<br><br>
"Such long, big teeth!" Augustus said, his eyes wide open in a mixture of fear and amazement.
<br><br>
"They seem to be some kind of plant," Hallet said with a frown.
<br><br>
"It's a wonder of nature. It really is amazing." Augustus said, trailing off.
<br><br>
"Well, when these sharp teeth close and grind you into tiny pieces, you won't be able to call it amazing anymore," Hallet said in annoyance.
<br><br>
If the giant clam closed its mouth, it would be able to grind the entire Ruin Graveyard, the tombstones, the divine land, and even the heads into fine-grained powders.
<br><br>
Almost everyone's heart was clenched. Augustus began talking again, unbothered. "Well, it hasn't closed its mouth yet. Is it going to stop?"
<br><br>
Hallet refused to reply, not wanting to speak to him anymore. Augustus had always been so optimistic, but this time, his optimism was out-ofplace.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard was already heading deep into the giant clam. Oddly enough, its teeth still hadn't chomped them to death.
<br><br>
Why wasn't the giant clam closing its mouth? This was the question they all asked themselves.
<br><br>
Was the giant clam planning on using a different method to destroy the Ruin Graveyard? Or will it let go of the Ruin Graveyard? A hint of hope, although unrealistic, began to form in their hearts.
<br><br>
After a while, the Ruin Graveyard passed the giant clam's teeth, but for some reason, it still hadn't attacked.
<br><br>
Not long after this, they saw a mountain floating in the distance, and it was unimaginably huge.
<br><br>
"Why is there a huge mountain flying over there?"
<br><br>
"I thought the tombstones in the Ruin Graveyard were large, but they're nothing compared to that!"
<br><br>
"What mountain is that?"
<br><br>
The people in the Ruin Graveyard looked up at the big, flying landform.
<br><br>
At first, when they saw the mountain, they felt a sense of awe, but after staring at it for a few more minutes, they began to feel suffocated.
<br><br>
After a while, Lorena and Rosie appeared at the top of the divine land.
<br><br>
Harold greeted and bowed to Lorena.
<br><br>
Lorena waved her hand and took two steps forward, her eyes in thought yet clouded with confusion. "It seems to be... the Pear Hill."
<br><br>
"The Pear Hill? Lorena, are you sure?" Rosie said with a look of disbelief.
<br><br>
The last time she heard about it, she was still so young. Although she knew what it was, she had never been there before.
<br><br>
Lorena, on the other hand, had been to Pearl Hill before, even being able to climb it. When she had reached the mountain's peak, she looked down, trying to take in the whole of what she was standing on.
<br><br>
However, the mountain was as big as a province! Even if someone stood on top of it, it would still difficult for them to see the entire mountain.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Chaos Ancient Gods had transformed the mountain, and its appearance had changed drastically.
<br><br>
For a moment, Lorena was unsure.
<br><br>
"Lorena, you're right. That is the Pear Hill." Harper's voice came from the divine land.
<br><br>
Harper, who was inside the sun, could see the mountain more clearly.
<br><br>
"But isn't the Pear Hill in the Source World? Why is it in the stomach of this giant clam?" Lorena asked curiously.
<br><br>
"I don't know. Maybe a major change has happened in the Source World,"
<br><br>
Harper deduced.
<br><br>
A major change in the Source World.
<br><br>
When Lorena thought about this, her heart began to weigh down her body.
<br><br>
Zen, Yan, and Geoffrey were still in the Source World. She didn't know what was happening to them or how they were doing in the Source World.
<br><br>
To say she wasn't worried about them would be a lie.
<br><br>
As everyone was staring at the mountain, a head, which was twenty thousand times its original size, devoured a tombstone. When it did this, much to their dismay, it grew even larger. Now, it was about fifty thousand times its original size! To their surprise, the gigantic head then gave up on the other tombstones and headed straight for the divine land! Harper was on guard against the giant head, but when he shifted his attention to the Pear Hill, he forgot about it.
<br><br>
Seeing the head inching closer, he uttered a final goodbye in his heart.
<br><br>
He wanted to control the divine land to escape, but sadly, it was too late.
<br><br>
The head had already reached the rear of the divine land.
<br><br>
Those who were outside the divine land could only stare as the gigantic head began to open its mouth. They wore the saddest expressions on their faces.
<br><br>
The people inside the divine land were completely unaware of the impending crisis. They continued to live their lives and followed their routines.
<br><br>
"The end of the divine land..."
<br><br>
Rocher said in a detached manner.
<br><br>
After all, it wouldn't be long before everyone else died.
<br><br>
The end result would still be the same, even if anyone died a little earlier or a little later.
<br><br>
He was no longer desperate but instead, rather calm after accepting his fate.
<br><br>
"No, it's not." From the Lone Sword, the voice of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord rang out again.
<br><br>
When Rocher heard this voice, he didn't feel anything anymore. No matter how powerful this old man had been, everything was already history.
<br><br>
'A remnant soul wouldn't be able to save anyone, ' he thought. He felt that he had read the mind of the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
But he still asked indifferently, "Why do you say that?"
<br><br>
"Because that is the hope," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
As soon as the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord finished speaking, Rocher saw a small, blurry figure appear on the top of the huge head.
<br><br>
Compared to the head, the figure was but a speck of dust, but because of Rocher's astonishing eyesight, he managed to see it.
<br><br>
Chapter 4176 True Appearance Bromley, Mike, and those who were standing at the top of the divine land like Lorena and Harold, also saw the blurry figure in the distance.
<br><br>
"Who is that man?"
<br><br>
"Is he from our Ruin Graveyard?"
<br><br>
"What does he want to do? Does he plan on facing that head alone? It's impossible."
<br><br>
In the eyes of these people, Rocher's power was the strongest in the chaos.
<br><br>
After all, there was no Other Shore Token that was stronger than one from the thirty-third stage.
<br><br>
Lorena, Harper, and all the others recognized this as fact.
<br><br>
And yet, even Rocher was unable to deal with the head, which had become fifty thousand times larger. Who else could possibly face it? However, there were powers other than those of Other Shore Tokens in the chaos. Take for example, the power that Zen was using was the omniscient power that every Soul Sea Realm warrior had.
<br><br>
The catch was, he could only use this power in his inner world.
<br><br>
The head either didn't notice or completely ignored Zen's small figure rushing towards it. Instead, it opened its large mouth to take a bite of the divine land.
<br><br>
One bite was enough to swallow a third of the divine land. However, just then, the head abruptly stopped in its tracks. There seemed to be an invisible force between its upper and lower jaws, preventing it from closing its mouth. It suddenly couldn't bite anymore! "Give me some strength," said Zen.
<br><br>
"No problem," the ancestry-level bloodline responded.
<br><br>
The blood mist in the sky flickered, as if blood-red lightning flashed within it.
<br><br>
Zen stretched out a hand and grabbed at the air. Then, he flew up and arched through the air. "Up!" he roared.
<br><br>
Swoosh! To everyone's shock, the head was inching upwards, as though it was being dragged into the sky slowly.
<br><br>
Rocher, Bromley, Mike, Lorena, Harold and Rachelle were all stunned to see this.
<br><br>
That blurry figure might have had the courage to appear above the head, but never in their wildest dreams did they imagine that he would do such a thing.
<br><br>
Yet, here was this mysterious figure, lifting the head up into the sky. Then, with incredible force, the blurry figure threw the head into oblivion.
<br><br>
What did that mean? The head was roughly the same size as the divine land; could this mean that this mysterious figure could lift even the divine land?! "Is there such a powerhouse in the Source World?" Harold turned to ask Lorena.
<br><br>
Previously, he had learned from Lorena that warriors at the eighth stage of the Other Shore Realm were extraordinary, and they would be treated well in the great forces. This knowledge had comforted Harold before.
<br><br>
But now, as he watched these events unfold before him, his mind was melting. This figure must have been beyond the Other Shore Realm! "No! No one could do that," Lorena answered affirmatively.
<br><br>
The corners of Harold's eyes twitched. 'Where did this figure come from?' he wondered.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, inside the sun in the divine land, Harper's body trembled as he could barely contain his excitement.
<br><br>
Others couldn't see who the person was because he was too far away, but Harper could see him clearly from the divine land's perspective.
<br><br>
It was Zen, it had to be! Although the appearance matched, Harper was still not sure.
<br><br>
Back then, Zen had asked him about the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. He was only a consummate True God, who hadn't even stepped onto the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But now, he had come so far! Harper came from the Source World, and he was naturally insightful.
<br><br>
As an Other Shore Realm warrior, he had witnessed the strength of the Eternal Realm warriors, but which of them had strength like this? Whoosh! A blood-red light shot out from the sky formed by the blood mist. Zen was enveloped in the blood-red light, rendering him a figure of blood.
<br><br>
Buzz! Covered in blood, Zen extended the blood sword in his hand and rushed towards the head that he had just thrown. His blood-colored body flashed through the skies as if he had completely ignored all Space Laws.
<br><br>
As he approached, the blood sword flashed ominously.
<br><br>
Normally, the blood sword could only cause a wound four or five inches deep.
<br><br>
For the head that had become fifty thousand times larger, the damage would've been ignorable.
<br><br>
No one else could see clearly what was going on. Even Harper could only see a trace of blood-red light drilling into the head.
<br><br>
Then, he heard a slight sound coming from the head.
<br><br>
The sound was like a charcoal pencil scratching paper, or like a cool wind whistling through a bamboo forest.
<br><br>
After a short while, the head began to disintegrate.
<br><br>
It dissolved into hundreds of millions of shards, like a massive meteor shower, raining towards the ground.
<br><br>
After all the pieces disappeared, a silence fell over the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Everyone was speechless.
<br><br>
Even now, the creatures in the Ruin Graveyard had no idea what had really happened.
<br><br>
The only thing that gave them some semblance of solace was that a human being had killed the massive head.
<br><br>
After cutting off the head, Zen scanned his surroundings till his eyes fell on Lorena, who was standing at the top of the divine land.
<br><br>
In a flash of blood-red light, Zen suddenly appeared in front of Lorena.
<br><br>
When Lorena, Rosie and Harold saw the figure of blood, they froze in shock. Harold, however, stepped in front of Lorena to protect her, even though he knew that this was meaningless.
<br><br>
Staring at the figure of blood before her, Lorena suddenly had a sense of familiarity. She could not help but call out, "Zen, is that you?"
<br><br>
Rosie shot a concerned glance at her sister, feeling a little uneasy. Was she so stressed that she had begun to hallucinate? What if she annoyed the figure of blood? "Zen," Harold called cautiously.
<br><br>
The blood-red light on Zen's body began to fade, revealing his true appearance.
<br><br>
This was his incarnation, so he didn't have any special power. He was like a grass or a stone in the primitive land. He was insignificant.
<br><br>
Rosie turned around and glared at Harold this time. What was wrong with him? But then, she suddenly sensed that something was wrong. As she turned to the figure before them, her body froze.
<br><br>
Standing nearby, Rachelle also felt as if she had been struck by lightning.
<br><br>
When she was reborn, she had grown up to perform excellently.
<br><br>
But deep in her heart, she never stopped thinking about Zen.
<br><br>
She knew that her sister went to Zen to beg him to spare her, and that Zen had gone to the distant Source World in order to grow stronger.
<br><br>
All this time, she was hoping that if Zen returned one day, she would've surpassed him in power.
<br><br>
Of course, she had never told anyone about this.
<br><br>
When all the resources of the Ruin Graveyard were available and the strength of the consummate True Gods in the divine land had advanced by leaps and bounds, she felt hopeful.
<br><br>
Even Rocher had managed to reach the thirty-third stage, and he was said to be the strongest warrior in the Source World.
<br><br>
This whole time, she believed that as long as she mastered the Truth of Godly Way, it was possible for her to catch up with Zen.
<br><br>
But now that she looked at Zen, she suddenly felt small and stupid. Her imagined opponent was far beyond her reach.
<br><br>
Chapter 4177 Master And Disciple Mike, Rocher, and Bromley were on the tombstone at the periphery of the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
They couldn't clearly see what was happening at the top of the divine land. But they did see the head which was fifty thousand times its original size thrown into the air and shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
Bromley was stunned for a while. He could manage to mutter only two words. "A miracle!"
<br><br>
"Irrespective of whether or not it's a miracle, at least the divine land is safe now," Holy Jay said with a smile.
<br><br>
"That blood man is standing at the top of the divine land! Let's go and have a look!" Mike said, a space fluctuation rippling on the surface of his body. He got into the space channel and flew towards the divine land.
<br><br>
"There are still heads that haven't been dealt with," Rocher said. .
<br><br>
He had hardly finished talking before he realized that the Holy Beings had already left.
<br><br>
Rocher also wanted to go to the top of the divine land to see who that person was and how he could possess such an incredible theurgy.
<br><br>
But the thought of the heads and how they had no one to take care of them made him suppress his curiosity and rush towards the nearest head, which had expanded to ten thousand times its original size.
<br><br>
"Lone Sword!"
<br><br>
The moment Rocher took out this Other Shore Token, a blood-red figure appeared on the head.
<br><br>
This figure held a blood sword and then stabbed into the head, causing it to shatter into pieces before Rocher. .
<br><br>
The figure then dispersed quickly.
<br><br>
But before it dissipated, it turned to look at Rocher.
<br><br>
Rocher was stunned.
<br><br>
Although this man was wrapped in a thick layer of dark red blood so that Rocher couldn't see his real appearance, Rocher felt that the outline of this face was somewhat familiar. It was precisely the shape of Zen's face!.
<br><br>
The bloody man disappeared from before Rocher.
<br><br>
"I must be thinking too much. How could it be Zen?" Rocher muttered, shaking his head.
<br><br>
His gaze then locked onto the next head. This head was now eight hundred times its original size. The bloody man appeared on this head as well.
<br><br>
"Has he teleported to reach this head? Or... it is an avatar?"
<br><br>
Rocher observed more heads and found a blood red figure on each of them.
<br><br>
There were over ten thousand heads of different sizes in the Ruin Graveyard, and over ten thousand blood-red figures attacked these heads at the same time. They managed to kill all these heads in a while.
<br><br>
"With so many powerful avatars, it looks like I don't need to make a move!"
<br><br>
Saying thus, Rocher flew towards the top of the divine land, smiling bitterly.
<br><br>
At the top of the divine land, Lorena held Zen tightly in her arms, sobbing.
<br><br>
Rosie walked around Zen.
<br><br>
She looked her nephew up and down, comparing him with the Zen in her impression.
<br><br>
However, other than his appearance, Zen's aura was completely different from before.
<br><br>
The last time she saw him, Zen had already mastered two Truths of Godly Ways. These Truths of Godly Ways affected Zen's temperament, and he had an edge while being forthright at that time.
<br><br>
Now it seemed that Zen was no longer what he used to be.
<br><br>
If this guy hadn't just thrown the head that had expanded to fifty thousand times its original size into the sky, Rosie would have thought that he was at the same level as them.
<br><br>
"Mother, I haven't finished the mission my grandfather gave me. The situation in the Source World is very complicated and is no longer what it used to be. I didn't even kill our enemies myself. Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer are dead, but someone else killed them. But I have found the remaining members of the Nine Li race. They are all in the Pear Hill,"
<br><br>
Zen said to Lorena.
<br><br>
Lorena's eyes welled up as she looked at Zen, but she was happy as she said, "You've done a good job. Where is Yan? Is she all right?"
<br><br>
"She's fine. She's now in the Pear Hill," said Zen.
<br><br>
"Where is Geoffrey?" Lorena asked.
<br><br>
"He-" Zen hesitated before continuing, "He's fine as well."
<br><br>
Whatever he knew about Geoffrey, he had obtained from the disciple of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, Dale. It was difficult for Zen to describe the state of the Abstruse Energy World to Lorena.
<br><br>
But Lorena couldn't remain calm anymore. "What happened to Geoffrey? Is he really all right?"
<br><br>
"It's a long story. He's not in the chaos," Zen said vaguely, having no choice but to extend some form of explanation to her.
<br><br>
"Long story? What are you talking about? He is Lorena's grandson! Explain more clearly!" Rosie chimed in.
<br><br>
Zen felt a headache coming on.
<br><br>
At this moment, there was another space fluctuation beside him.
<br><br>
Bromley, Mike, Holy Jay, Joy, and the other Holy Beings walked out of the space channel.
<br><br>
They froze as their eyes focused on Zen, their hearts beating faster as they took in Zen's appearance, unable to believe what they were seeing.
<br><br>
It was so absurd when the most impossible thing they thought really happened.
<br><br>
"Did you just throw the head fifty thousand times its original size to the sky?" Mike asked Zen.
<br><br>
"Yes, I did," Zen said, nodding.
<br><br>
"How did you do it?" Mike asked again, astonished.
<br><br>
All he wanted to know was the answer to this question, all other thoughts fleeing his mind.
<br><br>
Bromley, Holy Jay, and Joy probably had the same thought as they stared at Zen with eager eyes.
<br><br>
"Because this is my inner world," Zen replied. "I can do it with the omniscient power."
<br><br>
"Your inner world..." Mike said wonderingly.
<br><br>
The Holy Beings seemed suddenly enlightened, and Bromley said, "Is it because of the Grand Weapon Refining Method and the Primal Chaos Technique that you were able to achieve this?"
<br><br>
Back then, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had given these to Bromley, who had then passed them down to Zen.
<br><br>
At the time, Bromley had known that the inner world cultivated with this method would be completely different from ordinary inner worlds.
<br><br>
But he hadn't expected Zen's inner world to become so huge! When Zen spotted Bromley, he took a few steps towards him and knelt before him. "Master, greetings!"
<br><br>
Zen had seen Bromley when he'd been in the fairy palace, but that had only been an illusion that Bromley had left behind.
<br><br>
This was the first time that Zen had met his master.
<br><br>
"Please stand up." Bromley tried to help Zen up. "I accepted you as my disciple because your father asked me to. But actually, I never personally instructed you. Now that you have achieved such an unfathomable level of cultivation, being your master is more than what I deserve!"
<br><br>
"You will always be my master, no matter how strong or weak I am.
<br><br>
Besides, going by what you said, Hallet and Gus can no longer be your disciples, either." Zen knelt back on the ground, refusing to stand up.
<br><br>
Hallet and Augustus had already surpassed Bromley in strength, but they still recognized Bromley as their master.
<br><br>
"Bromley, that's true. You still recognize Hallet and Augustus as your disciples. Why should Zen be any different?" Mike said from beside him.
<br><br>
Bromley nodded as he said, "I was wrong. Having Zen as my disciple is probably the best thing I've done in my life!"
<br><br>
As he spoke, he helped Zen to his feet.
<br><br>
Rocher, Hallet, and Augustus emerged from the space channel, one after the other.
<br><br>
At the sight of Zen, they all looked as if they had seen a ghost. Augustus's eyes, in particular, were wide as saucers.
<br><br>
Chapter 4178 The Vibration Of The Sword "Hallet, Gus!"
<br><br>
Zen yelled when he saw them, bowing to both.
<br><br>
Hallet responded immediately, "Zen, how have you been?"
<br><br>
Zen and Augustus had had a very close relationship before.
<br><br>
He leaned forward, took a good look at him, and stretched his head out to smell his scent. "Zen, which stage of the Other Shore Realm have you reached by now?" he asked.
<br><br>
Zen said, "Huh. Which stage of the Other Shore Realm I'm at..."
<br><br>
Zen had no idea how to answer this question.
<br><br>
He'd been in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, but he hadn't fused with an Other Shore Token in that stage. The levels of the Other Shore Tokens he had with him weren't very high.
<br><br>
It might not be accurate to say that he was at the thirty-third stage of the Other Shore Realm, but it was a fact that he was at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
"I'm at the twentieth stage of the Other Shore Realm!" Augustus said.
<br><br>
"Since the Mysterious Yellow Tower was destroyed, I haven't obtained the Other Shore Token yet, but much to my luck, I've fused with a holy armor from the nineteenth floor," he continued, seemingly proud of himself.
<br><br>
He showed them the Other Shore Token as proof.
<br><br>
It appeared on him, causing a blue light to radiate from his body. The aura released by the holy armor was quite captivating. It looked as if it held a strong, mysterious power.
<br><br>
"It's an Other Shore Token of the mysterious type, isn't it?" Zen said, studying the token with his eyes.
<br><br>
"Yes!" Augustus said confidently. It was obvious he was very proud of his possession. "Do you want to have a try? But you better watch yourself.
<br><br>
Even if you have infinite power, you won't be able to defeat me!"
<br><br>
Augustus jested.
<br><br>
"Augustus, Zen's just returned. Give him a break," Bromley said, embarrassed at the behavior of his disciple. He always knew Augustus had something special in him, but sometimes, he did act like a complete idiot.
<br><br>
Hallet also looked at Augustus with a disapproving gaze. 'He's too haughty for his own good, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Augustus, however, paid no attention to their reminders and stares. He had been waiting to battle Zen once he returned for too long.
<br><br>
Zen had the extremely formidable power, but Augustus wasn't ready to give up his challenge just yet.
<br><br>
"Augustus, if you so badly want to battle with me, then let your request be my command," Zen said, smiling smugly.
<br><br>
"Zen, the armor Augustus is wearing is extremely powerful. Even Rocher wouldn't be able to break from it if he were trapped by it. No matter how powerful you are, you won't be able to do anything to free yourself from its hold," Hallet reminded, worried.
<br><br>
Even though he knew Augustus was definitely no match for Zen, he still didn't want Zen to take any chances.
<br><br>
However, before Zen could respond, Augustus charged at him. "Zen! "Be careful!" Hallet yelled through the noise.
<br><br>
Streaks of blue light outlined the holy armor, making Augustus appear like a fast, radiating figure. As he waved his hands in the air, two semicircular blue spaces shot from his palms, attacking Zen.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Tokens in the Mysterious Yellow Tower were carefully chosen by the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. Almost every floor had a unique Other Shore Token. The holy armor was one of them. If one were trapped in the armor's blue spaces, they wouldn't be able to escape, falling into a constant cycle. No one was able to free themselves from it, not even Rocher.
<br><br>
Little did Augustus know that Zen could use the power of the ancestrylevel bloodline at will.
<br><br>
As soon as Augustus' spaces came charging at him, Zen had already analyzed the type of the space power and figured out a way to deal with it.
<br><br>
Bang! The two semicircular spaces gathered together, locking Zen between them.
<br><br>
"What will our precious little Zen do to get out of this trap?" Augustus said mockingly and laughed proudly.
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his finger, and from it came a transparent spiral of power. With a quick move, he swept the spaces, completely slicing them with just the tip of his finger.
<br><br>
He tore the holy armor's mysterious, blue spaces so easily as if he had simply torn a piece of paper.
<br><br>
Augustus looked at him, his mouth hanging wide open.
<br><br>
With the amount of power Zen held, Augustus knew Zen would be able to deal with the holy armor accordingly, but he didn't expect it to be that easy for him! He was standing face-to-face with someone who was able to break not only the holy armor of the nineteenth stage of the Other Shore, but also the theurgies of the Chaos Ancient Gods and the Grandmaster of Heaven! Rocher, who was standing a few meters away, walked up to Zen, cupped his hands together, and with equal excitement said, "Zen!"
<br><br>
"Rocher!" Zen cheered out.
<br><br>
The two of them shared a profound look.
<br><br>
There was a special and unbreakable bond between them. They were both talents from the Evolutionary Universe. They experienced the lows and highs of life together. They'd basically known each other for most of their lives! Their friendship was very precious to them. It wasn't something one could easily encapsulate in words.
<br><br>
When Rocher obtained the Lone Sword, Lorena decided he must be one of the supreme masters of the chaos, making him no less powerful than the Lord of Weapons.
<br><br>
Of course, Rocher was overjoyed, but he was also thinking about Zen.
<br><br>
What if he was compared with Zen? If they were to be honest, even Bromley and Mike didn't have much confidence in Zen. After all, it was difficult to reach Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Out of all of them, Rocher should have been the first person to reach this stage after the era of Wild Gods.
<br><br>
Who would have thought Zen would be able to bring a world back? "Zen, how did you find the Ruin Graveyard?" Rocher asked.
<br><br>
Everyone, including Bromley, Mike and Lorena, listened.
<br><br>
"Wait, you don't know?" Zen asked, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion.
<br><br>
"I asked someone to bring a small butterfly into the Mysterious Yellow Tower. It should be carried by someone from the Ruin Graveyard. I could find you when I sensed the butterfly's location, but it seems like you don't know that at all."
<br><br>
When Bromley, Holy Jay, Rocher, and the others heard this, they immediately turned their heads towards Mike.
<br><br>
Mike's eyes lit up. "The butterfly! The butterfly was guiding you!"
<br><br>
At this moment, the Lone Sword behind Rocher began to buzz. After a few seconds, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, Dale, Derrick, Arthur, and Justin began to appear one by one.
<br><br>
"Master Dale!" When Zen saw Dale, he smiled. He then turned to look at the old man beside him and recognized him immediately. "My name is Zen. Greetings, Grand Supreme Elderly Lord!"
<br><br>
"Ahem..." The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord coughed and explained, "Your father, Mike, carries the small butterfly. I have told him before."
<br><br>
Mike rolled his eyes. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was a man of few words and never told Mike that the butterfly would be so useful in leading his son back.
<br><br>
"So I'm guessing you two know each other?" Rocher asked, hints of amusement and surprise present in his voice.
<br><br>
Zen smiled faintly. "Actually, this is the first time I've met the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord! Although, I must say I'm sure that everything that's happened to me since I was in the Evolutionary Universe has something to do with him."
<br><br>
"Why do you say that?" Bromley asked in confusion.
<br><br>
Although the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was the owner of the Ruin Graveyard and the Mysterious Yellow Tower, no one knew if he had anything to do with the divine land.
<br><br>
"The Grand Weapon Refining Method you gave me was not obtained by you accidentally but a special gift from the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord,"
<br><br>
Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
Bromley raised his eyebrows, silently doubting what he just heard.
<br><br>
"It involves the entire chaos or maybe even a larger world. It's too complicated," Zen said.
<br><br>
At this moment, Rocher felt a slight vibration from the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
The vibration was subtle, but it had a certain rhythm. Rocher didn't know the reason for it, but the Grand Supreme Elderly answered his silent question for him. "It's the other end of the Lone Sword. Zen, that should be your son, Geoffrey."
<br><br>
"Geoffrey?"
<br><br>
"Geoffrey? Is it Geoffrey on the other side of the Lone Sword? Where is he?"
<br><br>
Not far away, Lorena and Rosie, who were listening to their conversation, felt excited at the mention of Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Chapter 4179 Refuse To Obey Dale had told Zen of how they had communicated with Geoffrey before.
<br><br>
Now that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord mentioned it, Zen was naturally filled with a great deal of concern. He gestured to Lorena and Rosie to be silent.
<br><br>
Everyone quieted down, their hearts filled with all sorts of strange feelings.
<br><br>
How was it possible for Geoffrey to communicate with them through this sword? Was he trapped in it? Rocher carried the Other Shore Token and could now feel the power of the vibrations, but what did such intermittent vibrations mean? The sword vibrated for a while before the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said with an odd expression, "He says that he has found another holy pillar, and he can connect the line of the Lone Sword there."
<br><br>
"Does that mean the Lone Sword can get stronger?" asked Zen hopefully.
<br><br>
"Yes," answered the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, nodding. "Its ability may change as well."
<br><br>
Rocher's eyes lit up in surprise. "Sir, do you mean that Geoffrey is capable of modifying the Lone Sword's ability?"
<br><br>
With a faint hint of a smile, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, "Geoffrey is on the pillar. He can modify the abilities of the Lone Sword and other Other Shore Tokens. He just happened to find the Lone Sword."
<br><br>
"That's unbelievable!" Rocher exclaimed in absolute shock.
<br><br>
He had sensed a change in the sword's ability before, but he could not understand how it had happened. His understanding of Other Shore Tokens was limited to the Other Shore after all. He had never even thought of the world outside the chaos.
<br><br>
He hadn't expected his Lone Sword's change would have something to do with Geoffrey, and yet it was his modification that had given the sword such great power.
<br><br>
Mike, Bromley, and Holy Jay were just as astonished.
<br><br>
It was well known by all that the Other Shore Tokens were the source of power in the chaos.
<br><br>
But to their surprise, Mike's grandson could modify them at will. What kind of ability was this? Joy's heart was filled with tenderness as she reminisced about the little boy who had once caused trouble in the fairy palace, who was now so incredibly powerful.
<br><br>
"What line? What pillar? Zen, tell him to come out of the sword!" Lorena ordered grumpily.
<br><br>
She too knew the significance of the Other Shore Tokens and how extraordinary Geoffrey's ability was.
<br><br>
But she couldn't accept that Zen had let her grandson face the risks it came with all alone.
<br><br>
"Mother, Geoffrey is not in the Lone Sword. His current state is unlike anything you are familiar with," said Zen, trying to calm her down.
<br><br>
"I don't care!" Lorena said, ignoring him and turning to the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey, can you hear me? Come back now!"
<br><br>
"Grandma..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey was taken aback by his grandmother's plea as he stood at the stair of the pillar.
<br><br>
He climbed a long distance on the chain before he finally arrived at the mysterious courtyard that hung in the air.
<br><br>
But when he got there, he discovered the courtyard was bound tightly by the massive chain and there was not even a crack to be found that he could enter through.
<br><br>
This did not deter him. He didn't even consider turning back. He climbed up the chain from another corner of the courtyard and successfully reached a different pillar.
<br><br>
The first pillar had all sorts of lines on it that were connected to the chaos.
<br><br>
The second pillar, however, was bare and didn't have any light spreading out from it, including the location of the ten Holy Items at the top.
<br><br>
Geoffrey knew the Holy Items were significant.
<br><br>
'What if I upgrade the Lone Sword into a Holy Item?' With this idea burning within, he climbed back along the chain and returned to the eleventh stair of the pillar of the Snake Spirit Sect. When he came into contact with the light, he told the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord of his plan, but as he spoke, he discovered that something was wrong.
<br><br>
The Lone Sword was actually in the hands of Rocher, and his father, grandmother, and grandfather were gathered around Rocher.
<br><br>
It seemed his father had returned to the divine land.
<br><br>
"I do not wish to go back," Geoffrey revealed while playing the light.
<br><br>
Climbing so high was not easy for him and he would definitely not give up now that he could help Rocher enhance the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord passed Geoffrey's words on to Lorena.
<br><br>
Her eyebrows raised as she began arguing with Geoffrey, "These sort of things are not suitable for you. Geoffrey, you're still young and don't understand how dangerous the world really is..."
<br><br>
He ignored her outright and instead said, "Uncle Rocher, let me help you strengthen your sword."
<br><br>
He pulled the black stone out of the pillar and the link between it and the Lone Sword was broken.
<br><br>
The Lone Sword's aura quickly dissipated without any energy reaction, leaving it looking like an ordinary iron weapon.
<br><br>
"The Lone Sword..." The change in the sword stunned Rocher.
<br><br>
"He has broken the link to the Lone Sword," announced the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. "Don't worry, you need only wait. He should be changing the sword's ability now."
<br><br>
"Can you get in touch with him?" asked Lorena, still peeved.
<br><br>
"No," replied the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"That brat..." Lorena muttered angrily, turning her head to stare at Zen.
<br><br>
"You're his father. Why aren't you stopping him? I'm going to tell Tia about this and we'll see how you explain it then!"
<br><br>
Zen was speechless. Geoffrey hadn't even given him the chance to speak.
<br><br>
How could he have persuaded him? "Mother, Geoffrey is not a child anymore. He can take care of himself well enough," Zen said, still trying to calm her nerves. "Some of the members of the Nine Li race are waiting for you in the Pear Hill. Let me take you there now."
<br><br>
Lorena was still enraged but after hearing this, she thought a while and then asked, "Who are they?"
<br><br>
"Grandpa Ambrose and Grandpa Tucker," replied Zen.
<br><br>
"Take us there!" Harper came out of the divine land.
<br><br>
He had always been loyal to the Nine Li race and was now eager to meet Ambrose and Tucker.
<br><br>
Zen constructed a space door which led directly to the Pear Hill and sent Lorena, Harper and Rosie through.
<br><br>
When Ambrose and Tucker saw Lorena and Rosie, their eyes instantly turned red.
<br><br>
Back when the divine land set sail, they were left extremely desperate.
<br><br>
They had never imagined they'd meet again someday.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, seven of the nine chiefs had died, and those who remained of the Nine Li race were weak. It wasn't difficult to imagine their current sadness.
<br><br>
After assisting his mother and the others in settling down in the Pear Hill, Zen returned to the top of the divine land and described roughly what he had encountered on his travels to the Source World.
<br><br>
He spoke of how he joined the Sword Light Palace and the Oneness Sky Palace and traveled to the Pear Hill, and how he then took the Pear Hill away from the Source World.
<br><br>
Zen's stories did not relieve Mike. Instead, he asked in surprise, "So the huge Source World has fallen into the hands of the Evil God, who was born in your inner world?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen answered affirmatively.
<br><br>
"It appears the situation is even more serious than I had thought."
<br><br>
Bromley was overtaken by a gloomy seriousness.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had been silent all this time but then suddenly said to Zen, "The Snake Spirit King must be very confident to dare to take this step. Even if the Evil God has controlled the Source World, he may not be able to handle him."
<br><br>
Zen had the ancestry-level bloodline, and so knew from the very beginning how to deal with this. Moreover, his primitive land was small in size, making it easy for him to manage.
<br><br>
But the Source World was different.
<br><br>
It had developed over countless years. It had long since grown into a gigantic world and couldn't fight against the heads given its huge form.
<br><br>
It was just as the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had guessed; the Source World was currently in the middle of an unprecedented era of suffering.
<br><br>
Chapter 4180 The Crisis In The Source World Currently, the Source World attracted a large number of vicious heads because of its huge structure.
<br><br>
When the heads first appeared in the Source World, the Evil God instantly realized that something wrong was going on. With this, he immediately summoned numerous avatars of himself and mobilized all the forces.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Bloom Divine Province, the place had been plagued by earthquakes for almost a month now.
<br><br>
Along with this, a terrible rumor had been spreading among the citizens.
<br><br>
"Did you know? There are countless humongous and horrifying heads underground. These are what caused these earthquakes!"
<br><br>
"They said these heads are hundreds of millions of feet in height. They can devour anything, living or inanimate!"
<br><br>
"We're no longer safe here. We have to run away from this place!"
<br><br>
But with all these, others just laughed at the nasty rumors and didn't pay much attention to it. After all, a large number of powerful warriors were gathered in the Source World. Even if the rumors were true and the monstrous heads surfaced from the ground, they believed that the warriors of the Source World would save the day.
<br><br>
However, the Oneness Sky Palace no longer existed. The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were also destroyed. Right now, no other forces had assumed control over the Bloom Divine Province. Thus, it was currently a land without a ruler.
<br><br>
With this, some of the big clans around the Clear Lake were preparing to grab the supremacy in the region.
<br><br>
The Bloom Divine Province had always been a birthplace of great talents, and it had the reputation of nurturing a potential super force. Thus, it should only be a matter of time when one of these large clans rose and replaced the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
In recent days, in order to compete for the power and profit, the big clans around the Clear Lake had been holding continuous competitions.
<br><br>
The geniuses at the Other Shore Realm from various clans participated and gave their all to battle it out in the ring.
<br><br>
This day, tens of thousands of people gathered by the Clear Lake to watch another set of breathtaking matches. On the surface of the lake, two young elites were competing like two atrocious waterfowls.
<br><br>
Every time they would exchange a blow, a deafening sound would reverberate, creating ripples and shaking even the depths of the lake.
<br><br>
The fierce showdown between the two young elites had lasted for about five minutes. One of them, who was in the third stage of the Other Shore Realm, obviously had a greater edge. Under his constant attacks, his opponent's strength gradually weakened.
<br><br>
"Take this! Shining Dragon Sword Skill!" the elite on the third stage of the Other Shore Realm roared mightily, ready to finish his opponent with this strike.
<br><br>
At the same time, a violent earthquake occurred again.
<br><br>
This time, the tremor they felt was much stronger than the previous ones.
<br><br>
Fissures appeared on the ground and some houses even started to collapse.
<br><br>
However, because of the frequent waves of earthquakes recently, nobody was alarmed anymore. They weren't fazed and still focused their attention on the on-going battle.
<br><br>
As soon as the third-stage Other Shore Realm warrior employed his sword skill, the water in the Clear Lake started to decline sharply. In just a few seconds, the entire lake dried up, exposing the massive lakebed.
<br><br>
"Wait. Was this caused by the sword skill of that young man from the Su Clan?"
<br><br>
"I don't think so. Even if he's a promising warrior, he's still currently in the third stage of the Other Shore Realm. He can't be the one who did this."
<br><br>
"If that's true, then what happened to the Clear Lake?"
<br><br>
The onlookers chatted with each other, figuring out what had happened to the water in the lake.
<br><br>
Even the two competitors above the lake were taken aback. They immediately stopped their battle, startled with the strange phenomenon.
<br><br>
As the water in the lake completely disappeared, everyone soon saw a huge sculpture of a face on the lakebed. It had vivid eyes, mouth, and nose.
<br><br>
Some people thought that this sculpture was just probably hidden at the bottom of the lake all this time.
<br><br>
However, as some stared intently at it, they were instantly reminded of that circulating ominous rumor.
<br><br>
The Source World had already been invaded by tens of millions of these ferocious heads. Sooner or later, this world would be completely devoured by them if nothing was done.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! What they saw was a head five hundred times its original size.
<br><br>
It had been biting and drilling in a specific direction all this time. It was like a worm that pervaded a fruit. A very long and thin cave was created under the Source World, and now, this head finally emerged above the surface of the Source World through the earth of the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
It meant that the recent earthquakes in the Bloom Divine Province were all caused by this single giant head.
<br><br>
For these heads, living creatures were actually better prey than any other substances.
<br><br>
Thus, as it emerged from the bottom of the Clear Lake, it immediately opened its huge mouth and bit towards the edge of the lakeshore and attacked the people there.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Crack! A huge tooth mark appeared on the edge of the lakeshore. Both the young elites and tens of thousands of the onlookers were instantly swallowed into the head's mouth. They didn't even have the time to react and escape with the frightening speed of the huge head.
<br><br>
Similar to the scene that just happened by the Clear Lake, this same disaster was simultaneously happening throughout the Source World.
<br><br>
The head that appeared in the Clear Lake wasn't even the worst. Some heads were about tens of thousands of times their original size, appearing in various large provinces.
<br><br>
These colossal heads were by no means something that ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm could handle. At best, they might be able to resist the heads that were about a thousand times their original size.
<br><br>
At the edge of the Clear Lake's bank, some lucky survivors started running like crazy, trying to escape from the huge head that had already killed thousands of people in just a blink of the eye.
<br><br>
One of them suddenly stopped in his tracks as his body twitched. His face became blurry and gradually turned into that of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Six Truths Explosion!"
<br><br>
Without the slightest hesitation, this replica of the Evil God summoned six energy balls of different colors from his head, hands, feet, and abdomen.
<br><br>
Right after he gathered them, he teleported into the mouth of the huge head and rammed these energy balls into it.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! A devastating pillar of light penetrated the head. It left a huge hole in it, where the light surged into the sky. Everyone in the Bloom Divine Province could clearly see this dazzling pillar of light.
<br><br>
The blinding light continued to disintegrate the head until it turned to dust.
<br><br>
At the same time, about hundreds of provinces away from the Clear Lake, a large bed lay at the center of a broad, black hall.
<br><br>
On this very bed, Edna was resting in the arms of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Recently, the Evil God had been bad-tempered and irritable.
<br><br>
Sometimes, Edna would even doubt if this man was the real Evil God.
<br><br>
Behind the hall where they were was a huge square. Here, over ten thousand people were sitting with their legs crossed as if in meditation.
<br><br>
These were all replicas of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Although they were just replicas, they were no different from the real Evil God. They shared the same strength, aura, and even thoughts.
<br><br>
As the current ruler of the Source World, the Evil God discerned that the invasion of the menacing heads would bring huge troubles.
<br><br>
If he failed to eliminate all these abominable heads, the Source World would be devoured and destroyed in a short time.
<br><br>
However, though he had already mobilized all his forces throughout the Source World, and even asked the help of the Nihility race through the Black Ship, he still couldn't find an effective way to deal with the heads.
<br><br>
A few days ago, the Black Ship had already contacted the Nihility race, and the Grandmaster of Heaven himself descended to the Source World to check on the situation. However, he only told the Evil God that he would try to think of a solution and quickly returned to the Other Shore afterward.
<br><br>
At this critical moment, he could only rely on himself to solve this crisis.
<br><br>
It might be too late for the Source World if he kept on waiting for the help of others.
<br><br>
On a whim, he gathered over ten thousand of his replicas in an attempt to think of a viable solution to their dilemma. This was the reason why these replicas were all currently at the square.
<br><br>
Some of them were thinking by themselves, while others were discussing in groups.
<br><br>
Even the Six Truths Explosion, which was the powerful skill that his replica had performed to vanquish the huge head by the Clear Lake, was a result of this kind of brainstorming.
<br><br>
He believed that little by little, they were making progress in destroying their opponents. However, because of the overwhelming number of the heads, the current methods that they formulated were still far from enough to annihilate them all.
<br><br>
That was why they couldn't afford to stop thinking of a better way.
<br><br>
Lying on the comfortable bed, the Evil God slowly let out a deep sigh.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Edna tied up her silky black hair, gazed at the Evil God, and said, "With so many avatars helping you to find a solution, why do you have to bother yourself about it?"
<br><br>
The Evil God was getting too absorbed with it that his temperament had changed drastically.
<br><br>
In the past, all he needed to do was destroy everything as he pleased. He was just a reckless and happy-go-lucky guy that did whatever he wanted.
<br><br>
But since he assumed control of the Source World, he now had the responsibility to protect the land and the people.
<br><br>
And this was something that he was not good at.
<br><br>
"If all the heads came from a single direction, I wouldn't need to worry this much. But they're everywhere! They're scattered in the entire chaos, and they come from all directions. It's just impossible to guard against them. I don't think there is a perfect solution to deal with them," the Evil God complained in an annoyed tone.
<br><br>
With her hand covering her bare shoulder, Edna buried her head in thought for a while. Then, out of nowhere, she just blurted out, "Is there anything that would repel the heads?"
<br><br>
"Repel the heads…" The Evil God furrowed his brows as he entertained this thought. After a few moments, his eyes suddenly lit up, and there was a faint grin on his face. "Edna, what do you think would they hate the most?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4181 Nipping Consciousness In The Bud To the Evil God, anyone who was against him must be eliminated.
<br><br>
Even those who didn't provoke him would end up dead. Those who dared take the initiative to provoke him would face even worse.
<br><br>
The Evil God had been looking for a way to kill the heads after they invaded his territory.
<br><br>
Why would he care what they hated the most? But he changed his mind now.
<br><br>
The Source World was too large. Even if the Evil God had tens of thousands of avatars, he still couldn't guard every corner.
<br><br>
If he could use some method to force them to gather in one place, he could then easily kill them.
<br><br>
Edna saw the sparkle in the Evil God's eyes, but didn't know what was on his mind. She stuttered, "I...I don't know what they hate."
<br><br>
"But they will know," the Evil God said confidently.
<br><br>
An idea was forming in the Evil God's mind.
<br><br>
And then, a consciousness appeared in the minds of the ten thousand Evil Gods in the huge black square. The order given to them by their master was always top priority to them.
<br><br>
"The master orders us to find the weakness of these heads?"
<br><br>
"What do they hate?"
<br><br>
"We have to test them one by one. We will find it out!"
<br><br>
"These heads are stupid, and their behavior pattern is simple. We can start from their mode of behavior!"
<br><br>
These avatars of the Evil God were as smart as their master. The Evil God had only to give them a hint and they would begin to brainstorm and make plans.
<br><br>
Tens of thousands of avatars were now in a heated discussion, the huge square suddenly becoming noisy. It had now become difficult to hear anything.
<br><br>
"It's so noisy! Stop it, you idiots!" an avatar cursed angrily.
<br><br>
The other avatars quickly closed their mouths and began to communicate with each other through their spiritual sense.
<br><br>
The tens of thousands of avatars thought differently, but they were very efficient and quickly came up with several plans.
<br><br>
These plans were voted on and they finally decided on one that seemed to be the best. They would split up to test the characteristics of the heads.
<br><br>
The avatars had originally been searching for the heads in the Source World in order to kill them, but they now quickly changed their strategy.
<br><br>
Since the Heavenly Martial Province was the weakest, it had attracted the most heads.
<br><br>
The Evil God had killed for several rounds here, but before long, this place would once again be filled with heads. The heads here were the most suitable for them to carry out the test.
<br><br>
Dozens of avatars found some hosts in the Heavenly Martial Province and possessed them in unison. They captured dozens of heads that had expanded to several times their original size in the shortest time and began the test.
<br><br>
"The first test, flame theurgy!"
<br><br>
Blazing flames swept out and enveloped a head.
<br><br>
The flames burned the head till it turned black.
<br><br>
But the head still had its mouth open wide, trying to devour everything in front of it. It even swallowed a portion of the flames.
<br><br>
"Stronger flames!"
<br><br>
Sizzle! When another avatar released more powerful flames, the head couldn't bear it anymore, and cracks appeared on its surface. Before long, it exploded into pieces, the force emanating from the center and rippling towards the edges.
<br><br>
Their goal was not to kill the heads, which meant that the first test had failed.
<br><br>
"The second test, use the ice wall to trap the head!"
<br><br>
"The third test, use lightning to bind it."
<br><br>
"The fourth test, use the force of fear."
<br><br>
"The fifth test, possess its consciousness."
<br><br>
In less than two hours, the avatars had tested dozens of theurgies.
<br><br>
The heads had no soul, so they couldn't be controlled by the soul-related theurgies.
<br><br>
The other theurgies would cause them no fear. The heads would be killed once the power of the theurgies increased.
<br><br>
"The fifty-sixth test, surround the head with space walls!"
<br><br>
A complete cubic space trapped within itself a head that had expanded to ten times its original size. The head screamed as it crashed into the space wall, with a loud bang.
<br><br>
"The fifty-sixth test failed. Remove the space walls and prepare for the next test," an avatar announced.
<br><br>
"Wait," another avatar said. "Don't remove the space walls."
<br><br>
"Don't waste time," the first avatar said, frowning.
<br><br>
"Look, the head didn't bite into the space wall. It looks like it can't see the wall!" the second avatar said.
<br><br>
At this, the other avatars turned their gazes to the head and did indeed find something strange.
<br><br>
"Remove the other five space walls," the Evil God ordered.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!"
<br><br>
Once the other space walls were removed, the head still didn't react and continued to strike the space wall before it.
<br><br>
"The head can't sense the power of space!" As the avatar spoke, he wrapped his body with the power of space, and then flew towards the head.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang, bang..."
<br><br>
The huge head hit the avatar over and over again, which was tiny compared to the head's size, but it looked like it never intended to open its mouth and swallow the tiny thing that was in its way! "We've found a way," the avatar said with a smile.
<br><br>
Before long, an avatar flew into the hall from the square.
<br><br>
"Master, I think I have found a way to deal with them," the avatar said.
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes flashed with surprise. "So soon?"
<br><br>
It had only been a few hours since Edna had reminded him, and they had already found a way to restrain the heads. The Evil God was naturally surprised.
<br><br>
"The perception of the heads is very poor. They can't perceive space. As long as we hide behind the space walls, they won't be able to sense their targets," the avatar said.
<br><br>
"Space?" The Evil God thought for a while before saying, "But it's still quite difficult to construct a huge space wall that can completely wrap around the Source World."
<br><br>
"There's no need for the space wall," the avatar said. "You can stretch the space wall into a net, and the heads won't notice it. I've already tested it."
<br><br>
A smile appeared on the Evil God's face. "Brilliant! Very good!"
<br><br>
The avatar also smiled. "I need a reward."
<br><br>
"What do you want?" the Evil God said, his eyes stunned but wary.
<br><br>
The avatar pointed at Edna, who was standing beside the Evil God, and said, "She is your woman, and also mine."
<br><br>
Edna hadn't expected the avatar to make such a request and didn't know what to do.
<br><br>
What was more, she couldn't tell who the real Evil God was and who the avatar was. Sometimes, she even suspected that the real Evil God had died a long time ago.
<br><br>
"Okay," the Evil God said, nodding. "Come here!"
<br><br>
The avatar walked over to the Evil God.
<br><br>
But the moment he got close to the Evil God, the Evil God stretched out a hand and gently tapped at his forehead. The avatar's face began to change, and he turned into a black skinned creature.
<br><br>
Phew! The creature had gained his own consciousness, but before he could realize what was happening to him, the Evil God cut his neck off his body.
<br><br>
Black blood splashed all over the ground.
<br><br>
"Darling, why did you kill him?" asked Edna.
<br><br>
"He has gained his own consciousness. If his consciousness grows stronger, he would definitely betray me," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, the avatars of the Evil God were completely in sync with their master, and they executed their master's orders without any questions.
<br><br>
But if they were separated from their master for a long time or had any kind of special experience, their consciousness would begin to deviate.
<br><br>
If this were to happen, the Evil God would kill them without mercy.
<br><br>
The person who knew one the best was always themselves, and they would never be loyal to anyone else. Once these avatars gained an independent consciousness, they would even betray themselves.
<br><br>
Chapter 4182 My World The very next day, tens of thousands of Evil Gods appeared all over the entire Source World.
<br><br>
Each Evil God stood far away from each other. Their distance was of several provinces apart. They were equally distributed throughout the outer layer of the Source World.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, the Evil Gods whispered, "Space truth..."
<br><br>
The Evil God's current understanding of the space truth had reached an even higher level. With this, he was able to use the power of space freely.
<br><br>
Countless wisps of space as thick as a thumb had intertwined around the Evil Gods. They each formed a structure that looked like a fishing net.
<br><br>
Under the Evil Gods' control, the fishing nets fanned out in every direction with them as the center.
<br><br>
After a few minutes, each of them had already covered a hundred thousand feet.
<br><br>
Soon enough, they had expanded to one billion feet.
<br><br>
About two hours later, each space net had covered an area that was as large as a whole province.
<br><br>
After six hours, the space nets laid out by each Evil God began to interlink.
<br><br>
Moments later, all of the space nets in every corner of the world had connected. The entire Source World was now completely covered.
<br><br>
Previously, the enormous Source World had been attracting innumerable heads. Before the space nets completely enveloped it, these heads were like a school of fish affected by the tide. They rushed towards the only remaining weak points of this world.
<br><br>
But as soon as the space nets covered those weak points, the heads instantly lost their targets. They fled outside the Source World like headless chickens.
<br><br>
Due to their low intelligence, they had no idea what had just happened.
<br><br>
They only knew that their prey had mysteriously disappeared.
<br><br>
Instinctively, these heads devoured everything that could be devoured. It seemed that the creatures of their kind were also on their menus. Soon enough, the situation became even more chaotic. They began to devour each other frenziedly.
<br><br>
In the hall, there was a space wall that showed the movements outside the Source World. With this, the Evil God could monitor the situation outside without going out himself.
<br><br>
"Amazing! They are really not attacking the Source World anymore. Has the Source World been saved?" Edna asked the Evil God. Her face was full of admiration and gratitude.
<br><br>
"Of course," the Evil God replied. There was a gentle smile on his face.
<br><br>
He seemed to be in a good mood.
<br><br>
The next thing on their list was to clean up the remaining heads inside the Source World. It was time to exterminate them.
<br><br>
There were countless heads that managed to enter the Source World. In addition to that, there were many heads that grew rapidly and were ten thousand times larger than others. Nevertheless, it wasn't really difficult to kill these heads.
<br><br>
After a short while, they suddenly heard footsteps from outside the hall.
<br><br>
Shera slowly walked in and stopped beside the Evil God.
<br><br>
She hardly paid any attention to Edna. She merely turned to the Evil God and said, "Someone on the Other Shore wants to see you."
<br><br>
"Is it the Grandmaster of Heaven again? He's not needed here. If it is him, he doesn't have to descend. The crisis in the Source World is over," the Evil God said casually. He just kept watching the space wall.
<br><br>
"It's over? But how..." Shera was slightly stunned at this news. "Those heads..." She couldn't find the right words as she watched what was happening outside through the space wall.
<br><br>
"I have already blocked them from the outside. Although, it will take a few more days to get rid of the heads within the Source World," the Evil God responded indifferently.
<br><br>
"How did you do that?" Once again, her face was full of utter amazement.
<br><br>
"Our effort is the most decisive factor," the Evil God replied calmly. "So, you can tell the Grandmaster of Heaven that he is not needed here anymore."
<br><br>
"It's not the Grandmaster of Heaven who is coming this time," Shera informed him.
<br><br>
"Then, who else? Is it Samantha, Sienna, and Stella this time?" The Evil God rarely had visitors. He wondered who it could be.
<br><br>
"No. It's a Bird Master," Shera answered.
<br><br>
"And who or what is that? I've never heard of it before." The Evil God's curiosity was aroused.
<br><br>
"Once before, you asked me why a powerful giant ape would appear on the Pear Hill. This Bird Master and the giant ape actually belong to the same category. Therefore, he will be able to answer your question," Shera replied simply.
<br><br>
In the Jade Pure Realm, the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect waged a fierce war against each other. But in the end, the Bird Spirit Sect suffered a crushing defeat.
<br><br>
At the final moment of their battle, the Snake Spirit King almost destroyed the Bird Spirit King's coordinates! But for some unknown reason, the Snake Spirit King did not go through with it and decided to spare the Bird Spirit Sect. No one knew what kind of news he heard during that moment.
<br><br>
Through their coordinates, all of the Bird Masters and Treacherous Beings that perished in the war could revive. This meant that their defeat did not cause substantial losses. However, it made the Bird Masters understand a simple yet painful truth.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit Sect was far stronger than the Bird Spirit Sect. It would be absolutely impossible to defeat them on the Other Shore! For this reason, the Bird Spirit Sect summoned the members of the Nihility race in secret. And so during that period of time, the Black Ship was not able to contact the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Now, the Bird Spirit Sect knew that the Evil God was in control of the Source World. Hence, they fixed their eyes upon the chaos once again.
<br><br>
After the Evil God heard this news from Shera, his expression became guarded. "Fine, I want to meet him."
<br><br>
With that, Shera smiled sweetly and took out the Descending Ring.
<br><br>
Flash! The entire hall was covered in bright light.
<br><br>
As the Descending Ring radiated with a dazzling golden light, it floated into the air. Shortly after, the figure of a giant bird slowly appeared in front of the Evil God.
<br><br>
This gigantic bird was none other than the Bird Master, Duran.
<br><br>
The Evil God immediately sensed the incredible aura of the Bird Master.
<br><br>
He opened his eyes a little wider.
<br><br>
There was no doubt that this bird was very powerful.
<br><br>
He almost had the same extraordinary aura as the giant ape.
<br><br>
But Duran's strength was still far inferior to that of the giant ape! "Greetings, Bird Master!" Shera instantly bowed low.
<br><br>
Duran didn't pay any attention to her. Instead, he looked directly at the Evil God in front of him. His sharp eyes were scrutinizing every bit of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Are you the one who controls the Source World?" Duran asked straightforwardly.
<br><br>
"Yes, it is me," the Evil God replied impassively.
<br><br>
"Very well..." Duran turned away from him and faced a blank wall.
<br><br>
He then stretched out his sharp and enormous wings. With that, he gently scratched the wall of the hall.
<br><br>
Whoosh! They heard a loud cutting sound.
<br><br>
The Evil God, Edna, and Shera only saw the movement of Duran's wings.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, half of the hall was cut off. With a gentle flap of his wings, a strong gust of wind blew the upper half of the hall away. It drifted off ten thousand miles away from them.
<br><br>
Duran looked around the immense space. "This is the only successful thing the Grandmaster of Heaven has done. He has finally helped us gain control of the Source World."
<br><br>
It was indeed an unexpected advantage to seize control of the primitive land. Nevertheless, it was a huge success for them.
<br><br>
Hearing this, the Evil God frowned. "Just to clarify, it is not you that control the Source World, but me. This is my world," the Evil God stated coldly.
<br><br>
Duran looked at the Evil God and remembered something.
<br><br>
Before he descended, the Grandmaster of Heaven gave him a warning.
<br><br>
The Evil God was very rebellious. He should not try to completely take over him. He needed to be more patient and show the Evil God more respect.
<br><br>
Duran was a smart creature.
<br><br>
Even though he was a superior Bird Master, he was perfectly fine with being humble in front of a mere human. He could restrain his arrogance and would do whatever it took to achieve their goal. As Duran remembered this, he smiled faintly. "That's right. Now, the Bird Spirit Sect and the Nihility race need to rely on you."
<br><br>
The Bird Master quickly adopted a friendly attitude. Duran's sudden change of tack surprised the Evil God. He continued to ask, "What exactly are you? You don't seem like living creatures, yet you have an incredible amount of strength. The giant ape is even more remarkable..."
<br><br>
The scene in which the giant ape moved the Pear Hill out flashed through the Evil God's mind. It was a surreal and astonishing thing to witness.
<br><br>
"We are a level higher than you. We are also the builders of the chaos.
<br><br>
When we die, we will become what I am right now. You can treat us as souls. However, we are called the Treacherous Beings on the Other Shore," answered Duran.
<br><br>
Realization dawned upon the Evil God. "The Treacherous Being... Did that giant ape also die and become a Treacherous Being?" he asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Yes. He is the Monkey Spirit King, one of the known four kings." Duran nodded.
<br><br>
"Even though the Monkey Spirit King is dead, he still has that much strength. What kind of creature was he when he was alive? How could he be so powerful?" the Evil God wondered out loud. It was quite incredible to come across such a powerful being.
<br><br>
"He used to be the strongest warrior in the main world. Even if he is in the form of the Treacherous Being now, he is still powerful," Duran said with a slight smile.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked at Duran. "What about you? Do you also have a king? Is he that powerful too?" The Evil God couldn't quite contain his curiosity.
<br><br>
"Our Bird Spirit King is on par with the Monkey Spirit King," replied Duran. His eyes were full of pride and admiration.
<br><br>
Chapter 4183 Regret Duran didn't treat the Evil God as a subordinate, but actually viewed him as a partner.
<br><br>
Since he was talking to a partner, he felt the need to display the true strength of the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Duran felt quite confident. After all, the Evil God had no choice but to cooperate with the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
"The Bird Spirit King... You said there are four kings. Then, who are the other two?" the Evil God asked curiously.
<br><br>
"The Human Spirit King and the Snake Spirit King," Duran answered.
<br><br>
Then, his eyes grew misty. "The four sects were a family many years ago..."
<br><br>
Usually, it would take a long time to tell the entire story of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
However, Duran took only around five minutes to give a brief overview of the history of the Four Spirits Sect to the Evil God.
<br><br>
When he had finished, the Evil God's eyes lit up with interest. "But since your Bird Spirit Sect has been annihilated by the Snake Spirit Sect, you should take revenge. Why do you want to destroy everything instead?"
<br><br>
"This is the wish of our king. We have to fulfill it," said Duran. All the birds were extremely loyal to their ruler.
<br><br>
The Evil God didn't reply.
<br><br>
After seizing control of the Source World, the Evil God felt no need to destroy it all.
<br><br>
In the past, he had been alone. With his difficult personality, he made too many enemies, so he ended up cooperating with the Nihility race and then later joined the Black Ship.
<br><br>
But once he became the ruler of the Source World, his thoughts somewhat changed. At the very least, he no longer followed the Nihility Way.
<br><br>
But now, he was reliant on the Bird Spirit Sect. No matter how arrogant he was, he knew he couldn't oppose the Bird Spirit King's wish, especially not in front of Duran.
<br><br>
"I once defeated a little black snake in the consciousness of the Source World. Did he come from the Snake Spirit Sect?" The Evil God suddenly recalled.
<br><br>
When he found out that there was an intruder in the consciousness of the Source World, he had been quite puzzled.
<br><br>
Theoretically, only he was supposed to be able to enter that place. What kind of theurgy did the little black snake possess to forcefully enter it? "Yes, it's very likely it was the Snake Spirit King himself," replied Duran.
<br><br>
"Occupying the Source World was originally a part of the Snake Spirit Sect's plan, but you ruined it."
<br><br>
The corners of the Evil God's mouth curled up in amusement as he heard this.
<br><br>
"That's why the chaos was attacked," said Duran.
<br><br>
"You mean these heads?" the Evil God asked, his smile instantly wiped from his face.
<br><br>
Duran nodded. "Yes. The Snake Spirit King has begun a new round of world downgrading. It is to constantly devour these heads in order to expand the Source World, till it grows to be around the size of the chaos."
<br><br>
"Oh?" The Evil God's eyebrows shot up, as his interest was piqued once more. "Expand the Source World to the size of the chaos?"
<br><br>
"Right. Maybe it will be even larger than the chaos, and expand to an unimaginable size..." Duran said.
<br><br>
"How does one devour these heads?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
Duran smiled. "Just smash the heads in the Source World. You've already devoured lots of heads. Didn't you notice the changes in the Source World?"
<br><br>
"Changes?"
<br><br>
The Evil God closed his eyes gently and entered the consciousness of the Source World.
<br><br>
The Source World was too vast. Although he had devoured a lot of heads, the Source World was so large that he hadn't noticed the small change before.
<br><br>
After carefully examining the Source World, the Evil God slowly opened his eyes wide. "The Source World has actually expanded by about ten percent!"
<br><br>
The Evil God grew excited. This speed of expansion was actually quite terrifying.
<br><br>
He didn't expect that devouring the heads would have such benefits.
<br><br>
"There is only one Source World in the chaos... So, are you saying the chaos will also belong to me in the future?" the Evil God asked pointedly.
<br><br>
Duran shook his head. "There is only one Source World, but there are several primitive lands. Since the Snake Spirit King has begun the downgrading, he will definitely use another primitive land. Therefore, you have to devour as many heads as possible, because there will inevitably be a battle between your Source World and the Snake Spirit King's primitive land, and only one primitive land will be left in the end."
<br><br>
"There will be a battle..." the Evil God echoed mindlessly. Lowering his head, he was lost in thought for a while. Zen suddenly came to mind.
<br><br>
If these heads were all over the chaos, it would be difficult for the Pear Hill to escape. Was this the end for Zen? The Evil God had always regarded Zen as his ultimate opponent. Now that the Snake Spirit King had suddenly entered the picture, he felt somewhat regretful.
<br><br>
"You must win this battle. Don't worry, the Nihility race and the Bird Spirit Sect will help you."
<br><br>
After saying that, Duran exited the Source World.
<br><br>
One day later, the Evil God ordered the transformation of the Source World.
<br><br>
Over ten thousand avatars desperately racked their brains to try to come up with a new plan quickly.
<br><br>
They planned to create three huge cracks at the edge of the Source World, each of which spanning hundreds of large provinces. Within each crack, they would arrange huge magic arrays in the provinces.
<br><br>
Once the heads in the chaos were lured into the cracks, the arrays would be activated to immediately kill those heads.
<br><br>
This plan was exactly the same as the Snake Spirit King's.
<br><br>
And it all went very smoothly. However, the Evil God was visibly depressed these days.
<br><br>
Even Edna couldn't figure out what was going on in his mind. Nothing she said could comfort him.
<br><br>
One day, the Evil God was staring blankly at the sky in the distance when someone suddenly draped a robe over his shoulders. Frowning slightly, he asked in an annoyed tone, "What are you doing here?"
<br><br>
The figure standing behind him was not Edna, but Shera.
<br><br>
Ever since Edna came, the Evil God rarely ever talked to Shera.
<br><br>
This saddened Shera greatly, but she didn't show it. After all, she was still the liaison between the Evil God and the Nihility race.
<br><br>
"I know why you are unhappy," said Shera, eyes flashing.
<br><br>
The Evil God glanced at her indifferently. "What do you know?"
<br><br>
Shera leaned down to whisper in his ear, "You think you have lost Zen, your opponent."
<br><br>
The Evil God didn't say anything. Instead, he just let out a heavy sigh.
<br><br>
"He might not die. Perhaps, just like you, he is rapidly growing," said Shera.
<br><br>
The Evil God raised his eyebrows and turned around abruptly to stare at Shera. "What do you mean?" he demanded. "Can the Pear Hill escape this disaster?"
<br><br>
"I don't know for sure," said Shera. "But there is one thing I am certain of.
<br><br>
You should have been born in a primitive land. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to devour Usman, nor would you be able to obtain the consciousness of the Source World."
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes lit up excitedly. "You mean that Zen's inner world is a primitive land?"
<br><br>
"Yes," said Shera with a nod.
<br><br>
When the Evil God had been absorbed by Zen, Shera and the brass man had already suspected this, but she was not so sure at that time.
<br><br>
However, when the Evil God successfully devoured Usman, she was certain.
<br><br>
As the Evil God heard this, his expression suddenly relaxed. Smiling confidently, he said, "I'll definitely win this competition."
<br><br>
Chapter 4184 Alliance Somewhere in the depths of the chaos, a huge pyramid spun slowly.
<br><br>
Behind this pyramid was an empty void, the heads previously scattered already devoured.
<br><br>
It had now entered a new world.
<br><br>
With all the heads cleared out, three light columns suddenly extended from the three, large mouths.
<br><br>
The energy within these columns was very weak yet very stable and had the power to spread for billions of miles across the chaos.
<br><br>
Although these heads were stupid, they had an extraordinarily keen sense when it came to energy. They crazily followed the light columns as they swept past them.
<br><br>
Once the number of heads that followed the light columns was enough, the distance between each beam narrowed in such a way that they were all led towards the mouths of the pyramid. This was how all those heads from before were cleared out all at once.
<br><br>
As the pyramid devoured the heads with frighteningly high efficiency, it expanded a thousand times in size.
<br><br>
It was small compared to the Source World but the rate at which it grew was astonishing.
<br><br>
On the other side of the chaos, Zen used a similar way to clear the heads.
<br><br>
He had asked the Snake Goddess to spread her shadow and used the energy beams to attract the heads, and this method initially worked.
<br><br>
However, as the primitive land continued to expand, the Snake Goddess's shadow fell short.
<br><br>
Her shadow could theoretically extend at an infinite distance. If she was given enough time, she could even spread her shadow across the chaos.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the speed at which her shadow extended was too slow.
<br><br>
According to what the ancestry-level bloodline said, a round of competition would begin after the downgrade started and those bigger in size would have a great advantage.
<br><br>
Zen knew he had to come up with a better method if he wanted to absorb more heads in the least amount of time.
<br><br>
Since Snake Goddess' shadow proved ineffective, he decided to gather everyone on the jadeite platform for a brainstorming session.
<br><br>
What they needed was something that could spread far and wide at a fast enough rate.
<br><br>
"Light," Gerald was quick to propose.
<br><br>
Light not only contained energy but also had the ability to spread all throughout the chaos.
<br><br>
Once again, Zen asked the ancestry-level bloodline to transform the primitive land.
<br><br>
Not long after, six, huge arrays appeared on the surface of the primitive land. These six arrays served no purpose of defense and only released strong, enduring light.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
As a burst of powerful energy was injected into the arrays, it scattered into strong beams of light in all directions.
<br><br>
It was as if there was a huge sun in the chaos as these blazing beams of white light expanded hundreds of millions of miles away. They effectively drew in the heads within this range which then rushed towards the primitive land.
<br><br>
All three primitive lands within the chaos were able to figure out unique ways to expand and grow.
<br><br>
As the rate at which they consumed the heads wasn't slow, their growth rate itself was astonishing.
<br><br>
For perspective, it was important to remember that the chaos was enormous.
<br><br>
For them to grow to a size comparable to the chaos, given their already astonishing expansion rate, was still going to take some time.
<br><br>
Fast forward to a month later.
<br><br>
Several humans appeared at the Night View Island's entrance on the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The man at the helm was handsome and had a heroic expression on his face.
<br><br>
Behind him were three women and two other men.
<br><br>
As they approached the pool, two Monkey Masters suddenly appeared.
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
"Take one more step and you die."
<br><br>
The two Monkey Masters were on the defensive, ready to strike if they did not do as they said.
<br><br>
These two took their jobs of guarding the entrance to the Night View Island seriously. Nobody was allowed to approach it.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, the Monkey Masters would've already killed whoever decided to venture close to the entrance.
<br><br>
However, this group was an exception because they were humans.
<br><br>
Over the years, the Monkey Masters made a lot of contact with the human race. Moreover, Zen also helped them awaken the Monkey Spirit King which contributed to their changed perspective of the human race.
<br><br>
The man leading his group bowed respectfully to the two Monkey Masters. "I am the leader of the Nihility race, Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Greetings, Monkey Masters!"
<br><br>
"The Nihility race? Grandmaster of Heaven? Aren't you the ones supported by the Bird Spirit Sect?" one of the Monkey Masters said with a strange expression on his face.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven gave him a gracious smile. "Yes. I came here with Bird Master Lawler's coordinates."
<br><br>
Lawler's reputation in the Four Spirits Sect was only second to that of the four leaders and was even on par with the Great Ape King. He was given the title "Divine Phoenix" and was no doubt a well-known figure.
<br><br>
His name surprised the two Monkey Masters who grew even more cautious against this group.
<br><br>
The coordinates were equivalent to the lives of the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
This person had come bearing Lawler's life! "Why are you here?" one of the Monkey Masters asked.
<br><br>
"The Bird Master Lawler wants to discuss an alliance with the Monkey Spirit King," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied.
<br><br>
Without further ado, the two Monkey Masters sent this message to the Night View Island.
<br><br>
A reply came soon enough and the Grandmaster of Heaven was allowed entry into the Night View Island but only if he came alone.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven entered the pond and went up the passage.
<br><br>
Once he emerged on the other side, he was guided to a palace on the shore.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, there was no Monkey Spirit King in the palace, only a group of human heroes led by the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zen was also there on the side.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven's face wrinkled with a smile.
<br><br>
"Brother, we finally meet again," he exclaimed good-naturedly.
<br><br>
However, his enthusiasm was only returned with a look of indifference.
<br><br>
"Hello, brother."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, his gaze fell on Zen.
<br><br>
Back when he had just climbed up to Stage Thirty-two, Zen already struck the Grandmaster of Heaven as someone special. He never expected that this kid would actually affect the balance between the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven simply brushed his indifference aside.
<br><br>
"There is another person who wants to see you! You're not going to believe who it is!"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven raised an eyebrow. "Who?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded at Zen and soon enough, a figure appeared above the latter's head. It was none other the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, or rather, a strand of his soul.
<br><br>
"The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord..." the Grandmaster of Heaven could only murmur in astonishment. Was he truly seeing correctly? He had no idea that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord hid in the Jade Pure Realm, and he never expected to see him here.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord gave him a small smile. "The three of us have finally gathered together. What a beautiful and exciting surprise."
<br><br>
"I am surprised but not excited," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied coldly. He still held a few grudges.
<br><br>
"It seems you're still angry about the past. Given the chance, I'll have Ziya apologize to you personally," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven harrumphed. "That disciple of yours..."
<br><br>
As soon as Ziya's name was mentioned, the frown on the Grandmaster of Heaven's face grew worse.
<br><br>
During the battle in the Pear Hill, he had been exiled in the Deleting Space by Othniel and got kicked out by Ziya. Never had he been so humiliated before in his entire life.
<br><br>
"I'm here to discuss an alliance with the Monkey Spirit King, not to talk about the old days with you," he grumbled pointedly.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "That is correct. The Monkey Spirit King has entrusted the matter to us. You can discuss it with us."
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven couldn't help but frown at Zen's words.
<br><br>
"What did you just say?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4185 Represent The Monkey Spirit King and the Monkey Masters were relatively simpleminded, so they were not good at strategizing.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King had completely put his trust in Zen. In any case, Zen and the humans were against the Snake Spirit Sect, so he figured he could let them deal with everything.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't know the details, so he assumed Zen was submissive to the Monkey Spirit King, just like he was submissive to the Bird Masters.
<br><br>
Therefore, when he had heard Zen's words, he was totally surprised.
<br><br>
"Well, is it any use talking to you?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"Of course it is," replied Zen calmly.
<br><br>
Although Zen wore a serious expression, the Grandmaster of Heaven still didn't believe him. He said, "Don't joke with me, boy."
<br><br>
"I'm not kidding," Zen said gravely.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes shifted to the side of the hall, where two Monkey Masters stood guarding the door. The two Monkey Masters must have heard Zen's words, but they seemed unaffected by them.
<br><br>
Helplessly, the Grandmaster of Heaven said, "Please step back."
<br><br>
Zen and the human heroes did as he said.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven spread out his hands, and two golden crosses appeared in his palms. When the crosses coincided, the coordinates appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
Buzz! A soft sound rang in everyone's ears, and a shadow of a huge bird materialized in front of them. It was the Bird Master, Lawler.
<br><br>
Compared to the other Bird Masters, Lawler was just of medium build, yet his head almost touched the ceiling of the hall.
<br><br>
Lowering his head slightly, he saw the group of humans standing before him. He bore a strange, ambiguous expression. "Grandmaster of Heaven, I came here in person to see the Monkey Spirit King. Why are these humans here?"
<br><br>
"They said we could talk about this matter with them," the Grandmaster of Heaven said with an indifferent shrug.
<br><br>
"Humph!"
<br><br>
Lawler raised his head arrogantly.
<br><br>
In doing so, his head smashed open the ceiling of the hall. Then, he let out a long howl.
<br><br>
"Aoo..."
<br><br>
The high pitched howl echoed all throughout the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Shortly after, a huge and agile figure ran wildly along the lake. When he closed in on the hall, he leapt up high and kicked open the door to the hall.
<br><br>
Boom! The huge vibration made everyone in the hall jump from shock.
<br><br>
"I could hear you howl from afar, Lawler," said Manuel.
<br><br>
Lawler stared at Manuel and sighed discontentedly, "I came to the Night View Island in person. Why are there a group of humans?"
<br><br>
"Humans? What's wrong with humans?" Manuel asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"Don't play dumb. Can the humans from the secondary world really represent you?" Lawler couldn't help but feel annoyed.
<br><br>
The monkey spirits were born a bit dull. It was only then that Manuel understood what Lawler meant. He patted his forehead and laughed heartily. "Of course they can represent us. My king has fully authorized them. You can talk to them about the alliance."
<br><br>
"What? They were authorized?"
<br><br>
Lawler was stunned.
<br><br>
'How stupid can the Monkey Spirit King be!' he cursed silently.
<br><br>
He had known the monkeys were simple-minded, but he had no choice but to grit his teeth and bear it in silence. If he really scolded the Monkey Spirit King, he would be in trouble and wouldn't be able to form an alliance with them.
<br><br>
"If you don't trust them, I can stay for the meeting," Manuel said. "But you have to talk to them."
<br><br>
Manuel jumped high again, bounding towards a corner of the hall to squat.
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Lawler was rendered speechless once more.
<br><br>
Anyway, the Great Ape King had come.
<br><br>
And he had no choice but to ally himself with the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven who stood beside Lawler thought the same, but he was more agitated.
<br><br>
After all, he had always been a bit jittery when faced by the Bird Masters, but he was even more restless now that Zen and his companions had unofficially become the leaders of the Monkey Spirit Sect. Even the legendary Great Ape King was obedient to them! Lawler retracted his head from the ceiling. Glancing at the group of people with a rather disdainful look, he said, "Now that the Snake Spirit Sect has become powerful on the Other Shore, they have begun to downgrade the chaos. If they succeed, all of us will perish. The Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect will be no exception."
<br><br>
Lawler didn't intend to include the humans at first, but he thought about it for a while and added, "Humans will also die. So the only way for us to survive now is to form an alliance between the Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect."
<br><br>
The alliance would also be quite beneficial to the human race. All the human heroes, including the Primeval Lord of Heaven, were very happy about it.
<br><br>
Lawler thought that Zen would definitely agree without hesitation.
<br><br>
But to his annoyance, Zen asked unhurriedly, "As far as I know, both the Bird Spirit Sect and the Nihility race want to destroy everything. Are you giving up on that now?"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's expression darkened at once. 'How dare you! You could say that to me, but you're talking to Lawler now!' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
A murderous look appeared in Lawler's eyes. "That's our concern. It's none of your business."
<br><br>
"It had nothing to do with me in the past, but now that we are going to form an alliance, I have to be clear about it," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
"You..."
<br><br>
Lawler was speechless. He had looked down upon these humans. Now as he heard Zen's words, he couldn't help but feel the rage surging within him. His face contorted in fury, and it took every ounce of his willpower to not strike him down on the spot.
<br><br>
But on second thought, this was the territory of the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Great Ape King was still watching, and most importantly, he was here to form an alliance.
<br><br>
In the end, Lawler willed his anger to simmer down. "We have to fulfill our king's wish, but on the premise that he's safe and sound."
<br><br>
"Do you mean that the Bird Spirit King is in danger now?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," Lawler said through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
Not long ago, the Snake Spirit King had almost killed the Bird Spirit King, but at the last moment, the Snake Spirit King had retreated. Lawler, Duran, Orval and other Bird Masters had yet to figure out why he had chosen to retreat instead.
<br><br>
"What are you going to do after we form an alliance?" Zen continued to ask.
<br><br>
Lawler replied, "We hope the Monkey Spirit Sect will help us to launch a counterattack against the Snake Spirit Sect. We have already come up with a good plan."
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit King that hadn't awakened yet was no match for the Snake Spirit King, but with the help of the invincible Monkey Spirit King, they were hoping to tip the scales in their favor.
<br><br>
"I refuse," Zen replied bluntly.
<br><br>
"Then go to hell!"
<br><br>
The killing intent in Lawler's eyes boiled, and his wing slashed down on Zen's head like a four hundred-foot-long saber.
<br><br>
His speed was so fast that even Manuel squatting nearby did not have the time to react.
<br><br>
Boom! The whole hall was smashed into pieces.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was also shocked. Lawler had killed Zen instantly! Things were getting heated now.
<br><br>
Puff! Not far away, Manuel took a deep breath and blew the dust and rubble into the lake.
<br><br>
As the dust cleared, the Grandmaster of Heaven gasped in shock at what he saw.
<br><br>
Zen was still standing, perfectly unharmed, with one hand stretched out, holding the tip of Lawler's wing with ease.
<br><br>
Lawler was totally shocked. The Grandmaster of Heaven had mentioned this several times before, but it never fully registered on Lawler how strong this human was.
<br><br>
But even so, how could he easily resist his attack? Chapter 4186 Obey My Orders A deep voice cut through the quiet air. "Judging from your attitude, it seems that you don't want to talk about the alliance any more." Zen tightened his grip on Lawler's wing and coldly added, "Or do you think that I'm a human, who doesn't have the strength or qualifications?"
<br><br>
After Zen said those words, his vice-like grip on Lawler's wing became even more rigid.
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
At that moment, a straight, thin red thread materialized and punctured Lawler's wing.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
Everyone present heard the sound of the thin thread piercing through Lawler's wing, which was followed by countless rays of red light that floated atop the wing's surface.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
Then, the red light cut the wing into several pieces, which fell to the ground.
<br><br>
Manuel, who squatted somewhere not far away, also saw the scene. A chill ran down his spine.
<br><br>
He had heard Tearrag talk about this theurgy of Zen before. The theurgy let Zen cut bodies into pieces quickly with the help of blood streaks.
<br><br>
However, Manuel thought that he was much stronger than Tearrag, so he did not take Zen seriously.
<br><br>
Then again, Lawler was just as powerful as him, and Lawler could not defend himself in the slightest against Zen's red thread. Perhaps if he touched that red thread, he too, would be seriously injured.
<br><br>
"Lawler, I wonder if this strength could be considered powerful in your eyes?" Zen asked coldly.
<br><br>
When Zen uttered those words, both Lawler and the Grandmaster of Heaven were stunned.
<br><br>
After all, Lawler never thought that this human could hurt him.
<br><br>
On the other hand, such injuries naturally meant nothing to the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Lawler trembled slightly, and the Treacherous Being's body parts that fell to the ground jumped up one by one. Then, they quickly stuck to each other until they returned to their previous shape.
<br><br>
"You surprised me," Lawler muttered, the arrogance in his eyes completely gone now.
<br><br>
Zen's attack was like a waterfall that splashed straight into his heart and cleared his mind.
<br><br>
Indeed, both the Monkey Spirit King and the Great Ape King were not stupid. There was certainly a reason they supported Zen so much! "Let's continue to talk about the alliance," Zen calmly stated.
<br><br>
"Didn't you just refuse?" Lawler said in surprise.
<br><br>
"That's because your condition is not right," Zen said with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
"What do you want?"
<br><br>
When the Grandmaster of Heaven heard Lawler ask such a question, he could not help but sigh inwardly.
<br><br>
Although Lawler was powerful, he did not know how to negotiate.
<br><br>
He had been quite arrogant to the humans ever since the beginning, but Zen had managed to get some information out of him. He had revealed that the Bird Spirit King was currently in an unfavorable situation and that they could not get the upper hand if they did things recklessly.
<br><br>
If he asked Zen what he wanted now, then Zen would surely demand many benefits.
<br><br>
"The condition for this alliance to take place is that all the members of the Bird Spirit Sect must obey my orders," Zen answered.
<br><br>
Lawler's anger, which he had restrained, rose again.
<br><br>
This human being did make him exceptionally mad! "You even want our Bird Spirit Sect to obey your orders! Does the Monkey Spirit Sect also listen to you?" he screeched, his high-pitched voice laced with grief and resentment.
<br><br>
He said these words to the Great Ape King.
<br><br>
Yet, Manuel only said, "It's okay to listen to him. That's what our king said..."
<br><br>
The monkey spirits also weren't good at strategy, so they just handed over the tasks that required such a skill to this group of humans.
<br><br>
When Lawler knew about it, he felt even more enraged. Was this really the once invincible Monkey Spirit Sect? Disheartened, he turned around to leave, but in reality, he could not leave like this.
<br><br>
Even the Bird Masters couldn't stand the current situation, so they had to get the Monkey Spirit Sect's strong support.
<br><br>
After Lawler thought carefully for a while, he gritted his teeth and said, "It's alright to listen to you. All of the Bird Masters are at your disposal, but there are two exceptions!"
<br><br>
"Please go ahead," said Zen.
<br><br>
"First, our king will not listen to you; and second, the Source World and the Evil God are also exempted," Lawler replied.
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit Sect would never put their king in danger. After all, Sheehan had yet to awaken, and he was much weaker than the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Source World and the Evil God were two essential keys that could allow the Bird Spirit Sect to turn the tables. They had already caught Duran and the others' attention. Furthermore, Lawler knew well about the conflict and relationship between Zen and the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Okay, but I'll be in charge of the top ten Bird Masters' coordinates," said Zen.
<br><br>
In reality, Zen did not trust the Bird Masters at all. Moreover, the Bird Spirit Sect could become his enemies at any time because of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Therefore, he had to have these Treacherous Beings' coordinates in his hands.
<br><br>
At that point, Lawler slightly hesitated to grant Zen's request. First and foremost, the coordinates were their lives.
<br><br>
He stalled for a moment and asked, "Will you... really help us fight against the Snake Spirit Sect?"
<br><br>
"Of course," Zen answered with a smile. "The Snake Spirit Sect must be our common enemy. Even if we don't ally with the Bird Spirit Sect, we will still fight them head-on," he added.
<br><br>
"Then next time I will bring the other Bird Masters' coordinates..."
<br><br>
As soon as Lawler finished speaking, a ball of Light of Annihilation burst out from his neck. Countless small lightning bolts wrapped around his body. As a result, his massive body quickly exploded and disappeared, and only the coordinates in the Grandmaster of Heaven's hands remained.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven put away the coordinates, looked at Zen and said, "Goodbye!"
<br><br>
Even when he was about to leave, he did not talk to his two senior fellow disciples at all.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven stared blankly at the Grandmaster of Heaven's receding figure. "He still takes those matters to heart," he muttered.
<br><br>
"Some people are destined to travel on a single path. Don't force them. As for the alliance with the Bird Spirit Sect, I do not know if they are sincere or not," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said calmly.
<br><br>
"They are sincere," the real Snake Goddess replied.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement and said, "Since the Bird Spirit King has not awakened yet, they have no other choice. The Bird Masters can help us!"
<br><br>
"But there's one thing that's quite strange," the real Snake Goddess said with a frown. "Since the Bird Spirit Sect is completely weak, why didn't the Snake Spirit Sect kill them together with the Bird Spirit King? Was there anything else to it?" she asked.
<br><br>
Not to mention, the people present and even the Bird Masters could not figure out why the Snake Spirit King had let the Bird Spirit King go that day.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, when Lawler returned to the nest in Jade Pure Realm, he told the other Bird Masters about Zen's request.
<br><br>
When Dural, Orval, and the other Bird Masters heard the news, they felt furious.
<br><br>
To give their lives to a mere human being? That was way too much! What a wishful thought! However, the commotion only lasted for a short while. After Lawler analyzed the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the fate of the Bird Spirit Sect, the Bird Masters all fell silent.
<br><br>
It was true that they had no other choice.
<br><br>
In the end, the Bird Masters made a compromise and bowed in front of the Bird Spirit King.
<br><br>
Of course, they never dared to tell the Bird Spirit King, Sheehan, what truly happened. Although Sheehan had not awakened yet, he would surely turn the world upside down once he heard about the matter.
<br><br>
It also went without saying that the Snake Spirit King in the Heavenly Square City saw the scene with the Limited Omnipotent Stone.
<br><br>
"Why? Why don't we stop them?" the Snake Spirit King asked desperately.
<br><br>
"Why should we? Are you afraid of so many Bird Masters?" the black light asked back.
<br><br>
"Of course I'm not afraid of the Bird Masters," the Snake Spirit King said disdainfully.
<br><br>
"Once the Bird Masters join, it would make them enter the Jade Pure Realm faster," the black light said.
<br><br>
"Tell me. What the hell do you want to do?" the Snake Spirit King asked.
<br><br>
The black light didn't answer, but it surprisingly burst into laughter.
<br><br>
Chapter 4187 The Final Preparation The Grandmaster of Heaven returned to the Night View Island a few days later.
<br><br>
He had come to give Zen the Bird Masters' coordinates.
<br><br>
In most cases, putting your life in the hands of others was ill-advised and even idiotic.
<br><br>
But the Bird Masters had nowhere to go and were willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the safety of the Bird Spirit King. They were loyal to him until their deaths.
<br><br>
Most importantly, they truly believed in the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
The friendship between the Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect was much deeper than Zen and his companions had imagined.
<br><br>
On the day the alliance was formed, Manuel squatted beside but still managed to hear every word the two sides spoke.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King and the Great Ape King were both very reckless, but not stupid.
<br><br>
They trusted Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven because they were humans with the same goal they had. This made them trustworthy.
<br><br>
The Bird Masters trusted anyone the Monkey Spirit King did.
<br><br>
However, Manuel had come to retrieve the coordinates on the very same day they were sent to Zen, claiming they were not safe in Zen's hands and should be protected by the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Whether he really wanted them protected or just not to be with Zen remained unknown.
<br><br>
The addition of the Bird Spirit Sect to the alliance gave the human heroes much confidence.
<br><br>
They had, after all, been isolated and helpless once before. But now, against all expectations, they had gained the support of the Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Entering the Jade Pure Realm was then put on the agenda, but they would still need to prepare carefully to find a better opportunity to do so.
<br><br>
In the chaos, the primitive land was still methodically devouring thousands of heads.
<br><br>
The primitive land was once only twice the size of the Pear Hill; it could even touch the top of the primitive land.
<br><br>
But now, if one stood atop the Pear Hill and looked out into the distance, they would see the boundless blood red sky. The primitive land had become incredibly expansive.
<br><br>
Zen had moved the continents that had been floating in the sky down.
<br><br>
They were now placed in the middle of the Pear Hill and the Ruin Graveyard, serving as a bridge between them.
<br><br>
Another three mountains appeared on the other side of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Each mountain had a different shape and was about a third of the size of the Pear Hill. These were the lairs Zen had built for the three Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
The Chaos Ancient Gods had curled up in the Pear Hill before, but now there was enough space for them to have their own lairs.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Thunder rumbled in the blood red sky, causing everyone in the Pear Hill, the continents and the Ruin Graveyard to raise their heads.
<br><br>
"Mother, it's thunder."
<br><br>
In the fairy palace, Salome covered her ears with her hands as fear rattled in her big black eyes.
<br><br>
"Don't be afraid, Salome. It's not thunder; it's your father cultivating."
<br><br>
Margaret held Salome in her arms tightly and tried to soothe her with words of comfort.
<br><br>
"Where is he?" asked Salome.
<br><br>
"Look over there. That figure is your father," said Margaret, pointing up to the sky.
<br><br>
In the middle of the blood red sky, a tiny figure could be seen floating.
<br><br>
There had been a huge change in Zen's inner world in the past few days.
<br><br>
From what they understood of Zen's explanation, they knew the entire Pear Hill had been placed in the primitive land.
<br><br>
More surprisingly, even the Ruin Graveyard and the divine land were placed in the primitive land not long after.
<br><br>
All this considered, Zen's inner world had become quite lively.
<br><br>
Aura, Letitia and Lavender wished to return to the Evolutionary Universe.
<br><br>
Nelly and Laquisha couldn't wait to return to the divine land and reunite with their families.
<br><br>
In the blood mist, Zen's body floated like seaweed in a calm ocean current.
<br><br>
Every five minutes, the blood red thunderbolts whipped at him like vines.
<br><br>
These strikes didn't cause him any pain, but they did infuse strength into his body.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Dozens of blood red thunderbolts surged into Zen, causing cracks to appear on his body, like a porcelain sculpture that was about to shatter into pieces.
<br><br>
"My body is going to break. I can't bear it any longer!" Zen shouted from within the thunder.
<br><br>
The blood red thunder quickly disappeared and the sky returned to peace.
<br><br>
Bright green raindrops then rained down onto Zen's body. They were like tiny bugs, crawling into the cracks and repairing them with visible quickness.
<br><br>
After being refined, Zen's body was absorbed by the ancestry-level bloodline to create a nearly perfect body.
<br><br>
His body now began being refined again. He had already been struck by the blood red thunder thirteen times.
<br><br>
"How long will it take to reach the limit?" Zen asked exhaustedly.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure. As far as I can remember, there is no limit to the strength of the physical body. I once strengthened a host to a truly terrifying level,"
<br><br>
said the ancestry-level bloodline recalling the past.
<br><br>
Its memory had always been a mess. Some key memories had disappeared, but some details remained very clearly.
<br><br>
"Oh? How terrifying do you mean?" Zen's eyebrows trembled slightly.
<br><br>
It must have meant something horrible when it said "terrifying".
<br><br>
"Even a full blow with ninety percent of the Stellar World's energy could not destroy his body," answered the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The Stellar World was the fifth-grade world, referred to as the Deep Space by the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
If it was merely an independent secondary world such as the chaos, Zen would not be that amazed. But the Stellar World was the fifth-grade world! Ninety percent of the energy in the fifth-grade world was undoubtedly a terrifying prospect. What kind of incomprehensible power could withstand such a blow? "It's a pity I've forgotten what that host looked like, and even his name,"
<br><br>
the ancestry-level bloodline sighed dejectedly. "I failed in every battle with those downgraders."
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline possessed intense strength, but its opponents were always able to defeat it.
<br><br>
"This time is different," Zen said abruptly.
<br><br>
"Why is that?" asked the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"Because this time, I'm your host," Zen answered confidently.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was silent for a moment; it did not wish to frustrate Zen. "Let's begin the fourteenth refinement with blood red thunderbolts. After fifty, I will fill your body with space spores."
<br><br>
"Is that another method to strengthen the body?"
<br><br>
"Yes, it strengthens your body with the power of space."
<br><br>
"Is it the final method of strengthening?"
<br><br>
"No, there are several others."
<br><br>
Soon after, the blood red sky rumbled once more and thunderbolts as thick as tree trunks whirled in the sky and rushed towards Zen.
<br><br>
Just then, countless shadows were suddenly reflected in his eyes.
<br><br>
He saw the silhouettes of mountains, thunderbolts, and his body in the distance.
<br><br>
These were the Variable Images! Another Shade Stone descended.
<br><br>
It had only been a few months since the last Shade Stone appeared. It seemed the frequency of its appearance was certainly ramping up.
<br><br>
At the same time, a square black stone floated over a thousand feet above the middle of the Blood Sea Province, quickly attracting the people's attention.
<br><br>
Chapter 4188 Restore As an excellent weapon refining material, the Shade Stones caused fights among warriors every time they appeared in the Source World.
<br><br>
Even this time was no exception...
<br><br>
Although the Blood Sea Province was relatively desolate, it used to be a territory of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
When the Shade Stone appeared out of nowhere, dozens of warriors at the Other Shore Realm scrambled to get close to it–gathering in a circle surrounding it.
<br><br>
"In just two months, two Shade Stones have appeared in the Source World..."
<br><br>
"Who will take this Shade Stone?"
<br><br>
"Should we hand it over to the Ji Clan?"
<br><br>
Although Yellow Thearch had been killed and the Bearing race scarcely annihilated, the Evil God didn't kill the entire clan. The Ji Clan was left standing.
<br><br>
Suddenly, one of the warriors from the crowd started to tremble.
<br><br>
The other warriors were struck with fear as they watched him. The Evil God had once come to the Blood Sea Province to slaughter, and had occupied many people's bodies. Several warriors at the Other Shore Realm had been possessed by the Evil God, so they easily recognized what was happening.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the warrior transformed into the looks of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Hand it over to the Ji Clan?" The Evil God raised his eyebrows at the warrior who said it.
<br><br>
The warrior felt chills across his body as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.
<br><br>
"N-no, of course, we'll hand it over to you..."
<br><br>
The Evil God snorted faintly and looked at the Shade Stone in deep thought.
<br><br>
He showed a confused look and stared at the warrior. The warrior's body shook continuously, and before he could even speak, his body turned into another Evil God.
<br><br>
"The Shade Stone is said to be used as a timer. It recently appeared so frequently. Does this mean that the chaotic era is nearing its end?" the Evil God asked threateningly.
<br><br>
"That should be the case..." the second Evil God replied.
<br><br>
"But the chaos has already undergone a drastic change. In what way will it come to an end?"
<br><br>
"No one can predict..."
<br><br>
"Let the master ask the Bird Masters. Maybe they know."
<br><br>
"Well, what I care about isn't the end of chaos. Since the Snake Spirit King wants to complete the downgrade, he must have considered the possible end of the chaos. What I'm curious about are the shadows I just saw."
<br><br>
"Haven't we talked about them last time?" one of the Evil Gods recalled.
<br><br>
"The Shade Stone itself exists as a timer of the chaos. When it appears, it will cause a disorder in the time sequence. The shadows will then be seen," he added.
<br><br>
"I don't think so. If the time sequence is really out of order, the number of each of our shadows should be the same; but the number of each avatar's shadows and the master's shadows varied greatly. These shadows are probably other versions of ourselves!"
<br><br>
All the avatars of the Evil God were divided on their opinions of the shadows.
<br><br>
Some thought that it was just caused by the disorder in the time sequence, while others felt that there were really other 'versions' of themselves.
<br><br>
These 'versions' were usually hidden within their bodies, and could only be observed when the time sequence was in disorder.
<br><br>
"So what if they were really other versions of ourselves? They have always existed with us in sync. Normally, we don't even notice them.
<br><br>
They mean nothing..."
<br><br>
"As long as they exist, it means something..." one insisted.
<br><br>
The dilemma also troubled the real Evil God.
<br><br>
He leaned against the wall listening to the avatars' arguments. He also became confused about the shadows.
<br><br>
"Eh?"
<br><br>
This time, the real Evil God felt the excitement from the heart of an avatar. An avatar who was squatting on a corner of the square suddenly burst into laughter, causing the other avatars to look at him puzzledly.
<br><br>
"What are you laughing at?"
<br><br>
"Spit it out. What's so funny?"
<br><br>
"Anything you might want to tell us? Just say it..."
<br><br>
The avatar sneered, "Those shadows have always been within our bodies and can only be seen when time sequence fluctuates. Do you know why?"
<br><br>
"Why?" another avatar asked in eager curiosity.
<br><br>
"Because you are all idiots," the avatar cursed and laughed some more.
<br><br>
The other avatars resisted their anger, gritting their teeth. "We are all the same. Are you cursing yourself?" one of them retorted.
<br><br>
They had all come from the same person, with the same character, emotion, and level of intelligence.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the real Evil God in the hall felt a little depressed. Why did the avatar curse so suddenly? The avatar stopped laughing and continued, "These shadows are so real.
<br><br>
We can see them when the time sequence is in disorder, but we can't see them when it is stable. This is because our cultivation of space and time is not enough. If only we had a good mastery of time and space, we could naturally distinguish them."
<br><br>
It sounded reasonable, but it was undoubtedly nonsense...
<br><br>
The Evil God's cultivation had reached a peak in the chaos now.
<br><br>
Not only did he unify the Godly Ways, but he also comprehended six truth-level theurgies. He even used the power of six truth-level theologies to create the more astonishing Six Truths Explosion.
<br><br>
Putting the Other Shore Tokens and the Eternal Realm bloodlines aside, the Evil God was truly unprecedented and could not be surpassed by anyone, even in the future.
<br><br>
"But the Ways-blending Energy we cultivated has reached its limit."
<br><br>
"Yes, it is a consensus..."
<br><br>
"There is no possibility of strengthening the space truth any further!"
<br><br>
the avatars said one after another.
<br><br>
The avatar who cursed smiled coldly. "The Bird Master named Duran told us that the chaos is the result of the downgrade of the main world. The energy of the chaos is also from the main world. Although we have never been to the Eternal Scroll Painting, the blood power obtained from it is no different from the energy of the Godly Ways," he said.
<br><br>
The avatars all kept silent but were somewhat enlightened by his words.
<br><br>
They were from the same person and their souls were eternally bound. In an instant, they looked at each other as they had understood what the avatar said.
<br><br>
"The bloodline power of the main world is clearly the same thing as the Ways-blending Energy!" the avatar who cursed exclaimed.
<br><br>
"But the two powers are much too different..." another avatar reminded him doubtfully.
<br><br>
In the battle in the Blood Sea Province, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer, who were Eternal Realm warriors, displayed their strongest power. This already exceeded Evil God's expectations. If it weren't for the fact that the Evil God could produce as many duplicates at will, it would be hard to say who would win.
<br><br>
"Of course there is a difference," the avatar who cursed agreed. "But suppose the two are the same thing, we can restore the Ways-blending Energy to see if we can get the bloodline power of the main world," he continued.
<br><br>
"Restore the Ways-blending Energy to the bloodline power..."
<br><br>
"This idea is too crazy!"
<br><br>
"It's impossible!" the avatars disagreed again.
<br><br>
"Idiots, how would you know if you don't try? No one has ever mastered the complete Ways-blending Energy before!" the avatar cursed once more.
<br><br>
"Good idea, but you have neglected one thing." The voice of the real Evil God echoed out in the hall. "The Bird Masters are from the main world, and they are born with its bloodline power. I have asked Shera to inquire about the shadows, and they have no idea why the shadows exist either."
<br><br>
"If we want to see them clearly, we need power stronger than that of the main world. Perhaps we can continue to restore it after we get the bloodline power of the main world..." the avatar suggested. "In the end, all the power will be restored into one kind of energy!"
<br><br>
"Wouldn't that still be the Ways-blending Energy?" one avatar interrupted, bringing laughter from all the other avatars.
<br><br>
However, the real Evil God was not amused. He had a chilling expression drawn on his face.
<br><br>
Duran had told him about the history of the Four Spirits Sect, and also mentioned a world at a higher level–the Deep Space. This was the same as the avatar deduced.
<br><br>
Restoring the Ways-blending Energy backward might be an option...
<br><br>
"You." The real Evil God pointed to the avatar. "Come into the hall," he ordered with a firm voice.
<br><br>
"What do you want me for?" the avatar asked in shock.
<br><br>
"I'll give you a reward."
<br><br>
Chapter 4189 Entering The Jade Pure Realm The third Shade Stone appeared less than a month after the second one had appeared.
<br><br>
The people in the Source World and the Pear Hill began to worry at this.
<br><br>
There was only one possibility they could think of why the Shade Stones were appearing so frequently: the end of the chaotic era was near.
<br><br>
But this round of chaotic era seemed to find itself in worse situations with every passing hour.
<br><br>
In the past, at the end of a chaotic era, only one primitive land like the Source World existed and only one civilization ruled this primitive land.
<br><br>
When the era ended, this ruling civilization would gather the power of the entire civilization to resist it.
<br><br>
This didn't mean that every era had a ruling civilization. It was also possible that there were anywhere between three and five superpowers that could also join hands to fight the coming of the end. In the face of the oncoming destruction of the chaos, all the past hatred between these superpowers was to no avail.
<br><br>
In this chaotic era, not only had there been no ruling civilization, even the various super forces had fallen into a state of disunity.
<br><br>
Even the Pear Hill, which usually attached the greatest importance to the Finale Way, had to worry about their own fate as they hid in Zen's primitive land.
<br><br>
At this point, no one had the time to think about the end of the chaos.
<br><br>
About twenty days later, the fourth Shade Stone appeared, and another grain of sand went missing from the hourglass.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, a bloody cocoon cracked open on the blood red sky of the primitive land, and Zen crawled out of it.
<br><br>
"Is this blood cocoon the last skill to strengthen my physical body?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"For the time being, it is," the ancestry-level bloodline replied.
<br><br>
"Then it's time to set out to do what I have to," Zen said, his jaw set in determination.
<br><br>
Zen's figure flashed before falling down like a meteor. It wasn't long before he landed on the jadeite platform of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had, during this time, descended onto the jadeite platform several times. He had some news to give Zen, but every time he had come, Zen had been cultivating in seclusion. So he hadn't usually stayed long and left quickly on discovering that Zen wasn't present.
<br><br>
Today, however, the Primeval Lord of Heaven got lucky with the chance to meet Zen, having waited here for a long time.
<br><br>
"The Grandmaster of Heaven has come to the Night View Island three times," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, going straight to the point.
<br><br>
"What did he come there for?" Zen said, feeling it strange that this had happened.
<br><br>
"The Bird Masters are anxious to let us ascend to the Jade Pure Realm."
<br><br>
The Jade Pure Realm had resumed its usual peaceful state as the war between the Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect had finally stopped for a period of time. But the Bird Masters were still in a constant state of panic, given that the Snake Spirit Sect was like a ferocious tiger waiting to pounce on them.
<br><br>
Zen thought about this for a while before saying, "Even if we go up to the Jade Pure Realm, we won't immediately attack the Snake Spirit Sect."
<br><br>
His goal had always been to reach the altar on the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled. "If we bring the Monkey Spirit Sect into the Jade Pure Realm, we can deter the Snake Spirit Sect. This will ease the pressure on the Bird Masters."
<br><br>
Zen looked at the primitive land that had grown bigger and said, "Then it's time for us to go."
<br><br>
At the north of the Supreme Pure Realm...
<br><br>
Thousands of gulls with beaks like those of cranes, were crawling up the sides of the mountains.
<br><br>
These gulls looked comical in their appearance, their big beaks looking like pickaxes. Their bodies weren't too big, but they were notorious among the Other Shore creatures in the Supreme Pure Realm. They were smart, cruel, and great in number. The prey they targeted always ended up facing a miserable death.
<br><br>
They had been here for several days and nights in order to capture the bone worms crossing the border.
<br><br>
And now, they suddenly felt the aura of living beings coming up the sides of the mountains.
<br><br>
The gull in the lead stretched out its head and looked around, only to see people emerging from a cave in the distance.
<br><br>
"Coo, coo..."
<br><br>
"Goo! Goo! Goo!"
<br><br>
The gulls began to discuss this development with each other.
<br><br>
According to what they remembered, human beings were weak and were excellent food, but the number was too small.
<br><br>
They had never been in a situation where dozens of human beings had appeared at one time, like they were appearing right now.
<br><br>
The gulls with the beaks of cranes always became excited before hunting, but had to calm down if they wanted to successfully catch their prey. As long as the humans continued to approach them, the gulls would swarm forward and the humans would become their food within seconds.
<br><br>
They had barely calmed down when suddenly, they felt a shadow sweep over their heads, as if a dark cloud had now enveloped them.
<br><br>
It never rained in the Supreme Pure Realm. What they were seeing was a giant foot.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The huge foot, along with the gulls and the mountains, disappeared, leaving only a large, deep footprint behind. The whole of the Supreme Pure Realm trembled. .
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King strode forward.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures retreated in fright at the sight of this enormous creature.
<br><br>
Even the hatred-level Treacherous Beings meant disaster for the Supreme Pure Realm. Just how powerful was an existence like the Monkey Spirit King? Once Zen and the human heroes had emerged from the cave, they climbed onto the back of the Wing King.
<br><br>
The Wing King flapped his wings and followed closely behind the Monkey Spirit King, like a green leaf floating in the air.
<br><br>
Once the Wing King entered the Night View Island, the Primeval Lord of Heaven also asked for a Blood-controlling Method for the Wing King. As a result, the Wing King's control over speed and space had increased greatly.
<br><br>
The Myriad Pagoda Mountains were not far from the cave.
<br><br>
About four hours later, the Monkey Spirit King stopped before the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.
<br><br>
"How to open the entrance to the Jade Pure Realm?" the Monkey Spirit King asked, directing the question to no one in particular.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters, including Manuel, were standing on the Monkey Spirit King's shoulders, directing him on how to open the entrance to the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
"Look at the third row from the left. Bring down the one hundred and twentieth pagoda mountain in this row."
<br><br>
"And then the pagoda mountain in the sixty-sixth row on the upper right..."
<br><br>
"The first row..."
<br><br>
The Myriad Pagoda Mountains were like a chessboard to the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
With Manuel's help, the Monkey Spirit King strolled among the pagoda mountains and pushed these marked mountains to the ground.
<br><br>
When the Monkey Spirit King had brought down about fourteen pagoda mountains, the ground began to shake, followed by the violent clicking sound of what seemed to be a mechanical device.
<br><br>
"Click, click, click, click..."
<br><br>
All the mechanical devices under the ground clicked into place, activating a magic array in the process. A blue circle of light suddenly appeared at the center of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, expanding quickly into a space channel.
<br><br>
"This is the passage to the Jade Pure Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, excitement thrumming through his voice.
<br><br>
The human heroes had, in the past, paid a huge price to find this passage, but had eventually failed.
<br><br>
"In fact, there are several passages leading to the Jade Pure Realm. All of them are in different directions. The passage that the Monkey Spirit King has opened is the largest one," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's only remnant soul had also followed them this time.
<br><br>
"I'll go in first. You guys follow me," the Monkey Spirit King said, turning around to face the rest.
<br><br>
He then leapt gently, the Monkey Masters on his shoulders, and was sucked into the passage the moment he touched it.
<br><br>
Once the Monkey Masters had entered the passage, the Wing King unfurled his wings and flew towards it.
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
The space channel was completely dark.
<br><br>
It was more like a motionless space than a passageway.
<br><br>
Everyone remained there, as if locked up in a dark world.
<br><br>
They waited for a few minutes before the dark world suddenly lit up and a new world appeared before them.
<br><br>
Chapter 4190 Caught Off Guard Every stage on the Other Shore exerted great pressure on those who entered. Most warriors would suffer serious discomfort when they reached a higher stage.
<br><br>
Even Zen felt the pressure quite vividly when he came to a new stage.
<br><br>
But after being in the stage for a long time, he would get used to the pressure and no longer felt it.
<br><br>
Zen had imagined the pressure here would be unbearable, considering it was the core area of the highest stage of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But when he arrived, he was surprised to find he did not feel anything.
<br><br>
What he saw before him was a vast, rolling grassland and a small lake in the distance. A breeze blew past and the water shimmered.
<br><br>
This didn't seem like the Other Shore but more like an ordinary world.
<br><br>
Soon though, Zen discovered that something was not quite right.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the real Fuxi and the others beside him all became stiff, as if someone had cast a spell on them. The Monkey Spirit King and the Monkey Masters not far away were dead still too.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven? Master Fuxi? What's going on?"
<br><br>
Zen's face was flushed with astonishment and concern.
<br><br>
It was impossible to freeze everyone, including the Monkey Masters and the Monkey Spirit King, by any sort of spatial means, no matter how powerful it was.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Just then, black cracks began splitting in the distance, extending towards Zen from afar, crawling along like numerous reptiles and swallowing everything in their way. The lake and the grassland disappeared rapidly, in a seemingly impossible engulfment of the environment.
<br><br>
"Be mindful, Zen. This is the Space Devouring Technique!" The voice of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord rang out in Zen's mind.
<br><br>
"The Space Devouring Technique has trapped them all?" asked Zen disbelieving.
<br><br>
"No, it's you who have been trapped," revealed the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. "What you see are all illusions, and the Space Devouring Technique will tear you and these illusions to pieces."
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The black cracks surged closer and closer and had soon spread to the human heroes.
<br><br>
It was just as the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had said; the Monkey Spirit King, the Monkey Masters and the human heroes were in fact not real. The ground beneath them was eroded to pieces by the black cracks and disappeared before Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
The others might have been illusions, but Zen himself was real.
<br><br>
Seeing what was coming for him, he realized he had no way to escape.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! When the first black crack reached him, he felt an intensely powerful tearing force pulling at his body.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Zen's body was much stronger now with the help of the ancestry-level bloodline. His body was as hard as rock in the face of the Space Devouring Technique, only the edge being slightly warped. The black crack then lost its power for moving on.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Then came more and more cracks.
<br><br>
Hundreds of them surrounded and tore at Zen.
<br><br>
"The Space Devouring Technique is not as terrifying as I imagined," Zen muttered.
<br><br>
This revelation rendered the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord speechless. The strengthening he had undergone was really quite extraordinary. "It's because your body is now too strong," he said.
<br><br>
The attack lasted a full five minutes before the cracks faded away and the surrounding space gradually grew brighter. However, what Zen saw before him had him astonished.
<br><br>
Not far off, Zhurong had turned into a human shaped flame. It was then divided into hundreds of pieces. When a large portion of it was extinguished, another was ignited. But Zen could feel that it was clearly weakened bit by bit.
<br><br>
The body of the real Snake Goddess had also completely disappeared, turning into a shadow being sliced constantly.
<br><br>
The real Fuxi, Gonggong, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others were all using their own methods to fight.
<br><br>
"Were they also hit by the Space Devouring Technique?" asked Zen.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord with a nod.
<br><br>
The strength of the human heroes differed.
<br><br>
After the Snake Goddess, Gonggong and Zhurong cultivated the Bloodcontrolling Method, they had activated their bloodlines and pushed them to the limit, turning them into entities of energy which allowed them to resist the black cracks. However, not all the bloodlines could turn into entities of energy.
<br><br>
On the other side, the body of the real Emperor Charm flickered with a blue light. He danced in the air like a feather, dodging the cracks.
<br><br>
But they were relentless and would not let him go. No matter how ingenious Emperor Charm's space theurgy was, eventually he was cornered and desperate.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Terrifying cracks crawled across his body and blood gushed out of them.
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm!"
<br><br>
Zen took a step forward and was at Emperor Charm's side in a flash.
<br><br>
Buzz! An emerald green life energy emerged from Zen's primitive land. This was the ability of the ancestry-level bloodline; regardless of the seriousness of the injury, it could be healed.
<br><br>
But when the life energy gushed out, it had brushed past Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
"How is this possible?" Zen was aghast.
<br><br>
"He is not here," answered the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Theoretically, once the Space Devouring Technique had covered this area, everyone was isolated.
<br><br>
"Then find him..."
<br><br>
Even though the Space Devouring Technique was very powerful, it was a theurgy of the fourth-grade world. It was impossible for it to leave the space-time quadrant of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Before he could finish his words, Emperor Charm appeared to have reached his limit and hundreds of cracks began appearing across his body all at once.
<br><br>
Puff! In the next instant, his body was torn to pieces, splashing blood in all directions.
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm!"
<br><br>
Zen cried out in anguish.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! More blood mists exploded nearby and more human heroes died.
<br><br>
The Space Devouring Technique had been activated unconsciously, quickly taking lives ruthlessly.
<br><br>
"Alas..."
<br><br>
the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord sighed in Zen's mind.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters on the other side were faring much better than the human heroes.
<br><br>
As Treacherous Beings, they were capable of withstanding this onslaught.
<br><br>
Although the Space Devouring Technique had cut them to pieces as well, they could be restored in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Monkey Spirit King stood motionless, his eyes focused dead ahead. No one knew what he was looking at.
<br><br>
A few moments later, the awful scene of misery finally came to an end.
<br><br>
Buzz! The shadow of Snake Goddess flickered, and the once blurry line slowly became clear, returning to her body.
<br><br>
She had pushed her bloodline power to the limit to deal with the Space Devouring Technique. Her face was now deadly pale, and when she saw the blood stains on the ground, any color left in her face drained as well.
<br><br>
Splash! Beside the Snake Goddess, a black and white Eight Diagrams disk rotated slowly. Fuxi's figure soon emerged from it. He was calm as he faced the Space Devouring Technique, but noticing the miserable state of the human heroes caused his face to darken.
<br><br>
Zhurong, Gonggong, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi then also recovered their forms.
<br><br>
Da! Da! The emerald green fragments scattered all over the ground close by began moving. They continued shuffling and gathering together, forming into the Wing King, but much smaller in size.
<br><br>
"Only a few survived..."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven stepped out from a snow-white light, his demeanor gloomy and heartbroken.
<br><br>
Chapter 4191 The Space Guiding Stone This time, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others in the chaos didn't join Zen in his journey to the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Including Zen himself, there were a total of forty humans.
<br><br>
The second they stepped into the Jade Pure Realm, thirty three of them died on the spot. Only seven remained.
<br><br>
Everyone was shocked, but they couldn't say they were surprised.
<br><br>
"Well... Is this one of the techniques of the Snake Spirit King?" the Snake Goddess asked sadly.
<br><br>
"Yes, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said it was called the Space Devouring Technique," Zen answered in a low voice.
<br><br>
Just then, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's soul floated out from Zen's head. "This is the theurgy of a Holy Item named the Space Guiding Stone," he explained. "The Snake Spirit King has been prepared."
<br><br>
"Has the Snake Spirit King been hiding here all the time?" Fuxi asked, whipping his head alertly.
<br><br>
The surrounding environment was as quiet as ever. No one could sense the auras of Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shook his head. "He doesn't even need to be here. With the Limited Omnipotent Stone, he monitors everything that goes on in the Jade Pure Realm, including our current conversation."
<br><br>
"Is the Limited Omnipotent Stone really so powerful?" Fuxi's eyes widened in disbelief.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord huffed, "I already mentioned this before we set out. You weren't listening carefully!"
<br><br>
He had found out about some of the Snake Spirit King's methods through Elder Xue. In addition, he had been lurking in the Jade Pure Realm for so many years, so it was only natural he learned about some of the Snake Spirit King's theurgies, but he didn't know them all.
<br><br>
"Before we had set out, I knew that this trip would be riddled with danger, but I didn't expect that we would have to suffer such heavy losses," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a pained expression.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was much calmer. "Since their souls are kept in the Civilization Artifact, they would be onlookers like me now."
<br><br>
If the chaos was truly destroyed, or even downgraded, all the creatures in the chaos would be killed. The humans here had lived for a long time, so it didn't really make any difference if they died sooner or later.
<br><br>
Despite that fact, everyone still wallowed in despair. Just then, Eastern Emperor Taiyi noticed something stirring in the distance. "What's going on over there?"
<br><br>
When everyone turned to look, they saw the Monkey Spirit King waiting for the other Treacherous Beings to recover. As Cornelius's former companion in battle, how could he not know about the Space Devouring Technique? Yet it didn't matter how powerful the Space Devouring Technique was, because it couldn't harm a Treacherous Being. Thus, the Monkey Spirit King only needed to wait patiently for the Monkey Masters to recover.
<br><br>
However, the Monkey Spirit King was looking straight at Zen with an unreadable expression. Then, he turned around abruptly and ran away, followed by the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
His huge body should have made the earth tremble when he ran.
<br><br>
However, Zen and the others didn't feel the vibration. There was no sound or aura fluctuation. If Eastern Emperor Taiyi hadn't accidentally seen it, Zen and the others wouldn't have noticed them running away.
<br><br>
"What happened? Why is the Monkey Spirit King running away?"
<br><br>
Gonggong asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Damn it, we have to catch up! Let's go!" the Snake Goddess cried in disbelief, poised to run after them.
<br><br>
It hadn't been easy, gaining the support of the Monkey Spirit Sect. They weren't going to let them go so easily.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Zen were already rushing towards the receding figure of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Although Fuxi and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had consumed a large amount of bloodline power resisting the Space Devouring Technique, they still managed to rush after the Monkey Spirit King with incredible speed. At the rate they were going, they should have caught up to him in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
However, even as they were dashing across the Jade Pure Realm, something strange happened.
<br><br>
The distance between them and the Monkey Spirit King did not close, but instead grew bigger and bigger, until the Monkey Spirit King had disappeared from their sight. Meanwhile, it looked like they were running in place.
<br><br>
"There is something strange about the space here..." Fuxi spoke, stretching out one hand.
<br><br>
Splash! Hundreds of black and white Eight Diagrams marks shot into the distance.
<br><br>
However, the Eight Diagrams marks stopped abruptly before they could get very far.
<br><br>
"It's the space wall! Break it!"
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! The black and white Eight Diagrams marks exploded along the surface of the invisible space wall.
<br><br>
The invisible wall didn't budge, even after Fuxi's vicious attack.
<br><br>
Buzz! Eastern Emperor Taiyi also joined in on the action.
<br><br>
As he gently pinched his fingers against each other, a sword suddenly materialized in his hand.
<br><br>
Raising his arms above his head, he slashed his blade downwards, slicing at the invisible wall.
<br><br>
The golden light streaked along the surface of the space wall, forming a golden river that was several hundred feet long.
<br><br>
If there was nothing in its way, the golden river would've reached thousands of miles away. One could only imagine how much power was contained within it.
<br><br>
However, no matter how powerful the golden river was, it stopped silently the moment it touched the space wall. It couldn't move in the slightest, as though the invisible wall were a dam that blocked it.
<br><br>
"How is this possible?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi's face fell.
<br><br>
"This is the Space Guiding Wall," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord explained calmly. "You, as well as your attacks, can only approach the space wall as much as you want, but you won't be able to touch it."
<br><br>
This didn't mean the space wall was unbreakable, but that there was a rule which prevented any attacks from reaching it.
<br><br>
"Is this also the ability of the Space Guiding Stone?" the Snake Goddess asked, frowning deeply.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord affirmed with a nod.
<br><br>
Previously, he had repeatedly emphasized the power of Holy Items.
<br><br>
However, the human heroes had mastered the Blood-controlling Method, and their strength had enhanced greatly, which boosted their confidence.
<br><br>
They were all under the impression that these so-called "Holy Items" were just stronger Other Shore Tokens and wouldn't be as strong as the bloodline power.
<br><br>
However, no one expected that upon arrival, most of them would drop dead.
<br><br>
Zen silently approached the invisible wall and reached out his finger.
<br><br>
As his finger approached the space wall, something strange happened. It should've touched the space wall, but he couldn't feel anything. Stranger still was the fact that half of his finger seemed to squeeze into the space then abruptly disappear.
<br><br>
When he withdrew his hand, it quickly returned to its original state.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid it's not going to be easy to break the space wall," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said as he watched Zen poke at the wall.
<br><br>
As he was speaking, Zen had already launched himself right into the space wall, crashing into it. Then, his body seemed to distort, as though he was being squeezed along the edge of the wall. However, he felt no pain, nor was he injured in any way.
<br><br>
"This distance is enough. Break the wall."
<br><br>
Zen's voice came from the edge of the wall.
<br><br>
This wall built by the Space Guiding Stone was indeed very ingenious.
<br><br>
Zen found that it had used most of the power in the space-time quadrant, but as the owner of the ancestry-level bloodline, he could still easily find a method to get around it.
<br><br>
Zen suddenly twisted his body like a snake, and at the same time, the invisible space wall began to twist like the rippling water.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Deafening sounds of glass being shattered rang, and the space wall twisted a few times before crumbling into countless pieces.
<br><br>
The invisible barrier had disappeared, but the scenery in the distance did not change at all. But since it had taken them some time, the Monkey Spirit King was long gone by now.
<br><br>
Chapter 4192 Disappearing The Jade Pure Realm was still peaceful, even though everyone was depressed.
<br><br>
Most of them were dead, and their biggest supporter, the Monkey Spirit King, had escaped.
<br><br>
What on earth was going on? "What should we do now? I'm afraid we can't stand our ground against the Snake Spirit Sect without the help of the Monkey Spirit Sect," Gonggong said.
<br><br>
"Should we leave the Jade Pure Realm first?" Zhurong asked.
<br><br>
Some of them had thought of giving up.
<br><br>
It was not their fault. The support of the Monkey Spirit Sect was a prerequisite if they wanted to take this action. Without it, there wouldn't be any plan. It would be best for them to retreat first and then take a decision.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, "The exit of this passage is on the other side of the Jade Pure Realm. Now that the Snake Spirit King is exclusively targeting us, I don't think he will let us go."
<br><br>
"Then we can't retreat," said the real Fuxi, looking straight ahead.
<br><br>
"I don't know what the Monkey Spirit King saw and why he had to run away. But he is huge, and we can find him by following the traces that he has left." The Snake Goddess had calmed down enough to think straight and find a solution.
<br><br>
"The Monkey Spirit King is extraordinary but also very reckless. It looks like the Snake Spirit King will kill him soon enough." Eastern Emperor Taiyi sighed helplessly.
<br><br>
"Let's start looking for him," Zen said.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
The Wing King flapped his wings as he remained beside Zen.
<br><br>
The seven people, including Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the Snake Goddess, climbed on to the Wing King's back. With a flash of his wings, he turned into a cyan shadow and shot into the air.
<br><br>
Hundreds of miles into their journey, they found a number of low mountains and rivers. There were also a few Other Shore creatures that had been born there and that still lived there, but they were very docile.
<br><br>
They didn't have the slightest intention of attacking Zen and his companions when they spotted them making their way through the air.
<br><br>
If the Other Shore Realm warriors were to be sent here, none of them would believe that this was the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
"There are footprints!"
<br><br>
"These are the Monkey Spirit King's footprints!"
<br><br>
"Follow the footprints!"
<br><br>
There were huge footprints on the ground. Only a huge creature like the Monkey Spirit King could leave such giant footprints. So the Wing King followed this footprint trail.
<br><br>
The Wing King was so fast that he had covered five hundred miles before long.
<br><br>
There were lots of footprints along the way, but the Monkey Spirit King was nowhere to be seen.
<br><br>
The scenery began to change the moment they reached a distance of about eight hundred miles.
<br><br>
The green color was gradually replaced by a grey white and a large area of grey stones were exposed on the ground.
<br><br>
There were still footprints that were clear enough to attract their attention.
<br><br>
"The footprints are still here. We are probably headed in the right direction," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, confused.
<br><br>
"How is the Monkey Spirit King running so fast?" The Snake Goddess frowned. She had a premonition that something was terribly wrong.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, "The Space Guiding Stone can create a lot of illusions. It could have deceived the Monkey Spirit King, and it could probably also have made these footprints to deceive us."
<br><br>
"Let's go and have a look!" Zen said to the Wing King.
<br><br>
The Wing King understood what Zen meant. He flew forward and came to a stop beside a huge footprint.
<br><br>
Zen walked up to the edge of the footprint that was as huge as a lake.
<br><br>
He put his hand into the pit from the edge where he was standing, then closed his eyes and began to analyze the energy structure within the pit.
<br><br>
He did not sense an aura belonging to any Treacherous Being. What he did find was a trace of remnant space power.
<br><br>
He suddenly opened his eyes and said in all seriousness, "I'm afraid these footprints have been created by the space theurgy, not the Monkey Spirit King."
<br><br>
"Someone has deliberately led us to the wrong path!" the Snake Goddess exclaimed.
<br><br>
"Well, it does look like the Snake Spirit King is playing tricks on us, doesn't it?" Fuxi said, looking warily around.
<br><br>
Nervousness rippled through everyone present.
<br><br>
All sorts of methods had been used to target them ever since they had stepped into the Jade Pure Realm. This was bad news.
<br><br>
"Zen, come back here. We need to leave," said the Wing King.
<br><br>
Once Zen jumped onto the back of the Wing King, the Wing King dived and flew to the other side in a huge arc.
<br><br>
Now that Zen had seen through the origin of these footprints, the Wing King was naturally backtracking to avoid any danger.
<br><br>
But they had barely traveled a few dozen miles when the sight of another huge footprint caused everyone's faces to darken.
<br><br>
"Someone is doing this on purpose!" the Snake Goddess said through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
"I agree. It does look like someone is trying to make a fool of us!"
<br><br>
Zhurong said. He was so furious that his eyes had reddened with rage.
<br><br>
The Wing King's wings trembled and he changed direction. But yet again, they had barely flown ten miles in the new direction when another huge footprint made an appearance.
<br><br>
"Ignore these footprints. Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, please lead the way. Let's move towards the center of the Jade Pure Realm," Zen said suddenly but sternly.
<br><br>
The footprints shouldn't have been used as reference objects. Their persistence in avoiding the footprints had played a huge role in their getting lost.
<br><br>
"Aren't you going to find the Monkey Spirit King?" asked the Wing King.
<br><br>
"There is no way to find him. So that's the only thing we can do at the moment," Zen replied.
<br><br>
The Wing King didn't change direction and continued to fly onwards. He ignored the footprints, irrespective of how many of them continued to appear.
<br><br>
In the Heavenly Square City Two stones appeared above the Snake Spirit King's head.
<br><br>
One was an amber, diamond-shaped gem. This was the Limited Omnipotent Stone.
<br><br>
The other was a light blue triangular gem, and this was the Space Guiding Stone, also one of the Holy Items.
<br><br>
Through the Limited Omnipotent Stone, the Snake Spirit King could see everything in the Jade Pure Realm, right from tiny particles of sand to the Monkey Spirit King who was running crazily in all directions. He could tap into any secrets and all details.
<br><br>
The Space Guiding Stone could change the space of any area at will.
<br><br>
It could easily create a large space sink, forming a huge footprint.
<br><br>
To the Snake Spirit King, the scene was like a cat playing with a mouse.
<br><br>
The previous Space Devouring Technique had also been released by the Snake Spirit King. He didn't need weak opponents, and it was obvious that the weaker ones would be eliminated.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
Every time the Space Guiding Stone flashed, a footprint would appear in front of Zen and his group. But they ignored them and continued to move in the established direction.
<br><br>
"Are you no longer affected by the footprints? It's not interesting anymore, so I will go ahead and kill a few more!"
<br><br>
The blue light on the Space Guiding Stone began to flicker violently. A number of large blue space awls formed out of nowhere and shot towards the Wing King.
<br><br>
According to the Snake Spirit King, he would torture this group of people and in the end, only one of them could survive.
<br><br>
Swish, swish, swish...
<br><br>
The space awls were too powerful for ordinary Eternal Realm warriors to face and deal with.
<br><br>
The Wing King, feeling the power of the space awls, began to rapidly wave his wings and flew forward at an incredible speed. But he was still unable to escape the scope of the space awls.
<br><br>
Puff, puff, puff...
<br><br>
The space awls smashed everything that they enveloped.
<br><br>
After all the space awls had shot out to hit everything, the Snake Spirit King consulted the Limited Omnipotent Stone again. What he saw there left him stunned.
<br><br>
Zen and his group had disappeared in the Limited Omnipotent Stone.
<br><br>
Chapter 4193 Deception The Snake Spirit Sect had the ten Holy Items to thank for their success in dissolving the other three sects in the chaos.
<br><br>
Each Holy Item, after all, accorded exceptional power.
<br><br>
The Evil Bead was far stronger than any Other Shore Tokens. The Space Guiding Stone could control space at will.
<br><br>
The Limited Omnipotent Stone was even more powerful than the two others.
<br><br>
With it, the wearer could see and know everything within a closed area.
<br><br>
The Limited Omnipotent Stone was useless in the main world, but it could be used in the chaos and on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Only a few things could avoid the detection of the Limited Omnipotent Stone. The bubble was one of them.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit Sect had already destroyed the bubble of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. It would never reappear in the Jade Pure Realm again.
<br><br>
Even if the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord tried to reactivate the bubble, the Snake Spirit King would now be able to detect it. The Limited Omnipotent Stone would allow him to see all, including the process of reactivating the bubble. That was why Dale could not shake off the Snake Spirit King, who had been able to track his return to the bubble last time.
<br><br>
Presently, however, the Snake Spirit King was chafing at the disappearance of Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
He was able to be an observer before, but he realized now that was no longer the case.
<br><br>
He cursed under his breath.
<br><br>
Crack! Clang! Boom! The Snake Spirit King unleashed the Space Guiding Stone's power again.
<br><br>
The ground sank where Zen and the others disappeared. The effect began to spread as the space in the area was squeezed.
<br><br>
Stones turned into fine powder, then condensed into balls. They shrank until their properties were altered completely.
<br><br>
Creatures living underground were mangled and crushed, ground into fine powder before they even knew what was happening.
<br><br>
Cracks began to appear on the ground like a spider web, extending in all directions.
<br><br>
Ten miles, a hundred miles, a thousand miles.
<br><br>
Soon enough, everything within a thousand miles had collapsed, replaced by only a huge pit.
<br><br>
A wise lizard at the edge of the pit had witnessed the entire thing. He stared in disbelief at the sudden crater in front of him.
<br><br>
He was from a mighty race in the Jade Pure Realm on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
His race had survived all this time by gaining a foothold in the Jade Pure Realm despite the Treacherous Beings that overran it.
<br><br>
His blood ran cold as it dawned on him that their home had been violently decimated just now. Everything had been destroyed in a flash.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The lizard scrambled into the pit at an extremely fast speed. All that was left there was some kind of colorful powder. He could detect no auras anywhere.
<br><br>
The terrifying pressure had wiped out everything. It seemed even the patriarch, the eight strong warriors who could fight off resentment-level Treacherous Beings, and the prophets had all been killed.
<br><br>
No one else had survived.
<br><br>
The lizard started screaming in despair.
<br><br>
Suddenly, several people materialized in front of him, glowing from the silver powder coating their bodies.
<br><br>
The lizard fell silent, numb with shock. 'Who are these people? Where did they come from?' the lizard thought to himself, utterly bewildered.
<br><br>
The man at the lead of the group walked toward him. The man had a smile on his face, but the lizard couldn't help but take a few steps back in apprehension.
<br><br>
"Can you see me now?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"What are you talking about?" the lizard, who knew the human language, sputtered out.
<br><br>
"Mysteries are more interesting, so we think it best to disappear," Zen simply continued.
<br><br>
"What?" The lizard was absolutely confused.
<br><br>
Zen bent forward and waved right in front of the lizard's eyes. As he did, he and the others slowly disappeared from the flabbergasted lizard's sight.
<br><br>
And so too, from the Snake Spirit King's spying. The Limited Omnipotent Stone had been allowing him to see everything just now through the lizard's eyes.
<br><br>
Zen had actually been speaking to the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
If the Snake Spirit King was irritated before, now he was consumed with pure wrath.
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! The Heavenly Square City began to shake.
<br><br>
Sewell rushed to the Snake Spirit King's side.
<br><br>
"My king, what happened?" Sewell asked.
<br><br>
"Those people have escaped," the Snake Spirit King snarled.
<br><br>
Sewell looked confused. "I thought letting them escape was part of your plan?"
<br><br>
"They escaped right under my nose and out of sight of the Limited Omnipotent Stone!" the Snake Spirit King snapped.
<br><br>
Sewell drew a sharp intake of breath and stiffened. He understood immediately, being the Snake Spirit King's capable assistant. But how could they have evaded the Limited Omnipotent Stone? What kind of abilities did they have? "Find them! Now!" the Snake Spirit King roared.
<br><br>
Sewell promptly slithered away and into action.
<br><br>
It didn't take long before over a hundred Snake Masters and thousands of snake-shaped Treacherous Beings were deployed from the Heavenly Square City.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen and his group remained on the move toward the west.
<br><br>
The Wing King had offered to simply fly them toward their destination, but Zen had declined.
<br><br>
"The Space Deception Method can counter the power of the Limited Omnipotent Stone, but it is very unstable. We have to avoid using other powers of space," Zen explained.
<br><br>
A certain level of stability had to be maintained, or else they would be exposed to the Snake Spirit King again.
<br><br>
"After I cultivated the Blood-controlling Method, I thought my understanding of space had risen to an unreachable level. But I see it's still nothing compared to yours," the Wing King sighed.
<br><br>
The Limited Omnipotent Stone and the Space Deception Method were theurgies that the Wing King couldn't understand.
<br><br>
"We are fighting against an almost invincible opponent. If we can't even get rid of his monitoring, then we won't stand a chance," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord pointed out.
<br><br>
"But you've planned for such a long time and finally have Zen. We're already ahead on that alone," said Fuxi with a smile, optimistic as ever.
<br><br>
Right now, they could only walk to where they needed to go, so progress was slow.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Space Deception Method was impervious not only to the powers of the Limited Omnipotent Stone, but also to all sorts of creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The group soon came across a large race as they passed through a gray area covered in stones.
<br><br>
The creatures of the race wore masks and carried huge bone weapons.
<br><br>
They looked strong. Such creatures should not be underestimated in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Zen and the others started walking across their territory unseen. Although the creatures could sense strange auras, they couldn't determine where they were coming from. They eventually just shrugged the feeling off.
<br><br>
Fuxi had even accidentally bumped into one of the creatures and made him stagger. But seeing nothing there, the creature simply waved it off as nothing. Soon, Zen and his group had passed through without incident.
<br><br>
Chapter 4194 The Space Channel Thump! Thump! Thump! The Monkey Spirit King's speed never let up as he gave chase to Sewell on the northwest side of the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King could move at a surprising speed with the gargantuan size.
<br><br>
Sewell was just right ahead, with the human heroes pierced on his back.
<br><br>
Some had seen the Monkey Spirit King coming to save them and were already reaching out to him.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King remained loyal to those he trusted.
<br><br>
These human beings had saved him. He definitely wouldn't allow the Snake Masters to capture them. Not on his watch! Dong! Dong! Dong! The Monkey Spirit King's footsteps were so heavy, and the surroundings vibrated visibly every time his feet landed on the ground.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures in his path grew pale upon seeing him approach. They quickly got well out of the way. They wondered where this terrifying Treacherous Being came from. They had never heard of such a Treacherous Being before.
<br><br>
"My king, just leap forward and get as close as you can. I'll do the rest,"
<br><br>
Manuel, standing on the Monkey Spirit King's shoulder, uttered.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King had been chasing Sewell for a while now, to no avail. He was starting to feel frustrated. He could have easily killed Sewell before with just one hand. He could have even beaten Cornelius in a fight.
<br><br>
He took a few steps and leapt forward. This jump drew an arc reaching hundreds of thousands of feet high.
<br><br>
Manuel launched himself onward while the Monkey Spirit King was in the air. Boosted by the Monkey Spirit King's speed, Manuel now flew toward Sewell like an arrow.
<br><br>
Manuel still bore a grudge against Sewell for breaking into the Night View Island and trying to steal away the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
There had been a huge gap between their strengths in the past. Manuel had been staying in the Night View Island for so many years and knew nothing about the outside, so Sewell easily tricked him. Manuel was raring for some payback.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A bone stick appeared in Manuel's hand. He spun it like a windmill and swung it at Sewell.
<br><br>
But Sewell suddenly picked up speed, to Manuel's surprise. Just moments later, Sewell was out of his reach again.
<br><br>
How was this possible? Sewell should have reached his limit by now, having been chased for so long. How could he not be exhausted? Had he been just baiting them all this time? Perhaps he had other intentions? No matter what it was, Manuel wasn't going to give up that easily.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Buzz! The bone stick in his hand began to glow.
<br><br>
Swish! Something strange happened before the weapon could smash down on Sewell.
<br><br>
The weapon was infinitely compressed! "A space wall?" Surprise flashed in Manuel's eyes. Then he smirked.
<br><br>
This cross-shaped bone stick was considered a supreme treasure in the Human Spirit Sect. It was made from the thigh bones of the Space Ghost after it had been killed in the main world.
<br><br>
Orlando had asked Kincaid for it and had eventually given it to Manuel.
<br><br>
The cross-shaped bone stick was used to draw energy from the holy pillar of the Monkey Spirit Sect when Manuel used it, but even without that connection between the stick and the holy pillar now, it still had the talent of the Space Ghost. It could shatter all space! Crack! The compressed cross-shaped bone stick spun and broke through the space wall.
<br><br>
Manuel's smirk grew wider. As he moved to retrieve the bone stick and continue chasing Sewell, he looked up ahead and froze.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! Dong! The Monkey Spirit King ran over from behind. He picked Manuel up and raised him up on his palm. "Why are you stopping? Let's go!"
<br><br>
"They're gone," Manuel said. He pointed ahead.
<br><br>
"What?" The Monkey Spirit King stopped in his tracks.
<br><br>
Sewell and the human heroes on his back disappeared from view as soon as the space wall was broken.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid it was all just an illusion created by the space," Hagar lamented.
<br><br>
"No wonder our king couldn't catch up with him no matter how fast he got!" Nereus shook his head.
<br><br>
They had been tricked by an illusion all this time! The Monkey Spirit King stamped his feet in frustration.
<br><br>
Boom! "Cornelius! Come out!"
<br><br>
The impact his feet made exerted such immense force on the ground, and a large number of cracks appeared.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was alert and sensitive most of the time, but when he was angry, he just wanted to tear Cornelius into pieces.
<br><br>
Manuel and Tearrag couldn't even dare try to appease him now. They just stood on his shoulder in silence.
<br><br>
The power of space suddenly began to gather in front of the Monkey Spirit King. The soil and stones on the ground were lifted in the air bit by bit by the space force until they formed a huge snake shape. The Snake Spirit King's voice suddenly rang out. "How much do you hate me, Orlando?"
<br><br>
"I'm going to tear you apart," the Monkey Spirit King snarled.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King sighed and took on an earnest tone. "Your Monkey Spirit Sect will also benefit if my plan succeeds, you know. I will help you develop the Monkey Spirit Sect, making it prosperous and powerful again..."
<br><br>
Boom! The Monkey Spirit King threw a heavy punch.
<br><br>
It smashed through the huge snake formed by the soil and stones. The impact created a deep crater on the ground.
<br><br>
"You can't fool me twice," the Monkey Spirit King spat out.
<br><br>
With a sinister sound, the stones and soil rose up in the air again and turned into the shape of the Snake Spirit King. "Come to the Heavenly Square City, if you want to beat me so badly..."
<br><br>
As he said this, the space power formed a huge whirlpool emitting a blue light. It was a space channel.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King looked at the space channel, severely tempted by it.
<br><br>
"My king, be careful. This may be another trick," Manuel cautioned urgently, trying to stop him.
<br><br>
The other Monkey Masters, such as Tearrag, Hagar and Nereus, likewise glared at the channel with suspicion.
<br><br>
Cornelius had caused so much trouble to the Monkey Spirit Sect, so they were convinced this space channel was nothing but a trap.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King hesitated.
<br><br>
He was confident in his unparalleled strength, but he knew he was far inferior to Cornelius in intelligence. That was why he had chosen to cooperate with Zen and the other human beings. He just hadn't expected that the Snake Spirit King would be able to separate them upon their arrival at the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King chose to be clear-headed and rational this time.
<br><br>
He refused to step into the channel.
<br><br>
However, visions suddenly appeared at the center of the space channel.
<br><br>
They were the images of the monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City not so long ago.
<br><br>
"It's Alston!"
<br><br>
"Alston is still alive?"
<br><br>
"Why are there so many monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City?"
<br><br>
The strength of Alston was a bit inferior to that of Hagar, and he was once ranked fourth in the Monkey Spirit Sect. He was a good friend to Manuel and Tearrag.
<br><br>
But the next vision showed that the monkey spirits were executed, and that their coordinates were destroyed along with them.
<br><br>
"NO!" Manuel roared.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King rushed toward the space channel without any hesitation at this moment.
<br><br>
Chapter 4195 The Altar Entering the space channel was risky since nobody knew where it led to.
<br><br>
Creatures from other races would have known that it was a trap and calmed down almost immediately.
<br><br>
But the members of the Monkey Spirit Sect were impulsive.
<br><br>
Manuel, Hagar, and the other Monkey Masters let anger get the best of them. They were determined to tear the Snake Masters into bits along with the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
The space channel was small and would only take one a few several steps to get through it. But the Monkey Spirit King had barely entered it when he felt like countless bugs were biting his skin.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was a powerful Treacherous Being. Few things could hurt his body.
<br><br>
He looked around, confused, but his face darkened as he realized what it was. "It's the Void Dust!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
The space channel led to the outside of the main Pure Sky Platform. They realized that they were now in great danger.
<br><br>
The sickening sizzle of burning flesh sounded through the channel.
<br><br>
The Void Dust was eroding the Monkey Spirit King, Manuel, Tearrag, and Hagar.
<br><br>
They were now a hundred miles from the main Pure Sky Platform, making it impossible for them to fly back.
<br><br>
"Tearrag!" the Monkey Spirit King called out.
<br><br>
Tearrag understood what the Monkey Spiritual King was trying to say. He was better at space theurgy than the others. So he opened his hands and two blue holes appeared in his palms. These holes that he had created were also space channels, but they were different from other space channels.
<br><br>
The space channels had been inside Tearrag's body for a long time. They were stable and could be summoned at any time. .
<br><br>
Tearrag stretched out a hand, causing a blue hole to expand and transform into a huge space channel.
<br><br>
He then turned around and stretched out his hand once again. The other hole appeared above the main Pure Sky Platform a hundred miles away from them.
<br><br>
"My king! Let's go inside!" Tearrage said.
<br><br>
But by then, half of his head had disappeared, having been eroded by the Void Dust.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King endured the sharp pain as he dashed towards the hole alongside the Monkey Masters. But the closer he got to it, the farther backwards the hole moved from him.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King stared at Tearrag and said, "What's this?"
<br><br>
Tearrag could not speak, for half his head was gone.
<br><br>
Out of options, he replied through his consciousness, "I lost control over the holes."
<br><br>
"How can this be?" the Monkey Spirit King said, but he didn't give up.
<br><br>
He moved forward, but the hole retreated again, as if it was playing a game with him.
<br><br>
"Cornelius, it is you!"
<br><br>
the Monkey Spirit King roared.
<br><br>
But even his voice could not reach where he wanted it to.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King had filled the space channel with the Void Dust that eroded even sound waves.
<br><br>
The flesh continued to burn and sizzle.
<br><br>
The Void Dust devoured Manuel, Tearrag, and Hagar. The Monkey Spirit King was the last to dissipate in the Void Dust.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King, who was in the Heavenly Square City, smiled.
<br><br>
"Orlando, I can't believe you are still that stupid!" he said.
<br><br>
When he had taken out the space channel a moment ago, he hadn't expected the Monkey Spirit King to enter it. He had done that just to provoke the Monkey Spirit King. But since the Monkey Spirit King had voluntarily entered it, he thought there was no need to show him any mercy.
<br><br>
"Did the Monkey Spirit King really fall into the trap?" Sewell asked.
<br><br>
"He has already been devoured by the Void Dust," the Snake Spirit King replied.
<br><br>
"Do you know where their coordinates are?" Sewell asked again.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King shook his head. "One thing is for sure. Their coordinates are not in the Jade Pure Realm," he said.
<br><br>
'The coordinates usually produce energy fluctuations and one should perceive these fluctuations with the help of the Limited Omnipotent Stone.
<br><br>
But the Snake Spirit King isn't able to detect them, which means that their coordinates are not in the Jade Pure Realm. I guess they are in the Night View Island, ' Sewell pondered.
<br><br>
"I think their coordinates are in the Night View Island," Sewell said out loud.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King shook his head as he said, "What if they are in the hands of those humans?"
<br><br>
"The humans..."
<br><br>
It was bad news that Zen and his group had suddenly disappeared. What was worse, the Snake Spirit King didn't know how they had vanished into thin air, without any trace.
<br><br>
If they were capable of avoiding the Limited Omnipotent Stone, then even the Snake Spirit King couldn't locate the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates.
<br><br>
All the Snake Spirit King's efforts to take out the Monkey Spirit King would be in vain.
<br><br>
"Keep looking for them," the Snake Spirit King ordered.
<br><br>
He was filled with regret from within.
<br><br>
'If I had seen this coming, I would have broken into the Night View Island.
<br><br>
That would have been better than this, even though it might make it difficult to open the door, ' the Snake Spirit King mused.
<br><br>
Once Sewell took his leave, the black light reappeared before the Snake Spirit King. "You can't even handle the creatures in the chaos. You are such a disappointment!" the black light berated the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"Was there a flaw in my actions?" the Snake Spirit King asked.
<br><br>
The black light paused and replied, "No."
<br><br>
"Don't underestimate them! Now that we want to use them, we will need to foresee any future risks," the Snake Spirit King said.
<br><br>
The Jade Pure Realm was much bigger than the Supreme Pure Realm and the Grand Pure Realm. Its terrain was much more complicated.
<br><br>
Once Zen and the others had passed through the Other Shore race, they crossed several stone mountains. And then, a quagmire came into their view.
<br><br>
This quagmire was five thousand miles wide and was called the Quagmire of Ignorance.
<br><br>
"We are going that way."
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord led Zen and his companions to run across the quagmire.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A number of fish with spidery legs emerged from the quagmire. Being unable to perceive the presence of Zen and his companions, they ran into them.
<br><br>
Zen and his companions effectively dodged these creatures, but Fuxi trampled them into a pulp.
<br><br>
"Fuxi, be careful!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven advised him.
<br><br>
"What's wrong? Are you afraid of alerting the Snake Spirit King?" Fuxi cast an angry stare towards the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"I think it would be better for us to be careful," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
"If we kill too many creatures on the Other Shore, it might alert the Snake Spirit King to our presence."
<br><br>
Fuxi realized that what the Snake Goddess said made sense. He became more careful and tried to avoid the creatures on their way.
<br><br>
They had traveled for about two thousand miles above the Quagmire of Ignorance before they were attacked by the winged, poisonous insects.
<br><br>
The insects seemed to have an extraordinary sensibility because even though the Space Deception Method had caused the group to become invisible, the insects had still detected them.
<br><br>
The horde of winged poisonous insects were fast, closely following the group. The moment Zhurong noticed that they were getting closer, he used the fire lotus and burned them to ashes.
<br><br>
Half a day's journey later, they finally crossed the Quagmire of Ignorance.
<br><br>
They then spotted three towering mountains, an altar standing among them.
<br><br>
It was just a three-storied altar, but it was only slightly shorter than the mountains that surrounded it.
<br><br>
"Is that the altar we are looking for?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded in confirmation. His eyes were excited, but also held a hint of sadness.
<br><br>
'It has been years since I left this place and it's only now that I am finally going to uncover its secret. There is just a soul left in me, but I am still glad, ' the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord thought, thrilled to return.
<br><br>
Chapter 4196 The Door Opened This altar was huge and exquisite-looking.
<br><br>
The outermost circle was paved with a layer of white jade. It was so white and pale that it looked like it was swimming in a layer of milk.
<br><br>
The outer wall was inlaid with a layer of cyan gray stone bricks, the surfaces of which were engraved with multiple Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had deciphered many of these Sanskrit words that recorded the glorious deeds of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
On getting close to the wall, Zen activated the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization and tried to decipher a few Sanskrit words. The information he learned was on the lines of what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had told him. It mainly pertained to the origin of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
This altar had originally been built by Campbell and his fellows, so the fact that the Sanskrit words were here wasn't completely out of the ordinary.
<br><br>
They walked along the length of the altar for a distance before they spotted a staircase that led to the top floor.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord turned to look at the altar a few times, a strange expression on his face. "As far as I know, the Snake Spirit King attaches great importance to this place. He usually sends Treacherous Beings to guard it. But why is there no Treacherous Being guarding the altar today?"
<br><br>
Zen looked around but shrugged and shook his head. "I don't know. Let's go up there first."
<br><br>
Zen led the way as the group made their way up the stairs.
<br><br>
The huge altar itself wasn't anything magical. It only had a thousand stairs, and Zen and his companions could climb these in a matter of seconds.
<br><br>
A smooth plane sat at the top of the altar, at the center of which was a square opening. Beside this were steps that extended into the altar.
<br><br>
"Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, I'm confused," said Zen.
<br><br>
"What is it?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord asked.
<br><br>
"Does the Snake Spirit King want something in the altar?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord thought for a moment before nodding and saying, "I think he is eager to enter the altar."
<br><br>
According to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, it was very likely that Kincaid was locked in the altar.
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit King, in the Four Spirits Sect, was kind enough to remain neutral. The Monkey Spirit King was powerful, but he was reckless. Only Kincaid and the human spirits were the strongest opponents of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"In that case, why doesn't he break the altar?" Zen asked, confused.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shook his head. "I don't know," he said.
<br><br>
"I think there are a few possibilities," said the Snake Goddess. "One, this altar is special, and the Snake Spirit King can't open it. Two, it might need a unique way to open it, and using brute force will cause loss. Three, it could also be that there is something in the altar that the Snake Spirit King is afraid of, which is why he doesn't dare release whatever's in the altar."
<br><br>
"I don't think your third point is right. After all, the Snake Spirit King has defeated the other three sects. Could anything in the entire chaos scare him?" Gonggong, who was silent all this time, suddenly bit out a retort.
<br><br>
Zen was thoughtful as he responded, "That's not necessarily true. This war is no longer related only to the Four Spirits Sect. Beings of the higher level have now gotten involved. Perhaps someone can restrain the Snake Spirit King..."
<br><br>
"Whatever it is, we'll know when we open the altar," said Zhurong.
<br><br>
Zen made to walk down the steps that led into the altar.
<br><br>
The moment he set foot on the steps, he felt the viscosity of the space below him, as if a strange power of space held rein within this square opening.
<br><br>
He was confused, but decided not to take it seriously.
<br><br>
But in the Heavenly Square City that was tens of thousands of miles away from here, the Space Guiding Stone of the Snake Spirit King began to flash.
<br><br>
"How have they reached the altar so fast?" the Snake Spirit King said, agitated.
<br><br>
He had thought that Zen and his group would try to hide from him for a while. He hadn't expected them to go straight to the altar.
<br><br>
He had originally intended to remove all other obstacles before expecting Zen to open the altar alone. His goal hadn't been fully achieved, but at least Zen would open the door of the altar himself.
<br><br>
Boom...
<br><br>
A huge crack sounded from above the Heavenly Square City, blooming through the sky before the city once again shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
"Gather all the Snake Masters and follow me to the altar." The Snake Spirit King's voice echoed through the space.
<br><br>
The Snake Masters and the Treacherous Beings that had been sent out began to gather at the altar, while the Snake Spirit King personally led the elites of the Heavenly Square City towards it.
<br><br>
There were more than a thousand steps inside the square opening.
<br><br>
Zen walked down, feeling the space to be more viscous than he had expected it to be.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess noticed Zen's hesitation and asked, "What's wrong?"
<br><br>
Instead of answering, Zen stopped and closed his eyes, lost in thought. A few minutes later, he opened his eyes again, now wary. "There is a layer of space enchanted barrier here, a very thin one..."
<br><br>
"Where is it?"
<br><br>
"Why can't I feel it?"
<br><br>
"I don't feel it as well!"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were confused.
<br><br>
"I feel it! Just a little though," said the Wing King.
<br><br>
The Wing King's bloodline talent was related to space, which meant that he was more sensitive to space.
<br><br>
"This space enchanted barrier is similar to the aura of the Space Guiding Stone," said Zen.
<br><br>
"Has it been set up by the Snake Spirit King?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"I think so," Zen said, nodding.
<br><br>
"That's going to be a problem," Zhurong said, his eyes widening.
<br><br>
"Let's stay outside to keep an eye on things here and let Zen get inside,"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven said decidedly.
<br><br>
Having come this far, they were now ready to sacrifice themselves.
<br><br>
Everyone were to stay outside, while Zen continued to walk down the stairs.
<br><br>
When he reached the bottom of the stairs, a stone door appeared before him.
<br><br>
It was simple and crude, as if made of a stone that was cut out by an axe at random, its surface covered in marks.
<br><br>
At the center of the stone door was a circular metal disk, in the middle of which was a small key hole.
<br><br>
"This is the door of the altar," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
"This door seems very simple, as if it can be opened with just a push!"
<br><br>
Zen smiled.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, "Your strength is far greater than mine, but I don't think you can open this door."
<br><br>
Back in the day, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had also reached the door and tried all sorts of methods to open the door. He had failed.
<br><br>
Zen would obviously not use brute force to open the door. He lifted his wrist gently, causing the Sumeru Space to begin to unfold. A bronze key appeared suddenly.
<br><br>
He grabbed the key and inserted it into the metal disk.
<br><br>
Crack! A voice sounded from the stone door.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
The door was then pushed inward, a gust of cold wind blowing out and a layer of white frost instantly enveloping Zen.
<br><br>
Zen was fine. The blood vitality in his body moved around from within, the white frost having disappeared. He looked inside to find a snakeshaped road made of ice, and countless white light dots floating on both sides of this road.
<br><br>
"A huge Cold Prison!" Zen muttered, awed at this sight.
<br><br>
Zen had seen a lot of Cold Prisons in the upper field of the Blooming Jade Stage. But they had been tiny compared to this one.
<br><br>
The Cold Prison before him was different. Apart from the ice path in the middle, everything else was a part of it. If one didn't look carefully at the dots of light, they would think that they were snowflakes dancing in the air. They couldn't be more wrong.
<br><br>
Chapter 4197 The Human Spirits The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, floating above Zen, stared blankly at the countless dots of light in front of them.
<br><br>
"Are all these the creatures of the main world locked in this Cold Prison?"
<br><br>
asked the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
All he knew about the Cold Prison, and little else, was that it was the most frigid place there was.
<br><br>
"That's right," Zen replied with a nod.
<br><br>
"Can you see their original appearances?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord asked again.
<br><br>
"Yes, and so can you," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
A ball of green light burst out from the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization in the primitive land. A whirring sound began to hum within the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization in the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
Buzz! The eyes of Zen and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord now glowed with a green light.
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization could decipher the Cold Prison quickly.
<br><br>
That was why it took only a moment for the original appearances of the countless light dots to become visible to Zen and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
"What a unique ability! It assessed the light dots and restored them just like that!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord exclaimed in awe. His eyes widened, however, when he realized what he was now looking at. "Are these human spirits?" he sputtered out.
<br><br>
Zen nodded.
<br><br>
It was almost impossible to distinguish between human spirits and human race from appearance alone. However, since the seventy-seventh chaotic era, only the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had set foot in the Jade Pure Realm, so he knew it was impossible for any other human to be here.
<br><br>
These human spirits must have been in the Cold Prison for many years.
<br><br>
They were wrapped in the same golden armors and lay side by side, motionless on the ground.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid these human spirits may be dead," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said gingerly.
<br><br>
"I don't think so." Zen shook his head. "I know of a giant who survived the Cold Prison in the upper ice field of the Blooming Jade Stage, and his strength was far inferior to that of human spirits."
<br><br>
The giant Pompeo was born after the change of Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He was powerful as a creature of that world, but he was much weaker than the human spirits.
<br><br>
If Pompeo could emerge from the ordeal safe and sound, so, too, could human spirits.
<br><br>
"You could know for sure if you check the Cold Prison yourself, but I don't know if your body can withstand it," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord suggested with some hesitation in his voice.
<br><br>
The power of the Cold Prison was overwhelming. It literally could freeze everything. Zen wouldn't have dared to enter it in the past.
<br><br>
However, Zen's body was no longer the same after the ancestry-level bloodline strengthened it. Moreover, he could also use the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"I'll give it a try."
<br><br>
Zen was much more confident to take the Cold Prison on now.
<br><br>
He approached slowly and reached out to touch its surface.
<br><br>
A burning sensation flashed through him. The pain lasted only for a split second, however, as his entire body turned to ice on the spot.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The Cold Prison not only froze every tissue in Zen's body but also affected his inner world.
<br><br>
The frigid air went straight into Zen's cinnabar field and started seeping through the blood-colored sky. Left unhampered, it would be enough to freeze the entire primitive land and kill most of the creatures living in it.
<br><br>
It never got to that point, however.
<br><br>
The moment the cold air invaded, the ancestry-level bloodline had immediately launched a counterattack.
<br><br>
Energy spiraled and gathered in the center of the blood-colored sky, forming a golden sun. The freezing mist immediately dissipated wherever the sunlight shone.
<br><br>
With the cold air extinguished, light beams rushed out from Zen's cinnabar field. The blazing energy flowed through his body, quickly thawing him.
<br><br>
Zen returned to normal, but not without a lecture from the ancestry-level bloodline. "Next time, before you do such a dangerous thing, inform me first."
<br><br>
Zen hung his head in embarrassment. "I had wanted to analyze the Cold Prison first, but I didn't expect it could freeze me that fast," Zen admitted sheepishly.
<br><br>
"There's no time for analysis in this place. You have to prepare in advance," the ancestry-level bloodline chastised.
<br><br>
"Could I enter the Cold Prison now, though?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, you may."
<br><br>
The sun in the primitive land now blazed heat throughout Zen's body, enabling him to endure the subzero temperatures around him.
<br><br>
Zen now stepped into the Cold Prison with ease.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The low temperature of the Cold Prison was offset by the high temperature in Zen's body, ending in a neutral state. A thin mist rose from Zen, making him look like a white bear, but he could move freely.
<br><br>
Zen walked up to the human spirits and inspected them.
<br><br>
They were still alive, with a rich amount of life energy still contained in their bodies. When Zen touched their heads, he discovered, however, that their minds were empty. It was as if they had lost their souls.
<br><br>
"Well? What have you found out?" The voice of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord suddenly piped up in Zen's mind. His remnant soul wouldn't be able to withstand the Cold Prison, so he could only hide within Zen.
<br><br>
"They have lost their souls." Zen frowned and shook his head. "Or more precisely, their Treacherous Beings. To human spirits, after all, the Treacherous Beings are their souls. There are no Treacherous Beings in their minds. These are just living husks."
<br><br>
Zen went to check several other human spirits and found only the same situation.
<br><br>
"I shall go further on and have a look."
<br><br>
Zen exited the Cold Prison and moved along the snake-shaped road.
<br><br>
There were golden-armored human spirits lying on both sides of the snake-shaped road along the first thousand feet or so. From that point on, the human spirits lying on the ground wore cyan armors.
<br><br>
It would seem those in the cyan armors were stronger than those in the golden ones.
<br><br>
At some point even further on, the human spirits, beautiful women among them, started sporting a variety of luxury clothes instead of armors. Zen went inside the Cold Prison to check again. Indeed, no souls remained either in the men or the women.
<br><br>
Zen continued on along the meandering road.
<br><br>
The road grew wider and wider until it diverged into three paths. Where the left and right paths ended were visible from this distance. But the middle path was obscured by a gate of carved ice.
<br><br>
Zen took the left path.
<br><br>
At the end was a burly man seated on an ice throne.
<br><br>
He seemed familiar, but Zen couldn't remember where he had seen him before.
<br><br>
Zen walked back to the crossroad and took the right path this time. At the end was a woman, again seated on an ice throne.
<br><br>
The woman looked very young. She sat sideways on the throne, her legs dangling stylishly from the armrest.
<br><br>
When Zen had gotten close enough to see the woman's face, however, his eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Dorothy?!" he blurted out.
<br><br>
Chapter 4198 A Worthwhile Trip Despite the woman having her eyes closed, she looked just like Dorothy.
<br><br>
But the ornaments she wore in her hair, the expression on her face, and the aura she emitted, were completely different from Dorothy's.
<br><br>
"Who is Dorothy?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord asked curiously.
<br><br>
Zen told him about Dorothy's origin and how she had suddenly disappeared.
<br><br>
Once he had heard the story, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord thought for a while. "In that case, I don't think it's a coincidence," he said, still thoughtful.
<br><br>
It wasn't rare for two women in the world to have the same appearance.
<br><br>
The key point was that Dorothy's origin was mysterious, and she might have something to do with the woman on the throne.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Dorothy had been missing for a while now, and without her presence, it was difficult to confirm the connection between the two.
<br><br>
Once he retreated from the diversion, Zen returned to the junction of the three roads and chose to enter the ice gate in the middle.
<br><br>
When Zen came into contact with the ice gate, he felt his hands grow heavy.
<br><br>
"This door is so heavy!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
But then, Elizabeth's words about the Cold Prisons came to mind.
<br><br>
Even after pouring the water from a sea into a Cold Prison, one could only get a thumb-sized piece of ice.
<br><br>
No one knew how much water had been used to condense this ice gate.
<br><br>
However, Zen's strength was no longer what it used to be. He had barely put his hands on the gate, when the power of his arms suddenly burst out.
<br><br>
A powerful aura surged around Zen's body, the shock waves of which were destructive. They left whip-like marks on the ground surrounding him.
<br><br>
"Open!"
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! The ice gate scraped the ground before a fist-sized crack appeared on it.
<br><br>
Zen was about to increase his strength to push the door, when a hand reached out from the crack and pressed to the side of the ice gate. The door swung open slowly.
<br><br>
A hunchbacked old man appeared in the doorway. He had one eye, and his lifeless-looking skin was deathly gray.
<br><br>
Zen instinctively took two steps backwards. On one hand, he was surprised that there was a living person inside. On the other hand, the old man had opened the gate so effortlessly, which indicated his great strength.
<br><br>
The old man then glanced at Zen, turned around to go back inside.
<br><br>
"Sir!" Zen shouted before the old man could disappear.
<br><br>
The old man turned a deaf ear to him.
<br><br>
Behind the ice gate was an open, circular ice hall, within which were many bodies scattered everywhere on the ground. These bodies looked to be the same as the bodies of the human spirits he had seen outside. They were not dead, but all of them had lost their souls.
<br><br>
The old man picked up a body from the ground, placed it on an ice platform in the middle of the hall, and began to carefully clean it.
<br><br>
The body seemed to have been there for a long time, and was covered in a layer of brown dust.
<br><br>
The old man cleaned up the dust on the body with a duster, little by little.
<br><br>
He then put the body back on the ground before picking another body and placing it on the platform.
<br><br>
"Sir, why do you clean them?" Zen asked, looking around him.
<br><br>
The old man didn't answer this question either. He just continued to work mechanically.
<br><br>
"Zen, why not check if this old man has a soul?" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord suggested.
<br><br>
"Wouldn't it be impolite?" Zen said, hesitant.
<br><br>
But on second thought, he knew what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord meant. He reached out a hand and pressed it against the old man's forehead.
<br><br>
The old man didn't resist or get angry.
<br><br>
The moment Zen pressed a hand to the old man's forehead, he felt the immensely strong aura of a Treacherous Being. Zen became uncomfortable, completely overwhelmed by this unpleasant feeling.
<br><br>
"He has a soul," he said, looking warily at the old man. He hesitated before saying, "No. This is a Treacherous Being that hasn't awakened yet."
<br><br>
"It is indeed a friendly type of Treacherous Being!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord exclaimed, having been right in his conjecture.
<br><br>
Many Treacherous Beings had obsessions that they always acted upon before they could meet the requirements that would allow them to awaken.
<br><br>
Some Treacherous Beings of the friendly type were not vicious. They merely repeated doing one task at all times.
<br><br>
This old man was obviously one such Treacherous Being. As long as Zen didn't stop him from cleaning up the bodies, the old man wouldn't attack him.
<br><br>
He cleaned up the bodies one after another and then placed them in order.
<br><br>
Presumably, the human spirits that lined up outside in order were the old man's doing.
<br><br>
"He can't respond to us since he is not awakened," Zen said, dejected.
<br><br>
It was not easy to wake a Treacherous Being. Campbell had once possessed Zen and taken him all the way from the Whining Road to the Pure Sky Platform. That was when Campbell had finally woken up.
<br><br>
It would be unrealistic to expect the old man to wake up in such a short time. All Zen could do was look for other clues.
<br><br>
Zen passed through the scattered bodies before arriving at the innermost layer of the ice palace. A door stood here as well.
<br><br>
The moment Zen approached the door, the old man suddenly turned around and began to sing a rhythmic song.
<br><br>
"He's speaking!"
<br><br>
Zen exclaimed, whirling around to face the old man.
<br><br>
The old man tilted his head as he looked at Zen, and continued to say something.
<br><br>
Zen quickly activated the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, which then began to decipher the Sanskrit words the old man was speaking.
<br><br>
A short while later, the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization passed the translation to Zen.
<br><br>
"That's the master's room. You can't go there. It's very dangerous and you will face the anger of the master."
<br><br>
The old man repeated this sentence over and over again.
<br><br>
It was more like a hint from a machine rather than words being said through logical thinking.
<br><br>
Zen asked tentatively, "Who is your master?"
<br><br>
The group in his inner world began to work and help Zen pass on the message through a song.
<br><br>
"It's our king, Master Kincaid," the old man said, his voice still numb and singsong.
<br><br>
At these words, Zen's and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's hearts began to race.
<br><br>
Finding Kincaid had been the biggest goal of this trip, and this sentence that the old man had just uttered meant that they had mostly succeeded.
<br><br>
"How do you know it's dangerous? Have you been there?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
The old man shook his head. "I have never been in there, but Cornelius had. He died inside."
<br><br>
"Cornelius?"
<br><br>
"The Snake Spirit King? Died inside?"
<br><br>
Zen was shocked.
<br><br>
If the door of the altar needed the key from the Soul City to open it, he should have been the first person to enter it.
<br><br>
But why had the Snake Spirit King been able to enter this place before him? Zen related what he had heard to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, who was also lost in thought.
<br><br>
The old man's unintentional words had created a strange situation for them.
<br><br>
After a long while, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, "What if the Snake Spirit King had long since known of this key's existence?"
<br><br>
"You mean he opened the door of the altar with the key?" Zen said, baffled.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded before saying, "Yes. If that's the case, then the Snake Spirit King must want to get something from the Human Spirit King. But not only did he not get it, he was even killed inside when he was in the form of a Treacherous Being!"
<br><br>
"And the Snake Spirit King then secretly put the key back in the Soul City?" Zen said contemplatively. "This does not make sense. The Snake Spirit King couldn't have been so confident about my strength!" he said.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord fell silent for a long while before he seemed to figure it out. "The Snake Spirit King's confidence in you is not because of your strength, but because of your identity."
<br><br>
"My identity? What identity?" Zen asked suspiciously. He had thought of the ancestry-level bloodline, but even if the Snake Spirit King had superb foresight, it was impossible for him to have predicted that Zen would definitely absorb the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"Your identity as a human," said the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
Kincaid might kill people of other races, or any Treacherous Beings that entered the place. But he might not kill a human.
<br><br>
Chapter 4199 The Irregular Sword Whatever the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was theorizing was mere speculation. However, the conclusions they were drawing from the limited clues they had found seemed reasonable enough.
<br><br>
"What have we got to lose? We have to take a risk and try, right?" Zen smiled.
<br><br>
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded. He agreed with Zen. "We have no other choice."
<br><br>
Their adventure had begun the moment they had stepped foot in the Jade Pure Realm. They had no way back and the only way out was through.
<br><br>
Now, they simply had to take this final step.
<br><br>
"Let us see just how angry the Human Spirit King will be," Zen remarked, walking up to the door and pushing it open.
<br><br>
The stooped old man suddenly raised his head. There was a hint of hope gleaming in his eyes.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't aware of one very important thing. The old man was not yet awake and was still trapped in the Treacherous Being's consciousness sea.
<br><br>
However, he could still feel, hear, and react to the outside world.
<br><br>
In fact, he had almost screamed out what he had just said! The old man also hoped to wake up. He cleaned up the bodies of human spirits only because they were the members of his sect. This was just a secondary task. His greatest obsession, however, was the Human Spirit King, Kincaid.
<br><br>
If Kincaid could wake up, so could he.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen pushed the door open, an invisible hand grabbed him and dragged him inside.
<br><br>
Although this force was powerful, it was still possible for Zen to quite easily resist it. However, he allowed himself to be dragged in.
<br><br>
To his immense surprise, the other side of the door was not an ice palace.
<br><br>
It was an open stone house. But that wasn't the most surprising part.
<br><br>
"Every single stone in this house... is a Holy Stone!"
<br><br>
Zen gasped. As soon as he had come in, he had felt the aura of the Holy Stones.
<br><br>
"That's not everything. These are the highest quality of Holy Stones. I now understand why the Snake Spirit King died here," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord also piped in.
<br><br>
Fighting in such an environment would be highly disadvantageous for the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"What is that?"
<br><br>
Zen was looking straight ahead.
<br><br>
Right in the center of the stone house, a burly man was floating mid-air.
<br><br>
He was wearing a heavy black armor, and his entire body, including his face, was covered by it. They couldn't guess what material the armor was made of, and it emitted a highly strong deterrent force. Even approaching the man would take effort.
<br><br>
The most eye-catching thing about him was the heavy sword that was beside him.
<br><br>
It was ten feet long and was almost as tall as the man himself. There was a faint red light flashing on the irregularly shaped blade.
<br><br>
Was this the Human Spirit King, Kincaid? Zen carefully observed the black armor from the distance.
<br><br>
Before he could say something, a solemn voice came from the black armor.
<br><br>
"Who are you?"
<br><br>
When Zen heard the black armor speak, his heart was filled with joy. The fact that the man had first questioned him was a good sign.
<br><br>
He was afraid that the man would directly attack him without communicating with him. Since the Human Spirit King was rather famous and powerful, he was unwilling to fight against him if he could avoid it.
<br><br>
The voice did not seem mechanical, indicating that the man was still rational and could think for himself. This was easily the best that could be made of this situation! Zen took two steps forward, cupped his hands and said, "I'm Zen, a human being from the chaos!"
<br><br>
Human beings and human spirits were almost the same in appearance. In fact, in the third-grade world, human beings could easily be called extensions of the human spirits.
<br><br>
According to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's conjecture, the Human Spirit King most likely wouldn't attack Zen. However, conjectures could turn out to be false.
<br><br>
"You're not the one I'm waiting for. Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! With that angry snap, the irregular heavy sword flew up in the air, and then suddenly rushed forward, breaking through space and slashing at Zen's head.
<br><br>
"What..."
<br><br>
Zen's heart was filled with depression at this.
<br><br>
A moment ago, he had been feeling rather lucky and pleased, but now, the man was attacking him. He was shocked and caught off guard.
<br><br>
Reflexively, he leaned back, and the sword almost grazed his nose as it shot past him.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
The wall behind Zen exploded and a series of dark red shock waves could be seen emanating from where the sword had hit.
<br><br>
"The destruction quadrant! The thirteenth ability... the nineteenth... the twenty-sixth... the thirtieth..."
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline quickly analyzed the power of the heavy sword when it saw those explosions. Although what they were seeing was perhaps not as domineering as the power of the Monkey Spirit King, it seemed to be more formidable somehow.
<br><br>
As soon as the ancestry-level bloodline had analyzed the power of this sword strike, the heavy sword disappeared in an instant.
<br><br>
When it appeared once again, it was no longer a single sword, but seven! These seven heavy swords seemed unreal. They were constantly flashing with some sort of light, and even looking at them could give people a headache.
<br><br>
"The space-time quadrant. The first ability, the third, the thirty-third..."
<br><br>
Zen's mind quickly analyzed the abilities hidden in the heavy swords. It came naturally to him now.
<br><br>
"It's just one sword, but it is using an ingenious space theurgy that is not commonly visible. The blood power doesn't seem to be coming from the Human Spirit King, but from the heavy sword itself. Is it possible for the sword to also inherit the power of the ancestry-level bloodline?"
<br><br>
While Zen was analyzing the seven heavy swords, his figure flashed slightly, like a willow leaf floating out. His movement technique also contained a mysterious space theurgy that he had received from the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Every single one of the seven swords failed to hit Zen! The next moment, he had appeared in front of the black armor.
<br><br>
"Sir, I don't mean to offend you. I just want to know..."
<br><br>
Before Zen could finish his sentence, the armor had stretched out a huge black hand to grab Zen's neck. At the same time, it spread out its other hand, and one of the huge swords appeared there all of a sudden. The hand then slashed horizontally, trying to cut Zen into pieces.
<br><br>
Zen managed to slip away just in the nick of time. He avoided the sword attack and this time, trace of annoyance appeared in his eyes. "It looks like you want to determine the outcome of this fight before you are willing to talk! Very well, let's do that!"
<br><br>
The scene that followed was remarkable. Zen's body was constantly flashing all over the stone house as he moved around everywhere. The irregular heavy sword followed closely behind him like a maggot attached to its bone. The stone hall was filled with the shadows of Zen and the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
The sword seemed to be moving at an astonishing pace, but Zen was faster.
<br><br>
With the help of the ancestry-level bloodline, he could control all the abilities of the entire space-time quadrant. This allowed him to even find out the possible future location of the sword and throw a punch in the right direction.
<br><br>
Boom! The shadows of the sword could be seen swinging wildly in a circle as the punch landed right on target.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline not only possessed unparalleled abilities, but also strengthened Zen's body a few times once it had bonded with him.
<br><br>
Now, Zen's body was totally different from what it had been some time ago. He was much more powerful and a single punch was powerful enough to shake the fabric of space.
<br><br>
After the punch had landed, Zen's figure flashed once again. He arrived at a new position, and threw another punch in the air.
<br><br>
Boom! The sword blade was hit again.
<br><br>
In terms of mastery over space and speed, Zen had the upper hand.
<br><br>
Dong, dong, dong...
<br><br>
The heavy sword received several blows again and again, as Zen landed several punches on it within a span of a few seconds.
<br><br>
Once the sword was hit by dozens of punches, a crack finally appeared on its surface.
<br><br>
"Break it!"
<br><br>
Now it was Zen who was chasing after the heavy sword and attacking it rapidly! However, at that moment, a bright flash of a green light burst out from the crack, and the strong life energy that was emanating from within quickly repaired the crack.
<br><br>
"The life quadrant. The thirty-sixth ability, the fortieth..."
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline once again analyzed the abilities which were being used to repair the sword.
<br><br>
"This sword is so remarkable. Where did it come from?"
<br><br>
Zen was a little surprised now. A sword that actually had the abilities of several quadrants at the same time and could even repair itself when required! "It's the Life Iron..."
<br><br>
"It comes from the Deep Space.
<br><br>
You can think of it as a living being, as much as the man in front of you."
<br><br>
The voice of the ancestry-level bloodline came from Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
Although it had forgotten a lot of important things, some of its memories from the Deep Space were still well preserved.
