Chapter 4000 An Ingenious Place The Treacherous Being controlling Zen's physical body quickly climbed to the top of the pagoda mountain from the front and slid down from the back.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
It was on the mountainside when it stopped suddenly.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes glittered with excitement, his voice rising an octave. "Yes, it is right here!"
<br><br>
"But there is nothing here!" Zen said in confusion, looking around.
<br><br>
But before Zen could finish speaking, the Treacherous Being controlling his body hefted a mighty slap at the pagoda mountain.
<br><br>
Bang! Although these pagoda mountains were made of stone, they were covered with dust and soil as time went by.
<br><br>
After the Treacherous Being had launched a palm strike, the thin layer of soil on the surface of the mountain shattered, revealing a huge red copper disk. The surface of the copper disk was engraved with intricate patterns.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The surface of the red copper disk glowed when a thick light film covered it.
<br><br>
"What should we do next?" Zen asked in his mind. "Do we really need to push this pagoda mountain over?"
<br><br>
"Of course," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile. "There are four pagoda mountains in all that need to be overturned. I had spent a lot of time and energy at the time to find these four mountains."
<br><br>
As he spoke, the Treacherous Being maneuvered Zen's body so that it slammed viciously into the red copper disk.
<br><br>
The light film on the surface of the disk was solid. The power released in a collision could reach a million divine megatons, but it failed to break the light film.
<br><br>
Boom! The collision between Zen's body and the red copper disk produced a huge shock wave that rippled outwards and also affected the surrounding pagoda mountains.
<br><br>
The surfaces of these pagoda mountains were covered in soil.
<br><br>
The shock wave shattered the soil on the surface of each pagoda mountain, revealing what lay underneath. Each mountain was actually a tall pagoda made of red copper metal.
<br><br>
"Are all these pagoda mountains made of metal?" Zen asked, surprised, as he looked around at the copper pagoda mountains.
<br><br>
There was no doubt that the nature was ingenious, but it was impossible to cast so many smooth pagoda mountains with metal.
<br><br>
"All the pagoda mountains are like this," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, nodding. "These were man-made but we do not know who built them and why."
<br><br>
Anything in the Three Purities Stage that couldn't be explained would be explained away as being related to the Instant Civilization.
<br><br>
The blow from the Treacherous Being had caused the huge pagoda mountain to tilt a little.
<br><br>
It was not easy to overturn such a huge metal pagoda mountain.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! The Treacherous Being then hit it for the second time, and then the third time, the fourth time...
<br><br>
Every time they collided, the pagoda mountain would tilt a little more.
<br><br>
When the pagoda mountain had tilted to a certain extent, Zen was surprised to find that it was locked to the ground with gear wheels. At the bottom of the pagoda mountain were two small and one huge gear wheels. The two small ones were tightly connected to the huge one.
<br><br>
"How could such things exist under the Myriad Pagoda Mountains?" The more Zen looked at them, the more surprised he became.
<br><br>
"It is ingenious!" Smiling, the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, "There are many gear wheels of different sizes buried in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. These are ingenious, but they are only used to open the door.
<br><br>
The Instant Civilization has simpler and more intuitive methods of building the door. But they still put a lot of time and energy into making such complicated things."
<br><br>
Zen's gaze turned to the distance where he saw countless pagoda mountains standing proudly, their edges invisible to the naked eye. "It is such a huge area and every part of it has been so carefully carved! This is simply mindblowing!"
<br><br>
"There was no point of them doing this. They just did it to kill time," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said meaningfully.
<br><br>
"Do you mean..." Zen uttered, his eyes lighting up.
<br><br>
"The Instant Civilization was trapped here," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered Zen's unasked question.
<br><br>
Although Zen had known a part of the truth, he was not as thoughtful as the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others. The humans deduced from and restored every detail they found in the Three Purities Stage, hoping to find out more information. The Primeval Lord of Heaven was naturally much more knowledgeable than Zen in this respect.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
Only after repeated hits was the huge pagoda mountain finally overturned.
<br><br>
But the moment it touched the ground, a loud mechanical click sounded from within the mountain.
<br><br>
"There are huge spring pieces at the bottom of the pagoda mountain, which, when they bounce back, will slowly help the pagoda mountain stand up again. The process will take thirty-two hours," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained, before Zen could ask a question.
<br><br>
If one wanted to go into this underground space, they had to overturn four pagoda mountains within thirty-two hours. After thirty-two hours, the first pagoda mountain would bounce back into place.
<br><br>
"This whole process is so precise." Zen sighed.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being looked around for a while and then headed north again.
<br><br>
"We can get to the second pagoda mountain by moving three thousand miles to the north and then one thousand five hundred miles to the east," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
Just as the Primeval Lord of Heaven had explained, the Treacherous Being turned east after traveling north for three thousand miles. It then found another pagoda mountain one thousand five hundred miles away.
<br><br>
The first pagoda mountain was huge. One could tell at a glance that it was unusual.
<br><br>
There was nothing special about the second pagoda mountain. It was by no means an easy task to look for it among the countless pagoda mountains.
<br><br>
But it was as if the Treacherous Being could sense it, and it climbed up the mountain quickly.
<br><br>
Just as it had done to the first pagoda mountain, the Treacherous Being began to slam its fist into the second pagoda mountain, causing it to fall to the ground, part by part.
<br><br>
Once it had overturned the second pagoda mountain, the Treacherous Being maneuvered Zen's body towards the northeast, in search of the third pagoda mountain.
<br><br>
It had dealt with three pagoda mountains smoothly.
<br><br>
The Myriad Pagoda Mountains looked desolate. There were no warriors from other races or beasts.
<br><br>
The Wing King flew over the Blood Swamp, when the Treacherous Being was overturning these pagoda mountains.
<br><br>
With the Wing King's help, the Snake Goddess and others were not afraid of the Soul Leeches and Worm Lizards in the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
But he didn't dare to fly too high! The three Eternal Realm Hunters were familiar with the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
There was a kind of evil bird that lived in the Blood Swamp, which, when it discovered a target, would emerge to attack it.
<br><br>
The Wing King kept a low altitude and flew dangerously close to the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
He encountered several troubles along the way, but he managed to deftly dodge all of them.
<br><br>
After leaving the Blood Swamp, the Wing King communicated with the Regal Jade Spirit through the Civilization Artifact again. After confirming Zen's location, he went straight to the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.
<br><br>
"The Myriad Pagoda Mountains should be the safest area in the Supreme Pure Realm. We have explored it before, but there are just huge copper mountains. There isn't anything magical about it," said Fuxi.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess didn't say anything. When she had last entered the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, she had felt this area to be unique, and her intuition had told her that there must be something underneath it all. She and Fuxi had also tried to break through a pagoda mountain, but hadn't found anything unusual.
<br><br>
Chapter 4001 The Six-headed Eagle This was the Wing King's first time at the Supreme Pure Realm, so he was mostly just curious and kept silent.
<br><br>
Pearson, the most knowledgeable among the Eternal Realm Hunters, smiled faintly and echoed challengingly, "There isn't anything magical about the Myriad Pagoda Mountains? You are totally wrong."
<br><br>
Fuxi frowned slightly. "Then, pray tell me what makes it so magical."
<br><br>
Pearson pointed at the mountains. "These mountains are the keys."
<br><br>
"Keys?" The Snake Goddess echoed in confusion.
<br><br>
Pearson nodded and continued. "The so-called Myriad Pagoda Mountains are actually countless keys arranged together. If you turn the keys in an order within a certain period of time, you will be able to open a passage.
<br><br>
And a different passage will be opened if you change the order."
<br><br>
"For example...?"
<br><br>
Just as the Snake Goddess was about to say something, Pearson cut in, "For example, the passage to the Jade Pure Realm is also controlled by these mountains."
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes lit up excitedly at his words.
<br><br>
To them, this had been an ordinary mountain range. Who knew it carried such secrets? "But how can these mountains control the passages? Are there magic arrays inside them?" the Snake Goddess pressed inquisitively.
<br><br>
"We once shattered the soil on the surface of a mountain," Fuxi added, his frown deepening, "and we found a circular array, but it only formed a shield."
<br><br>
"That shield is used to push over the mountain." Pearson shrugged. "The way to open the passages is to push over the corresponding mountains."
<br><br>
"But there are so many mountains here. How do we know which ones we should push?" asked Yasamin, brows furrowing.
<br><br>
Thurston calmly began to explain, "The name Myriad Pagoda Mountains doesn't suggest that there are myriad mountains, but that there are a myriad of ways to permute the mountains. It is really difficult to get the right coordinates. So far, only a few ways have been established, and even then, they're in the hands of the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race."
<br><br>
Although the Eternal Realm Hunters knew the secrets of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, they did not know the specific ways to open the passages.
<br><br>
"Now the Treacherous Being constantly changes its direction. Does it mean that it has a way to open the passage?" the Wing King suddenly interjected.
<br><br>
When Pearson heard this, he raised his eyebrows. He had been answering the questions of Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, all the while completely glossing over Zen's situation.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being did not devour Zen. Instead, it used his body to unconsciously run in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. Was it possible that it was going to open a passage? If so...
<br><br>
"That's possible!" Thurston exclaimed in excitement.
<br><br>
"Every passage that opens in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains will be extremely valuable. We need to catch up to Zen," Pearson urged.
<br><br>
Whoosh! With that, the Wing King spread his wings and transformed into a ray of green light, shooting towards the mountains at lightning speed.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were keeping an eye out for a specific mountain.
<br><br>
"The fourth mountain, five thousand to the north, and three thousand and one to the west," the Primeval Lord of Heaven reported the location of the last mountain. Then, the Treacherous Being headed northwest.
<br><br>
When it arrived at the 3001st mountain in the west, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zen thought it would stop and push the mountain to the ground.
<br><br>
To their surprise, it completely ignored the mountain and continued heading west.
<br><br>
"Did we miss it?" Zen asked suspiciously.
<br><br>
"Impossible." The Primeval Lord of Heaven narrowed his eyes and shook his head. "Why would it miss it?"
<br><br>
"Maybe you made a mistake," Zen said slowly.
<br><br>
"That's impossible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said firmly.
<br><br>
"I've told you before that many passages could be opened in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, and the one we opened might not be the passage to the Jade Pure Realm." The voice of the Snake Goddess suddenly came out from Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
The thirty-nine heroes of the human race were trapped in the passage in the seventy-eighth chaotic era.
<br><br>
The chaos was in its early stages at the time.
<br><br>
Many of the ruling civilizations had very little understanding of the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven led the human race to wander around in the Supreme Pure Realm. They killed a huge ice snake in the Freezing Wilderness, and took out an ancient picture from the ice snake's body. From this ancient picture, they had obtained the method to open the passage.
<br><br>
"Perhaps your guess is right." The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
In fact, in over a thousand chaotic eras that followed, only six passages had been opened in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, all of which were in the hands of the Element Spirit Civilization or the Nihility race.
<br><br>
The situation was different after every mountain was pushed over. Since the Treacherous Being did not push over the mountain as the Primeval Lord of Heaven predicted, it seemed that it had no plans of opening that passage.
<br><br>
The situation had changed again, and Zen had no choice but to wait and observe.
<br><br>
A few minutes later, the Treacherous Being finally chose to knock down the fourth mountain.
<br><br>
To their surprise, while the fourth mountain toppled down, another mountain, namely the fifth, was knocked down as well.
<br><br>
After that, the Treacherous Being continued to head to the east. It was obvious that it was going to look for the sixth mountain.
<br><br>
The easternmost side of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains was connected to the Freezing Wilderness, where the temperature gradually dropped. The mountaintops were covered with a thick layer of snow.
<br><br>
In a mountain, a group of people in black robes were advancing in a line.
<br><br>
They resembled normal human beings. They were all clad in special, thick robes, as if they were extremely afraid of the sunlight. Not an inch of skin was exposed.
<br><br>
"Dad, we've been looking for the eagles for half a month. Will we really find them?" a slightly childish voice whined.
<br><br>
"I'm sure we will," a calm voice replied. "I'm not worried that we won't find them, but if we can subdue them once we find them. Alas..."
<br><br>
"Don't worry, chief. Although those eagles are powerful, we are fully prepared this time. We will definitely succeed!"
<br><br>
"Yes, we are determined to get what we want this time!"
<br><br>
"We won't fail!"
<br><br>
Some subordinates pitched in to boost their morale.
<br><br>
"I hope so," the leader said with a nod.
<br><br>
This time, their race acted quickly yet quietly, since their lives depended on it.
<br><br>
They had to succeed.
<br><br>
At this moment, the group suddenly heard a loud chirp from the distance.
<br><br>
"Aoo..."
<br><br>
An eagle with six heads flew across the sky, its shadow dancing on the mountains.
<br><br>
Hearing the scream of the six-headed eagle, everyone stood vigilantly against the mountain wall.
<br><br>
Their thick robes changed color automatically, and they melted into the mountain wall, camouflaging into the mountainside perfectly.
<br><br>
"Follow me!"
<br><br>
the leader hissed.
<br><br>
They moved against the mountain wall nimbly, like wolves stalking their prey. It was not difficult for them to quickly chase after the six-headed eagle along the mountainside.
<br><br>
Chapter 4002 Lure Wind ran through the six-headed eagle's feathery wings as it flew slowly.
<br><br>
It almost had no real opponents in the Supreme Pure Realm, or perhaps no other creatures dared to challenge it.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it also had no natural enemies, so there was no need for it to be too vigilant.
<br><br>
The six-headed eagle's nest was built on top of a mountain, where it housed three crystal-clear eggs.
<br><br>
All the living beings in the Supreme Pure Realm highly treasured those glowing eggs. That was because the liquid inside the eggs had a magical corrosive ability—and in theory, it could corrode everything, even space itself.
<br><br>
That corrosive ability was the six-headed eagle's talent. Some creatures hoped to have such an ability, so they tried to subdue, lure, or even force the six-headed eagle, but to no avail.
<br><br>
After all, the six-headed eagle was the most irritable creature in the Supreme Pure Realm. Anyone who dared provoke it got corroded into a wisp of smoke.
<br><br>
If they wanted to stay in the Supreme Pure Realm, however, they needed to rely on the six-headed eagle's corrosive ability to break spaces.
<br><br>
But since they couldn't personally use its powers, they shifted their attention to its eggs. Besides, the corrosive power inside the eggs was much stronger than its own.
<br><br>
Moreover, the six-headed eagle was not intelligent, nor did it live in groups.
<br><br>
Thus, it gave the other creatures a chance to steal its eggs.
<br><br>
At that moment, several people in thick robes came for the six-headed eagle's eggs.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! As they advanced, the color of their thick robes steadily changed.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the six-headed eagle did not notice them along the way at all.
<br><br>
After they followed the six-headed eagle for four hundred miles, they finally saw a massive nest.
<br><br>
Thick green tree branches sprawled across the mountaintop and their seemingly irregular arrangement formed a typical nest. From afar, it looked like a green ring on top of the mountain.
<br><br>
"Aoo! Aoo!"
<br><br>
The six-headed eagle roared in the sky.
<br><br>
Six heads popped out from the nest in response. It was another eagle.
<br><br>
It turned out that the flying eagle was the male, which was responsible for hunting outside, while the female eagle that stayed in the nest hatched the eggs.
<br><br>
Then, the male loosened its grip and dropped its prey down from the sky.
<br><br>
The prey was a big stone turtle.
<br><br>
The stone turtle was one of the sturdiest creatures in the Supreme Pure Realm. Its stone shell had a very tough defensive strength. The shell looked ordinary, but it contained a unique space rule. Even some of the most powerful creatures couldn't capture it.
<br><br>
Whoosh! When the stone turtle fell, the female eagle caught it with its five heads.
<br><br>
These eagles' six heads were not independent. The biggest head was in charge of the other heads. If it got decapitated, a second head took its place.
<br><br>
The five heads were like one hand that caught the stone turtle.
<br><br>
As soon as it caught its prey, the biggest head opened its mouth and gently spat at the stone turtle.
<br><br>
Green liquid splattered all over the turtle shell.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! The eagle's green saliva was highly corrosive. As a result, the indestructible turtle shell quickly began to crack.
<br><br>
The turtle inside the shell began to struggle like mad under the intense pain and tried to escape from the female eagle.
<br><br>
However, it could not break free since it directly fell into the eagles' nest.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the female eagle's heads probed inside the turtle shell through the crack and began to eat the stone turtle's flesh. It was quite a bloody scene.
<br><br>
In just a few seconds, it ate up the whole stone turtle and threw the shell down the mountain. The shell fell to the ground with a slight crash, and left a big hole on the soil.
<br><br>
There were many kinds of bones at the foot of the mountain. All of them were remains from the eagles' food.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the creatures wrapped in thick robes hid at the foot of the mountain. The sudden crash of the turtle shell startled them, and when the leader saw the shell's corroded surface, he could not help but shake his head and sigh.
<br><br>
The six-headed eagle had used a lot of its saliva to erode the turtle shell, and they only needed a cup of it.
<br><br>
However, the six-head eagle was quite irritable and attacked anyone who trespassed its territory. If they wanted to obtain its corrosive saliva, they had to carefully take the eggs away.
<br><br>
Just then, the leader raised his hands and secretly made a gesture.
<br><br>
At the foot of the mountain far away, a man in a black robe brought out an iron cage from his Sumeru Space. Then, he left the cage on the ground and trotted away.
<br><br>
The iron cage continuously shook after it was placed on the ground like something wanted to get out of it.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The creature inside kept kicking the cage until it finally broke. A black bird that was as tall as a human came out. It was a Black Teeth Swallow. It flew very fast, and it was the six-headed eagles' favorite food.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The Black Teeth Swallow did not know that there was a natural enemy above it. It just wanted to return to the sky right now.
<br><br>
Unbeknownst to it, the male eagle was at one side of its nest, looking around.
<br><br>
Suddenly, it saw a black shadow above. Its six heads let out excited squawks at the same time. The Black Teeth Swallow was its favorite food after all, but it was too small to fill its belly. Thus, it was not worth to travel thousands of miles to hunt for it.
<br><br>
The Black Teeth Swallow seldom appeared in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, but the six-headed eagles did not fear anything. After all, two eagles guarded the nest.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! When the Black Teeth Swallow saw its natural enemy in the distance, it immediately felt scared to death and used all of its strength to escape.
<br><br>
The men in robes had previously fed it with the Phoenix Blood, which increased its speed for a few hours. The six-headed eagles would not catch up with it in just a short time.
<br><br>
Thus, the two birds, one big and one small, quickly flew into the distance.
<br><br>
Upon seeing what happened, the leader of the men in black robes waved his hand again. Then, another man nearby placed an iron cage on the ground. In a few seconds, a second Black Teeth Swallow came out of the cage.
<br><br>
The female eagle did not usually leave the nest.
<br><br>
However, it clearly could not resist the temptation of its favorite food.
<br><br>
The female eagle in the nest also keenly discovered the Black Teeth Swallow that was quickly rising in the air. It let out an anxious squawk in an attempt to call the male eagle to catch the Black Teeth Swallow.
<br><br>
The only thing was, the male eagle had left to chase after the first Black Teeth Swallow.
<br><br>
The female eagle thought about its own situation. It thought that it would not take too long to hunt a Black Teeth Swallow. Therefore, for the first time, it left the nest and chased after the second Black Teeth Swallow.
<br><br>
The men in robes had also fed the second Black Teeth Swallow with the Phoenix Blood. It flew at top speed and lured the female eagle to fly away quickly.
<br><br>
"They are really stupid birds!" the leader sneered. "Hurry up! Now is the time!" he urged his companions.
<br><br>
In turn, the other men in robes jumped and climbed towards the nest at the top of the mountain.
<br><br>
Chapter 4003 Failure Since it would take some time for the six-headed eagles to catch up with the Black Teeth Swallows, the black-robed men decided to seize this opportunity and take their eggs away.
<br><br>
The Black Teeth Swallows could fly really fast, which effectively bought some time for the black-robed men. In the end, however, escaping from the six-headed eagles would be futile.
<br><br>
It wasn't a question of if but a question of when the six-headed eagles would catch their prey. The amount of time it would take, however, depended purely on luck.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Since they were determined to not let the opportunity slide, the black-robed men climbed up the mountain as fast as they could.
<br><br>
The rest of the black-robed men below held their breath and stared at the top of the pagoda mountain. This was a life and death matter for their race so it was understandable that everyone was nervous.
<br><br>
The leader's son craned his neck in the other direction, towards where the second Black Teeth Swallow had escaped. The female eagle chased after it.
<br><br>
The two figures, one big and the other small, shuttled through the mountains! Puff! Perhaps the Black Teeth Swallow was nervous, or maybe it was excited after it swallowed the Phoenix Blood. The leader's son couldn't be too sure but those were the only explanations he could come up with as he watched the bird crash onto a pagoda mountain and die.
<br><br>
With its prey dead, the female eagle swooped down and caught the Black Teeth Swallow in its mouth before it promptly turned back towards the direction of its nest.
<br><br>
The leader's son froze in shock when he saw this. "Father! The female eagle is coming back!"
<br><br>
His father was well aware since he also heard the faint thump of the collision and witnessed the Black Teeth Swallow's death. Things weren't going so well since their subordinates were still on the process of climbing the mountain and reached only two-thirds of the height of the mountain.
<br><br>
The situation just grew ten times more dangerous! "Shall we ask them to retreat?" the son asked.
<br><br>
There was a grave look on the leader's face but he shook his head. "If they retreat now, then we will lose our one and only chance."
<br><br>
The Black Teeth Swallows were rare treasures in the Supreme Pure Realm and it took them a lot of effort to catch two of them.
<br><br>
If they let this chance go, then they wouldn't have enough time to capture another Black Teeth Swallow for their mission.
<br><br>
The son frowned in worry as he stared at their subordinates who remained on the mountain. "If they don't retreat then they'll..."
<br><br>
There weren't many members of their race, but the members were very tightly-knit and got along extremely well. How could the leader's son bear to see them die? However, his father had already decided. "For the sake of our tribe," he said firmly.
<br><br>
Their race had a lot of old, weak members. If they gave up now, then they would face a calamity and die.
<br><br>
A small sacrifice was needed for the greater good.
<br><br>
It would be better for twenty people to risk their lives for the sake of their entire race.
<br><br>
The son, however, remained adamant. "The female eagle will definitely return to its nest. It would be meaningless for them to sacrifice themselves!"
<br><br>
"Shut up!" the leader scolded. He did not look at his son with a father's gaze but with the hard, cold glare of a superior.
<br><br>
The other warriors could say nothing as they knew what they signed up for.
<br><br>
They were all willing to follow their leader and sacrifice themselves if need be.
<br><br>
That did not mean that they weren't scared. Death always made the strongest men tremble in their boots and these warriors were no different.
<br><br>
When the leader scolded his son, the latter immediately turned and walked away.
<br><br>
"Elroy!" his father shouted after him. However, his son turned a deaf ear to his cries.
<br><br>
Without looking back, Elroy suddenly jumped along the pagoda mountain and whistled upwards. "Look here!" he cried out.
<br><br>
He wanted to attract the female eagle's attention and buy time for the twenty black-robed men.
<br><br>
The female eagle had no idea that its nest was about to be raided, so it flapped its wings unhurriedly and savored its food.
<br><br>
Elroy's cry distracted the eagle and all its six heads looked down to find him beckoning from below.
<br><br>
Down there was a brat actually stupid enough to provoke it.
<br><br>
Instead of irritation, the eagle's first reaction was confusion.
<br><br>
It wasn't that intelligent and got puzzled by Elroy's provocation.
<br><br>
"Elroy!" the leader shouted.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the eagle had already taken notice of his son. Soon enough, it quickly flapped its wings and swooped down toward the young man.
<br><br>
When Elroy saw that his plan worked, he immediately went all out and shouted at the eagle that now came rushing towards him! As it was about to swoop down towards the boy, the eagle suddenly felt that something was wrong. One of its six heads looked up to see the black-robed men slowly approach its nest! "Aoo!" it cried out.
<br><br>
After it realized that it had been fooled, the female eagle immediately rose and flew back straight to its nest.
<br><br>
"Damn it!" Elroy cursed. He was only able to buy a small amount of time for his men, and the pang of disappointment hit him when the eagle suddenly left.
<br><br>
The twenty black-robed men pushed their speed to the limit. None of them had any idea what had transpired below and could only hear the cries of the six-headed eagle get ever closer. However, they did not pay any attention to it and simply rushed to finish their job.
<br><br>
They were still two thousand feet away from the nest and they could reach it in twelve seconds at most.
<br><br>
However, at that moment, the female eagle suddenly flew up to the top of the pagoda mountain.
<br><br>
Five of its six heads opened their mouths and sprayed corrosive saliva all over the mountain face.
<br><br>
This saliva formed a thin line on the mountain face and poured down like a green waterfall.
<br><br>
The sight of this corrosive saliva freaked the warriors out as they did their best to avoid it.
<br><br>
Their thick robes were made of special fabric and had good defensive power, but it was nothing when it went against the six-headed eagle's saliva.
<br><br>
When the saliva made contact with their robes, their true appearances were revealed. These men looked very similar to humans but had paper-white skin from not having seen the light of day for so many years.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss...
<br><br>
As their robes corroded from the saliva, the light soon began to disintegrate their flesh. They were actually creatures from the Dark Region! Their bodies did not stand a chance under the combined force of the corrosive saliva and the bright light.
<br><br>
"Aoo!"
<br><br>
As the female eagle landed safely back in its nest, it let out a huge cry directed to the leader's son down below. This was the only warning Elroy received before the eagle suddenly spat a mouthful of green saliva towards him.
<br><br>
Hiss, hiss, hiss...
<br><br>
Fortunately, the corrosive saliva disappeared before it reached him.
<br><br>
The six-headed eagle's saliva was terribly powerful and could even corrode the space.
<br><br>
Since there was a long distance between the top of the pagoda mountain and the foot of it, the saliva corroded the space along the way until none of it remained.
<br><br>
Of course, the female eagle already knew this but it only did that to give Elroy a warning.
<br><br>
The black-robed men below couldn't help but feel dejected.
<br><br>
Their plan had failed.
<br><br>
After a moment of silence, the leader turned to his men. "Before we came here, I made it clear to all of you that we would risk our lives to complete our task. I know that it seems as if we have failed and all our efforts have been in vain, but I urge you all to find the strength to try again if you find even the slimmest of chances!"
<br><br>
With their leader's encouragement, all the black-robed men that hid nearby revealed themselves and began moving towards the mountain top.
<br><br>
To go up and try to raid the eagles' nest at that moment was to court death but they did not care. They were ready to risk their lives to complete their mission! As they approached the mountain top, a low sound suddenly came from the distance.
<br><br>
It seemed someone currently ran at such a high speed that it caused the ground to tremble.
<br><br>
When the black-robed men looked up, they saw Zen! "A human being?"
<br><br>
"A human being in the Light Region?"
<br><br>
"What is he doing?"
<br><br>
All of them could only mutter in disbelief as they saw Zen rush towards them like a madman.
<br><br>
Elroy decided to come forward and try to stop him in his tracks, maybe even ask him what caused him to run like this.
<br><br>
However, it was like Zen did not see them. The man simply rushed towards the pagoda mountain and ran his way up the mountain.
<br><br>
Chapter 4004 A Sudden Stroke of Good Fortune Everyone began shouting at once. "It's dangerous there!"
<br><br>
"There is a six-headed eagle!"
<br><br>
"Get out of here right now!"
<br><br>
yelled the son of the leader. His call was echoed by several other men in black behind him. They wanted to stop Zen from climbing up.
<br><br>
However, Zen could not do as they said, even if he wanted to. The Treacherous Being had taken full control of his body. Although Zen's soul remained intact in his own head, he had no way to communicate with the Treacherous Being, so it was even less likely that the Treacherous Being could listen to anyone else.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, without getting distracted, Zen continued to climb up.
<br><br>
Clearly, the Treacherous Being was targeting the pagoda mountain upon which the six-headed eagles had built their nest.
<br><br>
The piercing cry of a bird echoed in the air.
<br><br>
The female eagle stretched out its neck to issue a warning call to Zen, who was already halfway to his goal.
<br><br>
The six-headed eagle was very sensitive to danger, and sensed that Zen possessed a strange and powerful aura. Wary of Zen, the eagle did not immediately spit out corrosive saliva at him.
<br><br>
Yet Zen continued to climb, oblivious to the threat posed by the six-headed eagle.
<br><br>
"Don't go up! That eagle has deadly saliva that will melt you completely. It has warned you already!"
<br><br>
"That is weird. The six-headed eagles are always ready to attack without warning."
<br><br>
"Yes, that female eagle is reacting in a strange way..."
<br><br>
The men wearing black robes had prepared well. Because they intended to steal the eggs of the six-headed eagles, they had thoroughly immersed themselves in the lore and habits of the eagles, investigating them to discover their patterns of behavior.
<br><br>
These men had learned that the eagles were quick to attack any creature that dared to approach them, so negotiation was virtually impossible. They would spit on anyone before they could say a word. The men had never seen the eagles hesitate before attacking an intruder.
<br><br>
So for a six-headed eagle to warn Zen was very unusual. If it had truly been a warning, then there was only one obvious explanation—something about Zen must have caused the eagle to be afraid of attacking him directly.
<br><br>
The black-robed men watched Zen closely. How powerful was this human youth? Everyone subconsciously rejected the idea that Zen could be very powerful.
<br><br>
After all, no matter how strong he was, he was still only a human. It was impossible for a human to grow strong enough for a six-headed eagle to be afraid of him.
<br><br>
The eagle let out another mournful cry. "Aooo!"
<br><br>
It was obvious that the eagle was trying to warn Zen to go away, instead of engaging him in direct battle. What was going on? Was a six-headed eagle really afraid of a mere human? The people in black robes were confused at the unexpected behavior of the eagle, but there was also a glimmer of hope rising in their hearts.
<br><br>
Could this human be capable of dealing with the six-headed eagles? The eagle got agitated after Zen ignored its second warning. It reared back and spat out a mouthful of deadly green saliva at Zen.
<br><br>
The caustic liquid sizzled upon contact with the air.
<br><br>
The eagle's saliva corroded everything it touched, even the air, and left behind a green line as it zoomed towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Zen darted to one side.
<br><br>
Controlled by the Treacherous Being, Zen's body had narrowly evaded the missile of deadly spit, dodging to the side with incredible speed and agility.
<br><br>
This was the first time that the Treacherous Being had avoided an attack! It seemed to understand that the green saliva was dangerous to its host body.
<br><br>
The six-headed eagle hooted furiously. All six heads rose together, and green smoke billowed in their beaks as they all prepared to spit simultaneously at the intruder.
<br><br>
Huge blobs of corrosive saliva rained down on Zen.
<br><br>
The men in black robes watched in tense silence, wondering how Zen would respond. Although they had never met him before, they recognized him as someone similar to themselves, and they felt some regret at the thought that he was about to be melted by the six-headed eagle's saliva after all.
<br><br>
But Zen was not about to stand still and wait to die.
<br><br>
Zen clung like a lizard to the wall of the pagoda mountain. He tilted back his head slightly and opened his mouth, releasing a white substance that fanned out across his body. As the white mass spread out, it thinned, like a white cloth that covered his body to provide protection against the corrosive saliva.
<br><br>
Although the eagle's spit could still corrode the body of the Treacherous Being, it didn't care.
<br><br>
The black-robed people were astonished by Zen's unexpected defensive maneuver.
<br><br>
"What is that white cloth made of? What a treasure it is, if the eagle's saliva can't corrode it!"
<br><br>
"I've never seen anything that could withstand the corrosive saliva before ..."
<br><br>
"Where did he learn to do that?"
<br><br>
Of course, what they didn't know was that the white cloth was the real body of the Treacherous Being, and that Zen was under its control.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on another pagoda mountain, the Wing King had descended.
<br><br>
Everyone on his back had witnessed what had been happening there.
<br><br>
"A part of the Treacherous Being's body voluntarily left Zen's body through his mouth. Should we act now?" asked King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"Act? How? Can we pull that thing out entirely?" Fuxi asked.
<br><br>
King Ieuan thought for a moment, but could not figure out a plan. Sighing, it said, "So we will just watch and do nothing?"
<br><br>
"The only thing we can do is wait. We must stay put and see what will happen next," said the Snake Goddess softly. "At least the Treacherous Being was able to protect Zen's body from the corrosive saliva."
<br><br>
Indeed, not only had the Treacherous Being preserved Zen's soul, it protected Zen's physical body. The situation was bad but not as dire as they had initially imagined.
<br><br>
The eagle continued to spit at Zen, who was pinned beneath the white cloth to the wall.
<br><br>
As the Treacherous Being blocked this wave of spit, it began to develop a rough estimate of the corrosive power of the eagle's saliva.
<br><br>
Its body was plastered closely over every inch of Zen's body, so it looked like Zen's figure was outlined by a layer of wet white cloth.
<br><br>
Zen lifted one arm, and the white cloth covered his skin closely, protecting him. He began climbing once more.
<br><br>
With astonishing speed, he drew near to the top of the mountain, where the nest was located.
<br><br>
The six-headed eagle let out cries of rage and swooped towards Zen.
<br><br>
The female eagle was angrier than it had ever been, and six heads with their sharp beaks all pecked at Zen, determined to drive him away.
<br><br>
Zen lifted his right hand, while continuing to grip the wall with his left. He swung in the air and easily avoided the pecking of the six heads. At the same time, he stretched out his right arm towards the eagle.
<br><br>
He slashed downwards four times.
<br><br>
His attack sliced through the necks of the six-headed eagle, and four heads were cut off, tumbling into the nest. The corrosive saliva in their decapitated heads flowed from their open beaks and melted large holes into the nest.
<br><br>
The female eagle wailed with pain.
<br><br>
Badly injured, it flew up into the sky, circling the nest from a distance.
<br><br>
As long as one of its heads remained unharmed, the eagle would stay alive; but if both of the remaining two heads were cut off, then it would die.
<br><br>
With extreme grief and indignation, it gave up on its nest, deciding to flee the scene. However, at that moment, the male eagle returned carrying a Black Teeth Swallow. After it had caught and killed the swallow, the male eagle had planned to bring the food back to share with the female eagle at the nest. It had never imagined that any creature would dare to break into their nest.
<br><br>
It hooted loudly as it saw the injured state of the female eagle.
<br><br>
The female eagle called out mournfully, gliding as close as it could to the nest while staying out of reach of Zen's attacks.
<br><br>
For several moments, the two six-headed eagles communicated with each other midair. Then the male eagle flew towards the nest, its eyes burning with anger.
<br><br>
The six-headed eagles were notoriously irritable, so others didn't dare provoke them. They not only attacked immediately, they were vengeful creatures that plundered everywhere when they were enraged. A six-headed eagle would never forgive or forget a creature that had invaded its nest.
<br><br>
The eagle sliced through the air as it swooped towards Zen.
<br><br>
Quickly it rose back up, circling in the air once, then swooped down on Zen again.
<br><br>
The only goal of the Treacherous Being was to overturn the pagoda mountain. If it hadn't been provoked first, it wouldn't have fought back.
<br><br>
After driving away the female eagle, the Treacherous Being was ready to topple down the pagoda mountain.
<br><br>
When the male eagle came about a hundred feet close to him, Zen immediately turned and jumped.
<br><br>
He soared through the air and landed on the back of the outraged eagle, who had been completely unprepared for that move. No one had ever even imagined getting so close to a six-headed eagle before.
<br><br>
Zen slashed his hand several times, creating an invisible force that was like a sharp sword cutting through the necks of the male eagle.
<br><br>
Five of its six necks were cut off, leaving only the last one still attached.
<br><br>
Zen had no intention of killing the eagle. Instead, as the eagle veered through the air, emitting cries of pain, he leaped from its back.
<br><br>
He grabbed onto the top of the mountain and slid down. As he moved, he suddenly pushed it.
<br><br>
There was a loud clicking sound, like a gear functioning, then the whole pagoda mountain swayed. Everyone stared as the mountain toppled sideways.
<br><br>
As the pagoda mountain fell to the ground, three bird eggs rolled out of the nest.
<br><br>
Although the eggs were thrown to the ground from tens of thousands of feet in the air, they were unharmed. Evidently, the eggs were very tough and resistant to damage.
<br><br>
The eggs rolled on the ground and came to a stop near the leader of the men in black robes.
<br><br>
The black-robed people were stunned by this sudden stroke of good fortune.
<br><br>
They stood motionless, staring at the precious eggs, hardly daring to breathe.
<br><br>
Chapter 4005 Les After five out of its six heads were all cut off, the male eagle was scared to death and tried to flee.
<br><br>
It didn't dare to attack Zen again and quickly flew high as it trembled.
<br><br>
Howl! The female eagle, which was also badly injured, rendezvoused with the male eagle and retreated with it.
<br><br>
As the pair of six-headed eagles battled with Zen, they had lost a total of nine heads.
<br><br>
They were still lucky that they survived even though facing such a powerful opponent. All their aggressiveness vanished, and they just wanted to save themselves right now.
<br><br>
As for the falling eggs, they didn't even have the time to look back and care about them.
<br><br>
Crash! As the six-headed eagles had already flown quite a distance, a bolt of dragon-shaped lightning suddenly surged down from the sky and assaulted them.
<br><br>
The six-headed eagles instantly turned into ashes, drifting away in the wind, as the dazzling lightning struck them.
<br><br>
When everyone saw the tremendous lightning, everyone on the mountain was taken aback. They knew that it wasn't natural lightning and that someone was responsible for it.
<br><br>
"Who the heck released such lightning of that caliber?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked with his brows furrowed.
<br><br>
The lightning contained irregular crystals, and the energy it emitted was devastating.
<br><br>
When Pearson saw the dragon-shaped lightning, his eyes widened and he felt that his throat became dry. There was a mixed emotion of fear and hatred written all over his face. "It must be Les, one of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization."
<br><br>
Les was such a formidable opponent. Back then, he led a team to surround and suppress a group of Eternal Realm Hunters, killing six of them in the process.
<br><br>
"Although he's a bit weaker than Claire, he enjoys the same status as her,"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess explained.
<br><br>
"Really? That guy's absolutely powerful then." Eastern Emperor Taiyi's expression changed a little as he realized the trouble that they were about to face.
<br><br>
The other people at the back of the Wing King also looked sullen.
<br><br>
Back when they were in the Source World, they managed to defeat Claire.
<br><br>
This was because the people of the Pear Hill and the Chaos Ancient Gods could fully display their strength. On the other hand, Claire's power was limited as she came with the Yellow Thearch's body.
<br><br>
Now that they were on the Other Shore, the situation was reversed. As a creature on the Other Shore, Les could readily use all of his strength, while the Eternal Realm masters would be the one with the handicap. Obviously, the gap between their strength would be so immense.
<br><br>
Worse, Zen was still under the control of the Treacherous Being, and they hadn't found a way to save him yet. It meant that they couldn't rely on his strength right now.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! Continuous bolts of lightning lashed down as if a creature made up of lightning was rapidly approaching.
<br><br>
Crash! A final bolt of lightning struck a nearby mountain. Immediately after, a transparent sphere appeared with Les floating within.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!" Les greeted them with a loud chuckle. "How dumb can you be? If you're here to save the trapped humans, then you've chosen the wrong path."
<br><br>
After Zen and his companions were saved by the Wing King back in the Grand Pure Realm, the Element Spirit Civilization tracked them through the Shadow Marks.
<br><br>
But after they entered the Whining Road, the Element Spirit Civilization had lost all their traces.
<br><br>
However, a few days later when they left the Whining Road, the Shadow Marks began sending out messages of their whereabouts again. With this, even with no Shadow Warriors tailing them, they could still estimate their location.
<br><br>
After a brief discussion with Claire and Slade, Les decided to take action and resolve the matter personally.
<br><br>
At first, Slade insisted on coming with Les, but he strongly refused.
<br><br>
Since Les had overwhelming power on the Other Shore, he had so much pride. Bringing Slade meant that countless warriors of the Element Spirit race would accompany him. He felt that it was an insult to his capabilities.
<br><br>
Claire, on the other hand, didn't say anything. She actually didn't like Les.
<br><br>
Since she had failed once before, now she was eager to see Les go alone and return in a crushing defeat.
<br><br>
It appeared that the Shadow Marks that Les were tracing were on the bodies of the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi. However, the moment that he saw Zen, his attention shifted to him and treated the rest of them as insignificant nuisances.
<br><br>
Apparently, Zen's current state wasn't that clear to Les. He thought that Zen would open the passage where the human heroes were trapped, but he had overturned the wrong mountains.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being that controlled Zen's body glanced coldly at Les before it began running towards the west again.
<br><br>
It was going to overturn another mountain.
<br><br>
Seeing the sudden movement of Zen's body, Les let out a smirk. 'Does this guy really want to play a game of tag with me?' Lightning flashed on the surface of his sphere as he started chasing after the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"Let's go! We also have to follow him!"
<br><br>
The Wing King flapped his wings and followed Les while carrying everyone on his back.
<br><br>
The men in black stayed where they were.
<br><br>
Three of them each held an egg in their arms. They decided to take them back first.
<br><br>
The eggs appeared translucent under the sunlight, making the dark-green liquid and the embryos of the six-headed eagles visible. The liquid contained in the eggs was extremely corrosive, so they had to be very careful in handling them. If they accidentally broke one, their bodies would surely be corroded.
<br><br>
"Father, let's go home," urged the son of the leader.
<br><br>
Although many of their clansmen had died in the process, they were still very lucky to obtain the eggs in the end.
<br><br>
The son was worried that if they stayed for too long, problems might start to arise.
<br><br>
"That human is very special," the leader said.
<br><br>
"But that's not a battle that we can participate in," the son of the leader answered calmly. "Father, please don't forget that this is the Light Region."
<br><br>
Their race was actually powerful.
<br><br>
After all, they had to possess sufficient strength to be able to gain a foothold in the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
However, they were unable to display the fullest of their abilities in the Light Region. They were like sharks stuck on the shore. No matter how powerful and sharp their teeth were, there was nothing they could do as they faced the six-headed eagles.
<br><br>
"I still want to know more," the leader voiced out firmly. "After all, he saved us."
<br><br>
"I'm willing to follow you!"
<br><br>
"I'm glad to be of service!"
<br><br>
"Please take me with you, chief!"
<br><br>
Some of the people in black robes had also felt the same as their leader.
<br><br>
The leader was relieved. After selecting more than twenty men from their group, he led them quickly in the direction where Zen had gone. The remaining members returned to their home, led by the leader's son.
<br><br>
Crash! Another dragon-shaped lightning struck down and made a huge crater on the ground.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being was still controlling Zen's body. It continued to run fast without any intention of fighting Les. It just wanted to overturn the right mountain according to its original plan, but Les had been pestering it from behind all this time.
<br><br>
Eventually, Les noticed that there was something strange with the seemingly ordinary way of Zen's running. There was an odd bodily movement skill incorporated with it.
<br><br>
When Les employed his theurgy, Zen was absolutely shrouded in his lightning. However, just the next moment, he dashed out unharmed, as if his body and the lightning were in two different dimensions.
<br><br>
This made Les rather confused. He tried to think and come up with an explanation.
<br><br>
However, he hadn't seen this kind of theurgy from Zen before.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! Crash! Boom! Les released four immense lightning strikes in a row, but the result was still the same.
<br><br>
He clearly saw that Zen's figure had entered the field of lightning, but he wasn't able to sense Zen's existence at all.
<br><br>
"What kind of strange ability is that?!" Les yelled in frustration. "Let's see how you dodge this one!"
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the transparent sphere of Les suddenly appeared above Zen's head.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The surface of the transparent sphere began to flash with five-colored bolts of lightning. The red, green, purple, black, and blue bolts of lightning appeared like small serpents that tried to envelop Zen's head.
<br><br>
Chapter 4006 Thunder Array Buzz! Upon seeing that the colorful bolts of lightning were coming down to envelop him, Zen suddenly stopped on his tracks and evaded the lightning cage. Then, he leaped and landed on the transparent sphere.
<br><br>
Through Zen's eyes, the Treacherous Being intently looked inside the transparent sphere.
<br><br>
Les, who was inside, clearly saw Zen's face on the surface of the sphere.
<br><br>
The sight was quite strange to him as he saw Zen stared at him with only the white of his eyes.
<br><br>
It was kind of creepy since Zen's face didn't contain any shred of emotion as he stared and tried to pry inside Les's mind.
<br><br>
A sense of discomfort quickly rose from Les's heart, which was caused by the unique aura of the Treacherous Being. However, at this moment, Les still didn't know that Zen's body was being possessed.
<br><br>
"Fuck off, you creepy bastard!"
<br><br>
Les immediately stretched out his hand and gathered his energy on the surface of the sphere.
<br><br>
Crack! A bolt of lightning burst out from the spot where Zen was attached. The power of the lightning was enough to pierce through him and send him into the air.
<br><br>
However, Zen's body was extremely agile, like a nimble monkey. He easily dodged the lightning and leaped to the other side of the sphere. He landed and clung to the surface with both his hands and feet, and started staring at Les again with his white eyes.
<br><br>
At this point, Zen knew that the Treacherous Being seemed to be very interested in Les.
<br><br>
"I said fuck off!"
<br><br>
Les stretched out his hand again and released another streak of lightning on the surface of the sphere.
<br><br>
Zen still avoided his attack with ease and flew back.
<br><br>
Crack! Boom! Les tried to drive Zen off several times, but he failed miserably.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Finally, he got totally impatient so he wrapped the entire transparent sphere with the colorful lightning. With this, Zen would have no choice but to separate himself from the sphere.
<br><br>
However, the Treacherous Being still manipulated Zen's body to cling onto the sphere.
<br><br>
The moment Zen's hands and feet landed on the sphere, the colorful lightning enveloping it immediately burned them.
<br><br>
Zen's current physical body had been strengthened by the ancestry-level bloodline, thus ordinary methods could not easily hurt him. However, Les's skills were superb and couldn't be underestimated.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being looked at the burnt hands and feet of Zen.
<br><br>
As it realized that the body it was possessing was injured, it decided to use its own body to wrap around the injured parts.
<br><br>
However, even before the Treacherous Being could make its move, round blisters suddenly appeared on the surface of Zen's burnt hands and feet.
<br><br>
After the blisters were broken, a green liquid flowed out from them. Then, the liquid entered through the burnt parts and quickly healed them. As they fully recovered, Zen's hands and feet revealed a faint metallic color.
<br><br>
The colorful lightning hit Zen's metal hands and feet again, but this time, it could no longer damage him.
<br><br>
For the first time, Zen's manipulated body revealed a strange expression in his white eyes.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being inside his body was just acting according it subconscious.
<br><br>
It meant that all this time, its consciousness had not been completely awakened.
<br><br>
With just its instinct, the Treacherous Being knew where it needed to go. It also discerned that it had to repel all the creatures that would try to hinder it. However, it still couldn't remember who it really was and what its true goal and purpose were.
<br><br>
But now that the Treacherous Being had begun to show its expressions, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zen were surprised.
<br><br>
Previously, the ancestry-level bloodline stopped working as if it was dead.
<br><br>
It was also unwilling to drive the Treacherous Being out of Zen's body.
<br><br>
However, when his body suffered fatal damages, it immediately repaired them.
<br><br>
"I've been thinking about this for a while now. It seems that the Treacherous Being is very interested in Les," Zen told the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Indeed. I noticed that too," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied.
<br><br>
At this moment, the Treacherous Being still controlled Zen's body to cling onto the surface of the transparent sphere, and no one knew what it was really up to.
<br><br>
Now, the Treacherous Being had grown impatient. It thought that just spying wasn't enough to quench its interest for Les. Thus, it quickly controlled Zen's body and threw a punch on the sphere.
<br><br>
If it wanted to kill Les, it had to break the transparent sphere first to get to him.
<br><br>
Boom! The strength of the punch was massive. However, the sphere was only slightly shaken and was able to easily repel his punch.
<br><br>
Crash! With that, the Treacherous Being threw another massive punch.
<br><br>
This time, the punch came directly from above, like meteor that crashed from the sky. The impact didn't destroy the sphere, but it was strong enough to instantly embed it into the ground.
<br><br>
As Les found that he was stuck on the ground, his face was quickly filled with rage. He did not expect that a mere human could do this to him.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Zen's body seemed to have gone insane. He wreaked havoc by continuously throwing massive punches towards the transparent sphere of light.
<br><br>
Inside the sphere, there was a cubic gray stone, the size of a thumb, hanging just beside Les's body. Every time Zen smashed the sphere, the gray stone would flash a faint luster.
<br><br>
Apparently, the energy of the transparent sphere came from this stone. Once all the energy of the stone was exhausted, the sphere would also collapse.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Claire and Slade had been quietly watching this scene.
<br><br>
Slade was constantly shaking his head since he saw that Les couldn't even hit Zen with his lightning. But now that Zen seemed to have been overpowering Les, he had enough.
<br><br>
"This is ridiculous. Les has underestimated the enemy," said Slade.
<br><br>
"Well, I already expected this. He's always like this, so full of himself,"
<br><br>
Claire said with a subtle smile on her face.
<br><br>
"His enemy is just a mere human. How could he be overwhelmed like that? What a loser! I want to replace him," Slade demanded.
<br><br>
Before, whenever Slade would speak, there would be no emotion involved because there were many members of the Element Spirit race that dwelled within his body. Every word that he would say was agreed upon by the collective consciousness of the members of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
But now, his way of speaking had totally changed. Obviously, there was a lone member of the Element Spirit race that was speaking these words.
<br><br>
"Is that you, Gavyn?" Claire smiled as she noticed it immediately.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, you can't just replace him. The Eye Spirit won't let you out unless Les is killed." Claire added.
<br><br>
The strength of the members of the Element Spirit race inside Slade greatly varied. There were weak ones, which were the average members, but there were also powerful ones, which included Gavyn.
<br><br>
"Tch. Then I hope that happens for real," Gavyn said through Slade's body.
<br><br>
However, although they were seeing that Les was in a bad situation, they didn't think that he would actually lose, let alone die.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Zen had already thrown more than twenty massive punches in rapid succession. The cubic stone hanging beside Les had started dimming, and a thin crack appeared on its surface. Soon after, the transparent sphere burst into pieces with a loud bang.
<br><br>
However, Les was just actually waiting for that exact moment to launch his counterattack.
<br><br>
He suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Zen's neck. "I must congratulate you for breaking through my protective shield. Now, have a taste of my true strength! Thunder Crack!"
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! Suddenly, countless thunderbolts poured from the sky.
<br><br>
Several bolts of lightning struck the top of the mountains, forming circles of lightning.
<br><br>
Each pagoda mountain had a circle of lightning on the top and there were probably millions of them that were simultaneously formed in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.
<br><br>
Then, the circular lightning bolts connected to each other, forming a huge Thunder Array.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The Thunder Array continued to descend, destroying the surface of the mountains. Soon, the mountains revealed a kind of metallic color.
<br><br>
"Watch out!"
<br><br>
"Avoid the bolts of lightning!"
<br><br>
"Stay away from the mountains!"
<br><br>
The Wing King and the others on his back, together with the men in black robes closely behind, began to disperse and dodge the horrendous bolts of lightning surging down from the sky The two groups met again at such an unfavorable situation. They maintained a certain distance and closely watched at the developing scene.
<br><br>
"Array Hold!" Les mightily roared as he soared in the sky.
<br><br>
Right at that moment, all the bolts of lightning contained in the humongous Thunder Array began to gather in Les's right hand.
<br><br>
Chapter 4007 Hostility Level Les's right hand flashed with bolts of lightning as he held onto Zen's neck tightly.
<br><br>
In the huge Thunder Array, whenever the countless flashes of lightning were squeezed together, they melted into a grey liquid.
<br><br>
Anything thrown into the liquefied lightning would instantly melt and disappear without a trace.
<br><br>
Under the attack of the liquid lightning, Zen's body instantly reacted. Round blisters formed on his skin once more, oozing with a green viscous liquid.
<br><br>
In defense, Zen's skin formed a layer of metal to protect himself.
<br><br>
This layer of metal completely isolated the lightning from the outside.
<br><br>
"Humph!"
<br><br>
Les snorted.
<br><br>
Then, the energy in the whole Thunder Array intensified and whirled around faster.
<br><br>
In the liquid lightning that gathered, there were many small triangles wrapped in it. These triangles ground and drilled on the surface of Zen's body. Cracks began to appear on Zen's skin which glowed with metallic luster. His skin was gradually broken.
<br><br>
"Even the ancestry-level bloodline can't resist them?" Zen cried in shock.
<br><br>
After all, from the moment he obtained the ancestry-level bloodline, Zen saw infinite possibilities in it, and every possibility would be invincible.
<br><br>
Zen was surprised, but so was Les.
<br><br>
He had had no idea how Zen formed a layer of metal on his skin, neither did he know what exactly that metal was. He just knew that his lightning lost its effect on Zen the minute it appeared.
<br><br>
In order to break Zen's physical body, he had no choice but to use Thunder Crystal Fragments.
<br><br>
A Thunder Crystal Fragment was the hardest material in the world. As they continued drilling on Zen's skin, they finally breached past the metal layer and into Zen's body. A smile crept on Les's face when he saw his plan was working.
<br><br>
With the help of the Thunder Crystal Fragments, he was able to grind Zen into powders.
<br><br>
Just when Les thought he had the upper hand, a white mass suddenly oozed out of Zen's wounds. It had a strange-looking mouth and hollow eyes, which stared into Les's.
<br><br>
"This is..." Les's eyes widened slightly.
<br><br>
It finally dawned on him why he had had such an unpleasant feeling.
<br><br>
It was a Treacherous Being! This guy was possessed by a Treacherous Being! As one of members that held high position in the Element Spirit Civilization, Les knew much more about the Treacherous Beings than ordinary people. As a result, he was fully aware of how terrifying it was to be in this situation.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the Treacherous Being came out, two white hands encircled Les.
<br><br>
"Hissss..."
<br><br>
After the two hands twined around Les's body, a white film was formed, tightly enveloping him.
<br><br>
Les's eyes darted back and forth, watching helplessly as he was being cocooned. Panic seized his heart.
<br><br>
Desperately, he activated the Thunder Crystal Fragments once more to try to break free from the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
The Thunder Crystal Fragments were his trump card. To his horror, it had no effect on the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Try as they might, those tiny triangular fragments couldn't even make a crack on the white film.
<br><br>
"Coo, coo."
<br><br>
Les trembled at the creepy sounds. Then, a pair of hollow eyes emerged on the surface of the white film that enveloped Les. The strange-looking mouth appeared too, cracking an unsettling smile.
<br><br>
Then the white film began to tighten gradually, squeezing Les little by little.
<br><br>
From the other side, Claire and Slade both cried out in horror when they saw the Treacherous Being emerge.
<br><br>
Who would have known Zen ended up getting possessed by a Treacherous Being when he passed through the Whining Road? "It's a white hostility-level Treacherous Being, one of those on the Whining Road," Claire said. "I wonder if Les will survive..."
<br><br>
Although Claire had teased Les playfully, she was under the impression he'd make it back alive. Now that the situation had taken a turn for the worse, she was a bit worried.
<br><br>
"Well, too bad for him," Gavyn said with a smile. He was hoping Les would die, so that he could take his place.
<br><br>
As members of the Element Spirit race, they had stayed on the Three Purities Stage for a long time and they knew more about the Treacherous Beings than ordinary Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
These Treacherous Beings were special spirits that were categorized into three levels: the hostility-level, the resentment-level and the hatred-level.
<br><br>
The hostility-level was the lowest level among the three. Treacherous Beings at this level usually gathered in a fixed position, and they would act according to their own goals. They normally were not aggressive, unless someone provoked them or aroused their interest.
<br><br>
Judging from the events that were unfolding, this Treacherous Being in particular was just acting in defense.
<br><br>
However, once Zen lay prone on the transparent ball, the Treacherous Being obviously took an interest in Les.
<br><br>
So the reasons why it attacked Les might be both to defend itself and destroy Les.
<br><br>
"Goo..."
<br><br>
The white film continued to shrink, and the strange face on the white film was deformed because of the shrink, making it look even more grotesque.
<br><br>
Originally Les stood fifty feet tall, but the white film shrunk him down to twenty feet, then ten, five...
<br><br>
Les was a thunder spirit, but he had maintained his current form for countless years. Now that his body was being forcefully compressed by the white film, it ultimately collapsed.
<br><br>
Even though Les's body had already broken down at this point, the white film showed no signs of stopping. In fact, it began to shrink even faster.
<br><br>
Three feet...
<br><br>
One foot...
<br><br>
Five inches...
<br><br>
Three inches...
<br><br>
By now, the white film was nothing but a speck. Of course, the creepy face was gone, too.
<br><br>
Upon a closer look, however, the white film was now a tiny cube.
<br><br>
When Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven stared at this cube, they felt strange. Was it possible that Les had turned into a cube from being squished? Soon, however, they figured it out.
<br><br>
When the white film was slowly shrinking, a small cubic stone was spat out. There were some cracks on it.
<br><br>
Previously, the energy of Les's transparent light ball came from this small cubic stone. After being hit by Zen again and again, the energy in the stone was exhausted, and the transparent light ball that served as a shield naturally collapsed.
<br><br>
Everything disappeared under the compression of the white form, except for the small cubic stone.
<br><br>
"I get it," the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly said. "Previously, when the Treacherous Being had manipulated your body to cling onto the transparent ball of light, it wasn't looking at Les but at the cubic stone beside him. It has taken a fancy to this thing..."
<br><br>
"What's the use of this stone?" Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Of course, only something extraordinary would arouse the interest of a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"Coo, coo, coo..."
<br><br>
Whatever remained of the white film suddenly melted into a puddle of murky white water which flowed until it formed the shape of the Treacherous Being. Its unsettling face emerged once more. This time, its smile was even wider and creepier than ever.
<br><br>
Then, it howled...
<br><br>
These howls were so shrill, everyone who had the misfortune of being within earshot winced in severe pain.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Wing King and the other warriors with him, as well as the men in black didn't have the time to clamp their ears shut, so they all buckled under the sound of the Treacherous Being's howls.
<br><br>
Fortunately, this didn't last long.
<br><br>
After a while, the howls stopped. The part of the Treacherous Being that was outside Zen's body slowly returned, along with the small, cubic stone.
<br><br>
Because Zen had no control over his body, he didn't feel a thing when the cubic stone entered his body.
<br><br>
Chapter 4008 Go Deep Into The Freezing Wilderness After the cubic stone was stuffed into Zen's body, the remaining white film left outside his body split open.
<br><br>
A ray of blue light flashed from the white film. It was a bolt of lightning almost the size of a thumb.
<br><br>
It was the real body of Les.
<br><br>
Les' figure had also shrunk. As the Treacherous Being had powerful strength, it wouldn't take much effort to kill Les.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that the Treacherous Being had no intent to kill Les. It started to place the remaining white film back onto Zen's body and left.
<br><br>
The thumb-sized Les paused for a moment in surprise–he didn't expect that the Treacherous Being would let him go. He then realized that it was not a safe place.
<br><br>
His strength had extremely weakened. Any Eternal Realm warrior could kill him now! Crack! Les flew fast; he quickly turned into a bolt of lightning and disappeared before everyone's eyes.
<br><br>
Zen's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes widened when they saw Les escape safely.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being was never a kind creature. Why would it let off Les? "The Treacherous Being strangely took action from the very beginning.
<br><br>
Let's wait for the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher the words it has uttered," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
When it obtained the cubic stone, the Treacherous Being let out a howl. The howl sounded like a low reciting voice to Zen's ears. Zen never missed the Treacherous Being's words. He quickly sent this recitation sound into his inner world, asking the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher it.
<br><br>
Perhaps because the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been accustomed to the characteristics of the Treacherous Being's language, or because the sentence was short, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization quickly answered, "It said the stone is called the Holy Stone."
<br><br>
"Holy Stone?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven thought for a moment. "I've never heard of such a stone." He shook his head.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, Zen said, "The stones used to make the ground and pillars of the Eternal Divine Courtyard are closely similar to that cubic stone, but I can't tell whether they're related or not."
<br><br>
Some things looked the same, but their actual uses were different. Zen could only tell them his guess.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, what triggered the Treacherous Being must be something extraordinary.
<br><br>
From its strange behavior at the beginning, its target seemed not to be Les, but this stone. It just took a chance to punish Les as well.
<br><br>
As the Treacherous Being advanced for hundreds of miles, Wing King, his group, and the men in black robes also followed it.
<br><br>
When it pushed down another pagoda mountain, a series of tremors suddenly arose from the ground. The tremors intensely spread east to the far distance.
<br><br>
"It really opened a passage..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in shock.
<br><br>
Their knowledge about the Other Shore, especially about the Supreme Pure Realm, had not been updated since the 78th chaotic era. The Primeval Lord of Heaven had never communicated with the Eternal Realm Hunters before.
<br><br>
"I predicted that it would be like this. Entering the Jade Pure Realm through that passage was only a dream for you," the Snake Goddess uttered in a low voice.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had thought he would be able to enter the Jade Pure Realm through the passage, but now it just seemed to be wishful thinking...
<br><br>
It might not be easy to enter the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
"Which passage has the Treacherous Being opened?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Let's wait and see," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered.
<br><br>
"The problem is how I can take my body back," Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven seemed to be even more interested in the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being controlled Zen's body to run all the way west, dashing past many pagoda mountains.
<br><br>
As it stepped further into the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, it approached a snowy land. It was the Freezing Wilderness on the west of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being became much more agile after opening the passage.
<br><br>
It was sure of the direction it accelerated in and stepped into the Freezing Wilderness without any hesitation.
<br><br>
The Freezing Wilderness was covered with white, beautiful snow.
<br><br>
Many kinds of Other Shore creatures had hidden in its seemingly lifeless territory.
<br><br>
As soon as the Treacherous Being flew a distance, a fist-sized Evil Shortbeaked Sparrow emerged from the thick snow. The number of the Evil Short-beaked Sparrows was extremely large, and they liked to attack their targets in groups.
<br><br>
The Evil Short-beaked Sparrows let out a series of chirps, as if calling out to many flocks.
<br><br>
Tens of thousands of Evil Short-beaked Sparrows then came out of the snow land.
<br><br>
The white Evil Short-beaked Sparrows looked like the snowstorm as they swept towards their prey.
<br><br>
With the terrifying attack of the Evil Short-beaked Sparrows, ordinary Other Shore creatures could be bitten to death in only three to six seconds.
<br><br>
This time, the situation was beyond the expectations of the Evil Shortbeaked Sparrows. When all the Evil Short-beaked Sparrows came to only three feet away from their prey, a strange force had split them in half.
<br><br>
The first one was killed in an instant, up until the 10, 000th one...
<br><br>
Puff, puff, puff...
<br><br>
The Evil Short-beaked Sparrows had now turned into a rain of scarlet blood falling on the snow of the Freezing Wilderness, leaving behind a bloody trail.
<br><br>
The Wing King was following behind unhurriedly. When Pearson saw the scene, he was also amazed. "The Treacherous Being's power is really frightening. The Freezing Wilderness is even more dangerous than the Blood Swamp. It's only safe to follow Zen..."
<br><br>
"The men in black robes are still following us. I don't know what they are planning to do. Should we communicate with them?" Fuxi asked, pointing behind them.
<br><br>
Although the men in black robes did not show any hostility, Fuxi felt uneasy upon seeing them follow.
<br><br>
"Let me do it," the Snake Goddess insisted. She turned around and glanced back at the men in black robes. "Who are you? Why have you been following us?" she asked through her life vitality.
<br><br>
The leader of the men in black robes hesitated at first. After all, it was not a good idea to follow them all the way. When he heard the voice, he replied, "We are from the Night Being race. We bring no harm. We are here to help."
<br><br>
"The Night Being race?" the Snake Goddess asked as she had never heard of this race.
<br><br>
Pearson's eyes flashed. "They are a race living in the Dark Region and they have a similar appearance to human beings. They have been staying in the Dark Region. Their bodies are pale and colorless, and their hair is as white as snow. They are considered a powerful race."
<br><br>
Even without Pearson's description, one could tell their figures according to their thick robes.
<br><br>
"Why do you want to help us?" the Snake Goddess asked again.
<br><br>
"The eggs of the six-headed eagles are of great importance to us.
<br><br>
Previously, dozens of our members have died for them. Thanks to our benefactor, we obtained the eggs," the leader of the Night Being race replied.
<br><br>
The Wing King and his group also saw the members of the Night Being race taking away the eggs. They didn't expect these eggs to be of so much importance to this race.
<br><br>
Of course, the Snake Goddess knew that the "benefactor" the leader mentioned was Zen.
<br><br>
"There's no need for help here. You can go back now," the Snake Goddess coldly said.
<br><br>
The situation was complicated. She didn't want such an unknown alien race to get involved. It was impossible to determine if they had evil intentions just by a few words.
<br><br>
The leader of the Night Being race suddenly replied, "I know that our benefactor's body is possessed by the Treacherous Being. Although the hostility-level Treacherous Being is very powerful, it lacks self-awareness.
<br><br>
Thus, it is possible to get rid of it."
<br><br>
Chapter 4009 A Place With No Turning Back As the Snake Goddess heard the words of the leader of the Night Being race, she gasped in shock.
<br><br>
Seeing her reaction, everyone grew curious. What could the leader have said to make her react like this? "What did they say?" asked Fuxi.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess blinked a few times before she spoke, "They said they had a way to help Zen get rid of the Treacherous Being."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin and King Ieuan were taken aback by her response.
<br><br>
"Even if they could deal with the Treacherous Being, why would they do that?" Pearson asked.
<br><br>
The creatures in the Three Purities Stage had their positions. However, no one knew what the Night Being race was up to. This made Pearson even more cautious with them.
<br><br>
"He said that Zen helped them retrieve the six-headed eagles' eggs, so he wanted to repay him," the Snake Goddess explained.
<br><br>
Pearson shook his head. "They did take the eggs, and the eggs are rare, but this reason just sounds so far-fetched at this point."
<br><br>
"I agree," King Ieuan echoed with a nod.
<br><br>
Hearing their discussion, the Snake Goddess remained silent to think it through.
<br><br>
Their problem was tricky. If they couldn't drive the Treacherous Being out of Zen's body, it would be meaningless to follow him. However, if they acted rashly, they'd only be faced with deaths.
<br><br>
Everyone on the Wing King's back grew silent and hesitant.
<br><br>
"I'll grow bigger and let them join us," suddenly said the Wing King. "We can choose to believe them."
<br><br>
Pearson frowned. "Why do you believe them?"
<br><br>
"Because we have no other choice," the Wing King said sternly.
<br><br>
Compared to the three Eternal Realm Hunters, the ones present knew better Zen's importance to the group.
<br><br>
They could lose anyone, except Zen.
<br><br>
"You're right," Fuxi agreed.
<br><br>
"Anyway, I'm afraid we have no point of retreat," said King Ieuan.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess smiled lightly at the leader of the Night Being race and said, "I believe you. You can come up."
<br><br>
As soon as the leader received her message, the Wing King's body flashed with a light and expanded drastically as he transformed into a huge Regal Jade eagle.
<br><br>
Although the Night Being race could catch up with the Wing King's speed, it would still be challenging. When the Wing King slowed down, they took this as an opportunity and jumped upon his back.
<br><br>
Even though the Wing King invited them, they maintained a certain distance.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and her group stood at the base of the left wing, while the people of the Night Being race stayed on the right.
<br><br>
"Do you really have a way to kill the Treacherous Being? Squeak!" King Ieuan asked hastily.
<br><br>
The leader of the Night Being race shook his head in response. "They cannot be killed. Even the Element Spirit Civilization couldn't kill them, what more could we do? But we still have a way to expel the one from Zen's body so he is freed from possession."
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes widened in excitement as they heard this.
<br><br>
"If you can expel the Treacherous Being, we would be indebted to you," the Snake Goddess said as she cupped her hands towards the leader of the Night Being race. "You also mentioned it was a hostility-level Treacherous Being. Does this mean that Treacherous Beings have different levels?"
<br><br>
The leader nodded. "Yes, there are different levels. Although the Treacherous Beings are indestructible, their strength is still divided among levels. The levels were determined by the Element Spirit Civilization. The weakest is the hostility level, followed by the resentment level, and topped by the strongest hatred level."
<br><br>
"Even if the Treacherous Being is powerful, it is at the weakest hostility level," sighed Eastern Emperor Taiyi. "How strong is the strongest hatred level?"
<br><br>
An expression of defeat washed over Pearson's face. "The Treacherous Being that eliminated the Primal Tiger race should be at the hatred level."
<br><br>
Although the Eternal Realm Hunters were well-informed, they did not live in the Supreme Pure Realm. This kept them unfamiliar with the levels of the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
However, the leader of the Night Being race shook his head in disapproval.
<br><br>
"That Treacherous Being is not at the hatred level. It is at the resentment level at most."
<br><br>
The people who heard this gasped in shock. Likewise, the faces of Pearson, Thurston, and Sawyer also shifted. Pearson asked, "The Treacherous Being at the resentment level is already so powerful. How much stronger could those at the hatred level be?"
<br><br>
"I don't know. The levels were determined by the Element Spirit Civilization," the leader responded. "Nobody knows whether a Treacherous Being at the hatred level exists or not. I haven't heard of or seen one before."
<br><br>
"We need to catch up with Zen and expel the damn thing," said Yasamin.
<br><br>
However, the leader of the Night Being race waved his hand against it. "We are in no rush. If we take action right now, the Treacherous Being will come for us. All Treacherous Beings have strong will. We must attack it when its will weakens."
<br><br>
What he said was reasonable, which calmed down everyone. They patiently waited to see when Zen would stop.
<br><br>
The Freezing Wilderness spread over a large area.
<br><br>
At this time, every inch of it was covered in pure white snow.
<br><br>
Occasionally, blood could be seen gushing and spraying in the air as the Treacherous Being killed roaming creatures.
<br><br>
At around two thousand miles, the coverage of snow diverted into a large area of wilderness.
<br><br>
No one knew how far the wilderness stretched out. It seemed unending.
<br><br>
"It seems we have arrived at the end of the Freezing Wilderness," Pearson pointed out.
<br><br>
"So the Treacherous Being doesn't aim at the Freezing Wilderness? But the wilderness ahead?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi clarified.
<br><br>
"How is this possible? The wilderness is the same as the plain in the Grand Pure Realm. Once we've entered, there's no going back. We cannot go over this snow line," Pearson said as he pointed towards the line.
<br><br>
Everyone's expression shifted to worry once again.
<br><br>
"Will the Treacherous Being manipulate Zen to go over there?" King Ieuan asked as its thin tail swung restlessly behind it.
<br><br>
"Who knows?"
<br><br>
At this point, Zen was only three miles away from the snow line.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Just then, two Snow Scale Dragons emerged from the snow and rushed towards Zen.
<br><br>
Under the Treacherous Being's control, Zen flashed, rushed towards the snow line and stepped into the wilderness.
<br><br>
The two Snow Scale Dragons tailed Zen, and they had already opened their big mouths. Seeing that Zen went beyond the snow line, they suddenly stopped and immediately retreated.
<br><br>
Although the Snow Scale Dragons were not intelligent, they were not going to cross the line by all means.
<br><br>
They looked at Zen with pity. This guy was dead meat.
<br><br>
Everyone on the Wing King's back sank into defeat once again.
<br><br>
No one had expected this.
<br><br>
"Beyond the snow line, one cannot turn back. I didn't expect that the Treacherous Being would take him there," the leader of the Night Being race sighed.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess observed Zen's receding figure. "It took the Treacherous Being so much effort to open up a path in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. This path can't just be a dead end."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" King Ieuan asked.
<br><br>
"Follow him in," the Snake Goddess ordered.
<br><br>
Chapter 4010 Holy Wings Armor "It's too dangerous to enter the wilderness so recklessly," Pearson immediately remarked.
<br><br>
Thurston and Sawyer nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
It was far beyond dangerous.
<br><br>
To enter the wilderness carelessly was to gamble one's very life.
<br><br>
While the three Eternal Realm Hunters were willing to follow Zen, that didn't mean they were willing to risk their lives for him.
<br><br>
Looking at Pearson with her eyes full of determination, the Snake Goddess said, "Of course, I won't be forcing anyone here to come along. I will enter first."
<br><br>
It was a place of no return. As the name suggested, after one crossed the snow line, it was impossible to look back, let alone retreat.
<br><br>
If the Snake Goddess managed to remain safe and sound in her attempt, the others' worries would be alleviated.
<br><br>
"I'll go with you," Fuxi said.
<br><br>
"Okay." The Snake Goddess nodded.
<br><br>
The two Pear Hill leaders had a clear understanding of the current situation.
<br><br>
If they really failed, then everything would be destroyed. They would die anyway—if they didn't try now, they could only live a while longer.
<br><br>
To the Eternal Realm warriors that had lived for countless years, the period was merely a fleeting moment. It didn't mean much to them.
<br><br>
"I'll help you kill the two Snow Scale Dragons," said Pearson.
<br><br>
They were hidden in the snow, revealing a pair of small eyes, greedily staring at the group of people above. If Fuxi and the Snake Goddess went down, they'd definitely fall under attack.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
Jumping off the Wing King's back, Pearson rushed toward the two Snow Scale Dragons.
<br><br>
When the two Snow Scale Dragons saw their prey approaching, their eyes flashed with greed as they rushed out of the snow with their jaws open wide.
<br><br>
When Pearson reached the Snow Scale Dragons, his body suddenly transformed into thin threads that wrapped around them.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Simultaneously, Thurston and Sawyer summoned the Black Sun once again.
<br><br>
Under its strong force of attraction, the two Snow Scale Dragons had no chance to resist—they were sucked into the Black Sun.
<br><br>
"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."
<br><br>
Pearson's body was outlined with thin threads before returning to its original form.
<br><br>
When the people in black robes saw how the three Eternal Realm Hunters cooperated with each other, they exclaimed in admiration. Truly, the cooperation between the three of them was perfect.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess didn't hesitate about their plan—they didn't even offer any last words to the others.
<br><br>
The two of them moved quickly, arriving at the snow line.
<br><br>
The thick snow stopped there, forming a low snow slope. Under the slope lay a barren wasteland.
<br><br>
When the two stood on the slope, they could still see Zen's receding figure.
<br><br>
They exchanged glances without any hint of fear in their eyes and entered where Zen had stepped through.
<br><br>
After crossing the snow line, the two took a few steps toward the wilderness.
<br><br>
On the Wing King's back, the people watched their every move.
<br><br>
'Can they turn around?' 'God bless them…' 'Please don't let this be a dead-end!' They all prayed fervently in their hearts.
<br><br>
Then, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess turned around, almost in sync, and smiled faintly.
<br><br>
Fuxi even stepped back on the snow line and said, "There is a road inside. It should be safe. Don't worry, everyone!"
<br><br>
And so he entered the wilderness once again, moving back and forth between the two areas' boundaries.
<br><br>
In the wilderness, the road was a stark contrast against the surrounding soil in color, but no one could see it from where they stood on the snow land— they had to enter the wilderness to figure it out.
<br><br>
"I'll go and have a look!"
<br><br>
Taking a small leap, Eastern Emperor Taiyi followed suit and crossed the line, landing into the wilderness, his movements as light as a swallow's.
<br><br>
There, he looked down to find the path with a slightly dark color extending a far distance, and Zen walked on the far end of it.
<br><br>
Seeing how the several warriors could enter and leave freely, the three Eternal Realm Hunters let go of their psychological burden and decided to enter as well.
<br><br>
If it wasn't actually a death trap, they were quite willing to see what was out there and offer their help.
<br><br>
The men clad in black robes took some time to discuss and reach an agreement. Then, they silently crossed the snow line as well.
<br><br>
In the end, only the Wing King remained in the air. His body suddenly shrank tenfold, down to ten feet in height, before he crossed the snow line and entered the wilderness.
<br><br>
Once he did, the Snake Goddess turned around and headed back to the line, stopping to stare at it for a moment.
<br><br>
Her fingers trembled slightly, making two crimson energy beams shoot out.
<br><br>
With a sudden swing of her arms, the two beams detached from her and shot rapidly along the snow line on her two sides.
<br><br>
Once thirty miles of the snow line on each side was destroyed by the beams, the Snake Goddess simply turned and left.
<br><br>
Soon after… Two transparent balls of light floated over from the vast snow land.
<br><br>
Inside one of them floated a slender girl—she was none other than Claire.
<br><br>
In the other was a complete set of armor with six light wings gently dancing on its back—this was Slade.
<br><br>
"They disappeared from here," Claire said, pointing ahead.
<br><br>
"The snow line has been destroyed and we can't tell which path they've taken," Slade said, looking down.
<br><br>
Claire frowned in disbelief. "What a clumsy method they're using…they're trying to deceive us into thinking they've entered the Wilderness of No Return?"
<br><br>
Such was the name given to the place by the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
"Maybe they really have gone to the Wilderness of No Return. There's a road that opened up in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, after all," Slade concluded. He and the Snake Goddess seemed to have the same idea— every road that opened up in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains was unusual, so even the Wilderness of no Return likely had a road connected to it.
<br><br>
Much to his surprise, Claire looked at him mockingly as she said, "I think we should let Gavyn control the Holy Wings Armor. Let all the members come out. They must be hiding in the snow land. We must find them, even if that means turning the entire land upside down!"
<br><br>
Claire's remark made Slade fall silent.
<br><br>
Strictly speaking, he held power greater than that of both Claire and Les, and his status was only second to that of the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
But there were still tens of thousands of members of the Element Spirit race inside Slade's body, each of them holding different opinions. Some believed that Zen and his group were hiding in the snow land, while others believed that they had broken into the Wilderness of No Return.
<br><br>
After a few seconds of silence, the discussion among the members of the Element Spirit race in his body turned into a fierce argument. Eventually, it ended with most people believing that Zen and the others with him were all hiding in the snow land. Then, all members of the Element Spirit race of various forms emerged from the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
Following Claire's orders, the members of the Element Spirit race began an inch-by-inch search across the snow land.
<br><br>
Two dots of gray light flashed on the Holy Wings Armor helmet—it was now being controlled by Gavyn alone.
<br><br>
"Thank you, Claire," he said in a clearly joyful tone.
<br><br>
She threw a casual glance at him before she said, "Les is seriously injured, but he refuses to die. If you really want to take control of the armor forever, you must perform well these days."
<br><br>
The armor held an important position in the Element Spirit Civilization. Not only was it a great honor to control it, but a manifestation of one's ability.
<br><br>
"How well should I behave?" Gavyn asked.
<br><br>
"Good enough that you can impress the Eye Spirit," Claire replied.
<br><br>
"Of course, I will!" He nodded firmly.
<br><br>
As the members of the Element Spirit race continued digging and turning over snow, some creatures were occasionally dug up, all of which were instantly killed.
<br><br>
From the looks of it, they weren't going to stop for anything until they found Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
Chapter 4011 The Fish Hook The path in the Wilderness of No Return was not a straight line but a crooked one extending to the end of the wilderness.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being manipulated Zen's body and walked slowly.
<br><br>
Everyone maintained a distance of about dozens of feet from Zen and followed him closely.
<br><br>
Dawn turned to dusk, and dusk turned to dawn, but Zen kept moving forward. He didn't express an intent to stop.
<br><br>
"How far have we moved?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
Fuxi had been counting the steps since they entered the wilderness. "About four hundred miles," he answered the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Walking over a few hundred miles for dozens of hours took so much of everyone's time.
<br><br>
"So we have left the Supreme Pure Realm and are about four hundred miles away." Pearson sighed.
<br><br>
No any scenery surrounded the wilderness. No matter how far they went, everything still looked the same.
<br><br>
Although they knew they could return any time, a trace of panic lingered deep in their hearts.
<br><br>
"Leaving the Supreme Pure Realm?" "That's right." The leader of the men in black robes nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
Although the Supreme Pure Realm was a large area, its extent was limited.
<br><br>
The Wilderness of No Return surrounding the Supreme Pure Realm obviously didn't belong to it.
<br><br>
"I don't know where we'll end up if we keep going like this. Squeak," said King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"The road doesn't go on forever." Eastern Emperor Taiyi shrugged, smiling optimistically.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess suddenly pointed and said, "Everyone, look to the side."
<br><br>
While everyone's eyes were fixed upfront, the Snake Goddess peripherally saw a black line from the side.
<br><br>
"What's that?" Pearson's eyes glared with curiosity.
<br><br>
After walking in the wilderness for too long, anything they saw made them cautious.
<br><br>
"I can't see it."
<br><br>
"The distance between it and us is too far..."
<br><br>
"I can't tell."
<br><br>
Everyone squinted into the distance but the black line was too far to be distinguished. From their view, it looked like a thin black snake lying on the ground.
<br><br>
"It's a river," the Wing King suddenly said behind the crowd.
<br><br>
"Can you see it clearly, Wing King? Squeak!" asked King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"Good eyesight!" Pearson commended.
<br><br>
They all thought the Wing King's eyesight was the best among them, but he shook his head and said, "Zen told me."
<br><br>
Zen was still communicating with the Wing King through the Civilization Artifact in his inner world. He could also see things through his eyes. His current eyesight far exceeded that of the group behind him.
<br><br>
"A river in the wilderness? Why is there a river?" the Snake Goddess asked with suspicion.
<br><br>
"Zen said it's the Divine River," Wing King continued.
<br><br>
When they heard this, the look on the crowd's faces changed with ease, but Pearson was lost in thought.
<br><br>
The place of origin of the Divine River was the Jade Pure Realm. The river flowed through the Supreme Pure Realm and the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
If they went upstream along the Divine River, they would reach the Jade Pure Realm, but no one had ever succeeded in getting to the Jade Pure Stage in this way.
<br><br>
"If one moves upstream along the Divine River in the Grand Pure Realm, they can reach the central plain of the Grand Pure Realm. That plain should be connected to the wilderness." Pearson suddenly came into conclusion.
<br><br>
"In other words, the boundless center of the Grand Pure Realm is connected to the extension of the Supreme Pure Realm," the Snake Goddess added.
<br><br>
Fuxi chuckled. "The person who designed the Three Purities Stage is indeed interesting."
<br><br>
As they walked, they discovered that the line of the Divine River converged from afar. It became more recognizable as they got closer and closer.
<br><br>
Splash, splash...
<br><br>
A sound of waves crashed from the Divine River while golden objects streamed along its waters.
<br><br>
"They are the Golden Bites," said King Ieuan.
<br><br>
These Golden Bites could devour anything that appeared along the river.
<br><br>
"If we can enter the Divine River here, I think we can collect many good items." Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes revealed a look of envy.
<br><br>
He had stayed in the Divine River for a long time and there was a fierce competition about the river in the Flaming Maple Forest. Now, no one was competing for the items of the Divine River; those who arrived first could take them first.
<br><br>
"I think you better give up this idea. We're most likely to be dead after we get out of this path," said Yasamin with a faint smile.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi shrugged. "Maybe this path intersects with the Divine River."
<br><br>
He had gained a lot of benefits from the Divine River and had also given a lot of help to many Holy Soul warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace. He hoped to go into the Divine River and obtain rare Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Just as Eastern Emperor Taiyi said, the Divine River was getting nearer to the path they were walking.
<br><br>
The shortest distance between the river and the path was only thirty feet.
<br><br>
While Eastern Emperor Taiyi was filled with expectation, the ground in front of him suddenly bulged.
<br><br>
Two copper trestles arched out from the ground, forcibly creating an entrance to a cave.
<br><br>
The material of the trestles was the same as that of the copper Myriad Pagoda Mountains. The passage that the Treacherous Being had opened was this cave.
<br><br>
"Do the mechanical devices at the bottom of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains extend all the way here?" King Ieuan asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"Of course not." Pearson disagreed. "If they did, wouldn't it be easy to find the passages by moving along the mechanical devices underground?"
<br><br>
"That's right..." King Ieuan nodded.
<br><br>
Zen walked to the front of the cave and paused. He suddenly turned his head and opened his mouth wide.
<br><br>
"It is going to howl again!"
<br><br>
Fuxi curled his lip and damaged his hearing to protect himself from the loud voice.
<br><br>
Everyone was deeply afraid of the howls from the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Before the Treacherous Being's wail could be heard, they had already taken action to damage their auditory senses. They deafened their ears in unison.
<br><br>
After wailing at the entrance of the cave, Zen quickly went inside.
<br><br>
The crowd proceeded to follow closely.
<br><br>
To their surprise, the cave was shallow. It took them only a hundred feet to reach its end.
<br><br>
Many fish hooks hung down at the end of the cave.
<br><br>
These fish hooks flickered conspicuously with light blue luster amid the darkness.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being was clever. It controlled Zen's body to jump up and bite one of the fish hooks.
<br><br>
Zen hung in the air, twisting while he pulled on the fish hook, like a fish biting onto a bait.
<br><br>
Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and those in the cave were puzzled.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a huge force came from above and dragged Zen to the darkness above the cave.
<br><br>
It was as if a fisherman had caught a fish...
<br><br>
"Zen has been caught!" King Ieuan exclaimed.
<br><br>
"This cave is only one hundred feet deep. According to the slope, it should be only about ten feet high. Why does the space above seem to be so large?" Fuxi asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"The space rules in the Three Purities Stage are chaotic. Let's follow them and have a look," the Snake Goddess said as she went to observe the fish hooks.
<br><br>
"Squeak, how do we get up there? Should we do the same as Zen did?"
<br><br>
asked King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"That's the only way."
<br><br>
As the Snake Goddess spoke, she jumped up and bit the fish hook that hung down from nowhere.
<br><br>
Waiting for a few moments after biting the fish hook, the Snake Goddess wasn't dragged upwards at all.
<br><br>
She could only twist her slender body as Zen did. She frowned and got morose when she suddenly felt a huge force from her mouth and was instantly dragged up.
<br><br>
Chapter 4012 The Large Pool After the Snake Goddess was dragged away, it was Fuxi's turn.
<br><br>
Fuxi walked towards the bottom of the fish hook and glanced at it. Then, he gingerly jumped up, held the fish hook in two fingers and then dragged it down a few times.
<br><br>
Since he thought that he did not have to bite the fish hook, he wanted to give it a try.
<br><br>
If the fish hook did not drag him up, then he would bite it.
<br><br>
But as soon as he dragged the hook about four times, it suddenly pulled him up.
<br><br>
At that moment, everyone realized that they only needed to grab the fish hook.
<br><br>
Therefore, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and King Ieuan followed suit and grabbed the fish hooks, which dragged them upwards.
<br><br>
Naturally, the three Eternal Realm Hunters also did the same.
<br><br>
By the time most of them had gone up, only the Wing King and the men in black robes remained.
<br><br>
The leader of the men in black robes glanced at the Wing King and said, "Let's go up too, but we have to leave eight people here to guard."
<br><br>
"No, you all can go up together if you want. I will seal the cave," said the Wing King.
<br><br>
The cave was the only place where they could retreat. Thus the Wing King had to make some arrangements.
<br><br>
Although he believed in these members of the Night Being race, he still chose to rely on himself in critical situations.
<br><br>
The leader of the men in black robes also knew that the Wing King and his group could not completely trust them. Thus, he just briskly said, "That's good. I'll go up with my race members!"
<br><br>
Afterward, the men in black robes grabbed the fish hooks and swung for a while, before the hooks dragged them up one after another.
<br><br>
After the fish hooks had pulled everyone up, the Wing King looked at the entrance of the cave and gently spread out his wings.
<br><br>
"Splash!"
<br><br>
Streams of emerald liquid washed across his wings, which looked like soft, flowing jade. It dripped along his back and quickly sealed the cave's entire entrance.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
When the cave's entrance was completely sealed, the jade formed from the emerald liquid glowed green, and then froze.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade was immensely sturdy. Without the Regal Jade Civilization's unique methods, it was very difficult to break it.
<br><br>
After the Wing King had finished, he stepped forward and bit the fish hook.
<br><br>
He shook a few times and then the hook dragged him into the space above like the others.
<br><br>
Above the cave was a vertical ascending passageway.
<br><br>
The space around the passageway spiraled upwards, so people could not tell its size and distance.
<br><br>
If they were in the chaos, the warriors would probably let go of the fish hooks and explore the space's secrets.
<br><br>
However, everyone currently held on to the fish hooks.
<br><br>
If they stopped, they might lose themselves in the space forever.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess was the most miserable one among the crowd.
<br><br>
She felt anxious to follow Zen when she saw him get dragged up, so she just bit the fish hook like the Treacherous Being did.
<br><br>
However, she found that Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the others all held on to the fish hooks with their fingers.
<br><br>
That was why she felt quite upset. As the fish hook dragged her up, she stared at Fuxi, who was not far below.
<br><br>
In turn, Fuxi just smiled bitterly at her.
<br><br>
He thought that he should bite the fish hook just like she did so that she would not feel so sad and embarrassed.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the fish hook did not rise very fast. Then, the Snake Goddess slowly reached towards the corners of her mouth and tightly gripped the fish hook with her fingers.
<br><br>
"Swoosh…"
<br><br>
About an hour later, everyone saw the green light and blue light intertwine above them.
<br><br>
The light floated around the space like waves as they gently and slowly moved up and down.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen rose slowly. As he crossed the blue and green waves, circles of blue and green ripples spread out.
<br><br>
Then, everyone below him got surprised.
<br><br>
It seemed that they were in some kind of special "water", but the "water"
<br><br>
did not exist at all. It was just the scene above that caused such an illusion.
<br><br>
Soon enough, it was the Snake Goddess's turn. Then Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others followed her.
<br><br>
All of them also caused blue and green ripples when they passed through the waves as well, as if they were fish out of water.
<br><br>
Furthermore, a new scene appeared in front of everyone as soon as they passed through the blue and green ripples.
<br><br>
All of them were in a big square pool, and around the pool stood many great bronze human statues.
<br><br>
Each bronze statue sat cross-legged beside the square pool and held a long fishing rod in their hands. Of course, the fish hooks hung down from those fishing rods.
<br><br>
The statues were quite massive in size, so the fishing rods were naturally the same.
<br><br>
The rods measured about five hundred feet long, and each rod was so thick that two people could get their arms around.
<br><br>
Zen climbed onto the fishing rod and then jumped towards one of the statues. "Why are there so many human statues?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked in surprise.
<br><br>
After Zen looked at them for a while, he said, "They are not the human statues, but the human spirits' statues."
<br><br>
These bronze statues were very similar to those in the Eternal Divine Courtyard, but the bronze statues by the pool had different appearances.
<br><br>
Some of them had long hair, some were bald, some were old, some were sitting, and some were standing. They must have been famous and extraordinary in their world.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven thought for a moment and agreed with Zen's speculation.
<br><br>
The farthest place the 77th civilization had reached in the Three Purities Stage was the underground passage where they got trapped.
<br><br>
As their group's leader, the Primeval Lord of Heaven naturally knew about it.
<br><br>
So there was no way any human being could come to this place and build the big pool and the magnificent statues.
<br><br>
There was only one possibility: it was the human spirits of the Four Spirits Sect that did such a thing.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen silently counted the statues beside the pool. "Two hundred bronze statues," he muttered.
<br><br>
"Their total number corresponds to the two hundred Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road, right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked. Just then, his eyes lit up as if in realization.
<br><br>
"I think so." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
Back then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had told Zen that the Treacherous Beings were very likely to be the souls of the Instant Civilization.
<br><br>
Based on the number of bronze statues, it was highly possible for this assumption to be true.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being controlled Zen's body to walk a certain distance, and stopped in front of a bronze statue at the corner of the pool.
<br><br>
The bronze statue was a young man with curly hair. He rested on the ground and lazily held the fishing rod in his arms.
<br><br>
When the Treacherous Being saw the bronze statue, its consciousness became a little level-headed. Then, it controlled Zen to touch the statue's face, and at the same time, it let out a series of deep whines.
<br><br>
This time, however, it wailed all of a sudden. Thus, the group of people who followed behind had no time to damage their hearing and had no choice but to listen to the sound.
<br><br>
Yet, after the wails stopped, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others looked at each other in dismay.
<br><br>
Although the Treacherous Being sounded as unpleasant as ever, it was completely within the range of their tolerance.
<br><br>
Even the unpleasant aura that Zen's body had emitted alleviated by multiple times.
<br><br>
"Did the Treacherous Being become weak? I feel that the grinding howl did not make me very uncomfortable this time. Squeak!" said King Ieuan.
<br><br>
"This Treacherous Being's will has weakened. The statue that rests on the ground is either the Treacherous Being itself or someone highly important to it," the leader of the men in black robes said from behind.
<br><br>
"Its will became weaker?" Fuxi asked. He paused deep in thought, and an idea popped in his head. "Can you drive it out of Zen's body now?" he asked.
<br><br>
"There's no hurry," said the leader of the men in black robes. Then he added, "This is the Treacherous Being's place of origin. Its will will only get weaker and weaker, and by that time, I will be more confident to help Zen get rid of it."
<br><br>
Chapter 4013 Armor Though the Wing King had accepted the Night Being race by asking them to climb onto his back earlier, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others were still dubious about them.
<br><br>
After all, the Night Being race couldn't even handle the six-headed eagles.
<br><br>
What made them think they could deal with the more powerful Treacherous Being? However, the leader of the Night Being race did prove himself. Now, everyone looked to him expectantly.
<br><br>
While the Treacherous Being was howling in front of the statue, Zen had already transmitted the words he had heard into his inner world.
<br><br>
Soon, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had deciphered them and announced the translation, "I remember...
<br><br>
My name is Campbell.
<br><br>
I want revenge!"
<br><br>
When Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard these words, their hearts skipped a beat.
<br><br>
These words revealed two pieces of information.
<br><br>
Firstly, the Treacherous Being's name was Campbell, and secondly, he had an enemy.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being was a soul from the Instant Civilization, so logically, his enemy could not be the Element Spirit Civilization or the Nihility race. This meant that his enemy must be from the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"Who is his enemy?" Zen asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
"Who do you think is qualified to be an enemy of a human spirit?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked back.
<br><br>
"Given the strength of the Four Spirits Sect, no creature in the Abstruse Energy World could've been strong enough to fight them," Zen said, as he put two and two together. Then, his eyes lit up. "The enemy of the human spirit might be the other three spirits!"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "There must be some sort of conflict within the Four Spirits Sect. Otherwise, this would not have happened."
<br><br>
The brush-wielder in the Eternal Scroll Painting was unwilling to reveal anything more, so Zen had to piece together the information he got by himself.
<br><br>
From what the Treacherous Being said, Zen had gotten the gist.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! The Treacherous Being stopped howling, but it continued to run like a wild animal.
<br><br>
Beside the huge pool was a passageway paved with cyan stones. At the end of the passageway stood a door.
<br><br>
After the Treacherous Being pushed the door open, a vast world suddenly appeared in front of Zen. In the blink of an eye, he was surrounded by a beautifully haunting sky full of stars.
<br><br>
Countless blazing dots of light were densely packed together in the sky, seemingly so far away.
<br><br>
Zen was completely entranced by the vastness of the starry sky; it seemed like he was being sucked into it.
<br><br>
"It's the Abstruse Energy World." Zen realized.
<br><br>
"Who would've thought this place was so close to the outside of the chaos..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, his eyes flashing.
<br><br>
Stars in the sky weren't a rare sight. They could be seen in many places of the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
However, those places were very far away from the stars, and there was an impenetrable force field that divided these places from the stars above. Up until now, no one had been able to cross this force field. The Eternal Realm warriors and the creatures in the Three Purities Stage couldn't explore the Abstruse Energy World, because the only path was controlled by the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, look into the distance," Zen shouted in excitement.
<br><br>
The two of them looked into the distance and saw huge round trays floating in the air with a pillar running down the center. These trays resembled water lilies floating on the surface of the water, and the pillar extended down to the void like the root of water lilies.
<br><br>
The round trays varied in size, and Zen realized that he and his group were on a small tray.
<br><br>
After observing for a while, the Primeval Lord of Heaven said affirmatively, "This is likely to be the highest realm of the Three Purities Stage, the Jade Pure Realm."
<br><br>
"Yes, I agree." Zen nodded in a daze.
<br><br>
In fact, when they were being dragged by the fish hooks, they had already speculated about this, but they were not too sure. After all, this might just be a special space.
<br><br>
However, with the round trays and the Abstruse Energy World so tangibly close, they realized the truth.
<br><br>
"Well then, the passage where we are trapped should also lead to the Jade Pure Realm. I wonder which tray it leads to," the Primeval Lord of Heaven remarked with a look of epiphany.
<br><br>
At first, he had thought that only one road could be opened up in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, namely the one where the thirty-nine human heroes were trapped.
<br><br>
Only after the Eternal Realm Hunters sent some information about the Myriad Pagoda Mountains through the Wing King did the Primeval Lord of Heaven realize that there was more than one road. Besides the one that had trapped them, the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race each mastered three more.
<br><br>
In the past, no one knew where these roads would lead to.
<br><br>
But now, they finally understood.
<br><br>
Every road eventually led to the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
However, the Jade Pure Realm was apparently made up of large and small round trays, and different roads led to different trays.
<br><br>
The crowd behind Zen also looked around with awe, their eyes practically popping out of their skulls.
<br><br>
"This must be the Jade Pure Realm!"
<br><br>
"It's a branch of the Jade Pure Realm..."
<br><br>
"The Myriad Pagoda Mountains are indeed the keys to the Jade Pure Realm!"
<br><br>
Everyone whispered amongst themselves excitedly. The Treacherous Being, however, continued to move forward.
<br><br>
Although the round tray they were standing on was small compared to the other ones, its diameter was roughly ten miles.
<br><br>
With every step the Treacherous Being took, a strange pattern would appear on the ground. These were not Sanskrit words, so Zen didn't bother asking the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher them.
<br><br>
After a short while, the Treacherous Being stopped beside one of the patterns and made Zen gently stomp his foot.
<br><br>
Then, the ground trembled.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Splash! Stone pillars suddenly emerged from beneath the patterns.
<br><br>
Exactly two hundred stone pillars emerged, all neatly arranged in a row.
<br><br>
Each pillar was hollow inside, where silver armors were stored.
<br><br>
The armors and weapons came in different shapes and sizes, but they all seemed to be of the same style.
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Beings must've used these things before they died," the Primeval Lord of Heaven posited.
<br><br>
When Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan saw the shining armors, their eyes lit up in excitement.
<br><br>
If the human spirits were from the Instant Civilization, then these things belonged to the Instant Civilization. Their grades could not be defined in the chaos.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being walked to one of the stone pillars and put its hand into it.
<br><br>
Buzz! The armor in the stone pillar let out a sharp sound and started to tremble.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Each piece of the armor flew out eagerly. As though they knew Zen was their master, they attached themselves to his shoulders, head, neck, chest, and legs.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Zen was fully clad in the armor, and then a silver spear appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being lifted the silver spear.
<br><br>
Buzz! A bright silver light was released from the armor and spear.
<br><br>
At the same time, a terrifying aura of energy was also emitted.
<br><br>
The moment everyone felt the energy, they all retreated quickly.
<br><br>
They didn't stop until they were several thousand feet away from Zen.
<br><br>
"The energy contained in the armor is so terrifying!" The Snake Goddess said, trembling in fear.
<br><br>
"Of course. It belongs to the Instant Civilization."
<br><br>
King Ieuan rolled its eyes. It turned its attention to the armors stored within the pillars.
<br><br>
They had gone through a lot of hardships to get here. How could they return home empty handed? Chapter 4014 The Big-head Monsters A flash of passion was quickly revealed in everyone's eyes.
<br><br>
However, they had just arrived at this completely strange place. They must be careful about possible powerful restrictions in the stone pillars. They couldn't be rash, so they decided that it wasn't the time to make drastic moves.
<br><br>
After they sized the stone pillars up for a while, their gazes fell once again on Zen.
<br><br>
He was still standing like a statue with a spear in his hand.
<br><br>
At the same time, they perceived that the aura of the Treacherous Being in Zen's body was gradually becoming weaker. It meant that the uncomfortable sensation that they were feeling was being slowly alleviated.
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Being's aura has weakened a lot. Can you drive it out from his body now?" The Snake Goddess turned and asked the leader of the black-robed men straightforwardly.
<br><br>
"I also think that this is the perfect opportunity to do it," the leader affirmed.
<br><br>
He then turned to his men, selected two from them, and quickly went to Zen's location.
<br><br>
The two black-robed men stood on Zen's sides. Each of them took out a small black mirror and began chanting some indistinguishable words.
<br><br>
Immediately after, black light shot out from both mirrors.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess and the others saw the black light, they instantly raised their eyebrows, knowing that it was the Dark Region.
<br><br>
It was known that nothing in the Dark Region could be brought into the Light Region. If they were brought and entered the Light Region, these things would quickly melt like ice sculptures placed under the scorching sun.
<br><br>
Then, the leader of the black-robed men walked towards the black light. As the leader was completely enveloped with the light, he raised his left hand and gently patted his wrist with his other hand. At the same time, he whispered, "Come out, little fellow. Don't be afraid. It's safe here."
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, a small gecko emerged from the sleeve of his robe.
<br><br>
The gecko's body was completely dark, but its eyes were brightly shining with a golden light. It stayed at the leader's palm as it spat out a dark-red tongue.
<br><br>
The two small mirrors reflected the Dark Region. People from outside the region wouldn't be able to see the gecko's body, but its two golden eyes would be perceived as two golden dots in the darkness.
<br><br>
When all their preparations were ready, the leader of the black-robed men ordered, "Give him a Darkness Fruit."
<br><br>
The gecko was a very fragile creature, and it was only suited for the Dark Region. Since it could only stay in the Dark Region, Zen had to be the one to enter it. Because of that, he needed a Darkness Fruit.
<br><br>
However, when one of the black-robed men beside Zen was about to take out the Darkness Fruit, the Snake Goddess informed their leader, "Zen is the ruler of Stage Thirteen. You should not worry about the erosion caused by the Dark Region."
<br><br>
"Ruler of Stage Thirteen?" The leader of the black-robed men was surprised as he looked at Zen.
<br><br>
As far as he knew, the stage rulers were all creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
That was why he couldn't believe that Zen was actually a ruler of one of the stages.
<br><br>
"Well, don't bother then," the leader of the black-robed men said as he waved his hand. He then gestured his subordinates to aim the small mirrors directly at Zen. As the black light enveloped Zen, the leader approached Zen's body and put the black gecko beside his ear.
<br><br>
The gecko seemed to have immediately sensed something and jumped onto Zen's head. Then it drilled its long tail into his ear.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The golden light in the gecko's eyes continuously flickered. Then, the light passed along its back, all the way to its tail, and went inside Zen's body through his ear.
<br><br>
Despite the gecko's fragile physique, it could actually exorcise all kinds of evil spirits.
<br><br>
However, the Treacherous Being couldn't be simply defined as a soul, so there was no assurance that the gecko's light would be effective. But the moment the light entered Zen's body, the Treacherous Being acted up. It was disgusted with the golden light, so the light could drive it away.
<br><br>
The leader of the black-robed men knew how powerful the Treacherous Being was. So in order for the gecko's power to succeed, he waited until the Treacherous Being's will was extremely weakened.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! A few moments after the golden light entered Zen's body, his eyes started to flicker with the same light.
<br><br>
When the leader of the black-robed men saw the golden light in Zen's eyes, he was kind of relieved. He believed that they were on the process of successfully driving the Treacherous Being out of Zen's body.
<br><br>
After a short while, Zen's body slightly trembled and his eyes closed.
<br><br>
The leader approached Zen's body and let the gecko jump back into his sleeve.
<br><br>
Then, the two subordinates gradually removed the Dark Region, and retreated beside their leader.
<br><br>
Everyone was expectant as they stared at Zen.
<br><br>
After a few seconds, his eyelids trembled and his eyes opened slowly.
<br><br>
His eyes went back to normal, and they were abnormally calm.
<br><br>
"Did it work?"
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others were already cheering for Zen's return.
<br><br>
However, Zen was strangely quiet. He just looked at the crowd with an emotionless face. It was as if his eyes were looking at inanimate objects.
<br><br>
Immediately noticing that something was still amiss, Fuxi asked, "Zen, is that already you?"
<br><br>
Then Zen frowned and whined, "Waah… Waah…"
<br><br>
The sounds he produced were kind of deep but not aggressive.
<br><br>
However, everyone instantly realized that this was not Zen, but still the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"What happened? I thought it would work?" Fuxi asked the leader of the black-robed men in a frustrated tone.
<br><br>
"I don't know. This is the first time that it failed. The Treacherous Being should have left by now." The leader couldn't also believe that Zen's body was still possessed.
<br><br>
"Zen, are you there? Can you respond to me?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi tried to communicate with him through his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
Although Zen wasn't able to control his physical body right now, his soul should remain in his mind, so he should still be able to communicate through his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
However, there was no response even from his soul.
<br><br>
Everyone present looked at each other with anxious eyes. Their problem remained unsolved, and there was a possibility that it became even worse.
<br><br>
While they were still at a loss, the Wing King suddenly said, "We have to go now."
<br><br>
"Why? What do you mean?" the Snake Goddess asked. "We're in a bad situation right now.
<br><br>
Zen sent me a message through the Civilization Artifact. He said that the sounds his body just made were warnings from the Treacherous Being," the Wing King explained.
<br><br>
"Warnings? About what? And why can't he communicate with his soul?"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess asked again as everything was unclear at the moment.
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Being has truly awakened, and it has imprisoned Zen's soul. That's why he wasn't able to answer through his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
He has instructed me to let all of you know that this place would be very dangerous. So, we have to get out of here as soon as possible," the Wing King explained further.
<br><br>
After the Heavenly Obsession Civilization deciphered the Treacherous Being's words, Zen immediately asked the Regal Jade Spirit to deliver his message to the Wing King through the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"Then we have no choice. We have to go now," Peterson said with a frown.
<br><br>
"So that means we have to leave Zen here alone?" the Snake Goddess asked, letting out a deep sigh.
<br><br>
No one answered as they knew how the Snake Goddess felt about abandoning Zen in his current state.
<br><br>
And while everyone was still hesitating to leave, a sound of bones crushing suddenly resounded from a distance.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Everyone looked at the direction where the disturbing sounds were coming from. Then, they saw a monster with a big head and a small body emerge from the darkness.
<br><br>
Upon closer inspection, they saw that the monster was chewing something.
<br><br>
A pair of legs hung from its mouth, and they were shocked to notice that the clothes of the person being chewed matched the clothes of the black-robed men.
<br><br>
"W-what kind of monster is that?"
<br><br>
"Is it eating one of our men?!"
<br><br>
"There's indeed someone missing!"
<br><br>
The black-robed men were standing farther at the back, so they didn't notice that one of them had been already missing.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute. One more person is missing. Where is Brock?" a blackrobed man said as he finished with the headcount.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! On the other side of the crowd, another big-headed monster emerged from the dark. They also saw a man's body hanging from its mouth, and he must be Brock.
<br><br>
When the Night Being race's special robes were broken, their bodies were quickly eroded in the Light Region. However, the speed at which their bodies were eroded was far slower than the rate at which the monsters chewed their prey.
<br><br>
Chapter 4015 Teamwork All of the Eternal Realm warriors present were always on guard. They frequently released their spiritual senses to monitor their surroundings.
<br><br>
Among all of them, the Wing King had the sharpest senses. Whether it was a mosquito or a fly, he immediately noticed everything.
<br><br>
However, the two big-headed monsters quietly appeared and abducted the two men in black robes. It was very odd! "Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
"Help me..."
<br><br>
One of the men in black robes named Brock was still conscious and cried faintly for help. Moreover, the sound of his bones being chewed also alerted everyone's ears in the immensely quiet environment.
<br><br>
The other men in black robes could not take it, so they tried to attack the big-headed monster to save Brock.
<br><br>
"Stop!" the leader of the men in black robes shouted.
<br><br>
"But Brock..." one man in black robes said anxiously.
<br><br>
Brock was his best friend.
<br><br>
How could he watch the monster chew him bit by bit? "I've made myself clear. Don't go there," the leader of the black-robed men said firmly.
<br><br>
He was the leader of the Night Being race, and he cared about all of his race's members. The monster not far away was devouring one of his members, but he did not go there to save him. However, it wasn't because he didn't want to, but more of he couldn't.
<br><br>
The other men in black robes fell silent.
<br><br>
Even though their faces weren't that visible due to their thick robes, the others felt their helplessness.
<br><br>
"What are these monsters?" Pearson asked in a low voice. His hands had already turned into thin spider threads, ready to fight at any time. At best, the Eternal Realm Hunters had only gone to the Supreme Pure Realm to explore. They didn't know much about the Treacherous Beings or the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
"They are Treacherous Beings, too. They are hostility-level Treacherous Beings, and they belong to the killing type," the leader of the men in black robes answered.
<br><br>
"Killing type... What do you mean?" Pearson asked again.
<br><br>
"Most Treacherous Beings have their own goals. Take the one that possessed Zen, for example. When something blocked it from its goals, that's the only time it attacked. But the killing type of Treacherous beings are different. Their goal is to kill, so we have to leave!" the leader of the men in black robes explained in a low voice.
<br><br>
"Then let's go!"
<br><br>
Pearson agreed.
<br><br>
Then, the three Eternal Realm Hunters quickly walked towards the door.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Snake Goddess looked at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen still looked like he had regained his consciousness as he calmly gazed at the crowd.
<br><br>
Earlier, the Treacherous Being had howled in an attempt to warn them to leave. It was clear that it was out of kindness.
<br><br>
With such a kind gesture… It was unlikely that it would hurt Zen.
<br><br>
"Take care," said the Snake Goddess, even though it was unknown if Zen had heard her or not. Then, she turned around and left quickly with Fuxi and the other Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
The two monsters were still about ten feet away from the crowd. They squatted on the ground and slowly chewed the two men in black robes.
<br><br>
They did not intend to attack the others, but they just stared at the crowd with their large, grotesque eyes.
<br><br>
As the warriors passed by them, a chill ran down their spines, and their hairs stood on end.
<br><br>
Aside from the unpleasant feeling that the Treacherous Beings caused them, they also felt a hint of cruelty, a killing aura that made them feel as if all life forms were nothing but garbage to them.
<br><br>
No one looked at the big-headed monsters as they passed by. Instead, they stared at the door. It should be safe after they entered the door.
<br><br>
Just as they were four miles away from the door, however, a dozen large heads popped out from the edge of the round tray! It appeared as if these big-headed monsters had reached a mutual agreement. At that moment, they crawled up from the edge of the round tray and gathered in the middle.
<br><br>
"So many of them! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!" King Ieuan exclaimed with wide eyes.
<br><br>
"Charge!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi commanded in a deep voice.
<br><br>
It was unfortunate that they couldn't even deal with an ordinary Treacherous Being. There were more than ten of them in this place, and according to the leader of the men in black robes, the killing type were far more dangerous than the ordinary ones.
<br><br>
What they didn't know was that at the bottom of the round tray, a large black head hung upside down.
<br><br>
The pitch-black head was over ten thousand feet high, and its eyes were closed. It should be asleep.
<br><br>
Around its neck were big-headed monsters that clung to each other, which made them look like a bunch of grapes.
<br><br>
Those big-headed monsters kept falling off the black head's neck. After they fell, they climbed from the bottom of the round tray up to the top of it.
<br><br>
At that point, everyone had a bad feeling and sped up.
<br><br>
The monsters looked stupidly ridiculous. They had big heads but small bodies, which gave the impression that they moved slowly.
<br><br>
However, they were surprisingly fast.
<br><br>
The men in black robes who were in front dashed and left a series of shadows in their wake.
<br><br>
With such a speed, they could enter the door in the blink of an eye. By the time they were a little more than a hundred feet away from the door, the big-headed monsters suddenly turned into black shadows and silently flew over.
<br><br>
"Dodge!" the leader of the men in black robes shouted.
<br><br>
Sadly, it was too late.
<br><br>
Although the people behind stopped, they could not see clearly how the monsters attacked.
<br><br>
As a result, four men in black robes who were still running disappeared.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
When everyone snapped back to their senses, four monsters nearby had already stopped and slowly devoured the men in black robes. Copious amounts of blood gushed from their mouths, accompanied by the pained howls of the men in black robes.
<br><br>
The big-headed monsters that were farther away still crawled slowly towards them.
<br><br>
These big-headed monsters had quite strange habits. They were never in a hurry to attack. If one ran away, they only stared at them with their black eyes.
<br><br>
"Chief, what should we do?" a man in black robes whimpered.
<br><br>
The Night Being race did have some experience in dealing with Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
This race's unique abilities only worked in the Dark Region. Even if their opponents were the powerful Treacherous Beings, they could still fight against them in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Outside the Dark Region, however, they were far inferior to even the ordinary Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
"Go back," Pearson suddenly said.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi countered, "I'm afraid if we retreat, we won't have a chance to survive. We can only go all out and charge. Everyone..." As he spoke, Pearson pointed at the door not far away. Dozens of big-headed monsters climbed up from the edge of the round tray, and slowly approached the door.
<br><br>
If they forcefully rushed towards them, they would all die.
<br><br>
"Retreat," said Fuxi.
<br><br>
No one had expected that they would face such a crisis in a short time.
<br><br>
This place was much more dangerous than the Whining Road! "These big-headed monsters are really odd. Don't move too fast. Retreat slowly!" the Snake Goddess strongly reminded.
<br><br>
"So what if we retreat? We will still die!" a man in black robes shouted hysterically.
<br><br>
"Odin! Shut up!" the leader hissed.
<br><br>
"It's all your fault. You brought us into this desperate situation! If you want to retreat, you can retreat by yourselves. I'm sorry, but I won't follow you!"
<br><br>
Afterward, the man in black robes named Odin brought out a yellow stone and crushed it. A ball of yellow light burst out from the stone and quickly pooled around his legs.
<br><br>
It was the Divine Walking Stone, which could greatly increase one's speed in a short amount of time.
<br><br>
Swish! Then, he turned into a beam of light and rushed towards the door.
<br><br>
Even if his speed had increased by more than three times, seven big-headed monsters surrounded him even faster as he dashed towards the door.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
The seven monsters formed a circle, then chewing sounds filled the air.
<br><br>
Then, they immediately divided Odin among themselves.
<br><br>
Chapter 4016 The Seventh Time Odin's miserable death was a lesson to the remaining men in black robes.
<br><br>
They didn't dare to act recklessly anymore.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters, however remained calm.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess said, "I think the Treacherous Being that has possessed Zen knows what's going on.
<br><br>
Maybe it can protect us."
<br><br>
Letting the Treacherous Being protect them seemed an inconceivable thought.
<br><br>
But it had given them a kind warning before.
<br><br>
Perhaps seeking its protection was the only choice that remained.
<br><br>
They didn't have much reason to hope but they still followed the Snake Goddess's instructions and retreated, step by step.
<br><br>
"Wing King, can you tell Zen about the situation we are in?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
The Wing King nodded and sent the news of the monsters with big heads to the Regal Jade Spirit through the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
In Zen's inner world, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had gathered dozens of people, ready to sing together.
<br><br>
Now that the Treacherous Being had regained its consciousness, it was possible for them to communicate with it.
<br><br>
Zen's avatar floated on the sidelines and watched them prepare.
<br><br>
They had undergone periods of training, thanks to which they became more and more skillful. They only needed to wait for the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to transmit the syllables to them.
<br><br>
Zen had previously tried to communicate with the Treacherous Being, but had failed since the latter didn't have a mind of its own.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit used the Grand Teleportation and appeared beside Zen before saying seriously, "Zen, the Wing King and the others haven't left."
<br><br>
"What? Why?" Zen exclaimed, taken aback.
<br><br>
"A number of Treacherous Beings have appeared and blocked their way."
<br><br>
Treacherous Beings? This meant even more trouble! According to what they had predicted before, the Treacherous Being named Campbell would leave Zen's body after fulfilling his wish.
<br><br>
But it now looked like things weren't that simple.
<br><br>
"This round tray hasn't been visited in a long time and the big-headed Treacherous Beings appeared as soon as we arrived," Zen murmured.
<br><br>
"I don't think it's a coincidence. Campbell obviously knows about it, or he wouldn't have warned the Snake Goddess and the others to leave," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, trying to analyze the situation.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes flashed. He then said to the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, "Translate my words into Sanskrit."
<br><br>
A while later, a chorus sounded from within Zen's inner world. "Master Campbell, can you hear me? I'm Zen Luo, the owner of this body."
<br><br>
Campbell stood still, silver spear in hand.
<br><br>
Many big-headed monsters were slowly climbing up from the edge of the round tray. Some of them were playing with their huge, horrible heads, rolling them around as they went.
<br><br>
They were slow but they gradually formed an encirclement.
<br><br>
Campbell, however, was in no hurry. He seemed to be waiting for these monsters to appear. He had waited for a while before he saw the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others return.
<br><br>
He howled, "You idiots! Didn't you understand what I told you?"
<br><br>
He had asked these humans to leave out of the kindness of his heart.
<br><br>
After all, they had a sort of connection with him because he was a human spirit, a continuation of the race.
<br><br>
Campbell was still lost in thought when an unpleasant voice sounded from Zen's elixir field. The voice was neither male nor female. It was, instead, a combination of several voices. "Master Campbell, can you hear me? I'm Zen Luo, the owner of this body."
<br><br>
Campbell was stunned. This was the Sanskrit land.
<br><br>
How could Zen speak Sanskrit? The voice was unpleasant on the ears but he could hear it clearly.
<br><br>
"Why? Why can you speak our language?" Campbell asked.
<br><br>
"You will know once you check my inner world," replied Zen.
<br><br>
Out of curiosity, Campbell began to check Zen's inner world as he was told.
<br><br>
He saw that a group of people were divided into three rows, making complicated sounds. "I once communicated with a creature from outside the chaos. I'm prepared."
<br><br>
"A team of so many people. It's interesting..." Campbell was intrigued by what he saw.
<br><br>
The creatures in the chaos lacked knowledge and experience. Limited by their world, neither could they communicate with creatures in the main world, nor did they have a complete understanding of the main world.
<br><br>
However, Zen had overcome the obstacles by virtue of the advantage in numbers.
<br><br>
Campbell had never seen such a thing before.
<br><br>
His companions would be shocked if they knew of this.
<br><br>
Campbell became more interested in Zen. He asked, "What's the matter? Do you want to take back your body?"
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact transmitted this sentence to the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization for deciphering, and then to Zen. The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was fast, but it still took some time to decipher the message and transmit it to Zen.
<br><br>
When Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard Campbell, they looked at each other, bitter smiles.
<br><br>
It looked like taking back his physical body wasn't going to be an easy task.
<br><br>
But right now, the most important thing was to ensure the safety of the Snake Goddess and her companions.
<br><br>
"Let's talk about it later. Both of us are from the human race. Can you protect my friends?" Zen pleaded.
<br><br>
As he spoke, the Snake Goddess and the others moved to his side.
<br><br>
The big-headed monsters were still following them closely.
<br><br>
"I'm not human," Campbell said arrogantly.
<br><br>
Human spirits were one of the most noble creatures in the main world, which was why they were proud of themselves.
<br><br>
Campbell continued, "I can't protect them. I don't even know if I can survive."
<br><br>
Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were shocked. "You don't know if you can survive these Treacherous Beings?"
<br><br>
Campbell suddenly looked sad and weary. "Most likely not. We were no match for them, at least in the past many years.
<br><br>
We wouldn't have been trapped in that damned place otherwise."
<br><br>
Campbell didn't explain any further but Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven could tell that he was referring to the Whining Road.
<br><br>
"We have tried many times. I myself have tried at least six times," Campbell said, shaking his head.
<br><br>
Six stripes were engraved on the armor of his right arm.
<br><br>
He then raised his long spear and used the tip of the spear to add another stripe on his right arm.
<br><br>
This was his seventh time here.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others were confused as they watched this. They didn't know why Campbell had added that extra stripe.
<br><br>
Chapter 4017 The Power Of Silver Energy After adding that stripe, Campbell said, "I have tried this for six times already. And I have failed each and every time. It's quite possible that I'll fail once again."
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Campbell remained calm and collected. His composure caused Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven sheer anxiety.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were practically invincible and immortal.
<br><br>
If Campbell failed once again, he could merely return to the Whining Road and be resurrected.
<br><br>
However, Zen and the others would be in big trouble. Therefore, this whole situation was extremely nerve-wracking.
<br><br>
"If I live through this, your friends might survive as well. But if I fail, you can't blame me..." After he warned Zen, Campbell pointed his silver spear towards the Snake Goddess' feet.
<br><br>
"Da!" He began channeling his energy.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
The bright silver energy poured down like mercury. Campbell dragged the long spear on the ground and began walking around the Snake Goddess and the others.
<br><br>
After he walked around, a bright silver circle of light surrounded them. The circle was as thick as an arm.
<br><br>
"Please tell your friends not to step outside the circle of light," Campbell told Zen.
<br><br>
Zen was only vaguely aware of what was happening outside. He couldn't quite see them clearly. Fortunately, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization's Civilization Artifact was able to instantly decipher what Campbell said.
<br><br>
When Zen understood this, he immediately asked the Wing King if they could see a silver circle of light around them.
<br><br>
After receiving a positive answer from the Wing King, Zen told him what Campbell said. The Wing King conveyed Zen's message to everyone at once. "The Treacherous Being said that this silver circle of light can protect us! We must not step out of it."
<br><br>
As their group saw the numerous large-headed monsters, they were filled with shock. They were even more surprised when they heard what the Wing King just said. Their expressions showed utter confusion.
<br><br>
They could not quite comprehend how a small silver circle of light could keep the large-headed Treacherous Beings at bay. These creatures were almost indestructible.
<br><br>
However, they were quickly running out of options. Even if they were quite skeptical about it, all they could do now was to stay inside this circle of light.
<br><br>
The large-headed monsters were slowly edging closer towards where they were standing. The nearest monster was only ten feet away from them.
<br><br>
With that, Zen bellowed and then gently shook his spear. With a mighty leap, he rose towards the sky like an eagle.
<br><br>
He soared upwards with such an astonishing speed. In a split second, he was hovering in the air like a silver ribbon.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the large-headed monsters that were moving so slowly on the ground rapidly jumped into the air as soon as Zen's body soared upwards.
<br><br>
They were like beasts that smelled blood and went into a frenzy. They turned into black shadows and instantly pounced towards Zen.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Zen clutched the long spear tightly in his right hand. Then, he held it out in front of him and it began to spin at such great speed. It almost looked like a spinning silver millstone.
<br><br>
The first large-headed monster to reach his position charged directly at him.
<br><br>
It opened its enormous mouth and attempted to bite him.
<br><br>
"Hey now..." Zen sneered.
<br><br>
As it drew closer, a mocking smile appeared on Zen's face. With the tip of his silver spear, he drew a silver wheel in the air. It instantly surged towards the monster but it merely passed through its center.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were very tricky to deal with. The main reason was because they could not be easily defeated with ordinary methods. One had to be familiar with their movements and abilities.
<br><br>
Even if their bodies were twisted, squeezed, or even stretched into noodlelike figures, they could just easily recover from it.
<br><br>
However, the silver energy emanating from Campbell's armor had a miraculous effect on the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
A ray of silver light streaked across the monster's huge and ugly head. It looked like a sharp weapon leaving a mark at a metal ball.
<br><br>
The large-headed monster's oval head sustained a deep cut from the tip of the spear. It fell downwards as it struggled with the serious wound on its head.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish...
<br><br>
Zen slightly withdrew the silver spear and it swiftly stabbed backwards from under his right arm.
<br><br>
Puff, puff, puff! The group heard several gusts of air from above.
<br><br>
They saw that the silver spear had shot four rays of silver light out consecutively. It looked like four silver dragons that accurately pierced through the four large-headed monsters behind Zen.
<br><br>
The spear light that effectively pierced the monsters extended straight into the distance behind them. It even shot all the way out of the round tray. But in the blink of an eye, the light strangely disappeared.
<br><br>
As they watched this intense fight, Zen's companions huddled inside the silver circle of light and were utterly terror-stricken.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the large-headed monsters seemed to choose Zen as their main target as soon as Campbell used Zen's body to wage a fierce battle against them.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, there were still six monsters on the ground. They were moving slowly around the silver circle of light. It looked like they were thoroughly wary and afraid of the circle because they didn't even dare step on it. They were staring at the sky as they moved. Their gaze followed Zen's every movement. They seemed ready to pounce on him as soon as an opportunity presented itself.
<br><br>
"This silver circle of light is incredibly mystical. The large-headed Treacherous Beings don't even dare step over it. Squeak!" King Ieuan exclaimed in its amazement. It couldn't believe how powerful it was.
<br><br>
"It's not that they don't dare enter it. They are merely disgusted with this kind of energy," the Snake Goddess uttered.
<br><br>
"Well, disgust is also rooted from fear," replied the leader of the blackrobed men. "This silver energy obviously has an extraordinary effect upon the Treacherous Beings. It's very similar to the energy released by my Black River Gecko!"
<br><br>
It was true that the Black River Gecko raised by the leader of the blackrobed men also bore the same effect. However, the Black River Gecko was too small in size to fight against the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
One after another, the large-headed monsters turned into black shadows and pounced at Zen.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, it didn't matter how fast the monsters moved or how wide their mouths were. They would easily be pierced through or taken down by the silver spear light. After receiving serious blows from the silver energy, the large-headed monsters were no longer able to recover. They would instantly fall to the ground and struggle for a while. Then they would collapse and lay there motionlessly.
<br><br>
Once in a while, a few severely injured monsters would land directly inside the circle of light. The Eternal Realm Hunters would quickly move them out of the circle.
<br><br>
"Unbelievable. That spear is incredibly powerful!" Thurston commended out loud.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Pearson had a puzzled look upon his face. He asked his companions, "These Treacherous Beings are all at the hostility level. So why is there such a huge gap between their strength and the strength of the one that has possessed Zen?"
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Being that has possessed Zen's body is not the one that's powerful. Rather, it's the silver energy emanating from the spear and armor," the Snake Goddess responded solemnly. "If we can wield that kind of energy, it will also be very easy for us to kill those large-headed Treacherous Beings!"
<br><br>
When they heard this, the others nodded in agreement. If they could control the silver energy as well, they should be able to deal with the Treacherous Beings effectively too.
<br><br>
In such a short span of time, Zen had already killed almost forty largeheaded monsters. He annihilated those powerful monsters as easily as if he was merely slaughtering chickens and sheep. Naturally, everyone's despondent and dejected mood disappeared. Their morale had increased significantly.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh... They heard a rushing noise near them.
<br><br>
The eight large-headed monsters that had been crawling over not far away also leapt into the air.
<br><br>
Zen swung his long spear around. All of a sudden, his calm gaze froze. At that point, the silver spear shot out countless small rays of light.
<br><br>
If one viewed this scene from below, it looked like a shower of silver rain.
<br><br>
Those large-headed monsters were effortlessly torn into pieces by it. As they were struck by the silver light, they fell straight down.
<br><br>
However, three more monsters pounced on him from behind as soon as he killed these eight monsters.
<br><br>
The long silver spear in Zen's hand appeared as though it had a soul. With just a light flick, it automatically stabbed three times behind him. If he could keep this up without any untoward incident, it would be really easy to kill those monsters.
<br><br>
But at that very moment, the silver light on Zen's armor and spear suddenly dimmed. The change in its glow was extremely noticeable.
<br><br>
Poof! Poof! The first two strikes were still able to pierce through two of the monsters.
<br><br>
Upon the third strike, however, the silver light on his armor and spear disappeared entirely.
<br><br>
They noticed that the power of the third strike was far less than that of the previous ones. The monster blocked it with ease.
<br><br>
The expression on Zen's face slightly changed when he failed to pierce through the third monster with his spear.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen smashed the large-headed monster into the ground forcefully with the shaft of the spear. He managed to do it in the speed of light.
<br><br>
But without the massive support of the silver energy, Zen's attack was unable to cause any substantial damage to the monster. As soon as the monster landed on the ground, it immediately bounced right up and charged towards Zen once more.
<br><br>
As Zen watched this, he swiftly came down and landed beside the Snake Goddess and the others. Meanwhile, his spear was already pointed at the silver circle of light.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The long spear appeared as though it was a vacuum that was sucking the light in. It absorbed all of the silver energy in the circle! Once again, the tip of the spear flashed with bright silver light. Meanwhile, the monster was already closing in on Zen. It opened its mouth wide and bared its sharp teeth as if it was determined to swallow Zen whole.
<br><br>
Boom! A mark of Eight Diagrams exploded directly on the face of the monster. It forcefully pushed it dozens of feet away! It was Fuxi who launched the attack.
<br><br>
Campbell, controlling Zen's body, looked back at Fuxi and nodded with thanks. After that, he pointed his long spear at the monster and slaughtered it.
<br><br>
Chapter 4018 Builders Most big-headed monsters were eliminated on the round tray, while three or four of them were still left wandering aimlessly in the distance.
<br><br>
When Zen saw them, he immediately rushed over with the long spear in his hand.
<br><br>
As soon as he approached the monsters, several silver spear lights emerged and all of them were instantly killed.
<br><br>
After finishing the job, Zen returned and glanced at the crowd indifferently.
<br><br>
Then, he suddenly tilted his head and opened his mouth.
<br><br>
From Zen's eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, the Treacherous Being's body continuously flowed out until it formed a shape of a human.
<br><br>
Previously, they saw him as an abstract human figure with an extremely odd face.
<br><br>
However, when he went out of Zen's body, his form became complete.
<br><br>
Every detail on the body was outlined, and he actually possessed a goodlooking face. He looked exactly the same as the bronze statue beside the pool.
<br><br>
Soon after, Zen's eyes opened, and the glisten in his eyes had finally returned.
<br><br>
"Zen! You're finally back!"
<br><br>
"Are you okay now?"
<br><br>
"Thank goodness!"
<br><br>
After killing all of the monsters, they had been thinking about how they could communicate with the Treacherous Being to make him leave Zen's body.
<br><br>
But unexpectedly, he left on his own volition.
<br><br>
"Don't worry guys. I'm fine now. This is Master Campbell, and he's actually a member of our race, so he has no intention of hurting me," Zen explained with a smile.
<br><br>
"His name is Campbell?" the Snake Goddess asked as she raised her eyebrows.
<br><br>
"Then where did he come from?" Fuxi asked too.
<br><br>
"And why did he possess your body? Squeak!" King Ieuan inquired its own question.
<br><br>
Indeed, there were a lot of questions that needed to be answered. Even Zen didn't know all of them, and he desired the answers directly from Campbell himself.
<br><br>
Zen just smiled at his companions and turned towards Campbell. A chorus immediately came from his inner world and translated the words. "Master Campbell, I actually have a lot of questions. Would you care to answer them?"
<br><br>
Campbell just glanced at Zen with indifferent eyes and waved his hand.
<br><br>
"What do you still need? I've already returned your body. You can leave now."
<br><br>
After saying that, he softly pointed a finger at Zen. Then, the armor attached to Zen's body was peeled off, and the long spear was also pulled from his hand.
<br><br>
Campbell had completely awakened and regained his consciousness. He had been trying for countless of years, and he finally succeeded with the help of Zen's body.
<br><br>
Two hundred Treacherous Beings that were trapped on the Whining Road had been tirelessly achieving this goal. They would possess the passers-by on the road, and their final goal was to come to this place, no matter what the cost.
<br><br>
Among the rest, he was the first one to succeed in regaining his consciousness and not be eaten by the big-headed monsters. But even though he was overjoyed, he didn't quite reveal his emotions.
<br><br>
He didn't say that he didn't want to answer Zen's questions, so Zen still asked him anyway. "Master Campbell, are you from the Human Spirit Sect? We, humans, are what you may call the continuation of the human spirits. If there is anything we can do to help you, you can tell us without reservations. Don't give us the cold shoulder," Zen said patiently.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't typically the one who wanted to force an answer from others.
<br><br>
However, this situation wasn't an ordinary one. It wasn't easy meeting a human spirit, so he couldn't just let an important opportunity like this slip by.
<br><br>
Campbell was still looking at Zen nonchalantly. "Your physical body has been sufficient. It helped me contact the Light of Annihilation and kill those Treacherous Beings. Ultimately, it helped me completely wake up. But it's still not enough…" He shook his head as he continued speaking, "Well, it has nothing do with you now, so you don't have to involve yourself with me."
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation that he mentioned was the silver energy that was attached to the armor and the long spear.
<br><br>
It could greatly restrain the Treacherous Beings, so Campbell couldn't have direct contact with it. That was why he needed a physical body where he could attach himself.
<br><br>
His instinct told him that he should look for and choose a strong physical body.
<br><br>
Now that he was fully awakened, Zen's body wouldn't suffice anymore.
<br><br>
In his eyes, Zen, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others who were from the secondary world and at the Eternal Realm were not qualified enough to get involved with his matters, given their current strength and innate limitations.
<br><br>
"Well, I still did help you wake up. And I'm not even asking for any reward.
<br><br>
I just want some information," Zen insisted and pushed his luck.
<br><br>
Although Campbell was quite arrogant, he was still grateful to have returned to his original form. So, he shrugged his shoulders and sighed, "Sure, go ahead."
<br><br>
"Then, is this the Jade Pure Realm?" Zen asked straightforwardly.
<br><br>
"The Jade Pure Realm, huh? Technically, you can say that. But this is just like the outer layer. There are several Pure Sky Platforms like this in the entire Jade Pure Realm. If you're really looking for the real Jade Pure Realm, go to the Pure Sky Platform in that direction." Campbell pointed his finger to the distance.
<br><br>
"It's a hundred times larger than this one. That must be what you're after,"
<br><br>
he continued.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the direction that Campbell pointed to. There was a dense mass of starlight in the area, preventing him from seeing anything clearly.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had a similar guess to what Campbell had said. She thought earlier that the Pure Sky Platform that they were currently on was a branch of the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
"Another one, are you from the Instant Civilization?" Zen took the opportunity and asked again.
<br><br>
"Instant Civilization?" It was actually Campbell's first time hearing this term, so it was a bit difficult for him to answer.
<br><br>
"It's the name given to the first civilization that existed in the chaos. In short, it should be the civilization that built the chaos." Zen tried to explain in the easiest way to understand.
<br><br>
Campbell quickly understood what he meant. There was a faint smile on his face as he said, "Going by what you said, then yes, I'm from the Instant Civilization. The chaos that you're talking about was built by us."
<br><br>
"So it's true?"
<br><br>
Although Zen already had a hunch, he was still surprised when he heard it directly from Campbell's mouth.
<br><br>
"That's right." There was a bit of a frown that appeared on Campbell's face.
<br><br>
"This particular secondary world was built with our greatest efforts, and it was also the last one that we built."
<br><br>
Zen was relieved that he had asked the right question. Now, Campbell was starting to tell more about his background.
<br><br>
The two hundred Treacherous Beings were called the "builders" in the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
They were the ones who built all of the secondary worlds one after another.
<br><br>
After building the chaos, they planned and decided to restart it, so that it could operate on its own.
<br><br>
However, just a day before the plan to restart it, a deadly invisible poison floated out and spread from the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
They had never thought that they would be caught with the internal strife of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
It was too late when they noticed the poison, and they were all instantly killed.
<br><br>
After the creatures of the main world died in a secondary world, they turned into Treacherous Beings that would never die.
<br><br>
They took the form of spiritual orbs that wandered aimlessly, using their remaining consciousness.
<br><br>
Fortunately, they still possessed strong wills in their hearts. Once they achieved and completed their goals, their chance to return and wake up would be attained.
<br><br>
The two hundred builders of the Human Spirit Sect lived in this Pure Sky Platform. While they were trapped in the Whining Road, they strove and struggled to return to this place. When they successfully did that, it was the time that they would completely awaken and regain their consciousness.
<br><br>
After regaining their consciousness, the first thing they wanted to do was investigate what happened in the past.
<br><br>
How were they killed in an instant? And who was really behind it? Unfortunately, as soon as they regained their consciousness, they were devoured by the big-headed monsters before they could even leave the place.
<br><br>
Soon after, they would come back to life on the Whining Road in the form of Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
The miserable cycle went on, until Campbell was the first one to succeed.
<br><br>
Chapter 4019 Hard To Accept Campbell's words made Zen's eyes widen in surprise.
<br><br>
Based on his tone, it didn't seem as if Campbell knew much about the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Zen thought it best to raise another question. "Master Campbell, what do you plan to do now?"
<br><br>
Campbell raised his head to look at the starry sky. "Now that I'm awake, I will naturally go back and look for answers on who poisoned us back then."
<br><br>
The builders had a relatively high position in the Four Spirits Sect and enjoyed a certain level of prestige.
<br><br>
They were, after all, the ones whom the Four Spirits Sect relied on to expand their territory.
<br><br>
To poison such important members of the Four Spirits Sect was a serious crime. It was no doubt done by someone with both guts and power. There was a solemn look in Campbell's eyes as he continued to stare at the sky. "I would like to know why they stopped us from awakening again, and again, and again..."
<br><br>
As his words trailed off, he turned to look at Zen.
<br><br>
He expected a look of enlightenment, an expression bright with realization, but all Campbell saw was Zen's furrowed brows of worry.
<br><br>
The young man's expression made him frown. "What's wrong?" Campbell asked. "Did I say anything wrong?"
<br><br>
Zen licked his lips as he let out a heavy sigh. "Did you never come into contact with anyone from the main world after you were poisoned?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Campbell shook his head. "No. Neither me nor any of my companions have ever met with anyone from the main world." Every single time he came here led by his obsession, he would end up killed by those big-headed monsters which prevented him from waking up completely.
<br><br>
"So you are unaware of the Four Spirit Sect's current situation," Zen murmured, his eyes twinkling with a strange color.
<br><br>
"Why? What is their current situation?" Campbell asked, half puzzled yet also half-apprehensive with the look on Zen's face.
<br><br>
"If the creatures in our chaos want to enter the Three Purities Stage, we would need to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting and become Eternal Realm warriors to do so," Zen began.
<br><br>
"I built the passage. I know how it works," Campbell replied with a nod.
<br><br>
"I entered the center of the Eternal Scroll Painting."
<br><br>
Campbell's brows rose at Zen's revelation. "Then that means you're quite talented and you inherited the origin-level bloodline. Congratulations. No wonder your physical strength is excellent."
<br><br>
To be able to obtain the origin-level bloodline was a very outstanding feat for creatures from secondary worlds.
<br><br>
Of course, as a member and a builder of the Four Spirits Sect, the originlevel bloodline wasn't as big of a deal to Campbell. After all, those talented warriors of the Four Spirits Sect all set their minds to get the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Zen, however, was quick to correct him. "No, I entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard."
<br><br>
This new piece of information made Campbell narrow his eyes at him.
<br><br>
Creatures from secondary worlds weren't expected to reach the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Such a feat was incredibly rare.
<br><br>
Once a warrior obtained the ancestry-level bloodline, that immediately qualified him or her as a member of the Four Spirits Sect. Warriors who managed such a feat were usually outstanding and quickly grew powerful under the sect's guidance.
<br><br>
Normally, the Ten Directions House of the Human Spirit Sect would reach out and immediately try to recruit such amazing talents. Why was Zen here in the Three Purities Stage then? Did he fail in the Eternal Divine Courtyard? That couldn't be right.
<br><br>
No, it was downright impossible! Only promising geniuses could ever set foot in the Eternal Divine Courtyard. The Four Spirits Sect made the test extremely difficult and strict on warriors from secondary worlds.
<br><br>
The same couldn't be said for the members of the sect. They could enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard more easily but that also meant that quite a lot of them suffered the unbearable power of the ancestry-level bloodline, and thus were rejected by the bloodline.
<br><br>
However, those from secondary worlds who had already entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard held a greater potential to pass the ancestry-level bloodline's test.
<br><br>
"Did you enter by invitation?" Campbell asked.
<br><br>
"Invitation?" Zen repeated. He shook his head. "I got in by myself."
<br><br>
"What?!" Campbell remarked in shock. Did he hear that correctly? "How in the world were you able to get in by yourself? Are you kidding me?!"
<br><br>
The Eternal Divine Courtyard was the center of the Four Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
There was no way Zen would've been allowed to enter by himself.
<br><br>
Zen's next few words would continue to shock Campbell. "There was nobody there. The Eternal Divine Courtyard was abandoned, at least that was what the bronze statues told me."
<br><br>
Campbell could only shake his head, unwilling to accept Zen's words as fact. He kept silent for a while.
<br><br>
Then he said in a firm tone, "You're lying! There's no way the Four Spirits Sect would give up on the Eternal Divine Courtyard!"
<br><br>
"I believe you," Zen told him in what he hoped was a calming tone. "The Four Spirits Sect would have definitely been unwilling to give the courtyard up but maybe something happened to them? Like a catastrophe, maybe even a massacre?"
<br><br>
Campbell froze. "Massacre..." he repeated. Zen was about to ask him if he was okay when he suddenly let out a loud, maniacal laugh as if he had just heard the funniest joke in the world.
<br><br>
A massacre? The Four Spirits Sect was the sole dominant power in the main world! Sure, there were a few creatures and races that were quite powerful but they were nothing compared to the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
After his less than sane laughter, Campbell threw Zen an aggressive glare.
<br><br>
"Who can massacre our Four Spirits Sect?"
<br><br>
Zen continued to use his calm voice to talk to an obviously distressed Campbell. "Yes, the Four Spirits Sect was indeed powerful," he began.
<br><br>
"However, the human, snake, bird, and monkey spirits weren't usually united, correct? Wouldn't there be any internal strife which led them to kill each other? You said it yourself: the Four Spirits Sect was so powerful that no one would ever dare attack you. Nobody, of course, save for the people within the sect itself," Zen declared.
<br><br>
"I met the brush wielder. He told me that there was some sort of internal strife within the Four Spirits Sect which led to a split-up."
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Zen's words were sent and translated through the Heavenly Obsession Civilization in his inner world. They eventually reached the ears of the group of people who then conveyed them through a song.
<br><br>
His words managed to convince Campbell.
<br><br>
After all, it was the most viable reason.
<br><br>
Who would ever dare attack the powerful world builders? Who would ever dare poison them? There was no way some external force would be stupid enough to do such a thing. So that meant the culprit was someone from the inside. An outsider would never succeed in poisoning two hundred world builders unnoticed.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Eternal Realm Hunters, and the black-robed men couldn't understand since Zen's voice was directly transmitted to his inner world. It was better this way since there was some information that couldn't be revealed to everyone.
<br><br>
All they knew was that there was a bit of singing and then Campbell suddenly became very upset so they naturally wanted to know what happened.
<br><br>
"No!" Campbell declared. "I do not believe this. I will go there myself!"
<br><br>
Denial was always the first stage in grief. No matter how rational Zen's words had been, Campbell did not want to believe them.
<br><br>
He wouldn't believe unless he confirmed it with his own two eyes.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
He immediately stamped his feet on one side of the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
From there, a series of patterns flashed on the ground.
<br><br>
Soon enough, a strangely-shaped collection of houses suddenly floated into the air.
<br><br>
The house on the helm was incredibly small and only featured a door that could accommodate a single person at most. There were a total of five houses and each house was twice the size of the one that preceded it.
<br><br>
"Master Campbell," Zen called out to Campbell. "Where are you going?!"
<br><br>
"As a builder, I naturally have a path that could take me to the main world.
<br><br>
There is no need to follow me. Creatures from secondary worlds would have difficulty traveling in the main world without undergoing transformation," Campbell answered just as he pushed the door open.
<br><br>
"Crack! Boom!"
<br><br>
He had just taken a step inside the threshold when a great force shook the door.
<br><br>
Campbell tried to grab the door frame out of instinct but it only ended up with him thrown into the air and landing over ten miles away, with both his hands and feet also stretching for the same distance.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Campbell was in the form of a Treacherous Being and was able to withstand the blow.
<br><br>
Chapter 4020 The Black Head Campbell's body had been stretched out, so it took some time for him to recover and turn back to his human shape.
<br><br>
After he could move properly, he headed back for the door, but as he did, his expression darkened.
<br><br>
The exit had been blasted into pieces; the entire passageway had been destroyed! "Is this some kind of trap set up a long time ago?" Campbell asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
Only the Four Spirits Sect, or to be exact, only some members of the Human Spirit Sect knew about the secret passage to the main world.
<br><br>
Someone had blatantly destroyed the secret passage. The traitor must be someone from the Four Spirits Sect, or to be exact, the Human Spirit Sect...
<br><br>
This proved Zen right.
<br><br>
"This place is so close to the Abstruse Energy World. Can you leave by going up?" Zen asked Campbell as he pointed at the sky.
<br><br>
Looking up, he felt the Abstruse Energy World was so close, as though it was within his reach.
<br><br>
Campbell glared at Zen. "Don't be stupid. Take that path if you want to court death."
<br><br>
The force field that lingered above the Jade Pure Realm had actually been set up by Campbell and his companions, so he knew the risks.
<br><br>
"If that's the case, then I'm afraid you have no choice but to pass through the road controlled by the Element Spirit Civilization," Zen said with a shrug.
<br><br>
"Of course I know that," Campbell snapped impatiently.
<br><br>
The path they were supposed to take, the one that had been destroyed, was actually a secret shortcut. The usual bridge between the chaos and the Abstruse Energy World was the road controlled by the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
"But the Element Spirit Civilization won't let you pass," Zen warned.
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit Civilization? Are they powerful?" Campbell asked.
<br><br>
At the mention of any of the creatures in the chaos, Campbell's expression would change a little, from scornful to condescending.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful the creatures in the chaos were, Campbell usually didn't take them seriously.
<br><br>
However, Zen was an exception. After all, Zen had been to the Eternal Divine Courtyard and passed the test of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"It's the strongest civilization on the Other Shore. They were the first civilization after the chaos was created," Zen explained patiently. "There's no way we can defeat them in this condition, and they won't let you pass."
<br><br>
"I can't defeat them?" Campbell asked, eyebrow raised dubiously.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Campbell hesitantly. "I'm not sure. Well, you have killed Les before you woke up..."
<br><br>
"Is Les a member of the Element Spirit Civilization?"
<br><br>
Even after awakening, Campbell still retained his memories from when he was still asleep. Naturally, he remembered how he had killed Les.
<br><br>
In the eyes of Campbell, Les was indeed powerful, but he still triumphed over him easily when he shrank him into oblivion.
<br><br>
"Yes, it is said that he is one of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization."
<br><br>
Campbell smiled slightly. "Then they're not worth taking seriously, either."
<br><br>
Although his real body had already perished, his body as a Treacherous Being was a great weapon. Naturally, he was confident he could defeat anyone from the Element Spirit Civilization. After all, he did kill one of their leaders.
<br><br>
Just then, they heard maniacal laughter burst out from somewhere on the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
It was as if countless people were laughing crazily. Then, they sensed a terrible aura in the air.
<br><br>
Someone was speaking Sanskrit.
<br><br>
Campbell's expression darkened. It seemed he could understand the voice.
<br><br>
"Heavenly Obsession Civilization, help me decipher the Sanskrit words!"
<br><br>
Zen cried as he transmitted the laughter to his inner world.
<br><br>
It didn't take long for the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to translate the noise. "Not worth taking seriously... As a mere world builder who wasn't even accepted by the Ten Directions House, how dare you speak recklessly now? Hahaha..."
<br><br>
From the bottom of the Pure Sky Platform, the huge black head suddenly reared its unsettling face, eyes and mouth wide open. That was where the waves of laughter were coming from! As it laughed, it slowly moved along the bottom of the Pure Sky Platform until it reached the edge of the platform.
<br><br>
It was a black head that was ten thousand feet tall. It had no body, but instead there were many oval spheres under it. Zen recognized these spheres; they were the large-headed monsters that they had encountered before.
<br><br>
Whenever the large-headed monsters were killed by Campbell, they would disappear and revive in another place. This was the case with all the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
However, Zen never expected that the place where these monsters were revived was right underneath the Pure Sky Platform! These monsters all huddled under the massive black head like grapes on a vine, rendering the black head even more terrifying.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin and the others saw the huge creature, their faces turned pale.
<br><br>
"The resentment-level... It's the resentment-level Treacherous Being!" the leader of the black-robed men cried.
<br><br>
Although the Treacherous Beings were divided into three levels, with the hatred level being the strongest, no one had ever actually seen a hatred-level Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Thus, the resentment-level Treacherous Being was already regarded as the most formidable one.
<br><br>
Even the three Eternal Realm Hunters bore serious expressions. Judging from the aura released by the black head, all the trouble they had experienced before amounted to nothing compared to this moment.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" Campbell asked, raising his head.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being must have been formed by the creature of the main world after it died.
<br><br>
The more powerful the creature was, the more formidable its Treacherous Being would be.
<br><br>
The creature, which formed the resentment-level Treacherous Being, must've been extremely powerful when it was alive.
<br><br>
The black head howled in laughter. "You don't need to know who I am," it said in Sanskrit. "You just need to know that you should've stayed on the Whining Road!"
<br><br>
Buzz! The black head's eyes began to flicker with red light which shot out after accumulating to a certain extent.
<br><br>
"Run!" Zen cried.
<br><br>
When the crowd saw two rays of red light shooting towards them, they all dodged to the side.
<br><br>
Swish! Fortunately, they were able to dodge in time. The red light swept over and past them.
<br><br>
Campbell, too, was able to jump out of harm's way.
<br><br>
Only one man in the black robe was a split-second too slow. Before he could even scream, the red light flashed through him.
<br><br>
At first, he stood perfectly still.
<br><br>
Then, the man in the black robe collapsed into a pile of black soot.
<br><br>
Everyone stared at the scene in horror. How could they not be seized with fear, knowing that one touch of the llight would burn them to dust? Having dodged the red light, Campbell stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
The armor, which had been scattered on the ground, dashed straight for Zen.
<br><br>
Even the spear pulsated with energy.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
In less than three seconds, the armor had been completely attached onto Zen's body.
<br><br>
"Kill him!" Campbell ordered Zen.
<br><br>
Zen gripped the spear tightly and nodded. Raising his hand, he jabbed the spear towards the monster in the distance.
<br><br>
A silver light shot out from the tip of the spear. The black head had no form of defenses whatsoever, so the Light of Annihilation pierced through it cleanly.
<br><br>
However, once the silver light faded, there was but a small hole on the black head. Compared to its overall size, the piercing was but a mosquito bite.
<br><br>
However, the Light of Annihilation on the spear in Zen's hand had completely dimmed.
<br><br>
Chapter 4021 A Smiling Man Zen held up the dim spear and then glanced at Campbell.
<br><br>
With the help of the Light of Annihilation, the latter had killed many hostility-level Treacherous Beings just now.
<br><br>
Now the Light of Annihilation had dimmed. The spear might be of extraordinary quality, but it was still nothing more than a piece of scrap metal in the face of the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Everyone looked at the now blunt tip of the spear and then turned to look at Campbell.
<br><br>
"That stone," Campbell suddenly said.
<br><br>
"What?" A strange look appeared on Zen's face.
<br><br>
Campbell didn't explain anything but gently pointed at Zen's chest.
<br><br>
A small bump appeared out of nowhere on his ribs. It was as if there was something extra there, something that didn't belong. Then the bump moved along his esophagus and quickly reached his throat and then his mouth.
<br><br>
Then it was involuntarily spat out. Only then everyone saw that it was a cubic stone with several cracks on its surface.
<br><br>
As for Zen, as soon as the stone had moved in his body, he had started to recall that it had been taken out from Les' body.
<br><br>
At that time, Campbell had not awakened. He had merely said that this stone was called the Holy Stone, and then forcefully stored it inside Zen's body.
<br><br>
Neither Zen nor the Primeval Lord of Heaven knew why he had done so.
<br><br>
Les had used this Holy Stone to unfold the protective sphere, but once the protective sphere was smashed, the energy contained within the stone should have been exhausted. From the way they saw, the stone was all its name suggested. A stone! "Can this stone be useful?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"As creatures of the secondary world, you naturally do not know the mysteries of this stone," Campbell remarked as he pointed at the Holy Stone.
<br><br>
Buzz! To their immense surprise, the Light of Annihilation immediately burst forth from the Holy Stone like water from a fountain.
<br><br>
When Zen saw this, his eyebrows rose. He quickly grabbed the stone in one hand and held the spear in the other.
<br><br>
The spear was covered with several grooves like drainage paths. As soon as the Light of Annihilation gushed out of the Holy Stone, it quickly filled every single centimeter of those grooves.
<br><br>
Perhaps the black head felt the threat of the Light of Annihilation when this began to happen because its reaction was rather fierce. The red lights in its eyes shone once more. Whoosh! Two beams crisscrossed against the ground and swept towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Before anyone could warn him, Zen himself jumped and fell to the ground sideways. With the help of the silver spear, he then jumped high into the air like a nimble monkey and fell sharply once more, rolling over again and again to get out of the beams' path.
<br><br>
The fatal red lights followed him all the way, but he managed to dodge them every single time they reached near.
<br><br>
The others merely stood in different corners and positions, afraid of being hit. They weren't fast enough to dodge the beams.
<br><br>
The red lights chased after Zen for two circles before they finally dimmed.
<br><br>
However, the black head was not going to let go of Zen so easily. After all, the Light of Annihilation was extremely lethal to it.
<br><br>
Buzz! The red lights in its eyes began to accumulate once again.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen, finding his chance, spiraled up. The long spear in his hand shook violently and he pointed it towards the huge black head.
<br><br>
Swish! The silver Light of Annihilation turned into a sharp spear light and rushed straight for the black head.
<br><br>
Compared to the big-headed monsters they had just faced, the black head was enormous and therefore, rather clumsy, which meant that for Zen, it was a sitting duck! The spear light hit the black head right between the eyebrows. A big hole appeared where it had struck and the black head immediately disappeared in the world behind the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
Zen and his companions carefully observed how the black head would react now.
<br><br>
After being hit by the Light of Annihilation, the hostility-level Treacherous Beings had disappeared directly. The effect had been surprisingly good.
<br><br>
And if luck were on their side, then this would also be the case with the black head, and Zen's spear strike would be enough to kill this resentmentlevel Treacherous Being as well.
<br><br>
However, the black head shook rapidly in the air, and the circular hole between its eyebrows quickly began to heal.
<br><br>
At the same time, two beams of red lights shot out from its eyes towards Zen once again.
<br><br>
Zen's pupils shrank, and he began to dodge like a nimble rabbit. Somehow, he was faster than those light beams.
<br><br>
The others looked on. They were facing a formidable enemy. The Pure Sky Platform itself was not that big. Even if the black head did not deliberately aim at them, there were chances that they could be hit by a stray beam which could take their lives.
<br><br>
As Zen sprinted along the Pure Sky Platform, the Holy Stone in his palm was still emitting large amounts of the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
Seizing an opportunity that he got during one of his jumps, Zen once again thrust his spear towards the black head.
<br><br>
The spear accurately reached its mark and pierced the black head, but just as before, the wound healed quickly, and the resentment-level Treacherous Being was unharmed.
<br><br>
"I am afraid that the spear doesn't work!"
<br><br>
"What do you mean? Can't the silver energy kill that black head?"
<br><br>
"No and we'd better run away now. There's no need for us to lose our lives in the effort to do so."
<br><br>
Everyone had thought that with the silver energy, Zen would be able to kill the resentment-level Treacherous Being, or at least he would be able to seriously injure it. It was beyond their imagination and also rather fearsome that even two strikes by the spear didn't do a single darned thing to the black head.
<br><br>
"Master Campbell, why is this happening?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"I... I don't know," Campbell replied hesitantly as he shook his head.
<br><br>
As nothing more than a builder of the worlds, he was not very good at fighting.
<br><br>
He did have some level of knowledge. He knew that after the creatures of the main world died, they would become Treacherous Beings and fear the Light of Annihilation. However, his knowledge did not extend to a thorough understanding of the division of strength of those Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Seeing the perplexed look on Campbell's face, Zen knew that it would be a waste of time to push him for answers. The man sincerely didn't know.
<br><br>
Also, since Zen couldn't defeat the resentment-level Treacherous Being, they had to leave. He shouted to his companions, "Look! I can't hurt this thing. Let's move towards the door and leave this place as soon as possible!"
<br><br>
The men in black robes moved the fastest when they heard that. They had been making up their minds to escape from this damned place for a long while now. By the time Zen had finished shouting, several of them were already at the door.
<br><br>
The man who was at the front grabbed the door and tried to open it, but it didn't move at all. He shouted, "The door's locked!"
<br><br>
Hearing that, the other men behind him became anxious. They rushed forward, grabbed the edge of the door and pulled it out fiercely, as if they could tear it into opening, but the door still remained tightly shut.
<br><br>
Very soon, the leader of the men in black robes, the Eternal Realm Hunters, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess all put their backs into an effort to open the door. However, the door seemed to have been locked by some kind of theurgy, and it remained unmoved.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..." When the black head saw their valiant but failed efforts, it let out a mocking laugh. "Dead end! There is no return from this point forth.
<br><br>
Since you broke into this place, you won't leave it alive."
<br><br>
Previously, the black head had spoken in Sanskrit, but this time, it was actually speaking in human tongue.
<br><br>
Buzz! As soon as it had finished its sentence, the red lights in its eyes accumulated once again and were about to shoot towards the door. This time, they would have burned everyone since they were already accumulated there in a group.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Two spear lights shot out and hit the bull's eyes, or rather, the head's eyes.
<br><br>
Both of its eyes had now been replaced by two gaping holes.
<br><br>
Its eyes were gone, and the red lights naturally dissipated. This was a clever decision, but it was still not enough.
<br><br>
Even losing both of its eyes did not seem to be a problem for it. The two holes quickly healed and became a pair of eyes once again. The head chuckled malevolently, and red lights began to brew within its eyes once again.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Zen raised his hand and stabbed the black head's eyes with the light beams once again.
<br><br>
"Agh..."
<br><br>
The black head seemed pissed at this.
<br><br>
The strongest trump card in its pocket, if it could have any, was the dazzling lights in its eyes.
<br><br>
If Zen kept on poking it in the eyes, it wouldn't have any way of fighting back. Although it didn't hurt, it was still extremely inconvenient.
<br><br>
Just as Zen had pinned down the black head, Campbell floated towards the door.
<br><br>
As a builder of the world, Campbell was not too strong, but was very familiar with the chaos, the Other Shore, and everything else that mattered to the construction of this place. When everyone saw him, they all moved aside.
<br><br>
Campbell reached out his hand and pressed it against the door. He rubbed it two times, as if to get a feel of it and then said something that shocked them all, "Something's very wrong with this door."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others couldn't understand what he meant.
<br><br>
Poking the black head with the spear light once again, Zen turned around and asked, "What do you mean?"
<br><br>
"The door has been replaced," Campbell replied.
<br><br>
"So many years have passed. Maybe the original door was rotten, so it had to be replaced," Zen suggested.
<br><br>
However, Campbell shook his head. "No, it was just replaced. There..."
<br><br>
He pointed to another Pure Sky Platform in the distance.
<br><br>
A person was standing on that Pure Sky Platform, who looked somehow exactly like the black head.
<br><br>
When the man felt the gazes of Campbell and Zen turn towards him from afar, the corners of his mouth curled up, revealing a strange smile.
<br><br>
The black head also raised the corners of its mouth, revealing the same smile as the man's. They were one! Chapter 4022 General Upon seeing Zen's and Campbell's gaze shift somewhere else, all the others followed and looked towards the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
When their eyes met the man on the Pure Sky Platform, they were shocked.
<br><br>
"Someone is there!"
<br><br>
"That person looks the same as the black head!"
<br><br>
"Who is he?"
<br><br>
Those who could stay in the Jade Pure Realm were by no means, ordinary people.
<br><br>
"Do you know him, Master Campbell?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Campbell stared at the Pure Sky Platform as if he was searching his mind for memories of this person.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the man on the Pure Sky Platform flashed a strange smile, and so did the black head. He stayed silent, allowing Campbell to think harder.
<br><br>
As a world builder, Campbell focused on building one world after another, not caring about matters of the main world. When they encountered any trouble before building a world, they only needed to call the Ten Directions House.
<br><br>
The powerful warriors sent by the Ten Directions House would tidy up the messes for them.
<br><br>
Perhaps the ones that the world builders had the most contact with were the people of the Ten Directions House.
<br><br>
After he traced back his memories, something suddenly crossed Campbell's mind. He opened his eyes wide and pointed at the person opposite him. "I remember now. You are a member of the Ten Directions House. You are General Gianni!"
<br><br>
Generals were powerful warriors in the Ten Directions House.
<br><br>
There were many troubles in the main world, large or small– if the world builders occupied the territory of some races in building a world, or if they needed to destroy the gathering places of some barbaric races, they would need the Ten Directions House to help them.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, they would not need generals to show up since the strength of ordinary warriors of the Ten Directions House was enough to solve these problems.
<br><br>
Once, a group of two hundred of them encountered the attack of the Tail Butterfly race. The two hundred builders were trapped, and the Ten Directions House sent three groups of warriors in succession but they all returned in failure. In the end, the Ten Directions House had to send six generals.
<br><br>
It was Campbell's first time seeing a general of the Ten Directions House, and this Gianni was the leader of the group at the time.
<br><br>
The six generals' strength was astonishing. All the members of the Tail Butterfly race were wiped out skillfully.
<br><br>
Although Gianni had left a deep impression on Campbell, they had only met once. The black head had Gianni's face–Campbell remembered it now.
<br><br>
"General Gianni, what exactly happened? Why had someone dared to kill us? I heard that even the Eternal Divine Courtyard has been abandoned.
<br><br>
What happened inside the Four Spirits Sect?" Campbell demanded answers one by one.
<br><br>
Campbell had been attacked by the big-head monsters, he was also attacked by the black head that was suspected to be controlled by Gianni...
<br><br>
However, in his heart, he still regarded the Human Spirit Sect as his home and the Ten Directions House as something trustworthy.
<br><br>
He could only believe a portion of Zen's words and he wanted to verify it with Gianni.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..." Gianni made a series of sounds and began to speak Sanskrit. "If I were you, I would kill all of them and then commit suicide. At least, the Whining Road is a safe place where you can still live."
<br><br>
Zen's and Campbell's faces both darkened at Gianni's words. Campbell asked again, "What do you mean by that?"
<br><br>
"You are just a builder. Why do you have so many questions?" Gianni scolded him. "You just need to do as I say. I order you as a general of the Ten Directions House!"
<br><br>
Some things had already been arranged in the first chaotic era. The reason why Gianni appeared was only to get rid of the variables to their plan.
<br><br>
The world builders weren't strong, but they were too familiar with the chaos; thus, they could be considered one of the variables. That was why they had arranged many hostility-level Treacherous Beings here.
<br><br>
Every time any world builder entered this place, they would be thrown back to the Whining Road by the hostility-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Campbell had won the battle with the hostility-level Treacherous Beings this time, which alerted Gianni.
<br><br>
The generals of the Ten Directions House were existences enjoying high status in the main world.
<br><br>
A single word from them often determined either the life or death of a large race.
<br><br>
With Campbell's status, he could only obey their orders unconditionally.
<br><br>
There was no way he dared to disobey.
<br><br>
"Kill them and commit suicide?" Campbell murmured.
<br><br>
Zen looked at Campbell calmly while he held the long spear in his hand tight. The silver-white Light of Annihilation slowly circulated the pattern of the spear's shaft, making its way to the tip. The Light of Annihilation could kill Campbell who was in the form of a Treacherous Being although he had already awakened.
<br><br>
"Master Campbell, your wish was to wake up. Do you still want to return to the Whining Road, to become a soulless Treacherous Being and drift through your life?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Campbell glanced at Zen and then looked at Gianni in the distance.
<br><br>
He thought for a while before staring at Gianni with firmness. "General Gianni, I can return to the Whining Road, but please answer my questions first. Who on earth killed us, and why?"
<br><br>
A look of contempt appeared in Gianni's eyes, the same with the eyes of the black head. "Who do you think you are? Do you think you have become a somebody after you slept for so many years?"
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
Gianni's eyes began to flicker into a blood-red light, so did the black head's eyes. It was about to launch another wave of attacks, but before the red light could shoot out–"Pop, pop!" The two beams of silver spear radiance had once again pierced through its eyes.
<br><br>
Zen placed the long spear back on his shoulder and said, "More than one thousand chaotic eras have passed, and perhaps forces like the Ten Directions House and the Human Spirit Sect no longer exist. It's better to find clues by yourself than to ask this guy!"
<br><br>
Zen's voice came from his inner world. His voice wasn't loud, but Gianni had heard him through the black head.
<br><br>
In Gianni's eyes, the others were all irrelevant creatures except for the indestructible world builders.
<br><br>
Although Zen had pierced through the eyes of the black head many times, Gianni thought it was only the Light of Annihilation which achieved such a feat, not Zen's strength.
<br><br>
"Hahaha! You think you can leave now?" Gianni asked teasingly.
<br><br>
"You wouldn't know unless we give it another try, right?" The silver light on Zen's right hand began to radiate again.
<br><br>
"A bug full of itself. I'll let you have another try..."
<br><br>
As Gianni spoke, he took two steps toward the edge of the Pure Sky Platform. Round balls began to bulge from the skin around his neck as if eggs were moving from within.
<br><br>
At the same time, the big-head monsters began to shake below the black head. They started merging and fused into a large mass that spread in all directions–gradually forming the body of a black giant! The black giant was over one hundred thousand feet tall and could cross the huge Pure Sky Platform in just ten steps.
<br><br>
In the distance, Gianni also tore his clothes as he trembled slightly. One after another, cracks appeared on the surface of his body, giving rise to countless eyes opening all over his body.
<br><br>
The black giant and Gianni moved in sync. Eyes also appeared on the surface of the black giant's body, and as they opened, the blood-red light began to gather again.
<br><br>
Chapter 4023 Seized The red light glinting in so many pairs of eyes instilled fear in everyone.
<br><br>
This red light was fatal. Anyone exposed to it would immediately be reduced to a pile of dust.
<br><br>
How could they escape a weapon that was being released and concentrated on them by so many eyes? "Back off!" Zen's face darkened at the sight of these eyes.
<br><br>
The Wing King, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, the Eternal Realm Hunters, and the people in black robes quickly stayed away from the door and retreated towards the edge of the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
They were unable to escape the red light but there was still some room for them to dodge its attacks after they had distanced themselves from the black giant.
<br><br>
Even Campbell retreated along with them.
<br><br>
Zen was the only one to have moved forward instead of retreating.
<br><br>
For the safety of the others, he had to lure the black giant to the other side of the Pure Sky Platform and finish it off.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
The presence of so many eyes took the black giant a longer time to accumulate the red light.
<br><br>
And Zen had already seized this opportunity to launch an attack.
<br><br>
"Break!" Zen shouted, jumping up.
<br><br>
His spear spun once, and came at the black giant's body.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
Zen had earlier been afraid of using up the Light of Annihilation in the Holy Stone, which was why he had tried his best to launch as accurate an attack as possible. He didn't dare waste any light.
<br><br>
And now that he had burnt his bridges, Zen couldn't care less about anything else.
<br><br>
Rays of spear radiance whooshed through space and headed straight for the black giant.
<br><br>
The black head moved at a snail's pace in the beginning, an easy target for Zen. Now that it had a body, it was a complete entity, and under Gianni's control, it was more agile than Zen had imagined it would be.
<br><br>
The spear radiance that Zen had sent out was like a white glowing net, covering the vital parts of the black giant's body. With this round of attack, Zen planned to pierce through at least twenty pairs of the black giant's eyes.
<br><br>
But the moment the spear radiance approached it, the black giant took a single step to the side.
<br><br>
Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! The spear radiance pierced through the black giant's body and created dozens of holes, but hit only one eye on its chest.
<br><br>
Zen was not surprised.
<br><br>
Gianni was by no means mediocre as a warrior from the Ten Directions House. One didn't earn Campbell's respect by being merely mediocre. It would be strange if Zen could finish off such an opponent with too much ease.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
Zen had pierced through only one of the black giant's eyes, but more eyes opened on its body. The red light that had accumulated for a long time within them spurted out of them.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...
<br><br>
About forty red light columns shot out from the black giant's body.
<br><br>
As the black giant continued to spin, the red light columns shot out randomly in all directions.
<br><br>
The light columns didn't disappear until they had extended to outside the Pure Sky Platform. No one could escape it.
<br><br>
"Disperse!" the Wing King shouted as a warning.
<br><br>
His wings flapped in the air, his strange posture making him look like water flowing towards the light columns.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others used different theurgies to dodge the light columns.
<br><br>
Squeak! Squeak...
<br><br>
King Ieuan's tiny size was an advantage that allowed it to escape easily. But no one knew where light columns would go or where they would emerge from. Sometimes, a light column seemed to be hurtling somewhere but would suddenly change direction without warning. King Ieuan was unfortunately unable to avoid the red light and was hit in the legs.
<br><br>
Its legs had already turned to ashes by the time it jumped up.
<br><br>
Pearson stretched out a hand as he saw King Ieuan fall backwards. A thin, almost invisible, spider thread wrapped around King Ieuan's body, lifting it up.
<br><br>
Pearson managed to save King Ieuan's life now. But yet another column of red light rose from his side and swept up towards him. He only had half his body left now, and his other half turned to dust.
<br><br>
Fortunately for Pearson, his body was special, having been originally woven with spider threads. His body hissed after losing half of it, following which, the disappeared half of his body returned to him, woven by the spider threads.
<br><br>
However, he was much shorter and paler than before.
<br><br>
The men in black robes were facing even worse.
<br><br>
The leader still had the power to protect himself. But his men almost had no power to resist the red light columns. If they weren't careful enough, the red light columns would find them and turn them into piles of dust.
<br><br>
The leader tried his best to save his men while dodging the columns himself but how would he make it in the face of so many red light columns coming his way? Three men in black robes had died in seconds.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Zen sprinted forward for a while before a column came for him. He lowered his body and then rolled upwards into the air.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The spear radiance transformed from the Light of Annihilation hit the black giant's legs, catching and decimating an eye on its leg.
<br><br>
Zen rose into the air again after killing the red eye. Before long, he rose tens of thousands of feet into the air to reach the same height as the black giant's head. The black giant looked at Zen and was about to send out a red light column when Zen's long spear began to shake and spear radiance once again shot out at the giant.
<br><br>
Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Zen fell down. Silver spear radiance continued to pierce through the eyes on the giant's body.
<br><br>
Although the black giant's eyes would regrow, Zen would try his best to destroy them in order to reduce the number of red light columns and also ease the pressure on the others.
<br><br>
On the other Pure Sky Platform, Gianni rolled his eyes when he saw Zen jumping up and down like a flea.
<br><br>
The human was quite fast, but that was just how the average person saw and understood it.
<br><br>
Zen was able to launch a series of attacks around the black giant because Gianni hadn't taken him seriously.
<br><br>
"What an annoying bug!" Gianni exclaimed.
<br><br>
And then, he suddenly raised his hand.
<br><br>
The black giant wasn't slower than Gianni just because of its huge size. In fact, the two of them moved almost in unison.
<br><br>
Gianni looked at the void before him and remained silent for a few seconds.
<br><br>
He then reached out in the air suddenly, grabbing at it like he was catching a fly.
<br><br>
The black giant's right hand was doing the same thing at an incredibly high speed.
<br><br>
Zen concentrated on piercing through the eyes but he was also on guard against the black giant's hand. But he was astonished, for he had never thought that the black giant, who he had assumed to be clumsy because of its huge size, could be so fast.
<br><br>
By the time he realized that the giant's hand was coming for him, it was too late. The black giant had already scooped him up in its hand.
<br><br>
"It's over now. You can go to hell."
<br><br>
Gianni's voice sounded from the black giant's mouth.
<br><br>
He was speaking the human language. Fuxi, who was still dodging the red light columns in the distance, heard him. And so did the Snake Goddess and the others. They began to panic when they saw that the black giant had seized Zen.
<br><br>
Buzz! The black giant also had an eye in its palm, and before long, the red light in it burst out of it.
<br><br>
Chapter 4024 A Human Shaped Coral As soon as Zen was caught in the palm of the black giant, he tried to break free using his long spear.
<br><br>
However, the strength of the black giant was astonishing. No matter how hard Zen struggled, it didn't budge even an inch. It continued gripping Zen's body, rendering him motionless.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The red light was activated again. This time, it was going to aim at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened as he saw the red light shining upon him. It instantly drowned and engulfed him before he could even react.
<br><br>
"No! Zen!"
<br><br>
"Damn it! It was too late!"
<br><br>
"Zen, don't die!"
<br><br>
The red light that shot out from the black giant's palm was so deadly that it could instantly turn almost everything into dust.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others saw how the red light engulfed Zen, they were all terrified.
<br><br>
Even Zen could be turned into dust with its power. Moreover, with the monstrous grip of the black giant, there was no way that he escaped.
<br><br>
Even the three Eternal Realm Hunters fell silent as they saw the scene.
<br><br>
There was no doubt that they thought so highly of Zen. He was the only reason why they got all the way here.
<br><br>
That was why they didn't expect that he would end up dying in this miserable way.
<br><br>
As they realized that even Zen could fall this way, they thought that they might also meet their end pretty soon.
<br><br>
The leader of the black-robed men stood there in a daze. He was obviously in a state of shock, but his thick robe prevented others from clearly seeing his expression.
<br><br>
Soon after, the black giant slowly opened its palm.
<br><br>
There, everyone saw the silver armor, the long spear, and some black ashes mixing with them.
<br><br>
On the other Pure Sky Platform, Gianni sneered as he saw the scene. He then tilted his hand that was stretched out slightly.
<br><br>
At the same time, the black giant that was under Gianni's control also tilted its right hand. Then, the armor, spear, and the clump of black ashes slid down from its palm and fell to the ground.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Campbell clenched his fist and bit his lip. He struggled so hard to complete his awakening, but now he was again on the verge of being killed without finding anything about the truth from the past.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! The black giant started walking, and its eyes were once again filled with the deadly red lights. At the same time, Gianni spoke in Sanskrit, "As I said earlier, it would have been less troublesome for you if you just killed yourself. Now, it's too late for that. Since you wait for me to act, I won't let you die so easily. Well, I can't totally eliminate you, but I can change your will. That way, the possibility of your awakening will be reduced, and you shall live in pain for eternity!"
<br><br>
Just when the black giant walked past the armor and the spear, the pile of ashes scattered on the ground began to move slowly.
<br><br>
The scattered ashes seemed like thousands of ants that gathered bit by bit.
<br><br>
Then, in no time, they formed into a small pyramid, which was about ten inches high.
<br><br>
On the surface of the pyramid, bright red blood slowly gushed out.
<br><br>
The blood emitted a strange and powerful aura. As the aura quickly spread, everyone's attention was attracted to it.
<br><br>
"What on earth is that?" Campbell looked at the red blood on the pyramid of ashes behind the black giant. His eyes were filled with confusion as he tried to discern what it really was.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, the Eternal Realm Hunters, and the men in black robes all stared blankly at the blood that grew out from the ashes. It was slowly taking a form of a plant's root, extending upward little by little. As it gradually formed, it almost looked like a blood coral in the sea.
<br><br>
"What the hell?"
<br><br>
Gianni walked forward and stopped at the edge of the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
He also started staring at the transforming blood that caught everyone's attention.
<br><br>
Then, he immediately felt a familiar aura coming from it.
<br><br>
'The ancestry-level bloodline?' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Before Zen entered the Three Purities Stage, he got a hold of the ancestrylevel bloodline. It dwelled in his body and gave him powerful, and sometimes, odd abilities.
<br><br>
Gianni was also familiar with the power of the ancestry-level bloodline, but he didn't know what ability this was.
<br><br>
Why was there a tremendous amount of aura from it? Gianni thought all about it and became more confused.
<br><br>
'What is this growing blood-red coral? Don't tell me—' Before Gianni could finish his thoughts, the blood-red coral sort of sped up its transformation.
<br><br>
It continued to grow until finally forming a human-shaped coral.
<br><br>
As the human-shaped coral stood on top of the pyramid of ashes, it suddenly started absorbing all of the ashes beneath it.
<br><br>
At the same time, the human-shaped coral also reached out and grabbed both the silver armor and the long spear on the ground. The armor quickly clung to the surface of its body and it held the long spear in its hand.
<br><br>
Finally, the cubic stone wrapped with cracks returned to its hand, and the Light of Annihilation began to flow in its hand.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! In an instant, the armor and spear restored their silver luster.
<br><br>
"What is this kind of monster?" Gianni couldn't believe what he was seeing.
<br><br>
"He already turned into ashes, but he could still return to his original shape…"
<br><br>
"Is this Zen's ability?"
<br><br>
Everyone was in a daze as if seeing a miracle unfolding in their eyes again.
<br><br>
During the battle at the Pear Hill, everyone clearly witnessed the prowess of Zen's ability. He could change into almost anything and suppress even the most powerful enemies.
<br><br>
But even so, no one expected this time that he would just rise from the ashes as if nothing happened.
<br><br>
They knew how powerful he was, but they still couldn't figure out how his ability worked.
<br><br>
Everyone who was witnessing Zen's surprising ability was even more shocked.
<br><br>
That included Campbell, who was still filled with disbelief.
<br><br>
Those who had been baptized by the ancestry-level bloodline were known to be very powerful.
<br><br>
Even being turned into ashes wouldn't kill Zen.
<br><br>
Gianni was gazing at the scene through the black giant for a long time now, but he still didn't understand what was going on.
<br><br>
He didn't know that the blood that transformed into the human-shaped coral was the ancestry-level bloodline itself.
<br><br>
He grew pissed at the thought that Zen completely withstood his strength and power.
<br><br>
"I don't know what you have experienced in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
Honestly, with such a unique ability, you're qualified to join the Ten Directions House. Unfortunately, you were not born at the right time!"
<br><br>
Gianni lashed out as he slapped the ground with his hand.
<br><br>
Then, the black giant did the same and slapped the human-shaped coral on the ground.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The deadly red light burst out from the black giant's palm and enveloped the human-shaped coral.
<br><br>
In the distance, the Snake Goddess took a deep breath and focused her eyes at the palm of the giant without blinking.
<br><br>
Then, the red light gradually dissipated. At the same time, the humanshaped coral also disappeared on the ground.
<br><br>
Soon after, everyone noticed that red corals were flickering on the surface of the black giant's arm. It was like they formed several meridians extending from its wrist up to its shoulder.
<br><br>
In addition to the red corals, there were also white bolts of lightning that flashed from time to time. It turned out that these were the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
Immediately after, the red and white lights intertwined and spread along its entire arm. In just a flash, its humongous arm collapsed.
<br><br>
Because Gianni was directly linked with the black giant, he instantly felt the pain in his right arm with the collapse of the giant's arm. "Aaargh! What did he do?!" He let out a painful scream as his face contorted.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the red and white lights continued their assault and drilled into the body of the black giant this time. Gianni quickly held his chest as he felt like there was a piping hot iron stirring up his internal organs.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! With the power of the red and white lights, the giant's body collapsed and disappeared too.
<br><br>
Finally, they aimed and drilled into its head.
<br><br>
"No, no, no!"
<br><br>
Gianni clearly saw what the lights were after this time. He screamed furiously as he started feeling a sharp and piercing sensation in his skull.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for Gianni, he couldn't just undo his link with the black giant.
<br><br>
It was purposely made in complexity, so it would take time to break it.
<br><br>
With that, he had no choice but to endure the severe pain brought by the red and white lights.
<br><br>
Chapter 4025 Another Accident Gianni's wail echoed for a few seconds. At last, the black giant had finally collapsed.
<br><br>
Its huge body completely disappeared, and a human-shaped coral slowly descended from midair. When it reached the ground, its armor and spear fell off with a loud clatter.
<br><br>
Everyone stared at the human-shaped coral uneasily.
<br><br>
Could this be Zen? Not long after, strands of tissue and muscle started to grow on the humanshaped coral.
<br><br>
They intertwined with each other to form muscles and bones, and then layers of flesh rapidly formed, till finally the human-shaped coral transformed back into Zen.
<br><br>
When she realized it was indeed Zen, the Snake Goddess sighed in relief.
<br><br>
Just now, she had been so nervous that she didn't realize she was holding her breath. Now, she could rest easy.
<br><br>
The three Eternal Realm Hunters' jaws dropped in shock. They could not understand what was going on.
<br><br>
They had seen many unique and magical creatures in their time, but they had never encountered such a powerful creature with such a strange form.
<br><br>
Campbell was the first to step forward.
<br><br>
Back then, on the Whining Road, he had instinctively chosen Zen's physical body because he had a feeling that Zen was stronger than the people around him.
<br><br>
After awakening, Campbell knew he made the right choice. After all, Zen was a talent who could be chosen to enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
However, even now Campbell kept discovering that he constantly underestimated Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's bloodline power must've been far stronger than he ever imagined.
<br><br>
"Your ability comes from the life quadrant of the ancestry-level bloodline, right? Such a powerful recovery ability may be the combination of several abilities in the life quadrant. You might even be a general of the Ten Directions House!" Campbell exclaimed excitedly.
<br><br>
In his eyes, the generals of the Ten Directions House were invincible.
<br><br>
And it was true. No matter what trouble the world builders encountered, as long as the Ten Directions House sent their generals out, there was no problem that couldn't be solved.
<br><br>
This was also the reason why Campbell was so respectful to Gianni.
<br><br>
"The life quadrant?" Zen thought for a moment. "Maybe..."
<br><br>
When he was enveloped in the red light, he felt the ancestry-level bloodline surging within him.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was not under Zen's control. At the beginning, it analyzed the information contained in the fluctuation and passed it to him.
<br><br>
When he came into contact with any energy, the ancestry-level bloodline would also analyze it and then gave him the energy to restrain it.
<br><br>
However, over time, the ancestry-level bloodline started to become cold to him. Now, if it wasn't a fatal threat, it wouldn't offer any help.
<br><br>
Just now, Zen fought the black giant head on because he wanted to activate the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Campbell didn't ask Zen more questions about his bloodline. He turned around and looked at the other Pure Sky Platform. "But what on earth has General Gianni gone through? Why has he become so violent? Why is he so intent on throwing me back to the Whining Road?"
<br><br>
"The situation must be more complicated than you think," Zen said with a shrug.
<br><br>
On the Pure Sky Platform in the distance, Gianni was freed from the extreme pain, and his face darkened.
<br><br>
Campbell had awakened by accident, which was why Gianni rushed over.
<br><br>
However, that wasn't the only accident that happened. A lowly human had managed to kill a resentment-level Treacherous Being! How inconceivable! The Human Spirit Sect and the Ten Directions House always welcomed extraordinary talents, which was also the foundation for their growth.
<br><br>
However, some human spirits, like Gianni, looked down upon the human beings from the secondary worlds. In their eyes, although these human beings had inherited their looks and were very close to them in many aspects, they were still inferior.
<br><br>
And yet, that human was able to not only kill a resentment-level Treacherous Being, but also was reborn unharmed! How did he do it? What magic did he use? A mass of black material floated up from the Pure Sky Platform where Zen and his companions were.
<br><br>
It was a remaining part of the black giant.
<br><br>
Then, the black material changed shape in accordance with Gianni's hand movements. Soon, it formed the shape of Gianni's head.
<br><br>
The head was about the same size as an ordinary head, and the aura of Treacherous Being contained within it was very weak.
<br><br>
The space of the Three Purities Stage was very special. Both energies and materials would disappear after they left the Pure Sky Platforms. Sounds worked similarly. Thus, this was the only way Gianni could use to transmit his voice.
<br><br>
"How many light pillars have you triggered in the Eternal Divine Courtyard? Which light pillars are they?" Gianni asked.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had three hundred and seventy-three abilities, and they could combine with each other to create many other abilities. The Four Spirits Sect had studied the ancestry-level bloodline for such a long time, but they were still unable to completely figure out its abilities.
<br><br>
The ability that Zen had displayed was very powerful, so Gianni wanted to figure it out.
<br><br>
"Sorry, I can't tell you that," Zen replied bluntly.
<br><br>
Gianni's expression hardened. "Aren't you afraid of death?"
<br><br>
"Maybe," Zen replied honestly.
<br><br>
Gianni's expression softened at his words. "You are of great value to us. I can spare your life, but you have to kill everyone else."
<br><br>
Hearing this, Campbell raised his eyebrows indignantly.
<br><br>
The others couldn't understand what Gianni was saying, but seeing Campbell's expression made them nervous.
<br><br>
Zen restrained his temper. With a smile, he asked, "Us? Who do you refer to? The Ten Directions House? Or the Human Spirit Sect?"
<br><br>
"You don't need to know too much. Just do as I say," Gianni said dismissively.
<br><br>
"Sorry, I'm not interested." With that, Zen summoned the long spear in his hand and pointed it at Gianni's head.
<br><br>
"Wait, wait!" Gianni said hurriedly. He didn't expect Zen would suddenly turn hostile.
<br><br>
However, Zen didn't give him a chance to finish his words.
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation had pierced through the floating head and it burst into a cloud of smoke.
<br><br>
The long spear then flashed and pointed straight at the opposite Pure Sky Platform. Zen smiled faintly.
<br><br>
What he was interested in was Gianni's background. Since Gianni didn't want to tell him, there was no need for them to keep talking.
<br><br>
Gianni's eyes were filled with rage. He never thought Zen would attack him like that. This made him feel like he'd been fooled, and it was a lowly human who was fooling him! "Contact the people of the Joy House and ask them to help!" Gianni ordered in a low voice.
<br><br>
A brown shadow appeared beside him. It was a kind of Treacherous Being that could transmit messages.
<br><br>
The surface of the Treacherous Being flashed for a while, and then it said, "Master Gianni, the people of the Joy House said they can't help right now.
<br><br>
The Treasure Bottle Platform is being attacked."
<br><br>
"How dare they attack the Treasure Bottle Platform?" Gianni shouted indignantly.
<br><br>
"Even the Black House has rushed there, as the Joy House asked for help,"
<br><br>
said the Treacherous Being. "They are determined. They all want to obtain the energy that was extracted."
<br><br>
Gianni's expression darkened.
<br><br>
Chapter 4026 Treasure Bottle Platform The Treasure Bottle Platform was also a Pure Sky Platform. At the center of this Pure Sky Platform, there was a treasure bottle as tall as a person, and this was how the platform had earned its name.
<br><br>
One of the Godly Ways extracted from the Ways-blending Energy had been sealed up in the treasure bottle. Its purpose was to make sure no complete Ways-blending Energy was ever loosed in the chaos.
<br><br>
Although the chance of completing the Ways-blending Energy was not significant, the feat was not impossible.
<br><br>
Should someone master the complete Ways-blending Energy, it would release terrible consequences, hence, the Treasure Bottle Platform was heavily guarded, and it was virtually impossible for anyone to break in.
<br><br>
More importantly, the secret key in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains was well-protected. It was in the possession of a few Treacherous Beings who had awakened, and it hadn't been discovered for more than one thousand chaotic eras. How had it then come to the knowledge of someone now? Gianni sensed something unusual was afoot.
<br><br>
By comparison, the world builder opposite him was insignificant...
<br><br>
"You are lucky, but you will not be allowed to leave!" Gianni coldly said as he looked at Zen. Then he turned around and walked to the center of the Pure Sky Platform where he disappeared in the sudden flash of an orange light.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen and the others witnessed Gianni's departure.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid Gianni won't let this go," said Campbell worriedly.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and said, "Let's leave here for now."
<br><br>
At this moment, everyone's attention was once again locked on that door.
<br><br>
According to Campbell, the door had been replaced without anyone noticing. This door prevented anyone who entered the Pure Sky Platform from escaping it. There would be no easy escape as it was unbreakable.
<br><br>
"Let's work together and try again. No matter what, this door is merely an object, a dead thing. I won't believe that we can't open it with our combined efforts!" Fuxi suggested.
<br><br>
Previously, the situation had been dire, and everyone had tried to use brute force to open the door, but they had failed. Now that they had taken some time to consider it, everyone present was somewhat more optimistic.
<br><br>
"Everyone, let's use this." Thurston suddenly took out a small paper bag.
<br><br>
After opening the paper bag, a small block of hardened oil appeared, which wafted with a strange fragrance.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others didn't recognize it, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes lit up. "Is this Dragon Beast Oil? It's such a large block!"
<br><br>
"Yes." Thurston nodded.
<br><br>
The Dragon Beast was known to be a creature that lived in the Divine River. Once it was killed, one could strip off its skin, open its stomach, and source this kind of oil there. Applying this rare oil to one's hands would greatly increase their strength.
<br><br>
The Dragon Beast Oil was considered a rarity in the Flaming Maple Forest.
<br><br>
After all, it wouldn't trigger any attack from the Flaming Maple Forest, and it could greatly increase one's own power.
<br><br>
This Dragon Beast Oil was therefore a treasure Thurston had cherished.
<br><br>
However, now in order to escape, he had no choice but make use of it.
<br><br>
Everyone stretched out their hands, and Thurston applied the oily substance to them.
<br><br>
Even Campbell, who was in the form of a Treacherous Being, applied some of it.
<br><br>
Once Zen applied the oil to his hands, he felt warm. Then he felt strength flow through his hands. The oil had a magical effect.
<br><br>
Once everyone had applied the oil, the leader of the men in black robes summoned a small golden statue with a human face and the body of a beast.
<br><br>
There were four round balls on its back, but three of them had been crushed. The leader said, "This treasure can double everyone's strength, but it has already been used three times. There is only one more opportunity remaining."
<br><br>
So saying, he reached out and crushed the last ball. With a crackling noise, two rays of golden light shot forth from the eyes of the golden statue.
<br><br>
As everyone stood in the halo of the golden light, they immediately felt the strength in their bodies rapidly increase! Being able to increase the power of all the warriors within the golden light by double, the golden statue was naturally no ordinary object. However, it was a pity that it would now be useless since it was used up.
<br><br>
In addition to these two treasures, the others also revealed their own treasures.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Tokens in the Three Purities Stage were naturally not ordinary. For a moment, auras of all kinds of energy circulated about in front of the door.
<br><br>
When they were in a state of readiness, everyone began to pull at the door! Facing the dragging of a terrifying force, the seemingly ordinary door began to tremble slightly.
<br><br>
"Come on, everyone. The door can't withstand much longer." Fuxi's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
As everyone's strength rapidly multiplied, the door shook more and more violently, as if it was about to collapse.
<br><br>
However, in the moment everyone anticipated the door's fall, a Sanskrit word suddenly appeared on the surface of it, and around the Sanskrit word there were intricate patterns that extended all the way to the edge of the door.
<br><br>
"Does this word mean 'seal'?" the Snake Goddess mused aloud as she looked in wonder at it.
<br><br>
The Wing King nodded. "Yes, it does."
<br><br>
Everyone present more or less knew some Sanskrit words, and they could even decipher some of the more complicated Sanskrit words. With this Sanskrit word being very simple, they easily got the meaning at a glance.
<br><br>
However, they only understood this word, but they were clueless as to the patterns on the door.
<br><br>
Campbell said to Zen, "It can't be opened. This is a sealed door, and it can't be broken by brute force alone."
<br><br>
"No matter the strength of power that is exerted on it, it can't be opened?"
<br><br>
Zen asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
Campbell nodded. "Yes, no physical power can open it."
<br><br>
Once Campbell spoke, no one relaxed at all. They had forced out almost every drop of their strength, but the door simply stabilized after the word "seal" appeared.
<br><br>
After Zen conveyed Campbell's message to everyone, the Eternal Realm Hunters and the men in black robes immediately became discouraged. The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the other Eternal Realm warriors also gave up on trying to force the door open.
<br><br>
"It's such a pity that my Dragon Beast Oil has been wasted," Thurston said regretfully.
<br><br>
The leader of the black robed men merely shrugged his shoulders. It was obvious his golden statue was even more precious.
<br><br>
"What can we do now? If we can't open the door, we will be trapped here, won't we?" King Ieuan asked.
<br><br>
"Master Campbell, is there no other way to leave here?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Studying the door for a long time, Campbell suddenly said, "Our last option is to destroy this Pure Sky Platform..."
<br><br>
"Destroy the Pure Sky Platform?" Zen repeated, aghast.
<br><br>
"Don't forget what I can do," said Campbell confidently.
<br><br>
Campbell's strength might be limited when it came to physical combat, but he was a world builder. All of the chaos had been constructed by him, so he understood the mysteries and principles within the chaos.
<br><br>
Previously, the only reason why Campbell hadn't destroyed the Pure Sky Platform was because he cared for the other world builders.
<br><br>
The other one hundred and ninety-nine builders in the Whining Road suffered the same malady as Campbell. Only once they returned here could they wake up.
<br><br>
But now, in order to leave, he had to sacrifice those considerations.
<br><br>
Facing the door, he swung about. Then he walked ten steps backwards, pointed at his feet and instructed, "Break open here."
<br><br>
Following Campbell's instruction, Zen wielded the long spear and stabbed where Campbell had pointed.
<br><br>
The ground of the Pure Sky Platform should have been impenetrable as the earlier fighting had done no damage to it.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, as Zen smashed the ground with the sharpened end of his spear, the ground cracked, revealing a rune buried within the soil.
<br><br>
Without so much as a glance at it, Campbell took another ten steps to the side and ordered, "Smash here."
<br><br>
Chapter 4027 Unfold Zen followed and smashed down per Campbell's instructions.
<br><br>
Crack! This last smash was strong enough and revealed a unique rune below.
<br><br>
Similar to the first rune, the second faced a different direction. They must be related to one another.
<br><br>
However, Campbell left out an explanation. He continued to walk in another direction, pointing at different areas on the ground, which signaled Zen to smash them open.
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack, crack...
<br><br>
Zen had created more than twenty holes in the huge Pure Sky Platform. In each hole, they found a different rune.
<br><br>
When Zen formed the last hole, Campbell lightly pressed the rune inside. A ray of faint yellow light reflected out in response to Campbell's touch.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the runes in the other holes lit up one after another. Once they were all glowing with yellow light, the ground trembled.
<br><br>
Bang! A muffled sound echoed from the inside of the Pure Sky Platform as if something had just opened within it.
<br><br>
Just then, the Pure Sky Platform slowly rotated. The stone pillars that held the armors rose one by one. At the same time, a noticeable crack appeared right at the center of the Pure Sky Platform that revealed the inside of the platform. Within the shell-like structure were patterns and complex structures.
<br><br>
"The Pure Sky Platform is so ingenious," Fuxi praised.
<br><br>
"Just like the mechanical devices below the Myriad Pagoda Mountains."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded in appreciation and then looked at Campbell.
<br><br>
"These things were probably crafted by the world builders."
<br><br>
"Whatever! I'm more interested in the armors! Squeak!" King Ieuan squealed, mesmerized by the display of armors within the stone pillars.
<br><br>
The first time they saw the armors and weapons, their interest was immediately piqued.
<br><br>
However, Campbell warned that the armors and weapons were protected by powerful restrictions. Afterward, they lost interest and focused on the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Now that the entire Pure Sky Platform had unfolded, King Ieuan grew interested to obtain the armors and weapons.
<br><br>
"Zen, can we take some armors and weapons with us? Squeak!" asked King Ieuan excitedly.
<br><br>
If they utilized these weapons, they could also rely on the Light of Annihilation to get rid of the Treacherous Beings once and for all.
<br><br>
After pausing to think, Zen responded, "Master Campbell, these are useless if they remain here. May my friends have some? It would surely be an advantage and added protection if we go against the Treacherous Beings again."
<br><br>
As long as they could make use of the Light of Annihilation, everyone could defend themselves against the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Hearing Zen's request, Campbell turned around and looked at him intently.
<br><br>
Though the two were at an understanding, Campbell still doubted if he and Zen were on the same side. This could also be due to his confusion with his future. As a builder of the world, he was originally a member of the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Having no idea what happened to his sect and why the Ten Directions House attacked him, he was full of anxiety and fear. This led him to question Zen and everyone around him, too.
<br><br>
At this point, Campbell was confused and troubled for a very long time.
<br><br>
"Do you still doubt our intention and background?" Zen asked as he noticed Campbell's sudden sadness.
<br><br>
"Yes," Campbell replied with a sigh.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "I also do not know where you stand, but do not fear. Though you are confused now, we can help you find the truth. We will cooperate with you before we are sure of your standpoint."
<br><br>
Seeing the sincerity in Zen's expression, Campbell nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
"You know, it doesn't matter whether I take a standpoint or not. If the Four Spirits Sect was really destroyed as you said, world builders like me have no place in the world. We are useless, hopeless, and abandoned."
<br><br>
It took Campbell more than a thousand chaotic eras to wake up. Since then, he'd grown weary and depressed.
<br><br>
"You belittle yourself." Zen shook his head. "If you are truly forgotten, the Ten Directions House wouldn't have sent people here, and Gianni wouldn't have rushed over!"
<br><br>
Zen's words comforted Campbell. "The armors and weapons cannot be given to anyone. The other world builders need these items when they wake."
<br><br>
The world builders journeyed far to the Pure Sky Platform to fulfill their wishes. As much as the others wanted them, the weapons and armors were necessary for awakening. They were not for Campbell to give away.
<br><br>
"Not to worry. The armors and weapons are not the sources of the Light of Annihilation," said Campbell as he pointed towards the bottom of the stone pillar. "That is where important things lie. Please, take them out."
<br><br>
Puzzled, Zen walked towards the stone pillar and reached out his hand to feel for the bottom of the pillar.
<br><br>
He pulled out a palm-sized cubic stone from below, which had a grain of white sand embedded at the center. Zen brought it back to Campbell and held it out. "What's this?"
<br><br>
"This is a Holy Stone, but a small one," Campbell said with a smile. "The Light of Annihilation in the armors and weapons comes from this grit-like Holy Stone."
<br><br>
Zen was unaware of this before, and his jaw dropped at Campbell's last line.
<br><br>
A Holy Stone the size of a grit could provide loads of Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
As he recalled, the Holy Stone snatched away from Les was a hundred times larger; no wonder the Light of Annihilation constantly flowed from it.
<br><br>
"The Light of Annihilation in these Holy Stones is replenished after it is used up. This is a powerful weapon against the Treacherous Beings, and everyone here can take one for themselves," Campbell said as he gestured towards the pillars.
<br><br>
After Zen told everyone what Campbell had said, their eyes widened in excitement, especially the three Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation restrained Treacherous Beings better than any other method. No doubt it was a good weapon for the warriors to have.
<br><br>
With Campbell's permission, each of the others carefully took out a stone from the bottom of the stone pillar.
<br><br>
Once Campbell imparted the method of activating the Light of Annihilation to all of them, they put their stones away for safekeeping.
<br><br>
Afterward, Campbell observed the center of the Pure Sky Platform and spotted a wall beside the unfolded area. "It's time to leave here. Just need to break the wall."
<br><br>
Within a second, Zen flew forward and threw a heavy punch at the center of the wall.
<br><br>
Boom! The wall immediately collapsed with a bang and revealed a small passageway. It was so short that the ceiling of the tunnel was the height of their hips.
<br><br>
Zen bent down and drilled into the passageway. They all moved forward, but at around two hundred feet, they were met with another wall. Zen did not hesitate and threw another punch.
<br><br>
Boom! Once the wall collapsed, they were met with a large, luxurious pool.
<br><br>
They exited the passage one after another. When they saw the pool and the bronze statues again, they all took a breath of relief.
<br><br>
After the battle, the Eternal Realm warriors and the Eternal Realm Hunters did not suffer much loss. They were quite lucky to have done so.
<br><br>
However, more than half of the black-robed men were killed.
<br><br>
These men in black robes had a grudge against their leader. They risked their lives to follow Zen but inherited no benefits. Besides, many of them ended up being injured or dead for no reason.
<br><br>
However, the leader of the black-robed men comforted them, which allowed them to calm down eventually.
<br><br>
With the help of Zen, they had obtained the six-headed eagles' eggs, which meant that they saved the entire Night Being race. Because of this, they were indebted to Zen.
<br><br>
Moreover, they all obtained a piece of Holy Stone that they treated like a treasure. If they were faced with the Treacherous Beings again, they were prepared this time.
<br><br>
Chapter 4028 Reinforcement At the edge of the Freezing Wilderness, there were two crystal-like ice frogs sleeping more than a hundred feet deep underground.
<br><br>
This certain species of ice frogs was very rare. As long as there was no external factor that would awaken them, they could continuously sleep for about a thousand years.
<br><br>
Thus, they were considered as one of the most popular Other Shore Tokens that could be found in the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Crack! Suddenly, a powerful force was digging from above. The huge vibration caused by it awakened the ice frogs.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A white mist was released from their bodies. This mist was of extremely low temperature. It could not only form a protective layer on their bodies, but also freeze the surrounding enemies to death.
<br><br>
However, the digger from above, who was a fire spirit from the Element Spirit race, didn't have a hint of fear for the deadly white mist.
<br><br>
As the white mist surged up the hole that he was digging, the fire spirit just let out a mocking laugh. In an instant, his blazing flames dispersed all of the white mist.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The ravaging flames from the fire spirit poured into the pit and mercilessly melted the ice frogs and their protective barriers.
<br><br>
"Hmm. They're not here. Maybe I'll continue digging westward," the fire spirit informed.
<br><br>
The snow that had been piled up for countess years near the snow line to the east of the Freezing Wilderness had completely disappeared, thanks to the fire spirit. It now revealed a layer of frozen black earth, which was also dug open.
<br><br>
The members of the Element Spirit race continued to dig deeper.
<br><br>
At the same time, Claire floated in the air and was overseeing the digging process. "Can't you find them in such a large area?"
<br><br>
The Holy Wings Armor that was floating beside Claire was actually controlled by Gavyn. He then looked into the black ground and asked, "Is it possible that they entered the Wilderness of No Return?"
<br><br>
Hearing Gavyn's question, Claire narrowed her eyes and there was a hint of caution on her face.
<br><br>
It was true that the snow line had been erased before she arrived. Thus, she thought there was a possibility that Gavyn was correct.
<br><br>
"It makes sense, but were they that stupid to really do it? They couldn't come back if they entered that place. Weren't they afraid of death?" Claire was still suspicious of the suggestion.
<br><br>
"We don't know that yet. There's a possibility that they can find a special road in the Wilderness of No Return," Gavyn speculated. "I can at least give it a try."
<br><br>
With that, he gently raised his hand and a door formed by blue lights immediately appeared above the palm of the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Several fist-sized fire spirits were released from the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
Upon closer inspection, these fire spirits were still in their childhood.
<br><br>
Since their intelligence was not high enough, they couldn't decide for themselves yet and they would just follow orders.
<br><br>
Upon seeing that Gavyn was about to send several young fire spirits into the Wilderness of No Return, Claire lashed at him, "What do you think you're doing? Do you have to sacrifice that large number of fire spirits?"
<br><br>
"What are you so mad about? It's so easy to produce them. You could give birth to millions of these spirits in the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
What's there to lose?" Gavyn sneered as he shrugged his shoulders. The Holy Wings Armor immediately made the sound of metal rubbing against each other.
<br><br>
"You bastard..." Claire's face darkened. She couldn't utter another word upon hearing his reasoning. She began to regret helping Gavyn take control of the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
It was true that Claire could produce millions of fire spirits. However, in her eyes, no matter how weak the fire spirits were, they were still members of the Element Spirit race. They weren't mere tools.
<br><br>
But Gavyn's perspective was different. In his mind, these young fire spirits were just a bunch of flames that couldn't think on their own. And he could use them however he wanted to attain his goal.
<br><br>
At Gavyn's order, the fire spirits crowded against one another. They excitedly gathered and formed a huge flame.
<br><br>
As the huge flame reached the edge of the snow line, it quickly rushed into the Wilderness of No Return.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Phew! Phew! Phew! Gavyn's plan was simple and straightforward. If they found the road that they were looking for, they could return, but if not, they would die.
<br><br>
With that, the first fire spirit rushed into the Wilderness of No Return without hesitation.
<br><br>
It kept running forward until it exhausted all of its energy. Eventually, its flame was extinguished.
<br><br>
One by one, fire spirits continuously jumped out of the huge flame and rushed into the Wilderness of No Return.
<br><br>
From afar, it could be seen that there was a slanted flame line spreading forward, which looked very shocking.
<br><br>
"Those humans destroyed the snow line. If they entered from a particular part of the snow line, we will definitely find that road," Gavyn said confidently.
<br><br>
Claire also knew that this method would work. However, she was against it knowing that several fire spirits would needlessly die.
<br><br>
Whoosh! More and more fire spirits rushed into the Wilderness of No Return. Gavyn felt that they were getting closer and closer to the road that they were looking for.
<br><br>
Soon the fire spirits had reached a point that was just ten miles away from the road.
<br><br>
Then, there were just five miles to go.
<br><br>
Three miles to go.
<br><br>
When they were only about a mile from that road, it seemed that there was no fire spirit left to rush into the Wilderness of No Return.
<br><br>
"Wow, they were all used up. Release some more!" At Gavyn's command, the Holy Wings Armor opened a door formed by blue lights once more.
<br><br>
This time, a mass of bright blue thunder spirits had come out. These spirits continuously crackled and also began to gather to form a huge source of a thunderbolt.
<br><br>
There was no stopping Gavyn. The Holy Wings Armor was under his control, so he would use every member of the Element Spirit race if needed, just to fulfill his goal.
<br><br>
Just when Gavyn was about to give the order to the thunder spirits, a familiar voice suddenly sounded in his and Claire's minds.
<br><br>
"Claire, Slade, you need to come back," the Eye Spirit said.
<br><br>
Hearing the message, both of their expressions became serious.
<br><br>
If the Eye Spirit was summoning them urgently, it only meant that there was a serious situation going on.
<br><br>
"What happened?" Claire asked straightforwardly.
<br><br>
"The Nihility race is attacking the Treasure Bottle Platform," the Eye Spirit answered briefly.
<br><br>
She was greatly shocked at what she heard. "Those bastards, how dare they?!" she yelled in anger.
<br><br>
On the surface, the Element Spirit Civilization was battling against the Nihility race on the Other Shore. But the truth was, there were two more powerful forces behind them.
<br><br>
The Treasure Bottle Platform had always been heavily guarded by the Element Spirit Civilization. But in fact, the powerful Treacherous Beings were also there. Since the Nihility race dared to make a move, they must be pretty confident.
<br><br>
"Come back right now. We need reinforcements," the Eye Spirit ordered.
<br><br>
Naturally, it was an urgent command that couldn't be disobeyed.
<br><br>
So, Gavyn raised his hand and ordered the thunder spirits to return to the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
Claire also informed the other members of the Element Spirit race that were looking for Zen and his companions in the Freezing Wilderness. After all of the members had gathered and returned to the Holy Wings Armor, an authoritative voice sounded. "Hand over the control of the Holy Wings Armor, Gavyn."
<br><br>
The search for Zen and the others was just a special case. Since all the elders of the Element Spirit race had left, Gavyn was tasked to control the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
But now that all the members of the Element Spirit race had returned and merged into Slade again, they had to ask Gavyn to hand over the control of the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
"It's not necessary right now. Didn't you hear that the matter was urgent?"
<br><br>
Gavyn replied.
<br><br>
He was actually yearning to control the Holy Wings Armor for a long time now, so he wouldn't just give it back so easily.
<br><br>
The collective consciousness inside Slade answered, "Yes, the matter's urgent. That's why you need to obey the order. Claire, do you think—"
<br><br>
Gavyn let out a cold snort, and Slade's voice suddenly stopped.
<br><br>
The internal world of the Holy Wings Armor was now controlled by Gavyn, so it was just easy for him to block their voices.
<br><br>
"I said it was not the time for that. Let's go!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Gavyn spread out the wings of the Holy Wings Armor and quickly flew forward.
<br><br>
Claire soared in the sky and looked at the back of the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
She kind of knew what Gavyn was thinking. Her eyes narrowed as she flew closely behind.
<br><br>
Chapter 4029 Giants In The River Zen and his group returned to the pool and started to crawl along the long fishing rods.
<br><br>
When they reached the end of the rods, they then clasped the hooks with their fingers, swinging themselves down.
<br><br>
In the lead were Zen, Campbell, and Fuxi. Soon after, they returned to the cave.
<br><br>
The moment they stepped inside, they were stunned to find a huge pile of green crystals that filled the entire cave.
<br><br>
The abundance of crystals completely blocked the way in.
<br><br>
"What the hell is that?!" King Ieuan exclaimed in its surprise.
<br><br>
Taking a step forward, Fuxi gently tapped on them. Examining them cautiously, he commented, "This stuff is so dense. I'm afraid it won't be easy to break—"
<br><br>
Before he could finish the statement, the Snake Goddess interrupted him.
<br><br>
"These crystals must be the Regal Jades from the Wing King's body. He was the last one to head up, so this must have been arranged by him to cover our rear."
<br><br>
"I think so," Zen agreed with a smile.
<br><br>
While the Wing King never mentioned it to him outright, Zen was rather familiar with these Regal Jades.
<br><br>
Once the black-robed men and the Eternal Realm Hunters followed suit and swung down, the Wing King was the last to return.
<br><br>
For the most part, he remained silent, bringing up the rear.
<br><br>
Walking to the pile of Regal Jades, he stretched out his wings and flapped at them. With that, the solid green crystals quickly melted like wax before fire and flowed toward the Wing King's body.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before he absorbed them all. Once he did, he stepped aside, remaining silent as usual.
<br><br>
In the past, the Regal Jade Civilization suffered a miserable failure when they developed a festering feud with the Nihility race. Ever since they encountered Zen in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen, the Wing King favored Zen's superior talent, entrusting the hope of the entire Regal Jade Civilization to him.
<br><br>
And never had he regretted the choice, not even now. Zen had never disappointed him — instead, he greatly exceeded each and every expectation the Wing King had for him. Naturally, the latter was willing to devote himself to the man.
<br><br>
Once they left the cave, they returned along the path of the Wilderness of No Return.
<br><br>
The cave's exit stood close to the Divine River, only about thirty feet away.
<br><br>
Previously, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been rather confident that this path would intersect with the Divine River. If they managed to enter it, he would have liked to dig into the soil for treasures.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the cave leading to the Jade Pure Realm was the end of the path. Eventually, he had to relinquish the idea of entering the Divine River.
<br><br>
The minute they stepped out of the cave, the strange sight in the river had them all astonished.
<br><br>
Normally, the water in the Divine River was a dark-green color — the color of the Soul Interdicting Water which was preventive against Other Shore warriors from leaving the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The water's color never changed, save for when shoals of Golden Bites swam across the river, their bright scales illuminating the water with a golden shine.
<br><br>
But now, the water was dark red, emitting a strong smell of blood that spread across the river.
<br><br>
"How did the Divine River end up like this?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who happened to be the most interested in the Divine River, muttered to himself.
<br><br>
"It's the smell of blood," said the Snake Goddess, taking a whiff of the air.
<br><br>
"I don't know whose blood it is but it seems to have been flowing in the river for a long time. It's beginning to decay…"
<br><br>
Apart from the smell of blood, another rotten odor was coming from the river.
<br><br>
"Have you ever seen the Divine River like this?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Both the leader of the black-robed men and the Eternal Realm Hunters shook their heads vigorously.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunters were rather knowledgeable, having been around the Divine River for a long time. But even they were stumped — they had never seen it like this.
<br><br>
"A battle happened at the upper reaches of the river," Campbell suddenly remarked.
<br><br>
Only Zen could understand his language, but as soon as he opened his mouth, everyone tuned in attentively. They knew he was a world builder, after all — nobody in the entire chaos could know more about it than him.
<br><br>
"Do the upper reaches refer to the main Pure Sky Platform?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Earlier, Campbell had told him that the main Pure Sky Platform was the real Jade Pure Realm. In the end, he surmised that the upper reaches of the Divine River indeed lay in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
To his surprise, Campbell shook his head. "That's not necessarily the case.
<br><br>
When we planned the Divine River's basin, we led its water from the main Pure Sky Platform to some other smaller ones which made it meander several times…"
<br><br>
"The smaller Pure Sky Platforms? But they're not connected to each other.
<br><br>
How could they become the Divine River's basin?" Zen asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"We used a special method, of course," Campbell said proudly. Once he got onto the subject of his major, there was no holding him back. "It's a permanent combination of different spaces. It's only in this way that we managed to put the completed Divine River into them..."
<br><br>
As Campbell continued introducing the mechanism, Thurston suddenly pointed to the distance and shouted, "Look there! Something is flowing along the Divine River!"
<br><br>
Immediately, everyone turned to where he was pointing. An enormous figure was floating on the surface of the blood-red Divine River — it was flowing rapidly toward them.
<br><br>
When it got closer, they finally got a clear look.
<br><br>
It was a giant's corpse, lying on his side in the water.
<br><br>
The giant seemed to have been ruthlessly skinned — one half of him soaked in the water while the other half floated on the surface.
<br><br>
Half of his exposed face was swollen from all the soaking, one of his eyes wide open with anger — he seemed to have died a highly resentful death.
<br><br>
On the giant's dead body hopped a flock of crows, pecking at his rotten flesh.
<br><br>
Each of the crows only had a single eye. Despite their small size, they exuded an indescribably evil aura — it was somewhat akin to the Treacherous Beings' aura, but not quite the same.
<br><br>
Soon, the one-eyed crows noticed Zen and the others on the shore.
<br><br>
As it turned out, the crows looked more interested in fresh prey than a rotten corpse.
<br><br>
With a loud caw… One of the crows took the lead and flew away from the Divine River, heading straight for Zen's group.
<br><br>
But just as it reached about ten feet, an invisible force suddenly wrapped around its body, dragging it forward against its will. Failing to return to the river, it went straight into the depths of the Wilderness of No Return.
<br><br>
The same thing happened to the rest of the crows. Once they left the range of the Divine River, all of them were affected by the mysterious power, reluctantly flying toward opposite directions.
<br><br>
Everyone heaved a sigh of relief at the sight. Their nerves had been going wild because the one-eyed crows seemed to be highly powerful creatures of the Jade Pure Realm. Nobody knew what abilities they possessed nor did they have any idea how difficult it would be to deal with them.
<br><br>
When Zen asked Campbell if he knew of these Other Shore creatures, the latter only shook his head in reply.
<br><br>
While it was true that he was a world builder, he already left to find the next suitable spot once the previous world was completed. Because of this, he knew little of the later developments in the secondary worlds. Without having experienced much of the chaos' development, he could only offer so much information.
<br><br>
For a while longer, they lingered on the bank of the Divine River.
<br><br>
In a short period of time, they witnessed six more dead giants flowing down along the river. With that, they concluded that the river must have turned red because of the great amount of blood from the giants.
<br><br>
Whoever had killed them, though, remained an enigma to them.
<br><br>
After taking the time to observe the area, they returned along the same path they had come. Encountering no obstacles in the wilderness, they found the journey back was rather smooth.
<br><br>
But when they arrived at the snowline, much to their surprise, they found an area of bare brown earth.
<br><br>
Chapter 4030 Divide Into Two Groups Eastern Emperor Taiyi gazed around him, frowning. "If memory serves me right, this should be a thick snow field," he muttered.
<br><br>
The field was brown and completely devoid of any snow.
<br><br>
All the ground within a radius of several miles was sunken to a depth of over a hundred feet.
<br><br>
It seemed clear what had happened. The Element Spirit Civilization had dug far and wide into the depths of this former snow field.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess shrugged, looking unperturbed. She said, "The Shadow Marks can last for five days. Although the Shadow Warriors didn't monitor us directly, it wouldn't have been difficult to find this place using the marks."
<br><br>
After entering that road in the Wilderness of No Return, the Snake Goddess had used her shadow to destroy the snow line.
<br><br>
In hindsight, it seemed to have been a wise decision. Otherwise, they would be blocked halfway by the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
They carefully observed their surroundings, keeping a sharp lookout for anyone from the Element Spirit Civilization. After they had ensured that they were alone, they crossed the snow line and returned to the Freezing Wilderness.
<br><br>
Immediately, the body of the Wing King began to expand. His humanshaped figure transformed into the form of a giant hawk, with a wingspan at least several hundred feet wide. He spread his wings and the group of people clambered onto his back, whereupon he soared into the open sky above the Freezing Wilderness.
<br><br>
When they were about a third of the way across the Freezing Wilderness, the leader of the black-robed men turned to Zen. He bid him goodbye and thanked him one last time.
<br><br>
Previously, he had decided to follow Zen as far as he could in order to repay him. Moreover, although their race had always lived in the Dark Region, they had a great relationship with humans.
<br><br>
While they had been able to offer some help during the fray, the leader was very clear that the true strength of the Night Being race could only be displayed in the Dark Region. Once they reached the Light Region, it would be difficult for them to fight against enemies. Indeed, they would only be a burden.
<br><br>
Before leaving, the leader gave Zen a piece of black silk. He explained that it was a way for Zen to call upon them for assistance—should the silk be torn anywhere in the Dark Region, the Night Being race would instantly know his location. Zen acknowledged the gesture, and the black-robed man left with his remaining clansmen.
<br><br>
After they departed, the Wing King spread his wings and rose once more over the vast Freezing Wilderness.
<br><br>
Occasionally, they caught sight of a few creatures in the snow below them.
<br><br>
The creatures watched and pointed at the group flying in the sky, their faces filled with malice, as though they would attack them if given the chance.
<br><br>
However, the Wing King flew too swiftly for anyone to catch them. Before they could take action, he had turned into a green light and escaped far away.
<br><br>
Campbell stared out across the vast expanse of white snow. His eyes were hooded, but there was a glimmer of sadness in them. He had always wanted to awaken, but unexpectedly, he had been abandoned after awakening. For a long while he was silent as they flew. Then suddenly, he leaned closer to Zen and asked, "Can you tell me about what happened in the past? Can you tell me what history you know over the past thousand chaotic eras?"
<br><br>
Zen did not look surprised at the sudden questions. He nodded and gave Campbell an overview of the chaos history he was familiar with. Of course, there was some sensitive information that he kept to himself.
<br><br>
Campbell listened closely. When Zen was done, he asked, "So the two strongest forces in the chaos are the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race?"
<br><br>
"Exactly," Zen replied, nodding.
<br><br>
"Yet they are only puppets, controlled by unknown forces with their own ulterior motives," Campbell remarked disapprovingly.
<br><br>
Zen raised an eyebrow, considering Campbell's statement. He said, "I think so too."
<br><br>
Zen himself had not realized this before entering the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
As he got to know the Treacherous Beings and met Gianni of the Ten Directions House, he had learned more about the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race. In reality, their backgrounds were quite complicated, and a far cry from the simple history he had imagined.
<br><br>
"You are all alone with no reinforcements. It's really surprising that you have come this far," Campbell observed, turning his head to look at the Eternal Realm warriors on the back of the Wing King.
<br><br>
Although Campbell had not been very strong back then, he was clear about the strength of this group of Eternal Realm warriors. It was impossible for them to fight against the forces behind the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race.
<br><br>
"That's right," Zen agreed. He decided to take the opportunity to request help from Campbell. "I hope that you can help us complete the Finale Way and prevent the chaos from being destroyed again."
<br><br>
The chaos had been destroyed repeatedly because the Four Spirits Sect needed to extract energy from it.
<br><br>
Campbell lowered his head, saying nothing. After several moments of contemplation, he said, "If you are correct that the Four Spirits Sect has been exterminated, then it is indeed meaningless to continue destroying the chaos. I can help you to figure out the truth, but I must also save my companions from the Whining Road. I need to awaken them."
<br><br>
"We will awaken them. I believe it can be done without any trouble," Zen said with a confident smile.
<br><br>
Zen and his group had gained a preliminary understanding of the Treacherous Beings from his communications with the leader of the blackrobed men on the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were divided into several types in accordance with their different wishes. For instance, those on the Whining Road belonged to the attaching type. They sought to possess other living beings in order to go to the Pure Sky Platform and retrieve everything they'd had before their death. If they were successful in completing this goal, they would naturally awaken.
<br><br>
Thus, they only needed to send some creatures into the Whining Road and allow the Treacherous Beings to possess them. The Treacherous Beings would wake up after they went to the Pure Sky Platform to get what they wanted.
<br><br>
Zen turned to the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others. He told them, "Master Campbell wishes to awaken his companions."
<br><br>
They knew Campbell was referring to the one hundred and ninety-nine Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road.
<br><br>
"Wake them up, you say?" said King Ieuan. It mulled over the idea.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess was thinking quickly, formulating a plan.
<br><br>
She said, "In that case, we must capture one hundred and ninety-nine creatures on the Other Shore. We will bring them into the Whining Road."
<br><br>
Fuxi said, "It shouldn't be difficult. Although the creatures in the Three Purities Stage are not to be trifled with, there are still some relatively weak races. As long as we have enough time, we can do it. But of course, the top priority right now is to save the heroes of the human race."
<br><br>
Based on the plan devised by Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven, they would begin to rescue the human heroes trapped in the underground after entering the Supreme Pure Realm. But they had lost time while Zen was possessed by Campbell.
<br><br>
It would take a long time to save the Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road now.
<br><br>
When Fuxi finished speaking, something began flowing from the back of the Wing King. Dark green liquid oozed out from beneath the feathers. The green substance pooled together and rose to form a body, turning into a human-shaped Regal Jade statue.
<br><br>
"Zen, ask if this Regal Jade statue can be used," the Wing King instructed.
<br><br>
Zen asked in Sanskrit, "Master Campbell, will your companions possess this Regal Jade statue?"
<br><br>
Campbell studied the Regal Jade statue, then nodded. His eyes brightened with satisfaction. "Yes, they will!"
<br><br>
In fact, the Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road didn't need to possess other creatures to awaken. The reason for possessing other creatures was their desire to use the Light of Annihilation to kill the Treacherous Beings with big heads. But now that all such Treacherous Beings had been killed, they could simply walk straight out of the Whining Road.
<br><br>
However, they still wanted to realize their long-cherished wishes. The Regal Jade statues made by the Wing King would lead them out of the Whining Road and enable them to reach the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
"Well then, we can divide into two groups. I will go to the Whining Road to awaken those Treacherous Beings, and you go to open the underground passage to save the heroes of the human race," said the Wing King gravely.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded. "I agree. It's a good arrangement."
<br><br>
There was an empty thatched hut since Campbell had left the Whining Road, and it would be safe for the Wing King to enter it alone.
<br><br>
As soon as everyone had voiced their approval of the plan, the Wing King sent them to the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. Then he changed his route.
<br><br>
Wings spread, casting an enormous shadow on the ground below, the giant hawk flew alone towards the Blood Swamp.
<br><br>
Chapter 4031 On The Treasure Bottle Platform In the Jade Pure Realm, on the immense, hundred mile long and wide Pure Sky Platform, stood a huge treasure bottle in the shape of a gourd.
<br><br>
It was crystal clear and beamed magnificent colors as light reflected off it and refracted through it.
<br><br>
A wide river flowed beside the treasure bottle, appearing out of the void of the Jade Pure Realm and passing through the Treasure Bottle Platform.
<br><br>
This was the famous Divine River.
<br><br>
Many giants' corpses lay on either side of the Divine River.
<br><br>
Blood gurgled from their bodies and into the river through the drains, dying it a blood red.
<br><br>
A fat monk stood beside the corpses, smiling relentlessly. He appeared kind and friendly by his face, but the blood soaked into his robe said otherwise.
<br><br>
He grabbed a corpse and pushed it into the Divine River.
<br><br>
Splash! The body drifted down with the current.
<br><br>
On the opposite side of the river, a woman in a long robe was covered in blood as well, her once pure white robe now a deep red. Like the fat monk, she too was pushing corpses into the river.
<br><br>
The fat man might have looked like a monk, but he was in fact a Taoist priest. His name was Darby and he was the eldest disciple of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The woman was Stella, the youngest of the Grandmaster of Heaven's disciples.
<br><br>
"I did not expect our master to kill so many giants in only three days. His strength must have increased significantly," sighed Darby.
<br><br>
The giants in the Jade Pure Realm possessed terrifying strength.
<br><br>
Facing so many was incomprehensible. If Darby came face to face with just one, he would be forced to retreat.
<br><br>
Being the eldest disciple, not only did he have all kinds of treasures, but the bloodline he had obtained from the Eternal Scroll Painting was extremely magical too. He was definitely among the top figures of the many Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
A speck of worry appeared in Stella's eyes. "Our master has indeed become stronger, but did you notice that he seemed almost entirely not himself during the battle?"
<br><br>
"It's understandable. He was so determined to kill his opponents that perhaps he forgot himself a little and was not as kind as usual," Darby said as if this was common knowledge.
<br><br>
But Stella shook her head and replied, "No, it was more than that. It felt to me that he was possessed by a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Do you remember how our sister died?"
<br><br>
Darby darkened at the mention of their sister and scolded, "Don't ever mention her again!"
<br><br>
The sister they were talking about was the second disciple of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
She took care of Samantha, Sienna and Stella like a mother and they treated her as one.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven once encountered a powerful enemy and in the heat of battle, he lost control. He bullied his opponent back, forcing him to retreat before he slaughtered him like a mad man.
<br><br>
Although he was victorious, in his wildness, he had accidentally killed his second disciple.
<br><br>
This shadow of hurt had always lingered in Stella's heart. It was a difficult reality for all three sisters to face.
<br><br>
Stella had buried the matter within the depths of herself, but the way the Grandmaster of Heaven mauled his way through all the giants in a craze brought it all back.
<br><br>
She had been standing close to one of the giants as he rampaged. If Darby hadn't dragged her away, the Grandmaster of Heaven would have killed her as well.
<br><br>
When she looked into his eyes, an uncontrollable shiver ran through her. As she looked at him, he was not a person anymore, but a disgusting Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
They had won the battle on the Treasure Bottle Platform, but the thought of the look on her master's face unearthed memories of her big sister and made her terribly uneasy.
<br><br>
She hadn't expected such a harsh reaction from Darby when she mentioned their dead sister.
<br><br>
But Darby's heart softened when he saw the grief on her face and immediately made an attempt to comfort her. "Master has his worries too.
<br><br>
Many things are not as simple as they seem. How do we fight the Element Spirit Civilization? Do you think it's possible for Master to do this alone?"
<br><br>
As the outside world saw it, the Grandmaster of Heaven alone led the Nihility race in the fight against the Element Spirit Civilization. However, very few knew the truth and even Stella and her other two sisters were clueless as to it.
<br><br>
Stella pursed her lips and calmed down, admitting in a low voice, "I know.
<br><br>
No matter what kind of person he is, he will always be my master."
<br><br>
Splash! Darby pushed another giant's corpse into the Divine River and the water rippled as it fell. With a smile, he said, "That's right. We shouldn't doubt our master."
<br><br>
Many of the elites of the Nihility race were from other races, but only nine, including the Grandmaster of Heaven, were humans. Naturally, they had always been close with one another.
<br><br>
Four red spheres floated under the massive treasure bottle.
<br><br>
Powerhouses of different shapes floated in these red spheres. They all advocated the Nihility Way and some were leaders of their races on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
With their faith in the Nihility Way, they did all they could to destroy absolutely everything, and so it made sense for them to follow the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
They were Ewing, Sloan, Phelps and Larson.
<br><br>
They each used their own theurgies in an attempt to open the treasure bottle.
<br><br>
But all their efforts were in vain as the bottle remained motionless. On the bottle was a single Sanskrit word, "seal", and around the word were thick lines that extended all over the bottle.
<br><br>
They knew the sturdiness and stubbornness of the bottle were related to the word on it, but none of them could find a way to break it.
<br><br>
"What on earth is in the bottle that the Element Spirit Civilization has to protect it like this?" Ewing's rough voice asked from one of the red spheres.
<br><br>
"In addition to the numerous giants, there are also so many hostility-level Treacherous Beings. Whatever is in this bottle must be very valuable,"
<br><br>
Phelps speculated.
<br><br>
"I didn't expect us to not be able to open the bottle after we took the Treasure Bottle Platform. This is really embarrassing."
<br><br>
As the four were deep in discussion, the Grandmaster of Heaven sauntered over.
<br><br>
He wore a golden robe that fluttered even though there was no wind. He was a truly intimidating figure to behold.
<br><br>
Swish! He stretched out a hand and drew a black dagger from his waist. It was not made of gold, copper or jade, but instead looked like the tooth of some kind of monster.
<br><br>
"That's the tooth of someone in the darkness! How did you get that?" Sloan, who looked like a cat and was the first on the left, asked.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't answer him. He leaped gracefully and nailed the black dagger firmly in the Sanskrit word, and the lines strewn across the bottle began glowing as he did.
<br><br>
The light faded and the lines that had been used to sustain the bottle turned into cracks.
<br><br>
A pale yellow energy emitted from the bottle, shocking the four powerful creatures when they saw it.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"Huh. The aura of this energy is awfully weak."
<br><br>
"Apparently, this is the aura of the Godly Way. But is it really a Godly Way?"
<br><br>
"Indeed, the aura is extremely unusual. Upon closer inspection, it doesn't belong to any of the three thousand Godly Ways. However, it does look like the aura of the Godly Way."
<br><br>
And even if their cultivation of a Godly Way actually reached the peak level, they would merely acquire one divine megaton of force. Why on earth would they be interested in it? At any rate, they had been staying in the Supreme Pure Realm for such a long period of time. This meant that they weren't aware of the news circulating in the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
In addition to that, the Grandmaster of Heaven had never divulged any information regarding the Evil God.
<br><br>
"I assure you, this is indeed the Godly Way energy," the Grandmaster of Heaven stated frankly. He didn't want to beat around the bush.
<br><br>
The four red spheres were rotating simultaneously. When they heard the Grandmaster of Heaven's confirmation, they exchanged meaningful glances.
<br><br>
They paid a great price in order to capture the Treasure Bottle Platform.
<br><br>
Despite that, all they got was the Godly Way energy. They couldn't accept that this was it.
<br><br>
They had a hard time wrapping their heads around it. Was the Grandmaster of Heaven insane? They all thought so. Why else would he choose to grab this? Nevertheless, the Grandmaster of Heaven always had the most accurate predictions. He even managed to help them escape from death countless times. Obviously, he would never do such a boring thing.
<br><br>
"So what's the use of the Godly Way energy anyway?" Phelps decided to go along with the Grandmaster of Heaven's train of thought. He might as well learn what his purpose was.
<br><br>
"You are from the Other Shore. Therefore, you have never set foot in the chaos before. Ewing, go ahead and tell him what the use of the Godly Way energy is," instructed the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
While Phelps was from the Other Shore, Ewing, on the other hand, was from a ruling civilization that existed in the chaos.
<br><br>
When the Grandmaster of Heaven called his name, Ewing had an inscrutable expression on his face. "The Godly Way energy helps one reach the consummation of True God Realm and subsequently break through to the Other Shore Realm," he answered.
<br><br>
When Phelps, Sloan, and Larson heard his answer, they merely broke into laughter.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Realm was quite insignificant to them.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven slightly turned blue in the face as he restrained himself from reprimanding them. He turned around to face Ewing and asked, "Do your race not cultivate the Ways-blending Energy?"
<br><br>
"Huh? The Ways-blending Energy? Why would we? Isn't it just a waste of time?" Ewing questioned. In his honest opinion, cultivating the Waysblending Energy was far inferior to entering the Other Shore. As a matter of fact, most of the Other Shore Realm warriors had the same notion even until now.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven sighed and felt a bit frustrated. "The main reason why the Ways-blending Energy isn't that strong is that it has always been flawed. Remember, the six great truths are all derived from the Waysblending Energy. The complete Ways-blending Energy is actually very powerful."
<br><br>
Even as he tried to explain it, Phelps, Larson, and Sloan still didn't understand what he meant. After all, the three of them were from the Grand Plain Stage on the Other Shore. And there, they had almost no chance to learn about the concept of the Godly Way.
<br><br>
However, Ewing had a serious expression on his face. He felt like he had heard of this before.
<br><br>
When he was still in the chaos, he didn't cultivate the Ways-blending Energy. However, his now deceased brother was very obsessed with it. His brother had actually spent a lot of time on it. Sadly, the final result was not good.
<br><br>
Later on, his brother told him that the Ways-blending Energy was extremely powerful. The only drawback was it could be extremely difficult to blend the Godly Ways. More importantly, the energy was incomplete and defective.
<br><br>
At that time, Ewing didn't take his brother's words seriously. He simply thought that he had failed in cultivating the Ways-blending Energy, so he just used it as an excuse to save face.
<br><br>
What the Grandmaster of Heaven said strongly reminded him of what his brother also told him once before.
<br><br>
"The complete Ways-blending Energy may be extraordinarily terrifying,"
<br><br>
Ewing mumbled quietly. The words came out of his mouth as though from a long forgotten memory.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven smiled when he heard this. "That is precisely why I wanted to attack the Treasure Bottle Platform."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished talking, he took out a small bottle. "Collect!" he said to the pale yellow energy floating in the air.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The bottle gave off such an attraction force.
<br><br>
The pale yellow energy floated noiselessly in the air. Trapped in the treasure bottle for many chaotic eras, it had now become intelligent. It was struggling very hard to get out of that attraction force.
<br><br>
However, it was too weak to resist it. Soon enough, it was sucked into the bottle.
<br><br>
At this very moment, everyone heard a strange sound out of the blue.
<br><br>
"Meow..."
<br><br>
The meow was very soft. It was almost like a newborn kitten's cry.
<br><br>
They could tell that the voice came from afar but it could be distinctly heard from all over the place.
<br><br>
"Is there a kitten somewhere? I heard a meow," Stella asked confusedly.
<br><br>
She had just thrown a giant's corpse into the Divine River. However, even the loud splash of the water was unable to cover up the meowing sound.
<br><br>
Darby was a lot more sensitive than Stella was. Without warning, his spiritual sense had spread out and covered the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
Instinctively, he turned around and aimed at the northern area.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven brought out a wooden cork from his waist band. There were elegant runes carved on the cork. With it, he covered the mouth of the bottle and gently tapped the runes with his fingertips.
<br><br>
Buzz! The runes on the cork flashed and firmly sealed the bottle.
<br><br>
After that, the Grandmaster of Heaven raised his head and smiled at the void. "I have a question for you."
<br><br>
He held the bottle firmly in his hand and shook it. The bottle had an interesting feature. It would change its color in accordance to the color of the thing inside it. Therefore, the elegant white porcelain bottle had now turned yellow.
<br><br>
"Now that the Godly Way energy has been successfully extracted, why should you not destroy it right away?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"Meow..."
<br><br>
They heard another meow echoing through the entire area.
<br><br>
"There may only be one truth," the Grandmaster of Heaven answered the question himself. "The energy of the entire chaos is constant. Even if you destroy this Godly Way energy, it would just be reproduced somewhere else in the chaos. Is my speculation correct?"
<br><br>
"Meow..."
<br><br>
The meow had gotten even louder and much clearer.
<br><br>
In an instant, they seemed to realize that it had a terrible magic power. As the sound faded away, everyone who heard it felt agonizing pain in their ears. It was almost as if they were actually getting clawed by a cat.
<br><br>
"Ouch! That hurts!"
<br><br>
Stella screamed and covered her ears with her hands.
<br><br>
When he saw this, Darby turned his hand upward and a small golden bell appeared on his palm.
<br><br>
He loved collecting treasures. He carried over a thousand of them with him all the time.
<br><br>
He gently tossed it upwards. In the blink of an eye, the small bell turned into a big golden bell that covered him and Stella. At the same time, it kept chiming softly, which effectively alleviated the pain in their ears.
<br><br>
Phelps, Larson, Ewing, and Sloan also used their own methods of protecting their ears from the shrill and piercing cries.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Grandmaster of Heaven remained standing still and made no effort to cover his ears. He merely stared toward the north.
<br><br>
From the outside of the Treasure Bottle Platform, an enormous cat head slowly appeared. It had a white ball embedded on the top of it, which was filled with numerous eyeballs. They noticed that these were not illusory eyes, but real ones. Each and every one of them was connected by blood vessels in a very complex manner.
<br><br>
This being was actually the leader of the Element Spirit Civilization, the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, a booming voice came out of his body.
<br><br>
"Do you really think you can easily get away with something that is not yours?" he asked them in an intimidating manner.
<br><br>
"Shouldn't the Treasure Bottle Platform be a trap? It could be just like what I did to those puny humans before?"
<br><br>
"What do you think?"
<br><br>
After the Eye Spirit finished talking, Phelps, Larson, Sloan, and Ewing felt ill at ease. Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven remained as calm as usual.
<br><br>
Chapter 4033 Possession Of Treacherous Beings The Element Spirit Civilization had always regarded the Treasure Bottle Platform as a very important place for their race. It was heavily guarded by the Joy House.
<br><br>
For the longest time, the members of the Nihility race had never even considered attacking the Treasure Bottle Platform.
<br><br>
But this time, the Grandmaster of Heaven was able to lead them inside.
<br><br>
They fought their way in and killed all of the members of the Joy House.
<br><br>
The plan went too smoothly that it felt like a trap.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven looked around then sneered. "It has taken me some time before I managed to lure out and vanquish the ghosts of the Joy House. But now, it seems like they were just baits. Does it mean that this is some sort of bait as well? Or are you freely handing it over to me?"
<br><br>
After saying this, the Grandmaster of Heaven faced towards the Eye Spirit and shook the pale yellow bottle in his hand.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, one of the Eye Spirit's eyes opened wide and fixed its stare at the bottle. It glared with such force that...
<br><br>
Swoosh! The Grandmaster of Heaven's arm was completely chopped off by the eye's intense stare. The severed arm still held the bottle in its hand. Both had instantly disappeared and reappeared beside the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
"Grandmaster of Heaven! Your arm..." Phelps yelled in shock. He stared at it with a frown.
<br><br>
Ewing, Sloan, and Larson exchanged nervous glances. They couldn't believe what just happened.
<br><br>
However, they thought the Grandmaster of Heaven wouldn't have been so careless. Maybe he had a trick up his sleeve. Nevertheless, they were still a little worried when they saw his bloody arm.
<br><br>
They needed not worry because at the next moment, the arm and the bottle that appeared beside the Eye Spirit suddenly exploded. They merely turned into a mass of colorful smoke.
<br><br>
Seeing this, the Grandmaster of Heaven smiled and calmly took out a white silk cloth to cover his wound. Astonishingly, the broken arm had been recovered when he pulled the silk cloth off. The bottle was still in his hand.
<br><br>
He continued to shake the bottle towards the Eye Spirit. "It was simply magic."
<br><br>
All at once, each and every eyeball on the Eye Spirit's body blinked. They looked at the Grandmaster of Heaven with disgust and pure loathing.
<br><br>
"There is no way I'd let you have the Godly Way energy! You won't be able to get out of here alive!"
<br><br>
"Meow!"
<br><br>
The huge cat under the Eye Spirit got up with its back arched. Its fur stood on its ends as it started to emit an extremely foul and repulsive aura. This was a resentment-level Treacherous Being. It was known to be exceptionally powerful among its kind.
<br><br>
The revolting aura immediately began turning into visible black waves.
<br><br>
Darby's golden bell was a powerful defensive treasure. However, the surface of the bell was instantly riddled with holes as the black waves washed over it. Under the pressure of the black waves, Stella was about to collapse.
<br><br>
"Darby, take Stella away from here," the Grandmaster of Heaven ordered at once.
<br><br>
"Yes, Master! Right away!" Darby bowed obediently and asked, "But can I stay and fight here afterwards?"
<br><br>
However, the Grandmaster of Heaven merely gave him a cold look so he didn't say anything else.
<br><br>
As soon as he put away the golden bell, a silver curtain appeared in his other hand. He wrapped himself and Stella with the silver curtain and quickly dashed towards the other side of the platform.
<br><br>
He was the Grandmaster of Heaven's eldest disciple. Therefore, he clearly knew how and why his master had suddenly become so powerful.
<br><br>
Whenever a battle involved Treacherous Beings, the Grandmaster of Heaven would no longer be human. He would transform into a Treacherous Being, or half human and half Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
There was a time when Darby also wanted to obtain such power. He thought it was a very convenient and useful ability.
<br><br>
Therefore, he and Maynard Zhao had made so many requests for their master to teach them.
<br><br>
After all, they often had to face Treacherous Beings whenever they traveled within the Three Purities Stage. It seemed reasonable that they learned how to use that power as well.
<br><br>
It didn't matter whether the Treacherous Beings were strong or weak. They always had no other choice but to run away from them. It was even difficult for them to move a single step when faced with these monsters.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, the Grandmaster of Heaven refused their requests right off the bat. In return, he gave each disciple a strange stone. The Light of Annihilation was contained within each of the stones. It could easily kill the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
All of his eight personal disciples had one.
<br><br>
Even though the stone was only the size of a small bean, the Light of Annihilation contained inside it could effectively slay the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Stella, Sienna, and Samantha were the weakest among the disciples. But even they could kill the Treacherous Beings with the help of their stones.
<br><br>
Whoosh! After Darby and Stella gained enough distance, they noticed a lump of soil rising from the flat ground in front of them. It was like a tomb without a tablet.
<br><br>
When Darby saw the bump, he instantly pulled the silver curtain and released Stella from it.
<br><br>
Stella was the youngest disciple of the Grandmaster of Heaven. Despite that, she was not easily scared. In fact, she was quite courageous. The lump of soil emitted a disgusting and foul aura. It was most likely that there were Treacherous Beings hiding underneath it.
<br><br>
Swish! She promptly turned around and swiftly pulled the sword strapped on her waist. She maintained her stance and observed silently.
<br><br>
The stone given by her master was embedded in her sword. In this way, she would be able to inflict serious damage to a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Stella wouldn't normally use this sword to defend against any other enemy.
<br><br>
But whenever she encountered a Treacherous Being, the sword would always come in handy.
<br><br>
Buzz! It started emitting a powerful energy.
<br><br>
She raised her long sword then positioned it horizontally at the level of her head. The stone embedded on the hilt was emitting the Light of Annihilation. It began covering the edges of the sword.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a long stick appeared upon Darby's shoulder. His stone was embedded on the center of the stick. The Light of Annihilation emitted by the stone radiated towards both ends of the stick.
<br><br>
The creatures under the bump seemed to have noticed the enemies outside.
<br><br>
Before long, some monkeys came out one after another. At that point, Darby and Stella were able to identify them as hostility-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Hostility-level Treacherous Beings were relatively weak. They could easily take them out if there were just a few of them. Unfortunately, they came in a large number this time.
<br><br>
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! One by one the monkeys began to move.
<br><br>
As the monkeys charged at them, Stella's eyes gleamed in anticipation. The sword radiance danced around her. The Light of Annihilation had swiftly and methodically cut into the bodies of monkeys. It effectively obliterated their shapes.
<br><br>
In the meantime, Darby's long stick released thousands of white stick shadows. It smashed the monkeys into pieces in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
With their outstanding expertise, they efficiently annihilated all of the monkeys that came from the lump of soil.
<br><br>
Soon enough, nothing came out of the bump anymore.
<br><br>
"There is no more monkey left!" Stella shouted to Darby.
<br><br>
"Good job! Let's go!" Darby quickly responded.
<br><br>
Boom! At that very moment, they heard a violent roar coming from the Treasure Bottle Platform. It immediately caught their attention.
<br><br>
As they turned around simultaneously, they saw that the Grandmaster of Heaven's body had expanded many times. Stella noticed a faint shadow on his arm. Sometimes, this shadow was not visible. But there were also times that it suddenly appeared.
<br><br>
"Darby! Look at Master's arm!" Stella yelled as she pointed at the Grandmaster of Heaven's gigantic body.
<br><br>
Darby merely glanced at it with an impassive expression on his face.
<br><br>
"That's none of our business, Stella. Let's keep moving!"
<br><br>
After he spoke, he grabbed Stella's arm and dragged her forward. They needed to get out of here as soon as possible. Before long, another three bumps appeared in their path.
<br><br>
Some monkeys jumped out of the bumps on either sides. Meanwhile, three black creatures emerged from the bump in the center. Their bodies were quite similar to those of humans. However, there were two pairs of bone blades where their hands and feet should be.
<br><br>
It was obvious that they were from the Bone Blade race that supported the Element Spirit Civilization. They were quite strong.
<br><br>
Stella narrowed her eyes slightly and the Light of Annihilation began to flow through her long sword once again. "Darby, you take care of the three members of the Bone Blade race. Meanwhile, I will eliminate the monkeys."
<br><br>
Even though the three members of the Bone Blade race were strong, they were still no match for Darby.
<br><br>
After so many years of patient cultivation, Darby was almost as strong as the Grandmaster of Heaven. Therefore, Stella had complete confidence in his abilities.
<br><br>
But just as Stella finished speaking, the three members of the Bone Blade race had already charged towards them. They moved with such speed that they were only a few meters away front of them.
<br><br>
"Stella, watch out!"
<br><br>
Darby had obviously sensed something was wrong.
<br><br>
He quickly pulled Stella back and an umbrella instantly appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
The umbrella unfurled at once. It had an excellent defensive power.
<br><br>
Therefore, it would be extremely difficult to destroy. It was one of Darby's most prized and powerful defensive treasures.
<br><br>
Yet, Stella heard a loud slashing sound. The umbrella had been easily torn apart like it was just a piece of paper. This was the work of the three members of the Bone Blade race. Moreover, Darby's shoulder had also been severed off.
<br><br>
Darby's blood splattered onto Stella's face. Her eyes full of shock and fear, she realized that these were not ordinary members of the Bone Blade race.
<br><br>
The expressions in their eyes were exactly like that of her master when he went mad.
<br><br>
Chapter 4034 Powerful Weapons Blood spurted out from Darby's chest as if a rain of blood had fallen. His entire arm was torn apart, exposing a terrible wound.
<br><br>
"Darby!" Stella's voice trembled at the scene. She didn't expect that the three members of the Bone Blade race would be this powerful. "Heal yourself quickly! I'll guard you for as long as I can."
<br><br>
Saying this, she drew out a second sword.
<br><br>
She only used the first one to deal with the Treacherous Beings, while the second one was actually her personal weapon.
<br><br>
Although she was determined to fight until death, she was still trembling in fear.
<br><br>
Darby calmly said, "Don't move."
<br><br>
"What? What do you mean?" Stella was panicking so she could just ask in confusion.
<br><br>
"Just do it! Hurry up and hide behind me! We don't have much time!"
<br><br>
Darby ordered loudly as he saw that Stella was out of it.
<br><br>
Seeing Darby's serious face, she immediately did as she was told, even though she didn't understand what was going on.
<br><br>
Darby immediately stretched out his hand. Suddenly, three items emerged on his palm.
<br><br>
There were a green rune, a yellow rune, and a sheet of transparent glazed glass.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Darby quickly threw the yellow rune at their feet. Then, as the rune spread out, butterfly-shaped shields emerged from it.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The shields grew and covered them tightly.
<br><br>
Crash! Bang! Just when they put up the shields, the members of the Bone Blade race launched another barrage of powerful attacks.
<br><br>
Their speed and strength were completely terrifying. They would be in extreme danger if Darby hadn't put up the shields in the nick of time.
<br><br>
Even the umbrella from before couldn't block their all-out attack.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the densely-packed butterfly-shaped shields were able to resist them, buying Darby a few seconds to prepare for his next plan.
<br><br>
The yellow rune was a life-saving treasure for Darby. He had over a thousand treasures with him, and this one would certainly belong to the top three in terms of value and capability. Though he was hesitant to use it at first, he had no other choice if he wanted to save their lives.
<br><br>
Then, Darby used the green rune and attached it to his wound. With a flash of green light, the wound healed rapidly, and his torn arm regenerated.
<br><br>
Now, their only problem was the powerful foes that were still attacking them.
<br><br>
As he completely recovered, Darby raised the glass in his hand. Upon a closer look, the glass was divided into two layers, and there was a strange creature in it. The creature had an odd shape as if it had been crushed and turned into a specimen.
<br><br>
"Master doesn't want me to tell you about it," Darby finally spoke.
<br><br>
"About what?" Stella asked. Crack! Darby broke the glass by his bare hands.
<br><br>
Then, the creature contained in it immediately surfaced.
<br><br>
It was like fluid in form, but it returned to its original shape in no time. It turned out to be a Treacherous Being! "There are so many things in this world that are being controlled by Treacherous Beings," Darby said in a soft voice. Then, the Treacherous Being suddenly drilled into his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. Afterward, a faint shadow appeared on the surface of his body.
<br><br>
Three milky white claws, as sharp as sickles, slowly grew on his arm, while a chain formed in his other hand.
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Beings' power is considered to be the strongest power,"
<br><br>
Darby said sadly. "But sooner or later, the ones who borrow their power would inevitably become their slaves."
<br><br>
This was the warning that their master told them as he bestowed the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Darby raised his right hand, and the chain drew a visible arc in the air. The claws on his arm spun viciously under the pulling of the chain.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The three members of the Bone Blade race quickly reacted and retreated. At the same time, the monkeys surrounded them.
<br><br>
The power and speed that were granted to Darby left Stella stunned.
<br><br>
She only saw Darby's figure flash before her eyes, and then the huge claws spun at incredible speed, creating several irregular arcs in the air. The arcs drove away the monkeys and caught up with the three members of the Bone Blade race in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
They successfully hit their targets.
<br><br>
Crash! Splat! The bodies of the three members were instantly cut in half.
<br><br>
Soon after, the Treacherous Beings hidden in their bodies had come out.
<br><br>
These three Treacherous Beings were very similar to the monkeys, but they were a bit larger in size.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As Darby returned to Stella's side, the claws and chain quickly retracted back into his body. Then, he took out the long stick embedded with the Light of Annihilation and said, "Stella, you can make your move now."
<br><br>
Stella was still recovering from shock after witnessing all of this. As Darby spoke beside her, she came to her senses. She waved her long sword and rushed towards the monkeys.
<br><br>
Because the Light of Annihilation was fatal to the monkeys, they were all easily killed.
<br><br>
The three Treacherous Beings that escaped from the bodies of the three members of the Bone Blade race were also killed.
<br><br>
After a narrow escape from absolute death, Stella stared at Darby and took the opportunity to ask, "Where did you acquire the Treacherous Being?"
<br><br>
Darby fell silent for a while before he decided to start talking. He didn't intend to hide anything from Stella, so he told her everything he knew.
<br><br>
In the entire Three Purities Stage, the Treacherous Beings were, without a doubt, the most terrifying creatures.
<br><br>
However, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization knew they were afraid of the Light of Annihilation. To avoid the Light of Annihilation, they had to sneak into the bodies of other creatures.
<br><br>
Campbell was even able to use the Light of Annihilation to deal with the other Treacherous Beings after he possessed Zen's body.
<br><br>
However, Zen was possessed passively.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Darby took the initiative to be possessed. He used the Treacherous Being as a weapon.
<br><br>
Although Maynard had got the Light of Annihilation from his master a few years ago, he was still unsatisfied.
<br><br>
Indeed, the Light of Annihilation could deal with the ordinary Treacherous Beings, but when it came to the truly powerful ones, it would not be enough.
<br><br>
Moreover, it was more difficult to deal with the Treacherous Beings that possessed powerful warriors.
<br><br>
"But it means that you'll become a walking corpse if you are possessed by a Treacherous Being, right?" Stella asked, knowing how the process usually worked.
<br><br>
Darby smiled and said, "While that is true for most cases, not all Treacherous Beings will take total control of one's body. Some of them are friendly, and will even help you defeat your enemies. That's the friendly type of Treacherous Beings. They can become our most powerful weapons."
<br><br>
As Darby spoke, he took out two pieces of glazed glass. Then, immediately after, the Treacherous Being that was attached to his body got out from his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, and returned to the glass.
<br><br>
Right there and then, Stella was able to see the Treacherous Being's form through the glass. From it, she could clearly see the claws and chain that Darby had used earlier.
<br><br>
"Use the Treacherous Beings as weapons, huh?" Stella muttered to herself.
<br><br>
It still seemed kind of unbelievable to her.
<br><br>
But what frustrated her was the fact that her master and brothers had hidden this fact from her and her sisters.
<br><br>
"Then, why did you hide it from me?" Stella asked Darby with disappointed eyes.
<br><br>
"Our master didn't tell us anything at the beginning either," Darby said as he shook his head. "After being able to kill a follower of the Element Spirit Civilization, Maynard got a hold of this secret from him. Then, Maynard approached our master and tried to confirm this matter."
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was famous for his bloodlust, but he favored his disciples very much. Maynard pestered him until he got his consent to use the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
"What do you mean? Our master deliberately hid this secret from us? Why would he do that?" Stella asked as her brows furrowed.
<br><br>
"Yes, he did," Darby replied as he stared at Stella seriously. "But he did it for our own sake. As I've said, not all Treacherous Beings will be willing to cooperate with you. If we control them for a long time, there would be consequences. Possessing others is their way to regain their consciousness.
<br><br>
Therefore, our master didn't really want us to resort to this method. He would rather pass this method to Phelps and Ewing than teach us."
<br><br>
Chapter 4035 Cat And Saber Generally speaking, most Eternal Realm warriors and Other Shore creatures felt apprehensive at the mention of the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
After all, most of them had only encountered the killing type and the attaching type, which were the most common types of Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
The various kinds of Treacherous Beings all had different personalities and obsessions. Some of them were naturally kind-hearted and helpful to others.
<br><br>
This type of Treacherous Beings was called the friendly type.
<br><br>
The friendly type was further divided into different kinds. Some of them readily helped others while they stuck to their principles, while others trusted unconditionally and were willing to do anything.
<br><br>
The latter kind was the sort of Treacherous Beings that could be used as weapons.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being in Darby's glazed glass was called the Three-clawed Beast. It was a hostility-level Treacherous Being with powerful attacks.
<br><br>
After Darby got the Three-clawed Beast from his master, he was only allowed to practice with it a few times before he had to seal it in the glazed glass. Furthermore, his master warned that he should never use it unless absolutely necessary.
<br><br>
However, the Light of Annihilation was not enough to defeat these Treacherous Beings of the attaching type. Left with no other choice, Darby finally was forced to use the Three-clawed Beast to deal with the three members of the Bone Blade race.
<br><br>
The moment Darby finished his explanation, an ear-piercing scratching sound suddenly came from behind them.
<br><br>
Crack! A giant cat, made up of countless eyeballs, appeared on the Pure Sky Platform! It seemed that something had hit it. Due to the strong impact, it almost slid off the Pure Sky Platform and fell into the space outside it.
<br><br>
Fortunately, a few hundred feet away from the Pure Sky Platform was still a safe distance. However, the space further than that devoured energies and everything else into nothingness.
<br><br>
The giant cat nailed itself to the ground with its claws, which created long and deep scratches on its way. It tried its best to slow down its descent.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
On the other side stood the Grandmaster of Heaven, whose tall figure closed in with a flash. He raised his palm and hacked down like a knife from the sky.
<br><br>
In turn, the giant cat flipped and leaped into the air, then raised one paw to block the Grandmaster of Heaven's palm strike.
<br><br>
Just as it managed to resist the incoming palm attack, a translucent white giant saber suddenly emerged from the Grandmaster of Heaven's body. The giant saber, which was also a weapon formed by a Treacherous Being, ruthlessly chopped down towards the giant cat.
<br><br>
Puff! Then, the saber cut the giant cat in half. After that one strike, it swung to the side and forcefully sliced the lower half of the cat's body.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit had transformed into the giant cat, and the cat-shaped Treacherous Being was hiding inside his body.
<br><br>
Although the Grandmaster of Heaven had cut off the Eye Spirit's body with his saber, it was not enough to cut off the Treacherous Being inside him.
<br><br>
Still, it managed to expose the Treacherous Being to the air.
<br><br>
"Ewing! Now!" the Grandmaster of Heaven shouted.
<br><br>
Ewing had been waiting for his command. As soon as the Grandmaster of Heaven gave the order, he swiftly leaped up into the air with two "lightning" bolts in his hands — which was the Light of Annihilation! Swoosh! Swoosh! Without second thoughts, he immediately threw the lightning bolts down.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven's other hand became as red as a hot iron. As the two lightning bolts flew towards the Treacherous Being, he also slapped it with his palm.
<br><br>
This cat-shaped Treacherous Being was a resentment-level Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
All Treacherous Beings feared the Light of Annihilation. When hostilitylevel Treacherous Beings came into contact with it, they would immediately die.
<br><br>
On the contrary, the resentment-level Treacherous Beings were more powerful. The Light of Annihilation only weakened them, so those who wanted to kill them had to use strong theurgies.
<br><br>
When the lightning bolts were about to hit the Treacherous Being, a blue figure suddenly flew over from the distance. It turned out to be the Holy Wings Armor! The Holy Wings Armor flew at a remarkably fast speed and blocked all the lightning bolts in front of the cat-shaped Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! The Light of Annihilation struck the Holy Wings Armor's chest but did not cause any damage at all.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's red palm also simultaneously slapped down, but the Holy Wings Armor turned around and slapped its palm against his as well.
<br><br>
It appeared that the Holy Wings Armor had the upper hand as it forcefully catapulted the Grandmaster of Heaven into the sky.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven flipped in the air and swooped down again with a cold stare. Then, he used the giant white saber that was about seven times bigger than his body, which the Treacherous Being inside him had formed.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he ruthlessly chopped down! Not only did his attack pack his immense power, but also the theurgy of the resentment-level Treacherous Being in his body! Buzz! In turn, the Holy Wings Armor's eyes lit up then it unleashed a massive amount of Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
The saber formed by the Treacherous Being was virtually invincible, but the Light of Annihilation quickly softened and molded it to its will. The saber struggled like a tentacle in pain! The Grandmaster of Heaven realized how dangerous it became, so he turned around and retreated to the other side. However, he failed to completely withdraw the saber because it contained too much impact, and the Holy Wings Armor tightly gripped the saber's tip! After the Light of Annihilation shone on the resentment-level Treacherous Being, its body became very fragile.
<br><br>
With a tug, the Holy Wings Armor tore the now fragile saber apart. Then, its hands released blue rays of light, which created strong currents that flowed onto the broken part of the saber.
<br><br>
Clatter! As a result, the damaged part of the saber dissipated.
<br><br>
Since it was a part of the Treacherous Being inside the Grandmaster of Heaven, the Treacherous Being began to roll in agony inside his body due to the sharp pain.
<br><br>
Naturally, he also suffered because of the Treacherous Being's violent struggle. His face flushed a deep purple, and he spat out a mouthful of blood then hastily retreated backward.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! I'm really strong..." Gavyn laughed from inside the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
Upon hearing Gavyn's voice, the Eye Spirit was stunned for a moment but he coldly commanded, "Go and chase him!"
<br><br>
The Godly Way energy was still in the hands of the Grandmaster of Heaven. If he successfully took it away, it would be troublesome.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Eye Spirit had thought that the person inside the Holy Wings Armor was Slade, but it was Gavyn instead.
<br><br>
For him, Gavyn was truly special among the members of the Element Spirit race. His talent and ability were on par with Claire's, but he was just too complacent.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Eye Spirit had imprisoned him in the Holy Wings Armor to become a part of Slade.
<br><br>
Yet, he did not expect that after he sent Slade out, Gavyn had taken control of the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
Then again, they were in a critical moment where it was not the right time to hold Gavyn accountable. Thus, the Eye Spirit only suppressed his displeasure. He quickly repaired his body and also chased after the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Let's get out of here!"
<br><br>
the Grandmaster of Heaven shouted to Ewing, Phelps, and his other subordinates as he fled.
<br><br>
It was not suitable to stay on the Treasure Bottle Platform any longer. The Grandmaster of Heaven had just planned to defeat the Eye Spirit once and for all, but he failed. Therefore, he fled without hesitation.
<br><br>
Of course, the Eye Spirit knew what he had thought about.
<br><br>
He decided to hold on until the Black House and General Gianni had arrived. By that time, he could easily kill the enemies.
<br><br>
Although he couldn't kill the Grandmaster of Heaven, heavily injuring his physical body was good enough. More importantly, he had to keep the Godly Way energy on the Treasure Bottle Platform.
<br><br>
Clatter! As soon as the Grandmaster of Heaven and his subordinates fled to the edge of the platform, an enormous wall of flames suddenly appeared in front of them and blocked their way.
<br><br>
Chapter 4036 Illusory Star A body that was almost perfect from head to toe slowly emerged from inside the wall of flames. It was no other than Claire.
<br><br>
At the same time as her appearance, a white dragon rolled and swam in the wall of flames at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
The white dragon swiftly moved in a few circles, and then it entered Claire's body.
<br><br>
This white dragon was also a resentment-level Treacherous Being, which was known for its incredible speed.
<br><br>
Together with her destructive power, she and the white dragon combined increased her strength by more than two times.
<br><br>
"I don't know how you found that there are two paths to the Treasure Bottle Platform, but here..." She gestured for them to stop then said, "No pass."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Holy Wings Armor and the Eye Spirit, who had turned into a giant cat, also charged forward.
<br><br>
Although there were only a few people of the Element Spirit Civilization present, it didn't mean that they were at a disadvantage.
<br><br>
Furthermore, they would surely win if they successfully delayed the battle and waited until the warriors of the Black House and General Gianni came.
<br><br>
If that did happen, it would push the five members of the Nihility race into a desperate situation. However, the Grandmaster of Heaven, Ewing, Phelps, and the others did not look panicked at all.
<br><br>
"Hand over the Godly Way energy, and I will leave your corpses intact," the Eye Spirit's voice sounded from the giant cat. The giant cat's eyes kept blinking calmly at them.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit and the Grandmaster of Heaven had fought with each other for a long time now.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit had once suffered a big loss from a fight with the Grandmaster of Heaven, but he later triumphed against the latter. This time, he was determined to deal a heavy blow to the Nihility race.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven could still be revived if he died, but the other warriors that followed him could not.
<br><br>
If they won this battle, it would be a great blow to the warriors from other races that followed the Nihility race.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!" Ewing laughed manically.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
Phelps and the others burst into laughter as well, and it was a laughter of victory after they succeeded in fooling their opponents.
<br><br>
Then, all of their figures became dimmer and dimmer, until they finally became illusions.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven's body began to curl up and turn into a mass of white objects. It turned out to be a Treacherous Being in the shape of a starfish, with dreamy-colored tentacles.
<br><br>
Afterward, the group of people disappeared.
<br><br>
"Illusory Star!"
<br><br>
Claire hissed with heavily furrowed brows.
<br><br>
After she had transformed into a human, she had always adjusted her appearance. Now that she looked almost perfect, her every move and even just her smile was breathtaking.
<br><br>
"Master Eye Spirit, did you not you see through the illusion created by the Illusory Star with your thousand eyes?" asked Gavyn in the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
He made sure to say his words in a disappointed tone.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, all of the giant cat's eyes turned and stared at the Holy Wings Armor. It was the Eye Spirit who gazed at him.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Claire glanced at Gavyn and said nothing.
<br><br>
Even though Gavyn hid inside the Holy Wings Armor, he still felt a chill run down his spine. He did not doubt that the Eye Spirit would kill him at this moment.
<br><br>
After a while, the Eye Spirit began to speak.
<br><br>
"You have good control of the Holy Wings Armor. From now on, you will have power over this armor," he said in a cold voice.
<br><br>
"Yes, Master Eye Spirit!" Gavyn answered excitedly.
<br><br>
In the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.
<br><br>
Under the Primeval Lord of Heaven's guidance, Zen returned to the northwest and found the first copper pagoda mountain.
<br><br>
Previously, Campbell had controlled Zen to push down the pagoda mountain. As a result, the soil on the pagoda mountain's surface fell off and revealed the round, red copper disk inside.
<br><br>
Then, Zen went to the back of the copper pagoda mountain and punched the round red copper disk.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
The first pagoda mountain began to tilt.
<br><br>
After that, he punched several times more in a row. When the pagoda mountain collapsed entirely, he then moved towards the second pagoda mountain.
<br><br>
He had pushed down the second and third pagoda mountains before.
<br><br>
However, the fourth pagoda mountain began to change.
<br><br>
When Campbell saw the route Zen had chosen, he felt a little surprised at first. Later on, Zen explained the reason to him, and he didn't say anything.
<br><br>
As a world builder, he naturally knew about the various changes in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.
<br><br>
Since Zen knew the path he wanted to open up, he would let Zen do it on his own.
<br><br>
According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven's instructions, Zen toppled down the last pagoda mountain after a short while. With a series of mechanical sounds, the underground started to rumble, and the vibration spread to the distance.
<br><br>
"It really opened!" the Snake Goddess exclaimed joyfully.
<br><br>
"Where is the entrance?" asked Fuxi.
<br><br>
"In the north. There is a small wasteland behind the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, and there is a cave-dwelling under the wasteland," Zen said as he pointed ahead.
<br><br>
But of course, he had never been to that cave-dwelling before. It was the Primeval Lord of Heaven who provided the information about its exact location.
<br><br>
"Then let's go!" Fuxi declared.
<br><br>
"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh…"
<br><br>
Without much pause, they flew towards the north of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.
<br><br>
Just as Zen had said, there was a barren land on the north of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. At a glance, the land looked like it was covered in rubble. The scenery never changed even as they traveled ten miles, fifty miles, or even a hundred miles.
<br><br>
When they had covered two hundred miles, Zen suddenly stopped and quickly moved about four miles to the west, then landed on the ground.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the other Eternal Realm warriors rushed over as well, and they also saw something strange.
<br><br>
A faint crack spread from the direction of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. It was like a grass snake or a grey thread that continuously appeared and disappeared, also fluctuated.
<br><br>
However, when it reached Zen's feet, it turned into a circular shape.
<br><br>
"Is this the place?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"We'll know after I give it a try!" Zen announced.
<br><br>
Then, he nodded and raised his fist to hit the ground.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The ground shattered and collapsed.
<br><br>
Below the rubble, a large hollow cave appeared.
<br><br>
He stood at the bottom of the cave and saw a big cave-dwelling at its side.
<br><br>
"You found it! This was the cave-dwelling I've been to before. It's still here as I expected!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said a bit excitedly from Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen looked up and shouted, "Everyone, you can come down now. This is the cave-dwelling we're looking for!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
Everyone else followed suit and descended to the bottom of the cave. At the same time, the Snake Goddess asked, "Zen, you have the human civilization's Civilization Artifact. If those human heroes are in the cavedwelling, you should be able to communicate with them and sense their location, right?"
<br><br>
At the Snake Goddess's reminder, Zen immediately understood what he should do.
<br><br>
Back then, he had sensed the Wing King's position through the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization. If those human heroes were in the cave-dwelling, the Civilization Artifact of human civilization should be able to sense them.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven..." Just as he was about to speak, the Primeval Lord of Heaven cut him off.
<br><br>
"No, they are not there. I've just used the Civilization Artifact to try to find them..." he immediately answered.
<br><br>
It was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's energy soul that controlled the Civilization Artifact, so he knew better what the Civilization Artifact could do.
<br><br>
Furthermore, when he had flown into this area, he had tried to communicate with the human heroes, but no one answered from the cave-dwelling.
<br><br>
"A long time has passed, and some things have definitely changed..." Zen muttered.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded in agreement. "Maybe they have found a way to go to the Jade Pure Realm in the cave-dwelling," he said.
<br><br>
In the end, Zen just told the Snake Goddess and the others about the disappointing result then everyone headed towards the depths of the cavedwelling.
<br><br>
The space inside the cave-dwelling was a bit spacious, and natural stone pillars scattered everywhere to support it. Just as everyone moved forward a bit, they heard the sounds of stones rolling down from both sides of the cave.
<br><br>
Chapter 4037 Stone Men Clang! Clang! The rocks in the cave-dwelling were smooth and solid. The sounds of the stones colliding with each other as they rolled down were especially crisp.
<br><br>
As they moved along, they saw several round and cuboid stones that were covered with densely-packed runes. Obviously, they weren't any ordinary stones.
<br><br>
"What are these things?" Thurston asked with furrowed brows.
<br><br>
Sawyer took a close look and said, "These stones seem to be the earth spirits of the Element Spirit race."
<br><br>
The earth spirits of the Element Spirit race could turn themselves into extremely sturdy stones. They could just be differentiated from ordinary ones because of their unique aura.
<br><br>
"What? Why would they turn into these?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in confusion as he also inspected the huge pile of stones.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race once trapped the human heroes in this cavedwelling, so they might have been sent here to guard the place. But still, they were confused as to why they would turn to these inanimate objects.
<br><br>
"Look! Something is coming out from the walls!" the Snake Goddess quickly warned as she pointed at a wall nearby.
<br><br>
Then, they saw masses of white orb-like things emerged from within the walls.
<br><br>
Judging from the form and the aura they emitted, there was no doubt that they were Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
"Treacherous Beings!"
<br><br>
"Watch out for them!"
<br><br>
"Be alert! Those who could use the Light of Annihilation, be prepared for their sudden attack!"
<br><br>
After entering the Supreme Pure Realm, they had suffered a lot from the hands of the Treacherous Beings. Thus, they developed an instinctive vigilance whenever they faced them.
<br><br>
From the aura that they were releasing, it was safe to assume that they were hostility-level ones. But as for what type of Treacherous Beings they were, they still couldn't tell.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! There were a total of three Treacherous Beings that emerged from the walls.
<br><br>
No one knew what their original form was. When they came out of the walls of the mountain, they were just like flowing water. Then suddenly, they rushed into the pile of stones.
<br><br>
At this moment, they didn't understand what the Treacherous Beings were trying to do. They began pulling several stones and pillars that gradually turned into three huge stone men.
<br><br>
As Zen and his group saw this, that was when they realized the goal of the Treacherous Beings for rushing into the stones that were actually made up of earth spirits.
<br><br>
"These hostility-level Treacherous Beings are vulnerable in the face of the Light of Annihilation, so the Element Spirit Civilization used the earth spirits to serve as their physical bodies," the Snake Goddess muttered.
<br><br>
Everyone's face immediately became serious as they faced the combined prowess of the Treacherous Beings and the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
They had already experienced the terrifying power of the Treacherous Beings on the Pure Sky Platform, but they still didn't know much about them. On the other hand, the Element Spirit Civilization seemed to be pretty familiar with how the Treacherous Beings functioned, as they even made fortified bodies specially designed for them.
<br><br>
"What should we do now?" King Ieuan asked as it started to panic. "Well, what choice do we have? We have to kill them using the Light of Annihilation," the Snake Goddess said with a straight face.
<br><br>
"But with those bodies, they won't be afraid of the Light of Annihilation now, right?" King Ieuan said reluctantly.
<br><br>
"Then we do it in a straightforward manner. We break those stone bodies, drive out the Treacherous Beings inside, and kill them," Zen declared decisively. "Master Campbell, can you assist me?"
<br><br>
Campbell nodded at Zen's request.
<br><br>
When he left the Pure Sky Platform with them, he had also put on his silver armor and taken his long spear with him.
<br><br>
As a Treacherous Being himself, he would be pretty useful in battles against them.
<br><br>
Most importantly, if the Light of Annihilation wasn't used on him, he wouldn't be affected. Thus, he had an incomparable advantage in dealing with the Treacherous Beings that hadn't awakened yet.
<br><br>
Just as he took a step forward, Campbell's body suddenly froze. "Zen, it seems like they're well prepared," he said in a low voice.
<br><br>
The three stone men seemed to have immediately sensed Campbell's aura.
<br><br>
A white dot of light appeared on each of the huge round stones on their shoulders. A ray containing the Light of Annihilation was instantly produced and was about to burst out at any time.
<br><br>
"Damn it! The Element Spirit Civilization has calculated everything!" Fuxi shouted as he gritted his teeth.
<br><br>
As the dominator of the Other Shore, the Element Spirit Civilization had an unfathomable foundation. They were powerful and wise that they almost had no weakness. Now, Fuxi and the others just felt how terrifying they could be as opponents.
<br><br>
"Get back! Let me handle them!" Pearson stepped forward and took the initiative to attack the stone men first.
<br><br>
"Keep them busy and I'll find a way to break their bodies," Zen instructed Pearson as he borrowed the long Spear from Campbell. Since Campbell couldn't risk fighting the stone men, Zen had to take charge. The surface of the long spear had been specially customized so that the Light of Annihilation could easily spread to the spear's tip.
<br><br>
As the Light of Annihilation burst out from the Holy Stone in Zen's palm, the twelve-foot long spear emanated a dazzling silver light.
<br><br>
Since the Treacherous Beings had an instinctive fear of the Light of Annihilation, they instantly felt the threat oozing out from Zen's spear.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Then, the runes on the chests of the three stone men began to glow with red lights.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The surface of the stones transformed into thorns, stretching outward. In a flash, the stone men became huge hedgehogs made of stones.
<br><br>
Thud! Thud! Thud! Discerning that Zen imposed the greatest threat, they immediately rushed towards him.
<br><br>
Pearson let out a smile as his body began to vanish bit by bit. His entire body transformed into countless threads that sneakily lay in wait for the movements of the stone men.
<br><br>
As soon as they rolled toward Zen, they were instantly tripped by countless silk threads, slowing down their movements.
<br><br>
As Zen saw this, his body quickly flashed and appeared above the head of one of the stone men.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being inside the stone man was quick to react. As it saw Zen above its head, it instantly leaped and tried to impale Zen's body into the stone thorns all over its body.
<br><br>
Zen instantly noticed what it was trying to do. He grabbed on one of the stone thorns and maneuvered his body to dodge its attack.
<br><br>
"Zen, watch out! Another one's coming from behind!" King Ieuan yelled.
<br><br>
Zen saw that another stone man whose body was covered all over with thorns was rushing over at great speed.
<br><br>
Although Pearson's silk threads had slowed down their movement, they were still fast enough to not be underestimated.
<br><br>
Whoosh! With Zen's fast-thinking, he grabbed the long spear and pressed its bottom part against the body of the stone man he was holding, and placed it horizontally.
<br><br>
Just before the stone man rushing behind made contact with him, he leaped high up. The two stone men collided harshly and the spear pointing towards the second stone man was forcefully stabbed into its body.
<br><br>
"Aaaargh!"
<br><br>
Shrilling screams came from the Treacherous Being inside the stone man's body.
<br><br>
The spear enveloped with the Light of Annihilation pierced cleanly into the body of the hostility-level Treacherous Being. With the power of the Light of Annihilation, it was instantly killed.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen rushed toward the body of the dead stone man and quickly pulled out the long spear. Before the other stone man that collided with the dead one could get up, he dashed over to its side.
<br><br>
Crack! Before it could even react, the long spear impaled into the other stone man's body. With a hissing sound, the second Treacherous Being was immediately killed.
<br><br>
After quickly eliminating two of the three stone men, Zen looked at the other side of the cave-dwelling.
<br><br>
The third one was blocked and was being taken care of by Sawyer, Thurston, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were waiting patiently to launch their attack. Then, suddenly, Eastern Emperor Taiyi finally drove his golden sword into the sturdy body of the last stone man, leaving an opening on the surface of its body. Fuxi immediately took action and used the opportunity to attack the Treacherous Being inside.
<br><br>
As he rushed towards the stone man, his palm showed a snow-white light which was actually the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
Clap! With the impact of Fuxi's palm enveloped by the Light of Annihilation, the Treacherous Being inside was instantly reduced to a pile of ashes.
<br><br>
Fuxi waved his hand with a hint of pride in his eyes.
<br><br>
Previously, during their first encounter with the Treacherous Beings, he thought that they were completely invincible.
<br><br>
He still clearly remembered the fear they instilled in his heart as they passed the Whining Road for the first time.
<br><br>
But now that he possessed the Light of Annihilation, he turned his fear into rage and determination and would kill them easily.
<br><br>
Chapter 4038 The Broken Passageway Once all three Treacherous Beings were killed, the stones stopped moving.
<br><br>
Though these stones were formed by the earth spirits, they remained as mere piles of dead things.
<br><br>
Zen cut the stones carefully and took out the Holy Stones within. These Holy Stones were about the size of a grain of sand.
<br><br>
He did not know just how many stones Element Spirit Civilization had but he considered them a rare treasure and they would be very useful if he encountered a large number of Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
After he put the stones away, Zen and the others continued to venture into the depths of the cave.
<br><br>
The path was not complicated and all they needed to do was go down.
<br><br>
As they went deeper, the path got wider and there was a continuous draft that blew above their heads.
<br><br>
"It seems there is a hidden pool or river here in the cave," Eastern Emperor Taiyi told them.
<br><br>
Zen nodded at his observation. "There is indeed a pool at the end of the cave. Your real selves are trapped beside that pool."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi couldn't help but flinch when he heard the word "real'.
<br><br>
It wasn't long ago after he was rescued from the Divine River that he found out there was a "real" version of himself so he still wasn't that used to the concept.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had long since accepted the fact that they were their creators' avatars but it was going to take Eastern Emperor Taiyi a bit more time to do so.
<br><br>
Realizing the slip of his tongue, Zen quickly tried to correct his mistake.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry."
<br><br>
"It's fine," Eastern Emperor Taiyi assured him with a smile. "I'd actually like to see what the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi looks like!"
<br><br>
Not long after, a pool appeared before them.
<br><br>
The water was so clear that they could see the bottom of the pool.
<br><br>
King Ieuan looked around. "I don't see any of the human heroes..."
<br><br>
"How can that be? This is a dead-end. There is no other way up ahead," the Snake Goddess seconded, walking around to search for the human heroes.
<br><br>
Zen also circled around the pool once and released his spiritual sense in an effort to find something like a hidden passage. Unfortunately, he came up with nothing.
<br><br>
Ever since the Primeval Lord of Heaven told him that he didn't sense the existence of the real human heroes through the Civilization Artifact, Zen had begun to mentally prepare himself for this sort of result. It didn't hurt any less, however, when he looked around and found nothing but an empty cave.
<br><br>
Yasamin looked at the others with a frown. "Do you think they've already been taken away by the Element Spirit Civilization?"
<br><br>
"They were trapped here for quite a long time. Maybe they've already been killed," Pearson murmured.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm Hunters did whatever they could to hide but in the end, only three of them managed to survive. It was truly highly unlikely that they would still be alive after so long.
<br><br>
"There's another possibility," the Snake Goddess said as she pointed upwards. "What if they went on to the Jade Pure Realm?"
<br><br>
Unlike Pearson, the Snake Goddess chose to be more optimistic. The roads in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains all led to the Pure Sky Platforms after all, and this cave was no exception.
<br><br>
Since the human heroes were trapped in this cave for so long then that meant they had all the time in the world to ascend to the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement with this assumption. "Master Campbell, do you know how we can go to the Jade Pure Realm?"
<br><br>
As a world builder, Campbell was undoubtedly the one who was the most familiar and knowledgeable about all this. "I know that this path leads to the Night View Island. It's a huge and independent Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, I didn't design this path. Let me think for a second..."
<br><br>
Though he was a world builder, Campbell only partly participated in the construction of the chaos. He didn't know about all the specifics.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he was quite close to his colleagues and had a general understanding of what they did when they built the passages. He walked towards the pool and scooped out a handful of clear water. Soon enough, a smile broke through his features.
<br><br>
"Boil the water," he told Zen.
<br><br>
The man's eyes widened in astonishment. "Boil the water?" he repeated to make sure he heard Campbell right.
<br><br>
It wouldn't be difficult since the pool wasn't that big but Zen was just caught off-guard by the strangeness of the request.
<br><br>
"Yes. Don't worry, you'll find out why when you boil it," Campbell assured him.
<br><br>
Since there was really nothing else to do, Zen took on Campbell's strange request and jumped into the pool. He originally wanted to activate the Godly Way energy but the Primeval Lord of Heaven who was in Zen's inner world was too impatient and directly asked Zhurong to move.
<br><br>
There was a flash of red light and the entire pool immediately began to boil.
<br><br>
Zhurong's powers were at work and if he went all out then he could instantly evaporate the water within the pool.
<br><br>
As the entire pool boiled, a miraculous scene appeared.
<br><br>
A crooked red path appeared in the originally clear and transparent pond.
<br><br>
This path exhibited many twists and turns as it extended all the way down to the bottom.
<br><br>
Pearson, who always had a deadpan expression, sported a look of surprise.
<br><br>
"Is that the entrance?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded. "I think so."
<br><br>
Fuxi could only stare at the sight in shock. "To think the entrance is actually hidden like this. Who would ever have thought of boiling the water?"
<br><br>
Once upon a time, the thirty-nine human heroes got trapped here and tried every means to find the passage out of this place. At some point, one of them probably boiled the water on accident and discovered what was previously hidden.
<br><br>
Zen soon emerged from the water and waved everyone in to follow him as he swam along the red path.
<br><br>
Not willing to be left behind, everyone quickly jumped into the water and followed Zen.
<br><br>
It wasn't until they reached the bottom that they saw a door constructed out of pure light open for them. Zen entered first, followed closely by his companions.
<br><br>
"Splash!"
<br><br>
As soon as he crossed the threshold, Zen immediately felt as if his world was spinning. He was previously swimming downward but now everything was upside down and he was headed upwards.
<br><br>
When his vision stabilized, he saw a passageway above him.
<br><br>
They were very familiar with this passageway. They had grabbed onto fish hooks when they went to the first Pure Sky Platform, but it seemed they had to manually swim their way up this time to reach the Pure Sky Platform they were heading to.
<br><br>
Nobody talked much, too focused on moving their limbs to swim their way up. They'd eventually reach their destination this way, right? Wrong.
<br><br>
The group swam for quite a while but there was no indication that they were getting closer towards the Pure Sky Platform. Zen quickly surfaced and found himself in the middle of the passageway! Splash! Splash! Splash...
<br><br>
Everyone looked around in confusion when they saw where they were.
<br><br>
King Ieuan was the first to speak. "We're still in the passageway?"
<br><br>
"Look!" the Snake Goddess exclaimed as she pointed upwards.
<br><br>
They originally swam upwards in an effort to reach the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
However, when they looked up, they saw that the passageway was cut in half. They were in the lower half and the other half of the passageway hung above their heads.
<br><br>
"This passageway seems to have been intentionally destroyed by someone,"
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi remarked in observation.
<br><br>
"Who?" King Ieuan asked. Just who would do such a thing? "Maybe we're right and the real human heroes did arrive at the Pure Sky Platform," the Snake Goddess said as she continued to look up.
<br><br>
"Why do you think so?" Yasamin asked.
<br><br>
"If those real human heroes found this passageway then they would safely arrive at Pure Sky Platform. However, the Element Spirit Civilization would still be hot at their heels," the Snake Goddess stated with a smile. "If they truly wanted to escape then they had to make sure they couldn't be followed. Breaking the passageway was the best choice to make sure their pursuers would never be able to go the same way they did."
<br><br>
Chapter 4039 The Possibility Of Repair According to Campbell, this place called the Night View Island was an independent Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
There was no way to cross the Pure Sky Platforms. Once the passageway was destroyed, the pursuers could no longer chase the human heroes.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess judged reasonably.
<br><br>
Both Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven in his inner world agreed.
<br><br>
"Since the passageway is broken, can't we fly there?" suggested Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The passageway hanging above was reachable that everyone could easily fly to it.
<br><br>
"Let's have a try."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess snapped her fingers and her shadow stretched out from behind her. It then turned into a blood-red bird and flew upward.
<br><br>
At more than one hundred feet away, the shadow disappeared without a trace. It appeared to be swallowed by a monster in the void.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess narrowed her eyes, surprised. She shrugged at Zen and said, "It seems that this place also belongs to the Jade Pure Realm."
<br><br>
The area beyond the Pure Sky Platforms in the Jade Pure Realm devoured all the energies and materials in it. It was dangerous to fly there.
<br><br>
Zen looked at Campbell floating on the surface of the water and asked, "Master Campbell, can you find a way through this passageway?"
<br><br>
Campbell didn't answer. Instead, he swam to the edge of the water and stretched out his hand to explore outside the passageway. "We can't pass through it," he said. "There's so much Void Dust in this area."
<br><br>
"Void Dust?" Zen asked with a puzzled look.
<br><br>
Campbell replied, "The Jade Pure Realm is filled with dust that cannot be seen. You can imagine it as invisible dust, and anything that gets close to it will be devoured."
<br><br>
The shadow that the Snake Goddess released was indeed devoured by the Void Dust.
<br><br>
These people were subject to many restrictions since they were all from the chaos.
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was already of great power in itself. Aside from helping Zen understand Sanskrit, it could even restore the white light dots in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
However, the so-called Void Dust didn't have a white light dot, so the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was unable to decode it.
<br><br>
The others attempted to access the area, following the Snake Goddess's example.
<br><br>
Pearson released a living creature. It was a black bat from the Supreme Pure Realm which was highly toxic. Pearson wanted to tame it for his use after capturing it, but he had not succeeded. Therefore, he decided to throw it away.
<br><br>
Whoosh! After departing from his hand, the black bat darted forward like a weapon.
<br><br>
It didn't know where it was, but it was glad that it could finally get rid of Pearson. No one could catch its speed now.
<br><br>
However, its excitement lasted only for a short while. Coming to its senses, it felt its body being devoured and quickly disappeared.
<br><br>
Energies couldn't make it through the passageway, and neither could living creatures.
<br><br>
"There is a way to deal with the Void Dust. Only the Spiritual Boat can pass through it, so I don't know what exactly to do," said Campbell after the bat had disappeared.
<br><br>
Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven in his inner world were saddened.
<br><br>
The hearts of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and all the other heroes sank after the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization translated Campbell's words.
<br><br>
"So this Pure Sky Platform is a dead end?" Zen asked hopelessly.
<br><br>
"In a sense, yes." Campbell nodded and thought for a while. "Unless we find a way to repair the passageway."
<br><br>
"Repair the passageway?" Zen's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
Seeing the excited expression on his face, Campbell smiled as he shook his head. "Forget it. There was a way back then, but over a thousand chaotic eras have passed. I'm afraid the material needed doesn't exist anymore."
<br><br>
"What material?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
He knew that the material needed to repair the passageway was by no means ordinary, but he was unwilling to give up.
<br><br>
The energy souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other people in his inner world were also waiting. As long as there was the slightest chance, they refused to quit.
<br><br>
"It's the Eternal Twilight Seed," Campbell said. "It looks like a copper pea and it's found in the main world."
<br><br>
"The seed from the main world..." Zen murmured.
<br><br>
In his inner world, everyone's face was painted with hesitation.
<br><br>
When it came to the Abstruse Energy World, everything was extremely complicated. They couldn't do anything about it.
<br><br>
"The Eternal Twilight Seed is very unique. It is actually a kind of metal but is also a plant. It is a live metal that grows up with superior stability," said Campbell, his hand patting the edge of the passageway. "After its metal branch stretches out, the hollow branch will form a passageway and a huge, flat corolla is formed at the end. With some simple pruning, it will quickly form a Pure Sky Platform."
<br><br>
During that time, it was a mature plan to build the top of a world with the Eternal Twilight Seed. It was also a necessary skill for every world builder.
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows slightly upon Campbell's mention of the metal branch. "Master Campbell, how big is the branch of the Eternal Twilight Seed?" he asked.
<br><br>
"It will be this huge after the seed fully grows up," said Campbell, pointing at the passageway. The passageway and even the Pure Sky Platform sprung from the Eternal Twilight Seed.
<br><br>
"But the branch that has just sprouted is about this big," Campbell said extending his arms.
<br><br>
"Is it metal-colored all over, with flower on it?" Zen's eyes glistened.
<br><br>
The conversation between him and Campbell relied on the group of people singing in his inner world. Naturally, Campbell and the others couldn't sense his mood fluctuations.
<br><br>
However, when he transmitted his words into his inner world, his voice was abnormally excited.
<br><br>
Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others also experienced violent mood swings.
<br><br>
Campbell nodded. "That flower is the one that needs to be pruned. Have you seen one before?"
<br><br>
On Zen's right hand, an azure square appeared out of nowhere. He reached out his hand, gently pinched it, and took out a metal branch. "I wonder if this is the metal branch you mentioned," he said, showing it to Campbell.
<br><br>
Not long after Zen entered the Other Shore, he obtained this metal branch in the Sacred Mallow Temple.
<br><br>
He had once shown it to the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others, but none of them knew what it was.
<br><br>
Campbell glanced at the metal branch and took it from Zen's hand. "At least two thousand Pure Sky Platforms hadn't been completed at that time, and these two thousand Eternal Twilight Seeds must have all sprouted and grown into such branches."
<br><br>
The metal branches were exquisite in appearance. They didn't respond to any energy, so they couldn't be used as Other Shore Tokens. It was believed that they had some magical characteristics yet to be discovered.
<br><br>
However, they couldn't grow into Pure Sky Platforms without the world builders.
<br><br>
In addition, normal methods couldn't destroy them. For more than a thousand chaotic eras, they had spread all over the Other Shore. Zen had encountered just one of them.
<br><br>
The Dreaded Eye Demons obtained a metal branch by chance. Like many other races on the Other Shore, they studied it for a long time but didn't find out how to use it. In the end, they hid it in the Sacred Mallow Temple as rubbish, only to be retrieved by Zen later.
<br><br>
Chapter 4040 The Lake King Ieuan stared intently at the metal branch for a while. Finally, it couldn't contain itself and blurted, "Zen, what's the use of this thing?"
<br><br>
Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Snake Goddess, and the Eternal Realm Hunters were curious.
<br><br>
After all, they couldn't understand the conversation between Zen and Campbell.
<br><br>
"This metal branch can be used to make a Pure Sky Platform," Zen answered. "It should also be able to repair this passageway."
<br><br>
"Really?" Fuxi couldn't conceal the excitement in his voice.
<br><br>
"Every cloud has a silver lining," the Snake Goddess said with a gentle smile. She wasn't surprised that Zen's luck was taking a turn for the better.
<br><br>
"I once sold two such branches," King Ieuan said wistfully. "Everyone thought that they were useless. They were so hard to sell!"
<br><br>
Everyone glanced at King Ieuan speechlessly.
<br><br>
Even Zen was a little surprised, but he quickly understood why.
<br><br>
The metal branches had an extraordinary appearance. According to Campbell, two thousand Eternal Twilight Seeds grew into metal branches at that time, but they were not able to form Pure Sky Platforms.
<br><br>
These metal branches were difficult to destroy, so it wasn't unusual for them to show up on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If a creature obtained one, it was inevitable that they wouldn't be able to unravel the mysteries within, so their best bet was to just sell the metal branch. It was not strange that King Ieuan came across one or two of these in the past.
<br><br>
What was important now was there was hope to repair the Pure Sky Platform, but first, they needed to leave the passageway.
<br><br>
Campbell took everyone back through the passageway. When they reached the bottom, they reached a dead end. The entrance was nowhere to be found! "Boil the water," Campbell ordered.
<br><br>
From Zen's inner world, Zhurong was about to make a move but then Pearson suddenly said, "Let me do it."
<br><br>
As he spread out his hands, blood red flames blossomed around his body.
<br><br>
Like magic, the entrance that had vanished now reappeared! Everyone shuffled through the entrance and stepped into the cave. The pool in the cave was connected to the passageway, so the water in the pool was also boiling.
<br><br>
"Zen, take your companions out of the pool," Campbell barked.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and took everyone to leave the pool.
<br><br>
Once the last person had stepped out of the pool, Campbell stood on the surface of the water, his expression becoming extremely serious.
<br><br>
He used to be an expert in building worlds, but he hadn't done this for many years.
<br><br>
Splash! He put one hand in the pool and began to stir the water gently.
<br><br>
Although his movements were gentle, the pool began to quake violently.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Soon, a huge whirlpool was formed inside the pool, and it spun towards the entrance at the bottom of the pool.
<br><br>
At the same time, Campbell raised the metal branch high above his head.
<br><br>
He reached out to grab the air beside the metal branch. He didn't touch it, but it suddenly began to shake.
<br><br>
Then, the look on his face grew more serious. He gently picked the metal branch, and then a white dot of light appeared on its bottom.
<br><br>
"This light dot..." Zen raised his eyebrows curiously.
<br><br>
Logically speaking, there shouldn't be any white light dots in the chaos.
<br><br>
The only exception in the chaos should be the Cold Prisons, due to the extremely low temperature.
<br><br>
But now, the metal branch broke this rule, which naturally surprised Zen.
<br><br>
As Campbell continued to pick, light dots appeared one after another. After these light dots fell into the whirlpool in the center of the pool, they were pulled into the entrance at the bottom of the whirlpool. From there, they drilled into the passageway to the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The others didn't understand what these dots of light entailed, but Zen did.
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization continuously deciphered these light dots and transmitted a picture to Zen's eyes. Then he saw that one end of the metal branch had grown rapidly and spread into the water, until finally it drilled into the bottom of the pool.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! As the water in the pool whirled faster and faster, more and more parts of the branch extended into the pool.
<br><br>
In the others' eyes, they could only see more and more white light dots emerging.
<br><br>
However, the passageway in the Jade Pure Realm underwent big changes.
<br><br>
After the white light dots drilled into the Jade Pure Realm, they quickly formed a huge metal branch, which was still growing steadily. The metal branch quickly drilled through the broken parts of the passageway and grew all the way to the Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
Then the metal branch became thicker and thicker, gradually filling the entire passageway.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! As the metal branch expanded, cracks appeared on the surface of the old passageway and chunks of it fell off, until all that was left of the broken passageway was a pile of debris.
<br><br>
When the broken passageway collapsed, a shiny new metal branch appeared.
<br><br>
There was no white light spot released from the metal branch in Campbell's hand, but the bud at the top of the metal branch was shining with a bright red light, as if it was about to bloom at any moment now.
<br><br>
Once the bud bloomed, it would form a huge Pure Sky Platform.
<br><br>
However, if the Pure Sky Platform was formed here, the people present would be crushed to death.
<br><br>
Campbell carefully sealed the bud up. The bright red light disappeared and was replaced with a dull grey color.
<br><br>
"Zen, can you give me the rest of the metal branch?" Campbell asked.
<br><br>
Zen smiled faintly. "It belongs to you. I'm just returning it to its rightful owner. You don't need to ask for my permission."
<br><br>
Campbell nodded and smiled back. After putting away the metal branch, he said, "The repair has been completed. You can go in now."
<br><br>
Everyone once again jumped into the water and swam into the passageway along the brand new, glowing red path in the pool.
<br><br>
The size and width of the passageway were exactly the same as before, but the inner wall looked very new. After all, it had just been completed.
<br><br>
"Creak! Why is this new passageway also full of water?" King Ieuan asked as it swam upward.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess speculated, "Maybe the end of this passageway is connected to a water source. When the new passageway was formed, the water naturally flowed down quickly to fill the entire passageway."
<br><br>
King Ieuan was somewhat skeptical. When it swam to the end of the passageway with the crowd, it was surprised to find that they ended up in another pool of water.
<br><br>
When they finally reached the surface of the water, they all came out with a splash. As they took in their surroundings, their eyes widened in surprise.
<br><br>
It was just as the Snake Goddess said, they were in the center of a lake.
<br><br>
The Night View Island was a very huge Pure Sky Platform. Although it was not as big as the main one, it was over a thousand times larger than the one Zen and the others had been to before. The lake in the center of the island occupied more than half of its area.
<br><br>
The lake was surrounded by grayish mountains. In the night, these mountains were like demons and monsters lying on the ground, emitting a quiet and unsettling aura.
<br><br>
Although this place was not the main Pure Sky Platform, it was still within the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
According to the information they had obtained so far, the Treacherous Beings should come from the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
So it wouldn't have been surprising if they encountered powerful Treacherous Beings here in the Night View Island.
<br><br>
After they left the surface of the water, they flew closely to the mirror like lake. Everyone, including Campbell, tried to move as quietly as possible, so as to not draw any attention to themselves.
<br><br>
Chapter 4041 The Strange Pattern Zen flew ahead of the group. Just as he was about to reach the lake shore, he spread out his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
The spiritual sense was a handy method of surveying one's surroundings; it made studying things at a distance easier, and even the things hidden underground could be detected by it.
<br><br>
However, just as Zen's spiritual sense swept over the terrain beside the lake, a strange image suddenly appeared in his mind.
<br><br>
It was a circle with ten animal teeth hanging around it! Crack! The circle spun violently, and the animal teeth began to flash ominously.
<br><br>
Then, Zen suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his mind, which made him almost cry out.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and three Eternal Realm Hunters also released their spiritual senses, as Zen did. They also saw the circular pattern. In unison, they all started crying out in pain.
<br><br>
"Ouch!"
<br><br>
"What is that? It hurts!"
<br><br>
"My spiritual sense is affected..."
<br><br>
When Zen came to his senses, he glanced back at the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the rest in dismay.
<br><br>
"Do you see anything with your spiritual sense?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"A ring with ten teeth embedded in it," Pearson replied concisely.
<br><br>
"I saw it, too! Squeak! Squeak!" King Ieuan exclaimed with a pained expression.
<br><br>
Fuxi studied the bank of the lake in the distance, his forehead creasing in fear.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, one should be able to send out their spiritual sense unimpeded. However, some special things could block the spiritual sense.
<br><br>
There were even more powerful things and creatures that could devour the spiritual sense, causing it to disappear without a trace.
<br><br>
This time, their spiritual senses didn't bounce back or disappear after moving around the area. However, what their spiritual senses revealed was the ring inlaid with teeth.
<br><br>
This was very strange, as though someone had deliberately shown them this.
<br><br>
Everyone discussed in low voices, but they couldn't seem to come to a conclusion.
<br><br>
Zen asked Campbell about it, but even Campbell was confused. "The Night View Island is a relatively large Pure Sky Platform, and we haven't arranged anything on it," he said. "I've never heard of the ability of affecting the spiritual sense that you just mentioned..."
<br><br>
As the builder of the world, Campbell was very familiar with the chaos and even the worlds outside it, but even his knowledge was limited here.
<br><br>
"I'll go ashore first, and you follow me," suggested Zen.
<br><br>
The people present had witnessed Zen's almost endless life energy, so they all nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
Zen flew to the lakeshore quickly. He was about to land on a large boulder.
<br><br>
Boom! The second Zen's foot stepped on the rock, a sickeningly loud explosion went off in his ears. His forehead seemed to have been hit hard by a heavy wooden stick. The moment his mind went blank, the ring inlaid with teeth appeared again! "What happened?" Zen frowned, wincing in pain.
<br><br>
Although what just happened was a bit strange, Zen figured it was still safe enough to call the others. Zen still said to the Snake Goddess, "You all can come over now. Be careful when you land. There seems to be a strange spiritual attack..."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded and went ashore with Fuxi and the others.
<br><br>
Boom! As soon as the Snake Goddess landed on the ground, she was also hit heavily. Her face turned pale, but after a while, she seemed to gather her bearings.
<br><br>
The same thing happened to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin and the rest.
<br><br>
The reactions of King Ieuan and Fuxi were the greatest. They fell on their knees, writhing in pain.
<br><br>
Campbell, on the other hand, landed with ease. He was the only one who didn't feel anything when he stepped on the ground.
<br><br>
"I saw that ring again..."
<br><br>
"There is no spiritual attack nearby...."
<br><br>
"What is this?"
<br><br>
Everyone was filled with worry, especially the three Eternal Realm Hunters.
<br><br>
They had lived in a dangerous environment for so long, and they were trained to stay vigilant at all times. If they were not careful enough, they were in danger stumbling on death's door. Usually, when they encountered this phenomenon which was hard to explain, they figured the best they could do was to keep highly vigilant and be suspicious of everything.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, try to communicate with the Civilization Artifact again," Zen said to the Primeval Lord of Heaven in his inner world.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had already been prepared. With Zen's order, he appeared on the top of the book. As the pages were turned, the Civilization Artifact tried to contact the real human heroes.
<br><br>
The energy souls of the real human heroes, including the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Emperor Charm, Zhurong and the others, also gathered around the book. They all wanted to know the result as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Splash, splash...
<br><br>
The pages stopped moving, and it began to glow with a green light.
<br><br>
The energy souls of human heroes immediately connected to the book, trying to accept the information that was transmitted from the book.
<br><br>
Boom! The reaction of these energy souls was exactly the same as that of Zen and the others when they landed on the shore. They had also been attacked and seen the ring with ten teeth...
<br><br>
Although the energy souls still had their powerful theurgies, they were very weak in terms of soul. A stronger soul attack was enough to seriously injure them.
<br><br>
However, the ring's attack did not cause any damage. It only made the people who saw it wince in pain.
<br><br>
Although these energy souls covered their heads and cried for help, thankfully, they were not injured at all.
<br><br>
"Even the Civilization Artifact can be affected..." Zen was speechless.
<br><br>
"The Night View Island might be enveloped by some kind of magical power. You can only explore it with your physical bodies," the Primeval Lord of Heaven suggested.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. They had come a long way to get here, and it was futile for them to even consider giving up.
<br><br>
Although the Night View Island was by no means small, they hoped to be able to gather some clues around the ominous-looking mountains.
<br><br>
Surrounding the lake shore was a greyish-white forest.
<br><br>
When he was flying past the lake earlier, he saw that everything on the Night View Island was grey-white, and now even the forest was in the same color. Out of curiosity, he went forward and picked a leaf. As soon as he took the leaf from a tree, a layer of grey-white ashes fell to the ground, revealing a large emerald leaf.
<br><br>
It turned out that these trees were not grey-white, but their surfaces were covered in a layer of ashes! "Is there any volcano on the Night View Island?" The Snake Goddess's eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
If there were any volcanoes on this island that erupted, it would explain why the entire place was covered in ashes.
<br><br>
Fuxi shrugged as he reached out to pick a leaf. Cautiously, he sniffed at the dust on the leaf, and said, "This is not volcanic ash. There is no smell of sulfur."
<br><br>
Zen also asked for confirmation from Campbell. Campbell said that there was no volcano set up on the island when the Night View Island was built.
<br><br>
"There has to be some reason why there's dust all over the island..." Sawyer scratched his chin, pondering aloud.
<br><br>
"No." Pearson shook his head and pointed at a place not far away. "Look, the ashes are not evenly distributed. Only the flowers and trees have ashes, but there is no dust in other places..."
<br><br>
After careful observation, Zen and the others found that what Pearson said was true.
<br><br>
Except for the flowers and trees, there was no ash on the rocks and the ground.
<br><br>
"This is very strange," the Snake Goddess said with a deep frown. "Either the ashes belong to the plants, or they have been sprinkled on them by someone..."
<br><br>
Just as everyone was confused, Zen saw something from the corner of his eye. Turning to see what it was, he was surprised to see that a white claw stretched out from one of the trees with a handful of ashes, carefully sprinkling them on the leaves.
<br><br>
The emerald leaves Zen just dusted were now covered in grey-white ashes once more.
<br><br>
Chapter 4042 The Ghost Powder The white claw continued to scatter ashes.
<br><br>
Soon, the emerald green leaves were covered with a layer of ashes again.
<br><br>
Zen and the others stood still and carefully observed the movements of the claw.
<br><br>
Even from afar, they were sure that it was a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
However, they noticed that the disgusting aura emanating from the creature was not as strong as those of the previous ones that they had faced.
<br><br>
Although thick leaves were blocking their view, they could still make out its appearance. It was like a sluggish sloth that actually looked adorable.
<br><br>
After the sloth-like Treacherous Being spread a layer of ashes on the plants, it jumped down from the branch and slowly approached Zen's group.
<br><br>
"What does it want to do now?" Fuxi asked as he stared at it warily.
<br><br>
Seeing that the Treacherous Being started walking towards them, Sawyer and Thurston instinctively took out the sand-sized Holy Stones. Just before they activated the stones, Pearson stopped them and looked at them while shaking his head.
<br><br>
The sloth was just a hostility-level Treacherous Being and didn't impose any threat. Thus, Peterson deemed that it wasn't necessary to activate the Light of Annihilation just to frighten it.
<br><br>
Zen actually had the same thought in mind. He just stood still and watched the creature as it walked towards him.
<br><br>
The creature suddenly stopped in front of Zen. Then, it started pointing at the sky, showing a frightened expression.
<br><br>
"What is it trying to say?" Zen's brows furrowed as he didn't understand what it meant.
<br><br>
"It's pointing to the sky with a frightened expression. Is there something in the sky that makes it scared? Or does it want some kind of help?" King Ieuan tried to make a guess.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked around before looking up in the sky. "It might be saying that there is a threat in the sky, but I don't think it wants any help."
<br><br>
As a native of the place, the creature was much more familiar with the environment than them. Moreover, the fact that it was an immortal and had low intelligence meant that there should only be few things that could scare it.
<br><br>
"If that's not the case, then does it want to help us instead? But I don't think that's more plausible," Yasamin said coldly as her eyes were glued to the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"Well, there are different kinds of Treacherous Beings. Some like to possess other creatures, while others like killing. We can't rule out the possibility that there are types that are kind to others. For example, Campbell stands on our side after he fully awakened," the Snake Goddess explained with a smile.
<br><br>
"I don't know about that… These monsters are just—"
<br><br>
Zen hushed Yasamin before she could utter another word. He knew what everyone thought about the Treacherous Beings, but he also thought that the Snake Goddess was right. There were so few things that they knew about them, so they couldn't just conclude anything.
<br><br>
After the sloth-like creature repeatedly pointed at the sky, it reached into a pouch in its abdomen. It was filled with the grayish-white ashes that it had been scattering. It grabbed a handful of the ashes and attempted to sprinkle them on Zen's feet.
<br><br>
As a conditioned reflex, Zen immediately stepped back to avoid the ashes.
<br><br>
The creature sensed Zen's vigilance upon its action, so it started pointing towards the sky again. Its eyes revealed a trace of sincerity as if pleading him not to avoid the ashes. Afterward, it walked towards Zen again with some ashes in its hand.
<br><br>
At this moment, a feathered arrow suddenly shot out from a distance.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The arrow gushed at an incredible speed, and it firmly nailed the ground just in front of the creature.
<br><br>
At the sight of the arrow that instantly landed in front of it, the sloth-like creature was startled. It made a few somersaults and hurriedly climbed a tree.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Two arrows fired in rapid succession and shot towards the tree where the creature hid.
<br><br>
Even with the thick forest blocking the shooter's view, the arrows that were shot landed accurately. They struck the trunk of the tree, and the creature was directly behind it.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! The sloth-like creature quickly got down from the tree and rushed deeper into the forest to hide.
<br><br>
Although they realized that the arrows were not aimed at them, Zen and the others didn't let their guards down.
<br><br>
With this, the three Eternal Realm Hunters dispersed and looked around.
<br><br>
Deeming that it would be much faster to call out the one responsible for it, Fuxi yelled coldly, "Who shot those arrows? Show yourself right now!"
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, a short creature emerged from the other side of the forest. His attributes were very similar to a human child's. His face was just a bit bigger than usual, but was actually good-looking. He could just be differentiated from humans because of his long green tail with a flat leaf-like end.
<br><br>
"Don't be afraid. I've just driven off the Treacherous Being," the short creature said.
<br><br>
When everyone heard that he could speak the standard human language, their tensed bodies began to relax a little.
<br><br>
The Night View Island was a very anomalous place. Though they hadn't encountered any extreme danger, they might instantly fall into a bad situation if they were not careful enough in this unknown environment.
<br><br>
That said, it would be great if someone could be their guide.
<br><br>
They immediately thought that he could be a big help since he looked so kind and sincere, and he also instantly helped them drive off the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"Thank you for your help and I apologize for yelling before." Fuxi cupped his hands and showed his gratitude to the creature.
<br><br>
"You're welcome," he answered with an innocent smile. He then approached and sniffed them, saying, "Your auras are very unfamiliar. Are you perhaps from the outside world?"
<br><br>
"That's right. We are from outside of the Night View Island," Fuxi replied with a nod. "Then, are you a native of the island?"
<br><br>
"Yes. I'm a member of the Wooden Leaf race. You can call me Decker," the creature said as he introduced himself. "It was fortunate that I was around.
<br><br>
You were in grave danger just now," he continued.
<br><br>
"Grave danger? Why?" The Snake Goddess was shocked at his statement that she couldn't help asking right away.
<br><br>
"That Treacherous Being is evil," Decker said as he pointed towards the direction where the sloth-like creature ran off. "It wanted to sprinkle the Ghost Powder on you."
<br><br>
"Ghost Powder? I've never heard of that. What does it do?" the Snake Goddess curiously asked again.
<br><br>
The smile on Decker's face instantly vanished as he started explaining, "Every night, certain creatures will come down from the sky. They will come here and devour all the living things that are sprinkled with the Ghost Powder."
<br><br>
When they heard this, there was a variety of expressions that appeared on their faces.
<br><br>
Some frowned, while others raised their eyebrows. Some eyes widened, and some mouths opened.
<br><br>
Zen was one of the most shocked because his feet were almost sprinkled with the Ghost Powder. The three Eternal Realm Hunters exchanged glances with each other.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess tried to remain calm and continued asking, "These creatures that you're pertaining, are they Treacherous Beings too?"
<br><br>
"Yes, you're correct. They are the powerful hatred-level Treacherous Beings," Decker said with a straight face.
<br><br>
"Wait! Did you just say hatred-level Treacherous Beings?!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi wasn't able to keep his composure.
<br><br>
All of them were utterly shocked. No one could hide their surprise and anxiety as they heard what Decker said.
<br><br>
In the last Pure Sky Platform, they happened to face a resentment-level Treacherous Being. If it weren't for Zen's explosive power at the most critical moment, they would have been dead already.
<br><br>
It wasn't an understatement to say that they just got lucky to surpass that hurdle. They were not even sure if they could successfully beat a resentment-level Treacherous Being next time. Now, if it was true that hatred-level Treacherous Beings would come and assault them, there probably was a zero chance of them surviving.
<br><br>
Instinctively, King Ieuan, Yasamin, and the others took a few steps back.
<br><br>
They were relatively close to the part of the forest where the sloth-like creature sprinkled the Ghost Powder. Knowing that it could attract the hatred-level Treacherous Beings, they had to make sure that they had absolutely no contact with it.
<br><br>
"You said that the hatred-level Treacherous Beings only attack the living things that are sprinkled with the Ghost Powder. So, as long as we don't come into contact with it, we should be fine then, right?" Zen asked after thinking about it for a while.
<br><br>
Then, with an innocent smile on his face, Decker answered, "Hmm, no. You will still be in danger."
<br><br>
Chapter 4043 Collecting "You are outsiders. Of course, you don't know the cruelty of the Night View Island. Generally, outsiders are killed on the first night!" Decker's face turned pale. "The Night View Island is full of Treacherous Beings. There are a lot of hostility-level Treacherous Beings which are the weakest ones.
<br><br>
There are also some stronger resentment-level Treacherous Beings, not to mention the hatred-level Treacherous Beings which are the overlords of the island!"
<br><br>
Thurston, Sawyer, and Pearson looked at each other hesitantly.
<br><br>
Although the Night View Island was many times larger than the previous Pure Sky Platform, it was still small compared to the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The hostility-level Treacherous Beings and resentment-level Treacherous Beings, which appeared occasionally in the Supreme Pure Realm, could wreck everything there. Many Treacherous Beings inhabited such a small island, so one could only imagine how dangerous it was! Pearson was thinking of persuading the others to return to the Supreme Pure Realm. He had to leave along with Sawyer and Thurston even if they couldn't retreat.
<br><br>
After all, as long as a hatred-level Treacherous Being appeared, everyone would die. Staying there and continuing to explore was no different from courting death.
<br><br>
"Almost all the Treacherous Beings are very dangerous. How did you survive?" The Snake Goddess stared straight at Decker as if attempting to read his mind.
<br><br>
"The members of our Wooden Leaf race have fought with the Treacherous Beings for countless years. Countless members have sacrificed during the battles so we could live..." Decker sighed as he appeared to relive past events.
<br><br>
"Is there any safe place in the Night View Island?" King Ieuan asked.
<br><br>
"Yes." Decker nodded.
<br><br>
"Where?" King Ieuan asked again, this time with eagerness.
<br><br>
"Our race's territory," Decker replied.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Can we go there?" King Ieuan was almost hurrying to go.
<br><br>
Decker smiled instantly and said, "Of course, our Wooden Leaf race like to help outsiders the most. There are often some who seek our protection. You can come with me!"
<br><br>
"Okay!" King Ieuan answered with excitement.
<br><br>
Decker then proceeded to lead the way.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Zen, and the Eternal Realm Hunters refused to move. They were doubtful deep inside.
<br><br>
There were some races on the Other Shore who were kind and willing to help others. Decker seemed to be a trustworthy person, but some of his words sounded suspicious.
<br><br>
He claimed that the Wooden Leaf race often helped outsiders, but the Night View Island was originally isolated. There was no way to enter it.
<br><br>
They had just repaired the only passage. How could there have been outsiders before? He also said that if the Ghost Powder was applied to a living creature, it would attract something from the sky. Weren't these plants considered living beings on the island? If so, how did all the plants on the island manage to stay undamaged? Moreover, Decker didn't seem to be surprised upon seeing Campbell who was also a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"King Ieuan," the Snake Goddess uttered.
<br><br>
King Ieuan turned around and blinked. Through its life vitality, it told the crowd, "We are not familiar with this place. It's too strange. We need to know more about it."
<br><br>
"But..." The Snake Goddess hesitated.
<br><br>
"You're right. We can't communicate with those Treacherous Beings, but we can talk to this race," Fuxi said to everyone. "Besides, both the sloth and the member of the Wooden Leaf race mentioned that something powerful would descend from the sky. We can't find out if we just stay and explore here. It's much more dangerous!"
<br><br>
"That's true," Zen agreed. "The biggest problem is the Ghost Powder."
<br><br>
The Treacherous Being had let them apply the Ghost Powder to avoid the things from the sky. What Decker said was the complete opposite, implying that the Ghost Powder would cause disaster. Thus, one of them must be lying.
<br><br>
Although Zen tended to believe the Treacherous Being, the Treacherous Being did not have intelligence and he could not obtain information from it.
<br><br>
He would pay a price if he misunderstood the meaning of the words.
<br><br>
"It's simple." Pearson moved his lips slightly. "I'll collect the Ghost Powder.
<br><br>
It can be used in critical moments!"
<br><br>
Pearson's suggestion was a valuable compromise.
<br><br>
"Thank you," Zen commended him.
<br><br>
After discussing for a while, the crowd started to follow Decker.
<br><br>
Low-lying areas and sloping fields lined the way with an uneven pattern.
<br><br>
Occasionally, a layer of ashes covered the green grass and trees.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
A gust of wind suddenly blew over while the trees swayed gently to its rhythm.
<br><br>
The Ghost Powder that had been sprinkled on the surface of the trees fell, revealing a large area of green leaves.
<br><br>
Splash! From the trees, white claws suddenly stretched out, holding a handful of ashes. Then the sloth-like Treacherous Beings carefully covered the trees with ashes again.
<br><br>
"Look!"
<br><br>
"There are Treacherous Beings!"
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Beings are really everywhere on the Night View Island..."
<br><br>
After some sloths finished sprinkling the ashes, they noticed Zen and his companions. They grabbed a handful of ashes and climbed down the trees, walking towards them.
<br><br>
According to the first sloth's movements, they were aiming to sprinkle ashes on the group's bodies.
<br><br>
However, just as these sloths took a few steps forward, Decker raised his hand and shot arrows at them.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The arrows were planted to the ground in front of the sloths, which immediately scared them back to the trees.
<br><br>
Seeing the sloths' timidity, Fuxi, Pearson, and the others curled their lips in confidence.
<br><br>
Not all of the Treacherous Beings were born strong, and some were indeed weak.
<br><br>
While walking, Pearson glanced at his hand and peeled off a spider thread from one of his fingers.
<br><br>
The spider thread trailed all the way to the nearby forest. It spread up a tree and continuously weaved into a broken hand of Pearson. With a flick of the hand, a blue ring appeared. It was Pearson's Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
The hand continued to shake the leaves. It caused the Ghost Powder to fall from the leaves and branches, collecting it into the Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
The movement of the hand soon attracted a few sloths. They took out the Ghost Powder from their pockets again and went to sprinkle it to the hand.
<br><br>
This was exactly what Pearson wanted, so he used his Sumeru Space to collect and store the Ghost Powder.
<br><br>
Several sloths kept sprinkling the Ghost Powder, which was all absorbed by the Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
Although they felt confused and wondered why the Ghost Powder couldn't fully cover the hand, they continued doing so. They took out all the Ghost Powder from their pockets and sprinkled until the last bit. After they had none left, they turned around and left.
<br><br>
Not long after, Pearson had collected almost all of the Ghost Powder. After that, the hand turned back into a single spider thread and drew back into Pearson's body.
<br><br>
Everything happened without anyone noticing.
<br><br>
After a long walk, they arrived at the nearest mountain.
<br><br>
One side of the mountain was rowed with circular caves. As Decker led Zen and the others towards it, many members of the Wooden Leaf race drilled out from the caves.
<br><br>
These members didn't come up to welcome Decker. They stood at the entrances of the caves, like zombies staring at Zen and the rest. Their eyes were filled with coldness, hatred, and greed.
<br><br>
Chapter 4044 The Sacrificial Site As Zen and the others approached, the expressions of disgust and greed of the members of the Wooden Leaf race slowly faded.
<br><br>
They were replaced with flattering, welcoming smiles.
<br><br>
One of the members, who was wrinkly and older, walked up towards the group and bowed down. "Welcome, my friends. You have traveled far."
<br><br>
"This is our patriarch, Graham," Decker introduced.
<br><br>
Zen, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others nodded politely towards Graham.
<br><br>
Graham and Decker then toured the group around the territory of the Wooden Leaf race.
<br><br>
Their territory was made of densely packed caves that were in rows around the mountain.
<br><br>
However, the caves were only half a person high, which was enough for a member of the Wooden Leaf race to merely enter and exit.
<br><br>
For Zen, Fuxi and the other regular human beings, the caves resembled kennels. They had to get on their knees and squeeze themselves through the caves.
<br><br>
"These caves are way too small for us," Eastern Emperor Taiyi complained.
<br><br>
"Even I can't get in easily!" King Ieuan squealed.
<br><br>
Graham smiled and said, "These caves are for the short people like us to live in. Not to worry, there are larger caves above. Follow me."
<br><br>
Zen and the rest did not want to stay here, but they were overwhelmed by the hospitality of Graham, so they followed him.
<br><br>
After they climbed up about a thousand feet from one side of the mountain road, a large cave appeared at the mountainside.
<br><br>
The sun shone brightly against the entrance, revealing the cozy, dry interior of the cave. It was well maintained. A faint fragrance lingered within the cave, making it an above average temporary residence.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked around the cave and turned towards Graham. "Can this cave really resist hatred-level Treacherous Beings?"
<br><br>
"The hatred-level Treacherous Beings?" Graham chuckled. "Though there is no place on the Night View Island that can absolutely resist hatred-level Treacherous Beings, our territory can guarantee your safety."
<br><br>
Decker echoed, "Don't worry! The Wooden Leaf race has lived peacefully on the Night View Island for countless years."
<br><br>
Zen shot a look at Decker and said, "Well then, I assume this place will suffice."
<br><br>
"Of course," Decker added with a nod.
<br><br>
"Is there any other race on this island besides you?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
They wanted to have a clear understanding of the Night View Island through the members of the Wooden Leaf race. This was the main reason they followed Graham and Decker all the way.
<br><br>
"Yes. Many races reside here. There are..." One by one, Decker mentioned the races without skipping a beat.
<br><br>
"Are there humans among these races?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Humans?" Decker shrugged his shoulders. "You mean, those like you?"
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
Decker shook his head in response. "You must be from the Supreme Pure Realm. I for one, have never seen humans before."
<br><br>
Though Decker denied it, Zen noticed a hint of fear in his eyes when he'd mentioned "humans".
<br><br>
"It's almost nightfall and we still have much to prepare. Please rest here and we'll talk about it tomorrow," said Graham.
<br><br>
As he finished speaking, he pulled Decker away and they exited the cave, leaving Zen and the others to themselves.
<br><br>
Once they were out of sight, everyone's expression darkened.
<br><br>
"I think Decker is lying. He seems to know the existence of the human race, and surely he has seen at least one human in his life," Fuxi pointed out.
<br><br>
"Humans frighten him. I wonder why..." Eastern Emperor Taiyi scratched his head, confused.
<br><br>
"They sure have shitty acting skills," King Ieuan mocked with a scoff.
<br><br>
"Everything seems strange." Pearson sniffed and sneered, "Even the fragrance of the cave doesn't mask the stench of blood. This cave is probably a slaughterhouse."
<br><br>
The rest sniffed and nodded. Indeed, they could smell the blood, too.
<br><br>
The cave was wide from the outside but narrowed as it deepened. The entrance opened up to the sky, so it was most definitely not a good hiding spot.
<br><br>
As she observed the cave further, the Snake Goddess concluded, "This should not be a slaughterhouse."
<br><br>
"Then what is it?" Thurston eagerly asked. After all, the Snake Goddess was the smartest among the group.
<br><br>
"The Wooden Leaf race is so bad at lying that their lies become evident. I guess when Decker saw us, he was caught off guard. Because they weren't prepared, he lured us in and they decided to keep us here first," the Snake Goddess deduced. "This cave might not be a slaughterhouse, but it's most likely a holding unit for their prey."
<br><br>
"Might as well be a slaughterhouse," Pearson snorted.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the Snake Goddess pointed towards the entrance. "Don't forget that both the sloth and Decker mentioned that monsters would descend from the sky. Now, think about this cave again."
<br><br>
Zen pondered on it for a while. "You mean to say that the Wooden Leaf race keeps their prey in this cave to somewhat offer them as sacrifices to the monsters from the sky?"
<br><br>
"I believe so." The Snake Goddess nodded.
<br><br>
"But why?" Sawyer asked.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess smiled. "It's simple. They want protection."
<br><br>
The Wooden Leaf race didn't seem too powerful. They were at the bottom of the food chain in the Night View Island, so they had to be creative in coming up with ways of survival.
<br><br>
"If they want protection, they should have lured in weaker beings. Keeping us hostage would do them more damage," Zen said smugly.
<br><br>
Zen and his group were not to be underestimated.
<br><br>
If what they discovered was true, they would not hold back in taking revenge.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess thought for a while and added, "Perhaps if they offer stronger prey, they will be rewarded. Maybe that's why they took the risk."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi nodded in agreement. "That seems reasonable. What should we do next?"
<br><br>
"If this place is a trap, we need to leave as soon as possible," Yasamin pointed out.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess shook her head. "Though I may be right, the wildness might be more dangerous than here. I think we should stay put and figure out how to survive within the confines of this cave."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in a circular cave tucked away in the far right of their territory, Graham grunted in anger, "Why did you bring these people here? We have more than enough sacrifices! And besides, have you forgotten the miserable endings of the Thunder race and the White Bone race? Are you trying to get us all killed?"
<br><br>
As the leader of the Wooden Leaf race, Graham was well-aware of that man's strength and capabilities.
<br><br>
"These humans have nothing to do with that man. They are not strong enough and know nothing. If anything, they are the best sacrifices we can offer." A trace of malice washed over Decker's face.
<br><br>
"If that man figures it out, our race will be wiped out," Graham said monotonously. He could already tell that this was going to be a mess they couldn't clean up.
<br><br>
Decker was unmoved and replied with all confidence, "They don't know enough about the island, so they won't be able to live through one night.
<br><br>
They will die tonight, and that man will never know."
<br><br>
"But..." Graham trailed off, hesitant.
<br><br>
"Don't forget about the Evil Tiger race from the north mountain. They will never let us go! We do this for the sake of our race's continuity," Decker said calmly.
<br><br>
Graham was finally convinced. His face relaxed as he let out a heavy sigh.
<br><br>
If the sacrifice went smoothly, it would be a great harvest for the Wooden Leaf race. It was worth the risk, and there was no going back.
<br><br>
Chapter 4045 The Eye The sky turned from vivid purple to deep blue as night fell on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
When the light dimmed, the light spots in the Abstruse Energy World looked more like stars.
<br><br>
Then, the members of the Wooden Leaf race all went back to their own caves.
<br><br>
Inside one large cave above, Pearson brought out the grey Ghost Powder and divided it among the group.
<br><br>
Although he had already distributed the Ghost Powder, they were not in a hurry to use it.
<br><br>
King Ieuan stood at the entrance of the cave, where a large eye floated beside it. It was the Heavenly Eye Vine's eye, which could separate from its body if necessary.
<br><br>
The spiritual sense could not detect what happened in the distance, but the eye could.
<br><br>
There was a vine from the eye on King Ieuan's forehead, and it could see the top of the mountain when it stood on one side of the cave.
<br><br>
An hour ago, Pearson had turned into a spider thread and quietly left the cave. He climbed to the top of the mountain, took out two Grass Bulls from his spirit beast bag, and put them there.
<br><br>
Even though the Grass Bulls were from the Other Shore, they were not intelligent and did not have any theurgy. However, their flesh was very delicious. Pearson caught them for his meals.
<br><br>
To prevent them from escaping, he rendered them unconscious first then fixed them on top of the mountain. Then, he evenly spread some Ghost Powder on one bull. When it became white, he quietly returned to the cave.
<br><br>
Now, King Ieuan saw two motionless Grass Bulls on top of the mountain with the help of the eye. One was black, and the other was white.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Once the light on the Night View Island was dim to a certain extent, it seemed that a door in one corner of the island had opened. An unpleasant aura rushed forth from the door and spread throughout the island.
<br><br>
King Ieuan's eyes lit up. "Squeak! It's the Treacherous Being's aura," it said.
<br><br>
Everyone in the cave sat in meditation, but the moment the aura descended, they all opened their eyes.
<br><br>
Fuxi somersaulted and walked towards the entrance of the cave.
<br><br>
"Did you see anything?" he asked. King Ieuan shook its head, "Not yet.
<br><br>
Squeak!"
<br><br>
Even if it did not see the Treacherous Being, the truth was it still felt scared.
<br><br>
A resentment-level Treacherous Being could not cover the entire island with its aura. It was most likely the hatred-level Treacherous Being that could release such an aura.
<br><br>
"When can I return to the spirit beast bag?" the Heavenly Eye Vine asked.
<br><br>
The horrifying aura made it a little uneasy.
<br><br>
It had thought that Zen and his group had successfully entered the Supreme Pure Realm, but it never occurred to it that they would reach the Jade Pure Realm directly. It naturally did not want to stay in such a terrible world.
<br><br>
"Not now."
<br><br>
Just as King Ieuan spoke, its bean-sized eyes suddenly widened to twice their size, as if it saw something shocking.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Eye Vine turned to look, and it was also stunned.
<br><br>
Fuxi arched his eyebrows. "What did you see?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Some white things fell from the sky. They look like hairs," King Ieuan answered. Indeed, white hairs that emitted a faint white light fell one by one.
<br><br>
When they piled up to a certain amount, they merged and formed a humanshaped white-haired monster.
<br><br>
It was clear that the white-haired monster found the Grass Bulls and crawled towards them.
<br><br>
However, it hesitated for a moment when it passed by the white bull.
<br><br>
Eventually, it gave up and quickly walked towards the black bull.
<br><br>
King Ieuan attentively watched the scene. The moment the white-haired monster touched the black bull, the bull's head disappeared. The whitehaired monster had eaten it.
<br><br>
Blood gushed out from the black bull's neck and splashed on the whitehaired monster's body. But as soon as the blood touched the white-haired monster, it disappeared without a trace at all. Naturally, the monster also drank it.
<br><br>
As the monster continued to move, it ate the entire black bull.
<br><br>
Splash! Soon enough, the monster dissipated with a loud bang and turned into thin white hairs that scattered on the ground.
<br><br>
Then, the white hairs slowly disappeared. King Ieuan saw a few transparent crystals which did not disappear with the white hairs.
<br><br>
"What are these crystals?" King Ieuan asked curiously.
<br><br>
White hairs also appeared about ten feet away from it.
<br><br>
Up close, they looked like pure winter snow—beautiful but fatal.
<br><br>
It was not until then that King Ieuan remembered its mission. It grabbed the spirit beast bag and gently put the eye back into the bag. Then, it quickly turned around and returned to the cave. "Everybody, hurry up! Apply the Ghost Powder!" "The black bull is dead?" Pearson asked.
<br><br>
"Creak! Yes! Hurry up!" King Ieuan confirmed and applied the Ghost Powder on its body.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen, the Snake Goddess, and the Eternal Realm Hunters applied a layer of Ghost Powder on their bodies.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't sure if Treacherous Beings devoured each other, but they had quite a lot of Ghost Powder. Thus, Campbell also applied the Ghost Powder to his body.
<br><br>
As soon as they finished, four human-shaped monsters arrived in the cave.
<br><br>
They kept looking around, as if they were looking for something.
<br><br>
Moreover, they exuded such an intimidating aura that everyone tried their best to resist the urge to escape.
<br><br>
After the white-haired monsters had searched for a while, one of them suddenly turned and looked at Zen, then strode towards him.
<br><br>
He only frowned and did not move, but every muscle in his body tightened.
<br><br>
Even though he did not know how to deal with the monster, he would never wait for death.
<br><br>
When the monster finally approached him, it stretched out its hand, brushed past his ear, and slapped the wall.
<br><br>
He carefully turned his head, only to see that the monster had targeted the plant that just sprouted on the wall.
<br><br>
No wonder the sloth sprinkled the Ghost Powder on the trees! The whitehaired monsters also ate plants.
<br><br>
Then, the white-haired monsters searched every corner of the cave and made sure that there was no "living creature" left for them to devour.
<br><br>
Afterward, they exploded into a pile of messy white hairs and gradually disappeared.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi let out a sigh of relief. "They finally left."
<br><br>
"Squeak! They won't come back again," said King Ieuan.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Snake Goddess frowned in thought. "They rely on the life energy to find their prey, right? After we apply the Ghost Powder, we are like dead people," she stated.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the Eternal Realm warriors present had sharp senses.
<br><br>
Today, however, they became too nervous because of the Treacherous Being. They had not realized that fact until the Snake Goddess reminded them.
<br><br>
The Ghost Powder almost entirely blocked the life energy. In other words, if someone applied the Ghost Powder on their bodies and lay motionless on the ground, they would look like corpses.
<br><br>
"I think so," Pearson said with a nod.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess thought for a while and said, "I'll try again. Please don't shake off the Ghost Powder on your bodies."
<br><br>
"Don't..." Before Pearson could stop her, she had already removed the Ghost Powder on the back of her hand, which revealed her white and delicate skin.
<br><br>
Just then, white hairs slowly began to pile up not far away from the cave.
<br><br>
Not long after, the white-haired monsters appeared again and rushed towards the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Yet, she remained calm. She wasn't even in a hurry to reapply the Ghost Powder. Instead, she raised her hand and retreated slowly, luring the whitehaired monsters to follow her.
<br><br>
'What a crazy woman!' Pearson thought helplessly.
<br><br>
Chapter 4046 The Glazed Crystals The Snake Goddess had figured it out! "These creatures can't see anything. They can only chase after the life energy..." As she spoke, she applied a layer of Ghost Powder on her hand.
<br><br>
The white-haired monster that had been chasing her immediately stopped in its tracks. Confused, it began to sniff and search around.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed as her mind raced. "The races on the island all know how to use the Ghost Powder, which means the whitehaired monsters should not be a threat to them. The Wooden Leaf race are willing to offer their prey to the white-haired monsters, so there must be some sort of exchange. What do they get out of this? How do they benefit?"
<br><br>
"It's hard to guess." Zen shook his head. "Maybe after offering their prey, they can go somewhere to receive the so-called 'benefits'."
<br><br>
There were too many possibilities, and it was difficult to deduce with extremely limited clues.
<br><br>
"Squeak! By the way, when I used the heavenly eye to observe the Grass Bulls, the white-haired monster swallowed a Grass Bull and left some transparent glazed crystals," King Ieuan suddenly reminded.
<br><br>
Just now, it was busy applying the Ghost Powder, so it failed to share this.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess immediately looked at Pearson and asked, "Pearson, do you have any more Grass Bull in your spirit beast bag?"
<br><br>
"Yes." Pearson nodded, understanding immediately. Without hesitation, he took out a Grass Bull from the spirit beast bag.
<br><br>
Having been summoned into the world, the Grass Bull felt the strange aura from the white-haired monster. It was immediately frightened and wanted to run away.
<br><br>
But before it could do so, Pearson pointed at its head. With a loud thud, the Grass Bull fell to the ground, in a deep coma.
<br><br>
The white-haired monster was about to leave, but when it felt the life energy of the Grass Bull, it immediately turned around and pounced on it.
<br><br>
In a few seconds, it had devoured almost all of the Grass Bull's flesh. When it was done eating, it disintegrated into a pile of white hairs and disappeared.
<br><br>
Ding, ding, ding...
<br><br>
As the pile of white hairs disappeared, several glazed crystals fell to the ground with crisp sounds.
<br><br>
These crystals were thin and long, like glass needles.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stepped forward and picked up the crystals one by one.
<br><br>
She placed them in her hands and looked at them carefully. These crystals gave her a feeling of discomfort, as if they were a part of the Treacherous Being, and their aura was similar.
<br><br>
"This should be what the Wooden Leaf race is after. If we are devoured, they will get a lot more crystals," the Snake Goddess said as she handed the crystals to Fuxi.
<br><br>
Fuxi held the crystals close to his face and he sniffed them carefully. After studying them in his hand for a bit, he shrugged helplessly. He couldn't shed any more light on the matter. He handed them over to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who then handed them over to Yasamin.
<br><br>
Each of them took turns to observe the crystals, and finally they landed with Zen. As Zen studied them carefully, Campbell beside him asked, "Can I have a look?"
<br><br>
Campbell had the body of the Treacherous Being, so his perception was completely different from theirs'.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and gave them to him. Then, Campbell clenched his fist, crystals in hand. Slowly, he closed his eyes and stood still.
<br><br>
Campbell's face suddenly began to melt, like wax off a candle. His human body quickly melted into a pool of white and translucent mud, and his armor was clattered all over the ground.
<br><br>
"Master Campbell!" Zen shouted in a hurry.
<br><br>
"What's wrong with him?"
<br><br>
"Why is this happening?"
<br><br>
"Are these glazed crystals used to deal with the Treacherous Beings?"
<br><br>
Anxiety was written all over the faces of the others.
<br><br>
Although Campbell was only a hostility-level Treacherous Being, he was still the builder of the world! His understanding of the entire chaos far surpassed that of the others. He was indispensable to the group.
<br><br>
If something went wrong because of a few unknown glazed crystals...
<br><br>
"Look, those glazed crystals!" King Ieuan said as it pointed at Campbell.
<br><br>
The previous few glazed crystals had drilled into Campbell's body and were completely wrapped up.
<br><br>
"Let's wait and see. Maybe the situation is not as bad as we think," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
After all, Campbell's Treacherous Being body only melted, but it hadn't eroded. The body of the Treacherous Being was deathless after all, and as long as it could recover, it would be fine.
<br><br>
About fifteen minutes later, the mud formed by Campbell began to shake. A head slowly emerged out of the transparent white mud, and his body slowly returned to the human form.
<br><br>
"Master Campbell, what happened to you just now?" Zen asked, his forehead creasing with worry.
<br><br>
Campbell opened his clenched fist, and the glazed crystals were still in his hand. Eyeing them fondly, he said, "These things seem to be my home. I feel comfortable and want to sleep in them..."
<br><br>
As a unique creature, the Treacherous Being was naturally completely different from a normal creature.
<br><br>
When Campbell held these crystals, he felt sleepy, as if these crystals were a bed beckoning for him.
<br><br>
As soon as he turned into the mud, he took a short nap.
<br><br>
After Campbell returned the crystals to Zen, Zen relayed to the others what Campbell had just told him.
<br><br>
"Sleep..." Eastern Emperor Taiyi frowned slightly.
<br><br>
Sleep was something that weak creatures needed.
<br><br>
A soul which had been tempered would never have the need to sleep.
<br><br>
There was no doubt that the Treacherous Being possessed a more powerful and special soul. However, just now, Campbell had taken a nap! This confused Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
"Maybe this kind of thing can hypnotize the Treacherous Being," Thurston guessed, gesturing at the crystals.
<br><br>
Staring at the glazed crystals in Zen's hand, the Snake Goddess frowned deeply. "Master Campbell has woken up, but he is still unable to resist the crystals. What would happen to the Treacherous Beings which haven't woken up, if they are exposed to such crystals?"
<br><br>
No matter they belonged to the attaching type or the killing type, these Treacherous Beings all relied on their wills to act, without too much judgment.
<br><br>
Wouldn't these Treacherous Beings fall into a coma if they came into contact with these crystals? "Maybe they can be used to trap the Treacherous Beings," Pearson said.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded slightly, but her eyebrows still furrowed. She felt that these glazed crystals were more useful than they were letting on.
<br><br>
"We don't have to think too much. The mystery will solve itself at dawn,"
<br><br>
Sawyer suddenly said.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess heard this, her mouth twitched upwards into a smile. "You're right!"
<br><br>
They weren't ruthless and merciless, but the members of the Wooden Leaf race couldn't blame them for anything they did, as they even dared to trap them and sacrifice their lives.
<br><br>
The night of the Night View Island lasted for twenty hours.
<br><br>
After they applied the Ghost Powder, no other white-haired monsters broke into the cave that night.
<br><br>
King Ieuan once again took out the heavenly eye from the spirit beast bag and observed the situation outside.
<br><br>
Occasionally, it heard the screams of some creatures. When it looked into the direction where the sound rang out, it could see the white-haired monsters devouring some unfortunate sacrifices.
<br><br>
Twenty hours later, dawn broke, and the sky gradually lightened.
<br><br>
As the sun rose, so did everyone's downtrodden spirits.
<br><br>
In a small cave at the bottom of the mountain, Decker came out and shook off the Ghost Powder on his body.
<br><br>
The other members of the Wooden Leaf race also came out of their small 'houses', including their leader, Graham.
<br><br>
Decker and Graham locked eyes, excitement written all over their faces.
<br><br>
Chapter 4047 The Arcanum The Night View Island was rather peculiarly named. Whoever didn't apply the Ghost Powder on this island would die at night.
<br><br>
As those strangers knew nothing, they would have been eaten by the whitehaired monsters last night.
<br><br>
"I'm wondering how many Arcana were left," Graham thought out loud with eyes shining with greed.
<br><br>
Over the past few years, because of the appearance of the Evil Tiger race, the west path of the Wooden Leaf race had been cut off. As a result, hunting had become more and more difficult as time had passed. These strangers could not have come at a more fortunate time.
<br><br>
Graham hadn't slept a wink last night and had been hiding in his cave in fear. But now, it was time to harvest.
<br><br>
"They are humans," Decker said with a strong desire in his eyes. "And what's more, they are quite strong when you think about it. I think the white-haired monsters must have left a lot of Arcana!"
<br><br>
The two of them called the other soldiers of the Wooden Leaf race and then climbed up the stairs at the side of the mountain.
<br><br>
Although both Decker and Graham sincerely believed that Zen and his companions had been devoured completely, they still had to be prepared for any unexpected situations that might arise.
<br><br>
The Wooden Leaf race was very good with bows and arrows. The soldiers held simply wooden bows in their hands, but the arrows were cyan black and poisonous. These arrows were known to be incredibly toxic. That was the sole reason the seemingly weak members of the Wooden Leaf race had survived so long.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, they had climbed the mountainside and arrived at the cave.
<br><br>
Decker signaled to the crowd. They held their breath and approached quietly.
<br><br>
The soldiers were walking gingerly and slowly approached the side of the cave. Decker was the first to poke his head into the cave, and he was extremely careful in doing so. But there was nothing and no one in it.
<br><br>
Chances were, those humans had been eaten up by the white-haired monsters. Decker had already expected this outcome. He felt more relieved and then looked to the ground.
<br><br>
If those humans had been completely annihilated, then there would be a lot of things left behind there.
<br><br>
Decker's eyes swept over the ground, and his pupils suddenly shrank. He was staring at the center of the cave, where only four glazed crystals were sitting sadly.
<br><br>
"So few?" Decker narrowed his eyes.
<br><br>
"Not even half a dozen crystals?" Graham frowned.
<br><br>
Decker walked in and picked up the glazed crystals on the ground.
<br><br>
Normally, after the white-haired monsters had devoured their prey, Decker and his companions could obtain at least ten glazed crystals. If those humans really had been eaten up by the white-haired monsters, then there should be at least a hundred glazed crystals lying on the ground.
<br><br>
But there were only four here! Only two possibilities could explain this.
<br><br>
The first one was that the humans were still alive, or it could be that the glazed crystals had been stolen.
<br><br>
A bad feeling rose from the bottom of Decker's and Graham's hearts.
<br><br>
They were sincerely hoping that the second option was the right one.
<br><br>
If those humans were still alive, then Decker and company were in deep trouble.
<br><br>
As the two of them pondered over the mystery, they suddenly felt the leaves above their heads become extremely heavy. The leaves were quickly turning red.
<br><br>
The members of the Wooden Leaf race had a talent quite similar to what the Augury Dog had, in the sense that they could predict danger in advance.
<br><br>
And perhaps it was because they were good at archery, their talent was also more practical than that of the Augury Dog. They could sense the presence of their enemies from a distance. This complemented their archery skills since arrows could kill from a distance.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, their enemies were rather close this time.
<br><br>
Zen and his group were hiding in the cave, but they were covered with a layer of skin from Sawyer's treasure, known as the Magic Camouflage Skin.
<br><br>
It could change into any form and color.
<br><br>
The moment Sawyer removed the Magic Camouflage Skin, Zen reached out his hand and grabbed the bow in Decker's hand.
<br><br>
Decker's reaction was also incredibly fast. He raised his hand and was about to shoot an arrow at Zen.
<br><br>
The other warriors of the Wooden Leaf race also followed suit. Bows and arrows were their weapons of choice, and operating them was in their instinct. Therefore, their reaction speed and accuracy were both very high.
<br><br>
However, this time, something unfortunate happened. Before Decker or anyone else had a chance to let an arrow fly, a thin strand of spider thread was wrapped around their arrows.
<br><br>
And when they were about to shoot, the spider thread pulled the arrows away in one direction. The soldiers of the Wooden Leaf race could do nothing but stare at their bows in confusion.
<br><br>
Crack! Just two of Zen's fingers pinched Decker's bow and crushed it with a gentle force.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The bows of the other members of the Wooden Leaf race shared a similar fate.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the Eternal Realm Hunters also made their moves and crushed the long bows of whoever was nearest.
<br><br>
The Wooden Leaf race was quickly detained.
<br><br>
"You, you... What do you want?" Decker's face turned pale.
<br><br>
"Friends from afar, why are you doing this to us? Have we been ungracious hosts to you?" Graham asked in a calm tone.
<br><br>
As the patriarch of the Wooden Leaf race, he was much calmer than Decker in times of crisis.
<br><br>
However, his calm was immediately lost when he heard the unmistakable crack of bones breaking into two! Crack! The warrior behind Graham had tried to pull out his short sword and attack Pearson in secret, but his neck was immediately broken. His large head rolled to a side, and the sound of spurting blood could be heard coming from the cave.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! Silver threads wrapped themselves around the necks of Decker and all his friends. And these were not as fragile as ordinary spider threads.
<br><br>
Instead, they felt as sharp as sword blades.
<br><br>
Pearson's cold eyes were full of killing intent now. "Stop talking nonsense.
<br><br>
And don't try any unnecessary flattery, or you will die immediately."
<br><br>
"How dare you..."
<br><br>
Crack! Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! Another soldier of the Wooden Leaf race was about to threaten Pearson, but the latter immediately moved his finger and the sharp thread cut off the soldier's neck before he could complete his sentence.
<br><br>
As his detached head fell to the ground, so did a cold silence in the cave.
<br><br>
Not a single soldier of the Wooden Leaf race dared to say anything now.
<br><br>
Pearson was gazing at them fiercely, but they did not even dare to look into his eyes.
<br><br>
The man's intention had been to catch Decker and torture him cruelly yesterday.
<br><br>
Although the method that Zen and the others proposed could also achieve his goal and was more secure, it was too troublesome in his eyes.
<br><br>
Graham and Decker had initially planned on struggling, but now, they completely gave up.
<br><br>
Without further ado, Zen took out a glazed crystal and placed it in front of Decker. "What is this?" he asked.
<br><br>
Decker rolled his eyes, but Pearson threatened, "Answer him now, or you will die."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the silver threads wrapped around Decker's and Graham's necks magically tightened themselves. The sharp threads cut into their flesh, and blood quickly seeped out.
<br><br>
"It's an Arcanum!"
<br><br>
"It's an Arcanum!"
<br><br>
Decker and Graham cried out simultaneously.
<br><br>
"Very good." Pearson waved at Zen and said, "Go on."
<br><br>
Zen and the others were a little confused when they heard this strange name. Zen continued the interrogation, "What's the use of this Arcanum?"
<br><br>
"It gets its name from the fact that the Treacherous Beings like it very much. If we accumulate enough of this, we can easily subdue them by distracting them," Decker explained.
<br><br>
"Is that all?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Decker hesitated, but trembled when his eyes met Pearson's. He quickly replied, "No. If you refine it, you can coexist peacefully with several Treacherous Beings without having to worry about subduing them. You can also turn them into your own weapons and even a part of your body. Then you would be half human and half Treacherous Being."
<br><br>
Chapter 4048 The Thorny Treacherous Being "Half Treacherous Being?"
<br><br>
Everyone wore strange expressions of mingled shock, calculation, and curiosity.
<br><br>
The literal meaning of the sentence was not difficult to understand.
<br><br>
But the question was, which side would dominate? Would the body be ruled by the mind of the human, or the mind of the Treacherous Being? When Campbell had possessed Zen's body, Zen had been unable to resist his will at all. Campbell completely dominated the human body. Thus, everyone was inclined to think that becoming half human and half Treacherous Being was the equivalent of suicide.
<br><br>
"If one merges with a Treacherous Being, aren't they afraid that the Treacherous Being will suppress their consciousness and rule over them?"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess asked, voicing everyone's main concern.
<br><br>
"Yes, that's possible," Decker admitted. He explained, "When some Treacherous Beings of the friendly type wake up, some will snatch their hosts' bodies, and others won't. However, the Treacherous Beings' power is very strong. It's worth taking a risk."
<br><br>
Decker's words made some sense.
<br><br>
Indeed, there were creatures who wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice their very lives in order to obtain greater strength and power.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded. She asked, "You mention a 'friendly type' of Treacherous Beings. Could you explain what you mean by that?"
<br><br>
"They are kindhearted Treacherous Beings, harmless to others," Decker replied. "These good Treacherous Beings are willing to help others, and this is their will. For example, the Treacherous Beings in the form of sloths in the forest are among the friendly-type ones."
<br><br>
The sloths were tireless in applying the Ghost Powder on the surface of the trees, to prevent the trees from being devoured by the white-haired monsters.
<br><br>
Moreover, after they saw Zen and the others in his group, they had also brought out the Ghost Powder to remind them to apply it.
<br><br>
But Zen and his companions were still wary of the sloths, and found it difficult to trust them completely.
<br><br>
Pearson's eyes were blank. His face was expressionless as he lifted one hand, gently holding up the length of silver thread. The other end of the thread was tightly wrapped around the necks of Decker and Graham.
<br><br>
Pearson wanted to kill one of them, so that the remaining one wouldn't dare to lie to them.
<br><br>
Decker was smart enough to see what Pearson intended, so he didn't dare to hide anything from them. He told them everything he knew, but Pearson clearly still had doubts. "The white-haired monsters will also devour those plants. You can directly cut the trees and pick the flowers in exchange for the 'Arcana'," Pearson said flatly. A cold light flashed in his emotionless eyes. "Why did you deceive us into coming here?"
<br><br>
"The white-haired monsters will indeed devour plants, but devouring plants won't produce 'Arcanum'," answered Decker quickly.
<br><br>
Pearson shrugged. Fuxi stepped forward and asked, "Have any of you merged with a Treacherous Being and become half human and half Treacherous Being?"
<br><br>
Since entering the Supreme Pure Realm, Fuxi had felt that his strength was completely insufficient.
<br><br>
Although he had the Light of Annihilation, it was not enough. In fact, for most of his time in these two realms, he'd ended up running for his life.
<br><br>
Naturally, the idea of becoming half human and half Treacherous Being intrigued him, as it presented the possibility of obtaining more power.
<br><br>
"The warriors of our Wooden Leaf race all are half human and half Treacherous Being," answered Decker.
<br><br>
"Really?" Fuxi said, sounding surprised. His eyes widened, for he had expected a more conservative answer.
<br><br>
Zen and the others also looked surprised.
<br><br>
They had assumed that, at most, one or two members of the Wooden Leaf race had successfully merged with a Treacherous Being and become half human and half Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
But now Decker was telling them that all the warriors of the Wooden Leaf race were half human and half Treacherous Being, which was an incredible number.
<br><br>
Pearson's eyes narrowed and he tightened his grip on the silver spider thread with increased vigilance. The thread tightened on Graham's and Decker's necks, and the blood which had already begun to dry now flowed out once more.
<br><br>
"Don't—don't be nervous," Decker gasped, feeling blood dripping down his neck from the tight grip of the thread.
<br><br>
Graham swiftly added, "There are variations in the levels of strength possessed by Treacherous Beings. Our Wooden Leaf race is relatively weak, so the Treacherous Beings we merged with are not that strong."
<br><br>
Pearson's grip loosened slightly. "You're right," he said. "Otherwise, you wouldn't have fallen into this situation."
<br><br>
"Then prove your words," Zen ordered. He was not worried that this command would cause any problems for him and his group.
<br><br>
After all, Zen had already managed to kill the three stone men who were also half human and half Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
The skills of the Wooden Leaf race were centered on archery, not direct combat. They were not much stronger than the stone men, since the space here was limited, and they could not bring their strength into full play.
<br><br>
Under Zen's instruction, Pearson loosened the silver spider thread even further. The leader of the race, Graham, felt much better. He lifted his hand to touch the thread still wrapped around his neck.
<br><br>
With the silver thread tied around him, Graham walked several steps, towards the center of the cave. He took out a small glass bottle from within the folds of his clothing. This glass bottle was made of "Arcana", and it contained a small thorny ball, which was a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"Can I use arrows?" asked Graham.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. He gazed at the thorny ball within the glass bottle and said, "But doesn't the Arcanum need to be refined within one's body?"
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Beings that haven't woken up are not suitable to stay inside one's body for a long time," Graham explained. "Otherwise they will affect the warrior's body and mind."
<br><br>
Most Treacherous Beings released an aura that would make other creatures very uncomfortable. Even the sloths, which were supposedly the friendly type of Treacherous Beings, had such an aura. Only the Treacherous Beings that had woken up would not make people feel disgusted.
<br><br>
Graham lightly knocked on the glass bottle, and the shrunken thing in the bottle began to expand and flow out. The Treacherous Being resembled a sea urchin in shape.
<br><br>
Everyone watched silently, and the only sound came from the movement of the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
The fluid-looking sea urchin stretched and flowed into Graham's eyes, ears, mouth and nose. It seeped like liquid into the orifices, until it was all gone.
<br><br>
Then Graham blinked and took out a bow and arrow. His old bow had been crushed so this was a different weapon.
<br><br>
Although this was only intended to be a demonstration, everyone stared at Graham with alertness.
<br><br>
After all, he was going to display the power of the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
He raised the bow and fitted the long arrow into the string. A white light gathered in his right hand as the aura of the Treacherous Being concentrated in that spot. Graham aimed his arrow at the wall of the cave and said, "The Treacherous Being I merged with is very suitable for archery. When I shoot it out, it will cause a strong destructive force."
<br><br>
With that, he released the bowstring in his hand.
<br><br>
The arrow shot forward.
<br><br>
As the arrow flew, the white light soared forward, converging into the point of the arrowhead.
<br><br>
With a crack, the arrow hit the wall of the cave.
<br><br>
It created a small hole as it entered the wall and burrowed inside the stone.
<br><br>
Zen and the others watched calmly.
<br><br>
It was true that the mountain walls in the Jade Pure Realm should be very difficult to destroy, but they themselves could achieve the same thing with a bow and arrow. It required the use of focused strength, and they thought that given a similar weapon, they could probably do more damage than Graham had done.
<br><br>
However, in the next instant, a crack spread out from the tiny hole, and began to spread out along the surface of the cave wall.
<br><br>
Everyone became more vigilant as the walls began to rumble.
<br><br>
It sounded as though something was moving within the depths of the mountain.
<br><br>
Graham was very familiar with the power of the thorny Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
He took a few steps back as the wall in front of him started to collapse. As the wall crashed, a large hole was revealed, and within it was the Treacherous Being in the shape of sea urchin.
<br><br>
It had grown much larger. Its body had expanded at least a hundred times in size. Colorful thorns were embedded in the rock wall around the enormous sea urchin.
<br><br>
This level of damage had been caused by shooting the Treacherous Being into the wall. If it had been shot into the body of a living being, they could only imagine the power of the resulting explosion.
<br><br>
Zen looked sharply at Graham. "All the Treacherous Beings you merged with are of this same type?" he asked.
<br><br>
Graham nodded. "This kind of Treacherous Beings is our first choice. After we get enough 'Arcana', we each find such a Treacherous Being to merge with."
<br><br>
When Pearson heard Graham's answer, his mouth twitched slightly. The fighting capacity of the Wooden Leaf race was not as bad as he had imagined.
<br><br>
If they had fought with the Wooden Leaf race yesterday, they might win, but there might be some casualties. It seemed that Zen and the Snake Goddess's plan was the best plan.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and several others were more interested in merging with Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
After cultivating to the Eternal Realm, one's bloodline power couldn't change any more, and it became more difficult to find a stronger Other Shore Token. It looked like merging with Treacherous Beings was a shortcut to increase the level of one's strength.
<br><br>
Chapter 4049 A Trace Of Humans Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others raised several more questions.
<br><br>
Once these questions were answered, they had a basic understanding of what the Night View Island was all about.
<br><br>
A large number of different races — close to a thousand — lived in the annular mountain range around the Night View Island.
<br><br>
It was weird but astonishing that so many races coexisted on such a small island.
<br><br>
One or two races were present on almost every mountain here. These races were mainly divided into three tiers and the Wooden Leaf race was among the weakest ones.
<br><br>
The Wooden Leaf race knew their limitations and rarely came into conflict with other races. That was how they had survived in such a complicated environment.
<br><br>
"Did you capture your Treacherous Beings in the mountains?" Fuxi asked.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and the others were concerned at Fuxi's question, given that it was an important one. Why were there so many Treacherous Beings on the Night View Island? They had encountered a lot of sloth-shaped Treacherous Beings on their way to this mountain, which, according to Decker, was just the tip of the iceberg. The abundance of Treacherous Beings on the Night View Island was way beyond their imagination.
<br><br>
Decker shook his head and said, "Most Treacherous Beings in the mountains are weak and the powerful ones are mainly the killing type. The killing type also likes Arcana and will kill you to plunder your Arcana.
<br><br>
They're not suitable for warriors to merge with. Our Treacherous Beings came from the Ghost Mountain."
<br><br>
"Ghost Mountain?" Fuxi raised an eyebrow in interest.
<br><br>
"There is a huge Ghost Mountain beyond the annular mountain range on the westernmost side of the Night View Island. There are a large number of friendly-type Treacherous Beings there. You'll see every kind you can think of," explained Decker.
<br><br>
Confused and curious, Fuxi asked, "Are you saying that you can freely enter the Ghost Mountain and choose a Treacherous Being?"
<br><br>
Decker shook his head again and answered, "We can't enter the Ghost Mountain at will. We need to accumulate enough Arcana to enter it."
<br><br>
"Why didn't we see such a mountain when we came out of the lake?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Decker said, understanding dawning in his eyes, "You can only see it after you cross the annular mountain range. You can't see it from the center of the island."
<br><br>
Zen was still doubtful. He turned around and asked, "Master Campbell, is the annular mountain range the only highland on the Night View Island?"
<br><br>
They had seen the island's terrain once they had emerged from the lake.
<br><br>
There was nothing but the lake at its center and a circle of mountains around it. They would have noticed it if there was a huge Ghost Mountain around there! "As far as I know, the annular mountain range shapes the edges of the Night View Island. There is nothing but a void beyond the annular mountain range," said Campbell with conviction.
<br><br>
At this, Zen's eyes turned cold. "You were lying to us," he said, turning to glare at Decker.
<br><br>
Pearson hooked his fingers and the silver thread tightened around Decker's neck, cutting into his skin. Blood quickly began to drip from the wound.
<br><br>
"No, please no! It hurts!" Decker screamed hysterically at the sharp pain. "I told no lies! All that I said is true! You can ask our patriarch if you don't believe me!"
<br><br>
Graham spoke up hastily. "Yes, yes!" he said. "The Ghost Mountain has been floating outside the island. You can only see it once you climb over the circle of mountains. You can send someone to have a look at it and verify what we're saying!"
<br><br>
At Decker's and Graham's earnest looks, Pearson relaxed the silver thread on his fingertips. "They don't look like they're lying," he said.
<br><br>
"Is there really a Ghost Mountain?" the Snake Goddess said thoughtfully.
<br><br>
According to Campbell, the world beyond the Pure Sky Platforms was full of Void Dust, which could devour all substances and energies.
<br><br>
Campbell had also mentioned that he knew a way of roaming through the Void Dust. This involved using the Spiritual Boat. He didn't say what material the Spiritual Boat was made of. So she surmised that the Ghost Mountain was probably formed by the same substances as the Spiritual Boat, which was probably why it could also roam through the Void Dust.
<br><br>
"Let's put this question aside for the time being," Zen said, quickly regaining his composure. "When I mentioned the human race yesterday, you said that you hadn't seen any before. Let me ask you once again. Have you ever seen any other humans before us?"
<br><br>
This was what they were most concerned about. After all, they were here to find the human heroes.
<br><br>
Decker hesitated.
<br><br>
"Answer him!" Pearson barked.
<br><br>
Decker then admitted hesitantly, "I met a human once before. A tall and sturdy human male. He sat on a fire lotus, flames in his eyes. Beside him was a Treacherous Being that looked like a fiery-dragon and appeared to be very powerful. This man burned up more than ten mountains and annihilated the Thunder race and the White Bone race, which were at the pinnacle of their forces at the time."
<br><br>
"We didn't know how the Thunder race and the White Bone race had provoked him. His fire was so tremendous that two mountains melted into lava and flowed into the lake," added Graham. He had also witnessed this terrifying scene. The fire hadn't extinguished for several days after that.
<br><br>
The Thunder race and the White Bone race used to be two ruling races on the Night View Island. They were far more powerful than small races like the Wooden Leaf race, but that human had destroyed them so easily! A human male...
<br><br>
Using formidable flames...
<br><br>
Tall and sturdy...
<br><br>
Sitting on a fire lotus...
<br><br>
These descriptions reminded everyone of the same person. The Snake Goddess and the others turned to look at Zen, knowing that that man's energy soul existed in Zen's body.
<br><br>
Zen communicated with his inner world for a while before a vague figure appeared above his head. Zen pointed at the figure and asked, "Is he the man you were talking about?"
<br><br>
Zhurong's figure gradually became clear. It was only half his body and the aura of the energy soul was not so strong as his real self, but Decker's and Graham's faces went sheet-white at the sight of him.
<br><br>
"W-what?!"
<br><br>
"Yes! That's him! Why is he inside your body?"
<br><br>
Decker and Graham looked as if they had seen a ghost.
<br><br>
Zhurong looked proud as he watched these members of the Wooden Leaf race stumble over their words in horror and awe. It looked like his real self still enjoyed great fame on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Decker would not have dared attack these strangers if he had known of this before.
<br><br>
"Where is this man on the Night View Island now?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Decker shook his head again. "I don't know. But I guess he's somewhere in the Ghost Mountain. All truly powerful figures on the Night View Island are over there and this master is no exception."
<br><br>
"In that case, it's time for us to go," Eastern Emperor Taiyi suggested.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes swept the outside of the cave. She flicked two of her fingers and two tiny shadows appeared at her fingertips. These were energy parasites transformed from the shadow of Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
She stuffed them into Decker's and Graham's mouths and warned them, "Tell your people to behave themselves."
<br><br>
The energy parasites would keep moving in their bodies. It would take at least three months for the energy to be depleted. During this time, the Snake Goddess could cause them to explode with just a thought if she thought Decker and Graham were out of line.
<br><br>
The other members of the Wooden Leaf race had long since laid siege outside the cave. They had bows and arrows in their hands, strong auras of Treacherous Beings emanating from their arrows, and ready to launch their attacks.
<br><br>
"Everyone! Please put down your weapons!" Decker shouted.
<br><br>
But nobody heeded him. Decker's prestige was not enough to order them around.
<br><br>
Graham took a deep sigh and said, "Put down your weapons. They are not someone you can match. Don't bring disaster upon our race."
<br><br>
The leader of the Wooden Leaf race had realized that their whole race would not be a match for this group of humans. Decker should never have provoked them.
<br><br>
Chapter 4050 Plunder Under the command of their leader, the members of the Wooden Leaf race retreated to both sides. Then, Zen and his group left and walked along the mountain road.
<br><br>
Relief washed over Graham and Decker as they watched them depart.
<br><br>
The fight between different races in Night View Island had been cruel. If Zen and his group were another race that fought against them, their Wooden Leaf race would probably face extinction.
<br><br>
However, Zen and his group had only planted parasites in their bodies and even spared them.
<br><br>
"These humans are quite merciful," Graham sighed.
<br><br>
"They did let us go, but the Evil Tiger race is still watching us..." Decker muttered and shook his head.
<br><br>
The Evil Tiger race expanded rapidly after they moved to the west of the mountain. Moreover, they also acquired the "Arcana" much faster than the Wooden Leaf race did, so they got to merge with stronger Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
With the current speed of their growth, it would not take long before the Evil Tiger race did something. The Wooden Leaf race surely could not fight against them, and it was easy to predict the outcome.
<br><br>
Of course, Decker refused to accept such fate. That was also why he took the risk to lure the humans to this place.
<br><br>
"It's all fate," Graham sighed again. "Once, only five people remained in our Wooden Leaf race. Our race got slaughtered, but we managed to pull through anyway. If we can't escape from this disaster, it means that our race is destined to end here," he said.
<br><br>
"I don't believe in fate," Decker said in a firm tone.
<br><br>
Then, he took a step forward.
<br><br>
"What are you going to do?" Graham asked nervously.
<br><br>
Yet, Decker turned a deaf ear to him and quickly caught up with Zen and his group. At the same time, he shouted, "Masters, please wait for a moment!"
<br><br>
Zen, the Snake Goddess, and the others turned around and looked at Decker strangely.
<br><br>
Decker continued, "Masters, it's not easy to go to the Ghost Mountain. I'm afraid you cannot enter the Ghost Mountain even if you reach it, especially if you have many people. You need to obtain a good amount of Arcana!"
<br><br>
At that moment, his eyes flashed with excitement and he declared, "I can help you!"
<br><br>
"We can find sacrifices by ourselves," the Snake Goddess said indifferently.
<br><br>
Decker laughed and said, "Of course you can. But every creature from different races in Night View Island hunts for the prey to get more sacrifices. How many prey do you think are left on the island?"
<br><br>
"Then we'll catch the creatures from the many races," Pearson said coldly.
<br><br>
"There are creatures from different races that are sacrificed like prey every day. Although you are powerful, those creatures that have merged with the Treacherous Beings are something else entirely. I'm afraid it won't be easy to defeat them," Decker explained.
<br><br>
Pearson frowned and didn't say anything. He thought what Decker said made sense.
<br><br>
Zen asked, "What's your suggestion?"
<br><br>
"I know about every race on Night View Island. I can help you plan to seize their Arcana," Decker answered.
<br><br>
Honestly, it was a good idea.
<br><br>
Besides, it would take a long time if they collected the 'Arcana' bit by bit.
<br><br>
Everything would be faster if they directly looted the Arcana from the others.
<br><br>
"Why should we trust you?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked.
<br><br>
In turn, Decker pointed at his body and said, "Don't forget that she has planted a parasite in me."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess glanced at him and said, "Okay, we can trust you."
<br><br>
Finally, he joined Zen's group.
<br><br>
The Wooden Leaf race's gathering place was at the south of the mountain.
<br><br>
The west side was originally an open space, but the Evil Tiger race occupied it later on.
<br><br>
"During this period of time, the Evil Tiger race have accumulated quite a lot of 'Arcana'. They are like fat sheep," Decker commented.
<br><br>
He was responsible for guiding these humans to steal the "Arcana." As the biggest threat to the Wooden Leaf race, the Evil Tiger race naturally became their first target.
<br><br>
"Who keeps the Arcana in their race?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"The leader of the race usually keeps the Arcana. That cave is where their leader lives," Decker answered without hesitation.
<br><br>
As he spoke, he pointed at a triangular cave in the center.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi brought out the Heavenly Eye Vine from the spirit beast bag, which extended a thin vine towards Decker's forehead.
<br><br>
When the vine touched his skin, he saw the scene in the triangular cave through the heavenly eye.
<br><br>
"Their leader did not go out to hunt today. He's just in the cave," Decker's eyes lit up as he talked.
<br><br>
"So do we charge in straight?" asked Fuxi. "No." Decker shook his head.
<br><br>
"The Treacherous Beings that the Evil Tiger race like to merge with are called the Wind Ghosts. They are immensely swift, and the warriors of the Evil Tiger race are also quite agile themselves. If we alerted them, we would surely fail to catch their leader, and instead, they would surround us,"
<br><br>
he explained.
<br><br>
Afterward, Sawyer quietly took out a few pieces of Magic Camouflage Skin and said, "So, we will use our old way."
<br><br>
The Magic Camouflage Skin hid their bodies so they could get close to their target without notice.
<br><br>
Zen covered himself in the Magic Camouflage Skin and quickly descended from the top of the mountain.
<br><br>
The leader of the Evil Tiger race had very sharp senses, especially his sense of smell. His nose could detect any change in the aura around him.
<br><br>
When Zen and the others slid to the cave's entrance, he immediately sensed that something was wrong.
<br><br>
Just as he was sniffing the air, however, a loop of silver spider thread wrapped around his neck.
<br><br>
He choked repeatedly and wanted to escape, but a young human suddenly appeared above his head. The young man stretched out his hand and pressed him down to the ground with a strong force, so he could not move.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
On the other side, a handsome, middle-aged man thrust his sword and stabbed his shoulder. Blood flowed out from the wound.
<br><br>
After that, a beautiful woman swept down and flicked her finger, where a wriggling crimson worm emerged.
<br><br>
She gently patted his shoulder then the energy parasite entered his body.
<br><br>
Their cooperation was flawless. The leader of the Evil Tiger race did not have the chance to use his own bloodline power, nor did he have the time to use the Treacherous Being he had merged with.
<br><br>
But even if he had reacted quickly, Zen and the others still had a way to deal with him. They had even prepared much stronger methods to counter his attacks.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" the leader of the Evil Tiger race shouted.
<br><br>
"Hand over the Arcana and we will spare your life," Zen demanded.
<br><br>
"No way!" the leader of the Evil Tiger race yelled with rage-filled eyes.
<br><br>
The Arcana were the foundation of peace for the lives of the creatures from the various races like them, and also the only way for them to become stronger. Therefore, how could he be willing to hand them over? Furthermore, they had intruded the base of the Evil Tiger race. He felt that these people would not really dare to make a move.
<br><br>
"Then go to hell..."
<br><br>
A faint killing intent flashed in Zen's eyes as if he was looking at a dead and cold corpse.
<br><br>
When the leader of the Evil Tiger race realized that he would die, his expression suddenly changed. "The Arcana you want are here, here… I'll give them all to you!" he said hurriedly.
<br><br>
Right after he spoke, a wooden box appeared in his hand. He opened it and revealed more than two hundred glazed crystals. It was a lot of Arcana! In return, Zen casually counted them, put them away for safekeeping, turned around, and left.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stretched out her hand and guided the worm to swim around his chest. A small bulge moved visibly through his skin.
<br><br>
"This worm won't disappear for three months. I hope you won't do anything within that time."
<br><br>
At the same time, she patted the leader's shoulder. Together with Pearson, and the others, they covered themselves with the Magic Camouflage Skin and quickly disappeared before the eyes of the leader of the Evil Tiger race.
<br><br>
The group of people came and went like ghosts, then left the leader who stood numbly in the cave, still in a daze.
<br><br>
Chapter 4051 Gained Little They snuck in and left the cave in under three minutes.
<br><br>
The members of the Evil Tiger race were not alerted during the entire process.
<br><br>
Decker had seen these people's theurgies but the methods they used still shocked him.
<br><br>
How were they able to take the Evil Tiger race's Arcana so easily? It was all just a piece of cake for them! The series of events was inconceivable to Decker but the others simply went on as if everything was entirely normal.
<br><br>
As an independent island, the Night View Island had no means to communicate with the outside world, so it didn't have as many Other Shore Tokens. The combat strength was mainly increased through fusions with Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
However, even if these Treacherous Beings were powerful, they weren't as good as Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Moreover, Zen and his companions still had the Holy Stones and the Light of Annihilation, which made it easy for them to deal with the hostility-level Treacherous Beings that might come their way. Of course, that was their trump card, so they wouldn't use it unless it was truly necessary.
<br><br>
After they left the Evil Tiger race's territory, Zen and his group made their way towards another connected mountain.
<br><br>
Decker was in a good mood. He had proved his value to Zen and robbed the Evil Tiger race in accordance with the Wooden Leaf race's wishes.
<br><br>
"The members of the Desert race are living at the foot of the mountain.
<br><br>
They're our allies," he told them.
<br><br>
"Is robbing an ally frowned upon here?" Pearson asked. Decker hurriedly waved his hand.
<br><br>
"I'm very familiar with the Desert race so it would be easier for us to take their Arcana, but they went to the Ghost Mountain not long ago and have consumed all their Arcana. It wouldn't make much sense to go there since you won't really get any."
<br><br>
The races on the Night View Island were usually shrewd realists.
<br><br>
Both the Wooden Leaf race and the Desert race acknowledged their weakness so they decided to forge an alliance with each other. Once one of them became a strong force, they would immediately turn friends into enemies.
<br><br>
"Next," Zen said dismissively.
<br><br>
It was entirely possible for Decker to have been lying. There was a high chance that he was taking advantage of Zen and his group in order to suppress the Wooden Leaf race's opponents.
<br><br>
Whether this possibility was true or not, Zen and his group did not really care.
<br><br>
Soon enough, they arrived at the third mountain.
<br><br>
Snake-shaped creatures gathered around and flitted here and there.
<br><br>
These snake-shaped creatures could communicate through telepathy. If one of their members were attacked, the rest would know straight away.
<br><br>
"I believe in your strength but fighting with these guys may end badly. I hope you reconsider," Decker told them.
<br><br>
Fuxi shrugged in nonchalance. "Next."
<br><br>
They were in a hurry to accumulate Arcana and couldn't waste any time dawdling.
<br><br>
On the fourth mountain, they came upon the sheep-headed men.
<br><br>
According to Decker, this race was very suitable since they had moderate strength and no doubt had acquired quite a lot of Arcana.
<br><br>
Zen and his group quietly observed the comings and goings of the race for about three minutes before they were able to find the opportunity to sneak in.
<br><br>
It was generally the same process. After they gained control of the huge sheep-headed man, they plundered all the Arcana and left quietly.
<br><br>
After that, everyone expected things to sail smoothly but that wasn't the case.
<br><br>
The races they chose afterward were all bust. Either the races had used up all of their Arcana or they had a special way to hide them. Some leaders were also incredibly resolute and would rather die than hand them over.
<br><br>
In the end, Zen and his group managed to gather fewer Arcana than they would've liked.
<br><br>
One thing that they realized during this series of plunders though was that it was a wise decision to have kept Decker by their side.
<br><br>
His input proved to be extremely useful, especially when they had to deal with troublesome races.
<br><br>
When night came, the group dug out a stone cave on top of a mountain and settled there.
<br><br>
They had collected a total of three hundred and forty-two Arcana, including the Arcana that had been traded with the Grass Bull yesterday.
<br><br>
Zen pursed his lips as he calculated their spoils. "How many people can enter the Ghost Mountain with these Arcana?" he asked.
<br><br>
"A person needs two hundred Arcana to enter," Decker answered. "So it means one and a half people can enter now. You have good luck and great strength, and your efficiency is really high."
<br><br>
In his eyes, their rate of accumulation was already incredible.
<br><br>
The others, however, thought differently. To them, their efficiency was actually extremely slow and they had to pick up the pace tomorrow and earn more.
<br><br>
Once darkness completely shrouded the Night View Island, the group settled and began to apply the Ghost Powder on the bodies.
<br><br>
"This island is full of Ghost Powder. Where did it come from?" Zen asked in the middle of his application.
<br><br>
Decker simply shrugged. "Nobody really knows."
<br><br>
"Hasn't anyone ever investigated this?" the Snake Goddess asked in curiosity. "Of course," Decker told them.
<br><br>
"Even I've tried investigating it myself. The Ghost Powder is taken out of the sloths' pockets and the sloths are also Treacherous Beings. They usually hang out in the forest quietly."
<br><br>
"The Ghost Powder in their pockets should be consumed very soon," King Ieuan said.
<br><br>
"I lived with a sloth for quite a while. The powder in its pocket was almost unlimited. I've deliberately consumed all of it but it would only take a few minutes for its pocket to fill up all over again!" Decker narrated.
<br><br>
"At first I thought it was collecting the Ghost Powder secretly so I tied it up, but then I saw its pocket swell automatically!"
<br><br>
"Amazing," the group murmured.
<br><br>
"Have you seen the inside of its pocket?" King Ieuan asked. "It might be connected with a space channel."
<br><br>
It was very difficult for the Eternal Realm warriors to construct a space channel within the Three Purities Stage. Instant teleportation was also impossible, but there were a number of creatures who could do it.
<br><br>
"I tried but then I almost died."
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but frown at Decker's answer. "Why? What happened?"
<br><br>
"The sloths' pockets are their exclusive domains. They turn hostile if you touch them," Decker muttered in explanation.
<br><br>
He remembered it quite well. When he tried to open the sloth's pocket, all the sloths within the vicinity began to emanate a strong aura.
<br><br>
The aura they exuded was much stronger than that of the hostility-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Fearing for his life, Decker immediately bolted from that place.
<br><br>
Those sloths chased him for more than a hundred miles before Decker managed to escape and survive.
<br><br>
From then on, he never dared to investigate those sloths and their secrets anymore.
<br><br>
"This island is full of strange things," Fuxi remarked.
<br><br>
While they talked, white hairs continuously fell outside their cave and formed multiple white-haired monsters.
<br><br>
Everyone looked much calmer this time and quietly watched the whitehaired monsters trudge around.
<br><br>
When they moved around the cave in a circle, the white-haired monsters suddenly reverted back into a pool of white hairs and gradually disappeared.
<br><br>
Night soon passed.
<br><br>
On the second day, Zen and his group set off to plunder more Arcana off the other races.
<br><br>
Still, everything went smoothly.
<br><br>
Their targets were not very strong and were at the second or third tier on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Under Zen's leadership, the group launched several sneak attacks which gave no room for the races to resist.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the spoils of their labor weren't as plentiful as they had hoped.
<br><br>
The leaders of the races they plundered only held a few Arcana, and some had none at all.
<br><br>
It would be the same for the oncoming days.
<br><br>
The reason why these races only had a few Arcana to spare was finally revealed after they caught a race leader who spilled the fact that they had handed them all over to the Red Demon race.
<br><br>
The Red Demon race was one of the top races on the Night View Island and they abused this position by forcing the other, smaller races to give them their Arcana.
<br><br>
Since the Red Demon race had already robbed the other races, Zen finally understood why they got so little during their raids in the past few days.
<br><br>
On their seventh night, Zen and his group applied the Ghost Powder on their bodies and rested in the cave.
<br><br>
However, a shrill scream interrupted their slumber.
<br><br>
It seemed to have come from a distance and didn't seem to be the last scream they would hear that night. King Ieuan was the first one up. "What was that? Squeak!"
<br><br>
Zen listened attentively and pointed out towards the distance. "Over there.
<br><br>
Over the mountain. It's not just one person, but an entire group."
<br><br>
Chapter 4052 Sacrifice Decker's eyes lit up. "Let's go there!"
<br><br>
"What's happening?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"There is an entire race to be sacrificed and there will be a lot of Arcana. I wonder whether you are interested in making a move or not," said Decker.
<br><br>
The prey on the Night View Island was not enough. There would often be wars among the various races. The races that lost would become captives, and the only fate of being captured was to be sacrificed.
<br><br>
All the people present had experienced a lot of fights. They understood the cruelty on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Since the members of a whole race were to be sacrificed, the number of Arcana to be produced was large.
<br><br>
Zen and his group didn't get many Arcana–now was their chance.
<br><br>
"Let's go and take a look," suggested Zen.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the others nodded. That night, they quietly left the cave and headed south.
<br><br>
Miserable screams echoed from two mountains away. The distance wasn't far from them.
<br><br>
When Zen and his group climbed over the first mountain, white hairs slowly flew towards them, coming from the mountain's side.
<br><br>
Although the Ghost Powder could hide the aura of life energy, they could still attract white-haired monsters as long as they moved.
<br><br>
Everyone stopped moving and stood like statues. The white-haired monsters then disappeared, and they continued with their journey.
<br><br>
Near a lake at the foot of the mountain, hundreds of creatures appeared trapped, bound by silver chains.
<br><br>
They didn't have Ghost Powder on their bodies and the silver chains disabled their every move.
<br><br>
Out of nowhere, the white-haired monsters appeared like sharks that had smelled blood, devouring the poor creatures.
<br><br>
The number of creatures that each white-haired monster swallowed was limited to ten. After that, the monsters turned into a pile of white hairs and gradually dissipated–leaving behind many Arcana.
<br><br>
The remaining creatures trembled as they saw their companions being swallowed little by little. Their chests were filled with fear as the blood of different colors splashed out from the horrible scene.
<br><br>
Screams, pleas, and the sound of kowtows rang one after another, yet no one could save them...
<br><br>
Flocks of bird-like creatures stood by the lake. Their wings were folded on their backs and they possessed sharp claws. Their bodies were similar to a human's. Their claws each held a sharp wooden stick, with the end smeared with thick black poison.
<br><br>
"Glede Demon race!" Decker exclaimed in surprise.
<br><br>
"I feel that they are very strong," Pearson said.
<br><br>
"It's one of the strongest races on the Night View Island," Decker said with a complicated expression. "But that's not the problem. How dare they catch so many races and sacrifice them all!"
<br><br>
"Why, aren't they supposed to do that?" Pearson was confused.
<br><br>
For both the Grand Pure Realm and the Supreme Pure Realm, the weak races were like helpless fish on a chopping board; they were always slaughtered by stronger races.
<br><br>
Since the Glede Demon race was very powerful, they wouldn't have any difficulty sacrificing their captives.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess figured out Decker's point. "If they sacrifice so many creatures at a time, it might cause a backlash..."
<br><br>
"Exactly." Decker nodded.
<br><br>
Sacrificing the defeated races often happened on the Night View Island, but it was rare to see several races sacrificed at a time.
<br><br>
Even the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race which were at par with the Glede Demon race on the Night View Island wouldn't do that.
<br><br>
The weak races were not idiots themselves. They were connected, and some of them had close associations.
<br><br>
Any force sacrificing several races at a time would cause a large number of weak races to team up as allies.
<br><br>
After allying, there would be a reshuffling of powers among the forces on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Such things had happened several times in history. The top-ranked races were killed by the alliance every time. As time passed, the alliance fell into a state of disunity, and finally, the situation returned to its original state.
<br><br>
"If the Glede Demon race dares to do so, something must have happened in the Ghost Mountain. They need to accumulate enough Arcana, alas..."
<br><br>
Decker concluded. The Wooden Leaf race was also a weak race. He felt sorry upon realizing the fate of these several races.
<br><br>
The process of the sacrifice was rough.
<br><br>
Suddenly, more than ten strong warriors had broken the silver chains, fleeing in all directions.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons on guard flew one after another. They raised the wooden sticks, aimed at the creatures, and threw them down swiftly.
<br><br>
"Puff, puff, puff..."
<br><br>
The wood sticks thrown by the Glede Demons hit their targets hard and accurately. They nailed the warriors to the ground, forbidding their escape.
<br><br>
The well-trained Glede Demons returned and lined up once again.
<br><br>
Zen and the others couldn't help but frown upon witnessing the fighting strategy.
<br><br>
Just as Decker said, the strength of the Glede Demon race was far stronger than that of ordinary races. It would indeed be very difficult to fight them.
<br><br>
The white-haired monsters were efficient. In just an hour, hundreds of creatures from other races had been completely devoured at the foot of the mountain, leaving the Arcana on the ground.
<br><br>
These creatures had lost a lot of blood as they were swallowed. The blood flowed into the lake, dying it with vivid colors as it mixed with the water's rippling.
<br><br>
"These Arcana are enough to let you all enter the Ghost Mountain," said Decker. "But the Glede Demons are very troublesome. They like to act as a group while each of them is very strong!"
<br><br>
Zen, the Snake Goddess, and the others didn't say anything. They observed in silence.
<br><br>
Getting these Arcana could save them a lot of time, and they didn't have to invade the mountains one by one.
<br><br>
It would be difficult to obtain the Arcana directly from the Glede Demon race, however, there was still a chance. They still had the Light of Annihilation, which could burst out and destroy the Treacherous Beings that the Glede Demons had merged with.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons quickly collected the Arcana on the ground and put them into a gray cloth bag. One of the Glede Demons flew to a huge nearby tree while carrying the bag.
<br><br>
Only then did Zen and the others discover that a Glede Demon was hiding on the top of the tree! The Glede Demon had sharp eyes; each of his feathers was like a dagger sticking out from his body. The feathers were pure silver, reflecting light that was inconcealable by the layer of Ghost Powder on his body.
<br><br>
"That's Bacchus, the leader of the Glede Demon race," said Decker in almost a whisper.
<br><br>
Taking over the cloth bag, Bacchus looked at the Arcana within it and seemed dissatisfied. "Nearly five hundred captives afflicted, yet you only obtained a few Arcana. These are only two thousand. Why?"
<br><br>
Several Glede Demons lowered their heads in silence.
<br><br>
The number of Arcana produced after a captive was afflicted did not result in a fixed amount.
<br><br>
Up until now, no one had figured out the rules.
<br><br>
The number of Arcana produced was at random.
<br><br>
In some cases, a lot of Arcana had appeared after small creatures were swallowed up, while there had only been a few Arcana with large creatures.
<br><br>
Even after a pair of identical twins were killed, there was a huge difference in the number of Arcana from them.
<br><br>
In other words, the amount of Arcana that appeared after the creatures were sacrificed was entirely based on the mood of the white-haired monsters.
<br><br>
For ordinary races such as the Wooden Leaf race, two thousand Arcana was a rare great harvest.
<br><br>
However, Bacchus was still unhappy with this number because the Glede Demon race paid a huge price to get these captives.
<br><br>
"We... we have accumulated a lot of Arcana. Isn't it enough?" one of the Glede Demons couldn't help asking.
<br><br>
Around this time, they had already slaughtered nearly more than forty races; there were even a few large races among them.
<br><br>
They had already surrendered a lot of Arcana in the hands of the leader, but these Glede Demons couldn't figure out the reason it was not enough.
<br><br>
"It's not enough," Bacchus answered coldly. "That's all for tonight. Follow me to the West Shrine Mountain tomorrow!"
<br><br>
When he was about to leave, he looked up at the mountain and said in a chilling voice, "You have hidden for so long. Why don't you come out?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4053 The Birdcage Zen and the others were covered by the Magic Camouflage Skin. This perfectly prevented them from being discovered by the Glede Demon race.
<br><br>
Senses couldn't be used on the Night View Island, so as long as they held their breath, no one could notice them.
<br><br>
Even if someone walked past them, they wouldn't find anything.
<br><br>
"He found us. We're so screwed!"
<br><br>
Decker's face quickly turned pale as his entire body trembled.
<br><br>
"Calm down!" Pearson tried to pacify Decker.
<br><br>
Zen and the others looked down from the mountain silently and remained motionless as they waited for situation to develop.
<br><br>
A few moments later, another group of creatures emerged from the other side of the mountain.
<br><br>
They had red skin and were covered with bright red fur. They carried big sticks on their hands and their ape-like faces looked ferocious.
<br><br>
"They're from the Red Demon race!"
<br><br>
"Then, it means Bacchus hasn't found us yet."
<br><br>
"Oh, thank goodness! I thought it was going to be our end…"
<br><br>
Decker breathed a sigh of relief as if he had barely escaped the jaws of death.
<br><br>
Even the others were obviously relieved.
<br><br>
They were also nervous but not panicking in an exaggerated way like Decker. At their current distance from the Glede Demon race and the Red Demon race, the possibility of blowing their disguise was very low.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! Bacchus, you've become dull! As far as I remember, it was one thousand and five hundred feet the last time. Now, I am able to enter the range of one thousand feet. Beware! Next time, if I make it within a range of five hundred feet, you're dead!" The redhaired creature taking the lead laughed wildly.
<br><br>
It was Tate, the leader of the Red Demon race.
<br><br>
For the past generations, these two big races of the Night View Island had been in a constant dispute.
<br><br>
Whenever there was an opportunity, the Red Demon race and the Glede Demon race would clash with each other.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! Dong! "Scrap that!" Tate hit his head with a big stick. "I've changed my mind.
<br><br>
There's not going to be a next time. Hand over all the Arcana, or you'll die!"
<br><br>
Bacchus was still standing at the top of the tree, holding the cloth bag in his hand which was filled with Arcana. His brows rose slightly as he listened to Tate's threats.
<br><br>
Without a doubt, the Red Demon race was extremely powerful.
<br><br>
In the entire Night View Island, they were considered as one of the three most powerful races.
<br><br>
However, the Glede Demon race was known to be stronger than them.
<br><br>
Among the thousand races that inhabited the Night View Island, only three of them were ranked in the first tier. These were the Red Demon race, the Glede Demon race, and the Grand Mighty race.
<br><br>
All of the other races bowed down and feared these three superior races.
<br><br>
In fact, the other races even brought offerings to them just to be on their good side.
<br><br>
However, they still needed to observe their limitations.
<br><br>
If they went too far, the other races might start forming an alliance. If that happened, they might not actually lose, but several lives would be needlessly wasted.
<br><br>
Moreover, it had become a taboo in the Night View Island to sacrifice the lives of several races at a time.
<br><br>
The Glede Demon race actually had done that, but it was not entirely their fault.
<br><br>
This happened when the Red Demon race crossed the territorial boundary of the Glede Demon race on several occasions for some time now. Then, they forced the leaders of other races to hand over their Arcana.
<br><br>
Although there wasn't a definite rule about it, the blurry boundaries of the three superior races had always existed.
<br><br>
The races that were under the Glede Demon race offered the Arcana to them out of their own volition. However, the Red Demon race dared to intrude into their territory to take away their Arcana.
<br><br>
As a race that was full of pride, they just couldn't let the barbaric Red Demon race continue to do whatever they wished, especially if they were the ones being inconvenienced.
<br><br>
Bacchus was known as a cruel and wise leader.
<br><br>
As a means to retaliate, he led his clansmen to the territory of the Red Demon race and sneakily captured some of the creatures there.
<br><br>
After that, he spread a malicious rumor.
<br><br>
It said that in order to get the treasures in the Ghost Mountain, the Red Demon race needed a lot of Arcana. To achieve their goal, they were sacrificing a large number of creatures in their territory for that purpose.
<br><br>
When the rumor started spreading, several creatures from different tribes had already been disappearing in the territory of the Red Demon race, and it continued for a few consecutive days.
<br><br>
This news spread throughout the entire Night View Island like wildfire. The natives were convinced that the rumor was true because of the sudden disappearance of several races.
<br><br>
Thus, it aroused extreme fear among the weaker races. They started forming alliances and made their moves in secret.
<br><br>
They had one goal—to hold the Red Demon race accountable.
<br><br>
Of course, the Red Demon race needed to do something to stop that.
<br><br>
With this, Tate led his team and searched for the culprit as fast as they could. At last, they found a clue that led to the Glede Demon race. Now, the Red Demon race wanted to make them pay.
<br><br>
Hearing Tate's threats, Bacchus wasn't even fazed.
<br><br>
The Glede Demon race had never been afraid of the Red Demon race. For several years, they always had the upper hand whenever the two of them met on the battlefield. Moreover, their incredible speed was their most coveted attribute. If they discerned that they were at a disadvantage, they could just escape easily. There was no way to bring all of them down.
<br><br>
While the Red Demon race had supreme defenses and infinite strength, the Glede Demon race also had the exceptional strength to match theirs. Plus, with their unimaginable speed, the Red Demon race could never catch up with them.
<br><br>
Bacchus showed a huge mocking smile as he stared down at Tate.
<br><br>
"Did you just say that you would kill me? When did you become so confident?" Bacchus asked in an indifferent tone.
<br><br>
"Ha! I'll tell you why. Take this!"
<br><br>
Tate stretched out his hand and a small cage emerged on his palm.
<br><br>
It looked like a delicate birdcage, but it was too small to be one.
<br><br>
It was just the size of a palm, and thus no bird could actually be locked inside it.
<br><br>
Bacchus narrowed his eyes as he stared at Tate and the birdcage that he released. His alertness heightened as he didn't know what Tate could do next.
<br><br>
There was a huge grin on Tate's face as he tossed the birdcage in the air. In the blink of an eye, it expanded at an amazing speed.
<br><br>
"What the…"
<br><br>
Bacchus had never seen an Other Shore Token like this before.
<br><br>
As it instantly expanded in front of his eyes, he instinctively realized that it must be an item to trap them.
<br><br>
"Stay away from it!"
<br><br>
Bacchus immediately spread out his wings, turned into a silver light, and quickly flew away.
<br><br>
He knew that flying at high speed would shake off the Ghost Powder on his body. Without it, the white-haired monsters would surely come out and get him.
<br><br>
However, he couldn't care much about them at this moment.
<br><br>
In his mind, he could just apply the Ghost Powder again when the whitehaired monsters already appeared. Moreover, the Red Demon race also wouldn't dare to make a move once the white-haired monsters made an appearance.
<br><br>
However, the speed at which the birdcage expanded was far beyond Bacchus's expectations. It beat his top speed, and as he soared into the sky, the birdcage had already entrapped the entire mountain.
<br><br>
Crash! Unable to immediately stop his movements, Bacchus crashed into the birdcage.
<br><br>
The birdcage was actually formed by a thin type of net.
<br><br>
But the net was made of a unique kind of space, giving it an indestructible form.
<br><br>
It was so sturdy that it was almost impossible to destroy.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! The other Glede Demons also crashed into the birdcage. They just bounced back and saw that there wasn't even a scratch on its surface.
<br><br>
Bacchus was obviously infuriated. With a cold expression in his eyes, he spread out his wings again.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He rushed towards the birdcage and slashed it with his blade-like feathers.
<br><br>
However, it still didn't work.
<br><br>
There was still no dent or whatsoever on its surface.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! "I'm just getting started," Bacchus said as he wore a serious expression on his face.
<br><br>
Immediately after, milky white lights appeared on Bacchus's head and wings.
<br><br>
Then, a pair of bigger white wings appeared and enveloped his original wings.
<br><br>
He had merged with a powerful Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
With this, he possessed stronger power and theurgies.
<br><br>
Once Bacchus started focusing on a certain thing, he wouldn't stop until he succeeded.
<br><br>
This time, his only goal was to break the giant birdcage.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He rushed and attacked the birdcage again using his white blade-like wings.
<br><br>
"Take this! Vertical slash!"
<br><br>
Crash! The strikes made on the birdcage produced an explosive sound. The birdcage shook and so did the mountain entrapped by it.
<br><br>
However, even after Bacchus's vicious attacks, the birdcage was still intact.
<br><br>
He had to admit that the treasure was truly fascinating.
<br><br>
Bacchus chose not to waste his energy and turned to Tate.
<br><br>
"Is this even something from the Night View Island?" Bacchus asked, pointing to the unbreakable birdcage.
<br><br>
Sensing Bacchus's frustration, Tate grinned complacently. "You don't need to know about that. But I'll let you in on a secret… All of the Glede Demons, including you, will die today!"
<br><br>
"Really? Please. Don't make me laugh." Bacchus let out a deep sigh and instantly calmed down. His arrogant eyes returned and stared down at Tate.
<br><br>
"Just because you've trapped us inside this birdcage, you think that you've already won? Why are you so stupid?"
<br><br>
Everyone knew that in a head-on battle, there was no way that the Glede Demon race would be inferior to the Red Demon race.
<br><br>
Bacchus just tried to escape because he didn't want a needless duel with the Red Demons at this moment.
<br><br>
Otherwise, the other superior race, the Grand Mighty race, would just benefit from their losses.
<br><br>
However, being trapped in the birdcage, Bacchus had no other choice but to remind the Red Demons whom they were facing.
<br><br>
Chapter 4054 Holy Stones As soon as Bacchus finished speaking, the Glede Demons followed suit and spread their wings.
<br><br>
White light flashed on their heads as pairs of white wings wrapped their bodies.
<br><br>
They had merged with the Treacherous Beings named Wolf Owls.
<br><br>
The hostility-level Treacherous Beings were also divided into varying grades—the Wolf Owls were the strongest among all.
<br><br>
With their great size, they wrapped around the Glede Demons like armor, drastically improving their defensive power, strength, and speed.
<br><br>
So long as the Treacherous Beings remained intact, one could say that killing a Glede Demon was nearly impossible.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
The Glede Demons rushed into the air, floating closely behind Bacchus.
<br><br>
As long as the latter gave an order, they would fall like sharp knives and cut the Red Demons to pieces.
<br><br>
But much to their dismay, Bacchus remained silent.
<br><br>
Never before had his intuition failed him.
<br><br>
The Red Demons' performance today was indeed strange.
<br><br>
Tate, in particular, seemed especially strange.
<br><br>
Relying merely on the birdcage wouldn't have given him so much confidence.
<br><br>
He was well aware of Bacchus' strength.
<br><br>
Even in a head-on fight, the Red Demons would also suffer a great loss.
<br><br>
From the looks of it, the Red Demon race still had a backup plan available to them.
<br><br>
"Leader! Let's head down there and charge!" called out one of the Glede Demons.
<br><br>
It was none other than Bacchus' assistant, whose eyes were full of fighting spirit.
<br><br>
"Let's cut these Red Demons to pieces!"
<br><br>
"How dare these guys be so arrogant…"
<br><br>
"They're courting death!"
<br><br>
These Glede Demons had always thought themselves to be the noblest race on the Night View Island. It was only natural that they thought so low of the Red Demon race.
<br><br>
Especially when the latter provoked them—the Glede Demon race had been fully prepared to fight to kill.
<br><br>
But Bacchus seemed to remain rather hesitant.
<br><br>
He looked at the faint smile on Tate's face—the latter must have been scheming.
<br><br>
But what sort of method could the Red Demons have that could allow them to defeat the other race so easily? No such method existed, as far as Bacchus knew.
<br><br>
At the very least, he had never seen such a thing on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
As Bacchus thought it through, his eyes grew colder and colder.
<br><br>
Then, he spread out his wings.
<br><br>
Under the white light, the wings were like sharp swords that covered him.
<br><br>
The ordinary Glede Demons had merged with Wolf Owls which were hostility-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Bacchus had merged with a resentment-level Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
It was the Wolf Owl King! Its white wings were enchantingly beautiful, decorated with unique runes all over.
<br><br>
Once these runes were activated, wisps of blue lightning circled the wings.
<br><br>
From the blue electric current formed the outline of a Wolf Owl—it was visible from quite the distance, even in the night.
<br><br>
"The warriors of Glede Demon race, charge to kill!"
<br><br>
At the very moment Bacchus gave the order, the Glede Demons immediately turned into white lights, all of them surging downward.
<br><br>
Their charge was truly terrifying.
<br><br>
Their size was intimidating enough, but they were also incomparably agile to top it off. Not even the Red Demons, who had protective leathery skin, could resist their fast attacks.
<br><br>
And after the Glede Demons had merged with Wolf Owls, their strength was increased dramatically.
<br><br>
When they flew down like this, they were nothing like birds.
<br><br>
Instead, they seemed more like giant sabers descending from the sky that could pierce through anything that got in their way.
<br><br>
After battling the Glede Demon race for so many years, the Red Demon race clearly knew of their terrifying power.
<br><br>
But of course, they had their own means to deal with them.
<br><br>
It was time for them to summon their Treacherous Beings, which were black turtles.
<br><br>
These were a kind of extremely solid worm-shaped creatures.
<br><br>
Once the Red Demons merged with them, they produced a solid armor that could cover any surface of their bodies.
<br><br>
The black turtles could indeed resist the Glede Demons' attack, but that was it. If the Red Demons wanted to hurt them, they were in for quite the challenge.
<br><br>
Most of the Red Demons could only suffer passive attacks in the fight against the Glede Demon race.
<br><br>
But this time, the action of the Red Demon race was very unexpected.
<br><br>
Facing the other race, they didn't activate the Treacherous Beings immediately, but instead raised their hands one after another.
<br><br>
Each of them carried a small stone in their hands.
<br><br>
All the bean-sized stones glowed brightly with some sort of light.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation suddenly burst out from the stones.
<br><br>
While the Glede Demons leading the charge couldn't tell what it was, they could sense something was wrong. Still, they continued to rush along.
<br><br>
'It's just a ray of light… Even if it's powerful, so what? How much harm could it really do?' 'It couldn't possibly penetrate the Treacherous Beings and kill us, anyway, ' they thought to themselves.
<br><br>
Indeed, the Light of Annihilation couldn't penetrate the Treacherous Beings, much less directly kill the Glede Demons.
<br><br>
But it could actually kill the Treacherous Beings themselves.
<br><br>
The hostility-level Treacherous Beings fell in fear of the Light of Annihilation—they had no means to resist it.
<br><br>
Any of them that the light touched was sure to be killed.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
The Wolf Owls that were attached to the surface of the Glede Demons began rapidly collapsing under the light.
<br><br>
When the Glede Demons rushed to the front of the Red Demons, the Wolf Owls on their bodies suddenly shattered, turning to nothing but dust.
<br><br>
Still, the Glade Demon race was one of the highest-ranked races on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Even without being able to rely on the Treacherous Beings, they still possessed extraordinary strength—they could defeat the vast majority of any creatures with their raw strength.
<br><br>
But the Red Demon race was known to be just as powerful—they could also make use of Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Their hands continued to emit a white light, and soon, they were wearing a layer of white 'gloves.' From this layer grew out sets of sharp claws.
<br><br>
The black turtles weren't only able to provide the Red Demons with impressive defensive power, but they also had their own pair of sharp claws.
<br><br>
Crack! And so the Red Demons waved their sharp claws, grabbing at the Glede Demons.
<br><br>
If the Glede Demons were still in possession of the Treacherous Beings as protections, then the Red Demons' claws were useless. At the worst, they could merely leave some scars on their bodies, all of which would recover immediately.
<br><br>
And the Glede Demons could also use the Wolf Owls' claws to do the same to the Red Demons—the latter could recover just as instantaneously.
<br><br>
For thousands of years, the evenly-matched forces were stuck in an on and off battle.
<br><br>
But because the Glede Demons were faster and more agile, more often than not, they held the initiative.
<br><br>
But this time, the Glede Demons' Treacherous Beings had been destroyed.
<br><br>
Sharp claws cut into the Glede Demons, tearing them to pieces.
<br><br>
Their wings, heads, and torsos were all completely separated.
<br><br>
They died a truly miserable death.
<br><br>
In the first round of charge, the five to six Glede Demons that had rushed to the front lost all protection from the Treacherous Beings and were easily torn to bits.
<br><br>
Behind them, the other Glede Demons were stunned in shock before they suddenly surged high into the sky.
<br><br>
Their speed was so incredible that they almost hit the ceiling of the birdcage in the sudden turn—they had to fly close to the cage walls for a time before they could properly distance themselves from the Red Demon race.
<br><br>
But Bacchus followed closely behind them to charge.
<br><br>
Tate, of course, was his target.
<br><br>
His main goal remained to be the Ghost Mountain—he didn't want to fight hand-to-hand with the Red Demon race.
<br><br>
Once the leader was taken care of, dealing with the rest was a piece of cake.
<br><br>
He was stronger than Tate, after all.
<br><br>
After taking care of him, the Red Demons would disperse naturally.
<br><br>
But just as he rushed toward Tate, the latter pulled out a small triangular stone.
<br><br>
In the next moment, the Light of Annihilation struck Bacchus' body with deadly precision.
<br><br>
The Wolf Owl King was a resentment-level Treacherous Being, after all.
<br><br>
It wasn't like a mere hostility-level Treacherous Being that would shatter directly under the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
But in an instant, Bacchus felt a heart-wrenching pain from the 'Wolf Owl King.' The latter's wings, feathers, head, and tail all drooped down as if it had lost all strength, slumping onto Bacchus' body like a deflated balloon.
<br><br>
In such a state, the Treacherous Being could no longer protect Bacchus.
<br><br>
How could Tate let such an opportunity go to waste? Like iron pincers, his large hands grabbed at Bacchus' head.
<br><br>
Chapter 4055 Exposure Bacchus was after all not an ordinary Glede Demon.
<br><br>
Therefore, he quickly reacted in just the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
However, Tate had caught the soft Wolf Owl King, so Bacchus, who was wrapped by the Wolf Owl King's body, naturally got dragged along as well.
<br><br>
Now, all Tate had to do was to cut open the Wolf Owl King and crush Bacchus into pieces.
<br><br>
He was sure that he would kill Bacchus, who had always defeated him, this time, and it would be glorious! Unfortunately for him, Bacchus' reaction was faster.
<br><br>
Bacchus did his best not to panic in such a critical moment, but he made a wise decision to take back the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
That Treacherous Being had a particularly unique form.
<br><br>
When it was soft, it was as soft as feathers or even water.
<br><br>
But when it was sturdy, it became similar to the most powerful Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
When Bacchus thought of it, the Wolf Owl King turned into pieces of white gauze and shrank back into his body.
<br><br>
Of course, Tate wanted to snatch it, but he could not. He could only stand and watch the white gauze slip away.
<br><br>
"You want to run away?"
<br><br>
he shouted as he headed straight for Bacchus.
<br><br>
In turn, Bacchus' wings unfurled, and he quickly rose into the sky.
<br><br>
He sighed in relief, but it was short-lived. Right after he temporarily got away, something suddenly appeared in front of him. "What is that white light?" he said in shock.
<br><br>
Still, no matter how powerful that thing was, he was not afraid.
<br><br>
After all, he could defeat everything with the help of the Wolf Owl King.
<br><br>
The Wolf Owl King was his most powerful magical weapon, and also his closest comrade in arms.
<br><br>
After countless battles, he and the Wolf Owl King became one.
<br><br>
Just now, the Wolf Owl King felt a sharp stab of pain, and Bacchus felt sorry for it.
<br><br>
The white light of the Red Demons was so terrifying that it could directly injure Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
How did such a thing appear in the Night View Island? For so many years, the members of the Night View Island depended on the Treacherous Beings to fight their enemies.
<br><br>
They were indeed powerful, but so were the many races.
<br><br>
Currently, the white light in the hands of the Red Demons made the resentment-level Treacherous Being lose its strength and hostility-level Treacherous Beings collapse. It was terrifying to even think about it.
<br><br>
It was like when a group of people fought using sticks, and suddenly, one of them got a knife. Of course, it was an unfair advantage.
<br><br>
What made things worse was that every member of the Red Demon race possessed that white light.
<br><br>
At that moment, Bacchus felt desperate and almost wanted to give up.
<br><br>
"Leader, what should we do?"
<br><br>
"The white light can kill our Treacherous Beings!"
<br><br>
"If we lose the Treacherous Beings, we can't defeat the Red Demon race..."
<br><br>
At that point, the Glede Demons panicked in fear and gathered behind Bacchus.
<br><br>
Although he was also at a loss on what to do, as the leader of the Glede Demons, he had a great mindset and quickly forced himself to calm down.
<br><br>
Six Glede Demons had already died in the current round of the battle.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the Wolf Owls on the seven other Glede Demons' bodies had fallen.
<br><br>
All in all, thirteen Glede Demons lost their powers.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the small stones in the hands of the Red Demons still glowed brightly as ever. Additionally, such a deadly treasure was not disposable.
<br><br>
Soon enough, Bacchus came to a conclusion.
<br><br>
They couldn't fight against the Red Demons. If they failed to escape from the birdcage, they would die.
<br><br>
"Don't confront the Red Demons head-on! Fly around the birdcage!" he shouted.
<br><br>
"But we can't fly out!" said one Glede Demon. Howls filled the air as the other Glede Demons behind him kept clawing at the birdcage for dear life.
<br><br>
Bacchus did not answer.
<br><br>
Now, they were really in a hopeless situation.
<br><br>
Their only hope was that the birdcage would not last long. When the birdcage collapsed by itself, they could escape.
<br><br>
If Bacchus could flee, he would surely ask about the news and find a way to get those kinds of stones like crazy! To avoid being easily caught by the Red Demons, he asked the Glede Demons to fly around the birdcage. After all, they could still quickly get rid of the Red Demons even in the small space.
<br><br>
However, it was not easy to catch and kill them.
<br><br>
To their surprise, the Red Demons did not have the slightest intention to fly and capture them.
<br><br>
Instead, they all stood on the ground and watched them fly.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen and his group lurked around under the protection of the Magic Camouflage Skin and watched the battle between the two races.
<br><br>
Even the two strongest races had a fatal weakness when they used the Treacherous Beings, which was they could not resist the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
Thus, Zen and the others had felt confident that with the Light of Annihilation, they would win against these races.
<br><br>
However, no one among them expected that just as the two races began fighting, the Red Demons brought out the Holy Stones! There was no Holy Stone on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
That was what Decker had said, and based on Bacchus' expression, they saw that he also thought the same.
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit Civilization has arrived," the Snake Goddess prompted.
<br><br>
"It seems that they acted faster, and they allied with the Red Demon race so quickly..." Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Since the Element Spirit Civilization had handed over the Holy Stones to the Red Demons, he and the others also needed to do something.
<br><br>
Perhaps, they could be allies with the Glede Demons in the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Even then, they were still hesitant as they hid in the Magic Camouflage Skin. It was not wise to expose their whereabouts too early. Besides, it was highly likely that the Element Spirit Civilization also tracked them.
<br><br>
While they thought about it, Tate had already grown tired of the Glede Demons' movements.
<br><br>
He chuckled and said, "This birdcage is for you. Now, you cannot fly out, and you will suffer greatly!"
<br><br>
With that, he reached out and pinched the birdcage hard.
<br><br>
Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle...
<br><br>
As a result, the birdcage that covered the mountain began to shrink.
<br><br>
Then, the relatively large space began to shrink continually as well.
<br><br>
Bacchus saw the shrinking birdcage and became even more desperate.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings could not help them in such a narrow space, so they had no choice but to suffer the Red Demons' torture.
<br><br>
As the birdcage continued to shrink, its edges suddenly touched something.
<br><br>
Tate looked towards it and saw a "space" that moved as the birdcage shrank.
<br><br>
There was something hidden inside it! His blood ran cold.
<br><br>
"Who is it?" he asked sharply.
<br><br>
Whoever got trapped in that birdcage, they would surely be ground into pieces.
<br><br>
The Holy Stone was strong, but it was a secret weapon. One could use its maximum power only during surprise attacks.
<br><br>
In actuality, Tate wanted to eradicate both the Glede Demon race and the Grand Mighty race.
<br><br>
"Come out!"
<br><br>
He took out a bone spear from behind and threw it towards that space, which kept changing color.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The bone spear flew towards the target at once.
<br><br>
Just as it was about to hit the target, a hand stretched out from the space and firmly caught the bone spear.
<br><br>
Naturally, Tate was surprised.
<br><br>
The Red Demons were also stunned.
<br><br>
There were very few creatures on the Night View Island that could catch the bone spear Tate had thrown.
<br><br>
Also, all of those who could catch it relied on Treacherous Beings to do it for them.
<br><br>
Zen who caught the bone spear lifted the Magic Camouflage Skin and smiled. "I just wanted to watch..." he said.
<br><br>
When the Red Demons and the Glede Demons saw him and the other human beings, they were stunned again.
<br><br>
Tate and Bacchus were the most surprised.
<br><br>
How could they not, when they knew more about the Ghost Mountain than Decker did? Decker had only seen Zhurong, and that was because only Zhurong had occasionally appeared over the years.
<br><br>
In the depths of the Ghost Mountain, however, there were still dozens of human beings! Moreover, the Ghost Mountain had recognized three humans as the Great Ghost Priests of the mountain.
<br><br>
Both Bacchus and Tate dreamed of becoming the Great Ghost Priests, and that was why Bacchus collected the Arcana like mad.
<br><br>
The truth behind it was if he became the Great Ghost Priest, he could fuse with a hatred-level Treacherous Being, and become an invincible entity on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Chapter 4056 Mess Up Naturally, Bacchus regarded the sudden appearance of these people as good news. This could probably change the course of things.
<br><br>
Now that the Glede Demon race had been backed into a corner, he hoped against all hope that someone would arrive to make a difference.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Tate was not thoroughly pleased by this recent turn of event.
<br><br>
This could ruin everything.
<br><br>
He was shrinking the birdcage when all of a sudden, some humans appeared inside it. Why now? Where did these people even come from? He was utterly baffled.
<br><br>
Was it possible that they were from somewhere outside the Night View Island? But where? Even though the Night View Island was an isolated place, the creatures in it still had a certain knowledge of the outside world.
<br><br>
If one stood upon the mountains surrounding the Night View Island, they could easily see other Pure Sky Platforms. However, no one would be able to fly there.
<br><br>
It was also known that there was a cave in the center of the lake. A long passageway was connected to it. Nevertheless, the passageway had long been broken. No one would be able to pass through it.
<br><br>
Two days ago, Tate took his clansmen with him to search for Arcana from every house they encountered.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, the Red Demon race wouldn't raid other races. For one thing, the Night View Island housed too many races. If they took it too far, they would be the first one to suffer.
<br><br>
However, the Ghost Mountain needed a new Great Ghost Priest. This might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
<br><br>
Obviously, Tate would never let this amazing opportunity just pass him by.
<br><br>
He was determined to seize it while it stood.
<br><br>
The small races were also well-aware about the changes in the Ghost Mountain. Once every couple of years, the Red Demon race would come and the small races would obediently hand their Arcana over to them.
<br><br>
They needed not surrender all of the Arcana they had. Nevertheless, they still had to give away most of them.
<br><br>
While Tate was searching for the Arcana, he suddenly saw a few flames emerging from the center of the lake.
<br><br>
The flames were moving closer to the lake shore at a very fast rate. They were heading straight towards Tate.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, he realized that he was in grave danger. He immediately released his Treacherous Being. It took the form of a huge tortoise. It possessed the highest defensive power among all of the resentment-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
As the flames continued to surge towards his direction, a flash of white light shot out from the center of it.
<br><br>
Tate didn't take the flash of light seriously at first. He was quite confident it wouldn't be able to reach him.
<br><br>
He thought it was impossible for such an energy fluctuation to break through his strong defense. Tate had complete faith in his Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
However, the supposedly indestructible tortoise suddenly appeared weakened soon after the white light hit its body. It even looked like it was suffering from an extremely horrific torture. It began thrashing around in agony.
<br><br>
How could this be? This tortoise was a resentment-level Treacherous Being! Tate was utterly bewildered. He couldn't believe his own eyes.
<br><br>
The other members of the Red Demon race were also dumbfounded.
<br><br>
They were well-aware of how powerful the tortoise was. How could it succumb to such a feeble-looking energy? Even the strongest warrior of the Grand Mighty race and Bacchus of the Glede Demon race had never been able to break through the tortoise's shell.
<br><br>
They thought nothing could ever penetrate it.
<br><br>
However, the white light was able to incapacitate it quite easily! Why? Not one of them was able to explain how this came to be.
<br><br>
As soon as the flames reached the shore, their blazing temperature made the water boil. They released steam and raised the temperature of the area.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the flames turned into three human-shaped fire spirits.
<br><br>
Little by little, pieces of burning red armor began to condense all over the fire spirits' bodies. Soon enough they were fully covered in armor.
<br><br>
Evidently, the three fire spirits came from the Holy Wings Armor. All of them belonged to Slade just like Gavyn.
<br><br>
Although the Element Spirit Civilization arrived at the Treasure Bottle Platform on time, they were still unable to stop the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven managed to escape them easily.
<br><br>
The Godly Way extracted from the bottle was way too important to them.
<br><br>
Naturally, the Eye Spirit didn't want the Grandmaster of Heaven to take it away. Therefore, they determinedly chased after him even outside of the Treasure Bottle Platform.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit was utterly relentless.
<br><br>
They had to get the Godly Way back no matter what. They would still chase after him even if they had to go through the Amber Cave which was known as the Nihility race's lair.
<br><br>
The Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization had been fighting against each other for such a long time. Both of these races always had something that would give them advantage over the other.
<br><br>
But this time, the Nihility race had taken away something they shouldn't have. Therefore, the Element Spirit Civilization would stop at nothing.
<br><br>
They were determined to fight even it would cost them their lives! Halfway through the chase, the three stone men placed in the underground cave were completely destroyed. The Treacherous Beings inside them were slain as well.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit instantly sensed that Zen and his group had entered the underground cave.
<br><br>
However, the Eye Spirit was busy chasing down the Grandmaster of Heaven. Both Claire and Gavyn were helping him pursue the Grandmaster of Heaven. Thus, he had to send out the other members of the Element Spirit race in Slade's body.
<br><br>
The three fire spirits were named Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey.
<br><br>
They were the leaders of the fire spirits inside Slade's body. Even though they were not on par with Gavyn in terms of strength, they were not much inferior to him.
<br><br>
They arrived at the underground cave a little too late. After looking around, they discovered that Zen and his companions had already disappeared.
<br><br>
In the past, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others had also quietly vanished.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization hadn't come into contact with the Treacherous Beings back then. Obviously, they were not aware of the existence of the Four Spirits Sect. They also did not know where the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were hiding.
<br><br>
After a long period of time, the Element Spirit Civilization finally discovered how to get to the Jade Pure Realm and enter the Pure Sky Platforms.
<br><br>
They were just about to enter the Night View Island when they faced a very unfortunate scenario. The passageway had already been destroyed by the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others.
<br><br>
This time, Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey just went straight into the pool. After boiling the water in the pool, they were able to see the passageway.
<br><br>
When they saw it getting repaired, they became ecstatic. It wasn't as hopeless as they first thought it was.
<br><br>
The flames emanating from their bodies were intense and scorching hot, which made the water around boil instantly.
<br><br>
Before setting out, the Eye Spirit instructed them that they only needed to inquire about the movements of Zen and his group. Zen might have managed to repair the passageway. But if he failed, the three of them could just lurk in the cave to observe.
<br><br>
The three fire spirits didn't actually take the Eye Spirit's words seriously.
<br><br>
They doubted that the passageway of the Night View Island could be repaired so easily.
<br><br>
Therefore, they didn't expect that the Eye Spirit was absolutely right.
<br><br>
Obviously, they knew that the Night View Island was far more significant than the lives of Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
They were so thrilled that they ignored the Eye Spirit's words. They hurried into the Night View Island through the passageway.
<br><br>
As soon as they emerged from the lake, they encountered the Red Demon race. It seemed like these demons could easily be intimidated.
<br><br>
This was exactly what they wanted. They needed to gather as much information as they could right off the bat.
<br><br>
"Hurry up! Put out these flames!"
<br><br>
Tate ordered his clansmen all the while retreating farther away from the fire spirits.
<br><br>
With the protection from the turtles, the Red Demons were not exactly afraid of getting burned by ordinary flames. But just as they took a step forward, the turtles covering their bodies were instantly pierced by the white light.
<br><br>
The turtles immediately collapsed.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The Red Demons who rushed in front suddenly burst into flames. Their bodies were immediately burned to a crisp. Their corpses were completely charred.
<br><br>
When the other Red Demons saw this, they were terrified and retreated quickly.
<br><br>
Seeing that they were severely disadvantaged, Tate thought about escaping as well. However, it didn't seem like he would be able to do so.
<br><br>
The three fire spirits turned into roaring flames and effectively surrounded Tate and his clansmen.
<br><br>
"Answer all my questions, or no one will ever see you alive again!"
<br><br>
Sanderson began intimidating them for information.
<br><br>
Tate was absolutely terrified. As they were leaning at each other's backs, he felt his companions quivering with fear.
<br><br>
He actually felt like his race would be exterminated today. They would be killed on the spot if he didn't cooperate.
<br><br>
With all honesty, he told Sanderson what had happened on the Night View Island. He even explained everything in detail.
<br><br>
He couldn't stop thinking how this might be their ends.
<br><br>
But after he finished speaking, he was surprised the three fire spirits didn't attack them. It seemed like they had no intention of killing them now. He was even more astounded when they threw more than ten Holy Stones in front of him. They even taught him how to use the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
"In three days' time, I expect you to collect all of the Arcana available on the Night View Island," Sanderson ordered Tate.
<br><br>
Before, this would have been an impossible task to accomplish.
<br><br>
But with the help of the Holy Stones, nothing was impossible.
<br><br>
If they used the Light of Annihilation like they were taught, the creatures on the Night View Island would be no match for the Red Demon race at all.
<br><br>
The first ones Tate robbed of Arcana were the creatures on the territory of the Red Demon race. This was the best place he could start.
<br><br>
After he took every single Arcanum from these creatures, he proceeded to rob those within the territory of the Glede Demon race.
<br><br>
Now, Tate's greatest goal was to annihilate the Glede Demon race as well as the Grand Mighty race using the power of the Holy Stones.
<br><br>
Naturally, Bacchus couldn't just stand and watch as Tate raided the areas on the border of the Glede Demon race. He brought his people with him to slaughter the creatures from the Red Demon race's territory. The battle between the two races commenced tonight.
<br><br>
Chapter 4057 Cooperation Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey all had a clear goal: to dominate the entirety of Night View Island as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Thus, they decided to pour their combined efforts onto realizing this goal, so much so that they even lost interest in trying to track Zen's whereabouts.
<br><br>
With this goal realized, the Eye Spirit could enter the Ghost Mountain directly when he came here.
<br><br>
This would make for great credit.
<br><br>
If they used the credit they would gain from this, they could apply to the Eye Spirit to take back the control of the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
Previously, the Holy Wings Armor was controlled by Slade, which assured the peace of the Element Spirit race inside it.
<br><br>
All factions had their own positions but the minority was always subordinate to the majority. Once all opinions were organized and consolidated, everyone was found to have sided with Slade.
<br><br>
It was through this that everyone managed to live peacefully for many years.
<br><br>
Factional disputes erupted every now and then within the Holy Wings Armor, the matter with Gavyn as quite the most significant example.
<br><br>
It was forbidden for him to take the Holy Wings Armor away but, through Claire's support, Gavyn was able to do it, which earned him the ire of the members of the Element Spirit race, the fire spirits in particular.
<br><br>
Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey were three fire spirits who were the most dissatisfied with Gavyn.
<br><br>
Normally, these three fire spirits should've already gone back since they found nobody in the cave and confirmed that the passageway had already been repaired. Anything else outside of their immediate tasks should've been ignored.
<br><br>
However, in order to obtain the Holy Wings Armor, they had to make a great contribution that would qualify them to make a request to the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Once they gained control of the Red Demon race, they would quickly make their way towards the Grand Mighty race's territory on the southern tip of the Night View Island. So long as they were able to destroy one race and control the other two, then their mission would be complete.
<br><br>
None of them expected Zen and the others to pop out of nowhere and get involved in the battle.
<br><br>
"Dave! Kill them!"
<br><br>
Tate ordered.
<br><br>
To him, so long as he had the Holy Stones then he could control everything.
<br><br>
Tate felt no fear against those Glede Demons, so what more these mere humans? The humans in the Ghost Mountain might be very powerful but there was no way they'd be on these people's side since they rarely left the mountain.
<br><br>
Dave quickly nodded in obeisance. "Yes, patriarch!"
<br><br>
As a strong Red Demon, Dave was easily one of Tate's most capable generals.
<br><br>
He quickly led ten other Red Demons and let out a mighty, thunderous roar! As they let out their battle cry, their bodies glowed as every square inch was completely covered by the turtles.
<br><br>
Armed and boosted, the Red Demons were ready for battle and quickly rushed towards the mountainside.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! Like boulders that came careening down onto the side of a mountain, these Red Demons made the earth tremble as they ran.
<br><br>
The sight was incredibly terrifying. Huge, hulking creatures with thick skin made long, fast strides as they made their way to battle. Their sharp claws were their most formidable weapons and were able to shatter everything in their wake.
<br><br>
Bacchus sported a complicated look on his face as he led the Glede Demons towards the top of the birdcage.
<br><br>
They too did not know where Zen and his group had come from.
<br><br>
However, the enemy of their enemy was a friend and the best thing to do now was forge an alliance with these newcomers.
<br><br>
He knew that once Tate killed these humans, he'd definitely be next.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, as much as the Glede Demons were determined to fight, the white light upon their opponents' bodies was too strong.
<br><br>
If they rushed towards them, they would only be killed instantly.
<br><br>
'Damn it!' Bacchus cursed inwardly.
<br><br>
It felt like a sick joke that these powerful Treacherous Beings proved to be so weak in front of mere white light.
<br><br>
While Bacchus tried to think of a way for them to fight, the Red Demons had already reached Zen! At that moment, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, King Ieuan, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters stretched out their palms.
<br><br>
On their palms were Holy Stones, bright and bursting with power.
<br><br>
These Holy Stones did not contain much Light of Annihilation but could still easily kill hostility-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Buzz! With a slight, buzzing sound, streaks of light shot forth from the Holy Stones and struck the oncoming Red Demons.
<br><br>
Before all these, Dave had thought that they had already won.
<br><br>
There was no way these humans, who hadn't absorbed Treacherous Beings, could engage in combat against them.
<br><br>
However, just as he and his men got close enough, these humans suddenly raised their hands and defied all his expectations! What in the world was that white light? Was it actually the Light of Annihilation? Whatever it was, the sight shook Dave to the bone.
<br><br>
Just as he realized that something was wrong, the bright Light of Annihilation hit him square on the chest.
<br><br>
In an instant, his turtle collapsed.
<br><br>
The loss of the turtle immediately reduced his speed and power.
<br><br>
Treacherous Beings were indispensable to the creatures on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
At that moment, without the turtles' protection, Dave and his men became sitting ducks.
<br><br>
Soon enough, he found the end of a spear pointed right in the middle of his forehead.
<br><br>
It was a spear Zen borrowed from Campbell.
<br><br>
Pop! All Dave felt was a sharp sting before a sharp, splitting pain flooded his senses and he lost consciousness.
<br><br>
His head, simply put, had exploded by the force Zen exerted onto the spear.
<br><br>
Whoosh! It wasn't over. Having disposed of him, Zen quickly turned around and turned his weapon towards his other opponents. In a flash, another Red Demon's head also exploded.
<br><br>
Campbell's spear was a good match for the Light of Annihilation. If Zen chose to infuse it with the light then it would shine a bright, blinding silver.
<br><br>
However, he didn't see the need to do that and found it unnecessary.
<br><br>
Holy Stones were previously unheard of on the Night View Island so the creatures naturally did not know yet how to guard themselves against the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
Once the Treacherous Beings had been absorbed by the creatures, their original bodies were insulated by the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
This was the best course of action when there was no Light of Annihilation on the island.
<br><br>
It was a known fact that the Red Demon race and the Glede Demon race were both very powerful.
<br><br>
The Wooden Leaf race could never hope to compare. The thorny Treacherous Beings they absorbed were weak and were actually the root cause of their mediocrity.
<br><br>
However, despite their power, both the Red Demon race and the Glede Demon race were unable to withstand a single blow from the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
Pop! Pop! Pop! Zen navigated fluidly around the Red Demons, almost as if he was a ghost.
<br><br>
The spear in his hand was a deadly harbinger of death that quickly ended the life of each Red Demon within the vicinity.
<br><br>
It was jarring for the Red Demons that this young man was able to power through the Treacherous Beings they had absorbed and even make their heads explode with a single spear. In their stupefied state, they found themselves unable to do anything against such a formidable opponent.
<br><br>
A few Red Demons turned their tail and ran but it was in vain since Zen caught up to them eventually.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop! A massacre. Dave had led his men into a massacre.
<br><br>
"This, this..."
<br><br>
"They also have the Light of Annihilation!"
<br><br>
"How in the world can we fight against them?!"
<br><br>
Not long ago, the Red Demons had also used the Light of Annihilation to defeat the Glede Demons.
<br><br>
Never in their lives would they have thought that the weapon they once wielded to victory would someday be used against them.
<br><br>
It was with this thought that a few Red Demons began to tremble.
<br><br>
They were the apex predators in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
They were the strongest, the deadliest, and the most formidable.
<br><br>
Over the years, the Treacherous Beings they had absorbed merged with their bodies and gave them strength. Without the Treacherous Beings, it was as if they forgot how to fight entirely.
<br><br>
Decker, who stood at the back of the crowd, was quite frightened by the spectacle.
<br><br>
He knew that Zen and his group were powerful but not to this extent. He never expected that they'd suddenly take out the Holy Stones and utilize them so as to kill the Red Demons so quickly.
<br><br>
He was practically speechless! Could the creatures outside the Night View Island truly be so powerful? It wasn't just Decker. Tate, who also watched the entire scene unfold, could only stare at Zen in disbelief.
<br><br>
Only then did he truly realize the gravity of his recklessness.
<br><br>
He never should've made an enemy out of these humans. Could there still be a chance for him to correct his mistake? Those flame creatures were willing to cooperate with him. Maybe these humans would too? Tate forced a smile on his face and decided to take on the diplomatic route this time around. Those flame creatures came to the Night View Island to collect Arcana and he did not doubt that these humans came here for the exact same purpose.
<br><br>
"It's your first time visiting the Night View Island, correct? You must be here for the Ghost Mountain. Our race has actually collected quite a lot of Arcana. Perhaps we can settle this fight with a promise of cooperation?"
<br><br>
He did not care who between the fire creatures and these humans would finally obtain the Arcana but it would be best if they fought with each other instead of against them.
<br><br>
However, Zen merely ignored him and instead turned to Bacchus. "Hey! What do you say we kill these Red Demons together?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4058 Allies At that moment, Tate and the Red Demons feared for their lives because of Zen's words.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Glede Demons were overjoyed.
<br><br>
In just a short time, the Glede Demon race turned the tables against the Red Demon race and gained the upper hand.
<br><br>
Of course, Bacchus was very excited. "Of course! We are never on the same side with the Red Demon race!" he said in a trembling voice.
<br><br>
All the Glede Demons flapped their wings, and the air became filled with vibrations. They were ready to rush down from the sky at any time.
<br><br>
As of now, the Red Demons had to face the attacks from both groups.
<br><br>
Most importantly, those humans still held the Holy Stones in their hands.
<br><br>
They could not believe that they got reduced to a hopeless situation in a short time! Tate's face darkened in anger.
<br><br>
When he saw that the human race and the Glede Demon race were about to fight, he suddenly waved his hand, and an exit appeared at the side of the birdcage. "Let's go!' he shouted.
<br><br>
The fire creatures had bestowed the birdcage to him, and he could control it at will.
<br><br>
The Red Demons had been afraid for a long while, and now that their leader initiated their escape, they would undoubtedly follow.
<br><br>
Under Tate's command, the Red Demons rushed out of the birdcage.
<br><br>
This time, he led over a hundred members of the Red Demon race out.
<br><br>
When Dave and his team had attacked Zen's group, more than ten of them died. Now, more than eighty people were still alive.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those, Bacchus narrowed his eyes. "You want to leave? It won't be easy!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
Then, all the Glede Demons rushed towards the Red Demons below.
<br><br>
In turn, the Red Demons used the black turtles to protect themselves from the Glede Demons' attacks.
<br><br>
The black turtles were a powerful defense weapon. The Glede Demons' wings tried to slice them, but it was hard to break through such a defense in a short time.
<br><br>
At that point, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, King Ieuan, and the others came from the other side and launched an attack.
<br><br>
However, they did not need to kill the Red Demons directly. What they did was to use the Light of Annihilation to remove the black turtles from Red Demons' bodies.
<br><br>
Streaks of the Light of Annihilation fired through the black turtles and dissipated them.
<br><br>
Without the black turtles' protection, the Red Demons were at a disadvantage. As soon as the Glede Demons swooped down again, their sharp wings hacked through the Red Demons' bodies like large sabers.
<br><br>
In a few seconds, the Glede Demons had killed more than twenty Red Demons! The other Red Demons did not dare to keep fighting anymore. They all rushed towards the exit of the birdcage.
<br><br>
But before they got out, the exit of the birdcage suddenly closed.
<br><br>
"Leader?"
<br><br>
"Why did you close it?"
<br><br>
"Let us out! Don't abandon us!"
<br><br>
Only half of the Red Demons that were with Tate had escaped, while there were nearly twenty Red Demons in the birdcage.
<br><br>
They desperately begged their leader to unlock the door. Even the Red Demons outside the birdcage also looked quite hesitant.
<br><br>
After all, they were from the same race, and some of them were even biological brothers.
<br><br>
Tate also hesitated.
<br><br>
But if he did not close the birdcage, then Bacchus and those human beings would have a chance to go out.
<br><br>
In the end, he said in a firm voice, "We will leave first, but we will definitely take revenge!"
<br><br>
Afterward, he led the remaining Red Demons to escape.
<br><br>
The Red Demons in the birdcage fell into despair. They lost the will to fight, and they died without any resistance.
<br><br>
Crack! Bacchus' blade-like wings chopped from top to bottom and split the last Red Demon into two. He wiped the bloodstains on his wings. Then he looked at Zen and asked, "Is there any way to break through this birdcage?"
<br><br>
He was not satisfied with the current result.
<br><br>
If they continued to chase after the Red Demons that escaped, they could kill them and Tate at once.
<br><br>
All the Red Demons led by Tate were the elites of their race. If all of them died now, then the entire Red Demon race would be eliminated from the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Without directly answering Bacchus, Zen reached out his hand and touched the birdcage.
<br><br>
The birdcage had a great space power, and it was not an ordinary Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
If the ancestry-level bloodline in his body could help, then he should not have any problems breaking the birdcage. But the ancestry-level bloodline did not seem to react unless his life was in danger. Thus, he could not count on it.
<br><br>
He looked at the Snake Goddess and the others, only to find that she and Pearson appeared to communicate in secret.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, can the birdcage be destroyed?" he asked.
<br><br>
"I think it can," the Snake Goddess answered with a nod.
<br><br>
"Then break it now!" Bacchus uttered impatiently.
<br><br>
"It needs some time," the Snake Goddess explained.
<br><br>
When he heard those words, Bacchus slightly frowned.
<br><br>
The Red Demons escaped at a fast speed. If they broke the birdcage now, they would still have a chance to catch up with the Red Demons. If they got delayed for a little more, how could they catch up? Now, the Eternal Realm Hunters were very confident that they could break through the birdcage.
<br><br>
The power of space wove the birdcage. As long as Sawyer and Thurston worked together to use the Black Sun and absorb a part of the birdcage, the entire birdcage would collapse.
<br><br>
Pearson wanted to destroy the birdcage directly, but the Snake Goddess stopped him.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons were very powerful on the Night View Island. However, the Red Demon race had defeated them because of the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
Since they did not have the Holy Stones, they could not control the Light of Annihilation. Thus, they would still fail if they fought the Red Demons again.
<br><br>
In conclusion, the Glede Demon race had no choice but to cooperate with Zen and his group.
<br><br>
Bacchus was in a hurry to catch up with the Red Demons not only to kill Tate but also to fight for the Holy Stones in their hands.
<br><br>
Although nearly half of the Red Demons had died, only the remaining alive Red Demons had Holy Stones with them. Bacchus felt disappointed.
<br><br>
"Can you be faster?" he asked impatiently.
<br><br>
Just as the Snake Goddess was about to shake her head, pieces of white hairs fell from not far away.
<br><br>
The appearance of the white-haired monsters could take their time, so she pointed at them to warn the group.
<br><br>
When Bacchus saw them, he sighed in exasperation.
<br><br>
Now that the white-haired monsters were there, they definitely could not chase the Red Demons.
<br><br>
Even if they applied Ghost Powder on their bodies, they would still attract the white-haired monsters when they traveled at night.
<br><br>
Furthermore, after the battle among the three sides, they had shaken off a lot of Ghost Powder, which naturally attracted many white-haired monsters.
<br><br>
As soon as the white-haired monsters appeared, they had to stop all their movements. The Glede Demons, Zen and his group quickly reapplied the Ghost Powder and stayed still.
<br><br>
These white-haired monsters wandered around the Glede Demons and Zen's group, but because of the Ghost Powder's protection, they could not see the humans and Glede Demons. Finally, they walked towards the corpses of the Red Demons.
<br><br>
Those Red Demons just died, so their blood was still a bit fresh. Even their corpses emitted powerful life energy.
<br><br>
The white-haired monsters devoured them. After they finished, they left some Arcana behind and disappeared.
<br><br>
Because Bacchus and the others got delayed for a while, Tate and his group had already gone far. Now, Bacchus was no longer in a hurry.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess and her group wanted to stall for more time.
<br><br>
Therefore, they did not destroy the birdcage so quickly.
<br><br>
Pearson's hands turned into thin threads and pretended to coil them around the birdcage.
<br><br>
Fuxi also condensed marks of Eight Diagrams in different sizes on the birdcage.
<br><br>
After they pretended to be busy for some time, Sawyer and Thurston finally operated the Black Sun.
<br><br>
The Black Sun's strong gravitational force sucked a part of the birdcage into it. The originally square birdcage looked a little distorted, but it still maintained its entire shape.
<br><br>
Then, Sawyer and Thurston separated their hands, and the Black Sun disappeared.
<br><br>
Clatter! It destroyed the balance of space force inside the birdcage with a muffled sound, and then the space birdcage collapsed.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons were surprised when they saw the broken birdcage.
<br><br>
These extremely arrogant Glede Demons had never allied with anyone on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
They had always been quite strong and did not need help from the other races, but now they needed help from these humans.
<br><br>
Chapter 4059 Attack The Amber Cave To the west of the Supreme Pure Realm, the sky glowed an ominous red for several days.
<br><br>
A huge fire cloud floated in the sky day and night, and could be seen clearly from thousands of miles away.
<br><br>
Below this fire cloud was the Amber Cave. People trembled in fear at its name. Amber Cave was the base of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
The Amber Cave was notorious in the Supreme Pure Realm. No one was willing to set foot near it.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization never wanted to near it, either.
<br><br>
The members of the Element Spirit race were composed of energy. If they came into contact with the white mist of the Amber Cave, their energy would be sucked into it till they were exhausted. Once all their energy was drained, they would die.
<br><br>
For the members of the Element Spirit race, this was a tragic way to die.
<br><br>
Legend said there was once a member of the Element Spirit race chasing after a member of the Nihility race. When the former neared the Amber Cave, the white mist gathered to form a huge hand that grabbed the warrior, and the warrior was never to be found since.
<br><br>
Since then, the members of the Element Spirit race never dared approach the Amber Cave again.
<br><br>
But today, the Element Spirit Civilization launched a massive attack on the Amber Cave.
<br><br>
On the ground on one side of the Amber Cave, there was a huge rune. The Holy Wings Armor sat upright in the center of the rune.
<br><br>
Flames were constantly erupting from the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
The flames followed the lines of the rune and gathered at the end, forming a huge swirl of flame, which spiraled towards the sky.
<br><br>
This was how the huge fire cloud was formed.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
The fire cloud in the sky shook violently.
<br><br>
Drops of fire rained down from the fire cloud, falling into the white mist.
<br><br>
The white mist could devour all kinds of energy....
<br><br>
The fire rain had incredible destructive power, but it seemed as though the white mist just swallowed it up with no qualms.
<br><br>
Standing nearby, the Eye Spirit stared at the spectacular scene, blinking occasionally.
<br><br>
Sitting cross-legged beside him, Claire looked bored.
<br><br>
After a while, she yawned. "After so long, the mist in the Amber Cave hasn't weakened, even a bit..."
<br><br>
"The Void Dust's appetite is shocking. It's not easy to satisfy it," replied the Eye Spirit calmly.
<br><br>
It was speculated that a fire cloud that huge should have gathered all the power of all the fire spirits in the entire Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
After several consecutive days of burning, there didn't seem to be any changes to the white mist.
<br><br>
Like what the Eye Spirit mentioned, the white mist was actually Void Dust that spread all over the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
In the Jade Pure Realm, it was colorless and tasteless. If anyone had the misfortune of drifting away from a Pure Sky Platform, they would be quietly devoured by the Void Dust, never to see the light of day again.
<br><br>
When the Void Dust was moved to the Amber Cave, it gained a white color and seemed to have form, although it seemed just like a vapor.
<br><br>
As soon as the Eye Spirit finished speaking, the white mist suddenly surged.
<br><br>
Dozens of misty dragons popped out of the white mist and headed straight for the fire cloud in the sky.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
"They finally got impatient?" A hint of excitement flashed in Claire's eyes.
<br><br>
These mist dragons soared into the sky and went straight for the fire cloud, trying to wipe it out.
<br><br>
"It's not that they got impatient," said the Eye Spirit calmly.
<br><br>
"Don't they just want to put out the fire cloud?" asked Claire.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit smiled faintly and chuckled. "The source of the fire cloud is here, but they head for the fire cloud. Why is that?"
<br><br>
"They plan to take us by surprise?"
<br><br>
"Yes!"
<br><br>
Just then, the mist formed a huge hand that extended towards them from the Amber Cave. In one sweeping motion, the giant hand slapped the area where the Eye Spirit and his companions were.
<br><br>
The power contained in this slap was enough to squash them into nothingness, leaving only a deep palm print on the ground.
<br><br>
Something similar had happened before, leaving a giant print in the shape of a hand on the ground. Over time, it filled with water, forming a lake, which was then named the Five Fingers Lake by the creatures in the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit had expected the counterattack from the Amber Cave.
<br><br>
He blinked, and suddenly the space was dislocated.
<br><br>
From the position where he and Clare stood to the place of the rune that was burning with flames, the space had moved backward five thousand feet.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss...
<br><br>
There was no shocking impact or sound when the huge foggy hand slapped down.
<br><br>
It sank into the ground silently and devoured everything along the way without a sound.
<br><br>
After leaving a huge palm print on the ground, the white mist quickly flowed back into the Amber Cave.
<br><br>
When the white mist retreated, the Eye Spirit blinked again, and the space returned to where it had originally been.
<br><br>
Because the foundation below had been devoured by the Void Dust, the Eye Spirit, Claire, and the Holy Wings Armor looked as if they were standing on a cubic stone.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle...
<br><br>
By now, the mist dragons had devoured half of the fire cloud. However, with a flash of light on the surface of the Holy Wings Armor, flame began to flow onto the huge rune once again. The swirl of flames also quickly blew up, sending more and more flames into the fire cloud.
<br><br>
The only purpose of the Element Spirit Civilization was to drain their enemy.
<br><br>
The Void Dust could indeed devour everything, but it was impossible to devour things infinitely.
<br><br>
Even if the Void Dust had a shocking appetite, there would come a time when it would be satisfied.
<br><br>
In fact, the Eye Spirit had been waiting for the counterattack of the Nihility race this whole time.
<br><br>
If the members of the Nihility race hadn't made any movement, and they were not afraid of the rain of fire that constantly came down, they didn't need to do anything at all. All they needed to do was to stay within the Amber Cave.
<br><br>
Anyway, the Element Spirit Civilization wouldn't be able to break in.
<br><br>
However, the Nihility race fought back, and in turn, it proved that the Eye Spirit's guess was right: the Void Dust's appetite was slowly being satiated! If the fire rain continued to burn, sooner or later, the Void Dust would become full.
<br><br>
"Let the thunder spirits join the fight!" the Eye Spirit ordered.
<br><br>
"Yes, sir," replied Gavyn from within the armor.
<br><br>
Soon after, streaks of lightning began to circulate the rune. Ominous crackling noises could be heard constantly from the edge of the fire cloud above, and then the fire cloud was enveloped in flashes of lightning.
<br><br>
Just as the Element Spirit Civilization launched a more aggressive attack, a ball of flame suddenly shot out in the distance.
<br><br>
It was getting closer and closer.
<br><br>
Claire squinted at it and said, "It's the avatar of Sanderson."
<br><br>
After the three stone statues in the underground cave were destroyed, the Eye Spirit had sent three fire spirits there.
<br><br>
Sizzle...
<br><br>
Sanderson's avatar came to the Eye Spirit's side and reported to him, "The passageway to the Night View Island has been repaired."
<br><br>
All the eyes of the Eye Spirit sparkled with excitement.
<br><br>
Claire raised her eyebrows and smiled devilishly. "Your hunch is right," she said to the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit did not respond. He was awakening an eye on his body.
<br><br>
A white film was attached to the surface of the eyeball. After the eye woke up, the white film began to quickly peel off, turning into a small white snake.
<br><br>
The little white snake glanced at the Amber Cave and scolded the Eye Spirit, "Are you stupid or something? After all this time, you still haven't taken down the Amber Cave! Our plan regarding the Ten Directions House has been delayed for several days!"
<br><br>
Claire's expression darkened and she trembled slightly.
<br><br>
In the eyes of all the members of the Element Spirit race, the Eye Spirit was a supreme existence. Being scolded by this small white snake made Claire, who was loyal to the Eye Spirit, feel very uncomfortable.
<br><br>
But she also knew that everything in the Element Spirit Civilization was bestowed by them.
<br><br>
Whether it was the Holy Wings Armor, the Treacherous Beings they had merged with, or even the rise of the Element Spirit Civilization were all due to them.
<br><br>
When the Eye Spirit told her that these snakes hiding in the depths of the Jade Pure Realm were the foundation of the Element Spirit Civilization, she was too shocked to even speak.
<br><br>
Chapter 4060 Snake Master Most of the time, the members of the Element Spirit race had no concept of individuality.
<br><br>
For the most part, they worked as a collective and were indistinct from each other.
<br><br>
However, when an element's life expanded to a certain extent, it inevitably formed a unique individual. Otherwise, their strength would become stagnant and stop growing.
<br><br>
In the past, the Eye Spirit had informed Claire that he was actually composed of countless members of the Element Spirit race and was infused with an independent consciousness.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit had been created by those snakes on the Jade Pure Realm, while the subsequent members of the Element Spirit race had been formed directly or indirectly by the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Eye Spirit formed the foundation of the Element Spirit Civilization, while the snakes were the foundation of the Eye Spirit! For a long time, even the Eye Spirit had been unaware of the existence of those snakes...
<br><br>
Under the leadership of the Eye Spirit, the Element Spirit Civilization had flourished. They continued to explore the upper stages, the Three Purities Stage, and the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
They had earned the strongest Other Shore Tokens and even captured many creatures from beyond the Abstruse Energy World! The strange world made up of light dots had proven difficult to understand, but the mystery about it made it all the more fascinating.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the members of the Element Spirit race had natural inhibitions, so it was difficult for them to explore it to the furthest reaches.
<br><br>
Over the past one thousand chaotic eras or more, warriors rose—one after another—to challenge them, and they were each eliminated by the Element Spirit Civilization. Except for the strongest of their opponents, the human race who had been forced to escape into the Night View Island, almost all other civilizations had been defeated by them.
<br><br>
They had remained the absolute and dominating authority until the Nihility race had appeared.
<br><br>
Before the appearance of the Nihility race, the Treacherous Beings had also begun making inroads into the Jade Pure Realm, and an unprecedented chaotic battle had even erupted within the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
In the Element Spirit race, none but the Eye Spirit had participated in the chaotic battle.
<br><br>
Later, he returned to the Jade Pure Realm, together with the white snake, but the snake commanded a force more powerful than anyone could have imagined.
<br><br>
Claire was confused when she heard the Eye Spirit's revelation.
<br><br>
How could such a powerful force have been hidden in the Jade Pure Realm for so many years without anyone noticing? She later discovered that this powerful force had long been annihilated, and the last remnants of it were now living in the form of Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
In essence, once this force appeared, the Element Spirit Civilization would reinforce their control over the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Who would have thought that a bird in the Jade Pure Realm would support the Grandmaster of Heaven, who in turn led the members of the Nihility race to battle the Element Spirit Civilization even now? At the little white snake's reproachful words, the Eye Spirit's emotions remained unfazed. He only calmly replied, "The Void Dust has a huge appetite. I'm afraid it will take much longer time. I wonder if you have a better suggestion, Snake Master."
<br><br>
"Give up now," the Snake Master said.
<br><br>
As soon as these words were spoken, both Claire and the Eye Spirit were stunned.
<br><br>
That Godly Way was of the utmost importance.
<br><br>
And they were just quitting so easily? "Why?" Claire couldn't help asking for clarification.
<br><br>
The Snake Master suddenly raised his head, and his eyes shone with a green light.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Claire felt as if her brain had been struck by a sledge hammer, and her face contorted in pain.
<br><br>
The intense pain rendered her unable to maintain her form. Cracks appeared all over her body. With a snapped fizzle and several sparks, she transformed into a ball of flames, revealing her original form.
<br><br>
"You have no right to question me," the Snake Master said coldly.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh… The flames simmered down, and then reconstructed a white skin and body, and Claire resumed her old appearance.
<br><br>
She swallowed the pain and knelt down to the Snake Master.
<br><br>
A trace of anger lingered in the Eye Spirit's eyes, but he made no comment.
<br><br>
He had carefully concealed his anger deep inside.
<br><br>
The Snake Master had a dominating aura.
<br><br>
The twin creatures and the fury flame, formerly cultivated by the Eye Spirit, were all killed by the Snake Master because of a single sentence.
<br><br>
Les had almost died at the hands of the Snake Master. Although he had released Les because the Eye Spirit had begged him to spare his life, the Snake Master had banned Les from merging with any Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
He even refused to tell him the method for using the Holy Stones.
<br><br>
"Why?" the Eye Spirit repeated Claire's question.
<br><br>
"The Night View Island is very important," the Snake Master replied.
<br><br>
"Because of the hatred-level Treacherous Beings dwelling in the Ghost Mountain?" the Eye Spirit once again questioned.
<br><br>
To his knowledge, there were hatred-level Treacherous Beings in existence in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
"Hatred-level Treacherous Beings..." The Snake Master sneered, "They are an insignificant concern!"
<br><br>
"Then it is to kill those humans?" the Eye Spirit continued asking.
<br><br>
"Humans?" The Snake Master sneered with more contempt, "They are hardly even worth mentioning!"
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit gave up questioning then.
<br><br>
Although he had already discovered some secrets concerning the existence of the Four Spirits Sect through the Snake Master, he was unclear about the grudges involved. After all, these were things that had happened beyond the chaos.
<br><br>
"Do you recall the wolf teeth I gave you?" the Snake Master asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, I do!" His eyes gleamed.
<br><br>
Those were very special.
<br><br>
There was a sum of ten wolf teeth.
<br><br>
Each of them radiated a complex and powerful bloodline aura.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit had speculated often that these wolf teeth had to be really powerful treasures. The bloodline power of each wolf tooth could be directly used and freely altered.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, when the Snake Master had given these wolf teeth to the Eye Spirit, they had been seriously damaged.
<br><br>
The surface of these teeth was marred and covered with thin cracks as if the wolf teeth were close to shattering should he exert any pressure on them.
<br><br>
The bloodline power within the wolf teeth had eventually dissipated, leaving only a faint aura… The Snake Master revealed nothing of the origins and uses of these wolf teeth, but he had asked him to keep them safe.
<br><br>
At the Snake Master's sudden mention of them, the Eye Spirit was naturally interested.
<br><br>
"Take the wolf teeth to the Ghost Mountain. You must find a way to wake him up," the Snake Master instructed.
<br><br>
"Whom are you speaking of?"
<br><br>
"Orlando.
<br><br>
One of the four leaders of the Four Spirits Sect! The Monkey Spirit King!"
<br><br>
When the Eye Spirit heard this, the spirals in his eyeballs rotated crazily.
<br><br>
The shock to his heart instantly reflected on the surface of his pupils.
<br><br>
Anyone who looked into his eyes could see the violent shock in his heart.
<br><br>
Claire glanced at the Eye Spirit and was also surprised.
<br><br>
Who was this Monkey Spirit King that the Snake Master was talking about… How could he have shocked the Eye Spirit so severely? The Snake Master had shared many secrets with the Eye Spirit, though he did not allow the Eye Spirit to share these. Even Claire, who was closest to him, remained uniformed concerning these secrets.
<br><br>
Of course, she didn't know what this Monkey Spirit King was...
<br><br>
"These wolf teeth are his obsession. Relinquish them to him, and then I will appear," the Snake Master said.
<br><br>
"Yes, sir!"
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, the Eye Spirit ordered Gavyn to remove the rune.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
As the Eye Spirit's pupils slightly enlarged, the cubic space enveloping this area vanished.
<br><br>
The ground marked off by the cubic space fell into the big hole eroded by the mist hand.
<br><br>
The Holy Wings Armor, Claire, and Eye Spirit flew northeast, while the Snake Master remained behind.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss… The Snake Master wriggled his white body and slithered to the entrance of the Amber Cave.
<br><br>
The light in his eyes flashed slightly, and two rays of orange light beamed into the white mist formed by the Void Dust.
<br><br>
The white mist could devour any substance and even energy, and by all logical sense, it should consume the orange rays of light.
<br><br>
However, the orange rays of light remained unaffected. Instead, they stirred the white mist, which then roiled and suddenly burst forth with a series of obscure and rhythmic songs. It was Sanskrit.
<br><br>
"You stupid birds proclaimed yourselves as destroyers. You are clueless to cause or effect, therefore, you will definitely lose!"
<br><br>
Chapter 4061 The Obsession Of Birds "Purr..."
<br><br>
The white mist billowed ominously.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a humanoid figure emerged from the white mist.
<br><br>
It had long curly hair and a handsome face. It was Maynard, one of the personal disciples of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"What are you talking about? I don't understand," he said with a wild smile.
<br><br>
The Snake Master sneered. In his eyes, the Element Spirit Civilization was like dregs. How much more these humans? "Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Buzz! The little white snake's eyes glowed a fierce green again.
<br><br>
"So scary!"
<br><br>
Maynard mocked as he ducked into the white mist.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! A large amount of white mist that was formed from the Void Dust turned into green powder and fell into the Amber Cave.
<br><br>
The green radiance the Snake Master could shoot from his eyes contained immeasurable power. It was able to destroy the Void Dust.
<br><br>
Just then, the Grandmaster of Heaven emerged from the Void Dust.
<br><br>
"You go to hell too!"
<br><br>
The little white snake's eyes glowed green once more, as he aimed at the head of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
However, the Grandmaster of Heaven calmly raised one hand. Before the green radiance reached him, a hand emerged from the mist just in time to block the attack.
<br><br>
"Calm down," the Grandmaster of Heaven said with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
Then, he took out a thin, sharp tooth and abruptly sliced off one of his hands.
<br><br>
Not a drop of blood was shed, even though he severed his arm! The broken part quickly healed, and the bones and skin of the hand began to morph. Soon, the broken hand transformed into the shape of a bird.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The bird flapped his wings urgently as he flew towards the shore.
<br><br>
As he flew, the bird let out a series of rhythmic chirps, speaking in Sanskrit.
<br><br>
"Four hundred chaotic eras ago, you didn't even pay us any heed. Now you threaten us?" the bird taunted.
<br><br>
The Snake Master squinted at the bird in the sky. "You are the stupidest in the world!" he shouted angrily. "That stupid bird's obsession is meaningless.
<br><br>
Why do you still follow him?"
<br><br>
Just like what the bird said, the Snake Masters didn't take the birds seriously in the beginning.
<br><br>
Over several hundred chaotic eras, they went about their own business as the birds evolved and grew in strength. Later, the birds chose to support the Nihility race, which was not weaker than the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The Snake Masters were still considered quite powerful in the Jade Pure Realm. In fact, they could even be considered the mainstay of the Four Spirits Sect. This was because, in addition to the Snake Spirit Sect, they also had the Human Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect under their control.
<br><br>
They represented the orthodox of the Four Spirits Sect. They were also looked up to as somewhat of guardian angels to the sects under them, and also the sole hope for them to stay in this tiny place.
<br><br>
However, all the birds practically worshiped the one stupid bird that could never wake up. The birds had evolved so much that they were strong enough to set an imbalance to the norm.
<br><br>
The bird flapped his wings hurriedly, as though he was struggling to stay that high in the air.
<br><br>
He looked down coldly at the Snake Master below. "Our master's obsession is what makes our lives meaningful. You can question us underlings, but don't you dare insult our master!"
<br><br>
"Stupid bird! He's the stupidest leader of the Four Spirits Sect!"
<br><br>
The Snake Master's curse infuriated the bird. Narrowing his beady little eyes at the Snake Master below, he said, "You aren't afraid of death.
<br><br>
Instead, you are afraid of staying alive! If you dare insult our sect leader again, we will make sure you live forever!"
<br><br>
The threat hit home.
<br><br>
The little white snake shut up immediately, his thin lips trembling slightly.
<br><br>
He was a Treacherous Being, after all.
<br><br>
In a secondary world such as the chaos, he was immortal.
<br><br>
If he died, he would simply come back to life at a specific spot.
<br><br>
For example, the coordinates of the world builders were on the Whining Road. No matter where they were killed, they would be reborn on the Whining Road, because the Treacherous Beings' coordinates were set there.
<br><br>
The Snake Master was the representative of the Snake Spirit Sect. He was responsible for communicating with the Element Spirit Civilization. He had two revival coordinates: one in the Jade Pure Realm, and the other in the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
If he wanted to move freely between the two coordinates, he only needed to die.
<br><br>
If the bird was able to catch and imprison the Snake Master to make him always alive, this would prove very troublesome.
<br><br>
The communication channel between the Element Spirit Civilization and the Snake Masters would be temporarily cut off, which was something he couldn't risk.
<br><br>
But it was not easy to capture the Snake Master.
<br><br>
The bird's words managed to shut the irascible snake master up. As the Snake Master realized that he was in a dangerous situation, he suddenly twisted his body into a white light and rushed into the Amber Cave.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! The sickening sound of burning flesh rang through the Amber Cave as the little white snake resigned himself to the Void Dust. The Void Dust could erode everything, including the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, the little white snake was completely devoured without a trace.
<br><br>
The bird, after witnessing what just happened, swerved and flew back to the Grandmaster of Heaven in the mist.
<br><br>
"What if you really kept the Snake Master here just now?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked playfully.
<br><br>
The bird thought for a while and said, "He still would've found a way to end his own life, but it might've taken longer."
<br><br>
"Right..." the Grandmaster of Heaven muttered as his eyes flashed. "He behaved a little strangely just now, don't you think?"
<br><br>
It was not the first time that the Grandmaster of Heaven had come into contact with this irascible Snake Master.
<br><br>
Among the many Snake Masters, this one was the most aggressive.
<br><br>
It was uncharacteristic of him to run away from conflict. Just now, the bird just threatened him, but he quickly decided to kill himself.
<br><br>
It was likely that this Snake Master had a very important task to fulfill.
<br><br>
The bird knew what the Grandmaster of Heaven was thinking. "The battle in the Jade Pure Realm is very fierce. I'm afraid they will soon occupy the Mist City again. So, he must've been in a hurry to go back."
<br><br>
"They must have lost miserably in the battle of the Wine Basin. I'm afraid they won't make a concession this time," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, scratching his chin.
<br><br>
"Right," the bird said. "We need to hurry. Destroy your body and hatch the third egg."
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit Sect had given the Grandmaster of Heaven three bodies, each one stronger than the last.
<br><br>
The first body was killed by Zen, so that was out of the picture already.
<br><br>
The second body should've been able to last longer.
<br><br>
However, things went much faster than the birds had expected. They wanted to give the Grandmaster of Heaven more power, so they had to destroy the second body and use the third one.
<br><br>
"Then, let's start now." The Grandmaster of Heaven nodded and gave a few orders to Maynard before taking action.
<br><br>
While the plan was in motion, Maynard was tasked with guarding the Amber Cave.
<br><br>
After giving instructions to Maynard, the Grandmaster of Heaven willingly submitted himself to the Void Dust.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Once more, the sickening sizzling sound of melting flesh rang throughout the Amber Cave as the Grandmaster of Heaven's body melted as the mist devoured his flesh.
<br><br>
The Void Dust was actually a convenient tool to take one's life, if need be.
<br><br>
This was why both the Snake Master just now and the Grandmaster of Heaven submitted themselves to it.
<br><br>
The bird then started to flap his wings and he flew through the white mist.
<br><br>
He didn't stop flying until he had reached the deepest part of the Amber Cave, where he landed on a huge egg.
<br><br>
Standing on the egg, he bent over and gently pecked at the egg with his orange, fluffy beak.
<br><br>
Tiny and complex hairline cracks began to appear on the surface of the egg, and a powerful aura of life began to emanate from it.
<br><br>
As the egg began to hatch, the bird watched. There was a hint of helplessness in his small, beady eyes.
<br><br>
He knew that the Nihility Way was a path of no return.
<br><br>
But this was the only way, according to their sect leader.
<br><br>
Every bird in the Bird Spirit Sect was extremely loyal and would never betray their sect, even if it meant flying straight to their death.
<br><br>
In a sense, they were trying to realize their sect leader's "last wish", but at what cost? Chapter 4062 The Mist City The white mist gradually spread throughout the Mist City on the main Pure Sky Platform, striking terror in the hearts of those who were there.
<br><br>
A few of the more powerful beings took away a small part of the white mist through their own methods.
<br><br>
More white mist turned into the streets, towers, walls, and grounds in this city.
<br><br>
From the outside, nothing looked out of the ordinary. However, the streets, towers, walls, and even the grounds would turn into monsters that would devour the creatures at any time.
<br><br>
On one of the broad streets within the city, a snow-white snake wriggled his body, slithering at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
From the other side of the street, three birds spread their wings and launched themselves into the air.
<br><br>
"Friends..."
<br><br>
The snake sang wistfully.
<br><br>
The song sounded like a cry of grief, a call to his companions.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The snake's singing caught the attention of the three birds, who then swerved in the air to fly towards the little white snake.
<br><br>
Their beady eyes dilated in a craze as they ferociously pecked at the body of the white snake.
<br><br>
As they attacked him, they released more and more intense energy, until their bodies turned red.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! The three birds had worked themselves up into such a frenzy that they exploded violently, one after the other. The explosion caused a terrible shock wave that rippled across the city.
<br><br>
Everything in this city was made of white mist.
<br><br>
As the shock wave shook everything, the structures momentarily lost their forms and turned into white mist.
<br><br>
However, the hapless structures only lasted a while. After a few moments, they returned to their original shapes.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the white snake's body was left in pieces by the explosion. As a Treacherous Being, he could have turned into various shapes, but the three birds released a considerable amount of Light of Annihilation when they exploded.
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation was fatal to the hostility-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
As for the resentment-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings, their bodies would change dramatically if they were hit by the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
The resentment-level Treacherous Beings would permanently lose the ability to change into different forms. As a result, their bodies would also become very fragile, making them easy targets.
<br><br>
The white snake, with only half of his body left, could not return to his original shape. Coughing painfully, he leaned against a corner of the wall weakly.
<br><br>
In the Mist City, one's only hope to survive was by constantly walking.
<br><br>
The white snake could no longer move. He could only sit back and watch as the wall behind him softened and slowly turned into white mist.
<br><br>
However, he was not too scared.
<br><br>
In the secondary world, Treacherous Beings were immortal.
<br><br>
If he were to be devoured by the white mist here and now, he was bound to be revived somewhere in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
At this point, Treacherous Beings in the Jade Pure Realm could no longer remember how many times they had been killed and revived.
<br><br>
Almost every one of the Treacherous Beings that had awakened had experienced over a thousand cycles of reincarnation and death.
<br><br>
In the beginning, they found this very exciting.
<br><br>
However, as time went by, they grew bored as the cycle began to feel repetitive.
<br><br>
For example, they had captured the Mist City hundreds of times.
<br><br>
In order to consolidate the city, they set their revival coordinates here right after capturing it, but in the end, they were all killed, and even their coordinates were removed.
<br><br>
However, this didn't stop them from capturing the Mist City repeatedly over time.
<br><br>
This kind of behavior became extremely ridiculous and boring as it was an endless cycle.
<br><br>
Wasn't it just a city that contained the Void Dust? What if they obtained a portion of the Void Dust that could be controlled? Could it determine the victory of this war? Unfortunately, although these awakened Treacherous Beings had their own self consciousness, they worked for the Four Spirits Sect. They could only follow the orders of the senior leaders of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Complaining would solve nothing.
<br><br>
The same thing happened in other areas in the Mist City.
<br><br>
At first, the white snakes could only hide in the north of the Mist City. If they attempted to cross the center line of the city, the birds would instantly eliminate them.
<br><br>
Now, as more and more snakes were swarming into the Mist City, the snakes felt emboldened. They began to spread to other areas in the city.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, several black eagles stood perched on a gate tower in the south of the Mist City.
<br><br>
The gate tower was also made of white mist.
<br><br>
As aforementioned, all creatures that came into contact with the white mist were doomed to be devoured. Those black eagles were no exception.
<br><br>
However, every time the gate tower began to twist and deform into white mist, the black eagles would flap their wings and hover above the gate tower.
<br><br>
Then, when the gate tower returned to its original shape, the eagles would land on it once more.
<br><br>
"The battle is coming to an end," the black eagle at the far right commented.
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit Sect once had four branches. These black eagles came from one of them.
<br><br>
"It's not a big deal if we lose the Mist City," the black eagle in the lead said coldly. "We can always take it back later."
<br><br>
The black eagle that had just spoken had three purple luminescent feathers on his head that shone beautifully. He was the leader of this branch.
<br><br>
"But if we give up the Mist City, we will also have to give up all the spoils we got in the battle of the Wine Basin," a black figure pointed out.
<br><br>
The leader's eyes dimmed gloomily. "They have lost once in the battle of the Wine Basin. Even if they make a comeback now, they will still be defeated in the end. Don't worry."
<br><br>
Just as the leader was speaking, a bird flew over.
<br><br>
The bird whispered something to them, while they listened attentively.
<br><br>
After a short while, their originally gloomy eyes lit up with excitement.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"They have retreated?"
<br><br>
"They have left the Mist City?"
<br><br>
The black eagles couldn't believe their ears! The Snake Masters were so close to capturing the Mist City. The eagles led their team to fight them off, but they were just beginning to feel like it was futile.
<br><br>
Now, they received news that the Snake Masters were retreating. Such good luck! "Is it a trap?" the leader asked suspiciously.
<br><br>
"The Mist City can devour everything left behind. It's impossible for them to set up traps in the city. Once they leave, it's back to square one for them,"
<br><br>
a black eagle answered reassuringly with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
"You're right. Even if they try to play tricks, it wouldn't work. They've given up the Mist City!" another black eagle agreed.
<br><br>
"Let the birds inspect the entire Mist City," the leader ordered.
<br><br>
Soon, thousands of birds spread their wings and flew across the Mist City, carefully inspecting each street.
<br><br>
But they didn't find anything suspicious.
<br><br>
After they reported what they saw, the leader heaved a sigh of relief. By now, he was sure the Snake Masters had retreated.
<br><br>
The other black eagles scratched their heads, confused as to why the Snake Masters had given up even though they were so close to victory. Sheepishly, they all turned to their leader, who stood perched in the center.
<br><br>
The leader's eyes still couldn't shake off the feeling of suspicion. Uneasy, he helplessly returned the gazes of his constituents. It was just too strange! If the Snake Masters ended up taking the Mist City, the leader would've felt less unsettled.
<br><br>
But they had given up. This could only mean one thing: there was something more important to them than the Mist City.
<br><br>
The leader frowned deeply as he pondered over this. If the Snake Masters captured the Mist City, they could take back the Wine Basin. What could possibly be more important than that? "I'm going to visit someone. I should be able to get an answer there."
<br><br>
After saying that, the leader flapped his wings and flew away.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Source World, several black ships were floating in a clear lake in the Roaring Lake Province.
<br><br>
The water of the lake was so clear that it was almost mirror-like.
<br><br>
During the battle against the Pear Hill, the Black Ship suffered great losses, but not as heavy as those of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
Most of their crew survived.
<br><br>
But when the Evil God was appointed as the new captain, the crew was enraged.
<br><br>
Since then, they made all kinds of excuses to try to escape from the Black Ship.
<br><br>
According to the rules of the Black Ship, those who escaped would be regarded as traitors and would be chased down by the Black Ship.
<br><br>
But the former captain had never treated them like this. The former captain let them leave if they wanted to. Now, the Black Ship didn't carry any of the old traditions, just their name.
<br><br>
Chapter 4063 Studying The Evil God had become the captain but he didn't care about the members of the Black Ship departing.
<br><br>
Finally, there were only two people left in the Black Ship.
<br><br>
One was the former captain of the Black Ship, and the other was Shera.
<br><br>
Shera opened the door of the cabin, her gaze falling on the Evil God, who was sitting at the stern. She walked over to him with a smile on her face.
<br><br>
She wrapped her pale, slender arms around the Evil God's neck. "I have brought you a gift from the Other Shore."
<br><br>
"Let me have a look," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
Shera began to take out the Other Shore Token, which was in the form of an exquisite pot.
<br><br>
This was a good Other Shore Token, but it wasn't suited to Shera.
<br><br>
"What's the use of this Other Shore Token?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
Nobody could figure out the functions of many Other Shore Tokens in a single glance. But those with a rich experience could tell the functions according to the aura.
<br><br>
A few Other Shore Tokens of the mysterious type had uniquely powerful abilities, while some Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type emitted a formidable power.
<br><br>
"It is used to store things," Shera replied.
<br><br>
It was now the Evil God's turn to be surprised.
<br><br>
"Is it really just a pot?" the Evil God asked, his eyebrows raising.
<br><br>
"Yes," said Shera, smiling in amusement.
<br><br>
The pot was strictly a spatial Other Shore Token, but it wasn't considered to be powerful.
<br><br>
Shera had obtained and kept the pot just to help the Grandmaster of Heaven transmit what was within it. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for her to fuse with this Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"What's in the pot?" the Evil God asked again.
<br><br>
Shera opened the mouth of the pot, and a pale yellow energy emerged from it.
<br><br>
The Evil God observed the pale yellow energy, his eyes widening with every second. "The Godly Way energy?" he exclaimed in disbelief.
<br><br>
He was sensitive to the Godly Way energy and could, in a matter of seconds, tell that this pale yellow energy was the Godly Way energy.
<br><br>
"Yes, it's the energy of the Godly Way that was isolated from the others by the Element Spirit Civilization. It doesn't have a name yet. You can give it one," Shera suggested.
<br><br>
"I'm not interested."
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes were fixed on the Godly Way energy that was floating in the air. He took a deep breath, causing the Godly Way energy to enter his body through his nose. He then pushed Shera away.
<br><br>
"I'm going to cultivate in seclusion. Don't disturb me during this time," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
Shera looked displeased, but she held herself back as she said, "The Grandmaster of Heaven also asked me to pass on a message to you."
<br><br>
"What is it?" the Evil God said impatiently.
<br><br>
Neither Shera nor the previous captain was worth a mention, according to the Evil God.
<br><br>
But the Grandmaster of Heaven was still useful to him.
<br><br>
"After fusing with this Godly Way, drive the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race out of the Source World," Shera said.
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes narrowed. "Is that an order or a request?"
<br><br>
Shera was silent for a moment. "It is a request."
<br><br>
"Okay."
<br><br>
Shera turned and left, sighing inwardly as she returned to her cabin.
<br><br>
The former captain's calm face appeared on an old board in the cabin.
<br><br>
"You should have expected this from the first day, right?" the captain said.
<br><br>
Shera shook her head. "No."
<br><br>
"There's no need to lie to yourself. The Grandmaster of Heaven, his disciples, you, and me-all of us knew this." The captain looked up at the deck and added, "The Evil God himself knows it too."
<br><br>
It was true. The Evil God didn't have any feelings or emotions. He would be patient only when he found something that would be useful to him.
<br><br>
In fact, the Evil God was not interested in being the captain of the Black Ship. The reason why he had stayed in the Black Ship was because of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"But we need him more. He is almost a perfect man," the captain said. "We will try our best to help him and even sacrifice ourselves if need be."
<br><br>
The Black Ship was a force that was supported by the Nihility race in the chaos, and the Evil God was their hope.
<br><br>
The Evil God had become happy when he had obtained the last Godly Way.
<br><br>
The moment Shera left, his figure disappeared in a flash and appeared in a cabin on the black ship.
<br><br>
He looked up at the wall from where a pair of eyes was staring at him.
<br><br>
"Go on. Gaze at me if that's what you like!"
<br><br>
he sneered, laughing disdainfully.
<br><br>
He knew that the former captain was observing him all the time.
<br><br>
And then, wisps of Godly Way energy surged out and began to gather together.
<br><br>
The three thousand Godly Ways began to merge, one after the other. It was obviously difficult for them to not reject each other and to arrange themselves in a regular, stable manner.
<br><br>
But the energy of these Godly Ways seemed to have souls, coming to life in the hands of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Every Godly Way could quickly find a suitable object to fuse with.
<br><br>
The Evil God had practiced this fusion process a number of times before.
<br><br>
Every extra energy was a test to the Evil God. When the 3, 001st Godly Way had merged with the others last time, it had brought great difficulty upon the Evil God.
<br><br>
And now, fusing the last Godly Way was a new challenge for the Evil God.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
A colorful ball of energy floated before him.
<br><br>
The 3, 001 Godly Ways formed this energy ball. The energy of all the Godly Ways clung to each other and connected together, forming a subtle balance that allowed them to float.
<br><br>
If any Godly Way was added to or removed from this, the balance would be broken and the ball would instantly collapse.
<br><br>
The Evil God observed the ball carefully, trying to find a gap in it. But he had spent a lot of effort to fuse the 3, 001 Godly Ways. How could there be a gap in the ball of the Ways-blending Energy? He thought for a long time.
<br><br>
A thought seemed to suddenly occur to him and he pulled out a Godly Way from the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
The Evil God had drawn out the Five Elements Godly Way.
<br><br>
As the most extensive and common Godly Way, the Five Elements Godly Way was the foundation of the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Once the Five Elements Godly Way was extracted, the entire Waysblending Energy would have to be reconstructed.
<br><br>
The Evil God had incomparable talent in terms of the Ways-blending Energy. He could come to a conclusion and make a judgment only after he observed this ball for a while.
<br><br>
He knew he must do that! After he had extracted the Five Elements Godly Way, the 3, 000 Godly Ways were pushed into disorder, and a strong aura of energy began to spread out.
<br><br>
Seeing that the Ways-blending Energy was about to explode, the Evil God reached out a hand and began to extract the energy. The Godly Way energy turned into thin threads and wove together continuously. In the end, the Evil God had forcefully covered the aura of the energy.
<br><br>
The former captain watched the scene from the wall.
<br><br>
He couldn't help but sigh.
<br><br>
This kind of talent and method of controlling energy was terrifyingly powerful. The experienced captain was forced to look on in admiration.
<br><br>
Once the Evil God had stabilized the Ways-blending Energy, he put the Five Elements Godly Way back again.
<br><br>
From its appearance, there was no change in the Ways-blending Energy, but the overall structure had, in fact, undergone a tremendous change.
<br><br>
And now, there was a gap in the ball.
<br><br>
This gap was left for the energy of the last Godly Way.
<br><br>
Buzz! The Evil God once again released the Godly Way energy and slowly inserted it into the gap.
<br><br>
The Godly Way energy and the Ways-blending Energy were now almost perfectly matched.
<br><br>
The Evil God had just begun to smile when the Ways-blending Energy suddenly turned into a snow-white ball.
<br><br>
The light ball covered the ship with the light in the blink of an eye and began to flash on the surface of the lake.
<br><br>
The ball's light was so brilliant that the whole world seemed dark as night before it.
<br><br>
Chapter 4064 The Second Insurance In the north of the Jade Pure Realm, an enormous brown cubic rock stood on the ground.
<br><br>
This cubic rock was 99, 000 feet long, 99, 000 feet wide, and 99, 000 feet high.
<br><br>
On its surface, an exit opened for every thirty feet in the span of its entire height.
<br><br>
Its inside was hollow, giving way to many intricate caves and passages.
<br><br>
This place was called the Heavenly Square City, and it was one of the headquarters of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
In a room on the upper left part of the Heavenly Square City was a wounded man dressed in cotton clothes.
<br><br>
His hands and feet were tightly tied by four iron chains, pulling his limbs straight.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! A white whip thrashed violently in the air and lashed hard at the man, landing on his already frail body.
<br><br>
Clap! As the white whip hit him, it emitted a beaming ray of silver-white light, which was the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
The man in cotton clothes was a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
It was difficult for ordinary punishment methods to damage a Treacherous Being. However, if they were hit by the Light of Annihilation, they would feel pain as when ordinary mortals were stabbed by thorns.
<br><br>
This was the case for only the resentment-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Once the hostility-level Treacherous Beings came into contact with the Light of Annihilation, they would instantly turn into fine gray ashes.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! The man's clothes were torn and stained with blood as he had suffered many beatings for several days.
<br><br>
The one who smacked the whip was a human woman. With each hit, she reprimanded the man solemnly, "Do you understand the gravity of your crime, Alphonse?"
<br><br>
Clap! "Do you understand the gravity of your crime, Alphonse?"
<br><br>
Clap! "Do you understand the gravity of your crime, Alphonse?!"
<br><br>
The man's name was Alphonse Shen. He was the chief of the Joy House, which was affiliated to the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The woman, on the other hand, was a subordinate of the Joy House.
<br><br>
Despite the stern expression on her face, she enjoyed no pleasure from the abuse. Her eyes revealed the pity she felt.
<br><br>
The Joy House was responsible for guarding the Treasure Bottle Platform to protect the Godly Way energy.
<br><br>
Things had been fine in the past chaotic eras. Unfortunately, the Godly Way energy was stolen by the Nihility race some days ago.
<br><br>
As the chief of the Joy House, Alphonse had to take responsibility for an unforgivable mistake.
<br><br>
Clap! The woman had whipped him day and night.
<br><br>
She feared that if she continued to hit him with the Light of Annihilation, he might get beaten to death.
<br><br>
Without saying a word, Alphonse silently endured the torment.
<br><br>
A voice suddenly spoke from outside the room.
<br><br>
"General Alphonse, how have you been doing these days?"
<br><br>
the voice asked with a hint of mockery.
<br><br>
When the woman heard the voice, she frowned and whipped more forcefully.
<br><br>
If she was seen with favoritism to the chief, he would only receive greater blame and suffering.
<br><br>
A person came into the room and motioned her to stop beating. She then paused, carefully retracted the whip, and stepped aside.
<br><br>
She dared not touch the whip as it contained the tremendous Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
The visitor was a middle-aged man from the Ten Directions House. It was General Gianni.
<br><br>
Alphonse was the chief of the Joy House while Gianni was the chief of the Broad House. They were at the same level; however, whether before or after becoming a Treacherous Being, Alphonse had always remained stronger than Gianni. They regarded each other as rivals.
<br><br>
After becoming Treacherous Beings, Gianni had been promoted to an important position, while Alphonse had been sent to the Treasure Bottle Platform, which was considered deportation.
<br><br>
Now Gianni visited him with an obvious intent to laugh at him.
<br><br>
Alphonse glanced at Gianni indifferently. "Are you going to eliminate my coordinates?" he asked.
<br><br>
For Treacherous Beings, they could come back to life repeatedly as long as their coordinates remained.
<br><br>
In fact, all the other attacking methods made no difference to the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
The woman's continuous whipping would only bring physical pain to Alphonse but would not kill him.
<br><br>
Many members of the Joy House had been killed on the Treasure Bottle Platform, but they had all been revived in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
However, removing their coordinates was equivalent to sentencing their end. It meant eternal death for Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Gianni laughed and said, "General Alphonse, you are known to always set your safety aside. Are you also afraid of death now?"
<br><br>
"When I got awakened by those snakes, I've been ready for this," replied Alphonse.
<br><br>
"They are badly in need of talents. They won't kill you for the time being.
<br><br>
Besides, the Joy House's guardianship at the Treasure Bottle Platform is just the first insurance, and the Godly Way energy itself is the second insurance!" Gianni declared as he stepped forward.
<br><br>
"What did you do to it?" Alphonse squinted his eyes.
<br><br>
Gianni turned around. "Come and release him!" he yelled to the woman.
<br><br>
The woman's face lit up. She joyously hurried forward and proceeded to untie the chains that bound her chief.
<br><br>
Gianni then pulled something from his sleeve, taking out a mirror.
<br><br>
The mirror showed a blurry image. It was vaguely a lake where several black ships floated above the water.
<br><br>
"What's this?" Alphonse asked. He had been guarding the remote Treasure Bottle Platform for many years, so he had poor information.
<br><br>
"The Black Ship, a force supported by the birds in the Source World,"
<br><br>
Gianni explained.
<br><br>
"Is the Godly Way energy in their hands?" Alphonse asked.
<br><br>
Gianni nodded and said, "There is a person among them who can fuse the Godly Ways. They must be anxious in creating the perfect Ways-blending Energy."
<br><br>
"Perfect Ways-blending Energy..." Alphonse rolled his eyes and said, "How can that be perfect?"
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect could scale the number of energy in the secondary worlds either up or down at their will.
<br><br>
If a world builder set the number of energy in a secondary world to be one thousand in total, then the Ways-blending Energy formed by one thousand kinds of energy would be the limit in this world.
<br><br>
If the number was three thousand in total, then the Ways-blending Energy formed by three thousand Godly Ways would be the limit.
<br><br>
"To the chaos, this is already perfection. Have you forgotten that we are also members of the chaos now? Don't use your past eyes to define things,"
<br><br>
Gianni said.
<br><br>
They both knew it was difficult for them to return to their original vast world.
<br><br>
Alphonse glanced at Gianni. "If he masters the complete Ways-blending Energy, he might have the ability to change the structure of the chaos. But you don't seem to be worried at all, do you?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Well, once he merges the last Godly Way, the second insurance will be triggered. We only need to wait and see," Gianni said with complacency.
<br><br>
Gianni, Alphonse, and the woman looked closely at the mirror, quietly observing the scene.
<br><br>
Because the picture was too blurry, they could only recognize the distorted figures of black ships and the lake. The other details remained unknown to them.
<br><br>
A few hours later...
<br><br>
The black ship at the center shook violently on the water.
<br><br>
It was as if an earthquake had started from beneath the lake, creating huge waves.
<br><br>
After that, a sheet of white light had suddenly swallowed the black ship...
<br><br>
"That power is extraordinary,"
<br><br>
Gianni commented as he patted on Alphonse's shoulder. He handed him the mirror and left the room.
<br><br>
Holding the mirror in his hand, Alphonse watched until the white light dimmed gradually and disappeared.
<br><br>
The black ship had been wrecked with its pieces scattered on the surface of the lake. Dark blood started gushing out from its ruins.
<br><br>
The ship was a part of the captain's body. Once it had been damaged too seriously, it wouldn't recover quickly. It reflected that a large amount of blood had been shed from the captain.
<br><br>
"They suspect that I deliberately allowed the Grandmaster of Heaven to steal the Godly Way energy from us," concluded Alphonse.
<br><br>
The woman nodded and asked, "Did he send this mirror to you as a warning?"
<br><br>
"It's not a warning," said Alphonse. "It's just a token of his contempt. He wants to tell me that whatever I want to do would just turn out pointless!"
<br><br>
He crushed the mirror into pieces in his hand.
<br><br>
Chapter 4065 Another Observer There were hundreds of thousands of lakes of different sizes in the Roaring Lake Province.
<br><br>
The Clear Sky Lake in the middle was the largest. If one were to look down from the sky, it would look like a magnificent gem embedded on the horizon.
<br><br>
A bright ball of light suddenly rose from the Roaring Lake Province, shocking all the creatures that were watching.
<br><br>
They stared at the light ball in the sky, unable to grasp what had happened.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, the terrifying shock wave reached them.
<br><br>
Along with this shock wave, a water wave that was thousands of meters high, spread out towards them.
<br><br>
With the Clear Sky Lake as the center, everything within tens of thousands of miles around was swept up by the wave.
<br><br>
It took four hours for the lake to finally return to a peaceful state.
<br><br>
The surface of the Clear Sky Lake had sunk more than eighty thousand feet, leaving only a pool of dirty water behind.
<br><br>
The three black ships lay askew on this pool, their surfaces cracked and blood flowing out of ship decks from time to time.
<br><br>
The sound of blood gurgling and the former captain's pained groan sounded through the mayhem.
<br><br>
The Black Ship had suffered a lot over the years, some ships even having been completely crushed and burnt.
<br><br>
But the captain had been well prepared then.
<br><br>
The destruction of one or two black ships was like cutting off an arm or a leg. Since the captain's cultivation base was at the Eternal Realm, it wasn't as big a problem.
<br><br>
The black ships in the Roaring Lake Province were his only remaining body parts.
<br><br>
These several black ships were seriously damaged, and the black ship carrying the Evil God was smashed to pieces.
<br><br>
This was a huge blow to the captain.
<br><br>
Shera and the Evil God were on the same ship when the explosions occurred.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the captain had sensed that something was wrong and extracted Shera from the cabin in time.
<br><br>
Even so, Shera had been sent smashing into the side of the black ship, thanks to the shock wave. Her body had become embedded in the deck, and many parts of her body were torn open.
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack...
<br><br>
When Shera woke up, she could hear the sound of the black ships being reconstructed.
<br><br>
The captain was trying his best to repair the black ships.
<br><br>
If someone were to attack him now, the captain wouldn't even have the strength to escape.
<br><br>
"Captain..." Shera called out. "What happened?"
<br><br>
The battle of the Pear Hill had ended just a while ago.
<br><br>
The Source World should logically have experienced a period of peace after the battle.
<br><br>
Neither the Pear Hill nor the Bearing race could start another war, given how the scale of that war could affect them.
<br><br>
Shera had just come to a conclusion when the captain said, "It's the Waysblending Energy."
<br><br>
"The Ways-blending Energy? How is it even possible?" Shera exclaimed in disbelief.
<br><br>
The Evil God wouldn't use too much energy if he were to integrate the Godly Ways. The Ways-blending Energy was unstable and its power was extraordinary, but it was impossible for it to cause such a huge damage.
<br><br>
"I saw it with my own eyes," the captain said affirmatively.
<br><br>
"Then the Evil God..." Shera's voice trembled.
<br><br>
"I don't know."
<br><br>
The white light ball had devoured the body of the Evil God when it had exploded.
<br><br>
The captain hadn't gotten a chance to save the Evil God, and he even hadn't been able to protect himself.
<br><br>
Shera struggled to get to her feet before she took a few steps on the lake, her spiritual sense spreading out quickly.
<br><br>
The lake had shrunk considerably, making it easy for Shera's spiritual sense to cover it.
<br><br>
She couldn't find any trace of the Evil God within the range of her spiritual sense.
<br><br>
"Has he disappeared?" Shera muttered.
<br><br>
"That energy was so powerful that it might have caused him to evaporate,"
<br><br>
the captain said.
<br><br>
It was very easy to destroy a person with such terrifying energy.
<br><br>
Now that they couldn't find the Evil God, it was highly possible that he had evaporated and that there was nothing left of him.
<br><br>
"He wouldn't die like this!" Shera said excitedly.
<br><br>
The captain hesitated for a while before he said, "Let's stay here and wait."
<br><br>
The Nihility race had invested a lot in the Evil God. If the Evil God died like this, it would be a great loss to the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Shera continued to float in the air and was about to expand her range when she suddenly sensed a force coming from up ahead.
<br><br>
Her reflexes told her to dodge it, but the force was too powerful. Before she could react, it turned into a big hand and grabbed her. And then, a huge figure appeared in front of her.
<br><br>
The Evil God! "Evil God... Captain! You're alright!" Shera exclaimed, surprised.
<br><br>
"How could I die in such a lowly manner?" the Evil God sneered.
<br><br>
He raised Shera, placed her on his shoulder, and looked up at the sky.
<br><br>
The Evil God had an extraordinary sensibility in the Source World.
<br><br>
He could sense that there was something unusual in the sky above the Roaring Lake Province. Two looming channels floated up there, some people peeping down through them.
<br><br>
"What's in the sky?" Shera asked.
<br><br>
"Some creatures are observing me," the Evil God answered, frowning.
<br><br>
"Who?" Shera's frown matched the Evil God's.
<br><br>
"I don't know. There seems to be two people..."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he stretched out a hand upwards, an energy spiral forming at his fist.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The energy spiral was like a giant dragon soaring into the sky. It crashed into one of the channels, shattering it to pieces.
<br><br>
In the Jade Pure Realm, Alphonse squeezed the mirror into pieces and dropped them to the ground.
<br><br>
He smirked and turned to leave when the human woman exclaimed, "General, look!"
<br><br>
The scene in the mirror had earlier been blurry.
<br><br>
It was even more difficult to see now that the mirror had been shattered thus.
<br><br>
Alphonse stretched out a hand and gently touched the fragments of the mirror. The fragments pieced together quickly and became a whole. It was almost as if they had souls.
<br><br>
When the mirror was pieced together, the human woman said, "That person is not dead. He seems to have discovered the Snake Masters' observation channel. What an alert and sharp fellow!"
<br><br>
"He wants to destroy the channel," said Alphonse.
<br><br>
Boom! It was then that they saw the Evil God's punch coming their way.
<br><br>
Nothing happened after this punch. The scene in the mirror was blurred, but it still existed.
<br><br>
"Did he miss the target?" the human woman asked.
<br><br>
Alphonse stared at the mirror, lost in thought. He then shook his head and said, "It doesn't seem like he failed to hit the channel. He has broken another channel. I think there's another one in addition to the Snake Masters' observation channel."
<br><br>
"Another observation channel? Are those birds also observing him?" the human woman asked.
<br><br>
"That's impossible," said Alphonse, shaking his head.
<br><br>
The birds controlled the Nihility race, and the Nihility race controlled the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Now that the Evil God and the Black Ship were a whole, it was easier to observe the Evil God. There was no need for the birds to observe him in this way.
<br><br>
"But who else will observe him apart from us and the birds?" The human woman was curious.
<br><br>
Was there a third force on the Other Shore? "I don't know yet..."
<br><br>
Alphonse had barely finished speaking when the Evil God's fist swung upwards once again.
<br><br>
An energy spiral soared into the sky and finally destroyed the Snake Masters' observation channel.
<br><br>
In the Heavenly Square City, the scenes in more than twenty mirrors of various sizes disappeared at the same time.
<br><br>
Alphonse's eyes seemed to brighten with an inexplicable joy as he looked at the blank mirror.
<br><br>
Chapter 4066 The One Who Rang The Bell There were six great caves lying five thousand feet below the ground of the Jade Pure Realm's northwest side.
<br><br>
Each cave was about three thousand feet in diameter.
<br><br>
Each cave's outer layer was covered with meat in the state of constant shrinking, which made the entire cave look like a beating heart.
<br><br>
While the cave was merely three thousand feet high, the inner space was far larger than this.
<br><br>
Each and every cave had its own world.
<br><br>
In the lowest cave stood the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
At the very bottom of the tower was a man holding a bronze mirror in the shape of Eight Diagrams.
<br><br>
He was clad in a cyan robe and looked rather wise and remarkable. His aura was impressive.
<br><br>
"What a sharp insight! The channel has been broken! This person's control over the Source World has risen to a new level..."
<br><br>
Grabbing the bronze mirror, he flew up to the top of the tower.
<br><br>
Carved on the surface at the top were densely packed scriptures, all of which were written in Sanskrit.
<br><br>
"Cutting and sharpening..."
<br><br>
the immortal-like old man muttered on top of the tower.
<br><br>
Each time he chanted, a circle of golden light spread out from his body.
<br><br>
The golden light swept right past the scriptures, making them rotate chaotically. An extremely solemn aura was emitted, making the old man's aura grow noble and grand.
<br><br>
Anyone who faced the suppression of the golden light couldn't help but fall to their knees.
<br><br>
But once the young man was swept by the light, he merely frowned and shouted, "Old man, the channel you've built so painstakingly has been destroyed! You deceived me again. Didn't you tell me that the channel wouldn't ever be discovered?"
<br><br>
Then, he threw the bronze mirror right in front of the other man.
<br><br>
The latter merely continued muttering.
<br><br>
And the golden light continued circling the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Before such a solemn scene, the young man's behavior seemed rather inappropriate.
<br><br>
A few minutes later, the old man's eyes shot open.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The golden light completely dissipated, and the Sanskrit words stopped circling as well, returning to their original form.
<br><br>
Hearing that the channel had been destroyed, the old man showed no sign of discontent on his face. Instead, he smiled and said, "As I expected, the young man wouldn't die under the Maximized Energy. You know, this Maximized Energy is..."
<br><br>
As he spoke, the young man seemed to find it unbearable and interrupted, "The Maximized Energy is produced by using a Godly Way to maximize the Ways-blending Energy. This kind of energy is absolutely uncontrollable.
<br><br>
Save for those who don't know, no one would be foolish enough to use the Maximized Energy. But it is the most suitable to use for killing the Evil God!"
<br><br>
The old man had repeated these words over a hundred times recently.
<br><br>
Having heard it so many times, the young man could recite each word very clearly.
<br><br>
The old man merely smiled helplessly—he didn't blame the younger man at all. "It's good that he's not dead. Everything goes according to plan, then.
<br><br>
He might now find a way to break the barrier..."
<br><br>
He was referring to the barrier between the Other Shore and the chaos.
<br><br>
From the moment chaos was built up until this point, no one had ever managed to break that barrier.
<br><br>
Both the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire chose to come to the Source World by descending.
<br><br>
In terms of form and strength, they'd be highly restricted.
<br><br>
"Can that guy really do it?" the young man questioned skeptically.
<br><br>
After all, the Other Shore was by no means a small nor simple world. It had a particularly special means of connection with the chaos.
<br><br>
"Yes," affirmed the old man.
<br><br>
In return, the young man merely curled his lips. It wasn't the first time the old man had talked nonsense, after all. If he was questioned, he'd undoubtedly make up many arguments to reason with the young man. Even if something false slipped out of the old man's mouth, he'd still manage to come up with several remarks.
<br><br>
But his master had forcefully comprehended a truth back then, resulting in a crack in the barrier. Perhaps, shattering it completely was a possible option.
<br><br>
Just then, a melodious bell suddenly rang from the inside of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
Dong! As it rang, a blazing white sword light rushed up from below.
<br><br>
"Again! Who is tolling the bell?" The young man in the cyan robe revealed a strange expression.
<br><br>
"Let's go and have a look. It should be a good thing, after all," said the old man with a smile.
<br><br>
And so the younger man turned to head into the tower.
<br><br>
From where he stood, he had a panoramic view of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
It had a total of thirty-three floors, all built according to the situation in the stages of Other Shore.
<br><br>
In the very corner of the first floor was a handful of golden Equinox Sand, the most preliminary Other Shore Token. From there, the stairs spiraled upward, each floor corresponding to a stage of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Form the sixth floor onward, the Other Shore Tokens on each floor were all of the fourth grade and above.
<br><br>
There were all sorts of tokens—the strengthening type, the auxiliary type, the mysterious type, and the descending type.
<br><br>
"Who is ringing the bell?"
<br><br>
The young man stared at it, narrowing his eyes until he found a figure to the side of the bell.
<br><br>
It was a young man in white, carrying a long sword on his back and exuding confidence and arrogance.
<br><br>
"Damn it! It's him again?" The man was rather speechless. "You just knocked the bell last month, didn't you? Can your body really withstand such strain?"
<br><br>
"Of course, his physical body can withstand it." The old man's voice resounded from above. "Don't underestimate my Grand Drip Technique. It's not inferior to the Land of Bone Tribulation!"
<br><br>
"Grand Drip Technique..." The young man's face twitched for a while, thinking that the old man's naming skill was growing worse and worse by the day.
<br><br>
Ringing the bell was no easy task.
<br><br>
After cultivating the Truth of Godly Way, one could enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower and take away one Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
The weakest Other Shore Token possessed the power of one divine megaton.
<br><br>
After the warrior made a breakthrough, they could obtain a physical body that carried the Other Shore Token from the higher floor. By then, they could ring the bell once again.
<br><br>
The more they cultivated, the more difficult it was to strengthen their bodies, making it harder to ring the bell again.
<br><br>
In the previous month, after the young man who carried a sword on his back rang the bell, he took away the Other Shore Token on the thirtieth floor.
<br><br>
Again, reaching the thirty-first floor from the thirtieth floor was by no means an easy feat.
<br><br>
For some, they could spend thousands of years trying to get there but to no avail.
<br><br>
But only a month later, the man managed to ring the bell again—in just a single month, his physical strength had increased drastically. It was completely astonishing.
<br><br>
In the Ruin Graveyard At the very core of the Divine Bell City lay a huge bronze bell.
<br><br>
It was considered the Ruin Graveyard's most holy treasure—the object all the creatures there relied on.
<br><br>
Each warrior who had reached the Other Shore Realm would visit to ring the bell and obtain their token.
<br><br>
"Dong!"
<br><br>
A long ringing resounded across the Divine Bell City.
<br><br>
The entire place boiled with excitement.
<br><br>
The sound of the bell belonged to the thirty-first floor. Very few people in the Ruin Graveyard could ever make it.
<br><br>
Sitting cross-legged under the huge bell, Rocher had already entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
According to the rules, he had to choose the most suitable Other Shore Token before the bell chime stopped.
<br><br>
Chapter 4067 In The Mysterious Yellow Tower When Rocher entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower for the first time, the bell only rang for three seconds.
<br><br>
He kept in mind what Bromley and the other elders had told him. He could grab whatever he liked in the tower, but he could just take one.
<br><br>
However, as he only had a few seconds, he didn't have enough time to choose properly. Thus, he just took an Other Shore Token randomly.
<br><br>
When he realized that the token he got was not suitable for the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, he felt so frustrated. All his efforts were put to waste.
<br><br>
The second time he entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower, he could now stay for six seconds. The premise still held that he could only choose one of the Other Shore Tokens of his liking.
<br><br>
Though he still didn't have that much time, he, fortunately, obtained a suitable one this time.
<br><br>
Seeing that he acquired a useful one the second time, he became more determined. He went in again and bet on his luck. As the bell stopped, he was kicked out by a strong force. According to the Ruin Graveyard, he was actually kicked out by a huge foot.
<br><br>
However, not even a single Other Shore Token he obtained in the next three attempts he made could be useful to him. So for now, he had to make do with the one he acquired the second time he went in.
<br><br>
Over time, Rocher improved the strength of his physical body. This made the bell ring for a longer period.
<br><br>
When he already reached the thirtieth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, the ringing of the bell could now last for five minutes.
<br><br>
In his next attempt, he directly went to the thirty-first floor as soon as the bell rang.
<br><br>
There he saw several Other Shore Tokens embedded on the walls of the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Occasionally, there would be a dazzling light emitting from them, containing incredible Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
Rocher leaned against the wall and walked quickly along the corridor of the thirty-first floor. He analyzed each of the Other Shore Tokens in there so that he could pick the best one for him.
<br><br>
"This one's the Dead Skeleton."
<br><br>
It was a mysterious-type Other Shore Token and Rocher was unsure of its ability. He thought that he should aim for something that he could readily use.
<br><br>
"The Power of Mist…"
<br><br>
It was a strengthening-type Other Shore Token. However, Rocher didn't lack power, so he deemed to choose something that could boost his other attributes.
<br><br>
"The Speed Boots."
<br><br>
It should be a descending-type Other Shore Token that could greatly increase one's speed.
<br><br>
In the Ruin Graveyard, there were specially assigned beings to record, analyze, and evaluate the Other Shore Tokens which were situated on the top floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
In particular, their jobs were focused on the new Other Shore Tokens in the tower.
<br><br>
On the thirty-first floor, there were three special Other Shore Tokens. They were known as the Whirlwind Wings, the Sacred Battle Sword, and the Monta Stone.
<br><br>
Rocher quickly skipped over the ordinary Other Shore Tokens and focused his attention on these as he got to the section where they were located.
<br><br>
"Let's see. The Monta Stone could greatly enhance the strength of one's body.
<br><br>
The Sacred Battle Sword is a masculine type, but the broadsword is not that suitable for me.
<br><br>
Lastly, the Whirlwind Wings should belong to the descending type. They're supposed to greatly improve one's bodily movement skill." Rocher's eyes flashed with excitement as he stared at the last Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
It was like the pair of transparent wings was tailor-made for him.
<br><br>
He had already seen and understood the Whirlwind Wings before from the ancient books in the Ruin Graveyard. He was enticed by it the moment he had laid his eyes on the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
The Whirlwind Wings had been on the thirty-first floor for the longest time.
<br><br>
After all, only very few people from the Ruin Graveyard could reach this floor. However, in recent years, a group of extraordinary talents started appearing in the divine land.
<br><br>
If the divine land was given enough time, the number of their strong warriors would definitely surpass that of the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Buzz! Rocher knew that the bell would stop ringing soon.
<br><br>
The ringing started trembling more violently but its sharpness decreased gradually.
<br><br>
It also meant that Rocher needed to hurry in picking the token of his choice.
<br><br>
Once the ringing stopped, he would be instantly kicked out of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, he reached out his hand and tried to grab the Whirlwind Wings. However, just when he was about to touch them, the Whirlwind Wings disappeared and he was only able to touch the wall.
<br><br>
His eyes widened as his face was filled with confusion. "What happened?"
<br><br>
But as the sound of bell kept on dissipating, he had not much time to think.
<br><br>
He clearly thought that he couldn't leave empty handed, so he quickly floated towards the Sacred Battle Sword. However, just as what happened with the Whirlwind Wings, it instantly disappeared just before he grabbed it.
<br><br>
"Hey! This isn't funny!"
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The ringing of the bell trembled more and more violently. Rocher now only had about six seconds before he would be kicked out.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Left with no choice, Rocher leaped to the other side of the wall and grabbed the Monta Stone.
<br><br>
The stone was still one of the strongest Other Shore Tokens on the thirtyfirst floor, although it was not suitable for him.
<br><br>
Buzz! The bell made its final ring and instantly stopped. Rocher felt a sudden force bump into his body. The next moment, he had already returned to the Divine Bell City.
<br><br>
Inside the Mysterious Yellow Tower, the young man in the cyan robe emerged from the dark with a complacent look on his face.
<br><br>
In his hands, he was holding the Sacred Battle Sword and the Whirlwind Wings that disappeared from the walls earlier.
<br><br>
"What's your motive for helping him? You always look down upon the people from the Ruin Graveyard, don't you?" the old man asked.
<br><br>
"No, he's not from the Ruin Graveyard. He's from the divine land," the young man replied.
<br><br>
"Huh? What's the difference? Those two places have now become one," the old man remarked.
<br><br>
The young man paused for a while and said with a faint smile, "Maybe, I was just rooting for him. He has a high chance to eventually reach the thirty-third floor. With the Monta Stone, he will reach it faster."
<br><br>
Upon saying that, he hung both tokens back to the walls.
<br><br>
There were only extremely few people who could even make it to the thirtyfirst floor. After Rocher took the Monta Stone, the other two tokens would have to wait a long time again before someone could attempt to grab them.
<br><br>
A Bell Ringing Meeting was held every month in the Divine Bell City.
<br><br>
Various races and forces attended this meeting.
<br><br>
There weren't too many conflicts in the Ruin Graveyard. Human and nonhuman races coexisted without any enmity between them.
<br><br>
To every race that was residing there, the bell ringing wasn't only a way to enhance their strength. It was also considered as a competition among many races.
<br><br>
Originally, three non-human races had an absolute advantage in the entire Ruin Graveyard, while the other weaker races had several limitations.
<br><br>
As for the human race, Bromley was the only one they could rely on.
<br><br>
But as the divine land entered the Ruin Graveyard, its people accidentally discovered that the place was an excellent venue for cultivation.
<br><br>
The Truths of Godly Ways began to spread quickly in the divine land. The True Gods from various powerful clans and ancestral lands began to cultivate the Truths of Godly Ways.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard formerly had a reputation of being a dangerous place in the chaos, but as they accepted the divine land, they eventually began following the rules.
<br><br>
In return, the humans from the divine land also obtained a considerable amount of cultivation resources.
<br><br>
Over recent years, some of the young talents from the divine land had reached the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
And among them, Rocher was considered to be the most outstanding one.
<br><br>
He had an extraordinary understanding of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.
<br><br>
In fact, he had mastered it in just a few months after he was sent into the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
The first time he rang the bell of the Divine Bell City, he had successfully obtained a divine megaton of force.
<br><br>
After he reached the Other Shore Realm, he had been cultivating in the Water Drop Cave.
<br><br>
The Grand Drip Technique there could quickly enhance one's physical strength. As he entered the Water Drop Cave, he was given special treatment. His rate of progress was just several times faster than that of any ordinary warrior.
<br><br>
He was considered as a genius and a rising star that appeared in the Ruin Graveyard after all these years.
<br><br>
Chapter 4068 The Water Drop Cave Sitting cross-legged underneath the enormous golden bell, Rocher slowly opened his eyes. Little by little, he began to take his surroundings in.
<br><br>
A huge plaza was built around the bell. It was obvious that this bell held great importance.
<br><br>
Dozens of people lined up on its right side. All of them were patiently waiting for their turn.
<br><br>
Some of the people standing in line were consummate True Gods. They were hoping to enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower by ringing the bell.
<br><br>
Others were warriors at the Other Shore Realm who wanted to reach higher floors in the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
For these talented individuals of the divine land, accidentally falling into the Ruin Graveyard was actually a great opportunity for them.
<br><br>
Long time ago, the numbers of the powerful clans above the Time Sea and the Holy Beings in the divine land were fixed. No matter what, they remained unchangeable.
<br><br>
Unless they eliminated other powerful clans above the Time Sea, they would only remain as consummate True Gods their entire lives.
<br><br>
Ever since the Luo Clan took control of the divine land, their chances became even slimmer than before.
<br><br>
Fortunately, there were Truths of Godly Ways for them to cultivate as well as places to assist them in their cultivation in the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Therefore, they would have a good chance of reaching the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
According to the rules, all of the Other Shore Tokens obtained in the Mysterious Yellow Tower should be shown to everyone present.
<br><br>
As soon as everyone saw Rocher regain consciousness, their eyes were instantly filled with anticipation and excitement. They couldn't wait to see what Other Shore Token he got. He promptly stood up and stepped aside.
<br><br>
"Hey Rocher! What did you get? Was it a good one?" the young man standing beside him asked. He couldn't quite contain his curiosity anymore.
<br><br>
This man was none other than Hallet.
<br><br>
Hallet was able to obtain an Other Shore Token from the fifteenth floor.
<br><br>
Even though he was not as outstanding as Rocher, he was still considered as one of the best.
<br><br>
"Did you manage to get the Whirlwind Wings?" another young man piped as he looked at Rocher over Hallet's shoulder.
<br><br>
His name was Augustus. He had a much better luck and talent compared to Hallet's. He was able to acquire an Other Shore Token from the nineteenth floor. Among all of the Other Shore Realm warriors in the divine land, he could easily be ranked as one of the top three.
<br><br>
Rocher took out the Other Shore Token he got. "It's the Monta Stone," he announced.
<br><br>
When everyone saw the gray stone, the whole place was immediately filled with commotion.
<br><br>
This stone was actually one of the best Other Shore Tokens that could be obtained from the thirty-first floor. However, Rocher did not find it suitable.
<br><br>
He was hoping to get a different one.
<br><br>
"But why the Monta Stone?" Hallet asked with unabated curiosity.
<br><br>
Even if he didn't manage to get the Whirlwind Wings or the Sacred Battle Sword, he should not have chosen the Monta Stone. It didn't suit him at all.
<br><br>
It seemed that Rocher was also puzzled by this. "When I got there, I wanted to take the Whirlwind Wings. However, they disappeared."
<br><br>
"What? They disappeared? Why?" Augustus looked thoroughly baffled as well.
<br><br>
"Hmm. I heard that such things have happened before as well," Hallet responded. His child-like face bore an expression of utter incredulity and amazement. "The Mysterious Yellow Tower was guiding you. If it didn't want you to take the Whirlwind Wings or Sacred Battle Sword, it means that the Monta Stone might be the one you need the most. This might be more essential for you than the two Other Shore Tokens."
<br><br>
All of the people in the Ruin Graveyard didn't know much about the Mysterious Yellow Tower. All they knew was something peculiar and mystifying would happen in the tower from time to time.
<br><br>
The tower guiding some people to take the Other Shore Tokens befitting them was one of those mysterious happenings.
<br><br>
"But the function of this stone doesn't match my needs." Rocher frowned at the stone in his hand.
<br><br>
When he heard this, Hallet smiled. He said, "Well, you just have to believe that the Mysterious Yellow Tower knows you better than you do. In addition to that, we barely have any ideas about the Other Shore Tokens found on the top floors of the tower. Therefore, we can only speculate about their functions. Perhaps, this stone is not a strengthening-type Other Shore Token."
<br><br>
It was a bit difficult to confirm the ability of an Other Shore Token. It could only be verified after it had been borne and used by its owner.
<br><br>
Only a few number of people were able to bear the Other Shore Tokens on the thirty-first floor. Therefore, their initial assessment was merely a speculation.
<br><br>
"In any case, the guidance of the Mysterious Yellow Tower always has good results. You have to trust its judgment," Augustus added.
<br><br>
In the past, Augustus had very little interest in cultivation. But ever since he was able to reach the Other Shore Realm, he had a change of heart. He cultivated hard, which resulted in his extremely fast progress.
<br><br>
Rocher was a little disappointed and downcast. But when he heard what they said, he began to feel better. Soon enough, he was extremely excited to try his Other Shore Token out. He was curious to see what kind of magic this Monta Stone had.
<br><br>
"I sure hope you are right. We'll just have to see for ourselves." Rocher clapped his hands on their shoulders.
<br><br>
Dong! The sound echoed throughout the entire place.
<br><br>
At that very moment, the gigantic golden bell in the center of the square rang once again.
<br><br>
The person who rang the bell was at the fifth stage of the Other Shore Realm. The ringing only lasted for about thirty seconds.
<br><br>
As the man opened his eyes, he showed the Other Shore Token he was able to obtain and promptly left from the queue.
<br><br>
"Good! It's my turn!"
<br><br>
Augustus exclaimed excitedly and confidently as he walked towards the big bell.
<br><br>
"You seem very confident, Augustus," Rocher said with a smile.
<br><br>
With this, Hallet sighed and shook his head. "He has gained quite a lot in the Water Drop Cave. He is actually planning to ring the bell two times in a row this time." He finished his sentence with a slight smile.
<br><br>
"Two times in a row? Unbelievable!" Rocher was dumbfounded. He didn't know Augustus was that advanced in his cultivation.
<br><br>
The other people waiting in line were filled with shock and envy. They wished they were able to do that as well.
<br><br>
There was a simple answer to this: the Water Drop Cave.
<br><br>
It was a magical cultivation place.
<br><br>
This stone cave was quite massive.
<br><br>
It was very cold and wet. Moreover, it branched out to hundreds of other caves located deep inside it. Each one was different in size and shape.
<br><br>
All year round, there was water dripping from these caves. It was thoroughly clean and crystal clear. In fact, the droplets contained a unique aura that could greatly speed up the comprehension of the Truths of Godly Ways. This was its primary application.
<br><br>
There were numerous places found in the Ruin Graveyard where one could comprehend the Truths of Godly Ways. Examples of these were the Sword Graveyard and the Gate of Nature. Each place corresponded to a specific Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
However, the Water Drop Cave didn't have the requirement for a particular Truth of Godly Way. Its effect was actually quite ordinary. Therefore, it was not as popular as the ones mentioned before.
<br><br>
The only time people considered going to the Water Drop Cave was whenever the Sword Graveyard, the Gate of Nature, and others were full. In short, people went here only as a last resort.
<br><br>
Later on, the divine land had been merged with the Ruin Graveyard. Soon after, there were changes that took place in the Water Drop Cave. The once clean and crystal clear water dripping from the caves became turbid.
<br><br>
Warriors had to compete for the resources in the Ruin Graveyard as well.
<br><br>
As a recently allied group, it was difficult for the ones from the divine land to gain access to the popular cultivation places. Therefore, the once unpopular Water Drop Cave was their best choice.
<br><br>
The first ones to enter and utilize the Water Drop Cave was Rocher, Augustus, Hallet, Estelle, and the other consummate True Gods. They thought it was good that they still found a place for themselves in this new territory.
<br><br>
One by one they tested the effects of cultivating in this cave. As the turbid water poured onto them, their bodies began to expand in just a short period of time.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard did not have the Chaotic Source World or Land of Bone Tribulation. Hence, they couldn't find a solution to the problem regarding cultivation of physical strength. This became a problem for Bromley after he reached the Other Shore Realm. It became harder for him to improve his cultivation. His physical body was unable to match the corresponding Other Shore Token. Eventually, it became a burden to him.
<br><br>
The change in the Water Drop Cave caused a commotion in the entire Ruin Graveyard. Everyone wanted to try cultivating there.
<br><br>
During that time, fights even broke out in the Ruin Graveyard. People began challenging each other to determine who would be allowed to occupy positions in the Water Drop Cave.
<br><br>
On behalf of the human race, Bromley had reserved a considerable number of seats for the people of the divine land.
<br><br>
In just a short period of time, both the human and non-human races in the divine land were able to produce a group of strong warriors. Soon enough, they reached the Other Shore Realm. All of them owed it to the change in the Water Drop Cave.
<br><br>
However, the Holy Beings of the divine land were unable to make much progress.
<br><br>
Even though they also cultivated in the Water Drop Cave, their improvement was quite slow. They were quite baffled by it because they were highly talented individuals.
<br><br>
It was absolutely unusual that no matter how hard they tried, their cultivation speed was utterly slower than those of the consummate True Gods.
<br><br>
Aside from Bromley, the Holy Emperor of the Leng Clan, Jeremiah, and Joy, the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan, were the fastest ones to improve their cultivation. In a short span of time, they had already managed to reach the fourteenth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Mike, Zeke, Clark, Holy Jay, and other Holy Emperors had only reached the seventh or eighth floor.
<br><br>
If they were on the real Other Shore, they would not even be able to leave the Lust World. They had to spend more time working on their physical strength.
<br><br>
Chapter 4069 Worry Along the borders of the Ruin Graveyard, a flying ship slowly approached.
<br><br>
As the space beyond the graveyard twisted, the flying ship drilled in without hesitation.
<br><br>
Actually, the whole Ruin Graveyard was an isolated area from other spaces.
<br><br>
The divine land lay at anchor at the entrance of the Ruin Graveyard. Once the flying ship entered, it came to a complete stop at the top layer of the divine land.
<br><br>
From within the divine land, a space channel had been constructed. Seeing that they'd arrived, Mike came out of the channel to welcome the flying ship.
<br><br>
A few people exited the flying ship in succession.
<br><br>
Rosie and her sister, Lorena, were the last two to come out.
<br><br>
After being reincarnated, Rosie was reinstated as a consummate True God again. After she comprehended the Truth of Godly Way, she eagerly explored the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
Overall, her main goal in breaking through in the Sea of Truth was to find a way to enter the real Other Shore.
<br><br>
After the divine land entered the Ruin Graveyard, more warriors relied on the resources of the graveyard which allowed them to reach the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
Lorena couldn't care less about this; all she missed were her daughter and son.
<br><br>
As the journey to the Source World would be difficult and dangerous, she wanted to enter the Other Shore to find them.
<br><br>
Lorena had high hopes for this method. After all, only one Other Shore existed. However, when she asked about the Other Shore, Bromley said that entering through the Ruin Graveyard would lead them to the Mysterious Yellow Tower where there were all kinds of Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Still, they wouldn't be able to go to Stage Thirty-three of the real Other Shore.
<br><br>
This saddened Lorena. If the Other Shore Realm warriors in the Ruin Graveyard couldn't go to the real Other Shore, then perhaps the people of the divine land would be able to do so.
<br><br>
After Augustus had comprehended the Truth of Godly Way, Lorena instructed him that he must not ring the bell nor enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Once he fused with the Truth of Godly Way, she asked him to immediately enter the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
To her disappointment, this still didn't work.
<br><br>
After Augustus activated the Truth of Godly Way, he didn't enter the Sea of Truth. As per Lorena's instructions, he did not ring the bell nor enter the Mysterious Yellow Tower, but he fell into a desolate area of nothing.
<br><br>
Augustus could not move around in the wilderness. Seeing that he had entered the wrong area, he had no choice but to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune and escape.
<br><br>
After she had asked around, Lorena discovered that all the creatures in the Ruin Graveyard encountered this problem.
<br><br>
All of them couldn't activate the Truth of Godly Way to enter the Other Shore. They would only enter the same desolate area Augustus fell in.
<br><br>
Unconvinced, Lorena took her sister, Rosie, to the outside of the Ruin Graveyard. As a True God, Rose comprehended the Truth of Godly Way and could be of use to her.
<br><br>
The rules of the Ruin Graveyard were very strict. Anyone who entered would have a difficult time leaving.
<br><br>
However, Lorena was an exception.
<br><br>
Lorena took Rosie to the chaos and instructed her to enter the Other Shore from there.
<br><br>
Their attempt was not successful. Rosie still fell into a desolate area just like Augustus did.
<br><br>
The look of frustration across Lorena's face was enough for Mike to understand what had happened. "Is it still unable to go to the real Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"Yes." Lorena nodded in disappointment, her eyes looking down.
<br><br>
Mike stepped forward and gave her an embrace. "Don't worry too much.
<br><br>
Trust in Zen's strength..."
<br><br>
"The Ruin Graveyard is most probably set up by a super master who can even break the rules of the Other Shore. As far as I know, no one in the Source World can do that. If Zen and Yan don't leave, they would be able to cultivate in the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Not only would they be safe from the dangers on the Other Shore, but they would also cultivate faster,"
<br><br>
Lorena said as she choked on the sobs she had been holding back.
<br><br>
As a member of the Source World, she knew well how terrifying the real Other Shore was. If one was not careful, they would die. On top of that, it was difficult to advance to a higher level and obtain a stronger Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Notably, the Ruin Graveyard was still a good place for cultivation.
<br><br>
Though the competition in the graveyard was fierce, the internal competition among the super forces of the Source World was just as intense.
<br><br>
The Mysterious Yellow Tower was even more mysterious. Top-grade Other Shore Tokens could be found there and new tokens were added once in a while.
<br><br>
These tokens ranged across all stages of the Other Shore, from Stage one to Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Whoever arranged this must have been extremely powerful and outstanding.
<br><br>
Lorena always had a hard time grasping this. Every time she thought of Zen and Yan, her stomach swirled in regret.
<br><br>
"Even if the the Mysterious Yellow Tower is a good place, it still lacks one thing Zen needs," Mike pointed out.
<br><br>
"And that is?" asked Lorena.
<br><br>
"Training." Mike smiled.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard was in a completely closed status.
<br><br>
After people reached the Other Shore Realm, they could only spar with each other, resulting in the lack of training.
<br><br>
They were not as good as the real Other Shore Realm warriors whose combat strengths were much stronger.
<br><br>
"Should our son train by risking his life?" Lorena was irritated with the idea. "Moreover, the capabilities of the tokens from the Other Shore remain uncertain. It's extremely difficult to obtain a good token there, while every token here is at least at the fourth grade. Even the Nine Li race wouldn't be able to obtain such a token easily during their prosperity period."
<br><br>
Hearing Lorena's words, Mike grew silent. He couldn't refute her at this point.
<br><br>
Respectfully, he kept his mouth shut and listened intently to Lorena.
<br><br>
Though Lorena tended to go in circles, he nodded and patiently listened to her.
<br><br>
Rosie also smiled as she understood her sister's worries.
<br><br>
However, Rosie still had great confidence in Zen. She knew that he wouldn't suffer any loss in the Source World, but she also wondered if he could ever find the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
"Though the Other Shore Tokens here are easier to obtain, is this really a good thing?" Mike broke the silence.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard was strange in many ways.
<br><br>
It did not appear dangerous, but it was quite comparable to the Source World.
<br><br>
From where they were, the one who'd built the Ruin Graveyard seemed ambitious.
<br><br>
However, the person never appeared to them.
<br><br>
Bromley and the races of the Ruin Graveyard had little knowledge on the origin of the Ruin Graveyard or who it belonged to. This was a big problem to the human beings in the divine land, and they spent years trying to learn all they could.
<br><br>
"We shouldn't worry! The Ruin Graveyard favors us," Rosie said. "I think the owner of the Ruin Graveyard bears no malice towards us!"
<br><br>
"I sure hope so," Mike nodded.
<br><br>
He was not optimistic about it.
<br><br>
In fact, the Holy Beings in the divine land had the same worry.
<br><br>
There had never been free resources in the world. On top of that, after the divine land entered the graveyard. many changes occurred.
<br><br>
For example, every time the talents of the human race entered the Water Drop Cave, they obtained more water to drip into their bodies. In the Sword Graveyard, the human race obtained more light of comprehension for their swordsmanship compared to the others.
<br><br>
All of this evoked jealousy of alien races around the graveyard. There was even a time when the alien races joined forces to expel the divine land.
<br><br>
However, just as the alien races made their move, a bad omen washed over the Ruin Graveyard. The graveyard punished the alien races, sending them all to hiding. After that, no race ever dared to make an enemy of the human race again.
<br><br>
Chapter 4070 Encounter The Night View Island was no longer peaceful these days.
<br><br>
This was largely because the Glede Demon race had spread the news that the Red Demon race were sacrificing members of many races in exchange for the Arcana.
<br><br>
This had caused so much panic among the weaker races that they had abandoned their own territories and formed alliances.
<br><br>
Bacchus took advantage of the situation and extended an olive branch to these races. He won them over by claiming he could protect them. Then he asked them to gather in the land of the Glede Demon race to fight against the Red Demon race.
<br><br>
Of course, his protection would not come for free. These races had to hand over all the Arcana they had.
<br><br>
With this strategy, the Glede Demons accumulated a lot of Arcana in a short time, all while amassing the other races to their side.
<br><br>
This would increase the chances of victory for the Glede Demons should the Red Demons launch an attack.
<br><br>
Bacchus handed over all the Arcana he had plundered to Zen and escorted him and his group to the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
He wanted three Holy Stones in return.
<br><br>
The Holy Stones were great threats to the Treacherous Beings. Bacchus had to get them at all costs.
<br><br>
Zen agreed to his request.
<br><br>
Previously, he had killed three stone men in the underground cave and obtained three Holy Stones the size of beans. He gave them to the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and their own three stones, the size of grains of sand, were given to Bacchus.
<br><br>
Soon, daylight broke on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
The dawn found Zen and his companions climbing one last mountain with the Glede Demons before arriving at the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
As they neared the peak however, they noted something curious. Though there was nothing ahead to block their vision, they couldn't see the Ghost Mountain anywhere in the distance.
<br><br>
The empty expanse ahead left Zen and the others stumped. Both Decker and the Glede Demons said that the Ghost Mountain was here, however. They couldn't possibly be mistaken.
<br><br>
It was only when they crossed the peak line that a huge black shadow came into view.
<br><br>
It was a huge triangular mountain! As Decker had said, the Ghost Mountain was protected by a special space rule. It could only be seen after they crossed the peak line.
<br><br>
The Ghost Mountain was largely outside the Night View Island, save for a part of its foot, which was connected to the island. A wide and straight path had been carved along this border.
<br><br>
The surface of the whole mountain was covered with irregular lines, which helped it absorb all light.
<br><br>
From this distance, the Ghost Mountain seemed to be floating in the dark sky.
<br><br>
"We need to go down and exchange the Arcana so we can enter the Ghost Mountain," Bacchus pronounced.
<br><br>
He spread his wings and glided down the mountain, leading his clansmen.
<br><br>
Zen and the others followed him down.
<br><br>
Eventually, they came upon two black monkey statues flanking the path.
<br><br>
Zen's expression changed slightly when he saw the statues.
<br><br>
It dawned on him the Ghost Mountain was probably related to the monkey spirits in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
"The way to enter the Ghost Mountain is very simple. Just feed the Arcana to the monkey statues," Bacchus explained.
<br><br>
As he said this, he took out his Arcana and stuffed them into the mouth of a monkey statue.
<br><br>
The statue opened its mouth like a living creature, devouring the Arcana bit by bit. Its eyes began to glow with a yellow light. A few moments later, its belly slowly opened and exposed a glazed sheet.
<br><br>
Bacchus took the sheet and held it up. "This is the key to entering the Ghost Mountain and to merging with the Treacherous Beings."
<br><br>
"I see. The statues melt the Arcana and then press them into thin sheets, correct?" Fuxi asked with a smile.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had also realized the same thing. The monkey statues weren't too mysterious. They only had a flame rune which melted the Arcana in their mouths and turned them into the glazed sheets.
<br><br>
Bacchus nodded. "That's correct. But we can't enter the Ghost Mountain with just any glazed sheet. It is only through this mechanism we can get the special runes that we need."
<br><br>
He showed the glazed sheet to Zen, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others.
<br><br>
There were indeed indecipherable circles of large and small runes on the surface of the transparent sheet.
<br><br>
"Don't think about it too much. Our only goal is to get in."
<br><br>
As she spoke, the Snake Goddess likewise fed the Arcana to a monkey statue.
<br><br>
Once again, the eyes of the statue flashed, and a thin glazed sheet appeared in its belly.
<br><br>
Zen, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the Eternal Realm Hunters followed suit, each exchanging their Arcana for a glazed sheet.
<br><br>
As the Treacherous Being Campbell also fed his Arcana to the monkey statue, Bacchus pointed out, "He can enter the Ghost Mountain, but he can't fuse with any Treacherous Being. Are you sure you want him to go in?"
<br><br>
He was actually implying that it would be useless for Campbell to enter.
<br><br>
But it was impossible for Zen to leave Campbell behind. "Of course," he said firmly.
<br><br>
Bacchus shrugged his shoulders and didn't press further.
<br><br>
After the Glede Demons also got their glazed sheets, Decker, who was at the back of the line, meekly piped up, "May I go in?"
<br><br>
A Glede Demon shot him a cold glare. "Why? Do you have Arcana?"
<br><br>
Decker was a member of the Wooden Leaf race. The Glede Demons didn't think too highly of him.
<br><br>
Zen had previously allowed Decker to join the team as a guide, but now that they had the Glede Demons to show the way, his function was no longer necessary.
<br><br>
Bacchus, in fact, had once directly asked Decker to leave, but he remained only because Zen had insisted that he stay.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons had been searching for Arcana everywhere the past few days. How dare a member of the Wooden Leaf race have them in his possession and not tell them? "I..."
<br><br>
As Decker tried to explain, the Glede Demon came forward. "Hand over the Arcana you have, then!" he demanded.
<br><br>
Decker was too weak to disobey.
<br><br>
Decker gave Zen a pleading look as he moved to take out the Arcana he had accumulated. At this point, Zen intervened, "Decker was the one who led us to you. If it weren't for him, we would never have met. Let him join us."
<br><br>
It was a subtle reminder that were it not for Decker, they wouldn't have been able to save the lives of the Glede Demons.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons looked at Bacchus, who waved his hand. "Do as he said."
<br><br>
The Glede Demons relented and moved aside.
<br><br>
Decker shot Zen a grateful look. He quickly took out his Arcana and exchanged them for a glazed sheet.
<br><br>
After everyone had done this, they continued on to the entrance of the Ghost Mountain. They shortly arrived at a black wall with a stone door at the center of it.
<br><br>
"Only one person can enter at a time. Just follow my lead."
<br><br>
As he spoke, Bacchus pressed the glazed sheet against the stone door. As the stone door creaked, he disappeared from the spot.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others followed suit.
<br><br>
Zen took out his glazed sheet. He was about to enter the stone door when he suddenly felt an unusual aura. He paused.
<br><br>
He turned around and saw another group of creatures reach the peak in the distance.
<br><br>
They were the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race.
<br><br>
The two races had long been at odds with each other, but here they were, miraculously working together.
<br><br>
The reason for this newfound alliance, of course, was not that they had reconciled, but that they had no other choice, if they were to defeat a common enemy.
<br><br>
Tate bowed and spoke respectfully to the eyeball floating in the light ball, "Master Eye Spirit, this is Ghost Mountain."
<br><br>
"I see it,"
<br><br>
the Eye Spirit said calmly.
<br><br>
His attention landed on the young man in front of the door.
<br><br>
His sharp eyes firmly fixed on Zen. Immediately, Zen felt rooted to the spot, as if suddenly bound by steel chains.
<br><br>
Even Decker, Thurston and Sawyer were affected beside him. They felt only a tenth of the force binding Zen, but it already left them barely able to breathe.
<br><br>
Chapter 4071 Break Free A hexagonal pattern appeared in the eyeball.
<br><br>
The power transmitted from the eyeball became stronger and stronger as circles of golden light bloomed within the pattern.
<br><br>
Decker's face turned red after being pressed this way, his body creaking dangerously. Sawyer and Thurston were in similar situations. If his strength continued to increase, it would crush their bodies.
<br><br>
Zen could bear a power ten times stronger than what Sawyer, Thurston, and Decker could bear.
<br><br>
His physical body had been strengthened greatly, and it had far exceeded that of most creatures in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
He didn't move even under the pressure of such a powerful force.
<br><br>
"Master Eye Spirit, I'm going to kill him!"
<br><br>
Gavyn said, seeing that the Eye Spirit had already controlled Zen.
<br><br>
But the moment the six wings of the Holy Wings Armor were unfurled, Zen, who was at the foot of the Ghost Mountain, suddenly shook his body and stretched his hands to his sides.
<br><br>
The steel cage that the Eye Spirit had made shattered.
<br><br>
Crack! The hexagonal pattern in the Eye Spirit's eyeball also dissipated.
<br><br>
Zen then turned to the people around him and ordered, "You go in first".
<br><br>
Sawyer, Thurston, and Decker broke free from the huge pressure, panting, their faces red.
<br><br>
At Zen's words, Sawyer was the first to put the glazed sheet on the stone door. The door spun quickly and pushed him into the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Thurston and Decker followed close behind.
<br><br>
Zen glared at the Eye Spirit, and then put the glazed sheet on the stone door.
<br><br>
And as the door revolved, he disappeared from before the door.
<br><br>
"He runs so fast!" Claire said, smiling.
<br><br>
"There is no other way out in the Ghost Mountain. He can't escape," the Eye Spirit said calmly. "Moreover, the power of my eyeball that I just used has reached its limit."
<br><br>
"You can force him to stay using your..." Gavyn cut in.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit cast a cold glance at Gavyn and said, "I don't need your advice on what kind of theurgy I use!"
<br><br>
Gavin immediately shut up, noticing the displeasure in the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
"Red Demons, lead the way!" the Eye Spirit ordered again.
<br><br>
How dare Tate disobey him! He then led the members of his race to walk down the mountain and they finally arrived in front of the monkey statues.
<br><br>
"Master Eye Spirit, I'll help you exchange for the thing you need to enter the Ghost Mountain," said Tate, his tone friendly.
<br><br>
"No need."
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit walked forward and a glazed sheet appeared in the eyeball.
<br><br>
This glazed sheet was also made of the Arcanum. He stuffed it into the mouth of the monkey statue and stepped back. The statue chewed it for a while. He then got another glazed sheet that he'd use to enter the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
"Looks like you don't lack Arcanum," said Murdock, the leader of the Grand Mighty race.
<br><br>
"As the leader of the Element Spirit Civilization, Master Eye Spirit doesn't lack in these things," Tate said.
<br><br>
"Cut the crap. Go ahead. Enter the Ghost Mountain!" Claire said, throwing them a disapproving glance.
<br><br>
"Do we need to enter the Ghost Mountain too?" Murdock exclaimed, pretending to be surprised.
<br><br>
"We've been to the Ghost Mountain just a while ago. We don't need to go there again, do we?" Tate said nervously, unable to refuse outright.
<br><br>
The aboriginals of the Night View Island weren't stupid.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization was much more powerful than other races.
<br><br>
The only value that the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race held was to provide Arcana for the Element Spirit Civilization. But now they had lost all value now that the Element Spirit Civilization didn't need their Arcana.
<br><br>
They were nobodies now.
<br><br>
It must have been significant purpose if the Element Spirit Civilization had deigned to come.
<br><br>
Now, there was basically no possibility that these nobodies would survive.
<br><br>
Tate and Murdock didn't want to let the members of their races get involved in this trouble.
<br><br>
"Get in." Claire's voice became colder, a ray of red light flashing on her fingertip and the temperature quickly rising.
<br><br>
Tate and Murdock looked at each other, finding helplessness in the other's eyes. They could only lead the members of their races to exchange for the glazed sheets and enter the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Once the Snake Goddess and the other warriors had entered the Ghost Mountain, they found that Zen and the rest hadn't entered yet. So they waited at the entrance, not budging from their spot.
<br><br>
The interior of the Ghost Mountain was pretty simple.
<br><br>
After entering through the stone door, they found an open space just a few feet from the door. It was pitch-dark.
<br><br>
"What the hell are Zen and the others doing? Why haven't they come in yet?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi was confused.
<br><br>
After all, they were able to pass through the stone door in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
After a while, they saw Decker, Thurston, and Sawyer passing through the stone door one after the other, panic written large on their faces.
<br><br>
"What happened?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"A big eye!" Decker said fearfully.
<br><br>
"Big eye?"
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others were confused. The door turned again, and Zen came in. "It's the Eye Spirit. They have come."
<br><br>
Everyone's expressions shifted at Zen's words.
<br><br>
They had known that the Element Spirit Civilization would enter the Night View Island, but they hadn't expected the Eye Spirit to come in person.
<br><br>
Being blocked in the Ghost Mountain by the Eye Spirit meant that they would have no way to escape.
<br><br>
"Is there any other exit in the Ghost Mountain?" King Ieuan asked. It wanted to escape as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Bacchus's face darkened as he heard the conversation and understood that a strong enemy was coming for them. He shook his head and said, "Yes.
<br><br>
There is an identical stone door at the back of the Ghost Mountain."
<br><br>
"Where does the stone door lead to?" King Ieuan squeaked, hope glimmering in its eyes.
<br><br>
"It leads to the void, and all the creatures that enter the void will disappear,"
<br><br>
answered Bacchus. . King Ieuan was surprised into speechlessness.
<br><br>
It knew that the void was filled with Void Dust and that the creatures that approached the Void Dust would be devoured.
<br><br>
"How strong is the Eye Spirit you just mentioned?" Bacchus asked.
<br><br>
According to Bacchus, Zen and his group were very powerful. Even without the Holy Stones, their combat strength was still terrifying.
<br><br>
"He is powerful enough to dominate the entire Three Purities Stage," said Zen.
<br><br>
This answer silenced Bacchus. All these people from the outside were supernormal! "Let's look for the human beings in the Ghost Mountain," Zen said. "This is probably the only way."
<br><br>
Their journey to the Ghost Mountain had two goals.
<br><br>
On the one hand, they intended to fuse with the Treacherous Beings as Treacherous Beings could greatly increase their strength. On the other hand, they planned to search for the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other human beings.
<br><br>
Time was pressing in on them now that the Eye Spirit was hot on their heels. Merging with the Treacherous Beings might have to be postponed.
<br><br>
"I'll take you there!"
<br><br>
Bacchus said, turned around, and walked to the front, leading the way for the Glede Demons, Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
The area before them began to close up after they had passed through this open space.
<br><br>
The surroundings were pitch black but everyone could still clearly see that there were many Treacherous Beings floating on both sides of the road.
<br><br>
These Treacherous Beings varied in shapes, but were very small.
<br><br>
The biggest Treacherous Being was only half as tall as a person, and the smallest was the size of a palm.
<br><br>
The aura they emitted was neither strong nor aggressive. All of them were of the friendly type.
<br><br>
As Zen and the others passed by, they sensed the existence of the Arcana and surrounded them.
<br><br>
Chapter 4072 Deduction King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others remained on the alert.
<br><br>
They thought even the weaker Treacherous Beings couldn't be taken lightly.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons, however, were used to them.
<br><br>
Even Campbell, an awakened Treacherous Being, couldn't resist the temptation of the Arcana. How much more these unintelligent, friendly ones? More and more Treacherous Beings of grotesque shapes gathered around the group, almost completely blocking their way.
<br><br>
"Drive them away," Bacchus ordered.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons swung their blades and cut through the Treacherous Beings easily. The weaker ones were sliced into pieces. The friendly-type ones dodged and scampered in various directions.
<br><br>
Although they couldn't die, the creatures still instinctively evaded danger.
<br><br>
After clearing the way, the group continued onward.
<br><br>
The Ghost Mountain was already massive from the outside, almost as large as half of the Night View Island. Its inner space was even more spacious.
<br><br>
Up ahead, a row of square prison cells came into view. Beside the cells were stone tablets engraved with figures of different creatures.
<br><br>
"What are those creatures?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"They are also Treacherous Beings," Bacchus explained. "But unlike those outside, the Treacherous Beings here can be fused. You can enter the cells after imprinting the glazed sheets on the stone tablets."
<br><br>
Decker at the end of the line piped up, "The thorny Treacherous Beings our Wooden Leaf race have fused with are over there."
<br><br>
He pointed to a cell not far away. There was a pattern of Treacherous Being with poisonous spines on the stone tablet beside the cell.
<br><br>
"Only the weakest hostility-level Treacherous Beings are kept here," a Glede Demon pointed out disdainfully.
<br><br>
Of course the Wooden Leaf race would choose such low-level Treacherous Beings. The Glede Demons scoffed at such weaklings.
<br><br>
The gap in strength between the Treacherous Beings they preferred were quite large. Some top hostility-level Treacherous Beings were as strong as the resentment-level ones.
<br><br>
Among these were the Wolf Owls that the Glede Demons fused with. They were the strongest among the hostility-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
"Now we go to the far right," Bacchus pointed out.
<br><br>
Everyone followed behind Bacchus and entered the rightmost passageway.
<br><br>
After they entered, another row of square prison cells came into view.
<br><br>
Hostility-level Treacherous Beings were kept in these cells as well.
<br><br>
"Now we go to the passageway at the far left," said Bacchus.
<br><br>
The layout of the Ghost Mountain was obviously carefully designed.
<br><br>
Treacherous Beings were kept in rows upon rows of cells, and the passageway leading to the depths of the Ghost Mountain zigzagged from left to right.
<br><br>
Knowing the Element Spirit Civilization led by the Eye Spirit was very likely to chase after them, the group sped along the zigzag passageway.
<br><br>
"There are about a hundred prison cells in each row, where about a hundred kinds of hostility-level Treacherous Beings are kept. We have passed seven rows along the way, so seven hundred kinds of Treacherous Beings, too."
<br><br>
Surprise was written all over Eastern Emperor Taiyi's face.
<br><br>
He never imagined there were so many kinds of Treacherous Beings in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Bacchus smiled. "There are a total of six hundred rows. At the three hundredth row, there are two bypasses, which lead to the left and right regions of the Ghost Mountain."
<br><br>
"So there are tens of thousands of different kinds of Treacherous Beings in the Ghost Mountain?" Fuxi asked in surprise.
<br><br>
"We've calculated that there are one hundred and ten thousand kinds of hostility-level Treacherous Beings on this floor alone," answered Bacchus.
<br><br>
Everyone was stunned at the number.
<br><br>
King Ieuan turned its head and glanced at Decker. There were so many kinds of Treacherous Beings, yet the Wooden Leaf race only chose those on the first row. How pathetic! Noticing the gaze of King Ieuan, Decker could only smile helplessly. Given the lack of strength of the Wooden Leaf race, they could only choose the weakest Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
"Why are there so many?" the Snake Goddess asked, genuinely puzzled.
<br><br>
The creatures in the chaos could not become Treacherous Beings, after all.
<br><br>
All the Treacherous Beings came from outside the chaos.
<br><br>
So how could there be so many of them in the Ghost Mountain? "Someone must have captured about one hundred thousand kinds of creatures in the Abstruse Energy World and placed them here," Fuxi deduced.
<br><br>
"And they were all killed and transformed into Treacherous Beings..." Zen trailed off. He also didn't know the reason.
<br><br>
Why, indeed? To facilitate the fusion of creatures on the Night View Island with Treacherous Beings? It didn't make any sense.
<br><br>
"Perhaps the creatures captured from the Abstruse Energy World weren't originally meant to become Treacherous Beings," the Snake Goddess mused aloud.
<br><br>
"So what happened?"
<br><br>
Bacchus asked.
<br><br>
Even those from the Night View Island didn't know much about the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Over the years, they had just taken it for granted, not thinking deeply about how it came into being.
<br><br>
"Perhaps there was an extinction-triggering calamity in the Abstruse Energy World, and some people hid in the chaos to avoid it. At the same time, they brought the creatures from the Abstruse Energy World and built this mountain to hold them. Perhaps an accident caused all the creatures to die, so the Ghost Mountain became what it is today," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
"It's possible," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said, nodding.
<br><br>
Zen agreed. "That theory is probably close to the truth," he said.
<br><br>
It was very likely that there were no original intentions to turn creatures into Treacherous Beings. After all, they were all living creatures before they were brought here.
<br><br>
It took the group more than six hours to reach the last row at the bottom of the Ghost Mountain. Although they moved fast, the zigzag passageway impeded their speed, somewhat.
<br><br>
There were also one hundred prison cells in this last row. Zen finally spotted the tortoises the Red Demon race had fused with and the Wolf Owls the Glede Demon race had fused with.
<br><br>
At the end of the row of cells, there was a stairway paved with black stones.
<br><br>
The steps were several thousand feet high, leading up to the second floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
When they reached the second floor, more prison cells came into view.
<br><br>
However, these cells were larger.
<br><br>
The prison bars were quite thick, and through them, they could see the huge resentment-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
There was a giant elephant in the nearest cell.
<br><br>
Its attention was drawn by the arrival of Zen and his group.
<br><br>
Its long trunk stretched out from the space between the bars and slowly swept toward them. It looked friendly and kind.
<br><br>
Friendly-type Treacherous Beings were not known to be aggressive, so Fuxi reached out his hand to touch the elephant's trunk.
<br><br>
But just as he did, the elephant suddenly emitted a disgusting aura! The auras released by friendly-type Treacherous Beings were not strong, and could even be negligible. But the killing-type and attaching-type Treacherous Beings emanated extremely disgusting auras.
<br><br>
Fuxi reacted quickly. As soon as he felt the aura, he immediately jumped tens of feet back. Zen and the others likewise quickly distanced themselves from the cell where the giant elephant was imprisoned.
<br><br>
The elephant continued to try to reach Fuxi with its trunk.
<br><br>
But it was a moment too late. It failed to grab him.
<br><br>
HOWL! The enraged elephant roared in its cell.
<br><br>
"Didn't you say the Treacherous Beings in the Ghost Mountain were all friendly-type?" Pearson asked gravely.
<br><br>
Chapter 4073 Out Of Contact "It seems this giant elephant's obsession was triggered by humans,"
<br><br>
Bacchus remarked as he stared at the giant elephant in the cell.
<br><br>
The erstwhile gentle giant had transformed completely into a killing machine, raging at the prison bars wildly.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the prison was made of a special material. The thick bars remained steadfast even after relentlessly being struck by the massive creature.
<br><br>
"By us? What do you mean?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"It's possible that humans killed the giant elephant, but it had forgotten this, so it wasn't beset with hatred just a while ago. It appears it has been awakened upon seeing you, turning it into a killing type instantly," said Bacchus.
<br><br>
"Humans killed it?" The Snake Goddess thought for a moment and then shook her head. "The Ghost Mountain must have come into being much earlier than the human race, unless..."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess tilted her head to look at Campbell.
<br><br>
There were almost no differences between a human being and a human spirit. It was likely that the giant elephant's obsession was triggered by human spirits.
<br><br>
"Now I'm wondering if all the resentment-level Treacherous Beings are like this," Fuxi said worriedly.
<br><br>
He had come to the Ghost Mountain because he had wanted to fuse with a powerful Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
But if all the Treacherous Beings wanted to kill humans, then that would be impossible.
<br><br>
This obviously also weighed heavily on everyone's mind. "We can test it.
<br><br>
I'm not a human. Let me try touching them," Pearson offered.
<br><br>
"Good idea," Zen said with a nod.
<br><br>
But the Snake Goddess suddenly whipped around. "It's not the right time, though."
<br><br>
Zen followed her gaze and saw about six small eyeballs floating up to the entrance of the second floor. As soon as they spotted Zen and the others, they started speeding toward them.
<br><br>
"Right. Hold that thought," Zen said.
<br><br>
"Run!" Thurston shouted.
<br><br>
No one needed to be told twice. The group began to run.
<br><br>
The second floor of the Ghost Mountain was quite spacious.
<br><br>
The first floor was at the bottom of the Ghost Mountain, and it was larger than the second floor. More than a hundred thousand kinds of Treacherous Beings were imprisoned on the first floor, and there were over a hundred of each kind.
<br><br>
On the second floor, there were only a few thousand resentment-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
A few thousand huge prison cells were distributed equidistantly on the second floor, and the passageways separated by the prisons extended in all directions.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Everyone knew the strength of the Element Spirit Civilization, so no one dared face the eyeballs head on.
<br><br>
As they ran, they constantly changed directions, trying to lose the flying eyeballs.
<br><br>
However, the small eyeballs were not only very flexible but also extremely fast.
<br><br>
They moved as fast as Zen and the others, and there seemed to be no way they could outrun them.
<br><br>
"Soldiers, swallow those eyeballs!" Bacchus ordered the Glede Demon race.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had already drawn the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race over to their side. The Glede Demon race was thus on the same boat with these humans, so they, too, needed to escape this.
<br><br>
The Glede Demons stopped sprinting. They flapped their wings in the opposite direction. Their speed quickly dropped before they sped straight toward the eyeballs.
<br><br>
They pecked the eyeballs fiercely with their beaks before swallowing them whole.
<br><br>
"Did they do it? Squeak!" King Ieuan was too apprehensive to look back.
<br><br>
"Those eyeballs used for detecting shouldn't be that difficult to deal with..."
<br><br>
But before Bacchus could finish, the necks of the Glede Demons who had swallowed the eyeballs suddenly twisted, their bodies contorting out of shape.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Blood spurted from the broken necks of the Glede Demons. The eyeballs sped back out.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Bacchus was so outraged that he couldn't speak. He had personally chosen those soldiers because they were the elites of his race, but they were killed so easily! When Fuxi and the others saw what the eyeballs were capable of, their faces darkened.
<br><br>
It was never a good thing to be targeted by the Eye Spirit, and it seemed these small eyeballs were just as ruthless.
<br><br>
Zen watched as the eyeballs sped toward them again, trailing after the last person in the team. An idea flashed in his mind then. "Everyone, stop!"
<br><br>
"Stop? Why?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"Just do as I say!"
<br><br>
Zen barked out.
<br><br>
Although everyone was bewildered by it, they still did as Zen asked.
<br><br>
The six small eyeballs were floating not too far away from them. They stared at the group menacingly.
<br><br>
"These eyeballs are acting according to the orders of the Eye Spirit. If you were the Eye Spirit, what would you do after releasing these eyeballs?"
<br><br>
Zen asked the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Order them to find the target, follow it, and deliver back what they see,"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess replied.
<br><br>
"Right." Zen nodded. "But the eyeballs wouldn't be able to directly relay what they see to the Eye Spirit. He can only see the necklace with ten wolf teeth."
<br><br>
Hearing this, everyone immediately got into thinking.
<br><br>
Spiritual sense couldn't be used on the Night View Island, so it wasn't possible that these eyeballs were being controlled remotely. They were then likely only mechanically executing prior orders of the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
"So these eyeballs could be lured away?" Fuxi asked.
<br><br>
"We can give it a try."
<br><br>
Pearson walked straight to the end of the team.
<br><br>
As expected, the small eyeballs diverted their full attention on him.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Pearson quickly took out a huge Grass Bull from his spirit beast bag.
<br><br>
The Grass Bull was asleep. Pearson reached out his hand and slapped it on the buttocks. Startled awake, the creature let out a moo and scampered away.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The small eyeballs followed it, quickly leaving the group alone.
<br><br>
King Ieuan breathed a sigh of relief. "Squeak! It's a good thing the spiritual sense can't be used here, then."
<br><br>
Danger averted, the group continued walking through the second floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on the first floor, the Eye Spirit was left suffering because of the ring-shaped pattern of the ten wolf teeth.
<br><br>
This endeavor was causing him intense pain.
<br><br>
The problem was that he had released over a hundred eyeballs.
<br><br>
But when he tried to communicate with them, he found that all of them were out of contact.
<br><br>
Over a hundred patterns of wolf teeth surfaced continuously, and the Eye Spirit endured over a hundred times of pain.
<br><br>
This was causing their side much delay.
<br><br>
"Can't you communicate with the eyeballs?" Claire asked.
<br><br>
Pain flashed in the Eye Spirit's eyes. "No, I can't. And the Ten Teeth Necklace is really punishing me."
<br><br>
Claire didn't say anything.
<br><br>
She knew that the Ten Teeth Necklace was the Monkey Spirit King's obsession, and the Eye Spirit was unable to put up any resistance.
<br><br>
"There is only one path through the Ghost Mountain. Let's just go straight to the Ghost Altar at the deepest part on the second floor. We will definitely be able to find them there," Tate suggested.
<br><br>
He knew that Bacchus would be with Zen and the others. With the Element Spirit Civilization now on his side, however, he might be able to kill them all this time.
<br><br>
"Right. They're probably heading to the Ghost Altar," Murdock echoed.
<br><br>
"Go ahead. Lead the way," the Eye Spirit hissed amid the pain.
<br><br>
Chapter 4074 Selection The passageways in the second floor and the first floor of the Ghost Mountain ran in opposing directions.
<br><br>
The Ghost Altar at the innermost side of the second floor was right above the entrance to the first floor.
<br><br>
Because Zen and his group walked in a straight line on the second floor, the actual moving distance was several times shorter than the moving distance on the first floor. Their speed naturally increased greatly.
<br><br>
It took them six hours to pass through the first floor and only one hour through the second floor.
<br><br>
They passed through an area full of prisons which led to a high black wall.
<br><br>
On the center of the black wall was a red arch covered with golden copper nails.
<br><br>
"Here we are. Inside the copper gate is the Ghost Altar," said Bacchus.
<br><br>
"We can see human beings in the Ghost Altar?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"It's possible. I've seen the human Great Ghost Priests two times recently,"
<br><br>
Bacchus replied.
<br><br>
A total of twelve Great Ghost Priests took charge of the Ghost Altar and the several human Great Ghost Priests were likely to be chosen as one of the twelve.
<br><br>
"Then we are rest assured," Fuxi nodded.
<br><br>
Bacchus thought for a moment. "But there are also exceptions. There have been several times that no human beings have appeared," he continued.
<br><br>
There were about sixty Great Ghost Priests in the Ghost Mountain, and four of them came from the human race. The probability of choosing human beings from the sixty Great Ghost Priests was one-fifteenth.
<br><br>
Zen interrupted, "The probability of being selected as a Great Ghost Priest is low, right?"
<br><br>
"Very. It's lucky if we succeed after hundreds of attempts. We have participated in the event so many times, but we still haven't figured out the rules. It seems that being chosen is completely determined by the preference of the twelve Great Ghost Priests and the hatred-level Treacherous Beings..." said Bacchus.
<br><br>
"Then that's no problem. Since it's difficult to merge with a hatred-level Treacherous Being, let's try a few more times before the human Great Ghost Priests get a chance to be chosen," Zen encouraged.
<br><br>
he said while he walked forward.
<br><br>
He stepped towards the red arch, stretched out his hands, and pushed the gate inward.
<br><br>
"Clatter..."
<br><br>
The gate opened noisily as pitch-black darkness revealed from the inside.
<br><br>
The group went in and saw that the ground was painted with leaf-shaped glowing lines. The lines were dim, making them only slightly visible.
<br><br>
However, when Zen leaned forward to touch the glowing lines, a ray of bright light transmitted along all the lines drawn on the ground. It was like a seed of fire that lit up the path it went.
<br><br>
The light split into three parts which climbed up the surrounding pillars. It then connected to three huge radiant pearls, illuminating the entire Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
It was a circular hall with twelve entrances above it. These were the positions of the twelve Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
The Ghost Altar was currently closed as the entrances remained empty.
<br><br>
In the center of the circular hall stood a pillar that was half a person tall.
<br><br>
Above it was a round white stone ball. The stone ball had three holes on top appearing to have been specially carved out.
<br><br>
"How do we open the Ghost Altar?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Stand in the center of the Ghost Altar and attach the stone ball to the glazed sheet," said Bacchus. "You can send someone to do it."
<br><br>
"Let me do it!" Fuxi volunteered as he took a step ahead.
<br><br>
Certainly, he wouldn't let go of the opportunity to obtain power.
<br><br>
His cultivation had already reached the peak level of the Eternal Realm and his bloodline could not be changed. If he wanted to make a breakthrough, he could only change the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
There seemed to be many disadvantages of fusing with the Treacherous Beings. It would even cause the Treacherous Beings' counterattack, but being powerful had always been his goal.
<br><br>
Fuxi walked to the center of the circular hall following Bacchus' instruction.
<br><br>
He went closer to the pillar and connected the glazed sheet to the stone ball.
<br><br>
Buzz! The huge stone ball began to rotate, seeming like the gesture had woken it up.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The twelve entrances then glowed with blue light as it showed a connection to space channels.
<br><br>
A bunch of indefinite figures started to float out from the entrances. They were the Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
Zen, the Snake Goddess, and the others looked up excitedly, trying to detect the human beings among the Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
Among the thirty-nine human heroes, it was enough that only one of them appeared there! They searched eagerly as they looked around, yet to their dismay, they didn't find any human being. All of the Great Ghost Priests with strangelooking faces were from alien races.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests glanced back at them without a word, as if they were looking down at all living beings.
<br><br>
"No human beings." Zen shrugged.
<br><br>
It was normal not to see human beings as there was a slim chance of encountering them.
<br><br>
They turned to look at Fuxi again, wondering if he could fuse with a hatredlevel Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
As the stone ball continued to roll, white entities emerged from its three holes. The entities quickly dispersed, turning into a huge creature–a white bull with three horns.
<br><br>
"Moo!"
<br><br>
The white bull let out a roar.
<br><br>
An extremely terrifying aura reverberated throughout the circular hall, accompanied by indescribable pressure.
<br><br>
"This is the hatred-level Treacherous Being. What appears now is only its avatar, not its real body!" Bacchus's eyes were filled with excitement.
<br><br>
The hatred-level Treacherous Being! Everyone gasped as their hearts raced with fear.
<br><br>
Fortunately, this bull was of the friendly type and its frightening aura was still weak. Otherwise, bearing its aura would be a problem for everyone.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests suddenly began to clamor after the white bull's sound.
<br><br>
"How could there be human beings here? This can't be!"
<br><br>
"I won't allow a human being to be the Great Ghost Priest..."
<br><br>
"It's not good to provoke these guys..."
<br><br>
"I don't agree!"
<br><br>
"No way..."
<br><br>
All the Great Ghost Priests from above the circular hall rejected Fuxi with a unified voice.
<br><br>
Hearing the complaints of the Great Ghost Priests, Fuxi asked loudly, "What's the problem? Why don't you agree?"
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests turned around coldly and disappeared back into the space channels.
<br><br>
"Everyone, can you tell me the reason?" Fuxi insisted, waving his hand helplessly.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the Great Ghost Priests had all left.
<br><br>
The unknown bull with three horns also returned into the stone ball.
<br><br>
Fuxi hung his head down, soon retreating from the center of the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
"It's normal to fail to be chosen as the Great Ghost Priest. I've tried many times, but I haven't succeeded even once," comforted Bacchus.
<br><br>
"I think they have a prejudice against the human race," said Fuxi as his lips curled into a frown.
<br><br>
Decker suddenly asked, "Isn't the process of choosing the Great Ghost Priest simple? Everyone can have a try, right?"
<br><br>
Bacchus glared at Decker and said, "The Ghost Altar itself is used for the natural process of selection. Of course, it doesn't need to be complicated."
<br><br>
"Then why don't you let the members of our Wooden Leaf race have a try? Why did you say that only a creature that has fused with the resentmentlevel Treacherous Being could get a chance?" Decker asked gloomily.
<br><br>
A Glede Demon beside Decker sneered, "If everyone wants to try on the second floor of the Ghost Mountain, won't the status of our three races be easily affected?"
<br><br>
The Grand Mighty race, the Red Demon race, and the Glede Demon race had always fiercely competed with each other.
<br><br>
However, they cooperated very well in keeping the secret of the second floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
According to the normal process, the soldiers of the Red Demon race, the Glede Demon race and the Grand Mighty race stood guard in front of the Ghost Mountain. If members of other races entered the Ghost Mountain, they would be escorted by the members of these three races.
<br><br>
Ordinary races could enter the first floor and the second floor.
<br><br>
As long as they were able to merge with a hostility-level Treacherous Being or even a resentment-level Treacherous Being, they wouldn't be stopped by the three races.
<br><br>
However, the races weren't allowed to enter the Ghost Altar. The three races had also declared that to become the Great Ghost Priest, one had to challenge a resentment-level or even a hatred-level Treacherous Being. If the warriors failed to be careful, they would be killed during the battle.
<br><br>
The races of the Night View Island were skeptical of the process, but they didn't dare challenge the three races.
<br><br>
Bacchus saw that Decker was displeased. "Although luck is a big factor during the selection of the Great Ghost Priest, one's strength also affects the Treacherous Being's choice. Go ahead and try if you are not convinced," he said as he waved his wings.
<br><br>
Chapter 4075 Cary This time, their reason for coming to the Ghost Altar had nothing to do with becoming Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
It didn't matter who went up to the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
Even a guy like Decker would do.
<br><br>
As long as there was no human among the twelve Great Ghost Priests, it would always prove difficult for them to touch base with the human heroes.
<br><br>
Besides, with Decker's physique, even if the twelve Great Ghost Priests agreed, the hatred-level Treacherous Being that Decker would fuse with probably would not.
<br><br>
Although Decker's face showed a trace of indignation, he was actually thrilled deep inside.
<br><br>
If he were to be honest, when he found out that the Great Ghost Priests were chosen simply by luck, he felt a sudden pang of resentment.
<br><br>
Why were only members of the three great races allowed to enter the Ghost Altar all this time? Why were the other races disqualified from trying their luck? Then again, the Night View Island had always been that cruel.
<br><br>
The weak races never had a say.
<br><br>
It was just a matter of course for the Red Demon race, the Glede Demon race, and the Grand Mighty race to control the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
However, now he had a chance.
<br><br>
The chance was slim, of course, but he was still willing to give it a shot.
<br><br>
Without any objection from Zen and the others, Decker hurriedly stepped into the center of the platform and pressed the glazed sheet in his hand against the stone ball.
<br><br>
Splash! The stone ball began to rotate.
<br><br>
Rays of blue light flashed at the twelve entrances above the Ghost Altar as another twelve Great Ghost Priests were selected.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze quickly swept across the twelve. His face fell in disappointment.
<br><br>
There were all sorts of creatures in strange shapes, but there were still no humans.
<br><br>
The twelve Great Ghost Priests looked down at Decker with disdain.
<br><br>
There was actually no strict required strength to come up to the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
However, the Night View Island and the Ghost Mountain had followed the law of the jungle all this time, so only the strongest could go up to the Ghost Altar until now.
<br><br>
Thus, the Great Ghost Priests all used to be among the best of Night View Island.
<br><br>
Decker was much too weak in comparison.
<br><br>
"I haven't gone out for many years, but have the Night View Island's standards fallen so low?" a Great Ghost Priest lamented.
<br><br>
"Such a loser dares to come up to the Ghost Altar? How shameless,"
<br><br>
another Great Ghost Priest mocked.
<br><br>
"We disagree!"
<br><br>
"We object!"
<br><br>
"We object!"
<br><br>
Most of the Great Ghost Priests actually didn't care about what happened in the outside world.
<br><br>
So unless their interest was piqued, no matter who went up to the Ghost Altar, they would object to the applicant almost by default.
<br><br>
To become a Great Ghost Priest, one had to gain the approval of at least eight of the twelve Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
Decker, like Fuxi, had just been rejected.
<br><br>
The difference was that Fuxi was rejected because he was human. Decker was rejected because he was too weak. Decker, in fact, was rejected more quickly.
<br><br>
As the Great Ghost Priests vetoed Decker's application, a white Treacherous Being burrowed out from the stone ball.
<br><br>
He turned out to be a hedgehog, not as ferocious-looking as other Treacherous Beings. He was actually quite adorable with his small round body.
<br><br>
This hatred-level Treacherous Being was very excited to have finally come out.
<br><br>
He had always been very interested in the outside world.
<br><br>
He roamed the Ghost Altar for a few moments before he began to be drawn to the creature standing on the altar. The creature's hand was emitting a strange aura, which somehow made the hedgehog feel at peace.
<br><br>
He approached Decker and put his sharp nose in Decker's hand, greedily sniffing the aura.
<br><br>
Most Treacherous Beings were attracted to the Arcana, and this hedgehog was no exception.
<br><br>
All the Treacherous Beings that appeared on the Ghost Altar were at the hatred level.
<br><br>
They were all very powerful when they were alive. Even after they died, they continued to possess this strength. They usually proved the hardest to lure.
<br><br>
However, this hedgehog was different from other hatred-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Other hatred-level Treacherous Beings were either powerhouses in the Abstruse Energy World or core figures in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
The hedgehog, however, was a pet when he was alive.
<br><br>
He had belonged to Orlando, the Monkey Spirit King. His name was Cary.
<br><br>
As Orlando's pet, his strength was undoubtedly extraordinary.
<br><br>
However, he had spent most his life just curling up beside Orlando, never having the chance to fight anyone. He had always been but a sheltered pet, unfamiliar with the ways of the world.
<br><br>
After death, Cary did not change much. He still stayed beside his master as a friendly-type Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
He rarely appeared on the third floor of the Ghost Mountain, so only a few of the Great Ghost Priests knew of his existence.
<br><br>
This time, however, he had left his master by accident as he was unintentionally drawn out.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests suddenly realized that there was a Treacherous Being that they had never seen before, now nuzzling Decker at the center of the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
"What is that?"
<br><br>
"Is there such a Treacherous Being on the third floor?"
<br><br>
"I don't remember."
<br><br>
"I'm sure he doesn't live here."
<br><br>
"Just take him back."
<br><br>
The twelve Great Ghost Priests had a way to control the hatred-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
The stone ball began to rotate again, this time, trying to re-absorb Cary.
<br><br>
Normally, hatred-level Treacherous Beings would not resist.
<br><br>
However, Cary was an exception. He had now moved on to sniff Decker's glazed sheet, trying to get close to him.
<br><br>
But Decker acted differently.
<br><br>
Although the hedgehog's aura was not strong, he knew if he unsheathed his claws, he would still be able to easily kill him.
<br><br>
Decker grew pale as he gritted his teeth and tried to keep himself from trembling.
<br><br>
When Cary realized that the stone ball was trying to suck him back, his eyes flashed with a sharp light.
<br><br>
His body rolled into a half circle, his nose never leaving Decker's hand. He ejected a sharp spine from his back and toward the stone ball.
<br><br>
Crack! The stone ball was penetrated.
<br><br>
Countless cracks appeared on its surface.
<br><br>
It was broken just like that! The Great Ghost Priests above the Ghost Altar were stunned at the sight.
<br><br>
This white round stone ball was a sacred object in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
But the hedgehog destroyed it so easily! Though extremely frightened, Decker had realized something.
<br><br>
This hedgehog liked the Arcana very much.
<br><br>
This was the foundation to the fusion with Treacherous Beings! Decker had never fused with resentment-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings before. He had only ever fused with a hostility-level one, which was the weakest level. But he gathered the fusion method should be the same.
<br><br>
"Do you like this?" Decker asked the hedgehog, summoning up all his courage.
<br><br>
Cary rubbed against the glazed sheet and nodded.
<br><br>
"Then you can integrate yourself into it,"
<br><br>
Decker encouraged.
<br><br>
He offered the glazed sheet carefully, luring Cary into it.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were quite special.
<br><br>
They could be solid enough to resist any attack, but they could also turn into the softest form in the world, compressing themselves into the size of a palm.
<br><br>
Cary purred.
<br><br>
He was quite obedient.
<br><br>
His body turned liquid-like and quickly flowed into the glazed sheet.
<br><br>
Chapter 4076 No Way Back "Wait. What just happened?"
<br><br>
The Glede Demons standing on the edge of the Ghost Altar were utterly dumbfounded. They couldn't believe their own eyes.
<br><br>
Bacchus personally handpicked these Glede Demons to join the team. They were regarded as the elites of their race.
<br><br>
Over the past couple of years, all of them had the opportunity of going onto the Ghost Altar. In fact, they had been there several times already. However, all attempts proved to be unsuccessful.
<br><br>
Bacchus stood on the edge of the Ghost Altar with his eyes wide in shock.
<br><br>
His entire body was trembling. This was unbelievable! He had a difficult time processing what he had just witnessed.
<br><br>
It was absolutely surreal! All of the Great Ghost Priests had rejected Decker. Naturally, they didn't quite expect that the hatred-level Treacherous Being would be willing to fuse with Decker's Arcana.
<br><br>
This was preposterous! Never in the history of Night View Island had this kind of thing occurred.
<br><br>
They originally deemed it impossible.
<br><br>
Bacchus was keenly observing the reactions of the Great Ghost Priests. He noticed that they were undeniably flabbergasted as well. The complication must have originated from the Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
At that very moment, he felt a sudden desire to take this hatred-level Treacherous Being away.
<br><br>
Based on his observation, the Treacherous Being had become attracted to only the Arcana. Surely, he wouldn't be interested in a good-for-nothing like Decker.
<br><br>
But in the end, Bacchus managed to suppress the strong urge to do so. He just kept monitoring the situation and stayed silent.
<br><br>
He knew that if he enraged the Treacherous Being, he would probably die a horrific and miserable death. He didn't dare to take the risk.
<br><br>
In the meantime, all he could do was watch the large hedgehog as he merged with the glazed sheet. Soon after, Decker closed it.
<br><br>
"Is that... Is that it? Is it done?" Fuxi asked aloud while staring wide-eyed at the glazed sheet.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, this was the actual way of fusing with resentment-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
The Arcana could easily be used to lure the Treacherous Beings. As long as one could do it, fusing with them would be possible.
<br><br>
Needless to say, this would only be the first step.
<br><br>
If they wanted the Treacherous Beings to have fighting power and stick with them through life and death, they first had to train these creatures for a long period of time.
<br><br>
"Does this mean... Does this Treacherous Being belong to me now?"
<br><br>
Decker looked around and sought answer from the ones present.
<br><br>
However, no one answered him. The twelve Great Ghost Priests were still completely stunned.
<br><br>
Out of the blue, one of the Great Ghost Priests shouted. He had a sudden recollection of something he saw before. "I remember now! I know I have seen that hedgehog somewhere before! That is the Ghost Master's pet! Do you remember? Think hard!"
<br><br>
"You're right! It's Cary! That hedgehog is Cary!"
<br><br>
"That really is the Ghost Master's pet! How can I forget?"
<br><br>
All at once, the other Great Ghost Priests were reminded of the same memory.
<br><br>
There was an enormous painting hanging in the depths of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
The portrait was of a gigantic monkey. This was the renowned master of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests referred to this huge monkey as the "Ghost Master".
<br><br>
The magnificent painting portrayed the Ghost Master sitting with his legs astride. One of his hands was spread out in front of him. There at his palm laid a little hedgehog.
<br><br>
They deeply acknowledged the Ghost Master's authority. Naturally, they were afraid of him. Hence, they rarely made attempts to study the portrait carefully. Most of the time, they merely sneaked glances at it.
<br><br>
They had been quite oblivious to the little hedgehog in the painting.
<br><br>
Because they didn't pay too much attention to him, they almost forgot about his existence.
<br><br>
But now, one of them finally remembered it. Quite possibly, all of those stolen glances had gotten him ingrained in his subconscious mind.
<br><br>
This meant that the hedgehog was not one of the hatred-level Treacherous Beings waiting to be selected on the third floor. Rather, he was the Ghost Master's pet.
<br><br>
Knowing this, how could they allow Decker to take the hedgehog? "Hand over the Treacherous Being at once!"
<br><br>
one of the Great Ghost Priests demanded. "We cannot allow you to take him away!"
<br><br>
At that point, a diamond-shaped glazed sheet suddenly flashed in between the Great Ghost Priest's eyebrows.
<br><br>
Looked inside, the glazed sheet appeared jet black. It also seemed as though there was a black snake lurking behind it.
<br><br>
They were now aware that this priest's Treacherous Being was black.
<br><br>
Swoosh! They heard a sudden rush of air.
<br><br>
Afterwards, they felt an awfully terrifying aura. It was emanating from the glazed sheet.
<br><br>
The menacing aura was so strong that it seemed tangible as it loomed all over the entire hall.
<br><br>
As soon as Decker sensed this aura, he felt thoroughly anxious and terrified.
<br><br>
The corners of his mouth were trembling from fear. "Of course. I'll release the hedgehog right away," he answered. He had no other choice. This was quite a predicament. He had no intention of angering the Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
"You saw it with your own eyes.
<br><br>
Even you can tell that I didn't ask the hedgehog to come in.
<br><br>
He came in by himself," Decker explained as he proceeded to release the hedgehog.
<br><br>
He hurriedly shook the glazed sheet in an attempt to throw Cary out. His trembling hands did not make this task any easier.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Cary was not under his control yet. He remained motionlessly hidden inside the glazed sheet. Decker was starting to panic now.
<br><br>
Under the fierce stares of the twelve Great Ghost Priests, he was now being filled with crippling anxiety.
<br><br>
He even tried to pull the glazed sheet apart. But alas! His strength was still weaker than Cary's so he failed miserably.
<br><br>
Seeing that the Great Ghost Priests were now looking angry, Decker pleaded, "He refuses to come out. I can't get him out."
<br><br>
"The solution is plain and simple. Just hand your glazed sheet to me. Now."
<br><br>
After he spoke, a Great Ghost Priest jumped down and forcefully grabbed Decker's glazed sheet.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to leave, another Great Ghost Priest intervened, "Bainbridge, don't you think it's against the rules for you to take away his glazed sheet like this?"
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests had every right to express their disagreement on the matter. However, they were not allowed to take away the Treacherous Beings and Arcana of others.
<br><br>
"Well, it's also against the rules for him to fuse with the hatred-level Treacherous Being like this," returned Bainbridge coldly.
<br><br>
"We will just let the Ghost Face race be the judge of this. Take this fellow with you," the Great Ghost Priest suggested.
<br><br>
"I have to take him with me?" Bainbridge replied with a frown on his face.
<br><br>
Normally, anyone who had fused with a hatred-level Treacherous Being would immediately be brought to the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Because the hatred-level Treacherous Beings that appeared on the second floor were merely avatars of the real ones.
<br><br>
In Bainbridge's opinion, Decker was definitely not qualified to go to the third floor.
<br><br>
There were strict rules within the Ghost Mountain. Knowing this, he had no other option but to lift Decker up and fly towards the sky.
<br><br>
"Now that the stone is broken, the Ghost Altar will not be able to select the Great Ghost Priests for a while. Please go back," Bainbridge said as he glanced indifferently at the crowd below.
<br><br>
When they heard this, Zen and the others were shocked. What was happening? Just like that, Decker would be taken away. There were no other explanations. They didn't even get the chance to negotiate.
<br><br>
Moreover, there would be no selection of Great Ghost Priests for the time being.
<br><br>
This meant that they wouldn't meet any human Great Ghost Priest.
<br><br>
If they went back now, they would definitely encounter the Eye Spirit and his people. They would walk into a dead end.
<br><br>
"Sirs, I implore you," Zen said in a loud voice while cupping his hands.
<br><br>
"We have traveled long to look for the humans in the Ghost Mountain. Can you please help me notify them?"
<br><br>
Almost simultaneously, all of the Great Ghost Priests focused their attention on Zen.
<br><br>
In fact, they had already been secretly paying attention to him as soon as they appeared.
<br><br>
They were instantly able to sense a strange and powerful aura from him.
<br><br>
Each of them thought that if Zen were to stand on the Ghost Altar, they would be very happy to let him pass and become a Great Ghost Priest.
<br><br>
However, Zen's identity would be the biggest obstacle. He was a human.
<br><br>
These Great Ghost Priests were on bad terms with the human race. They had poor relationships with them for a long time.
<br><br>
Bainbridge sneered as he heard Zen's plea, "Oh, those humans are so lofty and illustrious. There's no way ordinary creatures like us can talk to them."
<br><br>
It was apparent that his voice dripped with sarcasm.
<br><br>
The other Great Ghost Priests laughed derisively. They obviously hated the human race very much.
<br><br>
Just as the Great Ghost Priests were about to enter the space channels, the door was pushed open once more.
<br><br>
The door was opened by a suit of armor.
<br><br>
Floating right next to it was an eyeball and an extremely beautiful woman.
<br><br>
The members of the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race were standing behind them.
<br><br>
The woman was Claire. She looked enchantingly at Zen. "I have originally taken a liking to a resentment-level Treacherous Being. But since I knew you were waiting here, I came here first."
<br><br>
As soon as Zen and his companions realized that it was Claire and the others, they quickly retreated to the other side of the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
He didn't expect to be put into the most troublesome situation at the most inconvenient time. Nothing was certainly going as planned.
<br><br>
Chapter 4077 Cyan Skin The Element Spirit Civilization's sudden arrival only served to increase the tension on the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
Tate simply shot Bacchus a smug look.
<br><br>
There was no need for word. A single look was all it took for him to say all that he needed to say.
<br><br>
'Since you chose the wrong side then this shall be your end...' Bacchus knew the possible consequences of his actions but that did not mean that he regretted it. He continued to look at Tate straight in the eye. If this was the end, then he would go down fighting.
<br><br>
For him, he never chose the wrong side but just ran out of choices.
<br><br>
Back when Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey came to the Night View Island, they immediately chose the Red Demon race as allies and instigated them to kill off the Glede Demon race.
<br><br>
If it were not for Zen and his group, then the entire Glede Demon race would've been exterminated by now.
<br><br>
Since their accidental saviours were forced into a dead end, the best way that the Glede Demon race could repay them was to stay and fight until the end.
<br><br>
Claire's eyes sparkled with excitement as she looked at the scene in front of her.
<br><br>
"We chased all the way from the Grand Pure Realm and finally it came to an end..."
<br><br>
She had no animosity with Zen and his group even if she suffered defeat by their hands.
<br><br>
The reason why she was so excited was because she had failed so many times before yet now, victory was so close that she could almost taste it.
<br><br>
Claire felt like a fisherman stuck out at sea but unable to catch the elusive fishes needed to come back to shore.
<br><br>
But now, the fishes she so desperately sought for finally got tangled in her net. It was now time to haul them all in.
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, a crack suddenly appeared on her right shoulder.
<br><br>
In the crack where her flesh should've been, there was only flames. It was like the cracked surface of a volcano where molten magma raged on.
<br><br>
From within this fiery crack rose a small, white dragon.
<br><br>
Despite looking so small and ordinary, this dragon actually contained a strange and powerful aura.
<br><br>
"Grrr..."
<br><br>
It circled Claire once before facing off against Zen and his group.
<br><br>
Claire reached out to touch her dragon's body and the formerly white scales promptly turned into red, set ablaze by her aura! She knew of the fact that Zen had Holy Stones and could use the Light of Annihilation so she quickly took the necessary measures. This little dragon with its red, scaled armor would now be able to face-off against these humans with no problems.
<br><br>
"Kill them all," she ordered in a cold voice.
<br><br>
Yes, she harbored them no hatred but she did remember how Zen refused her kind offer several times before. Perhaps there was a part within her that felt just a bit bitter about that.
<br><br>
Since he was so ungrateful, then he could only meet his end this way.
<br><br>
"Grrr!"
<br><br>
The dragon roared and headed straight towards the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
Of course, even if things did not seem to go their way, Zen and his companions weren't going to sit still and wait for death! They immediately mobilized as their opponent came rushing at them.
<br><br>
Fuxi, who held a Holy Stone, raised his hand and cast a mark of Eight Diagrams to appear on the surface of the little dragon.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, meanwhile, condensed her crimson shadows into one, long spear that spiraled at high speed and headed straight towards their oncoming opponent.
<br><br>
So long as they broke through those red, dragon scales and then used the Light of Annihilation, then they would have a chance of winning. At least, that was what they thought.
<br><br>
Bang! Phew! However, what happened was the opposite of their expectations.
<br><br>
Even with the combined force of Fuxi's Eight Diagrams and the Snake Goddess's spear, the dragon's red scales remained unyielding and could not be penetrated at all.
<br><br>
There was no way the Light of Annihilation could do its job of annihilating their opponent if this little dragon's armor was too tough to break.
<br><br>
Despite this hurdle, the two of them reacted immediately.
<br><br>
Since their first attack failed, they retreated right away.
<br><br>
King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin rushed over to fight.
<br><br>
Whoosh! With their combined efforts, the group was able to rain down a series of attacks and sword radiance upon this troublesome little dragon.
<br><br>
Yasamin's Origin Swordsmanship shone the most since it was almost incomparable in terms of power and speed in the chaos.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, despite their efforts, the little dragon's defensive armor remained intact.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi and King Ieuan both used their bloodline theurgies and Other Shore Tokens yet were still unable to make a dent on the little dragon's flame scales.
<br><br>
It seemed that this time, the gap in strength was just a bit too great.
<br><br>
Claire suddenly remembered their battle back in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
She had relied on her own strength and struggled so hard against the siege of the Chaos Ancient Gods and several Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Now though, it seemed that the tables had turned. This little white dragon she controlled was infinitely stronger than all these Eternal Realm warriors and she was confident they would never be able to win against it.
<br><br>
It was a constant push and pull between them. As the group's attacks failed, they would retreat one step back.
<br><br>
Soon, they were forced into a dead end.
<br><br>
"Grrr!"
<br><br>
With its enemies cornered, the little dragon began to transform. Its body began to swell and its head rose to the sky.
<br><br>
"Let's fight together!"
<br><br>
Bacchus shouted.
<br><br>
Ready to give it his all, he released the resentment-level Treacherous Being, the Wolf Owl King from his body and let it wrap around him.
<br><br>
The other three Glede Demons followed suit and summoned their own Treacherous Beings. There was no other way but to go all out in this fight.
<br><br>
Zen, who was standing behind them, stepped forward.
<br><br>
"Let me deal with this," he said, pouncing on the dragon.
<br><br>
These Eternal Realm warriors were not a match for this little dragon.
<br><br>
Even if they managed to resist the dragon, there was still the Eye Spirit that continued to watch them covetously.
<br><br>
The human race in the Ghost Mountain was the only one Zen felt he could truly rely on.
<br><br>
However, they still remained a no-show.
<br><br>
Since that was the case, he could now only rely on the bloodline within his body.
<br><br>
It was time to use the ancestry-level bloodline! Claire's eyes curved in mirth when she saw Zen pounce onto her dragon.
<br><br>
This could all have been avoided if he had agreed with her back then, but since he refused then he was doomed to suffer death.
<br><br>
The little dragon was undeterred and patiently opened its jaw with the full intent of swallowing Zen whole.
<br><br>
Just as they were about to meet, a huge finger suddenly fell onto the Ghost Altar! "Boom!"
<br><br>
What could've been an epic showdown was promptly interrupted by the appearance of this sudden finger that separated both Zen and the little dragon.
<br><br>
It was a Great Ghost Priest! This Great Ghost Priest sported cyan skin and had eyes the shape of an inverted triangle. Two tusks protruded from his mouth and gave him an incredibly fierce look.
<br><br>
As he stretched out his finger, the Treacherous Being within his body made its move.
<br><br>
This finger that separated the two opponents came from the hatred-level Treacherous Being! "Fighting is prohibited in the Ghost Altar," the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest told them in an almost bored tone.
<br><br>
His announcement made all the other Great Ghost Priests look at him strangely.
<br><br>
Was there ever such a rule in place? The warriors from the many races on the Night View Island kept silent like a cicada in cold weather after they had entered the Ghost Mountain. There was no way they would dare break any rules here.
<br><br>
They didn't even dare to speak loudly, let alone fight at the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
Of course, the validity of this rule was still in question.
<br><br>
In truth, these Great Ghost Priests hated humans especially Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi since they had the same appearance as the humans in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
If anything, they would be very happy to see these troublemakers die.
<br><br>
The reason why they did not leave was because they personally wanted to see these humans die by the hands of these other fellows and send the news to the humans in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
However, even if a huge chunk of Great Ghost Priests hated humans, a small portion was in favor of them.
<br><br>
This cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest was actually one of them.
<br><br>
He was from the Jade Scale race and was a senior among the Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..."
<br><br>
Claire couldn't believe that this Great Ghost Priest actually expected her to listen. Despite his warning, she simply redirected the little dragon so that it would be able to swallow Zen.
<br><br>
It was quite a big mistake. "Boom!"
<br><br>
The huge finger pressed itself onto the little dragon's neck and nailed it onto the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
Claire simply looked on as the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest glared at her coldly.
<br><br>
Throughout the Night View Island's history, anybody who ever dared to go against a Great Ghost Priest ended up dead.
<br><br>
As the finger held down the little dragon, it struggled desperately in the Ghost Altar and the fire scales that covered its body began to break under the immense pressure.
<br><br>
There was no change in Claire's expression, meanwhile, the Eye Spirit decided to move.
<br><br>
"Sir, I think this would interest you very much."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, a wolf tooth began to emerge from the eyeball.
<br><br>
Chapter 4078 Decker's Courage The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest had already planned to kill Claire.
<br><br>
However, a chill ran down his spine, and his body violently trembled when he saw the wolf tooth that the Eye Spirit showed him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the other eleven Great Ghost Priests just watched everything for fun. However, they too got surprised when they saw the wolf tooth as well.
<br><br>
The creatures in the Night View Island had seen the necklace of wolf teeth in their minds.
<br><br>
There were very powerful fluctuations in the Night View Island every two hundred days and nights, even if they did not use their spiritual senses. On that day, no one could go out because the necklace of wolf teeth appeared in everyone's mind. That day was a day full of pain for all the creatures in the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Many legends about the wolf teeth had spread across the Night View Island.
<br><br>
It was said that they were the teeth of the master of Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Those ten teeth chewed up anyone who died into pieces.
<br><br>
Some creatures saw them as totems and worshipped them. After they captured their prey, they pulled out all their teeth and fashioned them into the shape of wolf teeth, then embedded them on tall totems.
<br><br>
As for the wolf teeth's real origin story, the people outside the Ghost Mountain did not know about it, unlike the Great Ghost Priests in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Their life's significance rested on those ten wolf teeth. They were their tasks and the Ghost Master's obsession.
<br><br>
Now, the reason the Ghost Master hadn't woken up yet was that he had lost these wolf teeth.
<br><br>
His obsession was to find his greatest magic treasure, the Thirteen Teeth Necklace.
<br><br>
As its name suggested, it was a necklace inlaid with thirteen wolf teeth.
<br><br>
However, the Thirteen Teeth Necklace had long been missing, and now, only three real teeth remained in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
After the creatures in the Night View Island fused with the hatred-level Treacherous Beings, they were led into a special hall. In the center of the hall was a wolf tooth.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests had to remember the aura of this wolf tooth, then find the other teeth.
<br><br>
It was an order from the Ghost Master.
<br><br>
Of course, the Ghost Master hadn't awakened and was still in a dead sleep.
<br><br>
Yet, he instinctively began to collect the wolf teeth! And his strategy was correct.
<br><br>
The Ghost Mountain was known for its richness in resources.
<br><br>
With the Ghost Mountain's support, the Great Ghost Priests who fused with the hatred-level Treacherous Beings could search the Three Purities Stage and find all the wolf teeth one by one.
<br><br>
At first, two Great Ghost Priests had completed their tasks and brought back two wolf teeth from the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, since the passageway of the Night View Island had gotten destroyed, they could not leave the island.
<br><br>
That was why there were only three wolf teeth in the mountain.
<br><br>
Naturally, the newly selected Great Ghost Priests felt dejected.
<br><br>
After all, they had searched every part of the Night View Island, but to no avail.
<br><br>
Because they could not find the wolf teeth, they were punished and imprisoned in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
That was why it was quite hard for the new Great Ghost Priests to leave the Ghost Mountain these years.
<br><br>
They suffered bitterly, while the Ghost Master himself had given up on himself. He had lost hope on awakening.
<br><br>
However, a group of strangers suddenly appeared, and one of them brought a wolf tooth. Of course, the Great Ghost Priests could not contain their excitement.
<br><br>
Their memories of the wolf tooth's aura were still fresh in their minds.
<br><br>
Just then, the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest's body trembled. He jumped down from the upper layer, then stooped down and smelled the wolf tooth.
<br><br>
"It's quite similar.
<br><br>
But the aura of the energy is different from that of the wolf tooth," he said.
<br><br>
Although he was also ecstatic, he was worried.
<br><br>
"Each wolf tooth contains bloodline power, and the bloodline of each wolf tooth is different. Thus, the aura of the energy is naturally different," the Eye Spirit explained.
<br><br>
"May I verify it?" the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest asked.
<br><br>
"Sure," said the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
He had a total of ten wolf teeth in his hands. Even if he gave the cyanskinned Great Ghost Priest one, he still had nine left.
<br><br>
"But there is one condition," said Claire.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Zen and the others felt their hearts sank.
<br><br>
When the Great Ghost Priests decided to intervene, he and the others finally felt hopeful.
<br><br>
If the Ghost Altar did not allow them to fight, they could stay and wait for the reinforcements of the human race.
<br><br>
However, now that the Eye Spirit brought out a wolf tooth of great importance, the tense situation toned down.
<br><br>
They did not need to think too much to know what condition Claire wanted.
<br><br>
"Let me guess. You want the lives of these people?" the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," Claire answered.
<br><br>
"Let's talk about it after I examine it," the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest said.
<br><br>
"We can wait," Claire said with a smile.
<br><br>
The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest nodded, then asked the question that all the Great Ghost Priests were concerned about, "How many wolf teeth do you have?"
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests' ultimate task was to gather the ten remaining wolf teeth.
<br><br>
"It depends on whether you guys cooperate or not," Claire said playfully.
<br><br>
In turn, the Great Ghost Priests became even more excited.
<br><br>
Did it mean that they had more than one wolf teeth in their hands? The Great Ghost Priests exchanged glances with each other.
<br><br>
They did not think that the Eye Spirit, Claire, and the Holy Wings Armor were powerful beings.
<br><br>
But now that these people were in their territory, would they just steal all the wolf teeth? The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest thought of the same thing.
<br><br>
Claire knew what went on in their minds, and her catty eyes glinted dangerously. "If you try to make a move, you will regret it. Our supporter is on par with the Ghost Master."
<br><br>
The twelve Great Ghost Priests present were stunned.
<br><br>
After a while of thought, they immediately understood what she meant.
<br><br>
If the Eye Spirit had dared to lead his people straight to the Ghost Mountain with the wolf teeth, then he must be quite confident.
<br><br>
"You must be kidding. We are very grateful to you because you brought the wolf teeth here in the Ghost Mountain. How can we do something against you? I'll verify it now," said the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest and looked at Zen and the others. 'I'm sorry, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
He originally wanted to protect them, but the tides turned entirely as soon as the wolf teeth were involved.
<br><br>
Not to mention Zen and his companions, even the status of the humans in the Ghost Mountain would decline.
<br><br>
At that moment, the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest brought the wolf tooth back to the space channel.
<br><br>
Five more Great Ghost Priests also entered the space channels, including Bainbridge, who had taken Decker away.
<br><br>
The rest of the six Great Ghost Priests stayed above the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
The wolf teeth were highly valuable. Thus, they had to watch over these members of the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The space channels in the Ghost Mountain were not that long.
<br><br>
Bainbridge carried Decker in his hand. After they passed through the space channel, he entered the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
There was a dark passage on the third floor.
<br><br>
The other Great Ghost Priests moved forward at immensely fast speed while Bainbridge took Decker to another road.
<br><br>
At that point, Decker regretted everything.
<br><br>
He estimated that he might not be able to get out of the Ghost Mountain alive.
<br><br>
However, the members of the Wooden Leaf race never dared to attempt or even imagine to fuse with a hatred-level Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
As he thought of it, he suddenly felt a sense of satisfaction.
<br><br>
It was worth dying this way. He felt grateful to Zen.
<br><br>
Just as he further drowned in his thoughts, a figure flashed not far away.
<br><br>
It was a human.
<br><br>
A human Great Ghost Priest! He felt his heart get caught in his throat.
<br><br>
He, who was timid by nature, suddenly dared to glance stealthily at Bainbridge.
<br><br>
Bainbridge, who was unaware of what happened, continued to move forward.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, Decker shouted at the human Great Ghost Priest with all his might.
<br><br>
"Human Great Ghost Priest, some humans are looking for you on the Ghost Altar!"
<br><br>
Chapter 4079 The Human Great Ghost Priest Upon hearing Decker's words, the human Great Ghost Priest abruptly stopped in his tracks.
<br><br>
He was a bit confused.
<br><br>
Some humans were looking for them on the Ghost Altar? Aside from him and his companions, there were no other human beings on the Night View Island. How could any appear on the Ghost Altar? On the other hand, Bainbridge did not expect that Decker would be so bold.
<br><br>
"Shut up!"
<br><br>
He suddenly gathered his strength and squeezed Decker's neck. Decker choked and flushed a deep red, unable to say a word.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute, Bainbridge." The human Great Ghost Priest followed up out of curiosity.
<br><br>
In turn, Bainbridge's face darkened when he saw the human Great Ghost Priest chase after him, and he quickened his pace.
<br><br>
When the human Great Ghost Priest saw Bainbridge's reaction, his suspicion deepened.
<br><br>
He took a step forward.
<br><br>
Then, his figure suddenly froze in place.
<br><br>
Another copy of his figure appeared right in front of Bainbridge, and his first figure that he left behind slowly disappeared.
<br><br>
"Bainbridge, why are you in such a hurry?" the human Great Ghost Priest asked.
<br><br>
"It's none of your business!" Bainbridge hissed. Meanwhile, Decker kept struggling out of his grip.
<br><br>
"Mmmmph... uhh..."
<br><br>
He desperately tried to make a sound.
<br><br>
However, Bainbridge's hand tightly gripped his neck like an iron clamp.
<br><br>
Therefore, he could not speak at all.
<br><br>
"But I heard him say that there are human beings on the Ghost Altar," said the human Great Ghost Priest.
<br><br>
"You misheard him," Bainbridge answered gruffly.
<br><br>
"It does not matter if I misheard him or not. I want to hear him say those words again," the human Great Ghost Priest said seriously.
<br><br>
Bainbridge's nostrils flared in anger. "Are you making things difficult for me?"
<br><br>
"Yes, so what?" the Great Ghost Priest retorted.
<br><br>
When Bainbridge heard those words, he became even more furious.
<br><br>
Thanks to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the human beings enjoyed a high status in the Ghost Mountain and received excellent treatment.
<br><br>
The main point was that these humans were still quite powerful. Since Bainbridge couldn't defeat them, he had to let go of Decker now.
<br><br>
He hesitated for a moment with a long face, as if he had thought of something. Then, he threw Decker on the ground and said, "Let's see how long you can act arrogantly!"
<br><br>
The reason these humans had an extraordinary status in the Ghost Mountain was because the Monkey Spirit Sect pinned their hopes of awakening on them.
<br><br>
But the Element Spirit Civilization brought wolf teeth...
<br><br>
If the wolf teeth were real, then the humans would be useless! By then, the humans couldn't act so arrogantly anymore.
<br><br>
Decker got up from the ground and hastily said, "Sir, the Element Spirit Civilization has trapped Zen and the others on the Ghost Altar! Please go and save them!"
<br><br>
The human Great Ghost Priest's face froze. "Zen? Who is he?" he asked.
<br><br>
There was no such person named Zen in the 77th chaos. The human Great Ghost Priest surely did not know him.
<br><br>
Decker didn't know much about that as well. He thought for a while, and then said, "Some people called Fuxi and the Snake Goddess are also in that group..."
<br><br>
As soon as he said those two names, the human Great Ghost Priest became quite serious. "Where are they from?" he asked cautiously.
<br><br>
"From outside the Night View Island," answered Decker.
<br><br>
"Outside the Night View Island?"
<br><br>
The human Great Ghost Priest's expression changed a few times before he turned around and left.
<br><br>
The passage where Bainbridge headed to was connected to the right side of the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
The humans enjoyed special treatment on the third floor, and they owned almost the entire space on the right side.
<br><br>
When he reached the end of the passage, he pushed open one of the doors.
<br><br>
There was an open hall inside.
<br><br>
In the hall was an old man, who was busy with something.
<br><br>
Drops of blood fell from the old man's fingertips and merged into a small porcelain bottle.
<br><br>
Tens of thousands of porcelain bottles were in front of him, all of which contained the blood of the Eternal Realm warriors. Their blood was the human race's foundation and the key to their survival in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
This old man was none other than the real Primeval Lord of Heaven, and he was carefully fusing with the blood power in the bottles.
<br><br>
The only way to awaken the Ghost Master was to find all thirteen wolf teeth.
<br><br>
However, the way out of the Night View Island was destroyed, so the chances of getting the wolf teeth were quite slim.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others finally came up with a solution.
<br><br>
The wolf teeth fused with the bloodlines. Each of them contained different bloodline theurgies, and the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was a remarkably powerful magic treasure.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven tried to mix the bloodlines of many different Eternal Realm warriors to obtain the bloodlines similar to those of the wolf teeth.
<br><br>
The process was incredibly difficult.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had been trapped on the Night View Island for a long time.
<br><br>
He had tried again and again for over a thousand chaotic eras, and now he finally achieved some great results.
<br><br>
At the very least, the aura of the fused bloodline made the Ghost Master react.
<br><br>
Even the slightest reaction was enough.
<br><br>
The truth was that the Ghost Master's obsession with the wolf teeth was only due to the auras of the fused bloodlines.
<br><br>
If the Primeval Lord of Heaven could truly create the auras of thirteen different fused bloodlines, then the Ghost Master would have a high chance of awakening.
<br><br>
Because of that, the monkeys highly valued the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and subsequently, the human race held a high position in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Even if the number of the Great Ghost Priest from other races had an absolute advantage, no one dared to offend the human race to their faces.
<br><br>
Before Emperor Charm could say anything, the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, "Emperor Charm, what happened? Why are you so anxious?"
<br><br>
"The passage to the Night View Island has been repaired. The avatars of Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi have arrived. The Element Spirit Civilization has blocked them at the Ghost Altar!" said Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
At first, the Primeval Lord of Heaven wanted to mix the blood power in the two porcelain bottles.
<br><br>
The bloodlines of the Eternal Realm masters were unique. Furthermore, since the bloodlines in the porcelain bottles had already gotten merged twice, he had to be careful when fusing them again.
<br><br>
But as soon as he heard Emperor Charm's words, his hand trembled violently. Suddenly, a wisp of cyan smoke rose from one of the porcelain bottles, and a needle-like flame drilled out of the bottle's mouth. Then, the porcelain bottle broke into pieces.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
He almost thought that he had misheard Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
In return, Emperor Charm quickly repeated his words.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was considerably shocked. After a few seconds, he said, "Ask Zhurong and Chiyou to go with us!"
<br><br>
The four human warriors who served as Great Ghost Priests were Zhurong, Emperor Charm, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Chiyou.
<br><br>
At that point, it was like a thick cloud of misery floated in the air.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit seemed to be asleep and stayed still.
<br><br>
As for Claire, she glanced wickedly at Zen and said, "I'm not happy to let you live a little longer."
<br><br>
"Even if you are unhappy, you have to endure it," Fuxi shot back coldly.
<br><br>
After all, they were now in a pretty bad situation, so he and the others naturally felt anxious.
<br><br>
A cold smile graced Claire's face. Then she suddenly looked up at the Great Ghost Priests and asked, "May I kill a few people first?"
<br><br>
"Go ahead." A Great Ghost Priest waved his hand.
<br><br>
These people's lives had nothing to do with the Great Ghost Priests. They only stayed to guard the Eye Spirit and his group.
<br><br>
"Good!"
<br><br>
With a cruel grin, Claire gently waved her hand, and the little white dragon that was inside her body came out again.
<br><br>
A layer of flame scales coated its body as flames rose from its skin. Then, it moved towards Zen.
<br><br>
At that moment, a voice came from the space channel.
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
Finally, the four human Great Ghost Priests came out of the transmission channel.
<br><br>
Chapter 4080 Disadvantage When Zen and the rest looked up, their eyes fell on the four human Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
At this very moment, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Fuxi were far more nervous than the others.
<br><br>
While they had only seen the energy souls of their real selves in the past, at this moment, they had the chance to actually see their real selves in full.
<br><br>
Had their real selves already merged with the hatred-level Treacherous Beings? Had they become Great Ghost Priests? Although they looked up with this anticipation, they were disappointed by what they saw.
<br><br>
They saw Emperor Charm and Chiyou, but the real Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, and the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi were all absent.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen had something different in mind.
<br><br>
Cupping his hands, he greeted with respect, "Good to see you, Primeval Lord of Heaven!"
<br><br>
The real Primeval Lord of Heaven merely nodded nonchalantly at Zen in return.
<br><br>
While Zen and the others sized up the Great Ghost Priests, the latter observed them closely as well.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were all familiar faces to the Primeval Lord of Heaven — Zen was the only unfamiliar face.
<br><br>
Initially, he surmised that the group before him must have reached this point to enter the Night View Island under Fuxi and the Snake Goddess' leadership. He knew Fuxi had excellent talent and was a natural leader, while the Snake Goddess possessed extraordinary intelligence and could easily serve as a capable assistant.
<br><br>
But looking everyone up and down, the Primeval Lord of Heaven could sense something unknown yet unique from Zen in particular.
<br><br>
His body seemed to have a mixed aura of bloodlines.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had spent countless years studying the bloodline powers, trying to merge them.
<br><br>
His sensitivity to the bloodlines of Eternal Realm warriors had surpassed anyone else's.
<br><br>
Recognizing the mixed aura of bloodlines in Zen's body, the Primeval Lord of Heaven quickly reached a conclusion. 'Perhaps this person fused with an origin-level bloodline?' he thought.
<br><br>
If such was the case… Then this person's bloodline would be just enough to serve as one of the wolf teeth.
<br><br>
"Are you Zen?" asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Earlier, when Decker reported to Emperor Charm, he had mentioned a new name to them.
<br><br>
A total of five humans had arrived. Apart from Yasamin, the old lady with greying hair, and the three familiar faces who were replicas of their real selves, the young man must be Zen from the earlier report, the Primeval Lord of Heaven figured.
<br><br>
"Yes, I am," Zen nodded.
<br><br>
"Okay, come up to me now."
<br><br>
He had been living in the Ghost Mountain for many years. While he wasn't as superior as the monkeys, they still needed his help, and had to show utmost respect for his words.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven! Have you forgotten me, my old friend?"
<br><br>
suddenly, the Eye Spirit chimed in.
<br><br>
It was no surprise — the Primeval Lord of Heaven had already noticed the Eye Spirit's presence.
<br><br>
But he refused to cast his eyes at the huge, floating eyeball until the latter spoke specifically to catch his attention.
<br><br>
As he firmly stared at the Eye Spirit, a grave, resentful feeling rose within the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Ever since the 77th chaos, the human race had continued fighting against this enormous eyeball.
<br><br>
After failing to complete the Finale Way, they had retreated into the Other Shore where they continued the running battle.
<br><br>
Although they continued to fight, they suffered failure each and every time.
<br><br>
Little by little, they were forced to retreat until the Ghost Mountain became their very last refuge.
<br><br>
Only in this way had the Primeval Lord of Heaven managed to lead the group of human heroes to survive.
<br><br>
Countless years had passed since he last saw the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
The extended span of time should have been enough for an ordinary mortal to reincarnate hundreds of millions of times — it should have been enough to blunt any deep hatred. But even now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven could still barely conceal the killing intent in his eyes. "You've been trying so hard to enter the Night View Island, haven't you?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Not really, you're just a group of nobodies now," said the Eye Spirit ever so casually.
<br><br>
While he didn't mean to deliberately belittle the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others, he was, if anything, merely telling the truth.
<br><br>
In the past, the battle between the Element Spirit Civilization and the human race was a battle between two civilizations of the chaos. It didn't involve the Treacherous Beings, nor did it involve the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Neither of them were aware of the Four Spirits Sect's existence at the time.
<br><br>
But now, the war between the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race was different. On the surface, it was a war between the Purge Way and the Nihility Way, but in truth, it was a war between the Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
In comparison to that, the human race wasn't even worth mentioning.
<br><br>
Still, the Primeval Lord of Heaven managed to keep his cool upon hearing the Eye Spirit's words. Emperor Charm, however, couldn't suppress his anger.
<br><br>
His eyes turned a deep golden color, as though they held fiery suns within them.
<br><br>
Then, a powerful aura began spreading out in the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
Such was the aura of a hatred-level Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Among the four human Great Ghost Priests, Emperor Charm had the sharpest aura.
<br><br>
"Nobodies? What makes you say that?" he snapped back fiercely.
<br><br>
In the face of Emperor Charm's display of strength, the corners of Claire's mouth curled up into a disdainful smile.
<br><br>
Wearing a cunning glint in the eyeball, the Eye Spirit spoke to the Great Ghost Priests of the other races. "Since the Ghost Mountain doesn't welcome us, we'll be taking our leave now!" he said.
<br><br>
As he spoke, he turned around, ready to retreat along with Claire and the Holy Wings Armor.
<br><br>
"Wait!"
<br><br>
"We keep our doors open to all visitors. These humans can't represent the Ghost Mountain!"
<br><br>
"It's up to us here!"
<br><br>
The six Great Ghost Priests from the other races grew anxious when they saw the Eye Spirit ready to leave.
<br><br>
After all, they had planned to stand by and watch until the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest proved the truth of the wolf tooth.
<br><br>
But now, the presence of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other three had just further complicated the already difficult situation.
<br><br>
The non-human Great Ghost Priests' words irritated Emperor Charm even more. Staring at one of them, he threatened coldly, "Washburn, have you already forgotten how I defeated you? You said we can't represent the Ghost Mountain. Then, what about you?"
<br><br>
The four human Great Ghost Priests held extraordinary statuses and the greatest strength among all the priests. Washburn, the non-human Great Ghost Priest, had already been beaten by Emperor Charm seven times in the past.
<br><br>
Noticing Emperor Charm's cold gaze, Washburn immediately grew nervous.
<br><br>
As he was at a loss for what to say in response, another non-human Great Ghost Priest sneered and said, "Only the Ghost Master can represent the Ghost Mountain. No one else can replace him." Turning to face the Eye Spirit, he continued, "My friend, since you have the wolf teeth to wake up the Ghost Master, you are a distinguished guest of the Ghost Mountain! I believe that the Monkey Masters will wish for you to stay."
<br><br>
"You're right. If the Monkey Masters manage to gather all the wolf teeth, I think the humans can finally stop their absurd attempts. They've tried for so long but to no avail. What a joke!"
<br><br>
"Exactly!"
<br><br>
As they taunted the humans, the six of them burst into laughter.
<br><br>
Normally, they'd never have even dared to treat humans as such. But now, things were different. The passageway that led outside had finally been repaired, and the wolf teeth brought by the Eye Spirit were likely to be genuine.
<br><br>
Even if the Eye Spirit's wolf teeth were fake, they'd be able to go and search for the lost objects themselves.
<br><br>
After all the time spent shamefully bowing before the humans, they could finally vent their discontent.
<br><br>
"If we wake the Ghost Master now, we'll take all humans' lives. Would you agree to that?" Claire demanded, pointing at both Zen's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's groups.
<br><br>
"I believe that the Monkey Masters will agree to your small request,"
<br><br>
Washburn nodded with a smile.
<br><br>
When the humans heard their conversation, their expressions instantly darkened.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the Eye Spirit had been well prepared before he came to this place.
<br><br>
While the Primeval Lord of Heaven had already fused with a hatred-level Treacherous Being, he still didn't dare underestimate the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Still, never did he expect the Eye Spirit to bring the wolf teeth to the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
He was well aware that the situation was just as Washburn had said.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters bestowed a special status upon the humans in the hopes that the Primeval Lord of Heaven would manage to wake the Ghost Master, otherwise known as the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
But if the Eye Spirit awakened the Monkey Spirit King with the wolf teeth, the humans would undoubtedly become dispensable to the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
In such a case, the humans' value to them would shrink to nothing.
<br><br>
Chapter 4081 Verify "Small request?"
<br><br>
The malicious aura emanating from Emperor Charm grew more intense.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings could not be killed, but the creatures that fused with them could.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm slowly raised his arms. Something slowly jutted out from them.
<br><br>
They were two spikes formed by the Treacherous Being he fused with.
<br><br>
"I also have a small request: disappear from the Ghost Mountain," Emperor Charm said with a snarl.
<br><br>
Washburn felt his heart sink with dread. "You have the audacity?"
<br><br>
If one wanted to stage a battle in the Ghost Mountain, they had to make a request to the Monkey Masters first.
<br><br>
Anyone who broke such rules and acted without permission here would be punished.
<br><br>
"Emperor Charm, if you attack in the Ghost Altar, the Monkey Masters will not let you go!"
<br><br>
"You will receive the harshest punishment from the Ghost Mountain!"
<br><br>
"Don't you dare!"
<br><br>
The other five Great Ghost Priests warned.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm didn't budge.
<br><br>
His eyes were flashing like two golden suns now.
<br><br>
The aura of the hatred-level Treacherous Being poured out of him in waves.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven finally stepped forward and placed his hand on Emperor Charm's shoulder. "Stop."
<br><br>
"Why? Are you scared of them?" Emperor Charm scoffed.
<br><br>
For many years, the human race always had a say in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests of other races could only comply with their tails tucked between their legs.
<br><br>
But now that the Element Spirit Civilization was here, they suddenly turned their noses up at humans. Emperor Charm couldn't bear the disrespect.
<br><br>
"Of course not. But if we act out of turn, we'd just be putting ourselves in trouble," the Primeval Lord of Heaven reminded gently.
<br><br>
Human heroes held the Primeval Lord of Heaven in high esteem. His words carried weight.
<br><br>
With his persuasion, Emperor Charm suppressed his anger and stepped aside.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven turned his attention on Washburn.
<br><br>
Washburn and the Great Ghost Priests of other races actually mattered little to him.
<br><br>
He appraised the Eye Spirit coolly. "Wonderful of you to bring the wolf teeth to the Night View Island. It seems you know a lot about the Ghost Mountain."
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit remained silent.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven continued, "But as I recall, when the Ghost Master used the Thirteen Teeth Necklace to survive a great disaster, it had been broken."
<br><br>
"I know that," the Eye Spirit said.
<br><br>
The wolf teeth were, indeed, covered with mottled cracks, as if they had once been shattered. In fact, the bloodline power inside them had disappeared, leaving only its aura.
<br><br>
Frankly, they had little to no value like this.
<br><br>
"But I also know the Ghost Master's obsession is the Thirteen Teeth Necklace. As long as the thirteen wolf teeth are collected and arranged properly, he will naturally wake up," the Eye Spirit said smugly.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven only smiled at this. "You're wrong. The Ghost Master's obsession is not the Thirteen Teeth Necklace itself, but the bloodline power contained within it. The thirteen kinds of bloodline power are comparable to the power of the four origin-level bloodlines. Without the bloodline power, the necklace is insufficient to awaken him."
<br><br>
Hearing this, the Eye Spirit was taken aback.
<br><br>
"That is nonsense. Treacherous Beings can be awakened by their obsessions, which are usually objects."
<br><br>
Although what the Primeval Lord of Heaven said made sense, obsessions were mysterious and unique to the Treacherous Beings. No one could really tell what they were until they'd tried it.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit simply chose not to believe what the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
"Go ahead and check for yourself then," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest carried that wolf tooth and headed straight for the core area of the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
When he passed by the huge painting of the Ghost Master, he gazed at it for a moment and compared the wolf tooth in his hand with the depiction of the Thirteen Teeth Necklace.
<br><br>
They looked exactly the same! This made him feel very excited.
<br><br>
There seemed to be hope in awakening the Ghost Master after all. Perhaps he could finally leave the Ghost Mountain and go out into the world! He hurried to the end of the passageway.
<br><br>
At this point, the walls were covered with murals depicting all kinds of monkeys, spanning several thousand feet long.
<br><br>
The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest knocked gently on the wall.
<br><br>
There was no response.
<br><br>
He continued knocking relentlessly.
<br><br>
After a long time, one of the monkeys in the mural slowly began to take shape and eventually emerged from the wall.
<br><br>
He was a Monkey Master.
<br><br>
He was once a follower of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
"What is it?" the Monkey Master snapped. "Did we not say not to disturb us unless it was urgent?"
<br><br>
In the Ghost Mountain, only the Primeval Lord of Heaven had the privilege to wake up the Monkey Masters at any time and any place.
<br><br>
This was because it was understood the Primeval Lord of Heaven's work was of vast importance.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Monkey Masters, the other Great Ghost Priests were all worthless in comparison.
<br><br>
The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest bowed respectfully to the Monkey Master. "I have come here to show you something that might be important."
<br><br>
"What is it?" The Monkey Master was getting impatient.
<br><br>
What possibly could be so important coming from the Night View Island? The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest held out his hands, presenting the wolf tooth respectfully.
<br><br>
The Monkey Master took one look at the wolf tooth and was startled. He snatched it up immediately.
<br><br>
He sniffed and gnawed at it with his teeth. He turned it around his fingers for some time, staring at it closely at all angles, before finally pounding against the wall.
<br><br>
Knock! Knock! Knock! "Wake up, all of you!"
<br><br>
The monkeys in the murals started emerging one after another.
<br><br>
They were irritated at having been woken so abruptly.
<br><br>
But when their eyes fell on the wolf tooth, they, too, were shocked awake and started chattering among themselves.
<br><br>
"A wolf tooth?"
<br><br>
"Where did you get it?"
<br><br>
"Are there others?"
<br><br>
The first Monkey Master turned back to the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest. "Where did this come from?"
<br><br>
"Some people brought it here," the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest reported. "They come from the world outside the Night View Island."
<br><br>
"They only have this one?" asked the Monkey Master.
<br><br>
The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest thought for a moment. "There could be more. Based on what they've said so far, it seems they are in possession of others."
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit, after all, seemed quite certain the Ghost Master could be awakened.
<br><br>
Moreover, he handed over the wolf tooth readily, which implied it wasn't his only one.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters on both sides of the passageway started buzzing in excitement.
<br><br>
"I'll verify if this is real first."
<br><br>
The first Monkey Master brought the wolf tooth into the huge innermost door.
<br><br>
Through the crack in the door, the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest spotted a huge foot. He surmised it must belong to the Ghost Master.
<br><br>
The ordinary Great Ghost Priests had never seen the Ghost Master with their own eyes before.
<br><br>
Among them, only the Primeval Lord of Heaven had.
<br><br>
After a few moments, the Monkey Master came back, his face looking grave.
<br><br>
In a trembling voice, he pronounced, "This wolf tooth is the real thing! Quickly! Take me to those who brought it!"
<br><br>
Chapter 4082 Conditions "I'll go with you!"
<br><br>
"Me, too!"
<br><br>
"Manuel, please take me with you!"
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters were speaking over each other now, scrambling for the chance to accompany Manuel.
<br><br>
Manuel was the leader of the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
Manuel's eyes scanned the throng quickly. "Tearrag, Hagar, and Nereus.
<br><br>
The three of you, come with me!"
<br><br>
Now that some people had brought wolf teeth here to the Ghost Mountain, there was no need to worry about any of them escaping.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters were all indispensable core members of the Monkey Spirit Sect. Even if they became Treacherous Beings, they would be extremely powerful after they were awakened.
<br><br>
As the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest led the way back to the Ghost Altar, he felt dread creep into his heart.
<br><br>
He was a Great Ghost Priest on the side of the human race.
<br><br>
He had been worried on his way to deliver the wolf tooth.
<br><br>
If the wolf tooth was real, it wouldn't be good for the humans at the Ghost Altar right now.
<br><br>
Now that that was the case, those humans were definitely in danger.
<br><br>
The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest and the four Monkey Masters arrived at the space channel shortly. With a small bow, the Great Ghost Priest gestured respectfully for the Monkey Masters to go through first. "After you."
<br><br>
Manuel swaggered into the space channel.
<br><br>
In an instant, he reappeared at an entrance above the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
"A Treacherous Being?"
<br><br>
Zen and the others looked up and stared at Manuel as he stepped into view.
<br><br>
Manuel wasn't actively emanating any aura.
<br><br>
But his mere presence inspired awe.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't experienced this feeling for a long time, not even with the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Was this Treacherous Being a hatred-level one? How powerful was he? "Greetings, Master Manuel!"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke up, respectfully.
<br><br>
Although the Ghost Mountain belonged to the Ghost Master, he hadn't awoken yet.
<br><br>
The Ghost Mountain was under the control of these Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
Among them, Manuel enjoyed the highest status. He was thus, at that moment, the de facto controller of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Manuel nodded to the Primeval Lord of Heaven in acknowledgement.
<br><br>
He ignored the other Great Ghost Priests completely.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests were powerful and majestic beings in the eyes of Bacchus and the other warriors from many races.
<br><br>
But in the eyes of the Monkey Masters, they were merely a group of slaves.
<br><br>
As far as the Monkey Masters were concerned, the Great Ghost Priests were nothing but prisoners tasked to serve the Ghost Mountain for generations.
<br><br>
After the Night View Island was sealed, these slaves were barred from going out. Otherwise, they would go out to search for wolf teeth on behalf of the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was probably the only one with a high status among them, and the only one whom Manuel respected. Manuel even relied on him to help awaken the Ghost Master.
<br><br>
Manuel's nod of acknowledgement was thus a great privilege the other Great Ghost Priests would never be able to get.
<br><br>
"Who brought the wolf tooth here?" Manuel asked imperiously.
<br><br>
"Me," answered the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
"How many wolf teeth do you still have?" Manuel continued.
<br><br>
"Nine," the Eye Spirit replied.
<br><br>
The eyes of the four Monkey Masters flashed with excitement.
<br><br>
All those present knew instantly what that meant.
<br><br>
"Hand them over," Manuel ordered.
<br><br>
Although the Element Spirit Civilization was unusual in form, Manuel remained unperturbed.
<br><br>
He had seen many things: the world formed by pure fire spirits, the world formed by water spirits, and many others.
<br><br>
"No," the Eye Spirit replied casually.
<br><br>
The Ghost Altar suddenly became deathly silent.
<br><br>
Everyone held their breath.
<br><br>
It was the first time that Zen, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, even the warriors from other races like Bacchus, Tate and some others, had encountered Manuel. But they all felt his domineering power upon his arrival.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit actually dared to openly refuse such a being. Didn't he realize what he was up against? Manuel was taken aback at the brazen response. His face darkened.
<br><br>
"Are you not afraid of me? Do you have any idea who I am?"
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit responded calmly. "You are the top Great Ape King in the Monkey Spirit Sect, in possession of extraordinary strength. Of course I'm in awe of you. But I entered the Ghost Mountain prepared to die, so I'm afraid threatening me with that just wouldn't work."
<br><br>
Great Ape King was a laudatory title in the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
This title was known only to the Four Spirits Sect. In the Ghost Mountain, only the Monkey Masters knew about it.
<br><br>
Even the Great Ghost Priests, including the Primeval Lord of Heaven, had no idea what it was.
<br><br>
But the Eye Spirit just openly revealed Manuel's past identity. It was clear he wanted Manuel to know that the Element Spirit Civilization was being backed by a powerhouse as strong and established as the Monkey Spirit Sect, which was the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The Great Ghost Priests trembled.
<br><br>
Any minute now, they were expecting Manuel to fly into a rage at the Eye Spirit's behavior.
<br><br>
There would be tragedy and destruction in the wake of his fury. The Great Ghost Priests were terrified of being caught in that storm.
<br><br>
But what Manuel did next shocked them.
<br><br>
"What do you want, then? What are your conditions?"
<br><br>
Manuel was actually negotiating with someone! And with a warrior from another race out of nowhere, no less! They almost couldn't believe their ears.
<br><br>
"First, hand over all the humans to me. Second, let me wake up the Monkey Spirit King," the Eye Spirit said flatly.
<br><br>
In fact, the first condition was supplementary.
<br><br>
What the Eye Spirit really cared about was the second condition: the important task he came here to do.
<br><br>
A look of hesitation crossed Manuel's face, perhaps for the first time in history.
<br><br>
He wasn't hesitating because of the first condition. It was actually no problem to him.
<br><br>
In fact, as soon as he confirmed the veracity of the wolf tooth, he was already prepared to send the Primeval Lord of Heaven to his doom.
<br><br>
He had waited so long for this chance to wake up the Ghost Master, and it turned out he still had to rely on the real wolf teeth to achieve it.
<br><br>
These humans were meaningless to the Ghost Mountain, anyway. The Eye Spirit could have them, for all he cared.
<br><br>
He was, of course, hesitating on the second condition.
<br><br>
It had always been the Monkey Masters' sworn duty to awaken the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Manuel was the one that the Monkey Spirit King trusted the most and his long-cherished wish was to wake up the Monkey Spirit King himself.
<br><br>
As Manuel remained silent, the Eye Spirit continued. "Great Ape King, it's our common goal to awaken the Monkey Spirit King. As long as he wakes up, everything will work out fine, wouldn't it?"
<br><br>
Manuel nodded. "Yes. You are correct."
<br><br>
This meant that Manuel had accepted the Eye Spirit's two conditions.
<br><br>
"So the lives of these people are at our disposal now?" Claire said, sneering menacingly.
<br><br>
The humans in the Ghost Mountain right now were facing imminent doom.
<br><br>
Even if they had four Great Ghost Priests on their side, they stood no chance.
<br><br>
Before Manuel could answer, the Primeval Lord of Heaven piped up.
<br><br>
"Master Manuel, the necklace of wolf teeth may not necessarily be the Ghost Master's obsession. Perhaps you should decide on this after the Ghost Master awakens."
<br><br>
Manuel paused to think it over.
<br><br>
"That's right. Please wake up the Ghost Master first. Then you could do whatever you like with these humans," he told the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Perhaps he could still use the Primeval Lord of Heaven, after all.
<br><br>
If the Thirteen Teeth Necklace failed to work, at least the Primeval Lord of Heaven would still be there to help figure things out.
<br><br>
If Manuel sent him to his death now, there was no undoing that.
<br><br>
"Great Ape King..."
<br><br>
Before Claire could argue, the Eye Spirit broke in, "That's fine with us.
<br><br>
Very well, then. Let's do as you suggest."
<br><br>
Chapter 4083 Return The Energy Souls Having dealt with the Snake Spirit Sect for so many years, the Eye Spirit knew very well the kind of temperament the Snake Masters had. And it was nothing good.
<br><br>
These powerful warriors were known to be capricious and tyrannical.
<br><br>
In front of any creatures of chaos, they always maintained an innate sense of superiority.
<br><br>
It was not impossible to negotiate terms with them, but that happened only when they themselves needed something rather urgently.
<br><br>
To be honest, even the monkeys were not much different from those snakes at this point...
<br><br>
Even if they were determined to get the wolf teeth, that didn't mean that the Element Spirit race could ask for anything in return, which was why the Eye Spirit had interrupted Claire.
<br><br>
Manuel turned his head and glanced at the Primeval Lord of Heaven. He then commanded in a curt tone, "Take the humans on the Ghost Altar to the eastern region. All the humans will not be allowed to go out during this period of time!"
<br><br>
The eastern region was the territory of the human race in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
The guy had basically imprisoned all the humans just with a single sentence.
<br><br>
"Master Manuel..."
<br><br>
Emperor Charm was about to say something, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven coughed and interrupted him. He agreed instantly, "Yes, sir!"
<br><br>
Then he told Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others, "You guys, come on up!"
<br><br>
Zen, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasmin, as well as Campbell, who was at the moment, in the form of a Treacherous Being, leaped up and stood beside the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
And when King Ieuan, the three Eternal Realm Hunters flew up to follow them as well, a powerful force came crashing down on them.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Four muffled thuds were also heard after the large bang.
<br><br>
The four of them had been smashed down hard on the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
And the smashing force was nothing small. After the dust had settled, King Ieuan tried to get up from the ground, but its legs seemed weak and it merely lay on the ground. Blood was gurgling out from the corner of its mouth.
<br><br>
The three Eternal Realm Hunters were also in a similar situation.
<br><br>
In fact, several of Thurston's and Sawyer's bones had been broken, and they could hardly even try to stand up. Only Pearson was in an okay-ish shape.
<br><br>
Looking around, they discovered it was Manuel who had slapped them down.
<br><br>
The he scolded with a harsh roar, "Just who the hell do you think you are? You are not even Great Ghost Priests, and you want to enter the third floor? I don't think so!"
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Monkey Masters, the Great Ghost Priests were nothing more than a group of slaves. Their sole job was to obey orders.
<br><br>
As for warriors from the many races of the Other Shore, they were nothing but a group of walking corpses to the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
In retrospect, Manuel had spared their lives only because he didn't care enough to kill them.
<br><br>
Otherwise, if he had used just a little bit more strength, King Ieuan and the three Eternal Realm Hunters would have become a pile of meat paste.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed in his heart and then explained, "Ordinary people are not allowed to enter the third floor of the Ghost Mountain. You can not follow us any further!"
<br><br>
After wiping the blood from its mouth, King Ieuan once again made an effort to get up from the ground.
<br><br>
To be honest, it was aware that it might not be a good thing for them to follow the other members of the company.
<br><br>
Once the wolf teeth really did wake up the Ghost Master, they would all die with the human race.
<br><br>
However, they had been with Zen and his group for a long time and they had gone through thick and thin with them. So naturally, they were unwilling to part ways with him.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven did not say anything more. He merely led Zen and the other humans into the space channel which led to the eastern region, the region where the human race resided.
<br><br>
Manuel then told the Eye Spirit, "You can come up now. Follow me. It's time to wake up the Ghost Master!"
<br><br>
The three members of the Element Spirit race, the Eye Spirit, Claire, and Gavyn jumped up and followed the Monkey Masters into the space channel.
<br><br>
When the Great Ghost Priests had left, the only ones left on the Ghost Altar were the Glede Demon race, the Grand Mighty race, the Red Demon race, the Eternal Realm Hunters and King Ieuan. The last two of the above were busy healing themselves.
<br><br>
"The situation doesn't seem good, Bacchus," Tate remarked in a long voice.
<br><br>
He had endured a long time of silence.
<br><br>
Now that everyone had left, the remaining people could finally speak freely.
<br><br>
"Those human beings are going to die, and since there is no point in letting you Glede Demon race survive, it is certain that you too will die," Murdock said.
<br><br>
"The territory of the Glede Demon race will be divided up by our Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race, hahaha..." Tate laughed happily.
<br><br>
Over the years, the Red Demon race had suffered a lot at the hands of the Glede Demon race. Although the two were always involved in some sort of tussle, once the latter was gone, they could get their revenge in the form of occupying their territory.
<br><br>
Bacchus's face darkened.
<br><br>
The other three Glede Demons also looked pale at this prospect.
<br><br>
They often boasted that they were the most powerful race on the Night View Island, but now they were finally going to meet their end! At that moment, King Ieuan suddenly spoke up, "It's too early for you to be celebrating."
<br><br>
Tate glanced at it coldly, "Why do you think so?"
<br><br>
"It's not that easy to wake up Treacherous Beings," Pearson chimed in as well. "It is not necessary true that those wolf teeth are the obsession of the Ghost Master."
<br><br>
"Yes." Thurston also nodded. "The Great Ghost Priest of the human race also said that just now. I really don't know why you guys are so confident.
<br><br>
Never count your chickens before they are hatched!"
<br><br>
Tate and Murdock of course were aware of this.
<br><br>
Obsession was a mysterious and unpredictable thing.
<br><br>
Thurston's and Pearson's remarks gave Bacchus and the Glede Demons a slight glimmer of hope. And just a few feet away from them, members of the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race began to worry.
<br><br>
Far away in the eastern region on the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
In addition to the four Great Ghost Priests, namely the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Emperor Charm, Chiyou, Zhurong, the other heroes of the human race were also residents of this area.
<br><br>
Over the long years, most of them had chosen to go to secluded places for cultivation. Some of them had been in isolation for millions or even tens of millions of years now...
<br><br>
Finally, it was today that the Primeval Lord of Heaven called them out one by one.
<br><br>
The real Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, the real Gonggong, the real Houyi, the real Buddha, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi...
<br><br>
They were all very surprised at this summon. It was a rather unusual event.
<br><br>
The last time he had been here, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had simply collected their bloodlines one by one, which hadn't required him to gather everyone together.
<br><br>
"Old man, what are you calling us for in such a hurry?" the real Fuxi asked in confusion.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled. "There are some people you may want to meet."
<br><br>
As he finished his words, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others walked in from behind him.
<br><br>
When the real human heroes saw these members of Zen's company, they were all left stunned. The real Snake Goddess was the first to react. "Are these the avatars we sowed a long time ago? Have you succeeded in your mission?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed with the same light as the real one. "Not yet."
<br><br>
"How did you find this place?" the real Snake Goddess asked once again.
<br><br>
It was already an extremely difficult task to enter the Three Purities Stage, and it was even more difficult to find a way into the Night View Island. In fact, the real Snake Goddess had always considered it to be impossible.
<br><br>
The other human heroes also looked at them in surprise.
<br><br>
At that time, Zen, who was standing next to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, spoke up, "It's a long story. The answer lies in the memories of the energy souls that you placed in the Creation Myth Temple."
<br><br>
After he finished speaking, energy souls of those human heroes emerged from the top of his head one after another.
<br><br>
When they saw their energy souls, their jaws dropped in shock...
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was the first one to ask, "Did you go to the Creation Myth Temple? That book... "
<br><br>
"I have already carried it," Zen piped in.
<br><br>
Whoever carried the Civilization Artifact of the human race could be considered as their leader. This was a rule they had decided to follow since a long time ago and it was still binding.
<br><br>
The real Snake Goddess nodded. She didn't utter a word. Instead, she just waited for her energy soul to rush into her mind and began to merge with the memories of the energy soul...
<br><br>
From Stage Seventeen till now, every single memory was drilled into the minds of the real human heroes.
<br><br>
Through that assimilation process, they came to know Zen's name, the situation of the Source World, the reason why the passageway to the Night View Island was repaired, and the unfathomable ancestry-level bloodline in Zen's body! The moment the real Snake Goddess found out about the ancestry-level bloodline, she suddenly opened her eyes. She was so shocked that her face turned pale as her gaze turned towards the real Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
However, the latter didn't say anything. Instead, he merely smiled at her in response.
<br><br>
Just now, he had merged with the memories of his energy soul, and he had had the same expression as the real Snake Goddess. In fact, his expressions had been much more exaggerated than the real Snake Goddess's.
<br><br>
Chapter 4084 A Sign Of Awakening When they first reached the Eternal Realm, the Snake Goddess and the Primeval Lord of Heaven already speculated that aside from the bloodlines in the outer and inner circles of the Eternal Scroll Painting, there should be even more powerful bloodlines that existed.
<br><br>
However, they did not know what kinds of bloodlines there were above the inner circles' bloodlines. After all, no one had ever studied it.
<br><br>
During their imprisonment in the Night View Island, four of them became the Great Ghost Priests and after they cleared many things with the Monkey Masters, they no longer felt that confused.
<br><br>
After all, they now knew that the bloodlines in the inner circles were called the root-level bloodlines, and above the root-level bloodlines were the origin-level bloodlines, which were four blended bloodlines.
<br><br>
In addition to the four bloodlines, the masters in the main world had also merged with many unique bloodlines.
<br><br>
For instance, the Monkey Spirit King had fused with thirteen types of bloodlines and was one of the most prominent creatures.
<br><br>
Since he had gotten to blend those bloodlines, then it meant that the Primeval Lord of Heaven could also do the same. Thus, he decided to give it a try, and only then did the human race have a safe place to settle down in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Still, putting aside the difficulty to blend the bloodlines, he also knew well that the chances of awakening the Monkey Spirit King through such a method were very slim.
<br><br>
There were many types of bloodlines in the Eternal Scroll Painting alone.
<br><br>
According to the information from the Monkey Masters, there were also even more bloodlines in the main world.
<br><br>
It was much harder to form the thirteen bloodlines that the Monkey Spirit King had, through the permutation and combination of numerous bloodlines.
<br><br>
What made things worse was that the Primeval Lord of Heaven only had thirty-nine kinds of bloodlines in his hands. He could not use such a small number of bloodlines to create something that met the requirements of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
To everyone's surprise, though, he succeeded in blending the bloodlines for the first time, which slightly moved the sleeping Monkey Spirit King. Only then did the Monkey Masters allow him to keep trying out, and he finally felt a glimmer of hope.
<br><br>
However, just after he fused with his energy soul, he learned the damning truth.
<br><br>
In general, the ancestry-level bloodline had a total of four quadrants and three hundred and seventy-three abilities.
<br><br>
When he read the energy soul's memory, he became shocked and distressed.
<br><br>
It turned out that in the end, what he did was all in vain.
<br><br>
Anxiety overcame him as he thought about his useless efforts.
<br><br>
He felt so disappointed that everything passed by almost like a daydream.
<br><br>
As he moped in his sadness, he read more of his energy soul's memory.
<br><br>
Then, he was stunned by what he saw.
<br><br>
He saw that Zen had merged with the holy treasure of the Four Spirits Sect and the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
He shook his head again to be sure. Indeed, the young warrior had fused with it.
<br><br>
He could not contain his excitement when he first saw Zen, as he felt the aura of the blended bloodline. Could it be that he had obtained an originlevel bloodline? That bloodline was more potent than the root-level bloodline! It was almost too good to be true.
<br><br>
However, he never expected the truth to be entirely beyond his boldest imagination! How did he make it? Did such an incredible thing really exist in the world? Alas, the answer was not in the memory of the energy soul.
<br><br>
Zen himself did not know that, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's energy soul was also confused.
<br><br>
The human heroes stood still and looked at Zen in disbelief. They all remained silent.
<br><br>
They felt dumbfounded when they saw the memories of their energy souls.
<br><br>
It would take a few hours, days, months, or even years for them to digest this information.
<br><br>
The silence lasted for a long time, until Chiyou decided to speak first. "You are my grandson," he said.
<br><br>
"Theoretically, that's the case." Zen nodded with a smile.
<br><br>
Chiyou's avatar was actually an independent individual.
<br><br>
Therefore, he did not have a daughter called Lorena in the 77th chaos.
<br><br>
In other words, Zen was the grandson of Chiyou's substitute.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..." Chiyou laughed strangely. Among the thirty-nine heroes, his rank was not that high.
<br><br>
It was also mainly because of luck that he became a Great Ghost Priest.
<br><br>
Now that he knew about Zen's situation, he suddenly felt proud and selfsatisfied.
<br><br>
'My bloodline created an incredible miracle, ' he thought.
<br><br>
"Your bloodline is out of control..."
<br><br>
Just as the real Fuxi was about to ask Zen regarding his lack of control of the ancestry-level bloodline, the Primeval Lord of Heaven raised his hand and gently made a gesture.
<br><br>
It was a gesture that asked him to keep silent.
<br><br>
After all, the Ghost Mountain belonged to the Monkey Masters, and they might eavesdrop on the human beings' conversation.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was the holy treasure of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
That was why it was a highly important matter that must be kept confidential.
<br><br>
In any case, they all knew about the same thing through their energy souls.
<br><br>
"The situation is still quite dangerous. The Element Spirit Civilization has followed the Monkey Masters to try to wake up the Ghost Master," the Snake Goddess said with a frown.
<br><br>
Everyone else also saw what she mentioned at the end of their memories, which was the scene on the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
"We should stop the Element Spirit Civilization. With Zen's help, we can surely wake up the Ghost Master, as long as we give the Primeval Lord of Heaven some more time," said Zhurong.
<br><br>
Ultimately, Zen had the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
That alone could derive any kind of bloodline! Many of the human heroes nodded in agreement. They thought that Zhurong's suggestion was reasonable.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure. At least we can't succeed in completing that task in a short period," the Primeval Lord of Heaven opposed and firmly shook his head.
<br><br>
Even Zen could not control the ancestry-level bloodline—sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not. It was not easy to figure the reason out in a limited time.
<br><br>
"The Monkey Masters don't care who wakes up the Ghost Master," the real Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
Since the Element Spirit Civilization had obtained the teeth, they might be able to wake up the Ghost Master. If that happened, then the humans would be useless to the Monkey Masters, and they could not stop that from happening at all.
<br><br>
"Then we can only place our hopes on..." At that moment, Fuxi waved his hand.
<br><br>
"We can only hope that the Element Spirit Civilization would fail," said the real Fuxi.
<br><br>
Everyone was silent again, and they just hid their hesitance and unwillingness under their bright gazes.
<br><br>
Zen had gone all the way to the Night View Island, and he was the best gift given to the human race. Unfortunately, the Element Spirit Civilization was like a ghost that chased after them all the time, which always made them feel stressed and worried.
<br><br>
Now, they could only wish that the Element Spirit Civilization would fail.
<br><br>
Just then, Manuel pushed open the large door and led the Eye Spirit in.
<br><br>
When the Eye Spirit entered, his eyeball contracted sharply.
<br><br>
Behind the large door was a massive throne, where a mountain-like creature sat.
<br><br>
It was the Monkey Spirit King, Orlando.
<br><br>
He was one of the strongest sect leaders of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Even if there were hostility-level, resentment-level, and hatred-level Treacherous Beings, all the Monkey Masters were greater than all of them.
<br><br>
And the Monkey Spirit King outranked them all.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was also a Treacherous Being, but he looked like he did not have a lot of the Treacherous Being's features. Instead, he looked like an immensely powerful physical body.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King sat on the enormous throne as if he had fallen asleep, with his big, ferocious head tilted to the side and his eyes tightly closed.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit could hardly imagine what kind of light and horrible pressure the Monkey Spirit King's eyes would release when he woke up him.
<br><br>
Manuel stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
Four wolf teeth had appeared in his palm.
<br><br>
There were already three wolf teeth in the Ghost Mountain, and plus the one that the Eye Spirit gave to the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest, there were four wolf teeth in total.
<br><br>
As soon as Manuel displayed the four wolf teeth in front, Orlando slightly moved on the throne. It was a sign of his awakening.
<br><br>
Chapter 4085 The Thirteen Teeth Necklace This kind of movement was not rare among Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
All of them—even hostility-level and resentment-level ones—were capable of acting strangely at certain times. This habit made them difficult to control.
<br><br>
Manuel had come here several times to attempt to awaken the Monkey Spirit King with three wolf teeth. But after repeated failures, he had decided to give it up.
<br><br>
Now, however, Manuel saw an opportunity. He looked eagerly at the Eye Spirit, hoping he would be able to take out the nine remaining wolf teeth.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit did not move. Four wolf teeth hovered in front of him, slowly rotating in midair, but he did not hand the rest over.
<br><br>
Several moments passed. Finally, Manuel became anxious at the wait. He said urgently, "Where are the nine remaining wolf teeth?"
<br><br>
"I can't give them to you now," the Eye Spirit replied calmly.
<br><br>
"Why not?" Manuel asked. His voice was very cold.
<br><br>
He didn't have the patience to wait any longer.
<br><br>
After all, the Monkey Masters considered it humiliating to ask the help of the creatures from the chaos.
<br><br>
"By the order of Master Sewell," answered the Eye Spirit. "He said that you must leave here before he hands over the remaining wolf teeth."
<br><br>
Manuel scowled. So it was Sewell.
<br><br>
He was one of the strongest Snake Masters in the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Indeed, he had a status similar to Manuel's in the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Manuel was familiar with Sewell's power and status.
<br><br>
"Did that snake say that?" Manuel demanded.
<br><br>
"I am not lying to you," said the Eye Spirit. "The fact is that I work for Master Sewell, and only he has the ability to take out the nine remaining wolf teeth."
<br><br>
Manuel stared grimly at the Eye Spirit and asked, "Do you have his coordinates?"
<br><br>
"Yes."
<br><br>
"Contact him and tell him I want to see him," Manuel ordered, not bothering to be polite.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit was unmoved. "Master Sewell does not want to see you.
<br><br>
That's one of the necessary conditions to wake up the Monkey Spirit King."
<br><br>
Although the Eye Spirit had seemed very weak before, he was acting aggressive now. Facing Manuel alone, he was stern and unyielding.
<br><br>
Now that he had mentioned Sewell, it was clear he had no intention of giving way.
<br><br>
A hint of cautious hesitation rose in Manuel's eyes.
<br><br>
Even if the Monkey Spirit King hadn't awakened, he was not to be trifled with.
<br><br>
If the Eye Spirit and his companions dared to play any tricks, they would be courting death.
<br><br>
With thirteen wolf teeth, the Ghost Master would be resurrected. At that point, nothing else would matter.
<br><br>
"Very well," said Manuel, coming to a decision. "I shall leave."
<br><br>
He turned and walked towards the door.
<br><br>
As he left, the door slammed with a bang behind him.
<br><br>
When Manuel had gone, silence fell over the huge space.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King released a solemn aura, spreading an invisible mood of gloom and grimness throughout the space.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit stared at the Monkey Spirit King above him. A strange golden Sanskrit word appeared in his eyeball. The glowing word spun more and more rapidly, emanating growing brightness, until it turned into a bright golden ball.
<br><br>
Once the golden ball had stopped spinning, it dissolved and formed itself into three cross stars. The stars were put together with the longest part of each cross star pointing in the same direction. They were pointed at Sewell's coordinates.
<br><br>
All of the Treacherous Beings had their own coordinates, but most of them were unaware of this. They knew that they would revive in a certain place, but they didn't know where that place would be.
<br><br>
Only the senior leaders of the Four Spirits Sect knew how to extract the coordinates.
<br><br>
They would even destroy the coordinates, which was the only effective way to kill the Treacherous Beings once and for all.
<br><br>
Suddenly, there was a hissing sound.
<br><br>
A small white snake began emerging from the coordinates.
<br><br>
He was Sewell.
<br><br>
As soon as his head was formed, Sewell stared up at the huge Monkey Spirit King, his eyes full of greed.
<br><br>
"Monkey Spirit King, Orlando. You have done your task well, Eye Spirit,"
<br><br>
said Sewell.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit accepted the praise calmly. "Thank you."
<br><br>
"You know, this is the most powerful weapon," Sewell said. "Nothing in the world can surpass it."
<br><br>
"But as one of the leaders of the Four Spirits Sect, how could the Monkey Spirit King be ordered around by anyone?" the Eye Spirit asked.
<br><br>
He knew that once the Monkey Spirit King sided with the Snake Spirit Sect, the long-lasting war in the Jade Pure Realm would come to an end.
<br><br>
But why would a being as powerful as the Monkey Spirit King follow the orders of the Snake Spirit Sect? "Of course, the sober Monkey Spirit King won't. However, an unconscious Monkey Spirit King will do as we ask," Sewell replied.
<br><br>
"So you don't want the Monkey Spirit King to wake up?" the Eye Spirit said, sounding surprised.
<br><br>
"Of course he can't wake up!" snapped Sewell.
<br><br>
If the Monkey Spirit King woke up, he would get to know the turmoil and conspiracy that had happened, and he would not let go of the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Awakening the Monkey Spirit King would unleash a formidable enemy against the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit was uncertain about the soundness of this approach, but he said nothing.
<br><br>
If Sewell said so, then he must be confident.
<br><br>
Sewell stretched out, and his long body rose, coiling around the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Sewell hissed softly, and the Sanskrit words on his body lit up.
<br><br>
As the Sanskrit words began to glow, one after another, nine more small pupils appeared in the eyeball of the Eye Spirit. These small pupils dilated to reveal a set of exquisite wolf teeth.
<br><br>
There was a roaring sound, accompanied by a deep rumbling.
<br><br>
On his huge throne, the Monkey Spirit King shifted, and each movement was loud and noisy.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King felt the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, which was the thing he was most familiar with.
<br><br>
In truth, the bloodline auras contained within wolf teeth were rather weak.
<br><br>
But he was intimately familiar with them because they were his obsession.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's head was tilted downwards, facing the throne.
<br><br>
But he slowly lifted his head as a pair of enormous eyes began to open.
<br><br>
His eyes immediately fixed on the sight of the thirteen wolf teeth. He stopped moving, his face filling with uncertainty and confusion.
<br><br>
However, outside the gate, the Monkey Masters let out cheers of excitement.
<br><br>
"Our king is about to awaken!"
<br><br>
"We have been waiting for countless years!"
<br><br>
"Our long wait is over at last!"
<br><br>
If they could cry, their faces would be streaked with tears of joy and anticipation.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, inside the gate, Sewell spat something out of his mouth.
<br><br>
Three strands of venom shot out, long and gleaming, like sharp arrows.
<br><br>
Each strand had a different color. One was dark red, another was pitch black, and the third was colored a vibrant green.
<br><br>
The strands of venom were thick and dense. As soon as Sewell spat them out, they began solidifying into three slender ropes.
<br><br>
The rope strands intertwined with one another, their pointed ends aimed towards the wolf teeth. As the braided strand drilled through the small holes in the wolf teeth, stringing them together, it formed a complete Thirteen Teeth Necklace.
<br><br>
Sewell opened his jaws and took the Thirteen Teeth Necklace gently in his fangs. He slithered towards the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
In the normal course of things, no one dared to approach the Monkey Spirit King unless directly ordered to do so, or they would get trampled to death.
<br><br>
Even before he had awoken, no one could avoid his kicks, and so they left him alone.
<br><br>
However, the Monkey Spirit King was still slightly dazed and confused, and he allowed Sewell to approach unharmed.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was not inclined to attack Sewell when he was holding the precious Thirteen Teeth Necklace in his mouth.
<br><br>
The only sound in the space was of Sewell moving closer and closer.
<br><br>
He reached the body of the Monkey Spirit King and began twining his snake form around him.
<br><br>
Eventually he reached the shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King. He flicked his head and released the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, throwing it high into the air.
<br><br>
The necklace rapidly expanded in midair. It soared upwards, increasing in size, then fell down around the neck of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Chapter 4086 A Dream The instant the Thirteen Teeth Necklace draped around his neck, the Monkey Spirit King, who had been restless, suddenly became serene.
<br><br>
His originally cloudy eyes gradually turned clear, and they filled with great wisdom.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Sewell quickly slid down from the shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
"Master Sewell, does this mean the Monkey Spirit King has awakened now?" the Eye Spirit asked worriedly.
<br><br>
Anyone, upon seeing the Monkey Spirit King's crystal eyes, would suspect that he had awakened if they didn't know the truth.
<br><br>
"Not so fast," Sewell cautioned with a chuckle.
<br><br>
Then he slithered and twisted his body.
<br><br>
The Sanskrit words painted all over the snake began to flicker in a rapid succession.
<br><br>
As Sewell continued to coil his body, the three-colored rope that had strung the thirteen wolf teeth together now began to jiggle around the Monkey Spirit King's neck.
<br><br>
A strand of rope separated from the cord and penetrated into the base of the Monkey Spirit King's skull.
<br><br>
If something else had penetrated the Monkey Spirit King's body, he would've rejected it automatically. However, the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was the most cherished treasure to him, so he had no qualms at all about the three-colored rope extended into his brain! After the three-colored strand bored into the back of his head, it began to unravel inside.
<br><br>
One single strand was subdivided into three, and then three into nine, followed by nine into eighty-one...
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of three-colored strands unraveled inside the Monkey Spirit King's head. These strands formed thin needles that pierced into his brain one by one.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The Monkey Spirit King abruptly raised his head, and then he lifted and stamped his left foot.
<br><br>
Boom! The entire hall shook violently, and even the Eye Spirit was startled by this unexpected action.
<br><br>
"Don't panic. That is merely a reflex reaction as the Three Resentments Poison infiltrates deeper into his brain..." Sewell explained. "Slowly, the Three Resentments Poison will assume control over his hands, feet, and then his entire body..."
<br><br>
While he was explaining, the Monkey Spirit King lifted and stamped his right foot.
<br><br>
Boom! The hall began reverberating with the shock.
<br><br>
Once the Monkey Spirit King had stamped both his feet, he suddenly rose from his throne and took a stride forward! The Eye Spirit and Sewell were both within range of the Monkey Spirit King's next footfall.
<br><br>
"Fall back!"
<br><br>
Seeing the huge sole of a raised foot coming towards them, Sewell had his expression changed slightly.
<br><br>
He and the Eye Spirit quickly rushed out of reach to avoid being trampled.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! After taking two ponderous steps forward, the Monkey Spirit King became immobile again.
<br><br>
After seeing the Monkey Spirit King's mechanical movements, the Eye Spirit could venture a guess regarding the workings of the Three Resentments Poison.
<br><br>
The Three Resentments Poison could assume control over the Monkey Spirit King's unconscious body, making him become like a puppet on a string.
<br><br>
However, once the Monkey Spirit King regained his consciousness, it would be a piece of cake for him to assume control over his body, given his formidable strength.
<br><br>
Although he felt it was impolite to doubt Sewell, he still decided to voice his doubts.
<br><br>
Sewell hissed and chuckled. "Of course, it would be impossible to take control of the great Monkey Spirit King with merely the Three Resentments Poison," he said. "During this process, we'll have to erase all of his memories!"
<br><br>
"Is that even possible?" the Eye Spirit asked in awe.
<br><br>
"We can't do it at other times, but we can achieve that during the process of his awakening," Sewell replied, looking at the Eye Spirit. "There's no need for you to fret. We're well prepared for this whole process."
<br><br>
The Snake Masters had been making their preparations for this plan for countless years, and they had considered anything that the Eye Spirit could think of.
<br><br>
At this moment, the Monkey Spirit King's consciousness remained in a blur.
<br><br>
He had been slumbering for a very, very long time, having sunk into a deep and infinite dream.
<br><br>
This dream was like being wrapped in shackles that he could not resist.
<br><br>
Despite being the great Monkey Spirit King, he was unable to break free from it.
<br><br>
However, he was crystal clear about one thing: he had died in the chaos.
<br><br>
He required something to return him to life and wake him up. That something was the Thirteen Teeth Necklace; his most cherished treasure, which had been his possession for countless years.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King would have been unable to lead all his subordinates or form one part of the Four Spirits Sect without his thirteen greatest theurgies.
<br><br>
'Bring my powers back! Bring them back to me! My descendants, you must find them for me!' For countless years, the Monkey Spirit King had been making these calls night and day.
<br><br>
Any creature within a 10, 000-mile range of him would hear his calls.
<br><br>
His calls penetrated through the dreamland and echoed within everyone's minds.
<br><br>
At first, his calls had elicited positive responses. After the first couple of chaotic eras, he had seen the first wolf tooth appearing at the edge of the dreamland.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King had celebrated this. His descendants had begun to move on his behalf! After about twenty more chaotic eras, they discovered the second wolf tooth for him.
<br><br>
Another fifty chaotic eras passed, and the third wolf tooth was found...
<br><br>
The progress was painfully slow, but the Monkey Spirit King held on to the hope of his revival.
<br><br>
Given the speed at which his descendants collected the wolf teeth, they could collect all of them in about three hundred chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Finally, he would then be able to leave this damned 'dream.' But the next development disappointed him.
<br><br>
After the third wolf tooth had been found, the fourth one didn't appear for a long time.
<br><br>
This was a bad omen.
<br><br>
Had something disastrous befallen his descendants? Had they given up on helping him find the remaining wolf teeth? He repeated his echoing calls to the outside world again and again, enticing them to look for the wolf teeth. But from that point on, the remaining wolf teeth never appeared.
<br><br>
After another lengthy period of time, the Monkey Spirit King sensed a special and powerful bloodline, and it had the aura of a blended bloodline.
<br><br>
This aura could also penetrate through the dreamland, and he felt it.
<br><br>
However, this new presence didn't please the Monkey Spirit King, instead, it further disappointed him.
<br><br>
It meant that his descendants had failed to locate the remaining wolf teeth and had started to look for an alternative solution.
<br><br>
But any alternative plans were doomed to fail! The thirteen kinds of blended bloodlines were rare combinations of the ancestry-level bloodline's abilities.
<br><br>
It was no small feat to form a stable blended bloodline. Even the Monkey Spirit King himself would have found it hard to recreate the thirteen different blended bloodlines he possessed.
<br><br>
Besides, his descendants were now living in the chaos, and they couldn't return to the main world.
<br><br>
He waited in dismay for many more chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Except for the occasional instance of a blended bloodline or two, he could no longer sense the presence of a new wolf tooth.
<br><br>
Another thousand chaotic eras rolled away. Then, suddenly, the Monkey Spirit King sensed the fourth wolf tooth! His hope was rekindled after more than one thousand chaotic eras! The Monkey Spirit King was overcome with excitement.
<br><br>
This dream resembled a prison, and it required thirteen keys to open it! Hope shone in the Monkey Spirit King's mind again.
<br><br>
He didn't mind the long wait. As long as the number of wolf teeth multiplied, he would find new hope all the time.
<br><br>
But after only a short span of time, the Monkey Spirit King was surprised to sense all nine remaining wolf teeth! All of the thirteen wolf teeth had been located! They had formed a circle, and floated together at the edge of the dreamland.
<br><br>
"I am Orlando! King of all monkey spirits! I will return to you today!"
<br><br>
the Monkey Spirit King roared with excitement, the echoes of his voice spreading throughout the dreamland.
<br><br>
He expected the wolf teeth floating around the edge of the dreamland to come into focus in his mind.
<br><br>
The power of these thirteen wolf teeth would penetrate into the dreamland, returning him to life.
<br><br>
But soon, the Monkey Spirit King discovered something was amiss. The three-colored rope stringing the wolf teeth together was emitting a strange aura.
<br><br>
More importantly, the wolf teeth didn't come into focus in his eyes but remained blurry.
<br><br>
A sense of ill-boding rose in the Monkey Spirit King's mind.
<br><br>
Chapter 4087 Turning Point The Monkey Spirit King knew that he was currently a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect had long found about the secret of the Treacherous Being, and they were able to study and research more about it.
<br><br>
It was known that the main world and the secondary worlds had completely different natures.
<br><br>
Indeed, the creatures born from the main world almost looked exactly the same as those from the secondary worlds in terms of appearance, physical attributes, soul, and inner world. However, that was just what it looked like.
<br><br>
It was also a fact that creatures born from the main world had an attribute that those from the secondary worlds didn't have.
<br><br>
The interesting part was this attribute couldn't be displayed in the main world.
<br><br>
For example, if a certain creature of the main world was killed, then it would die. Its blood would be drained out, and its corpse would rot.
<br><br>
Ultimately, it would return to dust.
<br><br>
However, that wasn't the case when this creature was brought to the secondary world.
<br><br>
If it was killed in a secondary world, the corpse would also decay and turn to dust.
<br><br>
But afterward, it would revive in the form of a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
It was said that the Treacherous Being body was a form of special protection for the creatures of the main world. It would be difficult for anyone to kill it, and even if someone did, it could still revive.
<br><br>
Originally, the location where the Treacherous Being would revive was also the place where it formerly died, and it was intended to be immovable.
<br><br>
These things were what the Monkey Spirit King knew about the Treacherous Being body.
<br><br>
While possessing incredible power and being able to revive repeatedly were definite advantages, a Treacherous Being also had a major drawback—the process of its awakening.
<br><br>
The stronger one's strength originally was, the stronger obsession that person would need to complete their awakening.
<br><br>
Thus it was very difficult to fulfil the Monkey Spirit King's obsession and achieve his awakening.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was badly hurt just before he died.
<br><br>
The Thirteen Teeth Necklace had disintegrated, and it was nearly impossible to collect and gather all the wolf teeth back.
<br><br>
Now that the wolf teeth had appeared today, the Monkey Spirit King had instantly felt that something wrong was going on.
<br><br>
And when he saw the three-colored rope, his hunch grew stronger.
<br><br>
He tried his best to remain calm and assess what was going on.
<br><br>
Upon giving it a lot of thought, he discerned that the creatures outside were not his descendants.
<br><br>
They were here to plot something against him.
<br><br>
Although it was already clear for the Monkey Spirit King that the situation was very critical, he still didn't understand much about the other party's intention.
<br><br>
The field of dream should be totally safe.
<br><br>
It should block all kinds of danger and anything that was beyond his obsession.
<br><br>
'What's going on? What's with this three-colored rope?' Just as the Monkey Spirit King was still contemplating and inspecting the three-colored rope, it suddenly disentangled and divided into three parts— red, black, and green strands. Then, in front of his eyes, the ropes became snakes that started drilling towards the edge of the dream world.
<br><br>
"Snakes! Cornelius, that bastard! I'm already at such a miserable state, but he still wants to kill me!"
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was shocked at first. Then grief and indignation consumed him.
<br><br>
After over a thousand chaotic eras, his hatred had gradually dissipated.
<br><br>
However, when he saw the three snakes of different colors, the hideous memories in his heart and mind resurfaced once again.
<br><br>
At this moment, the snakes were probing at the edge of the dream.
<br><br>
The edge of the dream was very mysterious, and it was supposed to be a special line of defense for a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
According to the memory of the Monkey Spirit King, it should be impossible even for the Four Spirits Sect to break through.
<br><br>
However, a thousand chaotic eras had already passed. No one knew of the progress they made. He couldn't rule out the possibility that they were able to come up with a method to break into the dream world.
<br><br>
As the Monkey Spirit King pondered on this thought, his eyes suddenly widened as it turned out that his guess was spot on.
<br><br>
The three snakes that were probing the edge of the dream had finally broken in without much resistance.
<br><br>
'This is bad... I have to run!' The Monkey Spirit King immediately realized that his life was in danger.
<br><br>
He had to get out of there as soon as possible.
<br><br>
The farther he could distance himself from the snakes, the better.
<br><br>
If this was really Cornelius's doing, then he had to somehow think of a way to get through this.
<br><br>
At first glance, the world of dream seemed to be boundless, but in reality, certain boundaries were in place.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King kept on retreating as the snakes continued extending their bodies, chasing him at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
The world of dream was actually the territory of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Inside it, his speed couldn't be matched. However, to his astonishment, the snakes chasing after him were close behind. It seemed that their speed was just almost the same as the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Thud! Thud! Thud! Meanwhile, as the Monkey Spirit King was running away from the little snakes in his dream world, his huge body outside was also having an intense reaction.
<br><br>
He was like a drunken creature, insanely running around.
<br><br>
Crash! With a few steps, the huge body of the Treacherous Being slammed into the wall of the hall.
<br><br>
The impact shook the entire Ghost Mountain violently as if a big ship was about to overturn during a vicious storm.
<br><br>
Outside the hall, the Monkey Masters became worried as they continued hearing the loud sounds from inside.
<br><br>
"What's going on?"
<br><br>
"Shouldn't we go in and have a look?"
<br><br>
"Is the Ghost Master going to be okay?"
<br><br>
Looking at the closed door, Manuel shook his head and firmly said, "This is a sign of his awakening.
<br><br>
We'll just wait here and see it through."
<br><br>
Some Treacherous Beings' movements were big and loud when their awakening was nearing completion, so it wasn't strange for the Monkey Spirit King to exhibit this behavior.
<br><br>
Moreover, Manuel had always been a man of his word. He promised the Eye Spirit that he would just wait outside, so he intended to keep that.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Eye Spirit and Sewell were constantly dodging the body of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King kept on moving and colliding with things inside the hall.
<br><br>
His movements were also kind of irregular and inconsistent, so they had to be vigilant and avoid being hit by him.
<br><br>
"Master Sewell, is everything going to be okay?" the Eye Spirit asked as they continued observing the Monkey Spirit King inside the hall. "Of course, it is," Sewell replied with a grin on his face. His eyes actually lit up as he couldn't hide his excitement.
<br><br>
"The Three Resentments Poison already drilled into his dream world.
<br><br>
Sooner or later, his capture would be inevitable!" he continued.
<br><br>
"Is the world of dream that big?" the Eye Spirit asked again.
<br><br>
He wasn't a Treacherous Being, but he seemed very curious about it. "Yes, it's very big. Not only that, but it's also extremely difficult to penetrate it.
<br><br>
A long time ago, we couldn't invade even the hostility-level Treacherous Beings' dreams, let alone the ones from powerful masters like the Monkey Spirit King," explained Sewell.
<br><br>
Throughout a thousand chaotic eras, the Snake Masters had all become Treacherous Beings. They dedicated themselves to do more researches and experiments to further their understanding.
<br><br>
For example, originally, the location where the Treacherous Beings revived was supposed to be fixed. One had to revive wherever their bodies died.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Masters and the Bird Masters could now move them to any location.
<br><br>
Likewise, they had also figured out the method to invade one's dream world.
<br><br>
Since only the Treacherous Beings' obsessions could break open their dreams, all they needed to do was to combine the trap with their corresponding obsession.
<br><br>
After the Eye Spirit listened to Sewell's explanation, his eyeball was filled with awe and respect.
<br><br>
These Snake Masters really deserved to be called as the powerful masters of the Four Spirits Sect. They even came up with a specific method to obtain the Treacherous Being body of a powerful master like the Monkey Spirit King. It was such a fearsome breakthrough.
<br><br>
However, although the Snake Masters had carefully organized a thorough plan, they had missed a crucial point.
<br><br>
According to Sewell's arrangement, the three snakes formed by the Three Resentments Poison should have entered the dream world along with the thirteen wolf teeth.
<br><br>
If the Monkey Spirit King wanted to leave the dream, he needed to get a hold of the Thirteen Teeth Necklace first. But once he obtained it, he would definitely be entangled by the Three Resentments Poison. In one way or another, the Monkey Spirit King should have no way to escape.
<br><br>
However, the problem was that although the wolf teeth were already on the edge of the dream, they were still in a blurry state.
<br><br>
This only meant that the wolf teeth didn't actually enter the dream.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the three snakes continued to extend their bodies and chased the Monkey Spirit King down.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King kept running until he saw a dead end.
<br><br>
A shiver ran down his spine, as he knew that he was in a complete bind.
<br><br>
However, as he turned around and looked at the snakes chasing at him, he was stunned and confused at the same time.
<br><br>
The snakes had straightened their bodies and were unable to move forward anymore.
<br><br>
"Wait. What happened?"
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King inspected the bodies of the snakes until his gaze went all the way to the thirteen wolf teeth at their end.
<br><br>
As he noticed that the wolf teeth were still in a blurry state, a huge smile immediately emerged on his face. He instantly understood what was going on and the former terrified expression on his face was replaced with ecstasy.
<br><br>
The three little snakes had come into the dream world, but the wolf teeth did not.
<br><br>
The bodies of the snakes couldn't extend indefinitely, as the wolf teeth prevented them and dragged them back outside of the dream.
<br><br>
"But how did this happen?" While the Monkey Spirit King was overjoyed that he was now safe, he was also confused about what had just happened.
<br><br>
"It could only mean one thing.
<br><br>
The wolf teeth are not my obsession?"
<br><br>

<br><br>
The thirteen wolf teeth did appear at the edge of the dream and were, in fact, very real.
<br><br>
However, the sight of the teeth seemed to have triggered something in his memory.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's eyes suddenly flashed! When the necklace broke, the thirteen wolf teeth that made it up also got damaged.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King wanted not just the teeth but also the bloodline theurgies they contained.
<br><br>
These thirteen bloodlines once formed the foundation of his strength and were even stronger than the four origin-level bloodlines, especially when combined with his trillions of years of experience.
<br><br>
When the wolf teeth broke, their bloodline power also disappeared, so they were unable to enter his dream.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Monkey Spirit King felt both joy and regret.
<br><br>
The loss of bloodline power in those wolf teeth had saved his life but he still felt immensely disappointed.
<br><br>
To wake up, he needed the thirteen wolf teeth that were rich in bloodline power, which was highly unlikely to appear. There did not seem to be that much hope for him.
<br><br>
Back in the hall, the Eye Spirit and Sewell continued to observe the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
They'd been waiting for an hour but the Monkey Spirit King had still yet to make any movements.
<br><br>
Sewell's anxiousness seeped into the air and the Eye Spirit easily sensed it but he did not say anything.
<br><br>
After a while, Sewell's patience ran out.
<br><br>
"Something's wrong."
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's self-consciousness should have been removed by the Three Resentments Poison.
<br><br>
It shouldn't take such a long time.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Unable to take it anymore, Sewell decided to crawl onto the Monkey Spirit King's body.
<br><br>
As he approached the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, he laid his long tail onto the three-colored rope.
<br><br>
Through it, he was able to see something.
<br><br>
It was quite blurry but to Sewell, the scene was clear enough to make him pale with fright.
<br><br>
The wolf teeth couldn't enter the Monkey Spirit King's dream.
<br><br>
What in the world should they do now?! Preparations for this day were incredibly extensive and meticulous. The Snake Masters planned it all to the dot. Nobody ever expected something like this to occur! Not even Sewell, resourceful as he might be, knew what to do.
<br><br>
Knock! Knock! Just then, a knock on the door interrupted their thoughts. It was Manuel.
<br><br>
It seemed that he couldn't help himself and had to take a look at what was happening.
<br><br>
Sewell's eyes glimmered and he called out to the Eye Spirit below, "Come up here!"
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit had no idea what Sewell was up to but he still flew straight up just as he told him to.
<br><br>
Knock! Knock! Knock! Manuel continued to knock but to no avail.
<br><br>
With no answer, he and the Monkey Masters decided to just burst in with a bang! The sight of Sewell on the Monkey Spirit King's shoulder made Manuel incredibly angry. He quickly shot Sewell a ferocious glare. "What are you doing, Sewell?!"
<br><br>
Sewell smirked. "I was planning on just leaving quietly but since you burst in so rudely..."
<br><br>
Whoosh! With Sewell in control of his body, the Monkey Spirit King took a step forward and swung his fist towards Manuel! Unfortunately, the Monkey Spirit King was a bit clumsy due to the Three Resentments Poison.
<br><br>
Manuel, as the Great Ape King, was only second to the Monkey Spirit King, so a clumsy punch wasn't going to be enough to knock him down.
<br><br>
His reaction was fast and he was able to dodge the Monkey Spirit King's attack.
<br><br>
The same could not be said for the other Monkey Masters behind him who had to suffer the blow because they did not move fast enough.
<br><br>
Bang! With that strike, the entirety of the Ghost Mountain shook violently.
<br><br>
The punch had sent the Monkey Masters straight onto the wall! What was once solid brick was now a smashed hole.
<br><br>
Had they been ordinary creatures then that clumsy punch would've been enough to kill them.
<br><br>
Fortunately, they were Treacherous Beings who could only die through the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
No matter how hard the Monkey Spirit King punched them, it would do nothing.
<br><br>
Manuel, in an effort to avoid the Monkey Spirit King's strike, did a somersault and climbed up along his arm.
<br><br>
He did not need to fight the Monkey Spirit King head-on. All he had to do was get rid of Sewell.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit turned to Sewell as Manuel made his way to them. "Do you want me to stop him?"
<br><br>
"No. You won't be able to anyway," Sewell told him.
<br><br>
He knew that the Eye Spirit was no match for Manuel.
<br><br>
As soon as Sewell finished speaking, he suddenly hissed.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit did not see him move but it seemed that Sewell had already launched his attack.
<br><br>
Manuel, who had been climbing the Monkey Spirit King's arm suddenly began to move and maneuver around acrobatically, as if trying to avoid numerous deadly weapons heading his way.
<br><br>
In a way, the Shadowless Poisonous Lines were indeed deadly weapons of the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
These things were incredibly difficult to detect because they were almost invisible.
<br><br>
They could not kill Treacherous Beings but they helped to greatly reduce their speed.
<br><br>
In a battle of this level, the slightest loss of speed could spell defeat.
<br><br>
Fortunately for Manuel, he was no ordinary Monkey Master and had extremely strong sensibility.
<br><br>
He was able to weave through the Shadowless Poisonous Lines. Manuel was light on his feet and was able to quickly reach the Monkey Spirit King's shoulder at lightning speed.
<br><br>
"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."
<br><br>
His opponent's arrival seemed to have made Sewell a bit anxious.
<br><br>
To deter Manuel's approach, Sewell decided to set forth more Shadowless Poisonous Lines to his opponent.
<br><br>
It seemed to have worked since the look in Manuel's eyes grew even more cautious.
<br><br>
"Upper left!" he shouted.
<br><br>
True enough, there was a hole on the upper left that he suddenly jumped into.
<br><br>
Bang! As soon as he came out of the hole, however, the Monkey Spirit King's huge palm slapped down on his head.
<br><br>
Manuel was directly smashed onto the second floor of the Ghost Mountain as a result.
<br><br>
A trace of ridicule appeared in Sewell's eyes as he looked at the crater Manuel created. "As a Treacherous Being now, you're still as stupid as before."
<br><br>
Wasting no time at all, Sewell manipulated the Monkey Spirit King's body to stretch out his hands into the wall and fiercely pull it apart! Rumble! With the Monkey Spirit King's continued assault, cracks soon appeared on the surface of the Ghost Mountain's center line.
<br><br>
It seemed he was determined to tear the entire Ghost Mountain apart! Right now, it would be appropriate to say that everything was a mess.
<br><br>
Members of the Red Demon race, Grand Mighty race, and Glede Demon race continued to wait patiently on the Ghost Altar.
<br><br>
Soon enough, light began to permeate the west wall.
<br><br>
To their shock, the indestructible Ghost Mountain crumbled right before their very eyes! Decker had stayed in a separate room.
<br><br>
Bainbridge had brought him there to meet the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
It was a fairly big deal to have fused with the Ghost Master's pet so he definitely had to meet them.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the matter regarding the Eye Spirit and the wolf teeth took all of the Monkey Masters' attention so they did not bother to respond to Bainbridge's request at all.
<br><br>
Thus, Bainbridge had no choice but to lock Decker in that room until such time that the Monkey Masters would be able to meet him.
<br><br>
Despite his situation, Decker were not desperate.
<br><br>
He held his glazed sheet carefully and took a look at Cary.
<br><br>
Cary was a hatred-level Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Just having him by Decker's side, even for a moment, was worth it.
<br><br>
At that moment, however, the side of the room suddenly collapsed. The Ghost Mountain had split into two! As Decker held on and planted himself flat on the other wall, he saw a huge monkey leap out of the mountain.
<br><br>
This monkey took a step on the Ghost Mountain before launching himself onto the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Decker was, in a word, confused. Extremely confused.
<br><br>
He felt a strong, treacherous aura from the huge monkey so he was surely a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
But could such a powerful Treacherous Being truly exist? Chapter 4089 Competition In the eastern region of the Ghost Mountain, the human heroes could also feel the earth quaking violently.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked a bit sullen, his eyes downcast in frustration.
<br><br>
He knew that the only one who could cause such a ruckus was the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
This had happened before. When the Primeval Lord of Heaven showed the blended bloodline to the Monkey Spirit King, the earth trembled, similar to now.
<br><br>
Such a violent reaction could only mean that the Monkey Spirit King reacted strongly to the wolf teeth, and that he was about to wake up.
<br><br>
The real Snake Goddess, real Fuxi, Zhurong and Chiyou all knew what the quaking earth entailed.
<br><br>
Everyone stood about anxiously, and the atmosphere darkened with worry.
<br><br>
No one was willing to sit and wait for imminent death.
<br><br>
"If the Monkey Spirit King really wakes up, will the Monkey Masters attack us?" a human hero asked.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded affirmatively. "Yes."
<br><br>
They were just vassals to the Monkey Masters in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters wouldn't hesitate to abandon vassals.
<br><br>
"Should we try to fight back?" asked Emperor Charm apprehensively.
<br><br>
"Of course," answered Fuxi without hesitation.
<br><br>
Even if death was imminent, there was no way they were going to die without putting up a fight.
<br><br>
They all knew the consequence of their resistance.
<br><br>
Even if they had the Light of Annihilation and the hatred-level Treacherous Beings on their side, they were still no match for the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Monkey Spirit King was bound to wake up soon. When he did, the disparity in strength would be unfathomable.
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! The vibrations of the Ghost Mountain came one after another, becoming more and more intense with each one that passed.
<br><br>
Zen frowned deeply as he observed the looks of uneasiness in his companions. "Is there any way to escape?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head sadly. "Not in this condition."
<br><br>
At least, there was a chance for the Great Ghost Priests to leave.
<br><br>
But they had to ask permission from the Monkey Masters first. Otherwise they could only leave if they were assigned tasks.
<br><br>
Before, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had once devised a plan to repair the passageway of the Night View Island, and they wanted to give it a try. So, the Monkey Masters had allowed them to temporarily leave the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
However, his plan had failed, and the passageway of the Night View Island remained broken.
<br><br>
Now, the human race was practically under house arrest. The chances of them being allowed to leave were slim.
<br><br>
At this point, everyone was at a loss for ideas. Just then, the vibrations ringing throughout the mountain intensified to an almost unbearable level.
<br><br>
The whole mountain shook violently, as though it were about to snap any second now.
<br><br>
Rumble! Crack! Just then, a loud crack rang out from within the mountain, as though an eggshell had been cracked, except the noise was magnified a thousand times.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this deafening sound, everyone exchanged anxious glances.
<br><br>
"Strange. Even if the Ghost Master woke up, he wouldn't make such a sound..."
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The cracks continued to climb along the Ghost Mountain, until they reached the east.
<br><br>
Boom! All of a sudden, the mountain collapsed in half! Light streamed into the cave as chunks of the mountain began to crumble.
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes flashed as though he had suddenly realized something. In a heartbeat, he dashed out into the mountainside.
<br><br>
As he looked at something in the distance, his mouth fell open in shock and his eyes were filled with horror.
<br><br>
"Fuxi, what's wrong?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess shuddered slightly. She had no idea what would make Fuxi react in such a way. Following closely behind, she too stepped out into the light to see what Fuxi was looking at. Then, her body began to tremble violently.
<br><br>
In the distance, a giant ape the size of a mountain was ravaging through the debris that was once the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
"The Monkey Spirit King smashed the Ghost Mountain apart!"
<br><br>
"We can leave!"
<br><br>
"This is our chance to escape!"
<br><br>
Overcome with relief and joy, the human heroes began to jump in excitement.
<br><br>
On the surface, they were Great Ghost Priests, but truth of the matter was they were imprisoned slaves.
<br><br>
While creatures from the outside tried their best to get in, the human heroes within were actually trying their best to escape.
<br><br>
Now was their chance, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to finally leave this wretched place! "Let's go out first,"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven said cautiously.
<br><br>
Just as they were about to leave, they saw some Monkey Masters rushing out from the cracks of the Ghost Mountain, following closely behind the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
"Wait!"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven hissed, motioning for everyone to stop in their tracks.
<br><br>
If the Monkey Masters caught them trying to escape, they would probably be killed on the spot.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven watched closely as the Monkey Masters ran to catch up to their leader. They were surprisingly fast, even faster than the massive Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
"Why are those Monkey Masters desperately chasing after the Monkey Spirit King?" the Snake Goddess asked, puzzled.
<br><br>
It was strange enough that the Ghost Mountain split apart when the Monkey Spirit King awakened, but it was stranger still to see the Monkey Masters chasing after him.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Crack! Crack! Crack! As soon as the Monkey Spirit King jumped onto the Night View Island, he swiveled around and slapped at the Monkey Masters at his heels.
<br><br>
Those unfortunate enough to have caught up to him were blown away.
<br><br>
They smashed into the side of the Ghost Mountain, creating deep holes in the mountainside.
<br><br>
"The Monkey Spirit King is attacking the Monkey Masters!"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven cried out in shock.
<br><br>
"Look! The Eye Spirit is on the shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King!"
<br><br>
Zen pointed out. His eyesight was extremely sharp.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit and Sewell stood on each shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King like flies. The Monkey Spirit King had been moving very fast, so no one noticed them initially.
<br><br>
Upon hearing Zen's words, true enough, everyone saw that the Eye Spirit and Sewell were perched on the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Then, it instantly dawned on them.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was probably under the control of the Eye Spirit! "Hahaha..."
<br><br>
Emperor Charm laughed sarcastically.
<br><br>
He had long known that the Element Spirit Civilization was evil.
<br><br>
Something like this should've been expected from them. And yet, the superior Monkey Masters still chose to trust them.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm felt somewhat pleased to see that he had been right all along.
<br><br>
"Let's follow them and see what's going on! Everyone, follow me!"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven barked his orders and led the group as they flew out of the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Boom! Just as they arrived at the annular mountain range, they saw the Monkey Spirit King slam his huge body against a mountain like some lunatic.
<br><br>
Each mountain in the annular mountain range was hundreds of thousands of feet high, but next to the massive Monkey Spirit King, they looked like small hills.
<br><br>
Under the impact of the Monkey Spirit King's body, the mountain immediately collapsed.
<br><br>
There were two races living in that mountain. With their home being smashed into pieces, this was like the end of the world for them.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Once the mountain had completely collapsed, the Monkey Spirit King jumped high into the air and landed with a loud crash.
<br><br>
Boom! Under the impact, the whole Night View Island sank about thirty feet. The earth quaked outwards, like some violent ripple effect, causing a wild tsunami in the lake.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Boom! The Monkey Spirit King continued to wreak havoc haphazardly.
<br><br>
Sometimes he walked normally, but then he would suddenly smash his ginormous hands into the ground.
<br><br>
The creatures on the Night View Island were absolutely terrified. As the Monkey Spirit King, who was larger than their tallest mountain, ravaged the lands, they feared they would be smashed into a pulp.
<br><br>
"What the hell is the Monkey Spirit King doing?" Chiyou asked in confusion, his brows furrowing deeply.
<br><br>
The eyes of the Snake Goddess flickered with understanding. "He hasn't awakened yet, but he can sense that the Element Spirit Civilization is trying to control his body, so he is desperately trying to resist!"
<br><br>
"That makes sense." Fuxi nodded and continued, "It does seem like there are two forces fighting to control his body."
<br><br>
Chapter 4090 Take A Risk As soon as the Monkey Spirit King realized what happened to him, he began to struggle like mad in the dream.
<br><br>
He did not wake up, but it didn't mean that he could not do anything.
<br><br>
Then again, he always had a violent reaction every time a wolf tooth appeared, and there were thirteen wolf teeth in total this time.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, his struggles happened in a chaotic state.
<br><br>
He could not effectively control his body, so it only affected Sewell's control.
<br><br>
This also made his Treacherous Being body seem strange and contradictory.
<br><br>
Many races on the Night View Island got affected.
<br><br>
But as the commotion grew increasingly louder, more and more creatures noticed the mountain-like body. In a split second, they all left their territories and fled everywhere.
<br><br>
As for Sewell, his brows knitted in seriousness.
<br><br>
He tried his best to steer the Monkey Spirit King in the right direction as they stumbled towards the passageway of the Night View Island.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's struggle was only a hindrance, but he could still get subdued at any time.
<br><br>
He moved bit by bit, as he rolled and jumped.
<br><br>
And every time the Monkey Masters approached, Sewell always took advantage of his powers to slap them away one by one.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! At that moment, Claire and Gavyn, who had been waiting outside, quickly went near.
<br><br>
The two of them didn't expect such an accident to happen either. However, since the Eye Spirit had completed his task, they had to run away with him no matter what.
<br><br>
As the Monkey Spirit King acted like a crazed demon, both of them did not dare approach him, but instead, they followed him from a nearby distance.
<br><br>
Of course, Claire had also discovered Zen on the other side.
<br><br>
There were dozens of people around him, including four Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
They felt quite lucky since Zen did not make any trouble for them.
<br><br>
Naturally, they did not do anything to provoke him.
<br><br>
"The Monkey Spirit King is getting close to the exit in the middle of the lake," said Zhurong.
<br><br>
"We can't interfere. When they take the Monkey Spirit King away, we will also leave secretly," Emperor Charm said firmly.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess didn't say anything.
<br><br>
That was because they were thinking about a more pressing problem.
<br><br>
It was also an issue that had existed from the 77th chaos, until now.
<br><br>
It was the question of how to fight against the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Of course, the Nihility race, which was led by the Grandmaster of Heaven, was also their enemy now.
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect supported those two races.
<br><br>
With such strong forces, how could the human race fight them? The Human Spirit Sect? Yet, the memories of the energy souls that came out of Zen's body told them clearly that the Human Spirit Sect seemed to be on the side of the Element Spirit Civilization! Some of the human heroes remained slightly impassive, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess felt very disappointed.
<br><br>
They had stayed in the Ghost Mountain for so many years. Through frequent contact with the Monkey Masters, they knew about the structure of the Four Spirits Sect, albeit sporadically. At the same time, they also knew that there was a Human Spirit Sect in the Four Spirits Sect that belonged to the human race.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess had always had a kind of expectation, as they hoped that one day, the Human Spirit Sect would appear and fully support them.
<br><br>
Now, it seemed like a faraway dream.
<br><br>
If they could awaken the Monkey Spirit King, perhaps they could persuade him to let the Monkey Spirit Sect support the human race.
<br><br>
Alas, the Element Spirit Civilization would take the Monkey Spirit King away now.
<br><br>
What was worse was that they could not do anything but watch.
<br><br>
Even the unimaginably strong and powerful Monkey Masters were slapped away by the Monkey Spirit King, let alone these people.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Loud slaps filled the air as three more Monkey Masters got hit and sent flying away.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's punch was so powerful that it pushed those three Monkey Masters straight out of the Night View Island's territorial boundary.
<br><br>
Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle...
<br><br>
Then, the invisible little bugs devoured them and they disappeared in the Void Dust.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings could be revived infinitely, but the human race did not have the ability to do so.
<br><br>
While the Primeval Lord of Heaven hesitantly weighed his thoughts, Zen suddenly said, "No, we have to stop the Monkey Spirit King. We need his help!"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm looked at Zen in disbelief and asked, "Stop him? How do we stop him?"
<br><br>
These human heroes were highly intelligent. Although they did not think too much about it, they immediately understood Zen's intention.
<br><br>
However, none of the Monkey Masters could stop him, let alone them.
<br><br>
"We just need to break the Thirteen Teeth Necklace," Zen answered.
<br><br>
Upon hearing what he just said, everyone paid attention to the Monkey Spirit King's chest.
<br><br>
The Thirteen Teeth Necklace dangled around his neck by a tri-colored rope, and the end of the rope went into the back of his head.
<br><br>
"But I'm afraid we're not strong enough... Our efforts might get wasted,"
<br><br>
Chiyou said and shook his head.
<br><br>
"The hatred-level Treacherous Being is indeed quite strong, but that is still too weak for them," Zhurong agreed.
<br><br>
The four human Great Ghost Priests had merged with four hatred-level Treacherous Beings. When it came to strength, they were considered the best among the human heroes.
<br><br>
Therefore, everyone took the fact that they could always rely on them for granted.
<br><br>
"I have another idea. Why not use the Other Shore Tokens?" Zen suggested.
<br><br>
In turn, the human heroes were stunned.
<br><br>
Before they fused with the Treacherous Beings, they relied hugely on two things: their bloodlines and the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Compared to the Treacherous Being and the bloodline, the Other Shore Token was much more powerful and terrifying, and it was also changeable.
<br><br>
But after they had stayed in the Ghost Mountain for so long, they kind of forgot about the Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess perked up in anticipation.
<br><br>
Everyone present had the Other Shore Tokens from the Supreme Pure Realm and even the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Although these Other Shore Tokens were not as powerful as the ones they had when human beings were in their prime, their combined strengths were still fatal.
<br><br>
"I can help! I can help anyone get close to the Monkey Spirit King!"
<br><br>
Emperor Charm exclaimed.
<br><br>
With a slight shake of his shoulders, a pair of transparent wings emerged behind him.
<br><br>
The transparent wings seemed to be made of diamonds, as their entire crystalline structure shone brightly.
<br><br>
They were the Swift Bird's wings.
<br><br>
This kind of bird was from the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
It was known for flying so fast that no one could catch it. The moment anyone approached it, it quickly disappeared.
<br><br>
It was also impossible to measure the timespan when the bird moved from one place to another. Thus, it disappeared so suddenly, and that was why it was called the Swift Bird.
<br><br>
Theoretically speaking, the bird used a type of space traveling skill, but it had already made full use of space.
<br><br>
Its only disadvantage was that it took a few days to recover once it had used its wings.
<br><br>
To capture the Swift Bird, one had to force it to use its ability once, before they could catch it.
<br><br>
"Why don't you go by yourself?" Houyi glared at Emperor Charm. He had been silent all this time, and now he spoke up.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid of death," Emperor Charm replied.
<br><br>
"Send me there," the real Snake Goddess prompted.
<br><br>
"No! Let me do it!" Chiyou interjected with wide eyes.
<br><br>
"Stop arguing," said the real Fuxi, who stood in front of the crowd. Then he shouted, "Let me do it!"
<br><br>
Just then, a pair of black scissors appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
They were called the Sand Life Scissors.
<br><br>
Although it was only an Other Shore Token from the Supreme Pure Realm, it could directly cut off space.
<br><br>
"Don't forget that I have a Resurrection Egg," he added.
<br><br>
His Resurrection Egg was very rare and had a pretty simple ability. It could make the real Fuxi have two lives.
<br><br>
But even though so many chaotic eras had passed, the real Fuxi never had the chance to use it. Now was the right time for him to take a risk.
<br><br>
Chapter 4091 Tear Apart When the Monkey Spirit King stepped into the central lake, the water reached until his waist. With each step he took, a huge wave would ripple out.
<br><br>
As the Monkey Spirit King got closer and closer to the edge of the passageway, Sewell and the Eye Spirit grew more and more cautious.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters cried out crazily and rushed towards them desperately.
<br><br>
Killing a Treacherous Being was a bit complicated. The simplest way was to throw them into the Void Dust.
<br><br>
This tactic was proving effective for the Monkey Masters, as three or four of their kind had already been devoured by the Void Dust. Desperately, they changed their strategy and attempted to approach the Monkey Spirit King from a low altitude.
<br><br>
At least this way, even if they were knocked out by the Monkey Spirit King, they'd land in the lake and not the Void Dust.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Another three Monkey Masters closed in on the Monkey Spirit King's side.
<br><br>
However, the Monkey Spirit King twisted his body slightly and slapped at them.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop! The three Monkey Masters smashed into the water violently. The impact was so strong that the water shot into the sky as high as ten thousand feet.
<br><br>
As the Monkey Spirit King was steadying himself, Manual grabbed this opportunity and swooped in. Finally, he was able to land on his shoulder, face to face with Sewell.
<br><br>
"I guess you won't be able to leave," Manuel said coldly, as intricate golden patterns began to appear on his skin.
<br><br>
Then, in a flash, a tremendous amount of force was released from his body and shot towards Sewell.
<br><br>
"Annoying!"
<br><br>
Sewell's eyes narrowed, filled with killing intent. He nimbly dodged the blow, suddenly becoming incredibly fast.
<br><br>
Just as Manuel rushed over to strike once more, Sewell pounced onto him with great agility. In a flash, Sewell had managed to wrap himself around Manuel's body, gradually tightening his grip.
<br><br>
The Snake Masters were all good killers. Any living being trapped in their grasp were bound to die.
<br><br>
But now, Sewell was intertwined with the most powerful Great Ape King.
<br><br>
Manuel looked at Sewell with condescending, pitiful eyes. "Really? You're going to try to kill me this way? Don't even think about it!"
<br><br>
Sewell laughed sarcastically. "If I don't show you my strength, you'll never realize just how obsolete you are in this era. I'll kill you now, but next time, I'll erase your coordinates!"
<br><br>
The second he finished speaking, Sewell released bone spikes from his body.
<br><br>
These bone spikes had been deeply buried in his body. They were hollow and contained Holy Stones within them, which would ensure Sewell's safety when he used them.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! The bone spikes quickly embedded themselves into Manuel's body.
<br><br>
Once secured, the bones shattered automatically, revealing the Holy Stones within.
<br><br>
Buzz! All the Holy Stones released the Light of Annihilation simultaneously.
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation was fatal to any Treacherous Being. However, the stronger the Treacherous Being, the bigger the resistance to the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation was strong enough to directly kill hostility-level Treacherous Beings. The resentment-level Treacherous Beings had the ability to resist a blow, but they would be severely injured and irreparably damaged.
<br><br>
On the other hand, hatred-level Treacherous Beings could completely withstand the Light of Annihilation.
<br><br>
Manuel was stronger than hatred-level Treacherous Beings. Even if he was enveloped by the Light of Annihilation, he could come out of it unscathed.
<br><br>
Sewell, however, was extremely confident in the Holy Stones.
<br><br>
They were from the top of the four pillars, which meant they were of the highest grade.
<br><br>
When the Holy Stones exploded simultaneously to release massive amounts of Light of Annihilation, Manuel's body began to tremble violently as though he had been electrocuted.
<br><br>
His body, which he could normally manipulate freely, quickly hardened.
<br><br>
Hairline cracks appeared on its surface, crawling all over his body until countless white fragments flaked off.
<br><br>
With his body in this state, Manuel couldn't withstand Sewell's power.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Manuel's body began to collapse.
<br><br>
But by now, Sewell had already retreated.
<br><br>
With the dozens of Holy Stones releasing Light of Annihilation, even Sewell himself couldn't stand it.
<br><br>
Sewell and Manuel had been fighting on the shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King. Thus, when the Holy Stones exploded with Light of Annihilation, even the Monkey Spirit King was affected. Immediately, countless cracks appeared on his shoulder.
<br><br>
"Take back those Holy Stones!"
<br><br>
Sewell ordered the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
He was afraid of the Light of Annihilation, but the light had no effect on the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit sent over some eyeballs to retrieve the Holy Stones.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters who witnessed what happened were taken aback.
<br><br>
Manuel and Sewell were at the same level. In terms of strength, Manuel was much stronger than Sewell, but now he was killed.
<br><br>
Although they knew Manuel was going to revive from his coordinates, the Monkey Masters still felt hesitant to proceed.
<br><br>
"Hey, losers!" Sewell spat. "If you have the guts, keep on fighting!"
<br><br>
Casting them a cold glance, Sewell continued to guide the Monkey Spirit King towards the center of the lake.
<br><br>
He had several cards up his sleeve which he knew were enough to deal with the Monkey Masters.
<br><br>
But just then, a figure suddenly appeared in front of the chest of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
It was Fuxi.
<br><br>
He raised his head, holding up a pair of black scissors in his hand.
<br><br>
His eyes met with Sewell's, and he grinned wildly.
<br><br>
"How dare you!" Sewell cried indignantly.
<br><br>
How dare those humble humans take part in the battle of the Four Spirits Sect? They were courting death! At this moment, Sewell's mind was racing, but time was limited, so he only managed to spit out those three words.
<br><br>
Crack! Without any hesitation, Fuxi snipped off the Thirteen Teeth Necklace.
<br><br>
The rope made of Three Resentments Poison fell towards the water, along with the wolf teeth.
<br><br>
"Fuxi, you're courting death!"
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit suddenly floated up ominously, his eyes flashing with killing intent.
<br><br>
But Fuxi had retreated the second he snipped the cord.
<br><br>
The Swift Bird's wings on his back could only be used once. Now they had lost their effect. Whether he would come out of this alive depended solely on his luck.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters, who had been watching nearby, were stunned.
<br><br>
While they had noticed that the humans escaped from the Ghost Mountain, they had been preoccupied with the Eye Spirit and Sewell.
<br><br>
It never occurred to them that these humans would help them save the Monkey Spirit King! With the Thirteen Teeth Necklace broken, there was a glimmer of hope! Sewell didn't have the time to chase after Fuxi. Instead, he quickly controlled the three colored rope to try to string the wolf teeth once more.
<br><br>
Under his control, the three colored rope was like a nimble snake, chasing after the falling wolf teeth.
<br><br>
The wolf teeth had only fallen a thousand feet before they were easily caught and strung up by the three colored rope.
<br><br>
Everyone, from Fuxi, who had managed to retreat, to Zen and the Monkey Masters, felt despair when they saw this scene.
<br><br>
The flicker of hope that they had just sparked was instantly extinguished.
<br><br>
Zen held his breath as he watched the two ends of the rope were about to form a complete, closed loop.
<br><br>
However, the Monkey Spirit King's right hand suddenly reached up.
<br><br>
Grabbing the Thirteen Teeth Necklace on his chest, the Monkey Spirit King ripped it off his neck fiercely.
<br><br>
The Thirteen Teeth Necklace was destroyed! The three-colored rope that had drilled into the back of his head was also pulled out.
<br><br>
After Fuxi cut the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, Sewell's control over the Monkey Spirit King immediately weakened.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King, who was in the dream, immediately grabbed this opportunity. Using all his spirit power, he fought back against Sewell's control over his body.
<br><br>
Chapter 4092 Promise Once the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was pulled away, the Monkey Spirit King's body would instantly regain its freedom.
<br><br>
However, he was still in an unconscious state. His dream was firmly restricting his awakening.
<br><br>
Now that the wolf teeth left his body, his control over himself was also greatly weakened.
<br><br>
Because of this, his huge body was constantly moving and attacking the surrounding area.
<br><br>
He was madly releasing his power. That was why no one could just freely approach him.
<br><br>
He would roll, then dash here and there, and sometimes throw massive punches.
<br><br>
At the same time, Sewell still attempted to retrieve the wolf teeth that had fallen into the lake.
<br><br>
After all the efforts that he poured to make his plan work, he was not willing to fail just like this.
<br><br>
However, he also knew how dangerous it was to approach the lake because of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
With just his subconsciousness, he would attack any creature around him without exception.
<br><br>
Sewell and the Eye Spirit had attempted several times to get in the lake, but they failed miserably. The unconscious body of the Monkey Spirit King didn't give them any chance.
<br><br>
Finally, realizing that the mission had completely failed, Sewell gritted his teeth and ordered, "Let's go!"
<br><br>
Swoosh! He turned into a huge white shadow and drilled into the middle of the lake.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit, Claire, and Gavyn quickly followed into the lake.
<br><br>
As they dove into the middle of the lake, several Monkey Masters followed them behind.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters actually didn't want to hunt Sewell down.
<br><br>
They were more worried about the Monkey Spirit King. Moreover, because of the great changes that already happened to him, they had to keep watch all the more. Besides, even if they killed Sewell, he would just revive afterward.
<br><br>
Right now, their goal was to just expel Sewell and his companions and prevent them from destroying the passageway.
<br><br>
The passageway of the Night View Island was finally repaired after a long time. They wanted to do everything they could to prevent it from getting destroyed again.
<br><br>
However, in the desperate situation just now, they had considered to voluntarily destroy the passageway, if it was the only way to ensure the safety of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
They prepared themselves for this last resort if they had no other choice left.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! The Monkey Spirit King continued to struggle furiously.
<br><br>
At the same time, he was releasing a tremendous power in the middle of the lake.
<br><br>
Not even the Monkey Masters dared to approach him.
<br><br>
The power of the Monkey Spirit King was almost inexhaustible. No one exactly knew how long would this situation ensue.
<br><br>
Zen and his group just hovered over the lake and waited patiently and silently.
<br><br>
Then, three Monkey Masters flew over to them.
<br><br>
They were Tearrag, Hagar, and Nereus.
<br><br>
In the Monkey Spirit Sect, they were just a rank below Manuel.
<br><br>
"What can I do for you?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked respectfully.
<br><br>
He stepped forward and bowed as soon as he saw the Monkey Masters approach them.
<br><br>
Tearrag glanced at Fuxi and said, "We want to thank you for helping our king."
<br><br>
"You could've just escaped during the fight just now. Why did you bother to take such a big risk just to save our king?" Hagar asked with a straight face.
<br><br>
These Monkey Masters had a clear sense of mind. For Zen and the others to take that kind of risk, they must have some ulterior motive.
<br><br>
Although these humans had been staying in the Ghost Mountain for countless years, they belonged to a different world and didn't really have a harmonious relationship with them.
<br><br>
So, right now, they just wanted to set things straight.
<br><br>
"I know what you mean. And yes, it's because we have something to ask from the Monkey Spirit King, or technically, from the entire Monkey Spirit Sect," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with honesty.
<br><br>
"The entire sect? Does that mean you want us to support you?" Nereus asked.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven let out a faint smile due to their straightforwardness.
<br><br>
"Yes," he replied frankly.
<br><br>
"Well, we have no say in this matter," Tearrag said as he shrugged his shoulders.
<br><br>
"Actually, even Manuel can't make the decision," Hagar added.
<br><br>
"We understand that only the Ghost Master can make the decision," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a faint smile.
<br><br>
"I'm glad you understand. If he doesn't wake up, we can't do anything about your request," Nereus remarked.
<br><br>
"Then, what if I wake him up?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly asked. The eyes of the three Monkey Masters instantly lit up as they heard his words.
<br><br>
They looked at each other and nodded afterward.
<br><br>
They had known the Primeval Lord of Heaven for a long while.
<br><br>
He had established his reputation, and they knew that he wouldn't say such words without being sure that he could fulfill it.
<br><br>
Hearing it from him, the Monkey Masters had begun to see a glimmer of hope.
<br><br>
"You can really do that?" Tearrag asked just to make sure. "There is a way," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied.
<br><br>
"That's good to hear then," Tearrag answered.
<br><br>
"If you can wake our king up, we will definitely put in a good word for you," he added.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters were unable to make a decision themselves, but the Monkey Spirit King had the utmost trust in his subordinates, so he would absolutely consider their advice.
<br><br>
For the Primeval Lord of Heaven, that was already enough. He just wanted to make sure that the Monkey Masters would keep their end of the bargain.
<br><br>
"Now, I want you to collect all of the wolf teeth," the Primeval Lord of Heaven instructed.
<br><br>
"Sure. And then?" Hagar asked. This was an important mission to them, so he wanted to hear the full details of the plan.
<br><br>
If possible, the Monkey Masters wanted to know what the Primeval Lord of Heaven would exactly do to wake the Monkey Spirit King up.
<br><br>
"After that, you can leave the rest to us," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with a cautious expression.
<br><br>
The secret of the ancestry-level bloodline should be kept as a top secret.
<br><br>
So, he couldn't just tell it even to the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters understood what the Primeval Lord of Heaven meant, so they didn't pry further. What was more important was to save their king.
<br><br>
With that, they quickly dove into the water and began looking for the wolf teeth.
<br><br>
The wolf teeth had actually become very large, so it wouldn't be that difficult to find them.
<br><br>
With the Monkey Spirit King eventually moving towards the northern part of the Night View Island, they soon found all of the thirteen wolf teeth.
<br><br>
As they waited patiently, the Monkey Spirit King's madness lasted longer than everyone had imagined.
<br><br>
In total, it lasted for ten whole days.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he had stayed in the water. Thus only the northern part of the annular mountain range was damaged severely.
<br><br>
After ten days, the Monkey Spirit King eventually calmed down.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters couldn't figure out a way to move his huge body, so they just let him stay and sit in the lake.
<br><br>
During the past ten days when the Monkey Spirit King had wreaked havoc in the Night View Island, many inhabitants were greatly affected.
<br><br>
After the Ghost Mountain was broken, a lot of hostility-level and hatredlevel Treacherous Beings tried fleeing from the place, but they were all caught and taken back by the Monkey Masters and the Great Ghost Priests.
<br><br>
The members of the Red Demon race, the Glede Demon race, and the Grand Mighty race who had been waiting at the Ghost Altar also secretly went back to their territories.
<br><br>
When they observed the vicious fight between the Monkey Masters and Sewell, they secretly guessed what had happened.
<br><br>
During the past ten days, Tate and Murdock grew anxious for each passing day.
<br><br>
They knew that if they remained there, there was a huge possibility that they would die.
<br><br>
However, the passageway to the island was tightly guarded by the Monkey Masters, and thus escaping was very impossible for them.
<br><br>
In short, for the past few days, they accepted that they could just wait quietly for their impending death.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the atmosphere in the Glede Demon race was much more relaxed.
<br><br>
Although the Night View Island had undergone exceptional changes and all creatures would also probably face unforeseen changes in the future, the Glede Demon race had an advantage because they had chosen to follow the humans.
<br><br>
At that time, Decker was originally guarded by Bainbridge.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the Ghost Mountain collapsed, Bainbridge fled and left him alone. Seeing that he was freed, he left the mountain and returned to the Wooden Leaf race.
<br><br>
This time, he entered the Ghost Mountain to try his luck. He thought that perhaps, he could fuse with a powerful hostility-level Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Though there might be resentment-level ones there, he didn't dare to think of fusing with them.
<br><br>
But unexpectedly, he had got a hatred-level Treacherous Being named Cary.
<br><br>
Cary was still in his glazed sheet now.
<br><br>
Decker didn't try to fuse with him, but he still mustered his courage to communicate with him through his consciousness.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Cary turned out to be a friendly-type Treacherous Being, so he didn't repel Decker.
<br><br>
After a few days of constant communication, they got along better.
<br><br>
This made Decker totally excited.
<br><br>
He was thinking what the patriarch would say and react once he saw him with Cary.
<br><br>
Even if Decker didn't fuse with the Treacherous Being, he would still have unparalleled combat power.
<br><br>
Thinking of this, he went home briskly.
<br><br>
However, as he returned to the territory of the Wooden Leaf race, his eyes widened as he clenched his fists. He saw that a group of warriors from the Evil Tiger race were besieging the hillside where the Wooden Leaf race peacefully dwelled.
<br><br>
Chapter 4093 At A Loss The Evil Tiger race had always cast rather covetous eyes upon the Wooden Leaf race.
<br><br>
While the Wooden Leaf race was weak, they were still capable of protecting themselves.
<br><br>
Relying on the power of the thorny Treacherous Beings, in particular, they hid at the mountainside which was easy to hold but difficult to attack.
<br><br>
But because the Wooden Leaf race wasn't of much value, the Evil Tiger race was in no hurry to attack them.
<br><br>
Graham and Decker had already sensed an oncoming crisis. There were so many races on the Night View Island. Many weak races had been eliminated.
<br><br>
Such was why Decker took the risk of following Zen, wanting to grow stronger.
<br><br>
Over the past few days, the situation on the Night View Island had undergone a drastic change.
<br><br>
The Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race were both destined to be exterminated—the races that followed them had fallen into chaos.
<br><br>
But the drastic change was undoubtedly likely to bring great benefits to some races.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of the chaos, the Evil Tiger race attacked the Wooden Leaf race.
<br><br>
In the lead, Graham brought many of the soldiers up to the top to hide.
<br><br>
Now, they were desperate.
<br><br>
It wasn't that the Evil Tiger race couldn't defeat them.
<br><br>
But the Wooden Leaf race had been well-prepared to fight to the death. If the Evil Tiger race forced their way up, they would definitely suffer heavy casualties.
<br><br>
But since the Evil Tiger race had already made a move, they weren't about to give up so easily.
<br><br>
"Master Graham, can we try to parley with them?" asked one of the Wooden Leaf race's soldiers.
<br><br>
Graham's smile was bitter. "What do you think?"
<br><br>
The Evil Tiger race did not communicate with the Wooden Leaf race.
<br><br>
They had slaughtered more than ten members of the Wooden Leaf race as soon as they came.
<br><br>
And they were completely determined to exterminate the Wooden Leaf race.
<br><br>
Slowly, the Evil Tiger race's warriors approached the mountainside.
<br><br>
At this point, they were ready to rush forward at any moment.
<br><br>
The air was heavy.
<br><br>
No one even wanted to blink.
<br><br>
"If you attack us, you'll lose over half of your men. By then, the Ghost Face race in the adjacent mountain will not let you go!" Graham suddenly shouted out.
<br><br>
The Ghost Face race was a hard nut to crack.
<br><br>
If the Evil Tiger race suffered several casualties, the Ghost Face race would undoubtedly take the opportunity to attack.
<br><br>
But the Evil Tiger race's leader chuckled. "You don't need to worry about that. The Ghost Face race has already moved out!"
<br><br>
The said race used to be a major hindrance to the Evil Tiger race. With them gone, the Evil Tiger race had nothing to worry about.
<br><br>
As they talked, the warriors of the Evil Tiger race took a few more steps forward, now only a hundred feet away from the nearest members of the Wooden Leaf race.
<br><br>
Graham gritted his teeth, his heart filling with hesitation. While he wanted his soldiers to attack, he knew it would mean his people's doomsday.
<br><br>
"Look!" A member of the Wooden Leaf race pointed into the distance.
<br><br>
"Decker is back!"
<br><br>
"It's Decker!"
<br><br>
"He's back from the Ghost Mountain!"
<br><br>
Many of them began exclaiming, their voices full of hope.
<br><br>
Looking into the distance, Graham smiled bitterly.
<br><br>
'So what if Decker came back?' he thought.
<br><br>
With Decker's strength, what achievement could he have possibly made in the Ghost Mountain? At the very best, he could have probably fused with a hostility-level Treacherous Being, but that would do nothing to help the situation.
<br><br>
The Evil Tiger race had also taken notice of Decker's arrival in the distance.
<br><br>
Their leader looked back and sneered. Picking out three warriors from the group, he ordered, "Deal with him!"
<br><br>
The three warriors then summoned the Wind Ghosts. These ghosts floated down the mountain rapidly.
<br><br>
In their eyes, Decker was merely a fish on a chopping block.
<br><br>
But just as they approached, Decker pulled out his glazed sheet and asked, "Are you willing to help me?"
<br><br>
In the past few days, he had gotten on harmoniously with Cary.
<br><br>
As a friendly-type Treacherous Being, Cary was as simple as a child, regarding Decker as his friend.
<br><br>
While he was unwilling to leave the glazed sheet, Cary wouldn't hesitate to take action when his friend was in need, especially since the opponents seemed far too weak to give him any trouble.
<br><br>
"Sure," Cary merely said.
<br><br>
After getting his reply, Decker was expressionless as he gave the order, "Kill them all."
<br><br>
When the warriors of the Evil Tiger race approached Decker, their eyes narrowed ferociously—they had been so close, but Decker was adamantly resisting.
<br><br>
Just as the thought flashed through their minds, three sharp spines suddenly extended from the glazed sheet.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! They pierced accurately through the warriors of the Evil Tiger race.
<br><br>
Along with them, they pierced through the Wind Ghosts attached to their bodies as well.
<br><br>
Slowly, Cary drilled out of the glazed sheet, retracting the three spines back to his back.
<br><br>
Now, the three warriors of the Evil Tiger race were attached to his back.
<br><br>
The moment had the entire Wooden Leaf race and Evil Tiger race completely stunned.
<br><br>
Cary's aura was undoubtedly gentle.
<br><br>
But they could tell that he wasn't at the hostility level nor the resentment level.
<br><br>
The terrifying fact was that he was at the hatred level.
<br><br>
A chill ran down the spine of the Evil Tiger race's leader.
<br><br>
To think that Decker had brought back a hatred-level Treacherous Being with him.
<br><br>
Such was something only the Great Ghost Priests were known to be able to do, and even then, it was highly difficult for them to leave the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
It was completely unheard of.
<br><br>
While he couldn't believe what he saw, he knew he had to take it as it was.
<br><br>
Just then, Cary started rushing toward the Evil Tiger race.
<br><br>
"Run!"
<br><br>
"This is a hatred-level Treacherous Being!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God!"
<br><br>
No trace of arrogance was left on the faces of the Evil Tiger race's warriors.
<br><br>
Instead, they all ran away without hesitation.
<br><br>
While Cary looked like he was moving slowly, he was actually going at an astonishing speed.
<br><br>
He shifted into a huge ball, shooting fast and piercing through the members of the Evil Tiger race, hanging their corpses on his back like they were nothing.
<br><br>
In mere seconds, all the members of the Evil Tiger race were completely slaughtered.
<br><br>
There was a moment of silence before the members of the Wooden Leaf race let out a loud cheer.
<br><br>
Graham's eyes were still wide in disbelief.
<br><br>
The human race no longer returned to the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
At their request, a grotto was created in the south of the Night View Island.
<br><br>
There, the thirteen wolf teeth were neatly placed.
<br><br>
To prevent the Monkey Masters from spying on them, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the rest had set up several enchanted barriers.
<br><br>
"The ancestry-level bloodline hates being separated from my body."
<br><br>
"If you get it out of your body without its permission, you will suffer, indeed."
<br><br>
They had tried several methods to use the ancestry-level bloodline's power, but to no avail.
<br><br>
"I'm sure it has intelligence," said the real Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"I tried communicating with it before I entered the Night View Island, but I also failed," Zen said, shrugging his shoulders.
<br><br>
"But judging from what it did before, it must have a specific purpose,"
<br><br>
remarked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded and said, "It only takes the initiative to make a move if it thinks the situation is in its favor. Otherwise, it will only protect Zen passively."
<br><br>
"Since we can't communicate with or persuade it, it's almost impossible to ask its help," said Emperor Charm pessimistically.
<br><br>
The entire grotto fell silent.
<br><br>
Originally, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had been confident.
<br><br>
But after several attempts, there was no breakthrough whatsoever.
<br><br>
Just as everyone was left at a loss, Zen suddenly stood up and walked up to a wolf tooth.
<br><br>
Crack! And then, he cut into his arm.
<br><br>
Through the wound, the ancestry-level bloodline could be observed.
<br><br>
But the ancestry-level bloodline was rather thick. When it shrank within the wound, not even a single drop of blood fell.
<br><br>
Chapter 4094 The Energy Of A Drop Of Blood (Part One) Glowing before the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other human heroes was the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
They attempted to trace it with their eyes. Its very existence was unusual to them. Its aura was truly unlike any other aura they had ever felt from the blended bloodlines.
<br><br>
The blended bloodlines of the thirteen wolf teeth had thirteen different auras, each with their own special quality.
<br><br>
For instance, the wolf tooth on the furthest right held the power of fire, from which its scorching aura truly radiated. Its aura was so strong that even if the tooth had been damaged, it still emitted heat. If one inched towards it, they would feel a burning sensation seep into their flesh.
<br><br>
The third wolf tooth from the right radiated a completely different aura.
<br><br>
Unlike the previous one, this one was soft and quiet, comfortable even. If one laid their hands upon it, tension would disappear completely from their bodies, being replaced with serenity.
<br><br>
There were other auras in the thirteen wolf teeth. Some complemented each other; some opposed each other. Either way, with all of the auras' complexities, it was difficult to deny the teeth were extraordinary.
<br><br>
The aura of the ancestry-level bloodline was also extraordinary but for a different reason.
<br><br>
To Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions, it was obvious the ancestry-level bloodline's composition was unusual, but even so, they knew it was far from complex.
<br><br>
It was the simplest thing. It was pure and perfect.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed, putting a hand over his chest.
<br><br>
None of them knew how the Four Spirits Sect was able to obtain such an excellent object.
<br><br>
Out of all of them there, it was Zen who knew how truly powerful the ancestry-level bloodline was. Because of this, it was him who knew how to appreciate it the most for all it was.
<br><br>
However, he also knew that despite how powerful it was, it was nothing unless he was able to make use of it.
<br><br>
Moreover, the ancestry-level bloodline had a mind of its own. No one was able to control it. It made its own decisions.
<br><br>
It could decide to help Zen, but it could also devour him completely.
<br><br>
Despite this, Zen decided its power was worth the risk. After he made a cut on his arm, he spoke, "I do not know whose side you are on, but more than ever, I need you to hear me out. The Monkey Spirit King is in a deep slumber. Only the thirteen wolf teeth can wake him up! If you are against the Monkey Spirit King, then continue ignoring me! But if you are willing to help him, I beg you. Please restore the bloodlines of the wolf teeth!"
<br><br>
He knew this was a desperate action, but he had to do it. Knowing no one was able to force the ancestry-level bloodline into doing any course of action, he called onto it directly, telling it the problem they were facing.
<br><br>
This was the most he could do to persuade it into taking their side.
<br><br>
A few of the human heroes looked at Zen with a mixture of wonder and pity on their faces.
<br><br>
What he was doing was so out-of-character.
<br><br>
For them, it was inconceivable to see Zen talk to his own bloodline and try to ask it to do something.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen felt frustrated about this. Moreover, with the lack of response from the ancestry-level bloodline, he was beginning to lose hope.
<br><br>
But a few seconds later, to his surprise, he felt something trickling down his arm. He looked down and saw a drop of blood leaving his wound. It was the ancestry-level bloodline! Zen's eyes widened. He could not believe what he was seeing in front of him. Since he had fused with it, this was the first time it had listened to him and left his body! It submitted to his request! 'Yes!' Zen cheered, holding his arm as he stood up in excitement.
<br><br>
Da! The others all heard and looked at the source of the sound. To everyone's surprise, it was the drop of blood.
<br><br>
They knew how it would look, but no one was aware of how it weighed.
<br><br>
Surprisingly enough, it was extremely heavy.
<br><br>
It was only the size of a soybean, but it was so weighty that it fell to the ground with a loud thud, calling everyone's attention.
<br><br>
After a few seconds, the drop of blood that fell to the ground rolled towards the nearest wolf tooth. It climbed right on top of it and seeped into it until it could no longer be seen.
<br><br>
After a few seconds, the wolf tooth's once dull aura began to revitalize.
<br><br>
Like an old man returning to his youth, the wolf tooth gained its strength back! The holes that once covered the tooth were filled. The cracks that were once there were suddenly gone. Its once gray color was replaced with a soft pearl.
<br><br>
And its glow began to grow brighter and brighter. It was finally alive, and it was making itself known! Its impressive aura was reaching lengths far beyond it, filling the cave.
<br><br>
It made it nearly impossible for the human heroes to breathe.
<br><br>
"Is this the wolf tooth's true form?" the real Fuxi asked, astonishment evident in his tone.
<br><br>
"This is what the Monkey Spirit King needs!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed.
<br><br>
He had studied the wolf teeth for years. The stories he read and the people he discussed them with would speak of their tremendous power, but he secretly thought that the wolf teeth were too weak to awaken the sleeping Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
It was not until now, having seen the wolf tooth in its true form of vitality, did the Primeval Lord of Heaven realize it was truly full of power.
<br><br>
It was so strong and powerful that its aura penetrated through the enchanted barriers of the cave. Even Tearrag, Hagar and Nereus, who remained outside of the cave to guard it from unwanted visitors, felt its aura.
<br><br>
Truth be told, when they agreed to the Primeval Lord of Heaven's request, they did not have much hope in their hearts that they would succeed. They did it out of their sheer loyalty to the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Tearrag, having felt the revitalized aura of the wolf tooth, began to wear expressions of incredulity on his face.
<br><br>
"These humans," he said, shaking his head in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Have they really repaired the wolf tooth? Are they really able to fix them?" he continued.
<br><br>
He felt the excitement rush through his veins. Before his mind could even think about it, his feet were already moving, rushing inside of the cave.
<br><br>
Bang! He had just passed through one of the enchanted barriers outside the cave.
<br><br>
There were several more ahead of him.
<br><br>
With his exceptional strength, he knew he would be able to pass through all of them without a sweat.
<br><br>
But then, he remembered the promise he had made to the Primeval Lord of Heaven. After they built the cave, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had made them promise that no matter what would happen, they would not enter the cave and pry into the process of awakening the Monkey Spirit King. And they agreed.
<br><br>
Chapter 4095 The Energy Of A Drop Of Blood (Part Two) So Tearrag, despite his curiosity and excitement, resisted the urge to break through the enchanted barriers and see the wolf tooth for himself. Instead, he fell on his knees and offered a silent wish.
<br><br>
He said, "Humans, I do not care what method you use. Please do your best to restore the rest of the wolf teeth."
<br><br>
Little did Tearrag know that as he was doing this, the drop of blood, which entered into the first wolf tooth, moved into the second wolf tooth. The magic that happened with the first one also happened with the second one! Its dents were fixed. It gained its color, and it glowed even brighter! The drop of blood then rolled into the third wolf tooth, the fourth one, and then the fifth one! It went on and on! Tearrag was shocked to feel the waves of auras one after the other. The human heroes inside the cave felt the same way.
<br><br>
Before this, none of them knew how many drops were needed from the ancestry-level bloodline in order to restore the thirteen wolf teeth. All of them suspected it would take a large amount to fix something so broken.
<br><br>
But the reality was something they did not even consider.
<br><br>
Only a single drop of blood was needed to restore all of the wolf teeth.
<br><br>
Soon enough, it repaired all of them! The thirteen wolf teeth glowed, and their merged aura was more powerful than ever.
<br><br>
As soon as the drop of blood restored all of the teeth, it climbed up Zen's arm. It went directly towards his wound and entered it, sending off the same stream of energy it had given the wolf teeth to his arm. A few seconds later, the long wound on Zen's arm was fading into clear and smooth skin. The drop of blood healed his wound so quickly. It was as if nothing ever happened to it! "This bloodline..." the real Chiyou trailed. "It is so amazing! I really have no words for it," he continued, his eyebrows still furrowed in disbelief.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven approached Zen, putting a hand over his shoulder. "Everyone," he said, calling all of their attention. "Because of Zen, we were able to accomplish the impossible. Let us hope that this luck goes on until the end of our journey."
<br><br>
By no means was doing what they had just done an easy task, and by no means what they were yet to do was easy as well. However, with this success, they began to feel hopeful.
<br><br>
What they were previously worried about was how to deceive the Monkey Spirit King. Although most of the Monkey Masters did not give much thought to what method they had used to wake the Monkey Spirit King up, there was still the possibility that some of them and even Monkey Spirit King himself would figure out the truth.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was very knowledgeable. Once he awakened, in an instant, he would know that it was the ancestry-level bloodline that had restored the thirteen wolf teeth.
<br><br>
But having reached so far already, the group knew that fear could not be a choice.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven raised his arms up, and as he did, the enchanted barriers guarding the cave had been brought down, giving access to those who wished to enter. Tearrag, who had been waiting so long for this opportunity, immediately ran inside.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the restored thirteen wolf teeth, he cried out in happiness.
<br><br>
"Yes!" he exclaimed, his voice being loud enough for it to reverberate throughout the cave. In this state of celebration, he quickly acted, sending the information of the restored wolf teeth back to Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
After Manuel was killed, he revived inside the Ghost Mountain, wherein he led the Monkey Masters and the Great Ghost Priests to repair the place.
<br><br>
Even though Manuel was busy, upon hearing the news, he immediately dropped whatever he was doing and rushed to the cave to see if the news was true.
<br><br>
Following him were all the Monkey Masters, who were also eager to see if the thirteen wolf teeth had truly been restored.
<br><br>
Although Manuel wanted so badly for the news to be true, he could not shake off the doubt in the back of his head.
<br><br>
He used to be the star of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, so he knew that the ancestry-level bloodline was the only object to be able to restore the thirteen wolf teeth to their original forms, and the ancestry-level bloodline was something a person could not get a hold of so easily.
<br><br>
Could it be that these humans were able to reach the ancestry-level bloodline? The thought of it was more absurd than being able to restore the wolf teeth. But it was there. It was real.
<br><br>
Manuel shook off his confusion and focused on what was in front of him.
<br><br>
He called on a Monkey Master.
<br><br>
The Monkey Master brought out a long hemp rope from the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
He pierced the hemp rope into the wolf teeth, forming a necklace. The Monkey Master carried it in his hand, making sure not to scratch or drop such delicate and important objects. Manuel said, "Bring the Thirteen Teeth Necklace to the Monkey Spirit King. Make sure no harm comes to the necklace on the way." The Monkey Master nodded and went on his way.
<br><br>
All of the Monkey Masters went to the sleeping Monkey Spirit King, making sure the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was safe and used by the one who needed it the most.
<br><br>
When they arrived, none of them dared to be too close to the Monkey Spirit King. They all knew he had just undergone a traumatic crisis. He was only experiencing the world in his dreams, but his dreams convoluted his reality, making his actions unpredictable. They did not know how he would react to them, so they took caution.
<br><br>
They knew the Monkey Spirit King might attack if he sensed there was something wrong.
<br><br>
Swoosh! With a quick yet careful flick of a wrist, the Monkey Master carrying the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was able to drop it onto the Monkey Spirit King's neck.
<br><br>
Being asleep and deep in a restless dream, the Monkey Spirit King was not able to see what had been placed upon him, but he was able to feel it.
<br><br>
He felt the additional weight that had been placed upon his neck, and it took up its own form in his dream.
<br><br>
In the darkness of his sleep, he saw something glowing from the corner of his vision. It was the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, and it had just arrived in his world of dream.
<br><br>
Chapter 4096 The Smart Monkey Spirit King The Monkey Spirit King had no idea what was happening in real life.
<br><br>
But with his limited perception, he could still tell the good from the bad.
<br><br>
Anyone would regret wanting to hurt him while trying to wake him up.
<br><br>
The Thirteen Teeth Necklace floated through the dream smoothly. This time, the Monkey Spirit King didn't dodge anymore. Instead, he walked towards it and let it rest around his neck.
<br><br>
As it did, the dream started to break with cracks growing from its edges.
<br><br>
It was like a huge mirror being smashed by a strong force.
<br><br>
The dream that trapped the Monkey Spirit King for more than one thousand chaotic eras was finally destroyed.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's eyelids moved as he struggled to open them.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters noticed and rushed towards him one after another.
<br><br>
They stood on the water and stared at him with excitement.
<br><br>
The moment his eyes opened, Manuel had led all the Monkey Masters to kneel on the water.
<br><br>
"Greetings, my king!" they shouted as they welcomed the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Their voices echoed throughout the whole Night View Island.
<br><br>
"You have fallen asleep for more than one thousand chaotic eras. I felt so sorry that I couldn't wake you up," Manuel said.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King sat straight and looked around the central lake as if he didn't hear what Manuel had said.
<br><br>
For over a thousand chaotic eras, he had stayed motionless in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
Now he felt like a prisoner released from prison, curious about everything outside.
<br><br>
Splash! He suddenly stood from the water, carrying his huge body. He then leaped towards the top of a mountain, which only appeared as a small hill for his size.
<br><br>
Perhaps it was because he was too excited that he jumped high once more.
<br><br>
The power of the Monkey Spirit King's feet caused the small hill to crumble into thousands of pieces.
<br><br>
"My king, stop doing that!" Manuel frighteningly warned as he saw the Monkey Spirit King flying into the air.
<br><br>
The sky above the Night View Island was covered with Void Dust.
<br><br>
If the Monkey Spirit King reached the Void Dust, he would be devoured.
<br><br>
However, it was too late. The Monkey Spirit King had flown upward, causing his head to be eroded by the Void Dust.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! The Void Dust quickly found its way to also devour his entire body.
<br><br>
Surprised, the Monkey Spirit King fell, his feet stepping heavily on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
Boom! The whole Night View Island shook at the impact that was almost the magnitude of an earthquake.
<br><br>
Since the Monkey Spirit King had awakened, being devoured by the Void Dust wasn't a big deal.
<br><br>
He could still be revived in the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
"Manuel, what happened before I woke up?" asked the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
He encountered a huge threat in his dream and he had to investigate it.
<br><br>
Manuel went forward and told the Monkey Spirit King what had recently happened to the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's eyes flared with resentment when he learned that Sewell had done all those things.
<br><br>
In his dream, he had already judged that it was the doing of the Snake Spirit Sect. Now that he confirmed, he seethed with anger.
<br><br>
"The corporeal body that I had been proud of has been destroyed, and they still want to take away my current body as a Treacherous Being. They are going too far!" the Monkey Spirit King roared.
<br><br>
Manuel looked at him calmly.
<br><br>
'His long slumber has not seemed to change his temperament at all, ' Manuel thought.
<br><br>
After the Monkey Spirit King had calmed down, Manuel revealed, "You escaped from harm and have finally awakened, but it was not because of us."
<br><br>
"What? Then who could it be?" the Monkey Spirit King asked with surprise in his eyes.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters were the most powerful soldiers under his command.
<br><br>
Was there anyone else stronger than Manuel? "It's those humans," answered Manuel as he pointed to them. "They not only stopped Sewell from taking you away but also repaired the Thirteen Teeth Necklace."
<br><br>
"Humans?" The Monkey Spirit King directed his eyes towards them and asked, "Are they the descendants of human spirits?"
<br><br>
"They have a great connection with human spirits. They are considered human spirits born in the secondary world," replied Manuel.
<br><br>
Many human spirits, snake spirits, monkey spirits, and bird spirits were born in the secondary worlds.
<br><br>
"Wait!" The Monkey Spirit King paused. "You mean these humans have repaired the Thirteen Teeth Necklace?" he repeated.
<br><br>
The Thirteen Teeth Necklace had already run out of its bloodline power.
<br><br>
How did it regain the bloodline power? The Monkey Spirit King got immersed in the joy of awakening that he did not realize it.
<br><br>
Now that he deeply thought about it, he was startled.
<br><br>
The only way to repair the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was to use the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Even if he brought the Thirteen Teeth Necklace to the Eternal Divine Courtyard, it would be difficult to repair it.
<br><br>
Then how did they repair the wolf teeth in the Night View Island? It was also impossible! The Monkey Spirit King was convinced that the Thirteen Teeth Necklace on his neck was not fake.
<br><br>
That was why his face was painted with utmost shock.
<br><br>
The human race stood on another mountain peak. They quietly observed what was happening.
<br><br>
They saw the Monkey Spirit King's face clearly as he conversed with Manuel.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess analyzed the possible reactions and results, and they presumed that the situation was just fine.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was bold and generous. They believed that he was not willful nor cruel.
<br><br>
They discussed in low voices and the Primeval Lord of Heaven already had an explanation in mind.
<br><br>
However, the Monkey Spirit King was much more sensitive than the Primeval Lord of Heaven had imagined.
<br><br>
He quickly noticed Zen who was standing at the back of the crowd.
<br><br>
He stretched out a finger and pointed at Zen. "Come here," he ordered.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't surprised at this.
<br><br>
He was sure that the Monkey Spirit King would investigate the repair of the wolf teeth, yet he did not expect to be noticed only at a glance.
<br><br>
Approaching the Monkey Spirit King, Zen bowed to him with clasped hands.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King looked at him with a grin across his face, while Manuel and the others were puzzled by what they saw.
<br><br>
They knew that the one who had saved the Monkey Spirit King was Fuxi, and the one who had repaired the wolf teeth was the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
It was none of Zen's business.
<br><br>
This young man did not come from the Ghost Mountain. He came from the outside not long ago.
<br><br>
"Was it you who helped me wake up?" asked the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "It wasn't just me. We worked together to wake you up."
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King stared at Zen with great interest. "But they don't have the specific bloodline. What surprises me more is that it can only be kept in the sacred cup. Why could you use it? How did you do it?" he asked curiously.
<br><br>
Manuel and the others all looked at Zen in disbelief as they heard the Monkey Spirit King's words.
<br><br>
The only bloodline that had to be kept in the sacred cup was the ancestrylevel bloodline.
<br><br>
According to the Monkey Spirit King, Zen had the ancestry-level bloodline in his body! They suspected that the Monkey Spirit King could have made a mistake.
<br><br>
Maybe he just talked nonsense.
<br><br>
After all, it was impossible to inherit the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Everyone in the Four Spirits Sect was informed of this fact.
<br><br>
Some people speculated that the ancestry-level bloodline could be replenished and there was a slight possibility of inheriting it, but it was impossible for even half of the light columns to light up.
<br><br>
That legend was never real in the long history of the main world.
<br><br>
Chapter 4097 One Goal Now, the Monkey Masters saw the legend unfold in the chaos, and it made them uneasy.
<br><br>
If the main world were compared to a huge world, the chaos would just be a small puddle.
<br><br>
So a human who came from the puddle inherited the ancestry-level bloodline? It seemed like a joke.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Monkey Spirit King waited patiently for Zen to speak.
<br><br>
This was surprising, especially because among the four leaders of the Four Spirits Sect, he was the most impatient and innocent one.
<br><br>
When the Four Spirits Sect attacked their enemies on the edge of the main world, he fought hundreds of battles and took thousands of lives.
<br><br>
All of this was just to save a Monkey Master who was not even important to the Monkey Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Being imprisoned in the dream for more than a thousand chaotic eras, he reflected on everything he had done.
<br><br>
If he were more cautious and less naive, would things have ended differently? He did not know how many times he had this thought.
<br><br>
Was it a millions times? Or did it go over a hundred million times? When he realized that Zen had the ancestry-level bloodline in his body, he was shocked but did his best to maintain a calm expression.
<br><br>
"I don't know.
<br><br>
The Eternal Divine Courtyard was already deserted by the time I arrived.
<br><br>
When I entered the sacred cup, the light columns lit up,"
<br><br>
Zen replied genuinely.
<br><br>
The Eternal Divine Courtyard was built by the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
It seemed that the Monkey Spirit King knew more about the ancestrylevel bloodline than Zen ever did.
<br><br>
Zen could no longer hide from him, so he decided it was best to answer honestly.
<br><br>
Moreover, it was a good step to get the Monkey Spirit King on his side.
<br><br>
"Light columns? How many would you say lit up?" the Monkey Spirit King asked patiently.
<br><br>
"If I recall correctly, it was all of them," replied Zen.
<br><br>
The jaws of Manuel, Hagar, Tearrag and Nereus dropped down in awe.
<br><br>
Though they wanted to react, all of them were speechless.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the expression of the Monkey Spirit King was hard to read.
<br><br>
He mastered the art of keeping still, and could probably do so even if the whole world collapsed right in front of him.
<br><br>
Even when the rest gasped, his expression never changed.
<br><br>
"Why all?" asked the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
This didn't make any sense. Mere talent was not a reason, either.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head in confusion. "I... I don't know."
<br><br>
One hundred and eighty-seven light columns had risen. At that time, he was completely immersed in the ancestry-level bloodline, so he paid no attention to the outside world.
<br><br>
The moment he woke up, he saw that the light columns below the sacred cup were all lit up.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King saw Zen's sincere eyes and felt a little dubious.
<br><br>
However, it was meaningless to dwell on it now.
<br><br>
"This is incredible!"
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King raised his hands in the air. "How should I repay you for waking me up?"
<br><br>
In this world, returning a favor was a high honor.
<br><br>
Even if Manuel and the others didn't point it out, the Monkey Spirit King could tell that Zen had intentions to be fulfilled.
<br><br>
"Well..."
<br><br>
Zen shrugged his shoulders and turned towards the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "It was actually the Primeval Lord of Heaven who helped you wake up, so..."
<br><br>
"But I am asking you." The Monkey Spirit King didn't let him finish.
<br><br>
Because the Primeval Lord of Heaven was the leader of the human heroes, Zen naturally asked him for opinions.
<br><br>
Now that Zen had to make his own decision, he grew uneasy.
<br><br>
After a few deep breaths, he collected himself and continued to speak.
<br><br>
"I want a way to protect the chaos so that it won't come to an end and so the Finale Way can be achieved," Zen requested.
<br><br>
He figured it was a good opportunity to get ahead on his plans.
<br><br>
From the divine land to the Source World, Zen was always on the move.
<br><br>
The closer he got to the truth, the more lost he became.
<br><br>
In the beginning, he was not at all interested in the internal strife of the Four Spirits Sect or the previous human civilization.
<br><br>
However, what unfolded felt like a rope that dragged him to the Other Shore, the Three Purities Stage, and the Night View Island inch by inch.
<br><br>
"The Finale Way? Is that to prevent the chaos from disorder?" the Monkey Spirit King asked with concern.
<br><br>
Zen nodded.
<br><br>
"Well, it's not a difficult thing you ask for," the Monkey Spirit King said.
<br><br>
This was too easy for him.
<br><br>
After all, the Four Spirits Sect built many worlds which served just as their energy pools.
<br><br>
The Finale Way that Zen mentioned was a method to stop the operation of a pool.
<br><br>
When some creatures from the secondary worlds had the ancestry-level bloodline and obtained positions in the Four Spirits Sect, they occasionally asked to halt the energy pools they came from.
<br><br>
This way, the worlds within the energy pools never experienced chaos or destruction again. However, this also meant they would not produce any new energy.
<br><br>
"It may not seem difficult to you, but the Snake Spirit Sect is on the opposite side of us," said Zen.
<br><br>
Back then, to prevent the completion of the Finale Way, the Element Spirit Civilization had to hide some Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
This was done without the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Now, with the intervention of the Snake Spirit Sect, the chaos might not be as simple as it once was.
<br><br>
Completing the Finale Way could be unimaginably difficult.
<br><br>
"Would you want me to help you deal with the Snake Spirit Sect?" the Monkey Spirit King asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, actually." Zen nodded again.
<br><br>
Just then, the Monkey Spirit King zoned out and got lost in thought.
<br><br>
He reminisced about his past. It was because of the Snake Spirit King that he ended up this way.
<br><br>
Within the long years he spent in the dream, he imagined chopping Cornelius up into pieces.
<br><br>
Since then, he swore to himself that Cornelius would pay for what he had done.
<br><br>
"Count me in." The Monkey Spirit King smiled.
<br><br>
When Zen heard this, his nerves finally relaxed. He was no longer jittery.
<br><br>
Since they'd entered the Three Purities Stage, they had been running away nonstop.
<br><br>
Now, they finally found the human heroes on the Night View Island.
<br><br>
However, they didn't expect that the Snake Spirit Sect was behind the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Monkey Spirit King was on their side. Otherwise, they would never have exited the Night View Island.
<br><br>
"Thank you so much!" Zen said and bowed before the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King smiled faintly. "Follow me."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and motioned for Zen to stand on his palm.
<br><br>
Once Zen stood securely, he flew towards the Ghost Mountain.
<br><br>
As they approached, Zen could easily see that the Ghost Mountain was still under repair.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King had created a huge, gaping crack in the center of the mountain, one that would be difficult to repair in a short time.
<br><br>
"I agree to this because we have the same goal," the Monkey Spirit King explained. "The Snake Spirit Sect is my enemy."
<br><br>
"Is this because the Snake Masters want to take away your body?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"No." The Monkey Spirit King shook his head and pointed towards the Ghost Mountain. "Do you know why so many Treacherous Beings exist in the Ghost Mountain?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded, having already discussed this with the others. "They were not actually Treacherous Beings, but living creatures from the main world,"
<br><br>
he noted.
<br><br>
"Right. Back then, I stored creatures in the Ghost Mountain so that the myriad creatures of the main world had chances to survive."
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King paused and sighed before continuing, "But Cornelius was just too scheming. Because of him, I have lost my physical body, and so have the monkey spirits. It came to a point that even the creatures in the Ghost Mountain have become Treacherous Beings themselves."
<br><br>
Chapter 4098 Replenish (Part One) Upon hearing what the Monkey Spirit King said, Zen became a bit confused.
<br><br>
He furrowed his brows in confusion. "I thought the Four Spirits Sect was invincible in the main world. If it were, why did you hide in the chaos?"
<br><br>
According to the Monkey Spirit King's words, Zen suspected that there might have been some sort of crisis in the main world.
<br><br>
Before the said crisis came, the Monkey Spirit King realized he and his subordinates couldn't survive it. This left him with no choice. He had to retreat with the Monkey Spirit Sect into another world until it was safe for them to come back.
<br><br>
They did all they could before they went into hiding. One of the projects they did before leaving was the Ghost Mountain, which they built to thrust out all sorts of creatures from the main world.
<br><br>
But who or what was threatening enough to cause the Four Spirits Sect to act in this manner? Who or what held that much power? The Monkey Spirit King let out a loud huff, almost as if he did not want to answer Zen's question. "A disaster," he said, deciding to reveal the truth.
<br><br>
"A great disaster happened."
<br><br>
"What disaster?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Under his breath, the Monkey Spirit King replied to him with something in Sanskrit, his voice fluctuating in a rhythmic pattern.
<br><br>
"It is..." the Monkey Spirit King paused, trying to find the accurate words to fit his description. "It is a type of calamity. At least that is how we refer to it in the main world. I do not know how to explain what it is in your language," he admitted.
<br><br>
"Hmm," Zen said, lowering his head in careful thought. For a short while, he seemed to be meditating, and then he slowly raised his head to address the Monkey Spirit King. "The Sanskrit words you said mean the Space and Time Calamity, right? A calamity that crosses space and time?'' he said.
<br><br>
When the Monkey Spirit King heard this, he snapped his head towards Zen's direction, looking at him with a confused yet curious expression.
<br><br>
In his position as a leader of the Four Spirits Sect, he had had several odd encounters. Because of this, it was very difficult to surprise him, but Zen managed to do so twice in a row.
<br><br>
Without the aid of the Four Spirits Sect, he knew people from the secondary worlds like Zen were not literate in Sanskrit, but somehow, he was able to understand him.
<br><br>
"Young man," the Monkey Spirit King said, "you are a creature from the chaos, aren't you?" Zen nodded his head in response. "How then are you able to understand Sanskrit?" The Monkey Spirit King followed up.
<br><br>
"Well, '' Zen replied, ''for starters, I do not understand Sanskrit, at least not with my own abilities. It is being translated to me in the language I speak.'' Shortly after he said this, he bowed his head again, meditating. He called onto the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, kindly requesting it to decipher the rest of the Monkey Spirit King's words.
<br><br>
This piqued the curiosity of the Monkey Spirit King. "How exactly is it being translated to you?" he asked, interest evident in his tone.
<br><br>
Zen smiled softly. "Well," he began.
<br><br>
He did not expect the Monkey Spirit King to ask about his mental translation process, what more be interested in it.
<br><br>
Despite this, he began to explain to the Monkey Spirit King how it worked, going into as much detail as possible to avoid any cause of confusion.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished, the Monkey Spirit King flashed him a big grin.
<br><br>
For the first time, he found out that the secondary world had its share of intelligence, and that it had its method of calculation and translation. He made a mental note that if he had an opportunity, he would go to the chaos to experience it for himself.
<br><br>
Putting these thoughts aside, the Monkey Spirit King readied himself to discuss the subject in depth. He took a large breath then began to speak, "Although citizens from this secondary world refer to it as the Space and Time Calamity, this 'Space and Time' is far different from the one you are acquainted with. Space and time in the secondary world are completely different from the ones in the main world. Those who do not inhabit the latter are unable to fully grasp its scope; therefore, they are unable to understand the severity of the disaster. This is why I brought the Monkey Spirit Sect to Ghost Mountain. We needed to avoid the damage it was to bring."
<br><br>
Zen stayed silent, egging the Monkey Spirit King to go on.
<br><br>
Even though this was all happening within the Monkey Spirit Sect, he knew human spirits were also involved, which meant he had to pay attention very closely.
<br><br>
Adding to this was the fact he, out of everyone, had obtained the ancestrylevel bloodline. To him, this meant that he was important in the grand scheme of it all, and that not only the chaos was involved.
<br><br>
He continued to listen attentively.
<br><br>
"The Space and Time Calamity has been wreaking its havoc upon the main world for a long time," the Monkey Spirit King said. He turned his eyes upon the "starry sky" and continued, "The space and time in the chaos are linear—from near to distant, from past to future. But in the main world, they are completely different..."
<br><br>
Zen knew what the Monkey Spirit King was talking about.
<br><br>
He experienced the complexity of space and time himself when he entered the Abstruse Energy World for the first time.
<br><br>
Similar to what the Monkey Spirit King mentioned, he was not able to determine how far he had been pacing or how long he had been staying within its domains.
<br><br>
Space and time in the Abstruse Energy World were far different from the ones he had familiarized himself with.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King went on, "Most of the time, the sequence of space and time in the main world follows a rule; however, now and then, glitches will happen, eventually leading to disasters." He paused, trying to compose himself. "Those disasters are very strong, strong enough to devour anything that crosses their paths. Unfortunately, many members of the Four Spirits Sect were devoured. But the coverage of the disasters is actually very small."
<br><br>
Chapter 4099 Replenish (Part Two) In the past, however, a particular Space and Time Calamity affected a large area, instilling a great deal of panic within the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
When the Snake Spirit King Cornelius heard of this, he made a judgment.
<br><br>
He claimed the Space and Time Calamity would hover over the main world like a dark plague, annihilating those who inhabited it. This caused the Four Spirits Sect to worry even more.
<br><br>
He also claimed the only way to avoid the destruction was to find solace in the secondary worlds.
<br><br>
He explained this by mentioning the difference of space and time between the two kinds of worlds. He said that since space and time of the secondary worlds were different from the main world's, then they would be safe from the latter's disaster.
<br><br>
However, as the Monkey Spirit King was telling this story, he began to feel his blood beginning to boil.
<br><br>
"That particular Space and Time Calamity," Zen said, ''did it ever happen?'' Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King simply laughed. He laughed not in a way that showed amusement but in a way that warned rage was coming. "No," he said, shaking his head. "It didn't. That was how I knew it was all orchestrated by Cornelius. That vicious snake set up a trap in the chaos to destroy the Monkey Spirit Sect!" the Monkey Spirit King growled, his eyes fuming with anger.
<br><br>
During the years he was trapped within his dream, he felt his hatred for Cornelius grow more fervent as the days went on.
<br><br>
He couldn't deny the fact that the four sects couldn't stand each other.
<br><br>
They couldn't get along, but they still managed to respect each other enough as not to cause any major tensions.
<br><br>
If there were any sects that bonded well together, it would be the Snake Spirit Sect and the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
At first, the Monkey Spirit King did not doubt that Cornelius had the intention to annihilate his sect.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit Sect made its first move after the Monkey Spirit Sect brought the Ghost Mountain into the chaos.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King did all that he could to fight off the attacks, but he could not defeat the treacherous Cornelius, who ended up biting him into a death-like slumber.
<br><br>
Even the Monkey Spirit King's nobility was no match for the Snake Spirit King's poison.
<br><br>
As the poison entrapped him within his dream, the rest of the monkey spirits were led to death too, having no time to resist.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King did not wake up as a Treacherous Being until now.
<br><br>
''The sad thing is, I still have no idea what Cornelius' motive for doing all this is," the Monkey Spirit King admitted, bitterness evident in his voice.
<br><br>
Before the attacks happened, the Monkey Spirit Sect used to be the most powerful sect in the Four Spirits Sect in terms of brute strength.
<br><br>
However, they were wiped off the face of their world without even knowing why. It was a truth they found hard to face.
<br><br>
''Do you know what happened to the other three sects?'' Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King shook his head. ''No, I do not, but as I reckon it, it did not end well for the Bird Spirit King, not even the Human Spirit King.'' Within the Four Spirits Sect, it was the Monkey Spirit Sect to be attacked first, and among the four kings, it was the Monkey Spirit King who first bit the dust.
<br><br>
Because of this, he had no idea what happened to the main world and the chaos. This left him plenty of room to suspect.
<br><br>
After answering Zen's question, he raised his finger to point at the surface of the Ghost Mountain, tapping on it ever so slightly. By the touch of his skin, a huge door emerged from the mountain. He then stepped inside the door with Zen still on his palm.
<br><br>
The upper half of the Ghost Mountain was reserved for the Monkey Spirit King, which was the space large enough to accommodate someone of his stature.
<br><br>
After entering the mountain, the Monkey Spirit King gently placed Zen on the ground. He then took off the Thirteen Teeth Necklace from his broad neck.
<br><br>
With a slight wave of his hand, the necklace began to tremble. After a few seconds, thirteen bloodline powers from the necklace began to release their auras.
<br><br>
''Look here, '' the Monkey Spirit King said, calling Zen's attention. ''These thirteen bloodline powers all came from the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
However, there are still nine wolf teeth which need revitalizing. Now, you have the ancestry-level bloodline with you. Tell me, can you replenish the nine wolf teeth?'' As soon as he said this, the Monkey Spirit King tapped the ground with his hand, as if he were asking it to do something.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the ground answered, caving in to reveal the nine wolf teeth.
<br><br>
This set of teeth could easily be paralleled to those on the necklace, but unlike the latter, these teeth had nothing inside of them.
<br><br>
Not everything could bear the power of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
These nine wolf teeth once belonged to the most powerful wolf king in the main world.
<br><br>
The wolf king was more than capable of fighting against all the leaders of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
After the Monkey Spirit King had defeated the wolf king, he pulled out his teeth—all twenty-two of them. With the ancestry-level bloodline, he was able to obtain thirteen bloodline powers.
<br><br>
He had brought Zen into the Ghost Mountain because he hoped that Zen would be able to help him obtain new blended bloodlines from the ancestry-level bloodline and injecting them into the nine wolf teeth.
