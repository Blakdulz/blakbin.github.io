Chapter 3700 Forging Bodies The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others regarded Ziya as a junior.
<br><br>
The ancient human civilization had miserably ended because they failed to complete the Finale Way. It was so tragic that even when the human ancestor sacrificed himself, it still didn't stop the disaster.
<br><br>
At that time, Ziya had a great reputation among the human race, but he wasn't the central figure in the battle of the Finale Way.
<br><br>
In other words, no one in the chaos had noticed him.
<br><br>
Who would've thought that he would be banished to the Land of Ashes, also known as the Deleting Space? Then, over a thousand chaotic eras had passed, and he met his master, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, again. Of course, he was quite excited.
<br><br>
"Ziya..."
<br><br>
It was safe to say that a being like the Primeval Lord of Heaven had seen through the vanity of life. He, however, was enthusiastic to see his beloved disciple.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen pursed his lips.
<br><br>
He didn't expect King Manard to be the disciple of the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "How did you get exiled to the Land of Ashes?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
Ziya was lost in thought. It was a long time ago, so he found it hard to recall the details of the past. After a while, he began to tell the Primeval Lord of Heaven about how he got exiled and what had happened in this space.
<br><br>
Zen listened quietly and he found that he had heard about some of those things before, but this time, Ziya had everything spelled out.
<br><br>
Although Ziya was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's disciple, he wasn't weak compared to the Eternal Warriors such as the Snake Goddess and Houyi. In fact, he had led many powerful warriors to step into the Eternal Realm and become the Eternal Warriors during the 77th chaos.
<br><br>
Among the twelve disciples of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Ziya was the most important.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven let out a long sigh after Ziya had explained what happened in the past, including the events in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
"Back then, we had absorbed the quintessence of the elders and made ten plans, but in the end, we failed. Since then, the Element Spirit race has suppressed us. I didn't expect that you still got a chance to find such a place," he said.
<br><br>
When Ziya saw his master sigh, he was confused. "What do you mean?" he asked.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven stared at him and said, "We have fought against the Element Spirit race on the Other Shore for an exit for a long time. We still haven't attained that exit, and now, it's still in their hands.
<br><br>
That is one of the reasons we are trapped in Stage Thirty-three."
<br><br>
"Exit? Master, do you mean there is an exit in Stage Thirty-three?" Ziya asked again.
<br><br>
He was also an Eternal Warrior and had been to Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
However, the human race's understanding of the Other Shore was far from thorough as it was now when he had been in Stage Thirty-three. Therefore, he didn't know that there was an exit there.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with piqued interest. "Over the years, I've had many speculations about the outside of the chaos, but I can't prove them if I don't go there in person.
<br><br>
Ziya, please take me there so I can have a look," he asked. "Sure!" Ziya readily agreed.
<br><br>
He got up, but he seemed to have remembered something. He turned to Zen and said, "Please come with me. I want to help my master and the elders forge their bodies!"
<br><br>
He waved his hand as he spoke, and instantly transported both of them to another place.
<br><br>
Since he could control the time and space in the Deleting Space, he was the one who had the final say.
<br><br>
They walked through some winding paths for a while, and then Zen saw a small mountain that was several hundred feet high in front of him. This mountain seemed to be a part of the ruins.
<br><br>
Its surface was wet and sticky like watery soil. "King... What's this, Master Ziya?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Ziya smiled and said, "This is the Nirvana Clay."
<br><br>
Zen simply blinked as he didn't know what the Nirvana Clay was.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others looked at it curiously. "As far as I know, there shouldn't be such a thing in the Source World, right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and the others believed that everything in the Deleting Space was deleted from the Source World. However, the Nirvana Clay was a kind of Other Shore Token that could help the Other Shore creatures rebuild their bodies. Thus, it shouldn't be in this place.
<br><br>
"It doesn't come from the Source World or the Other Shore. I brought it back from the Abstruse Energy World," Ziya said with a smile.
<br><br>
"You can bring things back from the Abstruse Energy World?" the Snake Goddess asked in shock. As for the Primeval Lord of Heaven, he knew that there was another world outside the chaos, but he had never seen that world.
<br><br>
But since Ziya had named that world the Abstruse Energy World, then they also used that name.
<br><br>
"I was lucky. I can forge your bodies with the Nirvana Clay, but the new bodies can only live in the Deleting Space," Ziya stated.
<br><br>
After he spoke, he stretched out his hand towards the small mountain of Nirvana Clay and gently scratched it. Soft clay fell off the mountain wall, turned into human shapes and slowly walked down the slope.
<br><br>
As the human-shaped clay walked down, their faces, hair, and features slowly formed.
<br><br>
At the same time, Ziya activated the Truth of Three-Energy Construction to make clothes for them.
<br><br>
Because the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were in Zen's body, their energy souls had appeared as the Other Shore Tokens. Thus, their energy souls could leave as long as Zen allowed.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The energy souls all drilled into the bodies made of the Nirvana Clay.
<br><br>
Naturally, Ziya was ecstatic when he saw the former masters, elders, and powerhouses have reappeared in front of him.
<br><br>
It was just like he had returned to the 77th chaos, the world of starry regions humans had dominated.
<br><br>
Once the heroes had adapted to their new bodies, he led them to the cave.
<br><br>
It was hard to dig this cave, and the cave itself was quite small, so everyone entered one by one.
<br><br>
Ziya, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess walked in the front. Zen had been in there once, so he was the last one to enter.
<br><br>
While Zen waited for his turn, he heard the Regal Jade Spirit's voice from his inner world that said, "Zen, Geoffrey wants to see the Abstruse Energy World. Can you let him go there to have a look?"
<br><br>
"Geoffrey?" he asked in disbelief. Needless to say, he was stunned.
<br><br>
After he entrusted Geoffrey to the Regal Jade Spirit, he didn't care much about him anymore.
<br><br>
Now that the Oneness Sky Palace was under attack and in chaos, he didn't plan to release Geoffrey from his inner world.
<br><br>
Still, it was a good choice to settle him in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Most importantly, Ziya had mentioned that anyone who had a powerful ability to decipher Sanskrit words would adapt much easier to the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Geoffrey could decipher almost all Sanskrit words in a second, so Zen wondered if he could quickly adapt to the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"Sure. Tell him that I'll let him out after the human elders return," Zen told the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
Chapter 3701 Go Further At that moment, King Manard pulled back the ropes that were tied to the side of the cave one by one, then tied up the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and some others with these ropes.
<br><br>
Once everything was in place, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others went straight towards the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
As soon as they arrived at the Abstruse Energy World, they turned into many light dots and scattered around. Their bodies and their energy souls stepped into the Abstruse Energy State.
<br><br>
Since these human heroes lived as long as Ziya Jiang, they shared the same amount of knowledge as him.
<br><br>
Right now, however, they were as excited as children as they ran around and kept rubbing their hands.
<br><br>
"Monkey, can you move out of my way and let me have a look first?"
<br><br>
Houyi, who stood a little behind, asked. The monkey with a furry face turned his head and gave Houyi a ferocious stare.
<br><br>
In turn, Houyi immediately fell silent and didn't press any further.
<br><br>
The monkey was one of the strongest among the thirty-nine human heroes and his strength was on par with Fuxi's. Though Houyi had a way to restrain Emperor Charm's skill, he was relatively weak in terms of overall strength. After all, the monkey had taught him a hard lesson before.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others wandered around the Abstruse Energy World for a long time before they reluctantly left.
<br><br>
"The information in the Abstruse Energy World is difficult to decipher," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with an unreadable expression after their trip to the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"I saw a mountain," said the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
It was known that the Snake Goddess understood Sanskrit words better than the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's strength was his analysis and deduction of many things.
<br><br>
He wasn't good at deciphering Sanskrit words. "Why didn't I see it?" asked Fuxi.
<br><br>
"I didn't see it either…" Emperor Charm agreed as he shook his head. Only the Snake Goddess could see the mountain among the first group of warriors who entered the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"You are brilliant, Snake Goddess," Ziya Jiang praised.
<br><br>
"Although there is no concept of distance in the Abstruse Energy World, the mountain is the easiest to find. I didn't recognize the mountain from the starlight until many years later. I also got the Nirvana Clay from there. I didn't expect that you'd see the mountain the first time you entered!" he enthused.
<br><br>
"I just saw the shadow of the mountain," the Snake Goddess said with a smile.
<br><br>
"That's also very rare," Ziya Jiang commented.
<br><br>
At that point, the Primeval Lord of Heaven untied the rope around his body and gave it to the person behind him.
<br><br>
Then, they entered and came out one after another. It turned out that the Abstruse Energy World was just a small test for them.
<br><br>
Those who were good at deciphering Sanskrit words could adapt much faster in the Abstruse Energy World. After all, they could also accurately describe what they saw and felt.
<br><br>
On the contrary, those who found it difficult to understand Sanskrit words couldn't adapt to the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
For instance, Houyi returned from the Abstruse Energy World in a daze, completely unaware of the situation. It took him a long time to recover from his muddled mind.
<br><br>
Ziya Jiang was a little disappointed at their performance.
<br><br>
Back then, these heroes were either on the same level as him or on a higher level when it came to cultivation and talent.
<br><br>
He had been in the Abstruse Energy World for countless years, but he still couldn't find anything meaningful. In the end, he just dived into that mountain and dug out some mud.
<br><br>
He believed if any of them could see through the rules of the Abstruse Energy World, they might be even able to unravel the Abstruse Energy World's secrets! However, even the most talented Snake Goddess could only see the shadow of the mountain. That was still far from Ziya Jiang's expectations.
<br><br>
When the last group entered the world, Zen stepped forward and said, "Master Ziya, there is another person who wants to enter the Abstruse Energy World."
<br><br>
Ziya Jiang was very grateful to Zen for bringing his master in person with him. Thus, he kindly asked, "Who do you want to send to the Abstruse Energy World?"
<br><br>
"It is my son," Zen answered.
<br><br>
A smile graced Ziya's face. "No problem. You are free to show him something new. Please, go ahead!" he said.
<br><br>
Zen's son, Geoffrey, was already prepared as he waited in his father's inner world.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit already had an idea after he had seen the Abstruse Energy World last time. He and No. 9527 both agreed that Geoffrey was very suitable to enter the Abstruse Energy World because he could decipher Sanskrit words very quickly.
<br><br>
If only Zen hadn't been very busy after he had returned from the Chaotic Source World last time, the Regal Jade Spirit would have urged him to go to the Deleting Space again.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Geoffrey also became interested in the Abstruse Energy World when the Regal Jade Spirit had described it to him.
<br><br>
Geoffrey felt a strong gravitational force on him. His body spun, and then he landed in the small cave.
<br><br>
"Father, Grandpa Primeval, Brother Monkey..."
<br><br>
The moment he came out, he greeted all the human heroes one by one.
<br><br>
"What are you calling them?" Zen asked with a frown. It was not a big deal to call the Primeval Lord of Heaven as grandpa, but he even called Wukong Sun as brother.
<br><br>
That was unreasonable and disrespectful! "What's wrong? That is what I call them in your inner world," Geoffrey said and shrugged.
<br><br>
After this group of "outsiders" came to his father's inner world, he became quite familiar with them. He could even talk a little to Wukong Sun, who was known for being unapproachable.
<br><br>
"We have lived for so many years. Seniority means nothing for us," the Snake Goddess said with a faint smile.
<br><br>
"That's right. Ordinary mortals can't live for more than a hundred years, so they pay attention to such things..." Geoffrey scowled.
<br><br>
"Should I call you dad then?" asked Zen. In return, Geoffrey only pursed his lips as he didn't know how to respond.
<br><br>
Then, he shifted his attention to the outside of the cave.
<br><br>
"Is this the Abstruse Energy World my master has told me about? It's interesting!" he exclaimed. His gaze travelled to the floating light dots.
<br><br>
Just then, Ziya handed the rope to Geoffrey and said, "This world is very wonderful. You'll know when you get in."
<br><br>
Geoffrey took the rope and after he had tied it to him, he jumped out of the cave.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
He had turned into many light dots and quickly scattered into the distance.
<br><br>
Those who entered the Abstruse Energy World for the first time couldn't locate themselves at all.
<br><br>
They didn't know where they were but lost all senses of distance, direction, time, and vision. Everything had changed, and they also couldn't find the cave where they could return to the chaos. Thus, they needed to tie ropes around their bodies.
<br><br>
"Those light dots..."
<br><br>
For Zen, those numerous light dots were meaningless.
<br><br>
However, Geoffrey had already understood what they meant in a single glance.
<br><br>
"These light dots are a mountain..."
<br><br>
"It's really interesting. I can land on this mountain!"
<br><br>
The mountain itself was also made up of light dots, and the Snake Goddess also saw it clearly the first time she arrived. It was already quite an impressive talent to have, but Geoffrey went further and stood straight on the mountain.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey had landed, he looked around again.
<br><br>
It seemed that the light dots had a special meaning to each other.
<br><br>
Some light dots clumped together and formed a large rock, while some turned into a swamp. Ziya Jiang had dug out the Nirvana Clay from the swamp before.
<br><br>
Still, Geoffrey wasn't interested in those things. He wanted to go further.
<br><br>
Chapter 3702 Ball The dots of light that Geoffrey had turned into shuttled through a seemingly chaotic mass of light dots he found himself surrounded by.
<br><br>
From one point of view, it seemed as though it was not Geoffrey that moved, but the mountain formed by the light dots moved.
<br><br>
But in the Abstruse Energy World, perception and depth were not as ordinary people understood them. In this world, it was actually Geoffrey who was moving.
<br><br>
He soon left the mountain.
<br><br>
As he continued moving through, the light dots circled him like water, forming a sort of river as he saw it.
<br><br>
It flowed past his body and circles of light dots then appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
They now seemed very orderly, as if carefully arranged.
<br><br>
He observed this phenomenon for a while and frowned, the dots of light representing his eyebrows drawing closer together.
<br><br>
These arranged light dots looked like some sort of three-dimensional plain.
<br><br>
He could understand it, and yet he could not describe it because he had never seen or heard of anything like it and thus had nothing to compare it to. This place was not the chaos after all.
<br><br>
This plain attracted something deep inside him. He couldn't help but walk towards it, like a moth to a flame.
<br><br>
After only a few steps, he felt the rope he was tied to became taut.
<br><br>
He shook his body slightly and the rope was untied.
<br><br>
At the entrance to the cave, the rope began to shake and the runes on the surface began to flicker.
<br><br>
Ziya saw the change in the runes and his expression shifted in turn.
<br><br>
Zen had worried about sending Geoffrey into the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He saw the expression on Ziya's face and immediately asked, "What's wrong?"
<br><br>
"The other end of the rope has loosened!" said Ziya in a slight panic.
<br><br>
"How could this be?" asked Zen.
<br><br>
"There are only two possibilities. The first is that Geoffrey was attacked by something on the other side," Ziya revealed seriously.
<br><br>
"Something on the other side?" Zen asked as his heart sank.
<br><br>
Nobody knew what was in the Abstruse Energy World...
<br><br>
It was simply incomprehensible. If monsters of some sort did exist there, what they were and how they behaved and attacked were still left only to the imagination.
<br><br>
"Yes," said Ziya. "My disciples were attacked when travelling through the mountain. They never returned..."
<br><br>
Ziya was unsure of their condition but he felt it safe to assume they had died.
<br><br>
"What is the other possibility?" Zen asked hoping for good news.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey untied the rope himself," replied Ziya. "But the possibility of that is very low. Those who enter the Abstruse Energy World have no sense of direction, nor can they distinguish their shapes. It would be impossible to untie the rope."
<br><br>
Ziya's meaning was quite clear. It was highly probable that something had gone wrong for Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Zen's face darkened. He had thought that the Abstruse Energy World was safe and that something like this could not happen.
<br><br>
"It could just be an accident. I'll go and have a look!"
<br><br>
After tying a rope to himself, Ziya jumped up and turned into many dots of light that then spread out.
<br><br>
Among them, Ziya knew the Abstruse Energy World the best and was the only one who could save Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The creatures in the Source World had little understanding of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Even though Ziya had been immersed in this world and researched and figured out many of its rules, he was still easily lost.
<br><br>
He barely entered the mountain and was already at his limit. He hoped Geoffrey just accidentally fell into the mountain, and he was confident he could then bring him back.
<br><br>
As Ziya was searching hard, Geoffrey slowly entered the plain.
<br><br>
At first Geoffrey needed to decipher the light dots he saw, just like deciphering Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
The first thing he saw was the golden Sanskrit word, and the second was the hidden information within the Sanskrit word.
<br><br>
But as he went deeper and deeper in the Abstruse Energy World, the light dots also began changing in his eyes. Each dot had its own meaning and in combination they revealed a great substance.
<br><br>
He could see a piece of lush green grassland with undulating mountains and in the center were a whole bunch of light dots.
<br><br>
As for the substance formed by the light dots, Geoffrey failed to understand it. It could have been that there was no corresponding substance in the chaos.
<br><br>
There were also stairs formed by light dots. In the center of a whole lot of them, some light dots had gathered together to create a small ball.
<br><br>
He was unable to tell what the 'ball' was, but in his subconscious he knew this was what had attracted him here.
<br><br>
His heart skipped a beat. He walked up the stairs and reached out to grab the ball of light dots.
<br><br>
Ziya had cultivated for countless chaotic eras to learn how to retrieve things from the Abstruse Energy World, and he could still only barely do it.
<br><br>
But for Geoffrey, it was a piece of cake.
<br><br>
He didn't need to adapt or practice, it was as if he was born here.
<br><br>
He grabbed the ball and looked out into the distance.
<br><br>
Farther away, there were still light dots scattered chaotically.
<br><br>
They moved at such speed that even Geoffrey was unable to distinguish them.
<br><br>
But as he continued staring into the distance, he saw an eye emerge from the light dots, staring right back at him.
<br><br>
He was not the kind of person who was totally fearless. This eye sent a pang of angst through him.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, he grabbed the ball and ran back in the direction he had come, countless light dots dancing and intersecting as he did.
<br><br>
He soon found the rope at the edge of the grassland and moved quickly along it, crossing the river and the mountains.
<br><br>
Ziya searched a long while, but could still not find Geoffrey.
<br><br>
He had no choice but to return to the cave.
<br><br>
"Have you found my son?" Zen asked with concern when Ziya returned.
<br><br>
He would never be able to forgive himself if something bad happened to Geoffrey. Besides, he wouldn't know how to face Letitia.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately..."
<br><br>
Ziya sighed. He was about to speak when he caught a glimpse of the rope beside him. His eyes widened in disbelief as he said, "How is this possible? The rope seems to have recovered to the normal state again."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen asked anxiously.
<br><br>
"Your son is still on the other end of the rope. That's impossible. Did he break free from the rope and tie himself back again?"
<br><br>
Ziya was at a loss for words when many dots of light began gathering at the entrance of the cave.
<br><br>
And the next moment, Geoffrey appeared in the cave.
<br><br>
"Ah! It's so hot!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey entered, still holding the ball in his hand. He felt a scorching pain and instinctively reacted and threw the ball on the ground.
<br><br>
Chapter 3703 The Heart of Limit "Click, click, click..." They were rooted to the spot as they heard a strange sound echoing inside the narrow cave.
<br><br>
Soon after, they saw a ball rolling in circles on the ground. Finally, it stopped when it touched the wall of the cave.
<br><br>
The ball's surface was covered all over with bronze hollow patterns. There was a red dot of light inside. Somehow, it looked like it was beating.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop! They heard a curious sound coming from it.
<br><br>
It seemed as though the light dot was beating like an actual heart. It contracted and relaxed with each heartbeat.
<br><br>
Ziya was absolutely stunned when he saw Geoffrey return all by himself.
<br><br>
As his eyes settled upon the ball on the ground, his expression seemed blank.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the expressions of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others changed drastically. They were standing on the other side of the cave and were utterly bewildered when they saw the ball.
<br><br>
"I-is that the Heart of Limit?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked tentatively.
<br><br>
"No, it can't be that Heart of Limit!" The Snake Goddess couldn't believe it either.
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit race has already destroyed that one, remember? Where does it come from?" The other beings whispered among each other.
<br><br>
They couldn't quite contain their excitement and it showed in their curious faces.
<br><br>
The Heart of Limit was an Other Shore Token. It was well-known that the human race possessed this artifact before.
<br><br>
Long ago, the human ancestor bore the Heart of Limit. Afterwards, he used it as his own heart.
<br><br>
During that time, the most powerful Other Shore Tokens had been in the possession of the human race. It could even be said that the human race itself was the strongest weapon that existed in the chaos.
<br><br>
Even though the human race had failed to complete the Finale Way, they were actually very close to attaining success.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the tremendous efforts of the human race had attracted the unwanted attention of the Element Spirit race. Later, both the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone were destroyed.
<br><br>
Judging from the reaction of the Element Spirit race, the Primeval Lord of Heaven deduced that the human race had made the right choice, but something was missing. Unfortunately, they didn't find new substitutes after the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone were destroyed.
<br><br>
This meant that the once perfect plan of the human race could no longer be fulfilled. No one would be able to complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
But to everyone's surprise, Geoffrey had successfully brought back a Heart of Limit from outside the chaos! Clearly, they weren't expecting to see it once again.
<br><br>
Even Zen expressed his concern as he gazed at the ball. He was completely taken aback by this turn of event as well.
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable being stared at by these powerful warriors. He could feel their truly overwhelming and terrifying auras around him. He felt a bit scared so he stepped back cautiously. Then, he asked, "Why are you all staring at me like this?"
<br><br>
As he said this, the powerful warriors regained their senses. The Primeval Lord of Heaven squeezed through the narrow cave and picked up the Heart of Limit. With a serious look, he turned to Geoffrey and asked, "Where did you get this Heart of Limit?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey pursed his lips. "Well, I just went to the star, oh wait, I mean the Abstruse Energy World. Then, I just picked it up there," he answered nonchalantly.
<br><br>
"Wait, what? You are able to pick up the things there?" Ziya asked him sharply. He turned to Geoffrey with such a piercing look.
<br><br>
Geoffrey looked at Ziya confusedly. "Uh, yes. It's fairly easy for me," he replied.
<br><br>
"Did you untie the rope by yourself?" Ziya asked, getting more and more bewildered.
<br><br>
"Yes," Geoffrey answered simply and shrugged.
<br><br>
With that, Ziya was rendered utterly speechless.
<br><br>
Being able to move freely within the Abstruse Energy World was an absolutely complicated matter for the creatures in the chaos. Therefore, what Geoffrey did was an incredible feat.
<br><br>
The moment people entered the Abstruse Energy World, it became extremely difficult for them to think straight. Thus, it was much more difficult to move freely.
<br><br>
For instance, Zen and the others were unable to distinguish space and time.
<br><br>
If it wasn't for their keen observation of the light dots, they wouldn't know.
<br><br>
They could not tell their exact position, distance, or even how long they had been staying in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Ziya instantly regarded the Snake Goddess as a highly talented being due to her ability to see the mountain from the very first time she entered the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Being able to enter the mountain, touch it, and even dig out what was inside required countless years of adaptation and repeated practice. Even Ziya himself was unable to do this smoothly and without much thought.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen's son was able to untie the rope right after he went in. He could also pick up a Heart of Limit without a hitch. Ziya felt like he was dreaming because this kind of thing seemed a little unreal. It was truly extraordinary.
<br><br>
However, he quickly calmed himself down and gathered his senses.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey, where does this Heart of Limit come from? Did you find it in the mountain?" He asked with unabated curiosity.
<br><br>
"Mountain, huh? There is nothing but a pile of mud in the place of that socalled mountain," Geoffrey said with obvious disdain.
<br><br>
"What…"
<br><br>
Ziya was rendered speechless once more. It took a while before he continued, "Well, did you cross that mountain?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I did. And there seems to be a river behind it..."
<br><br>
Ziya, who had already calmed down, interjected loudly once again before Geoffrey could even finish his sentence, "River? You saw a river?" This whole thing sounded really incredulous to Ziya.
<br><br>
"I did," Geoffrey answered affirmatively.
<br><br>
Ziya took a deep breath and ran his hand through his forehead.
<br><br>
Indeed, there were many light dots flowing behind the mountain. Ziya had even made several assumptions about what those light dots were and made a plan to cross them.
<br><br>
However, the speed at which the light dots changed was too fast for him. He could neither decipher them nor cross them at all! What he didn't expect was that it was actually a flowing river! It had been extremely difficult for Ziya to decipher the light dots. On the other hand, Geoffrey was immediately knew what they were with just a single glance. He was certainly remarkable.
<br><br>
Seeing that everyone was still staring at him, Geoffrey explained everything to them at one go, "After crossing the river, I realized that the rope was too short. So I untied it and found this on a platform in the depths of the grassland."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he gestured at the Heart of Limit.
<br><br>
He actually didn't know what the Heart of Limit was used for. Nonetheless, he still brought it back by himself.
<br><br>
If they wanted to take it, he would agree. As long as they gave him some good things in exchange for it, he had no problem giving it away.
<br><br>
Ziya had no idea what Geoffrey was thinking. He just smiled at Zen and said, "I didn't expect that you have such a highly talented son. This is astonishing."
<br><br>
Zen had anchored his great hope upon his son. After all, he knew that Geoffrey was highly talented in deciphering Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, he hadn't anticipated that Geoffrey would be this outstanding.
<br><br>
It was his first time to enter the Abstruse Energy World. And already, he was able to bring back a Heart of Limit! It was from Ziya that Zen heard about the origin of the Heart of Limit before. It was a very important Other Shore Token even in Stage Thirtythree.
<br><br>
"Well, my son seems to..."
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to praise Geoffrey, a dense stream of radiant starlight suddenly surged towards them from the Abstruse Energy World outside the cave.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! With so much starlight pouring in, it meant that something was hurtling towards the cave.
<br><br>
As Ziya saw the stream of dazzling starlight, his expression suddenly changed.
<br><br>
As it poured in from the Abstruse Energy World, it immediately turned into grayish brown tentacles and directly swept towards the people inside the cave.
<br><br>
"Let's go! Now!"
<br><br>
Ziya shouted as he lifted his hand instantaneously.
<br><br>
A powerful airflow instantly exploded inside the narrow cave. The airflow pushed everyone backwards and into the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The grayish brown tentacles kept on pursuing them and sweeping the area.
<br><br>
As those tentacles broke through the cave, they rapidly expanded and extended. Then, they followed the people towards the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
Ziya stretched out his fingers and made a cut in the air.
<br><br>
There were invisible forces that intertwined constantly and pierced the space.
<br><br>
It seemed like Ziya had summoned an invisible cutter.
<br><br>
The invisible cutter continued to slice at the tentacles that were now frenziedly pouring out of the cave into pieces.
<br><br>
Chapter 3704 An Invitation The tentacles quickly transformed after being cut into pieces.
<br><br>
Each piece morphed into the shape of a five-pointed star. A crack then appeared in the center and an eye popped out of it.
<br><br>
The pieces now looked like starfish.
<br><br>
The starfish searched around for a second before locking onto the Primeval Lord of Heaven as their target. Their mission when they had entered the Deleting Space had been to retrieve the Heart of Limit that Geoffrey had taken.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! All the starfish swept towards the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Seeing them surging towards him didn't scare him in the slightest. He flew upside down, dodging and weaving, leaving mere shadows behind him.
<br><br>
Ziya's face darkened further on seeing the starfish giving chase. Once more, he extended his arm out and cut through the air.
<br><br>
Space cutters appeared one after the other behind the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The starfish passed through thousands of space cutters and were again cut into even smaller pieces.
<br><br>
The starfish that were once the size of a fist were now no more than powder.
<br><br>
But they remained tenacious and energetic, continuing to charge after the Primeval Lord of Heaven even after being turned into powder. They looked like dark brown poisonous smog as they stuck close behind him.
<br><br>
Perhaps on realizing that individually they were too small to inflict any real damage, they had evolved toxins within the tiny organisms to make up for their size.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven circled the Deleting Pillars and then passed by Zhurong and said flatly, "Burn them."
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
A scorching flame suddenly ignited, immediately burning the entire poisonous smog following behind the Primeval Lord of Heaven, leaving behind only the pungent smell of charred meat.
<br><br>
Dealing with such a dilemma as this was a simple task for the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others as they had experienced numerous battles.
<br><br>
But the appearance of these monsters in the Abstruse Energy World put them slightly on edge.
<br><br>
"Are there other creatures in the Abstruse Energy World?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"Yes." Ziya nodded.
<br><br>
He had been here for a long time, and in that time other creatures had attacked this place.
<br><br>
The first was a sort of "light" creature. It didn't have a form, but was simply a special kind of light. It did not attack Ziya and the others but reproduced endlessly as soon as they entered the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Soon the "light" creatures could be found all across the Deleting Space, and they proved difficult to get rid of by normal methods. Ziya had tried many means before finally succeeding in driving the "light" creatures away.
<br><br>
The second attack involved these tentacles.
<br><br>
This was not Ziya's first encounter with them. When he had seen the "mountain" for the first time, he sensed something special inside it. At that time, he knew little of the Abstruse Energy World, so he was unable to determine what it was.
<br><br>
And as soon as he returned to the cave, he was strangled in a tangle of these tentacles.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he had reacted quickly and gotten rid of them. If they had pulled him into the Abstruse Energy World, he might not have been able to fight them off despite his great strength.
<br><br>
After that incident, he didn't dare to enter the Abstruse Energy World for a long time.
<br><br>
He never saw the tentacles again when he finally decided to enter the "mountain" again.
<br><br>
It now seemed that those tentacles had moved to the grassland mentioned by Geoffrey, and the Heart of Limit that Geoffrey had unintentionally taken, very likely belonged to them.
<br><br>
For them, to enter the chaos rashly was a very risky move, but they took the risk to get the Heart of Limit back.
<br><br>
"The Abstruse Energy World is not lifeless. It may be difficult to comprehend, but it is very lively," Ziya deduced.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded with gratification. Among his twelve disciples, Ziya's personality was the most similar to his. He was good at deduction and planning. It seemed destined that Ziya had been deleted to this space.
<br><br>
"It seems that our hope lies in the Abstruse Energy World," declared the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"But Ziya, you explored too slowly. It has been many years and you still cannot even perform as well as a child," the Snake Goddess retorted mercilessly.
<br><br>
Geoffrey and Zen were approaching gingerly when they heard the Snake Goddess' words. "I'm not a child, Snake Goddess!" Geoffrey corrected.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess smiled faintly. She saw little difference between Zen's and Geoffrey's ages. They were both children to her.
<br><br>
"Perhaps I am simply not talented enough," Ziya sighed. He looked at Geoffrey again and his eyes flashed with hope.
<br><br>
He had been here for so many years and still was not able to even cross a river yet. In contrast, Geoffrey had done it with ease. It seemed that if Geoffrey was given time, he would be able to travel freely in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey, you're talented enough to travel freely in the Abstruse Energy World. Would you care to stay here and help us?" Ziya asked hopefully.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's eyes flickered.
<br><br>
Even if Ziya hadn't asked this of him, he would still ask his father for permission to stay.
<br><br>
He had been longing to leave his father's inner world and the first time he stepped into the Abstruse Energy World, he had felt abnormally satisfied, as if he belonged in the world.
<br><br>
It was a feeling he would never forget for as long as he lived.
<br><br>
Although he already wanted to stay here, he still could not miss this opportunity to take advantage of the situation. "Yes I would, but I have conditions."
<br><br>
"Oh? What conditions, Geoffrey?" Ziya asked smiling.
<br><br>
If Geoffrey was willing to stay, he would agree with whatever conditions he had.
<br><br>
After thinking a moment, Geoffrey said, "I want a palace of the same size, and..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey's request was not excessive or difficult to fulfill by using the resources in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
"I can grant you all you wish," Ziya said without hesitation.
<br><br>
Worry appeared on Zen's face, who had been silent the entire time until he asked, "Although he can travel freely in the Abstruse Energy World, is it not dangerous for him?"
<br><br>
The monsters in the Abstruse Energy World might even break into the Deleting Space. If Geoffrey encountered them in the Abstruse Energy World, the consequences would be unimaginable.
<br><br>
"Dad!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey's eyebrows shot up like sharp swords.
<br><br>
Leaving Zen's inner world was not easy for him, how could he be willing to return there? Seeing Geoffrey's determination reminded Zen of himself. He realized it might not be that easy to get his son to compromise. Zen sighed and said, "Your decision is fine with me, but as for your mother..."
<br><br>
"Just don't tell her. Isn't the Deleting Space very safe?" Geoffrey asked in a hurry, trying to convince his father.
<br><br>
"I'll do my best to keep him safe. He's truly very important," Ziya said enthusiastically, standing by their side.
<br><br>
Ziya still had many questions and theories about the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He even had a theory that there could be another cave just like theirs and another world too.
<br><br>
Or, was there another civilization in the Abstruse Energy World, made up of another kind of light dots? Ziya was unable to solve and perfect these questions and theories, but now he could rely on Geoffrey for help.
<br><br>
Chapter 3705 Birth Of The Evil Silence hung in the air as the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others stared at Zen and waited for his decision.
<br><br>
There were many reasons Geoffrey should stay and help Ziya, such as to help the human race and for the Finale Way.
<br><br>
However, Geoffrey was still Zen's son, and it was normal for a father to worry about his son's safety.
<br><br>
Finally, Zen came to a decision. "I will tell your mother that you are here to learn martial arts," he said.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey heard those words, excitement quickly replaced his previously upset expression.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head at the instant change in his son's attitude, but he still reminded him, "Although I allow you to enter the Abstruse Energy World, you have to know that this is not my inner world.
<br><br>
Only you can save yourself once you are in danger..."
<br><br>
It wasn't a problem for Geoffrey to turn the world upside down within his inner world, but of course, the real world was much harsher. "I know,"
<br><br>
Geoffrey said affectionately. He was touched as he felt his father's deep love for him.
<br><br>
But he was no longer young, and he had the burden of living under his father's glory before. It was time for him to march alone.
<br><br>
He had grown up listening to all the legends of Zen back when he was in the Cloud Hall. Later on, he went to the divine land and met many powerful warriors like Augustus, Joy and the others—but his father seemed to be far too stronger than them.
<br><br>
Then, he arrived at the Source World and was kept in his father's inner world for quite some time.
<br><br>
During that time, it seemed that his father only contacted him when he needed to decipher Sanskrit words. It looked like Zen forgot about him most of the time.
<br><br>
Still, he understood that his father had been very busy and hadn't stopped a bit for over a hundred years.
<br><br>
But the busier he was, the more Geoffrey wanted to prove that he was very useful! It was probably impossible to catch up with his father in terms of cultivation, but travelling in the Abstruse Energy World was his strong point.
<br><br>
Besides, these great warriors who seemed to be mightier than his father all placed great importance on the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Most importantly, he also liked the feeling of staying in the Abstruse Energy World. He wanted to continue exploring that world! A while later, Ziya invited Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the others to move within the palace.
<br><br>
He had already shown the Abstruse Energy World to everyone, but aside from that, he also needed to consult the Primeval Lord of Heaven on how to transform the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
In the last countless years, he worked hard alone in this space. Now that more people with ideas came along, he truly felt less pressured.
<br><br>
After more than half a day in the palace, they suddenly heard a violent roar that came from somewhere in the Deleting Space. At the same time, a bright blue flash of light appeared.
<br><br>
Everyone was confused when they heard the strange sound. They all turned to Ziya, as if to ask him about what happened.
<br><br>
In turn, Ziya looked to the north of the Deleting Space and said, "It started again. Recently, that Chaos Ancient God seems to be very active."
<br><br>
He gently waved his hand as he spoke.
<br><br>
The space above him turned into a mirror-like object and projected the current scene in the north.
<br><br>
In the north was a floating blob of red lava. .
<br><br>
Bubbles constantly appeared on its surface and emitted a scorching hot energy. "How could Othniel delete such a large space?" Zen asked as his eyes widened in awe.
<br><br>
"It has been like this recently," Ziya nodded. "Is there any fierce battle going on in the Source World?" he asked.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head in confusion.
<br><br>
Although the Source World was not peaceful currently, the Chaos Ancient Gods weren't involved in the battles. He didn't know why Othniel kept deleting spaces.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, something began to brew in the Dust Blood Province.
<br><br>
A bright beam of light burst out and illuminated the area.
<br><br>
Flames combusted from the Minimum Space and spread at an alarmingly fast rate.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before the whole Dust Blood Province was covered in flames.
<br><br>
There was no emotion on Divine Farmer's face as he watched the flames spread. Then, he turned around and left.
<br><br>
The flames would kill most of the creatures in the Dust Blood Province, but Divine Farmer was already numb to such a slaughter. After all, he had witnessed so much.
<br><br>
A few moments later, he showed up in another province. With a flick of his finger, a dot of fire bloomed once again.
<br><br>
Trillions of creatures in every province he set fire on perished! There had been countless fights and disputes in the Source World ever since its birth. Needless to say, the number of creatures that died in several past major battles was no less than horrifying.
<br><br>
Among the many battles that broke out by the end of the middle ages, the melee between several races was the most tragic. Almost all the races had been involved in that war, leading to extremely large casualties! Usman was born after the melee among the various races.
<br><br>
He was transformed from the negative emotions of the Source World and quickly rose in a short period of time. When he was at his peak, he had even surpassed the captain of the Black Ship and became someone who all forces feared.
<br><br>
Later on, as Usman defected, the captain of the Black Ship had no choice but to join hands with other super forces to kill him.
<br><br>
Many years passed since Usman had died but those who had gone through that battle knew his strength like the back of their hands.
<br><br>
He was a fiend who lurked in the Source World. He was everywhere, waiting for someone to wake him up.
<br><br>
If the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race wanted to start a war that would affect the entire Source World, they might also wake that fiend up.
<br><br>
And to set fire on provinces with the flames from the Minimum Spaces was undoubtedly the most economical method.
<br><br>
Five minutes later, Divine Farmer appeared in the White Seal Province.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to take out the Minimum Space, a giant eagle shadow appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
It was from the Gale Eagle race in the White Seal Province.
<br><br>
The Gale Eagle race wasn't very famous in the Source World, but they had a quite strong leader.
<br><br>
Although he didn't become an Eternal Warrior at the Eternal Realm, he had been in Stage Thirty-two for a long time.
<br><br>
Back then, the leader of the Gale Eagle race had once helped the Divine Farmer race on the Other Shore. "Why did you set fire everywhere and burn down trillions of innocent creatures?" the Gale Eagle asked.
<br><br>
"Mission," Divine Farmer answered briefly.
<br><br>
"Can you let go of the White Seal Province?" the Gale Eagle asked again.
<br><br>
"No," said Divine Farmer, a hint of pity in his eyes.
<br><br>
"But you can lead the Gale Eagle race to leave," he added.
<br><br>
The Gale Eagle was clearly disappointed. He shouted, "The White Seal Province is the ancestral home of our race, so how can we easily give it up? You'll burn it over my dead body!"
<br><br>
Since Divine Farmer was an Eternal Warrior, he was far stronger than the Gale Eagle. The Gale Eagle naturally knew that resistance was futile and he would be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Thus, he was ready to die.
<br><br>
"You once helped us before. Please don't make things difficult for me," said Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
However, the Gale Eagle turned a deaf ear to his plea. At that moment, an Other Shore Token spun above his head. Then, he spread his wings and attacked Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
A few minutes later, the eagle with broken wings fell from the sky and plunged into the ground. Along with him was the Minimum Space with a dot of flame.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the provinces burned to ashes one by one. Restlessness and misery hung like a thick blanket throughout the Source World.
<br><br>
When there was a slight conflict between creatures and races, they would pull out their weapons and attack each other. It happened so much that there were endless conflicts amongst races! Not long after, the negativity in the Source World escalated to the extreme, then suddenly vanished without a trace.
<br><br>
While all of those happened, a new creature was born in one corner of the Source World. This creature emitted an intense aura of evilness.
<br><br>
Chapter 3706 The Reborn Usman This evil creature was born in a human tribe in the Jade Law Province.
<br><br>
The Jade Law Province used to belong to the Nine Li race but after the race was destroyed, it fell under the control of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Ninety percent of the province's population was comprised of humans.
<br><br>
Shortly after their occupation of the Jade Law Province, the Bearing race conducted a ruthless purge within the province.
<br><br>
Those who remained loyal to the Nine Li race were exterminated and any news about the Nine Li race was completely blocked and prohibited.
<br><br>
In time, any trace of the Nine Li race was thoroughly erased and the people of the Jade Law Province completely shifted their loyalties to the Bearing race. Of course, the shifting of loyalties came after the realization that they had no choice but to accept the Bearing race as their new leaders.
<br><br>
The past few days were literal hell as the temperature in the entire Jade Law Province constantly soared. The scorching sun seemed determined to evaporate every last drop of water in the land and the air was thick with heat and irritation over the entire province.
<br><br>
Somewhere within Peace City was the city lord's mansion and in it, a baby was born.
<br><br>
This was a moment of great joy for city lord Paxton Zhou but the moment his child was birthed, he heard a shrill scream.
<br><br>
Concerned about the safety of his wife and child, he hurriedly rushed into the delivery room.
<br><br>
He was not prepared for the sight that awaited him.
<br><br>
His wife lay dead in a pool of blood while several midwives were horrifyingly beheaded. On the floor was a naked baby.
<br><br>
The appearance of his child stunned him.
<br><br>
Judging from the baby's initial appearance, it was undoubtedly human.
<br><br>
However, the two short horns on his head made him look like a fiend.
<br><br>
This fiendish baby giggled and waved his little, bloody hand towards Paxton Zhou as if to proudly tell him that yes, he was the one who killed all these people.
<br><br>
Paxton Zhou felt a shiver run down his back at the sight of his supposed son's evil smile.
<br><br>
He shook his head in denial and tried to make sense of it all.
<br><br>
"This is impossible!" he murmured under his breath. "My son wouldn't do this! You are not my son!"
<br><br>
He was an outstanding warrior in the Jade Law Province. At the young age of over thirty, he was able to reach the Other Shore Realm and become the city lord of Peace City, which was a very extraordinary feat.
<br><br>
How could this terrible devastation happen to his wife and child? As soon as he came to his senses, Paxton Zhou immediately unsheathed his saber.
<br><br>
This was not his son, but a monster from hell! Thus, killing this devil child was justified.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
A wild saber intent was released, ready to hack away at the baby's head.
<br><br>
The power contained within this strike was over a hundred divine megatons, enough to defeat a considerably powerful enemy! Not many people in the entire Jade Law Province could resist an attack from Paxton Zhou and this newborn was no exception.
<br><br>
Or so he thought.
<br><br>
As the saber shadow approached him, the baby smiled. There was no trace of fear in his face as he stretched out his chubby hand towards the oncoming attack.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Instead of being beheaded, the baby grabbed the saber and halted his father's attack! To say Paxton Zhou was shocked would be an understatement.
<br><br>
Even if this child was truly a fiend, he was only a newborn. How in the world was he able to resist such a powerful attack?! "Creak!"
<br><br>
A strong force emanated from the baby as he actually bent the huge saber with his small hand! A great sense of crisis immediately overwhelmed Paxton Zhou.
<br><br>
He didn't know what was going on but he knew that if he let this baby live, it could spell chaos and destruction for the entire Source World! He immediately let go of his saber and rushed towards the baby instead.
<br><br>
There was only one way to go about this and that was to end this fiend's life! If he couldn't use his saber then Paxton Zhou would rely on his fists! Normally, a person would be averse to punching an actual baby. His smooth and milky skin would no doubt deter any malicious thought upon him but the aura he emanated was so malicious that Paxton Zhou had no problems not holding back his attack.
<br><br>
Just as his fist was about a few inches away, an innocent smile broke through the baby's face and Paxton Zhou felt his mind bombarded by sharp, unbearable pain. There was a scream moments before blood spurted out of his orifices and his head exploded.
<br><br>
With his enemy dead, the baby let out a victorious smile and slowly began to crawl out of the delivery room.
<br><br>
Paxton Zhou's scream attracted the guards' attention and all of them rushed towards the delivery room.
<br><br>
Upon arrival, they saw the baby crawling his way out of the bloody chamber, much to their confusion.
<br><br>
As they stared at the baby, he looked up and gave them a mysterious smile.
<br><br>
Puff puff puff puff puff… There was no time for them to run as their heads suddenly exploded and filled the mansion with even more bloodshed.
<br><br>
Their deaths attracted even more guards along with a few famous masters at the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
Of course, the result remained the same. Any person who caught sight of the baby met only one end: with their heads exploded.
<br><br>
All one thousand and eleven people that resided in the mansion died that day.
<br><br>
But the baby was not done with his bloodshed. As he ventured out onto the gates, he crossed paths with various people. All of them shot him strange, panicked looks and why wouldn't they? He was an infant completely covered in blood with eyes that glowed strangely.
<br><br>
Puff puff puff puff puff...
<br><br>
One smile, and that was all it took for all of them to die.
<br><br>
A day passed and the originally bustling Peace City became eerily quiet with nothing but dead bodies.
<br><br>
The seemingly innocent baby was now on his way out of the city gates.
<br><br>
However, just as he was about to cross the threshold, a thin figure appeared in front of him. It was Yellow Thearch! He instinctively resisted this figure and a cautious look plastered all over his face. He suddenly knitted his tiny brows and launched an explosive attack towards Yellow Thearch's head.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
There was a loud sound as Yellow Thearch took the blow but, unlike all the previous victims, his head remained whole and his expression remained unchanged.
<br><br>
A trace of anger appeared on the baby's face as he continued his barrage of attacks in an effort to blow up Yellow Thearch's head.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang, Bang..."
<br><br>
For some reason, no matter how hard the baby tried, Yellow Thearch remained unyielding nor did he make any effort to fight back. In fact, there was a trace of tenderness in his eyes when he looked at the small infant.
<br><br>
To the baby's horror, Yellow Thearch bent down and picked him up in his arms.
<br><br>
What could've been seen as a gentle act was actually anything but. Yellow Thearch's hold contained an irresistible force.
<br><br>
The baby was effectively restrained by the powerful being. "What's your name?" Yellow Thearch asked.
<br><br>
Nobody in their right mind would ask a baby a question and expect an answer, but then again this was no ordinary baby. Not only did Yellow Thearch expect an answer from him, but his tone also held a trace of authority that allowed no retorts.
<br><br>
There was a momentary trace of hesitation on the baby's face but Yellow Thearch insisted.
<br><br>
"Tell me."
<br><br>
Realizing that there was no dodging the powerful being's query, the baby babbled for a few seconds before answering. "My name is Usman..."
<br><br>
The corners of Yellow Thearch's mouth curled up in a smile. "Very good."
<br><br>
He was not surprised to hear that.
<br><br>
The Usman that previously existed belonged to the Black Ship and was killed in the hands of Yellow Thearch and a few other people. However, someone like Usman, who was the incarnation of all negative emotions of the Source World, could not really die. So long as resentment and hate remained and accumulated to a certain level, he would be reborn infinitely.
<br><br>
"From now on, you will be the boy of our Bearing race!" Yellow Thearch declared.
<br><br>
As he said that, he tightened his grip onto the baby and walked into the void, leaving behind a dead city with headless corpses.
<br><br>
Chapter 3707 Soul City After he finally understood the entire story, the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't order Ziya any further.
<br><br>
What occurred in the Deleting Space was beyond what he'd imagined.
<br><br>
He needed time to absorb what he'd seen, and at the same time, had to hand over the exploration of the Abstruse Energy World to Ziya and Geoffrey.
<br><br>
After all, energy souls couldn't give much help.
<br><br>
As for the Heart of Limit, Zen tried to carry it.
<br><br>
Since the Heart of Limit was taken to the Deleting Space from the Abstruse Energy World, he tried to use the Truth of Three-Energy Construction to carry it but failed.
<br><br>
No matter how hard they analyzed, neither Zen nor Ziya could seem to understand the reason it didn't work.
<br><br>
But because Zen was the first person to carry the Other Shore Token in the Deleting Space, the problem could be in the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, Deleting Space, or the Heart of Limit itself. Still, they couldn't pinpoint the right one.
<br><br>
Ziya looked very disappointed. He wanted so bad to see the Deleting Space as another Other Shore.
<br><br>
But Zen wasn't bothered by it.
<br><br>
With his current abilities, he still could not bring the three Civilization Artifacts to their limits. Even if he truly carried the Heart of Limit, there would be no guarantee that it would help him.
<br><br>
At this point, his top priority was to achieve a higher level on the Other Shore. Nothing else mattered except this.
<br><br>
A few days later, Zen left the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
And since Zen left, so did the energy souls. Meanwhile, the bodies Ziya had created for the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others remained like statues in the palace.
<br><br>
Geoffrey, on the other hand, remained in the Deleting Space. He was not alone - he had the holy maiden of the Flower Dancing Sect as company.
<br><br>
Zen's promise to Geoffrey was finally fulfilled now.
<br><br>
Even so, Zen was still uneasy with this action. He mentioned to Letitia that Geoffrey had been chosen by a human master and accepted as a disciple.
<br><br>
This meant that he was to be secluded and isolated for a long stretch of time.
<br><br>
If Letitia found out that Zen lied to her, would she still treat him as intimately as usual? Weeks went by and the Oneness Sky Palace was gradually restored to its original state.
<br><br>
The once damaged Dragon City had been rebuilt, while the Phoenix Palace had been moved elsewhere.
<br><br>
Because the Bearing race broke through the Dragon Cliff, the southeast of the Bloom Divine Province grew restless. It was for this reason that Goran replaced the dead Patton in order to guard the cliff and protect the province.
<br><br>
All the creatures in the Bloom Divine Province were jittery and anxious. It came to a point that a handful of powerful masters even chose to move their families all the way to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
This was a smart move. No matter what had happened, the Pear Hill proved to be much stronger than the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Whoever wanted to attack the Pear Hill, might it be the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race, would have to think hard before taking a move.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace did not stop anyone from moving if they wanted to.
<br><br>
In essence, a good bird perches only on a fine tree. In the same suit, humans of Bloom Divine Province could move if they found it more suitable. Even Pearce and Auden wanted to move all the senior leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace to the Pear Hill, just so they could avoid any more disasters.
<br><br>
As long as Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi woke up, they could return to the Bloom Divine Province safe and sound.
<br><br>
This was the most rational choice. But if all the masters of the Oneness Sky Palace fled from the Bloom Divine Province, it would only lead to the collapse of the palace. Hence, they didn't dare to make such a decision for Eastern Emperor Taiyi as he had spent a long time building the palace.
<br><br>
After a hasty, passionate discussion, Pearce, Auden, Athemar, and Winchell chose to stay in the Bloom Divine Province. Once they came to an agreement, Pearce replaced Eastern Emperor Taiyi and issued an imperial edict to the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
Through the edict, the war between the humans and the Sun Crow race was made public. Also written in the edit, he informed that the Pear Hill would provide assistance if necessary, to calm down the panic in the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
Still, Zen didn't care too much regarding these matters. Even though he had been in the Oneness Sky Palace for a long time, it was not meant for him forever.
<br><br>
After knowing Elvinia had burned the Truth Enlightenment when she thought she was doomed, he wrote down another one for her.
<br><br>
After Pearce obtained the Truth Enlightenment, he was very surprised.
<br><br>
There was no point in hiding it anymore now. All he wanted to do was to help the palace with it.
<br><br>
However, if everyone in the Oneness Sky Palace knew the Truth Enlightenment, it wouldn't be long until everyone started using it for their own personal interests. Many people from the Bearing race, Divine Farmer race, and other super forces could also learn it, especially because they also cultivated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.
<br><br>
It was for this reason that Pearce made a rule. Every person who read the Truth Enlightenment could only share it with one person they trusted. Also, they needed to swear an oath so that the Truth Enlightenment could not be leaked.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore, the figures of Zen and Elvinia reappeared.
<br><br>
They had cleared their goals just after the fierce battle with the Sun Crow race had finished.
<br><br>
In order to enter Stage Thirty-three, they would have to enter the Soul City and go through the Land of Bone Tribulation first. With their Indigo Souls at the ultimate level, it would be no problem for them to enter Stage Twenty-nine to get to Soul City.
<br><br>
There happened to be temples in Stage Seventeen, but none that interested them.
<br><br>
Once they'd passed through the white star ring, Zen and Elvinia transformed into two rays of white light and made their way upwards.
<br><br>
Then, they arrived at Stage Eighteen which was a translucent ice field.
<br><br>
Here, ancient secrets were sealed within the thick ice. Historically, many ruling civilizations had made this stage their habitat. However, they ended up disappearing into history - some were eliminated, and some were forced to hide.
<br><br>
The two walked a long distance along the ice field before they came into contact with the star ring leading to Stage Nineteen. Here, they stepped onto the star ring and were sent up into the air once again.
<br><br>
Once they arrived in Stage Nineteen, they stepped out of the star ring and a whistling wind swept through them.
<br><br>
In Stage Nineteen, the hurricanes never ceased. As they scanned the area, they could only see boundless yellow sand.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the star ring leading to Stage Twenty was not too far away.
<br><br>
Elvinia led the way, and they found the star ring in less than five minutes.
<br><br>
Near the star ring, some human Souls of Light sized up them. Their origins were unknown, but they seemed to be powerful. Not long after though, the Souls of Light retreated from the Other Shore after whispering among each other.
<br><br>
Just as Zen and Elvinia were about to step into the star ring and enter Stage Twenty, Zen paused.
<br><br>
He recalled that not long after he entered the Source World, he obtained an Other Shore Key from the tomb of the Sword Light Palace's leader. That Other Shore Key could open up a temple in Stage Nineteen.
<br><br>
But now, such a temple was no longer attractive to Zen. He wanted to give that Other Shore Token to Chaim and his companions for exploration.
<br><br>
After a few moments, he continued and stepped into the star ring alongside Elvinia.
<br><br>
They passed Stage Twenty, Stage Twenty-one, and Stage Twenty-two...
<br><br>
And as they passed each stage, they saw every scene change drastically.
<br><br>
If it were any other person, they would have stopped in each stage just to explore.
<br><br>
However, Zen and Elvinia had one goal only. They moved up stages quickly, each and every time they found the star ring.
<br><br>
It didn't take long until they arrived in Stage Twenty-eight, the Eternal Prohibition Stage. The upper stage of it was the Constant Glory Stage, where the Soul City was located. Their journey was about to finish! However, they met some challenges in no time.
<br><br>
Chapter 3708 Another Way Generally speaking, the forces in different stages of the Other Shore had different structures.
<br><br>
For instance, the ruling civilizations were considered as the supreme forces in some stages, just like the Abyss Spirit race that dominated Stage Eleven of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In some stages, the native races on the Other Shore became the rulers.
<br><br>
At the very beginning, the Element Spirit race had tried to rule the Other Shore. They also had a plan about the stage rulers, especially since the Dark Region had appeared. They wanted to occupy all the nineteen stages of the Desire World and make sure that they would control the ruler in each stage.
<br><br>
It was a good plan. During their peak, nearly thirteen of the nineteen stage rulers belonged to the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
However, what the Element Spirit race did was an offense to everyone else.
<br><br>
By the time the Dark Region had appeared, the Other Shore was already a very perfect world. Many of the ruling civilizations that escaped from the chaos were not easy to deal with.
<br><br>
The high pressure on the Element Spirit race was what eventually broke them. At the same time, there were other races such as the Nihility race that attacked them. Now, only six stage rulers were completely under the Element Spirit race's control.
<br><br>
Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore, the Eternal Prohibition Stage, was under the control of the Element Spirit race. However, the higher the stage was, the more the larger races would restrain themselves.
<br><br>
Although the stage ruler of the Eternal Prohibition Stage was from the Element Spirit race, in the past few years, the Element Spirit race had rarely interfered in the travel of other races on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After many races had resisted in their last attempt, the Element Spirit race realized that they could only control the Other Shore if they did it step by step. Hindering the development of the other ruling civilizations or completely destroying them would have adverse effects.
<br><br>
Such a strategy conceptualized after reflection was effective. Under the continuous influence of the Element Spirit race, many races and ruling civilizations on the Other Shore were willing to or were forced to join them.
<br><br>
Now, there were very few races that could oppose the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Recently, there had been some changes in the Eternal Prohibition Stage.
<br><br>
More and more Moon Fire Slaves descended from Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
As the strongest fighters of the Element Spirit race, the Moon Fire Slaves were undoubtedly a powerful force.
<br><br>
Therefore the races of the Other Shore that lived in Stage Twenty-eight felt uneasy at their presence.
<br><br>
Numerous mountains were everywhere in the Eternal Prohibition Stage.
<br><br>
They were so many that if one looked down at them from the sky, they looked like a herd of elephants looking for food. In the center of the mountains was a huge basin, where the only structure was the big city in the Eternal Prohibition Stage—the Forbidden Rain City.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen, who carried Elvinia on his back, floated high up in the sky and observed the Forbidden Rain City.
<br><br>
"The Dark Region in Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore is so small..."
<br><br>
he commented.
<br><br>
In the center of the large city was only a beam of black light. The Dark Region looked particularly weak in Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Perhaps it's because Stage Twenty-eight is not important. This beam of black light must be a passageway to the Dark Region," Elvinia deduced.
<br><br>
Recently, Elvinia became very rational and had a detailed understanding of the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation.
<br><br>
Back then, she didn't want to face her past. Now, she realized that she belonged to the Oneness Sky Palace and was a real human being. Even if she couldn't save her father, she could still do something for the Oneness Sky Palace. She couldn't just be an incompetent member of royalty who couldn't do anything but watch the Oneness Sky Palace decline.
<br><br>
"The star ring within Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore should be in the northwest," she said.
<br><br>
"We can get to the Soul City after we've passed through the star ring," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
At that moment, the two of them climbed up the stages of the Other Shore at a great speed.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Elvinia became more cautious. "The entire Stage Twenty-eight is under the control of the Element Spirit race. If we want to pass through it, we must be careful. Thus Master Pearce has sent someone to pick us up at the gate of the Forbidden Rain City," she said.
<br><br>
It was known that Zen had caught the attention of the Element Spirit race several times.
<br><br>
After all, he had killed the stage ruler in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore and opened the Creation Myth Temple in Stage Seventeen. If the members of the Element Spirit race weren't fools, of course they would stop Zen from entering the star ring.
<br><br>
"Whoosh! Whoosh..."
<br><br>
They crossed countless mountains, and finally arrived at the edge of the Forbidden Rain City.
<br><br>
Perhaps because the Element Spirit race had controlled the entire Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore, the Forbidden Rain City didn't guard against the creatures that came in and out of the city. There weren't even any guards who watched over the city gate.
<br><br>
But for some reason, Zen and Elvinia caught the attention of the creatures from the Other Shore the moment they arrived.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen became vigilant. He didn't believe that their attention was out of kind concern.
<br><br>
A human Soul of Light stood by the side of the city gate, and quietly approached Zen and Elvinia when they showed up. Then, he lowered his voice and said, "Are you Princess Elvinia?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Elvinia answered.
<br><br>
"I'm Doyle Zhuo. Let's talk outside the city," said Doyle Zhuo.
<br><br>
He was a member on the third floor of the Land of Sword Grief. Zen had seen him twice before, but they had never talked to each other.
<br><br>
When Zen and Elvinia saw the mysterious look on Doyle's face, they also lowered their heads and followed him out of the city gate. After they found a secluded place, Doyle Zhuo said, "Elder Pearce asked me to lead you to the Constant Glory Stage.
<br><br>
I have been observing in the Forbidden Rain City these days." "How is everything going in the city?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
"Quite a few Moon Fire Slaves recently came here. There weren't a lot of them here before, until now. They might come over to take action against the two of you," Doyle Zhuo answered.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Zen and Elvinia frowned at the same time.
<br><br>
They had already witnessed how strong the Moon Fire Slaves were, but at that time, the Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore had greatly restrained the power of the Moon Fire Slaves. Now that they were in Stage Twenty-eight, they could demonstrate far greater power.
<br><br>
"Are they only targeting us? How about the other Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"No," Doyle Zhuo said and shook his head. He looked at Elvinia and continued, "Both of you came here with your physical bodies, and your face is clear, Princess Elvinia.
<br><br>
You can't pass through the star ring openly without alerting the Moon Fire Slaves!" "Then what should we do?" Elvinia asked as her beautiful eyes narrowed into slits.
<br><br>
Zen also lowered his head in silence.
<br><br>
If the star ring was really heavily guarded, there would be no other decent way except for breaking into the star ring as he did in Stage Eleven of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"But this time, there are creatures from other races that are willing to help,"
<br><br>
Doyle Zhuo said out of the blue.
<br><br>
"Who are willing to help?" Elvinia asked curiously. "The Ear Mouse race,"
<br><br>
replied Doyle Zhuo with a smile.
<br><br>
"Elder Pearce has spent a lot of soul pills on the cooperation with the Ear Mouse race. You can go to the star ring through the underground passageway outside the Forbidden Rain City," he explained.
<br><br>
The mouse races on the Other Shore were always considered as strong and formidable beings, and most of them had a good relationship with the Ear Mouse race.
<br><br>
Yet, Elvinia just rolled her eyes at Doyle Zhuo's answer. Since he was already prepared, he could just come straight to the point. Why did he have to beat around the bush now? It was true that he came all the way from Stage Twenty-nine to meet with Elvinia, so she didn't say much. There was only a slight hint of dissatisfaction in her voice as she said, "Then please lead the way!"
<br><br>
After that, Zen and Elvinia, under Doyle Zhuo's lead, traveled to the front of the mountain nearest to the Forbidden Rain City.
<br><br>
On one side of the mountain was a naturally formed cave. Several huge mice guarded the cave's entrance.
<br><br>
Chapter 3709 A Trap These mice were gigantic. Their faces looked ferocious, and their beansized eyes were fixated on them.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the unfriendly gazes of these giant mice, Zen said, "Doyle, I don't think the Ear Mouse race is here."
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse race had entered the Other Shore in the form of Souls of Light, and Zen had been on good terms with them.
<br><br>
Now that he couldn't see any Ear Mouse here, Zen felt something was amiss.
<br><br>
"Most Souls of Light don't stay in Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse race will also choose to stay in the Constant Glory Stage to pass the test of the Soul City. If it weren't for you and Princess Elvinia, I wouldn't have come either," answered Doyle.
<br><br>
"But these giant mice..." Zen said hesitantly.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, Zen. These are members of the Twilight Mouse race. They take orders from the Ear Mouse race, so there is no problem," said Doyle, who then took the lead and entered the cave ahead of Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia glanced at Zen and smiled faintly. "Don't be suspicious. Let's go in too!" she said.
<br><br>
Zen stood still on the spot for a moment. It was as if he was communicating with someone. Before long, the deep creases in his brows smoothened, and he raised his legs and strode forward to catch up with Elvinia. His steps were now firm.
<br><br>
Mice were good at digging holes underground. The Twilight Mouse race had been living in Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore for several chaotic eras.
<br><br>
The underground world of Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore was even more complicated than the Forbidden Rain City, but the Twilight Mouse race had obviously become the hegemony here.
<br><br>
After the three of them entered the cave, a Twilight Mouse reached out and gently pressed the wall of the cave.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! With a series of reverberating booming noises, a huge rock rolled down at a slow speed and fell right at the entrance, sealing the entrance tightly.
<br><br>
The moment the entrance of the cave was sealed, the inside of the cave immediately darkened.
<br><br>
Crack! As soon as the cave fell into darkness, several dots of flames appeared at their sights.
<br><br>
Several Twilight Mice were holding torches in their hands, illuminating the surroundings with ease.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, Zen, please," said Doyle, stretching out his hand and making a "please gesture" towards the cave.
<br><br>
The cave near the surface of the mountain was very spacious. The Twilight Mouse race seemed to have even leveled the ground inside the cave, because the road ahead looked quite flat.
<br><br>
After about dozens of miles, however, the cave became increasingly narrow.
<br><br>
In some places, only one person could pass at one time.
<br><br>
Although the bodies of the Twilight Mice were huge, it didn't affect their agility. They could pass these narrow areas in a flash, while Zen and Elvinia had to spend more time doing the same.
<br><br>
Half a day later, they had traveled more than a hundred miles underground.
<br><br>
After walking in the narrow cave for so long, Elvinia finally asked impatiently, "Why haven't we arrived at the destination, Doyle?"
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, the Forbidden Rain City is very large. We have to cross more than half of the city to go to the northwest corner, so it will take some time," replied Doyle.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Don't worry, we'll arrive soon. Why are you this anxious?" one member of the Twilight Mouse race said coldly.
<br><br>
Doyle turned around and gave the Twilight Mouse a fierce glare. The Twilight Mouse lowered its head and fell silent.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked her eyes and looked at Zen quietly. No matter how obtuse she was, she could sense that something was wrong at this moment.
<br><br>
Zen secretly winked at her, signaling her to keep silent.
<br><br>
Doyle was a member of the Oneness Sky Palace. If he betrayed the Oneness Sky Palace, he definitely wouldn't be able to leave alive, so he wouldn't do such a thing.
<br><br>
Therefore, there were only two possibilities. One was that the Doyle in front of Zen and Elvinia was a fake, and the other was that Doyle's Soul of Light was controlled by someone else.
<br><br>
As for these Twilight Mice, they most likely had nothing to do with the Ear Mouse race.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, now, I'm afraid there's really something wrong with this," Zen said in his mind.
<br><br>
In fact, he had already felt that something was amiss when they were outside the Forbidden Rain City. At that time, he had wanted to remind Elvinia and refuse Doyle's request, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven told Zen in his mind that he shouldn't take any action right away.
<br><br>
Now that they had spent such a long time traveling underground, they were most likely heading to trouble, so Zen naturally hoped that the Primeval Lord of Heaven would show up and solve the problem.
<br><br>
"Don't worry," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said calmly. "It's only Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore. I can handle it."
<br><br>
In the Creation Myth Temple, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had only used one finger to kill those Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
At that time, the strength of the Moon Fire Slaves was indeed suppressed, but so was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's. As long as he didn't encounter any genuinely powerful warrior of the Element Spirit race, he still had some ways to cope.
<br><br>
"Don't listen to the nonsense of these mice. After all, they are just animals.
<br><br>
Haha," Doyle explained and then continued to lead the way.
<br><br>
After passing through those narrow parts, the road ahead gradually became wide again.
<br><br>
Soon afterward, the three of them and the Twilight Mice arrived at a circular cave. The walls of the cave had been carefully carved. Instead of a cave, the place where they were now looked more like a magnificent palace.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen and Elvinia entered the cave, Doyle said, "We are under the star rings."
<br><br>
"We can enter our star ring after we go up?" asked Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Yes, you're right," Doyle said, nodding his head. "But it's a pity that you won't have the chance to go up alive..."
<br><br>
"Dong dong dong..."
<br><br>
There were six passages around the circular cave. The sounds of heavy footsteps echoed from those passages, and green light also spread from inside them. Very soon, Moon Fire Slaves with green flames burning on their bodies flooded out of the passages.
<br><br>
Elvinia took a step back and leaned against Zen. She frowned and glared at Doyle. "Doyle, what do you mean by this?"
<br><br>
With a smirk, Doyle said, "Nothing serious. Someone wants to take your lives, and I just brought you here as required."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, those Moon Fire Slaves entered the cave.
<br><br>
The temperature in the whole cave continued to rise.
<br><br>
"Are you really Doyle?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Zen's calmness made Doyle somewhat flustered and even a little apprehensive. In an impatient tone, he said, "Whether I'm Doyle or not, what does it have to do with you?"
<br><br>
"I'm just curious. Doyle's still a member of the Oneness Sky Palace. If he betrays the Oneness Sky Palace, he won't be able to survive. This being the case, you're most likely not Doyle," Zen said in a flat tone.
<br><br>
"Haha! I'm not him—so?"
<br><br>
The shape of Doyle's Soul of Light gradually changed, and his voice also turned sharper. Although his face couldn't be seen clearly, it was obvious that he had changed into another person.
<br><br>
As it turned out, someone else's Soul of Light had been disguising as Doyle.
<br><br>
"If you're Doyle, I can show you some mercy. But since you're not, you're doomed to death," Zen replied indifferently.
<br><br>
"Really? Haha... Then you'd better see if you can survive first!" The man took a step back while pointing at Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves, who had been approaching them slowly, now rushed over from different directions.
<br><br>
"Zen, we have no other choice but to fight!" Elvinia squinted and said.
<br><br>
Just as she was about to rush towards one of the passages, Zen stretched his hand, grabbed her wrist, and pulled it gently. At the same time, a shadow appeared on his forehead.
<br><br>
Chapter 3710 The Power Of Finger Light The shadow which had appeared was the Primeval Lord of Heaven himself.
<br><br>
Even in the Eternal Scroll Painting, his ranking was quite high.
<br><br>
In the past, it was he who led the human race to fight against the Element Spirit race face to face. Furthermore, he himself had killed many Moon Fire Slaves throughout his time.
<br><br>
Although his real body was trapped and only his energy soul was left, it was not a problem for him to use the power left in the Creation Myth Temple to help Zen resist the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Vibrations could be felt in the air as the battle started.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
A finger light drew an arc and shot towards the Moon Fire Slave in the front. The Moon Fire Slave collapsed to the ground with a loud thump, which was almost impossible to hear amidst the surrounding din.
<br><br>
Clap! The finger light's force left thunder-like sounds.
<br><br>
The power of the finger light could be considered extremely strong in Stage Seventeen. It was also at the top in Stage Twenty-eight, but it was no longer as terrifying as it was in Stage Seventeen.
<br><br>
However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had experienced many battles. His experience harnessed not only his instincts, but also his skills. The finger light that pierced through the armor of the Moon Fire Slaves accurately pierced into the flames and through their spiritual cores.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
The nine Moon Fire Slaves that surrounded them from all directions froze in place.
<br><br>
After a few seconds, the flames that were emitted from the armor gradually shrank, disappeared, and extinguished.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves were a kind of fire spirits, and the flames were their forms. Since their spiritual cores were broken and their flame bodies disappeared, the powerful armor on their bodies collapsed and fell to the ground.
<br><br>
The Soul of Light and the several Twilight Mice that had deceived Zen into coming in were all stunned. Their eyes were in a sort of daze and confusion was evident on their faces.
<br><br>
What had just happened was indeed unexpected, for they really looked up to the Moon Fire Slaves. In fact, in their eyes, the Moon Fire Slaves were invincible.
<br><br>
No one in Stage Twenty-eight could resist them. Even the ruler of Stage Twenty-eight couldn't resist the joint attack of several Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
It should have been a piece of cake for the nine Moon Fire Slaves to kill two human beings, who had mere physical bodies, in a confined space.
<br><br>
But in a flash, the nine Moon Fire Slaves were killed! Their shock was unmatched. Amongst the crowd were gasps, dropped jaws, and pale faces.
<br><br>
"Kill them! Kill them!" the Soul of Light ordered desperately, once he realized what had just happened.
<br><br>
He had a high status, but after all, he was just a Soul of Light. It was impossible for him to fight against Elvinia and Zen.
<br><br>
Following the man's order, those Twilight Mice all determinedly rushed towards Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed slightly. He lowered his body and jumped high towards the sky. His feet landed directly on the top of the head of the Twilight Mouse positioned in front.
<br><br>
Boom! The Twilight Mouse's head was directly crushed.
<br><br>
Zen didn't stop. With a crisp crack of lightning, his fist had already smashed into the head of another Twilight Mouse.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! His body flashed a few times, and the several Twilight Mice had lost their heads.
<br><br>
The Soul of Light's eyes widened as he watched the Twilight Mice being killed one by one by Zen. Then, he realized that he should withdraw from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Just as he began to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune, he saw a handful of green sand pouring over like rain. The Soul Restraining Sand fell on the surface of his Soul of Light, locking him on the Other Shore. Now, as much as he wanted to leave, he couldn't.
<br><br>
Elvinia clapped her hands to clean up the Soul Restraining Sand between her fingers. A small smile curled on her lips as she asked, "All this makes me want to know who will die now, us or you?"
<br><br>
The Soul of Light's desire to survive was very strong. After realizing that he was unable to leave the Other Shore, he turned around and wildly ran towards a passageway in the cave.
<br><br>
After all, he had been trained in the Soul City, so his escape speed was not slow.
<br><br>
If he met another person, he might have been able to escape, but unfortunately, he met Zen.
<br><br>
Crack! Accompanied by a loud bolt of lightning, Zen suddenly appeared beside him. He stretched out his hand and gently pulled the Soul of Light. He was like a kite with a broken string, weightless, and was easily thrown back by Zen.
<br><br>
"Let, let me go..." the man pleaded. His heart was pounding tremendously against his chest, and he struggled to catch his breath.
<br><br>
"Besides ambushing us here, does the Element Spirit race have any other plans?" Zen asked in a firm tone. His eyes were sharp, as if they were to pierce through whatever lies this man might stutter.
<br><br>
"No, no!" the man answered immediately, afraid that Zen didn't believe him. Fear was reflected in his eyes. Zen tried to look deeper to see if there was malice in his answer. He then added, "Who would have thought that so many Moon Fire Slaves couldn't do anything to you? I thought even one Moon Fire Slave would be enough. What had happened was beyond my imagination."
<br><br>
"Is this really the northwest corner of the Forbidden Rain City?" Zen asked again. He was still unsure whether to trust this man's answers, but he needed to understand the situation better.
<br><br>
"Yes. You will reach it as long as you go up through this passage. There are some Twilight Mice along the way but with your strength, you can pass through smoothly," the man said.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Elvinia, whose eyes flashed with killing intent. Elvinia nodded at him and a small smile formed on her thin and sharp lips.
<br><br>
Before the man could react, Zen's arms slightly curled his head.
<br><br>
Pop! The Soul of Light was like a fragile bubble, shattering and disappearing in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
They didn't really care who this person was. Since he was a human, it was most likely that he came from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
As for where the real Doyle was and whether he was killed or not, they could only investigate after they left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Following the direction given by the Soul of Light, Zen and Elvinia soon saw flat steps. Their every move was done with caution and all their senses were alert. After climbing up a certain distance, they heard some squeaks ahead. Then, bean-sized eyes floated from the darkness on both sides of the steps.
<br><br>
Sure enough, as the man said, there scattered many Twilight Mice in this passageway.
<br><br>
"Those Moon Fire Slaves are all dead below. I wouldn't mind killing the entire Twilight Mouse race as well. If you don't want to die, you can come up," Zen said coldly. His eyes were sharp and alert and he said those words in all seriousness.
<br><br>
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! The Moon Fire Slaves were arranged by the Twilight Mice. The Twilight Mice were shocked when they heard that all nine of the Moon Fire Slaves had been killed.
<br><br>
Even as creatures of Stage Twenty-eight on the Other Shore, they were still not qualified to participate in a battle of this level. Moreover, the Element Spirit race did not give an order to let them attack Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Squeaks echoed and soon, the eyes glowing in the darkness disappeared one by one.
<br><br>
After the Twilight Mice left, Zen continued to walk up with Elvinia. After they came out from a square well, they saw neatly arranged star rings.
<br><br>
"The Soul of Light didn't lie to us," Zen said, nodding his head slightly as he sized up the star rings.
<br><br>
In the Lust World, there were many star rings on each stage. Almost every ruling civilization had a star ring.
<br><br>
However, many civilizations were still not able to reach a high stage. Now that it was Stage Twenty-eight, the number of star rings had decreased significantly. There were only more than 100 star rings in front of them, which meant that only more than 100 ruling civilizations had once come here.
<br><br>
After finding the human race's star ring, Zen immediately threw himself into it. Elvinia immediately followed, imitating Zen's posture. Then, the two of them turned into two white lights and flew into the sky.
<br><br>
Stage Twenty-eight was under the rule of the Element Spirit race. If they knew that the Moon Fire Slaves had been killed, they would probably turn to the stage ruler. If that happened, there might be another fierce battle.
<br><br>
Thus, the earlier they left, the better.
<br><br>
In what seemed to be an instant, two beams of straight white light shuttled all the way and finally arrived at Stage Twenty-nine, where the Soul City was located.
<br><br>
Chapter 3711 The Boiling Blood A peak in blood-red color stood towering into the cloud. This was where the star ring of the human race was located.
<br><br>
The circle of light in the middle of the star ring quivered, and two figures suddenly appeared in its vicinity.
<br><br>
Once Zen's eyes adapted to the environment, he looked around and was instantly stunned.
<br><br>
On that peak, there was a circular platform with about seven or eight star rings at its center. The ones ascending to this place weren't limited to the human race; other races also ascended to this place. Dozens of Souls of Light crowded around the circular platform.
<br><br>
These Souls of Light had different forms. They belonged to various races, but for some reason, none of them belonged to the human race.
<br><br>
When they saw Zen's and Elvinia's corporeal bodies, their eyes lit up.
<br><br>
"These two people... They have corporeal bodies?"
<br><br>
"How do they do that?"
<br><br>
"That human girl seems to be an Other Shore creature?"
<br><br>
Since they could see Elvinia's features clearly, they naturally took her as an Other Shore creature.
<br><br>
Ignoring these Souls of Light, Zen walked to the edge of the round platform and looked around.
<br><br>
There were many blood-red peaks in the Constant Glory Stage. They were quite far away from each other and were surrounded by abysses. A lava-like red liquid flowed at the depth of those abysses.
<br><br>
"From Stage Twenty-nine to above, the Other Shore will be extremely dangerous," Elvinia, who stood beside him, spoke. "As you can see, the bottom of the Constant Glory Stage is filled with red liquid known as 'boiling blood', Any creature that comes into contact with it will completely melt away."
<br><br>
"But it isn't dangerous, is it?" Zen's gaze had already shifted from the bottom to the side of the peak. Paths that looked endless had been built among these peaks. As long as they didn't seek death and jump into the boiling blood, they would naturally be able to pass through safely.
<br><br>
Moreover, Zen could fly in the air, so it was naturally easier for him to pass through.
<br><br>
"Human friend, the boiling blood at the bottom isn't a big deal, but don't forget that there are still those Garudas in the sky!" A Soul of Light almost thirty feet tall suddenly came towards them.
<br><br>
"Garudas..."
<br><br>
Zen looked up.
<br><br>
Vaguely, shadows of giant birds could be seen flying about behind the clouds. However. Those birds seemed to do nothing else except circling around high in the sky.
<br><br>
"According to the information I've checked, we indeed have to be wary of them," Elvinia said as she nodded. "The Garudas are the most powerful creatures on the Constant Glory Stage. Even the Other Shore creatures are prey for those birds, let alone the Souls of Light."
<br><br>
Souls of Light were much more fragile than corporeal bodies. Even if one had entered Soul City, they would still be powerless—that was unless they could completely pass the test of Soul City, become a Colorless Soul, and enter the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
"Yes, yes, yes! That's correct."
<br><br>
The thirty feet tall Soul of Light came over and said, "The situation on the Constant Glory Stage is too dangerous. We've been staying here waiting for a chance to go to the Soul City. Since you two have corporeal bodies, could you please escort us there?"
<br><br>
"I'm from the Wild Lion race. As long as you two are willing to escort me through, you just need to name your price..."
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
A hint of curiosity appeared on Zen's expression when he heard this. "Are you trapped here?"
<br><br>
"Yes! Those Garudas are cunning. We're safe only when we stay on this round platform. Once we step onto those paths, we'll be targeted by them,"
<br><br>
the member of the Wild Lion race said with a nod.
<br><br>
A smaller Soul of Light beside him had already come to the edge of the round platform. He quietly took a step towards the path and said, "See for yourself if you don't believe us!"
<br><br>
The Soul of Light had just stood on the path for a short while when a gust of wind swept down from above. A huge winged shadow rushed down at an incredible speed and then landed next to the path.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the short Soul of Light managed to take back his foot before the Garuda rushed down.
<br><br>
"Chirp!"
<br><br>
The Garuda let out an angry cry. It then directed its beak fiercely towards the short Soul of Light to peck him.
<br><br>
However, the moment its beak crossed the edge of the platform, a streak of blood-red lightning emerged out of thin air along with sizzle noises. The Garuda let out a miserable cry, quickly flapped its wings, and rushed back to the sky, leaving behind a lingering burnt smell in the air.
<br><br>
"That's how it is," the short Soul of Light said.
<br><br>
The thirty-foot tall Soul of Light chuckled and said, "Jairo, the Garuda will certainly bear a grudge after you teased it like this. When you walk through the path, you'll be its first target."
<br><br>
Jairo said nonchalantly, "These birds are guarding this place all the time anyway. At worst, I'll just have to stay here for the rest of my life."
<br><br>
When Zen heard their conversation, it finally dawned on him that these people had probably been trapped here for quite a long time.
<br><br>
If the Constant Glory Stage had always been like this, it was theoretically impossible for them to get through.
<br><br>
He pondered the matter for a while and then said, "No, this is strange. If those Garudas have always been here, how did the others go to Soul City before?"
<br><br>
"Everyone can only wait for an opportunity," Elvinia said. "I heard that as long as there is blood fog, the Garudas will never want to come down. That being the case, when the blood fog spreads, everyone will quickly rush to the Soul City where they'll thus be safe!"
<br><br>
"Then how often does the blood fog occur?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"We've stayed here for a long time, but we've yet to see the blood fog,"
<br><br>
another Soul of Light replied.
<br><br>
The appearance of the blood fog was completely random. Sometimes, the blood fog could spread for more than half of the Constant Glory Stage.
<br><br>
Sometimes, even though there was blood fog, it could only cover a portion of the area, so they still couldn't go to the Soul City.
<br><br>
"Then do you want us to fight against those strange birds?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Exactly!" the short Soul of Light said.
<br><br>
"It's too dangerous," Elvinia vetoed the idea. "Those Garudas are the most powerful creatures here. If they swarm over, you won't be able to defend yourself against them!"
<br><br>
Although she was confident in Zen, she didn't want him to take risks.
<br><br>
Elvinia's objection made those Souls of Light disappointed. One after another, they went back to their original positions. Some of them even chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune and withdrew from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Right at this moment, the voice of the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly rang in Zen's mind. "This is really strange. Has the Blood Fog Spell already gone extinct in the Constant Glory Stage?"
<br><br>
"Blood Fog Spell? What is that?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Well, it seems that the Element Spirit race have worked hard over the years to erase a lot of things," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a helpless smile. "The Garudas on the Constant Glory Stage are indeed powerful.
<br><br>
Even the ruler of this stage is a Garuda. This is indeed a rare occurrence."
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the creatures in the Dark Region were much more powerful than the creatures in the Light Region. However, it was indeed rare that both the Dark Region and the Light Region of the Constant Glory Stage were dominated by Garudas.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Garudas were very arrogant.
<br><br>
No matter how hard the Element Spirit race tried, they had never been able to win them over. Although these birds were dangerous and cruel, they didn't listen to the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
The Garudas that stood on the top of the Constant Glory Stage were most afraid of the boiling blood in the abyss. In fact, most of the Other Shore creatures on the Constant Glory Stage relied on the boiling blood to survive.
<br><br>
After the Primeval Lord of Heaven told Zen the origins of the gigantic Garudas, he continued, "Long ago, someone had discovered that the blood fog could drive the Garudas away. Using the Blood Fog Spell to summon the boiling blood fog was practically the necessary means to pass through the Constant Glory Stage. I never expected that no one knows about it now."
<br><br>
Chapter 3712 Before The Gate The Other Shore hadn't always been the same. Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others hadn't returned to the high stages in a long time, they didn't know that they had undergone earth-shattering changes.
<br><br>
Zen was hesitant now. He wondered whether he should listen to Elvinia and leave when the blood fog appeared, or just barge through.
<br><br>
It would be great if the Blood Fog Spell that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had mentioned really existed.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, does the Blood Fog Spell still have an effect?"
<br><br>
Zen asked doubtfully.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven said, "You'll know when you try."
<br><br>
The Blood Fog Spell was similar to the Illusion Breaking Rune and was easy to master. Zen had mastered it in less than five minutes. He then walked to the edge of the round platform.
<br><br>
Elvinia and the others were confused at Zen's behavior and thought that he was about to tease the Garuda like the short Soul of Light.
<br><br>
But they heard Zen vaguely chant something.
<br><br>
While Zen had recited, the blood in the abyss at the foot of the mountain boiled even more fiercely, as if a fierce beast was emerging from it.
<br><br>
A trace of bright red blood floated up into the air.
<br><br>
Elvinia and the others gasped, their eyes widening in shock.
<br><br>
"How has the blood fog appeared so soon?"
<br><br>
"He can summon the blood fog?!"
<br><br>
"I've never heard of such a method before!"
<br><br>
The Blood Fog Spell was not a complicated method, but the Element Spirit race had erased it from history for a long time. There still remained a small number of people who had mastered this method, but no outsider knew of it.
<br><br>
As they watched the blood fog spreading, the Souls of Light rushed cheerily into the path.
<br><br>
But the blood fog seemed to consider Zen as the center and spread around him. It wouldn't move if Zen didn't move forward. This caused the Souls of Light to come to halt and wait for Zen to take the lead.
<br><br>
"Let's go," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
Elvinia, who was standing behind Zen, whispered to him, "Did that senior master teach you this?"
<br><br>
"Yeah," Zen said, nodding.
<br><br>
After he had carried the book, he had owned a number of abilities within himself that he couldn't explain. Elvinia knew the truth, and Zen also hadn't the slightest intention of hiding it from her.
<br><br>
They had no idea who had built the paths that connected those otherwise isolated peaks.
<br><br>
When the Garudas saw people moving ahead on the path below, they spread their wings and pounced down upon the path. But the moment they approached the blood fog, they flapped their wings and flew backwards, crying out in disgust.
<br><br>
As Zen and his companions moved along the path, the blood fog moved along with them.
<br><br>
It faded away about an hour after it started following Zen. At this, Zen chanted the Blood Fog Spell again, and the blood fog became denser and denser once again.
<br><br>
They had just passed the last peak when a huge blood-red peak loomed ahead of them. The surrounding small peaks were nothing compared to this one.
<br><br>
At the top of this peak was a huge platform, on which floated a blurry city.
<br><br>
"Is that the Soul City?" Zen muttered, looking at the blurry city with wide eyes.
<br><br>
It was more a mirage than a city.
<br><br>
The city wasn't real, but an illusion that sat at the top of the peak.
<br><br>
"I think it is," said Elvinia, her eyes burning with excitement. She had read some information about the Soul City, but this was the first time she was seeing it with her own eyes.
<br><br>
"But it's just an illusion," Zen said with a frown. What he was seeing was beyond his expectations.
<br><br>
"Not at all," said a Soul of Light from behind him.
<br><br>
The reason why they were able to come here so easily was because of Zen.
<br><br>
They didn't have anything with which to repay him, which was why they were willing to give out information they knew. The Soul of Light continued, "The Soul City itself is made up of souls. It is said that it sucked tens of millions of souls before becoming what it is now. So the city you see is similar to a Soul of Light."
<br><br>
"The city formed by Souls of Light is so huge!" Zen gasped, shocked.
<br><br>
A short while later, he and Elvinia passed through the long, winding path and reached the top of the peak. The blood fog that had followed him dissipated here.
<br><br>
The gate of the Soul City was huge and grayish brown.
<br><br>
Two gigantic square columns sat on both sides. When Zen walked to one of the columns, he could hear a moan emanating from within.
<br><br>
The square column itself was formed by Souls of Light. They could see dark brown masses within it floated ceaselessly, with many strange faces on them.
<br><br>
"Are these Souls of Light still alive?" Zen asked with surprise.
<br><br>
"Of course they are alive, but they are and will always be a part of the Soul City. They can't be reborn forever!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice rang out.
<br><br>
"It looks like I have underestimated the Soul City," Zen muttered, growing serious.
<br><br>
The Soul City tested the Souls of Light. Only Indigo Souls at the ultimate level were qualified to enter the city. As it opened once every 132 hours, most of the Souls of Light would leave the Other Shore after arriving and would enter the city when its door opened.
<br><br>
Most of the Souls of Light that stayed at the entrance of the city hadn't reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul yet. They either sat crosslegged at the entrance and cultivated, or tried to collect enough soul crystal to strengthen themselves.
<br><br>
"Elvinia, wait for me here," said Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's physical body was here, but his Soul of Light was still in the lower stage. If he wanted to enter the Soul City, he had to come with his Soul of Light. Elvinia had a natural advantage over him since her physical body was just similar to an "armor" which protected her soul on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was not as troublesome as Zen's body. Now that he had sent Elvinia here, he had to bring his Soul of Light up.
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded in response and waited.
<br><br>
It took some time for Zen's Soul of Light to arrive here from the lower stage. Without the protection of his physical body, Zen's Soul of Light, which was at the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, was relatively weak and he still had to pass through Stage Twenty-eight.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Element Spirit race paid most of their attention to his physical body, which was why they didn't do a strict inspection of the Souls of Light. What was more, it wouldn't be easy for them to recognize Zen's Soul of Light.
<br><br>
After safely crossing Stage Twenty-eight, Zen quickly came to Stage Twenty-nine, the Constant Glory Stage. He used the Blood Fog Spell to move forward. It took him more than half a day of non-stop journey to finally appear at the entrance of the Soul City and meet Elvinia.
<br><br>
The two of them continued to wait at the gate of the Soul City. A day later, more and more Souls of Light appeared at the gate.
<br><br>
They included members of the Separate Abyss race, the Azure Wolf race, the New Moon race, and the human race.
<br><br>
Souls of Light of all races had emerged.
<br><br>
The previously quiet square in front of the Soul City became noisy almost instantly.
<br><br>
"To enter the Soul City, you need reach the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. You will be courting death if you don't. I still have the soul crystal that I'm selling at a low price. Only three million soul pills per finger-size trunk." an Ear Mouse exclaimed, seizing the opportunity to sell its soul crystal.
<br><br>
Chapter 3713 The Soul Pillars A smile appeared on Zen's face when he heard the voice of the Ear Mouse hawking its soul crystal.
<br><br>
Normally, a finger-size chunk of soul crystal could be bought with one million soul pills. Now, however, these Ear Mice asked for three million.
<br><br>
Their greed was really insatiable.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Souls of Light crowding around the gate of the Soul City were in a hurry to pass the trial. If they really fell just a little short of the required level, they would most likely choose to pay three million soul pills.
<br><br>
Besides, the strong warriors who had reached this level must have a high status in their respective races, so they could afford so many soul pills.
<br><br>
After a while, the gate of the Soul City slowly opened.
<br><br>
The moment the gate opened, numerous faces of the Souls of Light appeared on the gate and let out incessant wails.
<br><br>
At the same time, a vast amount of soul auras flooded out of the city.
<br><br>
Zen had seen the auras of the Souls of Light of Eternal Realm masters, such as Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm. However, even the auras of Eternal Warriors could not be compared to those in front of him.
<br><br>
The Soul City was formed by trillions of souls after all.
<br><br>
"The gate is open!"
<br><br>
"I hope I can go further this time!"
<br><br>
"Every time I came, I always failed to move forward. I've been stuck in that step for years."
<br><br>
As soon as the gate was opened, it was immediately jammed with countless people trying to enter the city.
<br><br>
"Let's go in," said Zen.
<br><br>
He and Elvinia immediately followed the other Souls of Light into the Soul City.
<br><br>
The moment Zen set foot in the Soul City, he was immediately wrapped in the ubiquitous soul auras. Generally speaking, the soul aura could be seen as leaked consciousness, and consciousness itself could be said as one's deepest thought or desire. For example, when someone's desire to kill was strong, their soul aura would become extremely sharp, just like a sharpened knife.
<br><br>
A weak soul exposed to a murderous aura would feel very uncomfortable. If it was too weak, it would even be annihilated directly.
<br><br>
If it was a gentle aura, it could comfort the other party and even had the effect of repairing the soul.
<br><br>
There were countless souls in the Soul City, and each had their own consciousness, so the soul auras contained within were incomparably complicated. They had a very cumbersome impact on Zen.
<br><br>
He seemed to be able to listen to the thoughts of millions of people at the same time. Some of them were crying; some were drowned in sadness; some were feeling like outcasts; some were angry; some were bubbling with excitement; some others were filled with happiness.
<br><br>
Elvinia was also experiencing the same thing as Zen.
<br><br>
It was different from real hearing. Listening to these souls could not be gotten rid of, and they had to bear with it as long as they were in the Soul City. In fact, the test had already begun when they stepped into the Soul City.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen and Elvinia had already reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, so their souls were strong and very stable.
<br><br>
Not far from them, a Soul of Light casually walked into the Soul City.
<br><br>
Before long, however, he staggered. The pressure of the complex soul auras gradually increased as he went farther into the city, and he couldn't endure it. He tried to cover his ears to escape from the auras but to no avail.
<br><br>
Once the auras became too overbearing to bear, he finally let out a scream and used all his strength to rush out of the Soul City. He managed to step out of the Soul City right as his soul power was exhausted, but he soon fell on the ground, dying.
<br><br>
Many people in the city noticed this scene, and most of them had pity in their gazes.
<br><br>
"That guy is so bold."
<br><br>
"How dare he come to the Soul City before reaching the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul? It's courting death!"
<br><br>
"Fortunately, he still had the brain to escape when he couldn't hold on any longer. Otherwise, he would've become a part of the Soul City!"
<br><br>
After they walked in the Soul City for some time, some pillars appeared in front of them. The pillars were only half a person tall, and they could climb up by leaping. One after another, those who walked in the front started to leap onto the pillars and then sat cross-legged.
<br><br>
When Zen was sizing the pillars up, Elvinia said, "These are the soul pillars.
<br><br>
Let's go up too."
<br><br>
"Soul pillars?" Zen repeated curiously.
<br><br>
"Yes, the test in the Soul City is completed on top of these soul pillars. As long as you pass this test, you will have a Colorless Soul and reach the Holy Soul Realm," said Elvinia.
<br><br>
She got this information after rummaging through a number of books. As for what exactly they would experience on the soul pillars, she actually didn't really know.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. After finding an unoccupied soul pillar, he gently jumped up and then sat down on top of it with his legs crossed. Elvinia found a soul pillar beside Zen's and did the same.
<br><br>
After everyone sat down, numbers appeared on the soul pillars. Both Elvinia's and Zen's soul pillars showed "one", while that of the Soul of Light on Zen's right side showed "sixty-three". A number above 1, 300 even appeared on an occupied soul pillar quite a distance away.
<br><br>
While Zen looked around, Elvinia said, "These numbers should represent how many times we've entered the Soul City. It's our first time, so our soul pillars show 'one'."
<br><br>
"The number on that pillar is more than 1, 300, so the Soul of Light sitting on it has entered the Soul City for more than 1, 000 times?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Exactly," Elvinia answered with a nod.
<br><br>
After Zen sat on the soul pillar, it gave no response. Nevertheless, more and more Souls of Light entered the Soul City, and some humans also entered in groups.
<br><br>
A group of about six or seven people walked towards Elvinia upon entering the area of the soul pillars.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia!" someone shouted.
<br><br>
Just like the creatures on the Other Shore, Elvinia had a physical body in the Soul City, so her presence was very conspicuous. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace naturally noticed her at a glance.
<br><br>
Elvinia looked at the Soul of Light and asked, "Who are you?"
<br><br>
"My name is Gabriel," the man replied.
<br><br>
"I'm Carver," another man introduced himself.
<br><br>
"I'm Libby," a woman said.
<br><br>
These people were all disciples from the third floor. They were quite famous in the Oneness Sky Palace. Elvinia had naturally seen them before, but she wasn't too familiar with them. Now that they introduced themselves like this, she naturally knew who they were.
<br><br>
Elvinia smiled and said, "What a coincidence. I guess I'll make a breakthrough to the Holy Soul Realm along with you guys."
<br><br>
Entering the Soul City and reaching the Holy Soul Realm was never an easy task.
<br><br>
It was an extremely painful test for souls. Some people gave up after trying several times, unwilling to take this test again for the rest of their lives.
<br><br>
Those who could come to the Soul City for hundreds or thousands of times were the persistent ones.
<br><br>
It was the first time Elvinia had entered the Soul City. In the eyes of others, she was a mere newcomer.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, work hard," Gabriel encouraged.
<br><br>
Upon introducing herself, Libby looked at the soul pillar next to Elvinia's and asked, "Princess Elvinia, may I know who this man is?"
<br><br>
In fact, she already knew the answer. After the battle in the Oneness Sky Palace, she knew that Elvinia had a close relationship with Zen. The man who came to Stage Twenty-nine with Elvinia must be that powerful Zen.
<br><br>
"This is Zen," Elvinia replied curtly.
<br><br>
While Zen didn't return to the Land of Sword Grief after the battle with the Sun Crow race, the story of his deeds had undoubtedly spread to that place, turning him into a household name.
<br><br>
Before Goran went to the Dragon Cliff, he said in the Land of Sword Grief, "If it wasn't because our Oneness Sky Palace had Zen, the human race in the Bloom Divine Province would've been exterminated."
<br><br>
The significance of Zen's presence was self-evident.
<br><br>
Chapter 3714 Reading The Sanskrit Words Together with the other disciples of the third floor, Gabriel observed Zen's Soul of Light with utmost curiosity.
<br><br>
Considering Zen's Soul of Light alone, it might seem there was nothing absolutely remarkable about him.
<br><br>
After all, anyone who was able to enter the Soul City was obviously at the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. People like Gabriel and Carver had been staying at this level for a long time.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen and Elvinia who had just made it to Stage Twenty-nine were still considered as novices here.
<br><br>
However, Zen was a famous disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace. Almost everyone had heard of his name before.
<br><br>
Among the disciples in the entire Land of Sword Grief, Libby had seen the most of the battle against the Sun Crow race. Back then, she was a novice in the Oneness Array.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Gabriel and Carver only had the option to join the twelve passes and become Oneness Generals.
<br><br>
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Zen!"
<br><br>
"Nice to finally meet you!"
<br><br>
Gabriel, Carver, and the other disciples of the third floor all came forward, cupped their hands and bowed slightly as they greeted Zen. They all seemed too enthused.
<br><br>
With that, Zen also bowed slightly to them. "This is the very first time that Elvinia and I have entered the Soul City. Thus, we are very unfamiliar with this place. I hope you can lend us a hand," he said politely.
<br><br>
"No problem! It is safe to say that with your strength, it won't be that difficult to pass the test of the Soul City," replied Gabriel with a reassuring smile.
<br><br>
"Is that so? Well, that is quite flattering." Zen humbly accepted the compliment with a wave of his hand.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, his soul pillar flashed and began to vibrate slightly while he was still speaking.
<br><br>
Carver noticed this as well. So he said, "The soul pillars are about to ascend. Come, let's choose our own pillars!"
<br><br>
There were lots of soul pillars all over the entire Soul City. Many of the ones located behind Zen were not occupied. With a gentle leap, Carver, Gabriel, and the other disciples skillfully boarded the soul pillars and sat down cross legged.
<br><br>
The number on Libby's soul pillar was seventeen. This meant that she had already come to the Soul City for the seventeenth time. Carver's number was one hundred and ninety-eight, while Gabriel's was two hundred and thirty. The two of them had been to the Soul City many times before.
<br><br>
"With Zen's strength, it'll be very easy for him to pass the test of the Soul City, right?" Carver whispered to Gabriel.
<br><br>
Gabriel merely snorted at this. "As far as I know, he did not gain those great achievements in the battle against the Sun Crows because of his own strength. He only attained them because he received lots of help from some supreme masters!"
<br><br>
Being disciples on the third floor of the Land of Sword Grief, Gabriel and Carver felt extremely proud of themselves. Libby was the only person they admired within the entire place.
<br><br>
To be honest, they were quite uncomfortable with Zen's arrival.
<br><br>
Gabriel was the son of the Bright Mountain's leader. His father's death was a great blow to him. Needless to say, he did everything in his power to investigate what happened to his father. Therefore, he knew more about Zen's deeds than ordinary people.
<br><br>
"I see. It really was quite unthinkable that a man who didn't even pass the test of the Soul City could stand against the mighty warriors of the Sun Crow race. All of the people in the Oneness Sky Palace have even admired him as if he was a God. This will be too much for him," Carver said.
<br><br>
"Well, it's his first time to sit on the soul pillar. Judging from the looks of it, he doesn't even know what kind of test he is going to face. It'll be fun watching him make a fool of himself later." Gabriel smirked mockingly.
<br><br>
At this very moment, the soul pillars trembled once again. Slowly, they began to rise.
<br><br>
The soul pillar that Zen had sat on was rising as well. It gradually ascended by ten feet, twenty feet, thirty feet...
<br><br>
As soon as the soul pillars rose, a brown cloud started to press down from above the Soul City. The cloud seemed to contain a mix of countless souls and innumerable twisted faces that struggled and howled inside it.
<br><br>
The soul cloud continued pressing down as the soul pillars went up. The soul pressure became more and more intense as Zen continued to approach the cloud.
<br><br>
"Could this be the test of the Soul City?" Zen mumbled to himself with a frown.
<br><br>
He wondered whether merely dealing with the soul pressure was enough to strengthen one's own Soul of Light.
<br><br>
From the moment Zen began to cultivate his soul, he had felt no change yet.
<br><br>
Everyone's soul had reached a limit after reaching the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. Even if they absorbed more soul crystal, they still wouldn't be able to advance to a higher level.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen didn't believe that the test of the Soul City was to just deal with the soul pressure. There had to be a different trial hidden behind this.
<br><br>
The soul pillars had now ascended to fifty feet.
<br><br>
They rose to a hundred feet while the pressure kept rising.
<br><br>
Zen noticed that they were now nearing two hundred feet.
<br><br>
As soon as the soul pillars reached two hundred feet, they stopped. The soul cloud above also stopped descending. It hovered just ten feet away from all of the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
At this close distance, Zen could observe the soul cloud more clearly.
<br><br>
There were all sorts of strange faces and some sharp tiny crystals swirling within the cloud. These tiny crystals were the ones that reflected colorful lights from the soul cloud.
<br><br>
What were they supposed to do now? Were they going to enter the soul cloud? All of a sudden, they heard strange sounds coming from within the cloud just as Zen was pondering about what their next move should be.
<br><br>
At first, they sounded like unintelligible screams. However, they started to become even more peculiar now.
<br><br>
After listening to them for a while, Zen noticed something. The tones and pronunciation of the screams were becoming intensely rhythmic. Now, they sounded like a pleasant song! "Wait a second. It's a song?" Zen gazed at the cloud intently. His face registered a look of astonishment.
<br><br>
Realizing this, it gave him an utterly bizarre feeling. It felt like the cloud had taken the form of a young girl who was singing. However, this young girl didn't have a mouth so obviously, she wouldn't be able to sing.
<br><br>
Therefore, she was using the mouths of the souls in the cloud. She created a song by gathering lots of different sounds together.
<br><br>
At this point, the voice of the Primeval Lord of Heaven rang clearly once again. "Listen carefully, Zen. This song contains the comprehension of the Colorless Soul."
<br><br>
"The comprehension of the Colorless Soul is in the song?" Zen repeated as he stared incredulously at the soul cloud. "What shall I do? I can't understand it at all." Zen was evidently stunned.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at him and smiled. "Well, do you understand Sanskrit words?"
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Zen couldn't understand Sanskrit words either. He didn't have the incredible ability to decipher the Sanskrit words instantly just like Geoffrey. If he truly wanted to decipher the Sanskrit words methodically, it would definitely take him a very long time.
<br><br>
Coming out of his reverie, Zen had a sudden realization. "Do you mean to say that this song..." His voice trailed away as he waited for the answer.
<br><br>
"Yes, these are their voices." The Primeval Lord of Heaven confirmed what Zen had on his mind.
<br><br>
It was well-known that Sanskrit words were incomprehensible within the chaos.
<br><br>
If people really wanted to read and understand them, they had to decipher them first. However, this method was time-consuming.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Geoffrey had merely translated the Sanskrit words without even knowing how to read them.
<br><br>
In actuality, Sanskrit words could be read. However, there wasn't a single person in the chaos who could read Sanskrit words instantly.
<br><br>
"It turns out those Sanskrit words are read in such a strange and baffling way," Zen mused. He tilted his head to the side and listened carefully.
<br><br>
Based on his observation, there were times when the sounds were rising and falling in cadence and then suddenly becoming delicate and subtle. To him, they seemed like a poem or a song. They were like people scolding each other in the marketplace. They could only be understood mentally.
<br><br>
Therefore, they could not be described by mere words.
<br><br>
After listening closely for a while, Zen smiled bitterly. "How will I be able to cultivate the Colorless Soul and reach the Holy Soul Realm with this? I can't quite make sense of these chaotic and irregular sounds."
<br><br>
Chapter 3715 One Thousand Feet To Pass The Test "Listen carefully," the Primeval Lord of Heaven muttered in an urgent tone.
<br><br>
"Back then, I only entered Soul City three times before I was able to pass through. I was able to do that because of my comprehension of this song."
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened in astonishment. "You were able to pass through after just three tries?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven beamed with pride. "Of course!"
<br><br>
It was not difficult to pass the Soul City's test, but that didn't mean it was easy either. After all, only those who were able to reach Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore were able to enter the Soul City, which meant they had to have a certain level of talent and skill to be qualified.
<br><br>
Every third-floor disciple of the Land of Sword Grief like Gabriel, Carver, or Libby would also be considered a favored talent had they been part of any other super force in the Source World.
<br><br>
So long as they worked hard and tried their best, they would eventually pass the Soul City's test. The only variation was the length of time it took for them to succeed.
<br><br>
The fastest person in history to have passed through Soul City was the Grandmaster of Heaven, who was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's junior fellow disciple.
<br><br>
The two of them had entered the Soul City for the first time on the same day. The Primeval Lord of Heaven passed after three tries while the Grandmaster of Heaven was able to do it after two. This was the main reason why the Primeval Lord of Heaven always thought his fellow disciple was way more talented than him.
<br><br>
Their records remained unbroken even now.
<br><br>
The song lingered in Zen's ears and he no longer cared whether he understood the lyrics or not. Instead, he chose to close his eyes and listened closely.
<br><br>
Elvinia was also listening with a serene expression on her face as she sat cross-legged on another pillar.
<br><br>
Whilst everyone listened, a soul pillar began to rise. On top of this pillar was a member of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
This Separate Abyss member had a big build and looked somewhat funny on top of the pillar because of it. He had to carefully maintain his balance in order not to fall off.
<br><br>
Since he was the first to enter the soul cloud, everyone's attention was on him.
<br><br>
"That's Toby from the Separate Abyss race!"
<br><br>
"He is ascending so fast! Is he determined to pass the test this time?"
<br><br>
"Of course he is! He's already tried for more than one thousand three hundred times, right?" "Toby was a very promising member of the Separate Abyss race, but he's been stuck in Soul City for quite a while. His other race members laugh at him because he can't pass the test and the only way he'd get his prestige back is if he succeeds and passes through."
<br><br>
Zen's eyes also fell on the soul pillar as he heard everyone's discussion. As they said, the number displayed on the soul pillar was over one thousand three hundred.
<br><br>
As the soul pillar rose, Toby got closer and closer to the cloud. He let out a growl before finally entering it.
<br><br>
Numerous faces in the cloud rotated around the vortex where he entered.
<br><br>
As Toby disappeared into the soul cloud, another number showed up on his soul pillar.
<br><br>
Zen didn't need any explanation from Elvinia. He quickly understood that this new number indicated the height Toby was at in the soul cloud.
<br><br>
It seemed that after entering the soul cloud, Toby was able to rise in one go.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the number on the soul pillar continued to increase.
<br><br>
Ten feet...
<br><br>
Twenty feet...
<br><br>
Thirty feet...
<br><br>
Though it seemed as if his speed was slow, in the eyes of the Souls of Light in the Soul City, this feat was already impressive.
<br><br>
"Toby has indeed made progress!"
<br><br>
"He spent three seconds less on the first one hundred feet than last time!"
<br><br>
"It seems that the Separate Abyss race will be gaining one more powerful warrior in the thirty-second stage of the Other Shore Realm!"
<br><br>
It was a significant feat for one's Soul of Light to reach Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, but there was no way a warrior would be able to become an Eternal Warrior due to the absence of a corporeal body.
<br><br>
Flamine, Athemar, and Goran all fell into this category.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, nobody really hoped to become an Eternal Warrior. Everyone knew it was an impossible dream in this era.
<br><br>
One hundred feet...
<br><br>
Two hundred feet...
<br><br>
Five hundred feet...
<br><br>
The moment just before someone passed the test always garnered the most attention.
<br><br>
After all, the Soul City opened every few days and not that many people were eager to pass the test. During times like this, everyone focused on one specific warrior to see if he'd be able to succeed.
<br><br>
Not long after, the number on Toby's soul pillar broke through the nine hundred feet mark.
<br><br>
Nine hundred and fifty feet...
<br><br>
Nine hundred and sixty feet...
<br><br>
Nine hundred and seventy feet...
<br><br>
Nine hundred and eighty feet...
<br><br>
"He's about to reach nine hundred and ninety feet!"
<br><br>
"Last time he got to around nine hundred and eighty feet. There's only ten feet left!"
<br><br>
"Nine hundred and ninety! He's reached nine-hundred and ninety! Only ten feet left!"
<br><br>
Toby only needed ten more feet to reach his goal of achieving the Colorless Soul! Just as everyone waited in bated breath for the number to reach one thousand feet, the soul pillar shook.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
They watched as a figure, thirty feet tall, came crashing down through the soul cloud, and slammed heavily onto the ground.
<br><br>
Toby had failed yet again.
<br><br>
There was a series of disappointed sighs as they looked at his unmoving form.
<br><br>
"Alas, he was so close..."
<br><br>
"He reached nine hundred and ninety-five feet! He was so close!"
<br><br>
"Only five feet left, what a pity! He can only try again next time..."
<br><br>
Whenever the test started, everyone would be given only one chance to ascend. There was no getting back on a soul pillar to try again for that round.
<br><br>
The defeated Toby slowly got up and leaned against the soul pillar and cast a silent but sad look at the soul cloud above him.
<br><br>
He had failed for more than one thousand times, but he took it in stride.
<br><br>
Toby knew his own strength and that there was no way he'd be able to rise even half a foot more when he was up there. He'd have to work on himself more to pass the test sooner or later.
<br><br>
After Toby's initial failure, a few other Souls of Light began to drive their soul pillars up through the cloud. Others still eagerly listened to the song in hopes of an epiphany.
<br><br>
"There's no need to be nervous for your first try, Zen. Everyone fails the first time," Gabriel assured Zen.
<br><br>
Carver echoed his sentiment. "Yes. There's no need to be nervous. Besides, even if this is your first time I don't doubt for a second that your performance will be extraordinary!"
<br><br>
Being in the soul cloud wasn't a walk in the park. If one was not wellprepared, then he or she could end up in a miserable state.
<br><br>
Hearing their words, Elvinia, who had been listening attentively to the song, opened her eyes and gave them a frown.
<br><br>
She was just about to refute what they said when a voice suddenly spoke.
<br><br>
"Gabriel, Carver, what nonsense are you two spouting?!"
<br><br>
It was Libby. She turned to Zen and began to give him tips and warnings.
<br><br>
"Zen, the cloud is full of dangers. Don't be careless. You can't enter the soul cloud until you've comprehended the song to a certain degree. If you feel uncomfortable at any point, you can jump down. It won't matter if you fail.
<br><br>
Just don't ever force yourself to hold on!"
<br><br>
Libby's scolding was effective in zipping Gabriel's and Carver's mouths into silence.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in understanding at her warning and continued to listen to the song.
<br><br>
At the same time, Libby's soul pillar began to rise and send her up into the soul cloud.
<br><br>
It was only her seventeenth time here in the Soul City but the speed at which she rose was remarkable owing to her outstanding ability of comprehension.
<br><br>
Chapter 3716 The Holy Soul Imprint The last time she entered the Soul City, Libby had risen to a height of six hundred and twenty feet.
<br><br>
It was only her sixteenth time entering the Soul City, so being able to reach such a height was a big deal in the city. There were very few people like her, at least in the Source World. Naturally, she attracted a lot of attention in the Soul City.
<br><br>
Libby's rising speed was far from Toby's. She was careful the entire time, rising at a constant speed. Within five minutes, she had risen over a hundred feet.
<br><br>
After a few minutes, she was at six hundred feet.
<br><br>
Gabriel, Carver, and the rest paid close attention to Libby, nervously watching her soul pillar.
<br><br>
"This time, she may rise to a height of over seven hundred feet!"
<br><br>
"Maybe she can break the Oneness Sky Palace's record!"
<br><br>
"Look, she's broken her last record!"
<br><br>
After reaching the height of six hundred and twenty feet, Libby continued to rise. While she was somewhat slowing down, she still rose steadily and constantly.
<br><br>
When the soul pillar reached a height of seven hundred feet, it finally came to a stop.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A shadow descended from the soul cloud quickly, steadily landing on the ground.
<br><br>
Just as Libby had said to Zen, she never forced herself in the soul cloud. It was only natural that she wasn't as miserable as Toby when she landed.
<br><br>
"Libby, you've reached a height of seven hundred feet at the seventeenth attempt. You truly are the pride of our Oneness Sky Palace!" praised Gabriel.
<br><br>
"I'm flattered," Libby said flatly.
<br><br>
After all, she never gave much importance to the records; otherwise, she could have pushed her abilities further.
<br><br>
Just as the people of the Land of Sword Grief complimented her, an emotionless voice came from nearby. "The Oneness Sky Palace is proud of seven hundred feet? Interesting."
<br><br>
Everyone turned to the source of the voice. Standing on the soul pillar was a human Soul of Light. The soul pillar displayed the number eleven.
<br><br>
This indicated that the person had entered the Soul City eleven times.
<br><br>
"It's Dailey Ji from the Bearing race!"
<br><br>
"He is said to be the strongest talent of the Bearing race since its beginnings, someone with talent greater than the Yellow Thearch's!"
<br><br>
"It's said that the first time he entered the Soul City, he had risen to a height of seven hundred and ninety feet. At his tenth time, he's already reached nine hundred and fifty feet."
<br><br>
Regardless of what race they belonged to, so long as they were geniuses, they'd always attract much attention.
<br><br>
Dailey's words immediately attracted the Souls of Light's attention. He was the topic of conversation for both the human race and the other races in the Source World.
<br><br>
"What's the big deal? You haven't even reached a thousand feet yet. Even if you reach nine hundred and ninety feet, it's no different from ten. Before daring to mock it, you must go through the Soul City first," Gabriel retorted coldly.
<br><br>
Daily threw him an indifferent glance—he looked down upon the latter, someone who had entered the Soul City over two hundred times.
<br><br>
"One thousand feet?" With a faint smile, Dailey said, "It's easy to achieve the Colorless Soul. What I pursue is nothing like what you do. You don't understand anything!"
<br><br>
At that, Gabriel, Carver, and the non-human creatures were all left confused.
<br><br>
Those who entered the Soul City all pursued the Colorless Soul and the Holy Soul Realm. What else was Dailey pursuing? "Look, everyone, and the pride of the Oneness Sky Palace," Dailey called out with a smile as the soul pillar under his feet began to rise.
<br><br>
The pillar rose rapidly, as did its number.
<br><br>
One hundred feet.
<br><br>
Two hundred feet.
<br><br>
Three hundred feet.
<br><br>
In about thirty seconds, Dailey had risen to a height of over eight hundred feet before going straight to nine hundred.
<br><br>
"That is fast!"
<br><br>
"The soul cloud imposes no hindrance to him whatsoever…"
<br><br>
"It seems he can pass through the Soul City this time…"
<br><br>
Before the speaker could finish speaking, the number on Dailey's soul pillar revealed one thousand.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
When the number appeared, the entire dense soul cloud began emitting a faint light, indicating that Dailey had passed.
<br><br>
"I knew he could do it fast!"
<br><br>
"I'm so jealous. He can safely pass the Soul City and go to the upper stage on the Other Shore now."
<br><br>
"Eh? Wait, look..."
<br><br>
Normally, so long as people reached a thousand feet, they would be relieved before jumping down from their soul pillars. It was meaningless to remain there or continue going beyond the finish line, after all.
<br><br>
But as everyone gazed upon him, Dailey did not leave. Instead, he continued rising just as the number on the soul pillar continued increasing.
<br><br>
"What does Dailey want to do?"
<br><br>
"He wants to make a name for himself in the Soul City?"
<br><br>
"No, I heard a stronger level lies above the Holy Soul Realm, so long as we have the ability to continue to advance."
<br><br>
From the soul cloud, a light shot into the sky. Dailey sat upright on the soul pillar as he rushed out of the soul cloud and continued rising in the light.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, isn't the limit of the Soul City a thousand feet?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, looking at Dailey.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven chuckled and said, "For the vast majority of people, it's indeed a thousand feet. Crossing this height means one will obtain a Colorless Soul and reach the Holy Soul Realm. But do you remember I told you that the Holy Soul Realm is not the end?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded. He had indeed told him when they first met.
<br><br>
"When one achieves the Colorless Soul, they will have a chance to try and reach a higher level. There is only one chance of this. If one misses it, there will be no second chance. But most of them choose to give up because moving forward proves to be too difficult," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, looking at Dailey who was above the soul cloud. "He is an outstanding warrior of perception. He should be able to obtain a Holy Soul Imprint."
<br><br>
"A Holy Soul Imprint?" Zen asked, raising his brows.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "One imprint should be his limit."
<br><br>
Having already reached a thousand feet, Dailey found it difficult to go further.
<br><br>
The fact was now obvious to most.
<br><br>
While Dailey was indeed extraordinary, it wasn't easy for him to move upward in the light, let alone quickly.
<br><br>
An hour later, he had risen up to eighty feet, with the soul pillar showing a thousand and eighty feet.
<br><br>
Buzz! A golden imprint circled Dailey, attaching itself to the very surface of his soul. He then jumped down from the soul pillar and fell hard to the ground.
<br><br>
Although the crowd couldn't see Dailey's face clearly, they could still feel his great joy.
<br><br>
When he entered the Soul City for the eighth time, he already had the confidence to rise up to a thousand feet. For so long, he had prepared to reach his goal of the Holy Soul Imprint.
<br><br>
Chapter 3717 Nine Holy Soul Imprints Everyone stopped whatever they were doing, stunned by what just happened to Dailey.
<br><br>
Most of them were clueless of the Holy Soul Imprint to begin with.
<br><br>
When ordinary people reached one thousand feet, they would have met the end of their ropes. At this height, they wouldn't be able to hold on long, and their soul pillars wouldn't rise any more.
<br><br>
However, the world always had extraordinary warriors.
<br><br>
In the past, people already discovered that one thousand feet was not the farthest they could go. Once this height was met, the soul pillar could still rise if one possessed enough strength.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, there were a handful of creatures with extraordinary talents who attempted to push the envelope. Though one person would only have one chance, some of them finally obtained the Holy Soul Imprints.
<br><br>
"I can't believe that Dailey obtained a Holy Soul Imprint!"
<br><br>
"He truly is so great!"
<br><br>
"Wow, and it's been so long since I saw someone do that last time..."
<br><br>
People started chattering about Dailey's success.
<br><br>
Because those who were qualified to obtain a Holy Soul Imprint were so few, ordinary people forgot about it. Seeing Dailey do it, everyone was reminded about the imprint and in turn, shocked them.
<br><br>
As Dailey studied the Holy Soul Imprint on his chest, the corners of his lips turned up for a small smile.
<br><br>
"Congratulations, Dailey!"
<br><br>
"Another member of the Bearing race successfully obtained a Holy Soul Imprint!"
<br><br>
"Dailey, you surely have a bright future ahead of you!"
<br><br>
Just then, the Soul of Lights from the Bearing race also came up to congratulate him.
<br><br>
However, Libby stood a few meters away, looking not so pleased.
<br><br>
In the Oneness Sky Palace, she was the apple of everyone's eye, but in the Source World, she was not significant at all.
<br><br>
It was for this reason that she knew Dailey was a lot stronger than her in everything.
<br><br>
"Big deal."
<br><br>
Gabriel snorted, annoyed with the situation. He sat on his soul pillar, which was found deep into the soul cloud. Behind him followed Carver, who rose into the cloud very gracefully.
<br><br>
The two often came to the Soul City to test their strength, so they knew their limits quite well.
<br><br>
Once he reached five hundred and sixty feet, Gabriel stood up and leaped off his soul pillar. Carver on the other hand, reached six hundred feet, which was five feet higher than his previous record. Such small progress was still success to him.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, what exactly is the Holy Soul Imprint?" Zen asked politely.
<br><br>
"Think of it as a symbol of surpassing the limit of the Holy Soul Realm,"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered, "The benefits are self-explanatory.
<br><br>
For warriors, it would make them stronger than others who have only reached the Holy Soul Realm. Moreover, it would bring them an additional advantage if they manage to reach the Eternal Realm, because they are stronger than ordinary Eternal Warriors."
<br><br>
"How many Holy Soul Imprints did you retrieve, sir?" Zen continued to question.
<br><br>
"Seven," the Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled. "The first Holy Soul Imprint is the Blazing Fire Imprint, which the young man from the Bearing race has just obtained. The second is the Myriad Lives Imprint, followed by the Lifeless Imprint, and the fourth... Overall, there are nine Holy Soul Imprints. If one obtained all, they would achieve a Nine-Imprint Holy Soul.
<br><br>
That means the limit of the soul pillar is one thousand seven hundred and twenty feet high. So far, no one has been able to go high enough to obtain the last one."
<br><br>
"You haven't obtained all, sir?" Zen was shocked to hear this, especially since the Primeval Lord of Heaven was so powerful.
<br><br>
In the same moment, the Regal Jade Spirit who happened to listen in on their conversation, couldn't help but join in, "The Wing King of our Regal Jade Civilization only obtained five Holy Soul Imprints." The spirit exalted, "Primeval Lord of Heaven, you are amazing to have seven of them!"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head, "Still, obtaining more makes no difference. I still failed to complete the Finale Way."
<br><br>
As soon as the Primeval Lord of Heaven finished speaking, Elvinia's eyes widened with excitement, "I seem to have some comprehension. Zen, I'll try it out first."
<br><br>
Suddenly, the soul pillar below Elvinia rose up and took her to the cloud.
<br><br>
As she disappeared into the sky, her body appeared like a vague silhouette.
<br><br>
Compared to Libby, Toby, and Dailey, Elvinia was not interested in drawing attention. After all, she was new to the Soul City, so people would have doubted her abilities anyway.
<br><br>
However, the longer she remained in the soul cloud, the more people noticed her.
<br><br>
"This is the first time the human woman in her physical form took her test! She seems to have surpassed five hundred feet!"
<br><br>
"That's awesome!"
<br><br>
"I think it's the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. If that is true, her talent is not even a surprise."
<br><br>
As Libby and Dailey watched from below, they looked closely at Elvinia's soul pillar.
<br><br>
For a new-comer, five hundred feet in one go was surprising.
<br><br>
Eventually, the number on Elvinia's soul pillar came to a stop at six hundred and seventy. It seemed that her first performance surpassed Libby's and Dailey's past tries.
<br><br>
As for Gabriel, Carver and the others, they couldn't help but feel somehow depressed.
<br><br>
Though Elvinia was Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter, they couldn't accept inferiority to her easily.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Within minutes, Elvinia descended from the soul cloud and landed gently on the ground without a sound.
<br><br>
The soul cloud made her feel solid, as if her soul materialized inside her physical form.
<br><br>
"Zen, it's your turn now!" Elvinia giddily said.
<br><br>
There was no doubt she was proud of what she'd done.
<br><br>
While the rest looked at Zen in contempt, Elvinia was worried about other things. She was afraid that Zen's performance would surpass hers by too much.
<br><br>
Because if Zen passed through the Soul City right there and then, she realized that she'd have to spend a handful of years here without him by her side.
<br><br>
Zen rested on his pillar and nodded at Elvinia. With one thought in his mind, his soul pillar began to rise slowly and took him to the sky.
<br><br>
The minute he entered the soul cloud, he sensed tides rushing towards his Soul of Light. Meanwhile, ghost faces hid within the tides, all biting at Zen with ferocity.
<br><br>
For some reason, Zen was unharmed by their bites. It came to a point that the ghost faces left without harming him.
<br><br>
The longer he remained in the soul cloud, the more confused he got.
<br><br>
In the past, Zen went through countless trials and tribulations that he was not shocked with them anymore. He'd suffered in all aspects, whether mentally or physically. In each test, he always came out stronger than ever.
<br><br>
This was the first time all he had to do was sit. He had never been through such a peaceful test.
<br><br>
Once the ghost faces stopped, Zen opened his eyes to see something odd - his soul pillar didn't rise by even an inch! At this point, the Souls of Light under the soul cloud paid attention to him and began to giggle in mockery.
<br><br>
"The poor guy didn't comprehend even a little! That's funny!"
<br><br>
"Is he the kind of Soul of Light that can never turn into a Colorless Soul?"
<br><br>
"I've heard that some Souls of Light can't achieve the Colorless Soul, so they can't advance even an inch in the soul cloud. That rarely happens though." People were laughing and confused at the same time.
<br><br>
For some reason, the number on his pillar never advanced. How was this possible? Chapter 3718 Nine-Imprint Holy Soul Inside the quiet confines of the soul cloud was Zen, who was still quite confused.
<br><br>
It wasn't only him, however. Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven was baffled as well.
<br><br>
The truth was that he had indeed planned to help Zen pass through the Soul City.
<br><br>
Not only that, but he also wanted to help Zen obtain nine Holy Soul Imprints.
<br><br>
Even though more than a thousand chaotic eras had passed, he still clearly remembered when he had obtained the seven Holy Soul Imprints, he had faintly seen that there seemed to be something else on top of the light column.
<br><br>
He didn't know what that was, but he guessed that it might have something to do with the Instant Civilization from the beginning.
<br><br>
Everything about the Instant Civilization greatly piqued his interest.
<br><br>
However, it was extremely difficult to obtain nine Holy Soul Imprints.
<br><br>
Despite so many chaotic eras that had passed, the highest record was still eight Holy Soul Imprints.
<br><br>
He thought that it was the first time that Zen had entered the soul cloud, so it would be better if he could take some time to adapt to the whole thing.
<br><br>
Therefore, he planned to teach Zen about his experience after the latter returned from the soul cloud.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen had remained motionless after he entered the soul cloud. That was why the Primeval Lord of Heaven was so confused. "Zen, what's wrong with you?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"These things from the soul cloud don't seem to affect me at all, and it looks like I can't drive the soul pillar up either," said Zen.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes slightly widened at Zen's words. "It's impossible…" he muttered.
<br><br>
In general, one had to repeatedly replace the Soul of Light to achieve the Colorless Soul.
<br><br>
The "colorless" indicated the world of materials. A person's soul was born with seven emotions and six desires. Those seven emotions and six desires were constantly replaced when the "faces" in the soul cloud devoured one's soul.
<br><br>
For instance, Zen would constantly forget something but also obtain something during the whole process.
<br><br>
Only after he had forgotten everything could his Soul of Light be reborn and become a real Colorless Soul. By then, his Soul of Light would be in the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
At that point, the Soul of Light that turned into a Colorless Soul would've undergone some drastic changes.
<br><br>
The soul cloud looked like a chaotic mass to ordinary people, but in reality, it could be divided into different layers, and each layer could replace the Soul of Light to a different extent.
<br><br>
That was why no matter how weak Zen's talent was, such a situation could never happen. "Is it possible that you have repelled the Colorless Soul?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked cautiously.
<br><br>
If so, then Zen might not be able to pass through the Soul City, and let alone become an Eternal Warrior.
<br><br>
"Repel..."
<br><br>
Zen reached out towards those "faces," and they kept biting him like mad.
<br><br>
The rhythmic song echoed throughout the soul cloud.
<br><br>
He still couldn't understand what it meant, but he suddenly felt a strange sensation surge deep in his soul.
<br><br>
"What… They…want to bestow me?" he said out of the blue. He saw the cloud as a whole, but those "faces" inside the soul cloud were separate individuals.
<br><br>
Still, the feeling he had in his soul was accurate.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
As the faces continued to bite, the purple light inside Zen's Soul of Light began to quickly peel off. It was as if his soul was divided and eaten, then a completely transparent soul had replaced it.
<br><br>
When the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw what happened, he couldn't help but be stunned. "What? The replacement is all done?"
<br><br>
The entire soul cloud raged like a storm. Even the people below like Toby, Libby, and Dailey all clearly saw that the faces had gathered in one place, then finally assembled at the soul pillar where Zen sat.
<br><br>
There were many other Souls of Light that entered the soul cloud at the same time as Zen. Those Souls of Light all rose at varying rates, but when those "faces" rushed towards Zen, there was no face that helped them replace their souls. Their soul pillars also stopped rising. They were all shocked and didn't know what was going on.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Why did all those faces gather at Zen's spot?"
<br><br>
"I've never heard of this situation before…"
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Dailey just observed everything with vigilance.
<br><br>
It could be said that the twenty-ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm was the starting point of another level. To put it simply, the powerful warriors who were on this level now would probably compete with each other in the future.
<br><br>
Of course, Dailey refused to watch such an abnormal scene.
<br><br>
"It seems a little different," Elvinia said with a smile. Although she didn't know what had happened either, she had great confidence in Zen.
<br><br>
Those faces gathered for quite a while before they immediately dispersed.
<br><br>
Then, Zen's Soul of Light became completely transparent. "What happened?" Zen asked in surprise.
<br><br>
He looked at his own hands in confusion. He was really afraid that he would disappear! "You've now achieved the Colorless Soul," the Primeval Lord of Heaven stated. "Don't I have to go up?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"It seems that is unnecessary now. Those faces came down at their own will. Ha-ha!" In reality, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was secretly quite surprised. Those faces that were raised inside the soul cloud devoured seven emotions and six desires as usual, but no one had ever had the same experience as Zen.
<br><br>
"But if I achieve the Colorless Soul in this way, I won't be able to obtain any Holy Soul Imprint, right?" Zen asked again. The Primeval Lord of Heaven was startled when Zen mentioned the Holy Soul Imprint.
<br><br>
After one had attained the Colorless Soul, they only had one chance to obtain the Holy Soul Imprints.
<br><br>
That chance was certainly not easy to miss. Now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven never expected that Zen had entered the Holy Soul Realm in this way. He was so confused and his mind was a mess.
<br><br>
Soon enough, however, he decided, "Don't leave the soul cloud. Go upward!"
<br><br>
But even Zen himself wasn't sure if he could drive the soul pillar. At the very least, the soul pillar didn't react when he tried to drive it just now.
<br><br>
As soon as he heard what the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, he thought for a moment and pulled the soul pillar upward once again.
<br><br>
This time, the soul pillar finally moved.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
From the crowd's point of view, those "faces" suddenly swarmed towards Zen and abruptly left in flocks. They were completely confused.
<br><br>
Just then, the soul pillar began to rise rapidly.
<br><br>
One hundred feet...
<br><br>
Three hundred feet...
<br><br>
Nine hundred feet...
<br><br>
One thousand feet...
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
As the light column on top of the soul cloud rose, Zen's figure also appeared.
<br><br>
At that moment, he was still climbing up with the soul pillar under his feet.
<br><br>
Once he had crossed a distance of one thousand and eighty feet, a golden Holy Soul Imprint was already engraved on his chest.
<br><br>
As soon as the golden imprint appeared, however, Zen still continued to climb upwards.
<br><br>
When he had crossed one thousand one hundred and sixty feet, he received the second Holy Soul Imprint.
<br><br>
One thousand two hundred and forty feet...
<br><br>
One thousand...
<br><br>
The Holy Soul Imprints imprinted themselves on his body one after another.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elvinia watched him from under the soul cloud with her hand over her mouth. She was speechless.
<br><br>
Aside from Elvinia, all the others were similarly astonished and surprised as well.
<br><br>
Dailey, in particular, trembled every time a Holy Soul Imprint appeared on the surface of Zen's body.
<br><br>
To obtain only one Holy Soul Imprint was considered the easiest, but only Dailey knew how much he had suffered just to get that one coveted Holy Soul Imprint.
<br><br>
Chapter 3719 A Cabin With A Spire To reach the Colorless Soul was still a hard task for a Soul of Light who had reached the twenty-eighth stage of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
However, if given enough time, they still might be able to do it.
<br><br>
Still, it usually took a huge deal of effort to obtain the Holy Soul Imprints.
<br><br>
After all, every second inside the light column was no better than swimming in hot magma.
<br><br>
It had already been a matter of life and death for Dailey to just hold on until the first imprint appeared. However, it seemed so easy for Zen to obtain those imprints! Of course, he found it hard to accept this.
<br><br>
It wasn't only Dailey who felt depressed, everyone present couldn't keep calm as well.
<br><br>
For instance, Gabriel had previously encouraged Zen in hopes of teaching him a lesson, but he never thought that Zen could cross the soul cloud and enter the light column above.
<br><br>
"Blazing Fire Imprint!"
<br><br>
"Myriad Lives Imprint!"
<br><br>
"Lifeless Imprint!"
<br><br>
"Myriad Ghosts Imprint!"
<br><br>
"Myriad Ways Imprint!"
<br><br>
"No Three Imprint!"
<br><br>
"Earth Moving Imprint!"
<br><br>
"Returning Sky Imprint!"
<br><br>
The first eight Holy Soul Imprints hit the surface of Zen's soul one by one.
<br><br>
There was one on his chest, one on his elixir field, two on his shoulders, one on his forehead, and two on his waist.
<br><br>
When Zen had obtained eight Holy Soul Imprints, the rising soul pillar under his feet suddenly stopped.
<br><br>
Still confused, Zen asked, "What's going on?"
<br><br>
"I don't know either," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
It was known that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had a deep understanding of the Other Shore, and perhaps there were few people who knew some things he didn't.
<br><br>
However, Zen's problem now was truly beyond his comprehension.
<br><br>
He repeatedly tried to figure out what was wrong during the whole process.
<br><br>
He also knew Zen's origins quite well. After all, he had also created the SixPattern Blood-storing Tree, and the only variable in Zen's growth was probably his special physical body and the Primal Chaos Technique. But even so, those two shouldn't have much to do with the Soul City.
<br><br>
Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't figure out what the problem was, Zen didn't bother to think about it.
<br><br>
In any case, the soul pillar didn't rise or fall, so he looked around to observe the surrounding environment instead.
<br><br>
From his point of view, he could see the whole Soul City.
<br><br>
There was a circular area within the city, and the soul pillars were equally distributed inside it. A group of greyish-brown buildings that were only made of souls were located far away from the soul pillars.
<br><br>
The buildings and houses in the Soul City were all inaccessible. Some Souls of Light had managed to enter, but they never came out of them. It was said that they had turned into a part of the Soul City, and since then, no one ever dared to explore those houses anymore.
<br><br>
Now, the Souls of Light just came to the city and reached the Holy Soul Realm, then left in a hurry.
<br><br>
However, that cabin on top of the Soul City still caught the attention of many Souls of Light.
<br><br>
This cabin had a spire and a small window on one side. Every time the gates of the Soul City opened, a faint yellow candle light shone through the window.
<br><br>
Because the candlelight always lit up once the city's gates opened, many Souls of Light believed that there must be creatures that lived inside that cabin.
<br><br>
However, no one had ever set foot in that cabin.
<br><br>
Even the Element Spirit race, which dominated the Other Shore for the longest time, had never been inside it! In fact, the cabin was so mysterious that the Element Spirit race had tried to go in during the second and third chaotic eras.
<br><br>
To see what was inside, the Element Spirit race had once invited the "Ghost Head" from Stage Thirty-three to come down. That was the strongest Other Shore creature the Element Spirit race had invited.
<br><br>
After the Ghost Head had entered the cabin, it completely disappeared ever since.
<br><br>
At that time, the soul cloud had also devoured all the Souls of Light in the Soul City.
<br><br>
Since then, the Element Spirit race never tried to go inside that cabin again.
<br><br>
Five minutes had passed since Zen's soul pillar stayed. Then, the light became brighter, and all the golden lights seemed to gather and form an entity.
<br><br>
When viewed from afar, the light pillar continued to condense and almost turned into a solid golden column that tightly enclosed Zen.
<br><br>
The Soul City and faces in the soul cloud originally made various kinds of sounds.
<br><br>
But after the golden column appeared, the whole Soul City immediately became quiet.
<br><br>
The song that rang continuously also stopped.
<br><br>
Everything was silent but it felt uneasy, so all the Souls of Light that were present became vigilant.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Souls of Light who were still in the soul cloud chose to give up and jumped down from the soul pillars. Then, they looked at the scene above in shock.
<br><br>
Crack! The soul pillar under Zen's feet trembled and began to rise slowly again.
<br><br>
Zen, who remained nonchalant the whole time, finally began to feel a lot of pain.
<br><br>
When the golden column was fully formed, it thoroughly wrapped Zen within.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen couldn't move or see anything. It seemed that he had become a part of the golden column.
<br><br>
When the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw that Zen was about to ask something, he immediately uttered, "Stop asking. Let's wait and see!"
<br><br>
Although the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't know what that was, he was actually quite excited. He realized that Zen had a chance to ascend to the top. Even though everything came so suddenly and was even hard to understand, things seemed to go in a way he had expected.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before a number of 1, 720 feet appeared on Zen's soul pillar.
<br><br>
At that point, the solid golden column that wrapped Zen suddenly collapsed, and the material of the column repeatedly shattered, peeled off, and fell into the soul cloud from above.
<br><br>
When those "faces" saw the broken pieces fall, they swarmed towards them like a school of fish in the pond and desperately scrambled for those fragments.
<br><br>
While the golden column continued to peel off, Zen's Soul of Light slowly appeared, then the ninth Holy Soul Imprint fell on his head.
<br><br>
"Power Guide Imprint!"
<br><br>
Zen stood on the surface of the soul pillar, straightened his waist, and breathed slightly.
<br><br>
The nine Holy Soul Imprints in his soul outlined golden meridians that were distributed the same way as his body's meridians.
<br><br>
As he exhaled, the golden meridians turned from light to dark, then from dark to light.
<br><br>
Even though his soul had reached the Holy Soul Realm and had almost the same strength as his physical body, it was still a soul.
<br><br>
At that moment, however, his soul underwent a qualitative change.
<br><br>
The nine Holy Soul Imprints formed a large circulation, and made his soul a different life! "What's this?" Zen asked when he saw a small copper ring float in front of him.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at the copper ring with interest.
<br><br>
He had seen it before when he obtained the seventh imprint.
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his hand and gently pulled the copper ring, which caused the entire Soul City to shake.
<br><br>
A huge gear wheel on the right side of the Soul City rolled slowly and continuously released the chain made of souls.
<br><br>
A chain bridge, which was originally hidden inside the wall, descended slowly and extended towards Zen. The bridge led to that cabin with a spire! Chapter 3720 Chain Bridge Light streamed out from the window of the cabin.
<br><br>
However, despite that the cabin was illuminated by the candlelight, one couldn't see anything through the window with just their naked eyes.
<br><br>
As the chain bridge came down from the opposite side of the soul pillars, the opportunity of exploring the secret in the cabin that remained unknown for over a thousand chaotic eras finally presented itself.
<br><br>
"Go ahead, Zen," the Primeval Lord of Heaven coaxed. "Perhaps you have obtained a chance to face them."
<br><br>
Staring at the chain bridge before him, Zen hesitated.
<br><br>
To be honest, the only reason why he was exploring the Soul City was to reach the Holy Soul Realm. Now that he had achieved his goal, he had a chance to turn back.
<br><br>
Yet, something tugged at him from the back of his mind. He carried the book of the human race, after all. He was the only hope of the human race.
<br><br>
In a sense, he didn't have the right to give up the opportunity to explore the secret.
<br><br>
"Who are 'they'?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"The civilization that built the Soul City," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered.
<br><br>
Zen's heart skipped a beat. "Is this the civilization that never existed?"
<br><br>
"Never existed? Who told you that?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven raised his eyebrow slightly, feeling a bit stunned.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess," Zen replied. "Actually, to be precise, the avatar of her."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled faintly. "Snake Goddess thought too highly of herself. The Soul City, the Land of Bone Tribulation, and the Eternal Scroll Painting are the proofs of the existence of the Instant Civilization. No matter how powerful the Element Spirit race is, it's impossible for them to create these things. In fact, they would try every way to destroy them first if they have the chance!"
<br><br>
If the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation were completely destroyed, no one else would be able to enter the Eternal Realm. As the forerunners, the Element Spirit race could have prevented others from becoming stronger than them by simply destroying the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation. Obviously, they had every reason wanting to destroy them.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, they hadn't succeeded. Despite trying more than once, they couldn't seem to completely destroy them. Helplessly, they had no choice but to watch as the Other Shore creatures and the Souls of Light came and went through the Soul City freely.
<br><br>
"Then... Are you saying there are remnants of the Instant Civilization inside that house?" Zen's interest was finally piqued.
<br><br>
"We will only know after you enter and have a look," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with a smile.
<br><br>
Zen nodded.
<br><br>
Without further hesitation, he took a step forward--right onto the chain bridge.
<br><br>
Because his Soul of Light had changed, the way he perceived the world felt different. This new Colorless Soul felt like a newborn beast that had just emerged from its shell. Whenever it touched anything, it felt novel and soft.
<br><br>
Just as Zen stepped on the chain bridge, something suddenly rushed over from the entrance of the Soul City.
<br><br>
It was clear as crystal, as though it were made of sculpted ice. It seemed to have a form, but Zen couldn't tell for sure as it kept morphing into different shapes as it rushed over. At this moment, it had turned into a pair of wings, flying towards the soul cloud.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
It was astonishingly fast. Before Zen even had the time to blink, it had stepped onto the bridge.
<br><br>
Zen watched it head straight towards the building on the other side of the bridge. He noticed that when it had rushed for a certain distance, dots of orange light appeared on the chain bridge.
<br><br>
One by one, the dots of light stuck to the surface of its crystal clear body.
<br><br>
The figure started to struggle, as though each orange dot was a hand that pulled at it.
<br><br>
The crystal clear thing kept trying to shrug off the orange dots of light, but soon, it could barely even budge.
<br><br>
Gradually, the icy body melted into a pool of blue liquid that flowed along the chain bridge.
<br><br>
"What's that?" Zen finally asked, as he watched the pool of blue liquid trickle down the sides of the bridge.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven sneered. "It is a Chill Ice Slave."
<br><br>
"It's from the Element Spirit race?" Zen raised an eyebrow in curiosity.
<br><br>
"Yes, they are stronger than the Moon Fire Slaves."
<br><br>
In the past, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had slain countless Moon Fire Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves-- however, he had struggled slightly more with the latter.
<br><br>
The bodies of the Chill Ice Slaves were ever-changing. Additionally, they were much stronger than the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
The Soul City was important. Naturally, the Element Spirit race kept a close eye on it. After Zen had caused all the strange things to happen, the Element Spirit race was immediately alerted.
<br><br>
The instant the Element Spirit race found out the chain bridge had been put down, they wanted to seize the opportunity to explore the secret. They too wanted to know what was within the cabin.
<br><br>
However, they had failed in their efforts.
<br><br>
Zen gingerly took another step forward, then another, and another. After a few more steps, the dots of orange light appeared once more.
<br><br>
Now that Zen could see the light dots up close, he noticed they were irregularly shaped. Some were circular and some were in diamond shape, looking like orange petals floating in the air.
<br><br>
As Zen saw these light dots approaching him, he furrowed his brows.
<br><br>
Just now, the Chill Ice Slave was killed by the orange light dots. Naturally, he didn't want to experience the same fate.
<br><br>
But these orange light dots were too densely packed together, there was no possible way Zen could pass through safely.
<br><br>
"Da..."
<br><br>
Just as Zen hesitated, an orange petal landed gently on his arm. Zen jerked back by instinct, but the petal had already latched onto his arm.
<br><br>
To his surprise, the orange petal didn't hurt. In fact, it seemed his skin just absorbed it. After touching the golden meridians in his arm, the orange petal merged into his body and became a part of his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, Zen felt a trace of warmth emanating from his arm, specifically the spot where the petal landed.
<br><br>
"These...things won't hurt me?" Zen asked, thoroughly perplexed.
<br><br>
"Of course." The Primeval Lord of Heaven chuckled softly. "After all, you got nine Holy Soul Imprints and activated this chain bridge. How could the Instant civilization make the mistake of hurting you?"
<br><br>
His eyes twinkled. In the Primeval Lord of Heaven's mind, the Instant Civilization was the chief designer of this entire world.
<br><br>
Time, space, truth, Godly Ways, and any laws--these were all designed by the Instant Civilization, a magical race that never made mistakes.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. Then, he proceeded to cross the chain bridge with ease.
<br><br>
The orange petals of light did no harm to Zen. On the contrary, they nourished his soul like a warm embrace. As Zen walked through the dense cloud of orange petals, he raised his arms to let his Soul of Light absorb them.
<br><br>
The chain bridge was only a few thousand feet long. It wasn't long before Zen arrived at the end of the bridge. Taking a deep breath, he stepped off the bridge and onto the path that led to the cabin with a spire.
<br><br>
It was only then he realized that the buildings in the Soul City were built quite strangely. The entrances were quite narrow. If the creatures of the Instant Civilization had forms, they must've been very thin...
<br><br>
However, after a few more steps, the path gradually widened.
<br><br>
Carvings decorated the sides of the steps, but they were of neither beasts nor scenery. The carvings were quite abstract, showing only shapes from squares to circles to triangles, and so on.
<br><br>
There seemed to be rich notes around these shapes. Upon a closer look, Zen realized these were fist-sized Sanskrit words that seemed to be explaining the connection between these shapes.
<br><br>
Zen surveyed his surroundings. However, he couldn't decipher the Sanskrit words. He was about to keep moving forward when the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly stopped him.
<br><br>
"Zen, wait for a moment. I want to study these intricate carvings..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven was extremely interested in these carvings and Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Chapter 3721 The Door Closed Zen had made it here, so he was in no hurry. Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven now wished to observe and study, he would let him do so.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had lived for over a thousand chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Although he was not as skilled at deciphering Sanskrit words as Geoffrey, his attainments in Sanskrit words were still notable.
<br><br>
As long as the words weren't too complicated, he would have little trouble reading them.
<br><br>
The carvings contained many secrets of the inner workings of the world and while he pondered over them, he seemed to have resolved many doubts he held in his heart.
<br><br>
There were some things he didn't know or couldn't understand before, but he was able to find them on the carvings on both sides of the path.
<br><br>
"I see...
<br><br>
I did not expect that!"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed in a number of strange ways, while Zen slowly moved forward.
<br><br>
As he moved further and the patterns on the walls turned more complex, the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed less, simply because they were too complicated for him to understand.
<br><br>
Eventually, the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, "Hurry up. I can't understand any of them anymore."
<br><br>
In this world, the unknown always outweighed the known.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and sped up.
<br><br>
Beneath the soul cloud, all the Souls of Light stretched their necks, watching Zen's every move.
<br><br>
What took place had nothing to do with them, but once they left the Soul City, they would most definitely report in great detail the events that transpired.
<br><br>
"So many years have passed, and finally someone is able to enter that cabin!"
<br><br>
"Will he be able to come back?"
<br><br>
"Zen, be careful..."
<br><br>
Some were jealous, some were envious, and some even cursed under their breath.
<br><br>
Elvinia though, was a little worried.
<br><br>
She had heard of the origin of the Soul City, but she had never thought that Zen would be able to reach its top.
<br><br>
Zen took a few more steps and an exquisite wide square with all sorts of obscure patterns around it, hanging in the air, came into view.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven could not understand them but this did not stop Zen. He passed through the hanging square and a small ladder was placed in front of him. Above the ladder was the door to the cabin with a spire.
<br><br>
Zen climbed the ladder and at the top, saw a wooden gray door.
<br><br>
"This door... is not made of souls?" Zen muttered, raising his eyebrows in confusion.
<br><br>
Everything in the Soul City was constructed from the souls; buildings, floors, walls, ladders, and so on.
<br><br>
However, the door of the cabin was different. It was just an ordinary wooden door. It seemed the door had been there a long time as the entire thing looked gray.
<br><br>
A small iron ring hung on the left side of the door. Zen stretched his hand out and gently knocked it against the door.
<br><br>
But the knock did not ring out...
<br><br>
Zen felt something soft in his hand, and the iron ring had already been embedded in the door. It appeared to be made of dust. After a gentle touch, it collapsed into a cloud of dust drowning Zen beneath it.
<br><br>
Gradually, the dust dissipated.
<br><br>
Zen still held the iron ring in his hand as he peered into the cabin.
<br><br>
The interior was decorated very simply; the walls were plastered with gravel and the floor was covered with a gray blanket. In the center of the blanket stood a small wooden table with a little golden pot atop it.
<br><br>
A wisp of pale yellow flame flickered at the opening of the pot, illuminating the cabin.
<br><br>
Zen stepped on the blanket and it puffed into another cloud of dust.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
It was not just the blanket but the table as well that had collapsed into dust at the slightest contact.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The golden pot fell to the floor with a solid thud and the flame was extinguished.
<br><br>
The flame died out and the light in the room dimmed. At the same time, the light throughout the entire Soul City began dimming as well.
<br><br>
"Hoo..."
<br><br>
Soul faces began appearing one by one on the walls around the Soul City! Some faces looked like humans and the souls appeared in human form.
<br><br>
Some appeared as strange beasts, some had slender bodies, some were flat, some were jagged...
<br><br>
For a moment, all sorts of strange souls floated around the Soul City.
<br><br>
"Awoo..."
<br><br>
They rushed out of the wall and soon found that this time was a little different. In the center of the Soul City, there seemed to be a large number of Souls of Light near the soul pillar! These Souls of Light were still alive and were the most delicious living creatures they had ever seen! "Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."
<br><br>
For a moment, the souls rushed crazily at the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
"Where did these things come from?" Dailey asked, caution growing within him.
<br><br>
A few brown souls rushed over. He stretched his hand out and began slashing it out.
<br><br>
"Soul Whipping Skill!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, his five fingers elongated and turned into five slender whips, lashing forward.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
All the souls shattered with a thunderous clap.
<br><br>
Those who could reach Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore all possessed Indigo Souls of the ultimate level. They all fought back at the souls rushing at them.
<br><br>
As for Elvinia, she had no trouble at all destroying those souls charging at her.
<br><br>
Any souls that dared approach her were swiftly smashed to powder by her gentle palm strike.
<br><br>
When they had rushed out of the wall, the door at the entrance of the Soul City had rumbled like an earthquake! "Is the door to the Soul City closing?"
<br><br>
"What's going on! Why is it closing so early?"
<br><br>
"Get out of the Soul City right now!"
<br><br>
All the Soul City's terrible legends came to everyone's mind.
<br><br>
The front door to the Soul City was about to close and they were still a ways away from it.
<br><br>
"Hoo, hoo..."
<br><br>
Just then, countless souls rushed out of the soul cloud, their surfaces faintly coated in gold. The aura they emitted was quite obviously much stronger than that of the other souls.
<br><br>
One of the members of the Separate Abyss race stood right below the soul cloud. He was swallowed by a large fish-shaped golden soul before he even had the time to react.
<br><br>
His miserable screams echoed from the belly of the giant fish, but soon after disappeared...
<br><br>
"Anson has been eaten by that big fish!" Toby roared.
<br><br>
The others of the Separate Abyss race all cried in horror as well.
<br><br>
It was then that the door to Soul City shut completely with a monstrous bang.
<br><br>
Chapter 3722 Dreaded Eyes Each time the gates to the Soul City were closed, the souls imprisoned in the walls and the earth would emerge in a bloodthirsty haze.
<br><br>
Because they had no consciousness, their only instinct was to constantly devour or be devoured. There were no winners here.
<br><br>
Even the most powerful of souls would eventually exhaust its energy, and turn into a mindless zombie till it sank back into the earth and became a part of the Soul City.
<br><br>
After a while, they would be born once more, and began to devour other souls to grow more powerful, until they sank back into the earth, and so on.
<br><br>
The cycle was never ending.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light from the Source World often waited outside the Soul City. From the gates, they could hear all kinds of howls and shrieks coming from within the Soul City.
<br><br>
The Soul City was not home to Souls of Light nor the Other Shore creatures. It was home to these resentful souls.
<br><br>
Now that the door was closed and all the Souls of Light were locked inside, it was not hard to imagine how things would turn out for them.
<br><br>
"Everyone, huddle!"
<br><br>
Libby reacted quickly and ordered with a trace of anxiety in her voice.
<br><br>
In a situation this chaotic, if they tried to fight on their own, it was only a matter of time before they all died. Now, they needed to band closely together.
<br><br>
Obediently, the other Souls of Light moved closer to her. Even Dailey from the Bearing race, who was initially hostile towards her, huddled towards the others.
<br><br>
Just as everyone gathered around Libby, a dragon-shaped soul rushed towards them from the sky.
<br><br>
"Soul-shattering Strike!" Libby cried.
<br><br>
The moment she saw the dragon-shaped soul headed straight for them, she knew how powerful it was. Without hesitation, she launched her strongest soul attack.
<br><br>
Raising her hand to the sky, countless soul swords shot upwards, one after the other.
<br><br>
"Puff, puff, puff..."
<br><br>
The Soul-shattering Strike was indeed powerful. If it was any other Soul of Light, it'd have been beaten to a pulp by now.
<br><br>
However, when the swords hit the surface the dragon-shaped soul, the energy actually bounced off and disappeared into thin air.
<br><br>
Libby's face fell. Trembling slightly, she felt an incredible need to run away.
<br><br>
However, the dragon-shaped soul was extremely fast. It bared its menacing teeth at Libby, poised to bite her head off.
<br><br>
Libby froze. As panic welled within her, she silently resigned herself to her fate.
<br><br>
Just as she was about to shut her eyes tight, a figure flashed in front of her.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Under such a violent collision, the dragon-shaped soul was smashed into pieces. Its head writhed and wriggled on the ground before them.
<br><br>
However, when the other souls saw the mangled dragon-shaped soul, they had flocked over it and devoured it violently. In no time, there was nothing left of it.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia..." Libby looked at the figure in front of her gratefully.
<br><br>
In her eyes, these princes, princesses, as well as the children of the leaders of the mountains, were not even worth much thought. Even if these people were talented, Libby always thought they were too unruly and arrogant and they couldn't achieve anything extraordinary.
<br><br>
Yet now, she felt indebted to Elvinia. She had forgotten that Elvinia had a physical body here! "Get up," Elvinia said indifferently. "Follow closely behind me."
<br><br>
Libby nodded slightly and stood obediently behind Elvinia. Now was not the time to feign bravery.
<br><br>
When Gabriel, Carver, and other disciples from the third floor of the Land of Sword Grief realized how strong Elvinia was, they too rushed to her side.
<br><br>
They thought they might have a better chance of making out of this alive if they stayed close to her.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Just then, a golden fish-shaped soul lurked nearby, swimming across the ground as though it were water. Ominously, it swam beneath everyone's feet, taunting them almost.
<br><br>
This fish-shaped soul had had a taste of the Souls of Light before. How could it give up this delicious opportunity so easily? "Whoosh!"
<br><br>
After locking onto its target, the fish-shaped soul suddenly jumped up from the ground, like a salmon leaping gracefully into the air from a river.
<br><br>
Opening its bloody mouth, it swallowed up three Souls of Light that were nearest to it in one gulp. Then, it hid under the ground once more.
<br><br>
It wandered along the ground until it reached the walls of a building in the Soul City. As it swam around, digesting its most recent prey, it eyed the Souls of Light beside the soul pillars.
<br><br>
The big fish was not the only hunter here. Countless golden souls rushed out from the soul cloud, hungry for soul food. Each hunter could live for a very long time, and their strength could not be underestimated.
<br><br>
Despite chances of survival looking quite slim, the Souls of Light continued to launch their counterattacks. Except for Dailey who had reached the Holy Soul Realm, the other warriors, including Toby of the Separate Abyss race didn't have the ability to fight back. Consequently, the air was filled with their screams.
<br><br>
"Hurry up! Step back behind Dailey!"
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia from the Oneness Sky Palace has a physical body. She can protect us!"
<br><br>
Gradually, those Souls of Light gathered behind the two of them.
<br><br>
However, those light golden souls were not willing to give up. They wandered in the ground and observed carefully. As long as there was a chance, they would jump up, tear up a Soul of Light, swallow it into their mouths, and then dive into the ground...
<br><br>
In the cabin, from the small window, Zen could see the chaos taking place outside. His expression darkened.
<br><br>
All these strange things started happening only after the golden pot fell to the ground, extinguishing the flame.
<br><br>
It didn't take a genius to figure out the cause and effect.
<br><br>
The Soul City would open every 132 hours. When it opened, the window of the cabin would be illuminated. Evidently, this was thanks to the flame of the golden pot.
<br><br>
In other words, every 132 hours, the golden pot would automatically light up with a flame--or, someone lit it every 132 hours.
<br><br>
Once the flame was ignited, the doors to the Soul City would open.
<br><br>
Then, 132 hours later, the flame of the golden pot would be extinguished, closing the gates to the Soul City.
<br><br>
Now that the flame was extinguished by Zen, the door closed in advance! Just seconds after flame was extinguished, the Soul City was already in chaos. Zen needed to ignite the flame again somehow.
<br><br>
"Flame..."
<br><br>
When Zen was in the form of his physical body, he could use the Elementary Fire Godly Way to easily release flames.
<br><br>
But in this situation, where could he possibly find a fire? Anxiously, he racked his brains trying to come up with a solution.
<br><br>
Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he turned to the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "Is Master Zhurong able to..."
<br><br>
Before he could even finish speaking, the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied.
<br><br>
"If Zhurong can make a move, I can also release flames to help you ignite the golden pot. But you have forgotten what form you are in now."
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifacts were borne by Zen's inner world, turning into a strange form. When Zen entered the Other Shore with his physical body, he could release them from his inner world.
<br><br>
However, when he was in the form of Soul of Light, he couldn't use any Godly Way. Consequently, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others wouldn't be able to help much.
<br><br>
Zen's frown deepened and he turned to stare outside the window again.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a streak of golden lightning flashed across the soul cloud.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Two huge dark blue eyes emerged from the depths of the soul cloud.
<br><br>
Chapter 3723 The Second Hand Many soul hunters with strange shapes and peculiar figures had already emerged from the soul cloud.
<br><br>
These hunters moved at an incredibly high speed all over the place. They moved on the ground, on the walls, and along the surface of the soul pillars.
<br><br>
They were eager to find any chance to devour the Souls of Light as soon as possible.
<br><br>
However, as soon as Elvinia and Dailey attacked them, the situation stabilized gradually.
<br><br>
The two of them protected most of the Souls of Light, one on the left side and the other on the right side. As soon as the hunters jumped out of the ground, Elvinia and Dailey would immediately attack them and tear them apart into a million pieces.
<br><br>
However, when two deep dark blue eyes suddenly appeared in the massive golden cloud, all the hunters seemed to be frightened for their lives. They quickly moved on the ground to hide in the buildings around the Soul City...
<br><br>
At the same time, the soul cloud emitted an extremely powerful aura, which seemed to be astoundingly irresistible.
<br><br>
Under the pressure of this aura, those Souls of Light, which had turned into the Indigo Souls at the ultimate level, immediately trembled. They were shaking so badly as if they were naked in a world with nothing but ice and snow.
<br><br>
"What is that?"
<br><br>
"What an intense soul pressure! I feel like I'm going to be torn apart!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God! If the door doesn't open soon, we will all die here!"
<br><br>
Even Dailey, who had already turned into the Colorless Soul and reached the Holy Soul Realm, felt great pressure as he looked up at the two deep dark blue eyes. He clenched his teeth together so hard and his face turned as pale as a ghost.
<br><br>
The aura of the soul alone was already very terrifying. If the monster within the soul cloud came out, how could he survive at all? Although Elvinia was already protected by her physical body and felt slightly better than the rest, the powerful and overbearing pressure also made her incredibly pale and shocked. She didn't think she could resist that thing and survive with her physical body.
<br><br>
When Zen saw the pair of deep dark blue eyes, the corners of his eyes also twitched crazily.
<br><br>
He had encountered many dangerous experiences and resolved countless crises in his life, but the pair of deep dark blue eyes that he was facing now were undoubtedly the most dangerous type he had ever encountered! "Where can I find fire to light the pot? It's simply..."
<br><br>
Just as Zen was feeling extremely anxious, his eyes fell on Elvinia. His heart skipped a beat as an idea popped into his mind. The divine flames of the Sun Crow race! Because of her bloodline, Elvinia could use this soul theurgy! In the Dark Region, Elvinia had lit up candles through the divine flames.
<br><br>
Zen was so anxious about what was happening just now that he totally forgot about it.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, he grabbed the shiny golden pot on the ground and rushed towards the door.
<br><br>
However, just as he was about to reach the door with the golden pot in his arms, the pot was suddenly controlled by a huge force and firmly fixed it at the door. Zen was caught off guard and was thrown out of the cabin with a spire. Fortunately, he grabbed the ladder and didn't fall all the way down.
<br><br>
The golden pot could never be taken out of the cabin! "Elvinia!"
<br><br>
Zen roared as he hanged on the ladder.
<br><br>
Elvinia, who stared at the pair of huge eyes in the soul cloud, didn't dare to even move a little bit. When she heard Zen shout, a trace of confidence suddenly blossomed in her heart.
<br><br>
As long as she and Zen stayed together, no matter how big and difficult the crisis was, they could overcome it! "I need flame! Give me the flame as fast as you can. Fire can disperse these demons and ghosts! It might also help in opening the door of the Soul City!"
<br><br>
Zen's booming voice attracted everyone's attention.
<br><br>
"What? Did I hear that correctly? Can he really disperse these souls?"
<br><br>
"He can still open the door? Is that true or is he just lying?"
<br><br>
"I don't care whether he is telling the truth or not. We should believe him and at least let him try."
<br><br>
When the Souls of Light heard Zen's loud shout, their hearts were immediately filled up with hope.
<br><br>
After understanding the meaning of Zen's words, Elvinia took a step forward, then quickly passed by the soul pillars, and ran wildly into the depths of the Soul City.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
At that moment, a wisp of slender flame appeared in Elvinia's hand.
<br><br>
She could use the divine flames of the Sun Crow race gracefully and skillfully. As she sprinted, she reached out her hand and gently pointed towards Zen, who was standing outside the cabin.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
The wisp of flame turned into a long thin thread and it shot towards Zen from the distance.
<br><br>
The cabin was more than three thousand feet high. Even with such a long distance, Elvinia could still release the flame with ease. As the thin thread continued to extend towards the cabin, the deep dark blue eyes flickered gently in the soul cloud behind Elvinia. They revealed a trace of malicious aura.
<br><br>
As the soul cloud surged, a ginormous hand suddenly stretched out! The skin of this hand was as rough as a bark of a tree. Its surface was also covered with neoplasm, which looked extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
Just as Elvinia was concentrating on releasing the flame, Zen suddenly shouted from above, "Watch out! Something is behind you!"
<br><br>
When she turned around, she realized that she had no time to dodge as the giant hand had already reached her. With a scream, she was grabbed by the hand, and the wisp of flame that she had released was broken...
<br><br>
"Oh no! Elvinia is caught by that enormous hand!"
<br><br>
"What are we supposed to do now? That's our only hope!"
<br><br>
"Stop it!"
<br><br>
As the scene unfolded right before their eyes, many Souls of Light were shocked to their core.
<br><br>
Dailey and the others also realized that the reason why the door closed in advance was definitely because Zen had entered the small cabin with a spire. And the only chance for them to leave the Soul City was that Zen used the flame to help them! Even if the monster within the soul cloud was ridiculously strong, they could only fight with all their might.
<br><br>
All of the Souls of Light, including Dailey, tried to stop the huge arm before it caused more damage.
<br><br>
However, even Elvinia, who had a physical body, was unable to break free from the strong hand. When these warriors attacked the giant hand, it was as if they were tickling it since it had no effect at all.
<br><br>
"Break up!"
<br><br>
A strong desire to survive rose from the bottom of Dailey's heart.
<br><br>
His hands suddenly transformed into two long whips with sharp edges.
<br><br>
With countless sharp whip shadows, they cut crazily and deeply on the huge arm.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
The bark-like skin of the arm was cut by the long whips. Bits and pieces of the skin were scattered everywhere.
<br><br>
Dailey had reached the Holy Soul Realm and obtained a Holy Soul Imprint.
<br><br>
Compared to the other Souls of Light, he could at least do some damage to the giant hand.
<br><br>
"Dailey! We need you! Cut off this hand now!"
<br><br>
"If the hand is cut off, it will automatically release Elvinia!"
<br><br>
"Come on! Do it now!"
<br><br>
Many Souls of Light encouraged Dailey's spirit and gave him hope.
<br><br>
However, this injury was nothing to the giant hand. It was not even a flesh injury. Instead, what Dailey did only enraged the monster within the soul cloud more.
<br><br>
Just as Dailey was carefully cutting the hand, a black shadow suddenly appeared in the soul cloud. It was another hand! "Ah, damn it..."
<br><br>
Dailey suddenly felt an ominous premonition in his heart.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The hand quickly descended from the sky and slapped Dailey to the ground.
<br><br>
The ground in the whole Soul City was trembling because of the impact.
<br><br>
When the huge palm left the ground, Dailey had disappeared.
<br><br>
Elvinia kept struggling to escape from the first hand, but she couldn't move at all because the huge hand was around her waist.
<br><br>
Just as she was about to be dragged into the soul cloud, the thought of the deep dark blue eyes staring at her sent a chill down her spine.
<br><br>
In despair, she suddenly thought of her right hand! Chapter 3724 A Cold Civilization When they were in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, Elvinia had given all the things stored inside her Sumeru space back to Zen.
<br><br>
Afterward, when they stepped into the Dark Region in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, Zen had returned two candles to her.
<br><br>
In fact, by that time, Elvinia had become a purified being and already mastered the Great Sanskrit Light. She could easily maneuver her way through the Dark Region, rendering the need for the candles useless. Even so, Zen had asked her to bring them along as an added precaution had the need occurred. Not thinking much of it, she put them away with her.
<br><br>
However, during their venture in the Dark Region in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, she never got to use them.
<br><br>
Once that memory flashed in her mind, she instinctively raised her right hand. Suddenly, a blast of blue light took the shape of a square as a candle slipped out of the Sumeru space.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
When the flame that rested on her palm brushed across the tip of the candle, it caused it to ignite in response.
<br><br>
A "Soul Candle" had unique characteristics that set it apart. Once it was lit, it would be impossible to extinguish its flames. Even if it was placed in the Sea of Truth, it would still be insufficient to put out its flares.
<br><br>
As soon as the candle was lit up with compelling flames, Elvinia wasted no second and jerked her hand upwards to violently throw it in the air.
<br><br>
The strength of Elvinia's corporeal body was by no means weak. In fact, she was a force to be reckoned with. If she wanted, she could throw the candle at an unbelievable height of hundreds of thousands feet high, let alone a few thousand feet high.
<br><br>
"Woo!"
<br><br>
An eerie sound coming from the soul cloud filled the air as if to pierce through the nerve-wracking atmosphere. The giant hand that entrapped Elvinia suddenly began to close around her as it exerted strenuous pressure.
<br><br>
The feeling of being crushed rang like a jolt of electricity on her bones as she faced the repercussions and let out a painful cry. She desperately held onto every last thread of life she had left in her.
<br><br>
Fortunately for her, Zen had instructed her to refine a fair amount of Body Strengthening Jades for her safety. If not for that, her bones would have been reduced to dust, and her body crippled beyond repair.
<br><br>
As she processed her thoughts, her eyes met the other giant hand stretching out from the soul cloud. When she followed its direction, she realized it was heading towards the candle at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
"No!"
<br><br>
One after another, Elvinia felt her spirits crumble in unison with every bone that cracked under pressure. Even though her corporeal body acted as an armor to protect her soul underneath, the sensation of her body slowly going frail felt real. It wasn't hard to fathom the excruciating pain that came with having all bones broken as if they were nothing.
<br><br>
Despite her situation, she kept her gaze fixated on the candle as her last beacon of hope.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
Zen was quickly alerted when he saw the floating candle. His eyes flashed and widened all of a sudden.
<br><br>
But when his eyes fetched the scene of the giant hand trying to grab ahold of that candle, the overwhelming sinking feeling in his heart caused his body to slump.
<br><br>
However, he suddenly had made up his mind as he clenched his fists.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Within a split second, he had jumped off the ladder without a second thought.
<br><br>
At this point, both the candle and the giant hand had ascended to a height of three thousand feet. It wasn't far from the cabin with a spire. As Zen closed the distance between himself and the candle, he effortlessly grabbed the candle, securing it. At the same time, he used the back of the giant hand as a boost as he lightly touched it with his tiptoes.
<br><br>
With this strategy, he gained enough momentum to boost himself upwards back on the ladder. Then without wasting a second, he used both his hands and feet to climb his way towards the cabin with a spire.
<br><br>
"Waah...Waah..."
<br><br>
Earsplitting cries erupted from the soul cloud.
<br><br>
Dark clouds of rage clouded around the big dark blue eyes that now looked as frightening as ever.
<br><br>
Soon, the entire Soul City was filled with traumatized Souls of Light that shook unwillingly after being exposed to such strong negative emotions.
<br><br>
The intensity of its rage was so overwhelming that they couldn't resist, and they were scared out of their wits.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the giant hand that outstretched from the soul cloud made its way towards Zen in an attempt to capture him.
<br><br>
However, before it could even brush over him, Zen's free hand suddenly burst out a spark of soul force, causing it to momentarily flinch. Taking advantage of the window of time, he rushed up the ladder and rolled himself to safety in the cabin.
<br><br>
Even with all odds stacked up against it, the monster in the soul cloud refused to accept its defeat. It continued to extend its hand towards Zen's direction in hopes of dragging him out from the cabin.
<br><br>
However, the moment the giant hand made the slightest contact with the door of the cabin, it was quickly blocked by an invisible barrier. It refused the monster any access inside.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Still continuing its efforts, the monster struck the door with its massive fist three times, each blow stronger than the last. But the invisible barrier remained firm and refused to let down its guard. Feeling defeated, the giant hand retreated reluctantly.
<br><br>
Zen had no time to waste on stressing over the giant hand outside the cabin.
<br><br>
With the candle in his possession, he quickly turned it around and pointed it towards the mouth of the golden pot.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
At this gesture, a wisp of flame formed at the mouth of the golden pot.
<br><br>
Soon, the candlelight in the cabin with a spire shone brightly once more and lit up the entire place.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
As if its demise was triggered, the dark blue eyes that were once filled with rage showed a hint of sorrow as they gradually closed. The giant hand that entrapped Elvinia loosened its grip and returned back to the soul cloud.
<br><br>
Following suit were the golden souls that also rushed towards the soul cloud while the others vanished into walls or sank into the ground.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
With a rustic sound, the gate of the Soul City opened up slowly.
<br><br>
As if an immense catastrophe was averted, the Souls of Light from various races across the Source World heaved a deep sigh of relief.
<br><br>
Whatever might have happened, for them, it was satisfying enough to see the gate of the Soul City open before them.
<br><br>
Once the gate was opened, they felt much safer. No accident had been reported inside here when it was open for the past countless years.
<br><br>
However, after having experienced their fair share of traumas just now, they all walked towards the gate of the Soul City.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia!"
<br><br>
Libby, Gabriel, Carver, and the other members from the Oneness Sky Palace quickly rushed to Elvinia's side.
<br><br>
Libby crouched down next to her and closely examined her profile before heaving a sigh of relief. "Luckily, Princess Elvinia is just unconscious after what she just faced. There is nothing to worry about. We must move her out of the Soul City first!"
<br><br>
Of course, she was saying these things to Zen.
<br><br>
In fact, everyone knew full well the mess was nothing but Zen's fault. He was the root cause behind it.
<br><br>
Libby was unaware of what Zen had discovered above to have caused such a mishap. Even so, due to being a member of the Oneness Sky Palace, she had no choice but to give him support. Moreover, after the closing of the gate of the Soul City, many Souls of Light of the Oneness Sky Palace were lucky to be unscathed. Only Elvinia ended up injured.
<br><br>
So she hoped Zen would take the opportunity to explore the top of the Soul City instead of coming down to check up on Elvinia.
<br><br>
Zen's paced breathing didn't take a second's worth of rest until he heard the news from Libby from below.
<br><br>
How could he live with himself if he were to become the cause of Elvinia's death? He stood inside the cabin with a spire and continued his search. With the golden pot still in his hands, he rotated it from all sides to observe it intently.
<br><br>
The table and carpet inside the cabin had been reduced to dust. There was nothing worth a second glance other than the golden pot in his hands.
<br><br>
"Is this golden pot the key to the gate of the Soul City?" Zen muttered to himself, his voice now low with disappointment.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven seemed very calm.
<br><br>
Although he also entered the cabin with his expectations high, he knew this kind of disappointing result was common.
<br><br>
In fact, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had explored a few similar relics before, such as the end of the Sky Cloud Water Road in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, and the grey white house in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Those things couldn't have been built by the Element Spirit race. The civilizations on the Other Shore weren't gifted with such an ability. They could only have been left behind by the Instant Civilization.
<br><br>
However, the Instant Civilization appeared to be devoid of all emotions or thoughts. They would not leave any trace or information in the relics, which was somewhat abnormal.
<br><br>
Many civilizations that had entered the Other Shore would bear extreme disappointment towards the Other Shore after staying there for a period of time. They would end up killing away all the creatures of their civilization, which meant that they would commit mass suicide together.
<br><br>
But before they wiped out all the creatures of the civilization off the surface of the map, they would build a temple and leave information and something else there to vouch for their existence.
<br><br>
In contrast, the Instant Civilization hadn't left any information whatsoever.
<br><br>
The relics they had left behind all looked cold and empty. They appeared to scream with arrogance, "We once existed, but we don't need your understanding. You are not qualified enough to find us."
<br><br>
Chapter 3725 Starry Roc-fish The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others all agreed with the Primeval Lord of Heaven's conclusion.
<br><br>
The arrogant Instant Civilization was stingy with clues.
<br><br>
As for why, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others had many ideas and speculations.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess believed the reason to be very simple. The Instant Civilization was so powerful that they took the other ruling civilizations as weak and pitiful tiny bugs.
<br><br>
Why would they leave any clues to the bugs? The Snake Goddess' deduction was simple and crude, so not many agreed with it.
<br><br>
The others didn't think it was that simple. If the Instant Civilization really looked down upon the later "bug"-like ruling civilizations that would come, they would not have made all kinds of complex rules on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
For example, the suppressive power of every stage of the Other Shore was different. If this rule was removed, the Element Spirit Civilization that had set foot on the Other Shore first, would probably have dominated the entire Other Shore and anyone who came after wouldn't have stood a chance.
<br><br>
Not to mention the deliberate and careful arrangements such as the Soul City, the Land of Bone Tribulation and the Eternal Scroll Painting that were obviously for the promotion of the later generations.
<br><br>
The Instant Civilization would not create such a meticulous and painstaking blueprint if they saw the future generations as bugs...
<br><br>
The arguments about things they did not know were endless, plus the theories everyone put forward could not be proved. Thus, to this day, whether it was the human race, the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race, they had yet to understand the attitude of the Instant Civilization.
<br><br>
"It makes sense for a key to the gates of the Soul City to be hung here," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said smiling.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the golden pot, stretched his fingers out and extinguished the flame at the mouth of the pot.
<br><br>
Rumble! The gates of the Soul City began closing once more.
<br><br>
As it did, all the souls began floating around, as if a banquet was about to begin.
<br><br>
"Ah, why is it closing again?"
<br><br>
"Zen hasn't come out yet!"
<br><br>
"Luckily we got out..."
<br><br>
Libby and the others outside were overtaken with anxiety at the sight of the Soul City about to close its gates again.
<br><br>
Seeing the ghosts about to dance in the Soul City, Zen gently tapped the candle to the mouth of the pot and lit it, igniting a faint flame as before. As he did this, the souls returned to the walls and the gates slowly opened.
<br><br>
After lighting the flame, Zen put it out.
<br><br>
He lit it again, and then put it out...
<br><br>
His repetition finally aroused heated dissatisfaction.
<br><br>
The souls that howled in the walls let out angry roars. The pair of dark blue eyes that had been immersed in the darkness appeared again. "Woo...
<br><br>
Woo..." Zen didn't understand what they said, but from their tone he figured they were mad at his recklessness.
<br><br>
"Zen, what are you doing?"
<br><br>
Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven was confused.
<br><br>
Zen curled his lips and said, "The golden pot must be ignited to open the city gates. Since the gates are opened every 132 hours, it means that someone must be lighting the pot every 132 hours..."
<br><br>
The logic was simple and sound. But perhaps it was because the Primeval Lord of Heaven hadn't been surrounded by human ways of thinking for so long that he hadn't considered this himself.
<br><br>
"The floor, door, and table of this room can't be touched," Zen added.
<br><br>
After Zen reached the Holy Soul Realm, his soul was already solid and as strong as his body. All it took was a gentle touch to destroy everything in the room, which meant no one had touched it before he had.
<br><br>
"This means that the 'person' that lit the golden pot came from above," Zen said, raising his head to look up.
<br><br>
There didn't appear to be anything above his head except for the fist-sized stones the whole room was made up of.
<br><br>
He stared at the stones for a moment before jumping up and putting his fingers into a crack between the stones and fixing himself on it. Holding himself up, he raised the golden pot to the stones.
<br><br>
Under the light of the fire from the golden pot, they began to change color.
<br><br>
The originally grayish white stones turned dark blue embellished with colorful dots of light, seeming to form a wallpaper of a colorful starry sky that spread out above the room.
<br><br>
"It's a painting of a fish. It's really quite mysterious..." Zen said with a curious smile.
<br><br>
All the stones glowed and it became apparent that the lights were not arranged in random. Instead, they formed the outline of a huge fish.
<br><br>
"That's no ordinary fish. It's a roc-fish, the Starry Roc-fish!" said the Primeval Lord of Heaven, his voice trembling with excitement. He was even more exhilarated by this than Zen.
<br><br>
"What is the Starry Roc-fish?" Zen asked inquisitively.
<br><br>
"It's a giant sky beast that flies throughout Stage Thirty-three," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied. "When it passes by, the entire sky will change. It is a gentle and beautiful creature."
<br><br>
Zen thought a moment and then asked, "But Primeval Lord of Heaven, if we see the Other Shore as a special space, it would still be within the chaos.
<br><br>
Stage Thirty-three is at the top of the chaos, then if we look up, what we see above our heads should be the ceiling, right?"
<br><br>
"You are wrong," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, shaking his head in disagreement.
<br><br>
When Zen had first told him about King Manard, namely Ziya Jiang and the Abstruse Energy World, he wasn't all that surprised as he had seen the Abstruse Energy World in Stage Thirty-three once he raised his head! Stage Thirty-three was different from the Deleting Space. The latter was separated by a "wall" and in order to break that wall, Ziya had spent a great deal of time, using any means possible.
<br><br>
However, there was no ceiling at the top of Stage Thirty-three. The bright dots of light above were the starry sky which was exactly the Abstruse Energy World! "Since there is no ceiling, why haven't you gone there?" Zen pressed on.
<br><br>
This was all new to him.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had mentioned that there was also an entrance to the Abstruse Energy World in Stage Thirty-three. However, the entrance was under the control of the Element Spirit race, so there was no way for them to go that way.
<br><br>
"Although the Abstruse Energy World is atop Stage Thirty-three, there is an invisible force field a million miles above us. The inner layer of this force field is not equal to its outer layer. When any material passes through, it will be torn to pieces as a result of this unequal pressure," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained. "The force field was discovered by Fuxi, so it was named Fuxi Unequal Force Field. It covers the entire Stage Thirtythree..."
<br><br>
"The only road to cross through the force field is controlled by the Element Spirit race," the Primeval Lord of Heaven added.
<br><br>
"I see," Zen nodded while he stared at the wall.
<br><br>
He noticed a thin, sharp horn on the head of the Starry Roc-fish, and a flame drawn on the horn.
<br><br>
"Flame..."
<br><br>
"Golden pot..."
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, I think the golden pot is lit by the Starry Rocfish," Zen said confidently.
<br><br>
Chapter 3726 Return There was only one picture within the cabin. A wisp of flame was gracefully depicted on the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
Zen's judgment was based on such simple logic after all, and it needed further evidence to prove it to be true.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke quietly, "It's highly likely. But how can you prove it?"
<br><br>
"Prove it?" Zen looked out of the window as he considered the question.
<br><br>
His gaze pierced through the thick soul cloud, and fell upon the city gate in the distance.
<br><br>
The gate would open or close every 132 hours; open for 132 hours and then closed for 132 hours.
<br><br>
He believed it would not be difficult to prove his theory. He simply needed to wait for another 132 hours.
<br><br>
The souls wandering around outside the cabin could not enter it. Zen couldn't help but worry that something unexpected would happen as he was waiting.
<br><br>
He turned around to look at the Starry Roc-fish again. His expression became grave, and with little hesitation, he blew out the flames of the golden pot with a puff of air.
<br><br>
A deep rumble shook the ground.
<br><br>
His eyes shifted back to the window to watch the gate of the Soul City slowly swing closed.
<br><br>
Zen had opened and closed the gate to the Soul City too frequently. Maybe that was why the Souls of Light paused at the sound before crawling from the walls and flooding the city streets.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, outside the city gate...
<br><br>
Libby, Elvinia, Gabriel and the others watching the gate from the outside were confused.
<br><br>
"Zen can freely open and close the city gate..."
<br><br>
"Why would he close it now, though?"
<br><br>
"Do you think something is wrong?"
<br><br>
Despite her look of worry, Elvinia was trying to remain as calm as she could.
<br><br>
It seemed the souls could not enter the cabin, so Zen must have had his own reason for doing so. She decided to wait patiently here.
<br><br>
They could still see light from within the cabin, but it looked to be just the candle that was shining.
<br><br>
Zen kept a watchful eye on the candle. He needed to be able to protect it at a moment's notice. If the light were extinguished, he would most likely lose the chance to leave.
<br><br>
He watched as the souls within the walls and in the soul cloud began to move, one after the other.
<br><br>
Zen knew there were many souls residing in the Soul City, but the longer he remained here and watched, the more souls he noticed. The city was practically swarming with souls.
<br><br>
The souls hidden within the walls acted like water that gushed out of a mountain ravine nonstop.
<br><br>
They were all densely packed together, overlapping and falling over every inch of the Soul City.
<br><br>
Zen could feel his scalp begin to tingle as he watched the densely packed souls from the window.
<br><br>
The sharp sound of a large object whistled through the sky.
<br><br>
Zen watched as several predators burst through the soul cloud, their golden light reflecting eerily off the mist. They devoured thousands of souls in their path. The lowest level souls had piled up, so it was impossible to know the true number eaten.
<br><br>
An hour had passed before the pair of dark blue eyes appeared again.
<br><br>
The monster whose true face was obscured by the soul cloud was the strongest of the predators. It stretched out its hands and aimed to capture those light golden souls.
<br><br>
Zen watched with blank expressions for more than sixty hours, the scene the same all throughout the city: the large fish ate the small fish, and the small fish ate the shrimps. And then it all stopped.
<br><br>
The souls in the square had become fewer, and only a small portion of the light golden souls floated around corners to avoid being eaten by the massive eyes.
<br><br>
When it was full enough, the pair of menacing eyes focused their piercing stare on the cabin. Zen knew that it could tell he was in here. His suspicion was confirmed when it reached out a hand towards the cabin to gently tap the window with a finger.
<br><br>
It tapped three times, 'knock, knock, knock'.
<br><br>
The creature seemed to be taunting Zen, reminding him of its existence.
<br><br>
In fact, Zen had paid the most attention to it, so he didn't need to be reminded.
<br><br>
Although he knew it could not enter the cabin, he couldn't help the nervousness creeping up his spine.
<br><br>
The soft sound of singing made its way to Zen's ears.
<br><br>
When the knocks subsided, Zen could make out a bit more of the song. It was a harmony of a variety of voices coming from within the cloud.
<br><br>
The song was fast paced and exciting at first, and then it gradually slowed to take on a smoother, melodious sound. After a moment of the beautiful sound, a tinge of sadness began to creep into the voices.
<br><br>
"Could it be the monster singing this song?" Zen muttered under his breath.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven hummed in acknowledgement, "Yes, I believe so."
<br><br>
"So it knows the Sanskrit words?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was silent for a moment before saying, "That seems to be the case."
<br><br>
It seemed that the monster had been simply trying to communicate the only way it knew how, by singing that strange song.
<br><br>
However, neither Zen nor the Primeval Lord of Heaven could understand a single word.
<br><br>
The singing continued for several more hours until the sound became slow and listless before it finally gave up and fell silent.
<br><br>
Time continued to drag by as Zen waited patiently.
<br><br>
Once 132 hours had passed, the colorful lights on the walls began to shimmer and fluctuate.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes grew wide as he watched the change.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish on the wall began to move. It twisted its tail and swam along the wall. Suddenly, it peeled itself from the wall and jumped straight for the golden pot.
<br><br>
Atop the tiny horn on its head, an orange flame danced and wiggled.
<br><br>
It paid no mind to anything within the cabin as it made its way to the golden pot, but when it came close it realized that the pot had disappeared.
<br><br>
An odd cooing sound fell from its fishy lips.
<br><br>
The strange sound seemed to be it questioning the lack of golden pot.
<br><br>
For countless chaotic eras, the position of the golden pot had never been changed. Where could it have gone? Its head turned to and fro before it realized that Zen sat in the corner.
<br><br>
"Woo?" it cooed once more.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish felt a little uneasy at the appearance of a stranger.
<br><br>
Zen could feel its nervousness that was slightly edged with fear, so he slowly pushed the golden pot a little further out in front of him. "I-I don't wish to harm you. I would just like to speak to you," Zen said softly so as not to startle it.
<br><br>
As Zen spoke, the eyes of the Starry Roc-fish flashed with multicolored lights.
<br><br>
It took a moment for it to comprehend his words before words started to spit from its mouth.
<br><br>
"Fire..." The voice was small and raspy with disuse.
<br><br>
"World..."
<br><br>
"You, I..."
<br><br>
The series of words didn't make any sense until Zen's eyes widened with surprise. "It, it seems to be..."
<br><br>
"It is adapting to our language," the Primeval Lord of Heaven cut in.
<br><br>
"But I only said one sentence..." The shock in Zen's voice was obvious.
<br><br>
"Some creatures have different methods than ours," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. "Perhaps with a single word from you, it is able to learn our entire language. It must process information differently from us."
<br><br>
After uttering what seemed like an endless stream of random words, the Starry Roc-fish finally spoke a full sentence. "You returned too late. You did not come while he was waiting. You returned too late..."
<br><br>
Despite the fact he could now understand what was said, Zen still found himself confused. "What do you mean by that?"
<br><br>
"He has been waiting for you to return!" the Starry Roc-fish repeated in a sharp tone.
<br><br>
"Return..."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zen suddenly thought of something.
<br><br>
When Zen had broken through the soul cloud and obtained the nine Holy Soul Imprints, he went about it a very different way than others did before him.
<br><br>
He hadn't suffered too much pressure to the point it had all seemed too easy.
<br><br>
The feeling was just like going home, so the Primeval Lord of Heaven guessed that it might have something to do with the mysteries in Zen's background and origin.
<br><br>
Chapter 3727 Visitors These words made Zen rather perplexed.
<br><br>
He never had any doubt about his background and origin—the blood running in his veins was undoubtedly inherited from his parents.
<br><br>
Everything in Soul City was related to souls. One's bloodline completely didn't matter here.
<br><br>
Therefore, when Zen heard what the Starry Roc-fish said, the first thought that appeared in his mind was that it had mistaken him for someone else.
<br><br>
"Return? You mean this isn't my first time to the Soul City?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish blinked and made a slight nod.
<br><br>
"Have I come here before?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish nodded again.
<br><br>
"What makes you think so?" Zen became more and more bewildered.
<br><br>
"You're the only one who can get nine Holy Soul Imprints; nobody else can," the Starry Roc-fish said concisely.
<br><br>
Upon hearing what the Starry Roc-fish said, the Primeval Lord of Heaven heaved a deep sigh and said, "I see."
<br><br>
"What?" Zen asked in his mind.
<br><br>
"I've told you before that I obtained seven Holy Soul Imprints back then and that it is already an extremely rare occurrence on the Other Shore, right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked back.
<br><br>
"Yes, but you also said that someone else managed to obtain eight Holy Soul Imprints," Zen answered.
<br><br>
"That person was my junior fellow disciple. His talent has always been greater than mine," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said regretfully, "but after he obtained eight Holy Soul Imprints, he was always unhappy. He felt that with his talent, he ought to be able to obtain the ninth Holy Soul Imprint successfully. Moreover, his soul pillar had grown to 1, 710 feet tall.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, when he was about to succeed, he was suddenly attacked by an unknown force and fell down."
<br><br>
The junior fellow disciple of the Primeval Lord of Heaven was the Grandmaster of Heaven. At that time, he had yet to have a falling-out with the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and they still treated each other like brothers.
<br><br>
"In other words, the ninth imprint..." Zen said hesitantly.
<br><br>
"It is impossible to be obtained by anyone else but you," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Zen shrugged and smiled helplessly. "Apparently, I have to get acquainted with myself again..."
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish swung its tail from side to side repeatedly, stuck its horn out, and started to sway around at the mouth of the golden pot. Before long, a wisp of flame suddenly burst at the golden pot's mouth, and the gate of Soul City was once again opened.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish had to do the same task day after day. Even though Zen's arrival was a very special event, it didn't really pique its interest.
<br><br>
It continued to swing its tail, intending to return to the wall.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute." Zen stepped forward and stopped the Starry Roc-fish. He still had a lot of unanswered questions weighing on his mind—how could he let it go that easily? "Since you said I had been in the city before, you must know me. Tell me, who am I? And who's waiting for me?"
<br><br>
"The one waiting for you is my master, and you're the one my master's waiting for."
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish then continued to swing its tail, propelling its body forward and passing through Zen's hand.
<br><br>
Its body was neither soul nor corporeal form, so Zen simply could do nothing to stop it.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The moment the Starry Roc-fish drilled into the wall, it turned into a mural that glittered with dots of lights.
<br><br>
"Hey! So you won't move anymore? That isn't an answer at all. You should at least explain it clearly!"
<br><br>
Zen shouted at the wall. Just as he prepared himself to wait for another 132 hours, the Starry Roc-fish suddenly stuck its head out and came out of the wall again. It then swept its head along the wall gently.
<br><br>
The light dots on the wall continued to converge. In a short while, they already shaped some sort of a small key.
<br><br>
In the next second, the key popped out of the wall and fell to the ground with crisp jingles.
<br><br>
"Ding, Ding, Ding..."
<br><br>
"I'm just a spirit servant that's guarding the Soul City on my master's behalf.
<br><br>
You should go to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. This key should help you in finding my master..." Upon saying that, the Starry Roc-fish sank back into the wall and didn't come out again.
<br><br>
Zen picked up the key and examined it for a while.
<br><br>
There was nothing special about this key. At least from its appearance, it just looked like an ordinary key.
<br><br>
Zen smiled bitterly and said, "There are so many locks in this world, but you just gave me a key. God knows for which lock this key is..."
<br><br>
"It shouldn't be difficult to find the lock," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile.
<br><br>
"You mean..."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven continued, "There are indeed many locks in this world, but there aren't many in Stage Thirty-three!"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was one of the very few people who had set foot in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, so he naturally knew the Three Purities Stage well. Just now, he had even come up with a few guesses regarding this matter, so Zen should go to the Three Purities Stage to verify his guesses.
<br><br>
With a shrug, Zen stretched out his hand. A blue square of light appeared out of thin air and started to flicker. Without further ado, Zen threw the key into it.
<br><br>
Immediately afterward, Zen left the cabin. When he arrived at the soul pillars, many of the Souls of Light present quietly directed their gazes at him. After all, he now looked completely different from them.
<br><br>
The aura he emitted even scared them.
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
When Zen passed by the area where the soul pillars were, he heard Elvinia's call.
<br><br>
Elvinia already entered the city the moment the gate opened, but instead of climbing back up the soul pillar, she stood waiting next to it in silence.
<br><br>
After seeing that Zen was safe and sound, she finally heaved a relieved sigh.
<br><br>
"Sorry, I didn't inform you in advance when I closed the gate to the Soul City..." Zen said apologetically.
<br><br>
In any case, Elvinia must've been worried about him for a long time.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, Elvinia smiled and said, "I've gone to the Flow Sword Sect to see you and found you were fine, but my mother also asked me to send you a message. The Snake Goddess has come to our Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
She wants to see you."
<br><br>
Although the Oneness Sky Palace was temporarily peaceful, a large number of people were still pessimistic about the future.
<br><br>
After all, it was very dangerous for a super force to have no Eternal Warrior watching over it.
<br><br>
Although the Snake Goddess of the Pear Hill came to the Oneness Sky Palace only for a visit, her presence undoubtedly made many people feel much more relieved.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were the most outstanding among the Eternal Warriors after all.
<br><br>
"Okay, I see." Zen looked at Elvinia and said, "Come on! You should do your best too!"
<br><br>
Elvinia wanted to step into Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore with Zen, but Zen had already passed the trial in Soul City in one try. She, on the other hand, might have to spend a while stuck in here.
<br><br>
Even though Elvinia was talented, it wouldn't be easy for her to pass through the Soul City in a short time.
<br><br>
She naturally understood this clearly.
<br><br>
"Okay!"
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded and then leaped onto the soul pillar.
<br><br>
Right after Zen stepped out of the gate of Soul City, he chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune under his breath and left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After a period of reconstruction, the originally destroyed Phoenix Palace was almost completely reconstructed.
<br><br>
However, the current Phoenix Palace was only good in terms of its external appearance. The powerful arrays protecting it, such as the Primitive Illusion and the Three-Element Sword Array, had already been destroyed.
<br><br>
Pearce, Auden, Winchell, Athemar, and other important officials of the Oneness Sky Palace, were all waiting in the Supreme Dragon Hall.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess both sat on the seats of honor in the Supreme Dragon Hall. They were here naturally to wait for Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3728 Strong Soul "The last time I was here, I saw the ingenuity of the Primitive Illusion, and praised it. But alas, I didn't expect it to be destroyed in just a few short years..." the Snake Goddess trailed off, a trace of sadness appearing on her beautiful face.
<br><br>
"It's just an illusion array. I can set it up at any time. Since Zen hasn't retreated from the Other Shore yet, I can set it up now," Fuxi said reassuringly, to comfort the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Pearce's eyes lit up at Fuxi's words. He said gratefully, "Human Sovereign, if you are willing to set up an array for us, it will be a great honor for the Oneness Sky Palace."
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess did not look impressed. She gave Fuxi a cool look and said, "The Oneness Sky Palace does not lack a powerful array.
<br><br>
What it needs is warriors that can confront those in the Eternal Realm, and an array will be of no use for that."
<br><br>
Fuxi saw the way the Snake Goddess was staring at him and felt embarrassed.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was right. No matter how powerful the array was, it would be meaningless for the Oneness Sky Palace without protection of Eternal Warriors. At most, such arrays could only slow down the enemy's attack.
<br><br>
As they were speaking, a guard's voice suddenly came from the front door of the Supreme Dragon Hall. "Here comes Zen Luo from the Oneness Mountain!"
<br><br>
Zen swept into the hall, and the conversation stopped as everyone turned towards him.
<br><br>
Strong masters like Athemar and Master Hai raised their eyebrows when they caught sight of Zen. It was immediately apparent that he had undergone some great trials, for there were fundamental changes in his aura.
<br><br>
His eyes were bright with an incomparably strong aura. Indeed, just gazing into those brilliant eyes made everyone feel surprised. Only after his soul had made great progress could Zen produce that awe-inspiring effect on others.
<br><br>
"Zen, have you passed the trial in the Soul City?" Athemar asked, already knowing the answer.
<br><br>
He was familiar with Zen's abilities, and had always predicted that Zen would be capable of stepping into the Land of Sword Grief in a few years.
<br><br>
But now, Zen had exceeded even his high expectations. In an impossibly short period of time, he had faced and overcome the trial of the Soul City.
<br><br>
It gave Athemar a jolt to realize that Zen's cultivation level was now almost equal to his own.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen said simply.
<br><br>
People burst into chatter, reacting to his astonishing announcement. "You managed that so fast!"
<br><br>
"I'm sure that only a few days ago, you had only reached the eighteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. And now you have reached the Holy Soul Realm?"
<br><br>
"It all sounds unbelievable!"
<br><br>
Pearce stared at Zen, unable to hide his shock. Mere days ago, he and Zen had discussed Stage Thirty-three. To have passed the trail of the Soul City since then was nothing short of astounding.
<br><br>
Flamine, who was sitting on the leftmost, smiled faintly. "Elvinia didn't tell me!"
<br><br>
The news that Zen had reached the Holy Soul Realm made the people of the Oneness Sky Palace feel proud and overjoyed, but there was also a sense of frustration.
<br><br>
After all, they were not the Eternal Warriors. They were only at the Holy Soul Realm. They couldn't help but feel slightly envious that a young man like Zen managed to catch up with them in only a few years, making them pale in comparison to him.
<br><br>
Zen turned to the guests in the room. He cupped his hands towards them and said formally, "My greetings, Snake Goddess and Human Sovereign."
<br><br>
Fuxi snorted arrogantly, while the Snake Goddess curled her lips in a smile.
<br><br>
She said, "How many times did you try to reach the Holy Soul Realm?"
<br><br>
The others looked at Zen expectantly, for they had forgotten to ask him about this. No one in the Source World had ever reached the Holy Soul Realm in fewer than ten tries. If Zen had done it on fewer attempts, he would set a new record.
<br><br>
Zen's expression didn't change. "One," he replied calmly.
<br><br>
His answer stunned everyone who heard it. Flamine's eyes widened. She knew that even Eastern Emperor Taiyi had attempted to reach the Holy Soul Realm ten times before succeeding.
<br><br>
The powerful warriors in the Supreme Dragon Hall gazed at Zen with increased respect, feeling honored to be in the presence of such a great talent.
<br><br>
A single attempt? No one could think of anybody who had ever passed the trial of the Soul City on their first attempt.
<br><br>
They thought back on what they knew of history and tried to remember other great warriors, but it seemed that such a record had never been seen before in this round of chaos.
<br><br>
Even Fuxi had dropped his arrogant expression. He stared at Zen with amazement, as though he was looking at a monster. "Is this true? You reached the Holy Soul Realm on your first try?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess maintained her composure. She said calmly to Zen, "And how many Holy Soul Imprints did you get?"
<br><br>
The Souls of Light present in the Soul City had all witnessed Zen obtaining the Holy Soul Imprints, and surely many of them had reported it to their own races by now. There was no way for him to hide the truth.
<br><br>
"Nine," Zen replied honestly.
<br><br>
For a moment, silence fell upon the Supreme Dragon Hall. Then it was broken by a burst of noise as everyone began talking all at once.
<br><br>
"Zen, did you really get nine Holy Soul Imprints?" someone asked incredulously.
<br><br>
"I...I got only one..."
<br><br>
"Most of us got none!"
<br><br>
Among all the senior officials of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, only Auden had been able to obtain a Holy Soul Imprint. But even that single imprint had made Auden's soul far stronger than other Colorless Souls.
<br><br>
They were dumbstruck at the thought of how powerful Zen's soul had become, with nine Holy Soul Imprints. He had become incomparably strong.
<br><br>
"No one has ever obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints. Are you exaggerating?"
<br><br>
Fuxi couldn't resist asking. His brows were drawn together in a frown. He couldn't believe that Zen had managed to gain such an impossible feat.
<br><br>
Even the Snake Goddess had narrowed her eyes, astonished at Zen's claims.
<br><br>
But unlike Fuxi, she didn't ask any accusing questions. She met Zen's eyes and said, "Please release the soul pressure and show us what you've accomplished."
<br><br>
She was inclined to believe Zen, but she still wanted to see proof. She also wanted to see exactly how strong a soul reinforced by nine Holy Soul Imprints could be.
<br><br>
Zen had just withdrawn from the Other Shore, and had yet to test the limits of his newfound power. He felt an unprecedented sense of overwhelming strength, but he didn't know precisely how powerful his Soul of Light had become.
<br><br>
"All right," he agreed, wanting to see for himself.
<br><br>
He closed his eyes slightly and took a deep breath.
<br><br>
The room had fallen quiet as everyone watched Zen. The only sound was Zen's soft exhalation as he breathed out.
<br><br>
In that moment, his eyes opened, and a formidable soul aura burst out.
<br><br>
Gasps could be heard around the hall at the sight. The nine Holy Soul Imprints combined to form a whole, constantly circulating within his soul.
<br><br>
The soul aura expanded rapidly, permeating the entire Supreme Dragon Hall and exerting pressure on everyone within it.
<br><br>
All the warriors present, except for Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, felt the suppression of a more powerful aura than their own.
<br><br>
"Incredible!"
<br><br>
Athemar couldn't hold back a slight, bitter smile.
<br><br>
He had initially thought that Zen's cultivation level was now on par with his own, but it seemed now that he had underestimated Zen.
<br><br>
Outside the Supreme Dragon Hall, new guards stood on duty, unaware of what was happening inside. They all possessed great cultivation strength.
<br><br>
But when Zen's invisible soul pressure burst outside the bounds of the hall, it soared past them into the sky, enveloping them. The guards stiffened and looked around, feeling as though there was some ancient, powerful beast in the hall. A sensation of iciness washed over them and many of the guards fell to their knees as their legs trembled, unable to stand.
<br><br>
The soul pressure lasted for a few seconds. Zen closed his eyes again, and retracted his aura. After a moment, he blinked, and his eyes returned to normal. But they still emitted a sense of contained power.
<br><br>
"I've never seen anyone who has nine Holy Soul Imprints. Zen, you have not yet entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, but your soul is already so powerful. Once you have done so, your strength will only grow. I look forward to what you can accomplish," the Snake Goddess said, nodding to him to show her appreciation.
<br><br>
Even Fuxi had no mocking words for Zen. A hint of gloominess was evident in his expression.
<br><br>
Fuxi had never been convinced of Zen's abilities the way so many others were.
<br><br>
After all, there had once been a huge gap between Zen and himself. He had not expected nor imagined that it was possible for Zen to catch up with him so quickly.
<br><br>
Would Zen really surpass him in a few days? Fuxi scowled. He would never accept that! "I hope to step onto Stage Thirty-two as soon as possible, and become an Eternal Warrior," Zen said.
<br><br>
Murmurs rose from the crowd of people, and the Snake Goddess lifted an eyebrow. She said, "I heard that you had summoned Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Did you really find the human race on the Other Shore? Could I meet them?"
<br><br>
Pearce had told her the truth about Eastern Emperor Taiyi defending against the enemy, so the Snake Goddess was extremely concerned about it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3729 Deduction Of Descending The reason Zen found the Creation Myth Temple was because of the SixPattern Blood-storing Seed.
<br><br>
At first, he obtained the seed in the hopes of increasing the blood of the Ancient Chaos God in his body.
<br><br>
But since the Snake Goddess didn't even ask about it, Zen decided it would be best to not report to her.
<br><br>
"I did find them, and I also found you," Zen replied.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes widened, surprised with his response.
<br><br>
Pearce mentioned that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had appeared beside Zen, and this left her confused. If this was possible, could it be that there was another Snake Goddess? However, Pearce failed to explain clearly, so the Snake Goddess was just assuming based on a whim.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen transmitted his voice into his inner world.
<br><br>
Within a few moments, three faint figures floated right out of Zen's head.
<br><br>
The two figures on the left and right were the Snake Goddess and Fuxi respectively and the Primeval Lord of Heaven was in the middle.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked at her real self before her, studying each and every part. She brought her fingers to her mouth, shocked that her real self had the exact same aura, appearance, and expression as hers.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi frowned at the sight of his real self.
<br><br>
At the same time, he couldn't help but notice how free and easy his real self was.
<br><br>
"You... You are me?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
The real Snake Goddess nodded politely with a soft smile, "Yes. I've heard that Pear Hill led the many seeds we sowed before. You're quite extraordinary, if I do say so myself."
<br><br>
"Are you praising yourself or praising me?" The Snake Goddess let out a small chuckle.
<br><br>
"Both."
<br><br>
The two Snake Goddesses got along so easily, as if they were the best of friends. The Fuxis, on the other hand, had not moved since their eyes met.
<br><br>
Their eyes were wide and both of them appeared speechless, making it really awkward.
<br><br>
After a few minutes, the Primeval Lord of Heaven introduced himself and explained the situation of the Other Shore to the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
When Fuxi heard that the Civilization Artifact was carried by Zen, a look of sadness washed over his face.
<br><br>
It seemed that Zen was becoming more and more significant to the human race.
<br><br>
"I actually had a gut feeling when I initially planted these seeds," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained. "If it weren't for the intervention of the Element Spirit Civilization, the human race would have already had the largest, most absolute advantage."
<br><br>
It was known that the Primeval Lord of Heaven found and used a loophole that helped him sow the seeds of the human race. Though other races used this tactic as well, it was no match for the Primeval Lord of Heaven's plan.
<br><br>
At this time, the Element Spirit race's progress was relatively slow, but they were still able to use Divine Farmer, Yellow Thearch and Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
They ended up taking half of the human forces.
<br><br>
With the assistance of the Element Spirit race, the half human forces had potential to dominate the entire Source World.
<br><br>
Although the Pear Hill was not weak, with the strongest warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace being trapped on the Other Shore, the overall strength of the other half proved to be weaker.
<br><br>
"It doesn't mean that we can't put up a fight," Fuxi expressed with ferocity.
<br><br>
His sudden snap made everyone turn to look at him. It seemed that Fuxi pointed out something no one had thought before.
<br><br>
"Okay, I came here to ask Zen for something," Fuxi strayed away from his earlier topic.
<br><br>
Zen blinked his eyes a few times. "And what is it that you want?"
<br><br>
"The golden red Chaotic Source Spirits."
<br><br>
At the mention of the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, Zen's eyes shot up and pierced through Fuxi.
<br><br>
The first time he came across the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, Zen had high expectations. However, after a long while, he could not figure out how to use them. They didn't seem to be used to strengthen physical bodies.
<br><br>
In order to speed up the process, Zen left some for Yan to study. Zen's eyes softened as he responded, "Master Fuxi, have you figured out how to absorb the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits?"
<br><br>
Fuxi rolled his eyes. "It is obvious that you want to absorb everything. But you don't know that the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits are not used to strengthen your body- they are used to support the Descending Rings."
<br><br>
"The Descending Rings?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and his two companions couldn't help but shake their heads and exchange looks of confusion.
<br><br>
The crystals produced by the Chaotic Source Spirits had effects on strengthening the Other Shore Realm warriors. This was the information the Snake Goddess had obtained from the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree, and it was passed down by the Primeval Lord of Heaven himself.
<br><br>
However, he and other humans from the Other Shore knew nothing about the Descending Rings, and the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess saw that the Primeval Lord of Heaven was a little confused, she immediately said, "Primeval Lord of Heaven, it seems that you are unaware of the change in the Chaotic Source Sea. The Element Spirit race used a method to interfere with the Chaotic Source Spirits, and that is what caused the Descending Rings to appear. Divine Farmer obtained six rings, the Black Ship got three, and Fuxi got the rest three, but... "
<br><br>
She went on to explain everything she knew.
<br><br>
Once she finished speaking, the eyes of the real Snake Goddess, the real Fuxi and the Primeval Lord of Heaven glowed, it was so bright that it resembled starlight.
<br><br>
Seeing this phenomenon, the Snake Goddess's jaw dropped. She had forgotten the desire of the Other Shore creatures to descend...
<br><br>
There was no way that the creatures on the Other Shore could descend from the Other Shore. This law was tough as stone, and had existed since the early years of the Element Spirit Civilization. No one had ever come close to breaking it.
<br><br>
This also meant that the truth would never be violated.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head to the news. "The Descending Rings? Did any Other Shore creature actually descend with it? "
<br><br>
"Yes," Fuxi said as he nodded. "Divine Farmer attempted to make a Moon Fire Slave descend, but he was quickly killed by the truth."
<br><br>
He knew this after he'd seen the Moon Fire Slave descending through the memory of Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
"Killed by the truth..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven murmured to himself, trying to understand what had happened. "This only means that the restrictions were never lifted."
<br><br>
In fact, the biggest problem of the creatures on the Other Shore was not descending. The Primeval Lord of Heaven had taken several opportunities to make uses of the loophole to help the creatures descend.
<br><br>
However, the consequence of being erased by the truth was the problem. No matter what descended, it would be erased by the truth. This kind of descending was meaningless.
<br><br>
Eventually, when the Primeval Lord of Heaven discovered another loophole, his agenda was no longer to "descend". Instead, he sowed the seeds of the human race, which was how the greatest human forces emerged: the Pear Hill, the Oneness Sky Palace, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
"He was killed by the truth due to the lack of golden red Chaotic Source Spirits. Exactly the ones in Zen's hand," Fuxi added. "If the Descending Rings could cooperate with the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, the Other Shore creatures would dodge the truth and completely descend, unharmed."
<br><br>
With a gentle wave of his hand, Zen held out his palm to expose the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits he kept. "I didn't realize these Chaotic Source Spirits have such an effect."
<br><br>
Fuxi stepped forward and grabbed one from Zen's hand, and smiled. "Well, it's just a really good deduction. Next thing we have to do is make sure I'm right."
<br><br>
Chapter 3730 The Augury Dog Fuxi made sure he was well-prepared prior to coming to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
However, the one thing he still needed was the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's hand.
<br><br>
Zen eyed him curiously. "What are you going to summon from the Other Shore?" he asked.
<br><br>
Fuxi simply smiled. "You'll know soon enough," he replied cryptically before tossing the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit in his hand as he sat cross-legged on the step.
<br><br>
The steps on both sides of Eastern Emperor Taiyi were reserved for Pearce and Auden.
<br><br>
Of course, since the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were here, the two naturally had to show their respect and let them sit on the steps.
<br><br>
As Fuxi sat down, the real Fuxi above Zen's head spoke. "Why do I feel like this duplicate is even more arrogant than me?"
<br><br>
In the 77th civilization, Fuxi was known for being an unparalleled warrior but also an extremely arrogant man. His talent was incredibly remarkable and his strength was beyond compare.
<br><br>
The real Snake Goddess and her duplicate smiled, knowing full-well Fuxi's reputation and personality.
<br><br>
Whilst everyone waited, Zen turned to the Snake Goddess. "How are Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasamin on the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
Everyone's faces darkened at the mention of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Shortly after arriving at the Supreme Dragon Hall, the Snake Goddess told everyone present Eastern Emperor Taiyi's situation. She calmly repeated this to Zen. "I immediately got the news when Yasamin got trapped on the Other Shore. With Eastern Emperor Taiyi's invitation, I followed him to save her with no hesitation. Unfortunately, in his haste to save Yasamin, Eastern Emperor Taiyi put himself in danger."
<br><br>
In fact, she was so close to rescuing Eastern Emperor Taiyi some time ago, but her efforts were in vain.
<br><br>
It wasn't easy to get Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi out of harm's way.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi came over not only because of the Descending Rings and the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, but also to impart the news regarding Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill and some masters of the Oneness Sky Palace planned to move all members of the Oneness Sky Palace to the Pear Hill. Pearce, however, did not agree.
<br><br>
If all their members moved into the Pear Hill, it could cause a series of unintended consequences. This matter needed to be planned and considered meticulously.
<br><br>
"Zen has already passed through the Soul City. If he is able to pass through the Land of Bone Tribulation, then he'll be able to reach the Eternal Scroll Painting. Once he does that, our Oneness Sky Palace will finally have an Eternal Warrior who can save Eastern Emperor Taiyi," Athemar remarked with a smile.
<br><br>
After ancient times, there was nobody who was able to become the Eternal Warrior and reach the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
If Zen managed the impossible, then it would no doubt cause quite the stir in the entire Source World.
<br><br>
"If I am able to step into Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, I will definitely go and save Eastern Emperor Taiyi," Zen promised.
<br><br>
His definitive reply made Athemar smile with relief.
<br><br>
At that moment, Fuxi suddenly opened his eyes and retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Descending Ring floated near him along with the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
He gently stretched out his hand and flicked the Chaotic Source Spirit towards the direction of the ring.
<br><br>
"Da!"
<br><br>
In a flash, the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit shot straight towards the Descending Ring.
<br><br>
The moment the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit touched the ring, it quickly melted into golden liquid that flowed around the Descending Ring.
<br><br>
Soon, the entire ring turned golden.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
There was a buzzing noise as the Descending Ring shook and a small creature appeared below.
<br><br>
It was a dog with bright fur and was only the size of a fist.
<br><br>
The dog was extremely adorable but everyone in the Oneness Sky Palace looked at it cautiously.
<br><br>
Its aura was extremely powerful, no weaker than the Snake Goddess' and Fuxi's! The dog opened its eyes and looked around curiously.
<br><br>
"Have I descended?"
<br><br>
Fuxi nodded. "Yes."
<br><br>
He was nervous but there shouldn't be any problems. According to the captain of the Black Ship, directly using the Descending Ring would trigger the punishment of the truth, but making use of the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit would be able to deter such a disaster.
<br><br>
However, this was his first attempt so he couldn't be too sure.
<br><br>
The dog looked around and took in its surroundings. 'So this is the world below. The people around here don't seem to be weak, ' it thought.
<br><br>
This dog was an Other Shore creature within Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Its name was Augury Dog.
<br><br>
The Augury Dog had a good relationship with Fuxi and followed him all the time when the latter reached Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Since it was a creature of the Other Shore and had never entered the Source World, its understanding was limited to Fuxi's stories.
<br><br>
According to what it learned from before, the Source World should be full of weak creatures, but why did the people in this place seem so powerful? Fuxi smiled at the Augury Dog. "The Source World is bigger than you think..."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, an invisible wave appeared on top of the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
The powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace could feel just how powerful this wave was. Even the Other Shore Realm warriors and civilians were aware of it, having subconsciously lifted their heads towards the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The dog's face paled as the power seemed to be aimed at itself.
<br><br>
"It shouldn't be..." Fuxi mumbled with a dark expression.
<br><br>
"Swoosh..."
<br><br>
This sudden wave of truth energy was so powerful that it was enough to destroy heaven and earth. It swept over their heads and quickly went away, not landing on the dog at all.
<br><br>
"Awoo!"
<br><br>
The Augury Dog couldn't help but let out a roar after noticing that the crisis had passed.
<br><br>
Fuxi himself breathed a sigh of relief. "It's done!"
<br><br>
The real Snake Goddess, the real Fuxi, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were also obviously pleased and excited at the result.
<br><br>
The truth energy had descended and they knew better than anyone what this meant.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, if you could descend to the Source World, then you'd be able to preside over the situation. You'd be able to lead the human race towards prosperity!" The Snake Goddess rejoiced. "I just don't know which realm of the Three Purities Stage you're in. If I join hands with Fuxi, perhaps we can help you out..."
<br><br>
He now had the means to descend, but, there was an even bigger problem.
<br><br>
The outstanding human heroes had also been trapped there for a long time.
<br><br>
So many chaotic eras had passed but all efforts the Primeval Lord of Heaven made were in vain.
<br><br>
He sported a bitter smile on his face. "We are trapped in the Jade Pure Realm."
<br><br>
Everyone's hearts lurched at the mention of the words "Jade Pure Realm".
<br><br>
The Three Purities Stage was divided into the Grand Pure Realm, the Supreme Pure Realm, and the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
The Augury Dog belonged to the outermost layer: the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Those who could enter the Supreme Pure Realm were supernormal to the Augury Dog's eyes. How could this old man in front of it reach the Jade Pure Realm? That place only existed in legends the Augury Dog had learned. Some people were able to enter this realm but none ever came out.
<br><br>
Chapter 3731 Summon A Powerful Warrior From Other Shore It was known that before the human civilization came to life, the Element Spirit Civilization was relatively open.
<br><br>
In fact, they even "helped" other civilizations that just arrived at the Other Shore back then.
<br><br>
However, the price for their "help" was that those civilizations could not threaten the Element Spirit Civilization. Besides, as the second civilization, the Element Spirit Civilization had many advantages, thus they were much more powerful than the other civilizations.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the concept of the Finale Way had already existed in the first few chaotic eras. But the members of the Element Spirit Civilization internally agreed that it was a ridiculous idea.
<br><br>
All the time, the whole Element Spirit Civilization only watched the other civilizations struggle on the Other Shore amusingly.
<br><br>
It wasn't until the birth of the human civilization that the Element Spirit Civilization felt a sense of trepidation.
<br><br>
Most civilizations felt that to step into Stage Thirty-three was enough to prove their strength. After all, it wasn't easy for even the Chaos Ancient Gods or the Wing King to explore that stage much deeper.
<br><br>
Indeed, there were only about eight races that had reached the innermost part of the stage, the Jade Pure Realm, up until now. Those eight races were quite ancient and were considered legendary.
<br><br>
That was also the reason why the Augury Dog was surprised.
<br><br>
"I believed that our human race was extraordinary when I obtained the unique information from the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree. However, I didn't expect that you would reach the Jade Pure Realm…" At that moment, the Snake Goddess' eyes glinted.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Primeval Lord of Heaven looked calm. He shook his head and said, "Truth be told, it isn't that none of those civilizations that came after us couldn't surpass our human civilization—it's just that the Element Spirit Civilization never gave them a chance."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded firmly and added, "If they finish the Purge Way as they planned, then there will be no chance for the entire chaos to survive in the end."
<br><br>
A faint smile graced the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face. "That's not necessarily the case. The degree of chaos will always increase and never decrease. According to their plan on the Purge Way, it will only greatly delay the development of chaos..." he said.
<br><br>
In general, all the activities in the world were in constant chaos. Every time another round of chaos began, the degree of chaos always increased.
<br><br>
If only ten thousand creatures were to survive the Purge Way of the Element Spirit Civilization, then the increase of chaos would naturally slow down.
<br><br>
However, as long as even one creature was alive, then it would always increase.
<br><br>
Perhaps after thousands of chaotic eras, the Finale Way would still need to be done...
<br><br>
Therefore, the Primeval Lord of Heaven reasoned that the Purge Way of the Element Spirit Civilization was not a solution, but a way of delay. Whatever was supposed to come would still come.
<br><br>
Upon hearing the Primeval Lord of Heaven's words, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Zen, Pearce, and the others present also felt quite enlightened.
<br><br>
Although all of them firmly believed in the Finale Way, some part of them agreed with the concept of the Purge Way and thought that it was another way to save the chaos, even if it was too cruel.
<br><br>
Based on the Primeval Lord of Heaven's analysis, they understood that Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer had chosen the wrong path from the very beginning, and that path was destined to fail.
<br><br>
"It's a pity that Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch stubbornly chose the wrong course," said Pearce with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
"Some people are just like that. They could never realize that they are wrong by themselves. They need to be slapped awake," Fuxi said nonchalantly.
<br><br>
Pearce's face lit up when he heard Fuxi's words. "Are you saying that you people of Pear Hill will take action?" he asked.
<br><br>
After the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race had a fall-out with each other, they only had the occasional trivial fights. Also, Pear Hill had never fought head-on because there were rules. As a result, the Sun Crow race launched a surprise attack, and the Oneness Sky Palace almost suffered a catastrophe.
<br><br>
Thus, the Oneness Sky Palace must be lying if they ever said that their people felt no resentment at all.
<br><br>
Then again, they had no other choice but to endure as Eastern Emperor Taiyi was still trapped.
<br><br>
But, it was true that they would be happy if Pear Hill did do something.
<br><br>
"If Pear Hill kept tolerating them, of course, they would come to torment us someday. Actually, when the Sun Crow race took action this time, it meant that the war had begun.
<br><br>
The most important reason is that what they are doing currently is completely unbearable," said the Snake Goddess. "What? What they are doing now?" Pearce asked cautiously.
<br><br>
"They used a strange kind of flame to burn many provinces of the Source World. That flame didn't damage the warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm, but the ordinary creatures at or below the Other Shore Realm. They have already set fire in three hundred provinces in succession," the Snake Goddess explained.
<br><br>
"What? How could they do such a brutal thing?"
<br><br>
"Why did they do that? Is it just to clean up those big provinces?"
<br><br>
"Is Yellow Thearch crazy?"
<br><br>
The strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace felt distressed at the news.
<br><br>
Even if the Bearing race was quite powerful, they couldn't just slaughter lives recklessly like that! While everyone was still confused, Master Hai, who was on the far left of the Supreme Dragon Hall, suddenly said, "Usman, I'm afraid that's their purpose."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded at him, which showed that he was right.
<br><br>
Master Hai's reminder made the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace quickly realize why the Bearing race did such a thing.
<br><br>
"Trigger the negative emotions of the Source World!"
<br><br>
"Have they got Usman?"
<br><br>
"The Yellow Thearch's plan all along was to control the entire Source World through Usman..."
<br><br>
At that point, everyone's fears and anxieties further intensified.
<br><br>
Now that the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill could ally with other super forces to fight against the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race, the outcome of the battle was hard to predict. After all, both sides were on the same level.
<br><br>
But if Yellow Thearch took control of the Source World, it would be as if he started a war on a higher level, wherein he would launch much deadlier attacks.
<br><br>
"Although Usman is the incarnation of the negative emotions of the Source World, he is still just an incarnation. Whether or not he can shake the will of the Source World is only a guess, and nobody knows if he would succeed.
<br><br>
Everyone, calm down," the Snake Goddess said and raised her hand to placate everyone present.
<br><br>
The Source World was the primitive land of this round of chaos. Its will was superior and unfathomable.
<br><br>
Yet, ever since Usman was born, many wise warriors had made assumptions, such as one might be able to control the Source World through its negative emotions.
<br><br>
Before the current situation, everyone else thought that such an assumption was only a theory —but now Yellow Thearch began to try it out.
<br><br>
"It seems that things don't look good," someone sighed.
<br><br>
Many of the people's faces dimmed at the comment.
<br><br>
Zen, who had been quietly standing at the side, suddenly smiled and said, "The situation might be not as bad as you think.
<br><br>
Now that we have Descending Rings, we will be able to summon a powerful warrior from the Other Shore!" "Which stage of the Other Shore does the warrior you said we could ask for help come from?" the Snake Goddess asked as she gazed at him with her beautiful eyes.
<br><br>
"We can summon Ziya, who is King Manard I told you about last time,"
<br><br>
answered Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3732 Have A Try The last time Zen was in Pear Hill, he had taught the Snake Goddess the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
Although the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were quick to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way, they still needed more time.
<br><br>
Even if Zen had already found the human race on the Other Shore and had been to the Deleting Space again, the Snake Goddess still hadn't completely mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, so she naturally didn't have the chance to meet King Manard.
<br><br>
On the other hand, King Manard, namely Ziya Jiang, used to be a master at the Eternal Realm. Moreover, he had stayed in the Deleting Space for over a thousand chaotic eras, so he was strong surely.
<br><br>
If he could descend, then he would undoubtedly become the strongest warrior in the Source World! "Yes… King Manard can descend…" the Snake Goddess murmured.
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes lit up upon hearing her words. "Is it that master who's trapped in the Deleting Space?" he asked.
<br><br>
Fuxi was known to be jealous of anyone who was stronger than him, but he was still an upright and kind-hearted man. He was definitely on the side of the human race.
<br><br>
"We can try to let Ziya descend. I wonder if the Descending Ring is suitable for the Deleting Space..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a nod.
<br><br>
Zen smiled and walked straight towards Fuxi. He stretched out his hand and said, "We'll know if it works or not after we try."
<br><br>
With a flick of Fuxi's finger, a Descending Ring floated in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Under the crowd's watchful eyes, Zen sat cross-legged and put the golden red Chaotic Source Spirit into the ring. Then, he began to recite the Truth of Three-Energy Construction and soon returned to the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
These days, Ziya had been accompanying Geoffrey to explore the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He had been shocked at Geoffrey's performance when the latter had entered the Abstruse Energy World for the first time. After that, Geoffrey continued to surprise him as they continued to explore the world together.
<br><br>
When Ziya had previously explored the mountain on his own, he felt like a blind man who entered a forest. Every step he took had been so difficult.
<br><br>
He could only rely on his superior memory and analysis to make up for what he lacked.
<br><br>
His exploration was extremely time-consuming and exhausting. Therefore, he didn't get to cross the mountain though so many years had passed, let alone cross that river.
<br><br>
However, Geoffrey changed everything.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, Geoffrey's perception was completely different from Ziya's. It was like his eyes were born to distinguish the paths of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He had thoroughly understood the whole mountain's situation in only a few days. He had solved all of Ziya's puzzles within a short amount of time.
<br><br>
Ziya's only regret was that Geoffrey was right when he said that the mountain didn't have any resources and he wasn't interested in it.
<br><br>
They proceeded to cross the river next. As Geoffrey led him, Ziya crossed the river and began to explore further.
<br><br>
Truthfully, he was still half unaware of everything about the Abstruse Energy World, and Geoffrey had to lead him almost all the way.
<br><br>
After several explorations, they finally got something new. Ziya's understanding and guess of the Abstruse Energy World increased with each passing day. During the explorations, he had some contradicting thoughts.
<br><br>
He wanted to get in touch with the creatures in the Abstruse Energy World, and more importantly, he wanted to know about the civilization of this world.
<br><br>
Yet, the Abstruse Energy World wasn't as safe as it looked. Many times during their explorations, it was Geoffrey who found the dangers ahead of time and rushed with him, which allowed him to escape back to the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Even though the Abstruse Energy World was dangerous, it was still fascinating. Ziya even treated Geoffrey like a rare treasure.
<br><br>
He tried his best to meet any requests Geoffrey made, as long as they were within his abilities.
<br><br>
When Zen returned to the Deleting Space, he saw that another magnificent and exquisite palace had been built on the other side of the Deleting Pillars.
<br><br>
Of course, the palace was for Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Even if Ziya was omnipotent in this space, it still took him a lot of effort to build such a palace out of thin air with the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
Zen waited in front of the palace for a while. Then, Ziya appeared in front of him through the space fluctuation.
<br><br>
Back then, Ziya had always acted like he was a transcendent being whenever he was in front of Zen. This time, however, he was completely different. He jovially smiled as if he was good friends with Zen.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen was confused, but he respectfully asked, "Master Ziya, where is Geoffrey?"
<br><br>
"He is still in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He has been staying there for the past few days," replied Ziya. "Will he be in danger as he is alone?" Zen asked again worriedly.
<br><br>
He would be lying if he said he wasn't worried about Geoffrey when he handed him over to Ziya.
<br><br>
Ziya patted his head and said, "We've encountered several dangers recently, but that kid escaped the Abstruse Energy World at such an amazing speed every time. He should be fine."
<br><br>
The space in the Abstruse Energy World existed in a very special form, so Ziya couldn't understand the way Geoffrey moved.
<br><br>
When Zen saw that Ziya was sure of his words, he felt slightly reassured.
<br><br>
After all, Ziya had been in the Abstruse Energy World for so many years.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Geoffrey was like a fish in the water when he was in the Abstruse Energy World, so it meant that he could protect himself.
<br><br>
"This time, I didn't come to see Geoffrey," said Zen.
<br><br>
"What happened?" Naturally, Ziya was confused. He thought that Zen was eager to come back because he was worried about his son.
<br><br>
"I want to invite you to descend to the Source World," replied Zen.
<br><br>
Ziya's eyes widened to the size of saucers. "Descend? That's too dangerous!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
In reality, his control over the space could allow him to go to the chaos on his own.
<br><br>
But something happened to him before. Many chaotic eras ago, he had tried to throw the things which were created in his inner world into the chaos.
<br><br>
However, the second he did so, the things he threw triggered the truth and eventually disappeared. He had given up doing that since then.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen noticed Ziya's hesitation, he told him about the descent of the Augury Dog and took out the Descending Ring.
<br><br>
When Ziya was still unsure, the Primeval Lord of Heaven appeared again.
<br><br>
He smiled and said, "You have always been cautious, and cautiousness ensures safety. After all, the Deleting Space is still a bit different from the Other Shore..."
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Ziya stretched out his hand and brought out a dark cyan toad from his inner world.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Supreme Dragon Hall, everyone silently waited for the master who was to descend from the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
As Zen opened his eyes, a cyan toad appeared under the Descending Ring.
<br><br>
Everyone's expressions became more unreadable at that moment, and the entire hall became even quieter. Since they had met the Augury Dog, which descended from Stage Thirty-three once, many of them thought that the toad was that master they were waiting for.
<br><br>
A violent wave came from the sky, but the toad avoided the punishment of the truth. Once Zen had confirmed that it was safe, he returned to the Deleting Space. A few seconds later, Ziya finally appeared in the Supreme Dragon Hall.
<br><br>
Chapter 3733 Dorothy's Situation Ziya had lived for a long time. It was only natural that he emitted a strong aura of vicissitudes when he descended into the Source World.
<br><br>
His aura was completely different from that of the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
While the latter gave people the impression that he was someone full of wisdom and knowledge, Ziya seemed like the aggressive sort.
<br><br>
Back when the Primeval Lord of Heaven created the Enlightenment Sect, he had entrusted Ziya with an important post. In fact, these masters of the human race could successfully become Eternal Warriors and reach the Eternal Realm because of Ziya.
<br><br>
When the many powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace sensed the man's aggressive aura, their expressions shifted.
<br><br>
In terms of cultivation alone, Ziya was merely an Eternal Warrior. But his aura was far stronger than that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess. Was he the powerful master that had descended from the Deleting Space? "I really didn't expect to come back after over a thousand chaotic eras…"
<br><br>
Ziya strolled along the Supreme Dragon Hall before cupping his hands toward the Primeval Lord of Heaven above Zen's head. "Master, may I have a look at this world?"
<br><br>
"Of course," the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded.
<br><br>
Once Ziya took a single step forward, everyone was blinded by a white flash of light. They felt nearly no fluctuation in the space, but the man had completely disappeared from the hall.
<br><br>
High up in the sky of the Bloom Divine Province, Ziya stood atop the clouds, overlooking the vast land.
<br><br>
In the Deleting Space, Ziya had absolute freedom. But it was a mere recycle bin to the chaos. The Land of Ashes, which was its another name, was a place where garbage and ashes belonged.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Once Ziya took a deep breath, the clouds within a hundred thousand-mile radius surged rapidly toward his stomach.
<br><br>
Once the clouds dissipated, everything in the Bloom Divine Province came into view.
<br><br>
When leveled roads and plains were all he could see, a strange look came over Ziya's face. The shape of the world was far from what he had imagined.
<br><br>
In the 77th chaos, the human civilization was established among vast starry regions, while the Source World was much like a giant egg. Every large province was about the size of a starry region.
<br><br>
After taking some time to observe, Ziya returned to the Supreme Dragon Hall and bowed to the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "I've already observed this world, but I still hold much doubt in my heart…"
<br><br>
"If you have any questions, just ask," urged the Primeval Lord of Heaven with a smile.
<br><br>
And so the Snake Goddess came forward and answered the questions about the general situation of the Source World.
<br><br>
Once Ziya picked up more information, the Snake Goddess continued, "Because Eastern Emperor Taiyi is trapped on the Other Shore, the Oneness Sky Palace is in danger without any Eternal Warrior to guard it. But the people of the Oneness Sky Palace have no intention of moving to the Pear Hill, so now, they need a powerful warrior to guard it."
<br><br>
When Pearce, Auden and the other elders of the Oneness Sky Palace heard the Snake Goddess' words, their eyes suddenly lit up.
<br><br>
Moving the Oneness Sky Palace to the Pear Hill was far too big a project, not to mention the fact that the Oneness Sky Palace was already in a state of panic. There was no guarantee that they could avoid trouble during the migration process.
<br><br>
If there was truly such a powerful warrior around to fill Easter Emperor Taiyi's vacancy to guard the palace, everyone would feel at ease.
<br><br>
"If Master Ziya could guard the Oneness Sky Palace, we'd surely be very grateful. So would Easter Emperor Taiyi!"
<br><br>
"Please stay!"
<br><br>
Auden and Pearce cupped their hands and begged in unison.
<br><br>
Much to their surprise, Ziya said, "But I still have something important to take care of in the Deleting Space."
<br><br>
Returning to chaos was a unique experience for Ziya, but his focus was still on the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Seeing the disappointment in Pearce's and the others' eyes, Zen took a step forward and said, "Master Ziya, I know you have many affairs to deal with in the Deleting Space. But if a strong enemy approaches to attack us, I will help you descend. Is this okay with you?"
<br><br>
At that, Ziya was overjoyed. "Yes, that will do!"
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi's physical body was currently still in the Oneness Sky Palace. If he let the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi possess his body, his strength wouldn't be inferior to that of any Eternal Warrior. With Ziya's help, the Oneness Sky Palace could naturally grow more stable.
<br><br>
This time, when Fuxi came, Zen handed over half of the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits while simultaneously obtaining a Descending Ring.
<br><br>
Before Fuxi left, he also warned Zen that the Black Ship had three Descending Rings. He was forced to hand over the thirty golden red Chaotic Source Spirits Zen had given to Yan so that the Black Ship could also summon the Other Shore creatures to descend into Source World.
<br><br>
Now, the most grim were likely the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
They had another six Descending Rings in their hands, but because they lacked the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, they couldn't summon the Other Shore creatures to the Source World.
<br><br>
In the Chaotic Source World, many people knew of Zen having obtained the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits. The Yellow Thearch could easily take notice of the fact and target Zen for an attack.
<br><br>
After giving Zen a warning, Fuxi threw a small Eight-Diagram disc to him —it was a voice-transmitting tool of the Pear Hill. Even if Zen was several provinces away from Fuxi, it could still send him a message instantly. Fuxi gave Zen the tool for the purpose that if something went wrong, Zen could ask him for help immediately.
<br><br>
After everything was arranged, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess left with the warriors of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Zen was also prepared to return to the Flow Sword Sect and continue to explore the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Just before leaving the Supreme Dragon Hall, his gaze suddenly fell on Winchell, bringing Dorothy to mind.
<br><br>
Since Yasamin was trapped, Dorothy hadn't participated in the war with the Sun Crow race, nor had she appeared on the Other Shore. "Master Winchell, how has Dorothy been recently?" Zen asked when he walked up to Winchell.
<br><br>
"She's not good," replied the latter slowly, wearing a heavy expression.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Zen frowned.
<br><br>
Winchell smiled faintly and said, "If you want to know, I'm afraid you'll have to personally pay a visit to the Origin Mountain and have a look. We don't know what happened to her. If the Primeval Lord of Heaven could take a look at her, we'd be very grateful."
<br><br>
The words 'very grateful' lingered in Zen's ears, sounding somewhat ironic.
<br><br>
Part of the reason Zen joined the Oneness Sky Palace was because of his acquaintance with Dorothy, after all. Zen's relationship with her only grew closer after that.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the people of the Origin Mountain, Zen was now the most popular in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
It wasn't right that he had completely forgotten about Dorothy, even if he was busy exploring the Soul City.
<br><br>
"You're being too polite, Master Winchell," Zen said anxiously. "Please allow me to go with you."
<br><br>
And under Winchell's lead, Zen headed to the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
In front of the emerald green palace atop the mountain, Felicity guarded the gate.
<br><br>
Anger flashed across her eyes when she saw Winchell bringing Zen along.
<br><br>
"Why did you bring this guy here? Take him away!"
<br><br>
Winchell was a person who would pay attention to the interests of the whole Oneness Sky Palace. Objectively speaking, Zen owed nothing to the Origin Mountain. On the other hand, thanks to Zen, the entire Oneness Sky Palace avoided complete destruction.
<br><br>
But Felicity thought differently.
<br><br>
Chapter 3734 A Dangerous Door Felicity felt anger welling inside her.
<br><br>
Seeing what was happening, Winchell felt a little embarrassed. In a low voice, he hissed at her. "Felicity!"
<br><br>
Despite Winchell scolding her, Felicity just snorted, "Outsiders are not welcome here."
<br><br>
With an embarrassed look on his face, Zen walked up to Felicity to try to reason with her. "Aunt Felicity, I'm sorry. I didn't know that something happened to Dorothy. So please, let me see her first, okay?"
<br><br>
Zen said sincerely.
<br><br>
He and Dorothy had been through a lot together. Dorothy had accompanied him from the Sea of Truth all the way to Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Moreover, she had saved his life before.
<br><br>
After glaring at Zen for a while, Felicity finally stood up. With a gloomy expression, she begrudgingly gestured for Zen to follow her.
<br><br>
Then, she led Zen into the palace.
<br><br>
The palace was not too big. After passing through a hallway, they arrived at the inner hall already.
<br><br>
Upon entering the hall, Zen's eyes fell on Dorothy, who was at the center of the hall. He gasped in shock once he saw her.
<br><br>
On the surface of her body were tiny lines, which flashed with luster. It was as though beneath her chapped skin were glowing gems.
<br><br>
The lines emitted faint red light, but the energy condensed within the red light was extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
Zen was now a powerful warrior in the twenty-ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm. He had three Civilization Artifacts under control and had seen extremely powerful forces. However, almost none of the forces he had ever seen was comparable to what he was seeing now in Dorothy.
<br><br>
"The energy in her body is so powerful..." Zen whispered. He was absolutely floored.
<br><br>
Standing behind him, Winchell said, "Once the energy bursts out, it'll be enough to raze the entire Bloom Divine Province."
<br><br>
Zen's heart skipped a beat. "It's that powerful?!"
<br><br>
"And the energy in her body continues to increase every day," Felicity added.
<br><br>
Ever since Yasamin got trapped on the Other Shore, Dorothy had fallen into a depression.
<br><br>
She no longer went to the Land of Sword Grief, but spent all her time by Yasamin's side.
<br><br>
Felicity recalled there was a time she came to visit Dorothy, but Dorothy was busy thinking about how to save her grandmother.
<br><br>
Back then, Felicity thought that Dorothy was just wishfully thinking.
<br><br>
After all, Dorothy was not able to pass through the Land of Bone Tribulation, let alone become an Eternal Warrior. There was no way she could rescue Yasamin! To Felicity's surprise, however, Dorothy had resigned herself to meditation since that day. Till now, she hadn't woken up yet.
<br><br>
But during this period of meditation, Dorothy's aura grew more and more powerful with each day that passed. Simultaneously, her skin cracked little by little each day, revealing more lines.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The shadow of the Primeval Lord of Heaven once again appeared above Zen's head.
<br><br>
Winchell felt a glimmer of hope. The reason why he had lured Zen here in the first place was because he had wanted the Primeval Lord of Heaven to take a look at Dorothy.
<br><br>
If even the Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't figure out the reason behind what was going on, then perhaps no one in the world could.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, why are these lines appearing on the surface of Dorothy's body?" Zen asked the question on everyone's minds.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven observed Dorothy carefully for a while.
<br><br>
"There seems to be many divine megatons of force in her body. Has she made use of any Other Shore Token?"
<br><br>
Theoretically speaking, if anyone wanted to possess power as great as the energy emanating from Dorothy, they needed to have an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
It was already very difficult to possess one divine megaton of force with means from the Source World.
<br><br>
"Since she's been on the Other Shore, I doubt she has used any Other Shore Token." Winchell frowned.
<br><br>
The only possibility was that Dorothy had released some kind of Other Shore Token before she had entered the Other Shore, but it was highly unlikely.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven contemplated in silence. It seemed, even he couldn't understand the scene in front of him.
<br><br>
Even though he was extremely knowledgeable, he was not omniscient.
<br><br>
There were many unsolved mysteries about the Source World and even the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Did anything suspicious happen previously?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
Winchell shook his head. "She entered the Other Shore Realm together with Zen. She is an outstanding talent among the members of the Origin Mountain. However, other than that, there's nothing special about her."
<br><br>
As Winchell spoke, Felicity gave him a hesitant look.
<br><br>
She didn't believe that there was nothing special about Dorothy.
<br><br>
Dorothy thought she was the biological granddaughter of Yasamin.
<br><br>
However, this was not the case.
<br><br>
Dorothy's bloodline had been inherited from Yasamin through a special way. When she was young, she had taken Yasamin's unique Blood Upgrading Pill, so that her bloodline had been enhanced to a very high level.
<br><br>
So technically, Dorothy was just an adopted granddaughter of Yasamin.
<br><br>
Yet, Yasamin seemed to have grown fond of her. Having been with each other for many years, Yasamin and Dorothy had a strong bond. But there must have been a deeper reason as to why Yasamin decided to adopt Dorothy.
<br><br>
But alas, no one else knew what the hidden reason was.
<br><br>
Just as the Primeval Lord of Heaven studied Dorothy's body, Zen suddenly clapped his hands as though he remembered something important. "I've once seen a closed door in the depths of her soul. That was in Stage One of the Other Shore. Is it possible that was an Other Shore Token?"
<br><br>
At the time, Zen had been confused as to why such a door was hidden in the depth of Dorothy's soul. Despite his initial confusion, he had never given it any further thought.
<br><br>
Now that he thought about Dorothy carefully, he suddenly remembered how an Other Shore Token could be fused with one's soul.
<br><br>
But at that time, they had just entered the Other Shore Realm. It was unlikely she had a chance to carry any token.
<br><br>
"A door? What kind of door was it?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked curiously.
<br><br>
Zen closed his eyes and searched through the Memory Flame. Then, he plucked an ink brush and a scroll of paper out from thin air, and began to wave his hand.
<br><br>
When one's soul was strong enough, it was easy to navigate through the memories within the Memory Flame.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! As the ink brush danced over the paper, it started to draw very vividly a door with a strange shape.
<br><br>
When the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw the door, his face suddenly changed color. "Zen, are you sure this is what you saw?"
<br><br>
"Yes," said Zen firmly.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't conceal his shock. "This is the door to another world, and also the most dangerous door in all the thirty-three stages of the Other Shore..."
<br><br>
"The most dangerous door?"
<br><br>
Zen echoed in a daze. The corner of his mouth twitched. He was so anxious that he didn't even take notice of the first part of the sentence— It was the door to another world.
<br><br>
Dorothy had no idea what would happen if she opened this door.
<br><br>
She had never tried opening it, since Yasamin had warned her not to. She was always obedient to her grandmother, and trusted every word she said.
<br><br>
However, now that Yasamin was on the verge of death, Dorothy saw that she had no other option.
<br><br>
As soon as she entered the Other Shore, she headed straight for the door without any hesitation.
<br><br>
She was keenly aware that monsters were on the other side of that door.
<br><br>
This she knew because more than once she had seen eerie, slender arms and demonic scarlet eyes from the hole on the door.
<br><br>
The instant Dorothy opened the door, she saw a dark passage within it.
<br><br>
Somehow, she felt drawn towards it, as though there was some source of power hidden in its depths.
<br><br>
After a moment's hesitation, Dorothy walked past the door's threshold determinedly.
<br><br>
The door was opened in the Myriad Spirits City in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. It appeared for only a moment before it quietly disappeared with Dorothy.
<br><br>
Chapter 3735 The Monsters In The Passageway After Dorothy stepped into the door, the smell of sweet rust filled her nose, even before her eyes adjusted to the darkness.
<br><br>
Frowning, she felt a sense of confusion.
<br><br>
"How come I can smell at all?" she pondered aloud.
<br><br>
She was just a Soul of Light which didn't have a sense of smell...
<br><br>
But to her surprise, when she looked herself up and down, she seemed no longer an ordinary Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Her soul body was filled with red threads which glowed like a lustrous ruby.
<br><br>
These red threads formed veins on her neck, arms, and legs, and even formed outlines of her internal organs, eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.
<br><br>
"What... happened to me?"
<br><br>
Dorothy took a few steps back in fear, instinctively bolting back to the door.
<br><br>
However, at the thought of her grandmother, the fear in her heart dissolved like snow in the summer.
<br><br>
No matter what kind of fate was waiting for her, she was willing to accept it.
<br><br>
If Dorothy had been to the Soul City, she would have found that everything that was happening to her Soul of Light was very similar to stepping into the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
The only difference was that she didn't need to enter the soul cloud; she only had to step through the door.
<br><br>
Since her soul now had gained the five senses, she became more sensitive to the illusions around her. She could even see the dark passageway before her quite clearly.
<br><br>
"Are these...prisons?" She frowned.
<br><br>
On both sides of the passageway, countless rooms separated by menacing fences lined the path.
<br><br>
The fences closest to the door were all broken. It seemed that someone or something had escaped the prison.
<br><br>
Dorothy continued to move forward cautiously along the passageway, her gaze constantly sweeping across the rooms on both sides. She needed to be vigilant now.
<br><br>
"All of them are empty...
<br><br>
Have all the things locked in them run away? But I have seen those monsters before."
<br><br>
In her eyes, those monsters represented fear.
<br><br>
When she was young, she often woke up screaming from nightmares of these monsters...
<br><br>
Yet, at the same time, these monsters also represented strength.
<br><br>
She needed strength. She knew she was only going to get it through these monsters. Clenching her fist, she knew she wanted to face them.
<br><br>
As she kept walking, she passed by more and more empty cages. She couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed. After all, she had summoned up the courage to open the door, only to be greeted by empty prisons. This was not what she had expected.
<br><br>
Just as she passed by another empty room, she suddenly heard a rustling sound coming from up ahead.
<br><br>
She quickened her pace, her heart beating rapidly.
<br><br>
As soon as she approached the iron fence, a big hand covered in thick fur suddenly grabbed at the metal bars. "Bang!"
<br><br>
All the fences shook violently.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang, Bang..."
<br><br>
"Awoo..."
<br><br>
When the other monsters heard this, they too rushed towards the fences.
<br><br>
They pounded on the metal bars aggressively, howling and shrieking in frustration.
<br><br>
The entire passageway became noisy at this moment. Squinting through the darkness, Dorothy thought she saw something in the distance. To her horror, she realized it was a humongous monster's mouth, gaping widely. Its surging aura forced Dorothy to take a few steps backward.
<br><br>
The monsters in the prisons began to scream excitedly, as though they were alerting something.
<br><br>
From the depths of the darkness, two rays of red light suddenly appeared.
<br><br>
The red lights suddenly grew nearer and nearer, quickly closing the distance between them and Dorothy.
<br><br>
As the monster approached, Dorothy could finally see its face clearly.
<br><br>
It looked like a huge monkey. Its limbs were long and dangling, covered in thick fur that hung low above the ground. Its fingers had dangerously sharp nails that scratched the earth as it ran towards her.
<br><br>
Dorothy's eyes widened. It was the same monster that had observed her from the door countless times before! "You... I'm here now," Dorothy said cautiously.
<br><br>
She wanted to find out who it was.
<br><br>
Somehow, she felt as though she knew it from before.
<br><br>
It had observed her many times, and she had also observed it many times.
<br><br>
Somehow, it didn't seem appropriate for her to ask this question.
<br><br>
The monster stretched out its long arms, and its sharp nails were extended towards Dorothy.
<br><br>
Even in the dark, the monster's nails glinted menacingly. Dorothy had no doubt that this monster could easily rip her into shreds.
<br><br>
However, it stopped abruptly and knelt down on one knee before her.
<br><br>
"We... We've been waiting for so many years," it stammered, as though exhausted. "It's so painful. Please fulfill your promise and help us!"
<br><br>
Its voice was hoarse, like two pieces of rusty iron rubbing against each other.
<br><br>
But Dorothy saw past its strange voice. She could tell that this monster was...begging her.
<br><br>
"Help you?"
<br><br>
Dorothy's eyes were filled with confusion.
<br><br>
"The curses on our bodies have lasted for too long. Many of my companions couldn't hold on any longer and all ended their lives. I dragged them out of the prisons and buried them..." the monster responded woefully.
<br><br>
Now, Dorothy had new pieces to her puzzle.
<br><br>
The monsters in the rooms had been locked away here, cursed to wait for her arrival.
<br><br>
However, it seemed she had gotten there a little too late.
<br><br>
The big holes on the fences must've been created by this monkey-like monster in front of her. The monsters hadn't escaped, instead they had been buried...
<br><br>
"I don't know how to remove your curses," Dorothy said slowly.
<br><br>
Her mind was whirling. Her grandmother, Yasamin, was well aware that she had this door, and that she could order around the monsters within it.
<br><br>
However, her grandmother had never mentioned what this door meant, or what her relationship was with these monsters.
<br><br>
Maybe, even Yasamin didn't know...
<br><br>
As soon as Dorothy finished speaking, the monsters on both sides of the passageway immediately roared in despair.
<br><br>
Her answer did not satisfy them.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The monster swiped at her, enveloping her tiny soul in its massive fist.
<br><br>
"Impossible! How could you not know?" The monster's voice was filled with indignation. "This is not what we agreed on. You should have saved us!"
<br><br>
The monster was extremely powerful. With a simple flick of its wrist, it could squeeze Dorothy to death.
<br><br>
She felt as though she were a fragile porcelain doll in its hand.
<br><br>
"Awoo... Awoo..."
<br><br>
The voice of the monsters on both sides of the passageway gradually sounded the same.
<br><br>
"Do you hear them?" The monster's grating voice continued. "They said if you couldn't do it, they would kill you... They have been in despair for too long. They don't care about killing off their last bit of hope!"
<br><br>
Dorothy trembled. She knew that this was not only a threat, but a bared truth.
<br><br>
She had grown up blissfully, with a rather uneventful childhood. Never in her wildest dreams would she have imagined that this whole time, these monsters had been hoping for her to come.
<br><br>
Even as she stepped through that door, she had known nothing about it.
<br><br>
She sympathized with them. Desperately, she too wished she knew how to lift the curse.
<br><br>
"Hoo... Hoo..."
<br><br>
Just as everyone was clamoring, they suddenly heard a sharp voice from the depths of the darkness.
<br><br>
The master of the voice seemed to be very authoritative. The instant it spoke, the passageway instantly grew silent.
<br><br>
Biting her lips, Dorothy muttered apologetically, "I really don't know..."
<br><br>
"Purr... Hoo..."
<br><br>
the voice in the distance continued grunting.
<br><br>
The monster that held Dorothy in its hand listened for a while before dropping her onto the ground. Its tone slightly softened. "Follow me..."
<br><br>
Chapter 3736 Two Doors Under this circumstance, Dorothy was left no other choice.
<br><br>
All she could do was to follow this tall and strong monster.
<br><br>
They walked through more than ten thousand feet of passageway with rooms on either side filled with monsters with long hair.
<br><br>
At every room she passed, the monsters would rattle the bars in their excitement and anger.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Dorothy felt deep inside her that she had a debt to pay them.
<br><br>
Perhaps she owed them something in her previous life and now was the time to repay them for it...
<br><br>
They walked ten thousand feet more when a faint voice came from a room on the left. It was the one who had given the order.
<br><br>
Dorothy approached the cell and saw a long-haired monster whose hair had turned white. Its body was half the size of an ordinary long-haired monster, and it seemed weak and frail.
<br><br>
But the white-haired monster appeared to be highly respected. At the very least, the others obeyed it.
<br><br>
It observed Dorothy for a moment before asking, "Have you really forgotten everything?"
<br><br>
Dorothy nodded and replied honestly, "I remember nothing but this door..."
<br><br>
"Hoo..."
<br><br>
The white-haired monster sighed. "That makes sense. If you remembered anything, you would have come here a long time ago. Coming here is your only way to get home."
<br><br>
"Get home?" Dorothy's eyes widened. "Was I born here?"
<br><br>
The white-haired monster shook its head and pointed not far ahead where there was a fork in the passageway.
<br><br>
At the fork was a door on the left and a door on the right.
<br><br>
"The door on the left is your way home," the white-haired monster said.
<br><br>
Dorothy blinked in uneasiness, her heartbeat quickening, and she asked, "What about the door on the right?"
<br><br>
"That door leads to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore," the white-haired monster replied.
<br><br>
Dorothy narrowed her eyes on hearing this.
<br><br>
Upon learning her grandmother was in danger, she wanted little else other than to enter Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But she knew this was impossible for her.
<br><br>
She first had to become an Eternal Warrior and she might never even achieve that.
<br><br>
All her hopes were now placed on that door.
<br><br>
She did not expect there to actually be a path leading to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"If I want to step into Stage Thirty-three, I must become an Eternal Warrior and reach the Eternal Realm. Can I do that in my current state?" Dorothy asked.
<br><br>
"Of course not." The white-haired monster laughed.
<br><br>
"You do not want to go home, you want to go to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore?" The long-haired monster asked, hovering behind Dorothy as she looked forward down the passageway.
<br><br>
Dorothy was their race's only hope.
<br><br>
Just now, the long-haired monster and the white-haired monster had discussed whether they should tell her the way home.
<br><br>
If they told her, would she move on and leave them behind? Should they explain to her what had happened in that world? What if she insisted on doing as she pleased? They had prepared a detailed explanation, but it seemed that Dorothy was not interested in the way home at all! And so the long-haired monster couldn't help but ask her that question.
<br><br>
"I have to go to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore," Dorothy replied firmly.
<br><br>
The long-haired monster and the white-haired monster looked at each other, their eyes twinkling with surprise.
<br><br>
If she wanted to remove the curse, she would also have to go to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
No matter what Dorothy's purpose was, at least she was headed in the same direction as them! "It is true that in your current state, you are unable to step into Stage Thirtythree, but I have a way to get you in," said the long-haired monster. "But you have to tell me your purpose of going there."
<br><br>
"To save my grandmother!" Dorothy blurted out.
<br><br>
The long-haired monster nodded. "We can help you with this matter, but we ask that you please keep your previous promise."
<br><br>
"To help you remove the curse?" Dorothy inquired.
<br><br>
"Yes."
<br><br>
Dorothy had already made up her mind as she walked down the passageway.
<br><br>
Her current fate seemed to have been determined in her previous life. She had no other choice but to fulfill that promise.
<br><br>
She would not refuse these monsters' requests.
<br><br>
Now they revealed they could help her save her grandmother in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore! If they really could help her, she would risk her life if she had to. She would obviously not hesitate to agree with them.
<br><br>
In the Crane Blood Province The Star Crane City was the most prosperous city of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Three ancient towers were like pillars stretching out of the city to the sky.
<br><br>
Each ancient tower had thousands of floors, and housed the core disciples of the Bearing race. The Ji Clan was located in the Supreme Memorial Tower, between the other two towers.
<br><br>
Two hundred Other Shore Realm warriors had lined up on the capacious top floor of the Supreme Memorial Tower.
<br><br>
The Ji Clan had posted a notice some time ago, announcing they planned to select some strong Other Shore Realm warriors to join the Yellow Emperor Guards.
<br><br>
This was an excellent opportunity for the Other Shore Realm warriors scattered among the ordinary citizens to show their potential.
<br><br>
Joining the Yellow Emperor Guards would mean obtaining better resources and even some powerful Other Shore Tokens! Naturally, since the notice had been posted, more and more warriors flooded this place with hopes of becoming a Yellow Emperor Guard.
<br><br>
But now, their faces filled with confusion as they began muttering to themselves...
<br><br>
They were unsure of the reason for their being sent here. This was the headquarters of the Ji Clan, a place that was difficult for even the most powerful warriors in the Crane Blood Province to enter.
<br><br>
A huge gap existed between the Ji Clan and ordinary people.
<br><br>
Why would the warriors who applied to be one of the Yellow Emperor Guards be sent here? "Enter!"
<br><br>
The guards escorted the warriors into a palace.
<br><br>
A moment ago, they had smelled the faint scent of the wood in the corridor, but that was replaced with a strong smell of blood after they entered the palace, so strong that some almost passed out.
<br><br>
After they had entered, they saw a young man with black hair curl up in the corner of the palace.
<br><br>
He was naked, covered in blood, and his eyes flashed with a fierce light.
<br><br>
When the Other Shore Realm warriors saw him, they were instantly overtaken with a sense of foreboding.
<br><br>
Some wished to retreat...
<br><br>
Some wondered what was going on...
<br><br>
Suddenly, the door closed behind them and the guards shouted, "If you kill that young man, you qualify to join the Yellow Emperor Guards!"
<br><br>
"That young man doesn't appear to have even reached the Other Shore Realm!"
<br><br>
"He is at most a consummate True God. He can't even possess the power of one divine megaton."
<br><br>
"I will kill him!"
<br><br>
It was obvious how big the gap between the Other Shore Realm warrior and the True God was.
<br><br>
Such a large gap dispelled the fear in some hearts.
<br><br>
Others still kept a cool and collected head, not getting ahead of themselves.
<br><br>
If killing this man was easy, why were two hundred Other Shore Realm warriors sent here all at once? Those who recognized something was not quite as it seemed retreated to the corner, and some even looked for ways to escape...
<br><br>
But with the means of the Ji Clan, how would the mere Other Shore Realm warriors be able to escape? The black-haired boy stood up and a sinister aura began filling every corner of the room. Then, like a wolf ravaging a flock of sheep, he pounced on the crowd! Streams of blood spurted and sprayed on every wall as the warriors were ruthlessly killed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3737 Use Him It only took him five whole minutes to slaughter the two hundred warriors at the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
If that was not impressive enough, he was able to kill one hundred and ninety-eight of them in two minutes.
<br><br>
The rest were a bit difficult to get rid of because they resisted with their Other Shore Tokens. It came to a point that one of them transformed into a cloud of black fog, so naturally, his body couldn't be torn to pieces.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the remaining man used his Other Shore Token to open a box space and hid himself within.
<br><br>
Though the methods of these two were unique and effective, they did not last long. Eventually, the boy still dealt with them and killed them without breaking a sweat.
<br><br>
Pah! Pah! Pah! As soon as the boy was finished with the last man standing, a round of applause roared from the other end of the hall.
<br><br>
It was a woman in a white fox-fur robe, looking beautiful, dignified, and powerful.
<br><br>
"You've made rapid progress," that woman said.
<br><br>
The black-haired boy squinted his eyes and a darkness flashed behind his eyes. Suddenly, he propped his hands to the ground as if he were a beast, and pounced on the woman without hesitation.
<br><br>
Though it made him look primitive, the killing intent was definitely aggressive. There was no way the ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm could avoid this! The woman, however, just cocked her head and grabbed the boy by the arm, completely unthreatened.
<br><br>
Whoosh! With one swing, she tossed him away as if with little effort. Her one move contained about eight thousand divine megatons of force! Bang! Just like that, the black-haired boy was sent into the sky and slammed right into the wall.
<br><br>
The towering Supreme Memorial Tower let out a little shake in reaction to the impact.
<br><br>
The woman scoffed, "But no matter how much you have progressed, you are still no match to me now."
<br><br>
As she turned around to speak, the boy did not hesitate to pounce on her for the second time.
<br><br>
This time, her eyebrows were raised, surprised to see how confident the boy was. Like the first time, she grabbed him by the hair and lifted him off the ground. Left and right, she smashed the boy with no mercy whatsoever.
<br><br>
Boom! The force sent cracks into the arrays that protected the ground, and the boy was unmoving.
<br><br>
Still holding him by the head, the woman dragged him to the other side of the room. They entered the transmission door which transported them to an underground hall.
<br><br>
A strange stone was positioned at the center of the hall.
<br><br>
It appeared large, like a huge heart, but it was stronger and sturdier than anything else.
<br><br>
A line of warriors surrounded the stone, all of them having reached the Holy Soul Realm. They were the elites - the very foundation of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
A young man in a brocade robe chuckled at the sight of the woman. "You taught him a lesson again?"
<br><br>
The woman, on the other hand, couldn't help but sigh with resignation. "He won't give up until he is killed..."
<br><br>
"It's good that he can be subdued now," the man in brocade robe continued.
<br><br>
"However, when he becomes as strong as Usman, I'm afraid he will become a scourge to us." The man seemed worried, but tried his best not to let it overcome him.
<br><br>
In the past, Usman's behaviors had attracted the attention of all the super forces.
<br><br>
Usman was a very special, rare being. Unlike most warriors at the Other Shore Realm, he did not need to rely on the Other Shore Tokens. More than that, he did not seek the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits when in battle. For some reason, his physical body and evil soul grew so much that he could even go up against the Eternal Warriors without fail! His way of growth was so unique that it caught the eye of many forces, and even made them jealous of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
However, his betrayal completely shifted his appearance to the super forces.
<br><br>
Filled with so many negative emotions and intentions, Usman was an ungrateful man. It was because of this that he grew to become an extremely evil existence, one that could never submit to anyone.
<br><br>
Once Yellow Thearch took the black-haired boy back, it worried the masters. They saw his frightening potential to follow in the footsteps of Usman.
<br><br>
However, because the strength of the black-haired boy was still weak and immature, he could still be watched and controlled.
<br><br>
If he continually grew at immense speed, it wouldn't be long until even Yellow Thearch found it difficult to suppress him.
<br><br>
"We are mere executors," the woman spoke out, dignified. "As for the consequences, I believe the emperor might have his own plans..."
<br><br>
Without any trace of gentleness, she dragged the boy and lifted him onto the heart-like stone.
<br><br>
Just as the boy made contact with the heart-like stone, it made a "plop"
<br><br>
sound.
<br><br>
It seemed that this heart-like stone suddenly throbbed.
<br><br>
The stone did not move, but it had a powerful sound or vibration from within it.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop! A few seconds had passed and the black-haired boy gradually fell asleep.
<br><br>
In his sleep, his bones extended, his hair grew, and he inched taller and taller by the minute.
<br><br>
However, everyone watching was not at all surprised.
<br><br>
They knew very well of the effects of the stone.
<br><br>
Plop...
<br><br>
From a boy with the body of an eight-year-old, the boy had the body of a fourteen-year-old within a few minutes.
<br><br>
"Look! He's about to wake up," the young man nudged the people around him.
<br><br>
"He's definitely going to cause some trouble," he added.
<br><br>
Though a few people were worried, the woman did not seem threatened.
<br><br>
The black-haired boy's eyes fluttered and eventually, opened. As the woman prepared to pin him down, he ended up not moving at all. He only lay on the stone, and then looked up to the sky.
<br><br>
It was as if he saw something that no one else had seen.
<br><br>
Surprised with his calmness, the woman and the young man looked at the scene and blinked their eyes in confusion.
<br><br>
Soon, a space fluctuation came from the left side of the hall.
<br><br>
From it, powerful cultivators at Holy Soul Realm walked out of the channel, and the last one to enter was a middle-aged man with sharp eyes.
<br><br>
"Your Majesty!"
<br><br>
At the sight of Yellow Thearch, all warriors immediately knelt down and bowed.
<br><br>
But Yellow Thearch seemed a bit anxious. He waved his hand to signal everyone to stand. They all made their way towards the side of the blackhaired boy.
<br><br>
Just then, Yellow Thearch reached out and gently put his palm against the boy's forehead, then looked up into the sky.
<br><br>
And though they were all underground, he saw through the ceiling almost immediately.
<br><br>
Under the scorching sun, a space was violently reverberating. It was as if something powerful was going to emerge.
<br><br>
This lasted for only a few seconds, until Yellow Thearch looked back down.
<br><br>
The boy's expression returned to normal as well.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the emperor's face lit up as he scanned through the room and looked at the officials who were giving him expressions of worry.
<br><br>
He smiled. "What are you all so worried about?"
<br><br>
"Your Majesty, it's just that this child is the same as Usman. He can't be tamed. Are we..." The young man in brocade robe responded anxiously.
<br><br>
But before the young man could even finish his words, Yellow Thearch let up a hand and asked him to stop. "While it is true that Usman can't be tamed, I did not intend to treat him as a member in the first place."
<br><br>
"Your Majesty, have you found a way to control him?" The young man asked again.
<br><br>
But Yellow Thearch shook his head. "I just want to use him to control this world..."
<br><br>
There was a great connection between Usman and the entire Source World.
<br><br>
However, the connection remained hidden and undetectable despite the many efforts to find it.
<br><br>
But the situation had changed now.
<br><br>
With the guidance of the Element Spirit Civilization, he possessed a decent understanding of primitive land that could help them dig out useful information and resources.
<br><br>
Chapter 3738 To The Blooming Jade Stage The raven-haired boy's face remained dull and stiff for over an hour.
<br><br>
During this time, the fluctuation within the Source World quietly disappeared.
<br><br>
When the boy came back to his senses, he jumped off the stone—his instinct was to run away.
<br><br>
But too many powerful warriors were currently in the underground hall— any one of them could easily subdue him.
<br><br>
Before he could even take another step forward, he was trapped in an invisible cage.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch walked briskly toward the raven-haired boy.
<br><br>
He figured that the boy would quickly get all memories of Usman, but he was surprised to find otherwise.
<br><br>
While the boy reacted to the mention of Usman, he didn't remember much about him.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch felt a tremor between his brows before he could say something.
<br><br>
His face seemed to shift in color before he turned to the woman in white fox-fur robe.
<br><br>
"Take him back…"
<br><br>
The latter merely nodded and dragged the boy away.
<br><br>
Taking a step forward, Yellow Thearch disappeared from everyone's view, entering a dark room.
<br><br>
His forehead began to crack, from which an eyeball emerged. "Kill him!" a voice resounded from the eyeball. "Kill that brat!"
<br><br>
Its voice was full of fury.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had a deep foundation. Even Yellow Thearch couldn't tell how powerful the second civilization was.
<br><br>
In the face of everything in the Source World, the Element Spirit Civilization always seemed to remain calm.
<br><br>
But this time, it looked rather exasperated. "Kill whom?"
<br><br>
asked Yellow Thearch. "Zen!"
<br><br>
the eyeball nearly yelled back.
<br><br>
Even Emperor Charm had died because of Zen, so Yellow Thearch had figured he should pay attention to the man. Besides, the Descending Rings they had obtained couldn't be used successfully. He highly suspected that the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's hand had something to do with it.
<br><br>
"Why the hurry?" asked Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
"He has passed through the Soul City," the eyeball said.
<br><br>
"The Soul City? He's quite fast…" said Yellow Thearch plainly.
<br><br>
"He passed through the Soul City in a single try and obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
At that, Yellow Thearch couldn't hide his shock.
<br><br>
The very idea of passing through the Soul City in a single try was truly astonishing.
<br><br>
What was even more bizarre was the fact that Zen could obtain nine Holy Soul Imprints—something that had never before happened on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In fact, the news that Zen had obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints already spread through the Souls of Light in the Soul City.
<br><br>
But the internal structure of the Bearing race was complicated. It took some time for the news to spread layer by layer, delaying the dissemination. As a result, Yellow Thearch had yet to find out about what had happened to Dailey.
<br><br>
"Since he's already passed through the Soul City, I'm afraid he'll want to go to the Land of Bone Tribulation. We'd better snip him in the bud in Stage Thirty of the Other Shore," calculated Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
He seemed to have a good understanding of Zen even without having met him personally.
<br><br>
Zen seemed to be the only special existence that entered the Other Shore.
<br><br>
He had his very own corporeal body.
<br><br>
When Yellow Thearch heard of the fact for the first time, he thought of the Eternal Scroll Painting—something Zen could possibly enter.
<br><br>
But at that time, Zen had just become famous in Stage Four of the Other Shore. There was a long way to go before he reached Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, so it wasn't the time to give it much mind.
<br><br>
In truth, he had even doubted that it was likely Zen could reach Stage Thirty-two alive.
<br><br>
But after only such a short time, Zen had already passed through the Soul City.
<br><br>
"Of course we will," continued the eyeball. "But for security's sake, you must take action in the Source World as well. You also need the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, after all!"
<br><br>
'Must I personally lead the Bearing race?' Yellow Thearch wondered, narrowing his eyes.
<br><br>
Though Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin couldn't come back now, the Pear Hill wouldn't let them do anything easily. The fact made Yellow Thearch feel the need to set up certain strategies.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore… the Soul City had been open for one hundred and thirty-two hours, and it was time to close it.
<br><br>
Before the gate was shut, the Souls of Light in the Soul City emerged one after another.
<br><br>
From afar, Zen saw Elvinia step out wearing a grim expression. He, on the other hand, walked up to her with a smile and asked, "How is it going this time?"
<br><br>
"Eight hundred and ten feet," Elvinia answered with her head bowed. "I've tried my best, but I'm still too slow…"
<br><br>
"You're already very quick—you obviously already surpass Libby's talent in this aspect," Zen assured her.
<br><br>
But Elvinia merely pouted.
<br><br>
She didn't want the Soul City to become a restrictive barrier. She was very eager to pass through it.
<br><br>
This time, Elvinia had pushed herself to the limit. To a certain extent, even Libby, the top disciple of the Land of Sword Grief, couldn't catch up with her.
<br><br>
But so what? A great gap still remained between her and Zen. It was impossible for Zen to wait for her the entire time.
<br><br>
"The test in the Soul City is a form of training, so you shouldn't be anxious.
<br><br>
I'll wait for you in the Land of Bone Tribulation," Zen assured her.
<br><br>
Urgent was the current situation, so Zen had to press forward.
<br><br>
A Soul of Light nearby quickly walked over to them, carrying an aura that seemed far stronger than the ordinary. It was none other than Libby, who had already passed the test of the Soul City.
<br><br>
"Congratulations, Libby!"
<br><br>
"I didn't expect you to pass the test so soon!"
<br><br>
Both Gabriel and Carver were still around Libby.
<br><br>
Without Zen's incomprehensible record, Libby's performance was amazing in itself.
<br><br>
But over the past few days, all attention had been given to Zen, both inside and outside the Soul City.
<br><br>
Even Libby could feel that passing the test of the Soul City was a common thing—there was nothing to be excited about.
<br><br>
Once she arrived at Zen's side, she immediately said, "I've also passed the test of the Soul City. I want to go to Stage Thirty of the Other Shore and I heard that you know some kind of way to release the blood mist and dodge the Garudas. Can I go there with you?"
<br><br>
Libby hadn't had much interaction with Zen. When they first met, she had even provoked him. Now she felt rather bad having to ask him for help.
<br><br>
But Zen just smiled faintly and said, "We're both disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, so we should help each other out on the Other Shore. If you need to go to a higher stage, I will help you, of course."
<br><br>
Zen's answer had Libby overjoyed with gratitude. "Thank you, Zen!"
<br><br>
It was quite normal for disciples in the Land of Sword Grief to communicate with each other with open arms, but for Elvinia, it was especially hard to accept. She secretly made up her mind about passing through the test of the Soul City as soon as she possibly could.
<br><br>
The Soul City was located at the very center of the Constant Glory Stage.
<br><br>
Behind it lay a long and narrow plank road.
<br><br>
At the end of it was a huge, round platform where densely distributed star rings led to the Blooming Jade Stage, Stage Thirty of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Once he said goodbye to Elvinia, Zen used the Blood Fog Spell to cover both himself and Libby as they moved along the plank road. The moment they arrived at the huge round platform on the opposite end, Zen saw a Soul of Light of the Holy Soul Realm waiting for him.
<br><br>
The Soul of Light carried two wings on her back—she was a member of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
"Elizabeth?" Zen asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
While he couldn't quite see her face clearly, he was already well familiar with her aura after fighting against her several times.
<br><br>
Elizabeth's presence had Libby rather nervous until she remembered that the Sun Crow race no longer existed. The remaining members were dependent on Zen, so Libby could feel at ease.
<br><br>
Chapter 3739 Two Layers Under Zen's arrangement, all the members of the Sun Crow race had to stay in the Oneness Mountain for cultivation.
<br><br>
In reality, however, they were simply on standby.
<br><br>
The reason for that was if the Oneness Sky Palace ever encountered external intruders again, they would do their best to defend against them upon Zen's order.
<br><br>
Still, the only person those Sun Crows followed was the real Emperor Charm. After they knew about the current situation, they thought that they would never betray him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elizabeth stared at Zen with an unreadable expression.
<br><br>
Both of them were at the Holy Soul Realm, but the aura Zen emitted was much stronger.
<br><br>
It made Elizabeth a little confused. "Zen, have you obtained the Holy Soul Imprint? How many did you get?" she asked.
<br><br>
For her, it was almost inevitable for Zen to obtain the Holy Soul Imprint.
<br><br>
However, she didn't know how many Holy Soul Imprints he could get.
<br><br>
Three or four? It might even be possible that he got five imprints.
<br><br>
While Elizabeth pondered over the matter, Libby, who was beside her, answered first, "Zen has passed through the Soul City on his first try and obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints."
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Elizabeth's Soul of Light suddenly trembled.
<br><br>
They even saw that the surface of her Soul of Light had fluctuated.
<br><br>
"Nine Holy Soul Imprints? Then, what did you see or what can you do with them?" she asked in a shaky voice.
<br><br>
Back then, she had gone to and returned from Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore so many times. Not even the Element Spirit race could unravel the secret about the Soul City.
<br><br>
If Zen obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints, then he might have obtained different opportunities.
<br><br>
"He can open and close the door of the Soul City freely," Libby said.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen glanced at Libby. He was slightly thankful that she answered the questions for him.
<br><br>
Now, Elizabeth asked such questions just out of curiosity.
<br><br>
However, he refused to reveal the secret of the Starry Roc-fish in the Soul City.
<br><br>
"Yes." He nodded, and then continued, "There is a switch to the door on top of the Soul City."
<br><br>
Only then did Elizabeth realize that she had asked something she shouldn't have asked.
<br><br>
If she talked to another master or even Emperor Charm that way, she might get punished.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen had only avoided the topic.
<br><br>
As soon as she came back to her senses, she changed the subject and said, "Zen, you should stay in the Constant Glory Stage for now.
<br><br>
Don't go to the Blooming Jade Stage." "Why?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"If you go there, the Element Spirit race would attack you. They would never let you set foot in the Land of Bone Tribulation," Elizabeth replied.
<br><br>
Since she had followed Emperor Charm while traveling on the Other Shore, she had witnessed how strong the Element Spirit Civilization was.
<br><br>
In her opinion, it was almost impossible for anyone to defeat the unbeatable Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
"Just because they will attack me in the Blooming Jade Stage like you said, I have to stay in the Constant Glory Stage all my life?" asked Zen.
<br><br>
Elizabeth was stunned at Zen's question.
<br><br>
"Some paths are destined to be difficult, but we can't stop because of some obstacles," he said indifferently.
<br><br>
In turn, Elizabeth was silent for a moment. However, she had already expected such an answer from him.
<br><br>
"If you want to go, please follow me. I'm very familiar with both the Blooming Jade Stage and the Element Spirit race. Although it's a bit risky, I can help you reach Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore!" she offered.
<br><br>
Libby blinked and said, "The masters of our Oneness Sky Palace will be there to meet us. He doesn't need you."
<br><br>
Although she knew that Elizabeth had already surrendered and wouldn't attack Zen, there was still a chance that she might do so.
<br><br>
Elizabeth glanced at Libby, and then at Zen. Zen was the one to make the decision.
<br><br>
"I want to get there with my physical body, not my Soul of Light. I'll be back after I change my form. If you have better way to pass through the Blooming Jade Stage, then of course I will choose the easier way," Zen said with a nod.
<br><br>
After all, his top priority right now was to go to the Land of Bone Tribulation. He didn't want to stay in Stage Thirty of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If his Soul of Light ever went there in the future, then there would probably be a fierce battle between him and the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
"Then I'll wait for you here," Elizabeth agreed with a smile.
<br><br>
After they were done, Zen left the Other Shore with his Soul of Light and entered it again with his physical body. He continued to use the Blood Fog Spell to move forward.
<br><br>
When he arrived at the star ring, Elizabeth and Libby were still waiting for him.
<br><br>
"Libby, I'm afraid I'll be in trouble when I go to the Blooming Jade Stage this time. Why don't you stay here and wait for a while before going there?"
<br><br>
he suggested.
<br><br>
Libby just chuckled at him and said, "Well, I have also stepped into the Holy Soul Realm , so my Soul of Light isn't as fragile as an ordinary Soul of Light."
<br><br>
"You do indeed have the strength to fight against a physical body after you've reached the Holy Soul Realm, but it is vastly different when you are against a truly powerful Other Shore creature. There is still a big difference between your strength and theirs. I suggest you stay here for the time being," Elizabeth said coldly.
<br><br>
When she talked to Libby, she became as arrogant as she was before.
<br><br>
Libby slowly answered, "Thank you for your concern, but I don't need anyone to give me any advice."
<br><br>
"Let's go!" Zen declared.
<br><br>
He did not want to participate in such a meaningless argument, so he walked straight to the star ring.
<br><br>
In just a second, Elizabeth and Libby stepped into the star ring as well and turned into white beams of light that shot upwards.
<br><br>
From Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore, almost every stage had a specific arrangement.
<br><br>
Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore had the Soul City, Stage Thirty-one had the Land of Bone Tribulation, and Stage Thirty-two housed the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Only Stage Thirty of the Other Shore was considered normal! Therefore, the disputes in Stage Thirty had been the most intense since many chaotic eras ago. It was even safe to say that most races would fight for Stage Thirty.
<br><br>
But since the human race was trapped in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore and the Nihility race was always on the defensive, the Element Spirit Civilization gradually took control of Stage Thirty. A large number of the members from the Element Spirit race stayed in Stage Thirty, which they considered as their headquarters.
<br><br>
"Swoosh..."
<br><br>
The moment Zen left the star ring, the turbulent cold air blew over his body and made him stiff.
<br><br>
When Libby walked out of the star ring, she also felt that her Soul of Light was about to solidify.
<br><br>
She would've gotten injured if it wasn't for her Colorless Soul.
<br><br>
As for Elizabeth, she had already adapted to the low temperature in the Blooming Jade Stage, so she was well prepared.
<br><br>
"What a vast ice field!" Zen exclaimed as he looked into the distance.
<br><br>
The ice field was boundless, and it seemed that the entire Blooming Jade Stage was made of ice. There were even rays of icy light that shone down from the sky above the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the sky for a while and asked, "Is there another layer of ice above the Blooming Jade Stage?"
<br><br>
He looked around carefully and found that the ice light above them did not refract from below. It looked like there was another layer of ice above their heads.
<br><br>
"Yes, there are two layers on the Blooming Jade Stage. The upper layer is extremely cold and could freeze both Other Shore creatures and the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
No one can cross the upper layer, so we can only pass through the lower layer of ice," Libby explained.
<br><br>
In other words, all the living beings in the entire Blooming Jade Stage and the many temples and strongholds of various forces were all sandwiched between the two layers of ice. "I wonder what better way of passing through you have come up with, Elizabeth," Libby said and glanced at Elizabeth.
<br><br>
A faint smile graced Elizabeth's lips, and she said, "The better way I mentioned is to pass through the upper ice field."
<br><br>
Chapter 3740 Penetrating Through The Ice Libby was stunned for a while when she heard Elizabeth's suggestion. Then, she said, "What? Did you just suggest that we go through the upper ice field? Are you trying to kill us?"
<br><br>
The upper ice field was a forbidden area in the Blooming Jade Stage! If there wasn't a lower ice field, perhaps no one would've made their way to Stage Thirty-one.
<br><br>
"Well, I have to admit that I am only interested in Zen's life. As for yours… I'm not interested in the slightest. You don't have to come with me if you don't want!" Elizabeth retorted.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen chimed in and asked, "But since the upper ice field is so dangerous, why did you choose that path?"
<br><br>
"According to your current situation, it's almost impossible for you to go through Stage Thirty in the normal way, unless you can overturn the entire Element Spirit Civilization with your strength," Elizabeth explained.
<br><br>
Elizabeth had always analyzed things from a third-person point of view.
<br><br>
For instance, she was well aware of both Zen's ability and the strength of the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Now, the death of Emperor Charm wasn't a big loss for the Element Spirit Civilization, but they might have paid greater attention to Zen.
<br><br>
What was worse was that the news Zen had passed through the Soul City might have caused a stir.
<br><br>
"If you don't trust me, you can summon my emperor and he will prove my loyalty," Elizabeth pleaded with a serious look.
<br><br>
"There's no need. I believe you," Zen said with a nod.
<br><br>
Based on the current situation, he knew that the powerful warriors of the Sun Crow race had no choice but to follow him. Furthermore, she could never deceive him due to the influence of the bloodline worship.
<br><br>
Now that Zen had agreed, Elizabeth decided to stop arguing with Libby.
<br><br>
With a gentle flick of her wings, she flew up into the air and said, "I know of a way that leads to the upper ice field. Follow me!"
<br><br>
When Zen was about to activate the Thunder Materialization, he suddenly looked at Libby. An ordinary Soul of Light couldn't fly, but he still didn't know if a Holy Soul, which was also named Colorless Soul, was able to.
<br><br>
To his surprise, several lines appeared on Libby's back and glowed brightly, then she quickly floated upwards and rose into the air.
<br><br>
'So a Holy Soul could fly…' he thought as a pair of thunder wings formed behind his back.
<br><br>
The crack of thunder filled the air, then he also flew up and followed closely behind Elizabeth.
<br><br>
As they flew in the sky, they saw that the distance between the lower and upper ice fields was over a hundred thousand feet! Therefore, it was no easy feat to fly from the lower ice field to the upper one.
<br><br>
At the same time, the temperature of the air around them became lower and lower as they continued to fly higher.
<br><br>
"Swoosh!"
<br><br>
A strong gust of numbingly cold wind blew over their faces.
<br><br>
If such powerful winds caught even an ultimate-level Indigo Soul, then they would freeze to death and shatter into pieces.
<br><br>
When the winds blew over Elizabeth, the meridians in her soul glowed and she easily resisted the cold.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Libby had much more difficulty doing so since she had just reached the Holy Soul Realm. When she saw how Elizabeth dealt with the cold, she followed suit and the meridians in her soul also started to flicker with light. She managed to expel all the cold air that invaded her Colorless Soul in this way.
<br><br>
As for Zen...
<br><br>
Although he did feel cold, he could still withstand it and didn't even bother to put up any defenses.
<br><br>
After the three of them reached a height of one hundred thousand feet, they finally arrived beneath the upper ice field.
<br><br>
Zen reached out his hand and touched the thick ice sheet above him. The moment his fingers touched it, white frost quickly spread around his hand like a monster's tentacles.
<br><br>
He tried to pull his hand out, only to find that it was stuck firmly to the ice! Just as he was about to summon his strength to forcefully withdraw his hand, a ball of golden flames burst from the side and burned his hand.
<br><br>
Phew! The flames blazed in his hand and quickly melted the white frost, and thus freed him from the ice.
<br><br>
"Be careful not to touch the ice," Elizabeth warned.
<br><br>
Zen smiled with embarrassment and silently followed her.
<br><br>
However, that sort of danger wasn't actually a problem for him. In fact, he could break through the thick ice directly if he wanted to — but on second thought, he remembered that their goal was to pass through the Blooming Jade Stage without being noticed.
<br><br>
Therefore, he decided not to mess things around and just follow Elizabeth's instructions.
<br><br>
They flew along the ice sheet for a long while until they seemed to have arrived at the very edge of the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
There was a shallow channel at the edge of the ice sheet. Elizabeth flew straight into the channel, then her body began to emit the divine flame of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
There were a few sizzling sounds, then thick, white fog spread out from where the fire and ice combined.
<br><br>
After Zen and Libby watched Elizabeth melt the ice for a while, the two of them heard her voice from above that said, "The ice sheet is about a thousand feet thick. Follow me, or you will get frozen in the ice."
<br><br>
In turn, Zen and Libby went into the hole Elizabeth created and followed her into the ice.
<br><br>
Like several moths that bore through a thick book, they slowly penetrated through the ice sheet with the help of the divine flames.
<br><br>
Soon enough, Elizabeth was worn out from keeping the divine flames active for a long time.
<br><br>
After she had advanced over two hundred feet in the ice, she stopped to rest. "May I try?" Zen suddenly offered.
<br><br>
Elizabeth looked at Zen in surprise. "Can you use a fire of the same level?"
<br><br>
she asked.
<br><br>
The flames created from Godly Ways couldn't melt the ice at this place.
<br><br>
After all, they were in the Blooming Jade Stage, Stage Thirty of the Other Shore! Any block of ice in the area was an Other Shore Token with ice attributes.
<br><br>
"I can't, but someone else can!"
<br><br>
He communicated with the Primeval Lord of Heaven in his mind, then gently waved his hand. A fire lotus bloomed in his palm.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The fire lotus rotated gracefully as it flew towards the ice above.
<br><br>
Hissss! It was Zhurong, the God of Fire, who had summoned the fire lotus.
<br><br>
Even if he was only an energy soul of the real Zhurong, the fire lotus still possessed compelling powers.
<br><br>
The ice melted quickly under the fire lotus' flames, and clouds of white mist immediately enveloped the three of them.
<br><br>
"The ice melts so fast!" Elizabeth exclaimed as she looked at the rising fire lotus with astonishment.
<br><br>
The fire lotus created a cave that was more than two hundred feet long, before it gradually went out.
<br><br>
"Let's go!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
He rushed forward first, followed by Elizabeth and Libby.
<br><br>
"Go!"
<br><br>
When Zen reached the end of the cave, he summoned another fire lotus in his palm.
<br><br>
He lightly tossed the fire lotus, then it moved forward and melted another two hundred feet of ice.
<br><br>
They kept going up in this way. When Zen threw out the fifth fire lotus, the ice sheet above them suddenly cracked.
<br><br>
Zzzztttt...
<br><br>
In the next second, a strange and shrill sound came from above.
<br><br>
The fire lotus had penetrated the ice sheet, then strong gales of cold wind howled from above.
<br><br>
The cold winds were quite powerful. It caught Zen, Elizabeth, and Libby off guard as they dropped a certain distance. It was like a huge, invisible hand had slapped them.
<br><br>
Among them, Zen dropped the shortest length, followed by Elizabeth, while Libby dropped the most.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the cold winds only raged for three seconds before the broken ice sheet froze again. After the opening was blocked, the cold winds were gone.
<br><br>
"Such strong winds…The upper ice field is truly worthy of its reputation,"
<br><br>
Zen remarked with a smile.
<br><br>
He was fully covered in white frost, and so were Elizabeth and Libby.
<br><br>
Chapter 3741 Cold Prisons Libby couldn't help but sigh dejectedly. "If it's already awfully cold at the entrance, how much colder will it be above? I can't imagine what that'll be like," she said while shivering slightly.
<br><br>
However, Elizabeth merely shrugged indifferently. "To be honest, this is not the coldest place yet. You will know when you get up there!"
<br><br>
"Really? But it's already freezing cold in here. Is this really how we will get up there?" Zen looked at her questioningly.
<br><br>
There was no doubt that if they climbed to the upper ice field without any preparation, even Zen would be frozen.
<br><br>
Elizabeth shook her head. "What? Of course not!" She seemed like she had some sort of trick up her sleeve.
<br><br>
She stretched out her arm for them to see. As they looked at it, a small ring instantly appeared on her wrist. Obviously, this ring was the Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
"Buzz..." It began to vibrate slightly.
<br><br>
As the ring emitted a flash of light, a circular shield appeared in her hand.
<br><br>
"This is the Divine Fire Shield. It is a treasure forged by the fire spirit of the Element Spirit race. Under the protection of this shield, we can move safely around the area above," explained Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Obviously, Emperor Charm had obtained a great deal of benefits from the Element Spirit race when he joined them.
<br><br>
He didn't seem to need this Divine Fire Shield. Therefore, he gave it to Elizabeth instead. It was a good thing he did because this would be a great help in crossing the upper ice field.
<br><br>
Elizabeth began floating towards Zen. As soon as she passed by him, she had released the divine flames of the Sun Crow race on her fingertips.
<br><br>
The divine flames started flowing upward and all over the Divine Fire Shield. The heat coming from the entirety of the shield radiated towards them and gave them warmth.
<br><br>
The temperature of the Divine Fire Shield itself was not that high. However, it was able to control the temperature within a certain range.
<br><br>
"Stay close to me. We'll climb up quickly! Get ready. Here we go!"
<br><br>
Elizabeth said.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Under the protection of the Divine Fire Shield, the three of them dashed upward together.
<br><br>
They broke through the ice-cold hole that was now starting to freeze over.
<br><br>
After a while, the trio finally arrived at the upper ice field. They made it with almost no problem at all.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh... Suddenly they heard a loud swishing sound.
<br><br>
They encountered a fierce cold wind that blew over them. It was quite powerful and should not be taken lightly. It almost overturned the Divine Fire Shield.
<br><br>
"Hold on!" Elizabeth's facial expression changed.
<br><br>
If the Divine Fire Shield was blown away by this monstrous wind, their fate would be sealed. They could already imagine getting frozen to death in this icy wasteland.
<br><br>
Without second thought, Zen immediately clasped the Divine Fire Shield in his hands with lightning speed. He gripped it as tightly as he could. No matter how hard the cold wind blew, the Divine Fire Shield did not budge at all. It remained covering the three of them! Elizabeth breathed a sigh of relief. If Zen hadn't reacted quickly, the shield would have overturned. "Let's keep moving forward!" She motioned them to follow her. "Over there on the left, you can see the line that marks the end of the ice field. As long as we continue to walk along the line, we should be on the right way... "
<br><br>
The area of Blooming Jade Stage was quite immense.
<br><br>
Even though the path Elizabeth had chosen was considered relatively safe, it still was not that easy to cross.
<br><br>
The only thing they encountered in the boundless ice field was the cold bitter wind that blew hard. Other than the vast blue and white ice field, they couldn't see anything else. Not even a single snowflake was in sight.
<br><br>
Every five minutes, the red light on the Divine Fire Shield would start to dim. In addition to that, the temperature under the shield would also plummet. Every time this would happen, Elizabeth would send a divine flame toward the Divine Fire Shield with just a slight flick of her finger.
<br><br>
The light of the Divine Fire Shield would once again become bright.
<br><br>
A few hours had already passed since the three of them had made their way above the ice field. However, all they could see in front of them was just pure white space. They couldn't see the way in front of them or the way they had passed.
<br><br>
"We can't just keep going on like this. It's too slow and we're wasting too much time already," Zen said impatiently. "Can't we just fly over?"
<br><br>
He asked because he knew Elizabeth was able to fly. However, she merely shook her head when she heard Zen's suggestion. "The situation on the ice field is completely different from what you actually see. There are some extremely cold and turbulent currents up in the air that are invisible. If we ever get caught up in those currents, even the Divine Fire Shield won't be able to protect us."
<br><br>
Seeing the serious look on Elizabeth's face, Zen just gave up on that idea.
<br><br>
All he could do now was to keep moving forward under the shield.
<br><br>
After they had walked for another sixteen hours, the cold wind gradually stopped.
<br><br>
Without the sound of the wind, the place was so quiet. It was such a deafening silence.
<br><br>
"The cold wind has stopped blowing?" Zen noticed this immediately. He looked around him through the shield. He couldn't feel the wind anymore.
<br><br>
Elizabeth merely shrugged. "Well, that's because the temperature is much lower here than where we were before."
<br><br>
It was common knowledge that as the temperature reached an extremely low point, any kind of energy would become almost stagnant. The cold wind on the ice field was also considered as a powerful energy.
<br><br>
"Hey, Zen! Look! What's that over there?" Libby had been quietly observing the area around them all along.
<br><br>
She already knew that it would be very cold on the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
However, never in her dreams did she think that the upper ice field would be like this.
<br><br>
Northwest of their current location, they saw a portion of the ice field sinking for a few dozen feet. It seemed like there was nothing in that area at all. However, they felt that this zone exuded a particularly huge pressure.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the area that Libby pointed out. Then, his facial expression was filled with utter curiosity. Instinctively, he grabbed the Divine Fire Shield and tried to move towards that area.
<br><br>
"No, wait! Don't go there!"
<br><br>
Elizabeth hurriedly pulled the Divine Fire Shield. She said, "That's a Cold Prison. Don't go there!"
<br><br>
"A Cold Prison? What is that?" Zen raised his eyebrows. He had never heard of that before.
<br><br>
Elizabeth nodded. "The temperature in there is much lower than that of where we are standing right now. That makes it the third coldest place on the entire Other Shore." She began discharging a divine flame of the Sun Crow race upon her fingertips and turned it into a small flame arrow. She shot the flame arrow made of incredibly condensed heat towards the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Whoosh! It soared directly towards the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Strangely enough, the flame arrow suddenly stopped the moment it entered the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
The arrow seemed like it was hovering steadily and slowly. Even the flame on it was flickering very slowly as well.
<br><br>
"The flame arrow looks oddly peculiar," mumbled Zen as he stared at the arrow.
<br><br>
He thought that if the "Cold Prison" was truly extremely cold, then the flame arrow should have been extinguished right away.
<br><br>
In this case, the flame didn't go out immediately. Instead, it actually looked like it was burning really slowly.
<br><br>
"Believe it or not, the flame arrow has already been extinguished,"
<br><br>
explained Elizabeth. "But due to the extremely low temperature of the Cold Prison, time has been oddly distorted inside. The flame arrow that you see floating slowly right now is merely a mirage."
<br><br>
Whenever something had reached an extreme level, it was usually enough to render some parts of the basic rules ineffective.
<br><br>
As the coldness reached its absolute limit, the properties of many things would also change.
<br><br>
"Sizzle!"
<br><br>
After the flame arrow floated for a few seconds, it suddenly burned brightly.
<br><br>
In a split second, the entire Cold Prison was filled with firelight.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the firelight just flashed quickly and disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
The moment the firelight illuminated the Cold Prison, Zen noticed some light dots with strange shapes that appeared inside it. Those light dots were randomly distributed and they looked very similar to the light dots in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"So those light dots are..."
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to ask, Elizabeth began to explain. "So far, we still don't know what those light dots are. But I have heard from Emperor Charm that there are some things imprisoned here. That is why these areas on the ice field are called 'Cold Prisons'."
<br><br>
Simply put, the Cold Prisons on Stage Thirty actually imprisoned the creatures from the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
It was too bad that Geoffrey had been left in the Deleting Space. If he was here, Zen would be able to ask him to tell what these light dots were.
<br><br>
Driven by his absolute curiosity, Zen also flicked a few flames towards the Cold Prison. He observed them carefully just as he did earlier.
<br><br>
As soon as the flames entered the Cold Prison, they all floated slowly like Elizabeth's flame arrow. Then with a flash of firelight, they disappeared too.
<br><br>
After trying several more times, Zen continued to move forward under the Divine Fire Shield.
<br><br>
Soon enough, he discovered that there were Cold Prisons everywhere on the upper ice field.
<br><br>
The densely packed Cold Prisons looked like they were holes that had been dug by worms. They had cut the originally sleek ice surface into many parts.
<br><br>
Chapter 3742 The Core Of The Heavenly Obsession Civilization They had to step carefully since, according to Elizabeth, the Cold Prisons were horrible and dangerous.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the prisons were special. The temperature inside was indeed extremely low, but it would not hurt them even if they got very close.
<br><br>
"Did you say that the Cold Prisons are not the coldest, but the third coldest?" Zen asked questioning how that could be true.
<br><br>
From what he had seen just now, it seemed the temperature inside was already low to the extreme. Under such a temperature, even time and space had undergone a qualitative change; he found it hard to imagine an environment that could be colder than that.
<br><br>
"You will soon see the second coldest place," said Elizabeth. "But the place with the lowest temperature on the Other Shore is said to be on Stage Thirty-three. I have only heard of it, never seen it."
<br><br>
"I'll soon see the second coldest place..."
<br><br>
Zen repeated to himself, trying to restrain his curiosity. He walked slowly on the path between the Cold Prisons, under the protection of the Divine Fire Shield.
<br><br>
It took them about an hour to pass through the low-lying area filled with Cold Prisons and then, a huge frozen structure appeared before Zen.
<br><br>
"A temple?" Zen wondered as he looked at it closely.
<br><br>
"It could be, but no one can be sure," Elizabeth replied shrugging her shoulders.
<br><br>
It looked like a frozen temple, but its style was very unique in that it looked more like a huge metal box than a traditional temple.
<br><br>
"What civilization would construct a temple like this?" Libby asked shaking her head in confusion and astonishment.
<br><br>
"Has anyone explored this temple before?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Elizabeth shook her head. "Look carefully at the ice on the outer layer."
<br><br>
Zen stared at it for a while and then raised his eyebrows slightly at what he discovered.
<br><br>
This layer of ice gave off a great deal of pressure, somewhat similar to that of the Cold Prisons.
<br><br>
"This box has the second lowest temperature," Elizabeth said indifferently.
<br><br>
"In a Cold Prison, it would take almost all the water in a sea to create a thumb-sized ice cube. Look over there..."
<br><br>
Not far away, on the left, was a very special looking Cold Prison. The others were empty, but this Cold Prison held a small ice cube the size of a thumb in the center...
<br><br>
Zen's jaw dropped slightly as he thought of what Elizabeth had just said.
<br><br>
"That ice cube is..."
<br><br>
"It used to have the same amount of water as that in the whole Bright Sea Province," Elizabeth said before Zen could finish his words.
<br><br>
Within the Bright Sea Province was an island and a city, and the rest was all sea.
<br><br>
"A whole sea condensed to only a thumb-sized cube. Then the ice around this huge metal box..." Libby took a deep breath as she spoke.
<br><br>
"It would take an enormous amount of water to condense it to surround this metal box. How could there be so much water in this world?" Zen asked utterly astounded and dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Elizabeth smiled and revealed, "That mystery is still unsolved. Or at least the Element Spirit race could not solve it."
<br><br>
The Other Shore had many similar mysteries and secrets spread throughout.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had been active on the Other Shore for more than one thousand chaotic eras, yet they still hadn't been able to figure it out.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and moved around the metal box under the shield.
<br><br>
He had felt a sense of familiarity when he first saw this metal box. Its shape was very similar to that of the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
But the shape was quite simple and common, so it wasn't strange that they looked alike. He decided not to say anything in the end.
<br><br>
But then, just as Zen and the others walked from behind the metal box to the front, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice suddenly rang out. "Zen, the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization has issued a task again."
<br><br>
Zen was slightly stunned to hear this.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been issuing tasks tirelessly, but Zen was not interested in receiving any of them and thus ignored them.
<br><br>
However, ever since the Primeval Lord of Heaven had entered his inner world, a person had been sent specifically to guard the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
This person classified and recorded every task issued by the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
The recorder was never tired of the work, recording all tasks and classifying them according to different levels; heaven-level, earth-level, first-class, second-class and so on. He recorded everything, not missing a word, and then meticulously reported them to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Today, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had suddenly issued a task.
<br><br>
"Special task: return to the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization! Reward: nothing!"
<br><br>
This strange task stunned the recorder.
<br><br>
The tasks issued were never the same. The level and class of the tasks, as well as the reward that would be offered for completing them, would be announced clearly.
<br><br>
Now, the Civilization Aircraft suddenly issued such an unusual task, which baffled the recorder.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had also warned him that he should report anything unusual to him immediately. This was one of those cases and so the recorder hurriedly reported it to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who then promptly brought it to Zen's attention.
<br><br>
"Special task...
<br><br>
Return to the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization..."
<br><br>
Zen's face twisted strangely at what he had just learned.
<br><br>
If this was what was now put before him, then the Heavenly Obsession Civilization must have something to do with this huge metal box. Was this the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization? Finally, Zen, Elizabeth and Libby made it to the front of the box.
<br><br>
Just then, something began to change.
<br><br>
A speck of red light flickered dimly on the metal box...
<br><br>
It spread from the bottom to the top of the metal box, which then began trembling vaguely.
<br><br>
"What's happening?"
<br><br>
This switched Elizabeth's expression dramatically.
<br><br>
This huge metal box had stood on the upper ice field for countless years.
<br><br>
No one had even gotten close to it, let alone seen it move.
<br><br>
The sudden change had startled her.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
The ice on the surface of the metal box cracked.
<br><br>
If a thumb-sized ice cube would require the water of a sea to be condensed into it, one could only imagine the kind of power needed to break such thick ice.
<br><br>
"Retreat! Hurry!"
<br><br>
An ice block the size of a fist fell from above and crashed into the ice field.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
This highly condensed ice block held an amount of water equivalent to a huge sea the size of several provinces.
<br><br>
The upper ice field was unable to support it at all. The ice block smashed right into it, penetrating the thick layer of ice, and smashing into the lower ice field.
<br><br>
Luckily, this area on the lower ice field was unpopulated. The ice block had not fallen on any living creatures. The only damage caused was a small pit in the ground, left by the ice block before it disappeared without a trace...
<br><br>
Many more ice blocks fell similarly.
<br><br>
To be safe, Zen, Elizabeth and Libby had all retreated. A long while later, most of the blocks of ice at the front of the metal box had fallen off.
<br><br>
A dark red light silently began glowing to reveal the outline of a door.
<br><br>
"It has a door. Does that mean we can go inside?" Elizabeth was overtaken by excitement.
<br><br>
She had passed by here many times and had always regarded this place as forbidden and not to be approached. Anyone who witnessed this sudden change would be as excited as she now was.
<br><br>
Chapter 3743 Two Civilizations Elizabeth had always been careful ever since she set foot on the upper ice field, but now she was finally feeling a little bit radical.
<br><br>
"Come on! Let's go over there and have a look!" she excitedly said to the other two.
<br><br>
At this moment, however, Zen became extremely cautious and wary. "Wait a moment. There are still some ice blocks that haven't fallen off. It's not a joke when you get hit by these ice blocks."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, another large chunk of hard transparent ice fell from above. With a clash, it created a massive hole in the ice field.
<br><br>
The three of them waited at a distance for some more time. They didn't continue their slow approach until there was a clear sign that there would no longer be any solid ice falling.
<br><br>
The door outlined by the light was still closed like before.
<br><br>
Fearing that the metal box would be too cold to touch, Elizabeth immediately released a divine flame of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
The divine flame was burning the surface of the metal box, but it did not extinguish quickly. It was like any ordinary flame, burning for a while before it quietly dwindled.
<br><br>
"There is no problem with the metal box, but how can we get in?" Elizabeth asked as she shook her head.
<br><br>
"Look! It seems that the center of the door is somewhat sunken," said Libby, who was by their side.
<br><br>
Zen and Elizabeth shifted their eyes to the center of the door at the same time. It was not until Libby pointed out that they noticed that the center of the black metal door was indeed sunken.
<br><br>
"I wonder, what can be put in this sunken area?" Elizabeth asked. She looked really confused.
<br><br>
However, Zen's heart skipped a beat at that same moment.
<br><br>
Judging from the size and shape of the sunken area, it was completely the same with the size and shape of the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. It seemed that the movement of this huge metal box had something to do with the Civilization Artifact under his control.
<br><br>
"I think I may know," Zen said with a smirk.
<br><br>
Elizabeth and Libby curiously looked at Zen at the same time. Of course, the two girls hadn't imagined that all of this had been caused by Zen.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
It was still a little troublesome to take out an Other Shore Token that had already been carried before.
<br><br>
After Zen prepared for a little while, a metal cubic box appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
"This box..."
<br><br>
"It seems to be just the right size!"
<br><br>
Libby's and Elizabeth's eyes abruptly lit up with excitement.
<br><br>
Zen pushed the Civilization Artifact into the sunken area. The Civilization Artifact perfectly fitted and matched with the sunken area.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Then, the red light around the door became brighter. With a click, the Civilization Artifact bounced out, and the black door automatically opened.
<br><br>
"It's open..."
<br><br>
Elizabeth said in disbelief.
<br><br>
Things went on almost unimaginably smoothly.
<br><br>
It was as if the path of the upper ice field was made specifically for Zen.
<br><br>
After absorbing the Civilization Artifact into his inner world, Zen was cautious enough to not rush into the metal box immediately. Like Elizabeth, he released a fire column first to test the temperature inside the metal box.
<br><br>
After the fire column went inside, the temperature did not change that much. Only then did Zen enter with the shield for caution.
<br><br>
The inside of the metal box was pitch black as if it was an unending void.
<br><br>
Rays of green light could be seen, which made the inside of the metal box look like there were little snakes wandering along the wall.
<br><br>
Libby looked around and asked curiously, "This metal box is not a temple.
<br><br>
It's simply an empty house. What's the use of an empty house like this?"
<br><br>
Elizabeth shook her head as if she was saying that she didn't know the answer to Libby's question. She had also never encountered a thing like this before.
<br><br>
Zen was quietly observing the faint light that was flowing on the wall. At the same time, he was also paying close attention to the Civilization Artifact in his inner world.
<br><br>
"You have completed the task of entering the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization, and your reward for this is the activation of the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization."
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
When the Civilization Artifact made this sound, the number of rays of green light on the wall greatly increased. As thousands of rays of green light flowed on the wall, the entire metal box was immediately reflecting in an eerie green glow.
<br><br>
Elizabeth and Libby warily looked around as they squeezed beside Zen with nervous expressions on their faces. If there was a trap, then they would all be doomed.
<br><br>
Not to mention other things but even if a Cold Prison covered them, they would all be frozen to their core.
<br><br>
"Don't, don't be afraid..."
<br><br>
Being squeezed by the two girls, Zen was at a loss for words. He could only say, "It's me who activated the light."
<br><br>
"You?" Elizabeth was stunned by what Zen said.
<br><br>
"Yes, this place is called the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization. It was left behind by the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," said Zen.
<br><br>
"So, what's the use of this place then?" Elizabeth inquired again.
<br><br>
Zen just shook his head and said, "I haven't figured out that part either."
<br><br>
Just as the two of them were discussing, a ray of light suddenly shot out from a wall right in front of them.
<br><br>
The light swept across Elizabeth, Zen, and Libby. Then a green shadow slowly appeared on the wall in front of them. Judging from the curvaceous silhouette, it should be a shadow of a human woman. Its size and form were actually remarkably similar to that of Elizabeth.
<br><br>
When Zen looked at the green figure from head to toe, it suddenly spoke in a tuneful voice.
<br><br>
"Hello..."
<br><br>
This voice was incredibly special. It was neither a voice of a woman nor a man, neither a voice of a child nor an elder. It sounded as if there were multiple people—males and females, young and old—speaking at the same time. Judging by the sound ray alone, it was terribly like the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" Zen asked gently.
<br><br>
"Me?" The green figure was deep in thought for a moment. "I'm a consciousness created by the Heavenly Obsession Civilization."
<br><br>
"A consciousness that was created? Are you a soul fragment?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, who was listening in Zen's inner world, also had a strange look on his face.
<br><br>
With the theurgies on the Other Shore, all sorts of things could be created.
<br><br>
However, a consciousness could never be created.
<br><br>
Just like what Zen thought, he also thought that the green figure was a soul fragment.
<br><br>
"No, I am not a soul fragment. I am not attached to anyone. I am an independent individual and I was created," the green figure replied affirmatively. Obviously, it understood what a soul fragment was, but it didn't think it was a soul fragment.
<br><br>
Zen was still a little confused at what the green figure was saying. He could only make it clear if he asked it from another perspective, "So you are not a living creature but a puppet?"
<br><br>
"I am not a puppet either. Give me a moment to think about how I can explain it to you more clearly..."
<br><br>
The light that formed the green figure flickered and then suddenly disappeared.
<br><br>
All the rays of green light in front of them lined up, forming a protective green curtain.
<br><br>
A moment later, the green curtain began to emit other colors. Then, a picture appeared in front of them. It was a picture of three people in another completely different world.
<br><br>
When the three of them saw this scene, shock and disbelief appeared on their faces.
<br><br>
"What is this? Isn't this an illusion?" Elizabeth excitedly exclaimed in astonishment.
<br><br>
"I am not sure but it seems to be a scene formed by scrolling pictures,"
<br><br>
Libby said.
<br><br>
Zen nodded his head, then said, "All of the scenes are made up by constantly changing the light. I've never heard of this means before..."
<br><br>
All kinds of illusions and magic arrays in chaos were very ordinary theurgies.
<br><br>
Now, countless rays of light constantly changed to reflect complicated scenes. In the eyes of Zen, Elizabeth, and Libby, it was a difficult and thankless thing to see. Even if it could be done, it was meaningless to do so.
<br><br>
"The means may seem very difficult for you to do, but it's extremely simple for us," the green figure said.
<br><br>
At this moment, a primitive land appeared on the curtain, and many small insects were born on that land. At the same time, the green figure spoke again with its eerie voice. "The Heavenly Obsession Civilization was actually the second chaotic era we have experienced. The experiences in that round of chaos have been annihilated in history. But I think you must have heard of the first chaotic era we have experienced. That was the Calculation Civilization."
<br><br>
Chapter 3744 The Civilization Made Up Of Insects Zen had long since heard of the Calculation Civilization.
<br><br>
They were the ones who advocated for another way to complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Instead of relying on the Other Shore, the Calculation Civilization completely abandoned that strategy and used their own understanding of space, time, and energy to carry out the Finale Way.
<br><br>
It was said that they almost succeeded but that claim was never confirmed since very little trace of their culture and history remained, which was why not a lot of civilizations believed they were able to almost complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Despite that, however, the Primeval Lord of Heaven still acutely learned this. He put the information about the Energy Shaft into the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill finally chose to let Yan cultivate the Energy Shaft. In the Chaotic Source World, she had used it once.
<br><br>
However, it was worth noting that the Energy Shaft she wielded was only rudimentary. The real Energy Shaft could alter time, space, and energy freely. Its power was unimaginably great.
<br><br>
Elizabeth and Libby did not have much of a reaction towards the green figure.
<br><br>
Libby had never heard of the Calculation Civilization or the Heavenly Obsession Civilization before. Elizabeth knew a bit about them but never really thought highly of them. She only felt curious, at most, as to how exactly such an unknown civilization lived in two rounds of chaos and built a temple here.
<br><br>
Zen shared their thoughts. "A civilization can only go through one chaotic era. How could you be able to go through two?" he remarked in mild disbelief.
<br><br>
It was the Primeval Lord of Heaven who made Zen ask the question.
<br><br>
In order to sow the seeds of the human race, the Primeval Lord of Heaven paid a heavy price and it was only by taking advantage of the opportunity when the chaotic era moved onto the next one was he able to succeed.
<br><br>
For the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to have served as a ruling civilization in two chaotic eras was unheard of! "Because we discovered the method of passing down our civilization," the green being answered.
<br><br>
As it spoke, numerous insects hatched on the wall in front of Zen.
<br><br>
These insects were life fireflies, emitting flickering lights that danced all around them.
<br><br>
"Our civilization is different from other civilizations," the green figure continued. "These are our real forms."
<br><br>
Zen nodded in understanding, his expression unchanged.
<br><br>
It was very common for insects to form civilizations.
<br><br>
At least the Regal Jade Civilization and the Metal Civilization were both rarer compared to this collective of light-emitting insects.
<br><br>
"In our Calculation Civilization, male members release red light while female members release green..."
<br><br>
As the green figure continued to explain, the insects flew around and lined up in an orderly way.
<br><br>
Dots of red and green light paired up with each other. As the insects bonded, red and green light began to flash constantly.
<br><br>
The sight of these lights puzzled Zen. "What on earth is this?" he muttered in amazement.
<br><br>
It wasn't just him. Both Elizabeth and Libby were equally, if not more, confused.
<br><br>
"This is a calculation method," the green figure answered. "You humans have ten fingers and calculate with the decimal system but for us, we count by two colors, red and green, with the binary system..."
<br><br>
This talk about counting methods confused Zen but the Primeval Lord of Heaven appeared above him and directly asked his question. "What is the advantage of this binary system?"
<br><br>
"Advantage?" the green figure repeated. "The advantage is that we have unparalleled calculation ability."
<br><br>
With this revelation, the scene before them began to change.
<br><br>
Tens of thousands, millions, hundreds of millions...
<br><br>
Red and green lined up together and flickered continuously. As the insects gathered together, they calculated the results and communicated with each other.
<br><br>
"Such a special method of calculation!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed with excitement. "Just how powerful is it?"
<br><br>
"It can easily decipher Sanskrit words," the green figure replied.
<br><br>
When the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard this, his expression changed.
<br><br>
For so many years, Geoffrey was the only one he knew who was able to decipher Sanskrit words with his inborn ability. The boy was just able to understand the words naturally! The Calculation Civilization's method was completely different. They deciphered Sanskrit words through terrifying calculation! As a result, the Sanskrit words, which might be secrets to others, were nothing mysterious to them.
<br><br>
It was through their faultless calculation method that the civilization was able to decipher all Sanskrit words and evolved at such a fast pace.
<br><br>
"If that's the case then why does nobody know of your civilization?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
He had a point. Such an advanced ruling civilization would've definitely left marks on the Other Shore, not unverifiable rumors.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but nod in agreement.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..."
<br><br>
To their surprise, the green figure laughed. "We're too small, even smaller than the tiniest mosquito in your world. It's difficult for individuals in our civilization to increase their strength all alone."
<br><br>
It was indeed true. The insects were incredibly small, just like the indecipherable grains of sand on a beach.
<br><br>
A civilization of micro-individuals would have trouble producing powerful existences.
<br><br>
"Don't be mistaken though. Even if we are small, we still have the means to cultivate. An individual's strength may not be that impressive, but together..."
<br><br>
Countless insects began to appear and flash a barrage of lights on the wall.
<br><br>
These insects combined in a special way to form an indomitable force that could fight against ferocious beasts in that chaotic era.
<br><br>
Alone, they were weak, but together, they could be unstoppable. Thus, the Calculation Civilization cultivated as a unit.
<br><br>
This was the same method No. 9527 adopted inside the Chaos Ancient God Gerald's mind. Each soul fragment had a mind of its own but combined, they formed a complete whole.
<br><br>
"Soon enough, our Calculation Civilization became the ruling civilization in the chaos. Like other ruling civilizations, we also wanted to complete the Finale Way. We climbed towards the higher stages of the Other Shore step by step until we saw the starry sky..."
<br><br>
This description was understood by both Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
The green figure was no doubt talking about the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Libby, however, was confused. "What starry sky?" It seemed the more she listened, the less she was actually able to learn since she couldn't understand anything.
<br><br>
"I think it's the starry sky of Stage Thirty-three. The one that leads to a world outside the chaos," Zen explained.
<br><br>
"Have you ever been there?" she asked. "How do you know about it? Wait, since you know about it, that means you have been there, right? Am I right?" she asked, throwing out a series of questions but did not give Zen the chance to answer any.
<br><br>
A trace of helplessness appeared on his face. "I'll tell you later."
<br><br>
This exchange was ignored by the Primeval Lord of Heaven who had more questions for the green figure. "Can you also understand what is in that starry sky through calculation?" he asked.
<br><br>
"So long as our calculation ability is powerful and advanced enough then we can understand everything in the starry sky. In fact, we almost achieved such a feat," the green figure answered.
<br><br>
Chapter 3745 The Remarkable Calculation Ability An expression of surprise flashed across the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face, "You have already made it?"
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Just then, a light shadow appeared on the wall again. The figure formed by the light shadow seemed to be a complex, futuristic craft.
<br><br>
"Although the size of our members is already small, we are still not small enough." The green figure continued to explain, "After we had processed the sand, we were able to display a stronger calculation ability. However, it took us more than half of the chaotic era to obtain this method..."
<br><br>
The complicated craft slowly morphed into black boxes, quite similar to the Heavenly Obsession Civilization's Civilization Artifact that Zen had fused with.
<br><br>
"Such a powerful thing is actually made of sand..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the green figure was not concerned with the Primeval Lord of Heaven's exclamation. It knew that their Calculation Civilization was such a unique existence.
<br><br>
While the form on the wall transformed, a world of ice and snow appeared on its surface.
<br><br>
"This is the Blooming Jade Stage," Libby finally voiced out.
<br><br>
She knew what she was talking about, especially because she had passed through the Blooming Jade Stage just now.
<br><br>
"Yes," the green figure responded. "If you came from the upper ice field, you would have noticed the light dots distributed in the Cold Prisons."
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement. "That must be from the Abstruse Energy World."
<br><br>
The scene on the wall quickly switched to a Cold Prison, and then the black boxes reappeared. As the green light on the boxes flashed, an illusory outline formed and glowed with green as well.
<br><br>
It seemed that the light spots in the Cold Prison were confirmed by the extremely high-speed calculation.
<br><br>
It was during the presenting process of the wall picture that the green figure murmured words about the calculation. These most probably would have to be the unique words of the Calculation Civilization.
<br><br>
Though Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven could not decipher those words, they assumed the Calculation Civilization had the ability to restore the things in the Abstruse Energy World by means of quick calculations.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, a deformed, odd monster curled up in the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
It was imprisoned in the Cold Prison, but was not dead. The picture showed its eyes that blinked a couple times.
<br><br>
"The monster is still alive?" Elizabeth gasped.
<br><br>
A trace of fear rose in her heart when she thought of the Cold Prisons she had passed by just now.
<br><br>
"Yes, most of them are alive. Only a few died," the green figure acknowledged.
<br><br>
"Do the monsters in the Cold Prisons belong to the Instant Civilization?"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"No."
<br><br>
The green figure heaved out a huge sigh. Like most human beings and other ambitious civilizations, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was on the hunt for the Instant Civilization and the meaning of its existence.
<br><br>
"Since you can see through the world outside the chaos, why haven't you discovered the real way to complete the Finale Way?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven continued to ask.
<br><br>
"It's not like we haven't tried! We have considered many methods, including using powerful Other Shore Tokens," the green figure replied.
<br><br>
When the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard about the Other Shore Tokens, his eyes lit up. "We human beings have collected the Other Shore Tokens within Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, such as..."
<br><br>
The green figure listened intently as the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained. When he finished, the green figure couldn't help but smile. "You must have failed, right?"
<br><br>
"They did. If they had succeeded, we wouldn't even be here right now,"
<br><br>
Elizabeth spat.
<br><br>
The green figure shook its head. "I didn't draw the conclusion through this.
<br><br>
It is because we have calculated the power needed to put up against that needle."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven scoffed, "You figured out how much strength is needed?"
<br><br>
"Yes." The green figure continued, "Around one hundred and sixty-one million divine megatons..."
<br><br>
Zen, Libby, Elizabeth and the Primeval Lord of Heaven took a deep breath after they heard this answer.
<br><br>
Elizabeth and Zen only had the power of tens of thousands of divine megatons as of the moment.
<br><br>
Plus, if the power of hundreds of thousands of divine megatons was released, that would be terrifying to be around.
<br><br>
Considering the amount of power needed, there was no way they could succeed and make it out alive.
<br><br>
There was no telling what such a formidable force could do.
<br><br>
"That's impossible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven expressed, shaking his head. "In the past, when the human ancestor used his strongest method, he sacrificed himself by releasing over nine million divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
He almost succeeded in completing the Finale Way..."
<br><br>
Zen was inclined to believe his words.
<br><br>
When he saw King Manard and the human race on the Other Shore, he had learned that the human race had almost completed the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Over nine million divine megatons of force was already so threatening, but it was nowhere near the power of one hundred and sixty-one million divine megatons.
<br><br>
However, the green figure couldn't care less about the Primeval Lord of Heaven's reaction. "We've collected much information regarding Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Taking into account of all the existing Other Shore Tokens, we calculated the greatest possible power we could obtain, which is nine million seven hundred and thirty thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
I wonder if your ancestor used the same amount of power."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was stunned to hear this, and his eyes widened in shock.
<br><br>
Previously, when they saw that the Calculation Civilization consisted of a bunch of insects, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zen looked down upon them. After all, what could a bunch of tiny insects do? It was at this moment that the Primeval Lord of Heaven believed these insects developed a powerful civilization on their own.
<br><br>
They calculated anything correctly.
<br><br>
Just then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven recalled that before the human ancestor sacrificed himself, his voice echoed throughout the entire starry region.
<br><br>
"Today, I will do my best to complete this. With the burning of all these tokens, I will unleash the terrifying power of nine million seven hundred and thirty thousand divine megatons..."
<br><br>
The Calculation Civilization had never obtained these Other Shore Tokens before, but they could calculate the amount of power so accurately. The Primeval Lord of Heaven could not believe that.
<br><br>
"The things left behind on the Other Shore seem mysterious, but they prove to be mere illusory traps which lure rounds of civilizations into them. They all assume that they could complete the Finale Way," the green figure said.
<br><br>
"But no matter what you do, even your most perfect plan won't get you through the Finale Way."
<br><br>
Convinced, the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded at the green figure with great reverence. However, his eyes gleamed with an ounce of hope, "So what method can be used to complete the Finale Way?"
<br><br>
"The Energy Shaft," the figure responded. "Only the Energy Shaft can transform endless power."
<br><br>
In the past, when the Calculation Civilization discovered they couldn't complete the Finale Way relying on the Other Shore, they came up with different methods to do so. So far, the Energy Shaft was the most promising one.
<br><br>
Chapter 3746 The Failure Of The Heavenly Obsession Civilization According to the Calculation Civilization's assumption, the Energy Shaft's transformation ability was virtually infinite.
<br><br>
In theory, after mastering the completed Energy Shaft, one would then possess infinite power.
<br><br>
Not to mention the power of about a hundred and sixty million divine megatons, even the power of a billion divine megatons could be transformed and released.
<br><br>
"It's such a pity that in the period of the Calculation Civilization, the end of the chaotic era arrived when plan of using Energy Shaft finalized. We couldn't set it in motion at the time…" the green figure remarked.
<br><br>
"So instead, you shared the method to obtain the Energy Shaft, right?"
<br><br>
asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied the green figure. "Back then, we were in despair, so we placed our hope on other civilizations."
<br><br>
Many other ruling civilizations on the Other Shore had the tendency to exclude other races.
<br><br>
They believed that anyone not part of their own race would be disloyal.
<br><br>
They were vigilant and always on guard against other races. And so after many ruling civilizations on the Other Shore set up their own temples, it grew difficult for them to advance to higher levels.
<br><br>
Some of the rules and theurgies they grasped were hidden in the temples as treasures—at the time, they weren't willing to spread them out.
<br><br>
However, the Calculation Civilization was very open-minded. They hoped that other civilizations could do what they failed to.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, most of the later civilizations regarded the Energy Shaft as merely an untouchable thing. Many civilizations grew skeptical of it.
<br><br>
In truth, the Primeval Lord of Heaven also felt that the Energy Shaft was an unreachable kind of fantasy. But the plan was feasible, in the end. And so he stuffed it into Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree before passing it onto this chaotic era.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, not a single civilization believed in us. We could only rely on ourselves. And so we opened the second chaotic era—the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," said the green figure.
<br><br>
"I want to know how you opened the second chaotic era," asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
After all, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization owned the Civilization Artifact, so it should have also been a highly prosperous ruling civilization.
<br><br>
The situation likely differed from the human race's current situation.
<br><br>
Naturally, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was rather curious about it.
<br><br>
"Our control over life should go beyond your comprehension," continued the green figure. "Our bodies are small, so perhaps we're at an advantage.
<br><br>
At the micro level, we found many sources of life, along with the things that make up these sources."
<br><br>
As it spoke, a small ball appeared on the wall.
<br><br>
It changed from one to two, two to four, four to eight, and so on. As it continued splitting, it became a densely packed group of small balls that formed many young lives.
<br><br>
On the picture were wolves, elephants, and all sorts of strange beasts.
<br><br>
"Is life formed by these small balls? What about our human race?" Libby's eyes widened in curiosity.
<br><br>
"They also form human beings," replied the green figure.
<br><br>
"How is that possible?" Libby couldn't help but shake her head in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Now, I can make a scene so you can take a look..."
<br><br>
Soon after, the picture on the wall returned to a single small ball, similar to the previous picture. As it continued splitting, countless small balls were formed, each then turning into an extremely young individual—the human embryo.
<br><br>
The embryo grew rapidly until it became a baby waiting for delivery.
<br><br>
Zen, Elizabeth, and Libby were all amazed. The Primeval Lord of Heaven, on the other hand, seemed rather calm and unsurprised.
<br><br>
It wasn't particularly difficult to observe the process of a baby's growth, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't expect the baby to form from a tiny ball. What he wanted to know was how the Calculation Civilization ended up becoming the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
"As you can see, all the creatures are formed by small balls after they split.
<br><br>
So long as the information inside the original ball is modified, we're likely to get our desired results," the green figure said.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven's expression shifted slightly as he asked, "Then you've revised it..."
<br><br>
"Yes," it said faintly. "We modified the balls at the beginning of another chaotic era. When the balls split, the race they formed turned out to be our Calculation Civilization. We were rich in experience and time, so we thought we could easily realize the plan of Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
However, we underestimated the power of the Sons of Truth and the strength of the Element Spirit race."
<br><br>
The green figure's voice seemed rather lonely and disappointed.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore, the Calculation Civilization had always kept a low profile. Who would pay attention to a group of insects, after all? The Element Spirit Civilization completely ignored the Calculation Civilization. They didn't even bother suppressing this race in the least.
<br><br>
According to the assessment of the Element Spirit Civilization, the latter was likely the weakest ruling civilization.
<br><br>
The Calculation Civilization managed to become the ruling civilization merely because, at the time, there were no other powerful races in that round of chaos.
<br><br>
But the appearance of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization quickly aroused the Element Spirit race's vigilance.
<br><br>
The latter found that these insects were not as simple as they seemed. After the Element Spirit race realized it, they began rigorously suppressing the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the civilization that existed before the Heavenly Obsession Civilization chose to pay allegiance to the Element Spirit race. And so the Sons of Truth selected in the previous civilization naturally fell under the Element Spirit race's command.
<br><br>
While fighting the Sons of Truth, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization tried creating the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
"In the end, all our efforts were in vain," said the green figure in return, shaking its head. "It didn't matter when the Sons of Truth suppressed us.
<br><br>
Although our Calculation Civilization was small, our absolute strength was powerful enough to fight against them. We already managed to control those Sons of Truth in the second chaotic era...
<br><br>
Our real problem still lies on the Other Shore," continued the green figure.
<br><br>
"The plan of Energy Shaft required the help of the Other Shore. But the Element Spirit race was too strong for us to fight against. The ones heading for Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore were too weak, so in the end, even the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was frozen."
<br><br>
The Calculation Civilization was a race known to group together—they needed countless individuals to grow strong.
<br><br>
Entering Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, one needed to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting. Not many individuals could enter it.
<br><br>
In the entire Calculation Civilization, only about twenty had entered Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But they were individuals barely as big as mosquitoes. What was their use? "At that time, you guys could cultivate to become the Wild Gods. Your body size shouldn't be a problem, right?" Zen asked as he wondered.
<br><br>
"We were used to cultivating and fighting together. Even if we turned into huge creatures hundreds of thousands of times bigger than before, we still couldn't display our original strength," the green figure simply said.
<br><br>
"So you were focused on the Energy Shaft at the time? What about the Ways-blending Energy?" Zen asked further.
<br><br>
Chapter 3747 Connection If Zen's knowledge served him right, the Ways-blending Energy also had great potential.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that the Heavenly Obsession Civilization only focused on the Energy Shaft. It did not mention the Ways-blending Energy at all.
<br><br>
"The Ways-blending Energy?" the green figure asked with a faint smile.
<br><br>
"Our Calculation Civilization is best at blending Godly Ways. We even blended three thousand and one Godly Ways back then during the era of Calculation Civilization. But so what? That one missing Godly Way was never found!" the green figure exclaimed.
<br><br>
The method the Calculation Civilization used to blend Godly Ways was naturally different from what the Evil God used.
<br><br>
The Evil God used his impressive talent to blend Godly Ways, while the Calculation Civilization still relied on calculation to do so.
<br><br>
It was possible to permute and combine the three thousand and one Godly Ways in countless ways.
<br><br>
As long as there was enough time and with a powerful calculation ability, one could find the best blending method sooner or later.
<br><br>
In terms of the sequence and operation method, the Calculation Civilization had summarized a total of six ways to blend Godly Ways. "You have blended three thousand and one Godly Ways?" Zen asked as the corners of his eye twitched.
<br><br>
He knew that it was very likely that the Evil God had obtained the "arc light energy" in his hand from the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, but what about the Blood Essence Godly Way of the Regal Jade Civilization? "Yes, and the Element Spirit Civilization had hidden the last Godly Way,"
<br><br>
the green figure answered. "We got this information from a Sanskrit word.
<br><br>
Maybe the Ways-blending Energy was the best method to complete the Finale Way, but we couldn't resist against the Element Spirit Civilization. It was impossible."
<br><br>
After it was done speaking, the Regal Jade Spirit slowly said, "I didn't expect that someone else had gone further even before our Regal Jade Civilization…"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit had always believed that only the Wing King had obtained the blood red Sanskrit word.
<br><br>
He had never imagined that someone else had already acquired the Sanskrit word and deciphered the information inside it even before the Wing King could.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the green figure's statements matched exactly with the information Zen knew, so the green figure certainly did not talk nonsense.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen also told the green figure how he had obtained the Blood Essence Godly Way and the "arc light energy". Then he asked, "Is it truly impossible to get the last Godly Way from the Element Spirit race?"
<br><br>
"That Godly Way should be hidden in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. Our Calculation Civilization can't do anything about it, unfortunately," the green figure said with a shake of its head.
<br><br>
"Maybe we can do something," Zen said with a gleam in his eyes.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!" the green figure burst into laughter.
<br><br>
It clearly didn't think that Zen could make it. "At what phase is the current round of chaos?" it asked again.
<br><br>
"It's almost at the end," Zen answered.
<br><br>
Truth be told, Zen wasn't sure about the duration of the entire chaos, but he always heard that the chaos had reached the last phase ever since he had entered the Source World.
<br><br>
"What a pity..." the green figure muttered. "With our calculation, we have already deduced and confirmed the best method to make a complete Energy Shaft," said the green figure.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
If they could get hold of a complete Energy Shaft, then that would probably be the best way to complete the Finale Way. However, there seemed to be an issue since the green figure said "what a pity".
<br><br>
Thus, the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, "If your civilization could already make an Energy Shaft, then why was it a pity?" "It takes a long time to cultivate the embryo of an Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
Since the current chaos is in the last phase, there isn't enough time," the green figure explained.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven frowned at this answer.
<br><br>
He knew about the plan of the Element Spirit race. If the Purge Way succeeded, then the end of the chaos would be delayed, and there would probably be no chances anymore.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen suddenly thought of something. "What if there is a ready-made Energy Shaft?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Ready-made?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the green figure looked at each other in confusion.
<br><br>
Last time when the Snake Goddess and Fuxi visited the Oneness Sky Palace, they only discussed some important things.
<br><br>
They hadn't told the Primeval Lord of Heaven that the embryo of the Energy Shaft was already placed inside Yan's body.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and proceeded to describe the "Energy Shaft" he had seen before. "My sister Yan only got that Energy Shaft not long ago, and according to Fuxi, that was just an embryo," he added.
<br><br>
In turn, the green figure's whole body fluctuated as if it was excited. It said, "We Calculation Civilization never believed in fate, but it seems that fate has guided you to come here.
<br><br>
The embryo of the Energy Shaft should have existed for a long time, otherwise, it couldn't merge with your sister."
<br><br>
It was true that the Energy Shaft of Pear Hill was constructed a long time ago.
<br><br>
However, there had never been a suitable object to merge with it.
<br><br>
Thus, the Snake Goddess proposed to create a perfect self to merge with the Energy Shaft. That was why she used the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed to create Yan.
<br><br>
"Can she have a complete Energy Shaft?" Zen asked. "Of course!" the green figure answered.
<br><br>
"Although we've been frozen here for a while, we have always waited for an opportunity.
<br><br>
For us, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance," it said.
<br><br>
The two girls, Elizabeth and Libby, were both stunned when they heard the whole conversation.
<br><br>
Zen had already exhibited too much unknown power back in the battle between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race. However, it wasn't until now that they realized their knowledge of Zen was only the tip of the iceberg.
<br><br>
"Then what should I do now?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
"Take out the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization,"
<br><br>
the green figure replied.
<br><br>
Then, Zen brought out the square, box-like Civilization Artifact from his inner world once again.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The edge of the Civilization Artifact began to glow with green light.
<br><br>
Then, rays of green light also flashed around the place.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before the green figure disappeared from the wall and in the next moment, reappeared on the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
At the same time, it said, "It is impossible to destroy the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, but because it was frozen, you cannot carry it. But, it can still help you since the core is now activated and connected to the Civilization Artifact."
<br><br>
"What can it help me do?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Calculate," the green figure replied simply.
<br><br>
Calculation was the foundation of the Calculation Civilization.
<br><br>
While Zen was still confused, the Primeval Lord of Heaven gently reminded him, "With the help of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, you can decipher Sanskrit words that you don't understand—and even the Abstruse Energy World."
<br><br>
"I see!"
<br><br>
Back then, he had to ask Geoffrey for help for him to read the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Thus, it would be very convenient if the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization could directly decipher the Sanskrit words. "Can we see the creatures in the Cold Prisons then?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," the green figure confirmed.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen put away the Civilization Artifact, then he and the two girls carried the Divine Fire Shield out of the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
When they came across a Cold Prison, the Civilization Artifact released a ray of green light, which illuminated the white spots in the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the big core began to glow brightly. It meant that it had started to calculate at an insane speed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3748 A Bald Giant After the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization performed more than half a minute of calculations, the Civilization Artifact released a green beam of light.
<br><br>
The green light then formed a light curtain, which outlined the hideous monster in the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
The monster had no head, only two round eyeballs. Its eyes blinked twice, which made it look frightening.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a thought popped inside Zen's mind. "Why can these monsters maintain their forms in the Abstruse Energy World?" he muttered.
<br><br>
He remembered that those monsters from the Abstruse Energy World he met before turned into tentacles after they entered the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
"It should be because of the extreme temperature. If the Cold Prisons were destroyed, then those light dots would return to their original forms," the green figure explained.
<br><br>
"But why are they sealed off here?" Elizabeth asked.
<br><br>
Her eyes were filled with curiosity as she observed them. She had passed by this place several times, and she felt awkward when she thought about how the monsters stared at her every time she was around.
<br><br>
"I don't know," the green figure said and shook its head. "The Cold Prisons already existed when we built the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization here, but at that time, there weren't so many of them," it mumbled.
<br><br>
Back then, there were only over a hundred Cold Prisons surrounding the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. Now, there were potholes everywhere, and there were tens of thousands of Cold Prisons.
<br><br>
"Maybe the Element Spirit Civilization captured and locked them here for study," said Libby, who stood beside them.
<br><br>
"That's possible," Zen agreed and nodded.
<br><br>
When the Calculation Civilization had managed to see the original appearance of the monsters, they also tried to communicate with them.
<br><br>
If the monsters were intelligent beings, then the Calculation Civilization could obtain information about the Abstruse Energy World from them.
<br><br>
Therefore, they tried every way they could, but they had failed every time.
<br><br>
In the end, they finally gave up.
<br><br>
Zen also planned to communicate with them but did not bother anymore when he heard about the Calculation Civilization's failed attempts.
<br><br>
Despite that, he unexpectedly gained a wonderful skill after he followed Elizabeth's advice to pass through the upper ice field and activated the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
True enough, he could decipher all the Sanskrit words and see through the light dots of the Abstruse Energy World through the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. His new ability was immensely useful to him and the Primeval Lord of Heaven. Still, the most important thing was the Calculation Civilization's goal was to create a real Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
If Yan could control the complete Energy Shaft, then that would easily solve all their problems! After the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization operated for a while, it stopped and became quiet. The calculation had consumed a large amount of energy.
<br><br>
"The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization has been here for so many years. With the way the Element Spirit Civilization does things, I'm afraid they will try their best to destroy it. Why did they just choose to seal it?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"They tried, but failed," the green figure said with a hint of pride.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization was not omnipotent.
<br><br>
For instance, the human race's Creation Myth Temple had stood on Stage Seventeen for so long, but the Element Spirit race couldn't do anything about it.
<br><br>
Once Zen was done asking some other questions, he continued to move towards the other end of the upper ice field under the Divine Fire Shield.
<br><br>
When he passed by the many large and small Cold Prisons, he also quietly observed them.
<br><br>
Some of the Cold Prisons were quite spacious and had many light dots inside them. Zen stopped in his tracks and asked the green figure to help him decipher them.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was now activated, so he could still rely on it no matter how far he was away from it or even if he was in the upper stages.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
His cinnabar field released two rays of green light which directly entered his pupils.
<br><br>
At that moment, he finally saw that the light dots in the Cold Prison in front of him were already in their original appearance. It turned out that sealed inside the Cold Prison was a bull-shaped monster.
<br><br>
Next, he proceeded to advance further and observed more kinds of creatures.
<br><br>
Elizabeth and Libby were curious and also wanted to see these creatures, so the green figure reflected the scene in their eyes. After they looked at a few strange monsters, however, they were no longer interested.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he felt a little disappointed as he observed them.
<br><br>
He wanted to find some traces of civilization from the monsters of the Abstruse Energy World, but after he had examined them for so long, it seemed that all the creatures in the Cold Prisons were very primitive.
<br><br>
The three of them saw a Cold Prison that was thirty miles wide on the ice field when they passed through a particular area.
<br><br>
This huge Cold Prison stood in front of them and blocked their way. "This Cold Prison is so huge!" Libby exclaimed as she stared ahead.
<br><br>
The biggest Cold Prison they saw before was only over a hundred feet wide, and they could easily go around it. This time, the one in front of them was thirty miles wide, and it would take a lot of effort to go around it.
<br><br>
"That's strange. This Cold Prison only appeared recently. I've never seen such a big one two years ago," Elizabeth commented.
<br><br>
The last time she had passed through the ice field was two years ago, and she did not see this big Cold Prison at that time.
<br><br>
"Let's see what's in this huge Cold Prison first," said Zen.
<br><br>
There were numerous white dots scattered around the Cold Prison. Of course, the creature sealed inside it must be massive in size! "Buzz..."
<br><br>
After the green light swept through the light dots, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization began to calculate again.
<br><br>
The Cold Prisons Zen had previously seen were all quite small and did not contain many light dots. Thus, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had quickly deciphered them. It only took about half a minute to complete the whole process.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, this thirty-mile wide Cold Prison had so many light dots inside, so it was much more complicated to calculate.
<br><br>
It was not until about an hour later that the green light entered Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
His jaw dropped as soon as he saw what was inside the Cold Prison. He couldn't help but take two steps back and almost dropped the Divine Fire Shield.
<br><br>
Luckily, Elizabeth was quick to react and immediately caught the Divine Fire Shield before it fell. At the same time, she asked, "What did you see? Why are you so excited?" "It's a giant..." he murmured.
<br><br>
It was a fat bald giant.
<br><br>
The giant wore handcuffs and shackles.
<br><br>
His bald head was down and his eyes were closed, as if he was asleep.
<br><br>
This was the first human-shaped creature that Zen had seen, so he was naturally a little excited.
<br><br>
Just as he was looking at the giant, the giant suddenly opened his eyes! "Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
The light spots in the Cold Prison fluctuated like mad. They were like countless sparks that rose when a bonfire was destroyed.
<br><br>
The giant struggled madly in Zen's sight. Then, the giant got up and grabbed at him who was outside the Cold Prison. This giant could move freely inside the big Cold Prison! "Hold the Divine Fire Shield tightly!" he warned.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, he held the Divine Fire Shield and quickly retreated.
<br><br>
In return, the giant's large hands stretched out from the Cold Prison and grabbed at their heads! Whoosh! In the blink of an eye, Zen had retreated about four thousand feet with the protection of the Divine Fire Shield. Thankfully, there was no Cold Prison behind them. If there was, then the consequences were unimaginable.
<br><br>
Chapter 3749 Unable To Communicate It all happened so suddenly that Elizabeth and Libby barely had any time to react.
<br><br>
All they saw were light dots fluttering by like restless fireflies, and then a pair of giant hands reached out to grab their heads.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen's superior reactions came to their rescue.
<br><br>
Over and over again, the giant hands were only inches from them. The girls felt incredibly unsafe and in serious danger.
<br><br>
But it all happened as quick as a flash and their astonishment didn't last long. When they had come to their senses, the giant hands had extended to their limit.
<br><br>
Dark cyan chain was wrapped tightly around the wrists of the giant hands, tingling and clanging.
<br><br>
At the same time, a rhythmic tune could be heard coming from the Cold Prison. It was as melodious and pleasant to the ears as singing, yet a hint of anger was clearly hidden within.
<br><br>
"That sound is very similar to the one from the soul cloud in the Soul City!"
<br><br>
Libby remarked.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
It had been many years since Elizabeth had passed through the Soul City and so this had not occurred to her immediately.
<br><br>
But Zen and Libby had just come from the Soul City and so it was still fresh in their minds.
<br><br>
"Bang! Bang! Bang! "
<br><br>
The pair of giant hands slapped down on the ice, sending waves of ice shards flying through the air with every slam.
<br><br>
They shot in all directions and flew like invisible weapons, one of them hitting Elizabeth in the arm. Even though she had already stepped in the Holy Soul Realm, the ice fragment still pierced her skin, causing her to let out a muffled groan.
<br><br>
"Get behind me!"
<br><br>
Zen turned the Divine Fire Shield around and stood in front of the girls to block them from the ice fragments.
<br><br>
The giant slapped the ground a dozen times before he finally tired himself out.
<br><br>
Such a terribly cold environment affected the giant as well. Due to this, a layer of white frost had condensed on the surface of his skin. Clapping the ice violently had actually created about a dozen cracks across his arms.
<br><br>
The pair of giant hands then slowly retracted into the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
To Elizabeth's and Libby's eyes, the hands turned to a stack of incomprehensible white light dots as they retracted.
<br><br>
"The bald giant seems afraid of the cold too, but why isn't the extremely low temperature in the Cold Prison affecting him?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The temperature in the Cold Prison could almost not go any lower. Any creature sucked into it should die.
<br><br>
According to Zen's observations in the Deleting Space, the creatures in the Abstruse Energy World were not immortal.
<br><br>
"It's their form. Their form allows them to avoid the damage of the low temperature," the green figure replied.
<br><br>
The Abstruse Energy State was different from the rest. If one wanted to destroy them in the Abstruse Energy State, they certainly couldn't use ordinary means.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in understanding.
<br><br>
From what he saw, the bald giant opened his mouth, waved his hands and roared endlessly in the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
But what he heard was a melodious and rhythmic song.
<br><br>
It was perhaps the expression he could see on the giant's face that gave him the sense of anger in the song.
<br><br>
"Can you decipher what he is saying?" Zen inquired.
<br><br>
"I can give it a go," the green figure said.
<br><br>
The Calculation Civilization wouldn't miss this chance to communicate with a creature from the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
However, this was also the first time the Calculation Civilization would attempt to translate the sounds of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
A lack of previous samples for reference meant it would take much longer to decipher the song.
<br><br>
Since Zen had come this far, he was in no rush to move on to Stage Thirtyone of the Other Shore. After asking for Libby's and Elizabeth's opinions, he decided to wait on the spot.
<br><br>
This time, the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization calculated for more than twenty hours.
<br><br>
Day and night did not actually exist in the Blooming Jade Stage, but around a day and a night had passed before the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization got a rough translation of the bald giant's language. It was made easier by the fact the giant used simple words.
<br><br>
"He is cursing the Element Spirit race...
<br><br>
He says that the members of the Element Spirit race are cunning swindlers who lured him to this damned place..."
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Zen now began to understand the situation a little more.
<br><br>
The bald giant appeared to have been tricked into entering this world by the Element Spirit race, and then imprisoned in this damned place.
<br><br>
Anyone would be as angry as he was after being imprisoned for so long. It was understandable that he wanted to tear apart any creature he came across.
<br><br>
Zen and the girls had been waiting for a whole day and night and the bald giant had sung the entire time. His resentment towards the creatures in the chaos was quite clear.
<br><br>
"Is there any way to communicate with him?" Zen asked hopefully.
<br><br>
Since he was capable of using language, communication with him should be possible. Zen would not waste the chance to get speak to him.
<br><br>
"We have only deciphered part of his words. We can try, but I'm afraid it's difficult to imitate the way he speaks," the green figure said.
<br><br>
The bald giant's speech seemed to have multiple syllables and when he spoke it sounded as if more than ten people spoke together.
<br><br>
The green figure taught Zen a rough method of pronunciation, and he then walked off singing.
<br><br>
Just as he began singing, the bald giant suddenly stopped. He stared intensely at Zen with eyes wide open.
<br><br>
'Does he understand me?' Zen's heart filled with joy. He continued walking forward, and at the same time, singing what he wished to say.
<br><br>
But then, the giant pounced and an enormous hand appeared once more, drawing a large arc as it slapped down towards the three of them.
<br><br>
"Retreat!"
<br><br>
Zen frowned and retreated under the cover of the Divine Fire Shield.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The gigantic hand left a mark of five fingers on the solid ice surface. The bald giant snickered and slowly withdrew his hand.
<br><br>
"Your song must be very unpleasant to the ears," Elizabeth said with a cheeky smile.
<br><br>
Zen shrugged helplessly. "I suppose I don't sing the right way."
<br><br>
The giant's way of speaking involved multiple syllables.
<br><br>
Expressing it through a human's way of speaking was incredibly difficult.
<br><br>
It was possible that despite Zen singing for a long time, the bald giant didn't understand a word.
<br><br>
Zen tried a few more times, even asking the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess to brain storm solutions, but all attempts failed.
<br><br>
The bald giant maintained a furious frown, reacting violently to Zen's every approach.
<br><br>
Feeling helpless, Zen had to give up, for now.
<br><br>
After bypassing the thirty-mile wide Cold Prison, they continued towards the other side of the upper ice field.
<br><br>
The Cold Prisons were in the center of the whole ice field. Once they left this area, moving forward would be easy.
<br><br>
Several hours later, they finally arrived at the other side of the upper ice field.
<br><br>
Elizabeth chose a spot and melted a cave a thousand feet deep beneath the ice.
<br><br>
Going down the cave, they reached the lower ice field.
<br><br>
Chapter 3750 Magical Thunder Slave The lower ice field of the Blooming Jade Stage was still frozen solid and there were even snowflakes continuously falling from the sky.
<br><br>
Still, the cold here was more bearable than that at the upper ice field.
<br><br>
Even if they removed the Divine Fire Shield, the temperature remained pleasantly cool like they were in a breezy field in the middle of spring.
<br><br>
A circular ice castle loomed in the distance. It looked fantastical given its smooth, azure surface, as if everything about the castle was carved entirely out of solid ice.
<br><br>
The entirety of the Blooming Jade Stage was largely controlled by the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
There was a total of six ice castles in the lower ice field, five of which were distributed in the middle of the ice field. All star rings were placed in this last one.
<br><br>
"Follow me!" Elizabeth said.
<br><br>
After putting away the Divine Fire Shield, she took Zen and Libby with her to approach the side of the ice castle.
<br><br>
Just as they were some distance away, she advised Zen and Libby to find a place to wait while she headed straight into the castle alone.
<br><br>
Zen took her warning to heart and was instinctively on guard as Elizabeth's figure disappeared.
<br><br>
The Blooming Jade Stage was the most important gathering place for the Element Spirit race and there was no way they were simply going to let Zen pass through peacefully. The race's defense must be at the maximum.
<br><br>
In fact, Zen's assumptions weren't wrong. The Element Spirit race had indeed dispatched a lot of soldiers to guard the first few ice castles.
<br><br>
However, they never expected Elizabeth to help him sneak into the last castle through the upper ice field.
<br><br>
Despite their sneaky efforts, however, Elizabeth knew that this last ice castle was heavily guarded and she did not want Zen to break in by force. In order to avoid any untoward incidents, she wanted to scope out the area and check the situation by herself first.
<br><br>
News of the Sun Crow race's defeat had already spread.
<br><br>
However, the matter that Elizabeth, Micah, and the other members of the Sun Crow race had switched sides remained a secret.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race was not aware of these members' betrayal. All surviving members of the Sun Crow race told the same narrative: they survived the battle with the Oneness Sky Palace and then hid themselves after escaping from the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
It was difficult to verify their claims so, in the end, the Element Spirit race still regarded Elizabeth as someone who could be trusted.
<br><br>
When she arrived at the gates, she found it guarded by two Chill Ice Slaves.
<br><br>
Chill Ice Slaves could morph into various forms. Right now, they looked like strange insects with strong, slender legs for speed and blade-covered bodies for defense.
<br><br>
As Elizabeth approached, one of the Chill Ice Slaves took a step forward.
<br><br>
All seven blades that covered his body were pointed at her, closing in on her from both sides.
<br><br>
The suddenness of the act and the inherently cold temperature of the blades made Elizabeth tremble.
<br><br>
These Chill Ice Slaves were more powerful than Moon Fire Slaves and the environment of Stage Thirty was advantageous to them. Even if Elizabeth had been to Stage Thirty-two, she might not be a match against them here.
<br><br>
"Show me your token," the Chill Ice Slave ordered brusquely.
<br><br>
Elizabeth obliged, stretching out her hand and summoning the small, triangular token from her Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
Although the Element Spirit race controlled the Blooming Jade Stage, they weren't previously as strict when it came to controlling the passages.
<br><br>
However, things quickly changed after the war between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race broke out.
<br><br>
The Chill Ice Slave took Elizabeth's token and pinched it. After the edge of the token flashed with a ray of light, it was returned to Elizabeth. "Enter through the left door."
<br><br>
Her face flashed with a strange expression when she heard the arrangement.
<br><br>
All the star rings should be behind the middle door. Why did the Chill Ice Slave tell her to go through the left one? She didn't really have a choice though. She had already come to the ice castle and there was no reason for her not to follow the order of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
As she entered through the left door, Elizabeth noticed the floor flash blue from the thin layer of Soul Restraining Sand that covered it.
<br><br>
She had a bad feeling about this.
<br><br>
Before she could venture forth, Elizabeth decided to turn back and flap her wings in an effort to escape.
<br><br>
Swish! She immediately tried to take off and scale along the side of the castle.
<br><br>
However, as she began to rise, a handful of Soul Restraining Sand blew towards her.
<br><br>
Elizabeth spun in the air, her wings stirring up strong winds.
<br><br>
The strong gale got rid of most of the Soul Restraining Sand. Unfortunately, a few grains found their way to the surface of her Holy Soul which meant she wasn't going to be able to leave the Other Shore anytime soon.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The two Chill Ice Slaves, who stood guard in front of the ice castle, bent down and four, silvery wings grew out of their bodies as they rushed towards Elizabeth at an extremely fast speed.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Their bodies were covered with blades that began to spiral, making them look like two, mobile mixers.
<br><br>
Elizabeth was well aware of just how powerful these Chill Ice Slaves were.
<br><br>
In order to avoid them, she dove down sharply before rising up at the last moment. With the crisis momentarily averted, she decided to fly close to the ground outside the castle.
<br><br>
Her wings flashed with golden light and the divine flames fluttered in the wind like heralding flags. The fire swirled around those two Chill Ice Slaves who continued to chase after her so closely.
<br><br>
Although the Chill Ice Slaves were stronger than the Moon Fire Slaves, they had one weakness: fearing fire.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race was made up of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth spirits. These Chill Ice Slaves were actually borne from water spirits.
<br><br>
Although they were fast, they had no choice but to slow down in order to avoid Elizabeth's flames. This led to a wider gap between them and her.
<br><br>
Just as Elizabeth breathed more easily and figured that she might be able to get lucky and escape, an explosion suddenly came from inside the ice castle.
<br><br>
When she looked, she saw a ball of lightning that had risen into the air. This ball of lightning contained a rough outline of a person.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
There was a sharp sound as the ball of lightning exploded and rushed towards Elizabeth at breakneck speed.
<br><br>
It wasn't in the Element Spirit race's nature to participate in fights directly and they preferred to create all kinds of slaves to serve as their champions in battle.
<br><br>
The creature formed by this ball of lightning was called the Magical Thunder Slave! Elizabeth was in trouble now. If the Chill Ice Slaves were already powerful, this Magical Thunder Slave was a few notches stronger! Crack! Crack! Before the deafening explosion could reach her ears, Elizabeth had used all her strength to roll forward.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
She felt a wave of power behind her as the explosion caused devastating ruin and created a deep hole on the ground. It was fortunate that she was able to get away.
<br><br>
There was no time to see the extent of the damage. She was able to dodge once but she had to keep moving! "Kof, kof, kof..."
<br><br>
Streaks of lightning revealed the slave's face and his irregular smile.
<br><br>
From behind her, the Magical Thunder Slave had transformed into a bolt of lightning that was determined to strike her down. The face formed by the lightning quickly twisted and finally turned into a straight line, hitting her body precisely.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
There was a sickeningly loud sound that echoed through Elizabeth's ears as she was sent up into the sky by the lightning, rolling like a leaf in the wind.
<br><br>
Fortunately, she had achieved the Holy Soul so her injuries weren't so serious.
<br><br>
Had she only been an Indigo Soul then she would've already been shattered.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
As Elizabeth fell from the sky, the Magical Thunder Slave rushed towards her.
<br><br>
When she landed, she hit the ground hard and rolled thousands of feet before stopping.
<br><br>
"Those who betray our Element Spirit race never have a good ending..."
<br><br>
Elizabeth heard another thunderous roar as the Magical Thunder Slave's body gathered terrifying lightning energy and became blindingly white.
<br><br>
Chapter 3751 Imprisoning Lightning Elizabeth lay on the ground and stared at the gradually brightening Magical Thunder Slave. Her face darkened with despair.
<br><br>
Not long ago, she had contacted the Element Spirit race, and conferred with Micah and the others in Stage Thirty-two.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race, still regarding the "losers" of the Sun Crow race as their allies, had not been on guard against them.
<br><br>
How could her secret have been exposed as soon as she entered the ice castle? At this point, however, the reason hardly mattered.
<br><br>
The fact was that Elizabeth was no match for the Magical Thunder Slave.
<br><br>
Indeed, after fending off his first two attacks, she was already exhausted.
<br><br>
She was certain that she couldn't withstand the next one.
<br><br>
At that moment, unbidden, the thought of Zen came into Elizabeth's mind.
<br><br>
Zen and Libby were hiding not far away, and she hoped dearly that the Magical Thunder Slave and the Chill Ice Slaves would not be able to find them.
<br><br>
A crash of thunder was heard in the air.
<br><br>
The Magical Thunder Slave rushed towards Elizabeth, launching his next attack. She waited helplessly for the onslaught.
<br><br>
But as the lightning approached Elizabeth, a figure darted forward from the side.
<br><br>
It was Zen.
<br><br>
Elizabeth had led them competently and cautiously through the upper ice field.
<br><br>
Moreover, she had been calm and confident as she entered the ice castle, so Zen had believed that she would pass through safely.
<br><br>
To his surprise, not long after she entered the ice castle, she had been chased out.
<br><br>
Zen and Libby were crouched together in an ice pit, concealing themselves.
<br><br>
At the unmistakable sound of thunder and battle, Zen had warily poked his head out of the ice pit, determined to see what was happening. He'd seen and understood Elizabeth's plight, and immediately jumped out of the pit to aid her.
<br><br>
Libby tried to stop him, but Zen went anyway.
<br><br>
Libby sighed. It was already a risk for them to sneak through the Blooming Jade Stage! Now that Zen had revealed himself, they wouldn't be able to hide any longer.
<br><br>
Zen moved with such speed that the air whistled past him.
<br><br>
He reached out and tried to grasp the lightning as it struck at Elizabeth.
<br><br>
To his astonishment, he found that it was the real body of the Magical Thunder Slave, which writhed like a lightning snake most of the time.
<br><br>
"So, you dare to try and catch me!"
<br><br>
The Magical Thunder Slave spoke in a sneering voice, but he was also caught by surprise at how Zen had seemingly rushed out of nowhere.
<br><br>
Moreover, Zen had appeared with a physical body, and the Magical Thunder Slave wondered to which race he belonged. Who would dare to help Elizabeth in the Blooming Jade Stage? The Magical Thunder Slave hesitated for a moment before realizing that he couldn't see Zen's face clearly. It meant this warrior had entered the Other Shore with his physical body.
<br><br>
He immediately realized that Zen might be the human brat long sought by his superiors on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But how had he passed through the other ice castles? As far as the Magical Thunder Slave knew, the Magical Thunder Slaves, the Chill Ice Slaves, and the Moon Fire Slaves—all stronger than himself—had already made those ice castles impassable.
<br><br>
It should have been impossible for Zen to come through...
<br><br>
But since he was here, safe and sound, that could only mean that Zen had somehow broken through all the strong lines of defense that barred his way.
<br><br>
Then it must be that Zen's power was far greater than it appeared at first glance.
<br><br>
As the Magical Thunder Slave considered these implications, he hesitated, yet remained confused and vigilant about Zen's strength.
<br><br>
But anyway, the Magical Thunder Slave was among the most powerful of the Element Spirit race. He did not believe that Zen could defeat him directly. And as for how Zen had arrived here, well, there must be some hidden reason he could not see.
<br><br>
The Magical Thunder Slave was half right. It was true that Zen didn't arrive here through normal way. But he was wrong about Zen's power. Zen was definitely strong enough to defeat him in a fight.
<br><br>
There was a sizzling noise, as though from an electric current.
<br><br>
Zen kept his grip on the lightning, but it was very thick and wiry in his hand.
<br><br>
Like a snake, the lightning coiled around his hands and up his arms, twisting around his neck.
<br><br>
It released the terrifying power of thunder as it moved along Zen's body, corroding his physical body and rapidly consuming his Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The Truth of Godly Way could be used to restore the Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's body, but it was not quickly enough to match the speed of the lightning attack.
<br><br>
"This Magical Thunder Slave is indeed extremely powerful. Primeval Lord of Heaven, please help me!" aloud he said.
<br><br>
Zen had been also well-prepared before coming to this place.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had a deep understanding of the Element Spirit race, so he must know the ways of restraining them.
<br><br>
However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was not an invincible existence. His physical body was still trapped in Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Currently, he was just an energy soul. But with the help of the power of a Civilization Artifact, he was able to defeat those weak members of the Element Spirit race in and below Stage Twenty-eight.
<br><br>
But the Blooming Jade Stage—where Zen, Elizabeth, and Libby now found themselves—was already Stage Thirty.
<br><br>
In this stage, due to weaker and weaker suppression, the creatures of the Other Shore became stronger and stronger.
<br><br>
Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't have the confidence to win by himself in an encounter with the Magical Thunder Slave, so he needed to rely on Zen.
<br><br>
A buzzing sound filled the air.
<br><br>
After Zen voiced his request, sparks of purple light flashed in his hands.
<br><br>
They traveled from his skin and into the body of the Magical Thunder Slave, which was still entwined around Zen's body.
<br><br>
The effect of the purple light was quick and remarkable. As the purple light shone on the Magical Thunder Slave, his body became solid and opaque, turning into a muddy, grayish-brown substance.
<br><br>
"What have you done?" asked the Magical Thunder Slave, sounding shocked.
<br><br>
He wrapped himself more tightly around Zen's body and frantically released the power of thunder.
<br><br>
The Magical Thunder Slave had already been amazed when, upon his attack, Zen managed to resist for several seconds.
<br><br>
But after all, he had heard that Zen's physical body was incomparable, and that he had even become the ruler of Stage Fourteen. So the Magical Thunder Slave was prepared for an extraordinary display of strength. Still, he had never imagined that Zen would be able to release a theurgy capable of altering his lightning form! The Magical Thunder Slave lived in the lightning form. That made him an immensely difficult enemy, for as an entity of pure energy he was capable of powerful attacks and was virtually immortal.
<br><br>
The purple light was the work of the Primeval Lord of Heaven. It was called the Imprisoning Lightning.
<br><br>
When it was first conceived, the Imprisoning Lightning was not used as a weapon against the Magical Thunder Slaves.
<br><br>
A long time ago, the group of human heroes led by the Primeval Lord of Heaven ended up being trapped in the Heavenly Thunder Plain of Stage Thirty-three. At that time, the 77th civilization hadn't been destroyed. All the human masters, including the Primeval Lord of Heaven, didn't dare to return to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was forced into seclusion in the chaos for a long while before he finally created the Imprisoning Lightning and led the human masters back to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Imprisoning Lightning was not intended to destroy thunder. Instead, it acted to infuse another unique energy into the electric force of thunder.
<br><br>
When the Imprisoning Lightning merged with the thunder, the thunder would be converted into another form.
<br><br>
After the Primeval Lord of Heaven released the purple light of the Imprisoning Lightning, the lightning that covered the entire plain turned into grayish brown objects that fell onto the ground. The Heavenly Thunder Plain, which had been rumbling for billions of years, became quiet for perhaps the first time in known history.
<br><br>
Now, the Imprisoning Lightning that had silenced the lightning of the Heavenly Thunder Plain also had an astounding effect on the Magical Thunder Slave.
<br><br>
The purple light was not released by the Civilization Artifact—it was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's own theurgy.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven in Zen's body was just an energy soul, so he could only release the Imprisoning Lightning at a very close range. In this case, Zen had needed to get as close as possible to the Magical Thunder Slave to ensure the effectiveness of the attack.
<br><br>
The purple light flashed as it was emitted from Zen's hands, continuing to pass through the lightning body of the Magical Thunder Slave.
<br><br>
To his horror, the Magical Thunder Slave realized that his range of movement was becoming more and more limited as his body turned into a solid grayish-brown substance. He felt stiff, almost as though he had been paralyzed.
<br><br>

<br><br>
It was a kind of material that was formed after lightning was solidified, but the lightning's energy still remained in the powdered form.
<br><br>
Back then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked some powerful human warriors to collect the brown substances on the Heavenly Thunder Plain, and later he ground them into Solid Lightning Powder.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, a considerable amount of Solid Lightning Powder could release an extremely terrifying amount of power.
<br><br>
For instance, there was a time when a Divine Retribution Beast hunted down humans on Stage Thirty-three. The human warriors suffered many casualties, but when their lives were finally at stake, the Primeval Lord of Heaven threw a large amount of Solid Lightning Powder into the giant mouth of the Divine Retribution Beast.
<br><br>
After that came an explosion, then the lightning bolts that erupted formed a large circular ball of lightning! It unleashed such a powerful force that even the Primeval Lord of Heaven himself was shocked. After all, they did collect those lightning bolts on the Heavenly Thunder Plain for several days, so it surely had a strong effect.
<br><br>
When the attack badly mutilated the Divine Retribution Beast's head, the human warriors survived.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen didn't know where the Imprisoning Lightning came from, but he wouldn't let the opportunity pass, especially when the Magical Thunder Slave had shown up with a form.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
As he kneaded the greyish-brown substances with both of his hands, they quickly pulverized into powder and scattered all over the ground.
<br><br>
"No!"
<br><br>
"You... You can't do this!"
<br><br>
"Stop!" the Magical Thunder Slave roared continuously from the last section of the lightning bolt.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the Moon Fire Slaves and the Chill Ice Slaves all had spiritual cores.
<br><br>
Those spiritual cores were their life source, so they needed to conceal them well when they were in battle. If their spiritual cores were damaged, they would die.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Magical Thunder Slaves didn't have spiritual cores, because they didn't die easily with their special life forms.
<br><br>
That was why the Magical Thunder Slave didn't expect Zen knew the way to kill him! Despite that, he refused to give up even in his death. He struggled and roared, and his cries pounded in Zen's ears like thunder.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he acted as if he didn't hear anything.
<br><br>
He simply unleashed the Imprisoning Lightning and crushed the Magical Thunder Slave into powdery bits.
<br><br>
When only the Magical Thunder Slave's last section remained, he transformed into a human face and begged for his life, but Zen didn't give him any chance.
<br><br>
A purple beam of light flashed, then the human face became powder in Zen's fingers. "How… How did you kill a Magical Thunder Slave so easily?" Elizabeth, who lay on the ice, uttered in disbelief.
<br><br>
She used to work for the Element Spirit race, so she was familiar with the Magical Thunder Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves.
<br><br>
The ever-changing Magical Thunder Slaves had left a deep impression on her. After all, they were powerful, indestructible, and immensely fast. They were almost perfect creatures that were born to fight.
<br><br>
However, such a powerful being didn't survive for five minutes in Zen's hands.
<br><br>
This man… Now, Zen didn't know what Elizabeth was thinking. He stared attentively at the two Chill Ice Slaves nearby and asked, "What should we do now? Break in directly?"
<br><br>
Unfortunately, he didn't know the situation in the ice castle. If no one guarded the ice castle like on Stage Twenty-eight, he would just charge straight in and head upwards to Stage Thirty-one.
<br><br>
Even though Elizabeth was weak now, her mind was still sharp. "Charge in!" she immediately ordered.
<br><br>
According to her judgment, the Element Spirit race would place most of their forces in the first few ice castles while the last ice castle wouldn't be heavily guarded. However, it didn't matter much because Zen had already killed a Magical Thunder Slave.
<br><br>
Zen pulled Elizabeth up from the ground and said to Libby, "Follow me!"
<br><br>
Libby nodded while the wings on Elizabeth's back began to glow with a golden light. Despite her frail state, she could still control the divine flames of the Sun Crow race to defend against attacks.
<br><br>
The two Chill Ice Slaves that saw Zen kill the Magical Thunder Slave were also afraid of him now. When they found out that he was about to break into the ice castle, they had no choice but to defend despite their fear.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to move forward, however, the ice castle suddenly shook, and waves of reddish-brown soil burst forth from it! The mass of soil carried strong waves of energy as well.
<br><br>
As soon as it was released, it quickly turned into multiple humans made of soil! "Burial Earth Slaves!" Elizabeth exclaimed.
<br><br>
These Burial Earth Slaves also belonged to Five-Element Slaves. Although they moved slowly, they had powerful defensive power. They were harder to kill than the Magical Thunder Slaves! Had they guarded the ice castle, then Zen and his company would have a difficult time breaking in.
<br><br>
"No matter what kind of slave they are, we can only break in by force!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
With that, he gritted his teeth and rushed towards the ice castle! But when he was halfway, a blue beam of light flashed from the inside of the ice castle, and snow-white figures came out of it. They were Chill Ice Slaves, and there were probably more than a dozen of them! With so many Burial Earth Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves that surrounded the ice castle, it was almost impossible for Zen to break in by force.
<br><br>
He stopped abruptly, and his face turned grim.
<br><br>
He and Libby were able to retreat from the Other Shore, but Elizabeth would die there. Furthermore, the Element Spirit race would likely send more forces to guard the place after they left, and he would never expect to return to the Other Shore again.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom…"
<br><br>
Deafening roars sounded from afar, and streaks of lightning chased after them.
<br><br>
It turned out that the Magical Thunder Slaves from the other ice castles immediately came after they got the news.
<br><br>
Everything became worse now that they couldn't break into the ice castle, and an army of Magical Thunder Slaves surrounded them from behind.
<br><br>
There was almost no way to escape! "Before the Soul Restraining Sand taints both of you… You'd better leave the Other Shore now…" Elizabeth croaked.
<br><br>
She also knew the consequence if Zen retreated from the Other Shore, but at least he could save his life. Besides, there was no other choice.
<br><br>
Zen suddenly looked up and said, "No, there's another way..."
<br><br>
Upon hearing his words, Elizabeth and Libby immediately realized what he was talking about.
<br><br>
He meant to flee back to the upper ice field! The ice cave they had just dug wasn't completely frozen yet, but there was a layer of ice pieces that had solidified. Nevertheless, they still had a chance to go up and escape.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
The second Zen made his decision, he pulled Libby, hoisted Elizabeth on his back, then flew upward! The two Chill Ice Slaves not far away saw that he wanted to escape, but they wouldn't let him get away so easily.
<br><br>
They flapped their wings and quickly followed them! "Humph!" Elizabeth snorted coldly.
<br><br>
Her golden wings suddenly shook, then the blazing divine flames of the Sun Crow race swept down like fire clouds and forced the two Chill Ice Slaves back.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
In less than nine seconds, Zen finally entered the ice cave. As the golden flames burned inside it, the icicles all around it melted.
<br><br>
Afterwards, he went through the ice sheet and climbed up to the upper ice field. At the same time, Elizabeth took out and ignited the Divine Fire Shield, which covered the top of their heads.
<br><br>
While Zen held the Divine Fire Shield in one hand, pulled Libby with the other, and carried Elizabeth on his back, he swiftly ran on the intensely cold upper ice field.
<br><br>
Chapter 3753 A Trap At The Dead End Not long after Zen and the two girls passed through the ice cave, the two Chill Ice Slaves caught up with them.
<br><br>
The other kinds of Five-Element Slaves wouldn't be able to cope under extremely low temperatures, but the Chill Ice Slaves' body temperature was also quite low. Thus, it wasn't hard for them to survive in such an environment.
<br><br>
As soon as the Chill Ice Slaves, who were crystal clear, rushed to the upper ice field, white frost immediately covered the surface of their bodies. They were immensely flexible before, but now they were also a bit slow.
<br><br>
"Follow them!"
<br><br>
"Summon the other Five-Element Slaves to attack them!"
<br><br>
The two Chill Ice Slaves hadn't forgotten the miserable death of the Magical Thunder Slave, so they were smart enough not to make a move immediately, but instead, followed Zen and his companions behind.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen occasionally observed the movements behind him as he sped forward.
<br><br>
"What do they mean by closely following us like this?" Libby asked.
<br><br>
"That's the most troublesome," Elizabeth said and shook her head.
<br><br>
If Zen could get rid of them, then the three of them could find a place and wait for the Soul Restraining Sand on Elizabeth's body to lose effect there.
<br><br>
After that, they could silently leave the Other Shore to avoid any trouble and consider how to enter Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore later.
<br><br>
However, they couldn't leave the Other Shore at all because the Chill Ice Slaves followed them everywhere.
<br><br>
"We have to find a way to get rid of them!" Zen said with gritted teeth.
<br><br>
The wind ran through his hair as he continued to rush forward at high speed.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks.
<br><br>
"Buzz—"
<br><br>
Once he steadied himself on the icy surface, he ran towards the two Chill Ice Slaves in the opposite direction.
<br><br>
Of course, the two Chill Ice Slaves were also very vigilant.
<br><br>
The moment Zen stopped moving forward, they stopped as well. When they saw him rush towards them, they flapped their wings and quickly retreated.
<br><br>
They always kept a distance of about a thousand feet from Zen, which was neither near nor too far.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen felt helpless when he realized that he couldn't catch up with the Chill Ice Slaves.
<br><br>
Thus, he had no choice but to turn back and move forward.
<br><br>
At the same time, the ice in another area of the upper ice field broke. A cold wind blew through it, and a huge ice cave appeared.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
A giant fiery hand stretched out from the ice cave and pressed on its edge.
<br><br>
Then, a huge body covered in green flames jumped out from it. It was a Moon Fire Slave! "Wow! It's so cold!" the Moon Fire Slave exclaimed as he shivered.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the Moon Fire Slaves weren't suited to the immensely cold environment in the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
Therefore, they had to take extra protection measures if they wanted to climb to the upper ice field.
<br><br>
Now, the armor on the Moon Fire Slave's body was similar to the Divine Fire Shield.
<br><br>
As long as the armor was injected with a certain amount of flames, they could resist the intense coldness and low temperature.
<br><br>
Still, the Moon Fire Slaves were annoyed at the severely low temperature.
<br><br>
Yet, they were given an order. They were surprised when they heard that the human man they had been waiting for actually fled to the upper ice field.
<br><br>
Then again, they didn't have to stay in the cold for too long as long as they captured that man and fulfilled their mission.
<br><br>
At that moment, tall and big Moon Fire Slaves came out of the square ice cave one by one.
<br><br>
Once the Moon Fire Slaves confirmed their target's location, they ran towards that direction at full speed. Although the ice was a thousand feet thick, it trembled like there was an earthquake since so many Moon Fire Slaves ran over it.
<br><br>
While that happened, an ice hole in a size of a bowl appeared in another area of the upper ice field.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Thick streaks of thunder emerged from the ice hole.
<br><br>
Then, Magical Thunder Slaves, which looked like long snakes, swirled in the air and quickly turned into strange and abstract human shapes.
<br><br>
They all silently confirmed the location of their target. Then, they went straight in that direction.
<br><br>
They immediately intertwined and elongated into much longer snakes, then moved forward at an extremely high speed.
<br><br>
It turned out that the two Chill Ice Slaves regularly sent Zen's location to their companions. The Five-Element Slaves formed a huge circle and charged from all directions.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Zen's eyes slightly darkened when he heard the rumble of thunder again.
<br><br>
He looked to the left and saw a burst of thunder in the distance. He knew that the Magical Thunder Slaves must be near.
<br><br>
"Dong, dong, dong..."
<br><br>
At that point, the ground began to shake rhythmically as well. Then, more tall Moon Fire Slaves chased them from another side.
<br><br>
These Five-Element Slaves' momentum became increasingly palpable, and Zen and his companions had a slimmer chance to retreat.
<br><br>
After he ran forward for a while, he saw a Cold Prison which was dozens of miles wide.
<br><br>
There were Five-Element Slaves in three directions, while in front of them was the Cold Prison, which was a forbidden area.
<br><br>
Zen and the two girls truly had no escape. "What should we do?" Libby bit her lip.
<br><br>
She was still young. She didn't want to die, nor did she want her Soul of Light to be trapped in the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
Zen did not respond to Libby. He just frowned and slowly stepped back against the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Just then, he heard the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice that said, "Zen, get close to that Cold Prison!"
<br><br>
"Get close to the Cold Prison?" He was confused.
<br><br>
The bald giant confined in the largest Cold Prison was dangerous. When it came to strength alone, he was more powerful than all the Five-Element Slaves.
<br><br>
If Zen recklessly went closer to it, the bald giant would attack him.
<br><br>
Wouldn't that be courting death? "That bald giant should hate the Element Spirit race more than he hates you," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied simply.
<br><br>
Zen arched one brow upon hearing those words.
<br><br>
There was a dead end ahead of them.
<br><br>
Even with the Primeval Lord of Heaven's help, it would be difficult for him to defeat so many Five-Element Slaves.
<br><br>
But if the Primeval Lord of Heaven's assumption was true, then that might be a solution.
<br><br>
According to the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, the Element Spirit race had captured the bald giant, so the giant must loathe them the most.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen nodded and said to the green figure, "Please help me activate the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization. I want to see the inside of the Cold Prison!"
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization in the distance was activated again.
<br><br>
Since the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had already deciphered the light dots in the Cold Prison before, it was now more skilled in doing the task.
<br><br>
Two rays of green light entered Zen's pupils, and he quickly saw the inside of the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
He was taken aback.
<br><br>
The bald giant was already over the edge of the Cold Prison. His bell-like eyes were wide open; his body lunged forward; and overall he looked like he was ready to pounce at any time.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was right about one thing: that this bald giant couldn't hate the Element Spirit Civilization more. He always wanted to tear up the members of the Element Spirit race. Now that he saw the FiveElement Slaves, he even intended to swallow them alive.
<br><br>
Of course, the Moon Fire Slaves didn't understand the light spots in the Cold Prison, nor did they know that there was a powerful giant inside of it who had his eyes on them. They only knew that there was a dead-end behind Zen and that he couldn't retreat.
<br><br>
"Human boy, you cannot escape now. If you obediently follow us back, we can still keep you alive," the Moon Fire Slave in the front of their group said with a sinister smile.
<br><br>
This Moon Fire Slave planned to drill an ice cave from their current spot and return to the lower ice field because he hated the low temperature of the upper field so much.
<br><br>
However, Zen didn't respond to him, and instead, continued to step back.
<br><br>
The bald giant was bound in chains, so he could only attack within a range of three thousand feet around the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Now Zen was already within the three thousand feet range, but the bald giant still didn't move. It seemed that he indeed did not target Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3754 A Pair Of Giant Hands Both Libby and Elizabeth were also extremely nervous.
<br><br>
While they couldn't see the giant with their own eyes, they had already been attacked by his hands before.
<br><br>
If his strike landed, they would both have already been dead.
<br><br>
But they were left with no other choice.
<br><br>
Covered by the Divine Fire Shield, Zen retreated step by step.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Moon Fire Slaves moved forward at the same pace, with the Chill Ice Slaves and the Magical Thunder Slaves approaching from the other directions.
<br><br>
Three thousand feet...
<br><br>
Two thousand feet...
<br><br>
When Zen retreated to within two thousand feet from the Cold Prison, the Five-Element Slaves entered the bald giant's range of attack.
<br><br>
As he retreated, Zen observed the creature when he could.
<br><br>
The giant maintained his original posture, keeping his eyes wide open.
<br><br>
'The giant seems really calm, ' Zen thought to himself. 'Does he want to capture all these Five-Element Slaves in one go?' One thousand feet...
<br><br>
Five hundred feet...
<br><br>
Zen turned back frequently, which drew the Five-Element Slaves' attention.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slave leading the group chuckled, "Brat, why do you keep looking back? Can you see what's in the Cold Prison??"
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves, the Chill Ice Slaves, and the Magical Thunder Slaves all knew of the bald giant trapped in the Cold Prison. To get him in there, the Element Spirit race had to pour in great effort—as the slaves of this race, they had to do everything just to imprison the creature.
<br><br>
But now that the bald giant was trapped, he could barely move, and was no longer as threatening as he had been before.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Moon Fire Slave couldn't help but feel a bit confused by Zen's behavior.
<br><br>
Zen should have only been seeing light dots in the Cold Prison, so what was he looking at? As Zen continued retreating, he smiled as he said, "Of course I can."
<br><br>
"If you can see clearly, then can you tell me what lies in the Cold Prison?"
<br><br>
from the left, a Magical Thunder Slave sneered.
<br><br>
Naturally, none of them believed Zen could see within the prison.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed at the challenge.
<br><br>
It was a critical moment.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had correctly guessed the bald giant's mental state.
<br><br>
He had been intensely irritable since his imprisonment—he hated all creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was no wonder he launched an attack at Zen the moment he woke up.
<br><br>
Two reasons kept Zen from successfully communicating with the bald giant. On the one hand, he couldn't pronounce the Sanskrit words, and on the other hand, the bald giant was immediately hostile toward him.
<br><br>
But judging from how the giant patiently waited for the Five-Element Slaves to continue approaching, he was not stupid by any means.
<br><br>
And so now, Zen had to make sure the giant knew he was an enemy to the Five-Element Slaves.
<br><br>
While the giant possibly already knew the fact, Zen needed to deepen his impression.
<br><br>
An enemy's enemy was a friend, after all.
<br><br>
In his mind, Zen made contact with the Primeval Lord of Heaven. In mere seconds, he replied, "There is a bald giant in the Cold Prison."
<br><br>
Zen's answer completely stunned the Moon Fire Slaves. They hadn't expected him to get it right.
<br><br>
Could he truly see what was happening in the Cold Prison, they wondered? While they were stuck in a daze, Zen abruptly rushed forward, grasping the Divine Fire Shield in his hand. As he closed the distance, he called in his mind, 'Primeval Lord of Heaven, please take action!' He had to keep the shield in place to protect Elizabeth and Libby, hindering him from properly fighting. All he could do was leave it up to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
With an energy soul's strength, it was impossible for the Primeval Lord of Heaven to defeat all the Five-Element Slaves, but at the very least, he could easily kill off one or two Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
The moment Zen rushed forward rapidly, the shadow of the Primeval Lord of Heaven appeared, pointing ahead of him.
<br><br>
Buzz! Using the book's power, he shot out a ray of light from his fingertip.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In an instant, the ray pierced through the spiritual core within the body of the Moon Fire Slave right in front of the group.
<br><br>
The body began trembling instantaneously, the green flames in his body surging before getting extinguished in the next second. His armor disintegrated and fell to the ground.
<br><br>
By killing one of them, Zen wanted to signal to the giant that he was on the opposite side of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
From where he was, he couldn't quite tell if his action was effective enough.
<br><br>
He figured he'd have to leave it up to fate.
<br><br>
The moment the Moon Fire Slave was killed, Zen retreated.
<br><br>
In the next instant, he was flying over five hundred feet before reaching the edge of the Cold Prison. If he took another mere step, he would have fallen in.
<br><br>
Despite the Divine Fire Shield's protection, Zen and the two girls could still feel a chill creeping up their backs.
<br><br>
Zen had already killed one of their companions, and the Moon Fire Slave died because of his spiritual core breaking—this meant complete death.
<br><br>
All the Five-Element Slaves flew forward into a rage.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! Their initially gentle approach turned into a high-speed chase heading straight after Zen.
<br><br>
"Brat! How dare you! We won't let you die so easily!" roared one of the Moon Fire Slaves.
<br><br>
'What are you waiting for?' Zen thought to himself, turning back to the bald giant. To his surprise, the creature's eyes met his—it wasn't until that moment that Zen noticed a faint smile on the giant's face.
<br><br>
It seemed that the giant had just seen through him.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves were closing in on Zen, only worsening his anxiety.
<br><br>
If the giant didn't make a move, Zen was as good as dead at that moment.
<br><br>
When the Moon Fire Slaves were only about a hundred feet away from Zen and the girls, countless dots of light within the Cold Prison suddenly curled up.
<br><br>
A pair of giant hands extended from it, slamming down right before Zen.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
With an explosive sound, the pair of giant hands slapped about eight Moon Fire Slaves who were rushing ahead of the group on the icy surface.
<br><br>
The hands continued rolling on the ice.
<br><br>
It wasn't the bald giant's first time fighting the Element Spirit race, so he knew that the flame creatures were driven by spiritual cores.
<br><br>
By rolling his hands, he ground and crushed all the Moon Fire Slaves' armors, along with their bodies' spiritual cores.
<br><br>
When the giant raised his hands, only armor debris remained on the ice, while the Moon Fire Slaves perished along with their spiritual cores.
<br><br>
The Chill Ice Slaves and the Magical Thunder Slaves were all stunned by the sudden attack.
<br><br>
All of them froze abruptly.
<br><br>
Without anyone to give an order, they didn't know how to deal with the situation—they were all hesitant and stuck in place.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The giant's hands moved decisively toward the Chill Ice Slaves at an incredible speed—he swatted at them as though they were mere mosquitoes in summer.
<br><br>
The Chill Ice Slaves immediately changed their form once they saw the hands approaching.
<br><br>
But just as the Moon Fire Slaves did, the Chill Ice Slaves' lives depended on their spiritual cores. They only differed in that the Moon Fire Slaves had fire spiritual cores, while Chill Ice Slaves had water spiritual cores.
<br><br>
As the giant hands continued rolling over the icy surface, the Chill Ice Slaves perished.
<br><br>
And with that, the bald giant then targeted the Magical Thunder Slaves.
<br><br>
As it turned out, the bald giant was much smarter than Zen had expected.
<br><br>
The creature seemed to know that the Magical Thunder Slaves lacked spiritual cores, making them a more difficult kill. So his hands suddenly flew in the air, pushing the Magical Thunder Slaves into the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Chapter 3755 Singing Together Once the thunderbolts made their way into the Cold Prison, they would take another form.
<br><br>
That form would allow the bald giant to kill the Magical Thunder Slaves quite easily.
<br><br>
But they reacted surprisingly fast, moving quickly and nimbly like eels! "Crack!"
<br><br>
With the thunderous bangs, the Magical Thunder Slaves slithered through the gaps between the giant's hands and ran off in all directions.
<br><br>
The giant stretched and grabbed over and over, attempting to catch them again, but they kept escaping before he even knew it.
<br><br>
In less than thirty seconds, some of the Five-Element Slaves had died and some had successfully fled. Only Zen, Elizabeth and Libby were left beside the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
"Should we... leave too?"
<br><br>
Libby asked, her voice trembling.
<br><br>
She knew escape was an almost unreasonable hope; that pair of hands would not allow them to leave so easily. But even now, she still held a glimmer of hope in her heart...
<br><br>
When she looked at Zen, he was her rope hanging from above that she could climb to safety if things got too bad.
<br><br>
"No," Zen said firmly, shaking his head.
<br><br>
Elizabeth and Libby could not see it, but Zen saw clearly that the bald giant stared at him with a faint smile spreading across his face.
<br><br>
He fixed his gaze on him like a tiger stalking its prey, ready to pounce and feast on him.
<br><br>
From this distance, escape was impossible.
<br><br>
The only sliver of hope he had was the previous hint! He and the bald giant had a common enemy, and they both stood on the same side of this.
<br><br>
Fleeing now would only incite an attack from the bald giant.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The light dots in the Cold Prison grew restless once more. The bald giant lifted his hands and slapped at the three of them again.
<br><br>
"Ah!"
<br><br>
Libby's long hair blew from the force of the slap and she couldn't help but scream.
<br><br>
She had had a lot of training experience on the Other Shore, but she hadn't come face to face with any real serious difficulty or danger. She was thus left ill-prepared for the grave life and death situation they now found themselves in.
<br><br>
In contrast, Zen and Elizabeth were much calmer.
<br><br>
Elizabeth had become the leader of the Divine Lair after she had been through countless bloody battles and come out victorious. This was her strength. To this day, she regarded life and death as unimportant details and Zen shared this view after similar experiences.
<br><br>
He had always had an inkling that the bald giant was not stupid. If he still longed for freedom, they were his best shot at getting it! "Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The two enormous hands finally came to a halt two or three feet above the Divine Fire Shield, and then slowly withdrew towards the inside of the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Libby stopped screaming and seemed to gasp for breath.
<br><br>
Of course, her soul did not need to breathe. It was simply an expression of relief after all the nervousness that had overtaken her.
<br><br>
"Woo... Hoo..."
<br><br>
Soon, rhythmic sounds could be heard from the Cold Prison, as if many people were singing together.
<br><br>
"Help me decipher it," Zen said to the green figure.
<br><br>
After the green figure had moved from the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to the Civilization Artifact, it had been sitting there, paying close attention to Zen's every move. If Zen gave the order, it would activate the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization immediately.
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization quickly began deciphering the content and transmitted it directly to Zen's mind. "He is asking if you are enemies of the Element Spirit race," said the green figure.
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows slightly. This question proved that his strategy had worked.
<br><br>
Zen had wanted the bald giant to understand that he was on his side.
<br><br>
The new issue was how to answer the giant's question.
<br><br>
As a creature from the chaos, even if he knew how to express himself, he still couldn't actually make the correct sounds. The bald giant even could not understand the similar sounds. He had tried this before and failed...
<br><br>
"Dong, dong!"
<br><br>
Zen hesitated in his response and the giant uncurled a finger from the depths of the Cold Prison and hit the surface of the ice.
<br><br>
A rhythmic sound was heard again, exactly the same as before.
<br><br>
"Zen, he's asking us a question, right?" Elizabeth asked, noticing the giant in the Cold Prison was getting a little impatient.
<br><br>
"Yes, he asked if we're enemies of the Element Spirit race," Zen replied.
<br><br>
"But how do we answer him?" Elizabeth asked helplessly.
<br><br>
"I'm trying to figure that out," said Zen.
<br><br>
Libby, who had been extremely nervous, suddenly blurted out, "The souls in the Soul City are not creatures from outside the chaos, but they are capable of making the sounds of reading Sanskrit words!"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes suddenly lit up at this revelation. "Yes! Many souls make sounds at the same time that mix together..."
<br><br>
The pronunciation of the Sanskrit words was not made of a single syllable.
<br><br>
When the bald giant spoke, it was as if dozens of people spoke and sang at the same time.
<br><br>
Although the green figure had taught Zen the proper pronunciation, he would be unable to create such a complex sound alone. If there were dozens of people making sounds together, it could be possible.
<br><br>
Zen speedily conveyed this idea to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was thinking this himself. Being very intelligent, he reacted immediately at Zen's suggestion.
<br><br>
If there were enough people together to make the correct sounds and combine them together, they could create the same effect as the bald giant! The Primeval Lord of Heaven quickly gathered the elites of the human race in the Civilization Artifact. At the same time, he let the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization disassemble the pronunciation of the Sanskrit words. Every piece of pronunciation that contained multiple sounds was disassembled into single syllables, and each elite of the human race was responsible for uttering one single syllable.
<br><br>
"Dong, dong, dong!"
<br><br>
The bald giant hit the ice surface with his thick finger again, splashing the debris of ice in all directions.
<br><br>
He was growing increasingly impatient. He asked the question a third time, and the smile on his face had disappeared entirely.
<br><br>
Libby and Elizabeth looked at Zen simultaneously, hoping he would come up with a solution...
<br><br>
Just then, more than thirty heads suddenly appeared above Zen's head. The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Houyi and the others uttered words as if they sang together. "Yes, the Element Spirit race is my enemy!"
<br><br>
The bald giant obviously hadn't expected Zen to answer in this way. After a moment of amazement, a smile returned to his face. "Is the Element Spirit race the ruler of this world?" he asked.
<br><br>
Using the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, the green figure deciphered the sentence and conveyed its meaning to Zen.
<br><br>
"The ruler of this world? No. They are nothing but cowards in this world,"
<br><br>
Zen replied.
<br><br>
In Zen's eyes, the Element Spirit Civilization's pursuit of the Purge Way was a helpless compromise to make the world peaceful. If one wanted to truly solve the crisis of chaos, they would have to rely on the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Therefore, the pursuit of the Purge Way was a coward's venture.
<br><br>
After Zen finished speaking, the green figure once again translated the words into complex syllables, and then disassembled them for the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others to sing together and make the composite sound.
<br><br>
Communicating in this way was very inconvenient, but at least it could help Zen communicate with the giant.
<br><br>
However, Fuxi, Houyi and the others rolled their eyes as they sang this strange song. This task had clearly left them in a bad mood and they felt helpless in having to do it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3756 The Magical Slipknot After the bald giant heard the human heroes sing, he couldn't help but respond, "You are right! They are indeed a group of cowards. They set up a contemptible trap against me, and that was how they caught me!"
<br><br>
Once he finished, he gritted his teeth in pure anger.
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit race are quite cunning and despicable," Zen pointed out.
<br><br>
As the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization translated for him, the human heroes conveyed his words using song.
<br><br>
"Exactly! What a group of deceitful bastards!" The bald giant agreed as he nodded.
<br><br>
"Such a hateful race just brought shame to all of the civilizations in the chaos!" Zen continued to curse in disgust.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the human heroes furrowed their eyebrows in confusion while Zen cursed the Element Spirit Civilization so passionately.
<br><br>
Just then, the Snake Goddess broke the tension. "Zen, what's the point of cursing the Element Spirit Civilization this way?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven also looked up at Zen, revealing a look of doubt.
<br><br>
They encouraged Zen to inquire about the bald man's background before making any impulsive actions. It would have been helpful if they knew if he was a member of the Instant Civilization, or if he had any knowledge on what civilizations existed in the Abstruse Energy World, etc.
<br><br>
However, instead of doing so, Zen cursed profusely at the Element Spirit Civilization, which surprised the rest of them.
<br><br>
For them, it seemed like a meaningless bicker especially because they all cultivated to such a high level.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Zen winked at them. "I think we'd better go along with the giant first."
<br><br>
Based on what the giant had done, Zen figured that he was an impulsive and wilful man.
<br><br>
Though the giant spared their lives, there was no guarantee he wouldn't return if Zen irritated him some more.
<br><br>
This was the reason Zen echoed the giant's curses on the Element Spirit Civilization. He wanted to gain his approval.
<br><br>
On the other hand, this was an ordeal to the human heroes, though. While he was cursing, the heroes conveyed the translations with songs that they would not be able to understand.
<br><br>
This process took a long while, and eventually gave time for the bald giant to cool off most of his anger. His violent aura had dissipated a lot over this time.
<br><br>
He looked at Zen with what seemed like a look of friendliness. "You look similar to me, my friend," the giant said. "Are you also a member of the Colossus race? But why are you so small in size?"
<br><br>
The Colossus race? What was that? The Primeval Lord of Heaven, Zen and the others repeated the phrase to themselves as they tried to see if it would ring a bell.
<br><br>
This gave them insight that the bald giant was not alone. He had a race.
<br><br>
"I can change my body size. Look!"
<br><br>
Just then, Zen secretly activated the Wild God Power which sent his body to grow up to twenty feet high.
<br><br>
He made sure to be cautious, especially because of the restriction of the Divine Fire Shield. There was no way Zen would send himself to the ordinary size of a Wild God.
<br><br>
The giant's eyes widened at the sight of this. "You can even shift your body size like a member of Colossus race! The angrier we are, the larger we can grow." The giant seemed excited to know Zen was an ally. "Are we exactly from the same race? Are there any others of our kind in this world?"
<br><br>
Zen knew well that he did not belong to the Colossus race.
<br><br>
However, he noticed the similarity in his appearance with the giant, which made him wonder if the human race did have any connection to the socalled Colossus race.
<br><br>
But in order to be on his good side, Zen had to play smart. Hence, Zen didn't deny him, and instead, gave a vague answer and a shrug. "Well, it's possible."
<br><br>
But just as the bald giant was about to jump for joy, Zen changed the subject. "As far as I know, the creatures in the Cold Prisons have been imprisoned for a very long time. Some have exceeded eras! My friend, do you plan to be imprisoned for a long time here as well?"
<br><br>
Hearing this, the bald giant's face shifted from excitement to infuriation. His nostrils bulged as he took heavy breaths. "They can't imprison me. If they do, they will pay for it!"
<br><br>
As he spoke his last word, the bald giant pulled out a huge iron stake from his belt.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race tied up the bald giant to this iron stake at the center of the Cold Prison. However, under his relentless struggle, he managed to pull the stake up from the ground, and that was why he could move within the range of the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Still, he was chained, which prevented him from breaking free completely.
<br><br>
However, the bald giant believed that the three chains proved no threat to him.
<br><br>
"But now that this event has happened, it won't be long before the Element Spirit race sends reinforcements to tie you up again. If it comes to that, you won't have another chance to escape!"
<br><br>
The bald giant wanted nothing more than freedom from the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
As Zen said this, the bald giant shook his head as he realized the gravity of his situation.
<br><br>
Even though he killed and repelled the Five-Element Slaves, he could not underestimate the strength of the Element Spirit race again. There was no way he wanted to stay imprisoned.
<br><br>
"I have to get out of this damned place now!"
<br><br>
The bald giant screamed, impatient and bitter. He shook and flailed around in attempt to tear the iron chain around his hands.
<br><br>
What Zen did not know was the material used for the iron chains. Though the giant possessed immense strength, the chains were undamaged.
<br><br>
Bang! Just then, the bald giant smashed the iron chain onto the ground. He slouched and heaved for a breath, helpless and panting. "I... I can't destroy it!"
<br><br>
"Can you try and throw the chain out of the Cold Prison so I can take a look?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
He summoned the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others to take a look at the chains.
<br><br>
Zen was determined to free the giant, so that he could use the giant's power to defeat the Five-Element Slaves in Stage Thirty.
<br><br>
"Can you break this chain for me?"
<br><br>
The bald giant pleaded. He stretched out his hands, showing it to Zen.
<br><br>
Seeing it up close, the iron chain was as wide as a human being. It was bronze, while the rings were fastened tightly.
<br><br>
The soul of the Primeval Lord of Heaven floated up to get a closer look at the chain. With a light tap of his finger, lines of densely arranged runes suddenly appeared on the chain's surface.
<br><br>
Theses runes connected to one another, resembling a chain.
<br><br>
Pleased, the Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled at such change. "Just as I suspected. It's a Magical Slipknot! Once an iron chain is painted with this kind of runes, a Magical Slipknot Array would form on the joints between every two rings. If one attempts to escape it, the chain would only tighten."
<br><br>
"Do you know how we can break the array?" Zen asked impatiently.
<br><br>
"Please." The Primeval Lord of Heaven brushed off his shoulder. "This is a piece of cake."
<br><br>
It was true that the Magical Slipknot Array was not too difficult to deal with. The Element Spirit race never would have guessed that someone would have helped the giant solve it.
<br><br>
After Zen told the bald giant that they could free him, his face lit up with pure excitement. In turn, he followed all their orders without another word.
<br><br>
He obediently bent down, spread out hands, and placed them right before the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Extending his hands, the Primeval Lord of Heaven stroked one ring of the chain. Within seconds, a faint green light flashed from his palms.
<br><br>
This light began to flow like a thick liquid as it made its way towards the Magical Slipknot Array.
<br><br>
As the green light made contact with the Magical Slipknot Array, the array's originally golden light died down.
<br><br>
Just then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven retreated backward and merely nodded at the giant.
<br><br>
With one stretch of his arms, the chain broke apart.
<br><br>
Buzz! It was in this moment that Libby's and Elizabeth's visions saw the numerous light spots in the Cold Prison dance.
<br><br>
Zen watched the bald giant intentionally. He noticed the giant did not expect it to be so easy, and his eyes widened at the knowledge that he was finally free.
<br><br>
Chapter 3757 Uproar Once the Primeval Lord of Heaven unbolted the remaining two chains, the bald giant got to his feet and stepped out of the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
The smooth ice field shone light on him, emitting a primitive, powerful aura.
<br><br>
The bald giant squatted down and spread his hand towards Zen and said, "My friend, it's time to settle accounts with those bastards!"
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization deciphered his words, causing Zen to smile.
<br><br>
He then walked into the palm of the bald giant with Elizabeth and Libby.
<br><br>
The ice shook as the bald giant walked on the upper ice field.
<br><br>
The temperature here was low, but not as low as in the Cold Prison.
<br><br>
The moment the frost condensed on the surface of the bald giant's body, it sizzled, turned into hot air, and disappeared.
<br><br>
The giant's skin turned bright red, steaming heat gushing out of his body and resisting the low temperature of the ice field pretty easily.
<br><br>
"This place is covered with ice! Where is the Element Spirit Civilization?"
<br><br>
the bald giant asked after they had traversed some distance.
<br><br>
Zen was not familiar with the Blooming Jade Stage either. But he had already walked through it once before and knew that as long as he walked in this direction to the very end, he could advance to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen was about to direct the giant in the right way when Elizabeth suddenly said, "Now that this bald giant wants to take revenge on the Element Spirit race, why don't we let him enjoy himself?"
<br><br>
"Enjoy himself?" Zen's eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
"Since the Element Spirit race controls the Blooming Jade Stage, it would be inconvenient for any other race to go up or down. Zen, your body has passed the Blooming Jade Stage, but your soul is still in Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore. If you want to go to Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, I'm afraid it will become troublesome by then. It also won't be easy for your people from the Oneness Sky Palace to pass through the Blooming Jade Stage," Elizabeth reminded him.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes lit up at this and he asked to clarify, "What do you mean?"
<br><br>
"Overturn Stage Thirty of the Other Shore," Elizabeth answered with a shrug.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had Stage Thirty of the Other Shore under full control. As a result, other races, civilizations, or powerful individual creatures on the Other Shore had no choice but to bear with the Element Spirit race when they passed through the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
If the base camp of the Element Spirit race in Stage Thirty of the Other Shore could be destroyed, other forces on the Other Shore, like the Nihility race, and civilizations in support of the Finale Way, would probably take the chance to enter the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
This was a good opportunity to weaken the power of the Element Spirit race, and there was no reason for them to miss it.
<br><br>
"Please show him the way," Zen said, smiling.
<br><br>
Elizabeth shrugged again. She had been traveling in the Blooming Jade Stage for a long time and was familiar with the distribution of the ice castles belonging to the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Many octagonal ice castles stood at the center of the lower ice field in the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
These ice castles weren't very large, but were connected to each other, forming a permanent ice city. The Element Spirit race had even built a thick ice wall on the outer side of the ice city.
<br><br>
Different types of Other Shore creatures ventured in and out of the ice city.
<br><br>
Souls of Light, native Other Shore creatures, and former civilizations in the chaos were among them. All of them had one thing in common—every single race had been subject to the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The atmosphere in the ice city was subdued today. Both the Other Shore creatures and the Five-Element Slaves were unusually silent.
<br><br>
The troops formed by the Moon Fire Slaves, the Chill Ice Slaves, and the Magical Thunder Slaves had very recently suffered a great loss. Except for the Magical Thunder Slaves having staged a lucky escape, all the Moon Fire Slaves and the Chill Ice Slaves had been killed.
<br><br>
A round platform carved with ice crystals sat at the center of the ice city.
<br><br>
The center of this platform shimmered in a strange darkness.
<br><br>
The Dark Region was so dark that no one could clearly see what was going on inside.
<br><br>
But the creatures living in the ice city knew what it was covering.
<br><br>
Many Moon Fire Slaves, Burial Earth Slaves, and Chill Ice Slaves surrounded the round platform and knelt down towards the Dark Region.
<br><br>
They silently lowered their heads.
<br><br>
"You are a group of losers! There were just two Souls of Light and a corporeal body! How could they kill all my Moon Fire Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves?! I really underestimated that stupid giant!"
<br><br>
"..."
<br><br>
The voice roared from within the Dark Region for quite a while before a ball slowly floated out of it.
<br><br>
Blue ice crystals floated inside the ball.
<br><br>
These ice crystals circled within the ball a few times before forming a little ice man.
<br><br>
This man was Hosea, a water spirit of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
As the ruler of Stage Thirty of the Other Shore, he had been in charge of everything in the Blooming Jade Stage. He had dispatched troops to the upper ice field to encircle and annihilate Zen as soon as they had discovered his whereabouts.
<br><br>
He had thought that it would be very easy to capture Zen. But in the end, his troops returned in bitter defeat and with heavy casualties.
<br><br>
This was a result that Hosea could not accept, so he flew into a rage.
<br><br>
He leaped lightly and his small body emerged from the ball.
<br><br>
He looked short, but his real body was taller than a human.
<br><br>
He waved his hands lightly and two blades appeared beside his arms.
<br><br>
These blades were curved and glinted with cold light that none could explain.
<br><br>
Hosea was about to lead the Five-Element Slaves on their journey when he spotted a Soul of Light flying towards them in the close distance.
<br><br>
The Soul of Light was Neal, a powerful warrior of Holy Soul Realm from the Divine Farmer race. He hurried to report his findings to Hosea. "Master Hosea, Zen has come down. He is at the gate of the ice city!"
<br><br>
Hosea was stunned.
<br><br>
He had thought that Zen would find a place to escape from the Other Shore after surviving the chase of the Five-Element Slaves.
<br><br>
If that had really been the case, there would have been nothing that Hosea could do with Zen for the time being. He could only have pinned his hope on the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race in the Source World.
<br><br>
But to his great surprise, Zen hadn't escaped. He had, instead, come to him of his own accord. Hosea was overjoyed as he muttered, "I'd like to see what tricks he wants to play!"
<br><br>
Saying thus, he floated away towards the city gate.
<br><br>
All the Five-Element Slaves followed closely behind.
<br><br>
Five minutes before this, pieces of solid ice had suddenly fallen from above the ice city.
<br><br>
The guards of the ice city were confused. The ice was solid and looked unlikely to fall unless external force was applied to it.
<br><br>
The guards were still pondering over this when a figure came smashing through the upper ice field from the cave and into the gate of the ice city.
<br><br>
"Who are you?"
<br><br>
"Tell us your name!"
<br><br>
"..."
<br><br>
These guards were from Other Shore races that were dependent on the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The strengths of the Other Shore races varied greatly which was proven by the fact that these guards were far weaker than the Five-Element Slaves.
<br><br>
However, these Other Shore races flourished under the protection of the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Since Zen wasn't answering their questions, several guards thrust their spears towards his head.
<br><br>
Zen's body flashed as he passed through the guards.
<br><br>
The guards felt their eyes blur, and their hands become empty, the long spears that they had been holding appearing in Zen's hands.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Zen threw the spears towards the ice wall, each of them stabbing into it with a terrifying force.
<br><br>
Zen jumped up to stand on top of the ice wall with the help of the spears.
<br><br>
He looked into the distance and smiled as he said, "We should make it bigger."
<br><br>
Chapter 3758 The Holy Soul's Strength Back in Stage Four of the Other Shore, Zen destroyed the Bearing race's temple all on his own.
<br><br>
That time though, his physical body held a bit of an edge against everyone since his enemies were all Souls of Light that had limited strength to fight back.
<br><br>
However, this was Stage Thirty of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Even the Other Shore creatures here held considerable power.
<br><br>
Moreover, after upgrading to Holy Souls, these Souls of Light considerably increased their strength to the point that they could now contend with a physical body.
<br><br>
Zen's form on top of the ice wall immediately attracted a lot of attention.
<br><br>
Nobody ever dared to act like this in the ice city! Zen was asking for trouble.
<br><br>
"Where did this reckless human brat come from?"
<br><br>
Not far away was a platform where numerous burly creatures, covered in silver scales and with huge heads of golden hair, stood.
<br><br>
They were members of the Scale Lion race which used to be the ruling civilization during the 337th chaos.
<br><br>
This race had a good relationship with the Element Spirit Civilization and paid direct allegiance with them after entering the Other Shore. They were extremely loyal among all of the Other Shore civilizations.
<br><br>
Their hostility towards Zen was natural after the man made his invasion known.
<br><br>
"Howl!"
<br><br>
Accompanied by a burst of primitive roars, the members of the Scale Lion race suddenly jumped together and began to scale the ice wall, headed straight towards Zen! One thing about the Scale Lion race was that they did not rely on their theurgy to fight and instead cultivated a special fighting instinct that helped them deal fatal blows upon their opponents. They were mean fighting machines who knew how to strike and defend effectively.
<br><br>
If an opponent was on par to their strength, then the Scale Lion race would be invincible. However, if the opponent was stronger, the increase of the Scale Lion race's strength would be limited.
<br><br>
Zen's physical body was already at maximum power courtesy of the Bodystrengthening Jades, and add to that the support of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
There was no need to take these approaching creatures seriously given his current strength. The only ones he had to watch out for were the FiveElement Slaves.
<br><br>
The moment the first Scale Lion reached him, Zen bent forward and threw a wicked punch towards his opponent's abdomen.
<br><br>
Scale Lions, as their name suggested, were covered with extremely hard scales save for their bellies. Zen's strike was incredibly powerful and was enough to break all his internal bones.
<br><br>
One punch was all it took to eliminate the first opponent but the second one was already stretching out his sharp claws towards Zen's head! Zen was faster and he was able to strike first. Afterward, he clasped the sharp claws headed for him and spun violently.
<br><br>
He used the Scale Lion as a weapon against his companions! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang...
<br><br>
Several Scale Lions failed to dodge and were directly smashed onto the ice wall. Zen grabbed a few of them and threw them up to a height of hundreds of feet into the air before they fell down and crashed onto a nearby building.
<br><br>
Zen found himself looking into the distance. "The noise is nowhere near loud enough to attract attention," he mumbled to himself. He was here to mess things up, which meant the louder he was, the better.
<br><br>
Just as he thought up of ways to make a bigger commotion, he heard a voice speak to him. "You are incredibly fearless, but it is time to stop..."
<br><br>
The voice shocked Zen greatly.
<br><br>
He quickly whipped around to see a figure dash behind him. It was a human Soul of Light that held a huge ink brush. With unbelievable dexterity, he drew the brush and flicked a stroke towards Zen.
<br><br>
Zen noticed that something was wrong, so he wanted to keep his distance from this person.
<br><br>
This person was only a Soul of Light but his bodily movement was incredibly mysterious and amazing. He was like a maggot that kept following Zen's moves.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish...
<br><br>
The second stroke of his brush landed directly on Zen's chest! The third stroke...
<br><br>
The fourth stroke...
<br><br>
The fifth stroke...
<br><br>
During this barrage of attacks, Zen exhausted all means to dodge, counterattack, and even soar into the air. Unfortunately for him, the Soul of Light continued his pursuit and left behind many strokes on his body.
<br><br>
"The stroke is incomparable, making the mountains and stars move. Seal!"
<br><br>
the Soul of Light uttered, after suddenly drawing seven strokes on Zen's body.
<br><br>
It felt as if these brushstrokes came to life like snakes that coiled around Zen's entire body and tightly wrapped around him.
<br><br>
He felt his power within him sealed as he smashed onto the ice wall.
<br><br>
With Zen effectively restrained, the Soul of Light slowly approached with his ink brush propped on his shoulder.
<br><br>
Although Zen couldn't see his face clearly, he could see that the Soul of Light resembled an old man with a stooping body.
<br><br>
This old man's name was Reed and he came from the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
He was a high-ranking warrior at the Holy Soul Realm, and had been active in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore for a long time now.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha, you're a daring one, aren't you? You successfully blocked the Sun Crow race's invasion and now even dared to enter the Blooming Hade Stage!" Reed said with a faint smile.
<br><br>
As he spoke, Zen couldn't help but shift his eyes to the large brush the old man carried.
<br><br>
This ink brush was a unique magic treasure called the Dragon Sealing Brush.
<br><br>
With Reed's soul theurgy, it had the ability to seal everything, even the powerful warriors on the Other Shore! There was no way Zen would be able to attack, now that he was sealed. He could only lie on the ground and stare at the old man with indifference.
<br><br>
He didn't expect for an old man who had reached the Holy Soul Realm to be his match.
<br><br>
"Since you had the guts to break into the ice city, you're as good as dead.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race will be very happy if I hand you over to them,"
<br><br>
Reed continued, stretching out a hand to lift Zen up.
<br><br>
However, the moment Zen got to his feet, the strokes that restrained him suddenly broke free.
<br><br>
Reed's eyes widened in horror as he immediately let go of Zen and took a few steps back.
<br><br>
"How is that possible!"
<br><br>
Bang! There was no time to ponder over that, as Zen instantly threw him a punch square on the face.
<br><br>
Though it had been a long time since he reached the Holy Soul Realm and the stability of his soul was comparable to that of a physical body, Reed still suffered greatly from the man's attack.
<br><br>
As his soul was smashed into the air, he found it best to retreat from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Puff! Somewhere in the Source World was a palace and in this palace sat the old man, Reed. The moment he opened his eyes, he spat out a mouthful of blood and suddenly fainted! He did not know that in the eyes of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, his unique sealing theurgy was a mere party trick.
<br><br>
When he sealed Zen, the Primeval Lord of Heaven made quick work of negating the magic and reminded the man to launch a surprise attack once Reed approached.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "This Holy Soul really is so strong. This is indeed unexpected."
<br><br>
He thought his punch would've been enough to smash Reed's Holy Soul to ashes, but the strength of the old man's soul exceeded his expectations.
<br><br>
Chapter 3759 Falling From The Sky Another human warrior at the Holy Soul Realm stood in an ice pavilion. It was Neal of the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
Neal was the equal of Reed in terms of strength. When Neal saw Reed being forced out of the Other Shore by Zen's punch, he was astonished, though he tried to conceal it.
<br><br>
Obviously, Reed had wanted to capture Zen so that he could ask for rewards from the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race was known for the generosity of its rewards, which its members used as a means of controlling others and obtaining what they wanted.
<br><br>
However, not only had Reed been unable to catch Zen, he had also sustained serious injuries. Reed's failure convinced Neal that it would not be a good idea to go forward.
<br><br>
He quietly retreated. His human-shaped Soul of Light disintegrated into a series of slender threads, which shivered in the air like visible wind spreading into the depths of the ice city.
<br><br>
It would also be a great achievement to be the one to bring the news to the stage ruler, Hosea.
<br><br>
"That human brat defeated the Scale Lion race? And he threw a Holy Soul out of the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"I know who he is! He is the one whom Master Hosea is hunting down.
<br><br>
Many of the Five-Element Slaves have been killed while hunting him!"
<br><br>
"He is too arrogant! How dare he come to the ice city? You must catch him!"
<br><br>
The news of Zen's feats spread to the strange-shaped creatures of the Other Shore, and it caught their attention immediately. They were intrigued and wanted to know more about Zen.
<br><br>
They took an interest in Zen for the same reason as Reed. Since Zen was wanted by the Element Spirit race, his capture would lead to enormous rewards.
<br><br>
"Come on, let's go!"
<br><br>
Several short-statured creatures, shaped like giant beetles, were gathered by the side of the city gate. In a moment, they spread their wings and rose into the air, gliding along the ice wall and heading straight towards Zen.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! As soon as they drew nearer to Zen, to their shock, the shadow of a fist had approached and smashed them down along the ice wall.
<br><br>
But as soon as the giant beetles had been smashed down, dozens of birds appeared in the air, flying towards Zen. These birds were small, no larger than a human fist, but they had long beaks, at least three feet in length.
<br><br>
They also flew much faster than the beetles. They zoomed like living arrows towards Zen. No ordinary creature could block such an attack by these deadly birds.
<br><br>
However, Zen was in possession of the Chaotic Source Spirits, which made his body an impenetrable fortress. If the birds tried to pierce him with their beaks, he knew that the consequences would be terrible for them—his body was like rigid stone.
<br><br>
Indeed, as soon as the birds reached Zen, their sharp, slender beaks broke upon contact with his body. Their tiny warm bodies slammed into him next, and were pulverized by the impact into a mist of blood and feathers. For the birds, it had been a suicide attack.
<br><br>
Even as the flock of birds died, two more monsters showed up. They were large, stooping figures carrying pots of poison. They climbed the ice wall and positioned themselves above Zen, sprinkling their multicolored liquid venom over his body. But Zen was immune to all poisons. He shook off the venom and leapt up to kick the monsters from their perch on the wall.
<br><br>
Still, no matter how easily Zen fended off the attacks, more and more Other Shore creatures showed up. Many were eager to claim the reward promised by the Element Spirit race, and soon Zen was surrounded. He was preparing to fight all of them when a chill swept through the air. A cold wind was blowing in, and the temperature suddenly dropped severely.
<br><br>
Zen and the Other Shore creatures turned to look in the direction of the wind. In the distance, a large blue shadow was moving towards them. As it progressed, it seemed to infect everything it passed. The snow-white buildings of the ice city turned a dark blue, and the temperature became even colder.
<br><br>
The blue shadow was followed by many Moon Fire, Magical Thunder, and Chill Ice Slaves.
<br><br>
"It's Master Hosea!" cried someone.
<br><br>
"Master Hosea is here in person. This arrogant human brat has met his match now!"
<br><br>
"He has to pay the price for his wild actions! Death!"
<br><br>
Zen listened to the words of those creatures below the ice wall, his gaze fixed firmly on the looming blue shadow. He said softly, "It seems that the master has arrived. How powerful is Hosea?"
<br><br>
"Hosea is a figure of significance within the Element Spirit Civilization,"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied. "But the truly powerful existences of the Element Spirit Civilization are all in Stage Thirty-three."
<br><br>
The most important stage on the Other Shore was Stage Thirty-three. In the eyes of the Element Spirit Civilization, Stage Thirty-three was the land of exploration—all the lower stages were merely distractions, areas that needed to be managed and maintained.
<br><br>
As Hosea approached, the temperature continued to drop, until everyone felt the bite of the cold. On the ice wall, the growing frost formed beautiful polygonal condensation patterns, like ice flowers.
<br><br>
Most of the Other Shore creatures began backing away from Zen. They grew quiet and watched Hosea coming nearer and nearer.
<br><br>
In a few moments, Hosea reached the opposite side of the ice wall, floating in midair. His sharp eyes fixated immediately on Zen, but there was a look of puzzlement in his expression.
<br><br>
"I'm curious," said Hosea calmly. "You managed by luck to defeat the FiveElement Slaves, but you must have known retribution would follow. You should have hidden yourself in the Source World. What gives you the courage to break into my ice city?"
<br><br>
As a member of the Element Spirit Civilization, Hosea had passed the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation. He had also entered the Eternal Scroll Painting. As a master at the Eternal Realm, Hosea possessed an immensely powerful aura. It was like thousands of sharp knives hidden within his body, and he could exert enormous pressure on those within his range.
<br><br>
Zen met Hosea's fierce gaze without any fear. When Hosea had spoken, Zen smiled faintly and answered, "Courage is not a problem for me. I have never been afraid to go after what I want."
<br><br>
"That's not courage, that's stupidity," Hosea said in a cool tone. He raised his hands, and the blades on both sides of his arms flickered with an icy light.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures and the Five-Element Slaves formed a wide circle around Hosea and Zen, watching in wide-eyed silence.
<br><br>
The sight of Hosea engaged in battle was something rare and unexpected.
<br><br>
"It has been tens of thousands of years since the last time Master Hosea fought, right?"
<br><br>
"We might never have the chance to see anything like this again!"
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, Hosea's opponent is too weak for him," someone observed in a disappointed voice.
<br><br>
Hosea was a stage ruler at the Eternal Realm, an existence of incomparable power. Most of the watchers felt that Hosea's talent would be wasted on killing someone like Zen who was so much weaker. In fact, some thought privately that Hosea should just leave Zen to them, as he was not worth Hosea's personal attention.
<br><br>
"Too weak?" Zen repeated. He chuckled and said, "Well, why don't we see what strength I can summon?"
<br><br>
Zen was clearly unafraid, and his words caused murmurs and looks of confusion in everyone around him, even Hosea. At that moment, there was a loud crackling sound in the air above them.
<br><br>
Cracks were forming on the thick frost covering the upper ice field. In seconds, it splintered into shards that fell in heavy, razor-sharp shards onto the ground.
<br><br>
They heard a deep boom.
<br><br>
The huge ice piece shrouded an ice castle, which was also smashed into pieces. Some of the ice splinters landed on Other Shore creatures, killing them before they could react.
<br><br>
To everyone's shock, as the ice piece fell, a huge, hulking figure jumped down to stand beside Zen. There was a thud as his weight landed solidly on the ground. It was a bald giant.
<br><br>
The thick ice wall couldn't bear the force of his landing, and collapsed.
<br><br>
Many Other Shore creatures stared at the strange giant in open-mouthed disbelief.
<br><br>
A giant descending from the upper ice field? How had such a creature survived in a land of extreme chillness without the protection of the Divine Fire Shield? Just what kind of existence was this giant? To their further astonishment, the giant moved his lips and began emitting strange words.
<br><br>
It seemed that the bald giant was singing without any recognizable tone or rhythm.
<br><br>
Zen listened attentively. The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization had sent out the contents it had deciphered. Zen gazed at Hosea and said evenly, "This guy of the Colossus race told you that he'd met you again!"
<br><br>
Hosea's eyes widened in recognition and shock. He was astonished that the bald giant had escaped from the Cold Prison. Yet he was even more stunned that Zen was capable of understanding what the bald giant said.
<br><br>
Chapter 3760 Fight The Element Spirit Civilization had naturally thought of many ways to communicate with the creatures outside the chaos.
<br><br>
Like most other civilizations, they wanted to gain rich experience so they could decipher Sanskrit words, the light dots, and even their voices.
<br><br>
Sanskrit words were the text; the light dots were the form; and the voices were the verbal expression.
<br><br>
Among the three of them, the words were the easiest to decipher. Every ruling civilization that had passed through the chaos had done profound studies on the Sanskrit words, and the Element Spirit Civilization was no exception.
<br><br>
However, it was extremely difficult to decipher the form and the verbal expression. For instance, the creatures in the chaos weren't capable of entering the Abstruse Energy World, which was their innate limitation.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, it was possible to break such a limitation.
<br><br>
For example, Ziya gradually adapted to the rules of the Abstruse Energy World after countless years of exploration.
<br><br>
The only thing was, that way of adapting was quite inefficient, and that was why Ziya still couldn't exit a mountain even after so many years.
<br><br>
Then again, his explorations were only one individual's efforts. As the oldest civilization, the Element Spirit Civilization had many talents in the Element Spirit race, who when they explored together, could surely find out more about the Abstruse Energy World than he did.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the Element Spirit Civilization even knew how to fight and set traps.
<br><br>
Over the years, they had captured a considerable number of creatures in the Abstruse Energy World just to understand how the civilizations there worked.
<br><br>
All the creatures they had captured from the Abstruse Energy World were brought to the Other Shore and detained in the Cold Prisons.
<br><br>
They built the Cold Prisons in such a way that their temperature was always at an immensely low level. Not only were the Cold Prisons very suitable for holding creatures from outside the chaos, but they also helped the Element Spirit race study them.
<br><br>
Aside from that, they also made a series of detailed plans to capture those creatures, but they never got to carry out those plans smoothly.
<br><br>
Many people from the Element Spirit Civilization died in the Abstruse Energy World during their first attempts.
<br><br>
That was because the Element Spirit Civilization was not good at fighting in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
After some careful consideration, they changed the strategies of their plans.
<br><br>
They might not be able to defeat those creatures in the Abstruse Energy World, but they believed that they could defeat them on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
If they set up a bait, they could gradually lure the creatures from the Abstruse Energy World to the Other Shore. The moment those creatures arrived at the Other Shore, the people of the Element Spirit Civilization would surround and capture them.
<br><br>
Although it was a despicable method, it was quite useful.
<br><br>
They eventually carried out the plan and as a result, the number of creatures in the Cold Prisons began to increase rapidly.
<br><br>
But even after the Element Spirit Civilization studied them for a long time, they still weren't satisfied.
<br><br>
The reason was that the trap that the Element Spirit Civilization had set up was rather simple. It consisted of just putting food as bait in the Abstruse Energy World and luring those creatures with it.
<br><br>
Then, almost all the creatures in the Abstruse Energy World who were fooled by the food bait were low-level.
<br><br>
Those creatures did not possess intelligence. Aside from their fighting instinct and strange howls, they were useless. It was even more impossible to learn about any civilization in the Abstruse Energy World by studying them.
<br><br>
Despite that, the Element Spirit race couldn't find a better way. In the end, there was nothing they could do except setting up the traps in a more sophisticated way.
<br><br>
Finally, one day, a bait had attracted a member of the Colossus race, and that creature accidentally fell into the Element Spirit Civilization's trap.
<br><br>
It turned out to be the bald giant, and the whole Element Spirit Civilization was in an uproar at the capture.
<br><br>
Even though the Element Spirit Civilization pursued a very conservative way, which was the Purge Way, they were always eager to know more about the world outside the chaos. They wanted to use the Purge Way to delay the end of the chaos as much as possible and at the same time, they wanted to explore the Abstruse Energy World to find another method of ending.
<br><br>
After a long time, they finally caught an intelligent member of the Colossus race. How could they not be excited? Their excitement faded when even after two years of imprisonment, the Element Spirit Civilization didn't get anything out of the bald giant. They hadn't even understood his language.
<br><br>
Still, the bald giant hadn't been in prison for a long time yet, so most of the Element Spirit race was still optimistic.
<br><br>
They believed that they would get the information they needed sooner or later, as long as the bald giant was in prison.
<br><br>
Yet, they never imagined that Zen would release the bald giant purely out of a series of coincidences! "You... You can talk to this bald giant?" Hosea asked Zen in disbelief.
<br><br>
Zen only shrugged and didn't say yes or no.
<br><br>
"Tell me!" Horsea shouted.
<br><br>
At that moment, his whole body turned into an azure flying shuttle and charged straight towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Before he could reach the ice wall, a huge fist fell from the sky.
<br><br>
"Pop!"
<br><br>
The bald giant smashed Hosea to the ground with a loud crunch.
<br><br>
As soon as the fist touched the ground, a visible shock wave formed around it. The shock wave swept over the ice walls, ice castles, and ice crystal buildings, and all of them were crushed into bits.
<br><br>
More than half of the ice city was destroyed like that! "My ruler!"
<br><br>
"The fist of the bald giant is truly powerful..."
<br><br>
"I wonder if Master Hosea is all right..."
<br><br>
All the Other Shore creatures and Five-Element Slaves who witnessed the scene became worried and panicked.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, all of them sighed in relief.
<br><br>
Wisps of white frost spiraled up along the bald giant's fist. As the white frost condensed, it turned into a thick layer of ice and wrapped around the giant fist.
<br><br>
Hosea's face was on the bald giant's arm, but the face was looking at Zen.
<br><br>
"Ha, did you think you would win by releasing this guy?"
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The cold air quickly spread to the bald giant's torso, legs, neck, head.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the ice had frozen the bald giant on the spot and rendered him motionless.
<br><br>
Hosea slipped out of the bald giant's arm and stared coldly at Zen. "Tell me, how did you communicate with him?" he sneered.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen was a little shocked at the sudden turn of events.
<br><br>
If the bald giant really didn't have any other ability, he probably shouldn't have broken into the ice city.
<br><br>
When Hosea saw that Zen didn't say anything, he jumped up once again. He stretched both of his hands, which held two curved wing-like blades, then flew towards Zen.
<br><br>
The moment he jumped, a shattering sound came from behind him. The giant hand once again grabbed him.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
A cracking sound came from the bald giant's palm. Hosea's body was crushed into pieces.
<br><br>
However, Zen's face didn't relax when he heard the sound.
<br><br>
It was because he knew that the Element Spirit race evolved from various elements, so it wasn't easy to kill them.
<br><br>
For instance, the Chill Ice Slaves and the Moon Fire Slaves had spiritual cores. If their spiritual cores were damaged, they would die. On the other hand, the Magical Thunder Slaves had no spiritual cores, and the bald giant couldn't seem to kill them.
<br><br>
Since Hosea was a water spirit among the spirits with five elements, it was impossible to kill him with just violence.
<br><br>
In the next moment, Zen's prediction became true.
<br><br>
Wisps of white frost spread out from the bald giant's palm once again, turned into thick ice, and tightly wrapped around his body.
<br><br>
Chapter 3761 The Earth Wood Seal The solidified ice was more stable than the last one, and on it were blue patterns.
<br><br>
Hosea came out of the ice and didn't stop at all.
<br><br>
In a split-second, he flew up high into the sky, and part of his limbs turned into an ice spear that was over ten thousand feet long! Suddenly, Hosea spun his body around and the ice spear shot to the bald giant! Crack! Although the ice spear was truly powerful, it failed to pierce through the bald giant's body.
<br><br>
Hosea frowned when he realized that he couldn't injure the bald giant with his own strength. Thus, he floated up again and condensed a second ice spear.
<br><br>
Crack! This time, the icy blue spear pierced through the bald giant's armpit.
<br><br>
Then, Hosea condensed more ice spears immediately after.
<br><br>
Dozens of ice spears shuttled down from all directions and repeatedly punctured the bald giant until he was firmly fastened on the ground.
<br><br>
Hosea then stopped when he felt that the bald giant was finally subdued.
<br><br>
After he took a look at his work, his lips curved into a satisfied smile. Then, he slowly floated towards Zen.
<br><br>
There was a big hole in the upper ice field, which would take some time to repair itself.
<br><br>
A cold wind blew across the whole ice city, which made the whole place's temperature drop sharply.
<br><br>
At the same time, Libby and Elizabeth also felt their hearts drop.
<br><br>
For their safety, the two women didn't go down to the lower ice field with Zen and the bald giant. Besides, Elizabeth had previously spent a lot of effort melting the ice for the bald giant to go down.
<br><br>
The Divine Fire Shield covered the two women as they observed the situation from the upper ice field.
<br><br>
"Eh, the bald giant is lame..." Libby said. "You shouldn't have let Zen make such a dangerous move!" She glared at Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Elizabeth stayed silent for a moment before she said, "I did overestimate his strength..."
<br><br>
Indeed, the bald giant was powerful when it came to strength and defense.
<br><br>
Even the ice spears Hosea had thrown with all his might failed to cause even the slightest damage to the bald giant. So Hosea could only seal him.
<br><br>
However, the bald giant didn't know how to kill Hosea either.
<br><br>
He couldn't do anything to the ever-changing water spirit like Hosea.
<br><br>
That was why when Zen saw Hosea float towards him, he automatically increased his guard.
<br><br>
His strength was truly beyond Zen's expectations. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, is there any way to defeat this water spirit?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Even the Magical Thunder Slave he had encountered before couldn't be killed with brute force—but after the Primeval Lord of Heaven used the Imprisoning Lightning, he transformed into another form and became easy to kill.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded.
<br><br>
It was safe to say that in the whole human race and even among the civilizations on the Other Shore, the Primeval Lord of Heaven probably knew the Element Spirit Civilization best. He had his way of restraining the Five-Element Spirits.
<br><br>
"The Five-Element Spirits don't have forms, which makes it hard to kill them, but after a long time of being in conflicts with them, the civilizations that insisted on the Finale Way finally came up with some methods."
<br><br>
Back then, the civilizations that believed in the Finale Way had also privately exchanged methods on how to deal with the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
The water spirits did not have a form, but that didn't mean that they were completely flawless. The most common method against them was fire attacks.
<br><br>
They could be burned and sealed with strong fire until their forms completely disappeared, then they died. "Could you possibly use such a method?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
"We're just energy souls. My previous attacks relied on the Civilization Artifact, so I can't fight against a water spirit at the Eternal Realm with my energy soul," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said and shook his head.
<br><br>
If the real God of Fire, Zhurong was with them, he could fight Hosea with the fire attack. Still, the fire the energy soul of Zhurong released wasn't enough to threaten Hosea.
<br><br>
"But there is another method," the Primeval Lord of Heaven continued. "It is somewhat similar to the Imprisoning Lighting. You need to transform the water spirit into another form, then kill him. This way is called the Earth Wood Seal, but it's also very difficult to seal Hosea. Most importantly, you need to be strong enough to kill him after you seal him," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.
<br><br>
As the Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke, the human race's book began to turn over, and a triangular rune flew out from a particular page.
<br><br>
On the top of the rune was a water-shaped pattern, and on both sides of the bottom were earth and wood-shaped patterns.
<br><br>
When Zen, who was now a little desperate, heard those words, his heart skipped a beat.
<br><br>
Even if the Primeval Lord of Heaven felt that it was hard for Zen to resist, the Earth Wood Seal would still give him a chance to counterattack! Just as Zen was still communicating with the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Hosea was already in front of him. At the same time, he raised the blades in his hands, as if he was going to chop Zen's head at any time. "I'll give you one last chance. How did you understand the bald giant's language?" he hissed.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze crossed Hosea as he stared at the bald giant behind him.
<br><br>
Even though the bald giant was sealed and unable to move, his eyes were still flexible. His angry red eyes were still visible through the dark blue ice.
<br><br>
The bald giant had just escaped from the Cold Prison, but Hosea froze him just now. Everyone could only imagine how angry he was.
<br><br>
Anger could make him stronger.
<br><br>
The bald giant had once mentioned to Zen their source of strength.
<br><br>
Perhaps, Hosea's ice seal might not be able to seal the bald giant in the end.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen thought quickly and made a decision.
<br><br>
He wasn't sure if the bald giant could break through ice around him, but at that point, Zen couldn't do anything but delay things and give the bald giant more time to break through the ice! "Primeval Lord of Heaven, please give me the Earth Wood Seal!" Zen communicated to his inner world. Of course, the Primeval Lord of Heaven did not hesitate.
<br><br>
He extended his hand and gently pointed at the triangle rune. The triangle rune spun a few times, then it turned into a golden beam of light and flew towards the sky! Buzz...
<br><br>
Once the rune was out from his inner world, Zen held it in his hand.
<br><br>
When he saw that Hosea had gotten a little impatient, he immediately said, "Because I've deciphered his language!"
<br><br>
"Deciphered his language?" Hosea narrowed his eyes in doubt.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had also tried to do this before.
<br><br>
However, the bald giant's language was very complicated, and every enunciation could mean multiple things.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization was not as good as the Calculation Civilization in calculation. It would probably take them a long time to decipher the language after taking so many possibilities into account.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization was also aware of it. That was one of the reasons why they froze the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization! The green figure had previously told Zen that the Element Spirit Civilization couldn't destroy the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. But in fact, they could do this if they wanted.
<br><br>
The truth was, the Element Spirit Civilization just wanted to control the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization at the right time, so they naturally didn't want to destroy it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3762 The Method Of Dodging Zen met Hosea's eyes and made a gesture with his finger. "I simply used the Sanskrit deciphering method to understand his language..."
<br><br>
He was, of course, spouting nonsense, but it wasn't entirely baseless. There was bound to be some similarity between Sanskrit words and the bald giant's language, but the latter was definitely far more difficult to understand.
<br><br>
However, his claims attracted Hosea's attention. "The Sanskrit deciphering method..." he repeated. Hosea's eyes shone with intrigue as he looked at Zen. "Which civilization's rules did you use? The human civilization?"
<br><br>
There were numerous methods in deciphering Sanskrit and every civilization developed their own. The Element Spirit Civilization once consolidated and summarized all these methods.
<br><br>
Since Zen was human, Hosea naturally thought that he used the human civilization's rules.
<br><br>
"Human civilization's rules?" Zen repeated with a smile before he shook his head. "No, I found a lost Other Shore civilization in Stage Twenty-six of the Other Shore that summarized the method."
<br><br>
Thus began Zen's long, drawn-out tale of complete, utter nonsense.
<br><br>
All sorts of secrets were hidden on the Other Shore and not even the Element Spirit Civilization knew everything. It was not difficult for Zen to fool Hosea with wild, elaborate, and vivid descriptions and the latter could only listen patiently.
<br><br>
It didn't matter whether Zen was lying or telling the truth.
<br><br>
At the end of the day, Stage Thirty was Hosea's territory. Everything was under his control here.
<br><br>
As Zen continued his nonsensical tale, he noticed the bald giant's eyes get redder and redder while his face got even more distorted.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
To his horror, the solid ice that encased the bald giant shattered with a loud bang.
<br><br>
The bald giant's skin turned blood-red as it expanded. Infinite power burst out from his body and the ice spears that trapped him snapped one by one.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Once free from the ice seal, the bald giant stepped forward and the whole ice city began to shake.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
With stunning agility, the giant's blood-red fist rushed towards Hosea's head.
<br><br>
Hosea merely responded with a mocking smile.
<br><br>
He was an immortal water spirit and it was impossible to kill him with just brute force.
<br><br>
When the huge fist smashed down upon him, Hosea made no move to dodge. All he needed to do was blink and the bald giant would freeze once again.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen's eyes flashed and he finally made his move.
<br><br>
He had the triangular Earth Wood Seal imprinted on his palm and the distance between him and his target was only ten feet.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
He took a step forward and was able to bridge the gap between him and Hosea.
<br><br>
Hosea turned around with a look of confusion on his face.
<br><br>
Perhaps it was due to his arrogance that he did not think for a second that Zen would be able to hurt him. Instead of dodging, Hosea merely sneered at the oncoming attack.
<br><br>
However, the moment he saw the imprint on Zen's palm, he froze.
<br><br>
The Earth Wood Seal? There was no way that a water spirit like him wouldn't know what that was.
<br><br>
This seal had taken countless water spirits' lives! How in the world could it be here in Stage Thirty, his domain? Just as Hosea came to a sinking realization, it was already too late for him to dodge. Zen's palm had already landed on his back and imprinted the Earth Wood Seal.
<br><br>
A water spirit had the ability to morph into whatever shape he wanted.
<br><br>
If Hosea willed it, he could integrate himself with the entirety of the ice city.
<br><br>
In fact, it could also be said that the ice city itself was part of his body already.
<br><br>
However, the moment the Earth Wood Seal landed on his back, his entire body turned a sick shade of brownish-yellow. The former water spirit seemingly turned into an earth spirit as tender branches began to burst out of his body layer by layer.
<br><br>
"You, you..."
<br><br>
In this moment of crisis, Hosea could only stutter in frustration.
<br><br>
He was unable to change shape because of the Earth Wood Seal and he would definitely die under this heavy blow.
<br><br>
With rage in his eyes, Hosea let out a desperate, horrifying scream.
<br><br>
"Let's die together then!" he shouted as he stretched out his arms and wrapped them around Zen with branches from within his body.
<br><br>
At the sudden barrage of branches, Zen did his best to twist his way out.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, though the Earth Wood Seal transformed Hosea's entire constitution, it did nothing to lessen his strength.
<br><br>
As a powerful Eternal Realm warrior, and despite the pressure of Stage Thirty of the Other Shore, Hosea's strength remained superior. There was no way Zen could get rid of his branches at all.
<br><br>
"You want to break away from me?" Hosea sneered.
<br><br>
His branches wrapped around Zen even tighter and the huge fist quickly pressed the two of them to the ground.
<br><br>
Zen grit his teeth as he struggled in vain. "I can't break free, but you seem to have overlooked something..."
<br><br>
He paused and did not continue until they were only ten feet away from the ground. "I can exit the Other Shore."
<br><br>
Hosea was evidently struck dumb when he heard this. He had completely forgotten to use the Soul Restraining Sand on Zen! As a result, the tightly wrapped Zen was able to disappear! The man had already recited the Illusion Breaking Rune in advance and Hosea only had time to shout a curse before he fell into eternal darkness.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The explosion was deafening and the ground trembled under the sorrowful pounding of the bald giant. "My friend..."
<br><br>
He could have never left the Cold Prison without Zen's help and viewed him as a close ally.
<br><br>
The bald giant understood the situation but couldn't take his fist back.
<br><br>
Libby and Elizabeth, who were on the upper ice field, were struck dumb at what they had just witnessed.
<br><br>
Elizabeth was even more distraught. To her, Zen and Emperor Charm were already one and Zen was the only one she could follow. To see him die this way was an extremely difficult thing to accept.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen had quietly returned to the Other Shore and heard the bald giant's sad song. He smiled and whistled low.
<br><br>
When the bald giant saw Zen reappear, he immediately pounded on his chest in excitement.
<br><br>
Both Elizabeth and Libby were also wide-eyed in shock. It seemed that Zen did not die but just withdrew in order to dodge that fatal blow.
<br><br>
As for the Five-Element Slaves, they were, in one word, dumbfounded.
<br><br>
"Master Hosea is still alive!"
<br><br>
"The stage ruler just hid himself!"
<br><br>
"He's just waiting for a chance to give the bald giant a fatal blow!"
<br><br>
They could not believe Hosea would die this way.
<br><br>
It was a known fact that the Blooming Jade Stage was controlled by Hosea and he held absolute authority over it.
<br><br>
At that moment, a circle of light rose from the ground and flew towards the bald giant's head. With a slight fluctuation of light, the bald giant disappeared.
<br><br>
When a stage ruler was killed, the one who killed him would be heralded as the new stage ruler.
<br><br>
The appearance of the circle of light signified the bald giant's new role as ruler of the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
It was only then that Hosea's death was confirmed to the Five-Element Slaves. The entire Blooming Jade Stage was now set for a lot of changes.
<br><br>
Chapter 3763 Wipe Out The Other Shore creatures in the ice city hid in every corner of the ice castles. From there, they observed the battle without having to worry about getting hurt.
<br><br>
When they realized that Hosea had died, everyone was washed over with a wave of sadness.
<br><br>
Neal, the powerful Holy Soul Realm warrior of the Divine Farmer race, was no exception to this. He frowned and left quietly.
<br><br>
Even if Hosea was not among the most powerful warriors of the Element Spirit race, he still held a special status. His death would mean the loss of the Blooming Jade Stage. Knowing this, Neal had to inform Divine Farmer as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Aside from a small group of the Souls of Light, most of the Other Shore creatures were at a loss. They had no clue what would happen to the Blooming Jade Stage. Should they retreat or would it be smarter to stay in the ice city? "Master Hosea really died..."
<br><br>
"That human brat! It is all his damn fault!"
<br><br>
"He killed Master Hosea!"
<br><br>
Within seconds, the Five-Element Slaves were in a rage. At this point, retreating was not an option anymore, and they charged madly at Zen.
<br><br>
However, though the Five-Element Slaves were very powerful, they didn't have any high positions in the Element Spirit race. After all, they were merely slaves created by the Element Spirit race in the first place.
<br><br>
Seeing the Five-Element Slaves rush towards him, Zen remained calm and unmoved. Because he could not put up a fight, he decided it would be best to dodge.
<br><br>
With a light tap of his toe against the ground, he glided backwards to create distance. As he saw the Magical Thunder Slave in the front aiming for his head, his figure faded away and he exited the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"He ran away! What a coward!"
<br><br>
"He retreated from the Other Shore again!"
<br><br>
"What should we do now?"
<br><br>
Since their main target disappeared, the Five-Element Slaves did not know what to do. After all, they were only capable of carrying out tasks. With their leader dead, they did not know how to continue.
<br><br>
However, their confusion did not last long. Not long after, a ray of white light shone, revealing a huge figure.
<br><br>
Before, it took Zen much effort to eventually become the ruler of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, the bald giant came from outside of the chaos. He had a skill for comprehending Sanskrit words, so understanding the theurgy on the slate was a piece of cake for him.
<br><br>
Once he returned, the bald giant gave the Five-Element Slaves cold looks.
<br><br>
He ground his teeth against each other in anger.
<br><br>
He hated the Element Spirit race! Whoosh! With one deep breath, the giant smashed his fist directly towards the Moon Fire Slave that was in front of him.
<br><br>
At this point, the Moon Fire Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves realized something was wrong. They began to flee and flail in all directions, running without thinking.
<br><br>
But no matter how fast they ran, they could never escape the bald giant! Thump! Thump! Thump...
<br><br>
The bald giant's first punch didn't hit the Moon Fire Slave, so he chased the slave down and began smashing his fist randomly.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slaves crawled like crippled bugs on the ground. With a hit, their armors and spiritual cores were smashed into pieces.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Chill Ice Slaves had it a little better. Because they transformed into various flying forms and scattered in all directions. They were much harder to target.
<br><br>
There still happened to be a few Chill Ice Slaves that were hit, but other than that, the rest were safe.
<br><br>
As for the Magical Thunder Slaves, they were probably the safest among the slaves.
<br><br>
The bald giant did not have an effective way to deal with them, especially because they launched attacks on his weakest body parts.
<br><br>
However, these tactics only caused weak damage to the giant. After one round of the battle, the bald giant had no serious injuries, which sent the Magical Thunder Slaves to retreat.
<br><br>
By the time Zen returned to the Other Shore, he saw that the Five-Element Slaves on the ice field had almost been killed by the bald giant.
<br><br>
As for the other creatures on the Other Shore, a few decided to escape, while the others didn't intend to resist.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elizabeth and Libby didn't descend from upper ice field until they caught sight of Zen.
<br><br>
"The central ice city has been taken. Anything else?" Zen asked them calmly.
<br><br>
"It would be easy to occupy the remaining several ice castles," Elizabeth smiled. "Besides, the bald giant became the stage ruler. Let's see if he has any interest in hunting down the Element Spirit race."
<br><br>
"I might as well ask him," said Zen.
<br><br>
Just then, the energy souls of Fuxi, Houyi, Emperor Charm, the Snake Goddess and the rest hovered over Zen's head again and began to sing their song.
<br><br>
After he finished, Fuxi's face looked disgusted. "When the hell will this end?"
<br><br>
Singing stupid songs was not part of what he signed up. He hated it, especially because no one could understand them.
<br><br>
"Very soon," the Snake Goddess comforted him. "Primeval Lord of Heaven is training the rest. It won't be long until they take our places."
<br><br>
The singing was necessary for Zen to communicate with the bald giant.
<br><br>
Without the songs, the bald giant wouldn't have understood anything.
<br><br>
Anyway, these songs were simple to create. They just needed to make some sounds that ordinary warriors could do. With this, the Primeval Lord of Heaven recruited some people in Zen's inner world to take the place of the elites who had helped Zen "pronounce".
<br><br>
When the bald giant heard the singing, his eyebrows raised in interest. "The other several ice castles? I won't let go of anyone from the Element Spirit race!"
<br><br>
The giant had a deep hatred for the Element Spirit race. There was no way he'd let them off so easily.
<br><br>
Two thousand miles away from the ice city stood three ice castles, strategically connected to one another.
<br><br>
These ice castles were meant to be the gathering places, second only to the ice city in the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
The news of the fallen ice city and Hosea's death had not spread yet, so the Five-Element Slaves in the ice castles were unaware of the crisis.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump...
<br><br>
As the ice-covered earth trembled, the Other Shore creatures and the FiveElement Slaves made their way out of the ice castles.
<br><br>
With a clear view of who coming over, their faces shifted from calm to anxious. Chaos struck, and everyone ended up shouting, dodging, and running as fast as they could.
<br><br>
Within five minutes, the three ice castles were left to ruins.
<br><br>
On the other hand, with the guidance of Elizabeth, the bald giant charged towards the next nearest gathering place.
<br><br>
It was in these three days that the Blooming Jade Stage was far from peaceful.
<br><br>
Over time, the ice castles built by the Element Spirit race were completely destroyed to dust, all by the bald giant.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Five-Element Slaves and the Other Shore races who were obedient to the Element Spirit race suffered great losses. None of them had any good plans to deal with the giant, which led them to surrender. It was their only choice—death or retreat.
<br><br>
The races on the Other Shore appeared innocent, but neither Elizabeth nor Zen had any intentions of letting them off so easily.
<br><br>
The fact that they joined the Element Spirit race meant that they had to stick to their stands. After all, if the Element Spirit race was ever in trouble, the creatures on the Other Shore would not hesitate to aid them.
<br><br>
After three days passed and the chaos subsided, the bald giant carried Zen, Elizabeth, and Libby to the front of the ice castle found in the deepest area of the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
It was only a few days ago when the three were blocked in front of the castle. Now, they had the giant to carry them.
<br><br>
At this point, the castle was empty and all the Five-Element Slaves that once guarded it retreated to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore. It was a ghost town here.
<br><br>
Chapter 3764 Arrangement "You can go to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore through the star rings in the ice castle, but the star rings have been provided for the creatures from the chaos. I don't know if you can pass through one," Zen said to the bald giant.
<br><br>
Each star ring corresponded to a race. Only members of a race could ascend from their star ring.
<br><br>
It was unlikely that the Colossus race had an exclusive star ring. The members of the Element Spirit race had probably used some other means to bring the bald giant to where he was at the moment.
<br><br>
In addition to this, the bald giant was also facing another problem. He had become the ruler of the Blooming Jade Stage. According to the rules of the Other Shore, once he became a stage ruler, he would forever be bound to this stage of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Elvinia and Zen had become stage rulers in succession, but they had not become bound to their respective stages of the Other Shore. This confused Zen, who wondered if the bald giant would be accorded such treatment.
<br><br>
The bald giant nodded and took a step forward. He lifted the roof of the ice castle into the air, revealing the star rings neatly placed within.
<br><br>
He grabbed at the star rings, spilling them all over the ice.
<br><br>
"These things are so small. How can I get into them?" the bald giant said, frowning.
<br><br>
"Just step into a star ring," said Zen.
<br><br>
The star ring was similar to a transmission door. No matter how large an individual was, a star ring could accommodate them.
<br><br>
Even the star rings for races with huge figures, such as the Abyss Spirit race, were about the same size as that for humans.
<br><br>
The bald giant stared at a star ring before taking a deep breath and then stepping forward into it.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The star ring sucked him in with a whoosh, emitting white light as it did.
<br><br>
"He seems to be going through the star ring for the Ear Mouse race. Is it possible?" Libby asked, worried.
<br><br>
Zen shrugged and said, "I don't know. He has to try it himself."
<br><br>
Zen had communicated a lot with the bald giant on their way here.
<br><br>
He had established a certain friendship with the giant after multiple rounds of battle. They had more to talk about with each other now and the Primeval Lord of Heaven also took the opportunity to tell Zen to ask him some questions.
<br><br>
The bald giant was called Pompeo, a name that had a far more complicated pronunciation than it looked.
<br><br>
To the disappointment of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Colossus race seemed to be a primitive race. Pompeo could read a few Sanskrit words, but he didn't know a lot about the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He only knew that the Colossus race controlled ten mountains, each of which was vast and boundless. He lived at the top of one of the mountains all year round and fell to the Other Shore when he went hunting one day.
<br><br>
He had no idea about the other races and their geography and culture in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He had a vast knowledge about hunting skills and all kinds of beasts in the mountain. Zen had seen these beasts, which were the monsters that were also imprisoned in the Cold Prisons.
<br><br>
At these answers, Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven looked disappointed.
<br><br>
At this point, they only knew that the area outside Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore was mountainous and that was where Pompeo's clansmen lived. They knew nothing else.
<br><br>
But when Zen began to inquire about the colorful Starry Roc-fish, Pompeo looked at him with a newfound respect. He told Zen that the Starry Roc-fish was a sacred beast of the Colossus race. Whenever the sacred beast appeared, no matter what the clansmen were doing, the priest of the Colossus race would lead all of them to kneel down before it.
<br><br>
This sacred beast had, however, never descended. It only floated back and forth in the sky.
<br><br>
It was easy for a primitive race to form a faith. According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven's judgment, the members of the Colossus race might not have any inner connection with the Starry Roc-fish. But for some reason, the Starry Roc-fish had been circling in the sky of the Three Purities Stage and flying over the ten mountains. This had resulted in the members of the Colossus race taking it as their faith.
<br><br>
This was all that Zen had heard from Pompeo.
<br><br>
The star ring for the Ear Mouse race suddenly began to tremble violently, and it spat out a ray of white light.
<br><br>
Pompeo's body came flying out of the star ring and smashed into the surface of the ice not far from them, tumbling in several circles before he came to a stop and got to his feet.
<br><br>
"He failed!"
<br><br>
Libby's and Elizabeth's eyes flashed.
<br><br>
They had both anticipated this result. It would have been incredible if he had ascended from the star ring for the Ear Mouse race.
<br><br>
"I couldn't ascend," said Pompeo, touching his bald head.
<br><br>
Zen smiled and said, "Try another star ring."
<br><br>
Taking Zen's advice, Pompeo stepped into another star ring.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before he was thrown out again.
<br><br>
It was not until he had tried several star rings in succession and failed every single time that Zen sighed and said, "It looks like we'll have to use some other means to send you up."
<br><br>
"What other means?"
<br><br>
Pompeo asked helplessly. He had always wanted to return to his race and was unwilling to stay on the Other Shore any longer.
<br><br>
"We'll have to find some means from the Element Spirit race," said Zen.
<br><br>
"I can't go to the Three Purities Stage!" said Pompeo anxiously.
<br><br>
"But I can. I will help you find a way to step into the Three Purities Stage,"
<br><br>
Zen said.
<br><br>
Pompeo looked grateful at this. "What can I do?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Help us control the Blooming Jade Stage and suppress the Element Spirit race," Zen said.
<br><br>
Because of Pompeo's actions, the Element Spirit race had chosen to temporarily retreat. Except for the Five-Element Slaves that Pompeo had killed, the remaining members of the Element Spirit race had all retreated to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Although all the ice castles in the Blooming Jade Stage had been swept away, there was no doubt that the Element Spirit race would make a comeback once Pompeo left.
<br><br>
But if Pompeo were to stay here, he would be able to help the humans gradually take control of the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
Zen had come up with this idea before, but he wouldn't keep Pompeo here if he could ascend.
<br><br>
Now that Pompeo couldn't leave by himself, Zen had to make good use of this situation. In return, he would help him find a way to ascend to the upper stages.
<br><br>
Pompeo blinked his huge eyes and nodded, agreeing with Zen's suggestion.
<br><br>
The Colossus race was a primitive race, but Pompeo was not stupid. He knew that Zen would not help him for no reason. He himself had helped Zen because they had the same enemy and they could make use of each other.
<br><br>
"Elizabeth, would you like to stay in the Blooming Jade Stage to assist Pompeo?" Zen turned to ask Elizabeth.
<br><br>
By asking Elizabeth to assist Pompeo, he intended for Elizabeth to take charge instead since Pompeo would be fighting most of the time.
<br><br>
Elizabeth didn't refuse, but she was hesitant as she said, "But I can't communicate with him."
<br><br>
Now, the only person who could communicate with Pompeo was Zen.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter. I'll talk to him about everything in advance. He'll follow your orders," Zen said.
<br><br>
Pompeo needed to kill all the members of the Element Spirit race who entered the Blooming Jade Stage, or anyone that Elizabeth considered a threat. She only needed to give simple orders for him to do her bidding.
<br><br>
Chapter 3765 Bone Cave Zen spoke with Pompeo a while longer and asked him to cooperate with Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Pompeo wanted to return to his hometown and so demonstrated absolute willingness to do whatever was needed of him.
<br><br>
Now that this problem was solved, Zen and Libby decided to head for Stage Thirty-one.
<br><br>
Before they took their leave, Elizabeth stopped them, "Wait a moment."
<br><br>
"What's the matter?" Zen asked with curiosity, turning to look at Elizabeth.
<br><br>
"The Land of Bone Tribulation is way more dangerous than the Soul City. I can't go with you, but just... be careful..." Elizabeth said tenderly.
<br><br>
Her original plan was to escort Zen all the way to Stage Thirty-two, after sneaking through the Blooming Jade Stage. He was inexperienced and having Elizabeth at his side would certainly help him in avoiding many dangers.
<br><br>
However, she had never expected her plan to have such a huge flaw. As a result, she would actually have to stay in charge of the entire Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
The sudden change of the situation was difficult for her to adapt to and left her feeling somewhat overwhelmed.
<br><br>
"Don't worry about me, you still need to worry about the Element Spirit race's retaliation. They won't let you off easily," Zen warned.
<br><br>
With Pompeo's strength, he could defeat every enemy in Stage Thirty, but who knew what strange methods the Element Spirit race would use against him? Zen and Libby then walked straight through the star ring of the human race.
<br><br>
As they crossed the threshold, they transformed into two rays of white light and shot upwards to the higher stage.
<br><br>
The Sanskrit Light Stage, Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore, was said to be the most mysterious of them all.
<br><br>
Zen opened his eyes once they had entered the Sanskrit Light Stage and saw nothing but blank whiteness. He was soon surprised to discover he was in a narrow cave that was white in every direction he looked. It was certainly strange on the eyes, and there appeared to be a special aura around as well.
<br><br>
An aura familiar to Zen. It reminded him of the bottom of the chaos. This feeling he got now was very similar to the aura in the prison created by the Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
"What is this cave?" Zen asked looking around and taking a few steps forward.
<br><br>
"It's no ordinary cave. This is a bone cave," answered Libby. This might have been her first time here, but she had done her research beforehand and thus knew more about this stage than Zen. "In fact, we're inside a very large bone right now."
<br><br>
"Inside a bone?" Zen's astonishment didn't last long; his eyes widened and he looked around again as he soon understood why he sensed the familiar aura of wild bones.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the bones were empty inside. Some gigantic creatures did have large openings within their bones, and these were enough for smaller creatures to move around freely.
<br><br>
He walked up to the wall of the cave and reached out to touch it. It felt cool on his palm; it was indeed the touch of bones.
<br><br>
"It is said that all paths in the entire Sanskrit Light Stage are formed by similar bone caves to this. The world outside the caves is a deadly forbidden area, similar to the upper ice field in Stage Thirty," Libby said smiling joyfully.
<br><br>
She had once believed quite firmly that the upper ice field was a forbidden area. But then she had followed Zen across it twice! It was inconceivable.
<br><br>
She now thought that no so-called 'forbidden area' existed in the world at all.
<br><br>
"You mean we will travel through the Sanskrit Light Stage in these bone caves? How do larger creatures pass through these caves? It seems it would be impossible for them," Zen asked lost in curiosity.
<br><br>
It was no problem for creatures of human size, and even creatures twice the size of a human would still be able to pass through these bone caves, even if only barely.
<br><br>
But for enormous creatures like those of the Abyss Spirit race, if they were to enter a cave of this size in the Sanskrit Light Stage, they would either stretch the caves dreadfully or get crushed in the narrow space.
<br><br>
And it would only be worse for a member of Colossus race. If Pompeo were with them, his life would have come to a grim end.
<br><br>
"There are larger bone caves for them," Libby explained cheerfully.
<br><br>
Elizabeth had been their guide in Stage Thirty since she was most familiar with the area. Even if Libby knew anything about the places they went, she had virtually no chance to show it.
<br><br>
Now that Elizabeth was no longer with them, Libby felt the important mission of guiding Zen fell to her.
<br><br>
"What? Larger bone caves?" Zen exclaimed in shock, "A space this large inside a bone is astonishing enough. If there are caves massive enough for the Abyss Spirit race, how large will those bones actually be? What sort of creatures would have such gigantic bones?"
<br><br>
Libby shrugged and said, "I haven't found any information relevant to that in the documents." She patted the wall of the bone cave and added, "I don't know what kind of creature's bone this is either. Let's go now."
<br><br>
Zen nodded and followed her into the depths of the cave.
<br><br>
The entire bone cave was dead straight for the around a thousand feet they advanced. But then, a sharp bend revealed itself before them, with a bulging joint between the two bone caves.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the corners of the walls as they made their way through the joint. He hoped to get a glimpse of the forbidden area Libby had mentioned.
<br><br>
But the joint had no gaps at all, and he couldn't see anything beyond the walls.
<br><br>
This next bone was also a thousand feet long. Once they had passed through the second bone cave, they came to an open space. It was a huge bone cavity which connected with other bone caves.
<br><br>
They entered the bone cavity and Zen glanced around before asking, "There is more than one path. Which one should we take?"
<br><br>
The bone cavity was connected to four other bone caves creating four different paths. It appeared the entire Sanskrit Light Stage was an incredibly large maze.
<br><br>
"The second one on the left," answered Libby without hesitation.
<br><br>
"How do you know?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"From the records of the predecessors. Didn't you try learning about the higher stages before entering the Other Shore?" Libby asked.
<br><br>
Knowledge of the higher stages of the Other Shore was kept confidential to the public, but it was open to the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, especially the elites in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
Not only was Libby a genius with extraordinary talent, but she worked hard to learn anything she could as well. She had already done her research about stages to come before entering the Soul City.
<br><br>
Zen smiled awkwardly and said, "Apologies for my carelessness."
<br><br>
"That's all right. I'll lead the way," Libby said walking to the front and entering into the second bone cave on the left.
<br><br>
They walked along this path a while before coming to another bone cavity.
<br><br>
Again, Libby didn't hesitate in choosing the second cave on the left. She then turned to explain to Zen, "There's actually more than one correct path leading to the Land of Bone Tribulation. This is the shortest recorded path..."
<br><br>
As she spoke, they suddenly heard a rustling coming from the depths of the cave ahead of them.
<br><br>
The caves were hollow so even the smallest sound would echo through and travel a long distance. They listened carefully and soon realized there were creatures running towards them.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Several figures emerged ahead. The one at the front yelled at them, "Run! Humans, run for your lives! There are Ghost-claw Worms coming!"
<br><br>
"Is that an Ear Mouse?" Zen recognized the voice and then saw the shapes of five Ear Mice clearly.
<br><br>
Libby's joy fled at the creature's warning. "Oh no, we should run now!" she exclaimed.
<br><br>
Zen didn't fully understand what was coming but he could tell that Ghostclaw Worms were formidable enemies from Libby's reaction. He quickly turned and followed her out of the bone cave.
<br><br>
Chapter 3766 Getting Involved They retreated from the cave hurriedly and the Ear Mice soon followed.
<br><br>
For these Ear Mice to be in the Sanskrit Light Stage meant they too were powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm. However, their terror as they fled was clear. Zen realized the Ghost-claw Worms they spoke of should not be underestimated.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As the Ear Mice escaped into the bone cavity, a dark black object suddenly came from behind them.
<br><br>
It looked like a snake, but its front end split into three, like a three-fingered ghost claw! Crack! The three fingers of the ghost claw suddenly stretched and slammed down heavily on the head of an Ear Mouse, its fingertips penetrating right into the poor creature's soul! "No!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse let out a series of desperate screams as it was dragged back into the bone cave. Its distressing squeak could be heard a long while before it finally stopped. This must have meant that the Ear Mouse had been dragged a great distance away! The other four Ear Mice could do nothing but watch helplessly as their companion was hauled away. Without missing a beat, they then escaped into another bone cave, swiftly moving on.
<br><br>
Zen and Libby followed the four Ear Mice into the bone cave.
<br><br>
Behind them, many black Ghost-claw Worms were swarming over, chasing after them blisteringly fast, so fast it seemed as if they were flying! Zen glanced back as he ran and saw that they were not flying but crawling along the walls of the cave.
<br><br>
There were countless tiny feet on the limbs of the Ghost-claw Worms, similar to those of a centipede. Their feet moved fast and flowed like waves, advancing them along the wall at high speed! "What the hell are these Ghost-claw Worms? Their heads look like a ghost claw, but their bodies are worms..." Zen asked sounding a little disgusted.
<br><br>
"I don't know. According to the documents, these creatures come from the outside world," answered Libby while she kept running hard.
<br><br>
"The outside world?" Zen was stunned.
<br><br>
"These bone caves are not completely closed off. Some parts of the bone joints are broken and creatures from the forbidden area outside break in,"
<br><br>
Libby revealed.
<br><br>
The bone joints Zen had observed were closed tightly, but apparently not all were this way. This gave the Other Shore creatures outside the bone caves a chance to invade.
<br><br>
Stage Twenty-nine and Stage Thirty-one were chocked full of dangers. The Element Spirit race couldn't establish a gathering spot on the two stages, which was why they attached great importance to the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
Swish! The Ghost-claw Worms were fast and relentless, quickly closing the distance between them. If this continued, sooner or later they'd be devoured.
<br><br>
"Zen, take the first path on the left!"
<br><br>
Libby shouted as they got close to the next bone cavity coming up ahead.
<br><br>
She had never imagined they'd encounter such dangers when they had just entered the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
They rushed into the bone cavity and Zen and Libby made a sharp turn, taking them into the first bone cave on the left. The Ear Mice, however, rushed into a cave in the middle.
<br><br>
Then something unexpected happened. The black Ghost-claw Worms didn't follow behind them; they ignored them completely. They seemed focused on targeting the Ear Mice and only chasing them down as fiercely as they had been.
<br><br>
"Well..." Zen stopped at the entrance of the cave. "They seem to be set on the Ear Mice."
<br><br>
"It's possible, but we still have to keep our guard up," said Libby vigilantly.
<br><br>
The black slender bodies of the worms wriggled past in front of Zen and Libby. Their bodies seemed to be infinitely long, long enough for them to hunt down and swallow every life form in the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
"No!"
<br><br>
It wasn't long before the miserable screams of another Ear Mouse came from the next cave as it was dragged away horribly.
<br><br>
"If we cut off their bodies, will they die?" Zen asked, excited by his idea.
<br><br>
It was very hard for a super force to have a Holy Soul Realm master, so it would be a great tragedy to lose a master at the said realm.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse race had always been on good terms with Zen so he didn't have the heart to see them die right before him.
<br><br>
But Libby shook her head furiously at Zen's suggestion, "No! Please don't do that!"
<br><br>
Libby had much less experience than Elizabeth in dealing with crises. All she knew was the documents contained warnings to never provoke any living being in the Sanskrit Light Stage. Just like the Garudas in Stage Twenty-nine, they also lacked in power to combat the creatures in this stage.
<br><br>
Similarly, she believed that the best course of action was to avoid the Ghost-claw Worms and so didn't want Zen to meddle.
<br><br>
She hoped the worms would simply leave after capturing all the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, things didn't go according to plan. The remaining three Ear Mice fled along the bone caves, circling all the way around and coming out the other side of the cave Zen and Libby were in! "Oh no!"
<br><br>
Despair washed over the Ear Mice's faces as they saw the long bodies of the Ghost-claw Worms behind Zen and Libby.
<br><br>
The heads of the Ghost-claw Worms were hot on their heels, while their long bodies blocked the opposite end leading out. The cave they had escaped into had obviously turned out to be a dead end! "These guys..." Libby sighed, exasperated at the Ear Mice coming back at them.
<br><br>
She had expected them to draw the Ghost-claw Worms away. Yet they brought disaster back their way and took her and Zen back into the middle of a predicament.
<br><br>
Zen gazed cautiously at the ferocious heads of the worms and asked Libby, "Do you have any Other Shore weapons with you?"
<br><br>
His physical body couldn't have a Sumeru space on the Other Shore, so all the weapons and treasures he had collected in Stage Fourteen were left in Elvinia's care.
<br><br>
"Yes!"
<br><br>
Libby answered. She flicked her hand and a flash of blue light sparked from her Sumeru Space and a golden long sword appeared in her hand.
<br><br>
It was made of the sort of rare ores she had dug up in Stage Twenty-five, and it was one of her favorites.
<br><br>
Zen took the long sword from her and strode out of the bone cave! Buzz! As the incredible power of the Civilization Artifact surged into his body, he slashed the sword forward. A beam of sword radiance containing tens of thousands of divine megatons of force gathered and shot out.
<br><br>
Puff! The bodies of the Ghost-claw Worms were sliced like a bundle of hemp rope and left an opening for them to escape through.
<br><br>
The heads of the Ghost-claw Worms behind the Ear Mice all hissed in pain.
<br><br>
Even when their bodies were cut, their heads remained alive and even quickened their speed.
<br><br>
Zen did not care what was happening behind him. He rushed forward with Libby, and the three Ear Mice followed closely behind them.
<br><br>
"Human friend, thank you very much!"
<br><br>
"Thank you for saving our lives!"
<br><br>
"My friend, you are on the Other Shore in your physical form. Are you Zen Luo from the Oneness Sky Palace?"
<br><br>
When the Ear Mice saw Zen offering his hand, they all made up their minds to follow closely behind him. In their eyes, he was the last life-saving straw they had. They were able to identify Zen quickly by his special form, as it was famous on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"What the hell did you do to provoke these Ghost-claw Worms? Why do they keep chasing you like this?"
<br><br>
Libby asked, annoyed and impatient, before Zen could even answer their question.
<br><br>
They had just reached the Sanskrit Light Stage and were now stuck being chased incessantly by these worms. It was all the Ear Mice's fault and she made her indignation obvious to them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3767 The Bottom Of The Sea "Squeak! There's something wrong with the whole Sanskrit Light Stage!"
<br><br>
the Ear Mouse in the lead said.
<br><br>
This Ear Mouse was called Fidel. It was one of the nineteen elders of the Ear Mouse race and held a high position in the race.
<br><br>
"Why is there something wrong with the Sanskrit Light Stage? What's the problem?" Zen asked with a frown.
<br><br>
Zen had passed through the Soul City quite smoothly. He had expected passing through the Land of Bone Tribulation to not be difficult either. But it didn't look easy.
<br><br>
"Many bone caves have been damaged! A number of things have come in!"
<br><br>
Fidel squeaked, horrified.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the Ghost-claw Worms had not been the only ones to drill into the bone caves from the outside.
<br><br>
"You can leave the Other Shore, but why do you still choose to run like this?" Libby asked.
<br><br>
The monsters outside the bone caves weren't like the Element Spirit race which stayed in the ice city. If they had no way out, they would recite the Illusion Breaking Rune and retreat.
<br><br>
Libby didn't want to help the Ear Mice, but she also didn't stop Zen when she noticed that he wanted to help them.
<br><br>
If they really couldn't find a way out, the worst that would happen was that she and Zen would temporarily have to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But even though the Ear Mice kept being chased by those monsters, they still did not retreat from the Other Shore. There had to be a reason for this! "Can't you see our feet?" Fidel squeaked.
<br><br>
Zen and Libby looked down to see that the footsteps of the Ear Mice were flashing with the pale blue light.
<br><br>
"Soul Interdicting Water?" Zen's gaze froze. "Do the Other Shore creatures of the Sanskrit Light Stage know how to use this thing?"
<br><br>
"I think..."
<br><br>
Libby was about to answer Zen's question, but Fidel interrupted her and said, "Zen, don't you have a good understanding of the Sanskrit Light Stage before entering it?"
<br><br>
Today was the second time that he had been asked such a question and Zen's face flamed in embarrassment. "Not really."
<br><br>
"The entire Sanskrit Light Stage is soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water.
<br><br>
The Soul Binding Thread, the Soul Interdicting Water, and the Soul Restraining Sand on the Other Shore are produced here," replied Fidel.
<br><br>
The Soul Interdicting Water in the Sanskrit Light Stage brought about many experiments among the super forces.
<br><br>
After collecting the Soul Interdicting Water, one needed to steam it with fire to remove all the impurities within it and obtain the purest Soul Restraining Sand. If one processed the Soul Restraining Sand again, they could get the Soul Binding Thread which was more difficult to get rid of.
<br><br>
The Sanskrit Light Stage not only had the Land of Bone Tribulation, but was also considered to be a place rich in mineral resources. The mine here, however, would just be regarded as a tool for the Other Shore Realm warriors of the chaos to kill each other.
<br><br>
"These bones are soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water!" Zen exclaimed, astonished.
<br><br>
"It's common sense. I thought you knew it," Libby said, shrugging.
<br><br>
There had once been a small number of people who had been to the forbidden area outside the bone caves and seen the Soul Interdicting Water as an ocean. A large portion of bones were soaked in the sea, while the rest of bones remained above sea level.
<br><br>
Zen and Libby were at the bottom of these bones when they ascended from the Blooming Jade Stage, which meant that they were actually at the bottom of the sea.
<br><br>
Strange creatures like the Ghost-claw Worms lived in the Soul Interdicting Water all year round and were clear about what their prey constituted. They would first attack creatures that were tainted with the Soul Interdicting Water.
<br><br>
So they had taken to ignoring Zen and Libby during the previous pursuit.
<br><br>
Even though Zen had cut off their bodies, the Ghost-claw Worms didn't have any intention of attacking Zen and Libby. They weren't intelligent and only kept chasing the Ear Mice all the time.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
Four Ghost-claw Worms sped up along the wall of the cave. The three fingers on their heads opened up, clamoring to grab the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
The three Ear Mice didn't give up and kept trying to escape the attacks of the Ghost-claw Worms.
<br><br>
They were, after all, at the Holy Soul Realm. Their souls were no weaker than ordinary physical bodies.
<br><br>
Fidel's body pressed against the ground as it rushed up along the circular wall of the cave, and managed to avoid the attack.
<br><br>
The other two Ear Mice also used the same method to display their agility.
<br><br>
But the Ghost-claw Worms were faster. One of the Ghost-claw Worms raised its three-fingered claw and grabbed one of the Ear Mice by the head, intending to drag it backwards.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse squeaked and struggled in anguish.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A sudden ray of sword light flashed at the Ghost-claw Worm's head, which was also its hand, and cut through it.
<br><br>
A mouth appeared in the palm of the Ghost-claw Worm's broken hand, and it let out a painful scream.
<br><br>
The three fingers released the Ear Mouse, as the Ghost-claw Worm rolled back and forth on the ground in pain.
<br><br>
Once the Ear Mouse broke free from the Ghost-claw Worm's grip, it recovered quickly and hurried to follow Fidel.
<br><br>
"This will be easy to deal with, especially since these Ghost-claw Worms are hell-bent on attacking only you," said Zen.
<br><br>
The Ghost-claw Worms were not invulnerable to blades and spears. They only moved fast, were large in number, and were very aggressive. But killing them wasn't difficult, especially with Zen's current strength.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Indeed!"
<br><br>
"Thank you, Zen!"
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
Fidel and the other Ear Mice were overjoyed.
<br><br>
The Ghost-claw Worms had chased them for a long time, and several of their members had died as a result of this.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Several more Ghost-claw Worms sped up and rushed over to them.
<br><br>
Zen raised his head, his gaze narrowing. The long sword in his hand had already started to emit specks of starlight.
<br><br>
Puff, puff, puff...
<br><br>
After several consecutive sword strikes, Zen stabbed at the wrists of the Ghost-claw Worms, which were also their necks.
<br><br>
The beheaded Ghost-claw Worms fell to the ground one after another, wailing and rolling on the ground. They were no longer able to chase the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
After he had figured out how to deal with the Ghost-claw Worms, Zen found that it was easy to handle them.
<br><br>
There were a large number of Ghost-claw Worms behind him. But as long as there were worms that dared to stretch their heads out, Zen would use his long sword to chop, stab and behead them.
<br><br>
In five minutes, Zen had killed more than thirty Ghost-claw Worms.
<br><br>
An hour later, there were only a few Ghost-claw Worms scattered on the wall.
<br><br>
Zen stopped and waved his long sword towards the sky. An arc-shaped sword light shot out of the sword and cut off the heads of the Ghost-claw Worms. They were now all struggling on the ground.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice stopped running and breathed a collective sigh of relief when the Ghost-claw Worms were finally killed.
<br><br>
"We got rid of them!"
<br><br>
"Zen, we would have died if it weren't for you!"
<br><br>
"What a coincidence! You saved my son in the Chaotic Source World before. You hadn't stepped into the Desire World at the time. I haven't expected you to reach the Sanskrit Light Stage and save my life," one of the Ear Mice exclaimed.
<br><br>
The three Ear Mice were expressing their gratitude when Libby suddenly asked, "But where are we now?"
<br><br>
At her question, the Ear Mice began to panic. Caught up in the chase that the Ghost-claw Worms had given them, they had no idea which bone cave they were in now.
<br><br>
Chapter 3768 Outside Libby's question made Zen and the three Ear Mice realize this was a problem that needed to be addressed.
<br><br>
The bone caves in the Sanskrit Light Stage formed the most complicated maze any of them had ever come across. Up until now, there was still no one who had completely worked out the entire maze.
<br><br>
"Deviating too far from our original route would be disastrous, I'm afraid,"
<br><br>
Fidel said seriously.
<br><br>
Zen considered their options for a while before finally saying, "Those Ghost-claw Worms always leave traces, and we can go back the same way we came by following those traces they've left."
<br><br>
After that, he turned and began walking back.
<br><br>
Zen had sliced the Ghost-claw Worms' heads off at the neck and they still struggled on the ground. Even now they still stretched out three fingers in an attempt to grab Zen as he passed.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The long sword in Zen's hand shook, and with a flash of sword radiance, he had cut the wriggling heads in halves.
<br><br>
Zen and the Ear Mice felt more comfortable with their plan after seeing these Ghost-claw Worms. Zen had killed many along the way so it'd be an easy trail to follow back...
<br><br>
They followed the corpses, walking the wrong way on several occasions before they had finally found the original path they had taken here.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had come from a different bone cave and recorded a different path. Now they too, like Zen, were counting on Libby to lead the way.
<br><br>
Fortunately, although it was Libby's first time in the Sanskrit Light Stage, she was very smart and remembered the way to the Land of Bone Tribulation clearly.
<br><br>
"There are eight bone caves in the bone cavity. We should take the seventh one..."
<br><br>
"There are two roads here. We should take the left one..."
<br><br>
"The first bone cave..."
<br><br>
Under her guidance, they continued onward, slightly uphill.
<br><br>
Just as Fidel had said, they were in fact still in the sea formed by the Soul Interdicting Water. If they broke through a wall of a bone cave, the Soul Interdicting Water would gush in.
<br><br>
But many bones were in the water, looking like countless tubes.
<br><br>
The route the Ear Mice had taken had been submerged by the Soul Interdicting Water, but everything was fine for the one the human race had recorded in their documents, and they continued smoothly along the way.
<br><br>
The size of the Sanskrit Light Stage was no smaller than that of the Blooming Jade Stage. Zen and his companions climbed up the bone caves for four hours before they finally came to a huge bone cavity.
<br><br>
There were many bone caves of different sizes here. The largest was massive and the smallest was only as big as a fist.
<br><br>
Zen looked around and said, "It seems that all the bone caves are connected to this bone cavity?"
<br><br>
"Yes, this one is our Ear Mice's bone cave," said Fidel, pointing at a cave that was neither too big nor too small. "That is the bone cave of the Separate Abyss race... Eh?"
<br><br>
Fidel shrieked as it pointed at a wide bone cave. It was so large that even those of the Separate Abyss race could walk through it freely. This was indeed their bone cave. But there was something odd about it; a green light flashed at the entrance of the cave as if reflected by a mirror. It soon discovered that the entire cave had been filled with Soul Interdicting Water! "What's wrong?"
<br><br>
Zen and Libby had noticed Fidel's strange reaction immediately. They walked over to have a closer look and were both shocked at what they saw.
<br><br>
"Whose bone cave is this?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"The Separate Abyss race!" exclaimed Fidel.
<br><br>
"It seems that the Separate Abyss race have it much worse. Their cave is filled with the Soul Interdicting Water. I wonder if there's anyone trapped within it," Zen mused, shaking his head.
<br><br>
As Zen climbed higher up the stages of the Other Shore, the number of Souls of Light he could meet lowered. There was only the Land of Bone Tribulation on the huge Sanskrit Light Stage where warriors could explore.
<br><br>
A warrior like Libby, who had reached the Holy Soul Realm, would usually choose to pass through the Sanskrit Light Stage and go directly to Stage Thirty-two, the destination of the powerful Holy Souls.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
As they looked on, the Soul Interdicting Water had risen by a foot! When it eventually overflowed it would probably pour into the other bone caves around it.
<br><br>
"Let's go! The bone cave is full of Soul Interdicting Water. Who knows what monsters might burst from it," Libby urged standing aside.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement and looked up at the other end of the bone cavity.
<br><br>
"I wonder which bone cave leads to the Land of Bone Tribulation..."
<br><br>
There were many bone caves of various sizes around the huge cavity, but in the center were three bone caves that extended up diagonally. It was Zen's first time here but he understood enough to know that the exit of the Sanskrit Light Stage was among these three caves.
<br><br>
"Zen, Are you heading to the Land of Bone Tribulation?" Fidel asked excitedly.
<br><br>
Since ancient times, no one in the chaos had been able to enter the Land of Bone Tribulation.
<br><br>
Over the years, only a small number of Other Shore creatures had gone there, but no one in the chaos had the necessary qualifications to enter.
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
"We'll be taking the cave in the middle to go to Stage Thirty-two. To get to the Land of Bone Tribulation, you should go through the cave on the left."
<br><br>
Fidel said enviously, "If you succeed, you'll be the first to qualify to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting after ancient times!"
<br><br>
This was important news to the Ear Mice and when Fidel could leave the Other Shore, it would surely bring it to the superiors immediately.
<br><br>
Libby looked at Zen in silence. She knew the left bone cave led to the Land of Bone Tribulation, but because she couldn't go there herself, she knew little of it and could not offer Zen any advice.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at her and said, "Since you can't come with me and the Ear Mice are going to Stage Thirty-two, you should go with them."
<br><br>
"I... I'll wait for you here," said Libby.
<br><br>
"It's too dangerous here!" Fidel yelled in warning.
<br><br>
"Normally, you staying here wouldn't be a problem. But Fidel is right, the Soul Interdicting Water has begun flooding and who knows what followed the water in," Zen pointed out shaking his head as he spoke.
<br><br>
The Ghost-claw Worms alone were tough to deal with, not to mention there could be more than one kind of creature in the Soul Interdicting Water.
<br><br>
Libby considered this a while and decided Zen made a lot of sense and so she agreed.
<br><br>
Zen then jumped up straight to the first bone cave on the left and climbed up along the wall.
<br><br>
It was over ten thousand feet long and very wide. He could still hear the echo of his footsteps when he walked. When he was halfway up, a black fog appeared around the cave.
<br><br>
This gave him pause and he hesitated.
<br><br>
But then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who had been observing Zen this whole time, reminded him, "Don't worry. This black fog is only to scare off souls and can't harm a physical body."
<br><br>
Holy Souls were forbidden to step on this road, naturally there were some measures to stop them.
<br><br>
These words of comfort swept Zen's worries away and he continued climbing up.
<br><br>
He was almost at the top when a ray of light shone in front of him, lighting the dim cave.
<br><br>
"Does this bone cave lead outside?"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes glinted and he quickened his pace.
<br><br>
When he finally reached the top, he saw what it was like outside the bone cave...
<br><br>
He saw a boundless blue sea and slender bones in the water upside down, sticking out like bamboo growing in the sea. This was the forbidden area outside the bone caves that Libby had mentioned! Chapter 3769 Bone Slaves Once he was out of the bone cave, Zen saw a sprawling white beach in front of him.
<br><br>
He bent down to grab the white sand and watched it fall in between his fingers. "This sand is also bones. Were countless bones truly crushed and gathered here?"
<br><br>
"Ordinary crushed bones would have already been weathered. These bones were originally this small," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Zen lifted the sand on his palm and looked at it more carefully. As the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, these bones were indeed whole and were just incredibly small.
<br><br>
For such bones to be so small that they ended up covering an entire area and be mistaken for sand was both incredible and unsettling. "Are these from the tiny creatures of the Calculation Civilization?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The green figure on the Civilization Artifact shook its head. "It's not us.
<br><br>
We're even way smaller than these bones."
<br><br>
Too many civilizations and creatures had existed in the chaos.
<br><br>
Over a thousand races had once become ruling civilizations and those underneath them, were even more numerous. Of course, there would always be creatures bigger or smaller than others.
<br><br>
"If you walk a bit more, you'll come upon some new discoveries," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
Zen decided to walk further along the beach and, to his surprise, found the bones that littered the ground progressively get larger. At first, it had been the size of a grain of sand until it became the size of a pea, then the size of a fist...
<br><br>
This somehow reminded him of the Immemorial Wilderness save for the fact that the bones there were randomly placed. Here on the beach, the bones were arranged in a certain orderly manner.
<br><br>
As he ventured forward, Zen began to see more familiar bones, specifically, human bones! He bent down and picked up a random arm bone. "The bone beach records all creatures on the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven confirmed.
<br><br>
Zen turned the bone in his hand curiously. "What about the Regal Jade Civilization?" he asked.
<br><br>
Some civilizations had special forms and the Regal Jade Civilization was one of them since they did not have any bones.
<br><br>
"Look at the front left," the Regal Jade Spirit suddenly said, with a smile on his face.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit had also stepped into the Land of Bone Tribulation before, so he knew some things.
<br><br>
Zen did as he said. When he looked to the left, he saw various green fragments in between the bones. Beside these fragments were metal bones from the Metal Civilization.
<br><br>
"Entering the Soul City allows one's soul to complete a transformation while entering the Land of Bone Tribulation allows one's body to undergo change. The degree of transformation of soul and body directly determines the power you will obtain in the Eternal Scroll Painting," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.
<br><br>
Eternal Warriors at the Eternal Realm were the most powerful existence in this world.
<br><br>
However, the Eternal Scroll Painting also had a ranking system and the higher one's ranking was, the greater power one would obtain.
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows with interest. "The Eternal Scroll Painting?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "Yes. You've gotten nine Holy Soul Imprints..." he began. "You are the number-one person in history and just by relying on these nine Holy Soul Imprints, your ranking in the Eternal Scroll Painting won't be low. However, if you can obtain nine Bone Tribulation Imprints, then your ranking could naturally go higher!"
<br><br>
In fact, the Primeval Lord of Heaven already spoke to the elites of the human race about this. All of them had high expectations for Zen.
<br><br>
"The more imprints, the higher the ranking?" Zen surmised. It hadn't been that hard to figure out.
<br><br>
"Most cases go like that though there are exceptions," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. "My junior fellow disciple obtained sixteen imprints but the ranking he received hadn't been ideal. The one who ranked first only had fourteen imprints."
<br><br>
More imprints meant a bigger advantage in the Eternal Scroll Painting but it wasn't the end-all and be-all of everything. There were always creatures with astonishing willpower that could create miracles and defeat those far stronger than them.
<br><br>
This piqued Zen's interest. "Then, who is it?" he asked.
<br><br>
A trace of caution appeared on the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face. "It's the Eye Spirit of the Element Spirit race."
<br><br>
There weren't many creatures that could make the Primeval Lord of Heaven so cautious but the Eye Spirit was one of them.
<br><br>
"Eye Spirit..." Zen repeated. "Is it the strongest warrior of the Element Spirit race?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded grimly.
<br><br>
"Yes."
<br><br>
That was the only answer Zen needed and he stopped asking about the subject.
<br><br>
After passing through the Land of Bone Tribulation, he would enter Stage Thirty-two and then get into the Eternal Scroll Painting. Now though, he had to focus on getting through this beach of bones first.
<br><br>
After he passed by the human bones, the following bones all got bigger and bigger. Now, there were bones several dozen feet, further on they would get bigger until they were several hundred feet, and so on! Only a small part of these huge bones floated above the sea, leaving the rest under the waters.
<br><br>
Not long after, Zen finally arrived at the edge of the beach. Any further and he would be in the ocean of Soul Interdicting Water.
<br><br>
"It's the end. Where is the Land of Bone Tribulation?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Wait. There should be bone slaves coming," the Primeval Lord of Heaven told him.
<br><br>
Zen did as he was told and took a seat on one of the huge bones to wait. In the distance, dark green flames suddenly blazed to life.
<br><br>
'Ghost fire?' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
The cemetery was a place to bury bones and phosphorescent flames frequently rose due to the sheer amount of remains buried there. It was just a bit surprising that there would be flames that burned, though it was the daytime here.
<br><br>
As the flames rose, they floated towards the skulls that then gained sentience and began to look for the rest of their bodies.
<br><br>
Spine, shoulder blade, ribs...
<br><br>
A short while later, fully-formed and assembled human skeletons began to walk towards Zen.
<br><br>
"Are they the bone slaves you were talking about earlier?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded with a smile. "Yes. Every race will have their own bone slaves."
<br><br>
Zen nodded in understanding but a question suddenly popped in his head.
<br><br>
"What if a certain race enters this place for the first time?"
<br><br>
"Before they enter, the bones of their race will have been created and placed here," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained patiently.
<br><br>
There were some special powers on the Other Shore. It should also be noted that the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation were constructed by the Instant Civilization and were thus naturally different from other places.
<br><br>
Zen raised yet another question. "These bones... they were created out of nowhere then?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled, associating Zen's question with the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. "It is indeed possible!"
<br><br>
Ziya discovered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction outside the chaos, which meant the Instant Civilization also came from there.
<br><br>
The reanimated skeletons came straight to Zen and the first skeleton that passed him by flipped a slightly larger bone. Zen watched as the bone landed on the surface of the Soul Interdicting Water and transformed itself into a boat.
<br><br>
"Please get on," the skeleton said in a strange voice and gestured invitingly towards the boat.
<br><br>
A trace of vigilance appeared on Zen's face as he asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven's opinion in his mind.
<br><br>
"If you want to go to the Land of Bone Tribulation, then you naturally have to board this boat," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, assuring Zen and comforting his nerves.
<br><br>
With no more reservations, Zen jumped and landed in the middle of the boat.
<br><br>
The other skeletons quickly got to work, scouring the ground for bones to be used as paddles and also getting on the boat.
<br><br>
Chapter 3770 Bone Island The white bone boat floated on the blue ocean.
<br><br>
It was rowed manually by the bone slaves, so it did not move too fast.
<br><br>
Zen possessed the ability to fly and could do so across the ocean, or even help the bone slaves speed up if he wished.
<br><br>
But the Primeval Lord of Heaven warned him not to break the rules of the Land of Bone Tribulation. They had entered the land in this way before. As per the advice he was given, Zen just watched on as the bone slaves paddled the boat forward slowly.
<br><br>
Their intelligence was at the most basic level, and although they were able to communicate smoothly with Zen, they seemed to know very little. When he asked of theirs and the Land of Bone Tribulation's origin, all they offered was dull, stiff answers.
<br><br>
After asking a few more questions, Zen gave up this pursuit with them.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Splash...
<br><br>
The boat continued on slowly, bypassing bones jutting out of the sea one by one, before Zen finally caught sight of a white island.
<br><br>
The island was made of thick bones piling up together and in the center was a huge skull, but Zen didn't know what creature it belonged to.
<br><br>
"Is this the Land of Bone Tribulation?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," a bone slave nodded.
<br><br>
As the boat slowly approached the shore, Zen leaped casually into the air and landed on the island.
<br><br>
He stood firm when suddenly, a handful of sea water splashed at his head! Being on the Other Shore for so long, Zen was very alert to Soul Interdicting Water and the like. The thunder wings on his back exploded violently as his body turned away, barely avoiding the Soul Interdicting Water! He stabilized in midair and now saw clearly that there were more than a dozen creatures on both sides of the island! They were of many different shapes and sizes; some were tiny, some were as big and burly as giants. But it was obvious they were Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
"Hasn't it been a long time since anyone entered the Land of Bone Tribulation?" Zen asked in confusion.
<br><br>
He thought he was the only one here. Seeing so many Other Shore creatures appear all of a sudden was certainly unexpected.
<br><br>
"Creatures in the chaos can't enter the Land of Bone Tribulation, but the Other Shore creatures can," the Primeval Lord of Heaven revealed to Zen.
<br><br>
As long as they were not stage rulers who were bound to a certain stage, the creatures of the Other Shore were also capable of becoming stronger, gaining the Holy Soul, receiving the training in the Land of Bone Tribulation and entering the Eternal Scroll Painting to get to Stage Thirtythree.
<br><br>
"It's that human brat!"
<br><br>
"Human, don't you know the rules? Those from outside the Other Shore must be tainted with the Soul Interdicting Water before they can land!"
<br><br>
"Yes, it's a rule. We'll let you down after you bath in the Soul Interdicting Water!"
<br><br>
The Land of Bone Tribulation was more difficult to pass through and would take more time than the Soul City.
<br><br>
These Other Shore creatures had been here a long time and had become familiar with each other. Ganging up against outsiders was easy for them.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Zen was quite clearly an outsider.
<br><br>
"Rules? Who made these rules?" Zen asked narrowing his eyes slightly.
<br><br>
"No one made them, this has always been the way in the Land of Bone Tribulation," explained an Other Shore creature.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha," Zen laughed coldly. "No one in the chaos has been able to enter here after ancient times, and still, after so long, this rule has not been abolished? Or is it that you made it up just now?"
<br><br>
The Soul Interdicting Water only had an effect on the creatures outside the Other Shore. This rule was clearly intended for the creatures in chaos. But it had been quite a long time since any of them stepped into this land.
<br><br>
Why did the rule come back just as Zen had appeared? This must be the doing of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Zen's question left the Other Shore creatures speechless.
<br><br>
"The only reason why you sprayed the Soul Interdicting Water on me is to prevent me from escaping, am I right?" he asked, slowly descending as the Other Shore Power within the Civilization Artifact surged crazily in his inner world.
<br><br>
Splash! The Other Shore Power erupted and sent his body smashing down towards the island like a meteorite falling from the sky.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures had intended to surround Zen, but when they felt the speed at which he had fallen, they all wore stunned expressions and rushed backwards.
<br><br>
Boom! Zen slammed into the island.
<br><br>
Under the immense power, the entire island began shaking violently and spreading mini tsunamis out over the surrounding sea.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the ground in surprise. It too was made of bones, but they were tough far beyond his expectations. There wasn't even a hint of damage to them from his impact! He might not have shattered the bones, but instead shattered the confidence of the Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
It seemed it was as Zen had guessed; they had indeed received news that a creature from the chaos was on his way and if they captured him, their races would be rewarded handsomely.
<br><br>
They had expected the creature from the chaos would be weak and an easy capture if they took advantage of the Soul Interdicting Water, as long as he was off guard. They certainly had not expected him to possess such incredible strength.
<br><br>
They were stunned silent and lowered their heads like children being reprimanded by their parents.
<br><br>
After all, they were not creatures from the chaos and could not leave the Other Shore. Surrendering was their best option when faced with a far stronger warrior.
<br><br>
"Does anyone else want to sprinkle the Soul Interdicting Water on me?"
<br><br>
Zen asked menacingly as he scanned the creatures around.
<br><br>
No one answered. They just looked at Zen with reverence.
<br><br>
Zen walked towards a burly creature. He had the head of a bull and a pair of sharp horns. He was from the Sturdy Bull race residing in Stage Twentyseven. Seeing Zen heading straight for him, the Sturdy Bull quickly explained in a panic, "He told us the news. He came here and told us that if we attacked you, the Element Spirit race would reward us, which would benefit our race!"
<br><br>
The Sturdy Bull pointed at a cat-like creature not far off.
<br><br>
The cat-like creature took two steps back when he was pointed out. His eyes narrowed and gazed dangerously, ready to deal with Zen's attack at any moment.
<br><br>
But Zen just glanced at him indifferently and said, "I came here to pass the Land of Bone Tribulation. As for the grudge between me and the Element Spirit race, you'd better stay out of it!"
<br><br>
These Other Shore creatures were also outstanding warriors of their different races. They had thought Zen was a weak lamb they could bully, and naturally they wanted to rush forward to capture him.
<br><br>
But Zen displayed such great power that they decided it was better to not risk their lives! "Yes, yes. I'm not a member of the Element Spirit race," the Sturdy Bull nodded.
<br><br>
They immediately let out a sigh of relief and all the tension in the atmosphere relaxed when Zen showed restrained hostility.
<br><br>
Zen looked into the depths of the island and asked, "Has the Land of Bone Tribulation opened yet?"
<br><br>
On the bone boat, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had told him the basics rules of the Land of Bone Tribulation.
<br><br>
Like the Soul City, the Land of Bone Tribulation also opened for a period of time and then closed for another period of time. But the periods were much longer than that of the Soul City.
<br><br>
Chapter 3771 Myriad Tribulations Storm The skull that occupied three fourths of the island was in fact the entrance to the Land of Bone Tribulation.
<br><br>
"The Land of Bone Tribulation opens every eight hundred hours. Six hundred and forty hours have now passed," the Sturdy Bull replied.
<br><br>
"So it will open in seven days?" asked Zen.
<br><br>
"Yes!" The Sturdy Bull answered.
<br><br>
Seven days...
<br><br>
Zen pondered this a while and decided not to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
These Other Shore creatures were not reliable. If he left, there was no guarantee they wouldn't set up arrays and wait for an opportunity to strike at him...
<br><br>
He sat down cross-legged facing the skull, dead still in meditation, waiting for its opening.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures stood behind him, sizing him up silently. They didn't want to provoke him anymore and so waited with him.
<br><br>
Seven days passed by quickly.
<br><br>
Once it had been eight hundred hours, the huge skull trembled and began rising slowly.
<br><br>
Zen sensed the change and opened his eyes, staring intently at the rising skull before him.
<br><br>
He now realized it was a complete skull but the lower end of it had been buried in the island before.
<br><br>
As it continued to rise, more and more was revealed and a cervical spine now became visible; it turned out to be a complete skeleton! Crack! Crack! Crack! Once the skull had risen a fair bit, a strange sound echoed from between its jaws. Its mouth slowly opened, releasing, incredibly, a pathway.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures itched to give it a go. When the Land of Bone Tribulation had opened before, they would swarm in.
<br><br>
But this time, as Zen stood at the front, none of them dared to move first.
<br><br>
Zen walked without hesitation, straight into the large mouth of the skull.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures followed in as soon as he entered.
<br><br>
Inside the skull were stairs made of thin bones. After walking down the bone stairs, they returned to the bottom of the sea. Then another wondrous scene was revealed to them.
<br><br>
The Soul Interdicting Water with dark blue light was blocked by an invisible force, forming isolation walls.
<br><br>
In the center were many floating white bone plates.
<br><br>
This was Zen's first time entering, so he stood on the stairs and looked at the bone plates carefully.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures behind him dared not to force him further, so all they could do was wait silently. Zen watched the plates for a full five minutes before they could not wait any longer. After all, time was precious when the Land of Bone Tribulation opened.
<br><br>
"Human friend, you should sit on the white bone plate first to enter the Land of Bone Tribulation," the Sturdy Bull said from behind.
<br><br>
Zen smiled faintly, sensing the angst among these creatures. He jumped down from the stairs and landed on one of the bone plates.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The moment he set foot on it, the bone plate carried him to the side.
<br><br>
The other creatures jumped onto the bone plates too and sat down, also retreating to the side.
<br><br>
Once they all sat on bone plates, identical bone plates appeared on the opposite side with skeletons placed on them.
<br><br>
On the plate opposite to the Sturdy Bull, was a huge skeleton similar to him.
<br><br>
On the plate opposite to Zen, was a human skeleton, the same size as he was, making the same moves he did.
<br><br>
Zen raised his hand and so did the opposing skeleton.
<br><br>
Zen turned his head, and so did the skeleton...
<br><br>
It seemed to be a mirror image, but with no flesh and blood-it was just a pale white human skeleton.
<br><br>
"Is this my tribulation skeleton?" Zen asked, staring at the skeleton.
<br><br>
In the Land of Bone Tribulation, everyone had their own corresponding tribulation skeletons. When they accepted the test of the land, their tribulation skeletons would in turn undergo a significant change.
<br><br>
Zen's tribulation skeleton had just been born when he had entered, so it was as white as white jade.
<br><br>
But the huge tribulation skeleton corresponding to the Sturdy Bull was covered with a faint layer of golden glaze. He had been here for a long time and clearly had gained a lot.
<br><br>
However, this was all gained for the tribulation skeleton. Before it merged with him, he had gained nothing on his own body.
<br><br>
Although these creatures had been here a long time, they still did not possess the ability to compete with Zen! "Your tribulation skeleton is too new," the Sturdy Bull said with a trace of pride. He looked at his own tribulation skeleton, which shone with golden light, with love glinting in his eyes. He finally had something to be proud of in front of Zen The other creatures shared the same sentiment. They didn't know what Zen had done to obtain control of that amazing power, but what did that matter? Here, he was still a newcomer! Once they obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body, their strength would still be able to surpass Zen's! Zen's eyes flashed with mockery as he asked, "How long have you cultivated here?"
<br><br>
"I've been here only seven years. I've reached this level quite fast actually!"
<br><br>
the Sturdy Bull admitted confidently.
<br><br>
"Yes. Brice is quite talented, mainly because he has a divine body which is stronger than other creatures' from the moment he was born," said an Other Shore creature. He then pointed to a centipede-shaped creature close by.
<br><br>
"That long insect there is even stranger. He has cultivated a unique body refining method. In just a year, he has already entered the sixteenth layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm!"
<br><br>
The surface of that centipede's tribulation skeleton shone with golden light as well. It was almost a Myriad Tribulations Body! The centipede had been silent this whole time, lying motionless on his own bone plate. He was focused solely on cultivating the Myriad Tribulations Body and had no interest whatsoever in other matters. Even when the Element Spirit race had sent a message to attack Zen, he paid it no mind.
<br><br>
As they spoke, an intense pressure overtook the entire space, suddenly expanding and contracting along with the violent rising and falling of the surrounding sea water. A storm had formed in the center! The storm rose and swept out the Soul Interdicting Water from the surrounding "walls".
<br><br>
Drops of Soul Interdicting Water gathered in the center of the storm.
<br><br>
Zen was inevitably hit by the Soul Interdicting Water as he sat on the bone plate.
<br><br>
He tried to dodge, but the Soul Interdicting Water was too dense. He was hit and then gave up trying to dodge it. He had accepted that he was unable to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Buzz! The Soul Interdicting Water was completely submerged in the rising storm, forming a larger blue storm.
<br><br>
'Is this the Myriad Tribulations Storm?' Frowning, Zen looked at the scene unfolding in front of him. At the same time, he felt confused as to whether he should refine his body with the Soul Interdicting Water.
<br><br>
When he was still at a loss for what his next move should be, streaks of golden liquid suddenly rose from the bottom of the storm.
<br><br>
Feeling the aura of the golden liquid shrank his pupils. Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven who was observing in his inner world seemed to remember something, which changed his face in an instant! Chapter 3772 The Tearing Force The golden liquid's aura was quite similar to that of the Descending Rings.
<br><br>
Not long ago, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess from the Source World personally asked Zen for the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits. When they were used together with the Descending Rings, they could directly summon anything from the Other Shore down to the chaos. It was a way equivalent to breaking the restrictions of truth! In fact, the Primeval Lord of Heaven also knew that there would be a bluegolden storm in the Land of Bone Tribulation.
<br><br>
The blue was the Soul Interdicting Water, but so far, no one knew what the golden liquid was.
<br><br>
However, it had been a long time since the Primeval Lord of Heaven was in the Land of Bone Tribulation, and he had long forgotten about the aura of this golden liquid.
<br><br>
That was why he couldn't connect them to the Land of Bone Tribulation at all when he saw Zen's golden red Chaotic Source Spirits before.
<br><br>
But now that Zen had entered the Land of Bone Tribulation, he and Zen naturally realized immediately what the golden liquid might be. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, why is this golden liquid's aura in this storm the same as the aura of the Descending Rings?" asked Zen.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was lost in thought. There was a somewhat strange connection between the two.
<br><br>
The Myriad Tribulations Storm was a great test for warriors who entered it for training, and only those strong-willed enough could pass it.
<br><br>
The mixture of the golden liquid and the Soul Interdicting Water could cause a violent stab of pain to anyone it hit.
<br><br>
It was so painful that even the Primeval Lord of Heaven still clearly remembered how it felt when he experienced it over a thousand chaotic eras ago. "If the golden liquid is the same type of thing as the Descending Rings, then it is used to summon things from the Other Shore, while the Soul Interdicting Water works to prevent anything from descending..." Zen analyzed.
<br><br>
Upon hearing Zen's words, the Primeval Lord of Heaven broke free from his train of thought. He suddenly perked up and said, "I got it. It turns out that the Land of Bone Tribulation is so ingeniously designed.
<br><br>
The Instant Civilization was smart to make use of the geographical advantages..." "What geographical advantages?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"As you said, the Soul Interdicting Water prevents things from descending while the golden liquid works the same as the Descending Ring, which is used to summon things down. Their functions contrast each other. If they appear at the same time, then the Myriad Tribulations Storm, which could tear almost everything apart, is formed," the Primeval Lord of Heaven theorized.
<br><br>
Back then, he couldn't figure out why the mixture of the Soul Interdicting Water and the golden liquid could have such an effect.
<br><br>
Now, he seemed to have completely understood it.
<br><br>
The two types of liquid within the storm were like two hands: one hand extended to the Other Shore, while the other extended outside the Other Shore. Naturally, a powerful tearing force was produced.
<br><br>
"I'll go in first!" the centipede declared before he and his bone plate entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm in the center.
<br><br>
At the same time, the tribulation skeleton on his opposite side followed suit.
<br><br>
It entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm from the other side of the storm! "Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
Countless drops of blue and gold mixed together and floated inside the Myriad Tribulations Storm. When the droplets hit a body, they exploded and produced numerous strange black cracks. The cracks expanded, then released a powerful tearing force.
<br><br>
If the droplets hit a body that wasn't cultivated to perfection, then it would be quickly torn apart! As the centipede continued to advance, the tribulation skeleton on his opposite side also moved towards the center of the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
The small water drops in the outermost layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm were very small and sparsely scattered. About ten feet deeper inside, however, the small water drops grew bigger and became denser. When viewed from the outside, there was a layer of water drops every ten feet— and there was a total of twenty layers from the outermost part to the center of the storm! After the centipede was thirty feet deep into the Myriad Tribulations Storm, small rings suddenly appeared on the surface of his body. The rings were tightly locked together and increased the centipede's physical strength.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
In turn, the rings blocked all the black cracks the small water drops made on his body.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, his tribulation skeleton on the other side experienced the same as well. As a result, the tribulation skeleton glowed a golden light after the storm repeatedly hit his body.
<br><br>
The water drops at the outermost layer did not affect the tribulation skeleton at all, so the centipede had no choice but to go deeper into the storm every time the Land of Bone Tribulation opened.
<br><br>
As he moved forward with ease, he abruptly stopped in the sixteenth layer and remained motionless right after. His tribulation skeleton also stopped in the sixteenth layer on the other side.
<br><br>
Of course, all the Other Shore creatures who saw the centipede move so quickly sported envious looks.
<br><br>
"It seemed that he can easily withstand sixteen layers of the Myriad Tribulations Storm with the help of the tribulation skeleton…"
<br><br>
"I don't know when I can reach the same level!"
<br><br>
"My tribulation skeleton has just entered the third layer..."
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures began to discuss among themselves as they drove their bone plates forward and entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, one's tribulation skeleton became stronger after they entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm. It also affected their real bodies' strength, so it meant that they could advance further after that process.
<br><br>
But after one got out of the Myriad Tribulations Storm their tribulation skeletons and their real bodies were no longer connected. Only after they had truly obtained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies would their tribulation skeletons and their real bodies finally merge.
<br><br>
Once all the Other Shore creatures had entered, Zen also took control of his bone plate and entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
"Da!"
<br><br>
A blue-golden drop of water hit his right arm first and burst into a black crack. His body slightly trembled.
<br><br>
Indeed, the tearing force from that small water drop was powerful! Fortunately, he had absorbed a large amount of Body-strengthening Jades and his physical body had reached its limit, so he was strong enough to take it. Furthermore, he wasn't afraid of anything because he had the Chaotic Source Spirits to protect his body. Thus, he simply continued to drive the bone plate forward.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Other Shore creatures in the Myriad Tribulations Storm all looked at him.
<br><br>
As for them, they all activated their body protecting theurgies to defend against the water droplets. Some of them used illusory shield shadows that surrounded their bodies, while some others' bodies glowed with a golden light. While all of them changed in some way, there were no changes in Zen's body at all.
<br><br>
"Did that guy just withstand the water drops with his physical body?"
<br><br>
"Will he really go to the second layer the first time he has entered the storm? He's so aggressive!"
<br><br>
"Just wait and see, he'll surely suffer!"
<br><br>
It was known that the water drops were immensely powerful despite their size. It was likely for one to lose their life if they weren't careful in the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
Some of the Other Shore creatures even began to think that if Zen was seriously injured, they wouldn't mind killing him. They became more excited now that the Soul Interdicting Water had tainted Zen, since he would have no way to escape! But just as the crowd thought, Zen had already driven the bone plate thirty feet forward and stepped into the third layer.
<br><br>
On the other side, his tribulation skeleton also sat upright on the bone plate.
<br><br>
The water droplets continuously hit it, but there were only faint golden marks on its surface.
<br><br>
"Even though these small water drops have a strong tearing force, it cannot affect my body on a large scale. Warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm are best at resisting such attacks," Zen said in a low voice.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits feared bearing too much power at once the most. However, the constant tearing of the water droplets hardly exhausted them.
<br><br>
Zen looked ahead and the corner of his mouth slightly curled up. Then, he did something that surprised everyone around him.
<br><br>
He leaned forward a little, then the bone plate quickly moved forward. In the blink of an eye, he was already a hundred feet into the storm and had landed at the side of the warrior from the Sturdy Bull race! Chapter 3773 Too Slow The member of the Sturdy Bull race still focused on resisting the water drops. His muscles flashed with a bronze glow.
<br><br>
Every time he activated his bloodline theurgy, his blood vitality became more potent and greatly increased the toughness of his physical body.
<br><br>
"I need to hold on for six hours!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
As long as he stayed within the tenth layer for six full hours, his tribulation skeleton would surely grow stronger.
<br><br>
However, to do so was a huge challenge. After all, to continuously activate the bloodline power consumed a lot of his strength.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the current round of Myriad Tribulations Storm had just started. He was still full of energy, so the task was a piece of cake.
<br><br>
Just as he sat down and turned around to check how the human newcomer was doing, he suddenly realized that Zen was already at the spot beside him.
<br><br>
His eyes widened to the size of saucers. He stared blankly at Zen for a long while before he came back to his senses.
<br><br>
"How is this possible?"
<br><br>
He was so shocked as if he had seen a monster and not a human. He couldn't figure out how Zen had reached the spot beside him in such a short period! They were already a hundred feet into the Myriad Tribulations Storm at that point, and the water drops in the tenth layer were far more powerful. It was simply impossible, even if one's physical body had absorbed enough Bodystrengthening Jades and had cultivated to its limit! What made it more surprising was that it was Zen's first time to experience such a trial, and his tribulation skeleton hardly even bore any damages! With a steady drip, the water drops kept hitting Zen's body.
<br><br>
Black cracks spread all over his skin, but it looked like he wasn't in pain at all.
<br><br>
Opposite him on the other side of the Myriad Tribulations Storm, the water droplets had quickly tempered his tribulation skeleton.
<br><br>
The closer they got to the center of the storm, the faster the tribulation skeleton would be refined.
<br><br>
The refinement speed at the tenth layer was a hundred times faster than that in the outermost layer! As the small drops of water poured continuously onto Zen's tribulation skeleton, its golden color became increasingly clear.
<br><br>
"This is..."
<br><br>
Then, it glowed brighter while he felt his body become solid and stable as if an invisible power had enhanced it.
<br><br>
"Is this feeling from my tribulation skeleton?" Zen muttered with raised brows. Of course, he was a bit surprised.
<br><br>
He was different from the Other Shore races, like the Sturdy Bull race.
<br><br>
After all, he could withstand the Myriad Tribulations Storm with merely the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
In fact, had it been ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warriors, it wouldn't be long before the water droplets had exhausted their Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Thanks to the special Truth of Godly Way Zen had obtained, his Chaotic Source Spirits recovered quickly after an attack.
<br><br>
That was why he could easily survive in the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
"You, you... How did you resist the water drops?" the Sturdy Bull couldn't help but ask curiously.
<br><br>
"With my physical body, of course," replied Zen.
<br><br>
The Sturdy Bull's face twitched as he was rendered speechless.
<br><br>
The Sturdy Bull race was an Other Shore race that only appeared in recent chaotic eras. They didn't know much about the human race, and most of their curiosity came from the sudden increase of human Souls of Light on the Other Shore in later years.
<br><br>
However, they still didn't take the human Souls of Light at the Holy Soul Realm seriously. After all, even though the Holy Souls were strong enough to fight against the Other Shore creatures, the Other Shore creatures could still become much stronger if they cultivated a Myriad Tribulations Body.
<br><br>
However, contrary to the rumors, not only did Zen have a physical form, he also had too much power that was beyond what the Sturdy Bull had imagined! While the member of the Sturdy Bull race was still in shock, Zen suddenly asked, "It seems that the refinement speed in the tenth layer isn't fast. How long will it take to achieve the same level of your tribulation skeleton?"
<br><br>
Zen's dissatisfaction at the refining speed in the tenth layer stunned the Sturdy Bull once again. He remained quiet for a while before he said, "It will take you at least a couple of months. Every time the Land of Bone Tribulation opened, I held on for five hours in the tenth layer. I have spent about a total of three months here already!"
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the time between the openings of the Land of Bone Tribulation was very long. Even if the Sturdy Bull activated his bloodline power to its limit, he could only hold on for five hours to six hours at most.
<br><br>
However, he still stayed in the eighth or ninth layer to refine his tribulation skeleton even after he had already exhausted his bloodline power. He didn't leave until the Land of Bone Tribulation was closed.
<br><br>
"Three months... That's too much time for me!" Zen said and shook his head.
<br><br>
After that, he suddenly drove the bone plate beneath his feet forward.
<br><br>
It turned out that he directly crossed the tenth layer and entered the eleventh layer! The water drops in the eleventh layer were much more violent, and the black cracks that appeared on Zen's skin grew wider. His Chaotic Source Spirits became twice as exhausted, but the refining speed of the tribulation skeleton also increased several times! The member of the Sturdy Bull race clearly knew the benefits of entering the eleventh layer. Once one was strong enough to withstand the water droplets in the eleventh layer, their cultivation speed would greatly increase.
<br><br>
However, it was already hard for him to stay in the tenth layer for six hours due to his current strength. He wondered if he could hold on for even five minutes in the eleventh layer.
<br><br>
In the end, he decided not to enter the eleventh layer before his tribulation skeleton reached a higher level.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen barely spent time in the tenth layer before he advanced further into the eleventh layer. Was his body strong enough to withstand the water drops' rapidly increasing power? "Easy does it, my friend. The difficulty of the eleventh layer is..." Before the member of the Sturdy Bull race could finish his warning, Zen had arrived steadily at the eleventh layer.
<br><br>
He looked back at the member of the Sturdy Bull race and said, "Sorry.
<br><br>
What was that you said?"
<br><br>
"It's nothing... Never mind." The Sturdy Bull waved his hands and smiled awkwardly. He realized that his worries were completely unnecessary.
<br><br>
The tribulation skeleton's refining speed in the eleventh layer increased greatly, and at the same time, the pressure Zen felt also intensified by several degrees. Even so, the exhaustion of the Chaotic Source Spirits was still within his control.
<br><br>
At that moment, all the remaining Other Shore creatures in the Myriad Tribulations Storm observed Zen and started to discuss among themselves.
<br><br>
"How is this possible?"
<br><br>
"Even if he cultivates some special theurgy, he won't be able to hold on for long, right?"
<br><br>
"You should know that his tribulation skeleton hasn't grown so strong to protect his body!"
<br><br>
Even the centipede that fully concentrated on his cultivation in the sixteenth layer turned his head, his eyes filled with bewilderment and uncertainty.
<br><br>
The centipede had reached his current level through step-by-step improvement.
<br><br>
His physical body was already strong enough to bear the water drops in the outer layers, so his tribulation skeleton could grow stronger much faster. In turn, his enhanced tribulation skeleton served as additional protection as he advanced further.
<br><br>
However, Zen had rushed into the eleventh layer even though he hardly spent time in the outer layers. His tribulation skeleton was barely refined, so it couldn't support him at all.
<br><br>
If the centipede stayed in the eleventh layer without the protection of the tribulation skeleton, he wouldn't be able to withstand the water drops! Most of the Other Shore creatures who bet that Zen wouldn't be able to stay long in the eleventh layer were indeed right. It had only been five minutes since he had arrived there, but he already felt dissatisfied with the refining speed in the eleventh layer.
<br><br>
Chapter 3774 Sudden Change With everyone looking on, Zen drove the bone plate forward once more.
<br><br>
He passed the twelfth layer.
<br><br>
The thirteenth layer...
<br><br>
The fourteenth layer...
<br><br>
The fifteenth layer...
<br><br>
The sixteenth layer...
<br><br>
He moved inwards for a hundred and sixty feet and finally arrived beside the centipede-like creature.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! The small water drops within the sixteenth layer rained down hard on Zen like a violent storm.
<br><br>
His whole body was wrapped in the black cracks that tore wildly at his body.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits in his body continued to absorb the battering he took, but they dimmed fast at the same time.
<br><br>
As the Chaotic Source Spirits dimmed, the Truth of Godly Way continued to gush out. The warm current was like the water of an oasis in a desert, nourishing everything it flowed over.
<br><br>
Before the Chaotic Source Spirits fell into absolute fatigue, the Truth of Godly Way had already restored them.
<br><br>
'I'll stay here!' Zen thought to himself, assessing the situation.
<br><br>
This was a point of perfect balance for him.
<br><br>
If he continued onward, his Chaotic Source Spirits might not be able to withstand the force. Once they were fatigued, Zen would not be able to hold on much longer.
<br><br>
And on the sixteenth layer, he could not only refine his tribulation skeleton quickly, but he could also cultivate the Chaotic Source Spirits at the same time! Crack! Crack! Crack! Countless small drops of water fell on the surface of his tribulation skeleton, and wisps of golden light swiftly covered it.
<br><br>
Passing the trial of the Land of Bone Tribulation usually took a long time because the tribulation skeleton would only begin refining on the outermost layer. But as the refining effect was so unsatisfactory on the outer layers, it would take a long time surely to complete the trial.
<br><br>
In fact, from the sixteenth layer onward, the speed of refining would increase greatly! "He... What the hell is he?"
<br><br>
"He went straight to the sixteenth layer!"
<br><br>
"If I were there, I'm afraid those little water drops would tear me apart!"
<br><br>
They had just been thinking Zen wouldn't last long on the eleventh layer, yet now he stood steadily on the sixteenth layer. Getting there would take most of them a great deal of time but he did it in an instant! His speed stunned the Other Shore creatures to their core...
<br><br>
"Is this real?"
<br><br>
"How ridiculous!"
<br><br>
"I finally understand why the Element Spirit race wants him dealt with!"
<br><br>
Such rapid growth would pose a terrible threat to anyone.
<br><br>
When the centipede stared at Zen, the rings on his body began to crack! His cultivation method relied on his extremely powerful belief.
<br><br>
The stronger his confidence was in himself, the stronger the protection power of the rings would be! With the help of this theurgy, the centipede, like Zen, had also crossed the first six layers in an instant and entered directly into the seventh layer for cultivation. His speed was clearly far beyond the others.
<br><br>
This gave him massive confidence, making him feel as though he was the most talented there was. Thus, the power of his rings was greatly increased.
<br><br>
Soon, after his tribulation skeleton grew stronger, he would be able to enter the seventeenth layer! If he then passed another three layers, he would be able to obtain the Myriad Tribulations Body. Imagining how powerful he would become once he fused with his tribulation skeleton excited him a whole lot.
<br><br>
The centipede was silent not because this was his personality, but because he felt that he was special and decided not to communicate with the others.
<br><br>
It was true the others that entered the Land of Bone Tribulation were also outstanding in their respective races, but he was still above them.
<br><br>
Now however, Zen had brutally shattered his stable and confident state of mind.
<br><br>
It was his first time in the Land of Bone Tribulation, and yet here he was, on the same layer as he was! Such a talent was unheard of! The centipede cried out in his heart continuously.
<br><br>
No matter how hard he tried to deny this, even closing his eyes again and again in the hope it wasn't real, Zen was still sitting steadily beside him.
<br><br>
The undeniable fact that he was not the greatest ever began to discourage the centipede. His cultivation method had its flaw and cracks began appearing on the rings.
<br><br>
Seeing that his theurgy was no longer able to help him resist the small water drops of the sixteenth layer, he had no choice but to retreat back ten feet and enter the fifteenth layer.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! But even the water drops of the fifteenth layer still tore his rings and forced him to continue his retreat.
<br><br>
On the fourteenth layer, he retreated again...
<br><br>
On the thirteenth layer, he retreated again...
<br><br>
On the twelfth layer, he retreated again...
<br><br>
He finally stopped on the eleventh layer, only ten feet away from the Sturdy Bull.
<br><br>
The centipede's downfall attracted the whispers of the other creatures.
<br><br>
They had cultivated together for so long and knew what kind of theurgy they each used.
<br><br>
They also knew that the centipede's body protection theurgy was connected to his state of mind. It seemed that Zen's performance had dealt a heavy blow to the centipede.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen didn't know he had unwittingly made the centipede retreat again and again.
<br><br>
After maintaining balance, Zen also calmed down and sat upright on the bone plate to be baptized by small drops of water.
<br><br>
One day passed.
<br><br>
Two days passed.
<br><br>
Three days passed...
<br><br>
In the Myriad Tribulations Storm, all that could be heard was the patter of the small drops of water that smashed onto everyone's body.
<br><br>
Occasionally, when the Other Shore creatures couldn't bear it, they would retreat ten feet. If they felt that their condition had improved, they would advance back ten feet.
<br><br>
When the centipede was on the eleventh layer, he did a lot of self-reflection and after calming down, he advanced twenty feet and entered the thirteenth layer once more.
<br><br>
Ten days passed...
<br><br>
Twenty days passed...
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's body had experienced an unprecedented torture.
<br><br>
At the same time being repaired by the Truth of Godly Way, the Chaotic Source Spirits didn't take a break...
<br><br>
Zen had often performed this kind of oppression after he came out of the Chaotic Source World. It was thanks to this method he was able to step into the later stage of the Chaotic Source Realm in such a short period of time! However, after staying in the Myriad Tribulations Storm for twenty-eight days, his Chaotic Source Spirits finally encountered some issues.
<br><br>
They had integrated into his body and suddenly disappeared and changed into another form. This process caused them to no longer absorb energy for him! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! When the tiny water drops struck the surface of his body, it immediately caused a terribly intense pain! "What's going on?"
<br><br>
The pain had shocked Zen.
<br><br>
He had no choice but to protect his head with both hands and drive the bone plate to retreat.
<br><br>
His body had originally been as sturdy as a weapon. Moreover, in the past nearly a month, the tribulation skeleton had been greatly enhanced to protect him.
<br><br>
If not for this, the moment the Chaotic Source Spirits disappeared, the black cracks that the small water drops created would have torn him to pieces! After retreating to the outermost layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm, Zen stopped.
<br><br>
The surface of his body looked horrible and was covered in wounds caused by the black cracks that burst out.
<br><br>
Chapter 3775 Division Zen appeared to be grievously injured, but in truth, the damage was only skin deep. The water drops did not hurt his muscles and bones.
<br><br>
Circles of green light blossomed on Zen's body, and the surface-level wounds began to heal rapidly.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures saw what was happening, and they were dumbfounded at Zen's quick recovery.
<br><br>
Zen had persisted for almost a month, while most of the Other Shore creatures retreated again and again. Zen had been staying on the sixteenth layer to receive training, and the others all reluctantly agreed that Zen seemed to have gotten used to the sixteenth layer at this point.
<br><br>
They didn't expect that in the last few days, Zen would actually leave the Myriad Tribulations Storm, and he appeared to be injured.
<br><br>
"Is there something wrong with his method of body protection?"
<br><br>
"Perhaps..."
<br><br>
"Hey. It's clearly good enough for him to hold on for this long at the sixteenth layer. His tribulation skeleton has already surpassed many of ours!"
<br><br>
Even if Zen left awkwardly right now, what he had already accomplished was enough for them to recognize him as an extraordinary warrior.
<br><br>
After all, everyone relied on the method of body protection to stay within the Myriad Tribulations Storm. Although they couldn't see what method Zen had used to protect his body, it was already quite astonishing that he had held on for almost a month.
<br><br>
The green light shimmered and bloomed, spreading along the surface of Zen's body. After about five minutes, Zen's body returned to normal.
<br><br>
Zen, for his part, was less concerned about his own bodily injuries than about the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
"There seems to be something wrong with the Chaotic Source Spirits," Zen murmured, frowning.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"I am unable to detect their existence," replied Zen. He sought to sound calm, but he was deeply concerned.
<br><br>
Previously, he had been able to clearly sense the Chaotic Source Spirits scattered within his body. Now, however, it seemed that the Chaotic Source Spirits within him had vanished entirely. No matter how he probed, he could not sense them.
<br><br>
"How could that happen?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked curiously.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits were special. They had been a subject of study for the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess had been able to use them through information hidden in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed.
<br><br>
However, despite his extensive study, even the Primeval Lord of Heaven hadn't completely understood the Chaotic Source Spirits. The vast majority of people wouldn't be able to advance when they reached the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Even Athemar and Elizabeth would find twenty thousand divine megatons of power almost too much to be endured. If they wanted to bear a greater amount of power, it could be done only through a special bloodline theurgy or body protection theurgy.
<br><br>
However, since they couldn't cultivate the Myriad Tribulations Body, the bodies of the Chaotic Source Realm warriors were not strong enough.
<br><br>
Therefore, there was still an enormous gap between the talented warriors like Auden and Pearce, and the powerful masters like Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen was something entirely unprecedented. He was probably the first person to step into the Land of Bone Tribulation after fusing with the Chaotic Source Spirits. He didn't expect that such a thing would happen this time.
<br><br>
"I'll check again," said Zen.
<br><br>
If he had truly lost the Chaotic Source Spirits, it would lead to a drastic reduction in his level of strength.
<br><br>
Without the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits, even if one possessed a Civilization Artifact, the power that they could unleash would be limited.
<br><br>
The situation would be different if the Inheritance of World was activated.
<br><br>
However, the Inheritance of World would also cause the Civilization Artifact to consume a lot of energy. It was impossible to keep using it continuously during each battle.
<br><br>
Zen carefully searched within himself, and finally sensed what was wrong.
<br><br>
His body was full of tiny light dots, each no larger than the point of a needle. The light dots had been too small for Zen to notice them without paying close attention. Now, as he probed further, he realized that the light dots were like grains of dust spreading throughout his body.
<br><br>
"Are these the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits which have disappeared? Why have they become so small?" Zen wondered, feeling stunned at his discovery.
<br><br>
It seemed that the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits had become abnormally small, and yet they had also multiplied in number. Listening, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was also confused, for he had not heard of such a thing happening before.
<br><br>
'The golden liquid in the Myriad Tribulations Storm is related to the Descending Rings, and the Descending Rings went to the Source World along with the Chaotic Source Spirits. There must be some connection, ' he thought.
<br><br>
"Zen, try using these tiny light dots the same way you always use the Chaotic Source Spirits. See if they can help you withstand the power,"
<br><br>
suggested the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Everything on the Other Shore could provide some divine megatons of power, but the amount of power the Chaotic Source Spirits provided was a minus.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven theorized that everything on the Other Shore was simply a projection of energy from the Abstruse Energy World. In his theory, the Chaotic Source Spirits projected all the energy they had absorbed to a certain place in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Of course, he was merely speculating, but he was interested in what Zen's predicament could reveal about his theory.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "All right, I'll give it a try," he said.
<br><br>
He drove the bone plate again and entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
Even without the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits, Zen was capable of enduring the first layer without sustaining too much damage. At this point, he had been cultivating on the sixteenth layer for nearly a month. With his own tribulation skeleton he would still be able to enter the seventh or eighth layer.
<br><br>
But his intention now was just to test the tiny light dots. It wouldn't be necessary to advance to the higher layers.
<br><br>
He immediately felt the vivid blue and golden droplets on his skin.
<br><br>
In the outermost layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm, the water drops were sparse, and the power of the black cracks that appeared on Zen's body was much weaker.
<br><br>
He paid little attention to the cracks. Instead, he turned his focus to the light dots within his body.
<br><br>
As a drop of blue and gold water hit Zen's skin, the tiny light dots in that area vibrated, and then were extinguished.
<br><br>
"They are fatigued,"
<br><br>
Zen said to himself, feeling helpless.
<br><br>
As the light dots got tired, the Truth of Godly Way produced by his physical body circulated within him. When it reached the affected light dots, they lit up again like stars.
<br><br>
However, as soon as they began glowing, another small drop of water hit Zen's skin, and the light dots immediately died down again.
<br><br>
These minuscule light dots were constantly getting tired and getting rejuvenated, in a nonstop cycle.
<br><br>
Zen realized that he would have to go through the entire Chaotic Source Realm again.
<br><br>
"I've already stepped into the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm. Have I made use of these Chaotic Source Spirits to the limit?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Of course not," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered quickly.
<br><br>
In the Source World, there were many powerful Chaotic Source Realm warriors, and each of them was countless times older than Zen. When these warriors cultivated to the late stage of the realm, they all stopped, unable to make any further progress. But they hadn't encountered a situation similar to Zen's.
<br><br>
"Then there are two conditions," Zen said. "The warriors have to cultivate to the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm. And they also need to receive the training of the Myriad Tribulations Storm. Right?"
<br><br>
"That's possible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
He thought that based on Zen's experience, it seemed that the Chaotic Source Spirits had completed a round of division! After the fission, it looked like the number of Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's body had increased by a huge amount.
<br><br>
If these Chaotic Source Spirits could grow stronger, and Zen entered the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm again, would his physical body be able to bear much more divine megatons of force? "What if you cultivate to the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm again, and let the Chaotic Source Spirits split up one more time?"
<br><br>
suggested the Primeval Lord of Heaven. At his words, Zen's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
If the Chaotic Source Spirits continued to divide infinitely like this, his physical strength would probably increase to a terrifying level! It seemed that he would have to stay in the Myriad Tribulations Storm for longer than he had anticipated.
<br><br>
Chapter 3776 Temporary Closure Once the Land of Bone Tribulation was opened, the warriors had a training time of eight hundred hours. That was nearly a month.
<br><br>
But now that only fifty hours remained, Zen was no longer in a rush or held the same interest as before in refining the tribulation skeleton. In fact, he had been staying at the first layer on the very edge of the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
Previously Zen had successfully refined his Chaotic Source Spirits by the method of "being beaten." The rate at which they grew was astoundingly fast. It didn't take long before Zen made his way to the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
When he attempted to refine the Chaotic Source Spirits with the assistance of the blue-golden water drops in the Myriad Tribulation Storm, he was also "being beaten." But this method proved to be more effective.
<br><br>
The tiny light dots that signified the Chaotic Source Spirits were going through the constant process of being rinsed and refined. They were as minuscule as a needle tip in size. Over and over, they extinguished and lit up, then extinguished and lit up in an endless loop. While this method kept on repeating itself, the tiny particles of light simultaneously grew.
<br><br>
This sensation felt quite subtle. It resembled the feeling of countless seeds spreading and breaking through their roots inside his body, and slowly branching their way out. It was as if the Truth of Godly Way acted as an enzyme and sped up the process by infusing itself with them.
<br><br>
In just half a day, the size of the light spots had more than doubled.
<br><br>
Not only did they grow in size each passing minute, but their endurance to the power rose to a higher degree as well. With his newly acquired strength and resistance, Zen effortlessly took a step forward and made his way onto the second layer.
<br><br>
With this action of his, he attracted various curious eyes towards him that belonged to the creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After Zen's month-long stay on the sixteenth layer, it could be said that the first and second layers didn't prove fruitful enough for him, which was most of the reason why the Other Shore creatures failed to conclude his motives.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen didn't explain to them either. Instead, he chose to prioritize his refinement and kept all his focus on it alone. Slowly and gradually, as he moved forward, the light dots kept on growing in unison with his steps.
<br><br>
When the light dots grew to a certain degree, Zen began to count them carefully. They appeared to have tripled in numbers as the once two hundred Chaotic Source Spirits had now increased to six hundred.
<br><br>
"To conclude everything I know, the two hundred Chaotic Source Spirits can absorb about ten thousand divine megatons of force. When I cultivate to the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm once more, I can resist the attack of more than thirty thousand divine megatons of force only by the help of Chaotic Source Spirits."
<br><br>
Watching the Chaotic Source Spirits' rapid growth, Zen couldn't help but feel his heart flutter with joy.
<br><br>
He had entered the Land of Bone Tribulation intending to cultivate a Myriad Tribulations Body. The sudden surprise of the growth of Chaotic Source Spirits came as an unexpected gain for him, so he couldn't help but feel giddy over his recent discovery.
<br><br>
With only fifty hours remaining, Zen moved to the third layer. Meanwhile, the tiny light dots-like Chaotic Source Spirits slowly grew till each of them manifested itself into the size of an ant from its previous form of a needle tip.
<br><br>
When the time limit expired, the Myriad Tribulations Storm slowly subsided.
<br><br>
Just as the storm began to soothe up, the blue Soul Interdicting Water and the golden liquid retreated, respectively. As these events unfolded, a swarm of monsters swam their way out of the surrounding walls formed by the Soul Interdicting Water.
<br><br>
In addition to the Ghost-claw Worms, there were also various other unknown creatures. They had varying appearances, and their figures differed from one another. Their unknown origins made them a bigger threat as they glanced the Other Shore creatures in the inner space with eyes brimming with malice.
<br><br>
"The Myriad Tribulations Storm has stopped. Move quickly and get out of here!"
<br><br>
"The seawater will gather up soon enough. If we fall into the sea, we will be doomed..."
<br><br>
"Let's head up..."
<br><br>
Since the surrounding seawater slowly squeezed itself to pave its way towards the center, the space would soon be filled, leaving them nowhere to go.
<br><br>
Similar to the rules at Soul City, outsiders were not allowed to stay after the Land of Bone Tribulation was closed.
<br><br>
Taking caution to the situation, Zen lightly tapped on the bone plate with his tiptoe and flew up towards the bone stairs.
<br><br>
As for the tribulation skeletons, they remained on the bone plates and were eventually flooded by the Soul Interdicting Water.
<br><br>
Once Zen and the Other Shore creatures pushed their way out of the huge head, the jaws made clicking sound again. As if triggering something, the mouth closed up, and the head began to descend. The only thing it left to vouch for its existence was the skull that was left outside.
<br><br>
After a good round of rinsing and refining, the Other Shore creatures felt their enmity towards Zen dissolve. Some of them even revealed hints of high respect and goodwill towards him on their faces.
<br><br>
However, they were increasingly curious about the kind of body refining technique Zen had used.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen didn't let them in on any of the details. Besides, it would have been useless even if he decided to tell them.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits on the Other Shore existed in a different form from those in the Source World.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits from the Other Shore were ordinary creatures who harbored average strength. Even if they were carried by someone from the Source World as an Other Shore Token of the auxiliary type, their abilities would display minimal improvements.
<br><br>
However, in the Source World, the reproduced Chaotic Source Spirits took the form of life between the Other Shore and the Source World. They did not stray from the truth, and they could stay in the Source World.
<br><br>
The crystals found inside the bodies of the Chaotic Source Spirits held the ability to absorb energy and resist against damage. These Other Shore creatures were unable to see the crystals lying dormant in the bodies of the Chaotic Source Spirits, and they didn't carry anything.
<br><br>
The creatures from the Other Shore couldn't leave the Other Shore. For the next eight hundred hours, they were left with no choice but to wait it out and stay on the bone island.
<br><br>
The member of the Sturdy Bull race wasted no time and proceeded to draw himself a peculiar array on the ground. Once it was complete, he stepped inside and sat down to concentrate on cultivating his body refining method.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the centipede found himself a hollow bone and curled up inside it to rest his eyes and sleep. His protection theurgy seemed to have drained a considerable amount of his energy. He lay there and rested to recuperate after his month-long stay in the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
Zen bid his time and waited for the effect of the Soul Interdicting Water to wear off. Then, he left the Other Shore to learn about the current situation in the Source World.
<br><br>
The past month, the Source World had undergone a few mishaps that threatened its peace, but nothing too serious. However, it seemed Libby was encountering a few issues which prevented her from going to Stage ThirtyTwo of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
According to her, the bones in the Sanskrit Light Stage that led to the top seemed to have been destroyed, and this kind of damage probably had something to do with the changes in the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
Having no other choice, she had to reluctantly retreat to the largest bone cavity. After this, she chose to leave the Other Shore for a short period.
<br><br>
Libby had no one she could trust in the Sanskrit Light Stage. Helpless as she was, all she could do was wait. Maybe if Zen were to pass through the Land of Bone Tribulation, she could turn the tables in her favor? Meanwhile, Elizabeth had gained a firm foothold and strengthened her position in Stage Thirty of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Elizabeth had plans to summon her powerful clansmen of the Holy Soul Realm, from Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. She had debriefed the news to the Oneness Sky Palace. Pearce and the others felt themselves well up with joy upon hearing this from her. Stage Thirty of the Other Shore held significance in terms of its location. If humans were to gain control of this stage, the benefits would be incalculable.
<br><br>
However, when the strong warriors of the Holy Soul Realm attempted to rush down from Stage Thirty-two to claim the area, they encountered the same issue as Libby. There was something strangely wrong with the bones in the Sanskrit Light Stage, which prevented them from passing through it.
<br><br>
The Holy Souls residing in Stage Thirty-two were refused access to go down. Even so, the Holy Souls currently in Stage Twenty-nine and Twentyeight of the Other Shore were able to move up to get there. Although the Holy Souls combined from both stages weren't dominant in numbers, they were enough to lend Elizabeth a hand.
<br><br>
During this period, the Element Spirit race had also dispatched FiveElement Slaves from the higher stage. Unfortunately for them, they were quickly obliterated by Pompeo, the bald giant.
<br><br>
After successfully taking over the ice city, Elizabeth commanded all the Other Shore creatures in Stage Thirty to obediently submit under her rule.
<br><br>
Elizabeth had been leading the Divine Lair in the Sun Crow race, so she was experienced on how to bring others under her control through either brute force or bribery. The Other Shore creatures residing in Stage Thirty had no other choice but to pick the easier option and surrender, or they would have been asked to leave.
<br><br>
Within a short span of a month, the once rough Stage Thirty of the Other Shore was brought to strict order and became organized under the watchful rule of Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Elizabeth had someone else send the message to Zen, while she herself had been staying on the Other Shore during this period of time. She was too preoccupied to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chapter 3777 The Eighteenth Layer During the period he was unable to enter the Land of Bone Tribulation, aside from comprehending the Truth Enlightenment, he turned into the incarnation to enter his inner world.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven continuously transformed Zen's inner world, which made more and more strange things appear.
<br><br>
After he heard the related introduction, Zen made his way to the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Over the several months of her pregnancy, Margaret's belly grew day by day. She would give birth in four months' time.
<br><br>
Being cared in the fairy palace also meant that she was in good hands. They were so meticulous so there'd be no room for accidents and mistakes. It was during this month that Zen spent most of his time lounging around in the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Days went by, and eventually, one month had passed.
<br><br>
With his physical body, Zen entered the Other Shore and appeared on the bone island.
<br><br>
The creatures on the Other Shore were basically the natives to the place.
<br><br>
They were aware of the Source World below the Other Shore, but because of the Element Spirit race, they were hostile to the warriors from the Source World all the time.
<br><br>
But since Zen showed up, they finally had the opportunity to understand him. After all, they still wanted to know more about him.
<br><br>
"Buddy, can your body withstand all the suffering when you travel back?"
<br><br>
the member of the Sturdy Bull race asked curiously.
<br><br>
"I don't return just by traveling," replied Zen.
<br><br>
"Oh really? What method do you use?" another Other Shore creature asked.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, Zen answered, "Maybe I have created a new body."
<br><br>
There were various debates on the relationship between the warrior's form on the Other Shore and that in the Source World. However, there remained a common truth that the warrior created an identical avatar on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"You created a new body? Can your another body move?" The strange questions made Zen morose.
<br><br>
After he answered them with a few perfunctory words, the Other Shore creatures stopped asking.
<br><br>
A period of time later, the skull rose once again. Its jaws opened, which revealed a set of bone stairs.
<br><br>
After they entered the wide space under the island, the Myriad Tribulations Storm began to spin once more. Everyone was cautious, and they stepped on the bone plates as they made their way into the Myriad Tribulations Storm.
<br><br>
Zen entered the third layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm in order to receive the baptism of the small water drops.
<br><br>
Compared to everyone else, the member of the Sturdy Bull race was the most curious about Zen. He remained at Zen's side and reminded, "You've cultivated on the sixteenth layer for nearly a month, so cultivating here would be pointless. I suggest you enter the seventeenth layer, although that would be difficult for you..."
<br><br>
Because he knew that Zen stayed on the sixteenth layer for nearly a month, he assumed that this was Zen's limit. The seventeenth layer would be a challenge to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen turned around to look at the Sturdy Bull and nodded politely. He was not in the mood to argue.
<br><br>
As he saw Zen's disinterest, the Sturdy Bull shrugged his shoulders and moved away without another word.
<br><br>
As the Chaotic Source Spirits grew to the size of an ant, they increased in speed as well.
<br><br>
Zen moved quickly to the fourth layer, the fifth layer, the sixth layer...
<br><br>
The small light dots continued to grow, eventually into the size of a mung bean and then as big as a broad bean.
<br><br>
Not long after, Zen was finally back and safe in the sixteenth layer.
<br><br>
The last time he was here, he reached his limit.
<br><br>
However, this time was different. For some reason, there was still enough room for the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body to grow! Having stayed in the sixteenth layer for more than twenty hours, the Chaotic Source Spirits grew to the size of two broad beans. This was the standard size of the normal Chaotic Source Spirit. However, as the amount of the Chaotic Source Spirits increased threefold, the damage they could bear would naturally increase by three times.
<br><br>
Naturally, this meant that within such a short period of time, Zen reduced from the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm to the early stage, and then cultivated to the late stage again.
<br><br>
Carefully, Zen tilted the bone plate ever so slightly, but just as he was about to enter the seventeenth layer, the centipede beside him began to speak, "Don't listen to the guy from the Sturdy Bull race. The seventeenth layer is too much to handle, compared to the sixteenth layer. I would advise you to stay on the sixteenth layer for even a few more years."
<br><br>
This was true. The Myriad Tribulations Storm had twenty layers, and the higher layer one attained, the more brutal the tearing force became.
<br><br>
Although the centipede believed in Zen's capabilities, he also knew well that everyone had a limit in terms of the growth and cultivation speed.
<br><br>
In the centipede's eyes, the sixteenth layer was Zen's limit, and entering the seventeenth layer was not going to be a piece of cake.
<br><br>
"Thank you for the kind reminder."
<br><br>
Zen nodded and smiled at the centipede. Then he moved on and entered the seventeenth layer without hesitation. He was quite eager to see the potential of the Chaotic Source Spirits, especially after their amount increased by three times.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! Beneath the tearing of the small water drops, the six hundred light dots in Zen's body wore out quickly, while the Truth of Godly Way continually repaired the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
"I can withstand that!"
<br><br>
The corner of Zen's mouth curled up in a grin. He looked around, but eventually his gaze fell on the tribulation skeleton opposite him. Within a second, his grin turned into a frown.
<br><br>
A part of the tearing power of the water drops within the seventeenth layer was most probably borne by the tribulation skeleton. This was far beyond what Zen wanted, and he was probably the first one to be displeased by this.
<br><br>
"Really? Can you really hold on?"
<br><br>
As the centipede saw this unfold, he couldn't help but let out a screech of surprise.
<br><br>
He was shocked by what Zen had achieved when he entered the Land of Bone Tribulation for the first time. But this time, the scene made him get even more shocked.
<br><br>
Initially, Zen managed to step into the sixteenth layer with his unique body refining method.
<br><br>
Then, after he cultivated in the Land of Bone Tribulation for a month, he entered the seventeenth layer. This was too fast.
<br><br>
However, as the centipede was still speechless in surprise, he saw Zen directly enter the eighteenth layer.
<br><br>
For some reason, Zen could still withstand everything! The black cracks that formed from the small water drops in the eighteenth layer resembled long bugs, lasting longer than those in the previous layers.
<br><br>
Therefore, their tearing power naturally increased by several times.
<br><br>
Over time, the six hundred Chaotic Source Spirits in his body dimmed and were repaired again and again. Within a few minutes, Zen regained the balance point. He was ready to continue on.
<br><br>
At the same time, the tribulation skeleton opposite Zen underwent an unprecedented refinement.
<br><br>
This time, Zen was much more vigilant than last time! As he received training, Zen studied the Chaotic Source Spirits all the time.
<br><br>
After all, the energy of the water drops in the eighteenth layer was several times stronger than that on the sixteenth layer. If the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits failed to work, his body would be shattered by the small water drops...
<br><br>
On one hand, Zen made sure he paid attention to the Chaotic Source Spirits, always checking if they turned non-effective. Simultaneously, he expected they would split up again.
<br><br>
If one Chaotic Source Spirit divided into three like before, this meant that the six hundred Chaotic Source Spirits in his body would be divided into a thousand and eight hundred. If this happened, the Chaotic Source Spirits could withstand around one hundred thousand divine megatons of force, which would help him a lot in his quest.
<br><br>
A few minutes had passed and Zen observed the Chaotic Source Spirits continuously.
<br><br>
Eventually, sixty hours had passed and he finally saw that the light dots of Chaotic Source Spirits in his body began to flash. Each of the light dots divided into three dots, dimming quickly throughout the process.
<br><br>
"Get out!"
<br><br>
Zen drove the bone plate and leaned backwards, after which he rushed out of the Myriad Tribulations Storm at high speed.
<br><br>
But even though Zen reacted quickly, his physical body could not escape the water drops of the eighteenth layer. Within seconds, the long and thin black cracks created wounds across his back, chest, and legs.
<br><br>
Chapter 3778 Reverse Vortex His left leg was the most injured. It was almost cut off by the black cracks, painting an incredibly terrifying sight.
<br><br>
However, Zen did not care. Instead, his heart was filled with ecstasy.
<br><br>
"Incredible. It seems the Chaotic Source Spirits can really split infinitely.
<br><br>
My God..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven also took a deep breath.
<br><br>
He knew just how powerful this characteristic was.
<br><br>
After the second split, Zen would be able to withstand one hundred thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven remained unable to clearly judge the true conditions for this current situation.
<br><br>
Could it be that one would be able to split up the Chaotic Source Spirits so long as they merged with the Chaotic Source Spirits and entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm with their physical body? Or was the Truth of Godly Way in Zen's body an indispensable part of this process? As the Primeval Lord of Heaven thought this through, Zen began to heal himself.
<br><br>
The four wounds he sustained were incredibly serious and it would take him a significant amount of time to heal them.
<br><br>
As soon as he was back to full health, Zen rushed into the Myriad Tribulations Storm with great interest.
<br><br>
On the one hand, he wanted to go back and experience the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, but on the other, he couldn't help but expect something more. Could the Chaotic Source Spirits split again? Thus, once he entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm, Zen repeated his cultivation way once more.
<br><br>
Step by step, he was once again able to return to the eighteenth layer! This time, his progress was much faster owing to the fact that his tribulation skeleton had gotten even stronger. In just a little over 10 days, the one thousand eight hundred Chaotic Source Spirits in his body rapidly expanded and lit up, occupying almost every corner of his body.
<br><br>
Every single Chaotic Source Spirit within him emitted light and completely turned his body into a pillar of luminescence.
<br><br>
When Zen looked within, he suddenly found a strange phenomenon.
<br><br>
He quickly called out for the Primeval Lord of Heaven for this unexplainable occurrence. "There seems to be a vortex in my body," Zen told him.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven inhaled sharply. "Vortex?!"
<br><br>
Zen continued to stare at this abnormality with deep curiosity. "It seems to be similar to that vortex in the suns created by Emperor Charm, also to that one on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's golden sword!" he described.
<br><br>
This kind of vortex seemed to be spinning crazily but in truth, it was a mere, flat surface. To the creatures in the chaos, it did not exist and was only considered a form of expression.
<br><br>
The one in Zen's body was the same. It slowly rotated but did not devour anything.
<br><br>
It was truly an interesting phenomenon. "Oh!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed. "Let me have a look then!"
<br><br>
Zen quickly agreed and the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw through his body.
<br><br>
Among the many white light dots, he indeed saw a vortex.
<br><br>
"What do you think? Are they the same?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
There was no way that the Primeval Lord of Heaven wouldn't know about this type of phenomenon. He was bound to be the highest authority of knowledge about this sort of thing.
<br><br>
At last, the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded in reply. "Yes, but the vortex is spinning in the reverse direction!"
<br><br>
This sort of vortex was known as the descending vortex phenomenon. In nature, all energy descended from outside the chaos. But when it reached a certain level, it would form a vortex.
<br><br>
All the descending vortexes he met before spun left but Zen's was spinning right.
<br><br>
"Reverse direction..." Zen repeated.
<br><br>
He wasn't stupid. He knew what this most probably entailed. "It seems that this is related to the characteristics of the Chaotic Source Spirits. The power they absorbed has actually been transferred to a space outside the chaos?!"
<br><br>
"Very smart!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed in satisfaction. "The Snake Goddess was the first one to make this conjecture a long time ago.
<br><br>
After all, there was no way the power absorbed by the Chaotic Source Spirits would disappear for no reason. We weren't able to find any evidence to support this, until now!"
<br><br>
Zen tilted his head in curiosity. "Where is the absorbed energy being transmitted?" he asked.
<br><br>
His reply from the Primeval Lord of Heaven was a shrug. "I'm afraid I don't have the answer. We do not know much about the Abstruse Energy World and there's no way to find out in such a short period of time. We'll have to rely on you and your son to explore it..."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit, who had been silent all this time, suddenly sighed. "I thought Wing King had had a thorough understanding of the Other Shore. I never expected so much of it to be shrouded by mystery. It's really incredible."
<br><br>
As the Regal Jade Spirit understood the human civilization little by little, he gradually found that the Regal Jade Civilization's understanding of the chaos was far inferior although they were powerful.
<br><br>
"Regal Jade Spirit, you're being too modest. To the entire Abstruse Energy World, our knowledge is but a drop in the ocean. I had previously thought our human race's understanding was second to that of the Element Spirit Civilization but it seemed we were far more inferior compared to the Calculation Civilization," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
It had to be noted that the Calculation Civilization had been able to transform the light dots into normal images and communicate with the creatures in the Abstruse Energy World. But the human race couldn't do this till now.
<br><br>
After spending a bit more time in the eighteenth layer, Zen broke through the nineteenth and twentieth layers relying on the strength of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures were already able to remain calm after seeing his performance. His previous outstanding performance had stunned them enough.
<br><br>
It seemed when the Land of Bone Tribulation was opened for the third time, Zen would no doubt be able to achieve the Myriad Tribulations Body, perhaps even obtain a few Bone Tribulation Imprints.
<br><br>
The core of the Myriad Tribulations Storm was a mixture of Soul Interdicting Water and a sort of golden liquid.
<br><br>
It was like a fierce tornado with the central area as the most chaotic and dangerous part.
<br><br>
When Zen got sucked in, so did his tribulation skeleton at the other side.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! Countless black cracks appeared and turned into tens of millions of black blades that cut Zen's body and his tribulation skeleton at the other side.
<br><br>
After Zen passed through the eighteenth layer, his tribulation skeleton turned completely golden and released a dignified aura. If this glowing, golden skeleton merged with him to make him obtain the Myriad Tribulations Body, then Zen would be able to release an amazing power with the help of the Civilization Artifacts. He had a lot of expectations for this.
<br><br>
However, even as he entered the twentieth layer, Zen had to give his tribulation bones a bit more time to be refined. Thus, he could only sit on the bone plate and wait patiently.
<br><br>
There was no sign of a third split for the Chaotic Source Spirits, which made him feel a bit disappointed.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven," Zen called out, "I know the Myriad Tribulations Body is obtained on the twentieth layer, but how will I be able to obtain the Bone Tribulation Imprints?"
<br><br>
The Holy Soul Imprints, along with the Bone Tribulation Imprints, were related to the Eternal Scroll Painting and deserved his attention.
<br><br>
"You'll get the chance when your tribulation skeleton reaches the level of the Myriad Tribulations Body. I don't think it will be long..."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was sizing up the glittering gold tribulation skeleton on the other side but his words were cut off by the sudden luster it released. It was like a newborn sun that burned with bright flames and emitted a dazzling light! Chapter 3779 Celestial Stone The majority of people didn't spend a long time on the twentieth layer.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, for example, had merely spent a short while on that layer once he had successfully concluded his cultivation on the nineteenth layer. Within a short span of time, the refining of his tribulation skeleton had been completed, and he had achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body.
<br><br>
However, Zen had spent little time on the first nineteen layers, so it stood to reason that he should require more time on the twentieth layer.
<br><br>
But the Primeval Lord of Heaven had obviously underestimated the refining speed on the twentieth layer. After just a few minutes, Zen had successfully completed his refining.
<br><br>
In other words, if someone could directly bear the power of the blue gold currents on the twentieth layer, then theoretically, they would only require one or two days, or even less, to achieve the Myriad Tribulations Body! 'I've already achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body?' Zen studied his tribulation skeleton with a dazed expression.
<br><br>
As the tribulation skeleton emitted a golden light, the bone plates beneath his feet and his tribulation skeleton began to rotate with the tornado. The distance between the two bone plates decreased continuously, and finally they overlapped with each other! 'Is this bone plate an illusion?' Zen was stunned when he saw the two bone plates intersect and fuse into each other.
<br><br>
At this point, not only did the bone plates become phantasmal, but even the tribulation skeleton morphed into a phantom.
<br><br>
When the two bone plates were completely overlapped, Zen and his tribulation skeleton followed suit.
<br><br>
Once the tribulation skeleton had completely entered Zen's body, the golden light became diffused and faded into nothing. But Zen felt as if his bones had been scorched by fire, and he felt a fiery agony in his skull, spine, arms, and legs...
<br><br>
At this time, Zen was already within the eye of the tornado, sitting atop the bone plate while spinning crazily.
<br><br>
"In two months, he has already achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body..."
<br><br>
the Sturdy Bull murmured in disbelief.
<br><br>
Even though he was clueless as to the shortest time to achieve the Myriad Tribulations Body, from his point of view, Zen's cultivation speed was simply miraculous as he had got the Myriad Tribulations Body after the Land of Bone Tribulation opened only twice! "Achieving the Myriad Tribulations Body is not his limit," the centipede said. "The twentieth layer was still quite easy for him. He is very likely to move to the next level."
<br><br>
"The next level?" another creature queried curiously.
<br><br>
The centipede nodded and said with wizened eyes, "It is said that very few people can obtain the Bone Tribulation Imprints in the Land of Bone Tribulation. Yet, one requires those imprints to become a super strong warrior!"
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures were of naturally inferior numbers compared to the entire Source World.
<br><br>
The centipede and the Sturdy Bull were both considered talents among their own races. However, as the creatures in the Source World were countless times more numerous than those of the Other Shore, and the chances of a talent being born were much greater, the vast majority of the talents who obtained the Bone Tribulation Imprints came from the chaos.
<br><br>
Just as the centipede had anticipated, Zen's entire body began to sink while spinning.
<br><br>
The blue golden tornado quickly gobbled Zen down like a fast flowing vortex.
<br><br>
Splash! Zen sank swiftly to the bottom of the sea.
<br><br>
Buzz! A light column rose to meet him from the bottom, and Zen was soon enveloped.
<br><br>
'This light column is similar in nature to that in the Soul City...' Zen's eyes flashed with recognition.
<br><br>
While contemplating this, he suddenly felt a burning sensation on his back.
<br><br>
Click! It was as if a red hot iron had been placed on his back, branding a mark on it.
<br><br>
"Dirty Body Imprint!"
<br><br>
Before the burning feeling subsided, another scorching imprint was ruthlessly placed on his chest.
<br><br>
"Internal Shaking Imprint!"
<br><br>
Click! "Lasing Golden Imprint..."
<br><br>
Click! "……"
<br><br>
As Zen plummeted downward, the Bone Tribulation Imprints continued to appear on his body one after another.
<br><br>
After descending all the way to the bottom, nine Bone Tribulation Imprints seared into his flesh one by one, as if they had been prepared in advance.
<br><br>
However, Zen didn't feel anything except when these imprints touched his body.
<br><br>
"This is also similar to what happened in the Soul City. Didn't you say that nine Bone Tribulation Imprints were incredibly difficult to get?" Zen asked since things were quite different from what he had expected.
<br><br>
In the Soul City, Zen had also obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints without much effort. At that time, he and the Primeval Lord of Heaven had been extremely confused, but now, the similar thing had happened again. With so little difficulty, he got nine Bone Tribulation Imprints, which was reeking of strangeness.
<br><br>
"It's indeed odd," the Primeval Lord of Heaven agreed, and his face shone with confusion.
<br><br>
Perhaps it was blind luck that Zen had obtained the nine Holy Soul Imprints in the Soul City. But now such a thing had happened again in the Land of Bone Tribulation, and this clearly had nothing to do with luck.
<br><br>
Regardless of the mystery, it was beneficial for Zen to obtain the Bone Tribulation Imprints successfully.
<br><br>
Outside the light column was a dark blue sea.
<br><br>
The vast sea in the Sanskrit Light Stage was a mysterious landscape to those of the outside world.
<br><br>
To the Other Shore creatures, the Sanskrit Light Stage was those bone caves. The world outside the bone caves seemed to not exist. Only when the bone caves were broken would the creatures in the sea invade them.
<br><br>
However, those bone caves were very much alive. Even should they be damaged over a period of time, they could still repair themselves.
<br><br>
Therefore, the vast majority of the Other Shore creatures only viewed the Sanskrit Light Stage as a passageway.
<br><br>
Even the Element Spirit race, who knew the Other Shore best, lacked any real knowledge about the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
While Zen was still at the bottom of the light column, a black figure rose from the depths of the sea like a wraith.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The black figure quickly approached the light column and extended a hand towards Zen.
<br><br>
That "hand" was made of a number of tentacles! As the tentacles entered the light column, they wrapped around Zen one after another and pulled him down from the light column! When the Other Shore creatures in the Myriad Tribulations Storm witnessed this sudden event, they were all dumbfounded.
<br><br>
The many strange creatures in the sea had always appeared to be controlled by a law of some kind and never dared to rush into the Land of Bone Tribulation to attack warriors. Therefore, at the occasional sightings of the ghost hand creatures swimming along the sea walls, they were not overly concerned.
<br><br>
But what happened now boggled their minds! "Zen was taken away from the light column?"
<br><br>
"What kind of creature do those tentacles belong to?"
<br><br>
"It wants to kill Zen!"
<br><br>
"Look, there's a spear wrapped in the tentacles over there!"
<br><br>
Although the light at the bottom of the dark blue sea was very dim, these creatures had excellent vision, and they could still clearly view the events unfolding.
<br><br>
Some of the tentacles had wrapped around Zen, while others were wrapped around a long spear! The spear was completely blue. Powerful energy was surging within it, and on the surface of the spear tip, a red light was pulsing mysteriously.
<br><br>
"That spear!" The Primeval Lord of Heaven was shocked at seeing this.
<br><br>
"What is it?" Zen asked. He also noticed the extraordinary qualities of the spear.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven cautiously explained, "The spear itself is insignificant, but the tip of it is made of a Celestial Stone, which can amplify power nine-fold. It's a very rare and useful treasure in Stage Thirtythree. The only problem is that it can't be combined with the Other Shore Tokens that can amplify force too."
<br><br>
Chapter 3780 Demonic Murloc Below Zen, a great creature floated in the dark blue sea.
<br><br>
While most of its body was shrouded in darkness, a huge outline could be recognized vaguely in the water. Its torso was akin to that of a human's, but its limbs were tentacles several hundred to a thousand feet long.
<br><br>
It was none other than a Demonic Murloc — a very mysterious race on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Very few members of this race existed, but each one was extremely powerful — they were the strongest creatures in this sea.
<br><br>
The outside world knew little about these creatures apart from a record that the Demonic Murlocs had once broken the biggest bone cave a long time ago, attacking the creatures inside.
<br><br>
Typically, they stayed in the deepest parts of the sea, rarely getting involved in the world outside.
<br><br>
As the Element Spirit race tried gaining their support, the Nihility race and many other races did so as well — they all wanted to rule the Sanskrit Light Stage with the Demonic Murlocs' help.
<br><br>
But these creatures refused them all.
<br><br>
Like the Garudas in Stage Twenty-nine, the Demonic Murlocs in Stage Thirty-one couldn't resign themselves to the outside world's power. Perhaps it was their creator's deliberate arrangement, or maybe it was a mere coincidence. So in the end, these races had no choice but to forfeit.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race, however, saw a sliver of hope — even while the Demonic Murlocs remained at the top of the food chain, they weren't free from disputes of power within the race.
<br><br>
When the chance came, the Element Spirit race assisted a Demonic Murloc called Kendall to beat out his competitors and come to sit on the race's throne.
<br><br>
Even after Kendall became the Demonic Murlocs' king, his subjects still rarely displayed any friendliness to the Element Spirit race. Fortunately, the king himself had made a promise to the Element Spirit race, offering them a helping hand at a critical moment.
<br><br>
It was at this time that Kendall finally decided to fulfill his promise.
<br><br>
The Celestial Spear was a gift from the Element Spirit race — it contained terrifying power, and when Kendall wielded it, he couldn't help but be shocked by the sheer force.
<br><br>
For a long time, Kendall waited beneath the Land of Bone Tribulation because he couldn't attack the creatures within the land.
<br><br>
But once Zen left, he could attack him at will.
<br><br>
And so in theory, if Zen failed to get the Bone Tribulation Imprints, Kendall probably wouldn't get a chance to attack Zen in the sea.
<br><br>
Because of this, Kendall was entirely bewildered by the Element Spirit race's order.
<br><br>
He couldn't understand how they could be so certain of Zen's success.
<br><br>
As he watched and waited quietly in the sea, Zen indeed obtained the Bone Tribulation Imprints — he even got nine of them.
<br><br>
'This human is an extraordinary talent…' Kendall was completely taken aback by Zen's achievement.
<br><br>
But since he decided to kill him, he wouldn't hesitate at the last moment.
<br><br>
Even if Zen had cultivated the Myriad Tribulations Body, Kendall believed that his all-out attack was more than enough to kill Zen. The Celestial Spear he got from the Element Spirit race was a great weapon in itself.
<br><br>
It could increase strength nine-fold, after all.
<br><br>
If he used 15, 000 divine megatons of force, an attack he launched through the Celestial Spear would contain over 130, 000 divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Such was something most people would dread to even imagine.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The sea water's resistance didn't hinder Kendall in the slightest.
<br><br>
The long spear penetrated the water like a bat shuttling through the night sky, heading straight for Zen.
<br><br>
Dropping at the very bottom of the light pillar, Zen had no time to dodge at all.
<br><br>
He tried swimming upward, but it was clearly too late.
<br><br>
'This spear strike is unimaginably great — seems like I have to take it headon!' The moment Zen thought it, the Celestial Spear had already made it straight to his chest.
<br><br>
Crack! The spear pierced Zen's body with a strange sound.
<br><br>
In a flash of white light, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body formed a circling whirlpool.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits, which had increased six-fold in number, managed to neutralize about 100, 000 divine megatons of force. The remaining force of the strike spread throughout Zen's chest and into his body. But with the tribulation skeleton that had already merged with his body and the nine Bone Tribulation Imprints, he withstood the power all too easily.
<br><br>
The Celestial Spear only slightly pierced into Zen's chest, narrowly stabbing into a rib. Traces of blood started spreading in the seawater.
<br><br>
Withstanding the spear strike that contained such an immense amount of force, he was barely even injured.
<br><br>
Upon witnessing the scene, the Demonic Murloc was so astounded that his eyes almost bulged out.
<br><br>
In truth, the spear strike could have easily pierced through his own body — the attack's power was enough to shatter the body into shreds.
<br><br>
It was a truly formidable spear strike.
<br><br>
And yet the human managed to survive it.
<br><br>
Not to mention the fact that he was barely even harmed.
<br><br>
Was the man really human, one would wonder? Because the Demonic Murlocs were born strong, they naturally understood the weakness of many Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
Humans were normally the weakest of all.
<br><br>
But the scene unfolding before Kendall was completely beyond his imagination.
<br><br>
Buzz! Once the strike was delivered, the tip of the spear quickly dimmed.
<br><br>
The Celestial Stone couldn't be combined with another Other Shore Token, and it would take a great long time to recover after being used once. Such were the weaknesses of the Celestial Stone — the warriors that wielded weapons forged from this stone usually had to kill their enemies in a single strike.
<br><br>
Once some powerful warriors in the Source World merged with this Other Shore Token, they faced the same problem. After failing to kill their opponents in a single blow, they'd be left with no choice but to escape.
<br><br>
When Kendall realized his attack caused no damage to Zen, he fell into a panic.
<br><br>
He attempted to flee with the long spear in his hand.
<br><br>
Crack! Zen then reached out and caught the Celestial Spear. Staring into the darkness, he asked, "Who are you?"
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, Kendall gave Zen no reply. Instead, he remained silent and tried to pull the spear back.
<br><br>
But Zen's physical body had been greatly strengthened — he could display a considerable amount of the Civilization Artifacts' power as his physical body was already strong enough to withstand it.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In an instant, he managed to snatch away the spear from the Demonic Murloc.
<br><br>
Then, he stabbed down, hacking into the water.
<br><br>
Over 50, 000 divine megatons of force erupted from his body before it turned the dark blue current into an intense tornado.
<br><br>
Like an invincible saber, the long spear chopped down.
<br><br>
Puff! As the tip of the spear swiftly slashed against the water's surface, several tentacles were rapidly cut off before black blood spread widely into the seawater.
<br><br>
While Zen wanted to chase after Kendall, the Demonic Murloc was more familiar with the water than he was. He fled into the sea at a surprisingly great speed. In the blink of an eye, he completely disappeared from Zen's view — only darkness remained below.
<br><br>
"I bet the Element Spirit race sent him," Zen muttered with a shrug before swimming back into the light pillar.
<br><br>
Following the light pillar, he returned to the Land of Bone Tribulation. All the Other Shore creatures there gazed at him with wide eyes.
<br><br>
The power Zen displayed on the bone island made them both astounded and cautious. The fact that Zen cut off the Demonic Murloc's tentacles had everyone overwhelmed with fear and awe.
<br><br>
Chapter 3781 Gains Of course, the Other Shore creatures that wandered in the Sanskrit Light Stage were well aware of the powerful strength of those monsters in the sea.
<br><br>
Still, such a powerful monster fled in the presence of Zen.
<br><br>
How mighty was he? Meanwhile, Zen drove the bone plate and floated out of the Myriad Tribulations Storm. The blue-gold raindrops still hit his body, but the black cracks on his skin no longer posed any threat to him.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures gathered at the entrance continued to drive their bone plates to make way for him.
<br><br>
At that moment, the centipede came forward and said, "Congratulations on your achieving the Myriad Tribulations Body!"
<br><br>
The creatures of the Source World couldn't enter the Land of Bone Tribulation, and in any case, it would take a long time for the Other Shore creatures to achieve the Myriad Tribulations Body.
<br><br>
"Thank you," Zen answered with a nod.
<br><br>
The centipede didn't say anything else, then he retreated to the side with the other creatures.
<br><br>
They didn't dare to pry into the secrets of such a powerful warrior. They were afraid that if they behaved too attentively, they might annoy him.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he walked out of the bone stairs and returned to the bone island again.
<br><br>
If he wanted to leave the Other Shore, he had to wait until the effects of the Soul Interdicting Water disappeared.
<br><br>
However, he didn't intend to leave the Other Shore at all.
<br><br>
Libby, who had failed to enter Stage Thirty-two, still waited for him in the bone cavity. He could go there now and meet her since he had obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body.
<br><br>
By the edge of the bone island stood the bone slaves who waited for orders.
<br><br>
Since the bone slaves were no different from the dead, they looked like soulless skeletons when they lowered their heads and stayed motionless.
<br><br>
When Zen approached them, however, they suddenly seemed to have souls and began to move.
<br><br>
They proceeded to look for the bone oars, and when they found them, they quickly jumped back to the bone boat.
<br><br>
Once they finished, Zen leaped lightly and landed steadily on the bone boat.
<br><br>
It would take some time to return to the beach, but he wasn't in a hurry. He leaned firmly against the side of the boat and played with the long spear in his hand.
<br><br>
"The Celestial Stone's light seemed a little brighter," he said.
<br><br>
When the Celestial Spear was pointed at him, he saw that its tip was extremely dazzling even in the dark blue ocean.
<br><br>
But after one shot, the tip of the spear quickly dimmed.
<br><br>
After one hour, the light at the spear's tip became a little brighter again.
<br><br>
It would take more than twenty hours for the Celestial Stone to completely recover. For now, it can only double your strength," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said as he stared at the long spear. "Once it has completely recovered, the spear will release its power. You can instantly kill any powerful warrior by then," he added.
<br><br>
Zen was not too surprised to hear this.
<br><br>
His body could carry over one hundred thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
If he were to extract all of that and infuse it into this spear, the spear's strike would probably contain over a million divine megatons of force! How terrifying would such an amount of force be? It was known that in the past, the human ancestor had only released less than ten million divine megatons of force even though he had fused with the best Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Then again, that force was supposed to complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen could release a million divine megatons of force now when he relied on the spear. Thus, one could only imagine how truly strong the spear was.
<br><br>
But just as the Primeval Lord of Heaven had said, although the Celestial Stone was powerful, it sadly couldn't be used together with the Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type. Therefore, choosing the Celestial Stone meant that one's increment of power would be fixed at nine times.
<br><br>
In this case, the spear appeared nothing to a master at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
"No matter how strong it is, I can't carry it," Zen said regretfully.
<br><br>
The three Truths of Godly Ways in his body each carried a Civilization Artifact. The Civilization Artifacts were not like ordinary Other Shore Tokens that one could abandon. Once Zen had them, he would develop some sort of relationship with them.
<br><br>
For instance, the Regal Jade Spirit and the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization were inseparable from him now. Of course, it was unrealistic for him to give them up.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he could use the spear on the Other Shore. Although it wasn't a sword, it could be used as a weapon to increase strength.
<br><br>
After the bone boat had drifted on the sea for a long time, it finally arrived at the beach made of bones.
<br><br>
They docked the boat, then Zen set foot on the beach. The bone slaves followed suit and went to their positions, then their bones immediately scattered.
<br><br>
Without rest, Zen walked along the beach and returned to the huge bone cave.
<br><br>
After he reached the cave, he went to the huge bone cavity again.
<br><br>
He thought that the bone cavity was empty, but the lively commotion in it proved that he was wrong.
<br><br>
There was the Ear Mouse race, two members of the Separate Abyss race, one of the Celestial Wolf race, and Libby.
<br><br>
Libby had previously sent a message to Zen where she told him that she couldn't enter Stage Thirty-two, and she would just wait for him to pass through the Land of Bone Tribulation in the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
However, she heard that the cultivation speed in the Land of Bone Tribulation was immensely slow. It took years to pass through it.
<br><br>
Therefore, no matter how talented Zen was, it would probably still take him a few years to finish the cultivation. Of course, she didn't want to stay in one place all the time.
<br><br>
Thus, she continued to enter the Sanskrit Light Stage to find a way to pass through it.
<br><br>
She couldn't find a way, but she met several other Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Those Souls of Light had become Holy Souls. But they couldn't enter Stage Thirty-two just like her. In the end, they decided to gather in the bone cavity to find a solution.
<br><br>
They were shocked when they suddenly saw a person come out from the bone cave on the right.
<br><br>
"Zen!" Libby exclaimed in surprise.
<br><br>
"Have you already passed the Land of Bone Tribulation?" she asked.
<br><br>
"Pass the Land of Bone Tribulation?"
<br><br>
"Does that mean that he has obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body?"
<br><br>
"How is that possible?"
<br><br>
The two members of the Separate Abyss race and that one of the Celestial Wolf race were stunned.
<br><br>
One who had obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body could enter the Eternal Scroll Painting and reach the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
They subconsciously thought that it was impossible, but the name "Zen"
<br><br>
was like a needle that pierced into their minds.
<br><br>
Zen, who had brought his physical body to the Other Shore, was able to reach the Eternal Realm! "Squeak! It has only been three months, but he has already obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body.
<br><br>
How could it be possible?"
<br><br>
"It is too fast. Squeak!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice knew that he had entered the Land of Bone Tribulation, but they never thought that he would pass through the land so quickly! "Yes, I have passed the Land of Bone Tribulation," Zen said and nodded in response. "That's great!" Libby praised.
<br><br>
There were changes in the Sanskrit Light Stage, and the bone cave that led to Stage Thirty-two was blocked.
<br><br>
And she couldn't count on the Ear Mice or the members from the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
They had been discussing in the bone cavity for a few days already, and all of them remained vigilant. They planned to leave the Other Shore as soon as there was any accident. Hence, she knew that she couldn't pin her hopes on them.
<br><br>
However, Zen must be able to solve the problem. For some ineffable reason, she was always strangely confident in him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3782 Dragon Threads The fact that Zen had passed through the Land of Bone Tribulation was good news for Libby, as well as for the other Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Holy Souls were already very powerful in a general sense, so it was possible for them to fight against ordinary Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
But a physical body which had achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body was undoubtedly even more powerful. "I wonder what has blocked the way to Stage Thirty-two," asked Zen.
<br><br>
He had encountered so much trouble ever since he left the Soul City. The Element Spirit race had set up all sorts of obstacles along his way! In fact, the Element Spirit race caused most of those problems in the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
"Go there and look yourself, then you'll know," Libby said.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen walked towards the bone cave in the center of the bone cavity, then Libby and the other Souls of Light followed him.
<br><br>
He had seen the view outside the bone caves before. It looked like many tall bamboos that reached to the sky.
<br><br>
After they climbed in the cave for a while, something suddenly blocked their way.
<br><br>
Zen got closer to inspect it and saw that it was another bone that was in their path.
<br><br>
Someone had stabbed a piece of bone horizontally into the cave, which completely blocked the path. There were no gaps at all.
<br><br>
He stepped forward to touch it and was amazed. "How did they make this? It would've required a lot of strength to stab this bone horizontally like this," he muttered.
<br><br>
A warrior from the Separate Abyss race shook his head and said, "That bone is unbelievably heavy. We already tried to push it away together, but it wouldn't budge."
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race were known for their indomitable strength. After they reached the Holy Soul Realm and together with their blood theurgy, they could make their Holy Souls unleash unparalleled power.
<br><br>
Yet, the bone that blocked the cave was too heavy. Even if they worked together, it still didn't move—so they had no choice but to go back to the large bone cavity.
<br><br>
"Zen, let's all work together to help you move the bone away," Libby, who stood beside him, suggested.
<br><br>
As Zen stared at the bone, he said, "I don't need your help. I'll try it first!"
<br><br>
The member from the Celestial Wolf race scoffed at his words. "Even if you have achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body, it's only the toughness of your physical body that has increased. Your strength is still the same as before.
<br><br>
You will do it alone? Don't overestimate yourself," he sneered.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the two members of the Separate Abyss race and the Ear Mice stayed silent.
<br><br>
Although what the warrior of the Celestial Wolf race had said was unpleasant to hear, it was true.
<br><br>
It was indeed a miracle that Zen had achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body. It broke the rules that existed since after the ancient times.
<br><br>
However, the amount of power he could draw from the Myriad Tribulations Body shouldn't be too much. Even with the help of his Other Shore Tokens, he could only release thousands of divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
In return, Zen flashed a faint smile.
<br><br>
He pressed his hands against the huge bone, then the Civilization Artifacts in his body suddenly trembled. His power flowed through his cinnabar field and rushed towards his hands.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack…"
<br><br>
A series of crisp cracks filled the air then his fingers clasped onto the bone's surface.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mice, and the warrior from the Celestial Wolf race were all stunned at the scene.
<br><br>
They previously tried their best to move the bone away together, but the surface of the bone was too smooth and there was no place for them to grasp it.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen simply placed his fingers on the bone, and they actually penetrated its surface. How could that be? "The bones of the Sanskrit Light Stage are not as strong as I thought. I can actually break through this bone, but…" He suddenly spread out his legs, then his body unleashed a turbulent force. "But there's no need for that!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
It turned out that the power came from his inner world. It rose from his cinnabar field, split up, then gathered in both of his hands. Finally, he exerted it upon the giant bone that blocked their way.
<br><br>
When the power burst out, the members of the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mice, and the unconvinced warrior from the Celestial Wolf race all felt their bodies tremble. They were too shocked to say anything.
<br><br>
"Scratch!"
<br><br>
An ear-piercing noise that sounded like two large objects rubbing against each other rang throughout the cave, and the bone in front of Zen began to move.
<br><br>
"Scratch!"
<br><br>
At that moment, the sound of the friction became louder, until he finally pushed the huge bone out of the way! "Swoosh!"
<br><br>
The bone he just pushed away was quite large but hollow inside. When it quickly fell, there was a shrill whistle-like sound when the air flowed out of the bone's hollow interior. In the end, it fell into the sea with a splash.
<br><br>
The two members of the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mice, and the warrior of the Celestial Wolf race all stood there astounded for a long time.
<br><br>
Even Libby, who already expected that Zen could move the bone, was also dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Zen clapped his hands as if what he had done was a piece of cake. "We can go to Stage Thirty-two now," he announced.
<br><br>
Because the situation of the Oneness Sky Palace was stable, he would continue to go up until he reached Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Just as he stepped forward, two silk threads appeared out of nowhere.
<br><br>
Although he was quick to react, he still touched them! He had a bad feeling at that point.
<br><br>
Almost reflexively, he raised the Celestial Spear in his hand.
<br><br>
"Zen! What happened?" Libby asked worriedly.
<br><br>
The series of events kept surprising her every time! After Zen touched the two silk threads, he stood there motionlessly while he held the long spear.
<br><br>
No matter how many times Libby called him, he didn't seem to hear it.
<br><br>
At the same time, something was brewing in the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
A silk thread flew across from the southwest, and another one swept across from the northeast.
<br><br>
The silk threads were quite thin and weren't visible to the naked eye, but they were noticeable through sunlight.
<br><br>
"Swish…"
<br><br>
Once a thread crossed a mountain, it cut it off in half.
<br><br>
The upper half of the mountain fell with a rumbling sound. The ground within a thousand-mile radius repeatedly shook as if there was an earthquake.
<br><br>
The two silk threads converged precisely when they reached the Flow Sword Sect of the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
Afterward, the silk threads swept Zen, who was meditating in the courtyard house, off the ground. The silk threads rose above the ground with him, and not long after, he was hung high above the Oneness Mountain! The noise from the two silk threads quickly alarmed the masters in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
All the powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm including Auden, Pearce, and the others, flew to the top of the Oneness Mountain at once.
<br><br>
As soon as they saw the two crossed silk threads, they frowned.
<br><br>
"Dragon Threads!"
<br><br>
"Did someone attack Zen on the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"How impressive! Someone is actually willing to pay such a high price."
<br><br>
Auden recognized the silk threads immediately.
<br><br>
The Dragon Thread was also a considerably rare treasure on the Other Shore. It had a unique ability—it could transfer the enemy to a strange place! That place could be considered the Other Shore, but not the Other Shore in another way.
<br><br>
In addition, the body which the threads had transferred was the owner's real body, but also not the real body in another way! It was very strange! To put it plainly, Zen in the Source World was up high in the air, while the Zen in the Sanskrit Light Stage was motionless and glued to the threads.
<br><br>
In reality, however, Zen was dashing towards one direction with the Celestial Spear in his hand.
<br><br>
Clouds and mist surrounded him so no one could tell where he was, and there was an irresistible force that forced him to run.
<br><br>
Chapter 3783 The Blood Spirit Tortoise It was at this very moment that Zen grew confused and weary. The space turned out to be too strange for his understanding.
<br><br>
Oddly enough, it was not created by his illusion because it actually existed.
<br><br>
But how was he dragged here if he was just at the bone cave? "Primeval Lord of Heaven, do you know where this place is?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven scanned the vicinity in an attempt to familiarize himself.
<br><br>
"Did you touch two threads just now?"
<br><br>
"Yeah." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
"The two threads must be Dragon Threads," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.
<br><br>
"Dragon Threads? What are they? What is their use?" Zen asked rapidly.
<br><br>
Because the Other Shore Tokens of mysterious type were too complicated, it was notably impossible to guard against them.
<br><br>
"Think of the Dragon Thread as a space treasure. Once it is activated, it can pull you into a special space," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered.
<br><br>
"It took me into a different space? So you're saying that I'm no longer in the Sanskrit Light Stage?" Zen gasped.
<br><br>
"You are there, but you are not," the Primeval Lord of Heaven responded calmly.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen paced back and forth, trying to understand.
<br><br>
"Let me ask you first. Where exactly were you when you were in the Sanskrit Light Stage? Were you specifically in the Bloom Divine Province or just the Sanskrit Light Stage?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, looking at Zen with a suspicious expression.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to speak, he hesitated. He then opened his mouth to speak again. "I...I believe I was in both of them..."
<br><br>
During this time, Zen's corporeal body actually existed in the Bloom Divine Province, while another body existed on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"So what if there exists a place within a place? For example, an Other Shore of the Other Shore?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke slowly, making sure Zen absorbed each and every word.
<br><br>
In fact, the Dragon Thread was connected to a special space, and this was merely demonstrated as an Other Shore within the Other Shore.
<br><br>
When they first discovered the Dragon Thread and its properties, many powerful warriors of the Eternal Realm travelled far and wide to collect it, hoping to find its secrets within the space.
<br><br>
To their surprise, the space was completely empty, which left them to assume that the Other Shore within the Other Shore was meaningless.
<br><br>
Because the powerful warriors of the Eternal Realm were all geniuses, someone eventually discovered the use of the Dragon Thread. Apparently, it could help the activator send his or her opponent into the space.
<br><br>
With full training and understanding, one could even utilize the Dragon Thread to not only bring his opponent to the space, but also kill him. This was most probably the most significant feature of the Dragon Thread.
<br><br>
Once he heard the explanation of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Zen pursed his lips. "Are you telling me that I have an opponent waiting for me at the end of the space?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded once. "I believe so."
<br><br>
"Well, who is it? Is it an Other Shore creature?" Zen asked persistently.
<br><br>
"Not necessarily," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered monotonously.
<br><br>
"The Dragon Thread is quite strange. It can be activated by creatures in the chaos, as well as by creatures on the Other Shore. However, if it was activated by a creature in the chaos, something must have been wrong with your physical body in the Bloom Divine Province already."
<br><br>
Zen had no idea that his body was already pulled up into the air. The powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, including Pearce and Auden, rose into the air and floated beside "Zen" as well.
<br><br>
Confusion and anxiety were written all over their faces.
<br><br>
"Zen is now in the Land of Bone Tribulation. If that is so, who is in the Sanskrit Light Stage?" Pearce asked almost as if he was screaming. His voice spread out like thunder, demanding a response.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Athemar flew straight up and bowed to Pearce. "I heard that the passage in the Sanskrit Light Stage was destroyed. Libby is the only one member of the Oneness Sky Palace who remains in the Sanskrit Light Stage."
<br><br>
"Wake her up then," Pearce spat.
<br><br>
If this were any other day, they would never wake up Libby, especially because she was a well-respected genius.
<br><br>
But this moment was different, not to mention Zen was too important to the Oneness Sky Palace, so that they could not take a risk. They had no choice but to wake up the warrior from her meditation.
<br><br>
Just as Athemar was about to wake up Libby, they caught her floating towards them. She fixed her eyes right at Zen, who remained up in the air.
<br><br>
Her face was filled with astonishment.
<br><br>
"So Zen is also entangled by the threads here?" Libby scoffed.
<br><br>
"What on earth happened on the Other Shore?" Pearce asked again, unable to understand the entire situation.
<br><br>
"After Zen moved the bone away, he ended up touching the two threads..."
<br><br>
Libby continued on to explain to them what had occurred in the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
After they heard the whole story, Auden frowned. "Well, it is good news that Zen has cultivated the Myriad Tribulations Body. However, whoever dared to use the Dragon Threads must have been fully prepared. I'm afraid only a strong opponent exists in that space."
<br><br>
Pearce shook his head in helplessness. He expected Zen's opponent to be no less than an Eternal Warrior of the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Moreover, now that the Dragon Threads appeared in the Bloom Divine Province, it only meant one thing: the one who set up the threads was a member of the chaos.
<br><br>
Just as Pearce tried to guess who that might be, a huge shadow appeared in the sky, right above the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
Everyone looked up and their jaws dropped. It was a giant red tortoise.
<br><br>
As they observed, they saw that the edge of the tortoise's shell was serrated.
<br><br>
Its eyes emitted strong killing intent, making anyone who looked at it uncomfortable.
<br><br>
"The Blood Spirit Tortoise!"
<br><br>
"One of the ten most ferocious beasts in the chaos!"
<br><br>
"Why is its shadow projected here?"
<br><br>
The powerful warriors of all the other mountains also gathered and looked at the magnificent Blood Spirit Tortoise that hovered in the sky.
<br><br>
Among all top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos, the Blood Spirit Tortoise was one that rarely appeared. Over the years, people had only seen it one or two times, and no one knew its standpoint.
<br><br>
It was also said that the Blood Spirit Tortoise was not merely a creature, as it carried an entire city on its back. On the shell of the tortoise resided the Blood Spirit race.
<br><br>
Perhaps the fact that the Blood Spirit race lived on its back was the main reason the Blood Spirit Tortoise did not appear often. However, despite this, their strength could not be underestimated.
<br><br>
"Look at this. Such losers of the Oneness Sky Palace..." the Blood Spirit Tortoise said. "From now on, the Bloom Divine Province is under my authority. If you don't want to die, kneel down to save your damn lives!"
<br><br>
Its voice echoed like thunder, and it spread throughout the entire Bloom Divine Province with a roaring vibration.
<br><br>
The trillions of people in the Bloom Divine Province pointed at the sky, horrified and worried. Among them, the cowardly ones actually got down on their knees just as the tortoise ordered.
<br><br>
Previously, the Sun Crow race failed to occupy the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, the Element Spirit race did not give up.
<br><br>
However, both Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer feared the strength of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Though the Element Spirit race ordered them to take over the Bloom Divine Province and attack Zen, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race did not budge at all.
<br><br>
It was through the death of Emperor Charm that they knew about the energy souls released by Zen.
<br><br>
After he passed the test of the Soul City, Zen made his way to the Land of Bone Tribulation.
<br><br>
This was the reason for the Element Spirit race and Yellow Thearch's plan.
<br><br>
They ordered the Blood Spirit Tortoise to place the Dragon Threads that would confine Zen at the Other Shore of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
As long as the energy souls were not released, only the powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm were left in the Bloom Divine Province. These warriors were not enough to put up a battle against the warriors of the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Chapter 3784 Intimidate After the battle against the Sun Crow race, the Oneness Sky Palace had immediately made plans and strategies in case other powerful races invaded them again.
<br><br>
Pearce, Auden, and the other elders also knew that things destined to happen would happen sooner or later.
<br><br>
Now, the core of all their plans was Zen.
<br><br>
The plan was to use the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's energy soul inside Zen's body, to control the physical body of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. That way, the resulting power would be much stronger than that of their Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself.
<br><br>
Of course, the current Oneness Sky Palace didn't rely on Eastern Emperor Taiyi alone.
<br><br>
Not long ago, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess wanted to invite the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace to move to the Pear Hill temporarily when they visited the Oneness Sky Palace. Yet, Zen summoned Ziya, who had lived for over a thousand chaotic eras, to descend to the Source World.
<br><br>
In turn, Ziya promised to guard the Oneness Sky Palace in time of danger.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Oneness Sky Palace felt assured.
<br><br>
In the eyes of Pearce and Auden, the Oneness Sky Palace was probably much stronger now that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ziya guarded the place, than when Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were in charge.
<br><br>
The only thing was, the presence of Ziya and the control of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's body both needed Zen.
<br><br>
But Zen was still trapped in the Dragon Threads. No one knew if he could leave the Other Shore inside the Other Shore alive, more so if he could release the energy soul or summon Ziya to descend.
<br><br>
Pearce, Auden, and the other powerful warriors from the Oneness Sky Palace all shared dark looks.
<br><br>
"Is it only the Blood Spirit Tortoise that invaded the Bloom Divine Province?" Auden asked. "Why do you ask that?" Pearce countered.
<br><br>
"If the powerful warriors at the Eternal Realm from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race are here, then why did they have to use the Blood Spirit Tortoise to threaten us?" Auden asked again. The Blood Spirit Tortoise was considered one of the top ten ferocious beasts in the chaos and it was indeed very powerful.
<br><br>
Compared to Emperor Charm, however, both of them had the same level of strength.
<br><br>
If the Blood Spirit Tortoise didn't have anything to hold it back and had already taken the other powerful warriors at the Eternal Realm to the Bloom Divine Province, they would've landed at the Oneness Mountain by now.
<br><br>
However, the Blood Spirit Tortoise had hidden in some place that no one knew where.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it projected its shadow for everyone to see. It must be fearing something.
<br><br>
"It is still afraid of Eastern Emperor Taiyi," said Pearce with a gleam in his eyes.
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit Tortoise was not willing to work for Yellow Thearch in the first place. It came only because it had no choice but to follow the orders.
<br><br>
It turned out that Pearce was right: the Blood Spirit Tortoise was indeed afraid of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
To his credit, Eastern Emperor Taiyi did kill Emperor Charm.
<br><br>
Therefore, the reason it released the shadow was not only to intimidate everyone but also to test the waters.
<br><br>
"Since it is afraid of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, let's frighten it," Auden suggested.
<br><br>
With that, he took a deep breath, and his originally wrinkled body became as plump as a ball.
<br><br>
The ball-shaped Auden floated high in the sky and roared, "If you have the guts, then bring it on! Why use the shadow to threaten us and make a fool of yourself?"
<br><br>
After he spat out those words, his inflated body quickly shrank back and became thin once again.
<br><br>
It took a long time before the Blood Spirit Tortoise finally heard his voice.
<br><br>
Upon hearing such confident words, the Blood Spirit Tortoise didn't dare to risk its life. It thought for a moment then sneered, "As far as I know, that human boy's energy souls are things that descend from the Other Shores after he carried them. If he dies, the Other Shore Tokens he has will be gone as well!"
<br><br>
It referred to the fact that after Zen had carried the Civilization Artifacts, their fates became tied to each other.
<br><br>
Although the energy souls could leave Zen's physical body, once he died, the Civilization Artifacts would still be destroyed. The energy souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others would be gone as well.
<br><br>
It seemed that his death would solve everything once for all! At that moment, both Pearce and Auden fell silent.
<br><br>
The powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, such as Athemar, Libby, Winchell, and the others, also realized the problem. Since the Blood Spirit Tortoise had set up the Dragon Threads, then Zen's opponent would also be the Blood Spirit Tortoise.
<br><br>
"Then I'll do what you want!"
<br><br>
Just as the strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace were still worried, the Blood Spirit Tortoise roared and the surroundings suddenly changed.
<br><br>
Smoke clouds filled the air, and a blurry figure moved quickly amidst them.
<br><br>
It was none other than Zen, who got sucked into the Other Shore inside the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Of course, he didn't know that his body was hung up in the air of the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had warned him, so he understood that what he was about to face was not an ordinary Other Shore creature, nor a powerful warrior at the Holy Soul Realm. It was most likely a warrior at the Eternal Realm or even one from the Element Spirit race! Though he had achieved the Holy Soul and the Myriad Tribulations Body, he hadn't entered the Eternal Scroll Painting. Naturally, he felt greatly pressured to fight a warrior at the Eternal Realm. There was almost no chance of winning in a one-on-one battle.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, it has been a long time since the Celestial Spear was repaired. How many times can my strength be magnified?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Right now, he could mostly depend on the Chaotic Source Spirits after they went through the division. His body could release up to one hundred thousand divine megatons of force with the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Combined with the Celestial Spear, he could further increase his strength.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven glanced at the spear and found that the light inside the originally dim tip of the spear had recovered a bit. "About three or four times," he estimated.
<br><br>
"Three or four times..." Zen nodded slightly.
<br><br>
At that point, the clouds in front of him slowly dissipated, and he felt a strong deathly aura.
<br><br>
Then, a huge red turtle's shadow gradually revealed itself from the clouds.
<br><br>
"A giant red turtle, is this the Blood Spirit Tortoise?" Zen muttered and raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was not a warrior of this round of chaos, so he naturally didn't know the giant turtle.
<br><br>
After Zen had entered the Source World, he gained a good understanding of these well-known fierce beasts. This great blood-red tortoise could only be the Blood Spirit Tortoise! "Hiss! Hiss…"
<br><br>
Two Dragon Threads on the back of the Blood Spirit Tortoise rolled like mad.
<br><br>
The Dragon Threads, which no one knew where they began and where they ended, turned out to be the two streams of force that pulled Zen forward.
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit Tortoise stared at Zen, who was rapidly approaching and let out a strange laugh. "Are you the little guy who gave the Element Spirit race a headache? Let's see if you're worth fighting!"
<br><br>
As soon as it finished speaking, streaks of blood light flashed on its back.
<br><br>
The blood-red light spread from its shell and quickly gathered in its head.
<br><br>
Then, its whole head turned crimson, and the mass of energy accumulated on its mouth.
<br><br>
When it opened its mouth and spat out, copious streaks of blood-colored lightning flew towards Zen's body and painted him red! "Crack! Crack…"
<br><br>
As the torrent of blood-red lightning washed down on him, he looked like a small leaf in a hurricane as his body tumbled up and down.
<br><br>
The mighty warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace watched the scene with horrified eyes. Every time the blood-red lightning exploded, their hearts pounded in their chests.
<br><br>
"Zen has already achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body. He can surely withstand it..." Libby mumbled nervously and clenched her fists.
<br><br>
Each streak of the blood-red lightning contained power as much as eighty thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit Tortoise thought that Zen was weak and couldn't withstand even three strikes, although he had achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body.
<br><br>
It didn't expect that even though eighty thousand divine megatons of force was powerful, it wasn't enough to break Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Chapter 3785 Could Do Nothing To Him Every time the blood-red lightning struck Zen's body, the Truth of Godly Way surged and flowed through his limbs and bones in waves.
<br><br>
The Truth of Godly Way surged around his body and brought the weakened Chaotic Source Spirits back to life.
<br><br>
Dozens of blood-red lightning bolts struck his body in a row and made him look immensely dangerous. When the Blood Spirit Tortoise looked at Zen, its huge blood red eyes widened in shock.
<br><br>
"He's… completely unharmed? How is that possible?"
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit Tortoise couldn't believe what it saw! Since Zen had just obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body, he could only bear a limited power of about ninety thousand divine megatons. After he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting and reached the Eternal Realm, he could further increase his strength.
<br><br>
Therefore, the blood-red lightning strike could still tear his body into pieces, even if it couldn't kill him. Yet he was completely unscathed.
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit Tortoise had seen such a strange occurrence before.
<br><br>
The Holy Soul Realm masters, who had fused with the Chaotic Source Spirits, were the same with general injuries. The Chaotic Source Spirits in their bodies absorbed the power unleashed upon them, so their bodies remained unharmed.
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit Tortoise had always loathed those powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm. They weren't qualified to enter the Land of Bone Tribulation, nor were they exceptional or strong enough.
<br><br>
Although they could use the Chaotic Source Spirits to make up for their physical bodies' weaknesses and even create a realm called the "Chaotic Source Realm", all of those simply served to cover up their flaws.
<br><br>
Even those masters at the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm could only bear about twenty thousand divine megatons of force. They weren't worth mentioning at all.
<br><br>
"It's impossible! It can't be the Chaotic Source Spirits!"
<br><br>
The maximum power that the Chaotic Source Spirits could bear was quite low, and they definitely couldn't withstand about eighty thousand divine megatons of power.
<br><br>
But why was Zen still uninjured after the blood-red lightning had hit him? "You can try again," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
He noticed that the Blood Spirit Tortoise got a little impatient, so he deliberately provoked it.
<br><br>
As long as the Blood Spirit Tortoise's attacks didn't exceed a force of one hundred thousand divine megatons, it wouldn't cause him substantial damage.
<br><br>
Even if its power did exceed one hundred thousand divine megatons, his newly acquired Myriad Tribulations Body could still endure it.
<br><br>
Furthermore, his Myriad Tribulations Body had nine Holy Soul Imprints, which made it more powerful than an ordinary Myriad Tribulations Body.
<br><br>
Despite that, he did not forget that he was still trapped on the Other Shore of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was highly likely that the Blood Spirit Tortoise couldn't do anything to him, but it was also difficult for him to kill it.
<br><br>
His greatest chance at killing it lay on the Celestial Spear in his hand. The spear could increase his strength by about four times now, but he could only use it once.
<br><br>
He only had one chance. He hoped that he could hit his opponent in one spear strike! At that point, the Blood Spirit Tortoise increased its guard. After all, it didn't believe that Zen could resist the lightning it spat out without sustaining any injuries.
<br><br>
It thought that Zen must have a special method to save his life, but no matter what magical method it was, there were still limits.
<br><br>
He couldn't withstand everything infinitely.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom"
<br><br>
The thicker blood-red lightning rushed towards Zen.
<br><br>
The blood-red lightning spread around Zen until an area with the radius of ten thousand feet looked like a purgatory.
<br><br>
Regardless of how powerful the creatures present were, it was hard for them to stay safe in that area.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen had survived.
<br><br>
Above the Oneness Sky Palace Pearce, Auden, and the others also watched the scene with undivided attention. "Is this the strength of the Myriad Tribulations Body?" Pearce asked in surprise.
<br><br>
Although Pearce and the rest never had the chance to cultivate the Myriad Tribulations Body their whole lives, they knew how powerful the Myriad Tribulations Body was, since they had stayed in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore for a long time.
<br><br>
The Myriad Tribulations Body itself served to strengthen one's physical body, unlike the Chaotic Source Spirits, which made one's physical body invincible to a certain extent.
<br><br>
In other words, if a force of over ten thousand divine megatons hit a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, the warrior would remain unharmed.
<br><br>
However, if that same power struck a warrior with the Myriad Tribulations Body, the warrior might sustain slight injuries.
<br><br>
"It is impossible!" Auden shook his head firmly and said, "The Myriad Tribulations Body couldn't be unscarred in such a situation. Perhaps he has relied on the Chaotic Source Spirits to absorb so many divine megatons of power..."
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source Spirits?"
<br><br>
Pearce, Athemar, and many powerful warriors from the Oneness Sky Palace were stunned.
<br><br>
"It's true," Winchell stated. "It seems that Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits have absorbed all the energy..." he trailed off.
<br><br>
"The Blood Spirit Tortoise is one of the ten fiercest beasts of the chaos, and it can casually launch an attack with at least seventy thousand divine megatons of force! Do you mean that Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits are so strong that they could bear such a large amount of power?" Pearce asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
Many of the Holy Soul Realm warriors present had already cultivated the Chaotic Source Spirits to the extremes.
<br><br>
They could bear twenty-five thousand divine megatons of power at most with the help of other body protection treasures and cultivation methods, and that was the limit. It was common sense.
<br><br>
So, the meaning of Pearce's words was very simple—no matter how powerful Zen was, he couldn't withstand such a strong force with only the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Winchell just shrugged and said, "I don't know the specific reason, but from his performance, it's true."
<br><br>
After all, there were many strange things that had happened to Zen.
<br><br>
And so, it didn't seem odd for something strange to happen to him again.
<br><br>
"Elder Pearce, regardless, it's still advantageous as Zen could resist the Blood Spirit Tortoise's attack," Libby suddenly reminded.
<br><br>
Because what happened just now was too unusual, no one paid attention to the core issue.
<br><br>
Zen swayed back and forth in the streaks of blood-red lightning, but in the end, he was still unharmed.
<br><br>
"That's right. Although the Blood Spirit Tortoise can't do anything to Zen, Zen can't do anything to it either. I wonder if he can break free from it,"
<br><br>
Auden commented.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, a bolt of blood-red lightning hit Zen hard and he bounced upwards.
<br><br>
"A chance?"
<br><br>
In turn, Zen quickly jumped up, turned into a meteor, and flew towards the Blood Spirit Tortoise.
<br><br>
"You little human, how dare you fight back? Scram!" the Blood Spirit Tortoise hissed.
<br><br>
It opened its huge mouth and spat out blood-red lightning again.
<br><br>
The thick, blood-red lightning whipped and lashed at Zen several times and sent him flying more than ten thousand feet away.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen stabilized his body, and with narrowed eyes, he retorted, "You are just a coward. You aren't strong at all, but you have the gall to make such reckless remarks. It's ridiculous!"
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Blood Spirit Tortoise, Zen was just a nobody that the Element Spirit race ordered it to eliminate.
<br><br>
Thus, it was enraged when an unimportant being like Zen mocked it. It immediately spewed out lightning to consume the unknown body protection theurgy on Zen's body out of infuriation.
<br><br>
However, its series of attacks did not affect Zen at all. Instead, he just laughed at it. How could it tolerate him? In the end, it lost its patience in anger. It suddenly opened its mouth, which revealed rows of fangs, with blood-red lightning bolts that surrounded them.
<br><br>
"Do you really think I can't do anything to you? I'm going to swallow you!"
<br><br>
The moment the Blood Spirit Tortoise finished speaking, its head abruptly extended from its turtle shell and dashed towards Zen like a long dragon.
<br><br>
Chapter 3786 The Might Of A Spear Strike Head to head with the Blood Spirit Tortoise's huge mouth, Zen didn't flinch at all.
<br><br>
He was well aware that it would not be an easy task to kill the Blood Spirit Tortoise, but he could also tell it wasn't good at attacking. It might've ranked first among the top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos, when it came to the defensive power.
<br><br>
If Zen wanted to kill it with a single strike, he'd have to wait for the perfect opportunity.
<br><br>
Combating the tortoise head on made his chances extremely slim, but Zen was never the type to back down in the face of adversity.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen's trick to mock the beast had successfully infuriated it, enticing the Blood Spirit Tortoise to devour him.
<br><br>
Zen smiled wryly. Most of the time, an excellent opportunity could only be found in the midst of great danger! Zen pretended he was incapable of dodging, and allowed himself to be swallowed by the Blood Spirit Tortoise in one gulp without much of a fight.
<br><br>
The eyes of the Blood Spirit Tortoise glowed red. Then, all the lightning flowing through its body streamed through its neck, until it was all gathered in its mouth.
<br><br>
The beast was confident it could kill anyone, once it had them in its mouth — even if it were an Eternal Realm master.
<br><br>
A silence fell over the Oneness Sky Palace as they witnessed Zen being swallowed alive.
<br><br>
Just moments earlier, they had felt a sliver of hope. But now that he had just been devoured by the Blood Spirit Tortoise, everyone fell into the depths of despair.
<br><br>
However, Libby was able to shake off her feelings of hopelessness and snapped back to reality. Pulling her gaze away from the illusion, her eyes landed on Zen's real body. Hope surged within her once more.
<br><br>
"Don't worry! Zen is fine!" Libby reminded the others excitedly.
<br><br>
If a warrior's Soul of Light got injured on the Other Shore, their soul in the Source World would be injured similarly.
<br><br>
However, if one's Soul of Light was completely destroyed on the Other Shore, then this creature would lose soul in the Source World, rendering them a simpleton.
<br><br>
Such instances weren't rare.
<br><br>
The same problem existed for those who entered the Other Shore in their physical forms. If their physical forms on the Other Shore were injured, their physical bodies in the Source World would suffer equally.
<br><br>
As Libby had pointed out, Zen's body in the Source World remained unscathed. This meant he was unharmed even from within the Blood Spirit Tortoise's mouth! With rumbles of thunder, the red bolts of lightning exploded inside the mouth of the Blood Spirit Tortoise.
<br><br>
The red lightning wrapped around Zen tightly, surrounding him with an unimaginable amount of energy.
<br><br>
At this point, the power of the energy flow had already exceeded one hundred thousand divine megatons of force. Not even the Chaotic Source Spirits could withstand this much energy! Crack! The Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's body were exhausted by this attack, even though it all happened in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Without the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits, the surface of Zen's body was immediately scorched. Gritting his teeth, he felt something he hadn't felt in a long time — pain.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits were not completely fused with warriors' physical bodies. In essence, they were like an enchanted barrier or a shield.
<br><br>
Once they were exhausted, they would completely lose their effect. Now that Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits were all used up, he had nothing protecting his bare flesh from the red energy flow.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen had achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body. Additionally, he had also obtained nine Bone Tribulation Imprints to enhance his body.
<br><br>
Although he was in excruciating pain, his body wasn't completely destroyed. Still, when the people of the Oneness Sky Palace noticed Zen's physical body started to turn black from the injuries incurred on the Other Shore, they felt their hopes fall once more.
<br><br>
If it were any other warrior being swallowed by the Blood Spirit Tortoise, they would have been dead by now.
<br><br>
However, the power of Zen's special Truth of Godly Way quickly rejuvenated his Chaotic Source Spirits. The reverse vortex in his body whirled, continuously transferring the damage he was taking to another space.
<br><br>
By now, the Blood Spirit Tortoise was astounded that Zen was still alive.
<br><br>
When the Element Spirit race entrusted this task to the beast, initially, it had felt nothing but confusion.
<br><br>
Was a young human really worth the trouble? Was there really any need to use the Dragon Thread? But now, even the Blood Spirit Tortoise had to admit it had underestimated this human! If this human were to reach Stage Thirty-two on the Other Shore and enter the Eternal Scroll Painting in the future, how powerful would he become? "I must admit, I'm surprised you're still alive," the voice of the Blood Spirit Tortoise echoed in its mouth. "But now that you're trapped in my mouth, you won't be able to escape death. No matter how hard you struggle, it's futile."
<br><br>
Crack! As the voice echoed, the red lightning continued zapping at Zen. Soon, Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits were exhausted once again.
<br><br>
A current of energy flow swept past the surface of his body, leaving several deep cuts on his body. Blood spurted out from his wounds, causing Zen to wince in pain.
<br><br>
While his body in the Sanskrit Light Stage bled profusely, so did his body in the Source World.
<br><br>
Rolling on the tongue of the beast, Zen narrowly dodged a string of red bolts of lightning. With a smile, he exclaimed, "Well, I don't think my struggles will be in vain!"
<br><br>
The moment he finished speaking, he leapt upward.
<br><br>
As the Chaotic Source Spirits recovered, Zen summoned all the power within his body.
<br><br>
This whole time, he had been on the defense only because he was looking for the right position.
<br><br>
Once he had found it, he hesitated no further, channeling all the power within his inner world to the Celestial Spear.
<br><br>
As the Celestial Stone increased his power by four times, Zen's force reached a terrifying amount of six hundred thousand divine megatons. At this point, the Blood Spirit Tortoise began to sense that something was wrong. 'How the hell does this human possess such a great power?!' it wondered as fear seized every fiber of its being.
<br><br>
It realized with great regret that it should never have devoured this human! However, it was too late for the Blood Spirit Tortoise to respond.
<br><br>
In the confused eyes of the people of Oneness Sky Palace, they watched as the Blood Spirit Tortoise opened its mouth in a hurry, as though trying to spit out the hot potato it had just swallowed.
<br><br>
However, before it could even fully open its mouth, a formidable beam of spear radiance pierced through its head from inside.
<br><br>
Five to six hundred thousand divine megatons of force was more than enough to pierce through nearly everything! A large hole with a diameter of several thousand feet appeared in the head of the Blood Spirit Tortoise. Its huge red eyes quickly dimmed, and its head drooped to the side of the turtle shell, lifeless.
<br><br>
After Zen crawled out of the big hole, the Blood Spirit Tortoise fell into the bottom of the space shrouded in clouds, and the projection of the illusion in the Bloom Divine Province also disappeared.
<br><br>
Swish! In the Sanskrit Light Stage of the Other Shore, the two threads in the bone cave suddenly disappeared, and Zen, who had been stuck to them, fell to the ground.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the sky above the Oneness Sky Palace, the two threads that strung up Zen's body in the air suddenly disappeared, and all at once, Zen's body fell from the sky.
<br><br>
The people below gasped. On the other hand, Athemar acted quickly and flew up to catch Zen. Gently, he placed him on his flying sword.
<br><br>
As for the other powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, they were still too stunned to react.
<br><br>
"So, the Blood Spirit Tortoise was killed by Zen... just like that?" Pearce asked, clearly still bewildered.
<br><br>
"I suppose so... Killing it on the Other Shore is the same as killing it in the chaos," Auden nodded to confirm.
<br><br>
"Then, that would make him the new Eternal Realm master of our Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
"No, he hasn't reached the Eternal Realm yet. But, he's strong enough to kill one!"
<br><br>
"Zen's a legend!"
<br><br>
The warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace all at once began to cheer loudly.
<br><br>
Since ancient times, the Eternal Realm masters had been the most powerful beings in the chaos.
<br><br>
Every time an Eternal Realm master in the chaos died, it meant one gone in the batch of limited number. However, it had been a well-known fact that only an Eternal Realm master could kill another at the said realm! Now, Zen had performed an impossible miracle! Many warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace surrounded Athemar's sword, excitedly waiting for Zen to wake up.
<br><br>
But even after a long while, Zen still showed no signs of consciousness.
<br><br>
"Libby, go and have a look!" Athemar demanded. His brows furrowed, he was worried that Zen might've encountered more troubles on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Libby quickly sat cross-legged on Athemar's huge sword as she activated her Truth of Godly Way and returned to the Other Shore. To her surprise, Zen was holding the Celestial Spear at the spot, with a trace of helplessness on his face.
<br><br>
Since he was in his physical form, Zen had been unable to put away the Celestial Spear. He had been waiting helplessly for Libby to return to the Other Shore and leave the spear in her care before he could leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chapter 3787 Exit It was not until he left the Other Shore that Zen discovered the Blood Spirit Tortoise had projected an illusion of their fight into the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
When he awoke, Pearce and the others gathered around him. Some asked how it went, while others were more concerned about his injuries.
<br><br>
When these powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace had faced Zen in the past, they looked at him as elders looked at the younger generations. But now, there was a reverence within them that only appeared when they looked upon a powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Many disciples in the Land of Sword Grief had already flown over and landed in the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
Milo, Chaim and the others were among them, all watching from afar.
<br><br>
Those surrounding Zen were all core figures of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were not even permitted to approach him.
<br><br>
"It hasn't been long since Zen left Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, has it?" Chaim asked as he sighed heartily. He had wondered when Zen would return to Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, but it turned out he had already reached Stage Thirty-one.
<br><br>
The corners of Milo's mouth twitched slightly at Chaim's words and his eyes unintentionally fell on Libby. After waking Zen from the Other Shore, Libby had taken a step back from the commotion.
<br><br>
Right now, even a genius like her could do little more than retreat to the side.
<br><br>
She had her back to Milo and her thick straight hair fell on her thin shoulders, looking a little dejected.
<br><br>
Milo was still a junior, but he followed a similar path to Libby.
<br><br>
If the Oneness Sky Palace continued to operate steadily, once Libby left the Land of Sword Grief, Milo would most likely be her replacement and the next promising talent in the land.
<br><br>
But any light they shone was not worth mentioning with Zen around. They were like fireflies competing with the sun, and so Milo understood how Libby felt.
<br><br>
To the southeast of the Dragon Cliff, the endless mountains and forests were shrouded in a poisonous miasma.
<br><br>
Ordinary people, and even powerful warriors of the Other Shore Realm, had no choice but to take necessary precautions when entering the mountains.
<br><br>
But the savage alien races that lived here had adapted to it and most of them were poisonous creatures themselves anyway.
<br><br>
This was why the people of the Bloom Divine Province did not go to the southeast. They simply guarded the Dragon Cliff to prevent the savage alien races from invading.
<br><br>
Not long ago, a giant creature had come to this place.
<br><br>
The savage alien races, famous for their ferocity, stopped fighting endlessly among themselves and instead aimed at this giant creature.
<br><br>
The most ferocious race among the savage alien races led the attack.
<br><br>
But the elites of the savage race were trampled to powder in a single step.
<br><br>
The rest of them had never imagined such a powerful being would ever exist here. In fear, they scattered like birds and beasts and hid, observing the giant creature's movements in secret.
<br><br>
Earlier today, they had seen two threads extending straight into the sky.
<br><br>
A while later, the giant creature's head suddenly stretched out and smashed into the ground and the strong soul aura began dissipating.
<br><br>
Had it died? Such a powerful being died so silently? The Blood Spirit race, who lived on the back of the tortoise, were more shocked than the savage alien races.
<br><br>
They had relied on the Blood Spirit Tortoise for generations, it also being the figure of their faith.
<br><br>
That it would one day die had never even crossed their minds.
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit Tortoise's soul aura dissipated and stunned everyone still and silent. Once they came to terms with what had happened, they then began wailing and whining bitterly.
<br><br>
They were still stuck in grief when the savage alien races lurking in the forest began making their move.
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit Tortoise was a powerful being whose body was full of treasures.
<br><br>
Now that its aura was completely gone, it was obvious its soul had been destroyed. How could the ferocious savage alien races miss this opportunity? Countless creatures surged out of the poisonous miasma from all directions.
<br><br>
The Blood Spirit race had no choice but to fight. Although their race was powerful, they couldn't match the savage alien races charging over like a tsunami.
<br><br>
This time, the Blood Spirit Tortoise's attack on Zen made the members of the Oneness Sky Palace nervous, and at the same time confused.
<br><br>
It now seemed that the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits that could summon Other Shore creatures, were indeed very important to the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
From what they knew of the Element Spirit race, they would not let this opportunity slide.
<br><br>
They could have sent powerful warriors like Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer to fight. If these powerful warriors of the Eternal Realm joined forces, the Oneness Sky Palace would not be able to compete with them.
<br><br>
But the fact was that all the Element Spirit race had done was to bring the Blood Spirit Tortoise here. Moreover, the Blood Spirit Tortoise had only used the Dragon Threads in an attempt to take Zen's life.
<br><br>
It seemed that Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch didn't have many resources to use. Either that or they had something more important to do.
<br><br>
These were of course just the speculations of Pearce and the others.
<br><br>
In Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, Pearce and the others had also sent a message about the Blood Spirit Tortoise to the powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm from the Pear Hill, so those of the Holy Soul Realm could then pass the information to the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.
<br><br>
In addition to collecting information, Pearce and the others had also gone to the star rings of the Grand Plain Stage, Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, to receive Zen in person.
<br><br>
Zen returned to the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
Of course, the Ear Mice and the members of Separate Abyss race wouldn't wait there for Zen. After the obstacle in the passage was removed, they carefully bypassed the Dragon Threads and headed straight for the top end of the cave.
<br><br>
Libby followed Zen back to the Other Shore. She carefully removed the long spear and exclaimed, "Here you are!"
<br><br>
In the Oneness Sky Palace, she had already heard that Zen had managed to kill the Blood Spirit Tortoise, in large part due to the so-called Celestial Spear.
<br><br>
With it, he had quadrupled his own strength, meaning he now possessed five to six hundred thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
This was an absolutely astronomical number for Libby.
<br><br>
It meant Zen himself needed to release more than a hundred thousand divine megatons of force. Libby wondered how his body was able to withstand such a terrifying amount.
<br><br>
"We have to fly through the star ring later. Please keep it for me for the time being," requested Zen.
<br><br>
Libby nodded obediently and put the Celestial Spear back into her Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
Before she came to the Other Shore, she had been told several times to try her best to assist Zen.
<br><br>
Deep down, she was unsure of how to feel about this.
<br><br>
She had once been the most promising prospect in the Oneness Sky Palace, and had become a powerful warrior of the Holy Soul Realm after passing through the Soul City. But now, she had become nothing more than Zen's follower and companion, having to serve him and obey his every command.
<br><br>
However, on second thought, she remembered that if it weren't for Zen, she wouldn't have been able to pass the Blooming Jade Stage, let alone the Sanskrit Light Stage.
<br><br>
After climbing to the top of the bone cave, they arrived at the exit.
<br><br>
Outside, on the huge round platform, were many neatly arranged star rings.
<br><br>
Beside one of them, waited a powerful human warrior of the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
Chapter 3788 The First And Second Volumes Zen walked forward and respectfully folded his hands before the human Holy Soul. "Master Pearce."
<br><br>
Zen couldn't clearly see the Soul of Light clearly, but it was easy to distinguish Pearce's aura. Libby also bowed to Pearce.
<br><br>
"There's no need for such courtesies," Pearce said, waving a hand. "You've already made it this far, so we can treat each other as equals from now on."
<br><br>
In the Source World, seniority was based on strength. Pearce was treating them as peers with all honesty.
<br><br>
The only reason he had come here was to lead Zen into Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen had been able to fight powerful Eternal Realm creatures like the Blood Spirit Tortoise even before reaching the Eternal Realm. If he were to become an Eternal Warrior, wouldn't his strength advance by leaps and bounds to a terrifying level? That was why Pearce could be unbothered by the others who entered Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, but when Zen arrived, he had a discussion with the masters of the Oneness Sky Palace before going to personally meet him.
<br><br>
As the human's star ring continued to spin, the three of them turned into white light and shot towards the sky.
<br><br>
Buzz! After they emerged from the star ring, Zen looked around from force of habit.
<br><br>
The scenery he saw in each stage of the Other Shore varied greatly and he was used to it. But what he now saw shocked him.
<br><br>
When Zen looked into the distance, he saw a bronze plain.
<br><br>
"Is this the Grand Plain Stage?" Zen asked, unable to conceal his surprise.
<br><br>
It was not right to call this place a 'plain'. It was simply a huge, endless bronze iron plate, with nothing on it.
<br><br>
"No wonder it's called the Grand Plain Stage. It's really as flat as a plain,"
<br><br>
Libby said with a smile.
<br><br>
Zen noticed that the star ring had disappeared and turned around to ask, "Why did the star ring disappear?"
<br><br>
They had just been transmitted up through the star ring of the Sanskrit Light Stage, but the star ring had disappeared the moment they arrived. This greatly confused Zen.
<br><br>
Pearce had expected Zen's confusion, but he was in no hurry to explain. So he merely pointed to the ground and said, "Look at the ground. You might be able to figure out the reason."
<br><br>
As Zen's gaze lowered, he caught sight of a sculpture on the bronze ground beneath his feet. It was a star ring.
<br><br>
"Is this the star ring?" Zen was even more puzzled.
<br><br>
The sculpture on the ground was nothing more than just a painting.
<br><br>
"Yes, this is the star ring," Pearce said with a smile. "Look at the star rings around you. They are of different sizes and belong to different races."
<br><br>
Zen took a few steps forward to look at the sculptures of the star rings and realized that they were neatly distributed on the bronze ground.
<br><br>
It looked like there were many star rings here, but all of them had been pressed into the ground and turned into a picture.
<br><br>
"Why are these star rings embedded in the ground?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
"In addition to the star rings, there are many other things embedded in the ground," Libby said, a smile lacing her voice. "Look."
<br><br>
Zen looked down along the star rings and discovered what made this bronze plain so unique.
<br><br>
Not far from them was a vast desert, painted onto the ground. All kinds of strange monsters were on it and a temple stood at the end of the desert.
<br><br>
"Do the desert, monsters, and temple all exist?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
He began to understand these concepts bit by bit.
<br><br>
He couldn't believe that Stage Thirty-two looked like a lifeless plain, but everything in this stage had turned into a painting.
<br><br>
At this sight, Zen thought of the Eternal Scroll Painting and asked, "Is this bronze ground the so-called Eternal Scroll Painting? These creatures are all at the Eternal Realm, right?"
<br><br>
Pearce laughed. "Yes! This bronze ground is also called the Eternal Scroll Painting. It's just the second volume of the painting. The first volume is above our heads,"
<br><br>
Pearce said, pointing to the sky.
<br><br>
Zen looked up to see a colorful sky.
<br><br>
He wouldn't have discovered the mystery of it if he had thrown it a casual glance. But now, after carefully examining the sky, Zen was able to distinguish a huge rectangular scroll painting. But this scroll painting had colors swirling within it. It was nothing like the vivid sculptures of creatures with various forms on the bronze ground.
<br><br>
"You two come with me," Pearce said as he began to walk. "The Grand Plain Stage is also divided into two layers, like the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
Most creatures on the lower layer are either Other Shore creatures that live within Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, or Holy Soul Realm warriors like us. There are also many temples that have been built there."
<br><br>
As he spoke, Pearce pointed in the three directions in the distance.
<br><br>
The number of the temples in the Grand Plain Stage was huge. There were three temples just in this small area.
<br><br>
"Some Other Shore creatures are very powerful, such as these Corrosive Calamity Crabs. Even though we have reached the Holy Soul Realm, we don't dare provoke them," said Pearce, pointing at his feet.
<br><br>
Crabs were engraved on the bronze ground where he was pointing to.
<br><br>
Dozens of horse-like creatures ran helter-skelter before these Corrosive Calamity Crabs.
<br><br>
Zen observed them keenly for a while before asking, "Are the crabs chasing those horses?"
<br><br>
"They are Cloud Pattern Horses," Pearce said, nodding. "The Corrosive Calamity Crabs like capturing these horses as their prey. The Cloud Pattern Horses run fast but they just can't escape the Corrosive Calamity Crabs."
<br><br>
Zen frowned as he thought over what Pearce had told him. "But the sculptures on the ground don't change at all. How do they move in this scroll painting?" he questioned.
<br><br>
If these creatures could really enter the painting to live in it, then everything on the painting should be moving around. But it seemed to him that the painting was a dead thing.
<br><br>
"The painting changes from time to time," Pearce answered before something in the distance caught his eye and his expression shifted. "Looks like the change has come. What a coincidence."
<br><br>
In the far distance, a white flashing light seemed to grow closer to them. It was fast and had reached the group in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
After this light had blown over it, the painting on the bronze ground seemed to change.
<br><br>
The Cloud Pattern Horses, which had been frozen mid-run before, had now disappeared. The Corrosive Calamity Crabs had gathered together. Broken legs and heads of horses could be seen on their huge pincers.
<br><br>
These Corrosive Calamity Crabs had obviously caught the Cloud Pattern Horses and eaten them.
<br><br>
"The sculptures on the bronze ground change every hour," said Pearce.
<br><br>
"I see," Zen said, finally understanding how it worked.
<br><br>
As he walked behind Pearce, Zen saw sculptures of mountains, rivers, deserts, and even suns. All sorts of strange scenes greeted his eyes.
<br><br>
They had moved for quite some distance before the sculpture of a huge temple appeared on the ground. A three-foot-long sword sat on top of the temple. This was the temple built in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore by the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Chapter 3789 Protection Rules "How can I enter the world contained in the second volume?"
<br><br>
Zen asked after strolling around the temple.
<br><br>
The temple really existed, but it was in the form of an exquisite image before Zen's eye.
<br><br>
Zen even saw three figures at the side of the temple. Perhaps because these three people were Souls of Light, their appearance was still indistinct.
<br><br>
Pearce held out his hand, and a dazzling-white light appeared on his palm.
<br><br>
He slapped his glowing palm hard on the bronze ground, and a bright white vortex burst forth from the ground.
<br><br>
"This is the entrance," Pearce declared.
<br><br>
"The light in your hand seems to be the same as that from the distance," Zen said. The mystery had piqued his interest.
<br><br>
"Yes," Pearce nodded and said. "The light coming from afar is to lead people into the painting. Through the Light Stone, we can gather and wield this kind of light. If we need it, we can release this white vortex and gain entry into the second volume."
<br><br>
Having explained, Pearce gently turned his ring and retrieved an oval stone from his Sumeru Space. It looked like a shiny cobblestone, and emanated brilliant snow-white light.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Pearce gently tossed it at Zen and said, "All the most powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm who have entered Stage Thirty-two are required to journey to the temple and retrieve such a Light Stone. I have a spare. Here you go."
<br><br>
Zen held the Light Stone in his hand and examined it closely. Then Pearce continued, "You can try to forge an entrance."
<br><br>
"I see!" Zen nodded.
<br><br>
As the white vortex Pearce had created gradually dissipated, Zen also grabbed the Light Stone and slammed it onto the ground.
<br><br>
The light stored in the Light Stone immediately exploded from inside and struck the ground, creating a bright white vortex.
<br><br>
"You can step inside now," said Pearce, smiling.
<br><br>
As Zen entered the white vortex, the Grand Plain Stage seemed to have disappeared.
<br><br>
He had been transported to the world contained in the second volume. The sight that greeted his eyes was the temple built by the Oneness Sky Palace in Stage Thirty-two! Pearce and Libby had also followed Zen into the vortex. They materialized in the world in the scroll painting instantaneously.
<br><br>
"The world within this scroll painting is a real world," Zen said. "So, the first volume in the sky of the Grand Plain Stage is also another world?"
<br><br>
This kind of reasoning was probably not flawed. However, Pearce shook his head and disagreed, "I heard from Eastern Emperor Taiyi that there is a big difference between the two."
<br><br>
Just as Zen had seen, the second volume was yet another world. However, everything in this world was represented in 2D relief by the pictures on the bronze ground, so the first volume should be similar.
<br><br>
Most people made this deduction before they entered the world of the first volume. But, in fact, the two volumes were not alike at all.
<br><br>
The world in the first volume was a completely different landscape. All living forms were displayed in a unique form.
<br><br>
"It is like a whole person has been completely flattened into a painting, and everything in it is flat," said Pearce with a smile. "That's how Eastern Emperor Taiyi put it at that time. But unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to enter it, so I didn't have the chance to see that wondrous vista."
<br><br>
Hearing Pearce's description, Zen's eyes flashed with excitement. As soon as he was ready, he also wanted to enter the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting and discover what lay within.
<br><br>
At this point, four Souls of Light also materialized in the temple.
<br><br>
Taking the lead were none other than Auden and Athemar.
<br><br>
The world of the second volume in Stage Thirty-two was endlessly vast.
<br><br>
Almost everyone who entered the painting aspired to build a temple for their own race. After some Other Shore races had perished, the temples of their races were then abandoned there, naturally becoming places of exploration to others.
<br><br>
Many powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm of the Oneness Sky Palace were engaged in explorations of the world in the second volume, hoping to discover mightily powerful Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
In fact, the Other Shore Tokens of Stage Thirty-two were already impressive. If a warrior was lucky enough, they could even unearth a Civilization Artifact. For example, the leader of the Bright Mountain had dug up a Civilization Artifact somewhere in Stage thirty-two.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light who could enter the Grand Plain Stage were naturally the central figures of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The temple of the Oneness Sky Palace had existed in the Grand Plain Stage for so long. Although it was not as lucrative as those of the Other Shore creatures, it still contained some treasures.
<br><br>
In addition to giving Libby a Light Stone, Athemar also knocked over a wall of the temple in which, they could see a range of Other Shore Tokens embedded. A powerful aura of energy was surging within them.
<br><br>
"Although these Other Shore Tokens don't hold a candle to those in the Three Purities Stage, they are already at the top of the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
You can choose one according to your unique needs," Athemar stated.
<br><br>
The temple in Stage Four also offered Other Shore Tokens. However, there were too many disciples who entered Stage Four, so they were chosen by a selection process.
<br><br>
However, those who were able to enter the Grand Plain Stage became like the treasures of the Oneness Sky Palace, and they were rare. So, naturally, they could choose any Other Shore Token they desired among those collected in the palace.
<br><br>
At the sight of those Other Shore Tokens, Libby's eyes glowed with desire.
<br><br>
Her Other Shore Token originated from Stage Twenty-eight. If she could replace it with a fourth-grade one from the Grand Plain Stage, it would increase her strength tremendously! By comparison, Zen lacked all interest in them. After all, he had already merged with three Civilization Artifacts, and he no longer had any extra Truth of Godly Way to fuse with an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
When Libby was choosing an Other Shore Token, Zen thought of something and asked, "Primeval Lord of Heaven, since the Oneness Sky Palace can also build a temple here, then the human race must have also constructed one here, right?"
<br><br>
"Of course, we did," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile. "We had created a lot of temples. We must have left behind more than 20 temples… The human heroes like the Snake Goddess and Fuxi had been considered great forces within the 77th civilization. Upon reaching the Eternal Realm, they were naturally eager to build a temple for their own race. At that time, the human ancestor had also built a temple for the human race."
<br><br>
"Are these temples still standing in the Grand Plain Stage?" Zen asked hopefully.
<br><br>
"They've been destroyed," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, a trace of regret in his voice.
<br><br>
"Destroyed?" Zen was stunned. "If those temples were destroyed by the Element Spirit race, then why didn't they demolish the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace?"
<br><br>
At that time, the human race had been a powerful force. As a ruling force, it had been much stronger than the current super forces like the Oneness Sky Palace, the Bearing race, and the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Even the humans at that time were unable to remain in Stage Thirty-two, why did the Element Spirit race let go of the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace? "Because there exists a set of protection rules for the creatures currently in the chaos," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained. "Before the end of this round of chaos, no powerful Other Shore race, no matter whether it is the Nihility race or the Element Spirit race, can attack the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace or those of the Ear Mouse race and the Separate Abyss race."
<br><br>
Chapter 3790 The Heavy Stone It had always been difficult for a newcomer to gain a firm foothold in the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
The powerful masters that had built the Other Shore had considered this problem and as a solution, had provided a protection period of a chaotic era for the new creatures from the chaos.
<br><br>
The new races were often able to gain a firm foothold after a chaotic era had passed.
<br><br>
While this kind of protection only lasted for a chaotic era, this was enough for the new races to develop and grow.
<br><br>
Even when facing the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race, a number of Other Shore races were able to protect themselves by using the many rules of the Grand Plain Stage that were in place to protect the weak.
<br><br>
"I'll choose this Chill Rope!"
<br><br>
Libby jumped back and forth before she spotted a long, thin rope.
<br><br>
Athemar smiled faintly as he remarked, "You have really good sight, Libby.
<br><br>
This Chill Rope will be of great help to you if you can use it properly."
<br><br>
Most Other Shore Tokens in the lower stages of the Other Shore were of the strengthening type and the auxiliary type. But the ones in the higher stages of the Other Shore were more of the mysterious type.
<br><br>
All the Other Shore Tokens of the mysterious type functioned in weird, mysterious ways, which was probably what gave them their name.
<br><br>
This didn't mean that they were powerful. Some weird functions were of little value, but some others were extremely powerful, like the one Libby had chosen.
<br><br>
Once used, the Chill Rope could automatically track the opponents and effectively trap them.
<br><br>
This trap wouldn't cause their opponents to become immobile. Instead, their locations would begin to be recorded.
<br><br>
The most important detail was that if Libby were to inflict hurt on an opponent, the rope would triple the damage at the very least.
<br><br>
This meant that if Libby were to attack the opponent with her sword that contained twenty thousand divine megatons of force, her opponent would have to bear an attack of sixty thousand divine megatons of force. In a battle between powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm, such a powerful sword strike was fatal.
<br><br>
If Libby had been stronger, her sword strike could have contained close to one hundred thousand divine megatons of force, which was enough to contend with even a powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
"Zen, are you really not going to choose an Other Shore Token?" Athemar looked questioningly at Zen, a small smile playing on his lips. "Or is it that we older guys can't tempt you with them?"
<br><br>
Athemar, Pearce, and the others were desperately hoping that Zen would choose an Other Shore Token to bear.
<br><br>
After all, Zen had given the Oneness Sky Palace a lot.
<br><br>
Zen had always been a part of the Oneness Sky Palace and represented it.
<br><br>
But the Oneness Sky Palace hadn't gotten too many chances to return his favors, which was why they were now hoping that Zen would accept a gift from them.
<br><br>
"Are all of them used to carry the Civilization Artifacts?" Auden teased, smiling.
<br><br>
They could not tell how many Civilization Artifacts Zen had in his body.
<br><br>
Zen had activated the Inheritance of World when he had been in the Chaotic Source World and had later swallowed the Evil God and taken back the Rebirth Land.
<br><br>
These things had happened in Zen's inner world, but outsiders could, to a certain extent, deduce the result.
<br><br>
Zen smiled and didn't deny what he was saying. Instead, he asked, "I know that a Light Stone is needed to enter the second volume of the Grand Plain Stage. But what is needed to enter the first volume?"
<br><br>
The reason he had entered Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore was to reach the Eternal Realm. He needed the answer right now.
<br><br>
"You will also need a stone when you enter the first volume. It is similar to the Light Stone and we call it a Heavy Stone," said Pearce. "I've already told Winchell and the others to fetch a Heavy Stone for you. We will be able to send you to the Eternal Scroll Painting once we have it."
<br><br>
There were several necessary conditions to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Obtaining a Heavy Stone was one of them, and it was also the simplest.
<br><br>
Since it was possible for Zen to reach the Eternal Realm, Pearce and the others had made preparations in advance.
<br><br>
At this, Zen folded his hands in respect and acknowledged what Pearce was doing for him. "Thank you so much, sir."
<br><br>
"It's not a big deal. You're welcome," Pearce said. He thought for a while before continuing, "Getting a Heavy Stone isn't very difficult. Considering the time when they set out, they should have come back already."
<br><br>
"It's probably because the Heavy Stones haven't been picked up for many years. And Winchell and the others have never done this before, so it's normal for them to spend more time in the stone forest," said Auden.
<br><br>
Just as the two of them were talking, a ray of white light shot down from the sky to the ground before the temple.
<br><br>
Swish! The white light had barely touched the ground when a figure walked out of it.
<br><br>
Harland Zhu, a powerful warrior of the Holy Soul Realm from the Golden Mountain. He had gone to get the Heavy Stone together with Winchell.
<br><br>
But as he walked out, Harland's soul aura showed signs of decline. It was obvious that he was seriously injured.
<br><br>
He called out to them loudly as he entered the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace, "Elder Pearce! Elder Auden! Something has happened!"
<br><br>
Pearce's face darkened at this.
<br><br>
Winchell had led a group of people of the Holy Soul Realm on a quest to look for and fetch a Heavy Stone but they hadn't come back for a long time.
<br><br>
This had filled Pearce with worry.
<br><br>
Now that Harland had returned in such a state, he realized that they must have fallen into big trouble.
<br><br>
Zen and Libby frowned. Pearce hurried forward and asked, "What happened? You failed to get the Heavy Stone?"
<br><br>
"Yes! And it's not just a failure! Many powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm from our Oneness Sky Palace are trapped in the stone forest. Kendal and Dante of the Ivory Mountain have already been killed!"
<br><br>
Harland had entered the Holy Soul Realm a long time ago. He was the second strongest warrior and part of the backbone of the Golden Mountain, only second to the leader of the mountain. But now, he looked close to tears as he spoke. It was obvious that he had encountered something unusual.
<br><br>
"How can it be?" Pearce said worriedly. "Did the Element Spirit race attack you?"
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit race didn't attack us personally, but they must have been the driving force behind the Other Shore creatures. There were about a thousand Ghost Cicadas blocking us in the stone forest. And now, Winchell is trying to keep everyone sane enough to struggle to hold on!" Harland reported anxiously.
<br><br>
"Why didn't you seal the painting?" Auden asked reproachfully.
<br><br>
"I know we were careless. There has been no conflict in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore for a long time and we didn't expect them to make a move this time either," said Harland, shaking his head.
<br><br>
The second volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting was divided into a number of regions, with no way to pass between them.
<br><br>
For example, the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace was one region, and beside it was a region belonging to another race on the Other Shore. If one wanted to enter the region of that Other Shore race, they would first have to retreat from the region where the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace was located.
<br><br>
After entering a region, one could temporarily seal the region.
<br><br>
Once a region was sealed, no one could enter it by using a Light Stone to release the light. This operation was known as "sealing the painting".
<br><br>
The price of sealing the painting was extremely high. Even though the Oneness Sky Palace had been operating in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore for so long, they would still hesitate to use this method.
<br><br>
Winchell and the others had thought that it wouldn't be difficult to get a Heavy Stone.
<br><br>
But the moment they entered the stone forest, a number of ferocious beasts rushed at them in attack.
<br><br>
"So many seniors are trapped. What should we do?" Libby exclaimed anxiously.
<br><br>
Pearce frowned as he thought. He finally seemed to come to a temporary solution and said, "Let's go to the stone forest first."
<br><br>
Chapter 3791 Stone Forest The bronze ground in the Grand Plain Stage was quite vast.
<br><br>
Pearce had taken Zen and Libby all the way to the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace after they stepped out of the star ring. But in fact, they just went through a corner of the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
After returning to the bronze ground again, they marched forward for a short distance and saw a vast sea carved on the ground ahead. The sea was dotted with various small islands. Looking closer, they could also see some huge Other Shore creatures swimming within.
<br><br>
"This is the Sea of Sky Intent. As you can see, it's very large," Pearce looked around and spoke.
<br><br>
Pearce just briefly introduced the environment to Zen, because he was worried about Winchell and the others.
<br><br>
'The Sea of Sky Intent is indeed such a large area. Would it be divided into pieces like the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace?' Zen thought in his head. He felt confused and at the same, curious. All of a sudden, a white light flashed beside him.
<br><br>
Murlocs with frog feet came out of the bronze ground one by one. These Murlocs curiously sized Zen and his companions up. Each of the Murlocs stretched out their hands and gently tapped the ground with a Light Stone, releasing a white vortex. Then they jumped into the vortexes and directly headed into the sea in another region.
<br><br>
'It is indeed divided, ' Zen thought to himself. The corner of Zen's mouth curled up slightly as he realized this.
<br><br>
These Murlocs had swum to the end of the sea. Hence, if they wanted to continue forward, they had to get out and jump into the other side with the help of the Light Stones.
<br><br>
On their way north, Zen and the others encountered many Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
No fight was feasible in this area of the bronze ground, so these creatures behaved kindly. Some of them even greeted Zen and his companions as they passed by, as if they had met old acquaintances.
<br><br>
The politeness and hospitality surprised Zen.
<br><br>
After all, Stage thirty-two should be the highest stage below the Eternal Realm. The competition in this stage should be very intense. However, surprisingly, most of the creatures seemed to get along well with each other.
<br><br>
Just as Zen thought about how the atmosphere was harmonious, two Other Shore creatures from different races appeared near where he was. One appeared to be a hybrid of human and bear. His body was huge and bulky.
<br><br>
The other creature had a bull head but human body. In an instant, these two burly and strong Other Shore creatures started to break out into curses with each other.
<br><br>
They couldn't do anything on the bronze ground but provoke each other using only words. As they weren't able to fight, they asked each other to enter their own space in the scroll painting.
<br><br>
However, these Other Shore races had been operating in their own territory for a long time. Surely, they had set up a lot of internal arrays. Without enough strength, they would just basically court death if they were to get into the other's temple rashly.
<br><br>
"Quarreling like this won't solve the problem, right? Is there any way to solve the conflict in this stage?"
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but ask after they passed those two quarreling creatures.
<br><br>
"Yes," answered Auden in a somewhat disdainful tone. "In fact, there is a public area where they can fight, or even kill each other. But both of them are timid. They would just give up after quarreling for a couple of days.
<br><br>
You will get used to it after staying here for a long time." Auden's lips curled a bit as he finished his response.
<br><br>
After they continued to head north for five hundred miles, they noticed that stone-like relief sculptures appeared on the ground. Most of these stones were slender, as if they were thick trees growing into the sky.
<br><br>
"We have arrived at the stone forest!" Pearce stopped and looked around.
<br><br>
He took a careful step forward and tried to absorb his surroundings.
<br><br>
Whether it was Light Stone, Heavy Stone, or Sealing Stone, they were all found from the stone forest.
<br><br>
The stone forest could be seen as a giant mine that was accessible to all races. Many creatures of different races travelled far and searched in this forest all year round.
<br><br>
As the Light Stone was very common in the stone forest, it was the least valuable. While the Heavy Stone was much rarer and more valuable.
<br><br>
However, there weren't many other creatures that were strong enough to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting these years. The Other Shore creatures that were born in Stage Thirty-two hadn't reached the Holy Soul Realm or achieved the Myriad Tribulations Bodies. If they wanted to enter the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting, they still needed to go downwards to Stage Twenty-nine and Stage Thirty-one.
<br><br>
Although the Heavy Stones were rare, they were not in great demand.
<br><br>
Moreover, they were not difficult to obtain.
<br><br>
The most difficult stone to obtain was the Sealing Stone. Just as its name suggested, the Sealing Stone was able to completely seal off a region for a period of time. During the process of sealing, no living beings could enter or leave this region.
<br><br>
Considering this, the one who used it could protect themselves while stopping the others from leaving.
<br><br>
However, the Sealing Stone was too rare. Though Eastern Emperor Taiyi had operated here for so long, and had sent many Holy Souls to search in the stone forest, he was only able to put his hands on two Sealing Stones.
<br><br>
In fact, as the Oneness Sky Palace fought against the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race, they should know that the Element Spirit race would not let them go too easily.
<br><br>
They should have been careful when looking for Heavy Stones in such a delicate state.
<br><br>
If they had used the Sealing Stone, they wouldn't have been blocked inside by those vicious beasts.
<br><br>
As Pearce tried to figure out which area Winchell was trapped in, Auden suddenly patted him on the shoulder and said, "Pearce, watch for the left!"
<br><br>
His tone was urgent and his body turned towards the direction.
<br><br>
Everyone faced towards the left and saw a person from not so far away. It was a Holy Soul. On the surface of his soul, there were traces of cyan flames wandering. It made him appear as though he was glowing. The Holy Soul looked similar to the Sun Crow race as they both had the bloodline theurgy with fire attributes.
<br><br>
Behind him followed a large group of evil-looking Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
They marched on fiercely, each step made the ground tremble a bit. The atmosphere was suddenly tense and ill intention could almost be smelled in the air.
<br><br>
"Pearce, long time no see," the Holy Soul said with a sneer. His voice trailed off, apparently with a hint of ridicule. The Holy Soul looked at Pearce from head to toe without moving his head, using only his eyes.
<br><br>
"Fire Emissary," Pearce stared at the Holy Soul and said coldly, "are you coming to the stone forest in such a grand way to dig out Light Stones?"
<br><br>
"It's none of your business, right?" Fire Emissary answered as he chuckled.
<br><br>
"But I'm afraid that those guys who look for Heavy Stones will never be able to get out again." His tone was cold and strict, but somehow playful as if he were trying to piss Pearce off.
<br><br>
Then he wagged his finger at the ground in front of him.
<br><br>
From inside the stone forest on the ground, it could be distinguished that there were eleven people retreating to a corner. These eleven people were the group of Winchell who helped Zen search for the Heavy Stones. The group of people seemed as though they were firmly guarding a corner, and in front of them, there appeared many huge Ghost Cicadas floating in the air.
<br><br>
Pearce, Auden, and the others looked over. When they saw that Winchell was still holding on, their worries were slightly relieved. At least they were still alive. However, this was not the time to rejoice.
<br><br>
The next moment, the white flash in the distance swept over again.
<br><br>
When the white flash swept across the bronze ground, the relief sculptures on the ground were again refreshed.
<br><br>
In the stone forest, the group of Winchell retreated again. But there were only six people left.
<br><br>
Five people had already died in such a short period of time! Pearce's and Auden's faces were stricken with fear and horror. What was happening was beyond their imagination.
<br><br>
During the battle between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race, many masters at the Holy Soul Realm of the palace had been killed. The leaders of five mountains had died. Because of that instance, now, the death of any Holy Soul would be an unacceptable loss to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"The Crane Split race! The Ice lynx race! The Cyan Spirit race! Just kill all those Holy Souls!"
<br><br>
Fire Emissary gave an order maliciously. He then stretched out his hand and flicked his fingers lightly. Three Light Stones in his hand shot out three white lights that quickly turned into three vortexes. The Other Shore creatures behind him rushed towards the white vortexes and entered the stone forest.
<br><br>
Chapter 3792 Kill The creatures Fire Emissary had brought neither reached the Eternal Realm nor gained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies.
<br><br>
However, as creatures from the Grand Plain Stage, they were not weak. At the least they could put a lot of pressure on the Holy Souls.
<br><br>
The Ghost Cicadas that had been sent out earlier had already made Winchell's group struggle hard. If these three Other Shore races joined forces with them, there was no doubt they would be crushed.
<br><br>
These Other Shore creatures continued entering the white vortexes while Fire Emissary's gaze fell on Zen.
<br><br>
Obviously, he had come for Zen by the order of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
What puzzled him was that they had only ordered the Crane Split race, the Ice Lynx race and the Cyan Spirit race to attack. These three races belonged to the second tier in Stage Thirty-two and possessed ordinary strength.
<br><br>
If reports were true, Zen had killed the Blood Spirit Tortoise on the Other Shore and these three races would be far from enough to challenge him.
<br><br>
This confused Fire Emissary. He had no idea what the Element Spirit race was up to.
<br><br>
In fact, when Yellow Thearch gave him such an order in the Source World, he had outspoken his doubt. But the emperor did not explain and just ordered him to do as he was told.
<br><br>
Pearce and Auden were very hesitant when they saw the Other Shore creatures constantly drilling into the painting.
<br><br>
Zen was clearly the Fire Emissary's target and not Winchell.
<br><br>
If they entered the painting as well, they definitely wouldn't be able to save Winchell. If Zen made a move, defeating these creatures would be no problem, but he would have to stay alert to their cunning tricks.
<br><br>
In Pearce's hesitation, Zen turned around and stretched a hand to Libby.
<br><br>
"Give me the Celestial Spear," he said.
<br><br>
Libby paused a moment and then with a gentle wave of her hand, a long spear burst from her Sumeru Space and landed firmly in Zen's hand.
<br><br>
"Zen, are you really going in?" Pearce thought about dissuading him, but he couldn't stand aside and helplessly watch Winchell and the others being killed.
<br><br>
"I can't watch them die. Master Winchell was the one who brought me to the Oneness Sky Palace, and now they're in danger because they were searching for a Heavy Stone for me. How can I just stand by?"
<br><br>
Zen finished speaking and walked straight towards Fire Emissary, the Celestial Spear spinning like a rotor in his hand before he pointed it at the latter's face. "Fire Emissary, you've been famous for a long time. Do you have the guts to get into the painting as well?"
<br><br>
Fire Emissary was embarrassed, as he hadn't expected Zen to challenge him so suddenly.
<br><br>
But he didn't say a word to this junior's provocation.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't expected a response anyway, and he just jumped right into the vortex.
<br><br>
Whoosh! With the Celestial Spear in his hand, he fell into the stone forest.
<br><br>
The members of the Crane Split race, the Ice Lynx race and the Cyan Sprit race gathered up north after they entered the stone forest.
<br><br>
These three races didn't hold a high position in Stage Thirty-two, so seeking refuge with the Element Spirit race was all they could do, but even so, the Element Spirit race didn't attach great importance to them.
<br><br>
The leaders of the three races had been overjoyed to receive orders from the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
The only drawback was the Element Spirit race only allowed them to attack some Holy Souls...
<br><br>
Although these souls were strong enough to hold their own against ordinary Other Shore creatures, they were nothing compared to the three races.
<br><br>
Asking the three Other Shore races to fight was quite a fuss.
<br><br>
"Just a few Holy Souls. We Ice Lynx can deal with them. You two races should stay and rest here!"
<br><br>
"Humph! I can handle them myself!"
<br><br>
"I guess it depends on who gets there first!"
<br><br>
The members of these three races rushed to the north.
<br><br>
The topography of the stone forest was very strange. There were giant stone pillars all around that towered into the clouds.
<br><br>
On the path between the stone pillars, the corpses of Ghost Cicadas were scattered everywhere. In some places, the corpses even piled into hill-like mounds. One could only imagine how fierce the previous battles had been.
<br><br>
Behind the two huge stone pillars on the northernmost end, was a col that was easily defended but difficult to attack.
<br><br>
Five powerful Holy Souls of the Oneness Sky Palace hid inside with a hundred-foot-tall giant ape stood in front of them.
<br><br>
Winchell had morphed into the giant ape, now any Ghost Cicadas that tried to rush in would be torn to pieces! It was because of Winchell that these five people of the Oneness Sky Palace survived.
<br><br>
"There are fewer Ghost Cicadas!"
<br><br>
"Great! If we can kill them all, we can leave this damned place!"
<br><br>
"Winchell, thank you so much!"
<br><br>
Those powerful Holy Souls hiding behind Winchell had launched attacks as well, but they didn't kill nearly as many as Winchell.
<br><br>
Winchell roared in response.
<br><br>
If the Ghost Cicadas were really their only opponent, they might narrowly escape alive this time.
<br><br>
But would things go as they hoped? Once Winchell had crushed the last wave of Ghost Cicadas, he heard a rumble of footsteps rolling out of nowhere. Then he saw a group of Other Shore creatures rushing at them like a tidal wave.
<br><br>
The sight of them dissipated Winchell's will to fight like a ball deflated in an instant.
<br><br>
He was very clear that it would be impossible for him to defeat all of them alone, and those with him felt the same. All their hearts sank as they accepted their fate that they would now die here.
<br><br>
Buzz! The giant ape's skin flashed a cyan light and shrunk all the way down to Winchell's original size.
<br><br>
With a flip of his hand, a round black stone appeared in his palm. It was a Heavy Stone.
<br><br>
They had been very lucky this time and not long after entering the stone forest, he found this Heavy Stone.
<br><br>
"What a pity..."
<br><br>
He raised his hand and was about to throw the Heavy Stone when a wild clanging suddenly rang out from not far off.
<br><br>
Behind the creatures rushing over, came the bang of heavy objects clashing.
<br><br>
Then there were broken limbs floating in the air, blood splashing everywhere and gruesome howling could be heard throughout.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! A Celestial Spear was spinning in Zen's hand.
<br><br>
To him, these Other Shore creatures were nothing.
<br><br>
He had only released fifty thousand divine megatons of force, which was still far more than these creatures could take.
<br><br>
The long spear spun around like a windmill, the slightest touch of it causing death or serious injury.
<br><br>
Zen killed the creatures all along the path like this. When the last Other Shore creatures had been minced, he appeared before Winchell and the others. His body was soaked in blood of all sorts of colors, as if he had been painted on like he was a canvas.
<br><br>
Winchell and the others stood not far away, staring blankly as they watched Zen rushing in and killing every creature in his path.
<br><br>
They had been at the end of their rope and now couldn't believe what they were witnessing! Chapter 3793 Claire Although Winchell guessed that it was Zen before them, he still stood his ground and dared not greet him.
<br><br>
Zen then came forward with his hands respectfully cupped in front of him.
<br><br>
"Master Winchell, sorry for being late."
<br><br>
"It really is Zen!"
<br><br>
"We're out of danger now!"
<br><br>
"I thought we were doomed!"
<br><br>
The five Holy Soul Realm warriors breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
Winchell also smiled and bowed towards Zen. "It is fortunate that you were able to get here just in time. You've saved us all, Zen."
<br><br>
Zen shook his head and hurriedly went to his side. "Master Winchell, you've risked so much to help me look for the Heavy Stone. I should be the one thanking you."
<br><br>
Winchell shook his head. "The Oneness Sky Palace owes you so much, and the Origin Mountain even more. You've grown so powerful and there's little we can do to help you. I am thankful that this was within our ability to do for you."
<br><br>
When he finished speaking, he handed a round stone over to Zen.
<br><br>
"A Heavy Stone?" Zen muttered, turning the stone over in his hand curiously.
<br><br>
Winchell simply nodded as he took the stone from him.
<br><br>
"With this stone, you'll be able to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting when the time comes," he told Zen. "However, your Soul of Light needs to ascend to this stage first."
<br><br>
In order to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, one's soul needed to be integrated with the physical form, and his Soul of Light remained at a lower stage.
<br><br>
However, Zen had already cleared the path from the Blooming Jade Stage to the Grand Plain Stage so there wouldn't be any problems for him to enter the latter.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fire Emissary, Pearce, and the others simply waited on the bronze ground. Nobody talked and there was not a peep, not even a whisper amongst them. An hour later, the silence was broken by a few gasps as a streak of white light swept across the bronze ground. The relief sculptures immediately changed before their very eyes.
<br><br>
When the current scene in the forest appeared, Pearce and the others all heaved sighs of relief.
<br><br>
The figures of the Other Shore creatures couldn't be seen that easily since the picture was so small but they could distinguish their broken limbs if they looked hard enough.
<br><br>
Fire Emissary smiled when he saw this before he turned around and left.
<br><br>
Pearce could only stare at Fire Emissary's back, lost in thought.
<br><br>
He initially thought that the Element Spirit race left behind some traps in the stone forest.
<br><br>
To his surprise, they didn't seem to have done so.
<br><br>
What did the Fire Emissary seek to gain when he did this? Was it just truly to send the members of the three Other Shore races to their deaths? True, these three Other Shore races were weak and had no Eternal Realm master so why would the Element Spirit race suddenly decide to kill all of them? For sheer entertainment? That couldn't be it.
<br><br>
Just as Pearce continued to mull this over, a white vortex suddenly appeared beside him. From the vortex came forth Zen, Winchell, and the rest of their brethren.
<br><br>
"Winchell!" Pearce shouted in glee at the sight.
<br><br>
Winchell gave him a smile and a polite bow. As he stood up, his eyes also caught the Fire Emissary's retreating back. "Pearce, this is too weird!"
<br><br>
"I think so too," Auden chimed in. "That's not the only issue. Haven't you noticed? The Element Spirit race's actions against Zen have been extremely weird."
<br><br>
Zen's eyes gleamed with apprehension upon hearing Auden's words.
<br><br>
If the Element Spirit race was indeed in such a hurry to obtain the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits and stop Zen from entering Stage Thirty-three then they should've gathered all their strength in order to deal him the killing blow. If it truly mattered so much then why didn't Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and the Chaos Ancient God behind them take action? Their forces in the Source World chose to stay put and, even if they attacked Zen several times on the Other Shore, they never really made any trouble for him. The Element Spirit race was holding back.
<br><br>
This last attack couldn't even be called a proper offense. Everything smelled fishy.
<br><br>
A noticeable frown was plastered on Pearce's face. "What is their true purpose?"
<br><br>
Zen could only sigh in resignation. "I'm afraid the Element Spirit race are the only ones who truly know."
<br><br>
Pearce huffed proudly in response. "No matter!" he declared. "You'll be able to reach the Eternal Realm in the near future since you've obtained the Heavy Stone! It doesn't matter what kind of wicked scheme the Element Spirit race is brewing."
<br><br>
As of the moment, Zen had obtained eighteen imprints in total. So long as he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting with no problems then he was set on his way to becoming an Eternal Warrior. He was now strong enough to kill the Blood Spirit Tortoise and once he reached the Eternal Realm, he would finally gain the ability to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.
<br><br>
Once Fire Emissary left, he began to cross over hundreds of miles on the bronze ground.
<br><br>
Soon enough, he came to a halt in front of a strangely-shaped relief.
<br><br>
In front of him was the relief of a circular, blood-red building — the Blood Assembly, the Element Spirit race's base camp in the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
Fire Emissary took out a Light Stone and lightly tapped it on the ground, creating a white vortex that he could use to enter the world within the relief.
<br><br>
Given his status and identity, he was not actually qualified to enter the Blood Assembly. Only those like Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer were given such high privilege.
<br><br>
Thus, Fire Emissary had no choice but to relay everything to a Moon Fire Slave who would then deliver his message to the higher-ups.
<br><br>
Not long after...
<br><br>
A small orb appeared in the innermost part of the Blood Assembly. This orb was made up of pure elements and had a small flame floating inside it.
<br><br>
Buzz! The flame continuously changed, rising and falling before it finally took on the shape of a human woman.
<br><br>
So long as they wanted, the Element Spirit race could change into any form.
<br><br>
This was one of their abilities: complete transformation.
<br><br>
In the past, the race strictly regulated the form its members took, however, time softened such restrictions until all of them were eventually lifted.
<br><br>
Thus, more and more race members began to take on more unique shapes and a large number of them preferred human forms.
<br><br>
This particular race member was one of those who preferred the human form and the one she transformed into seemed a bit similar to the Snake Goddess, though she evidently looked more mischievous.
<br><br>
She merely floated within the orb and looked up at the top of the space.
<br><br>
"Les, what did you call me for?"
<br><br>
At the top of the space, directly above her, was a circular mirror and within it was another member of the Element Spirit race — a thunder spirit.
<br><br>
Les, the thunder spirit, looked at the fire spirit with sharp, raging eyes. "I've just received the reports. What the hell did you do, Claire?!"
<br><br>
Claire merely blinked and a small smile made its way to her lips. "Carrying out the task given to me by the great Eye Spirit!" she declared proudly.
<br><br>
Les looked like he was on the brink of exploding. "Eye Spirit ordered you to kill that human brat!"
<br><br>
There had been a lot of troubles at Stage Thirty-three recently and there was a need for the powerful Element Spirit race to deal with them carefully, thus, they handed the other, less significant matters over to Claire.
<br><br>
When Les received a series of reports detailing Claire's failed attempts at killing Zen, he was naturally furious. Claire obviously wasn't taking her job seriously.
<br><br>
They were bound to be a laughingstock if people found out that the almighty Element Spirit race couldn't even deal with one human boy.
<br><br>
"Eye Spirit doesn't really want to kill the human," Claire muttered with a pout.
<br><br>
"Cut the crap!" Les snapped. He was overcome with emotions and a terrifying aura engulfed his surroundings as bolts of lightning began to emanate from his orb.
<br><br>
Claire huffed. "I'm serious! Nine Holy Soul Imprints and nine Bone Tribulation Imprints! This human is the first-ever creature to have received so many and he deserves our expectations."
<br><br>
Chapter 3794 Three Purities Stone "What are you expecting? This guy to get to Stage Thirty-three?" Les asked furiously on the other side of the mirror.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had once regarded Stage Thirty-two as their base camp too.
<br><br>
The race occupied many regions in Stage Thirty-two. The Blood Assembly stood at the center while the Other Shore races within a radius of a hundred miles were considered to bend to it.
<br><br>
For the Element Spirit race, they might not take even an Eternal Realm warrior seriously, because the Eternal Realm masters were only rare in the Source World.
<br><br>
As a great number of Other Shore races had gathered in the thirty-two stages, these races could always produce one or two Eternal Realm warriors after many chaotic eras of reproduction.
<br><br>
However, after reaching the Eternal Realm, many chose to move to Stage Thirty-three. Very few chose to stay in Stage Thirty-two.
<br><br>
But Zen was special. He was the only one who had eighteen imprints, an indicator of the great potential he possessed.
<br><br>
"I just have expectations for him," Claire smiled.
<br><br>
"But don't forget that he is on the opposite side. He is our enemy, not our friend!" Les snapped.
<br><br>
Claire chuckled at this. "Sometimes the enemy's enemy is also a friend, right?"
<br><br>
Les looked startled but he finally came to his senses after a brief pause.
<br><br>
"You mean our real enemy is the Nihility race?"
<br><br>
"Yes," said Claire, nodding. "At the time, Eye Spirit's wrong decision gave the Grandmaster of Heaven a chance to survive. Who would have thought that that same guy would gradually become so powerful? He's now threatening the foundation of our Element Spirit race!"
<br><br>
"Even so, do you expect the human race to stand with us? Is it even possible? Don't forget that we still have the Primeval Lord of Heaven and his fellows in our custody," Les said. .
<br><br>
The conflict between the Element Spirit race and the human race was so huge that it was practically irreconcilable.
<br><br>
"We don't need them to stand with us," Claire said with a mysterious smile.
<br><br>
"Don't forget that the conflict between the Nihility race and them is greater than what exists between them and us."
<br><br>
The goal of the Element Spirit race was not to destroy the entire chaos, but to stabilize it into a normal state. The Nihility race, however, planned to destroy the chaos and return everything into nothingness.
<br><br>
According to reports from Yellow Thearch, a warrior who had been painstakingly trained by the Nihility race through the Black Ship also held a grudge against Zen.
<br><br>
Les was silent for a while before he spoke, "Does Eye Spirit agree with this idea?"
<br><br>
"No," Claire said, shaking her head. "But I believe that he will agree."
<br><br>
It was thanks to Claire's persuasion that Les had calmed down. "I will speak with Eye Spirit, but you need to guard Stage Thirty-two. What happened in the Blooming Jade Stage shouldn't happen here!"
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race hadn't ever expected the Blooming Jade Stage to face such defeat. It had shocked the entire race.
<br><br>
No one had thought that Zen could release the bald giant from the Cold Prison, which in turn led to the loss of the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
The influence and strength of the Element Spirit race in the Grand Plain Stage were far greater than those in the Blooming Jade Stage. Moreover, the Grand Plain Stage wouldn't suppress their strength and they had the help of the Eternal Realm warriors. Hence, they would hardly lose as they did in the Bloom Jade Stage.
<br><br>
"Go ahead," said Claire, shrugging.
<br><br>
Her figure floated in the ball, and her slender legs slowly gathered together before she burst into a flame.
<br><br>
After obtaining the Heavy Stone, Zen and the others chose not to return to the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The Grand Plain Stage was safe for them as long as they didn't enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
They continued to walk north for a while and as they did, triangular sculptures began to appear on the ground. A small round hole sat at the center of each of these sculptures.
<br><br>
"These triangular sculptures are called Three Purities Stones. Only with them can one enter the first volume," Pearce explained.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze followed the densely packed stones. There were creatures sitting in the corners of a few of them.
<br><br>
He found it strange that the three creatures sitting in the corners of the same Three Purities Stone all looked the same.
<br><br>
"Sir, what's going on with these creatures?" Zen asked. "Have they already entered the first volume?"
<br><br>
Pearce nodded and reached out to point at a Three Purities Stone. "The three creatures in this stone are actually the same creature. The one in this corner is his Soul of Light, this corner is his physical body, and the last corner is his Eternal Body."
<br><br>
"The Eternal Bodies of these creatures still remain here?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Of course not," Pearce said, shaking his head. "Most of the Eternal Realm masters have entered Stage Thirty-three. These are just traces they've left here."
<br><br>
Pearce then turned to Libby and said, "You can find a stone and enter it.
<br><br>
Place your Soul of Light in it. This will improve your strength of the Holy Soul Realm."
<br><br>
The Three Purities Stone integrated body and soul into one and sent the warrior to the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting. The warrior would obtain the Eternal Body after reaching the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
But the creatures in the Source World only appeared on the Other Shore using their Souls of Light and couldn't enter the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting. They could only place their Souls of Light in Three Purities Stones. It would, at the very least, improve the strength of their Souls of Light.
<br><br>
For the Three Purities Stones close by, only one sculpture stood in each of them. Only their Souls of Light were in the stones.
<br><br>
"Okay!"
<br><br>
Libby already knew of this method to strengthen herself. She nodded and found a Three Purities Stone sculpture. She gently hit the Light Stone in her hand to the ground and went into the white vortex produced by the stone.
<br><br>
Everyone waited outside. When the white flash began to refresh the bronze ground, they saw Libby's Soul of Light appear on one corner of the Three Purities Stone.
<br><br>
Even after Libby emerged from the ground, they could still see her figure within the stone.
<br><br>
"I'm done," said Libby with a smile.
<br><br>
Placing the Souls of Light in the Three Purities Stones could increase the strength of the Holy Souls by more than 10%, a design loophole.
<br><br>
"It's your turn, Zen," said Pearce. "Since your Soul of Light hasn't arrived yet, you can place your body in it today."
<br><br>
Like Libby, Zen found a Three Purities Stone sculpture, slammed a Light Stone into the ground and went into the vortex produced.
<br><br>
The Three Purities Stone sculpture looked like a palm-sized triangle from the outside.
<br><br>
Upon entering it, Zen discovered that it was not that small.
<br><br>
There was an empty seat in each of the three corners of the triangle. He randomly chose a seat and sat down on it.
<br><br>
The moment he sat down, his entire body seemed to freeze and become one with the triangle. . 'How do I get off now?' Zen muttered, stunned.
<br><br>
But on second thought, since even Libby's Holy Soul had been able to leave, there was no reason for his body to be stuck here! Just a gentle flow of his strength would make it easy for him to escape from the seat he was on.
<br><br>
But Zen was startled when he looked back. His physical body was still sitting on the seat! Chapter 3795 Three Eyes Zen even reached out to touch his body.
<br><br>
The "statue" that sat upright was exactly the same as his own corporeal body, though it didn't move of course.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, is this just a statue?" Zen asked, slightly hesitant and overtaken with curiosity.
<br><br>
"No," replied the Primeval Lord of Heaven, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Then what is this? Is it my real body? How could that be?" Zen asked, even more taken by what he saw.
<br><br>
"Not exactly," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a faint knowing smile.
<br><br>
As the most wise and knowledgeable human being, he had a deep understanding of Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore as well as of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"Think of it as an anchor," he said. "Let's call it a sort of anchor body!"
<br><br>
"An anchor you say?"
<br><br>
Zen stared pensively.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven confirmed with a smile. "Think of us as a ship drifting. This anchor body fixes us here so we can receive power from external areas, namely, the power of the Eternal Realm..."
<br><br>
"The power of the Eternal Realm?" Zen's eyes glinted.
<br><br>
Of course, he knew that Eternal Warriors of the Eternal Realm were very powerful, but he hadn't understood why.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven recognized Zen's confusion. Suddenly, he asked, "In your opinion, is there any difference between the bloodline of Sun Crows and the bloodlines of the ferocious beasts in the Source World?"
<br><br>
"The bloodline of Sun Crows and the bloodlines of ferocious beasts..." Zen frowned and thought for a while. "I think the difference is probably in their strength. Although the ferocious beasts are also capable of inheriting bloodlines, theirs won't increase their own strength very much, but the bloodline of Sun Crows is different."
<br><br>
"Then have you ever thought about why their blood power is so strong?"
<br><br>
the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, smiling once more.
<br><br>
Creatures in the Source World could summon such great power because they relied on the Other Shore Tokens on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, this rule was broken by blood power.
<br><br>
When Emperor Charm had used the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy or Eastern Emperor Taiyi had used the golden sword, their power hadn't come from any Other Shore Token, but their own bloodlines.
<br><br>
"So how can they unleash such power without using any Other Shore Token?" With the Primeval Lord of Heaven's hints, Zen now understood.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, you mean... the Eternal Scroll Painting? They have obtained their bloodlines from the Eternal Scroll Painting!"
<br><br>
Zen had been wondering how Emperor Charm's and Eastern Emperor Taiyi's blood power could be so strong. So strong they were able to destroy a whole province with ease. Obviously, their blood power was much more powerful than Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
But both Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Emperor Charm were powerful seniors; Zen had thought perhaps they had used means he did not know of, so he hadn't thought too deeply about this question.
<br><br>
But the Primeval Lord of Heaven's reminders helped Zen figure it out quickly.
<br><br>
"The Three Purities Stone is an anchor that binds your real body here, so that at the same time, you may enter the Eternal Scroll Painting and obtain your own bloodline. The other end of your bloodline is connected to somewhere in the distant Abstruse Energy World..." explained the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"No wonder there is a vortex in both Eastern Emperor Taiyi's golden sword and Emperor Charm's suns!" Zen said, nodding excitedly at this new found revelation.
<br><br>
The power of the Abstruse Energy World was connected to the Eternal Scroll Painting, and the power of the Eternal Scroll Painting was connected to the statues in the Three Purities Stones. The statues were like anchors, closely connected to the Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
"The blood power can be inherited, so the children of these powerful warriors of the Eternal Realm have it too..." Zen appeared confused again.
<br><br>
Putting himself aside, Yan had also obtained the Snake Goddess' bloodline through the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, and could now use the shadow of Snake Goddess as an energy entity.
<br><br>
Although Yan's shadow of Snake Goddess couldn't be compared with the actual Snake Goddess, she at least possessed the blood power.
<br><br>
"All creatures with the same bloodline have an invisible line that connects them to that powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven began. "Therefore, using the Blood Splitting Technique, you can, quite ingeniously, kill all people with the same bloodline in a region, by relying on that invisible line."
<br><br>
Zen abruptly raised his eyebrows at the very mention of the Blood Splitting Technique.
<br><br>
The members of the Nine Li race in the divine land had been killed by the Yellow Emperor Guards using the Blood Splitting Technique. It was not until then that Zen had learned of the Blood Splitting Technique.
<br><br>
"The Eternal Scroll Painting is not the only way to obtain the power of the Abstruse Energy World, is it?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Theoretically, all kinds of power could come from the Abstruse Energy World, but the power obtained through the Eternal Scroll Painting was far stronger than any ordinary power. Generally speaking, as long as some power was obtained through the Eternal Scroll Painting, it could reveal the "vortex" that was connected to the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"Of course not," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied. "The Chaotic Source Spirits in your body is another way, just in the reverse direction? There are also some Other Shore Tokens in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore that can achieve a similar effect."
<br><br>
"If that's the case and I enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, will I obtain a new bloodline?" Zen inquired.
<br><br>
He already had two bloodlines in his body.
<br><br>
One was the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline, and the other was Chiyou's. If he entered the Eternal Realm in the Eternal Scroll Painting, he would obtain a third bloodline and he thought that would be too many for him.
<br><br>
"Once you obtain a new bloodline, Chiyou's bloodline will disappear from your body," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said matter-of-factly. "Back in the times of the 77th civilization, Ziya entered the Eternal Realm and my bloodline was removed from his body."
<br><br>
"I didn't know a bloodline could be replaced in the Eternal Scroll Painting."
<br><br>
Zen became looking forward to obtaining his blood power in the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
When he withdrew from the second volume, he saw a group of an Other Shore race coming over from not far off. They were almost the same as humans, except for the third eye on their foreheads.
<br><br>
The man who led them possessed an extremely powerful aura, no weaker than Eastern Emperor Taiyi or Yasamin. It was obvious he was a powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
When Pearce and the others caught sight of them, they immediately walked up to them with smiles strewn across their faces. Bowing to the powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm, Pearce said, "Chief, seeing as you're leading your clansmen here in person, it must mean the Three Eyes race is not lacking in young talents!"
<br><br>
In Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, most races submitted to the Element Spirit race, while others were under the protection of the Nihility race. However, in addition to these two camps, there were also other races that maintained a neutral position.
<br><br>
In fact, these neutral races all pretty much agreed with the Finale Way, and were thus potential allies of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill. That was the reason for Pearce's politeness.
<br><br>
The chief nodded slightly, turned and waved his hand. "This time, there will be three members of our Three Eyes race entering the Eternal Scroll Painting. Of course I hope they can enter the Eternal Realm."
<br><br>
His wave signaled the three members, who stood out from the rest of the group one at a time.
<br><br>
The one walking in the front was the shortest and looked like a child.
<br><br>
Zen stared at him for quite a while before he finally realized who he was.
<br><br>
He was the three-eyed boy he had met in the Dark Region in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But this was not the Dark Region. As a creature in the Dark Region, how could the three-eyed boy have entered the Light Region? Chapter 3796 Help When the three-eyed boy stepped forward, he saw Zen who stood at the side.
<br><br>
Every human he met in the past were all in their soul forms on the Other Shore, except for the one he encountered when he had trained in Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy was well-respected in their race because, over recent years, he was the most promising talent to become an Eternal Realm master.
<br><br>
Their race, known as the Three Eyes race, sent him to Stage Thirteen after they discovered a large number of Burning Crystal mines there. They both wanted him to fight for the mines and hoped that he would get more training in real combats.
<br><br>
The competition in Stage Thirteen was exceptionally fierce. Both the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race had grabbed their shares of the pie, so the Three Eyes race would naturally have a hard time taking their cut.
<br><br>
Fortunately, they had a good relationship with the giant ape in Stage Thirteen. Thus, they had more advantages over the other races with the giant ape's help.
<br><br>
In the end, the powerful combination of the three-eyed boy and the giant ape continuously defeated the forces arranged by the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race in the Dark Region. The black monkeys that was affiliated with the Nihility race suffered the most damage since the threeeyed boy and the giant ape slaughtered so many of their kind.
<br><br>
As for the pig-faced monsters affiliated with the Element Spirit race, they pinned their hopes on something else instead — which was to produce a purified being.
<br><br>
The purified being didn't exist in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen back then. The pig-faced monsters' plan went smoothly until Elvinia had interrupted their leader Teague, and all their efforts went to waste.
<br><br>
After that, Zen and Elvinia escaped from the Dark Region, and the threeeyed boy never saw them again.
<br><br>
Now that the three-eyed boy saw Zen again in Stage Thirty-two, he realized that Zen was somehow familiar to him.
<br><br>
But after Zen had passed through the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, his aura had changed tremendously. Therefore, it was difficult for the three-eyed boy to confirm his identity.
<br><br>
At that moment, the leader of the Three Eyes race noticed the three-eyed boy's curious gaze towards Zen, so he asked, "Egan, do you know this human?"
<br><br>
Instead of answering the leader's question, Egan turned to Zen and asked, "Have you ever been to the Dark Region in Stage Thirteen?"
<br><br>
Zen smiled and calmly replied, "Of course I have been there."
<br><br>
Silence hung in the air for a while, then Egan's lips curved up into a smile.
<br><br>
"Grandpa, I was once seriously injured in Stage Thirteen. It was this human who helped me heal my wounds at that time!" he exclaimed. 'I didn't expect that he would reach the Grand Plain Stage in such a short time!' he thought.
<br><br>
He wasn't sure of Zen's identity at first because he knew that it was very difficult to ascend to the current stage where he was from Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
Those who were born in Stage Thirty-two like himself were the exception, but he couldn't believe that someone had passed through the lower stages so quickly! Their leader was utterly shocked as well. He stared at Zen and said in a deep voice, "As far as I know, it has only been three years since you went for training in Stage Thirteen. Am I right, Egan? So you mean to say that he ascended from Stage Thirteen to Stage Thirty-two in only three years?"
<br><br>
The leader of the Three Eyes race was very surprised at such an achievement.
<br><br>
"Pearce, is it true that it only took him three years?"
<br><br>
"What a fast improvement, it's almost a miracle!"
<br><br>
"It seems that the Oneness Sky Palace has discovered an extraordinary talent!"
<br><br>
The other members of the Three Eyes race behind the leader all remarked in awe.
<br><br>
Although the Three Eyes race couldn't compare to the large races like the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race, they had a higher status than the Oneness Sky Palace in Stage Thirty-two and had a much stronger force.
<br><br>
The reason the Oneness Sky Palace had gotten a foot in the door of Stage Thirty-two was because of the protection mechanism in the stage. If the current chaotic era had ended, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, the only two Eternal Realm masters of the Oneness Sky Palace, weren't enough to protect their temple in Stage Thirty-two.
<br><br>
Therefore, the warriors of the Three Eyes race never expected that a weak force like the Oneness Sky Palace would have such an extraordinary junior.
<br><br>
Zen's fast improvement even exceeded that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi! Just as the members of the Three Eyes race had yet to recover from shock, Egan suddenly said, "Grandpa, you are wrong. I met Zen two years after I entered Stage Thirteen. That was about a year ago."
<br><br>
The people of the Three Eyes race immediately fell silent. They could not help but look Zen up and down once again.
<br><br>
To ascend from Stage Thirteen to Stage Thirty-two in only one year...
<br><br>
How did the Oneness Sky Palace manage to find such an extraordinary talent? While the people of the Three Eyes race were stunned into silence, Pearce and the others of the Oneness Sky Palace felt overjoyed at their reaction.
<br><br>
Of course, the people of Oneness Sky Palace knew Zen much better than the outsiders.
<br><br>
They knew that his fast improvement was just one aspect of his many striking talents. "The Oneness Sky Palace must have put a lot of efforts and resources into helping you improve, didn't they?" the leader asked with a smile.
<br><br>
Pearce wanted to deny what the leader said because he knew that Zen obtained all those resources through his own efforts. However, Zen answered before him and said, "That's right! I would've never reached the Grand Plain Stage so quickly without the generous support and abundant resources the Oneness Sky Palace had given me."
<br><br>
If the Oneness Sky Palace channeled all their resources to provide Zen with sufficient soul crystal and Body-strengthening Jades, then Zen's incredible achievement would seem somehow reasonable.
<br><br>
As Zen expected, the warriors of the Three Eyes race sighed in relief at his answer. His explanation sounded easier for them to accept.
<br><br>
"The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace don't have a physical form, just a soul on the Other Shore. You are a rare exception since you have entered the Other Shore with a physical body, so of course, they will do their best to train you," the leader of the Three Eyes race said with a smile. "My grandson had obtained four Holy Soul Imprints and five Bone Tribulation Imprints a long time ago.
<br><br>
He is the warrior with the most imprints in the history of our race. I believe that he will achieve a good ranking in the Eternal Scroll Painting," he added.
<br><br>
He shifted the topic to his grandson and forgot to ask Zen about the number of imprints he had obtained.
<br><br>
Egan's childish face was full of confidence. "Grandpa, I won't let you down," he assured.
<br><br>
"This young man from the Oneness Sky Palace has helped you a lot. After you have entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, you must help him in return,"
<br><br>
the leader nodded and said. "It will be my pleasure!" Egan exclaimed and smiled at Zen.
<br><br>
"Thank you very much, Chief," Pearce said calmly and cupped his hands.
<br><br>
At that point, the leader of the Three Eyes race cast a curious look at Pearce.
<br><br>
The people of the Oneness Sky Palace were usually overjoyed if the Three Eyes race made them such a promise.
<br><br>
However, Pearce was calm and composed when he expressed his gratitude.
<br><br>
It seemed that his grandson's help didn't matter so much to him at all.
<br><br>
'Maybe I am just overthinking...' he thought.
<br><br>
He didn't know that although his grandson was talented enough to obtain four Holy Soul Imprints and five Bone Tribulation Imprints, it was nothing compared to Zen's achievements. They were not even on the same level.
<br><br>
Once their discussion was over, Egan and the two other members of the Three Eyes race found a Three Purities Stone each. They used the Light Stones and entered the Three Purities Stones to put their bodies and Souls of Light into them.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the soul and body of the creatures on the Other Shore were always together.
<br><br>
Two anchor bodies appeared on each of the Three Purities Stones after they came out. One was their physical body, and the other was their soul. If they reached the Eternal Realm, the third anchor body would appear there as well.
<br><br>
Soon enough, many Other Shore races also showed up and followed suit.
<br><br>
All of them wanted to put their bodies and souls into the Three Purities Stones before the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting opened.
<br><br>
Chapter 3797 The Violet Cloud Race After all these races in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore had shown up, Zen realized there were a lot more here than he had originally thought.
<br><br>
After all, the ruling civilizations usually built their own temples in Stage Thirty-two in the past.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization had once developed and grown in Stage Thirtytwo of the Other Shore, but they were unable to cope with the relentless chase and pestering of the Nihility race. They were left no choice but to enter a lower space and hide in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The humans had been in a similar situation. The human beings, led by the Primeval Lord of Heaven, were unable to contend with the Element Spirit race and were forced to flee into Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. As for the other humans, they hid in the Creation Myth Temple of Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
In the distance, black cubes glided along the bronze ground like flying carpets.
<br><br>
From the black cubes jumped many creatures as slender as bamboo sticks.
<br><br>
They were tall and strong, with skin of cyan-purple. Their faces were long, like that of horse, and they looked very arrogant. They lined up in a row and three more warriors stepped down from the black cubes.
<br><br>
Their aura was extraordinary as they were all Eternal Realm masters.
<br><br>
"What race are they? They actually have three warriors at the Eternal Realm..." Zen asked curiously and astounded.
<br><br>
"That's the Violet Cloud race. They used to be one of the top five ruling civilizations," Pearce said in a low voice. "But now they have pledged allegiance to the Element Spirit race."
<br><br>
"Even one of the top five ruling civilizations has pledged loyalty to the Element Spirit race..." Zen said disgustedly, shaking his head.
<br><br>
He had learned from the Primeval Lord of Heaven that in Stage Thirty-two, all the races, except for the Three Eyes race and few others that followed the Finale Way and remained neutral, had joined the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race. Even with this knowledge, he couldn't help but sigh in disappointment when he saw it with his own eyes.
<br><br>
"The entire Violet Cloud race is pitiful and ungrateful. They have joined the Element Spirit race but they aren't in an important position. It's been so many years and they still haven't progressed their strength and development," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven, his voice rife with contempt.
<br><br>
"Does the Violet Cloud race hold a grudge against the human race?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"After our human race entered Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, under the leadership of our human ancestor, we were able to stand up to the Element Spirit race. Many Other Shore races and civilizations then joined us. The Violet Cloud race is the 62nd civilization, even older than us, and was once the most solid ally of our human race," the Primeval Lord of Heaven mused, lost in thought of the past.
<br><br>
Back then the Grand Plain Stage was not as lifeless as it was now. Many ruling civilizations sprung up there and developed into powerful and prosperous races.
<br><br>
The human race continued upholding the Finale Way. Even if the 77th chaos had failed, the human race and the other civilizations on the Other Shore still continued firmly supporting the Finale Way...
<br><br>
At the human race's peak in the Grand Plain Stage, there was even a hint of a possibility they might be able to defeat the Element Spirit race. It was at this most critical moment that they were betrayed by several ruling civilizations, including the Violet Cloud race.
<br><br>
After the human race failed, the Finale Way was gradually neglected by others.
<br><br>
Now, any forces that once supported the Finale Way had either disappeared or chosen to side with the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race. Either that or they had chosen an existence like that of the Three Eyes race, which remained neutral, and achieved nothing.
<br><br>
"The Violet Cloud race once had such a relationship with our race..." Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Too much had happened during a thousand chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Just then, the Violet Cloud race suddenly began making moves on both sides, enveloping an area of Three Purities Stones. As they did so, one of their Eternal Realm warriors yelled, "All souls and physical bodies sitting on the Three Purities Stones in this area, should be removed!"
<br><br>
Several warriors had already hung their souls and physical bodies on the Three Purities Stones before the Violet Cloud race had gotten there, including Zen, Libby, and three members of the Three Eyes race.
<br><br>
When the Eternal Realm warrior suddenly roared for them to remove their souls and physical bodies, everyone was confused.
<br><br>
The leader of the Three Eyes race glared at the Eternal Realm warrior in displeasure and said, "You only need one of the Three Purities Stones to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, and it doesn't matter which is used. Why do you ask us to remove the souls and physical bodies?"
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm warrior of the Violet Cloud race put his hands behind his back and with a sinister smile, said, "It doesn't matter which Three Purities Stone is used to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, but the Eternal Realm warriors of our race have all chosen this area to keep our souls and bodies.
<br><br>
No one else is allowed here!"
<br><br>
The sculptures around the Three Purities Stones on the ground did indeed have slender and long figures. There was no doubt they belonged to the Violet Cloud race.
<br><br>
Even so, their behaviors were petty and unreasonable.
<br><br>
It did not matter whether they were the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race or anyone else, they had to choose a Three Purities Stone at random.
<br><br>
But the Violet Cloud warriors were domineering and even though the others had already hung their souls and bodies on the stones, they still asked them to remove them.
<br><br>
"What if we don't remove them?" The leader of Three Eyes race asked with anger flaring in his eyes.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy named Egan and the other members of the Three Eyes race were all furious.
<br><br>
Another Eternal Realm warrior of the Violet Cloud race chuckled, "I seem to recall that the Three Eyes race doesn't do well with torture. If you do not want to remove them, you may try your luck and see what happens to you!"
<br><br>
The Three Eyes race could protect themselves within the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
But if the Violet Cloud race attacked them with all their might, they would have a tough time dealing with it.
<br><br>
This threat left most the members of the Three Eyes race feeling indignant, while Egan seemed understanding and even suggested, "Grandpa, we'd better remove our souls and bodies. We'd lose nothing by switching Three Purities Stones."
<br><br>
Under Egan's persuasion, their leader could only agree. Egan and the other two members of the Three Eyes race returned to the inner space of the second volume and took back the bodies hanging there.
<br><br>
The Three Eyes race had chosen submission and the other small races couldn't afford to offend the Violet Cloud race as well, and so obediently followed suit. Only Zen and Libby were left. One of them had placed the soul on the stone, and the other had put the body there.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm warrior of the Violet Cloud race glanced at the two Three Purities Stones and saw this. He turned around, stared at Pearce and ordered ferociously, "Why are the humans here? Remove them now!"
<br><br>
Both Pearce and Auden were unsure how to deal with this. They didn't want to offend these Other Shore races when Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not here.
<br><br>
Zen on the other hand took the opportunity to stand up. "What if I don't remove it?"
<br><br>
The people of the Violet Cloud race had never imagined the weak human race would refuse, especially in this round of chaos where the humans couldn't even enter the Other Shore with their physical bodies. All they could do was to put their souls into the stones. They were quite simply just unimportant characters.
<br><br>
That was why when Zen spoke, it drew the eyes of all the Violet Cloud warriors. Several Eternal Realm warriors looked at Zen strangely when they noticed his physical body.
<br><br>
Chapter 3798 No Longer Tolerant Zen had caused quite a stir in the lower stages of the Other Shore, but very little information had been transmitted to Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Although the Element Spirit race knew a lot about Zen, they wouldn't communicate any information about Zen with their subordinate races, which was why the members of the Violet Cloud race were all surprised to see his corporeal body.
<br><br>
"Interesting," the powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm from the Violet Cloud race said, looking Zen up and down. "The Truth of Powerful Holy Body is forbidden in the current round of chaos, so your corporeal bodies should not have been able to enter here. How did you manage to do it, human?"
<br><br>
"Why should I tell you?" Zen retorted.
<br><br>
At this, several members of the Violet Cloud race rushed towards him, the one leading them looking menacing. "Human, it's an honor to be asked a question by Elder Howe. You'd better answer his question honestly!"
<br><br>
All the humans in the current round of chaos kept a low profile. Even a large number of Holy Soul Realm humans, including Pearce, in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore stayed out of the limelight. That was why the members of the Violet Cloud race weren't taking Zen seriously.
<br><br>
"Or what?" Zen smiled.
<br><br>
"Or..." the member of the Violet Cloud race faltered, taken aback at Zen's confidence. The Three Eyes race feared the Violet Cloud race because the members of the Violet Cloud race had a number of means of torturing them.
<br><br>
But the humans from the Oneness Sky Palace were still under the protection in the Grand Plain Stage, and while this was so, the Violet Cloud race couldn't do anything to harm them.
<br><br>
"Your alternative is that after this round of chaos, I will make sure that your Oneness Sky Palace disappears from the Grand Plain Stage," Elder Howe of the Violet Cloud race said, his voice booming.
<br><br>
This obvious threat drew the attention of all the remaining Other Shore creatures that were present.
<br><br>
All the Other Shore creatures, including the members of the Three Eyes race, looked at Zen in surprise. They were also curious, wondering why a human of the Holy Soul Realm dared refute the Violet Cloud race, and thought that he was courting death.
<br><br>
Pearce, who had been standing silently to the side for quite a while, suddenly burst into laughter.
<br><br>
Pearce and Auden were the most powerful officials in the Oneness Sky Palace, second only to Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin. But they were filled with anger every time they entered Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, and each time, they had had to swallow their anger and tolerate anything that came their way.
<br><br>
They never dared compete with any other race on the Other Shore for the sake of the Oneness Sky Palace's long-term development. They always greeted the Other Shore races with broad smiles. When they explored the temples, they had to act according to the etiquette that these Other Shore races demanded.
<br><br>
When the Violet Cloud race began to make things difficult for them, Pearce had thought about dealing with them in the usual manner. But on second thought, he realized that the Oneness Sky Palace and the Element Spirit race had already come to an open break since the Element Spirit race had trapped Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.
<br><br>
Since the disparity in strength was huge, begging for mercy didn't make sense.
<br><br>
"Hello, Elder Howe of the Violet Cloud race," Pearce said, walking forward. "You're in the Eternal Realm, but you don't seem to have a working brain."
<br><br>
"What did you say?" Howe's voice had been stern and cold before, and now, it sounded even colder.
<br><br>
The other members of the Violet Cloud race stiffened as well. They didn't think a mere human soul was qualified to speak to a warrior of the Eternal Realm this way.
<br><br>
Pearce was weaker than Howe, but he was a very sophisticated man. He had experienced everything in his lifetime so far. He said unhurriedly, "In the Source World, the Element Spirit Civilization has attacked our Oneness Sky Palace several times, but they failed every single time. The Element Spirit race is our sworn enemy, and we have an irreconcilable hatred for them.
<br><br>
Your Violet Cloud race is nothing but a mere vassal force of the Element Spirit race. If we surrender now, will you let the Element Spirit race let go of us?"
<br><br>
The Violet Cloud race had joined the Element Spirit race, but they were not the strongest among the Other Shore races affiliated to the Element Spirit race. They had almost no say in the workings of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Pearce's remark successfully rendered Howe speechless. Howe's face trembled with rage as he roared, "You're courting death!"
<br><br>
"Courting death? You're a powerful warrior of the Eternal Realm. So it will be easy for you to destroy me, a mere Soul of Light. Am I right?" Pearce retorted.
<br><br>
Howe suddenly jumped, his tall body doing a flip in the air.
<br><br>
A wide purple saber in his hand burst out a terrifying force, chopping down towards Pearce's head.
<br><br>
Pearce didn't budge. He only looked at Howe coldly.
<br><br>
The saber was just inches away from Pearce's forehead when it stopped abruptly.
<br><br>
It had no effect at all. All the power it contained was erased by the rules in the Sanskrit Light Stage. Any battle on the bronze ground was meaningless.
<br><br>
Howe knew this but he had still attacked Pearce for two reasons. One was because he was angry, and the other, because he wanted to intimidate the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
He put away his saber before threatening Pearce again, "I hope you will remember never to meet the members of our Violet Cloud race in the second volume. If you do, I will surely tear you into pieces. Let's go!"
<br><br>
Howe had just turned around to leave with his clansmen, when a voice rang out, "Wait!"
<br><br>
Zen slowly walked out of the crowd.
<br><br>
The members of the Violet Cloud race turned to look at him rather coldly.
<br><br>
They knew that even though they had spoken tough to the members of the Oneness Sky Palace, they could do nothing to them. The anger in their hearts had only multiplied, thanks to this. Their gazes were sharp as knives and they looked like they wanted to cut Zen to pieces.
<br><br>
"I want to know which of you from the Violet Cloud race will enter the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting," Zen said, smiling pleasantly. "Please show me mercy when you do."
<br><br>
Zen wasn't really asking them to show mercy. This was simply another way to declare war.
<br><br>
Howe's eyes lit up at Zen's words. He had almost forgotten that Zen could anchor his corporeal body on the Three Purities Stone. And if he could anchor his soul too, he would be able to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"Very good! Walden!"
<br><br>
Walden, a member of the Violet Cloud race, walked out of the group.
<br><br>
This time, the Violet Cloud race would send six members into the Eternal Scroll Painting. Walden was the strongest of the six. He had ten imprints in all: five Holy Soul Imprints and five Bone Tribulation Imprints. This elevated his status in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Walden's eyes squinted as he smiled and said, "I'll keep it in mind, now that you mention it. I hope you won't disappoint me. Let me show you great mercy."
<br><br>
Behind him stood the other five members of the Violet Cloud race, radiating unfriendliness. It was obvious that they were taking in everything about Zen, their common opponent.
<br><br>
The members of the Three Eyes race were so astonished at what was happening, that they remained frozen in the places.
<br><br>
"I understand that he once saved your life and that you want to repay him, Egan, but I think we should act within the limits of our abilities," the chief of the Three Eyes race whispered to Egan.
<br><br>
"I know, Grandpa," Egan said helplessly.
<br><br>
He knew that Zen must have extraordinary means, but he thought it was unwarranted on Zen's part to fight against the Violet Cloud race before the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting was opened.
<br><br>
Egan was more puzzled at the fact that the elders of the Oneness Sky Palace were doing the same thing as Zen had done.
<br><br>
Though his grandfather had reminded him, because he was not ungrateful, he was still willing to give Zen a hand if his own safety could be assured.
<br><br>
Chapter 3799 Samantha The opening of the Eternal Scroll Painting was an important event for all forces of Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Therefore, all the races on the Other Shore arrived ahead of time. Then, the allied races planned to strategize and cooperate together in the scroll painting.
<br><br>
In the past few days, more and more races on the Other Shore had gathered at the location of the Three Purities Stones.
<br><br>
There was the Extermination race that was stronger than the Violet Cloud race, the Sickle race whose members had notably strange form, the Delicacy race, and other races.
<br><br>
However, the majority of the races in the chaos did not come. Aside from the Oneness Sky Palace, only the Ear Mice showed up.
<br><br>
Of course, the Ear Mouse race didn't come for the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
There was a preparation period of ten days before the Eternal Scroll Painting opened, and a large number of Other Shore creatures gathered at that time. They went there to do business.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen had a small argument with the Violet Cloud race, and then his physical body retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
He had to hang his soul to the Three Purities Stone before the scroll painting opened. However, his soul was still in the Constant Glory Stage.
<br><br>
Although his Soul of Light had nine Holy Soul Imprints, it was still nothing compared to his physical body. Thus, he needed to be careful.
<br><br>
Before he went to the Blooming Jade Stage, he had sent someone to ask Elizabeth about the situation in the place.
<br><br>
Once he confirmed that everything was fine, he headed for the Blooming Jade Stage from the Constant Glory Stage.
<br><br>
The moment he arrived in the snowy and icy world, he saw that many Other Shore creatures neatly stood in front of him and bowed to him, while Elizabeth stood at the side as she quietly stared at him.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures always looked down on the creatures that were in the form of souls on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
During so many years, Zen's soul was probably the only one that enjoyed a better treatment.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" Zen asked as he looked back at Elizabeth.
<br><br>
"We are here to meet and welcome you," Elizabeth said with a chuckle.
<br><br>
Zen frowned and groaned, "You don't have to do this next time."
<br><br>
"Okay," Elizabeth said nonchalantly with a shrug.
<br><br>
She knew that he was quite tired of special treatments, but she only did so because of one thing.
<br><br>
She wanted to show her ability and tell him that she could manage the entire Blooming Jade Stage very well.
<br><br>
As Zen's strength increased, the members of the Sun Crow race, such as Bagot and Micah, became worried. They felt that they were of little use to Zen. It was dangerous if they just stayed in the Oneness Sky Palace like that, since they might be considered insignificant warriors who would be sacrificed at any time.
<br><br>
Elizabeth didn't think that Zen would do such a thing, but she understood the worries of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
That was why she was very happy when Zen gave her the chance to rule over the Blooming Jade Stage. She became completely dedicated to the task.
<br><br>
Now that Zen had passed by, of course she had to display her capabilities! Under the protection of Elizabeth and the Other Shore creatures, Zen quickly crossed the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
The bald giant, Pompeo, also did well, but it was inconvenient for Zen to visit him in the form of a soul in that stage. "Have all the Other Shore races in the entire Blooming Jade Stage surrendered?" Zen asked as he looked at the ice castles in the distance.
<br><br>
"Of course. A few Other Shore races that refused to surrender have been eliminated," Elizabeth answered quickly.
<br><br>
"You did a good job," Zen praised. "But there's one thing you need to understand. Since I let you take charge of the Blooming Jade Stage, it means I trust you. Therefore, you don't have to continue to gain my trust,"
<br><br>
he added.
<br><br>
In any case, if Zen didn't trust Elizabeth at that time, he could've asked someone from the Oneness Sky Palace to take care of Pompeo.
<br><br>
When Zen saw through her thoughts, her voice became lower.
<br><br>
"Okay, I know."
<br><br>
Yet, she was not unhappy at all. She was a little joyful even. After all, what had happened was somehow another answer she wanted.
<br><br>
There was no barrier on the way from Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore to Stage Thirty-two, so Zen's soul had a smooth journey to the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
When he arrived at the location of the Three Purities Stones, he found that more and more Other Shore races had assembled.
<br><br>
All the Other Shore creatures that reached the Holy Soul Realm and obtained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies already attached their souls and bodies to the Three Purities Stones. They just had to wait for the Eternal Scroll Painting to open.
<br><br>
Once again, Zen entered his own Three Purities Stone and sat upright at another corner. Not long after, his soul also turned into the same anchor body as the first one.
<br><br>
Afterwards, he only had to wait for the Eternal Scroll Painting to open as well.
<br><br>
While he waited, the members of various Other Shore races arrived one after another.
<br><br>
They were slightly confused when they saw Zen, and Zen silently observed them in return.
<br><br>
Three days later, the noisy crowd suddenly lowered their voices.
<br><br>
Out of the blue, three blood-red balls appeared not far away! The blood-red ball was the most important symbol of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
They were the only race on the Other Shore that could fight the Element Spirit race head-on. As soon as the red balls appeared, the air immediately felt oppressive.
<br><br>
Although many races joined the Nihility race, the Nihility race had brought much fear to the Other Shore creatures. Not only did they have all sorts of insane ideas, but they also brutally implemented those ideas! As the blood-red balls continued to approach, the Other Shore creatures avoided them. Even some of the Eternal Realm masters didn't want to have a dispute with the Nihility race, so they stood up and moved aside.
<br><br>
The warriors of the Violet Cloud race stayed thousands of feet away from Zen on the other side.
<br><br>
When they saw that the three blood-red balls of the Nihility race had arrived, they got a bit shocked.
<br><br>
"The members of the Nihility race are coming!"
<br><br>
"Will they do something against us?"
<br><br>
Even though the Violet Cloud race was a big race in Stage Thirty-two, they were still very much afraid of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
"What are you afraid of?" Howe coldly scolded them, and then cupped his hands towards the blood-red balls that slowly moved forward. "Would you tell me why you came over to visit us?" he asked.
<br><br>
The Violet Cloud race relied on the Element Spirit race, and the Element Spirit race always supported them no matter what happened. Thus, Howe didn't find any reason to be afraid.
<br><br>
"Fuck off! Who visits your Violet Cloud race anyway? Is this your race's territory?" a cold female voice inside one of the blood-red balls hissed.
<br><br>
As soon as Howe heard the female voice, his jaw dropped.
<br><br>
As an Eternal Realm master who had traveled around Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, he was very familiar with that voice. It belonged to Samantha of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
The Nihility race had three famous women—Samantha and her two sisters, Sienna and Stella. Samantha was the best among them in terms of strength and status.
<br><br>
Now, Howe was a powerful figure in the Grand Plain Stage, so he felt slightly embarrassed when Samantha rudely mocked him.
<br><br>
Still, he gritted his teeth and endured it for the sake of his race. Then, he led the members of the Violet Cloud race to retreat to the side.
<br><br>
He felt perplexed while they walked back. It seemed that the members of the Nihility race did not target the Violet Cloud race, so who could it be? Only the Three Eyes race was in the area they were headed to, but this race was rather average. In what way were they qualified for Samantha to have personally taken action? Aside from Howe, many Other Shore creatures also stared at the blood-red balls as they slowly moved.
<br><br>
To their surprise, the three blood-red balls all stopped in front of Zen.
<br><br>
