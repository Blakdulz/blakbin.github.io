Chapter 3300 Physical Overdraft Zen looked up and said, "We'd better leave as soon as possible."
<br><br>
The black monkeys had broken the bridge and were sure to come crashing down into the ravine.
<br><br>
"Okay. Whatever you say," Elvinia agreed with a nod.
<br><br>
She felt Zen tug violently on her hand as he moved forward.
<br><br>
As she followed Zen, a strange thought crossed her mind. She realized that she had changed drastically.
<br><br>
She held a high status in the Source World, causing her peers to feel inferior to her. Even Efrain and Chaim felt she outshone them.
<br><br>
But this time, she had endured a number of setbacks before and after entering the Grand Sky Temple. This had greatly weakened her confidence.
<br><br>
Staying in the wooden hut had been bad for her nerves and she had gradually begun to follow Zen as meek as a lamb.
<br><br>
"Okay. Whatever you say."
<br><br>
She had never said words like this before.
<br><br>
Zen had no idea what Elvinia was thinking about as all he wanted was to get rid of the black monkeys.
<br><br>
As he ran wildly along the ravine, gigantic pincers emerged from the mud on the river and stretched towards him.
<br><br>
'How dare these crabs attack me?' Zen thought, frowning.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't taking the crabs seriously even though these were also creatures from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
He quickly grabbed one of the pincers, pulled out the body that had been hidden in the mud, and smashed it repeatedly to the ground.
<br><br>
It was a washbasin-sized crab with a strange white pattern on its shell.
<br><br>
The crab struggled against Zen's grip but before it could raise its pincers, Zen stepped on its shell and it shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Dong! Some sudden sounds from the ravine behind him startled him. He turned just in time to see the black monkeys jumping off the cliff, some falling to the ground and some into the river.
<br><br>
The black moneys obviously had strong bodies, brimming with energy as they jumped off the cliff.
<br><br>
They lived in the Dark Region all year round and had an unusually sharp vision and a keen sense of smell.
<br><br>
That was why they found him soon.
<br><br>
Zen wordlessly continued to run along the ravine.
<br><br>
He didn't know where the ravine led to.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A group of black monkeys chased after Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
These black monkeys were well-known in the Dark Region. They either lurked in the river or on the cliff. The creatures in the shrubs didn't dare to show up and as they watched Zen running away, they shook their heads and sighed pityingly. They didn't know how Zen had provoked the monkeys.
<br><br>
Crunch! The black monkey at the front of the group suddenly jumped up and grabbed a branch of a tree on the edge of the cliff. Swinging off of it, it took off and then pounced on Zen like a bat out of hell.
<br><br>
Zen felt the movement above him and looked up, stunned. He took Elvinia up in his arms and shouted, "Don't be afraid!" He then gathered his strength and threw Elvinia forward.
<br><br>
In the same moment, power erupted from his fists.
<br><br>
Many divine megatons of force filled his body.
<br><br>
He was weaker than the three-eyed boy, but if he had to face a black monkey alone...
<br><br>
Squeak! The monkey smiled scornfully at Zen's action.
<br><br>
Fearful that Zen would run away, it had summoned all its strength and applied it to fly forward towards Zen. It had wanted to cut off his path of escape. But it hadn't expected Zen to turn around and confront it instead! Did Zen have a death wish? Bang! Zen collided in midair with the black monkey.
<br><br>
One black monkey might not be as strong as the three-eyed boy, but it wasn't to be underestimated.
<br><br>
The impact was such that Zen felt his bones rattle within his body, as if they had been displaced.
<br><br>
Zen had rarely encountered such a strong opponent even in the Source World. But it looked like this kind of opponent was common in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Phew! Under the impact, the body of the black monkey bounced onto the cliff. Zen ran forward and caught Elvinia, who seemed to be falling in slow motion.
<br><br>
Once he had gathered her in his arms, he quickly made an escape.
<br><br>
Quack! Quack! The black monkey pushed itself up off the tree, gritting its teeth. It took a couple of breaths before launching off the cliff and chasing after Zen again.
<br><br>
The black monkeys chased Zen across dozens of miles along the ravine. It looked like they weren't about to let Zen go.
<br><br>
Zen was beginning to worry as he fled.
<br><br>
On one hand, he was afraid of choosing the wrong direction.
<br><br>
The black monkeys were social creatures. If he were to break into their nests along the ravine, even by mistake, he would be digging his own grave.
<br><br>
But his luck had always been good and he didn't need to worry about it for the time being.
<br><br>
On the other hand, he was worried about his physical strength.
<br><br>
As he fled, he was not only consuming the strength of his physical body, but also the Other Shore Power of the Strength God Totem.
<br><br>
If the power of the Other Shore Token were to be completely consumed, it would be replenished, but at an annoyingly slow pace.
<br><br>
Zen needed the divine crystals to replenish the Other Shore Power at a faster rate.
<br><br>
It would be easy for him to replenish the divine crystals if he could leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But he couldn't do that after entering the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
He had always used the Other Shore Power over the past few days. And since he was now running at full speed, the Other Shore Power was being consumed at a faster rate. Once the Other Shore Power of the Strength God Totem was exhausted, he would no longer be able to fight the black monkeys.
<br><br>
After more than ten miles, the ravine, which was originally over a thousand feet wide, began to narrow with each mile they crossed.
<br><br>
When the ravine was no longer than ten feet wide, Zen and Elvinia looked at each other, worried. It felt like the mountain was moving in on them.
<br><br>
And then, something weird happened.
<br><br>
The black monkeys that had been chasing after Zen and Elvinia stopped abruptly. They didn't dare to enter the narrow ravine. They stood at the border, chattering and shouting.
<br><br>
"Zen, they aren't coming in," said Elvinia.
<br><br>
"That's good, isn't it?" Zen said.
<br><br>
"What are they afraid of? I'm scared something bad is about to happen,"
<br><br>
Elvinia said worriedly.
<br><br>
"I know," Zen said, shrugging and gently lowering Elvinia to the ground.
<br><br>
"You knew that and still came running here? You are going to..."
<br><br>
Elvinia was reproaching Zen, but suddenly his body began to convulse before he collapsed to the ground.
<br><br>
Chapter 3301 Dangerous Ravine Zen had been consuming the Other Shore Power all the way. At this point, his power was almost completely exhausted.
<br><br>
Even in the last part of his journey, Zen continuously exploited the Strength God Totem, as well as the Other Shore Power of the Eye of Will. After finally exhausting both, he began exploiting the power of his own physical body.
<br><br>
In the end, he ended up exhausting his physical strength. His body was like an empty bottle when he fell to the ground.
<br><br>
Before she was able to finish her words, Elvinia was startled by Zen's fall.
<br><br>
"Zen, what's wrong?" she asked, her anxiety rising.
<br><br>
Rarely, perhaps even never, had Zen seen himself in such a weak situation.
<br><br>
While his strength was waning, his mind was still as sharp as always. "I'm fine…just exhausted."
<br><br>
"Exhausted?" Elvinia certainly wasn't expecting that. "How can this be?"
<br><br>
In theory, after reaching the True God Realm, a warrior would never deplete their strength.
<br><br>
When the Other Shore Power was used up, the Godly Ways' internal momentum could be used. Once this was used up, life vitality could take its place. But what happened once life vitality was used up as well? One's inner world would probably collapse.
<br><br>
Zen's situation was unique—after the Other Shore Power of both his Other Shore Tokens was exhausted, they were now absorbing Zen's own energy.
<br><br>
Two enormous whirlpools stood by the exit of his inner world, preventing Zen from utilizing the internal momentum and power of chaotic energy.
<br><br>
At this point, Zen found it difficult to even open his mouth—he gave up explaining things further to Elvinia.
<br><br>
The black monkeys that were hiding in the distance saw Zen fall clearly with their own eyes.
<br><br>
It was a dangerous area in the depths of the narrow ravine—even the black monkeys didn't dare to rush in mindlessly.
<br><br>
But Zen was right on the verge of it.
<br><br>
Originally, the monkeys were already planning to give up. But now that Zen was lying on the ground, barely able to move, they knew they had to take their chance.
<br><br>
Only a few steps into the ravine, they could catch him—they just had to make sure not to wake up the big creature inside.
<br><br>
"Crunch!"
<br><br>
"Creak!"
<br><br>
After a short discussion, three of the black monkeys tiptoed their way inside.
<br><br>
Afraid of disturbing the creature staying deep in the ravine, they moved as stealthily as they could.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. I'll be fine after resting for a bit." Zen reassured her.
<br><br>
The power of his Other Shore Tokens was restoring very slowly, but it wouldn't take long for his body to recover. Then he would have just enough strength to move and walk on his own.
<br><br>
"I want to let you rest but I don't think the black monkeys will be nice enough to wait," Elvinia said bitterly, glancing back at the three monkeys who weren't too far away.
<br><br>
Zen was stunned—he had no energy to check the situation himself. "Did they enter the ravine? Didn't you say they wouldn't dare step inside?"
<br><br>
Elvinia shook her head bitterly. "We might not be deep enough inside.
<br><br>
There are three of them walking to us."
<br><br>
"We're in trouble," Zen said with a bitter smile. He was at a loss for what to do.
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyes flashed with golden light—a strong desire to survive grew within her heart.
<br><br>
In all the time she'd been in the Dark Region, she had relied on Zen for protection. Now, it was time to rely on herself.
<br><br>
"Nope!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, she grabbed Zen's hand and let her soul energy burst before pulling him toward the narrow stream.
<br><br>
In the Source World, Zen's body would have been nothing to her.
<br><br>
But on the Other Shore, it was quite heavy for her Soul of Light. She could only depend on her soul power to drag Zen's body along.
<br><br>
Rustle! Rustle! Rustle! Zen's body was dragged on the ground. From where he lay, he could see Elvinia's movements.
<br><br>
Though he couldn't see her expression, he could tell she was exerting a great amount of effort to keep on dragging him.
<br><br>
"Just leave me here. You can go ahead on your own. The black monkeys wouldn't dare chase you inside," Zen said.
<br><br>
"Hmm…" Gritting her teeth, she continued. "They didn't dare come in here because of the danger awaiting them deep in the ravine. If you were captured… I would die alone here."
<br><br>
"But I can't protect you anymore," Zen said helplessly.
<br><br>
Without another word, Elvinia kept dragging Zen into the depths of the ravine.
<br><br>
The three monkeys didn't expect her to go so far in. They were creeping into the ravine quietly and steadily, but at that pace, they wouldn't catch up to her.
<br><br>
"Squeak?"
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
After stopping for a moment of discussion, they were ready to risk everything.
<br><br>
If they ran as fast as they could, they could catch up to Zen in mere seconds.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Suddenly, the monkeys accelerated, reaching for Zen.
<br><br>
Their change in pace had Elvinia rattled.
<br><br>
She could barely resist the weaker human-monkey monsters with her Soul of Light, let alone these ten-foot-tall black monkeys.
<br><br>
But at this moment, Elvinia felt no urge to escape. Her cold, hard eyes widened, and golden divine flames began emerging on the surface of her body, turning into golden whips that lashed at the black monkeys.
<br><br>
This soul attack was considered quite a powerful means in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. Only the best of superpowers could withstand it.
<br><br>
But in these black monkeys' eyes, such an attack was nothing—even if they were defenseless, Elvinia couldn't hurt them at all.
<br><br>
But right before her golden whips slashed them, they began screaming, as though the whips somehow scared them. Their faces grew full of fear before they turned back and ran away.
<br><br>
"What's going on?"
<br><br>
She wasn't expecting them to run away so quickly. Did the divine flame of the Sun Crow race somehow repel them? But before she could figure it out, black, brown, and gray tentacles emerged from behind her, one after another. In an instant, there were hundreds of them, covering up almost the entire space in the ravine.
<br><br>
Splash! The creeping tentacles looked like running black water as they went around Elvinia and rushed toward the black monkeys.
<br><br>
While they were running at great speed, the tentacles were faster.
<br><br>
"Cluck!"
<br><br>
"Squeak..."
<br><br>
"Quack..."
<br><br>
Soon, they were entangled in the tentacles and dragged into the depths of the ravine, leaving behind only sharp roars that echoed in the space.
<br><br>
When it went quiet, Elvinia was still standing in her spot, petrified.
<br><br>
The touch of the tentacles skimming over her soul surface made her Soul of Light tremble in fear. But why did they leave her and Zen behind? Chapter 3302 The Light A cool breeze swept over the ravine, brushing Elvinia's cheeks. She shivered violently.
<br><br>
Leaning against Zen, her Soul of Light trembled slightly as she gazed into the depths of the ravine. "Zen... What were those just now?"
<br><br>
"They must've been the tentacles of some monster," Zen replied.
<br><br>
"Then, why didn't they take us away?" she asked weakly.
<br><br>
Her voice shook as she spoke. Zen felt somewhat bad for her; even when she was in danger on the wooden bridge, Elvinia never showed emotion.
<br><br>
Now, it seemed she was truly scared, like a small child trembling beside him.
<br><br>
"I don't know," Zen said carefully. "Maybe they didn't like us."
<br><br>
Zen had stared danger in the face countless times before, so he was able to stay calm despite the circumstances. Elvinia, on the other hand, was obviously overwhelmed.
<br><br>
"Let's get out of here," pleaded Elvinia. "I can't stay here any longer!"
<br><br>
"What about the black monkeys outside? Are they gone already?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Elvinia turned to look, and then shook her head in disappointment. "No, they're still there."
<br><br>
"We can't leave then."
<br><br>
Zen struggled to get on his feet.
<br><br>
After having rested for a bit, he felt a little stronger. At the very least, he could stand up.
<br><br>
"Have you recovered already?" Elvinia asked in surprise.
<br><br>
Having seen Zen fall, she had been at a loss. Now that Zen was trying to get up, she felt a glimmer of hope.
<br><br>
While Elvinia might've come off as cold and independent, secretly, she was the opposite. She had just chosen to never show such weakness back in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Can... Can you help me up?" Zen asked helplessly.
<br><br>
Elvinia hurried to help him up.
<br><br>
Zen eyed the ravine. Then, he staggered to the mountainside and leaned against it.
<br><br>
The situation wasn't as bad as it could have been. It was good news that whatever was lurking in the depths of the ravine wasn't attacking them.
<br><br>
Their most pressing problem was those black monkeys, persistently waiting for them.
<br><br>
Around eight hours later, Zen noticed the surrounding area gradually turning darker. "The effect of the Darkness Fruit is weakening," he muttered under his breath.
<br><br>
He had tested the Darkness Fruit before; while the time limit of each fruit varied, the longest he'd seen was fourteen hours at most.
<br><br>
Once he noticed the effect was wearing off, he asked Elvinia to take out two fruits, one for each of them. As soon as they ingested it, gradually, the dark world lit up.
<br><br>
"How many Darkness Fruits do we have left?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Elvinia's space ring flashed. After counting, she answered, "Fourteen."
<br><br>
"Fourteen?" Zen frowned.
<br><br>
If they split the fruits between themselves, each would have seven. That meant they would last ninety eight hours at most, roughly four days.
<br><br>
If they couldn't find the black and white tree within four days, they would be completely swallowed by the darkness. Zen shook his head at the thought, he didn't want to imagine what'd happen if it came to that point.
<br><br>
Turning to look at the black monkeys, he gritted his teeth. The monkeys were still waiting for them. They needed to find a way to get out.
<br><br>
Zen slowly stood up. "Let's go in to have a look."
<br><br>
"Go in?" Elvinia's eyes widened in shock.
<br><br>
She couldn't help but shudder at the thought of those cold tentacles coiling around her frail body.
<br><br>
"We will die if we stay here," Zen said gravely.
<br><br>
Elvinia opened her mouth as if to say something, but no words came out.
<br><br>
What Zen said made sense. She refused to die in the Dark Region. 'Perhaps that monster isn't that terrifying, ' she quietly consoled herself.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen's physical strength had been restored by that time.
<br><br>
Exchanging one last glance, Zen nodded at Elvinia. Together, they steadily walked towards the depths of the ravine.
<br><br>
The deeper they got, the narrower the ravine became. When they had started, it was around ten feet wide. After a couple of minutes of walking, the gap was only around two feet wide. Zen and Elvinia could only move sideways to fit through it.
<br><br>
After what seemed like an eternity of inching through that narrow gap, they suddenly saw light streaming in from the distance. The two of them looked towards the light with amazement written all over their faces.
<br><br>
As soon as their eyes adjusted to the light, they noticed paintings scrawled on the walls of the ravine. Upon studying them closely, Zen gasped. The paintings were huge Sanskrit words! As his eyes followed the trail of Sanskrit words, he realized they terminated in a triangular cave on the mountain wall. Black tentacles extended from the cave, lazily making their way to the ground.
<br><br>
"Those tentacles..." Elvinia was taken aback.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! At the sound of Elvinia's voice, the tentacles suddenly perked up.
<br><br>
They quickly rushed towards the two, climbing the walls of the mountain with incredible speed.
<br><br>
Zen clamped his hand over Elvinia's mouth. The two lay prone on the ground.
<br><br>
Slowly, the black tentacles scanned the walls, prodding each crevice.
<br><br>
Elvinia whimpered as they got close, but Zen kept his hand firmly on her mouth. Confused, the tentacles retreated.
<br><br>
Elvinia shuddered. If she had entered the Other Shore with her physical body, she knew she'd probably faint if she felt the cool, slimy touch of those black tentacles.
<br><br>
However, something dawned on her. Her eyes flashed excitedly as she gestured at Zen, but he shook his head, indicating she needed to stay quiet.
<br><br>
He knew what she was trying to say; he had realized it, too. The tentacles couldn't see them.
<br><br>
Both the black monkeys and the tentacles were creatures from the Dark Region. Thus, the tentacles should be able to find the black monkeys.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia, on the other hand, were not from the Dark Region; their forms were different from those of the creatures in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The two of them could adapt to the environment of the Dark Region only by absorbing the energy of the Darkness Fruits.
<br><br>
The tentacles must have sensed something, but couldn't confirm what it was.
<br><br>
Zen patted Elvinia's shoulder, encouraging her to keep moving forward. As long as they didn't make a sound, they should be safe.
<br><br>
After inching a bit further along the ravine, Zen noticed there were more triangular caves.
<br><br>
It seemed, every five to six hundred feet, there was a triangular cave. From each cave, countless black tentacles hung lazily. Other than the tentacles, it didn't look as though anything else lurked here.
<br><br>
As Zen carefully observed the walls, Elvinia suddenly pointed towards the front.
<br><br>
Turning to where she was pointing, he saw there was a round valley on the other side.
<br><br>
There were also huge Sanskrit words engraved on the wall of the valley.
<br><br>
The wall was covered with densely packed triangular caves as well, and again, huge tentacles hung from the cave entrances.
<br><br>
However, Zen's gaze was fixed on the center of the valley, where the darkness had disappeared A gentle ray of light pierced through the darkness like a sharp blade. The ring of light covered a range of no more than ten feet. At the center of the ring was a tombstone, basking in the ray of light.
<br><br>
Although Zen didn't know where the light was coming from and why it appeared in the Dark Region, he was sure that the space it illuminated didn't belong to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Chapter 3303 Shelter The past few days, Zen and Elvinia had been living under the candlelight.
<br><br>
Compared to the absolute darkness of the Dark Region, the candlelight seemed extremely bright -- but still, it was nothing compared to actual sunlight outside the Dark Region.
<br><br>
When they started taking the Darkness Fruits, they adapted to the darkness, being able to see their surroundings.
<br><br>
They had grown accustomed to living in the darkness, so once they saw the dazzling bright light streaming into the Dark Region, they were stunned.
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyes widened. Leaning on Zen's shoulder, she whispered, "That place covered by the light... it doesn't belong to the Dark Region, right?"
<br><br>
Anyone who was in the Dark Region and the temples would be unable to leave the Other Shore. But in other places, they'd be able to leave the Other Shore and return to their bodies normally.
<br><br>
Elvinia had grown tired of the Dark Region, having been trapped here for a long time. She wanted to leave as soon as possible.
<br><br>
But when she considered leaving, she sighed in resignation.
<br><br>
According to the rules of the Other Shore, they could only enter it from the place they left last time. So, if she tried leaving now, she would only return here the next time she entered the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The tentacles that hung from the mouths of the triangular caves were extremely sensitive. They had no eyes, but they could easily sense their prey by following their energy. While Zen and Elvinia had energy within them, because they weren't creatures born in the Dark Region, the tentacles couldn't seem to sense them.
<br><br>
But as Elvinia whispered, the tentacles suddenly tensed.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
Thousands of tentacles whirled into action, filling the air around the valley with a black indiscernible mass. It was as though a dark windstorm formed.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Elvinia immediately shut up.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, remained calm. As long as he was beginning to comprehend how the creatures of the dark worked, they wouldn't be as scary.
<br><br>
Gently and quietly, he pulled Elvinia to the side.
<br><br>
The black whirlwind shot towards the spot where Elvinia had been standing only a moment later. After finding nothing there, the black tentacles retreated to their respective triangular caves.
<br><br>
"Isn't this fun?" Zen said to Elvinia with a sly smile.
<br><br>
Elvinia, however, just shuddered. The mere sight of those menacing tentacles made her uncomfortable; she didn't dare provoke them further.
<br><br>
However, as Zen spoke, the tentacles rushed out from the caves once more.
<br><br>
"You, you, you..."
<br><br>
Elvinia looked to Zen helplessly, desperate to tell him to shut up. But she didn't dare to make a sound. With a nervous gulp, she followed Zen as he moved to the side to dodge the tentacles. The tentacles circled around the valley again, seemingly confused that they couldn't catch their prey, then resignedly returned to their caves.
<br><br>
As this was happening, Zen carefully observed the process.
<br><br>
Since these tentacles lurked here, there shouldn't be any other Dark Region creatures in the valley. They should be able to reach the column of light safely.
<br><br>
But Zen hesitated. There might be traps within the light column.
<br><br>
Cautiously, Zen approached the column of light. The closer he got, the more he could see what was within the light.
<br><br>
A lone bronze tombstone lay in the center of the light. Seven stars had been engraved on its surface. Underneath the stars was a row of strange words; they weren't Sanskrit words, so they must've been in a language belonging to a special civilization.
<br><br>
Behind the tombstone was a small tomb, only around five or six feet wide.
<br><br>
Some green weeds and petite flowers grew on top of the tomb.
<br><br>
Just as Zen and Elvinia were closing in on the column of light and they were about sixty or seventy feet away from the tomb, suddenly a circle of purple light glowed from the ground.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
After the circle of light appeared, sharp sounds pierced the air, like an alarm blaring throughout the whole valley.
<br><br>
Cracks suddenly appeared under the triangular caves, causing the caves to collapse. On one side of the valley, small, round portals appeared. Monsters the size of a young child emerged from the portals, heading straight for Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
These monsters were bipedal. From the neck upwards, they had the face of a pig. As they ran towards the two, they waved black spears in the air.
<br><br>
"Who dares to trespass into our holy tomb?"
<br><br>
"Catch them!"
<br><br>
"Don't let them approach the holy tomb!"
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia were momentarily too stunned to react -- after all, these pig-faced monsters spoke in the human tongue! Before they could respond, the tentacles also began to move.
<br><br>
While they originally weren't able to detect the existence of Elvinia and Zen, with the appearance of these pig-faced monsters, the situation suddenly changed drastically.
<br><br>
It seemed they had some sort of a symbiotic relationship. The pig-faced monsters served as eyes to the unseeing tentacles. The tentacles shot into the air once more. Only this time, they knew where their prey lay.
<br><br>
"Damn!"
<br><br>
Zen cried.
<br><br>
He didn't expect any other creatures lay hidden in the walls of the valley.
<br><br>
His eyes darted around as he tried to figure out the best plan of action. It was impossible for them to leave the valley in a short time. Then, his eyes landed on the copper tombstone. He gritted his teeth. There was no other way.
<br><br>
"Head for the light column," Zen told Elvinia.
<br><br>
Seeing the tentacles rush out again, Elvinia was pretty annoyed. But her experience in the past few days made her know it was useless to complain.
<br><br>
"Charge!"
<br><br>
Elvinia cried as she ran towards the light.
<br><br>
Zen staggered from behind her. He only had some of his physical strength restored and could barely keep up with her.
<br><br>
Like a black whirlwind, thousands of tentacles shot towards them.
<br><br>
Aside from the tentacles, the pig-faced monsters also moved fast. Some of them threw their spears at the two.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Black spears came at them, like a swarm of locusts.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia were very close to the holy tomb, and it would only take them a few seconds to reach it. They helplessly continued to run as fast as they could towards the tomb.
<br><br>
Another volley of spears came flying at them. Just as the spears and the tentacles were about to reach them, Zen mustered all his remaining strength to pounce forward. As he leapt, he pushed Elvinia into the column of light as well. He rolled in behind her, looking desperate to take shelter from the attacks.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...
<br><br>
Ear-piercing shrieks suddenly burst from behind Zen as he landed within the column of light.
<br><br>
The tentacles whirled into the column of light like crazy. As they were creatures of the Dark Region, they'd die as soon as they came into contact with the light. But still, they continued to charge after Zen. Once they touched the light, they became nothing but ash. The air was filled with the pungent scent of thousands of scorched pigs.
<br><br>
Besides the tentacles, the black spears shot by the pig-faced monsters also disintegrated once they came into contact with the light.
<br><br>
Elvinia sat inside the light column, her body trembling. She wasn't used to a life of narrowly escaping death.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Some tentacles were stubborn and still attempted to reach for Zen, charging fearlessly into the column of light.
<br><br>
Some thick tentacles weren't burned completely after they rushed into the light column. They fell on the ground and on Zen's body, still jumping like mad. They quickly turned into a hapless, seared mess. The smell of char filled Zen's nostrils.
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters stood right before the light. They roared, cursed, and even stabbed their black spears into the light column in fury.
<br><br>
"Come out!"
<br><br>
"Why are you hiding in there? You cowards!"
<br><br>
"I will make you die a graveless death!"
<br><br>
However, Zen just heaved a sigh of relief. He knew they only cursed at him because there was nothing more they could do.
<br><br>
Chapter 3304 Return The tentacles lashed around wildly for quite a long time before finally settling.
<br><br>
Light could swallow up all the creatures of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Even though the tentacles could regenerate, they still couldn't afford to lose that much energy.
<br><br>
"The creatures of the Dark Region... They're more fragile than I thought,"
<br><br>
Zen remarked.
<br><br>
The fruits of the black and white tree proved extremely beneficial. After eating the Darkness Fruits, both he and Elvinia were granted the ability of adapting to the Dark Region's environment.
<br><br>
On the other hand, if Dark Region creatures ate the Light Fruits, then they would be able to adapt to the outside world.
<br><br>
However, the three-eyed boy and the huge ape could only adapt to the candlelight and were unable to leave.
<br><br>
"If the creatures of the Dark Region weren't afraid of light, then they would have ruled the Other Shore," Elvinia said.
<br><br>
Zen could only nod in agreement. "I can't refute that."
<br><br>
The creatures of the Other Shore were much stronger than the Souls of Light, but the creatures here in the Dark Region were far stronger than those on the Other Shore. If the Dark Region's inhabitants had the ability to walk freely in the light, then they would be an unstoppable force.
<br><br>
"I wonder where the light is coming from?" Zen muttered to himself as he looked directly up to the sky.
<br><br>
Darkness was everywhere save for that one strange hole above them where light filtered through, bathing them with illuminated safety.
<br><br>
He would've never believed such a place existed if he hadn't seen it with his own eyes.
<br><br>
"I just want to know if we can get out of here," Elvinia told him. She too couldn't help but gaze at that strange light that shone above them.
<br><br>
With a weary sigh, Elvinia then began to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune.
<br><br>
Buzz! As soon as the Illusion Breaking Rune broke through the illusions, Elvinia's Soul of Light began to dissipate. She flashed Zen a cold smile, no longer sad and weary, just before fully fading in the wind.
<br><br>
"She really left," Zen remarked.
<br><br>
Standing there alone, he felt the weak power of his Other Shore Tokens in his body. He figured that perhaps it would be best if he also left the Other Shore and replenished his power.
<br><br>
However, as soon as he made that decision, the pig-faced monsters around the light column stepped aside.
<br><br>
One of them, a dark blue one, walked towards Zen and stopped just by the edge of the light column.
<br><br>
This one raised its hand and silence immediately fell amongst its peers.
<br><br>
"Human friend from outside the Dark Region," the pig-faced monster greeted in a very polite tone.
<br><br>
Zen previously had no interest in these monsters.
<br><br>
However, this change of attitude was very much welcome.
<br><br>
He and Elvinia had been safe within the light column but it was only a temporary sanctuary. Now that Elvinia had gone back to the Oneness Sky Palace, Zen figured that he now had to find a way out for both of them on his own.
<br><br>
He smiled at the pig-faced monster. "What can I do for you?"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monster huffed as it looked at Zen. "Can you come out of the holy tomb?" it asked.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "No."
<br><br>
He wasn't stupid. Walking out of the light column would mean instant death.
<br><br>
"This is our holy tomb, a sacred place to our kind. We hold it in the highest reverence. Your presence here offends us," the pig-faced monster insisted.
<br><br>
The young man couldn't help but roll his eyes. He and Elvinia didn't mean to intrude into anyone's sacred place. They were just seeking a safe place from those black monkeys. Zen could only look at the pig-faced monster with a wry smile. "What do you want me to do then?"
<br><br>
"Can you come out of the holy tomb?" the pig-faced monster repeated. Zen pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration.
<br><br>
Despite having the ability to speak the human language, it didn't seem as if the pig-faced monster was very intelligent.
<br><br>
Zen heaved a sigh, looking at the strange monsters that were trying to kick him out of their holy tomb. "Bye."
<br><br>
That was the last thing he said before he began to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune. As he murmured the words, his body started to blur before finally disappearing.
<br><br>
As soon as he disappeared, the pig-monsters began to curse loudly. Vulgar atrocities spilled from their lips, especially the leader's.
<br><br>
In the Phoenix Palace, there was a huge magic array.
<br><br>
This array was quite special-looking as it emitted a faint golden glow. A body sat in the middle.
<br><br>
Soon, the light emanating from it grew more intense and golden flames began to lick at the array, releasing a terrifying burst of energy.
<br><br>
This energy had come from Flamine who was currently controlling the magic array.
<br><br>
Three old men stood behind her. They were famous powerhouses of the Phoenix Palace and recognized as great masters of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
One of the three old men stepped forward, a helpless look evident on his face. "Lady Flamine, we've tried it three times already! Given Princess Elvinia's location, it would be hard to pull her out. The only way we'd be able to do so is if she happens to walk by a place where the energy is weak."
<br><br>
In the Source World, there were some methods of forcing people out of the Other Shore. Although the Soul Binding Thread could trap people on the Other Shore, they could be forcefully pulled out.
<br><br>
However, the power of the Grand Sky Temple and the Dark Region was so great that even if Flamine set up an array, she still failed to wake Elvinia up.
<br><br>
"Contribute your soul power!" she ordered, the determination on her face never fading.
<br><br>
She knew Elvinia was fine, but the reactions Elvinia had recently worried her.
<br><br>
As soon as she said this, Elvinia's body, which had been sitting in the middle of the array, slightly trembled. Fear crossed her sleeping features and she was shaking as if she was afraid of something.
<br><br>
Flamine was in distress. She didn't know what her daughter was currently going through for her to have reacted this way.
<br><br>
"It's not a problem to contribute our soul power. What we're worried about is Princess Elvinia! Our combined soul power might be too strong and she might not be able to withstand it!" another old man said with a pleading voice.
<br><br>
If they did as Flamine said, then they might accidentally tear Elvinia's soul apart.
<br><br>
"We won't know unless we try! She's so weak. She might die on the Other Shore at any moment!" Flamine raged.
<br><br>
As soon as the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace returned, they immediately headed to Flamine and gave her a full report of the situation.
<br><br>
She was well aware of the dangers they had faced and there was no way she was letting her daughter stay one more minute in that place.
<br><br>
Under Flamine's strict orders, the three old men had no choice but to obey.
<br><br>
The magic array was reactivated and Flamine released the divine flames of the Sun Crow race to control it.
<br><br>
However, at that exact moment, Elvinia suddenly opened her eyes! "Mother?" she exclaimed in surprise, seeing Flamine and the three old men before her.
<br><br>
All concentration Flamine had flew right out of the window the moment she heard her daughter's voice. With a trembling lip, she ran towards the magic array and swooped down to take Elvinia in her arms.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry, Mother," Elvinia murmured.
<br><br>
This apology sparked something in Flamine's heart.
<br><br>
The mother and daughter pair did not really get along well with each other.
<br><br>
Elvinia always showed indifference and sometimes even hostility to her mother.
<br><br>
Flamine never expected her to apologize like this after returning from the Dark Region.

<br><br>

<br><br>
Chapter 3305 Wake Up "Never mind. I'm just glad you're okay," said Flamine softly, cradling her daughter in her arms.
<br><br>
What was important was her daughter had finally come back safely.
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyelashes fluttered as she tried to keep her eyes open. Forcing a smile, she murmured, "It's not that simple."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Not understanding what Elvinia meant, Flamine anxiously held Elvinia's hands and looked her up and down carefully.
<br><br>
Afraid that her daughter's soul had been hurt, she breathed a sigh of relief when she found that Elvinia was perfectly fine.
<br><br>
"I'm still in the Dark Region," Elvinia replied.
<br><br>
When the three old men heard her words, they exchanged worried glances.
<br><br>
One of them cut in, "If you are still in the Dark Region, how did you leave?"
<br><br>
There were special ways to enter the Dark Region. They were rarely ever used, but some masters in the Oneness Sky Palace, like Flamine, knew about them.
<br><br>
Flamine's eyes widened in shock. She couldn't imagine how her daughter managed to escape from the Other Shore if she was in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Elvinia glanced apprehensively at the three old men. "Uncles, would you mind leaving me and my mother alone?"
<br><br>
Even though the three men were from Phoenix Palace, there were some things Elvinia only wanted to disclose to her mother.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, you have just returned from the Other Shore. Please rest well," one of them said meekly.
<br><br>
"If you have any problem, you can approach me anytime," another one added.
<br><br>
The third uncle nodded wordlessly.
<br><br>
Once the three old men left, only Elvinia and Flamine were left in the huge palace.
<br><br>
Then, Elvinia turned to her mother seriously and explained what happened in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Flamine had already heard of what happened in the Grand Sky Temple and the wooden hut. The disciples of the Phoenix Palace had already reported to her in detail. But she knew nothing about what happened after Dorothy, Chaim and the others left.
<br><br>
"Has that corporeal body been protecting you the whole time you were in the Dark Region?" Flamine asked.
<br><br>
Zen's face flashed in Elvinia's mind, albeit a bit vaguely. After all, she had only physically met Zen twice in the Oneness Sky Palace, even though they had spent a long time on the Other Shore together.
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded. "Mother, do you know who the corporeal body is?"
<br><br>
Flamine shook her head. Only a few people in the Oneness Sky Palace knew Zen could enter the Other Shore with his corporeal body.
<br><br>
"Who is he? Is he a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?"
<br><br>
After all, the mysterious man had helped the Oneness Sky Palace so often.
<br><br>
It was very likely he was a disciple from there. But Flamine couldn't figure out who he was exactly.
<br><br>
After a brief pause, Elvinia whispered, "It's Zen Luo..."
<br><br>
A flash of excitement lit up Flamine's beautiful eyes.
<br><br>
Although she had suspected this, she still felt a tinge of shock.
<br><br>
The first time she had encountered Zen, he had broken into the Phoenix Palace, which was no ordinary feat. He had even managed to suppress Elvinia. Moreover, his Other Shore Token was of the strengthening type, which was nothing special! While there were many amazing disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace, in the eyes of Flamine, no one was her daughter's match, except Zen.
<br><br>
Her happy expression quickly shifted to one of worry. "Since you're back, has Zen also returned?"
<br><br>
"He should have," Elvinia answered. "Mother, listen to me..."
<br><br>
She then went on to tell Flamine about what they had seen in the Dark Region. When she mentioned the light column, Flamine raised her eyebrows curiously. Something seemed to cross her mind, but she didn't say it aloud.
<br><br>
"Only after we entered the light column were we able to leave the Other Shore. If we return, we will still be trapped in there," Elvinia said helplessly.
<br><br>
It was similar to being trapped in the whirlpool in the Sea of Truth. If the Souls of Light were trapped somewhere on the Other Shore, it would be difficult to improve their cultivation in the future.
<br><br>
Elvinia also knew that asking for her mother's help was probably futile.
<br><br>
It would be very difficult for Souls of Light in upper stages to enter lower stages. Even if they did manage to enter, they would still be in great danger in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
After a while, Flamine said cautiously, "I'm going to see Zen."
<br><br>
"I'll come with you," Elvinia immediately answered.
<br><br>
Flamine raised an eyebrow at her daughter in surprise. The Elvinia she knew wouldn't have been so amicable.
<br><br>
Of course, Elvinia understood what was going on in her mother's mind. Her usual emotionless face turned bright red with embarrassment. "I just want to discuss with him how we will get out of this troublesome situation..."
<br><br>
"That's what I thought, but why are you blushing?" Flamine said with a knowing smile.
<br><br>
Elvinia felt even more embarrassed. Pursing her lips, she tried to resume her usual cold expression.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Letitia was busy thinking about the Other Shore. She had never been there before, so it was hard for her to imagine just how dangerous it was.
<br><br>
Every time Dorothy returned, she would ask about the situation there.
<br><br>
Dorothy understood her worries and had patiently answered her every time.
<br><br>
The events that took place in the Grand Sky Temple had made an impact on the Ear Mice. They had no intention of opening the temple again in the near future, so these days, the thirteen stages on the Other Shore were quite peaceful.
<br><br>
However, when Letitia asked Dorothy for news this time around, Dorothy shook her head in worry. "The candlelight is out," was the only thing she said.
<br><br>
Standing at the entrance to the Grand Sky Temple, she could see the three wooden huts and a band of light leading to the huts. The band of light was the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
Two hours ago, Dorothy stood at that very same spot to investigate. At the time, the band of light and the huts were nowhere to be seen.
<br><br>
That could only mean one thing: the candlelight went out.
<br><br>
Without the candlelight, both the Souls of Light and the corporeal bodies would be swallowed up by darkness. One could only imagine the consequences.
<br><br>
Dorothy hurriedly withdrew from the Other Shore and rushed to find Letitia.
<br><br>
The two of them both bolted to the second floor to check up on Zen. To their relief, they found that he was still sitting there, breathing evenly.
<br><br>
Although they did not know what had happened in the Dark Region, it was still good news that Zen was still alive.
<br><br>
This time, when Dorothy arrived, Margaret didn't taunt her.
<br><br>
Zen had been trapped for so long. She was getting more and more anxious.
<br><br>
These days, she had been sitting in silence at the end of the corridor on the second floor, looking into the room from time to time, hoping that Zen would wake up.
<br><br>
"I didn't expect the cultivation on the Other Shore would be so dangerous,"
<br><br>
Letitia said with a sigh.
<br><br>
In her mind, cultivation methods and theurgies might make one mad, but compared to the Other Shore, these were nothing! "Strictly speaking, entering the Other Shore isn't a kind of cultivation. It's simply an adventure," Dorothy explained. "Countless talents have died on the Other Shore since ancient times."
<br><br>
Letitia shuddered at the word "die". With an indignant huff, she said, "My husband has good luck. I believe he will return safely."
<br><br>
Suddenly, a deep voice interrupted them. "Oh? How are you so confident in your husband?"
<br><br>
The women turned to look. To their surprise and delight, Zen smiled at them from where he sat.
<br><br>
Chapter 3306 Promise Ever since Dorothy had explained Zen's predicament, Letitia and Margaret had been sick with worry.
<br><br>
Sometimes, Letitia found herself envying Laquisha, Nelly and Lavender, since they were blissfully ignorant, cultivating within the Phoenix Palace walls.
<br><br>
At times, she even regretted leaving Zen's inner world. If she had stayed in the fairy palace, she wouldn't have had any clue as to what was happening in the outside.
<br><br>
But, all of a sudden, these worries disappeared the second she heard her lover's voice.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
From the end of the corridor, Margaret had transformed into a purple shadow that flew towards Zen.
<br><br>
Letitia also threw herself into Zen's arms.
<br><br>
"Plop..."
<br><br>
Zen, who had been physically exhausted when he rushed into the light column, felt little to no strength now.
<br><br>
So when the two women pounced on him, Zen fell backwards under their weight.
<br><br>
Surprised that he was so weak, Letitia hurriedly asked, "Darling, is there something wrong with you?"
<br><br>
"I'm fine," Zen answered with a smile. He fondly stroked Letitia's hair.
<br><br>
"Are you hungry? Do you have no strength left?" Margaret asked with concern, laying her hand gently on Zen's arm.
<br><br>
"You're half right," Zen replied with a chuckle.
<br><br>
"So..."
<br><br>
The two women lovingly gushed at Zen, and he patiently replied to all their queries with a serene expression on his face.
<br><br>
Dorothy sat opposite to Zen, but she felt like an outsider.
<br><br>
While Zen was still trapped on the Other Shore, she had often visited them.
<br><br>
Here, she learned that Zen had several lovers, and that there were even three more cultivating in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Although Dorothy maintained her composure, internally, she cursed at Zen.
<br><br>
She never expected Zen was like this...
<br><br>
However, she too was relieved that Zen had finally woken up. She smiled slightly. She knew nothing could trap Zen Luo, not even the Dark Region! After he answered all their questions, Zen gently flicked his hand. His space ring appeared, and he took a considerable amount of divine crystals. Then, he crushed them and threw them into his cinnabar field.
<br><br>
These divine crystals released their energy and nourished Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Zen's two Other Shore Tokens absorbed these divine crystals' energy greedily, and then transformed the energy into the Other Shore Power. It didn't take Zen long to crush more than a hundred thousand divine crystals into his cinnabar field.
<br><br>
After most of his Other Shore Power was restored, Zen finally relaxed.
<br><br>
Turning to Dorothy, he smiled. "So, you successfully retreated from the Grand Sky Temple!"
<br><br>
In the Dark Region, Zen didn't know what was going on outside. He had been worried that Dorothy would be in danger when they had parted ways.
<br><br>
"Yes. How about Elvinia? Is she all right?" Dorothy asked.
<br><br>
Both Zen and Elvinia had been asked to stay in the Dark Region by the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
She clenched her fists. Dorothy had always felt that she should've been the one by Zen's side.
<br><br>
"We are still trapped in that damned place," Zen answered in a frustrated tone.
<br><br>
"You and Elvinia are still trapped? Then how were you able to leave?"
<br><br>
Dorothy asked in surprise.
<br><br>
Since there were no outsiders present, Zen decided it was safe to tell them everything. Briefly, he explained to them what had happened to him and Elvinia in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The more Zen talked, the more worried Dorothy became. "What should we do... Will you be trapped there forever?"
<br><br>
"There is always a solution," Zen consoled her. "At least now, I can come back to replenish my strength."
<br><br>
If Zen used all his Other Shore Power, he could fight a black monkey.
<br><br>
However, once that was used up, he would be left defenseless against all the other creatures there.
<br><br>
"It's a pity that I don't have any candles," Dorothy murmured, biting her lips.
<br><br>
If she had candles, she would've entered the Dark Region again to attempt to rescue Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Seeing how Dorothy cared about him so much, Zen was moved. "Don't worry," he said and smiled. "I'll definitely find a way out."
<br><br>
Just as Zen was speaking, Trish suddenly burst into the room. "Tia, there're two guests—" Her eyes widened when she saw Zen. "Mr. Luo, you are awake!"
<br><br>
During Zen's stay on the Other Shore, Trish had reported everything happening in the house to Letitia.
<br><br>
Hence, she was surprised to see Zen awake.
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen nodded. "Who are the guests?"
<br><br>
Before Trish could reply, two elegant figures emerged from behind her. One wore a blue robe, the other, a green dress. It was Elvinia in her physical form and her mother, Flamine.
<br><br>
At the sight of Flamine, Zen instantly knew the purpose of their visit.
<br><br>
Since Elvinia was able to find out his true identity, she had probably told her mother by now.
<br><br>
Zen stood up and bowed to Flamine. "I didn't know that you were here, Lady Flamine, so I didn't come to greet you. My apologies."
<br><br>
Flamine smiled slightly, her eyes twinkling charmingly. "It's easy for me to forgive you. After all, you must protect my daughter and make sure she makes it out of the Dark Region unharmed!"
<br><br>
"Mother!" Elvinia whined.
<br><br>
Dorothy frowned. Elvinia had entered the Dark Region voluntarily, so Zen had nothing to do with it. But Flamine seemed to be putting the blame on him.
<br><br>
"If I can safely leave that damned place, I will definitely protect Princess Elvinia," Zen replied respectfully.
<br><br>
To his surprise, though, Flamine was dissatisfied with his polite answer.
<br><br>
Taking a step forward, she looked at him fiercely. "Elvinia is my only daughter. I won't allow anything bad to happen to her." Her eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
"Promise me, Zen."
<br><br>
Zen frowned slightly, and even Letitia and Margaret watched uneasily.
<br><br>
As a formidable woman, Flamine keenly sensed their emotions. It was out of character for her to be unusually stern. "As long as Elvinia can leave the Dark Region and get out of the Other Shore safely, I will reward you graciously."
<br><br>
If it were anyone else who talked to him like this, Zen would probably have sent the guest out immediately.
<br><br>
However, when Zen broke into the Phoenix Palace, it was Flamine who had showed him the way. Besides, she had also helped him in the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
Zen could understand that Flamine's unreasonable demand was out of her love and worry for her beloved daughter.
<br><br>
Zen bowed to her again. "Don't worry, Lady Flamine. The Dark Region is not as dangerous as you think. We are not in a desperate situation."
<br><br>
At least, in the meantime, they were safe within the column of light.
<br><br>
What was more, those pig-faced monsters were not that intelligent. With these cards, they still had a chance to escape.
<br><br>
Zen's sincere expression made Flamine calm down a little. The most fearful thing for her was that Zen would leave her daughter behind. All the way from the Phoenix Palace, she had been trying to figure out how she would talk to Zen.
<br><br>
In order to get the answer she wanted, she risked being a bit rude to Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3307 The Purified Being Flamine lowered her eyes. Softly she said, "I have been to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
I know how dangerous it is. Maybe it's too much to ask you to protect Elvinia, but I hope you will do your best."
<br><br>
"You've been to the Dark Region?" Zen said, raising his eyebrows.
<br><br>
Flamine smiled. "It's not the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen, but the one of Stage Twenty."
<br><br>
As one reached higher and higher stages on the Other Shore, the likelihood increased of encountering the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Powerful warriors like Flamine, however, had extremely powerful Souls of Light, and were equal to the challenges of the Dark Region. Flamine, for instance, would have no trouble overpowering the creatures on the Other Shore and in the Dark Region that Zen and his companions had faced in Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
"Have you ever heard of the light column in the Dark Region?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
At the mention of the light column, Flamine's eyes flashed. Elvinia noticed and shot her mother a questioning look.
<br><br>
Earlier, when Elvinia had told her mother about the light column in the Phoenix Palace, Flamine had also reacted strangely. What did she know about the valley? "I've already heard about it from Elvinia," Flamine said solemnly. "The appearance of a light column in the Dark Region, well, generally suggests the presence of a purified being."
<br><br>
"What do you mean by a purified being?" Zen said, looking interested.
<br><br>
"Some creatures can break through the restrictions of the Dark Region and become the strongest. We call them purified beings, and no one can match them in the Dark Region," Flamine explained. "Of course, they are also extremely powerful even outside the Dark Region."
<br><br>
Many years ago, Flamine had witnessed the birth of a purified being.
<br><br>
She had been in the Dark Region of Stage Twenty. She clearly saw a white light shoot up into the sky, pierce through the darkness, and freely fly within the Dark Region.
<br><br>
In response, the powerful creatures in the Dark Region had surrounded the light and launched an attack on the purified being. Even the other creatures outside the Dark Region had tried to stop the purified being from leaving the confines of the Dark Region. Some powerful Souls of Light had also joined the battle.
<br><br>
But no one could defeat the purified being. Within its light, it was impervious to the attacks of creatures in the Dark Region. The other creatures outside the Dark Region also failed to defeat the purified being.
<br><br>
At that time, Flamine recalled, the most powerful group in Stage Twenty was the Heavenly Element race. They had ruled over at least seventy percent of the territory of Stage Twenty. However, the purified being had engaged them in battle. Alone against the strongest members of the Heavenly Element race, the purified being had driven them into a small corner of Stage Twenty.
<br><br>
Zen listened closely to the story. "What does the purified being want?" he asked Flamine.
<br><br>
"It wants its own race to dominate all others," Flamine said simply. "The purified being I am telling you about comes from the Rain race. As far as I know, the Rain race still controls Stage Twenty. Once you reach Stage Twenty, you will see for yourself the proliferation of the Rain race. By now, they must be stronger than ever."
<br><br>
Indeed, any mention of the beasts of the Rain race in Stage Twenty was enough to strike fear into anyone in the Desire World. Few, if any, were willing to stay too long in Stage Twenty.
<br><br>
"Since the purified being is so powerful, why don't other races try to win it over?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Win it over?" Flamine repeated thoughtfully. "I'm sure someone has tried that. But how can we, as Souls of Light from the Source World, manage to win it over?"
<br><br>
The creatures of the Source World went to the Other Shore primarily to obtain Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
For the creatures on the Other Shore, the Other Shore Tokens were nothing special. They themselves could also be considered as Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Moreover, the purified being could dominate a whole stage.
<br><br>
Zen reflected on what Flamine had told him. He now knew several important things about the purified being.
<br><br>
There should have been a pig-faced monster buried in the tomb of the light column.
<br><br>
Nobody knew how or why the pig-faced monster had turned into a purified being. Then it had attracted the light outside the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Once it was reborn, it would lead its race in bloody battle. With its power, their race could become the strongest force in Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
Thus the pig-faced monsters gathered around the light column and described what lay within it as a holy tomb. It was the symbol of their hopes for prospering their race. They had been afraid that Zen would desecrate it.
<br><br>
Flamine was watching Zen. She asked directly, "When will you return to the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
She couldn't help but feel conflicted about her daughter. If Elvinia never returned to the Other Shore, she would have a lifetime of safety and comfort in the Oneness Sky Palace. She could even be happy. However, her cultivation level would stagnate where it was right now and never increase again. Just like Winchell's son, Evaristus. If Zen hadn't saved him, he would still be trapped in the whirlpool.
<br><br>
Zen said, "I don't know when the purified being will awaken. So the sooner we return, the better."
<br><br>
Once the purified being woke up, the white light that enveloped the tomb would disappear, and he and Elvinia would fall into darkness once again.
<br><br>
They would die there unless they ate the Darkness Fruits.
<br><br>
"You may leave in three days," Flamine said slowly, biting her lips. "I wish to spend more time with Elvinia before you go."
<br><br>
Flamine appreciated Zen's strength and knew he would do his best to protect Elvinia in the Dark Region. However, she was horribly aware of the dangers lurking in the Dark Region, and knew there was a chance that her daughter would not survive. She wanted to delay sending Elvinia back to the Dark Region for as long as possible.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Athemar, Goran, and the others received the news that Zen had woken up. They immediately paid him a visit at the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
Like Flamine, they were familiar with the known history of the light column. The knowledge they had was riddled with gaps and shrouded in mystery. Athemar and Goran also couldn't explain the origins of the purified being.
<br><br>
The key point was that it had happened in the Lust World. This meant that neither Athemar nor Goran could lend a helping hand. They could only offer advice, and so they repeatedly told Zen to take action cautiously.
<br><br>
The three days requested by Flamine seemed to pass in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Flamine personally sent Elvinia to the top of the Oneness Mountain. She concealed her anxiety from her daughter and told her to be careful in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia were fully prepared to return. They sat cross-legged on the floor, and closed their eyes.
<br><br>
A flame rose from Zen's body. The two of them returned together to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The moment they opened their eyes, they were bathed in the glow of a bright light shining above them.
<br><br>
The two of them were in the center of a circle of light, about ten feet in diameter. Beyond the light was impenetrable darkness. Nothing could be seen at all.
<br><br>
"Elvinia, the Darkness Fruits," Zen said quickly.
<br><br>
They were unable to see the environment of the Dark Region because the effect of the Darkness Fruits had already dissipated.
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded and took out two white fruits from her space ring. She handed one of the fruits to Zen.
<br><br>
They each bit into their fruits. As Zen swallowed the Darkness Fruit, he felt energy spreading throughout his body, and the darkness that obscured his vision seemed to lighten. He looked around him at their surroundings and instantly felt stunned.
<br><br>
To his shock, he and Elvinia were surrounded by several pig-faced monsters standing just outside the edge of the circle of light. Their ferocious fangs were bared. They were staring at Zen and Elvinia, and looked ready to fight.
<br><br>
Elvinia let out a small cry of astonishment as she saw the monsters around them.
<br><br>
She stepped closer to Zen, feeling uneasy and afraid.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. They can't come into the light," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters leaned forward and roared, taking care to stay in the darkness.
<br><br>
"Get out of here, you filthy humans!"
<br><br>
"You are trampling the holy tomb!"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters roared and threatened them, but they couldn't step into the circle of light to attack the humans.
<br><br>
Zen smiled, shaking his head. "You know, if I were them, I would be kind and gentle instead of loud and threatening. I would try to lure us out of the light and into the darkness, where we could be slaughtered like fish on the chopping block."
<br><br>
Elvinia scowled. "Luckily, they don't have someone who thinks like you. Be quiet. Don't give them any ideas."
<br><br>
Zen shrugged. "My point is that these pig-faced monsters do not seem to be very intelligent. The black monkeys are smarter. So I don't understand why one of their own would become a purified being."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he bent and carefully studied the holy tomb of the pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
According to Flamine, there was a purified being buried within.
<br><br>
Zen placed a hand carefully on the tomb. He glanced around him at the pigfaced monsters and asked them, "Is one of your clansmen buried inside this tomb?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3308 White Shadow The pig-faced monsters shuddered at the mere thought of the thing they dreaded the most: Zen would aim at the holy tomb.
<br><br>
His question rang repeatedly in their heads, which made them tremble profusely in fear.
<br><br>
Despite that, they still had the gall to curse fiercely at Zen.
<br><br>
"Move your dirty hand away!"
<br><br>
"How dare you, a dirty human, touch Master Teague's holy tomb!"
<br><br>
"Go to hell!" they all shouted.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, their noises caused the other pig-faced monsters to come out of the caves as well.
<br><br>
Elvinia looked at Zen solemnly. "Those pig-faced monsters are besieging us again," she reminded him.
<br><br>
"Leave them alone," Zen replied expressionlessly.
<br><br>
They could leave the Other Shore at any time anyway. Moreover, the creatures from the Dark Region couldn't get inside, which meant that he could try anything he liked.
<br><br>
He turned a deaf ear to the pig-faced monsters' cries and carelessly walked around the holy tomb. Finally, he stopped in front of it and bowed down.
<br><br>
This action surprised Elvinia as she didn't know what Zen meant. Still, the act had now excited those pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
"He's finally enlightened. He's going to submit to our Master Teague!"
<br><br>
"Even if you kneel down and beg for forgiveness, we can only let you die-- but it is not so painful!"
<br><br>
"Since you have thought through this, you can step out now!"
<br><br>
After Zen was done bowing, he stood up and smiled at the pig-faced monsters. He then suddenly jumped up to the tomb and dug it out with his hands! He knew that the only way to leave the place was to look for the answer that lay inside the tomb.
<br><br>
He bowed to the tomb because of his moral. Whether the purified being was dead or not, it was indeed disrespectful to dig a tomb.
<br><br>
Those ferocious pig-faced monsters were dumbfounded.
<br><br>
They never thought that Zen would actually be so bold to dig the tomb! "Stop!"
<br><br>
"Please!"
<br><br>
"No… we are so sorry, Master Teague…"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters could only cry out in despair when they realized that threatening Zen didn't work. In fact, it just irritated him. Thus, some of them began to plead with him to stop.
<br><br>
However, Zen knew that the pig-faced monsters were never to be trusted, so he completely ignored them.
<br><br>
"Swish..."
<br><br>
He tossed away the masses of mud he had dug out until the long, thin stones below came into view. The stones were highly cold to the touch.
<br><br>
He tried to break the stones, but failed. He couldn't believe that they were so hard that he couldn't damage them even for a little bit.
<br><br>
Finally, he started with the side of the tomb. He took out the stones and threw them towards Elvinia, who stood not far away.
<br><br>
The stones should contain a very potent amount of the Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
Since they didn't melt in the light, they could be fused as the Other Shore Tokens! After Elvinia picked up the stones and put them in her space ring, she went by the tomb's side and carefully peered down.
<br><br>
Once all the stones were removed, a circular cave with a diameter of three feet appeared beneath.
<br><br>
"The tomb is empty?" Elvinia's eyes narrowed. If there was an underground passage below, they would get out of the place.
<br><br>
"Let me get down to have a look," said Zen.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to jump inside, that dark blue pig-faced monster showed up again beside the light column.
<br><br>
Its angry mouth seemed to shout the words, "You will regret for what you have done!"
<br><br>
The rest of the pig-faced monsters also roared and the whole valley was blanketed in a thick fog of unease. Even the tentacles in the valley quietly retreated back to the triangular caves.
<br><br>
However, Zen just cast a glance at the dark blue pig-faced monster before he jumped into the cave beneath the tomb.
<br><br>
Elvinia was left alone at the tomb's entrance, her eyes filled with nervousness.
<br><br>
Although she clearly knew that the pig-faced monsters couldn't get in, their howls that seemed to shake mountains still terrified her a little.
<br><br>
"Let's cover the light!"
<br><br>
"Block the light and get them out!"
<br><br>
"Let the tentacles do this!"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters and the tentacles had previously dashed into the light column blindly without a thought.
<br><br>
As a result, the light had melted their bodies in various degrees.
<br><br>
At the moment, one of the pig-faced monsters seemed to have come up with an idea. The light was indeed powerful, but it could not destroy stones in an instant.
<br><br>
Then all the tentacles that had retreated to the triangular caves extended to the outside of the valley and pulled the huge stones on the outside back to the inside.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
At that moment, Elvinia saw a huge dark shadow in the distance. It was a huge stone that the tentacles had thrown over her head! The giant stone naturally blocked the column of light that shone from above, casting a shadow on Elvinia.
<br><br>
Her legs were frozen in place. She was speechless and didn't know what to do.
<br><br>
"Catch her!"
<br><br>
"Kill her!"
<br><br>
"We can get in now!"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters that had stayed outside for a long time had run out of patience. As soon as the stone blocked the light, they hurriedly scampered towards Elvinia! "Elvinia?"
<br><br>
Zen, who had just jumped down from the tomb's entrance, felt the light above his head fade away. His face slightly turned worried.
<br><br>
Even though he didn't know what had happened above, he knew that the light was their only protective screen! Thus, he jumped upwards without hesitation and tried to find out what happened.
<br><br>
The only thing was, it was easy to go down but hard to go up. When he tried to rush towards the entrance, a weird force abruptly pulled him in and he fell down from a height of about forty feet! "Whoosh…"
<br><br>
As he slipped further down, four pig-faced monsters had already reached Elvinia in a blink of an eye. One of them reached out and grabbed her in an attempt to drag her out.
<br><br>
In turn, Elvinia instinctively launched a counterattack.
<br><br>
The golden light around her body flickered continuously until it turned into golden whips, which lashed at the pig-faced monsters like a violent storm.
<br><br>
Yet, the divine flames of the Sun Crow race still wasn't enough to render considerable damage to them.
<br><br>
"Right after we got back here... We are in danger…"
<br><br>
Despair racked Elvinia's body, and she was close to giving up… Suddenly, a beam of light glittered brightly once again.
<br><br>
Even if the giant stone did temporarily block the light, the light also tarnished it because it was an object of the Dark Region. In just a few seconds, the light had pierced through the giant stone.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The bright light shone on Elvinia again.
<br><br>
Before the pig-faced monsters around her could scream, the light beam had melted their bodies away, filling the air with a pungent smell.
<br><br>
The light won a little bit of time for Elvinia to breath. Her face however, changed dramatically when she saw the tentacles lift a number of giant stones.
<br><br>
She would never have a chance to escape once the stones completely covered the light! Without hesitation, she quickly jumped into the cave beneath the tomb.
<br><br>
The situation outside the cave was extremely critical, and the same could be said for inside of it.
<br><br>
A small white shadow floated in front of Zen. It didn't contain very strong energy, but it seemed that it posed a great threat to him.
<br><br>
It turned out that this white shadow was the force that pulled him down just now! At that point, his face twisted in horror when he realized that the white shadow had targeted Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Watch out!" he screamed when seeing Elvinia jumping down.
<br><br>
Chapter 3309 Cutting There was no time for Elvinia to check the cave before jumping inside.
<br><br>
But when she heard Zen warn her from above, she resisted on instinct, releasing golden whips from her Soul of Light and lashing at the white shadow that appeared before her.
<br><br>
Swish! When she used her divine flames of the Sun Crow race on the Other Shore, they were like a soul theurgy. The power of the flames imposed on physical bodies was rather ordinary, but if the opponent was in soul form, their power was not to be scoffed at.
<br><br>
And the white shadow was in just soul form.
<br><br>
As the divine flames almost hit the figure, Elvinia felt a sudden strange force.
<br><br>
The force sent her flying horizontally without warning—the golden whips deviated from the attack as she lost control.
<br><br>
Bang! She hit the wall hard.
<br><br>
Her Soul of Light was, of course, incomparable to Zen's. After the collision, she passed out immediately.
<br><br>
The force exerted on her wasn't dissipating—it kept her nailed firmly to the wall.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The white shadow didn't seem to have any intention of killing her, though.
<br><br>
After knocking her unconscious, it flew in closer.
<br><br>
"No way!"
<br><br>
Zen had no idea what it was planning, but from its actions, he could vaguely guess what it was up to, so he didn't want it anywhere near Elvinia.
<br><br>
The power of the Strength God Totem emanated from his body as he got ready to leap into the air.
<br><br>
Over the past three days, he had replenished his power with a considerable amount of divine crystals. His two Other Shore Tokens were in their best state.
<br><br>
But just as he was about to jump, he felt his feet sink into the ground.
<br><br>
'What?' Zen felt his heart skip a beat as he carefully examined the situation—his eyes went wide.
<br><br>
The moment he entered the cave, the ground felt soft—he figured it was just the soil.
<br><br>
But now that his feet were stuck, he realized that he was stepping on huge lumps of meat.
<br><br>
In fact, the entire floor was covered by lumps of meat, with meridians separating the flesh and purple blood flowing rapidly through them.
<br><br>
Although he had seen such passageway in the Grand Sky Temple, he knew he was in a far stranger place.
<br><br>
His surprise lasted only a second.
<br><br>
Seeing as the white figure was already right in front of Elvinia, he had no time to lose.
<br><br>
"Six hundred divine megatons of force…"
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power of the Strength God Totem erupted and Zen managed to pull his feet out from in between the flesh on the ground.
<br><br>
He rushed to the side like a sling-shot stone and grabbed at the white shadow with his hands like a bolt of lightning.
<br><br>
The figure saw Elvinia as a lifesaver—it wanted to seize the opportunity to enter her Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Just then… Zen felt the light above him start dimming again.
<br><br>
Dozens of great stones blocked the cave's entrance, enveloping them in darkness.
<br><br>
Even light with strong penetrating power would take some time to get through the stones.
<br><br>
The tentacles slithered along the cave walls and flocked into the dark cave.
<br><br>
When one of Zen's hands was about to grab the white shadow, the tentacles shot out and wrapped around Zen's body. It was a horrible sight—dozens of thick tentacles entangling him and each other.
<br><br>
As the tentacles restrained him completely, all he could do was watch as the shadow rushed into Elvinia's Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Once the tentacles dragged Zen out of the cave, another group made its way into it, aiming at Elvinia.
<br><br>
No foreign beings were allowed to exist in the holy tomb.
<br><br>
But before they could reach her, they began trembling all of a sudden as though they had received some sort of irresistible signal. After another moment, they left Elvinia behind and retreated.
<br><br>
The other tentacles were still holding great stones up, blocking the light from outside.
<br><br>
It was the first time the pig-faced monsters had even gotten close to the holy tomb. All were wearing faces of reverence at that moment.
<br><br>
Hurriedly, they bowed before the tomb and restored it before heading out.
<br><br>
Once again, the giant stones were penetrated by the light—it reached down, shining onto the tomb.
<br><br>
From the looks of it, save for the new soil on the tomb's surface, there were barely any traces of damage. After light broke through the stones, fragments fell and their debris turned to dust under the light before disappearing entirely.
<br><br>
The tentacles kept pulling on Zen until they held him midair—they seemed to be competing for him among themselves. Each of them wanted to pull him into their own caves and devour him slowly.
<br><br>
Each tentacle released a great force during the fight—Zen could feel his body being slowly, agonizingly torn apart.
<br><br>
Still, his body was highly strong—if it were any other body, they'd already be in pieces.
<br><br>
In the end, one of the tentacles won, and Zen was dragged into a triangular cave.
<br><br>
Over a hundred feet deep inside, he could smell the old, rotting blood on the walls. Clumps of fur and bones were scattered on the ground.
<br><br>
'These must be the corpses of the black monkeys from earlier…' Zen thought.
<br><br>
Zen could tell what they were from the dark fur—the three black monkeys that had been caught a while earlier. They were already eaten.
<br><br>
But how did the tentacles cut through the monkeys' bones? No matter how strong they were, tentacles were soft in nature. At most, they could only tear the bodies into pieces like one would tear paper. But Zen could see that the pieces of bone were cleanly cut and extremely smooth. Apparently, they were cut by some sharp weapons.
<br><br>
While he pondered, two more tentacles extended from within the cave.
<br><br>
They were slightly thinner than the others, but each had a row of sharp teeth on one side—Zen's questions about the bones were answered.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
The soft tentacles held Zen's body in place as the other two rushed toward him.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
As the two tentacles moved backward and forward around Zen's shoulders, their rows of teeth were like saws as they cut into Zen's body.
<br><br>
As the cutting began, a burning pain shot through Zen's arms and his shoulders were covered in blood. The tentacles' strength was beyond anything Zen could have ever imagined.
<br><br>
If the sawing went on, he'd be left in pieces soon. His brows furrowed tightly as he thought of his predicament.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
The tentacles continued the torturous motion.
<br><br>
In the second round of cutting, they had reached his flesh and muscles—the white of his bones was already visible.
<br><br>
Chapter 3310 Soul Stealing And Counterattack The desperate situation had Zen thinking long and hard about how to escape.
<br><br>
There weren't many abilities he could use on the Other Shore. Because of its nature, the Strength God Totem could only increase Zen's strength — it wasn't nearly enough to force himself out of the tentacles' range.
<br><br>
The Eye of Will's power was indeed excellent, but for it to be truly effective, it had to be combined with great swordsmanship skills. In this situation, it was practically useless.
<br><br>
Currently, two tentacles began the third round of cutting.
<br><br>
This time, Zen gritted his teeth and leaped on full strength. In the little window of opportunity, he managed to evade the tentacles and start running out of the cave.
<br><br>
But the enclosure was already densely crowded with tentacles. Before he could take any more steps forward, another one hit his legs.
<br><br>
Slap! The whip-like hit made Zen lose his balance. Before he fell to the ground, several tentacles wrapped around him, dragging him deeper into the cave.
<br><br>
Their severe grip left him with no chance of escape.
<br><br>
When someone entered the Other Shore, it was normally difficult for others to tell if their Souls of Light were trapped or injured. The only way to understand one's condition was to examine one's mind.
<br><br>
But because Zen entered the Other Shore with his physical body, his case was another story.
<br><br>
Any injuries he suffered on the Other Shore affected his real body in the Source World.
<br><br>
"Zen is injured! Is he in a fight?"
<br><br>
"What's happening on the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"I hope he's okay…"
<br><br>
Zen's body in the Source World sat on the second floor of his courtyard house. His eyes were shut tightly as he cringed like he was in pain. Wounds began appearing on his body abruptly — blood even started gushing out.
<br><br>
His condition put Letitia and Margaret in a panic. Dorothy rushed to his side and tried to help treat the fresh wounds.
<br><br>
After sending Elvinia's body to the Flow Sword Sect, Flamine stayed with them.
<br><br>
While she couldn't see what was going on at Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, she knew that Elvinia was in a critical situation — she couldn't just leave protecting Elvinia up to Zen alone.
<br><br>
At the sight of Zen's terrible wounds, Flamine felt a sense of foreboding.
<br><br>
What about Elvinia? Was she with him? Was she still safe? In the next moment, Flamine was at Elvinia's side, putting her slender fingers atop the latter's forehead. Closing her eyes in concentration, she examined her daughter's soul — a solemn expression came over her face.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, is she alright?" Dorothy asked in concern.
<br><br>
"Her soul is very weak. It seems like someone is trying to steal her soul!"
<br><br>
Now, Flamine sounded angry, gritting her teeth.
<br><br>
"What?!" Dorothy's eyes widened in alarm. "Is there anything we can do to help her?"
<br><br>
Margaret and Letitia exchanged looks of astonishment.
<br><br>
While they had very little knowledge of the Other Shore, they were well aware of the practice of stealing another warrior's soul. But never did they think such a thing could be done on the Other Shore as well.
<br><br>
"Maybe this creature can even enter the Source World through Elvinia's body. It might be successful if I hadn't noticed it right away. Now that I've discovered it, I'm not letting it through," Flamine boldly announced as she sneered. She then pressed a hand on her daughter's head and pointed the other to her temple.
<br><br>
A touch of demonic-red colored her eyes.
<br><br>
Such was a secret soul skill unique to her — it was highly damaging to her own soul whenever she performed it. But what choice did she have when her daughter was in grave danger? Zoom! An invisible soul power emanated from her body.
<br><br>
Violent gusts of wind began blowing from the second floor of the house.
<br><br>
Her soul power's fluctuation was not necessarily destructive, but all the disciples in the Flow Sword Sect could sense it clearly. Their faces filled with awe as they stared at Zen's courtyard house from a distance.
<br><br>
Everyone was well aware that only a dozen people in the entire Oneness Sky Palace were capable of releasing such a terrifying soul aura. They wondered which one of the grandmasters had visited the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore, the white shadow went straight into Elvinia's Memory Flame after entering her Soul of Light.
<br><br>
As the leader of the pig-faced monsters, Teague had great ambition.
<br><br>
After he succeeded in becoming a purified being, the entire Stage Thirteen would become his domain — both the black monkeys and the giant ape would be at his mercy.
<br><br>
Initially, the plan had gone smoothly. Once the flesh and soul were nourished adequately, he was to be reincarnated.
<br><br>
Never did he think that the fate would send him such a great gift.
<br><br>
It was a Soul of Light from the Source World.
<br><br>
In comparison, the Other Shore was narrow and limited.
<br><br>
Creatures like him lurked in the shadows of this narrow world for generations. Dominating the Stage Thirteen didn't do anything to change his fate.
<br><br>
But if he managed to steal Elvinia's soul, he'd at least have a chance to return to the Source World. Such was something all the Other Shore creatures longed for.
<br><br>
With his current abilities, it wouldn't be long before he took control of the chaos in its entirety. At such an exciting thought, Teague did not hesitate for a moment before locking down on his target.
<br><br>
Elvinia's Memory Flame flickered with a pale-orange light. After she lost her consciousness, the light grew especially dim.
<br><br>
When Teague finally found her Memory Flame, his ugly mug twisted into a malicious smile.
<br><br>
Powerful creatures at his level normally had two ways of occupying a soul.
<br><br>
First, he could destroy her Memory Flame and replace it with his own — with this method, however, he'd lose the original owner's memories.
<br><br>
Second, he could devour her Memory Flame and integrate her memories into his — this way, he'd obtain all her knowledge and secrets as well.
<br><br>
Both the Source World and the chaos remained unfamiliar to Teague. He needed to learn about them — what better way than to understand the world through her memories? Elvinia's Memory Flame sensed approaching danger and swayed gently within the depths of her soul like a helpless little girl in the face of a hungry wolf.
<br><br>
Once her Memory Flame was devoured, her true consciousness would vanish into thin air — something akin to death.
<br><br>
"I've already found you. Where do you think you can escape?" Teague's soul smiled maliciously as he mocked her. He could almost smell the flame's fragrance.
<br><br>
The white shadow flashed gently as it grabbed the vulnerable Memory Flame in its hand — it trembled violently and swayed in Teague's palm.
<br><br>
Indeed, there was no way to escape.
<br><br>
But just as he raised the flame to his mouth, ready to swallow it, something unexpected began unfolding.
<br><br>
A sudden flash of scarlet-golden flame appeared, proceeded by beams of golden light that started spreading within her soul.
<br><br>
"Wha-what's going on?!" Teague's eyes were wide as they darted around, wondering what the scene before him was.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he began groaning in pain.
<br><br>
A burning sensation came over his palm. Before he could react, Elvinia's Memory Flame began scorching him, forcing him to throw it away.
<br><br>
Realizing that something was going terribly wrong, he chose to flee.
<br><br>
Teague was a purified being — he was at the beginning of a new life where a bright future awaited him. He couldn't afford to perish just yet.
<br><br>
But the golden flames were spreading rapidly, far beyond his imagination.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the flames had formed a cage around him, making him a prisoner within the depths of Elvinia's soul.
<br><br>
Chapter 3311 An Accident It was extremely difficult for the people in the Source World to influence or affect the events on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
They could only offer soul pills to strengthen the soul auras of those on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The people outside Dragon City, for instance, were able to cultivate on the Other Shore with the help of the starlight in Dragon City despite it being an external force.
<br><br>
Flamine couldn't intervene and help Elvinia fight the creatures on the Other Shore. Nor could she greatly improve her daughter's cultivation base while Elvinia was on the Other Shore. However, she could kill anyone who tried to snatch Elvinia's soul.
<br><br>
In a sense, one's Soul of Light was both in the Source World and on the Other Shore. Thus, after Teague entered the depths of Elvinia's Soul of Light, he was still on the Other Shore, yet he was also on the second floor of Zen's house in the Flow Sword Sect in the Source World.
<br><br>
This presented Flamine with an opportunity to help her daughter.
<br><br>
Teague had not become a purified being yet, so his soul was still quite weak. Moreover, as a creature from Stage Thirteen of the Dark Region, he was inferior to the creatures in the upper stages of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Huge flames burned and flickered around Teague.
<br><br>
He darted from left to right in a cage made of golden flames. Every time he tried to escape, the scorching heat forced him back inside.
<br><br>
"I'm a purified being! You can't kill me!" Teague yelled in despair.
<br><br>
Outside the cage, a faint shadow emerged. It was Flamine's soul. Elvinia's Memory Flame rested on her shoulder.
<br><br>
"You certainly have the aura of a purified being," said Flamine, looking at Teague cautiously.
<br><br>
There were many powerful creatures in the Dark Region, and the purified beings were the best of them. Once they were born, they were virtually impossible to defeat.
<br><br>
However, it remained a great mystery how and why purified beings were born.
<br><br>
"You can't kill me! If you kill me, the Blood Assembly will never let you go!" Teague roared at Flamine.
<br><br>
"But you want to kill my daughter!" said Flamine, whose face darkened.
<br><br>
Threatened by Teague, she was more determined to kill him now.
<br><br>
She waved her hand, and the golden cage shrank, closing in on Teague. The bars of golden flames pressed in on Teague's soul. He screamed in agony at the scorching pain.
<br><br>
Several seconds passed as Teague writhed and screamed. Eventually, he collapsed and fell silent. Flamine exhaled, thinking it was over at last.
<br><br>
However, something strange happened.
<br><br>
Teague's white soul began to swell rapidly. It expanded within the flaming cage, becoming larger and larger.
<br><br>
"What's going on?" Flamine demanded, taking a step back.
<br><br>
She tried to bind the expanding soul in place, but she couldn't hold it down.
<br><br>
There was a deafening bang.
<br><br>
Teague's soul exploded. In an instant, a violent, swirling vortex appeared in its place.
<br><br>
Flamine stumbled forwards, drawn by the gravity of the vortex. She fought against it, but it was too strong. Her soul and Elvinia's orange Memory Flame were inexorably sucked in.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Flamine's soul had disappeared into the vortex.
<br><br>
In the Source World, Flamine suddenly opened her eyes. She blinked and shook her head, looking furious. In a cold voice, she cried out, "How could this happen?"
<br><br>
Dorothy had been trying to repair Zen's body. When she turned to Flamine and saw the look on her face, her own expression grew dark and forbidding.
<br><br>
Although Flamine had not explained what had happened, Dorothy could tell that things had gone wrong.
<br><br>
Flamine put her fingers to her temples, and golden flames appeared, shooting upwards. Her eyes were red.
<br><br>
She wanted to go into Elvinia's mind again. But she found that a white light had enveloped Elvinia's soul.
<br><br>
The light seemed to have completely integrated with Elvinia's soul. It wouldn't be difficult to destroy the light, but the problem was that, given this degree of integration, destroying the light would also tear apart Elvinia's soul.
<br><br>
The two tentacles lashed at Zen's arms again.
<br><br>
Zen felt the intense pain of the cutting from the tentacles, but to his surprise, he also felt a sensation he couldn't immediately identify.
<br><br>
He took a closer look at his arms and realized that they were healing.
<br><br>
However, the healing could not keep up with the amount of damage being done to his arms. They were cut, broken, and bleeding.
<br><br>
Zen thought that the tentacles would break his bones and rip his arms apart, and then enjoy the pieces slowly.
<br><br>
He groaned at the terrible sound of the bones in his arms cracking beneath the tentacles.
<br><br>
Zen was overcome by agony. He was about to black out from the pain when, from outside the triangle cave, there was a loud roar.
<br><br>
It sounded like hundreds of pigs howling together.
<br><br>
'The pig-faced monsters...' Zen thought, ashen-faced.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, the tentacles stopped moving. To Zen's surprise, he found himself being carried out of the cave by the tentacles.
<br><br>
He realized that the pig-faced monsters had somehow stopped the tentacles from devouring him.
<br><br>
Zen knew that the pig-faced monsters had not acted out of benevolence.
<br><br>
After all, he had broken into their holy tomb, and they had tried to tear him limb from limb. They must be even more furious at him now that he had dug up and desecrated the tomb.
<br><br>
The air whooshed in Zen's ears as the tentacles swung him upwards.
<br><br>
He was hung upside down outside the triangle cave.
<br><br>
Everything was silent except for a dripping sound, as blood flowed down to the ground from the wounds on his arms.
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters stood in a line in front of Zen's battered, upsidedown body. He looked miserable, yet he endured his suffering, which stoked their hatred even further. They started to speak among themselves.
<br><br>
"We can't let him die so easily!"
<br><br>
"Anyone who desecrates the holy tomb must suffer the harshest torture!"
<br><br>
"This filthy human must pay for what he's done!"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters talked over each other, suggesting methods for punishing and torturing Zen.
<br><br>
While they were discussing the matter, the dark blue pig-faced monster reappeared. It went to Zen and narrowed its eyes at him thoughtfully. After a moment it turned to the others and said, "Don't kill him."
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters let out howls of indignation. "What? Why not?"
<br><br>
"This human has insulted us!"
<br><br>
"He deserves to die a painful death!"
<br><br>
Zen felt a stab of relief at the declaration of the dark blue pig-faced monster, but he was also confused.
<br><br>
The monster had wanted to swallow him alive before. Now it wanted to spare his life? What reason could there be to keep him alive? The dark blue pig-faced monster glanced at Zen and gave him a slow, malevolent smile. "We will use him as bait in the black pool!" And it laughed, its beady eyes lit with malice.
<br><br>
For a moment, the other pig-faced monsters were quiet, thinking about the proposal. Then they joined the dark blue pig-faced monster in its laughter.
<br><br>
"Good idea!"
<br><br>
"That is a fitting consequence for the one who breaks into the holy tomb!"
<br><br>
"He will suffer greatly!"
<br><br>
The black pool was a forbidden area for the pig-faced monsters. Any creature sent as bait to the black pool would meet a dreadful end.
<br><br>
Zen was apprehensive. He had no idea what the black pool was, but he could tell from the reactions of the pig-faced monsters that it would not be a good idea to enter that place.
<br><br>
The tentacles seemed to do the bidding of the pig-faced monsters. They took out two thick bronze iron plates, obtained from the valley, which were about the size of a human being. There was a hole punched into the center of each iron plate. The tentacles lifted Zen down onto the ground. They slid Zen's neck and hands into the holes in the iron plates, and then secured the plates with two ropes.
<br><br>
Zen struggled but he was very weak from his injuries. When he released his Other Shore Power, strange patterns flashed on the plates, but they stayed firmly in place.
<br><br>
"Give it up. No one can escape from the bronze seal," a pig-faced monster sneered.
<br><br>
Zen ignored the monster, silently trying to break free. After several unsuccessful attempts, he finally gave up, deciding he was wasting his energy. He sat, trapped by the bronze seal, and stared morosely at the light column in the middle of the valley.
<br><br>
Elvinia was still buried within the dark cave of the tomb. Her Soul of Light would have been entirely swallowed by the white shadow by now.
<br><br>
Chapter 3312 Black Pool A white cocoon of light floated in the darkness of the tomb.
<br><br>
This cocoon wrapped around Elvinia.
<br><br>
Every a few seconds, the cocoon could be seen beating with the naked eye.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! The movement of the cocoon caused tremors to pass through the dark cave.
<br><br>
The blood vessels and the flesh on the wall and the ground bulged as if they were sentient living beings, and gathered around the cocoon.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! The cocoon had beaten over a hundred times before some of the blood vessels attached themselves to it, the flesh following close behind. The entire process was long and slow, but they continued to gradually gather together into a shape.
<br><br>
Zen didn't know that such a strange change was taking place in the dark cave.
<br><br>
He waited for a few hours before he began to feel that the light was dimming. The pig-faced monsters that had been near him had gradually fallen into the darkness. The effect of the Darkness Fruit was about to disappear.
<br><br>
"Are you going to use me as bait?" Zen asked the pig-faced monster that was guarding him.
<br><br>
"Right," the pig-faced monster snickered.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid I'm going to disappear from the Dark Region before that because the Darkness Fruit is about to lose effect," Zen said.
<br><br>
The pig-faced monster looked surprised.
<br><br>
They had forgotten that Zen was not from the Dark Region. When the effect of the Darkness Fruit wore off, the Dark Region would erase his body.
<br><br>
The pig-faced monster reported this to its superiors. Soon, several pig-faced monsters had left the valley.
<br><br>
Zen felt it getting darker and darker, the voices of the pig-faced monsters becoming fainter by the minute. He felt pain as the Dark Region continued to corrode him.
<br><br>
Fortunately, there were a number of Darkness Fruits in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
About an hour later, the pig-faced monsters returned and shoved a Darkness Fruit into Zen's mouth.
<br><br>
As the power of the Darkness Fruit spread out across Zen's body, the darkness faded away and things returned to normal.
<br><br>
"I wouldn't eat the Darkness Fruit if I were you," Zen's guard said meaningfully.
<br><br>
"Why?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"It's better to be corroded by the darkness than to be bait," the guard said with a grin.
<br><br>
Zen wanted to shrug but the bronze iron plates were pressing down on his shoulders, restricting his movements.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't given up despite the numerous changes that had come about. He wasn't about to take the guard's words to heart and he had no other choice but to stay strong.
<br><br>
Eight hours later, the guard gave Zen another Darkness Fruit.
<br><br>
It was then that the tentacles in the triangle caves began to emerge in succession.
<br><br>
Zen could now see the tentacles completely and what they were. A wrinkled round head sat at the top of the tentacles. The creature looked like an octopus, but it had many more tentacles.
<br><br>
'The pig-faced monsters aren't strong or as big as the black monkeys. The octopuses are obviously more powerful. So why do these two creatures live together? Why do the octopuses obey the pig-faced monsters?' Zen thought.
<br><br>
It was common for creatures to live together, but usually, only those creatures that complemented each other did so.
<br><br>
What made the pig-faced monsters special? They weren't of great wisdom and strength. How was it that they were now commanding the octopuses? What happened next helped Zen understand this.
<br><br>
One of the octopuses stretched out its tentacles and grabbed the ropes attached to the bronze iron plates. It then pulled Zen along with the iron plates and began to climb up the valley.
<br><br>
Halfway through, it stretched out its tentacles yet again and got entangled with the octopus below it.
<br><br>
Each tentacle was over a thousand feet long. The octopuses connected with each other using their tentacles. Only one of them remained in its cave.
<br><br>
The octopuses couldn't really leave the caves. If they really wanted to, it was a long-drawn-out process that was troublesome. Moreover, the range of their activities was limited.
<br><br>
'No wonder there are so few living creatures in this area. They must have been wiped out by the octopuses. But the octopuses can only move around a certain distance. So it must have been the pig-faced monsters that do the rest.' Zen was still deep in thought when the long rope made of tentacles scaled the peak of the mountain, and a strange smell reached Zen's nose.
<br><br>
Zen looked down to see the black pool that the pig-faced monsters had mentioned.
<br><br>
There was no water in the pool. Instead, it was filled with sticky black mud that was so dense. No wave could ever be created on its surface no matter how hard the wind was blowing.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The octopuses, which were part of the rope, lowered Zen onto the surface of the black pool.
<br><br>
Moments before Zen was about to hit the surface, the octopuses tossed him into the pool.
<br><br>
The black mud was so viscous that people could even stand on it with no fear of sinking.
<br><br>
But because of the heavy bronze iron plates on his back, Zen began to sink slowly into the mud.
<br><br>
In no time, Zen's whole body had sunk into the depths of the pool.
<br><br>
He could see nothing in the black quagmire, and could do nothing but let himself sink.
<br><br>
Minutes later, Zen felt something tug at his back. The rope had tightened and was stopping Zen from sinking even further. He was alone in the black pool, hanging onto the rope and his luck.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Bubbles began to float. Zen frowned, sensing that something was coming his way.
<br><br>
As more bubbles began to appear, he felt a stabbing pain in his feet, as if something was stuck to them. He struggled to escape it but his body was being held down by the bronze iron plates. Thanks to the absence of enough space, he couldn't get rid of it.
<br><br>
The more he struggled, the more things he attracted to himself. It was not long before these things spread out all over his body.
<br><br>
"What the hell?"
<br><br>
Zen couldn't see anything. All he could do was grit his teeth and endure the pain. He finally understood what the pig-faced monster had meant.
<br><br>
The monster had been right when it had said that being put in the black pool and sucked at by these unknown objects was worse than dying.
<br><br>
Dorothy and the others were witnessing something horrifying happen to Zen. Countless tiny holes appeared on Zen's body, ringed with black traces of erosion.
<br><br>
Chapter 3313 New Body After Rebirth "These are from severe poison," Dorothy said after looking at the corrosion marks.
<br><br>
The wounds one sustained from the Other Shore carried over to the Source World. Thus, Zen sported the dark, corrosion marks on his skin. However, any objects from the Other Shore could not appear in the Source World, so there was no venom around his wounds.
<br><br>
Letitia was immediately relieved upon hearing Dorothy's diagnosis. "Zen is immune to poison."
<br><br>
"It appears so," Dorothy replied upon observation.
<br><br>
The things in the black pool were extremely poisonous. Most of the creatures from the Dark Region could barely come out alive if getting bit after being thrown into that pond.
<br><br>
Death came slowly with this type of poison. After being injected into the bloodstream, it would make the victim hallucinate while his body deteriorated. Pus would slowly fester on his skin, his organs, down to his very bones until he became nothing more than a flesh bag of bodily fluids.
<br><br>
This type of death was horrible and incredibly painful.
<br><br>
That was from only one bite. Zen was currently being attacked by more than a hundred of these unknown things! Fortunately, his body was immune to any type of poison and all he really had to worry about was the blood loss.
<br><br>
However, just the mere thought of his body being covered by many bugs sent a shiver down his spine.
<br><br>
An hour later, he felt the two ropes on the bronze-iron plates tighten, slowly raising him up from the black pool.
<br><br>
'Finally. I'm leaving this hell now?' Zen's heart filled with joy.
<br><br>
He really thought it was going to be his death after the pig-faced monsters made such a huge deal of the black pond. It turned out not as bad as they said.
<br><br>
As soon as he left the pond, he looked down at his body.
<br><br>
He had already mentally prepared himself but the sight shocked him all the same.
<br><br>
The bugs were not a pretty sight - dark cyan, with huge abdomens like cyan gems. A fine needle protruded from each bug's head and penetrated every square inch of his body.
<br><br>
Despite being lifted from the pond, the bugs remained latched onto him, firmly attached to his flesh by their needles.
<br><br>
Zen was dragged to the top of the mountain by the octopuses and all the way to the valley, being left in front of the pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
"A bumper harvest!"
<br><br>
"His blood must be delicious!"
<br><br>
"What a big harvest! And without the sacrifice of one of our kind, ha ha!"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters surrounded him and began to pull the bugs off his body.
<br><br>
These bugs were called Regal Jade Bugs and the octopuses fed on them occasionally. These bugs were quite difficult to fish up from the black pond.
<br><br>
At first, the pig-faced monsters used disguises to hide in the mountain creeks and trap a few creatures from the Dark Region. Unfortunately, their tricks had long since worn off. The creatures of the Dark Region also knew how difficult it was for the octopuses to leave the valley so they did not get close to them.
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters weren't strong enough and always failed to capture the creatures of the Dark Region, so they had no choice but sacrifice their own members. Sometimes, they would throw a pig-faced monster into the black pool to catch these Regal Jade Bugs.
<br><br>
These bugs were incredibly aggressive in the black pool. However, if taken out of the pond, they would become extremely stiff and unmoving.
<br><br>
In no time at all, the pig-faced monsters had harvested two hundred Regal Jade Bugs from his body.
<br><br>
After getting these bugs, a pig-faced monster couldn't help but snort in surprise. "This human has been bit by so many Regan Jade Bugs, but it seems nothing happens to his body. Why's that?"
<br><br>
Another pig-faced monster waved off its concern. "Don't worry about it and just throw him out. He now has Regal Jade Poison all over his body. Just a tiny bit can hurt all of us badly."
<br><br>
That pig-faced monster's words were like sweet honey to Zen's ears. Yet, he continued to keep his eyes closed and remained motionless on the ground.
<br><br>
If he was thrown away, he could definitely run to freedom.
<br><br>
Zen once again felt a tentacle roll over the bronze-iron plates, lifting him and poising to throw him out of the valley. However, before it could do so, the dark blue pig-faced monster spoke, "Wait!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Instead of the rush of freedom, Zen felt the crash of the cold, hard ground.
<br><br>
The dark blue pig-faced monster studied him closely, reaching out to touch his body. "This human is strange. It doesn't look as if he got poisoned."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Poison could turn a warrior into a literal skin bag of bodily fluids. However, Zen's body remained unchanged.
<br><br>
"Yes! You're right!" "This human boy is so strange!"
<br><br>
"Does that mean he's still alive?"
<br><br>
"Then doesn't that also mean we can use him repeatedly as bait?"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters were overjoyed upon this realization.
<br><br>
Sacrificing their own members was a terrible ordeal but with Zen here, they wouldn't need to do that anymore! Zen was internally cursing that dark blue pig-faced monster. All hope of escaping was sucked out of his body, replaced with the dread of having to be thrown into the black pond all over again.
<br><br>
He was now a valued treasure bait for these pig-faced monsters. They would never let him go nor let him die so easily.
<br><br>
Having stored a lot of Darkness Fruits, the pig-faced monsters fed one to Zen regularly and even healed some of his wounds.
<br><br>
Since playing dead wasn't doing him any favors, Zen gave up and opened his eyes to stare at his captors helplessly.
<br><br>
A day later...
<br><br>
The octopuses left the caves, and entangled with each other to form a rope thousands of feet long. They took Zen with them and threw him right back into the pond.
<br><br>
He was left soaking there for more than an hour to make sure that his entire body would be covered by the Regal Jade Bugs.
<br><br>
He was used as bait for four straight days.
<br><br>
While Zen was subject to such misery, something else was beginning to take place in the dark cave of the tomb.
<br><br>
Flesh and blood piled up, wrapping up a cocoon completely. Gradually, a body started to form.
<br><br>
When its facial features began shaping, a pig face appeared, looking exactly like a pig-faced monster. This was the purified being called Teague.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the pig face formed, it immediately crumbled and morphed into the face of a human girl.
<br><br>
She had a gentle and charming appearance, especially with her eyes closed in peaceful slumber.
<br><br>
On the fifth day, the human girl suddenly opened her eyes, confused.
<br><br>
'Where am I? Who am I?' Her heart was filled with doubt as she carefully observed her own body. It was the body of a pig-faced monster. It was big and fleshy as well as ugly.
<br><br>
This was an appearance that she could never accept.
<br><br>
"Phew! Phew!"
<br><br>
As she thought, there were cracks on her big body, and blood spilled. The flesh was constantly peeling off. A pair of slender hands pulled out from her bloated arms.
<br><br>
Chapter 3314 The Regal Jade Beast The human girl shook the blood away from her hands, the red streams painting the ground. Then, she checked them under the light, and a satisfied grin stretched on her lips.
<br><br>
Next, she jerked her fat legs, which caused the skin to crack. The flesh began to roll upwards to reveal a pair of slender legs.
<br><br>
Her shoulders, chest, and waist followed suit. Her thick limbs were stripped from her original body as a tangy, bloody scent filled the dark cave.
<br><br>
Soon after, a perfectly shaped body emerged from the pile of flesh.
<br><br>
Although she was still quite confused, she seemed to be in a better mood as her snow-white feet moved across the dark and bloody cave.
<br><br>
As she moved, the light column that came from the valley also moved with her.
<br><br>
The properties of the tombstone and the soil around it had changed with the birth of the purified being. They did not belong to the Dark Region anymore, so the light couldn't damage them.
<br><br>
The materials outside the light column, however, were different: as long as they touched the light, their energy and the light column's energy would attempt to eliminate each other.
<br><br>
As the light column started to move, numerous ditches appeared in the ground because of the erosion. The light column almost hit some of the pigfaced monsters that were in the middle of worshipping. The ground trembled as all of them scampered to the edge of the valley to hide, and then proceeded to watch the scene with caution.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Has the light column moved?"
<br><br>
"It's Master Teague! Has Master Teague turned into a purified being?"
<br><br>
All the pig-faced monsters that knew about the situation were aware that the light column did not illuminate the tomb, nor the tombstone, but Master Teague.
<br><br>
Once Master Teague became a purified being, the light column would follow him wherever he went! Since the light column shifted around, it was obvious that Master Teague was awake.
<br><br>
All of them saw how the brightness followed him as he walked in the dark cave.
<br><br>
"If Master Teague has succeeded, why won't he leave the dark cave?" The dark blue pig-faced monster scowled. "Maybe he needs to get everything ready," the pig-faced monster next to it replied and burst into giggles.
<br><br>
"It is said that a purified being can give us the ability to leave the darkness, right?" another pig-faced monster asked, its tone full of expectation. The dark blue pig-faced monster nodded and said, "According to what I heard, yes, but it's not permanent."
<br><br>
"It's still better than spending the whole life in the Dark Region," the other pig-faced monster exclaimed excitedly.
<br><br>
The light column kept moving, which caused the ditches in the ground to run deeper and deeper.
<br><br>
Finally, it returned to its original position and remained still.
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters thought that Master Teague was about to show up, so they all knelt on the ground and waited respectfully.
<br><br>
At the same time, the octopuses had again thrown Zen into the deep area of the black pool behind the valley.
<br><br>
He had been thrown there for so many times that it could be said that he was even used to it.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Bugs were highly poisonous to other living creatures, but not to Zen. He only felt like he was being poked hundreds of times. At the very least, he didn't die.
<br><br>
What he didn't know, however, was there were more than just the Regal Jade Bugs that lived in the black pool! "Something is wrong today... Where are those bugs?"
<br><br>
His face twisted with an unreadable expression as he floated quietly atop the pool's inky depths.
<br><br>
Five minutes had passed, and as things had been the past few days, those Regal Jade Bugs should have swarmed him by now. Yet, it was exceptionally quiet. There wasn't even a single Regal Jade Bug on his body.
<br><br>
'Did I get too many of them these days and they are now extinct?' he thought. Just as his imagination had run wild, he felt a wave in the thick black pool.
<br><br>
His heart began to pound loudly in his chest.
<br><br>
The black pool was so viscous that he could hardly move freely in it.
<br><br>
With such a strong wave, he was afraid that it might've come from a gigantic creature with unfathomable powers… 'Don't come at me!' he prayed fervently in his heart.
<br><br>
The wave in the black pool grew increasingly stronger until his heartbeat rang in his ears. Under the pool was indeed a gigantic creature, and it silently approached him.
<br><br>
He began to understand why the Regal Jade Bugs had stopped attacking him. They were probably avoiding the gigantic creature.
<br><br>
"Grmmm..."
<br><br>
The wave suddenly stopped coming, and a pulling force tugged at him from the front. Zen felt like he had been sucked into a gigantic beast's mouth, which he was. Once he was inside of it, the beast swam downwards and dragged the bronze iron plates along with it.
<br><br>
At that point, the octopuses by the black pool had simultaneously grasped at the rope on the bronze plates firmly with their tentacles. When they felt that the plates had sunk, they began to pull the rope upwards.
<br><br>
The octopuses were so powerful that even Zen stood no chance against their force.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the gigantic beast in the black pool was not weak either.
<br><br>
It desperately dragged Zen into the depths of the pool and soon enough, the two parties began to fight each other.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen felt utterly helpless in the beast's big mouth. His situation allowed him no room to resist.
<br><br>
Still, he strongly hoped that the octopuses could pull him ashore. After all, it was better to be treated as a bait than to be eaten alive.
<br><br>
The tug of war continued for a while, until the octopuses suddenly exerted their full strength. Zen felt that he was dragged upwards and rushed out of the black pool.
<br><br>
It was still dark around him since he was inside the big mouth, but he definitely felt that he was on his way up! "Bang!"
<br><br>
The pulling went on until the gigantic beast collided with the mountain, and the heavy impact caused it to spat Zen out.
<br><br>
A sharp pain ripped through his body as he landed. He immediately crawled up with the bronze iron plates still on his body. Then he was greeted by the ugly sight of the beast.
<br><br>
The gigantic beast had an incomparably big mouth and two wings. Its entire body was a cyan hue that was as smooth as grease, as if it had been carved from a chunk of jade. However, it was a living gigantic beast, aptly named the Regal Jade Beast.
<br><br>
"Grrr..."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast lowered its head and roared.
<br><br>
Things quickly took an unexpected turn when instead of targeting Zen, it flew towards the nearest octopus.
<br><br>
The octopuses shrieked in horror when they realized that they were no match for the gigantic beast. Thus, they quickly withdrew their tentacles and ran towards the valley.
<br><br>
Even though they moved in high speeds, the beast had caught up to the last octopus and crushed it. Then, it began to bite the creature's body until it was torn into pieces.
<br><br>
Zen had been hanging from the tentacles of the last octopus. Now that it was nothing but chunks of meat, it couldn't take him back to the valley.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast chewed some more until it swallowed the whole octopus in a few gulps, and then it turned to look at Zen.
<br><br>
The beast's terrifying stare sent chills down Zen's spine. In a moment of desperation, he gathered all his strength and rolled down the mountain with the bronze iron plates. The mountain was steep, so he was able to roll down rather quickly. Although the bumpy ride injured him along the way, it was still better than being eaten by the beast! When the beast saw that its target had escaped, a fierce light flashed in its eyes. It wasted no time and followed Zen all the way down! The pig-faced monsters were still kneeling before their purified being.
<br><br>
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise from above and saw that the octopuses had fled back to the triangular caves. It was as if they were escaping from something, which astonished the pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
Chapter 3315 Emerge The octopuses had no natural enemies on Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
In fact, their only shortcoming was that they couldn't leave the triangular caves where they hid, limiting their range of motion.
<br><br>
'What kind of creature chased after them, making them flee like mad?' the pig-faced monsters wondered.
<br><br>
Clatter… clatter… clatter… The octopuses were followed closely by Zen as he rolled down the mountain, still locked in the bronze plates.
<br><br>
The plates bumping along the way made a deafening sound.
<br><br>
Bang! Finally, Zen smashed into the valley. More than half his body was embedded underground.
<br><br>
The two pig-faced monsters nearest Zen paled in shock. If they were caught in Zen's fall, they'd have definitely been crushed.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Look! What's that?"
<br><br>
"That seems to be a Regal Jade Beast…"
<br><br>
Having lived around the black pool for years, the pig-faced monsters knew a little about it.
<br><br>
Creatures in the pool were considered very special—the Regal Jade Bugs being just one kind of them, and at the lowest level.
<br><br>
The bodies of these bugs were nothing like that of common bugs with flesh and blood. They seemed to be carved out of jade, making their bodies extremely tough.
<br><br>
Many strange life forms populated the black pool.
<br><br>
It was said that some pig-faced monsters had even seen giant beasts emerge from the water. The Regal Jade Beasts were cyan all over, and like the Regal Jade Bugs, their bodies seemed carved from jade. But in all the time the pig-faced monsters had been there, the beasts had only appeared once or twice. Many no longer believed in their existence.
<br><br>
No concrete evidence was available to prove whether or not the Regal Jade Beasts really existed in the black pool.
<br><br>
Still, no one explored the black pool and lived. The pig-faced monsters had no idea how deep the water was, nor what creatures lurked down there.
<br><br>
But this time, they encountered the strange Zen. He was probably the only 'bait' who could be re-used after being bitten by the Regal Jade Bugs.
<br><br>
What was most surprising, though, was how he had managed to attract the giant Regal Jade Beast from the black pool! Thump! Thump! Thump! With its great wings and four strong legs, climbing down the mountain was an easy task for the beast.
<br><br>
Just as Zen hit the ground, the Regal Jade Beast also jumped into the valley.
<br><br>
The great beast looked as though it was carved right out of jade. The pigfaced monsters felt its powerful aura and trembled in fear.
<br><br>
But the Regal Jade Beast wasn't interested in the weak pig-faced monsters of the valley. It gave them a quick glance before jumping into one of the triangular caves.
<br><br>
The octopus hiding in the triangular cave naturally tried to resist, but the strength of the Regal Jade Beast was all too great. Even with dozens of tentacles wrapped around its body, it ruined them all with a mere shake of its body.
<br><br>
Both the octopus' tentacles and its head were considered delicacies to the beast. It took a great bite out of the creature, and in mere seconds, the octopus was gobbled up.
<br><br>
When the beast stepped out of the cave, it didn't seem satisfied—it went straight into another cave to feast.
<br><br>
Noises of struggle came from the cave before another octopus was eaten up.
<br><br>
"What should we do?"
<br><br>
"How ferocious!"
<br><br>
"If they're all eaten up… how are we going to survive…"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters looked upset as the onset of doom came over them.
<br><br>
They could establish themselves on Stage Thirteen because they relied on the octopuses. But now that they were eaten up by the beast one by one, the pig-faced monsters could foresee that their life in the Dark Region would be harder.
<br><br>
"We still have Master Teague!"
<br><br>
"Master Teague has already become a purified being!"
<br><br>
"Master Teague! Where are you? Why haven't you appeared? This Regal Jade Beast is no match for you!"
<br><br>
Just now, the light column circled the valley before stopping. Nobody knew what was going on under the tomb.
<br><br>
Once the octopuses were in the Regal Jade Beast's stomach, the beast headed to the valley to slaughter pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
Its prey scattered, shrieking and howling in misery.
<br><br>
After a round of slaughter, its eyes fell right on Zen—this human bait was what had attracted it from the depths of the black pool.
<br><br>
A wry smile made its way to Zen's face as he felt the gaze of the Regal Jade Beast.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Bugs couldn't dream of killing Zen, but this beast easily tore the octopuses apart—Zen's body was probably more like paper in its hands.
<br><br>
But now, Zen was basically a fish on a chopping block. He could barely resist, let alone run away. All he could do was lie on the ground and watch the beast approach him, step by step.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, under the tomb… The human girl wandered in circles before returning to the center of the dark cave, sitting atop bloody piles of meat.
<br><br>
The narrow space was somehow confusing—the world wasn't supposed to be so narrow, cramped, and dark.
<br><br>
What was wrong? Just then, she heard the shouts from outside.
<br><br>
"Master Teague…"
<br><br>
The name sounded familiar…were they calling her? But as she tried to recall in her subconscious, a hateful pig-face appeared in her mind. She couldn't help but frown at the thought of it and tried to direct her mind elsewhere.
<br><br>
Although the shouts were rather annoying, they reminded her that there was a wide world outside the tomb, waiting for her.
<br><br>
"I want to step outside…"
<br><br>
With this thought, she began tapping her foot.
<br><br>
By merely releasing force from her small foot, her body shot up like an arrow. The explosive strength of her physical body was beyond impressive.
<br><br>
Bang! The fresh soil that covered the tomb burst from the girl's strength as she rushed out.
<br><br>
The moment she came into contact with the light, it changed significantly.
<br><br>
Originally, the beam of light was in the shape of a circular column, but the moment it touched the young girl's body, the light concentrated right on her, illuminating her entire figure. Only a bright silhouette remained.
<br><br>
"The light... it makes me comfortable…"
<br><br>
Bathed in light, the girl looked rather relaxed.
<br><br>
She could still feel the countless little spirits contained within the light, subject to her orders.
<br><br>
In a single thought, rays of light were woven into a shiny dress, that fit her perfectly.
<br><br>
Everyone else in the valley was wide-eyed and dumbfounded.
<br><br>
After being madly slaughtered by the Regal Jade Beast, the pig-faced monsters were left in desperate fear. When the tomb exploded, they fled in all directions. Now they felt saved, thinking that Master Teague finally appeared.
<br><br>
But what rushed out from under the tomb was a mere human girl.
<br><br>
Even Zen was just as shocked.
<br><br>
Only a few steps away from him was the Regal Jade Beast, and one of its cyan claws was already pressing onto his head—he was sure he was doomed. But when the human girl came into his view, his surprise almost made him forget the dire situation he was in.
<br><br>
Chapter 3316 Elvinia's Impaired Memory "Elvinia?"
<br><br>
Elvinia now possessed a body on the Other Shore. Zen could recognize her at a glance by her thick black hair and her eyes that were as deep as ancient pools.
<br><br>
When the woman heard the name 'Elvinia', she fell into a trance as her mind began searching for an answer to the meaning of this name.
<br><br>
The name seemed to be hers, but she couldn't recall if it was.
<br><br>
The man in front of her was familiar and intimate as well, but who was he? She was enraged on seeing the Regal Jade Beast had caught hold of the man. "Beast! Stay away from him!" she screeched terrifyingly.
<br><br>
Roar! The Regal Jade Beast felt threatened by the woman and unleashed a great roar. It did not want to provoke her, but it wouldn't let go of Zen either.
<br><br>
It grabbed Zen with a front paw and scaled the mountain wall at the back of the valley. It might have been enormous, but it moved as agile as a kitten.
<br><br>
The woman remained deep in thought. She felt overbearingly uneasy as she watched the man being taken by the Regal Jade Beast but she didn't know why.
<br><br>
Driven by pure instinct, her arm raised up slowly and a ball of light began gathering in her hand.
<br><br>
Buzz! The light rays began swirling and dancing around. Then, a white light shot at the Regal Jade Beast.
<br><br>
No matter how fast and nimble it was, it could not escape the light.
<br><br>
Hiss! A puff of black smoke rose from the body of the Regal Jade Beast as the light hit it. Its once smooth skin now became mottled and dotted with holes all over.
<br><br>
"Woo!"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast let out a miserable cry and slid down from the mountain.
<br><br>
"Kill that gigantic beast!"
<br><br>
"Come on, Master Teague!"
<br><br>
"That beast slaughtered more than half of our race!"
<br><br>
The pig-faced monsters lucky enough to survive shouted while hiding in the corner of the valley.
<br><br>
They didn't know who this woman was, but they figured she must be the purified being if she was able to control the light as she did. Some of them regarded her as Teague.
<br><br>
Just as the Regal Jade Beast was about to fall into the valley, its back shuddered. Suddenly, a fresh pair of wings spread out, allowing it to fly up.
<br><br>
This didn't faze the woman much. Her eyes flashed and she raised her hand to point at the Regal Jade Beast. Within split seconds, countless thick light columns rained down on it.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast's wings made it even more agile and flexible.
<br><br>
Dragging a dark green shadow, it flew between the light columns with ease.
<br><br>
The body of the Regal Jade Beast was much thicker than that of an ordinary physical body. It could sustain the occasional blow of light without serious injury. Like a butterfly fluttering among the flowers, the beast swiveled in, out and around the light columns before it rushed straight towards the woman.
<br><br>
"Elvinia! Look out!" Zen warned at the top of his lungs as he and the Regal Jade Beast dashed down together.
<br><br>
If Elvinia was hit by the gigantic beast, she would be smashed into minced meat.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked, her pupils slightly dilated, and a glowing mark of light appeared beneath her feet. She put her tiptoe into the mark, and with a thin smile on her lips, she muttered, "Great Sanskrit Light..."
<br><br>
This was her instinct. She could summon it at will.
<br><br>
Buzz! A beam of light as thin as a hair erupted from the light mark beneath her foot into the air.
<br><br>
"Oh no... It missed!"
<br><br>
Zen's face saddened as he watched the thin light pass by the Regal Jade Beast.
<br><br>
Zen soon realized how wrong he was. The power Elvinia controlled was far beyond his imagination.
<br><br>
The string of light instantly expanded and formed a dazzling column of light that filled the entire valley in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
The light column caused everything in the valley to vanish into thin air. The stones, the leaves, the caves and the pig-faced monsters had all disappeared.
<br><br>
It continued to expand wildly, causing the mountain walls at both ends of the valley and the cliffs and mountains nearby to disappear too.
<br><br>
This scene left all the creatures lurking in the Dark Region ill at ease.
<br><br>
"Has the purified being of Stage Thirteen been born?"
<br><br>
"I think it's coming from where the pig-faced monsters live."
<br><br>
"Humph, they must be supported by the Blood Assembly. Otherwise, how could a purified being appear among those idiots?"
<br><br>
The light column was tens of thousands of feet in diameter and beamed a few seconds more before it gradually dimmed.
<br><br>
The whole valley, as well as the surrounding mountains had disappeared, and a huge crater was left on the ground.
<br><br>
But the tomb, the tombstone and the dark cave under the tombstone were still intact, standing where they were alone.
<br><br>
Zen stretched his arms out and pushed himself off the ground.
<br><br>
The bronze iron plates had disappeared into the strong light and Zen was free.
<br><br>
"Why? Why hasn't the beast disappeared? How is this possible?"
<br><br>
From the corner of his eye, Zen noticed something greenish on the ground.
<br><br>
It was the Regal Jade Beast, but it was only the size of a fist now.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast must be from the Dark Region. Logically speaking, it should disappear into the light without a trace. Why it had remained and shrunk to this size puzzled Zen.
<br><br>
He reached out and picked it up. It felt cold, as if it was not a living thing and more like a jade stone.
<br><br>
Zen studied the Regal Jade Beast in his hand when a light flashed in front of him. Elvinia had appeared.
<br><br>
"What did you call me just now?" she asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Elvinia," Zen replied with a frown.
<br><br>
She tilted her head, looked at Zen innocently and asked, "What's your name?"
<br><br>
Zen sighed in his heart at Elvinia's question.
<br><br>
When he was grabbed by the tentacles, the white shadow had already rushed to Elvinia's Soul of Light. There was nothing Zen could do back then. He imagined Elvinia's Soul of Light would probably be devoured by the white shadow.
<br><br>
But things had not gone that way at all.
<br><br>
Perhaps something unexpected happened when the white shadow had tried to devour Elvinia's soul; it failed and Elvinia's Memory Flame prevailed over it.
<br><br>
Elvinia's Soul of Light and memory were both damaged.
<br><br>
"My name is Zen Luo," Zen answered.
<br><br>
"Zen Luo..." Elvinia repeated in a soft voice.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and asked, "Do you remember?"
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded and said seriously, "Yes."
<br><br>
Zen looked at her strangely and asked, "What do you remember?"
<br><br>
Suddenly, Elvinia pounced on Zen, embracing him and looking into his eyes tenderly. She would never have acted like this or even looked at him like this before.
<br><br>
"I remember that I seem to like you very much," she said sweetly.
<br><br>
Zen was frozen.
<br><br>
He knew her memory was a mess but that was the last thing he had expected.
<br><br>
Chapter 3317 No Choice Elvinia had always been a cold woman. So Zen was not used to her current tenderness and affection. That was not who she was.
<br><br>
However, at the sight of her exquisite face so close to his, Zen felt his heart racing. She could easily crush any other woman in the Oneness Sky Palace with her radiant beauty. Save one—only Dorothy's lovely visage could hold a candle to hers.
<br><br>
Zen said with a smile, "You must have made a mistake." He then gently pushed Elvinia away.
<br><br>
"Really?"
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyes were filled with confusion. She rummaged through her memories and found another clue among her random fragments of recollection.
<br><br>
A trace of anger suddenly appeared in her eyes. "How dare you intrude into my place!"
<br><br>
"What? Your place?!"
<br><br>
Zen froze for a moment. As quick as a flash, Elvinia shoved her palm into his chest. He had no time to stop her.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
Living creatures of the Dark Region were extremely powerful. Even the pig-faced monsters and human-monkey monsters were far stronger than other creatures living outside, not to mention the black monkeys and the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
The body of a purified being was refined in a special way. Even though it had just been formed, it still contained terrifying power.
<br><br>
Elvinia's light slap contained far more than a thousand divine megatons of force. Zen felt his chest collapse and he was sent flying nearly a mile away.
<br><br>
"Ahem!"
<br><br>
Slowly, painfully, Zen got to his feet, and promptly coughed up two mouthfuls of blood.
<br><br>
'What's wrong with Elvinia? She was gentle and sweet a minute ago, but then she hit me? There was some serious power in that blow. I think she really intended to kill me!' "Whoosh..."
<br><br>
Seeing Zen get up from the ground, Elvinia suddenly raised her eyebrows in dissatisfaction. She tapped the tip of her toe on the ground and flew straight up into the air. Like the lithest acrobat, she made a perfect arc in midair, and swooped down towards Zen, feet first.
<br><br>
If she hit him this time, she would probably stomp him into the ground! Taking a deep breath, Zen rolled sideways and dodged her attack in a rather awkward posture.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Elvinia hit the ground like a meteor, and created a huge crater hundreds of feet in diameter.
<br><br>
Since she missed, she suddenly twisted her body and tried to grab Zen. She acted so quickly that Zen had no time to dodge. He helplessly watched her grab his neck.
<br><br>
Zen had no doubt that even if she used a fraction of her strength, she'd crush his neck and his head would fall from his body. The purified being was terrifying! "Anyone who dares to break into my holy tomb must die!" Elvinia shouted angrily.
<br><br>
"Wait!" Zen raised his hands in surrender.
<br><br>
"Wait for what?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
After listening to what Elvinia had just said, Zen finally figured out what was going on.
<br><br>
He found that not only did she have Elvinia's memories, she also had those of the white shadow, Master Teague of the pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
Teague's memories were quite different. In them, Zen trespassed, walking into the holy tomb to disturb his purification and reincarnation. So he would surely want to kill him. Under the influence of this memory, Elvinia tried to kill Zen as well.
<br><br>
"You've got it all wrong again. Search your memories," Zen immediately said.
<br><br>
"I made a mistake again?" Elvinia was at a loss again. Her grip was tight around Zen's neck.
<br><br>
Zen said helplessly, "Yes, think hard. Who am I?"
<br><br>
She saw his sincere look—he wasn't lying to her. Elvinia began to plumb the depths of her soul, hoping to unearth another clue. Soon after, her expression changed completely, and her look was one of love and affection.
<br><br>
She released Zen's neck and pulled him into her arms. She whispered, "I remember! You are Zen, the one I love!"
<br><br>
This time, Zen decided that silence was golden.
<br><br>
He survived the octopuses and the pig-faced monsters and even withstood the bloody bites of the Regal Jade Bugs in the black pool. But now he was at Elvinia's mercy. If she killed him, that would not be good. That was not what he wanted at all! "Yes, you're right. I'm the one you love," Zen chimed in.
<br><br>
What he wanted to do now was to calm Elvinia down and take her away from here. It would be better if he could escape the Dark Region and leave the Other Shore with her! There were many talented people in the Oneness Sky Palace. Someone there could fix the chaos in her soul, and give her access to the right memories.
<br><br>
"Do you love me?" Elvinia asked, blinking her eyes in curiosity.
<br><br>
"Yes, I do," Zen answered without hesitation.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Elvinia displayed an innocent and childish smile. She carefully sized up Zen, closed her eyes and said, "Then kiss me!"
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Zen was dumbfounded by her sudden request.
<br><br>
Even if they were in a relationship, the Dark Region was no place for a kiss, or anything else for that matter. And Elvinia's newly formed body had a very pungent smell of blood, which was off-putting.
<br><br>
After waiting for a bit with her lips pursed, Elvinia opened her eyes again and gave Zen a puzzled look. "What's wrong?"
<br><br>
"Nothing, nothing..."
<br><br>
Zen was afraid that Teague's memory might come back to haunt her again.
<br><br>
He didn't need that to happen. If he kissed her, that might help. His close brush with death still fresh in his mind, he brought his lips close to hers.
<br><br>
Finally, he kissed her soft lips.
<br><br>
In the past, the Dark Region expanded very slowly in Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
For several thousand years, the Dark Region had only occupied a fifth of the area of Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
But the Dark region was growing. The past few years had seen it expand more rapidly than it had before.
<br><br>
A tremendous untapped vein of Burning Crystal was discovered in Stage Thirteen, which attracted the attention of the more powerful races.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
Three black monkeys bounded through the mountains.
<br><br>
They were man-sized, as opposed to the ten-foot tall giant monkeys.
<br><br>
Their bodies were covered with palm-sized yellow pieces of paper, which emulated the appearance of armor, even if it were made of paper.
<br><br>
Each piece of yellow paper had runes inscribed upon it. As they jumped from rock to tree making their way up the mountain, the yellow paper flapped in the wind, making all kinds of racket.
<br><br>
These black monkeys were far stronger and faster than the rest of their brethren. That's why they were chosen for this mission.
<br><br>
Before long, they ascended the mountain. As they looked down from the peak, they were all shocked.
<br><br>
From their vantage point at the top of the mountain, they could see a circular area. Everything in this area had disappeared. No trees, no rocks, nothing. It looked something had exploded, and taken everything with it.
<br><br>
"Is that... Is that the power of the light?"
<br><br>
"A purified being is stronger than that."
<br><br>
"That's frightening! If the Blood Assembly gets their grubby paws on it. I'm afraid we can't keep the vein."
<br><br>
The two black monkeys grew gloomy.
<br><br>
The black monkey standing at the end of the line said in confusion, "The pig-faced monsters lived here, right? If that purified being is Teague, he wouldn't kill every member of his race and ruin their land. Something's wrong."
<br><br>
Chapter 3318 Important Memory When the black monkey finished its words, the other two also wore cautious expressions on their faces.
<br><br>
No matter how ruthless the purified being was, he wouldn't have killed his own race. It made no sense and caused an uneasy feeling in their hearts.
<br><br>
"Perhaps the purified being... is not a pig-faced monster after all..." another black monkey spoke and voiced its speculations out loud.
<br><br>
"I can't say for sure though," the black monkey shook its head in an attempt to diffuse the suspicions.
<br><br>
"It seems we were right to come here to have a look for ourselves!"
<br><br>
Just as the three black monkeys were immersed in their discussion, several thousand feet away from them, a few red dots of light appeared. Several one-eyed monsters perched atop another mountain scanned the area ahead of them.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
Obviously, the several one-eyed creatures had noticed the presence of the black monkeys as well. Their eyes gleamed with a particular frequency that indicated friendliness.
<br><br>
These one-eyed creatures belonged to a different force and had never encountered the black monkeys before. Apparently, they were also enchanted by the frightening light column.
<br><br>
As a sign of friendship, the black monkeys waved gently at the one-eyed monsters. Then, they moved down from the peak of the mountain.
<br><br>
Besides the black monkeys and the one-eyed monsters, other creatures were lurking nearby in the Dark Region. They were all sneaking up to the area inhabited by the pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
Even though the entire valley now stood destroyed, Zen was still able to tell the right direction.
<br><br>
As long as they followed the mountain stream, they should be able to retrace their steps. They had to climb the back wall of the Grand Sky Temple at the end of the stream to leave the Dark Region safely.
<br><br>
Now with Elvinia's strength, those black monkeys wouldn't dare to make trouble for them.
<br><br>
"Before we leave the Dark Region, I'll store this in your space ring." Zen glanced at Elvinia as he pointed at the small Regal Jade Beast.
<br><br>
"Space ring? I don't understand what you mean..." Elvinia asked while peering over at Zen with curious eyes.
<br><br>
Due to the fact that her memory had almost been wiped clean, she had aged back a few years mentally. She now resembled a child at the age of seven. It made her look innocent and adorable.
<br><br>
"Try to remember what it is yourself," Zen said impatiently.
<br><br>
Elvinia thought long and hard as she blinked at him. Then, she raised her hand and asked, "Is this what you are talking about?"
<br><br>
Buzz! As a white square formed in response to her gesture, a space ring emerged in her hand.
<br><br>
Clatter...
<br><br>
Before Zen could react, Darkness Fruits, candles, soul pills, and a pile of Other Shore Tokens came pouring out from her space ring.
<br><br>
"Wow! So many things to play with!"
<br><br>
Overjoyed by the innumerable objects, Elvinia began to clap her hands in excitement. She grabbed a handful of soul pills and started to play with them.
<br><br>
Zen pursed his lips before he grabbed her hand and stuffed everything back in the space ring. Then, he turned to her and said in a stern voice, "We do not have time for this! You can play to your heart's content after we leave the Dark Region."
<br><br>
"Okay, I'm sorry…" Elvinia nodded obediently but wore a pouty expression when she turned her face away.
<br><br>
Just as Zen proceeded to store the little Regal Jade Beast into the space ring, Elvinia glanced at it, and her expression suddenly switched. Strange darkness hovered over her eyes before she said, "I can't leave the Dark Region."
<br><br>
Hearing her unexpected confession, Zen felt slightly stunned. He raised his brows and asked, "What do you mean you can't leave?"
<br><br>
"I have something very important that I must do…" After she finished her words, she turned in the opposite direction and ran at a surprisingly fast speed.
<br><br>
'What does she mean by that? What could be so important for her to leave like this?' Zen muttered to himself as he gazed at her receding figure.
<br><br>
But now, when Elvinia was in a state where she could not remember anything clearly, Zen had no other choice but to go after her.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Elvinia was dressed in a robe woven by light. It made it easy for him to keep track of her in the dark.
<br><br>
Due to her eye-catching robe, she was easy to be spotted by the creatures lurking in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The three black monkeys were stationed in some secluded area in the darkness. The yellow pieces of paper on their bodies emitted a distinct aura.
<br><br>
This aura could keep their figures hidden, making them hard to be detected through the naked eye.
<br><br>
"That's a purified being!"
<br><br>
"It's a...hu...human?"
<br><br>
"How is that possible..."
<br><br>
The three black monkeys felt collectively puzzled at this sight.
<br><br>
Instinctively, they had pinned the purified being to be Teague. But when they saw it was Elvinia, the human girl, they were in a state of shock.
<br><br>
Aside from the black monkeys, other creatures scattered in other places also shared the same puzzled expression. God knew what had happened to the pig-faced monsters.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elvinia continued to advance with quick steps. She was moving so fast that Zen struggled to keep up with her pace. Fortunately, she did not go too far and abruptly stopped in place. She just stood there and stared blankly ahead into space.
<br><br>
When Zen walked over to her side, he found out that Elvinia was standing in front of the black pool! "It's the black pool..."
<br><br>
Zen stared at the black quagmire and felt his heart sink as he recalled his past experience here. Although the Regal Jade Bugs didn't take his life, that horrible scene alone was enough for him to remember for a lifetime.
<br><br>
After Elvinia unleashed the light column, the surrounding mountains were reduced to the ground. However, the black pool remained intact.
<br><br>
'Elvinia doesn't know about the existence of the black pool. She has been muttering about something important that she needs to do. Since she came here, the recollection about the black pool might not be hers, but Teague's.' Zen concluded as he studied Elvinia's figure.
<br><br>
The important thing Elvinia mentioned must be concerned with Teague, and that was why it was engraved in her mind.
<br><br>
It soon became clear the black pool was by no means just a place to provide the octopuses with food. There was more to it than met the eye...
<br><br>
"Elvinia, what is it that is so important to you?" Zen inquired as he glanced in her direction.
<br><br>
As if possessed, Elvinia kept her gaze steady at the black pool and replied, "I must go in..."
<br><br>
"Look, don't rush into things. There is a kind of deadly poisonous bug in the black pool. If you go in blindly, I'm worried that..."
<br><br>
Just as Zen tried to persuade her out of doing this, she jumped down into the black pool with a plop. Without a hint of hesitation, she had dived down towards the bottom.
<br><br>
"Elvina, wait!"
<br><br>
Although Elvinia's physical body was not to be underestimated, it still wouldn't be able to withstand the poison of the Regal Jade Bugs. Left with no other choice, Zen dived in the black pool to follow after her.
<br><br>
After Zen jumped, he struggled to make sense of his surroundings. The mud was so thick that it became hard for him to move further down.
<br><br>
In a moment of desperation, he grabbed onto Elvinia's feet and was dragged down by her.
<br><br>
One hundred feet....
<br><br>
Three hundred feet...
<br><br>
One thousand feet...
<br><br>
Previously when the octopuses threw Zen into the black pool, he had only covered a distance of a few hundred feet. At that time, Zen was convinced he had reached the bottom of the black pool.
<br><br>
But now, dragged by Elvinia, he had gone further down, and she still didn't stop. It seemed the black pool was much deeper than he had thought.
<br><br>
Along the way, Zen had been worried that they would encounter the Regal Jade Bugs or the Regal Jade Beasts. But none of them showed up.
<br><br>
After diving for more than ten thousand feet, Elvinia suddenly stopped. Zen reached out his hand to touch the bottom of the black pool. The bottom was abnormally chilling and smooth. The feeling resembled when he felt the Regal Jade Beast.
<br><br>
"What the hell is this? Damn it, I can't see anything..."
<br><br>
Just as Zen tried to figure it out, a ball of white blinding light appeared beside him. The moment the light shone, it completely wiped off the black mud stationed at the bottom.
<br><br>
However, when the black mud at the bottom of the pool had vanished, the residue floating above naturally settled back down. Since Elvinia had relied on her ability to continuously release rays of light, she forcefully created a temporary space at the bottom of the black pool.
<br><br>
Chapter 3319 The Civilization Artifact In the light that Elvinia had released, Zen finally saw what was going on around him, surprised.
<br><br>
They were now stepping onto the floor that was made of a huge piece of jade.
<br><br>
"Is this whole floor paved with a single piece of cyan jade?" Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Elvinia seemed to know this and didn't react to Zen's question.
<br><br>
The jade floor at the bottom of the black pool was lined. Elvinia lowered her head to look closely at it. She walked along the patterns, as if she was looking for something.
<br><br>
The jade itself could not resist the light that Elvinia had released. Wherever the light passed through, the surface of the jade floor became corroded.
<br><br>
They walked for a dozen steps at the bottom of the pool when the jade under their feet lightened in color. It started to become transparent, allowing them to easily see through it.
<br><br>
"This is..."
<br><br>
Zen had previously noticed random lines on the jade floor. But as he looked more carefully, he found they weren't lines but Regal Jade Bugs that were embedded in the floor.
<br><br>
Did the Regal Jade Bugs in the black pool grow out of this? A strange thought came to Zen's mind.
<br><br>
This place was full of wonders. Wilder guesses wouldn't feel wrong in this situation.
<br><br>
What he saw next proved him right. The Regal Jade Bugs under the jade floor moved suddenly and began to fly around within the jade, probably having been disturbed by Elvinia's light.
<br><br>
The hard jade was like water to the Regal Jade Bugs. They wandered freely within it.
<br><br>
These bugs would be safe as long as they didn't come out because the jade floor had blocked the light that was capable of eliminating them.
<br><br>
But it looked like they were courting death as they emerged from the floor and began to fly around.
<br><br>
They pointed the cyan needles that were in their mouth upward, and for some time, it looked like the floor was covered with needles.
<br><br>
"Watch out!"
<br><br>
Zen was not sure if Elvinia had the ability to resist the Regal Jade Poison. If she didn't, it would be a lot of trouble if she were to be bitten by these bugs.
<br><br>
Zen lifted Elvinia onto his shoulder.
<br><br>
Puff. Puff. Puff.
<br><br>
Moments later, Zen felt pain in his feet as the needles began to stab him.
<br><br>
Groups of Regal Jade Bugs had gathered at his feet and were stabbing their needles into his soles.
<br><br>
Zen might not be afraid of the Regal Jade Poison, but being stabbed by the needles was still a painful experience.
<br><br>
The needles were densely packed before him and it looked like he was walking on a mountain formed by them.
<br><br>
He had barely taken a few steps before he had to stop because his feet had become a mass of flesh and blood, no thanks to the poisonous needles.
<br><br>
"Go!" Elvinia barked, perched on Zen's shoulder.
<br><br>
She waved a hand and released a ray of strong light that shot out towards Zen's feet, erasing the poisonous needles the moment they emerged from the jade floor. The light had now cleared a path for Zen.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Bugs, on realizing that it was impossible to stop Zen, rushed with a mad buzz towards Elvinia instead.
<br><br>
"Humph!"
<br><br>
Elvinia snorted and smiled contemptuously.
<br><br>
A white circle of light spread out from her body. The Regal Jade Bugs found it impossible to go anywhere near Elvinia, because the moment they left the jade floor they were completely erased.
<br><br>
The suicide attacks of the Regal Jade Bugs had lasted for about three minutes before they finally stopped. No one knew how many Regal Jade Bugs had died in the light.
<br><br>
"Hoo..."
<br><br>
Zen breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
They were lucky to get rid of the Regal Jade Bugs and he hoped they would not encounter the Regal Jade Beasts.
<br><br>
This thought had barely entered his mind when a pair of huge eyes loomed before him. It looked like a huge Regal Jade Beast was embedded under the floor.
<br><br>
The beast's eyes were wide open but lifeless.
<br><br>
"If this thing comes out, we'll be in so much trouble!" Zen murmured.
<br><br>
He was incapable of fighting against the Regal Jade Beast at the moment.
<br><br>
Even Elvinia would have great difficulty in subduing it.
<br><br>
But Zen was worrying unnecessarily. The Regal Jade Beast didn't emerge from the jade floor.
<br><br>
They had walked some distance when Zen spotted more Regal Jade Beasts - about sixty of them - intertwined with each other.
<br><br>
And these were only the Regal Jade Beasts that were visible. God knew how much deeper this jade was. There were probably countless Regal Jade Beasts hiding in its depths.
<br><br>
If these Regal Jade Beasts were let out, they might easily flatten Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
He walked a few hundred feet before the Regal Jade Beasts were left behind. The color of the jade floor under his feet had turned into a shade of dark green.
<br><br>
Zen had just begun to think that there was nothing underneath him when a ten-foot long cyan feather appeared out of nowhere.
<br><br>
"Such a huge feather!" Zen said, surprised.
<br><br>
"Finally found it!" Elvinia gasped, smiling, and jumped off Zen's shoulder.
<br><br>
She tiptoed towards the feather.
<br><br>
Zen followed close behind and as he looked down, he found that more and more feathers were appearing. A sudden thought flashed through his mind.
<br><br>
These feathers belonged to the wings of a giant bird! Was there a giant bird lurking underneath this jade floor? He was proved right when he spotted the huge bird head some distance away.
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't stop running until after she had passed the bird's head.
<br><br>
Underneath the surface of the jade floor was a spiky ball in the shape of a diamond.
<br><br>
Elvinia looked at it for a while before kneeling down on the ground beside it.
<br><br>
She placed her hand on the floor above the diamond shaped spiky ball and released a bright light from her palm.
<br><br>
The jade floor melted quickly under the strong light, leaving a gaping hole in its wake and exposing the diamond-shaped spiky ball.
<br><br>
He didn't know what the ball was made of. The surface of the ball darkened under the strong light but it showed no signs of melting.
<br><br>
"What's this?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"I don't know," Elvinia answered.
<br><br>
She had come here driven by her memory to find the diamond shaped spiky ball. She didn't know what exactly it was or what it could be used for.
<br><br>
Zen was speechless. It was a long time later that he helplessly said, "You have looked for it for so long. And now you've found it and you're saying you don't know what it is!"
<br><br>
"Let me think," Elvinia said. She searched her memory, head tilted and eyes narrowed at the ball. A few minutes later, she burst out, "Got it! It seems to be called the Civilization Artifact!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3320 The Regal Jade Civilization "The Civilization Artifact?" It was hard for Zen to figure out exactly what the item was just based on its name. "What is it used for?"
<br><br>
"I'm not sure. If I could just remember..."
<br><br>
Elvinia continued to search her memories for information about the artifact.
<br><br>
But as she thought about it, she felt something tear deep in her soul, as if a memory was about to break through. All of a sudden, she covered her head with both hands and squatted down. "Oww! It hurts..."
<br><br>
"Clatter!"
<br><br>
As soon as she released her hand, the Civilization Artifact fell to the ground.
<br><br>
"I really can't remember. My head hurts!" Elvinia complained.
<br><br>
Apparently, she couldn't think too much of this. Trying to dig too deeply into her memories was quite painful. Zen stretched out his hand and gently rubbed her forehead. Then he asked her to take out dozens of soul pills and swallow them.
<br><br>
Elvinia's physical body was different from Zen's.
<br><br>
Zen's body was projected onto the Other Shore from the Source World, and the projected body seemed just like his real one. But only Elvinia's soul entered the Other Shore, and the body she inhabited here was like the armor. What form she would take after she left here, only the gods knew.
<br><br>
But at least she could still absorb the soul pills. That was the silver lining.
<br><br>
After taking the soul pills, Elvinia looked better. She didn't seem quite so pale, and she seemed more energetic. She pursed her lips and put her arms around her knees, unwilling to dredge up her memories again. She said, "I don't know what it is. Here you go! Take it if you want."
<br><br>
Hearing her complaint, Zen could only comfort her, "Alright. I'll study it and figure out what it is..."
<br><br>
Then, Zen bent down to pick up the Civilization Artifact and placed it in his palm, observing it closely.
<br><br>
The item was extremely delicate. It was a diamond-like gem inlaid with over ten sharp thorns.
<br><br>
Zen touched the sharp thorns and twisted one of them as an experiment.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
The thorns could twist! Zen was slightly shocked. This should have done something, and maybe he triggered some mechanism.
<br><br>
'Okay, so maybe that isn't the right one. How about this one?' After thinking about this, Zen began to twist the thorns one by one. He moved on to the next, and the one after that.
<br><br>
"Click, click, click..."
<br><br>
Every time a thorn was twisted, the Civilization Artifact would respond with a faint chime.
<br><br>
The sound seemed to come from under the jade, but Zen looked around and could not ascertain where it emanated from.
<br><br>
When Zen twisted the final sharp thorn, the ground began shaking under their feet. Zen and Elvinia had to fight to keep their balance.
<br><br>
"Dong!"
<br><br>
The huge jade under the black pool started to shudder.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
The black monkeys lurking in the dark and the other races also felt the quake, and they saw the black mud in the black pool constantly surging out and flowing in all directions.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Something is rising from the black pool!"
<br><br>
"What's that?"
<br><br>
The black mud from the pool flowed away, and a huge jade stone was revealed. This stone was millions of feet wide.
<br><br>
As the giant jade stone continued to rise, the ground around the black pool cracked. More jade was exposed, so Zen and Elvinia also rose from the bottom of the pool.
<br><br>
"That's... a huge city?"
<br><br>
Zen looked around, his eyes wide from shock.
<br><br>
The originally flat surface of the jade ground began to change. Some parts of the ground started to sink, and the others started to bulge. The ground fell away to lay bare many roofs, turrets, towers, houses, and even bridges...
<br><br>
Who would have guessed there was a huge city beneath the black pool, carved entirely out of jade! There were all sorts of creatures embedded within the Regal Jade City, such as the Regal Jade Bugs and the Regal Jade Beasts...
<br><br>
In addition, there were pythons, unicorn cows, and other strange creatures with alien shapes.
<br><br>
Zen was not the only one who was shaken up by this. The creatures from the Dark Region hiding in every corner were flabbergasted when they laid eyes on the Regal Jade City.
<br><br>
The calmest one among them might be Elvinia.
<br><br>
She just thought that the green city looked incredibly beautiful. But she had no interest in what it might mean.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
More and more stairs appeared and spread from the surface of the giant stone to Zen's feet.
<br><br>
The steps led to a jade tower close by.
<br><br>
"Let's go and have a look," Zen said.
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't respond. She figured that thinking had given her that splitting headache, so she decided not to do too much of that. She delightedly followed behind Zen.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia ascended the jade staircase. Within a few seconds, they had reached the top of the tower.
<br><br>
At the top of the tower, there was a square platform, on which floated a glowing speck. It was like a little pinprick of light. The speck danced around like a fairy, but it couldn't leave the square platform.
<br><br>
Zen walked to the side of the platform and stretched out his hand, trying to touch the thing. But his hand passed right through it. It seemed that it existed in a different dimension and could not touch Zen's physical body.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
After the speck of light passed through Zen's palm, it curled up in the corner of the square platform and convulsed continuously. It seemed to point to Zen's left hand which held the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"Do you want this?" Zen asked, pointing at the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
He didn't know whether the green speck of light understood his words or not, and it only continued dancing.
<br><br>
The moment Zen placed the Civilization Artifact on the platform, the speck of light shot towards it.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Soon after, a green light shot out from the Civilization Artifact and enveloped Zen and Elvinia in its rays.
<br><br>
Zen felt the sky and earth spinning. The Regal Jade City disappeared and was replaced by a void. Brown clouds floated in that void.
<br><br>
Elvinia walked into the void and asked nonchalantly, "Where are we?"
<br><br>
Zen had already deduced that the scenery of the void was the chaos. Just as he was about to answer Elvinia, a loud voice rang out from the void. "This is the chaos."
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked and asked, "Then who are you?"
<br><br>
"I am the Regal Jade Spirit and the only member of the Regal Jade race who is still awake. The rest of them have slept for hundreds of millions of years," the clear voice answered.
<br><br>
"Then where did the city go? Is it an illusion?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Following Elvinia's memories, they had taken great pains to obtain the Civilization Artifact. Surely it wasn't showing them only the pretty scenery, was it? "The Civilization Artifact has recorded the development of the 749th chaos.
<br><br>
You can see the birth, the beginning, the growth and the destruction of the entire Regal Jade Civilization..." the voice answered.
<br><br>
"The 749th chaos?" Zen was slightly stunned.
<br><br>
"Yes, we are the 749th civilization to rule the chaos." A trace of pride could be heard in that disembodied voice.
<br><br>
Chapter 3321 The Battle Between Civilizations In the old days, many ruling civilizations existed in the chaos.
<br><br>
The Dreaded Eye Demons and the Grand Sky race were two of those ruling civilizations that reigned over the entire chaos.
<br><br>
"There are seven hundred forty nine ruling civilizations?" Zen smiled as he was told about this incredible piece of information. "It seems that the number of ruling civilizations is a lot more than I originally thought," he said.
<br><br>
"Indeed. There are many ruling civilizations," the voice replied confidently.
<br><br>
"However, only some of them are strong. At the very least, our Regal Jade Civilization is among the top ten."
<br><br>
Zen didn't respond to this bold statement. Meanwhile, No. 9527 seemed unconvinced. "Really? The top ten?" asked the silent spectator.
<br><br>
"Why? What's wrong?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Humph, the Regal Jade Spirit is only exaggerating," No. 9527 sneered.
<br><br>
The moment the Regal Jade Bugs and Regal Jade Beasts appeared, No.
<br><br>
9527 already distinguished them as the civilization that once existed in the chaos.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, the history of every civilization and creature that ever lived on the Other Shore could be traced. Their movements could be located in the past chaos. As such, No. 9527 didn't find much importance in the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
"What are you trying to say?" Zen seemed a little bit intrigued.
<br><br>
"The top ten civilizations have all been recorded. Nonetheless, there isn't any record of the Regal Jade Civilization being one of them. They remain in Stage Thirteen, which shows that they are not that strong. If they are really one of the top ten, then they should be within Stage Thirty Two, at least!"
<br><br>
answered No. 9527 with much skepticism.
<br><br>
After listening to what No. 9527 said, Zen questioned the Regal Jade Spirit, "Well, since you claim to be one of the top ten ruling civilizations, why do you stay in Stage Thirteen?"
<br><br>
The voice kept silent for a while. There was no point in keeping secrets about the Regal Jade Civilization anymore. With that, it replied, "It's because the 748th civilization is hunting us down."
<br><br>
"Hmm, the 748th civilization? What kind of civilization is it?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Once more, his curiosity was piqued.
<br><br>
Hearing this, No. 9527 was baffled. Even though it had a significant portion of its master's memory, it didn't have much information about the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"It's the Nihility race. They are the ruling civilization above us," the voice replied gloomily. It seemed to remember how awful they were.
<br><br>
"The Nihility race? The one that believes in the Nihility Way?" Zen frowned.
<br><br>
No. 9527 once told him that a group of lunatics intentionally aspired to destroy everything in the chaos. They were convinced of the Nihility Way and attempted to drive the chaos into oblivion.
<br><br>
"The Nihility race ranks seventh among the top ten civilizations," said No.
<br><br>
9527 gravely. It began to believe the Regal Jade Spirit's claim. "If what the Regal Jade Spirit said is true, the Regal Jade Civilization truly won't have a foothold in any upper stage of the Other Shore since the Nihility race is set upon killing them."
<br><br>
"In order to preserve the remaining glimmer of hope for our civilization, we have hidden our last hometown in Stage Thirteen. The Nihility race is not able to return to the Lust World. Even if they do come, they do not have the ability to kill us here," replied the Regal Jade Spirit firmly.
<br><br>
"The chaos in which the Nihility race resided was destroyed and then you rose to power. Why did they chase after you?" Zen asked the voice once more.
<br><br>
The past chaos contained too many secrets. The more Zen knew about it, the more he felt like there were lots more he had not uncovered yet.
<br><br>
"It's very simple. During the era of the Regal Jade Civilization, the Nihility race had almost destroyed the entire chaos. However, we put a stop to all of it," the Regal Jade Spirit answered proudly.
<br><br>
There were many other civilizations that followed after the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
If it weren't for their interference during that time, the new civilizations would not have existed anymore. The chaos would have been empty by now.
<br><br>
"In addition to that, we found a way to change the fate of the chaos," the Regal Jade Spirit continued. It seemed very eager to talk about their civilization.
<br><br>
"A way to change the fate of the chaos?" As he heard this, Zen became excited and asked, "Are you talking about the Finale Way?"
<br><br>
"Yes," confirmed the Regal Jade Spirit. "We have found some clues. You can find them all in the Civilization Artifact."
<br><br>
Just as Zen was talking to the Regal Jade Spirit, a dot of green light appeared in the illusion. It meant the birth of a new world.
<br><br>
After countless cycles of annihilation and rebirth within the past hundreds of millions of years, several kinds of extraordinary lives were born in the chaos. The Regal Jade Civilization was the most peculiar one among all of them.
<br><br>
The members of the Regal Jade Civilization didn't possess a body. The substance they were made of was jade.
<br><br>
The dot of green light was the Source World during the era of the Regal Jade Civilization. It was also an incredibly large piece of jade.
<br><br>
The images presented before Zen's eyes were rapidly changing.
<br><br>
The jade world continued to expand as the chaotic energy continued to gather within that magnificent large piece of jade. In this world, there were a variety of creatures that were made up of jade.
<br><br>
In contrast with the other civilizations, all the creatures in the Regal Jade Civilization were united and cooperative. Wars within the same race were almost non-existent and development was remarkably fast.
<br><br>
With a flash of green light, a jade creature appeared before Zen.
<br><br>
The creature was a bird. Even though it was only as big as a fist, Zen recognized it at once. "It's the enormous bird that is sealed in the Regal Jade City!" he said enthusiastically.
<br><br>
"It's the Wing King. It's the first powerhouse in the Regal Jade Civilization to reach the Other Shore and the king of our civilization." There were certain courteousness and reverence in the way the Regal Jade Spirit uttered these words.
<br><br>
Zen finally understood what he saw before.
<br><br>
He was extremely shocked to see a gigantic bird sealed under the jade ground.
<br><br>
Apparently, that giant bird was the king of a civilization! In Zen's era, even the strongest warriors of the super forces were of no match for the Wing King. These warriors included those from the Snake Goddess race, the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
In an instant, the Wing King grew before Zen's eyes. From the size of a fist, it transformed into a gigantic bird. Simultaneously, the entire jade world became even larger and more prosperous.
<br><br>
The birth, beginning, resurgence, and destruction of the Regal Jade Civilization were all recorded in the Civilization Artifact, just as the Regal Jade Spirit said.
<br><br>
In spite of this, a rebellion broke out during the most prosperous stage of the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
The entire jade world split into two groups. It started to collapse into the chaos of the battle that lasted for several years.
<br><br>
"The rebels were controlled by the people of the Nihility race on the Other Shore. They were the ones who truly incited the rebellion. The Regal Jade Civilization almost fell into ruin," revealed the Regal Jade Spirit despairingly.
<br><br>
"Hence, the Wing King also chose the Finale Way but failed?" Zen asked inquisitively.
<br><br>
"Yes, he failed." The Regal Jade Spirit sounded a little regretful. "He had been successful in finding the clues left behind by the first ruling civilization. He had also been able to find the way to realize the Godly Ways Great Unity. Ultimately, He still failed."
<br><br>
"Hmm, the way to realize the Godly Ways Great Unity?" pondered Zen. As soon as he heard this, Zen became interested even more. The final solution to the Finale Way turned out to be the Godly Ways Great Unity.
<br><br>
Chapter 3322 The Instant Civilization The Godly Ways Great Unity was the power source of the whole chaos.
<br><br>
Everything in the chaos was formed by the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
When the chaos was created, the Ways-blending Energy was divided into 3, 000 kinds of power, which were known as the 3, 000 Godly Ways.
<br><br>
A lot of powerhouses had mastered the 3, 000 Godly Ways, but up until now, no one had been able to fuse them all to form the Godly Ways Great Unity.
<br><br>
Even so, Zen did not give up the Ways-blending Energy. However, in recent years, he had spent most of his time on the Other Shore and was too busy to attempt to fuse the Godly Ways.
<br><br>
"This nonsense again? The 3, 000 Godly Ways have never been fused perfectly. I don't think they'll ever be fused!" No. 9527 told Zen firmly.
<br><br>
Zen questioned the Regal Jade Spirit, "As far as I know, many people in the Source World practice the 3, 000 Godly Ways, but no one has succeeded in merging them into one. Even the Chaos Ancient Gods who had observed the Godly Ways Great Unity and mastered the truths couldn't do it."
<br><br>
"The Chaos Ancient Gods who had mastered the truths? Do you mean the Sons of Truth?" The Regal Jade Spirit smiled faintly. "The Sons of Truth were just some housekeepers after the chaos was created. The truths that they had mastered were defective."
<br><br>
"The truths were defective? How is that possible?" Surprise was written all over Zen's face.
<br><br>
"No way! Nonsense! The truths are the most powerful forces in the chaos.
<br><br>
How can there be flaws? Impossible!" No. 9527 shouted defensively from within Zen, unconvinced.
<br><br>
The reason why the Chaos Ancient Gods were supreme in the chaos was that they each mastered an insurmountable truth that was above all the power. However, the Regal Jade Spirit actually said that the truths were defective. Naturally, it was difficult for No. 9527 to accept.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit sneered, "I was a Son of Truth before; I had also mastered a truth. How could I speak nonsense?"
<br><br>
"You had mastered a truth before?" Zen's eyes widened in shock.
<br><br>
"Yes, in the era when the 750th civilization, also known as the Grand Sky race, ruled the chaos, I was a Son of Truth, or what you call a Chaos Ancient God," the Regal Jade Spirit said calmly, as though this was no big deal.
<br><br>
Once the Godly Ways Great Unity created the chaos, its energy had been completely depleted. Creatures born after the chaos was created would never have the chance to observe the Godly Ways Great Unity and thus could not become Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
No. 9527's master was a creature of the last chaos.
<br><br>
All of the Grand Nature Treasures were passed down from the last chaos.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit was born in the 749th chaos. After the 749th chaos was destroyed, all the energy was consolidated and fused into the Godly Ways Great Unity again. Then, the Regal Jade Spirit had a chance to study the Godly Ways Great Unity, enough to master a truth from it. Thus, it was able to become a Chaos Ancient God in the following chaos.
<br><br>
The Grand Sky race was also a ruling civilization. Zen had heard of it from the Ear Mice before, but he never would've thought that the Regal Jade Spirit was a Chaos Ancient God of this civilization.
<br><br>
Zen reflected on this for a moment. What did the Regal Jade Spirit mean when it said the Son of Truth was nothing but a housekeeper of the chaos? "But why are truths defective?" Zen finally muttered. Although the Regal Jade Spirit was an actual legend, he still felt what it said was unbelievable.
<br><br>
"The energy of the Godly Ways Great Unity they observed had defects; consequently, the truths they mastered were also defected," the Regal Jade Spirit explained. "Only the first ruling civilization had observed the perfect Godly Ways Great Unity. All the following Godly Ways Great Unity had flaws."
<br><br>
It started to make sense, yet Zen still found himself shaking his head.
<br><br>
"What kind of civilization is the first ruling civilization?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Chaos had been created and destroyed alternately, but it all started with the first ruling civilization. Naturally, Zen was curious about it.
<br><br>
"It is also known as the Instant Civilization," the Regal Jade Spirit answered.
<br><br>
"The Instant Civilization?"
<br><br>
"Yes. It only lasted for an instant. Then the whole chaos was destroyed," the Regal Jade Spirit explained.
<br><br>
A civilization, from its inception to its peak, would have to last countless years. However, this Instant Civilization had only existed for an instant. Zen rubbed his temples in utter confusion.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit, observing Zen's reaction, continued to explain, "An instant passes in the blink of an eye for you and me. But for the Instant Civilization, it is eternal. Their concept of time is different from ours.
<br><br>
Nearly half of the Sanskrit words were created by the Instant Civilization.
<br><br>
You should have seen Sanskrit words as you entered the Other Shore by the Truth of Godly Way."
<br><br>
"The Sanskrit words were created by the Instant Civilization?"
<br><br>
Zen repeated numbly. He had long known that Sanskrit words were spread from the Other Shore, but he didn't know who had created them, not until now.
<br><br>
He never thought the Sanskrit words would date back to the earliest stages of the chaos.
<br><br>
As Zen and the Regal Jade Spirit continued talking, the pictures continued to slide. The Regal Jade Civilization had been split into two divisions, and there was an extremely fierce battle.
<br><br>
The majestic Wing King appeared in the battle, his wings fluttering with luminous colors.
<br><br>
Zen was familiar with this colorful luster. It was exactly the Ways-blending Energy. However, it was much fuller and stronger, and it seemed to emit an indescribable energy. Although the energy was tiny, he could tell it played an important role.
<br><br>
Although he was just being presented with an illusion, Zen could still feel its massive power.
<br><br>
"So this is the perfect Ways-blending Energy? Is this the Godly Ways Great Unity?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
He thought he knew the answer, but to his surprise, the Regal Jade Spirit continued, "We once thought that the Wing King had grasped the perfect Ways-blending Energy, but after the Regal Jade Civilization was destroyed, we realized that it was not perfect."
<br><br>
If the Wing King had grasped the perfect Ways-blending Energy, the 749th chaos ruled by the Regal Jade Civilization would've lived on. It would not be punctured by that needle, and the Finale Way would have been realized.
<br><br>
"It was still not perfect?" Zen exclaimed, at a total loss.
<br><br>
"No. The Wing King made up for one flaw of the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
But there are still two flaws in it," the Regal Jade Spirit said. "So, we have been waiting for the right person to make up for the two flaws."
<br><br>
"And who is the right person?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"The one who has our Civilization Artifact," the Regal Jade Spirit answered bluntly.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Elvinia, who stood next to him. Her big eyes were bright and full of curiosity as she eagerly watched the colorful pictures that constantly changed in front of her.
<br><br>
"You mean Elvinia?" Zen raised an eyebrow.
<br><br>
"She..." the Regal Jade Spirit trailed off in hesitation. Then it said, "She can't do it."
<br><br>
Chapter 3323 Identification The Regal Jade Spirit quietly observed the two humans that stood before it.
<br><br>
Although the Regal Jade race was vastly different from the human race, it could tell that Elvinia was not suitable to take charge of the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"We have been waiting for too long. It's not the first time that creatures have come to visit us over the years," the Regal Jade Spirit sighed. "The one most suitable to control the Civilization Artifact is not a purified being, but someone who cultivates the Ways-blending Energy. You are not suitable for the role. So, please leave."
<br><br>
The warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the thirteen stages of the Lust World were far from reaching the Chaotic Source Realm, so it was impossible for them to take the time to cultivate the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Even in the Source World, only top-level masters of the super powers, like Fuxi and Chiyou, could master the 3, 000 Godly Ways.
<br><br>
The members of the Regal Jade Civilization had been hiding in the Lust World, so it was impossible for them to find a suitable person.
<br><br>
However, because they lived inside the Regal Jade City, they were immortal.
<br><br>
It didn't matter whether the chaos was destroyed or created; the Other Shore would not be affected.
<br><br>
Hence, they were in no rush to select the person they wanted.
<br><br>
Buzz! The moment the Regal Jade Spirit had finished speaking, Zen gathered the internal momentum in his inner world. A blazing white light shot out in front of the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
"Is this the Ways-blending Energy you were talking about?" Zen asked with a smile.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit was taken aback. At a glance, it made an accurate judgment. "2, 994 Godly Ways! You fused them?!"
<br><br>
"Yes, you could say that," replied Zen calmly.
<br><br>
Zen had been continuously fusing the Godly Ways in the divine land.
<br><br>
However, the more progress he made, the more difficult it became.
<br><br>
Moreover, he had been busy lately, so he had failed to make further progress.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God had helped Zen a lot. It was easy for him to cultivate the Godly Ways that the Evil God had fused, so he was quickly able to fuse 2, 994 Godly Ways.
<br><br>
"Interesting!" The Regal Jade Spirit eyed Zen from head to toe. "You are not a purified being. You stay in the Dark Region by eating Darkness Fruits, right?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded in reply.
<br><br>
"But a Wild God is weak," the Regal Jade Spirit said with a hint of regret.
<br><br>
"You are still not qualified."
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Regal Jade Spirit, the most suitable person was not only a purified being, but also a creature that specialized in merging Godly Ways.
<br><br>
Although Zen had practiced the merging of the Godly Ways, his own strength alone was not enough. Moreover, compared to a purified being, the Wild God was at least two levels weaker.
<br><br>
Even though the Regal Jade Spirit had rejected Zen, it suddenly released a cyan light that scanned Zen's body to assess his physical strength.
<br><br>
Buzz! As the cyan light swept across Zen's body, the Regal Jade Spirit gasped.
<br><br>
"How can this be?"
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Zen asked, brows knitted.
<br><br>
"You haven't mastered the Truth of Powerful Holy Body!" The Regal Jade Spirit was surprised. "What's going on? Although you are a Wild God, you didn't cultivate the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. Then how did you get your body to the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
There were some exceptions in the world, and Zen was one of them.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit had thought that it had seen through everything, but now, it was obvious it had never seen anybody like Zen.
<br><br>
"Well..." Zen scratched his head, at a loss for words.
<br><br>
He could feel that his body contained a Truth of Godly Way, but he couldn't tell what it was exactly.
<br><br>
"The strength of your body is far beyond that of a Wild God, but not as strong as that of a purified being." The Regal Jade Spirit wavered.
<br><br>
All of the members of the Regal Jade Civilization had sealed themselves up and fallen into a deep sleep. It could turn to no one for advice, and could only make the judgment on its own.
<br><br>
If it were to give the Civilization Artifact to Zen, it meant that Zen would hold the core to the Regal Jade Civilization. Needless to say, it had to be careful before making any rash decisions.
<br><br>
Zen stood there in silence, waiting patiently.
<br><br>
If it was anything else, Zen wouldn't have much interest in it.
<br><br>
However, since it was related to the secret of the Ways-blending Energy, he couldn't let it go. Especially since the Regal Jade Spirit mentioned the three flaws, he needed to know if he could make up for them.
<br><br>
"I suppose I can give you a chance," the Regal Jade Spirit finally said with a firm nod. "You can merge with the Civilization Artifact!"
<br><br>
As soon as the Regal Jade Spirit finished speaking, the chaotic void enveloping Zen and Elvinia disappeared. They returned to the high platform. The diamond-shaped Civilization Artifact emitted a green luster as it floated towards Zen.
<br><br>
It was very clear that it wanted Zen to integrate it into his body directly.
<br><br>
However, try as he might, Zen's body was unable to merge with the Other Shore Token. To be exact, he didn't know how to merge the Other Shore Token with his body. He said, "I'm afraid I can't merge with the Civilization Artifact here. Can I bring it to the outside of the Dark Region?"
<br><br>
As long as he left the Dark Region, he would be able to return to the Other Shore with his soul.
<br><br>
Among the three Truths of Godly Ways he had been practicing, the Truth of Cultivation Nature was left empty.
<br><br>
In fact, Zen's purpose for this trip to the Dark Region was to merge an Other Shore Token with his Truth of Cultivation Nature. However, his adventures in the Dark Region almost caused him to die.
<br><br>
"Sure," the voice of the Regal Jade Spirit echoed from the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
Zen then turned to Elvinia to ask her to activate her space ring. He was going to store the Civilization Artifact in it.
<br><br>
Suddenly, shadows darted towards them in the darkness.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! "Those damned black monkeys are here!" Zen cried irritably.
<br><br>
The black monkeys had been shocked at the discovery of the Regal Jade City.
<br><br>
While the Regal Jade Civilization was very little known, by instinct, they could tell that this was something extraordinary. Thus, they decided to wait and lurk in the darkness.
<br><br>
As soon as the Regal Jade Spirit lifted the illusion, the black monkeys rushed into the Regal Jade City and headed straight for the tower.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The golden Sanskrit words shone on the yellow paper plastered on the bodies of three black monkeys.
<br><br>
With the reinforcement of the light, each black monkey moved with astonishing power and speed.
<br><br>
The black monkey in the lead launched itself directly onto Zen, trying to yank the Civilization Artifact out of his hand. Elvinia, who was standing next to Zen, bared her teeth angrily.
<br><br>
She hated the pig-faced monsters and the black monkeys instinctively. She remembered previously, those monkeys had chased them all the way to the valley.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
she screamed with a murderous look.
<br><br>
As she raised her hand, a bright light shot out towards the black monkeys.
<br><br>
Whack! She managed to strike one of the black monkeys. The yellow paper on its body burst into flames.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, the yellow paper had blocked the light for a moment. The black monkey rushed to Zen with flames.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! The Civilization Artifact was knocked out of Zen's hand. It plunged down from the tower.
<br><br>
"It falls!"
<br><br>
"We must get it!"
<br><br>
The other two monkeys ignored their companion and immediately leapt off the tower to chase after the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
Chapter 3324 How Dare You The Civilization Artifact plunged down from the top of the tower, followed by the two black monkeys chasing after it. Then, a hairy hand suddenly caught it.
<br><br>
The owner of this large hand was a one-eyed monster, from another powerful force in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Hey, hey..."
<br><br>
The one-eyed monsters lurked in the dark, just like the black monkeys did.
<br><br>
They had been observing everything that happened in the Regal Jade City.
<br><br>
When they watched the black monkeys rush into the scene, they too rushed over anxiously.
<br><br>
They didn't expect that as soon as they entered the Regal Jade City, they saw something, flickering green light, falling down. It was a sheer coincidence that one of their members caught the mysterious falling object.
<br><br>
This one-eyed monster was overjoyed. In its excitement, it didn't even take the time to study the object up close. Instead, it just cried, "I've got it! Let's go!"
<br><br>
The rest of the monsters cheered and then followed closely behind. In no time, they dashed towards the outside of the Regal Jade City.
<br><br>
"Stop there! One-eyed guy! How dare you!"
<br><br>
Watching the one-eyed monsters recede in the distance, the two black monkeys cursed in fury.
<br><br>
The three black monkeys were the elites stationed in the Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. They had fostered a good working relationship with each other. But now, one of them had lost its life, only for their prize to be stolen by a herd of savage one-eyed monsters! How could they possibly be willing to accept that? "Phew!"
<br><br>
Golden light flashed on the pieces of yellow paper on the two black monkeys. Jumping down from the tower like two shooting stars, they let fury fill their beady eyes as they chased after the one-eyed monsters.
<br><br>
Zen, too, was furious. It had taken him a great deal to get his hands on that Civilization Artifact. But now, it had been taken away by others.
<br><br>
"Elvinia! We must go after them!"
<br><br>
Dragging Elvinia by the arm, he leapt off the tower.
<br><br>
Elvinia had little interest in the Civilization Artifact. She didn't even know what that thing meant. However, seeing Zen go after it like a madman, she felt like she wanted whatever Zen wanted.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the two black monkeys were steadily closing in on the oneeyed monsters. On a normal basis, the two group were of the same strength.
<br><br>
However, with the Sanskrit words written on the yellow papers, the black monkeys' power was strengthened greatly.
<br><br>
In just a few seconds, the two black monkeys caught up to the one-eyed monsters.
<br><br>
"Fight them! Now!"
<br><br>
The one-eyed monsters weren't stupid. They could tell that whatever they had caught back at the tower was extremely valuable. They were definitely willing to fight for it.
<br><br>
Two one-eyed monsters suddenly stopped running, and turned to face the monkeys. A strange symbol lit up in each of their eyes.
<br><br>
"Cut and lock!"
<br><br>
The theurgy of the one-eyed monster was all in the eye. As the symbols flashed in their eyes, the space in their sight was cut apart, forming a space cage that enveloped the two black monkeys.
<br><br>
"A space cage. Big deal!"
<br><br>
One of the black monkeys dashed forward. As it collided with the space cage, hairline cracks crawled around the walls of the space cage. In an instant, the cage was smashed with a loud bang.
<br><br>
The other black monkey planted its foot on the shoulder of the one in front of it, and then launched itself into the air, kicking one of the one-eyed monsters with astounding strength.
<br><br>
"Hand it over, or I'll eat you!" a black monkey threatened.
<br><br>
These black monkeys were extremely barbaric in the Dark Region and ate almost anything, including one-eyed monsters.
<br><br>
"No way!"
<br><br>
At that moment, a mysteriously colored halo appeared in the monster's eye.
<br><br>
As the halo flickered, the black monkey stopped in its tracks. It seemed to be bewitched by the mysterious halo.
<br><br>
While the black monkey was in a trance, the one-eyed monster tossed the Civilization Artifact to one of its companions.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen and Elvinia caught up to them.
<br><br>
Elvinia wrinkled her nose in disgust as soon as her eyes landed on these creatures of the Dark Region. Anger surging within her, she decided right then and there she would spare them no mercy.
<br><br>
"Great Sanskrit Light!"
<br><br>
A ray of light circled around Elvinia's slender fingers.
<br><br>
Zen had witnessed the power of the Great Sanskrit Light before.
<br><br>
Although it had no effect on a creature like Zen who was not from the Dark Region, the Great Sanskrit Light could cause a terrifying blow to anything in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Just as Elvinia was about to cast out the Great Sanskrit Light, the Civilization Artifact flying in the air suddenly stopped.
<br><br>
"Stop!" The voice of the Regal Jade Spirit boomed, echoing in the air. It didn't say to the black monkeys and the one-eyed monsters, but Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia, however, didn't listen.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen reached out and grabbed Elvinia's hand, just in the nick of time. "Hold on," he said.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit was well aware of the terrifying power of a purified being in the Dark Region. An ordinary ray of light could even cause the Regal Jade City full of bumps and hollows. The Great Sanskrit Light could directly melt down a portion of it! Despite the fact that the Regal Jade City had the power to repair itself, it still would've taken a lot of energy to do so.
<br><br>
Naturally, the Regal Jade Spirit was quite anxious.
<br><br>
The black monkeys and one-eye monsters were stunned. Of course, they never expected the Civilization Artifact would have its own consciousness.
<br><br>
"Who gave you the right to steal from the Regal Jade City?"
<br><br>
The dignified voice of the Regal Jade Spirit boomed again.
<br><br>
The black monkeys and one-eyed monsters, of course, knew that the Regal Jade City wasn't a place to be trifled with. However, they still scrambled to their feet in an attempt to snatch something.
<br><br>
Just as the Regal Jade Spirit finished speaking, the entire Regal Jade City seemed to come to life.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
Suddenly, various jade creatures emerged from the Regal Jade City---from Regal Jade Bugs to Regal Jade Beasts, among many others.
<br><br>
Each of these creatures was a force to be reckoned with. A single Regal Jade Beast had almost killed all the pig-faced monsters and even ate up the octopuses, which didn't have any predators within the Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
But now, hundreds of thousands of them suddenly emerged.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the two black monkeys and the one-eyed monsters were devoured by the swarm of jade creatures.
<br><br>
Even Zen felt fear as he watched the city suddenly come to life with formidable beasts. Elvinia, on the other hand, watched fearlessly.
<br><br>
After all, no matter how many jade creatures came for her, she could destroy them all with just a single beam of light.
<br><br>
After finishing off the creatures from the Dark Region, those jade creatures glanced at Zen indifferently, and then melted back into the Regal Jade City, as though nothing happened.
<br><br>
As soon as they had settled back into their original places, Zen approached the Civilization Artifact and picked it up. "Didn't you say that all the members of your race have fallen into a deep sleep?"
<br><br>
"Hump... They are not qualified to be regarded as my members," the Regal Jade Spirit said indifferently.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit, after all, was once the Son of Truth---a Chaos Ancient God! Those it regarded as members of its race must have been masters of the chaos.
<br><br>
Zen once again tucked away the Civilization Artifact into Elvinia's space ring, and together, they headed out. The two of them were walking along the road to the outside of the Regal Jade City, when suddenly, the ground beneath their feet began to tremble.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
The huge Regal Jade City began to sink, and the black soil started flowing towards the center. Meanwhile, the black mud flowed back, forming a large, black pool.
<br><br>
Chapter 3325 Expecting The creatures of the Dark Region were all in a cold sweat after seeing how the black monkeys and one-eyed monsters ended up.
<br><br>
They had planned to risk everything to rush into the Regal Jade City.
<br><br>
But these creatures were not as powerful as the black monkeys or the oneeyed monsters. They couldn't just head inside, knowing how defenseless they were. All they could do now was to watch Zen and Elvinia leave.
<br><br>
A single purified being was enough to defeat them, so they didn't dare chase after the two.
<br><br>
The Dark Region covered most of the Stage Thirteen area, with the extremely vast inner space.
<br><br>
Initially, Zen thought about heading back along the mountain stream.
<br><br>
But when Zen and Elvinia were chased by the black monkeys, they ran in a panic. After Elvinia destroyed a part of the mountain stream, they couldn't find the path they followed earlier.
<br><br>
As a purified being, Elvinia could travel through the Dark Region safely. So long as she moved in one direction throughout, she would find her way out of there.
<br><br>
After climbing over a small hill, Zen felt the darkness around him growing heavier. The Darkness Fruit's effect was about to wear off.
<br><br>
"Elvinia, give me a Darkness Fruit," Zen called out to her.
<br><br>
Instead of doing so, Elvinia waved her hand, making a ray of light envelop his head. With a smile, she said, "You won't need any more of that fruit with this."
<br><br>
The area the light covered was equal to the outside of the Dark Region. As it turned out, it was true that he didn't need to take the Darkness Fruit.
<br><br>
"Is it convenient?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
To be on the safe side, it was still better to take the Darkness Fruit.
<br><br>
But Elvinia snorted and uttered, "If you don't want it, just leave by yourself!"
<br><br>
He gave her a helpless look in response to her childish outburst.
<br><br>
Although Elvinia was clearly a little mad, she was still less aloof than she used to be. She was even rather cute.
<br><br>
The two rays of light slowly moved in the Dark Region. Wherever they went, they enveloped anything under them, looking like sharp knives forcefully digging ditches into the ground.
<br><br>
The plants in the Dark Region disappeared instantly under the light.
<br><br>
The creatures of the Dark Region were shocked at the scene, so they hid themselves carefully and didn't dare breathe.
<br><br>
They didn't dare bother Zen and Elvinia. If they did, they would surely be killed once the light touched them.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't tell what kind of road they had chosen. After walking for over four hours, all he could see around him were uneven hills and mountains.
<br><br>
When they came across the higher mountains, Elvinia didn't bother climbing over them. Instead, she let the light pierce right through the mountains, creating a cave at their foot. Hence, their journey went smoothly.
<br><br>
The area grew more desolate as the two moved forward. Finally, they reached a great mountain standing at the boundary between the Other Shore and the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Perhaps because of having stayed in the Dark Region for long, Zen felt that the light from outside seemed all too dazzling, even under the cover of Elvinia's light.
<br><br>
"Eh? Is it... the Grand Sky Temple?" Standing atop the mountain, Zen saw something...
<br><br>
It was the facade to the Grand Sky Temple! Having reached that point meant that they had traveled such a long way and ended up coming out from the other side of the Dark Region. Even after all the wrong turns they made, they finally found their way out.
<br><br>
But right before leaving the Dark Region, Zen felt somewhat conflicted.
<br><br>
Everything there was afraid of light as they were incompatible with it—they couldn't dream of existing in the light.
<br><br>
Even the strong Regal Jade would melt like ice and snow in summer if it had to stay in the light. But because the Regal Jade was tougher and more solid than the rest, it melted relatively slowly—Elvinia had left many traces in the Regal Jade City.
<br><br>
Although the Civilization Artifact could withstand the light Elvinia had released, it would perish under the light outside the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Stopping for a moment, Zen took out the Civilization Artifact and expressed his confusion to the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
In response, the Regal Jade Spirit uttered a single word, "Candle."
<br><br>
The creatures of the Dark Region were hoping to obtain candles. On the one hand, they still wanted the light, and on the other, the candle served as the bridge between the Dark Region and the outside world.
<br><br>
If Zen wanted to fuse with the Civilization Artifact, his soul needed to enter the Dark Region with the lighted candle—fusing with the Other Shore Tokens of the Dark Region required a dark environment.
<br><br>
"But... If I fuse with the Other Shore Token of the Dark Region and put it in my inner world, won't my inner world's light make it vanish without a trace?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit smiled faintly in response. "Light is a form of energy.
<br><br>
Even the light of the Source World isn't at the high energy level or powerful enough to eliminate the Other Shore Token of the Dark Region, let alone your inner world's light."
<br><br>
"So that's it..." Zen nodded, a realization coming to him.
<br><br>
It was not the first time he had heard of the energy level. In the divine land, the energy he had released with the Truth Crystal had broken Nicholas' fatal strike, ending up in his defeat. The Truth Crystal's energy level was way too high.
<br><br>
In front of the Grand Sky Temple's main gate, a large crowd of Souls of Light were gathered.
<br><br>
The last time the Ear Mice explored the Grand Sky Temple, they had lost quite a lot. Now, they didn't even bother holding the auction.
<br><br>
This time, the members of the Bearing race intended to open the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
During the last conflict between Zen and the Bearing race, the latter lost several elites. They also lost the qualifications to enter the Grand Sky Temple. In the end, it turned out they escaped the dangers along with the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race and the New Moon race.
<br><br>
Now, it was time for them to stage a comeback.
<br><br>
"Apart from the Souls of Light of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the New Moon race and the Sun Crow race, everyone must leave, now! Hurry up!" one of the members of the Bearing race shouted. Dozens of people laid the Soul Binding Threads on the ground nearby.
<br><br>
The Soul Binding Threads covered the ground, looking like shiny blue grass.
<br><br>
This time, there weren't many super forces taking part in the opening of the Grand Sky Temple. The Separate Abyss race suffered great losses along with other powerful forces last time. Even though the ferocious Grand Sky Temple was tempting, not just anyone could explore it.
<br><br>
Most of those gathered at the main gate of the Grand Sky Temple were the Souls of Light from small races.
<br><br>
On the hillside opposite the Grand Sky Temple sat Dorothy, looking at the gate.
<br><br>
She had waited like this for a long time.
<br><br>
There were moments she saw Zen emerging from the temple, but she knew she was only imagining it as the door remained closed.
<br><br>
This time, the Bearing race managed to obtain the Other Shore Key of the Grand Sky Temple. If they opened the door, would Zen jump out from the temple? Chapter 3326 She Was Spotted Although Dorothy knew that her wish was unrealistic and that there was a great possibility that she was waiting for nothing, she still chose to wait.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, members of the Bearing race continuously arranged the Soul Binding Threads, and soon they reached the hillside.
<br><br>
One of them glanced at Dorothy and remarked, "You have no business here! You should leave right now. If you get stuck to the Soul Binding Threads, we won't help you!"
<br><br>
Dorothy looked up at him and faintly replied, "It's just to open the door of the Grand Sky Temple. What's the big deal? Even the Ear Mice didn't take precautions like that."
<br><br>
Previously, when the Ear Mouse race opened the Grand Sky Temple's door, they only sprayed some Soul Interdicting Water and then arranged a few restrictions. But now, the Bearing race was making a mountain out of a molehill.
<br><br>
"Humph! Enough nonsense! Leave now, or we won't be so kind!" A man from the Bearing race warned her moodily.
<br><br>
It would be troublesome too if she got stuck to the Soul Binding Threads, as that would make it difficult for her to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
At that moment, Dorothy's heart was filled with resentment, but she couldn't do anything because they outnumbered her. She was too wise to confront them where she would obviously lose, so she reluctantly stood up and prepared to leave.
<br><br>
This time, Dorothy chose to make a concession. Usually, Souls of Light would go their ways and would avoid interfering with others. After all, it was difficult to identify Souls of Light on the Other Shore, as they were all blurred in appearances.
<br><br>
But one man from the Bearing race had been observing Dorothy from head to toe. And when their eyes met, a glimmer of light flashed across his eyes.
<br><br>
The day that the Ear Mice opened the door of the Grand Sky Temple, that man had also been present. He had seen Dorothy, as she fought with Haider and spent most of her time with Zen.
<br><br>
Although he hadn't seen Dorothy's appearance before, he was sure that it was her, as she had the same figure, soul aura, and voice! In the battle outside the Grand Sky Temple, the Bearing race had fought with the Oneness Sky Palace, and even before that, they had already fought against each other several times on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
When the Bearing race noticed the strong corporeal body of Zen, they began to make plans to end his life.
<br><br>
They were confident that although Zen's body seemed invincible, and even if he had an upper hand against the Souls of Light, they could still find a way to deal with him.
<br><br>
However, Zen never came back after he entered the Dark Region. And so, the Bearing race had no choice but to sit tight and wait for their chance.
<br><br>
Of course, it would be great if Zen had died in the Dark Region, but in case he returned from the Grand Sky Temple, the Bearing race was wellprepared for him. They were confident that the second he came back, would be the second he would die.
<br><br>
Of course, the man from the Bearing race had noticed that this woman in front of him was always following Zen's physical body.
<br><br>
So now, when he saw that she was about to leave, he called out impulsively.
<br><br>
"Wait!"
<br><br>
Dorothy stopped short and turned to him curiously. "What's up?" she asked.
<br><br>
As Zen had been trapped in the Dark Region, Dorothy had been dazed. She didn't notice that the man had realized who she was.
<br><br>
Swish! Dorothy had barely finished speaking when a handful of blue Soul Binding Threads engulfed her until she was completely covered.
<br><br>
She looked down in alarm and saw the Soul Binding Threads that were stuck to her body. Her face immediately contorted in anger, and she screamed, "What do you mean by this?"
<br><br>
On the Other Shore, the acts of throwing things like the Soul Restraining Sand, the Soul Interdicting Water, and the Soul Binding Thread to others were seen as a declaration of war. She racked her brains for reasons why this man was going after her, wondering if she had offended any member of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
But even the rest of the Bearing race had no idea what was going on, so they were also standing around, shocked and confused. As far as they were concerned, their companion shouldn't be stirring trouble, as they were at the crucial moment before the door of the Grand Sky Temple opened.
<br><br>
The man suddenly shouted, "She is from the Oneness Sky Palace! The one that always followed the corporeal body! Hurry and catch her!" All the people around them turned to look at Dorothy, who stared back at them, eyes wide in shock and horror.
<br><br>
The Bearing race was already planning to deal with the corporeal body, so when the members heard their companion's shout, they immediately understood what they should do.
<br><br>
It didn't matter that it was difficult to determine who she was on the Other Shore. Their companion was much more trustworthy than a woman they didn't know.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Dorothy was also shocked that she was recognized by that unremarkable Soul of Light.
<br><br>
In a panic, she took a few steps backward and stuttered, "I...I'm not from the Oneness Sky Palace... "
<br><br>
Her hesitant answer and obvious intention to run away aroused more suspicion from the other members of the Bearing race. They immediately surrounded her, which effectively blocked all her escape routes.
<br><br>
"If you're not from the Oneness Sky Palace, you could just explain. Why are you trying to escape?" the man from the Bearing race asked ominously.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
The people from the Bearing race suddenly joined hands and formed a huge soul net, enough to cover Dorothy's head.
<br><br>
Dorothy knew that it would be more troublesome if she was caught by these people.
<br><br>
She stepped back slowly, subtly trying to retreat, but the huge soul net was dashing to her. She gritted her teeth in distress, and the Necklace of Mystic Soul that had been hidden under her clothes suddenly appeared.
<br><br>
It vibrated strongly, and a small soul sword slashed straight toward the soul net and cut through it with a swish of air. At the same time, Dorothy's Soul of Light twisted and punched out from the crack.
<br><br>
"That's the soul sword!"
<br><br>
"She used it to deal with Haider!"
<br><br>
"Don't let her run away! She has been bound by my Soul Binding Thread!"
<br><br>
As soon as she pulled out the sword, several people of the Bearing race shouted in alarm and recognition. They chased her with renewed vigor, and at that moment, she thought that she could never escape.
<br><br>
They would never give up and let her go, and that thought discouraged her greatly.
<br><br>
She cursed her luck quietly. She just wanted to wait for Zen there, but the Bearing race recognized her. What bad luck! However, Dorothy had the Necklace of Mystic Soul. It was an extremely powerful weapon that could aid in her escape, so as she fled, she activated her soul sword to counterattack.
<br><br>
This sword contained astonishingly sharp energy. And the Souls of Light of the Bearing race were well-aware of its terrifying strength, so they kept their distance from it warily.
<br><br>
Dorothy ran west and all the way down the hill, while more and more members of the Bearing race chased after her. There were even members of the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race that were following her.
<br><br>
These Souls of Light had all reached the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm, so their cultivation was not much inferior to Dorothy's. They chased after her wherever she went, without the slightest intention of giving up.
<br><br>
Dorothy cursed once again in her mind. At this rate, she would be caught sooner or later.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter who you are, just surrender! Don't waste our time!"
<br><br>
"We just want the body! If you help us catch the guy, we will let you go!"
<br><br>
"You know you can't escape. Why don't you make this easier for yourself and surrender?"
<br><br>
Dorothy snorted at all the voices, then she taunted them confidently, "Let's see if you can catch me!"
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Three small soul swords shot out from her Necklace of Mystic Soul, and they flew towards the Souls of Light at an incredible speed, leaving white trails in the air.
<br><br>
The two Souls of Light of the Bearing race who had been talking to her were right on her heels. And because they were so close, they had no time to dodge the soul swords. Before they could scream, the small soul swords pierced them, and they were severely injured.
<br><br>
"She is so strong!"
<br><br>
"Be careful!"
<br><br>
The scene shocked the other members of the Bearing race so greatly that some of them couldn't even talk.
<br><br>
Instead, soundless gasps escaped their mouths, as they witnessed their members getting hurt.
<br><br>
They were right to be surprised, as Dorothy's Soul of Light had already surpassed her peers. She had been able to compete with the top Souls of Light in the thirteenth stage with the help of the Necklace of Mystic Soul.
<br><br>
But although they were frightened by her power, none of them retreated.
<br><br>
They stood their ground, confident that they were stronger because they outnumbered her. Thus, they persevered and trailed her.
<br><br>
Chapter 3327 Into The Dark Region Dorothy continuously activated the Necklace of Mystic Soul, forcing it to its maximum power, as she retreated.
<br><br>
She was heading towards the opposite direction from the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple. Up ahead, the Dark Region waited for her.
<br><br>
Even though she knew she would die once she reached the Dark Region, right now, she had no choice but to keep running.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! She heard the little soul swords slashing from behind her. Suddenly, a clanging noise wrung through the air.
<br><br>
Dorothy, startled at the noise, turned to look over her shoulder.
<br><br>
To her surprise, a shining golden hand firmly held the blade of one of the soul swords.
<br><br>
"The Golden Body race?" Dorothy felt her heart sink.
<br><br>
While there were many native races in these thirteen stages on the Other Shore, the Golden Body race was one of the most powerful.
<br><br>
The Golden Body race looked very similar to the human race in both figure and height.
<br><br>
However, the main difference was that their bodies were made of pure, luminescent gold. Consequently, they were much more powerful than other ordinary creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
To Dorothy's despair, the man from the Golden Body race had actually stopped her soul sword with his bare hand.
<br><br>
Clap! With little effort, the man of gold crushed the soul sword. Then, in a strange, tinny voice, he said, "Young human girl, you'd better stop resisting.
<br><br>
I don't want to make things difficult for you, but we have agreed to help the Bearing race."
<br><br>
From behind the man, Dorothy could see dozens more of the Golden Body race standing calmly.
<br><br>
Dorothy's mind whirled. She was alone. Even all the Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace in Stage Thirteen couldn't defeat so many creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Even now, Dorothy was not concerned about her own safety. Desperately, she summoned another soul sword from the Necklace of Mystic Soul.
<br><br>
She had reached her limit at this point.
<br><br>
"Why did you agree to help the Bearing race?" Dorothy asked coldly, trying to buy some time.
<br><br>
To persuade an entire race from the Other Shore to help another race, the reward must have been precious. However, it should've been impossible for the Bearing race to be willing to pay such a high price just to deal with a little girl like Dorothy.
<br><br>
"They have promised us great profits." The man smiled.
<br><br>
"They have to hire people to deal with me?" Dorothy taunted through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
"You?" The man sneered. "You flatter yourself. Why would we bother ourselves to deal with one pathetic Soul of Light?"
<br><br>
"Ajay, quit talking nonsense with her!"
<br><br>
"Just take her down!"
<br><br>
"That man will definitely come to us once he hears the news. You don't need to wait here!"
<br><br>
the people from the Bearing race said one after the other.
<br><br>
At this point, Dorothy understood everything.
<br><br>
Zen had destroyed the temple of the Bearing race, snatched their soul crystal, and even killed Haider at the gate of the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Naturally, the Bearing race wanted revenge. They wanted to kill Zen.
<br><br>
However, they were too weak to face Zen upfront. They wanted the Oneness Sky Palace to hand Zen over, but the Oneness Sky Palace refused to admit that Zen was one of them.
<br><br>
With no evidence, the Bearing race was at a loss. They couldn't set themselves against the Oneness Sky Palace because of Zen. Too many things were involved, and they hadn't been well prepared.
<br><br>
Therefore, they resorted to having creatures from the Other Shore do the dirty work for them. That would explain why the mighty Golden Body race was helping them.
<br><br>
The golden man who went by Ajay stopped the chitchat. Instead, he bolted towards Dorothy.
<br><br>
Dorothy bit her lip. She knew she wouldn't be able to face Ajay head on.
<br><br>
She couldn't even face the Abyss Spirit race back in Stage Eleven, let alone a mighty creature from Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The three soul swords shot towards Ajay.
<br><br>
However, Ajay didn't even flinch. He stretched out his hand, and swatted the soul swords away, as though they were just annoying flies.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
Ajay chuckled. The swords barely even slowed him down; in fact, to Dorothy's horror, it seemed he picked up his speed.
<br><br>
Without further hesitation, she whipped around and fled towards the darkness.
<br><br>
She was now very close to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The Dark Region was a dangerous place for the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Even as she approached the border of the Dark Region, she felt fear welling within her.
<br><br>
"Candles... If only I had some candles!"
<br><br>
She could've temporarily hidden in the Dark Region, if only she had candles.
<br><br>
But when the three-eyed boy let her go, she had given all the candles to Elvinia, who stored them in her space ring.
<br><br>
Now, the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race guarded the Dark Region from both sides. Behind her, the Golden Body race was steadily closing in.
<br><br>
Just as she was only a few steps away from the Dark Region, she abruptly stopped.
<br><br>
"Young human girl, don't take another step," Ajay called. "The Dark Region is very dangerous."
<br><br>
Creatures on the Other Shore were forbidden from entering the Dark Region, too. The creatures from the Light Region were completely different from those of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Dorothy apprehensively took a few steps backward. As she got closer to the Dark Region, she also felt increasingly desperate.
<br><br>
She knew that Zen was still alive, so she still held onto a glimmer of hope.
<br><br>
However, if she was caught by them, they were bound to use her as bait to lure Zen out. If Zen managed to get out of the Dark Region, he'd have to face numerous opponents all at once, all because of her.
<br><br>
'What should I do?' Dorothy turned around, facing her chasers.
<br><br>
Ever since she met Zen, she had encountered many dangers on the Other Shore. However, each time, Zen had saved her. This time, now that he wasn't by her side, she knew she didn't stand a chance.
<br><br>
"Young girl, don't step back. You'd die," said Ajay. "Don't worry. You won't die at our hands!"
<br><br>
After all, their goal was only to hold Dorothy as hostage till Zen showed up.
<br><br>
They needed her alive.
<br><br>
"But I'm afraid that I'll suffer bitterly," Dorothy retorted, shaking her head.
<br><br>
As she spoke, she took another step backward, toward the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Are you sure about that?"
<br><br>
Ajay laughed. While Dorothy had been lost in her thoughts, he suddenly closed the distance and grabbed her by the arm. Dorothy snapped back to reality. 'Huh? Wasn't he still a few steps away from me?' Dorothy panicked. How could she have been so stupid! Suddenly, a white light flashed from the Dark Region. A hand reached out from the light and grabbed Dorothy, yanking her into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Phew! Ajay jumped back in surprise, letting go of Dorothy. He broke out a cold sweat.
<br><br>
"Damn it!" he cursed.
<br><br>
The others behind him shook their heads in disappointment. They never expected that this young woman from the Oneness Sky Palace would be so fiercely determined. They couldn't believe she was willing to run into the Dark Region just to escape their clutches.
<br><br>
Chapter 3328 Leaving The Dark Region "What was that white light just now?" a Soul of Light from the Bearing race inquired in visible confusion.
<br><br>
When Dorothy fell into the Dark Region, they had all witnessed a strong flash of light appear before their eyes. It was rather unusual to experience such a light in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Even though Ajay was from the Other Shore, he didn't know the answer to this question. They didn't know much more about the Dark Region than the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
"I have no clue," Ajay replied as he laughed spitefully. "Since that little girl is dead, all we can do is wait. If that physical body is still alive, it will appear sooner or later!"
<br><br>
Ajay said as he clenched his fists with a vicious fighting spirit fuming in his eyes.
<br><br>
The Bearing race was willing to offer such a high reward that even the Golden Body race was unable to refuse. On the other hand, the description they gave of that strong body piqued Ajay's interest. The Golden Body race was easily tempted by the thought of battling different mighty warriors, and Ajay was no exception.
<br><br>
Enveloped in the white light, Dorothy sat stunned on the ground. She was convinced she had not survived the fall.
<br><br>
She didn't even understand how she was dragged into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Recalling back to what had just happened to her, she remembered taking a step back before she was wrapped in the rays of white light.
<br><br>
Staring at the pure white light, Dorothy kept herself composed. "Why didn't I feel any pain when I died..."
<br><br>
As she looked more closely, she noticed a person emerge from the white light. It was hard to make out the appearance under the influence of the overwhelming light. Even so, in a single glance, she had recognized him to be Zen. Accompanying Zen on the Other Shore for such a long time, she had kept his image in her mind. She could never mistake him to be someone else! But she kept her emotions in check even at the sight of Zen. She had heard that people would often hallucinate things that didn't exist in reality after they died. Maybe she missed Zen too much for her to see him in front of her like this.
<br><br>
"Still in a daze, huh?" Zen chuckled as he walked up to Dorothy, with a sweet smile smeared across his face. He waved his hands in front of her jokingly.
<br><br>
"What?" Dorothy was muddled. At this moment, she noticed Elvinia standing beside Zen.
<br><br>
Instinctively her brows arched up in confusion.
<br><br>
Why would she hallucinate Elvinia, even though she only had Zen on her mind? Moreover, she was able to see Elvinia's face as clear as day.
<br><br>
She wasn't on good terms with Elvinia, then why was it that she hallucinated her of all people? "Zen, is she stupid?" Elvinia asked as she giggled while glancing at Dorothy's puzzled expression.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Dorothy snapped out of her confusion and retaliated, "You're the fool!"
<br><br>
Dorothy was not inferior to Elvinia in any aspect when alive. And now that she was convinced she was dead, she wasn't going to hold her words back either. It fumed her how even now, this hateful woman had the guts to mock her.
<br><br>
"How dare you!" Suddenly, Elvinia's face darkened as anger reflected from her expression. She gave her fingers a turn, and the white light surrounding Dorothy began to disperse.
<br><br>
Considering her child-like tendencies, she showed no concern for other people's lives.
<br><br>
If the white light were to disappear completely, Dorothy would be swallowed by the darkness and eventually die.
<br><br>
"Stop that right now," Zen said in a brusque tone.
<br><br>
Taking notice of Zen's disappointment, Elvinia stopped immediately. She eyed Dorothy up with dissatisfaction as she pouted.
<br><br>
Though her memory was impaired, she instinctively didn't like Dorothy.
<br><br>
"Don't be confused. You're not dead. You just fell into the Dark Region,"
<br><br>
Zen said as he offered his hand out to help her stand up.
<br><br>
Dorothy stood up and began to scan her surroundings, still in a daze.
<br><br>
Everything was so overwhelming for her that she took her time to process it all in her head before she spoke, "Am I really alive? Zen, Elvinia, are you two okay?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded and gave her a warm smile. "Don't worry. I was the one who drew you into the Dark Region."
<br><br>
Stumbling upon Dorothy was really a coincidence.
<br><br>
Zen had taken a long journey in the darkness before he saw the front of the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Previously, he had been consulting the Regal Jade Spirit about how to fuse with the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
Just as he was putting away the Civilization Artifact, he had noticed a human Soul of Light being chased by other human Souls of Light along with creatures from the Other Shore! It was hard for Zen to make out who it was while in the Dark Region. Even so, he was alerted when he noticed the birds from the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Since the Sun Crow race always followed the Bearing race, he instantly concluded those human Souls of Light who chased behind were of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race. No matter who it was that they were chasing, Zen had to intervene and foil their plans.
<br><br>
In fact, Zen's theory was proven correct when he and Elvinia followed after the human Soul of Light only to find out that it was Dorothy! Quickly, they stationed themselves behind her.
<br><br>
To make sure she was safe, he had pulled Dorothy in from the Light Region.
<br><br>
After Zen briefed her about everything, Dorothy still stood stunned for a fair amount of time. She still found it hard to believe his words and said, "But... You… How can you roam the Dark Region so freely? And this light doesn't seem like it's coming from the candles!"
<br><br>
From what Dorothy had known, they could only rely on the light coming from the candles to move through the Dark Region. At this moment, three rays of light simultaneously shot out from above their heads and wrapped itself around Zen and Elvinia. Such a technique was truly remarkable to watch! Zen glanced at Elvinia's profile and smiled. "It's Elvinia's ability."
<br><br>
"Her ability? No, it can't be." Dorothy stared at Elvinia with her mouth agape. "And she has a physical body? This... This is incredible."
<br><br>
Elvinia now had a body in the Dark Region. Anyone could easily see her face and every feature except for the clothes she wore that were woven by rays of light.
<br><br>
Dorothy couldn't process everything in one go. All this new information was too overwhelming for her.
<br><br>
The matter involving the purified beings was too hard to explain at once.
<br><br>
Zen didn't want to clarify everything to Dorothy just standing there. He gestured to her and said, "Come on. Let's get out of here. I think it's time to pay back those who chased you with interest."
<br><br>
"No, stop!" Dorothy immediately reached out to Zen and stopped him in his tracks. "They're from the Golden Body race. They are one of the strongest races of Stage Thirteen, far more powerful than the Abyss Spirit race! They were hired by the Bearing race to hunt and kill you!"
<br><br>
"Are they really that strong?" Zen raised his brows, seemingly unfazed by her description.
<br><br>
"Yes, they are!" Dorothy nodded frantically to make him take the situation seriously.
<br><br>
Previously, she had been worried about how she would be able to reach Zen in time to let him know about them. She had never thought she'd be able to meet him in the Dark Region. It all felt like a dream to her.
<br><br>
Since Zen was capable of moving freely in the Dark Region, he could leave it when he wished too.
<br><br>
Even after all her attempts to persuade him to stay, they were to no avail.
<br><br>
Zen looked back at her and sneered confidently. "I'd like to witness this power for myself."
<br><br>
As he finished his words, he took a step out of the Dark Region. Just like before, a ray of white light flashed through the darkness, and Zen had already made his way out of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Outside, Ajay had no interest to stay and study the white light. He turned to the members of his race and asked them to leave with him. Meanwhile, the Souls of Light of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were engrossed in a heated discussion on what the light indicated.
<br><br>
The white light didn't disappear. They were still able to make out a faintly visible white shadow through the darkness, but they failed to figure out what it was supposed to be.
<br><br>
At this moment, the white light became brighter and brighter with time.
<br><br>
Suddenly, they all saw a person emerging from it.
<br><br>
The human Souls of Light that stood fascinated by the view, were left shocked. They yelled in confusion and started to retreat frantically.
<br><br>
With confident steps, the person approached them and said with a smirk across his face, "I heard that you were waiting for me in front of the Grand Sky Temple?"
<br><br>
Ajay, who was preparing to leave, turned his head when he heard the voice from behind. As soon as his gaze fell on Zen's physical body, he was unable to take his eyes off of him. He tilted his head and began to study it carefully.
<br><br>
Human...
<br><br>
Blurry face...
<br><br>
An aura that was different from that of the Souls of Light...
<br><br>
Ajay immediately believed this person to be the corporeal body the Bearing race had told him about! Chapter 3329 The Limit Of The Light Region "It's him!"
<br><br>
"He's actually escaped the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
"Back off!"
<br><br>
Zen's physical power was no secret to the members of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
He'd even bested the mighty Haider. Zen smashed the man into dust when he hit him. His foe was not strong enough to defend himself.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light were like ants to Zen. He could squash them underfoot without half a thought. They were too weak to stand a chance against him.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light retreated one after another, while the members of the Golden Body race, led by Ajay, came forward.
<br><br>
"Not them," said Ajay, looking at the fleeing Souls of Light in disdain. "It's me that was waiting for you."
<br><br>
Zen looked at Ajay. The Golden Body race was truly worthy of its reputation. Ajay's body was made of gold, and it was obviously extremely strong.
<br><br>
"I have no quarrel with you. If this is about the Bearing race, you might want to rethink this. You can't defeat me," Zen said in a low growl.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..." Ajay rested his chin in his hand, and his grin became even wider. "So arrogant. I'm from the Other Shore, and outsiders aren't even worth mentioning in my eyes. You're doomed!"
<br><br>
With that, he suddenly stretched out his arms, and the muscles rippled under the pure gold. A powerful aura emanated from the figure.
<br><br>
When the other members of the Golden Body race saw this, as one they all let out a deafening cheer.
<br><br>
They were going to hang back. Ajay could defeat Zen all on his own. He didn't need their help.
<br><br>
Sensing Ajay's strong aura, Zen soothed his soul and remained calm. He smiled and said, "Actually, I have a question."
<br><br>
Ajay stared at Zen and asked, "Oh really? And what might that be?"
<br><br>
"If you are willing to become an Other Shore Token, how much Other Shore Power can you release?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
A living creature could also become an Other Shore Token. No doubt, they were much stronger than ordinary Other Shore Tokens. But those tokens would lose their freedom. They had to work for their owners. That was absolutely humiliating.
<br><br>
When the Wild Gods found the Other Shore, they often enslaved the inhabitants, like the Golden Body race, and made them into Other Shore Tokens. But the denizens of the Other Shore had become more powerful since then, so only the weakest of them could be enslaved that way.
<br><br>
Ajay's face darkened at Zen's question. He clenched his fists and said angrily, "You will know after our fight!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Ajay stomped his foot, making a loud sound. The ground cracked and split open. A golden vortex encircled his fist. He swung at Zen.
<br><br>
"Okay, I admit it. You're not weak," Zen said as he raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>
Since the Bearing race wanted him dealt with, they concocted a thorough plan. They were sure that the Golden Body race could help them achieve their goal.
<br><br>
Seeing that the golden vortex punch was aimed straight at him, Zen quickly thought of the best course of action. As his right leg thrust out, his body tilted forward. In this way, he skillfully avoided the punch. When he stood up straight again, he grabbed Ajay's neck with one hand and lifted him up.
<br><br>
Bang! Then, he released him. As Zen turned his back, Ajay fell to the ground hard.
<br><br>
The impact caused the ground to recess, and a pit was formed. In the middle of it lay Ajay.
<br><br>
Zen stood at the edge of the pit and waved his index finger at Ajay. He pointed at the Dark Region and said, "Consider it as I've already killed you once. Since you had the courage to challenge me alone, I'll grant you an extra life."
<br><br>
Zen stood on the precipice of the Dark Region. He could easily throw Ajay into the Dark Region just now, but decided against it.
<br><br>
No matter what, they made it a fair fight. The other members of the Golden Body race could have jumped him, but they didn't, so he spared them.
<br><br>
But Zen's sense of fair play only incensed Ajay. To be beaten and spared was an even greater dishonor for a warrior of the Golden Body race. He didn't want Zen to go easy on him, even if it meant death.
<br><br>
"Ahhhhh!"
<br><br>
Ajay roared as he leapt to his feet. He used the power of his aura to leave the pit and rose in the air. He landed near Zen.
<br><br>
He roared, reciting a series of mysterious, ancient words. The golden vortex surrounding his fists became even brighter and more powerful, and his body was faintly shrouded by the shadow of a golden hammer.
<br><br>
This golden hammer was extraordinary. It used to be the most powerful weapon when the Golden Body race was at the height of its power. Not only that, it was intelligent. It was not only a supreme master of the Golden Body race, but an object of worship for that race.
<br><br>
A look of surprise appeared in Zen's eyes when he felt Ajay's power increase. To face it head-on would end bad. He used his footwork to quickly retreat.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Ajay kept throwing punches, but Zen managed to dodge each one. Every time, Ajay's fists struck the ground, and it cracked under the mighty impact.
<br><br>
It was now quite treacherous in that region, and one wrong move would send a man sprawling into a mighty chasm.
<br><br>
The Golden Body race was indeed more powerful than the Abyss Spirit race from Stage Eleven, but their power was limited.
<br><br>
Ajay should be one of the best of the Golden Body race, but he could only release 600 to 700 divine megatons of force. Such a force was strong enough to deal with the Souls of Light, but it was not even remotely powerful enough to defeat Zen.
<br><br>
Zen did a quick calculation. The ultimate power of the Light Region of Stage Thirteen on the Other Shore should be under 1, 000 divine megatons, while the power of the strongest warriors should be nearly 1, 000 divine megatons.
<br><br>
By comparison, the Dark Region was much more terrifying.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy and the huge ape could unleash thousands of divine megatons of force. Ajay was about as powerful as a black monkey. Besides, there were octopuses and Regal Jade creatures.
<br><br>
Ajay attacked continuously, extending the battleground by at least a thousand feet, as Zen kept retreating.
<br><br>
"Roar! Roar! Roar!"
<br><br>
"Why do you keep avoiding him? Retreat is not an option for a warrior!"
<br><br>
"Coward!"
<br><br>
The members of the Golden Body race cheered Ajay and mocked Zen.
<br><br>
They thought if Ajay hit Zen, his terrifying power would mash him into a puddle of goo. But Zen was so quick that Ajay couldn't harm a hair on his head.
<br><br>
"Hey, guys! Why don't you gang up on him?"
<br><br>
"You promised our race, don't you remember?"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Watching the battle, the people of the Bearing race grew quite anxious.
<br><br>
They felt that it was too difficult for Ajay to take down Zen alone, so there was no need for a fair fight. They'd have their pound of flesh, even if they had to be considered shameful.
<br><br>
However, the members of the Golden Body race were all about integrity and honor, so they didn't care about what the Bearing race suggested.
<br><br>
When there were few places left to stand, Ajay was finally exhausted. He'd cloven away most of the solid ground. He stood and gasped.
<br><br>
Zen grinned and said, "Now it's my turn."
<br><br>
Before Ajay could react, Zen had transformed into a gust of wind and rushed toward him.
<br><br>
Zen was weak in the Dark Region, but in the Light Region, he feared no one.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen flew straight at Ajay. At the last minute, he led with his elbow and struck the warrior full in the chest.
<br><br>
The blow seemed weak, but it was actually massively powerful. Before Ajay could react, he felt a dull pain in his chest and had been flung backward.
<br><br>
Chapter 3330 The Light While Ajay flew backward, Zen followed him, and timed his next punch just right.
<br><br>
Ajay tried to regain his footing, so he could stop himself after being knocked back. But Zen's punch stopped him from doing that. He tried to catch Zen's fist, but Zen altered his fist's trajectory and hit him in the face.
<br><br>
If it were any other creature, this punch would have shattered its skull.
<br><br>
However, Ajay's bone structure was dense. He was fairly powerful, so Zen kept hammering away with his fists.
<br><br>
"Dong!"
<br><br>
"Dong!"
<br><br>
"Dong!"
<br><br>
With three strong punches, Zen smashed Ajay into the big pit at the precipice of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
But the Golden Body race was indeed tough. Even though he'd taken a lot of damage, Ajay's breath control was unaffected. But, no matter. They knew who had won this time. Ajay said dejectedly, "I admit defeat."
<br><br>
Zen looked down at him in the pit and said, "You're not worth the trouble it would take to slay you—I'll spare your life, this time."
<br><br>
A serious look suddenly appeared on Ajay's face. He said, "You are a brave man to defeat me. Makes me sorry I have to do this. I respect you, but I promised the Bearing race you would die."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, a golden bone appeared in his hand. It looked like a rib. Then, without another word, he plunged it into his chest.
<br><br>
"Howl!" A dazzling golden light burst from Ajay's eyes, and his momentum soared once more! So engrossed in what was going on, the members of the Golden Body race took a bit to notice something strange. The six members also held golden bones. They stabbed these bones into their chests and roared. Their momentum went sky high as well.
<br><br>
The Golden Body race was one of the strongest races of Stage Thirteen. Not only did they have the golden hammer, they also had 22 Golden Battle Bones.
<br><br>
Before the chaos where they lived was destroyed, the hammer transformed them, so they all possessed a golden body. The hammer was certain it couldn't escape the disaster, so it disintegrated its body. After that, it sent its arm and leg bones and ribs to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Once the Golden Body race stabbed themselves with the Golden Battle Bone, it would give them great power almost instantly, but only for five minutes. When the power boost wore off, they would die.
<br><br>
Ajay would honor his vow, even if it killed him. He had promised to kill Zen, so he used the Golden Battle Bone to achieve this goal.
<br><br>
This time, though, he had backup. He made a deal with some other members. If he couldn't handle Zen, he would use the Golden Battle Bone.
<br><br>
And the six who followed him would do the same, and gang up on Zen.
<br><br>
Surely he couldn't handle them all! "Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Ajay only had five minutes to live. No matter what, he would kill Zen in this period of time. He jumped up and tried to hit his opponent at an astonishing speed.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened in surprise, but he still dodged to the side almost reflexively. Ajay's punch only grazed him, but left ugly, bleeding slashes where it screamed past him.
<br><br>
Zen narrowly evaded Ajay's attack, but the other six members of the Golden Body race had already surrounded him.
<br><br>
These six were weaker than Ajay, but with the support of the Golden Battle Bones, they could not be underestimated. They could strike with the force of one thousand divine megatons without breaking a sweat.
<br><br>
If Zen used the Shade Stone liquid, he might be able to survive this. But he didn't have it on his corporeal body on the Other Shore. That was why he was noticeably weaker. If one of them landed a blow, he might be gravely wounded. And he faced seven foes. Things were looking grim.
<br><br>
"Haha... Looks like that guy will finally die!"
<br><br>
"We can't fail now! The Golden Body race is indeed trustworthy!"
<br><br>
"I think Ajay can take him now, especially with six of his buddies."
<br><br>
When they saw Ajay lose to Zen, the members of the Bearing race were depressed. If the Golden Body race couldn't take this guy out, then maybe no one on Stage Thirteen could. Was he invincible? They didn't expect things would change in the blink of an eye. And they were happy to see it. Once Zen was killed, they would be able to leave the Other Shore and report this good news to their elders.
<br><br>
In the Dark Region, Dorothy was filled with anxiety.
<br><br>
She wanted to leave the Dark Region and rush to his aid. But Elvinia wouldn't let her. She was trapped there by her circle of light, and Elvinia refused to budge.
<br><br>
"So how do we fix this? Zen may not be able to beat them!" Dorothy said anxiously.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked. "But he said he could handle it on his own!"
<br><br>
Dorothy glared at her. She had a feeling Elvinia was not in her right mind.
<br><br>
Certainly she was different from how she used to be. And now Dorothy had a sinking feeling she was correct in her assessment. Anyone could see that Zen was in danger.
<br><br>
"How? Seven on one? He's going to die!" Dorothy shouted angrily.
<br><br>
Elvinia finally understood what she meant. She raised her eyebrows and repeated, "Going to die..."
<br><br>
This aroused worry for Zen in her heart, and she started walking to the edge of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Hey! Take me with you!" Dorothy yelled hurriedly.
<br><br>
"Take you with me? Why? You seem pretty useless." Elvinia took one last look at Dorothy and rushed out.
<br><br>
Dorothy was in the form of a Soul of Light. She couldn't help Zen in that form. She was no match for any member of the Golden Body race, much less any who had thrust the Golden Battle Bone into their chests.
<br><br>
Members of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Sun Crow race—all Souls of Light themselves—were cheering from a safe distance.
<br><br>
The remaining members of the Golden Body race wore a sad expression.
<br><br>
Seven members of their race were going to die, no matter whether they beat Zen or not.
<br><br>
Just then, they saw a figure walking out of the Dark Region. This person was not the Soul of Light who had previously entered the Dark Region, but another woman.
<br><br>
"Who is she?"
<br><br>
"Is she from the Other Shore? Or the Dark Region? She's a human!"
<br><br>
"What a stunning woman! She's the hottest girl I've ever seen!"
<br><br>
Elvinia was clad in clothes woven of light, her long legs bare. Her delicate features had a touch of innocence. Everyone could feel her aura, an aura of a unique and extraordinary charm.
<br><br>
She drew everyone's gaze. From the Bearing race to the Divine Farmer race. But she was about to stun everyone with what she said next.
<br><br>
Her voice was loud and clear as she addressed Zen. "I'm here to help you!"
<br><br>
When the warriors who were busy surrounding Zen saw Elvinia, their faces darkened. Was this woman a denizen of the Other Shore? Or did she come from the Dark Region? None of those combatants were happy.
<br><br>
Then, everyone saw Elvinia gently wave her finger, and an ethereal voice rang in their ears, saying, "Great Sanskrit Light!"
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A thin light column spread to engulf everything, and the environment turned incandescent. Everyone was blinded by this. Their surroundings, and everything in their vision was a bright white.
<br><br>
When the light dissipated, their vision returned to normal.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light from the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race were still shivering, while those from the Golden Body race looked confused.
<br><br>
The bright light was indeed astonishing, but it did not harm anyone.
<br><br>
That woman shone her light on others.
<br><br>
What kind of theurgy was she using? Chapter 3331 The Power Of The Purified Being The Souls of Light of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and other races eyed each other up from all directions to find that they were not injured by the strike! Although the light gave off an intimidating vibe, it lacked the required potential to cause significant harm.
<br><br>
In a state of confusion, Elvinia stared hard at her palms to make sense of the situation.
<br><br>
"This isn't the Dark Region!" Zen reminded her with a morose expression etched across his face.
<br><br>
The light released by Elvinia was a form of energy. Instead of harming the creatures of the Light Region, it was aimed at the Dark Region. As a result, the beings of the Light Region remained unharmed.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, when Elvinia unleashed her light, Dorothy and the Dark Region were unlucky enough to be caught in the crossfire.
<br><br>
The light made its way behind Elvinia and caused a mountain in the Dark Region to be reduced to dust. Even though Dorothy was under the protection of the light, the mountain below her feet crumpled to the ground and caused her to fall.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the beam of light quickly responded to her predicament. It enveloped her vertically and protected her.
<br><br>
"Is this woman serious, or is she joking with us?"
<br><br>
"Does she really believe she could kill people with her insignificant light? It's laughable."
<br><br>
"Such a waste of a pretty face. She's practically brainless…"
<br><br>
Once they realized Elvinia's attack was powerless against them, they regained their lost vitality and began to taunt her.
<br><br>
Not wanting to give Zen enough time to concoct a strategy, Ajay and the others attempted to launch another attack towards him.
<br><br>
Overhearing all the mockery directed to her, Elvinia tilted her head and asked indifferently, "Brainless?"
<br><br>
As she said this, she made her way towards Zen with a dark shadow hovering over her face. When she was only a few feet away from him, she gently tapped her snow-white feet on the ground. As a result, the ground was unable to withstand her strength and cracked under pressure. At the same time, the speed at which she flew in his direction increased considerably! "Whoosh!"
<br><br>
She became so agile that it was difficult for anyone to read her movements.
<br><br>
Within a split second, she had caught up with the members of the Golden Body race. In an infuriated state, she reached out her hand and grabbed ahold of one of them.
<br><br>
The adrenaline rushed through the body of the Golden Body member due to the stimulation of his Golden Battle Bone, which made him launch numerous frantic attacks at Zen. Suddenly, he felt a bone-chilling touch on his shoulder. As he turned to look, he saw it was Elvinia's hand.
<br><br>
Before he could react, he felt a frightening force coming from her hand. It was so powerful that he couldn't resist it with his Golden Battle Bone. He began to lose consciousness and was directly thrown into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Sizz, sizz..."
<br><br>
The creatures of the Light Region were restricted to enter the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Even though the Golden Body race were proud owners of insanely durable bodies, they would still perish in an instant when exposed to the darkness.
<br><br>
As a result, his hair, bones, and flesh were devoured completely. They manifested themselves into mere black smoke. The only thing that remained to vouch for his existence was the Golden Battle Bone.
<br><br>
Although the Golden Battle Bone was not to be underestimated, it was only a matter of time before it would perish as well. The Golden Battle Bone deteriorated at a slower rate compared to other items. At first, the surface of the bone would turn a charred-black color, and then it would develop bumps across it and break down into pieces. And lastly, the many small pieces of bone would be destroyed and disappear in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
As Elvinia continued her ruthless actions, more and more members of the Golden Body race were thrown off into the Dark Region. Each of them faded away quickly and became a distant memory.
<br><br>
Elvinia was not as forgiving as Zen.
<br><br>
Since she was slow to reinforce, Zen was under siege the entire time. When the sudden realization hit her that these people intended to kill Zen, she was engulfed with fury raging in every fiber of her being. Her only goal was to annihilate all the guys who flashed a golden light.
<br><br>
"The guys from the Golden Body race have such low resistance!"
<br><br>
"I don't think that's the case. This woman is just too strong for them!"
<br><br>
"Damn, this woman is really in a league of her own…"
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of the Bearing race were left dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Initially, they were amused by Elvinia's tenacity to retaliate. However, they never expected her to come out with such formidable strength.
<br><br>
In a blink of an eye, she had tossed six members of the Golden Body race into the Dark Region. Only Ajay remained.
<br><br>
The moment the Golden Battle Bone was pierced through Ajay's flesh, he would only have five minutes before he breathed his last. In the last few moments of his life, he seemed rather calm.
<br><br>
The strength of the human woman that came out of the Dark Region was too overwhelming. Ajay knew there was nothing more he could do, except to accept his defeat. Even if he risked his life, he would still fall short of completing his task.
<br><br>
"Stop. I'll do it myself!" Ajay stared Elvinia in the eye and gestured her to halt her attacks.
<br><br>
The members of the Golden Body race held the Golden Battle Bone with high regard. For so many years, they had only lost one.
<br><br>
However, when Elvinia tossed six of their members into the Dark Region, their Golden Battle Bones could not be retrieved. As a result, they had suffered a loss of six bones in one fell swoop. All members of the Golden Body race fell into a crippling depression. They valued the Golden Battle Bone more than their own lives.
<br><br>
Elvinia glared at Ajay with blood-shot eyes as she yanked Zen behind her.
<br><br>
It was as if she was a hawk protecting a chick.
<br><br>
After Ajay walked over to the edge of the Dark Region, he pulled out the Golden Battle Bone from his body. Then with a swift move, he threw it towards the members of the Golden Body race.
<br><br>
When the Golden Battle Bone was inserted into his body, it fed off of his life force and became a part of him. If it were to be pulled out, he would instantly die. When he disposed of the bone from his body, he had used up all his leftover energy. As a result, he fell backward lifelessly and got consumed by the darkness.
<br><br>
"Where is Dorothy?" Zen glanced in Elvinia's direction and asked.
<br><br>
Elvinia had no concern attached to Dorothy's life. Since Zen was the one who inquired about it, she replied in a casual tone, "Don't worry. She's still breathing."
<br><br>
After she finished her words, Elvinia went into the Dark Region to draw Dorothy out.
<br><br>
Ajay had fallen, and the remaining members of the Golden Body race had given up on the thought of confronting them. With careful hands, they picked up the last surviving Golden Battle Bone and retreated.
<br><br>
"It looks like you haven't learned your lesson after the last time I destroyed the temple of the Bearing race," Zen said with a sullen voice. "Do you want me to go back and destroy your temple once more? Which temple should it be this time... Should it be the Bearing race's, the Divine Farmer race's, or the Sun Crow race's? What do you think about that?"
<br><br>
Initially, when Zen had stayed in Stage Four, he had planned to tear down the temple of the Divine Farmer race. But then he let them go. However, if he were to return to Stage Four, destroying two temples at a time wouldn't pose much of a challenge for him.
<br><br>
The location of the temple of the Sun Crow race was still unknown. But he was convinced he would find it in Stage Four.
<br><br>
Those Souls of Light could retreat from the Other Shore at will. They were in no hurry to run away just yet. After hearing Zen's threat, the Souls of Light shook with fear.
<br><br>
When Zen destroyed the temple of the Bearing race last time, they had suffered an incalculable loss.
<br><br>
The warriors of the Bearing race were given strict orders to kill Zen at first sight in Stage Thirteen. Even so, they secretly hoped they didn't get a chance to encounter him. They had pinned their hopes on Zen leaving the Lust World, upon passing Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
As long as Zen stayed in the Lust World, the Bearing race would not be able to turn the tables in their favor.
<br><br>
"Humph! If you even think of touching our temple, we will tear down the Oneness Sky Palace." A man from the Bearing race mustered up the courage to throw the threat back at Zen.
<br><br>
"Yes! If the Oneness Sky Palace were destroyed, your life would become the living example of a stray dog!" a member of the Sun Crow race said.
<br><br>
"You can only act as tough as you do on the Other Shore," a man from the Divine Farmer race uttered.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace had never pronounced Zen officially as their disciple. They also expressed their unfamiliarity with him on many occasions.
<br><br>
However, all of this had proven the fact that the relationship between Zen and the Oneness Sky Palace was special.
<br><br>
If the situation were to get out of hand, the Bearing race would attack the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"None of you gets to decide when the Bearing race would attack the Oneness Sky Palace." As Zen spoke, he shook his head disapprovingly. He tossed a stone upwards with his toe and reached out to catch it. With a gentle force, he crushed it into minuscule particles in front of them. "So don't talk nonsense right at my face. Now, get out of here before I change my mind."
<br><br>
With Zen's strength, if he were to throw these particles at the Souls of Light, he could crush them in an instant.
<br><br>
Witnessing a tiny spectacle of Zen's power, the Souls of Light were stunned. They didn't dare stay a minute longer and rushed away all at once after reciting the Illusion Breaking Rune.
<br><br>
Chapter 3332 Fusing It was known that without certain things like the Soul Binding Thread, it was difficult to kill the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Luckily, the Souls of Light who threatened Zen weren't anyone truly important, so he naturally didn't bother to waste his time on dealing with them. He had more important things to do.
<br><br>
After the Souls of Light disappeared, Elvinia came out of the Dark Region with Dorothy in tow. Then, the three of them walked towards the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
The Bearing race were almost finished with all the preparation work in front of the Grand Sky Temple. Today, they would open the temple if everything went according to the plan.
<br><br>
However, the most recent thing that had just happened was a shock to all the members of various races. The Souls of Light of the Bearing race, Sun Crow race, and Divine Farmer race all had left. Only the Souls of Light from some small races decided to stay and watch what would happen next.
<br><br>
"These people escaped fast," Zen said with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
After Zen had walked around the Grand Sky Temple once, he asked Dorothy and Elvinia to wait for a while. He wanted to return to the Other Shore with his Soul of Light. When the two ladies had settled down, his physical body disappeared from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Where is Zen? Is he gone?" Elvinia asked in confusion.
<br><br>
Dorothy looked at Elvinia helplessly and replied, "He has left the Other Shore."
<br><br>
"Left the Other Shore?" Elvinia thought for a while and seemed to understand what had happened. "Will he come back then?"
<br><br>
"Of course he will," Dorothy said firmly.
<br><br>
Zen's body and soul were separated on the Other Shore. Sometimes, he needed to switch between the two forms.
<br><br>
Before he had entered the Grand Sky Temple, he had left his Soul of Light at the Grand Sky Temple's entrance. Right now, he was probably planning to return to the Other Shore with his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
A few moments later, he had finally gotten out of the Other Shore. His eyelids fluttered slightly before fully opening, after which he saw a scene in the room on the second floor.
<br><br>
Not far away was Dorothy who sat with her legs crossed, and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Sadness hung like a thick cloud over Margaret and Letitia, who stood in the corner of the room. Letitia in particular looked much thinner than before, as they had been worrying about Zen every day and night.
<br><br>
He couldn't help but feel the stab of pain in his heart as he watched them quietly.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he already came out of the Dark Region and would return soon.
<br><br>
He couldn't let Dorothy and Elvinia wait too long now.
<br><br>
As Zen thought of it, he activated the Truth of Godly Way and returned to the Other Shore with his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
"Eh?" Letitia mumbled.
<br><br>
She felt the truth aura that emanated from Zen, but it was quite faint.
<br><br>
A soft sigh escaped her lips as she gazed at her husband's closed eyes.
<br><br>
After Zen had entered the Other Shore in the form of Soul of Light, the three of them moved forward on the right side of the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
They needed to go back to the other side of the Other Shore to find a way to remove the Soul Binding Thread that was wrapped around Dorothy.
<br><br>
Halfway through their journey, the three of them had reached the narrowest area of the Light Region on the Other Shore. The areas at the two sides of the road belonged to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Wait," Zen blurted out as he walked towards the edge of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Elvinia was able to freely enter and exit the Dark Region, but Dorothy was still a little scared when she saw the place.
<br><br>
"There is one Other Shore Token that I need to merge with in the Dark Region," Zen told Dorothy.
<br><br>
Something flashed in Dorothy's eyes. "What Other Shore Token needs to be merged with in the Dark Region?" she asked.
<br><br>
"Something from the Dark Region, of course," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
"An Other Shore Token from the Dark Region?!"
<br><br>
Dorothy didn't know much about the Dark Region. When Zen was trapped in the Dark Region, she had done a lot of research about it using various materials.
<br><br>
The materials were highly detailed, and they mentioned something about the Other Shore Tokens in the Dark Region. The Other Shore Tokens there possessed strong Other Shore Power, but it was very difficult to merge with them because everything in the Dark Region clashed with the Light Region.
<br><br>
In history, a small number of people had obtained Other Shore Tokens of the Dark Region. The process of merging with them had always remained a secret.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. I will use candles," Zen replied.
<br><br>
"Candles?" Dorothy was surprised. She didn't expect that those candles would have such use.
<br><br>
Now, Zen knew that Dorothy held a lot of doubts in her mind. He didn't intend to conceal anything from her though, so he said, "I'll tell you everything after we leave the Other Shore."
<br><br>
Then, he asked Elvinia to take out a candle and light it up with the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. After that, he took the candle and walked towards the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The road in the middle that separated the Dark Region into two parts was the only path that connected the two ends of Stage Thirteen. There were a lot of Souls of Light that came and passed by on the road, and Zen's actions immediately caught many of their attentions.
<br><br>
"Look, there are three humans over there. What are they doing?"
<br><br>
"That human has lit up a candle!"
<br><br>
"Is he taking a candle to walk to the Dark Region?"
<br><br>
The Souls of Light who were watching the scene were all dumbfounded.
<br><br>
They all thought that the Dark Region was an absolutely forbidden area, and merely going near it would completely destroy the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Therefore, what Zen was doing was the same as looking for death.
<br><br>
Despite that, Zen really walked into the darkness with his candle just like that.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the candle had illuminated the endless darkness.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light who watched him were stunned. They couldn't believe their eyes, and they didn't understand what was happening.
<br><br>
"Let's go there and take a look!"
<br><br>
"These humans are really capable. Go and ask them how they did it!"
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
It wasn't long before more and more Souls of Light gathered around, until they were too many to count. After all, they naturally wanted to find out the secrets that had made such a bizarre thing to happen.
<br><br>
Some of them began to have greedy thoughts. They thought that if it was necessary, it was also a good choice to directly attack them.
<br><br>
When Zen had entered the Dark Region, he told Elvinia to keep guard and prevent any other Souls of Light from going near.
<br><br>
Thus, Elvinia scowled at the sight of those Souls of Light who were approaching them. "If you dare come closer, don't blame me when I attack,"
<br><br>
she hissed.
<br><br>
As soon as her voice rang out, she forcefully stomped her foot down and the ground beneath her immediately sank.
<br><br>
Only then did the Souls of Light clearly see what this human woman was capable of. And they could see her face and features clearly! Was she… a creature on the Other Shore? But she was clearly a human! Rumor had it from Stage Thirteen that someone had entered the Other Shore with a physical body. That body, however, was clearly in the shape of a human man, and the man wasn't a creature of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
What was going on with this human girl? Then again, no matter what might be the case, the Souls of Light didn't dare to go forward.
<br><br>
Judging from the power that she had just unleashed, it seemed that it was easy for her to kill them.
<br><br>
In the end, the Souls of Light just retreated and watched them from afar instead.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen had successfully entered the Dark Region. His eyes cautiously scanned his new surroundings.
<br><br>
The creatures in the Dark Region were afraid of the Light Region, and had no desire to approach it. Fortunately, the edges of the area were already desolate, so he didn't need to worry about being attacked by the creatures of the Dark Region. Even if he did get attacked, he still could escape to the Light Region with the candle.
<br><br>
After Zen had placed the candle on the ground and got ready, he asked Elvinia to hand over the Civilization Artifact to him.
<br><br>
It was important for him to remember that the Regal Jade Spirit had also warned him to prevent exposing the Civilization Artifact to the Light Region.
<br><br>
Even if the Civilization Artifact was extremely solid, it would still be hard for it to withstand the light from the Light Region because the light could extinguish it in a short amount of time.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the light of the candle could also corrode the Civilization Artifact, but the candlelight's energy wasn't that strong, so the Civilization Artifact could still withstand it.
<br><br>
After Zen had taken over the Civilization Artifact, his Soul of Light activated the Truth of Cultivation Nature, then slowly fused the Civilization Artifact with his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Before, he was a little worried and afraid that the Truth of Cultivation Nature and the Civilization Artifact would clash with each other. Now that he was proven wrong and the Civilization Artifact was successfully fused into his body, he realized that his anxiety was totally unnecessary.
<br><br>
Yet, merging with it was only the first step. The next step was to make his inner world carry the Civilization Artifact, and only then would he be considered to have truly possessed this Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Chapter 3333 Mess After merging with the Civilization Artifact, Zen headed for the other end of the Other Shore with Elvinia and Dorothy.
<br><br>
Dorothy had been confused, but she decided it was better not to ask questions. Instead, she meekly followed Zen's lead.
<br><br>
Once they made it to the other end of the Other Shore, Zen went straight to the auction house of the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
There, he found them moping desolately; they had even stopped the auction. They took a hard blow when they opened the Grand Sky Temple for exploration last time, which lowered their morale considerably.
<br><br>
When Dorothy emerged from the Grand Sky Temple, she had returned the Souls of Light of the Ear Mice to them. Nobody knew how the latter would help the said Souls of Light withdraw from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Upon seeing Zen and Dorothy approaching, the Ear Mice perked up a little.
<br><br>
However, when they saw Elvinia with them, they were all surprised. Their whiskers wiggled in curiosity.
<br><br>
Eager to know more about this elegant lady's background, they pestered Zen with countless questions about her. But Zen refused to answer, and Elvinia herself ignored them as well.
<br><br>
Then, Zen had cut to the chase. He told them why they were really there: to remove the Soul Binding Thread from Dorothy. To his pleasant surprise, the Ear Mice cooperated enthusiastically.
<br><br>
While the Soul Binding Thread was quite troublesome, there were multiple ways to remove it. The Ear Mice took out a mysterious liquid and sprinkled some on Dorothy. After they waited for around an hour, the Soul Binding Thread gradually disappeared.
<br><br>
Zen tried to pay the Ear Mice with soul pills, but they firmly refused.
<br><br>
Although they had failed in the exploration of the Grand Sky Temple, the Ear Mice thought it would be good if they made friends with Zen.
<br><br>
In their eyes, Zen was the spokesperson of Thad. Whether they were one and the same person, it didn't matter. What was important was that the Ear Mice could communicate with Thad through Zen.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice gently reminded Zen that when the Bearing race tried to buy information from them about Zen's body, they had refused.
<br><br>
While the reputation of the Ear Mice wasn't great, Zen believed them.
<br><br>
After all, he knew they were only after communication with Thad. To the Ear Mice, the benefits that Thad would bring them would be far greater than the riches offered by the Bearing race.
<br><br>
After this, Zen took Elvinia and Dorothy back to the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Unless they were in a temple or the Dark Region, Souls of Light could easily withdraw from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But this time, the circumstances were different.
<br><br>
Elvinia had entered the Other Shore with her Soul of Light, but after she became a purified being, she now had a body.
<br><br>
In essence, she was still a soul on the Other Shore, and her real body was still in the Source World.
<br><br>
Nobody knew if she would be able to leave the Other Shore. What would happen to the purified being's body after she made it out of the Other Shore? "Do you still remember the Illusion Breaking Rune?" Zen asked gently.
<br><br>
"The Illusion Breaking Rune? What's that?" Elvinia asked, blinking confusedly.
<br><br>
Zen had expected this. Luckily, the Illusion Breaking Rune wasn't difficult to learn. He patiently taught her the spell, and she obediently learned and recited it.
<br><br>
Dorothy watched this scene silently, recalling what happened in the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
When Zen just arrived at the Sea of Truth, he didn't even know what the Illusion Breaking Rune was. Back then, it was Dorothy who taught him the Illusion Breaking Rune.
<br><br>
When they were trapped in the Dark Region, she was allowed to leave.
<br><br>
However, this depressed her a little bit. She'd have preferred to stay in the Dark Region, if it meant she could be by Zen's side. Even if this meant becoming a fool, like what happened to Elvinia, she would have been willing to go through it all to be with Zen.
<br><br>
Snapping back to reality, Dorothy turned to watch Elvinia remaster the Illusion Breaking Rune. Although Elvinia's memory was an absolute mess, she was still talented.
<br><br>
After reciting it a few times, she had fully mastered it.
<br><br>
With her eyes closed, Elvinia sat still and activated the rune.
<br><br>
"Elvinia? Elvinia?"
<br><br>
Zen shook her by the shoulders gently, but received no response.
<br><br>
He and Dorothy exchanged surprised looks.
<br><br>
It seemed that Elvinia's Soul of Light had left the Other Shore, but her body as a purified being remained there.
<br><br>
"We should leave, too," Dorothy suggested.
<br><br>
Zen nodded.
<br><br>
No matter what, the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace was safe.
<br><br>
Even if there was trouble brewing, the other Souls of Light were probably not strong enough to hurt Elvinia's unconscious body.
<br><br>
"Ah..."
<br><br>
In the room on the second floor of Zen's house, Elvinia moaned as she slowly opened her eyes.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Letitia and Margaret exchanged excited glances. Then, they both turned to stare at Elvinia.
<br><br>
"She woke up!" Letitia cried excitedly.
<br><br>
"How about Zen? Is he awake?" All of a sudden, all of their worries revolved around their beloved husband.
<br><br>
Margaret rushed to Zen's side. She didn't care whether Elvinia had woken up or not. Zen was all that mattered to her in this moment.
<br><br>
Elvinia frowned.
<br><br>
She sat up and stretched awkwardly. In a low voice, she muttered, "This body is so weak..."
<br><br>
The purified being's body back on the Other Shore was much stronger than her own. Naturally, she felt a little uncomfortable with her old body.
<br><br>
However, the purified being's body was an item from the Other Shore, so she was unable to bring it back to the Source World. If she merged with that body as an Other Shore Token, she could bring it to the Source World, but her soul was in the purified being's body... This was complicated.
<br><br>
Zen had just returned to his physical body when he heard Margaret's and Letitia's anxious cries.
<br><br>
With a smile, he reached out his hands to them.
<br><br>
Letitia and Margaret were caught off guard. They screamed for joy and pounced onto Zen.
<br><br>
They didn't say anything more and just leaned on Zen's chest, quietly enjoying the serenity.
<br><br>
Dorothy had also woken up at this point. Opening her eyes to this scene, she felt a little awkward.
<br><br>
She had stayed in the Flow Sword Sect for a while, so she knew about Zen's wives. However, even then, she felt a little depressed watching him coddle them.
<br><br>
"Hey, why are you hugging him?" Elvinia's cold voice cut through the air.
<br><br>
Her memory was still jumbled up; she didn't remember anything about the Oneness Sky Palace. In fact, Zen was the only thing she was sure of.
<br><br>
Seeing Letitia and Margaret in Zen's arms, Elvinia narrowed her eyes in irritation.
<br><br>
Letitia gave her a funny look, but didn't answer.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Margaret glared at Elvinia in disgust. In her eyes, this was the woman who had put Zen through all that trouble on the Other Shore. Actually, he had almost died there! How dare Elvinia question her haughtily? "So, what if I hug him? Zen is my husband!" Margaret said indignantly.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked slowly, as if ruminating the meaning of the word "husband".
<br><br>
Then, as though it suddenly dawned on her, her eyes flashed and she suddenly yanked Zen towards her. "From now on, he is my husband. You are not allowed to touch him."
<br><br>
Margaret's jaw dropped dumbfoundedly. She looked at Elvinia as though she was an idiot.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Letitia was very perceptive. She sensed something was off with Elvinia. Turning to Zen with inquisitive eyes, she silently asked him for an explanation.
<br><br>
Dorothy buried her face in her hands and sighed helplessly. This truly was such a mess.
<br><br>
Chapter 3334 Token Bearing Without wasting any time, Flamine rushed over from the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
When she saw Elvinia had already woken up, she broke into tears of joy.
<br><br>
She immediately walked towards Elvinia and embraced her. At this point, Elvinia spoke. In a cold voice she asked, "Who are you? Why are you hugging me? Do I know you?"
<br><br>
Flamine was stunned by this reaction. She looked at Elvinia and with a questioning look upon her face, she turned to Zen.
<br><br>
A little while ago, Zen had already explained what happened to Letitia and the others. Now, he had to recount the events for Flamine's sake.
<br><br>
"While we were in the Dark Region, a purified being occupied Elvinia's soul," Zen instantly told Flamine.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, Flamine responded to this very calmly. "I am aware of it," she said.
<br><br>
"You know about it?" Zen asked. He was thoroughly intrigued.
<br><br>
Flamine nodded. "The purified being in the Dark Region actually wanted to take Elvinia's soul away. However, I was able to kill him."
<br><br>
After hearing that, Zen finally saw the whole picture. He now understood what had truly happened.
<br><br>
Previously, he had been wondering about why Teague had failed to take Elvinia's soul, since his soul was so much stronger than hers.
<br><br>
Zen thought that Elvinia would die when she fell into the tomb. Much to his surprise, she became a purified being instead! "What happened after that?" Flamine asked. She was obviously still confused as she brought her gaze back to Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Elvinia emerged as she is right now. She has become a purified being and has obtained a new body on the Other Shore. She is now very powerful,"
<br><br>
Zen replied while staring at Elvinia as well.
<br><br>
With that, a hint of surprise streaked across Flamine's face. She was aware that this would be too troublesome because there was a huge disturbance in Elvinia's soul. Moreover, she didn't know what would happen next. No one had ever experienced something like this before.
<br><br>
"Do you know how strong she is now? Is she stronger than you?" Flamine asked curiously and looked at Zen.
<br><br>
"She's a lot stronger and powerful than my body. There is no one in Stage Thirteen that can defeat her. In addition to that, she is able to kill any creature in the Dark Region in an instant," Zen admitted as he stared back at her.
<br><br>
Elvinia's physical body on the Other Shore was already far stronger than Zen's. He didn't know whether she could stand against the three-eyed boy and the giant ape. But even if they were stronger than Elvinia, she had the ability to activate the Great Sanskrit Light. The creatures in the Dark Region had no power to fight back under the light.
<br><br>
"Will she be able to leave Stage Thirteen?" Flamine continued to ask once more.
<br><br>
A purified being was a creature from the Other Shore. They usually inhabited and dominated a certain stage. There were purified beings existing in the upper stages of the Other Shore as well.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, they could only stay in their respective stages regardless of their strength and power. If Elvinia could make it to the upper stages, then her identity as a purified being would have absolute significance.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't thought about this possibility before. With that he said, "The moment we left the Dark Region, we withdrew from the Other Shore. We still haven't tried it yet."
<br><br>
"I understand," Flamine said with a nod. Bringing her gaze back to Elvinia, she gently caressed her face. "It appears that when I vanquished the purified being, his Soul of Light remained in Elvinia's soul and merged with her Memory Flame."
<br><br>
"Is there any way for her to recover from this?" Zen inquired with unabated curiosity.
<br><br>
"The Memory Flame is very fragile and complicated. I am sure there is a way. However, the process will be very troublesome," said Flamine carefully.
<br><br>
Zen had already borne witness to many Memory Flames before. The Memory Flames in the divine land had created an ocean. Laquisha's Memory Flame was once taken out and then given back.
<br><br>
However, these Memory Flames were complete and intact while Elvinia's was broken.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Oneness Sky Palace had no shortage of very talented people. They would find a way to fix this problem.
<br><br>
"Come back to the Phoenix Palace with me. I am extremely worried about you these days," said Flamine to Elvinia with so much pity and longing in her eyes.
<br><br>
Shockingly, Elvinia pushed her away and said loudly, "I won't go anywhere with you! I don't even know you! I have to stay with my husband."
<br><br>
"What do you mean by 'husband'?" Flamine demanded. Her facial expression darkened.
<br><br>
Even though Flamine had much appreciation of Zen, her daughter was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Elvinia was the princess of the Phoenix Palace. How could she call Zen her husband? With that said, Flamine began to wonder what Zen had done to her daughter.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Letitia, and the others glanced at Zen and grinned. Zen had already explained to them that Elvinia had been quite dependent on him after she climbed out of the tomb.
<br><br>
Zen felt embarrassed by this. Once again, he had to explain it for Flamine's benefit.
<br><br>
It had been established that Elvinia had lost her memory. So now, she was much like a six-year-old girl and depended on him by instinct.
<br><br>
Flamine wouldn't leave Elvinia here. She was hell-bent on finding a cure for her.
<br><br>
She proceeded to ignore Elvinia's refusal. She stretched out her fore finger and gently touched Elvinia's forehead. This made Elvinia fall into a deep sleep.
<br><br>
It was true that Elvinia was invincible on the Other Shore. However, she had no power to fight back against Flamine. And so, she was carried off to the Phoenix Palace by her mother.
<br><br>
Dorothy also left after she grasped the gist of everything that happened in the Dark Region. However, she appeared downcast right before she left.
<br><br>
Zen's return was a cause for celebration. His courtyard house became lively again.
<br><br>
During the past few days, Letitia and Margaret were severely worried about Zen. Trish and Carrie felt uneasy as well. They were all tired and dispirited.
<br><br>
But now that he was back, they felt relieved and excited.
<br><br>
Zen felt a little guilty that he caused them to suffer over the past days. In order to make up for it, he accompanied them all day long.
<br><br>
A week later, he chose to cultivate in seclusion.
<br><br>
Merging with the Civilization Artifact was now his top priority. It was too important to be put off any longer. The earlier he merged with it, the earlier he could feel relaxed.
<br><br>
In addition to being a powerful Other Shore Token, the Civilization Artifact also contained a flaw of the Godly Ways Great Unity.
<br><br>
Truth be told, Zen was more interested in this flaw rather than the Other Shore Token itself.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Slowly and steadily, the Truth of Cultivation Nature was spreading inside Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
All at once, the entirety of his inner world became more harmonious and smooth while it underwent this process.
<br><br>
The creatures in the inner world were unable to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way. However, even just the aura released from the Truth of Godly Way would graciously benefit many talented beings.
<br><br>
With the intention of breaking through under the aura, there were warriors and True Gods with outstanding talent that began to cultivate in seclusion.
<br><br>
During that time when Zen merged with the Strength God Totem, his inner world experienced an extremely strong pressure. This was the effect of that terrifying Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
Compared to that, it was much quieter when he merged with the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
It also looked as though the Civilization Artifact was just an ordinary diamond-shaped handicraft.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the entire Thousand Sanskrit Land trembled the moment it appeared.
<br><br>
Buzz! The Sanskrit words were bathed in golden light as they began to flash.
<br><br>
A hundred and four Sanskrit words lit up all over the Thousand Sanskrit Land when the Truth of Goodwill and Malice merged with the Eye of Will.
<br><br>
And then, a hundred and forty Sanskrit words lit up during the time that the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent merged with the Strength God Totem.
<br><br>
This time, however, a total of three hundred and sixty-six Sanskrit words lit up when the Truth of Cultivation Nature merged with the Civilization Artifact! Swish! With each Sanskrit word that shone, a chain would stretch out.
<br><br>
And so, three hundred and sixty-six chains shot out. Afterwards, these chains had wrapped around the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"Hmm. It's possible that the Civilization Artifact is not considered as an Other Shore Token from the Lust World," Zen murmured as he looked at the Civilization Artifact nearby.
<br><br>
In principle, the Other Shore Tokens found in the Lust World could be applied to the Hundred Sanskrit Land regardless of how powerful they were. Take the Strength God Totem for example. It was an Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen that only needed a hundred and forty Sanskrit words to bear it.
<br><br>
"Haha..." Zen suddenly heard a soft laughter.
<br><br>
It was the Regal Jade Spirit that laughed. The sound came from the Civilization Artifact. It said, "This is the result of us hiding in Stage Thirteen and being suppressed by the rules. Otherwise, even the Thousand Sanskrit Land might fail to bear it."
<br><br>
Chapter 3335 The Blood Essence Godly Way In fact, it was possible for creatures in upper stages on the Other Shore to enter lower stages.
<br><br>
However, they had to pay a high price for this and their strength would be limited by the rules of the stages.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization was superior to many other civilizations.
<br><br>
Naturally, its members were by no means weak.
<br><br>
If its members were allowed to use their powers untethered, Zen wouldn't stand a chance. Just the power of a Regal Jade Bug alone could kill Zen instantly without using any poison.
<br><br>
Zen gritted his teeth. He felt the chains straining.
<br><br>
Just as he thought he would make it, he suddenly heard a loud crack. One of the chains had snapped! Crack! Crack! Crack! Just as the first chain broke, the others followed suit. In the blink of an eye, eight chains had snapped.
<br><br>
Zen knitted his brows in frustration. Previously, it had been extremely smooth for him to merge with the Eye of Will and the Strength God Totem.
<br><br>
He hadn't expected that merging with the Civilization Artifact would have any hitches.
<br><br>
Once the chains broke, the Sanskrit words on the other side dimmed slightly.
<br><br>
"What's going on?" Zen frowned.
<br><br>
"Your Thousand Sanskrit Land is not solid enough," the Regal Jade Spirit explained.
<br><br>
"What? It's not solid enough?" Zen echoed in shock.
<br><br>
He remembered that ever since he built the Thousand Sanskrit Land, almost everyone who encountered it had thought it was solid.
<br><br>
If his Thousand Sanskrit Land wasn't solid enough, the ones built by the people with the same cultivation base as him might even be worse.
<br><br>
"Let me help you," the Regal Jade Spirit said graciously.
<br><br>
It used to be the Son of Truth. Moreover, the Civilization Artifact itself was very special and needed to be handled with care.
<br><br>
Even if Zen managed to successfully merge with it, he wouldn't be able to control it fully. The Regal Jade Spirit was bound to the Civilization Artifact, and could also control it.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The Civilization Artifact floating in the air suddenly flashed a cyan light. In a flash, the light transformed into cyan chains. The chains coiled around the Civilization Artifact and then extended to the edge of Zen's inner world, effectively merging with the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
The golden chains created by Sanskrit words continued to snap, one by one.
<br><br>
However, each time one broke, a cyan one would replace it.
<br><br>
After replacing around 40 chains, the Civilization Artifact finally stabilized in Zen's inner world. With that, Zen had successfully merged with the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he could easily read the information hidden within the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
He understood its writing, background and development.
<br><br>
He had caught a glimpse into the Regal Jade Civilization previously. The Regal Jade Spirit had activated the artifact to show him back in the Dark Region. But now, Zen seemed to grasp a full understanding of the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
Once Zen finished reading the information, he sensed a strange energy within the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
The energy was as red as blood. It floated in the air, forming a huge and unfamiliar red Sanskrit word.
<br><br>
"What is this Sanskrit word?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"This is an unknown Sanskrit word," the Regal Jade Spirit replied indifferently.
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows. "What do you mean? What's it for then?"
<br><br>
Some Sanskrit words contained important information, such as the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. On the other hand, some were meaningless with no significance at all.
<br><br>
But why did the Regal Jade Spirit summon this Sanskrit word? Moreover, the energy contained in this Sanskrit word made Zen feel even more uneasy.
<br><br>
"You don't need to understand this Sanskrit word," the Regal Jade Spirit replied. "It was like this when the Wing King found it. You only need its energy, anyway. It is one of the flaws of the Godly Ways Great Unity. It's also a Godly Way, separate from the 3, 000 ones in the chaos."
<br><br>
"A Godly Way separate from the 3, 000 ones?" Zen echoed, dumbfounded.
<br><br>
3, 000 was not always the exact number. Different masters had different ways of summarizing Godly Ways.
<br><br>
The 3, 000 Godly Ways included all the energy in the chaos apart from the Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
They included the flowers, trees, birds, beasts, the heaven, the earth, the sun, the moon and the Five Elements.
<br><br>
Zen was well aware of this. However, the Regal Jade Spirit was telling him that there was a new Godly Way.
<br><br>
"This is truly unbelievable,"
<br><br>
No. 9527 said uneasily.
<br><br>
Previously, when Zen had merged with the Eye of Will and the Strength God Totem, No. 9527 was completely disinterested.
<br><br>
However, now, it was extremely intrigued by the Civilization Artifact. After all, the Regal Jade Spirit used to be as strong as No. 9527's master.
<br><br>
No. 9527 had been quietly observing from the depths within Zen's mind. It could no longer conceal its shock at what was unfolding before them.
<br><br>
It was even inclined to believe that its master would be shocked, too, if he were here to see what they were seeing.
<br><br>
This demonic red energy was nowhere to be found whenever the chaos was born and destroyed time and time again. It was no wonder the Godly Ways Great Unity hadn't been realized.
<br><br>
"What is this mysterious energy called?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"The Regal Jade Civilization doesn't have the concept of the Godly Ways.
<br><br>
Correspondingly, we have two thousand and eight hundred Essence Powers.
<br><br>
This blood red energy is called the Blood Essence Power," the Regal Jade Spirit explained.
<br><br>
"If that's so, can I call it the Blood Essence Godly Way?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Whatever," the Regal Jade Spirit replied disinterestedly.
<br><br>
The name itself didn't matter. What mattered was the meaning hidden behind the name.
<br><br>
The Blood Essence Godly Way was now one of the Godly Ways. It might not be powerful, because like the other Godly Ways, it couldn't compare to Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
However, it made up for a flaw; in doing so, the 3, 000 Godly Ways were a step closer to perfection.
<br><br>
"You said that the Godly Ways Great Unity has three flaws, and the Blood Essence Godly Way is one of them. Are the other two flaws also Godly Ways?" Zen guessed.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit just smiled. "If it were that simple, the Godly Ways Great Unity would have been perfected a long time ago. Although I don't know what the other two flaws are, they most probably aren't Essence Powers, or what you'd call, Godly Ways."
<br><br>
Zen pursed his lips, realizing his mistake.
<br><br>
The members of the Regal Jade Civilization had done everything in their power to try to find the other two flaws. How could he have been so bold to think he could figure it out on his own? After a moment of silence, another thought crossed Zen's mind. "What kind of Other Shore Token is the Civilization Artifact? The descending type? The strengthening type? Or the mysterious type?"
<br><br>
Realizing the Regal Jade Spirit's evident confusion, Zen briefly explained the types. Finally, the Regal Jade Spirit replied, "The Civilization Artifact has all the qualities you just listed. Here, I will teach you how to use it."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, as Zen and the Regal Jade Spirit talked, Geoffrey was standing on top of a palace, his gaze turned towards the sky.
<br><br>
The moment the Civilization Artifact appeared in Zen's inner world, Geoffrey knew that his father brought back something strange.
<br><br>
After the chains disappeared, the huge blood red Sanskrit word appearing in the sky immediately caught Geoffrey's attention. With curiosity, he studied it, trying to figure out the meaning of this mysterious Sanskrit word.
<br><br>
Chapter 3336 The Disintegrated Sanskrit Word The last time Geoffrey deciphered two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment, he had suffered a lot. So, he understood not all Sanskrit words could be deciphered easily.
<br><br>
However, when he saw this unique blood-red Sanskrit word floating in the sky, he still could not suppress his curiosity.
<br><br>
As he was trying to interpret it, the Sanskrit word suddenly began to tremble, and the blood red energy suddenly dispersed into the air like a vapor.
<br><br>
Zen and the Regal Jade Spirit were deep in discussion, so they didn't expect the Sanskrit word to act up like this.
<br><br>
"Eh?" The Regal Jade Spirit grunted confusedly. "Someone is interpreting this Sanskrit word. Is there a decipherer in your inner world?"
<br><br>
There were some creatures in the Regal Jade Civilization responsible for interpreting Sanskrit words, called "decipherers".
<br><br>
In Zen's inner world, the sole person who could decipher Sanskrit words was Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Zen scanned his inner world from the skies. Suddenly, his eyes locked onto Geoffrey, who was looking up at the sky with a confused look.
<br><br>
"It's my son," Zen answered.
<br><br>
"How can he decipher a Sanskrit word at such a level?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked in surprise.
<br><br>
Zen already knew how difficult it was to decipher Sanskrit words, but he also knew his son had a knack for it. Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi found it difficult to decipher the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but Geoffrey had been able to do it.
<br><br>
"Has he... deciphered it?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Minutes earlier, the Regal Jade Spirit had said that it was impossible to decipher the blood red Sanskrit word. It had been telling Zen that the only thing he needed to do was to fuse with the energy of the Blood Essence Godly Way, nothing more. However, much to Zen's surprise, it seemed that Geoffrey could decipher it.
<br><br>
Zen waved his hand, summoning a space door.
<br><br>
He reached into the space door and gently pulled Geoffrey out.
<br><br>
"Father..." Geoffrey cried in surprise.
<br><br>
"Did you just decipher that Sanskrit word?" Zen pointed at the blood red energy floating in the sky.
<br><br>
Geoffrey nodded sheepishly. "I was just curious." His eyes lit up excitedly.
<br><br>
"It seems to be intelligent, Father! It dispersed while I was deciphering it!"
<br><br>
"Then, can you decipher the Sanskrit word?" The voice of the Regal Jade Spirit echoed in the air.
<br><br>
"What was that sound?" Geoffrey's head whipped around in confusion.
<br><br>
"This is Master Regal Jade," Zen answered.
<br><br>
In Geoffrey's eyes, his father was invincible. However, upon hearing the authoritative voice of the Regal Jade Spirit, he sensed it was even more powerful than Zen. Blinking excitedly, he replied, "I am confident I can interpret this Sanskrit word, but it disintegrated too quickly. I didn't have enough time."
<br><br>
"Are you truly sure?" the Regal Jade Spirit questioned dubiously.
<br><br>
In the past, the Wing King had gone through great lengths to find this Sanskrit word that contained the Blood Essence Power. This blood-red Sanskrit word was quite special.
<br><br>
Whenever someone tried to decipher it, the Blood Essence Power would dissipate. After some period of time, it would recover, forming the Sanskrit word once more.
<br><br>
At the time, the Wing King believed that there were special meanings in the Sanskrit word. He couldn't interpret it by himself, so he enlisted the help of the best decipherers of the Regal Jade Civilization. These decipherers were the most outstanding; each of them had their own talent, but none of them succeeded in deciphering the blood-red Sanskrit word.
<br><br>
After trying countless times, the Wing King finally gave up and resigned himself to believing that the Sanskrit word was meaningless. Since then, only a few people still insisted on deciphering it, but no one succeeded.
<br><br>
This was why, when the Regal Jade Spirit took out the Blood Essence Power, it told Zen not to pay attention to the Sanskrit word but to focus on the power it contained, as the power was the most important.
<br><br>
Now that Geoffrey claimed he could decipher it, naturally the Regal Jade Spirit was doubtful.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey, are you really sure? You have to tell me the truth," Zen said firmly.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was a little bit rebellious, but he couldn't do much since Zen had imprisoned him in his inner world.
<br><br>
Seeing his own father doubting his abilities, he felt a bit indignant. "There isn't much information recorded in the Sanskrit Word. As long as it doesn't disintegrate, I can decipher it," he said, puffing out his chest.
<br><br>
Zen exhaled slowly through his nose. He still thought Geoffrey was bragging. After all, the Regal Jade Spirit had lived as a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
If it claimed that the Sanskrit word was indecipherable, then shouldn't it be? Just as he was about to scold his son, the Regal Jade Spirit suddenly cut in.
<br><br>
"What do you mean there isn't much information recorded in the Sanskrit word?"
<br><br>
Startled by the Regal Jade Spirit's sudden sense of urgency, Geoffrey hesitated slightly. "Although the structure of the Sanskrit word is complicated, there isn't much information contained in it," Geoffrey answered firmly.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit didn't say anything for a moment. It was obvious that Geoffrey had aroused its interest, because the Wing King had said the exact same thing before.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit had once been the Wing King's right hand. After being unable to decipher the Sanskrit word, the Wing King's expression fell.
<br><br>
Under his breath, he had mumbled, "There isn't too much information hidden in this Sanskrit word, but I just can't interpret it...!"
<br><br>
After years of research, the Wing King had come to this conclusion. Zen's son only glanced at the blood-red Sanskrit word for a while, and he arrived at the same conclusion almost instantly. Even the Regal Jade Spirit, who was wise and experienced, was surprised.
<br><br>
"In that case," the Regal Jade Spirit said carefully, "please try to decipher the Sanskrit word."
<br><br>
Zen was surprised when he noticed the change in the tone of the Regal Jade Spirit. It seemed to believe what Geoffrey was saying.
<br><br>
"The Sanskrit word disintegrates so quickly that I don't have time to decipher it," Geoffrey said helplessly.
<br><br>
"If you copy it, it will not break apart," the Regal Jade Spirit responded.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Geoffrey's eyes flashed slyly. "What will I gain from deciphering this Sanskrit word?"
<br><br>
It was one of his habits from childhood. Before doing anything, he'd always try to find out what he'd get out of it first.
<br><br>
But, he never asked for anything extravagant.
<br><br>
In the Source World, one could earn a lot of money for deciphering some Sanskrit words. If the Sanskrit word was a little more complicated, the price for the deciphering work would be extremely high.
<br><br>
Taking the two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment as an example, after they were deciphered, the value of their translated version was immeasurable.
<br><br>
However, whenever Zen asked Geoffrey for help, he was never rewarded.
<br><br>
"What will you gain?" The Regal Jade Spirit hesitated for a moment, as it thought about it carefully. "If you are able to disciple it, I will accept you as my disciple."
<br><br>
There was a great civilization that supported the Regal Jade Spirit, known as the Regal Jade Civilization. This civilization was considered one of the strongest and most prosperous among countless civilizations on the Other Shore. As a result, a lot of special theurgies and methods were born here.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Regal Jade Spirit itself was once a Son of Truth—otherwise known as, a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
This was a splendid opportunity. Zen was secretly proud of his son at merely being offered such a trade.
<br><br>
However, to his surprise, Geoffrey's face was full of disdain. "Father, is the Regal Jade Spirit powerful? How powerful is it, exactly? Is it as powerful as Master Estelle?"
<br><br>
Estelle had stayed in the fairy palace for a long time. Geoffrey, having only been exposed to things within Zen's inner world, had thought that Estelle was the most powerful being.
<br><br>
"Um..." Zen gave him a funny expression.
<br><br>
Although Estelle was indeed a powerful warrior in the divine land, she was nowhere near as powerful as the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
Zen patiently explained the strength of the Chaos Ancient God to his son.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's expression changed from disdain to one of delight, while he was listening to Zen with keen interest.
<br><br>
After he finally understood the power of a Chaos Ancient God, he spoke to the Regal Jade Spirit. "Then, it's settled! I'll decipher the Sanskrit word for you!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3337 Spokespersons Geoffrey was greatly interested in the vast Source World. Zen had promised him that once he became a consummate True God, he would allow him to leave.
<br><br>
The powerful warriors he would encounter in the outside world were unmatched compared to those he met in Zen's inner world. He needed more strength to go further into the Source World.
<br><br>
His father had told him that the Regal Jade Spirit was one of the strongest warriors in the chaos, piquing his interest.
<br><br>
"We have a deal," replied the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
Soon after, the dispersed Blood Essence Power slowly gathered and formed the Sanskrit word once again.
<br><br>
Geoffrey wasn't eager to decipher it—he did it after Zen had already copied it on the paper.
<br><br>
But something unusual happened—the word formed by the Blood Essence Power dissipated once he began deciphering the copied word on the paper.
<br><br>
"What's going on?" Zen asked with furrowed brows.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was deciphering the Sanskrit word on paper—why was the one formed by Blood Essence Power still dissipating? "Quite an interesting reaction," said the Regal Jade Spirit, seemingly unbothered. "No matter when and where you decipher a copy of this word, the Blood Essence Power will dissipate rapidly, even if it's half a chaos away."
<br><br>
To decipher it, the Regal Jade Civilization had gone through painstaking efforts. But it was all in vain apart from how they gained a thorough understanding of its nature.
<br><br>
Gripping the copy firmly in his hands, Geoffrey levitated, deep in thought.
<br><br>
The two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment were known to be highly complex, but this one seemed to be the extreme opposite—it was almost too simple.
<br><br>
When it came to these words, though, the simpler they were, the more difficult it was to judge and decipher—there were countless possible meanings behind a simple word.
<br><br>
For most decipherers, such a situation meant a dead end. But Geoffrey was rather exceptional.
<br><br>
After five minutes passed, Geoffrey rolled the paper in his hands as his lips curled up into a smile.
<br><br>
"Did you pick up any clues?" Zen asked, his brows raised at the other's expression.
<br><br>
"Even better—I've deciphered it," he responded proudly.
<br><br>
Both Zen and the Regal Jade Spirit were shocked and wide-eyed. "How is that possible…"
<br><br>
"Nothing is impossible," Geoffrey said, pursing his lips. "But it records a mere sentence—there is very little information in this word."
<br><br>
"What does it mean?"
<br><br>
"What information?"
<br><br>
The other two eagerly asked after him.
<br><br>
While it was possible that Geoffrey was fooling them, the two still hoped to gain some information, no matter how minute.
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit Civilization has committed despicable theft—they stole the sacred fire, making the world grow cold and silent," he read, according to what he deciphered. Even he was confused by it. "What does that mean?"
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit Civilization? Is that a ruling civilization?" Zen questioned.
<br><br>
But 'civilization' carried a broad definition.
<br><br>
Several civilizations resided in Zen's inner world. There were even signs of the developing human race forming different civilizations.
<br><br>
If one could become the ruling civilization, such a group must be a hegemony in the chaos.
<br><br>
Even Zen himself didn't know exactly what the Element Spirit Civilization was—it was less likely that Geoffrey knew of it. Now that the two were certain that Geoffrey wasn't deceiving them, they thought hard about the deciphered sentence.
<br><br>
"The Element Spirit Civilization is the second ruling civilization," the Regal Jade Spirit said.
<br><br>
"The second… that means it also appeared very early on," Zen said, rather shocked.
<br><br>
The first civilization was the Instant Civilization—it must have had some strong warriors who then became Chaos Ancient Gods in the second civilization. These two civilizations were closely linked.
<br><br>
"That's right. The Instant Civilization was short in time while the Element Spirit Civilization had no form. In essence, they were both formed by energies that gathered," said the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
When in the process of growing extremely powerful, some energies produced fire spirits, water spirits, and other creatures of different elements.
<br><br>
These creatures had no physical form—such was what formed the Element Spirit race in the second chaos. This race stood out among the rest because they had many different kinds of elements.
<br><br>
"It says that the Element Spirit race stole the sacred fire…but what is it?"
<br><br>
Zen asked again, still confused.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure," muttered the Regal Jade Spirit. "It says that they made the world cold and silent—it perhaps refers to the chaos. The sacred fire must be another flaw in the Ways-blending Energy…"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes lit up at that. "You mean…the flaw was taken away by this race?"
<br><br>
"Most likely," the Regal Jade Spirit replied.
<br><br>
"But what's the situation of the Element Spirit race now…" Zen wondered, looking concerned.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit only laughed and said, "This race is ranked third on the Other Shore. It's a powerful and ancient race that consistently dominates the upper stages."
<br><br>
"So this civilization is truly very powerful…" Zen frowned as he considered it. "If so, doesn't that mean that the other civilizations have no chance to climb up the stages?"
<br><br>
"Let alone on the Other Shore, even everything in the Source World is the result of their deliberate plan. Those powerful races in the Source World are supported by the Chaos Ancient Gods, who are supported by the civilizations hiding on the Other Shore. The top-level masters in the Source World serve as mere spokespersons of the civilizations," explained the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
"Spokespersons of the civilizations?!" Zen was utterly shocked to hear such a thing.
<br><br>
No. 9527 had told him that the Bearing race had a Chaos Ancient God to support them—they wouldn't have risen so fast otherwise. But to think that the Chaos Ancient Gods had relied on the civilizations from the Other Shore…it was truly inconceivable.
<br><br>
"Did you really say that the top-level masters in the Source World are their spokespersons?" Zen asked again in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Regal Jade Spirit affirmed. "The chaos has experienced many rounds of destruction and rebirth—the powerful civilizations have long since been skilled at the game. As soon as the chaos was born, they began planning."
<br><br>
According to what the Regal Jade Spirit said, Eastern Emperor Taiyi also had a civilization behind him for support? And to think that the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were the same… While Zen was lost in thought, the Regal Jade Spirit smiled and said, "Don't forget, you are now the spokesperson of our Regal Jade Civilization."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization was once a powerful civilization that ranked among the top ten. But because they were hidden at Stage Thirteen, they didn't get much attention.
<br><br>
"I see," Zen nodded slightly. "So, to find the so-called sacred fire, I must find this Element Spirit Civilization?"
<br><br>
"Yes, but you're not strong enough to do so right now…" The Regal Jade Spirit sighed and continued, "Even if it was Wing King who led us, it would be impossible for us to wage a war against the Element Spiritual race. The top three civilizations on the Other Shore are all as solid as rock in their positions. They have advantages, so the other civilizations couldn't possibly contend against them."
<br><br>
Chapter 3338 Primitive Land Zen couldn't help but sigh. After all, he still knew too little about the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In the beginning, he had entered the Other Shore only to obtain the Other Shore Tokens so that he could gain control of stronger powers.
<br><br>
He didn't expect that the forces on the Other Shore were far more complicated than he had imagined.
<br><br>
He was still communicating with the Regal Jade Spirit when Geoffrey, who stood beside him, had started to grow impatient.
<br><br>
"Hey! You said you would take me as your disciple!" Geoffrey reminded the Regal Jade Spirit a bit harshly. "Don't be rude, Geoffrey," Zen shushed him.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit was known to be quite kind.
<br><br>
Not only that, but it always did what it had promised.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A green light flashed in the Civilization Artifact, and turned into a green square that was as tall as a person. The whole square looked like a piece of high quality jade.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
Crisp crackles filled the air as the jade's surface trembled. Some green colored debris fell off from it, then the jade finally turned into a middleaged man who looked like an exquisite sculpture.
<br><br>
"This is you..." Geoffrey's eyes were as wide as saucers as he gawked at the figure.
<br><br>
A smile dawned upon the Regal Jade Spirit's lips. He then turned to Zen and said, "Would you mind if I make a body and manifest myself in the human image while I stay in your inner world?"
<br><br>
Zen cupped his hands towards the Regal Jade Spirit and said, "You are being too polite. Of course I won't mind."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit looked around. When he saw the brown chaotic sea, a trace of doubt appeared on his face. "The sea of this world..."
<br><br>
His sentence, however, was left unfinished. "What do you want to say?"
<br><br>
Zen asked in confusion.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit flew down from high in the air and went straight into the chaotic sea. He stretched out his hand and took a handful of the sea water and said, "Is this the sea water transformed from chaotic energy?"
<br><br>
"Yes. What's wrong?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
The brown sea water boiled in the hand of the Regal Jade Spirit. It wasn't long before it turned into a trace of chaotic energy and dissipated. It made the Regal Jade Spirit even more surprised. "How exactly was your inner world formed?" he asked.
<br><br>
The reason Zen's inner world acted like such was all because of the Primal Chaos Technique his master Bromley had given him. He had directly replaced the life vitality in his inner world with chaotic energy.
<br><br>
"I cultivated a secret technique back then and that's why it has become like this," Zen replied frankly. After all, there was no need to keep it a secret anymore.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit's face became even more unreadable. "You cultivated a secret technique. Where did you get it? The evolution in your inner world isn't complete. Why is it in such a state? It's so strange," he trailed off.
<br><br>
In reality, Zen didn't have a chance to know where his master had obtained the Primal Chaos Technique. When his mother had later on asked about it, she had reprimanded Bromley for being too crazy to give Zen the incomplete Primal Chaos Technique to cultivate. Despite that, it had done Zen no harm and as a result, it actually wasn't so bad. Besides, Mike and Lorena didn't see anything wrong when they had entered Zen's inner world to check, so they just let the matter go.
<br><br>
As for the claim that his inner world was incomplete, Zen had never heard anyone mention such a thing to him.
<br><br>
There was a slight hint of confusion in his dark eyes. "What makes you think that my inner world is incomplete?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Once any world, including the Source World, has been formed, the chaotic energy in that world will fade away completely. The chaotic energy is the most basic energy, and it is extremely poisonous to living beings. It is very difficult for creatures to be formed in such an environment," the Regal Jade Spirit said, deep in thought.
<br><br>
'The chaotic energy would fade away…' Zen pondered on the words the Regal Jade Spirit had said.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, only Holy Beings and warriors at the Other Shore Realm could roam through the chaos. On the other hand, there were a large number of low-level creatures in the Source World, and chaotic energy had never even existed in it.
<br><br>
In Zen's inner world, however, it was different. The chaotic sea water in it was still in a primitive state, but the creatures in his inner world weren't afraid of it at all. In fact, it was in the chaotic sea where the creatures had been born.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen knew what the Regal Jade Spirit meant, but he was more confused. What then was the use of having such an inner world? Even until now, he still didn't know where his master was and he couldn't find a way to ask him about it.
<br><br>
When the Regal Jade Spirit saw Zen's puzzled expression, he quickly said, "I've only seen one possibility that could explain your situation."
<br><br>
"What's that?" "Such a situation usually occurred in the early times of the primitive land.
<br><br>
I have observed such a phenomenon after I became the Son of Truth," the Regal Jade Spirit answered. His eyes began to glow as he spoke, which meant that the story was a clearly distant memory.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization was the 749th ruling civilization, and the Regal Jade Spirit was the Son of Truth of the 750th civilization. Therefore, he had observed how the 750th civilization came into being.
<br><br>
"What is the primitive land?" Zen asked again. "The very initial form of your Source World is the primitive land.
<br><br>
If let's say the whole chaos is an egg, then the Source World is the egg yolk, and the primitive land is what we call it when the egg yolk starts to form at the very beginning… If your inner world is really the primitive land, then it shouldn't be a virtual place inside your body. It's actually a real place in the chaos. Have you noticed it?" the Regal Jade Spirit continued.
<br><br>
As soon as the Regal Jade Spirit finished speaking, Zen's body suddenly trembled.
<br><br>
The borders of his inner world were made up of 1080 Sanskrit words, which circled the range of his inner world. Yet when his inner world had matured, he had once had a faint feeling that his inner world was at a certain place in the chaos.
<br><br>
At that time, he was in the divine land and had thought that such a thing was a common phenomenon shared by all the creatures from the Source World. Now, it seemed that he was wrong.
<br><br>
"It seems that I'm right," the Regal Jade Spirit said with a smile.
<br><br>
"Isn't there only one primitive land?" Zen asked. If what the Regal Jade Spirit had said about the chaos being an egg while the Source World being its egg yolk was true, then there should only be one primitive land.
<br><br>
"Dad, haven't you heard of an egg with double yolks?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey, who had been listening to them silently all this time, chipped in.
<br><br>
Zen stared at him. It indeed made sense according to this metaphor, but it was still only a metaphor.
<br><br>
Could he take it for real? "When a round of chaos comes into being, there might be several or even a dozen primitive lands that are formed where different civilizations start to develop. However, I've never heard of a creature's inner world being a primitive land before," the Regal Jade Spirit said with a shake of his head and smiled. "It was a bit hasty to appoint you as the spokesperson of our Regal Jade Civilization and you were even not qualified--but now, things seem to be getting more and more interesting," he continued.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization had been hiding in Stage Thirteen for a long time, and the Regal Jade Spirit also felt that there wasn't much time left.
<br><br>
Choosing Zen to be their spokesperson was just a makeshift plan, but as the Regal Jade Spirit got to know more about him, he discovered that Zen was not as simple as he seemed.
<br><br>
While Zen discussed things with the Regal Jade Spirit, the divine land on the other side of the chaos had already traveled through the boundless chaos for a long time.
<br><br>
The divine land was like a bright gem that traversed through one chaos cloud after another. It was impressive considering that those chaos clouds were unimaginably large, and it usually took several months for the divine land to pass through a chaos cloud at its normal speed.
<br><br>
Before Zen left the divine land, he had handed the Sun-resisting Umbrella over to Mike. However, it was Timotheus who actually controlled which direction the divine land would go.
<br><br>
Timotheus stood in the sun, his hands controlling the four rings as his consciousness floated to the outside of the divine land. His eyes paid close attention to the surroundings of the divine land.
<br><br>
It was actually boring to control this divine land. There were no sceneries in the boundless chaos, but Timotheus was extremely responsible in doing his job. He hadn't even blinked in the past few months and maintained the same posture all the time.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he sensed something strange. "What's that?" he muttered. His eyes quickly widened when he realized what it was.
<br><br>
When the divine land passed through a chaos cloud, a huge tombstone emerged from behind it. The tombstone was as large as the entire divine land! Chapter 3339 The Graveyard The divine land itself was extremely huge and had taken Chiyou a lot of effort and time to build.
<br><br>
The tombstone was about the same size as the divine land, a fact that shocked Timotheus greatly.
<br><br>
He thought back to a rumor.
<br><br>
The chaos was vast and empty but many secrets and forbidden areas lay hidden within it. Those who entered dangerous sections of it, like the Ruin Graveyard, had no chance of returning.
<br><br>
Rumor had it that if you saw a huge tombstone, it meant that you had stepped into the Ruin Graveyard and there would be no way back.
<br><br>
Timotheus never believed in rumors like this. He only believed what he saw.
<br><br>
But now that he was looking at this huge tombstone, he was finally on high alert.
<br><br>
He waved his hands around, causing his body to spin 180 degrees to his right.
<br><br>
The fast-moving divine land turned abruptly and sped on towards the other side.
<br><br>
This time, Timotheus did not drive the ship into the chaos cloud because he couldn't see properly up there. He had to make sure he stayed away from the tombstone.
<br><br>
He had controlled the divine land to fly for a while along the cloud when the sight of the tombstone looming in front of him again caused him to pale.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
A sense of foreboding rose from the bottom of his heart.
<br><br>
Once he had accepted the captain's position, the entirety of the divine land had come under his control.
<br><br>
He would be in big trouble if he entered the Ruin Graveyard. How would he ever face Grand Chieftain Chiyou if the divine land were to fall to ruin? Timotheus decided to change direction. He drove the ship to fly straight up.
<br><br>
But it was not long before the same thing happened. The huge tombstone was waiting for him.
<br><br>
"We can't go out."
<br><br>
Timotheus muttered, gritting his teeth. He drove the ship in the direction of the tombstone.
<br><br>
He passed by it and the moment he did, he saw another huge tombstone up ahead.
<br><br>
These tombstones, each of which was the same size as the divine land, were everywhere. But they looked dilapidated, as if they had been here in storage for tens of millions of years and had already turned into ruins.
<br><br>
"So the rumor about the Ruin Graveyard is true!"
<br><br>
Timotheus had flown for a while before he realized that he couldn't go on anymore. So he decided to discuss the situation with his group.
<br><br>
He retreated from the rings, took the Sun-resisting Umbrella, and emerged from the sun. He then used the Grand Teleportation to head for the Time Sea.
<br><br>
The largest Floating Island in the center of the Time Sea was magnificently scenic, but despite all of it, the atmosphere in the hall seemed stiff and solemn.
<br><br>
Many Holy Beings were gathered in the hall where Lorena sat on the throne, Rosie standing behind her.
<br><br>
Mike stood in the middle of the hall, his brows furrowed as he asked Timotheus, "Is it true?"
<br><br>
Timotheus nodded and said, "That place is quite famous in the Source World. Almost everyone who has explored the chaos has heard about it. It is not just a baseless rumor."
<br><br>
"Then the divine land will be ruined, won't it?"
<br><br>
"It is the only place where we can live in!"
<br><br>
"What makes that place so dangerous?"
<br><br>
The Holy Beings were whispering among themselves.
<br><br>
Their worry stemmed from the fact that all of them were in the same boat.
<br><br>
All of them lived here and shared lives and deaths with each other.
<br><br>
"Timotheus," Rosie called out loudly over the whispers. "You said that whoever sees the tombstones can't find a way out. Then who gave the Ruin Graveyard its name? The person who named it must have been there. How did this person return to the Source World?"
<br><br>
Timotheus folded his hands and bowed to Rosie. "That's why I don't believe in the rumor. Maybe we can find the way out. Maybe we can go back. But you will have to make a decision for us."
<br><br>
Timotheus was the smartest, most far-sighted person in the divine land.
<br><br>
Whenever he didn't know what to do, he asked Lorena and her sister for their opinion. After all, they were the direct descendants of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Lorena and Mike looked at each other. Mike then suggested, "How about we send some people out of the divine land to investigate it?"
<br><br>
The chaotic energy was terrifying, but there were many people, including the Holy Beings and the masters at the Other Shore Realm who could travel through it.
<br><br>
"That's a good idea," Ramzi agreed.
<br><br>
Timotheus nodded. "I'll stop the divine land right away and then go make an investigation."
<br><br>
"Timotheus, you should stay in the divine land. We'll take responsibility for the exploration," said Mike.
<br><br>
Given that the divine land was still weak when compared to the strong beings of the chaos, Mike's suggestion was reasonable. They couldn't afford to put Timotheus in danger.
<br><br>
"But..." Lorena hesitated. She didn't want to risk Mike's life.
<br><br>
Mike laughed and said, "It's not a big deal for us to die outside since we have Rebirth Lands of our own. I will lead a team for the exploration."
<br><br>
Lorena was aware that the Rebirth Land wasn't the best option. But she had no choice but to agree in front of so many people.
<br><br>
It was not long before many Holy Beings, including Mike, Holy Jay, Estelle, and Sword Chen, went out of the divine land. Ramzi was the only Nine Li Guard who went with them.
<br><br>
They approached the outer wall of the divine land and stood at it, taking in the horizon. Their eyes widened as they saw the huge tombstone.
<br><br>
"The tombstone is so huge. I wonder who is buried underneath?" a Holy Being exclaimed.
<br><br>
"There is no tomb, just the tombstone. This place is strange," said Sword Chen.
<br><br>
Ramzi stared at the tombstone before cautiously saying, "There are many inconceivable things in the chaos. We must be more careful."
<br><br>
"Everyone, follow me," said Mike as he leapt up and traveled through the chaos.
<br><br>
The others followed him closely.
<br><br>
Though it seemed the divine land stopped not far from a tombstone, it would still take a lot of time for a Holy Being to reach it.
<br><br>
A day and a half later, the Holy Beings finally arrived at the tombstone.
<br><br>
The dark tombstone floated in the air. This lonely, lifeless object emitted a strange aura, and its huge shape exerted an inexplicably great pressure on the Holy Beings.
<br><br>
One side of the tombstone was covered with cracks, each as deep as an abyss.
<br><br>
One of the Holy Beings approached a crack.
<br><br>
The moment he got close, a huge tongue stretched out from within the crack.
<br><br>
A number of hooks jutted out of the surface of the tongue, each glinting dangerously.
<br><br>
The tongue caught the Holy Being, the hooks piercing his body as it sucked him into the crack of the tombstone.
<br><br>
It was at this moment that a sudden vibration rocked the divine land. A universe had just collapsed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3340 The Men In Carapace Armor It had never occurred to Mike and the others that such a vicious thing was hiding in the cracks of the tombstone.
<br><br>
They turned pale with fright and stepped back.
<br><br>
"The Holy Being of the Fang Clan has been sucked into the crack!"
<br><br>
"I'm afraid he's been killed!"
<br><br>
"Don't get too close to the tombstone, everyone!"
<br><br>
the Holy Beings reminded one another.
<br><br>
The Holy Beings took solace in the thought that death was not the end for them. They could be resurrected.
<br><br>
Just then, a rune emerged beside Ramzi. He gently pressed it with his finger. Timotheus' voice rang out. "The universe of the Holy Being of the Fang Clan has collapsed."
<br><br>
The group's noise died down immediately as they registered the news in shock.
<br><br>
"How come his universe collapsed?"
<br><br>
"Then is he dead for good?"
<br><br>
"How could that be?!"
<br><br>
The Holy Beings could not believe what had happened. Their universes were their talismans. How could a talisman just be obliterated like that? "The Ruin Graveyard has its own rules. And it's not so difficult to cut off the connection to the Rebirth Land. Be careful, everyone," Ramzi reminded.
<br><br>
Most of the true masters in the Source World would not rely on their Rebirth Lands. On the one hand, the Rebirth Land was a place of restraint.
<br><br>
On the other hand, it was not so safe.
<br><br>
As the Holy Beings fretted, a head appeared from a dark crack.
<br><br>
It was a black toad over 200 feet long. A ghastly face was embedded on its back.
<br><br>
"What kind of monster is this?"
<br><br>
"What a disgusting face!"
<br><br>
"So the Holy Being of the Fang Clan was swallowed by this monster?"
<br><br>
The Holy Beings had seen many abominable creatures in the divine land.
<br><br>
When the toad showed itself, everyone was somehow relieved because it didn't seem as bad.
<br><br>
The strength of so many Holy Beings couldn't be underestimated.
<br><br>
Moreover, Ramzi was a powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm. They were confident they could deal with the toad.
<br><br>
But after the first toad appeared, many other toads appeared from the cracks.
<br><br>
The tombstone was as large as the divine land. The cracks seemed negligible on the tombstone, but in fact, each of them was several thousand feet wide. The space inside was unimaginably large.
<br><br>
The toads that had come out from these cracks stood densely in a row, sending out a cold aura.
<br><br>
Their cheeks were bulging in unison.
<br><br>
"The Ruin Graveyard is the toads' nest?"
<br><br>
"The toads aren't alone here, are they?"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Any of the toads could swallow the Holy Beings effortlessly. And there were over a thousand toads in front of them. If the creatures pounced on them, how would they be able to fend them all off? "We need to get out of here," Mike hissed urgently.
<br><br>
The other Holy Beings had long wanted to leave. They were only too happy to comply with Mike's orders.
<br><br>
But just as they were set to retreat, they heard a strange flute-like sound.
<br><br>
The ghastly faces on all the toads' backs opened their mouths and emitted shrill cries at the same time.
<br><br>
As one, the toads jumped up and rushed toward the Holy Beings.
<br><br>
At this sight, the Holy Beings' blood ran cold.
<br><br>
"Use the Grand Teleportation!"
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Buzz! Every time the space waves formed, they disappeared instantly.
<br><br>
"Master, we can't use the Grand Teleportation in this place!" said Sword Chen, gritting his teeth.
<br><br>
He had a strong will since he had stayed in the Abyss Demon Region for so long, but even he was unnerved to see the toads charging at them.
<br><br>
The Holy Beings tried again but failed, just like Sword Chen. The space channel could not be opened.
<br><br>
In panic, they could only rapidly fall back.
<br><br>
However, the black toads moved faster than them. They moved in the empty space without making a sound. In the blink of an eye, many toads had circled the Holy Beings, surrounding them completely.
<br><br>
Compared to the panic-stricken Holy Beings, Ramzi was much calmer.
<br><br>
His fingers flipped in the air, and pale yellow runes surfaced in front of him.
<br><br>
The runes formed circles of light and spread out, turning into a large array.
<br><br>
The array was surging and sparking with extremely terrifying power. He directed the Holy Beings, "Everyone, come over here."
<br><br>
In this group, no one was more powerful than Ramzi. The Holy Beings were confident in his strength. They scrambled into the array formed by the runes, grasping eagerly at what they knew was a last life-saving straw.
<br><br>
"Don't panic. These toads must be under the control of some other mastermind," Ramzi deduced.
<br><br>
After all, he was much more knowledgeable than the Holy Beings.
<br><br>
The toads obviously weren't sentient. They only attacked, by instinct, the creatures that dared to approach the cracks.
<br><br>
However, when the strange flute sounded, all the toads moved in an organized manner. Obviously, they were being manipulated by someone.
<br><br>
The most important thing now was that these toads appeared to be obeying some silent order and weren't attacking.
<br><br>
The flute sound was getting louder and louder.
<br><br>
The screams of the faces on the toads were likewise growing more intense.
<br><br>
Soon, the Holy Beings saw a dozen black dots flying out from behind the tombstone.
<br><br>
As the dots approached, the group mistook them for insects.
<br><br>
Only when they came nearer did the Holy Beings see clearly what they were.
<br><br>
They were not bugs, but human beings! They were all wearing masks made of insect heads and shell armor on their bodies, making them look like actual bugs from a distance.
<br><br>
"There are actually human beings in the Ruin Graveyard!" Even Ramzi, who was usually composed, was surprised.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard was famous for its dangers, and various vicious races were lurking within it. Who would have thought that humans would be among them? The men in carapace armor approached, crossed the toads' encirclement, and put the flutes down. "You, follow us!" their leader barked out.
<br><br>
"Where are we going?" asked Mike.
<br><br>
"You don't have the right to ask questions," the leader replied stiffly. He put his flute to his mouth and started playing a gentle tune.
<br><br>
"Hoo..."
<br><br>
The toads started to stir. It was clear if the armored men kept playing their flutes, the toads would pounce on the group without hesitation.
<br><br>
These men disregarded Ramzi's array completely. The Holy Beings knew then it wouldn't protect them.
<br><br>
"Do as they say and don't resist," Mike said to the Holy Beings.
<br><br>
Any wrong move and they would get killed.
<br><br>
Now that Mike had given the order, the other Holy Beings decided to cooperate.
<br><br>
The armored men led the way, while the toads surrounded the Holy Beings layer by layer. Together, they flew toward the cracks in the upper right corner of the tombstone.
<br><br>
In the divine land, Timotheus returned to the internal region of the sun and tied the four rings to his body.
<br><br>
He had the sharpest and broadest vision in the entire divine land. He had thus witnessed the events at the tombstone.
<br><br>
Chapter 3341 An Old Friend With the toads as their escorts, Mike and the other Holy Beings entered a great crack in the tombstone.
<br><br>
Inside was a whole other world, dark and wet.
<br><br>
Big black toads, one thousand-foot-wide beetles, and ten thousand-footlong centipedes crawled along the rock walls.
<br><br>
The Holy Beings' faces fell at the sight of their environment. What the hell was that place? The men in carapace armor said nothing and merely took the lead.
<br><br>
After the Holy Beings entered the crack, their escorts scattered and returned to their respective lairs. They did not worry about the Holy Beings escaping, anyway.
<br><br>
"Mike, what the hell is this place?"
<br><br>
"I'm afraid that we're done for... We can't get out of this place..."
<br><br>
Now, even the Holy Beings were afraid of death.
<br><br>
When Zen ruled the divine land, some of the Holy Beings died, and some were reincarnated. A new era had begun in the divine land; its rules were more just.
<br><br>
The descendants of the large clans all began developing, growing more and more powerful. The last thing they wanted was to perish in this time of the new era.
<br><br>
"If they really wanted to kill us, they could've done it outside the tombstone. Why did they bother taking us here?" Mike pondered calmly.
<br><br>
He made sense, but that didn't alleviate their uneasiness in the grim environment.
<br><br>
After flying over a hundred miles in the crack, they found a wide jungle.
<br><br>
The trees there stood over ten thousand feet high, which made some of them think that they had arrived at the Swirl Forest. The scenery was similar, but it somehow seemed much darker and more mysterious.
<br><br>
In the depths of the jungle, Mike and the rest eventually found some normal buildings on a great tree.
<br><br>
When they entered a building, those dressed in carapace armor asked them to wait there.
<br><br>
After about five minutes, a man stepped into the building.
<br><br>
Everyone, including Ramzi who had already reached the Other Shore, felt the pressure from the man's arrival.
<br><br>
'How powerful... I'm afraid he has already reached the Chaotic Source Realm...' Ramzi thought to himself.
<br><br>
In the face of such a strong master, Ramzi knew that even if he went all out, he would be no match for his opponent. The Holy Beings couldn't even dream of standing against the man.
<br><br>
The strange man walked briskly toward them and suddenly pulled on Mike's and Holy Jay's arms. He greeted them excitedly, "Mike, Jay, how have you been?"
<br><br>
The two were stunned.
<br><br>
It was their first time visiting the Ruin Graveyard, so everyone felt grim and anxious. They then all got surprised when the newcomer suddenly greeted Mike and Holy Jay in such a friendly manner.
<br><br>
The man was wearing a mask made of the head of an insect. Thus no one could even see his face clearly.
<br><br>
"It's been years since we last saw each other! You can't even recognize my voice now," said the man as he pulled off the mask, revealing a handsome face of an elegant, middle-aged man.
<br><br>
"Bromley?"
<br><br>
"It's Bromley!"
<br><br>
"Holy Bromley! It really is him!"
<br><br>
Before Mike and Holy Jay could even react, the other Holy Beings recognized the man.
<br><br>
Bromley came from one of the most powerful clans, after all. Even after he had been off the grid for years, the Gu Clan's Floating Island still ranked among the finest. He was indeed extraordinary, leaving a great impression on the other Holy Beings.
<br><br>
Some of them had once followed and supported Nicholas. Back then, they held grudges against Bromley.
<br><br>
But these Holy Beings had already been punished by Zen. In the divine land, they were as docile as sheep. Now, they were extremely welcoming, as if Bromley was a long lost brother.
<br><br>
For another moment, Mike and Holy Jay stared at Bromley.
<br><br>
They had been separated for far too long. In that time, Bromley's cultivation base had greatly increased. There was a dramatic change in his aura, and at that moment, they almost didn't dare believe that the man standing before them was Bromley.
<br><br>
Once that moment passed, however, they enveloped him in a tight embrace.
<br><br>
"If it weren't for your universe, we would've thought you were already dead," Mike said.
<br><br>
A person's Rebirth Land could tell others of their general condition. In the Source World, Zen could roughly point out the Evil God's location through the Rebirth Land. While it was an obscure means of locating, it gave him the right direction to follow.
<br><br>
Before Zen left the divine land, Mike had asked him to investigate Bromley's whereabouts. But Bromley's universe gave him no clues.
<br><br>
Lorena and Timotheus had explained that certain places existed to render the Rebirth Land ineffective. For instance, in the Chaos Ancient God's prison, the Rebirth Land was useless for finding one's location.
<br><br>
If Bromley was in such a place, no one would've found him through the Rebirth Land.
<br><br>
The Ruin Graveyard was such a place—the Holy Being of the Fang Clan perished here.
<br><br>
"I ended up in the Ruin Graveyard by accident. I'm always worried about you, Mike, but I just couldn't leave this place. I'm ashamed," Bromley said, lowering his head.
<br><br>
Back then, there was no point for Bromley to stay in the divine land if he couldn't fight Nicholas. If he chose to battle him, the Gu Clan would've probably ended up the way the Luo Clan did. Leaving was the best thing he could do at the time.
<br><br>
"You're not in the divine land, but you left a fairy palace there, which helped me a lot," Mike said with a smile.
<br><br>
In Mike's universe, Zen had been cultivated, and won the war against Murphy's universe. It all had something to do with the fairy palace Bromley had left behind.
<br><br>
After the Holy Beings settled down, they listened as the newly reunited friends chatted away.
<br><br>
As they did, they heard of the process of Zen's growth—how he had defeated the Murphy Universe in the war, and how he had grown increasingly powerful in the divine land.
<br><br>
For as long as they knew him, the Holy Beings merely assumed that Zen just had too much luck. Never did they expect to find so many twists and turns in his story. They just grew more in awe of him as they heard his story.
<br><br>
Admiration flashed in Bromley's eyes as he listened to Mike's narration.
<br><br>
Shaking his head, he said, "Well, according to you, I'm not the one who makes the biggest contribution. As it turns out, it's your good son."
<br><br>
"He's also your good disciple, haha!" Mike burst out in laughter.
<br><br>
Although Bromley was Zen's master, they had never met personally. It was a strange thing.
<br><br>
After briefly telling Bromley what had happened in the divine land, Mike asked, "Do you know what kind of place the Ruin Graveyard is? Do you really think we have no way of leaving this place?"
<br><br>
Bromley's eyes gleamed with a sense of serenity as he said, "The Ruin Graveyard is extremely dangerous in the eyes of outsiders. It's another primitive land of chaos, but it's not as terrible as you probably think. There's a way to leave, but now's not the right time."
<br><br>
"I'd like to hear more," Mike urged, cupping his hands.
<br><br>
The Holy Beings left the divine land just to explore the Ruin Graveyard. It was just their luck to have bumped into Bromley there.
<br><br>
And so Bromley told the Holy Beings of what he knew in great detail.
<br><br>
Chapter 3342 The Return Of The Master Only one primitive land was usually formed in each round of chaos.
<br><br>
Each round of chaos had only one Source World in the early stages.
<br><br>
But as the Other Shore was created, more and more races entered it before the chaos could be destroyed. As the gathered powers on the Other Shore became more and more complicated, so did the chaos.
<br><br>
The chaos often had several primitive lands in the later stages.
<br><br>
The Source World and the Ruin Graveyard were among these primitive lands.
<br><br>
Only, the Ruin Graveyard was far smaller in size when compared with the huge Source World.
<br><br>
All the tombstones that Mike and the others had come across had been as large as the divine land. In all, there were a total of eighty-seven tombstones of this size in the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Ruin Graveyard had already been large enough in the eyes of those from the divine land.
<br><br>
These eighty-seven tombstones were home to different races, among which humans had the largest influence.
<br><br>
At Bromley's explanation, one of the Holy Beings remarked proudly, "Humans are the spirit of all gods. It's no surprise that they are the strongest!"
<br><br>
Chiyou, himself a human, had created the divine land. All other creatures within it, whether intelligent or not, were inferior to humans. These Holy Beings had never left the divine land, which was why they were under the impression that this was the case everywhere.
<br><br>
Bromley shook his head in disagreement at the Holy Being's words. "No, it's not like that."
<br><br>
Ramzi nodded and said, "Humans aren't top forces in the Source World, but they have improved a lot these past few years. Some races are born strong, and humans aren't as powerful as them."
<br><br>
Bromley looked carefully at Ramzi and then asked, "Are you from the Source World?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I am," Ramzi replied, folding his hands and bowing to Bromley.
<br><br>
"Ramzi is a Nine Li Guard. The divine land can be safe thanks to them,"
<br><br>
Mike said as way of introducing him to Bromley.
<br><br>
Ramzi and Bromley nodded to each other. Ramzi then asked, "Who created this primitive land?"
<br><br>
"Another force of the human race," Bromley replied.
<br><br>
"What?" Ramzi was surprised at this answer. He stiffened, his renewed vigilance visible in his stance.
<br><br>
These Holy Beings were born in the divine land but they couldn't claim to be descendants of the Nine Li race. Things would become complicated if the human force that Bromley had mentioned turned out to be the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
"As far as I know, there are only four orthodox human forces in the chaos.
<br><br>
The Nine Li race, the Oneness Sky Palace, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race. Which one of them created the Ruin Graveyard?" Ramzi asked.
<br><br>
Bromley shook his head, an unfathomable smile on his lips, and replied, "None of them. You may have misunderstood something. The race that could obtain a primitive land would not be born in this chaos."
<br><br>
Ramzi's eyes widened. "Do you mean a civilization on the Other Shore? They are humans?" he asked.
<br><br>
Ramzi had heard about the Chaos Ancient Gods and the civilizations on the Other Shore from Timotheus. He didn't know much about them, but given the information he learned, he could roughly guess it.
<br><br>
But Mike and other Holy Beings were confused.
<br><br>
After Zen had left the divine land, the Holy Beings there had the opportunity to break through and enter the Other Shore Realm. They were all cultivating the Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
But only Joy and Estelle had succeeded in entering the Sea of Truth while the other Holy Beings were still painstakingly chanting the Truth of Godly Way. It was probably because of their bad compatibility with the Truth of Godly Way that they were making such slow progress.
<br><br>
"Yes," Bromley nodded cautiously. "This particular human force used to be splendid. It was once the ruling civilization of the 77th chaos. It is a powerful civilization even on the Other Shore."
<br><br>
Bromley's amazing feat in cultivation in the Ruin Graveyard was attributed to his extraordinary talent and the preferential treatment that the human race in the Ruin Graveyard had given him. After all, they were all human.
<br><br>
The other Holy Beings drew a collective sigh of relief at this piece of information.
<br><br>
They had thought that it would be a disaster for the divine land to sink into the Ruin Graveyard. But it no longer seemed to be a problem.
<br><br>
"What will they do to the divine land?" Mike asked, putting everyone's concerns into words.
<br><br>
Bromley thought for a while before answering, "They have been looking for their spokespersons among the eighty-seven tombstones. And now that the divine land is here, even if by mistake, they will probably include it in their searches."
<br><br>
"Spokespersons?" Holy Jay looked confused. He knew little about this.
<br><br>
Bromley nodded. "Sooner or later, there will be a fierce battle in the chaos.
<br><br>
They need to first choose a few spokespersons from among the humans.
<br><br>
And the divine land has a large number of humans, so it would prove to have some great choices if it were to join in the selection."
<br><br>
The Holy Beings looked confused at his explanation. "There are many humans in the divine land but they are at a low cultivation level. Can they be selected?" one of them asked. "If we do join the selection, would the humans in this graveyard also support us?"
<br><br>
Once Zen had left, a crazy rush had erupted within the divine land to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
Many consummate True Gods, Demi-holy Beings, and Holy Beings were struggling to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way. But it was too difficult for anybody to comprehend it easily. They couldn't even step into the threshold without a good compatibility with it. But it would be of great help if they could get the support from the Ruin Graveyard. That was what the great clans in the divine land had long desired.
<br><br>
These clans didn't care where the divine land was going. They only wanted it to remain immortal.
<br><br>
Bromley smiled faintly. "Of course they will. I can assure you of this."
<br><br>
Now that Bromley was an important figure in the Ruin Graveyard, he could easily provide them with the cultivation resources that they needed.
<br><br>
The discussion regarding the current situation of the divine land went on for a while before Bromley asked Mike, "How is Estelle? Has she come out of the fairy palace?"
<br><br>
She had been locked in the fairy palace for a long time because of her extrastrong personality.
<br><br>
Bromley had had no choice in the past but he knew he still cared about her.
<br><br>
"When I went to the Soul Wilderness and begged her to help me, she asked me to find you. And I think I've fulfilled my promise now. I made it!" Holy Jay said, a meaningful smile on his face.
<br><br>
Bromley's eyes lit up at Holy Jay's words. "I'll go back to the divine land with you!" he said excitedly.
<br><br>
He led the way and the other Holy Beings followed close behind.
<br><br>
They emerged from the crack and headed straight for the divine land.
<br><br>
Bromley was born in the divine land, so he wouldn't be blocked by the divine land's Heavenly Mirror Shield. The moment he entered the divine land, he activated his Grand Teleportation and rushed to the Floating Islands above the Time Sea.
<br><br>
It looked like a significant change had taken place on the Floating Islands.
<br><br>
Only a few Floating Islands of great clans like the Gu Clan and the Luo Clan remained above the Time Sea. The huge central Floating Island stood still.
<br><br>
When the divine land had accidentally entered the Ruin Graveyard, all the warriors of the divine land had been utterly shocked.
<br><br>
They were waiting nervously for latest news on the central Floating Island.
<br><br>
Among them were Harold, Hallet, Augustus and Estelle.
<br><br>
One universe of the divine land had collapsed not long after the Holy Beings had left. It was proof that the Ruin Graveyard was evil.
<br><br>
As these warriors waited, a middle-aged man appeared in the sky above the central Floating Island. Hallet and Augustus were dumbfounded when they saw who he was.
<br><br>
Chapter 3343 Asking For A Meeting As he entered the divine land, Bromley had swiftly removed his carapace armor off his body, and sported a classic green robe. This robe was his signature look, something that he wore very often in the past.
<br><br>
Bromley was always regarded as handsome, most especially when he was young. Now that he had improved his cultivation base greatly, he was even more attractive. The strong aura carried him with elegance everywhere he went.
<br><br>
Even Mike and Holy Jay were hardly able to recognize him at first glance, not to mention Hallet and Augustus.
<br><br>
"He looks so familiar... Who might this be?" Augustus wondered as his eyes grew wide.
<br><br>
"It's Master," Hallet responded.
<br><br>
Though he was one hundred percent sure that it was Bromley, neither of them dared to approach him.
<br><br>
The strongest warriors they had ever met in their lives were Timotheus and Emily. They had great energies and cultivation bases, making it so intimidating to merely look at them.
<br><br>
But Bromley's aura was even stronger than that of them.
<br><br>
Everyone was aware that the limit of cultivation in the divine land was the consummation of True God Realm. It was extremely difficult to become a Holy Being, much more to reach the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
So far, there hadn't been any Holy Being who had broken through.
<br><br>
Bromley's cultivation base had improved so much that he was much more powerful than the Holy Beings of the divine land.
<br><br>
Eventually, Bromley found himself landing on the Floating Island and gazed at his two disciples. He smiled gently as he acknowledged them, "Hallet, Augustus."
<br><br>
The two looked at each other in relief, finally sure that this powerful man was indeed, their master.
<br><br>
"Master!"
<br><br>
In his excitement, Augustus rushed towards Bromley and fell to his knees.
<br><br>
Hallet, on the other hand, tried to keep his calm. He walked solemnly towards his master and knelt down right beside Augustus.
<br><br>
"It is Holy Bromley!"
<br><br>
"It is! It is indeed Bromley!"
<br><br>
"It seems that his training has done him well! He looks so powerful!"
<br><br>
People were murmuring, right as Bromley's identity was confirmed. All were full of shock and excitement.
<br><br>
"Rise," Bromley said with a smile, holding out his hand towards Hallet and Augustus to help them up.
<br><br>
"Master, we have missed you. We've fulfilled all the tasks you assigned to us..."
<br><br>
Augustus stood up, talking with passion to his master.
<br><br>
"Do us a favor and please stop speaking," Hallet blurted out. He was always fed up with Augustus' verbose expressions.
<br><br>
"I haven't seen him in years!" Augustus said, "Just let me have my moment!" His face was flustered and annoyed.
<br><br>
These two bickering before him was not a surprise to Bromley. "It doesn't matter," he said with a smile. "Augustus is always a chatterbox. I don't mind."
<br><br>
Bromley took the time to take a look at the crowd. He caught a glance from Estelle, who stood out among most.
<br><br>
Estelle's radiant eyes were filled with all sorts of emotions: love, happiness, confusion, and even resentment. It seemed like everything she had to say was said through her eyes.
<br><br>
When the two's eyes finally met, Estelle turned around and walked swiftly away from the crowd.
<br><br>
Seeing her walk away, Bromley jerked forward and followed behind her.
<br><br>
He gripped her wrist and tried to pull her in for a hug, but just as his fingertips touched her, she spun around with a scepter in her hand.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
As this scepter trembled with power, it seemed as if a portion of the divine land's power was being used by Estelle alone.
<br><br>
"Silence!"
<br><br>
Before, when Estelle launched the power of the Scepter of Gods' Silence, her target was the entirety of the divine land. This was different, because now, her target was only Bromley. The crowds flocked and gasped at the sight of this. Who knew what was going to happen? Though Bromley proved to be extraordinarily strong, all the power within him was paralyzed by the Scepter of Gods' Silence! "Bang!"
<br><br>
In one swift movement, Estelle swung the scepter and hit Bromley right in the chest.
<br><br>
Her figure suddenly altered and began to look faded to the naked eye.
<br><br>
Because she was continuously hitting Bromley so quickly, no one could even see her. Each strike she made was fatal.
<br><br>
"Hallet... She just... Look..." Augustus was at a loss for words.
<br><br>
"Don't meddle," Hallet replied. He knew Bromley could defend himself.
<br><br>
The two knew that Bromley's cultivation base was a lot more than anyone could imagine. This meant that no matter what Estelle did, she could not injure him easily.
<br><br>
However, Estelle had used all her strength. Even though Hallet seemed calm, hearing the sound of Estelle's hits made his eyes tremble.
<br><br>
What if his master was hurt? Or worse, what if he had died? On another note, Mike and Holy Jay could not stand to watch Estelle do such horrible things. They knew that even if Bromley had hurt Estelle before, they couldn't let her kill him. That was not the way to get revenge.
<br><br>
"Enough!" Mike declared.
<br><br>
However, as if she heard nothing, Estelle kept charging towards Bromley with the hope to kill him.
<br><br>
But before Mike and Holy Jay could intercede, Bromley, who was beaten to the ground, looked at them with piercing eyes. He winked at them, and then his lip curled up into a small yet noticeable smile.
<br><br>
Both of them were stunned. "Did you just see that?" Mike turned to Holy Jay.
<br><br>
Apparently, Bromley was playing defenseless. If anyone had been hit by Estelle in the same way, they would have died. But Bromley was stronger than what he was showing everyone, and he knew it all along.
<br><br>
He took every hit and every blow that came his way. Even when the power of the Scepter of Gods' Silence had gone, he refused to fight back.
<br><br>
It was not until Estelle exhausted herself that Bromley approached her and opened his arms.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, she threw herself into his embrace and began to sob endlessly.
<br><br>
Bromley thought it was inappropriate to comfort Estelle before the crowds of people, so he turned towards the crowd. "We need to go," he said.
<br><br>
He lifted a hand and gently moved away Estelle alongside him.
<br><br>
"Master is so powerful! Look at that! She beat him up for so long and it's like nothing happened!" Augustus exalted proudly. He figured this was something he could brag about for a very long time, especially because he'd seen it happen.
<br><br>
Four hours had passed and Bromley, together with Estelle, had returned safely to the Floating Island.
<br><br>
The travel allowed Estelle to regain her composure and elegance, so as they arrived, she had only a wide smile across her beautiful face.
<br><br>
Not long after the Holy Beings returned, Timotheus immediately rushed over to ask Ramzi about the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
The future of the divine land had to be discussed in great detail. They had to come to a decision that everyone was on board with.
<br><br>
After Zen had successfully merged with the Other Shore Token, the Regal Jade Spirit successfully remained in his inner world.
<br><br>
Geoffrey eventually became the Regal Jade Spirit's disciple, and Zen specially created a space for them. Only Geoffrey and the Regal Jade Spirit could enter that place, so that no one could disturb them.
<br><br>
After coming out of the inner world, Athemar waited at the courtyard for what seemed like forever.
<br><br>
Tension and worry filled Athemar and the others when Zen was trapped on the Other Shore, and they could only wait for his return.
<br><br>
"I apologize for causing so much worry while I remained on the Other Shore," Zen said solemnly to Athemar, cupping his hands towards him.
<br><br>
His decision to enter the Dark Region with Dorothy had been made hastily.
<br><br>
He hadn't discussed it with anyone, so it caused much anxiousness among the group.
<br><br>
In fact, Athemar had heard about the situation from Flamine. He spoke, "The Other Shore is full of risks and dangers. I can't believe you entered the Dark Region and got out, but I am glad that you are safe. You are one lucky bastard!"
<br><br>
"Thank you for praising me," Zen said with a laugh.
<br><br>
Athemar rolled his eyes at Zen. "I am not praising you. Not at all," he spoke with a sudden seriousness. "You are indeed, lucky. If not, you would be dead. Once you enter the Desire World, please talk to us before making any decisions. After all, we are quite experienced with things like these."
<br><br>
"I'll make sure to keep that in mind," responded Zen. He knew that Athemar was right, and that he should probably not cause too much trouble anymore.
<br><br>
"Anyway, there is something else I wanted to talk to you about," Athemar uttered, bringing back his serious expression.
<br><br>
"What's the matter?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"A man named Leopold is looking for you," replied Athemar.
<br><br>
If one was only an Other Shore Realm warrior, it was impossible for them to come into contact with someone like Athemar when they arrived at the Oneness Sky Palace. However, this time, Leopold came with some other people.
<br><br>
Chapter 3344 Ambrose Li Leopold came back to the Source World for two reasons. One was to escort Zen, and the other was to look for the members of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
In fact, Timotheus didn't give Leopold anything specific to do.
<br><br>
They had been away from the Source World for too long. After suffering bitterly at the bottom of chaos, they only wanted a peaceful life.
<br><br>
If Leopold was willing to follow Emily to the Pear Hill, he could happily spend the rest of his life with the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
But he didn't do that. Instead he went to the Pearl Islet. He was trying to find signs the Nine Li race left.
<br><br>
His hard work paid off. He found some leads.
<br><br>
He followed the trail of clues and actually found the last surviving members of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Zen's face changed at the mention of Leopold. He asked, "Master Athemar, where is Leopold?"
<br><br>
Sensing Zen's eagerness, Athemar smiled and simply replied, "Follow me."
<br><br>
Zen walked up to Athemar's huge sword and flew away from the Flow Sword Sect. They soared over Oneness Mountain, flew to the northern slope, and finally landed.
<br><br>
His landing point was the Splendid Palace, where the people of the Oneness Mountain received their distinguished guests.
<br><br>
Zen hurried into the Splendid Palace and saw more than ten people sitting inside, and Leopold was among them.
<br><br>
"Leopold!"
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
Leopold traveled to the Source World with Emily. After he was separated from Zen, he had lost all hope. His expression was one of surprised delight as he saw Zen again.
<br><br>
At first, he didn't know where Zen was. Yan talked to the people of Pear Hill and organized a search party to look for Zen. That was when he discovered the young man was in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace was an orthodox human force. If Zen could get his foot in the door, he might be able to turn them into powerful allies.
<br><br>
After finding the remnants of the Nine Li race, Leopold told Ambrose Li about Zen. But they couldn't find a good time to go to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
After hearing of what had happened in the Grand Sky Temple, they finally decided to risk a journey to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"It hasn't been that long since we last saw each other, but your cultivation base has reached the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. I'm jealous of what you've accomplished," said Leopold, looking Zen up and down in surprise.
<br><br>
Zen had just made it to the Sea of Truth before he first came to the Source World. At that time, his strength and cultivation were far weaker than Leopold's. But now he was much stronger than his friend.
<br><br>
"I'm flattered. I was lucky," Zen replied modestly.
<br><br>
"Come, let's say hi to the chieftain! I'll introduce you," Leopold said as he pulled Zen to the rear.
<br><br>
Behind them stood a burly old man.
<br><br>
The old man had a poor complexion. His aura seemed restrained, and he was no longer as strong as he had once been. However, his big eyes shone brightly. Anyone would be intimidated if they had to look him in the eye.
<br><br>
"The chieftain?" Zen was confused.
<br><br>
According to his information, Chiyou was the only chieftain of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Leopold said, "The Nine Li race is divided into nine tribes. Besides the Grand Chieftain, there are eight others. They're the Grand Chieftain's brothers. This is your Grandpa Ambrose."
<br><br>
Chiyou was the Grand Chieftain, followed by Harvey, Ambrose and the others.
<br><br>
Ambrose's eyes had been fixed on Zen ever since he had entered the Splendid Palace.
<br><br>
After Chiyou was defeated, there was no chance for him to reclaim their power. The divine land was just a place that Chiyou built to continue the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
When the chaos was destroyed, the divine land would also be gone. The Nine Li race would then disappear forever, only remembered in the annals of history.
<br><br>
Ambrose would never have imagined a descendant of the Nine Li race would return to the Source World from the divine land.
<br><br>
Zen addressed the old man, "Grandpa Ambrose."
<br><br>
Athemar knew who Zen was, and Leopold was no outsider. Zen wasn't going to hide his identity from these people.
<br><br>
"Lorena was just a little girl when she left. Now, her son is grown up," said Ambrose with a gratified look.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and said, "My mother lives in the divine land now. She misses you too."
<br><br>
"Let me introduce you. This is my grandson, Hutton, and my granddaughter, Sally. Have you met them before?" A man and a woman had been flanking Ambrose. Now they stepped forward.
<br><br>
The man was dressed in a suit made of golden silk, and his eyes were as sharp as a knife. The woman wore a silk dress, and was petite and lovely.
<br><br>
When she smiled, two sweet dimples appeared, which made her very approachable.
<br><br>
Ambrose had his own reasons for introducing Sally and Hutton.
<br><br>
The remnants of the Nine Li race knew Zen's story. Leopold filled them in.
<br><br>
They even knew that he was in the Oneness Sky Palace, but he had never been here before.
<br><br>
At that time, Zen's strength was too low. If he had an outstanding talent, it would be better for him to stay in the Oneness Sky Palace to further develop his talents. After all, the Nine Li race was too weak to cultivate him.
<br><br>
However, the information that Hutton and his group brought back from the Dark Region made Ambrose restless.
<br><br>
Hutton told Ambrose that when he explored the Grand Sky Temple and the Dark Region, he met a corporeal body that had the blood of the Nine Li race, and was related to Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
This information, together with the news that Leopold brought to Ambrose, suggested that the corporeal body was none other than Zen.
<br><br>
Ambrose took a big risk leaving in order to verify it.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Sally. "Yes, we've met. We explored the Dark Region together. Hard to forget when we almost died." His voice was deeper than usual.
<br><br>
"You're Thad!"
<br><br>
Sally had been quietly observing Zen. She had never seen his real face before, and his voice was not as deep as Thad's, so she wasn't sure whether this man really was him.
<br><br>
After she heard Zen's voice, she was one hundred percent sure, and a bright smile appeared on her face.
<br><br>
"I asked you to find me, but I didn't expect it would be so soon," Zen said with a smile. "You're not outsiders. You don't have to call me Thad. My name is Zen."
<br><br>
Hutton bowed to Zen. "After we said goodbye in the Dark Region, I thought we'd never see you again. But you left the Other Shore safely. I am glad to see you here."
<br><br>
Sally and Hutton were very interested in what happened to Zen after they parted. Zen couldn't tell them much. His experiences involved Elvinia and the purified being, and those were secrets of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
This reunion proved what the last members of the Nine Li race had theorized. Thad was Zen, and Zen was from the divine land.
<br><br>
And Zen had his questions answered. He knew what was going on with the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Only Ambrose stayed with the Nine Li race. The other chieftains had been dead or missing.
<br><br>
To complicate matters further, the Bearing race had been secretly hunting down the remnants of the Nine Li race. Any descendants were killed on the spot, so every time the Nine Li people ventured forth, they were putting their lives at risk.
<br><br>
When he heard what the Bearing race had done, Zen furrowed his eyebrows. He shouldn't have been merciful to them.
<br><br>
At last, Ambrose suddenly asked, "Are you willing to live among the Nine Li race?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3345 Promise A knowing look flashed across Zen's eyes. Ambrose's request did not come as a surprise to him.
<br><br>
After all, he had brought a massive amount of divine crystals from the divine land with him, which were originally resources that belonged to the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Most importantly, Chiyou had entrusted Zen with some arrangements, although it was No. 9527 who received the task.
<br><br>
The remaining members of the Nine Li race had lost all hope, but that changed when Zen arrived.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Athemar's eyes gleamed and his face became unreadable.
<br><br>
To be honest, the Oneness Sky Palace didn't invest many resources in Zen's cultivation.
<br><br>
Zen was able to climb up the mountain in the Oneness Sky Palace because of his own efforts.
<br><br>
In addition, he brought many benefits to the palace.
<br><br>
If Zen ever chose to leave, Athemar knew that he had no reason to stop him.
<br><br>
So before Zen could speak, he quickly cupped his hands towards Ambrose and said, "Master Ambrose, may I say something?"
<br><br>
Ambrose glanced at him and answered, "Please, go ahead."
<br><br>
Back then, Ambrose was a hero of indomitable spirit in the Source World.
<br><br>
He enjoyed a status that was equal to those of the heads of the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace. At that time, Athemar was much inferior to him.
<br><br>
The times, however, had changed. The Nine Li race had declined and was long past their prime. Moreover, both Ambrose's body and soul had been badly damaged, and he hadn't been able to recover since. He was no longer as strong as he used to be.
<br><br>
"Zen has made rapid progress ever since he joined the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
I have heard from him many times about his determination and eagerness to rebuild the Nine Li race. The Nine Li race is truly lucky to have such a descendant. I have no doubt that he will be a man of great power in the future," said Athemar. He paused for a bit and then continued, "But Master Ambrose, you should be more aware of the current situation of the Nine Li race than I am. Zen can return to you if he wants, but how can you cultivate him right now? Apart from anything else, if the Chaotic Source World opens, do you have a ticket for him? Can you bring him there safely?"
<br><br>
It was known that the Nine Li race used to be a large, dominant force. They couldn't be underestimated despite their downfall. Furthermore, there was more than one group like the one Ambrose led, which was the reason the Bearing race always chased after them.
<br><br>
That was also why the remaining members of the Nine Li race had to hide themselves from the world. As a result, it was impossible for them to expand or even accumulate resources. They now lived even more cautiously on the Other Shore and the world in general.
<br><br>
It also went without saying that they couldn't enter the Chaotic Source World publicly.
<br><br>
Sally and Hutton exchanged silent glances. They were worried about the tickets to the Chaotic Source World as well.
<br><br>
As the outstanding talents of the younger generation of the Nine Li race, crossing the thirteen stages in the Lust world wasn't a big problem for them.
<br><br>
The only thing was, it was useless to improve only their souls. Therefore, they had to go to the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
A trace of sadness appeared on Ambrose's face after he heard what Athemar said.
<br><br>
Athemar felt sorry for Ambrose. After all, he highly respected Ambrose as his senior. It was just that Ambrose had lost his power and influence now.
<br><br>
"Well, when Zen joined the Oneness Sky Palace, I told him that he could leave at any time and we wouldn't stop him, but now is not the right time for him to return to the Nine Li race. If he is strong enough to lead the Nine Li race in the future, then I will have no objection," he continued.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Ambrose's downcast face revealed a crafty smile. He replied, "As you said, it's unrealistic for Zen to come back to the Nine Li race right now.
<br><br>
I can't represent the entire Nine Li race, either. So, Zen can stay in the Oneness Sky Palace, but on one condition."
<br><br>
Athemar's voice was solemn as he mouthed, "Please, go ahead."
<br><br>
"I have brought several clansmen here. Could you please take care of them and bring them into the Chaotic Source World?" The smile on Ambrose's lips stretched a bit wider.
<br><br>
Both Zen and Athemar were stunned.
<br><br>
The two never expected that Ambrose had such a plan in his mind.
<br><br>
Before Athemar could say anything, Ambrose sighed heavily and continued, "Alas, we have no other choice now. Even if we did get the tickets, it would still be hard for them to enter the Chaotic Source World. I will be deeply grateful if you can help them."
<br><br>
Zen quickly turned to Athemar and said, "Master Athemar, please report to the Oneness Sky Palace and recruit my clansmen. The tickets to the Chaotic Source World are precious, and I'll bear the cost."
<br><br>
If the Oneness Sky Palace could not get the tickets, Zen planned to buy them from the Ear Mice. He believed that the shrewd Ear Mice would not refuse his request.
<br><br>
It was quite some time before Athemar finally came to his senses. 'Ambrose is smart. He knows that the remaining people of the Nine Li race can't cultivate Zen, so he has no plan to take him back. On the one hand, he personally came to the Oneness Sky Palace to meet Zen; on the other hand, he wants the Oneness Sky Palace to recruit his clansmen. That's why he took the younger generation with him, ' he internally groaned.
<br><br>
Under everyone's gaze, Athemar put on a smile and said, "Although the tickets to the Chaotic Source World are difficult to get, I can get five or six more. Zen, you don't have to worry about that."
<br><br>
Sally, Hutton, and the other members of the Nine Li race beamed at Athemar's response. They didn't expect that he would agree so easily.
<br><br>
After their discussion, Ambrose told Zen about the situation of the Nine Li race's remaining members to let him have a general understanding of it.
<br><br>
It turned out that the situation of the Nine Li race was even worse than Zen had imagined. Almost all of the race's important inheritances were destroyed. After the Bearing race had defeated them, some of their clansmen even used a few forbidden secret methods to change their blood, and cut off their ties to the Nine Li race. Meanwhile, all the other races that had once surrendered to the Nine Li race launched counterattacks.
<br><br>
"In reality, we have long lost hope. Leopold found us after a great deal of effort, but I scolded him. Chiyou sent the divine land away after he went through many hardships. Why should we bring it back? Leopold shouldn't have brought you back to the Source World," said Ambrose regretfully. "I didn't expect that Lorena would have such an excellent son. It's a pity that I can do nothing to help you."
<br><br>
Sally and Hutton had previously told Ambrose what Zen had done on the Other Shore, and in that moment, he felt hopeful. Now that he had confirmed Zen's identity, he felt as if victory was in sight.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished his words, he bowed and said goodbye to Athemar.
<br><br>
He stood up and beckoned his companions to leave. Athemar saw them off.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he just stood there and balled his fists. He had seen the statues of the nine chieftains in the divine land. All of them were strong and powerful. Today, however, Ambrose was quite different from the statue in the divine land.
<br><br>
Although Zen had already known that the Nine Li race had declined, he couldn't help but feel sad. He cried out, "Grandpa Ambrose."
<br><br>
Ambrose and the others paused. They turned around and smiled at Zen.
<br><br>
"I will rebuild the Nine Li race in your lifetime," Zen said seriously.
<br><br>
A wild laugh escaped from Ambrose's lips. Then he croaked, "I have been cursed, and I'm dying. I hope you can fulfill this promise!"
<br><br>
Then he, Leopold, and the others left the Splendid Palace without another word.
<br><br>
Chapter 3346 Arrangement Only Sally, Hutton, and a few other young members of the Nine Li race were left in the Splendid Palace.
<br><br>
Although it was the first time they had personally met, Zen could feel a sense of kinship with them, coming from the same race.
<br><br>
Ambrose had entrusted them to him. He was sure to take good care of them.
<br><br>
"Zen, can you really do it? Can you rebuild the Nine Li race?" Sally asked, blinking her wide, innocent eyes.
<br><br>
Growing up, she had heard about the past glory of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Back then, there was no need for their people to find different places to hide. Every time worship day arrived, over ten thousand other races came to worship.
<br><br>
If Chiyou was angered, the entire Source World would tremble.
<br><br>
But this glory mostly existed only in Sally's imagination. If only Zen could really make it become a reality.
<br><br>
She was the youngest and most naive of them, after all.
<br><br>
But Hutton and the others didn't think so.
<br><br>
It wasn't that they doubted Zen's strength and talent, but they felt that such a great promise just could not be fulfilled.
<br><br>
Chiyou was truly formidable.
<br><br>
But in the end, he fell into defeat by the hands of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were no weaker than the Nine Li race in their prime. Even the Oneness Sky Palace didn't dare to act rashly against them. It could only be wishful thinking to consider Zen fighting them all alone.
<br><br>
"Sally, don't take it too seriously. You're daydreaming if you really expect the Nine Li race to rise like it did back then. These are different times," said a young man beside her.
<br><br>
"Umar!" Hutton called him out with a frown.
<br><br>
Umar was one of the best members of the Nine Li race that Ambrose had brought here.
<br><br>
"Am I wrong? The Grand Chieftain was once so powerful. But the Yellow Emperor defeated him too easily! Sure, Zen is powerful, but only within our generation. Is he capable of leading our entire race up the ranks? There's no way!" The atmosphere grew grim. Pausing for a moment, Umar continued, "He's just lucky to have outshone us on the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
"Shut up! Don't forget who Zen is!" Hutton's face darkened.
<br><br>
On their way here, Leopold had told them that Zen's blood was much purer than theirs.
<br><br>
If the Nine Li race hadn't declined, he would have gone up higher than them in status.
<br><br>
"So what? The Nine Li race has declined. His identity and status no longer matter!" Umar continued his argument.
<br><br>
"Do you think it was because of our grandfather that Master Athemar was willing to accept us and help us get a ticket to the Chaotic Source World?"
<br><br>
Flames burned in Hutton's eyes as he stared Umar down.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the super forces, the Nine Li race was worthless. Their former honor and glory were things of the past.
<br><br>
It was thanks to Zen that the Oneness Sky Palace was willing to help them enter the Chaotic Source World. It definitely wasn't for Ambrose's sake.
<br><br>
"Remember! Zen will be our young master from today forward!" Hutton said fiercely.
<br><br>
Umar was still not convinced. "You want me to call him young master? Why? Is he stronger than I am?"
<br><br>
After that, the aura in his body surged, and a statue of a fiendish beast appeared before him. It was his Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
On the way there, Sally and Hutton had been boasting about Thad's strength on the Other Shore. But now that Umar met him, he doubted Sally and Hutton's claims about his strength. Finally, he decided to challenge Zen and display his Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
The statue was a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
Once it was activated, a malicious aura spread all over the Splendid Palace.
<br><br>
Before the others could stop him, Umar turned into a gust of wind and rushed toward Zen, chopping down on his head with a single push of his palm.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
Being Ambrose's grandson, Umar was indeed a gifted man. The Other Shore Power he had extracted from the statue reached 900 divine megatons.
<br><br>
If struck by his palm, even a mountain would break in half, let alone a mere person.
<br><br>
"Umar! Don't do it!"
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
Everyone was taken aback and wide-eyed. They knew that Umar had a strange temper, but they were all told not to stir up any trouble on their way there. Little did they expect Umar to provoke Zen the minute Ambrose left them.
<br><br>
Sally and her brother had witnessed Zen's strength on the Other Shore, but it was completely different from the Source World. No one could tell whether or not he'd manage to resist Umar's strike.
<br><br>
"900 divine megatons. That is good in Stage Thirteen."
<br><br>
Zen's face remained dead-calm. He didn't even bother to shift his feet. With a raise of his hand, the Shade Stone liquid attached itself to his right arm.
<br><br>
Then, he slightly tilted his wrist and had Umar's hand precisely in his grasp.
<br><br>
Puff! The Splendid Palace shook slightly before a fist-sized area cracked open right under Zen's feet. With that, Umar's fierce blow was stopped.
<br><br>
Zen's grip was iron-tight. Umar couldn't twist his hand out of it.
<br><br>
The sight had everyone holding their breath.
<br><br>
On the way there, Leopold had announced that if Zen made it to Stage Thirteen on the Other Shore, his strength must be far greater than that of his peers. Back then, Umar only snorted at the exaggeration. The others weren't totally convinced either. But now, it seemed that even Leopold had greatly underestimated Zen.
<br><br>
Even after taking Umar's all-out strike with a single hand, Zen was completely unharmed. No one there could even imagine finding someone on the same level of strength.
<br><br>
An exasperated sigh broke the silence. Hutton turned to Zen and said, "Zen, please forgive Umar's rudeness."
<br><br>
Still indifferent, Zen merely let go of the man's hand. He looked up to the ceiling of the Splendid Palace and said, "We're all from the same race, so I will forgive him. Our people are facing a great decline, so we have to keep working harder. Grandpa Ambrose has entrusted all of you to me. I only have one request." He looked firmly at the group before continuing, "Don't ever give yourselves up."
<br><br>
Hutton, Umar, and the rest looked at him complicatedly.
<br><br>
The small world they had been hiding in was haunted by the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Neither the elders nor the younger generation were courageous enough.
<br><br>
They ended up giving themselves away gradually.
<br><br>
During his time in the Oneness Sky Palace, Zen did not forget where he came from. He was confident by nature. The others could sense his genuine pride and suddenly felt ashamed of themselves.
<br><br>
"Zen can make it happen. I choose to believe it!" Sally chimed in eagerly.
<br><br>
"I believe it too," Hutton agreed.
<br><br>
"Soon, our Nine Li race will rise again!" And with that, the rest of them echoed with them.
<br><br>
After sending Ambrose away, Athemar turned back to Zen and the rest. "I'll send you up the Oneness Mountain first. Please follow me."
<br><br>
It was the first time that the youth of the Nine Li race had left their elders. It was rather nerve-wracking to follow behind Athemar in silence.
<br><br>
Standing on Athemar's huge sword, they looked curiously down at the Dragon City and the great mountains in the distance.
<br><br>
Ever since they could remember, they had nestled in such a small world.
<br><br>
Never had they really explored the vast Source World. It was their first time stepping outside and witnessing first-hand the size of a super force.
<br><br>
Once they returned to the Flow Sword Sect, Athemar had applied for an independent courtyard house where he had the six members of the Nine Li race settle down.
<br><br>
Even then, their background was sensitive. Although the Flow Sword Sect was the Oneness Sky Palace's core area, Athemar had especially warned them to keep their identity hidden. If they needed anything, they had to turn to Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3347 Treatment It was a good thing that the several members of the Nine Li race didn't need to cultivate the Flow Strike, so there was no need for them to go out.
<br><br>
For most of the time, they would put their Souls of Light on the Other Shore and cultivated there.
<br><br>
When Zen had first met with Sally, the girl had been upset about how she could get two thousand soul pills.
<br><br>
That meant the remaining members of the Nine Li race lacked money and therefore, it wasn't easy for them to improve their Souls of Light to reach Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
After the six members of the Nine Li race had settled down, Zen ordered them to enter the Other Shore the next day.
<br><br>
The order confused Sally and Hutton a little. They wondered what Zen wanted to do.
<br><br>
"You are the members of my race, so you may take all of this as a gift from me," Zen spoke.
<br><br>
Then, he took out 30 finger-size chunks of soul crystal from the Sumeru Space. When divided, each of the six of them could naturally get five finger-size chunks of soul crystal.
<br><br>
A chill ran down Sally's, Hutton's, and Umar's spines as soon as they sensed the pure aura that emanated from the soul crystal.
<br><br>
They knew that Zen's physical body was so powerful that he could do anything he liked on the Other Shore, and that it wasn't difficult for him to obtain some Other Shore Tokens and soul crystal. Even then, it still shocked them to see him casually take out 30 finger-size chunks of soul crystal and just give them to them.
<br><br>
Last time, they had entered the Grand Sky Temple and offered those soul pills which had been raised by the elders of their race after they had sold an Other Shore Token to the Ear Mouse race.
<br><br>
Now, the 30 finger-size chunks of soul crystal were worth 30 million soul pills, and it was absolutely impossible to buy so many chunks of soul crystal with even 30 million soul pills! "Young master... The gift is too precious," Hutton muttered, his eyes glued to the soul crystal.
<br><br>
He had indeed thought of refusing, but any Soul of Light that cultivated on the Other Shore couldn't resist such a temptation. After all, the soul crystal was almost the same as cultivation of the Soul of Light. Their soul cultivation could improve according to the amount of the soul crystal they absorbed.
<br><br>
"When I first entered the Source World, I also wanted to search for the members of the Nine Li race, but the Source World is too large. At that time, my cultivation base was low and I could not find anyone. After that, I have stayed in the Oneness Sky Palace to cultivate until now. I have made some achievements. I am glad to meet you all and give you the gift. If the rest members of the Nine Li race have any difficulty, please tell me. I will do my best to help all of you," said Zen.
<br><br>
He knew that if he wanted to rebuild the Nine Li race, he would have to put a great amount of effort for it. Compared to that task, what he gave to the members of the Nine Li race was really nothing.
<br><br>
After Zen had given them the soul crystal, he went back to his own house.
<br><br>
A member from the Phoenix Palace informed him that Flamine invited him to meet her.
<br><br>
As for Elvinia, it had been more than ten days since she was taken away.
<br><br>
Zen didn't know her situation, but since Flamine invited him now, he quickly rushed to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
The last time he left the Phoenix Palace, Flamine had already given him the token to enter it. This time, he naturally didn't need to break the fog with his Eye of Will.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before he arrived. After he entered the Phoenix Palace, a maid ushered him into a palace on the side.
<br><br>
When he arrived at the door of the palace, however, he heard Elvinia's loud screams from inside. "Get out of the way! I want to get out!"
<br><br>
In the palace, golden chains made of flames twined around Elvinia's hands and feet.
<br><br>
No matter how much she struggled, the chains firmly locked her and she couldn't move at all.
<br><br>
Several servants in the palace kept encouraging her, but they all looked distressed for her.
<br><br>
"How... How could this be?" Zen asked with a frown.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine has used many ways to treat Princess Elvinia, but they didn't work. She clamors to leave every day, and she just made Lady Flamine so angry that she left," the maid answered.
<br><br>
"It doesn't work well..."
<br><br>
It was well known that an injury on the soul was truly difficult to cure.
<br><br>
After last time when Milo had used the taboo method, he still hadn't returned to the Flow Sword Sect yet.
<br><br>
When Zen and Elvinia returned, Flamine was confident about curing Elvinia. Zen also thought that it might not be that hard to cure her, but he didn't expect that there was no progress at all these days.
<br><br>
Elvinia still struggled, but she couldn't do whatever she wanted because she was not on the Other Shore now.
<br><br>
Zen walked towards her. Elvinia, who had been burning with anger, was stunned to see him. Her hysterical shouts quickly calmed down at the sight of him. She looked at him and pleaded, "Zen, you are here! Take me out of here! My mother wants to kill me!"
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine is your mother. Why would she want to kill you?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"She wants to kill me!" Elvinia repeated firmly. At that moment, Zen didn't notice that Flamine was already behind him until she spoke.
<br><br>
"I've been trying to get rid of the messy memories in her mind, but a considerable amount of memories have been integrated into her Memory Flame and become a part of her."
<br><br>
It wasn't hard for Flamine to remove memories, but the purified being's memories had been integrated with Elvinia. Deleting those memories would be equal to destroying Elvinia. That was why Elvinia believed that Flamine wanted to kill her, but in reality, Flamine only wanted to remove the memories of Teague.
<br><br>
In Elvinia's point of view though, she still believed that her mother intended to kill her.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, why did you invite me to come over?" asked Zen. Although Zen had controlled the Reincarnation Land in divine land, his method of dealing with or curing souls was far off from Flamine's advanced techniques.
<br><br>
He didn't think he could help much. Yet, she still summoned him, so there had to be a reason.
<br><br>
"I have to remove the memories when she is awake, but those messy memories which don't belong to her are hidden in the deepest part of her Memory Flame. I can't dig them out," said Flamine.
<br><br>
When Elvinia became a purified being, she didn't recognize or talk to anyone except for Zen. After careful consideration, Flamine decided to ask Zen for help.
<br><br>
She had planned to invite him to help her since the very beginning, but she realized that he had just gotten out of the Other Shore. Thus, she waited for a few more days.
<br><br>
"I will try my best to do what I can," Zen promised.
<br><br>
He knew he also had to take some responsibility for Elvinia's bad situation, though back then, Elvinia insisted on entering the Grand Sky Temple and he couldn't stop her.
<br><br>
Then again, the only reason Zen was able to leave the Dark Region was because he had Elvinia to rely on.
<br><br>
When Zen had agreed to help Flamine, she left the palace for a moment and came back with three old men.
<br><br>
The three old men quietly took their respective positions, and then a big array on the ground began to flash.
<br><br>
The appearance of the light horrified Elvinia, who had just calmed down.
<br><br>
"Zen, they want to kill me again! Kill them for me!"
<br><br>
Of course, Zen knew that such a kind of fear was out of instinct, but the pleading look on her face made him sympathize with her.
<br><br>
Zen sat up straight in front of Elvinia and asked, "Who are you?"
<br><br>
"I'm Elvinia!" she exclaimed. Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
"You are not Elvinia. If you are, you won't be afraid," he said.
<br><br>
"I'm not Elvinia?" She was a little confused by Zen's words. "Then who am I?"
<br><br>
"You are Teague, a creature from the Dark Region. I have destroyed your race! I am the one who killed all of the pig-faced monsters," Zen gravely said.
<br><br>
Teague's memories only occupied a small part of Elvinia's memories. If Zen hadn't mentioned such things, Elvinia wouldn't have remembered them. He had verified it in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
So when Zen mentioned that one memory, some of Teague's memories flashed through Elvinia's mind. It wouldn't be so easy for Teague to forget the fact that his race had been destroyed, nor could he simply set aside his resentment for Zen.
<br><br>
Elvinia's pretty face suddenly turned ferocious, as if she wanted to swallow him. "How dare you destroy my race! I'll kill you!" she roared.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen quickly said to Flamine, "Lady Flamine, it's the time!"
<br><br>
Delight filled Flamine's eyes. How could she be willing to miss this opportunity? She winked at the three old men, and the array in the palace was fully activated. Then, Flamine's hand transformed into a claw and covered Elvinia's head.
<br><br>
Chapter 3348 Counterattack It wouldn't have been wise to make Elvinia angry were they on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But they were in the Phoenix Palace now. Here, no holds were barred.
<br><br>
With Zen's stimulation, Teague's memories, hidden in the depths of Elvinia's mind and body, were drawn out in a steady stream.
<br><br>
"Puny humans! The Blood Assembly will grind you into minced meat soon enough! I..."
<br><br>
Elvinia's voice changed. The blood power in her body started to burn, wisps of golden flames threatening to flare out. The fact that her inner world was emitting energy like this was a dangerous signal.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, be careful. Her inner world may explode!" Zen reminded.
<br><br>
If Elvinia's inner world exploded, Zen and Flamine wouldn't be hurt, but Elvinia would die.
<br><br>
Flamine only scoffed.
<br><br>
She seemed to have been prepared for this. She touched Elvinia's belly with her hand. The energy that was gathering in Elvinia's belly faded away instantly.
<br><br>
Then she flicked Elvinia's head several times. Rays of light shot out from her fingers and drilled into Elvinia's black hair.
<br><br>
Elvinia held her head and screamed as the agony grew more intense.
<br><br>
"It's time. Now!" Flamine barked out.
<br><br>
The three old men closed their eyes, and the array became more powerful.
<br><br>
Flamine then dragged out some wisps of white light from Elvinia's head.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Dragging the white light, Flamine stepped back into the center of the array and pressed her hand on the ground.
<br><br>
The wisps of white light interwove together, turning into a milky white flame.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the white flame, his eyebrows raised. "It's the Memory Flame."
<br><br>
The white flame was very dim, but still emitted a fierce aura. It was clearly the Memory Flame Teague had left in Elvinia's soul. Flamine had extracted it using a technique Zen had never encountered before.
<br><br>
"Hurry up! Seal the Memory Flame!" Flamine ordered.
<br><br>
She knew that with Teague being a purified being, his Memory Flame must contain some very precious memories. Memories about the Blood Assembly alone would be very valuable. So she wanted to leave them to Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
However, just then, the flame started to blur and turn into Teague's original form.
<br><br>
As soon as he was fully materialized, Teague only sneered before disappearing.
<br><br>
The faces of Flamine and the three old men fell. The Memory Flame disappeared so fast that they weren't able to seal it up.
<br><br>
Elvinia, dripping with sweat, finally collapsed to the ground, her arms still strung up by the fire chains.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, could you put Elvinia down now?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Flamine turned around, her face softening.
<br><br>
They might have failed to seal the Memory Flame, but at least Teague's damned memories were out of Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia fortunately didn't lose her memories, but her memories had been a jumbled mess after mixing with Teague's.
<br><br>
It would return to normal eventually once all the chaos was resolved.
<br><br>
With a flick of Flamine's finger, the two fire chains disappeared. She walked over to help Elvinia up and then turned to Zen with a smile. "She'll be okay, thanks to you. I've done extractions many times before, but that pig-faced monster was pretty sly. I couldn't get him out."
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, you are being too polite. I did nothing," Zen replied with a smile.
<br><br>
"I'll take Elvinia to rest. You seldom come to the Phoenix Palace. Do you want to visit your...friends?" Flamine asked, giving Zen a meaningful look.
<br><br>
She stressed the word "friend" on purpose.
<br><br>
She was a smart woman. She knew that the relationship between Zen and Laquisha and the other two wasn't just friendship.
<br><br>
By experience, she knew it was normal for a man to have several concubines. Flamine herself was not the only concubine of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, after all.
<br><br>
What mattered to her was Zen's principal wife, Letitia. She had even privately asked Laquisha about her once.
<br><br>
Elvinia was Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter. If she married Zen, her status would still be very important.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in response to Flamine's question.
<br><br>
Since he had come to the Phoenix Palace, he must pay a visit to his wives.
<br><br>
Elvinia had mentioned to Zen that Laquisha was beset with an unusual condition. Her affliction had caused a fire in the Phoenix Palace, prompting Elvinia to arrange an independent palace for her.
<br><br>
Laquisha's preternatural flame was called Sprite Fire. Only those who had the Fire Crow's blood could get it.
<br><br>
Flamine ordered a maid to take Zen to the Heavenly Cultivation Palace in the north part of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
A commotion was currently breaking out at the open space in front of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.
<br><br>
Dozens of people had gathered around the cause at the center of it all: a tall woman and a young man facing off in apparent combat, except the former was simply evading the latter.
<br><br>
The young man and the tall woman had just entered the Sea of Truth, and had not merged with any Other Shore Token. Their cultivation levels were about the same, but the man's martial arts were obviously much stronger than those of the woman.
<br><br>
The tall woman wouldn't dare to fight head-on and could only resort to dodging attacks.
<br><br>
"This courtyard is only over a hundred feet wide. You can't run forever!"
<br><br>
The young man waved the long sword in his hand toward the tall woman.
<br><br>
When the tall woman saw this, a fierce look suddenly appeared in her eyes.
<br><br>
This time, instead of retreating, she flipped the long blood-red sword in her hand. If she had to die, then so be it. But she was bringing him with her.
<br><br>
"Lavender! Don't risk it!"
<br><br>
"It's okay to lose! We can just leave the Phoenix Palace!"
<br><br>
Laquisha and Nelly cried out, turning pale.
<br><br>
The tall woman was Lavender, and the man challenging her was called Ahmad, a direct descendant of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Under the protection of Elvinia, Laquisha, Nelly and Lavender received more resources than many direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace, even more so after Laquisha was given a palace to herself.
<br><br>
This apparent special treatment made the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace jealous and resentful.
<br><br>
Everything would have been fine if Elvinia had been at the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
She was the most outstanding among the young generation in the Oneness Mountain, and enjoyed Eastern Emperor Taiyi's love. No one could outshine her.
<br><br>
But Elvinia had been away for quite some time now. The news that she was trapped on the Other Shore spread throughout the Phoenix Palace. Many people thought she wouldn't come back.
<br><br>
As time passed, the direct descendants started coming up with some evil ideas.
<br><br>
And so Ahmad was sent to anger the three women.
<br><br>
Lavender knew what the direct descendants were up to. She had quite the temper, and she was now starting to lose control of it. Although they were trying hard not to engage, the direct descendants kept provoking them deliberately. They had no choice but to fight back.
<br><br>
Lavender's strength was inferior to Ahmad's, so she had been at a disadvantage since the fight began.
<br><br>
But she was much more experienced in battle. She noticed that Ahmad was avoiding anything life-threatening, so she fought back with deadly moves.
<br><br>
Before long, she had taken the upper hand.
<br><br>
Chapter 3349 Get Into Trouble Ahmad grew increasingly flustered when he faced the deadly momentum of Lavender's sword strikes.
<br><br>
When two powerful warriors confronted each other in a neck and neck battle, it was hard to decide which one would overpower the other. But now, it seemed it was hard for him to turn the tables in his favor since his momentum wavered compared to his opponent.
<br><br>
Ahmad should have easily defeated Lavender had it not been for her fierce attack.
<br><br>
"What's going on? Ahmad's strength far surpasses that of the woman, but how come he is no match for her?"
<br><br>
"We'll make a fool of ourselves today!"
<br><br>
"This woman is crazy. She has no regard for her life. She's cheating!"
<br><br>
exclaimed the frustrated direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Nelly and Lavender shared the same personality traits, so it wasn't hard for her to understand Lavender's actions.
<br><br>
Overhearing the disrespectful comments of these direct descendants, Nelly retorted curtly, "Every warrior fights with their life on the line in every battle they take part in. If you have never experienced it, you have no right to say she is cheating. It's ridiculous!"
<br><br>
Only after the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace had entered the Other Shore would they experience this world in all its cruelty.
<br><br>
Even in the early stages of the Other Shore, they probably couldn't understand it. After all, they would be under the protection of the Oneness Sky Palace's temple after reaching Stage Four.
<br><br>
Among the many obvious examples was Elvinia. She managed to pass twelve stages and reach Stage Thirteen without a hitch. Only until she stepped foot in the Dark Region, did she realize what it felt like to have a near-death experience.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Under the heat of Lavender's relentless attacks, Ahmad flinched constantly.
<br><br>
After a while, he stabilized his steps and gained back his lost control. He reached out for his long sword and gave it a swift flick. In response to his gesture, it produced nine sword shadows in front of him.
<br><br>
"Nine-world Mantra Sword!"
<br><br>
The Nine-world Mantra Sword was a supreme swordsmanship manual. It was exclusively taught to the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Even the disciples who had just entered the Other Shore could flaunt tremendous power by using it.
<br><br>
Although Lavender had also practiced swordsmanship in her youth, she had been more used to using a long spear as a weapon before she entered the Source World, which was why she had to start from scratch when she came to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
If she didn't defeat Ahmad now, she might never get another opportunity to do so! "Broken World! Original World! Orchid World!"
<br><br>
Ahmad stood his ground and kept advancing towards her effortlessly. He showed no signs of backing down; his movements were flawless.
<br><br>
Even though Lavender tried her best to land an effective sword strike, each of her attacks was easily deflected by Ahmad. Due to countless failed attempts, she was forced to take a step back each time. She was unable to lay a single scratch on him.
<br><br>
Watching Ahmad regain his strong position in the battle, the direct descendants began to cheer him on.
<br><br>
"That's it, Ahmad! Hang in there!"
<br><br>
"If you win over this woman, they will be forced to leave!"
<br><br>
"Woman, with talents like yours, you don't deserve what the Phoenix Palace offers!"
<br><br>
Hearing them encourage Ahmad and mock her in the background only made Lavender feel more inferior to him. Her expression darkened as she bit her lip and glared back at Ahmad.
<br><br>
She had been giving it her all, but she still lacked the required strength to defeat him. Ahmad's swordsmanship was just too flawless to counter.
<br><br>
"Swift World! Crossing World!"
<br><br>
Ahmad's sword force grew more and more ferocious with time. It was like a monster, slowly opening its mouth to reveal its countless hidden fangs.
<br><br>
"Annihilation World!"
<br><br>
He looked up with fiery eyes and slashed his sword at Lavender relentlessly. As she watched the upcoming attack in close range, her face began to lose its color.
<br><br>
"Lavender, let it go! Just surrender, it's okay!"
<br><br>
"It's not that big of a deal. It's fine. We can just leave the Phoenix Palace!"
<br><br>
Laquisha and Nelly shouted their pleas helplessly at her.
<br><br>
However, deep down, Lavender knew it all too well; she would be unable to deflect this sword strike. Even if she tried, she wouldn't be able to dodge this one in time. If the sword were to pierce through her, she would suffer irreversible damage, even if she didn't die from it.
<br><br>
Just as the sword charged ruthlessly towards her, two fingers appeared out of nowhere and clasped the blade securely in their grip.
<br><br>
Under the severe pressure coming from the fingers, the blade caved in.
<br><br>
Cracks resembling cobwebs formed on the edge of Ahmad's sword, and it was crushed! Bracing for impact, Lavender didn't dare turn around to see who intervened.
<br><br>
But as soon as she saw the hand that foiled the strike, a longing smile appeared on her face. In an instant, she turned around and embraced Zen into a tight hug.
<br><br>
Upon seeing Zen, Laquisha and Nelly jumped in excitement and rushed to his side.
<br><br>
"Who the hell are you? And how dare you break my sword!"
<br><br>
His expressions screamed anger and confusion when Ahmad watched his sword get smashed between the two fingers.
<br><br>
Zen eyed him up expressionlessly and asked, "Lavender, why were you fighting with him?"
<br><br>
By the time Zen arrived, Lavender had moved into a dead end from retreating continuously. The intense battle between them could by no means be compared to simple sparring.
<br><br>
Lavender didn't like depending on other people to protect her. She didn't want to count on Zen to stand up for her each time she was backed into a corner. She replied in a calm tone, "Don't worry. It's nothing."
<br><br>
However, Nelly stepped up and briefed Zen all about it. "These people want to force us out of the Phoenix Palace. They've been trying to provoke us these past few days!"
<br><br>
Hearing the explanation, Zen understood the matter and gave a slight nod.
<br><br>
"We have all the right to do so. Our Phoenix Palace only accepts direct descendants as disciples. These three women should not be the exception.
<br><br>
How can they be so lucky as to be allowed to cultivate here?"
<br><br>
"They even take up resources that are rightfully ours…"
<br><br>
"Yes, we only have enough for ourselves…"
<br><br>
The direct descendants lodged numerous complaints one after the other.
<br><br>
Zen's cultivation base far exceeded theirs, but they weren't intimidated by him. Besides, no one would dare to touch them as long as they remained in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
However, they were unaware of the fact that Zen had defeated Elvinia in this very place just a few months ago.
<br><br>
Closely listening to their complaints, Zen nodded agreeably and gave them a gentle smile. He turned to Lavender and said, "Since that's the case, let's leave."
<br><br>
Before coming to the Phoenix Palace, Lavender, Laquisha and Nelly cultivated peacefully in the Dragon City. However, Elvinia had insisted on them coming here instead. Zen didn't value the resources available in the Phoenix Palace at all, so he thought it was fine the three women left here.
<br><br>
The three women had developed a healthy relationship with Elvinia over time. Since Elvinia was away from the Phoenix Place at the moment, they had no reason to stay either, so they agreed obediently to leave with Zen.
<br><br>
"So, it's decided. Let's go back to pack up our belongings. We'll leave here,"
<br><br>
Nelly said as she shot a cold glare at the arrogant direct descendants.
<br><br>
Just as Zen turned to leave with them, he was stopped by Ahmad, who shouted, "Just wait a minute there. Do you honestly think you can just walk out of here after you broke my Nine-world Mantra Sword?"
<br><br>
As a direct descendant of the Phoenix Palace, he had always thought of himself to be superior to others.
<br><br>
Moreover, he had close connections with the higher-ups of the Phoenix Palace. Ahmad's mother, Lady Jean, enjoyed a high position in the Phoenix Palace, while his elder brother was gifted with immense strength and belonged to the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
It didn't matter even if he had not reached the Other Shore. His status and connections made him a respectable figure in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
It boiled his blood how Zen had just waltzed in between his battle when he was about to defeat Lavender. Moreover, Zen had smashed his Nine-world Mantra Sword into pieces. There was no way he could allow Zen to get away with it all now.
<br><br>
"Then what do you want me to do? Do you want me to offer you another sword to replace that one?" A smile of discontent appeared on Zen's face.
<br><br>
In response to Zen's statement, Ahmad laughed viciously and stated, "Do I look like the sort of person who would care about a sword? You're highly mistaken if you think you can destroy my sword just because you are stronger in cultivation base than me. My elder brother's cultivation base is higher than yours. Does that mean he can crush you just the same?"
<br><br>
Naturally, Ahmad was unable to challenge Zen since he hadn't broken through to the Other Shore Realm yet.
<br><br>
Zen was a lot tougher in comparison. But his elder brother, Chance, happened to be in the Phoenix Palace at this very moment. Ahmad had already informed him of the situation through a communication token. It would only be a matter of time before Chance made his appearance on the scene. And of course, he was coming to avenge the insult his little brother had to face because of Zen.
<br><br>
Ahmad was less than twenty years old. In Zen's eyes, he was no better than a naive child. How could he pay any heed to the empty claims of a child? Just as Zen grabbed Lavender's hand and prepared to leave, another person appeared at the entrance of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.
<br><br>
This man had a dark skin tone, and his arms were long and significantly bulky. His eyes gave the sharpened vibe of a viper as he stared in Zen's direction.
<br><br>
He stepped into the Heavenly Cultivation Palace and stationed himself in front of Zen to block his path. There were traces of disdain smeared across his charred-black face as he glared at him. "Which one of these people crushed your sword, Ahmad?"
<br><br>
The man who stood before them was Chance, Ahmad's big brother.
<br><br>
"It's him! He crushed my sword! And he's not a member of the Phoenix Palace either!"
<br><br>
Ahmad blurted out as he pointed at Zen. He peered over at Zen's face to observe his reaction to the situation.
<br><br>
He had expected Zen's face to turn as white as a sheet when faced with his big brother. After all, Chance had entered the Land of Sword Grief and was a cultivator of the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
However, Zen's reaction had disappointed him. He showed no signs of shock as his expression remained unchanged. To address the matter maturely, Zen spoke in a calm tone, "While it's good to spar with each other sometimes, you should not encourage your brother's behavior when it's wrong. Your brother was about to kill Lavender. I had no other choice but to stop him."
<br><br>
A warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm was naturally stronger than Zen. His cultivation base and restraint were not to be underestimated.
<br><br>
However, Chance shook off Zen's attempts to dissolve the issue between them. The corners of his mouth turned into a sinister smile as he said, "The woman you defended is not a direct descendant of the Phoenix Palace, so it doesn't matter if she's dead. As an outsider, how dare you stop my brother and break his sword? You must have a death wish."
<br><br>
Chapter 3350 A Head-To-Head Battle The blood of Eastern Emperor Taiyi ran through all the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Their status rested on a combination of blood, talent, and strength.
<br><br>
Chance was slightly inferior to Elvinia in terms of talent, but he had been strong enough to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Those who had entered the Land of Sword Grief didn't take the ordinary disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace seriously. Moreover, Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly weren't from the direct line of the Phoenix Palace, so Chance thought it wouldn't really matter if he killed them.
<br><br>
As for Zen, Chance only knew that he was the core disciple of a certain mountain.
<br><br>
But whichever mountain Zen was from, Chance decided it didn't matter. He wasn't afraid of Zen at all.
<br><br>
Chance was unaware of the degree to which Zen had refrained from showing his true power in the Phoenix Palace. Zen had restrained himself because he didn't want to make trouble. Although Ahmad had almost killed Lavender, Zen didn't take revenge.
<br><br>
However, when Zen heard Chance's words, anger flashed in his eyes.
<br><br>
The direct descendants of Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked proud and scornful.
<br><br>
They thought it was unforgivably bold for an outsider like Zen to interfere in the affairs of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Regardless of how powerful Zen was, he was no match for him. He had crushed Ahmad's sword, but now that Chance was here, he was about to be defeated.
<br><br>
Ahmed became more arrogant with his brother's support. He said to Zen, "You are a mere disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace. How dare you come here to flaunt your prowess. Is it because the Phoenix Palace has always kept a low profile?"
<br><br>
The other disciples nodded vigorously, agreeing with Ahmed. "Indeed! What a display of rudeness and arrogance!"
<br><br>
"No one is allowed to come to the Phoenix Palace without permission."
<br><br>
The direct descendants present had felt more secure since Chance arrived.
<br><br>
They felt that with Chance, they were superior to Zen.
<br><br>
A few of them recognized Zen from his fight with Elvinia in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. But since Elvinia had not yet reached the Chaotic Source Realm, they believed she was much weaker than Chance.
<br><br>
Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly looked upset. Nelly tugged at Zen's sleeve and said, "Let's go."
<br><br>
Zen didn't move. He knew that even if he had been inclined to leave, the disciples of the Phoenix Palace wouldn't let him go without a fight. So he gently removed Nelly's hand and turned to Chance. Calmly he said, "You're right. I do have a death wish. Let's fight."
<br><br>
Chance lifted a long black eyebrow in surprise.
<br><br>
Given Zen's cultivation base, he should have understood the importance of reaching the Chaotic Source Realm, as Chance had done. Moreover, the Chaotic Source World was about to open soon. Zen clearly knew that Chance was powerful enough to beat him. And yet, Zen dared to challenge him to a fight. Either he was an idiot or he had something up his sleeve.
<br><br>
"You want a fight?" Chance asked, laughing as though Zen had told a very funny joke. "What makes you think I'd even bother? You're not qualified to fight me."
<br><br>
The other Phoenix Palace disciples joined in Chance's laughter.
<br><br>
They were all familiar with the vast difference in the level of strength between the warriors who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm and those who had not. Chance was stronger than anyone present, including Zen. But apparently Zen didn't understand that. They thought he was being ridiculous.
<br><br>
"Chance, teach him a lesson," one of the disciples called out.
<br><br>
"Right! Show him he's making a mistake!"
<br><br>
"Make him sorry he ever came here!"
<br><br>
Zen scowled. His eyes had narrowed dangerously at the repeated taunts of the disciples. He turned to Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly, and said quietly to them, "Back off. Give me some space."
<br><br>
"Zen, what are you planning?" Lavender murmured, looking concerned.
<br><br>
Like everyone else, the three women had heard of the incredible strength of the warriors who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. The bodies and souls of such warriors had been greatly enhanced. Indeed, it could be argued that they had transformed altogether into a different, stronger being.
<br><br>
Lavender, Laquisha, and Nelly had always trusted in Zen's strength. But this wasn't the divine land. It was the Source World, and here, there were plenty of mighty warriors from various sects and races.
<br><br>
Zen saw her expression and smiled to ease her fear. "Don't worry, all right?"
<br><br>
Lavender nodded and retreated with Laquisha and Nelly. Zen's confidence was a relief. It renewed their faith in his strength.
<br><br>
At a gesture from Chance, Ahmad and the other direct descendants of Phoenix Palace also stepped back. Zen and Chance stood alone in the middle of a wide, empty space.
<br><br>
Since he had reached the Chaotic Source Realm, Chance had never bothered to fight anyone who hadn't. In his opinion, the warriors at the Other Shore Realm were all beneath him, and it would be demeaning to fight them. But today, for his brother's sake, he would set that aside and teach Zen a lesson.
<br><br>
He was absolutely confident in his own superiority. He thought he'd be able to beat Zen within seconds.
<br><br>
"Let's get this over with," he said, sneering. "It will be a shame if anyone in the Land of Sword Grief realizes that I'm fighting with a junior like you."
<br><br>
Without further ado, he lunged forward and threw a punch at Zen.
<br><br>
After undergoing the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, his fist was a weapon in itself, a fore to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
The power behind his punch was as explosive as a volcanic eruption.
<br><br>
Indeed, that single punch should be enough to kill Zen if it landed.
<br><br>
Chance expected Zen to try to dodge the punch, and readied himself to strike again. To his astonishment, however, Zen just stood there without budging.
<br><br>
Chance felt a stab of confusion. Why was this man so confident? Was there something he hadn't seen? Something that made Zen more dangerous than he seemed? Chance's arm drove forward. In response, Zen lifted his hand to grasp his fist. The Shade Stone liquid surged in Zen's body, and his spine and arm turned dark.
<br><br>
The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace chattered to each other with excitement and anticipation, wondering what would happen next.
<br><br>
"Doesn't he know how terrifying a warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm is?"
<br><br>
"That one punch is enough to kill him if it's a direct hit!"
<br><br>
"He's trying to block the punch with his bare hand! He's crazy!"
<br><br>
Everyone stared with wide eyes as Chance's fist smashed into Zen's palm.
<br><br>
There was a crisp, thunderous clapping sound.
<br><br>
The disciples closed their eyes and raised their hands instinctively to protect their ears at the deafening boom of the impact.
<br><br>
The power of the collision spread outwards in all direction, tearing through everything in its way. The onlookers let out cries of pain. They felt as though the front of their bodies had been slapped with something hot and hard.
<br><br>
As the sound ceased and the shock wave of the impact passed, they cautiously opened their eyes and looked at the two fighters. Zen was still standing, holding Chance's fist firmly in one outstretched hand.
<br><br>
Chance's face was distorted with shock.
<br><br>
Zen grinned at him. "Now will you take this seriously? Draw your sword!"
<br><br>
He shoved Chance backwards, releasing his fist. Chance staggered several steps backwards, still looking stunned.
<br><br>
His astonishment was mirrored in the faces of the direct descendants of Phoenix Palace, who had fully expected Zen to be killed by the full force of Chance's blow. The disciples realized that they and Chance had underestimated Zen.
<br><br>
Chance couldn't believe what had just happened. He had used over nine hundred divine megatons of the Other Shore Power in his punch. There was no way an inferior like Zen could have resisted that. But somehow, Zen had not only blocked the punch, but had also done so with seeming ease.
<br><br>
Chance would never have admitted it, but he felt a small tremor of fear. He had landed a killing blow but Zen had not been injured in the slightest. He realized that although Zen hadn't been through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, he also had extraordinary physical strength and must be taken seriously.
<br><br>
But Chance did not let any of his thoughts show on his face. "Draw my sword? No need!"
<br><br>
he said grandly. He chuckled and rushed towards Zen again.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power flowed continuously from his cinnabar field. This time, he used over a thousand divine megatons of force. This was the limit of the physical body below the Chaotic Source Realm. Chance himself wouldn't be able to withstand such an attack, and neither would Zen.
<br><br>
There was a series of booming sounds as he landed one punch after another.
<br><br>
Again, the onlookers protected their eyes and ears.
<br><br>
Chance summoned all his raging power, and each blow had the power to split mountains and part seas.
<br><br>
Zen remained deadly calm. He raised both arms to meet Chance's fists. He matched him in speed and strength, managing to deflect every single blow.
<br><br>
In seconds, Chance had thrown at least ten punches, and Zen blocked every single one without flinching.
<br><br>
Chapter 3351 The Weightless Mountain After giving some time to adapt, Zen's ability to control the Shade Stone liquid only grew stronger.
<br><br>
It could be absorbed into his viscera, bones, or skin. When he resisted his enemies, he could shift the impact to the position where the Shade Stone liquid was placed. With the liquid, he attempted to take every strike from Chance.
<br><br>
Even though Chance released a thousand divine megatons of force, Zen blocked all his attacks with ease.
<br><br>
"I told you to take the fight more seriously. Show me what you've got!" Zen called out as he looked at Chance with calm eyes.
<br><br>
Chance knew Zen was a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace who hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but Zen appeared so calm as though Chance was an ordinary warrior.
<br><br>
It was completely beyond his expectations. Zen's leisurely attitude hurt his pride — he began growing restless.
<br><br>
Chance refused to yield or heed Zen's words. Instead, he gently slid his feet, moving particularly elegantly as he charged at Zen.
<br><br>
No matter how strong the disciple was, everyone had a limit. Chance refused to believe that Zen could continue resisting his attacks for long.
<br><br>
But under Chance's rain of punches, Zen showed no sign of panic.
<br><br>
Not only could he block Chance's fists, but he also managed to launch his counterattack from time to time.
<br><br>
In terms of force alone, Zen was incredibly strong when he used the Strength God Totem. Each and every punch he threw at his opponent contained over a thousand divine megatons of force. Besides, the Shade Stone liquid strengthened his body dramatically. His counterattacks weren't to be underestimated.
<br><br>
But Chance was a powerful warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm. His body was far stronger than any opponent Zen had faced before.
<br><br>
Ordinary warriors of the Other Shore Realm would have been torn to shreds if they took one of Zen's hits. But Chance's body was like iron. Zen couldn't even make a dent.
<br><br>
Loud thuds resounded every time their punches met. From the noises they made, anyone could easily assume that two giants were brawling. The exchange of blows continued as they moved across the area.
<br><br>
The other disciples knew it was good to distance themselves from the intense fight.
<br><br>
Every time the two collided, the impact caused something like a violent explosion. Anyone standing too close could easily be caught in the impact and get injured. Several disciples already had cheeks that were bulging out because of the blast wave.
<br><br>
As they watched the fierce combat, all of them were stunned frozen, their jaws hanging open with shock.
<br><br>
They all knew that Chance was a powerful warrior. But what about Zen? The caliber of the fight was nothing short of a fight between two powerful warriors of the Chaotic Source Realm. But the fact that Zen hadn't even reached the Chaotic Source Realm in spite of his power was bewildering.
<br><br>
How on earth did he come to possess such great power? "Zen has become stronger once again…" Nelly remarked, her eyes twinkling.
<br><br>
"He gets stronger every time I see him," Lavender added. "He never seems to stop improving himself."
<br><br>
Among the three, Lavender was the one who had been in Zen's company for the longest period of time.
<br><br>
He had grown stronger, all the way from the Lower World to the Upper World, and from the universe to the divine land. Lavender was used to seeing his extraordinary performance in battle.
<br><br>
In the back of his mind, even Chance was greatly shocked.
<br><br>
He had a growing suspicion that Zen wasn't human at all. 'Is this guy's body made out of some legendary weapon?' he wondered to himself.
<br><br>
While Chance's body was extremely strong after going through Chaotic Source Reinforcement, it couldn't resist any attack indefinitely. After a certain amount of damage, his body would weaken like any other. If his fatigue reached a limit, his physical strength would decline rapidly.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Zen still seemed in high spirits even after taking so many punches. He didn't look the least bit exhausted.
<br><br>
"Back off!"
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Chance lowered himself, tilting his shoulder. Gathering his strength, he threw another punch, forcing Zen back and buying time to rest.
<br><br>
Zen then retreated, sliding back on the ground to put some distance between them. His movements were gentle and light, his face as calm as still water.
<br><br>
There were no signs of fatigue in his actions.
<br><br>
Most of the power from Chance's attacks was blocked by the Shade Stone liquid. Zen's body structure was essentially different from Ahmad's. Zen would have the advantage if they were to fight in protracted combat.
<br><br>
The direct descendants watching from the side had noticed the difference in their states. It wasn't hard to tell who had the upper hand during such a fight.
<br><br>
"Ahmad, your brother seems exhausted," one of them remarked.
<br><br>
"Nonsense!" Ahmad rebutted furiously. "Just wait and see. My brother will cut him in half!"
<br><br>
Ahmad's brother was a role model to him — a goal he had pursued all his life. He refused to see his brother fall to defeat before a mere, unknown disciple.
<br><br>
Chance's eyes were now fixated on Zen — they were as malicious as a serpent's. Although he hadn't activated the Other Shore Token to its extreme, his opponent didn't seem to have done so either. Now, Zen seemed unfathomable.
<br><br>
It was a ridiculous feeling, Chance thought. His long arms drooped to the side, and his fingers gently brushed against his space ring. Blood began gurgling out of it.
<br><br>
But instead of dripping onto the ground, it flowed until it formed a shape of a snowflake. Chance then pulled out a great, long, red sword from the center of the figure.
<br><br>
"Since you insist that I use my sword, it would be rude of me not to,"
<br><br>
Chance said, raising his weapon arrogantly. "I must warn you, however, my sword has no conscience. If it cuts your head off by accident, don't complain about it on your way to hell!"
<br><br>
As Chance brandished the red sword, the Other Shore Token he carried in his inner world also emerged — it turned out to be a tiny mountain.
<br><br>
It was the Weightless Mountain, an Other Shore Token from Stage Fourteen.
<br><br>
Numerous tall and dangerous mountains were scattered on Stage Fourteen of the Desire World. The mountain spirit of them could be integrated by warriors as an Other Shore Token. Despite its light weight, the mountain spirit held incredible power, standing out from many Other Shore tokens of the strengthening type.
<br><br>
The Weightless Mountain had divided grades — Chance's Weightless Mountain was superior, containing more divine megatons of force than any ordinary mountain spirit.
<br><br>
His display of this token showed a clear desire to end the battle as soon as possible.
<br><br>
With a gentle shake of the Weightless Mountain, Chance's aura strengthened drastically. When he took a heavy step forward, his red sword slashed at Zen as he approached.
<br><br>
Swish! His sword left a long, red trail in the air. It seemed to carry the power to cut through anything in the world.
<br><br>
In the face of Chance's ferocity, Zen's face turned grim.
<br><br>
The realization hit him: he couldn't take the strike head-on.
<br><br>
Withdrawing his body, Zen leaped high into the air and evaded Chance's sharp hit.
<br><br>
But now that Chance had displayed his Other Shore Token, he surely wasn't going to give Zen any chance to run away.
<br><br>
"Nine-world Mantra! Binding him!"
<br><br>
Chance gently shook his sword's blade, making its radiance twist and shoot at Zen aggressively like a nimble gecko.
<br><br>
The Nine-world Mantra Sword was a supreme swordsmanship manual unique to the Phoenix Palace. With Chance's formidable strength, the power of his skill was thousands of times greater than when Ahmad had used it — Zen couldn't find a single flaw in his attack.
<br><br>
As Zen retreated, he continued moving and dodging, but failed to get out of the binding force's range.
<br><br>
It was an unavoidable technique, even for Zen, because the skill reached a wider area instead of a single point.
<br><br>
There was so much going on that Zen could barely process the situation.
<br><br>
But because he couldn't keep dodging, his right eye suddenly flashed with a red light.
<br><br>
Initially, Chance had planned to completely eliminate Zen in a single attack.
<br><br>
But as soon as he spotted the red light, his heart skipped a beat, and his attack waned.
<br><br>
Zen seized the opportunity to twist his body abruptly and distance himself from his opponent.
<br><br>
Chapter 3352 The Growing Sculptures As he helplessly watched Zen escape from his binding force, Chance's face was shadowed with a small trace of anger.
<br><br>
He had no idea about the red light in Zen's right eye, but he had felt the horror brought by it, even though it had lasted for one tiny, ephemeral moment.
<br><br>
"Crooked way!"
<br><br>
Chance bellowed, trying to settle the fear he felt inside. He waved his blood-red sword into the air again, and hundreds of beams of sword radiance shot out! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Seeing how aggressive the sword radiances were getting now, Zen was sure that he would be defeated sooner or later if he kept on dodging. He had to put an end to this fight.
<br><br>
Seeing the sword radiance rush toward him, Zen waved his Snow Sword, hacking at nine different points.
<br><br>
"Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship!" he roared.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! Nine rays of bright and pearly white colored sword radiance chopped the air and rushed toward Chance's sword radiance at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
But Chance's sword radiance was much more stable and strong since it contained greater Other Shore Power than Zen's. The latter's was remarkably fast, but regretfully, lacked quite a bit in power. When the two sword radiances collided, Zen's nine rays were smashed into nothingness as if they were made of paper or dry weeds.
<br><br>
Apparently, Zen couldn't block the sword radiance Chance was throwing at him. All he could do was to retreat and dodge again and again. He was in a precarious situation now.
<br><br>
"Huh! Now you see it! It's not that easy to make up for such a huge gap between cultivation levels," Chance remarked casually, staring at Zen with a scornful gaze. He began to approach Zen impassively with his sword in hand.
<br><br>
The direct descendants of the palace nodded subconsciously when they heard this. Chance's words made sense. How could Zen confront such a strong warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm, especially when he was comparatively much weaker? However, unknown to them, Chance was still a bit puzzled by the red light in Zen's right eye.
<br><br>
He didn't know what it was, but could sense that it was quite a rare Other Shore Token since it could disturb even his mind. He guessed it could be a mysterious type and would not contain much Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
Even the mysterious Other Shore Tokens of Stage Fourteen could unleash no more than 300 divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
But Zen had unleashed almost a thousand divine megatons of force just now. Was it possible that he had two Other Shore Tokens? Pondering over the possibilities, Chances waved his blood-red sword.
<br><br>
"Annihilation World!"
<br><br>
The sword radiance that rushed out this time contained an overwhelming intent of annihilation. Even if someone was just grazed by it, they would sustain serious injuries.
<br><br>
Faced with such an offensive attack, Zen was forced to dodge again.
<br><br>
He was being forced to retreat continuously by Chance's attacks. Very soon, he completely withdrew from the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.
<br><br>
Seeing the ongoing fight, the palace maids and servants were frightened to the core and fled away. Guards of the Phoenix Palace recognized Chance, so they did not dare stop him.
<br><br>
Lavender, Nelly, and Laquisha were merely following the fight closely. Zen was moving towards a disadvantage now, and they looked worried. They were nervously watching him dodge the sword light again and again. If he wasn't careful enough, he might die. That was not something they wanted to see.
<br><br>
'It looks like I will have to use the Civilization Artifact... Fine then.' Zen had told almost everything he had come across in the Dark Region to Flamine and Athemar. But he had concealed the Civilization Artifact from them.
<br><br>
Previously, Flamine had wanted to seal the Memory Flame of Teague, but Teague had managed to find a way to dispel it at the last moment.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was impossible for her to learn the secrets of the Regal Jade Civilization and the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
But once Elvinia recovered, she would tell Flamine, who was her mother, about these sooner or later. It wasn't like it could be kept a secret forever! While he thought about this, an idea flashed in his mind. A virtual shadow of the Civilization Artifact suddenly appeared in his inner world. And in the outside world, with a sweep of his hand, a jade sculpture appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
A sculpture of the Regal Jade Beast, merely a single foot tall! Buzz! The Regal Jade Beast sculpture stood still like any ordinary jade sculpture would do.
<br><br>
Chance had been forcing Zen backwards step by step, but seeing this, his eye twitched and his face revealed a strange expression. The corners of his mouth slightly curled into a smile. "Huh! This is your Other Shore Token? A descending type?"
<br><br>
There was a sarcastic tone to the question. As soon as he finished his words, he wielded his blood-red sword in the hope of smashing it in a single strike.
<br><br>
A beam of sword radiance shot straight towards the Regal Jade Beast sculpture.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The sword radiance hit the surface of the Regal Jade Beast sculpture with a crisp sound. But unlike what Chance had expected, it merely left a deep sword mark instead of breaking it down.
<br><br>
"Hmm... This Other Shore Token is remarkably solid, but how many strikes can it withstand?" Chance sneered contemptuously.
<br><br>
He again waved his sword three times in a row, hacking at the sculpture repeatedly. Hit again and again by his Annihilation World which contained enormous amounts of annihilation intent, the Regal Jade Beast sculpture suddenly broke into a thousand emerald green pieces which gradually disappeared.
<br><br>
As a descending type of Other Shore Token, the sculpture was quite vulnerable to damage. And once it was damaged, it would need a large amount of divine crystals to be repaired.
<br><br>
Seeing the sculpture break into pieces, Ahmad and the direct descendants burst into laughter.
<br><br>
"What a weak descending type of Other Shore Token! Was that a joke?"
<br><br>
"That was the weakest Other Shore Token I've ever seen."
<br><br>
"Hang on! The Other Shore Tokens of descending type are supposed to be powerful since they can help a warrior break through the limits of corporeal body. But why was this one so weak?"
<br><br>
The corporeal body that hadn't gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement could not withstand a thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
But a token of the descending type didn't need the corporeal body to bear it.
<br><br>
Instead it could help the warrior break through that limit and exert an even greater force. For example, Elvinia's Warrior of the Stone Hill could burst out more than a thousand divine megatons of force by itself.
<br><br>
Zen's sculpture seemed immovable and fragile, which was truly incredible.
<br><br>
It was reasonable that they mocked him.
<br><br>
But just as Chance had smashed this Other Shore Token, Zen's hand waved lightly in the air again.
<br><br>
Buzz! Another Other Shore Token appeared right next to him; yet another Regal Jade Beast sculpture was standing impassively! "What's this?" Chance was a little stunned.
<br><br>
Ahmad and the others were confused as well.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast sculpture had been cut into smithereens by Chance.
<br><br>
He hadn't seen Zen use any divine crystals to repair it. Furthermore, even if Zen did use divine crystals, a broken Other Shore Token could not be repaired within such a short period of time.
<br><br>
Was it possible that they were wrong? Was it because this particular Other Shore Token wasn't a descending type? What was the use of the Regal Jade Beast he had summoned then? Chance was getting a little impatient now. He didn't know what Zen was playing at. He flew up, raised his blood-red sword with his left hand, and hit the second sculpture directly.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The second sculpture was smashed into pieces by a single strike this time.
<br><br>
As soon as he smashed this sculpture, Chance began to chase after Zen once again.
<br><br>
He didn't care what the use of these Regal Jade sculptures was. All he wanted was to kill Zen! With Chance in hot pursuit, Zen acted very calmly.
<br><br>
Since he was unable to fight against Chance head-on, he merely kept dodging and retreating. And while retreating, he kept on releasing Regal Jade Beast sculptures one after another.
<br><br>
Chance was hot headed. But if he had been cautious enough, then he would have instantly noticed that these sculptures were gradually growing in size.
<br><br>
Each one was bigger and taller than the previous one! Chance finally noticed this after smashing a few of them.
<br><br>
'There's something strange about his sculptures.' Out of fighting instinct, Chance didn't let go of any sculpture even after realizing that. He cut through all the tokens that Zen was releasing into pieces along the way.
<br><br>
Forced to repeatedly destroy these sculptures, Chance had to slow down.
<br><br>
They were proving to be quite a nuisance.
<br><br>
Just as Chance cut the tenth sculpture, he was faced with yet another problem.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast sculpture had now grown as tall as a man. Previously, he had been able to stab through the sculptures in a single strike, but now, he could only leave a few cracks on it with one strike. These Regal Jade sculptures were becoming bigger and stronger.
<br><br>
Chapter 3353 There Is Always More Now, Chance had to hit the sculpture over ten times to destroy it.
<br><br>
Deafening, clanging sounds echoed as his sword strikes collided with the sculpture.
<br><br>
He cut the sculpture a dozen times before it finally broke into pieces.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the sculpture crumbled, a new one appeared before him. Zen had summoned another statue.
<br><br>
It was even burlier and larger than the last one! "The sculptures will just keep coming!" Chance said to himself, getting frustrated.
<br><br>
He realized that it was a mistake to waste his energy on the statues. He should have dodged them and directly attacked Zen instead.
<br><br>
He sidestepped the latest statue and prepared to rush towards Zen. In that instant, a chessboard appeared in Zen's hand.
<br><br>
Like the statues, it was made of Regal Jade.
<br><br>
Nine vertical and nine horizontal lines were laid out on the chessboard, forming a total of eighty-one intersections.
<br><br>
There was a single cyan chessman on the board.
<br><br>
Zen delicately placed a finger on the cyan chessman, and pushed it a step forward.
<br><br>
The statue sprang to life. It lunged forward and grabbed Chance.
<br><br>
Chance was caught by surprise when the statue took hold of him. He had thought the statues were only used to make the array, and that they couldn't move.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Chance shouted. At this point he was more irritated than afraid.
<br><br>
He had stopped not because he was afraid but trying to save his time and strength.
<br><br>
If he wanted, he would be able to destroy them one after another.
<br><br>
As the statue dragged him, Chance turned, wielding his sword. The light of his sword circled as he swung at the statue.
<br><br>
There was a crashing sound as it cracked and crumbled.
<br><br>
He had broken the statue into pieces with his sword.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Phoenix Palace cheered, "Chance is awesome!"
<br><br>
"I've never seen anything like that strange Other Shore Token, but it won't be enough to beat Chance!"
<br><br>
While the disciples were proclaiming their support for Chance, one of them suddenly pointed at Zen and gasped, "Look!"
<br><br>
Zen was holding the Regal Jade chessboard with one hand. He raised his other hand, and immediately another statue of Regal Jade Beast appeared beside him. It was huge and forbidding. It was definitely taller and fiercer than any of the previous statues.
<br><br>
They could see traces of green energy surrounding the Regal Jade Beast statue.
<br><br>
Zen smiled faintly. Although he was just standing there, not saying anything, there was something subtly threatening about the way he touched the piece on the chessboard.
<br><br>
The moment that Chance had smashed the last statue, the cyan chessman on the board also crumbled and fell apart.
<br><br>
Now, Zen gently pushed another chessman forward, and the statue beside him rushed straight towards Chance.
<br><br>
It was difficult to conclude which type of Other Shore Token the Civilization Artifact was. It had various characteristics, including features of descending type, strengthening type, mysterious type, and even auxiliary type.
<br><br>
In order to evade the Nihility race, the Regal Jade Civilization had suppressed some of their power by hiding on Stage Thirteen. Yet it could still give Zen a terrifying force in the form of this chessboard, which was able to summon statues of Regal Jade Beasts.
<br><br>
Each time Zen summoned a statue, it would be more powerful than the statue before it. Thus the more frequently he summoned a statue, the stronger it would become.
<br><br>
However, the chessboard had one important flaw—it required a huge consumption of the divine crystals.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't wanted to use the Civilization Artifact in this fight.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Chance had left him with no other choice.
<br><br>
As the statue attacked Chance, Zen waved his hand again. Along with the new chessman on the board, another enormous statue appeared beside him.
<br><br>
Zen touched the chessman and the new statue also rushed towards Chance.
<br><br>
At the sight of two statues attacking him, Chance began to feel a trace of fear.
<br><br>
He realized that every new statue was stronger than the last one. And he had no idea how many of these Zen could summon. Perhaps Zen had an endless array of these statues at his disposal.
<br><br>
The last destroyed statue had been the twelfth one, and it had eight hundred divine megatons of force. As Chance prepared to attack the two new statues, he wondered how powerful they were.
<br><br>
The moment they came close, he knew the answer.
<br><br>
The thirteenth statue had nine hundred divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
And the fourteenth one had one thousand divine megatons of force! The power of the statues was increasing by one hundred divine megatons with each iteration. At the same time, they were becoming harder and taller.
<br><br>
Chance's sword clanged as he darted forward, slashing at the two statues.
<br><br>
He was thankful that the moving statues were very slow. They were unable to match his speed. Despite the force of his numerous attacks on these two statues, he only managed to cut off a few pieces of jade.
<br><br>
Ahmad and the other disciples could see that Chance was having a difficult time, and they exchanged confused glances.
<br><br>
The descending type of Other Shore Token was very powerful, in part because the owner did not need to bear the force. But it also had a limitation. It could not grow with the owner. So most of the ambitious people of the Other Shore Realm would never choose this kind of Other Shore Token for themselves.
<br><br>
However, Zen's statues were incredibly strong.
<br><br>
The guards of the Phoenix Palace also stood nearby, watching the battle between Zen and Chance.
<br><br>
Many of them used to be Oneness Guards. They were powerful and experienced.
<br><br>
At first, like the Phoenix Palace disciples, they had believed there was no doubt Chance would win.
<br><br>
After all, he was from the Land of Sword Grief! But with every new statue that appeared, each one stronger than the statue before it, they began to feel uneasy. They felt that Chance actually had a chance of being defeated.
<br><br>
"There's no way he can just keep summoning as many statues as he wants.
<br><br>
There has to be a limit."
<br><br>
"But we don't know that! For all we know, he could keep summoning new statues infinitely."
<br><br>
"If the strength and numbers of the statues keep increasing, they may overturn this entire place,"
<br><br>
said one of the guards solemnly.
<br><br>
The other guards stared at him, shaking their heads.
<br><br>
"No way!"
<br><br>
"Other Shore Tokens can be extremely powerful, but they have to be reasonable. Remember, that guy has only reached the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. There's no way he could have gotten his hands on an invincible Other Shore Token."
<br><br>
Of course, the power of the Other Shore Tokens did not always strictly correspond to their stage. There were powerful tokens in Stage One, and there were tokens from Stage Thirteen that could be stronger than tokens from Stage Fourteen. But the variance in their level of power would not be too great.
<br><br>
There were some Other Shore Tokens that had the power to overturn the Oneness Sky Palace, but there was no way they would be found in Stage Thirteen on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
Chance shouted furiously. His hair stood on end with his exertions.
<br><br>
A primitive and unique force began forming inside his body.
<br><br>
At the same time, a melodious bell sounded.
<br><br>
"His blood!" cried the disciples.
<br><br>
"Chance's blood is pure.
<br><br>
He has just summoned the Bell of Eastern Emperor!"
<br><br>
Chance raised his sword slightly and said, "Suppress." He swept his sword across the two statues, and shadows appeared over each of them. Two huge bells were falling from the sky.
<br><br>
There was a clanging sound as the bells landed.
<br><br>
The two statues were broken into pieces in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
"Ha!" said Chance triumphantly.
<br><br>
He looked at Zen, intending to gloat, but instead he saw something terrifying Zen still wore that faint smile. Next to him stood three statues. Each was taller and stronger than the two statues Chance had just destroyed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3354 Chance's Mother There was a gentle tapping sound as Zen put his fingers on three pieces on the chessboard once again.
<br><br>
He instantly activated the 15th, 16th, and 17th Regal Jade Beast statues, which ran towards Chance.
<br><br>
Every time one more Regal Jade Beast was summoned and appeared, its strength and body grew significantly.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the power of the three Regal Jade Beasts was comparable to that of the ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warrior, but they were slightly weaker when it came to physical strength.
<br><br>
Although Chance was a powerful warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm, it was difficult for him to fight against them. After all, he was outnumbered.
<br><br>
He bit his teeth and extracted the blood of his body. The blood red sword which seemed to contain endless amounts of power turned into a big bell, and then moved towards the Regal Jade Beasts to attack them.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Chance had easily killed the 15th Regal Jade Beast.
<br><br>
The 16th Regal Jade Beast, however, actually managed to withstand the Bell of Eastern Emperor's attack, but countless cracks burst on the surface of its body. The beast didn't break into pieces until Chance attacked it for the second time.
<br><br>
The 17th Regal Jade Beast was an exception. When the 17th Regal Jade Beast was hit by the Bell of Eastern Emperor, only one crack appeared on its body. It seemed that its physical body was terribly strong! The guards who watched the battle from the distance all gasped at the scene.
<br><br>
"How terrifying this jade statue is!"
<br><br>
"Even though Chance has made use of the Other Shore Token and the bloodline theurgy, he still can't destroy it..."
<br><br>
"Can that man really make these jade statues become stronger and stronger?"
<br><br>
Speculations filled the air as such a crazy method was unheard of and totally out of the others' imaginations.
<br><br>
Even the disciples of the Phoenix Palace were amazed. Their faces darkened as they watched the shocking scene.
<br><br>
For them, Chance had always been invincible, but now he couldn't even touch Zen's sleeve and was completely tired of dealing with the statues.
<br><br>
This result was completely beyond their expectation, and it made them upset.
<br><br>
As for Chance, all the color was drained from his face and he became speechless.
<br><br>
He was also confused.
<br><br>
How could an Other Shore Realm warrior be so powerful to deal with? There was no doubt that he'd become everyone's laughing stock if Zen defeated him today.
<br><br>
Outraged, Chance madly squeezed his Other Shore Token and blood power.
<br><br>
After he used the Bells of Eastern Emperor to attack the 17th Regal Jade Beast statue seven times, he finally smashed it into pieces.
<br><br>
"He is such a powerful Chaotic Source Realm warrior," Zen said flatly. The power Chance had released reached 2, 000 divine megatons.
<br><br>
With the help of the shadows of the Bells of Eastern Emperor, the power had increased by more than tenfold.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen also had something he was thankful for: if it wasn't for the Civilization Artifact, he would never defeat Chance.
<br><br>
It was no wonder the Chaotic Source Realm was known as the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. After one had successfully reached the Chaotic Source Realm, their body would be reinforced and possess an unparalleled strength.
<br><br>
And so, Zen had the slightest hint of expectation for the Chaotic Source World in his heart.
<br><br>
"But, the 18th and 19th Regal Jade Beasts should be able to defeat you..."
<br><br>
he muttered.
<br><br>
Then, he put his finger on the chessboard and pushed out two more pieces.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit had told Zen that this Regal Jade chessboard was just a small one and could only accommodate 81 chess pieces. Zen was able to summon a limit of 81 Regal Jade creatures. Unfortunately, too many Regal Jade creatures would consume a great number of divine crystals.
<br><br>
If the Regal Jade Civilization reached the Desire World and got rid of the Lust World's suppression, it would be able to give Zen a bigger chessboard.
<br><br>
There were 19 horizontal lines and 19 vertical lines on the chessboard, so there would be a total of 361 Regal Jade creatures that he could summon! "Clang, clang, clang..."
<br><br>
Two Regal Jade Beasts of nearly ten feet tall ran quickly on the cyan stone path of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
It took Chance a lot of Other Shore Power to destroy the three Regal Jade Beasts earlier. He looked exhausted at this point.
<br><br>
Now, Chance tried his best to hold on as he didn't want to disgrace Eastern Emperor Taiyi, especially since he was the emperor's direct descendant! However, he no longer hoped to defeat Zen. He faced the Regal Jade Beasts that went straight for him, and then absorbed the divine crystals like mad to replenish the power of his Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
It was known that the Other Shore Power of the Other Shore Token could be replenished with the divine crystals, but the blood power could not.
<br><br>
Thus, the only way for him to defeat the two Regal Jade Beasts was to extract his own blood power to the extreme.
<br><br>
"Shatter..."
<br><br>
Chance roared as he rushed headlong towards the two Regal Jade Beasts.
<br><br>
Shadows of the Bells of Eastern Emperor descended along his blood red sword blade as he unleashed terrifying power.
<br><br>
The path in the Phoenix Palace was an absolute wreck, but the two Regal Jade Beasts seemed to be made of fine iron. Only a mere crack surfaced on each of their bodies after the shadows of the Bells of Eastern Emperor had hit them. In other words, they weren't seriously affected.
<br><br>
Just as Chance attacked once more, one of the Regal Jade Beasts suddenly bolted forward and grabbed at him.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast didn't have a special theurgy and only relied on its own strength and physical body.
<br><br>
Chance had dodged several attacks from the Regal Jade Beasts before, but the beasts' strength had been greatly enhanced. He had failed to dodge when the beast grasped him! "Swish! Bang!"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Beast lifted Chance up in the air, and then smashed him onto the ground.
<br><br>
The impact of the huge force caused the surrounding ground to tremble, and the walls on both sides of the palace were shattered. Laquisha, Nelly, Lavender, and the direct descendants also lost their balance and fell down.
<br><br>
The physical body of the Chaotic Source Realm warrior was extremely solid. On the other hand, an ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior who was under a similar attack would have been smashed to pieces.
<br><br>
However, Chance managed to withstand the attack.
<br><br>
"You..."
<br><br>
He still wanted to fight back, but when he was about to turn over, another Regal Jade Beast waved its thick palm and slapped him.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom..."
<br><br>
Despite the continuous attacks of the two Regal Jade Beasts, Chance still managed to endure them because his body had undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement! "What a strong body..." Zen scowled and smacked his lips.
<br><br>
Even if he himself used the Shade Stone liquid to protect his body, he still couldn't resist the violent attacks from the two Regal Jade Beasts! At this moment, Chance began to groan inwardly.
<br><br>
Chance's physical body, though fortified by the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, was now extremely fatigued. If he suffered a few more attacks, his physical body's strength would decline greatly and the Regal Jade Beasts would end up smashing him into a bloody pulp! But what could he do? Give up? Beg for mercy? As a direct descendant of the Phoenix Palace and the talent of the Land of Sword Grief, would he admit defeat to a disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace? Driven by his strong self-esteem, Chance wasn't willing to do that.
<br><br>
While Chance was in despair, two ice crystals suddenly appeared beside him.
<br><br>
As soon as the two ice crystals emerged, they pummeled into the bodies of the two Regal Jade Beasts.
<br><br>
As a result, the emerald Regal Jade Beasts turned into two stiff, icy sculptures.
<br><br>
After that, a woman in a white gauze dress quietly appeared beside Chance.
<br><br>
The moment she showed up, the temperature in the entire Phoenix Palace dropped by several degrees.
<br><br>
She stretched out her slender white fingers and gently stroked the two ice sculptures.
<br><br>
"Crash!"
<br><br>
The two ice sculptures shattered into pieces on the ground.
<br><br>
Chance groaned in pain, and then slowly adjusted his body. "Mother..." he called out and looked at the woman.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, another shout ripped through the cold air. "Mother!"
<br><br>
Ahmad yelled and ran over from the distance.
<br><br>
"Who are you from? How dare you act wildly and atrociously in our Phoenix Palace?" the woman hissed.
<br><br>
She had quite an aloof face. She glared at Zen who stood not far away, her voice filled with rage.
<br><br>
Chapter 3355 More Important The woman dressed in white was Lady Jean. She enjoyed a high position in the Phoenix Palace and was not shy about showing it.
<br><br>
When Chance was in the middle of a battle at the Heavenly Cultivation Palace, some maids saw it and immediately rushed off to tell Jean what was going on.
<br><br>
She rushed over, infuriated to see her son being beaten by two Regal Jade Beasts.
<br><br>
The guards saw Jean, exchanged a quick look and quietly slid away.
<br><br>
Other concubines could be reasoned with and spoken to easily, but Jean was cold and loved to let her anger out on others around her.
<br><br>
The guards had looked on when Chance was being beaten by the Regal Jade Beasts.
<br><br>
They were too weak to stop it, but if Jean were to turn to them in anger and ask questions, they'd have no way of defending themselves, and so they opted to run away from the situation.
<br><br>
Hearing Jean's words, Zen was helpless.
<br><br>
Like mother, like son. Chance and his mother were very much alike in character. Jean didn't even know what was going on and had immediately decided to criticize and blame Zen.
<br><br>
"Your son and I are sparring with each other. Why are you making such a fuss?" Zen retorted.
<br><br>
"Mother, he crumbled my sword right when he got here. Obviously he is here to cause trouble. Punish him!" Ahmad said whining.
<br><br>
Jean looked daggers at Zen and said, "As I said, you're acting wildly and atrociously. There's no way for you to deny it!"
<br><br>
She snorted in derision as pieces of ice crystals floated from her fingertips towards Zen.
<br><br>
The crystals were so icy cold that they would have shattered the jade statues into a million pieces if they so much as touched them.
<br><br>
The direct descendants all bubbled with excitement on seeing the ice crystals flying at Zen.
<br><br>
Most of them were proud and arrogant, always looking down upon the disciples outside of the Phoenix Palace. This attributed to the fact they all shared a bit of the blood of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Zen had beaten Chance in their territory and this was unacceptable to them.
<br><br>
They had taken it as not only a defeat to Chance, but to all the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
This feeling writhing in their hearts, they watched eagerly in hope Zen would swiftly meet his demise.
<br><br>
Of course, Jean's cultivation base was higher than Chance's. Killing Zen would be a piece of cake for her.
<br><br>
Chance and Ahmad looked at Zen as a dead man walking. He was about to die and didn't even know it. Not a trace of fear appeared on his face. 'What an idiot!' thought Chance.
<br><br>
But the brothers soon changed their tone.
<br><br>
Not only did Zen show no fear, a smile now shaped his lips.
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"Watch out for the ice crystals!"
<br><br>
Lavender, Nelly, and Laquisha warned him, filled with angst.
<br><br>
They hadn't expected Jean to appear once Zen had won.
<br><br>
They had met her once before. Laquisha had trouble controlling the Sprite Fire and set fire to the Phoenix Palace. Jean happened to pass by and put the fire out.
<br><br>
She wanted to teach Laquisha a violent lesson but Flamine had stopped her.
<br><br>
From then on, Lavender, Nelly and Laquisha knew Jean was a tough one, but they didn't expect her to take Zen's life on her first attack! Zen didn't flinch at the ice crystals floating in front of him. Instead, he slowly stretched his fingertips out towards the crystals.
<br><br>
The ice crystals with a deadly cold aura flew away, disappearing as if they had never even existed.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Ahmad, Chance and the other direct descendants were all shocked.
<br><br>
Even if Zen could defeat Chance who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm, how could he deflate Jean's theurgy so easily? The ice crystals might have looked ordinary but they were definitely not something Zen could withstand.
<br><br>
Jean remained stone cold and unflinching. "Lady Flamine, you're already here. Why are you hiding?" she said coldly.
<br><br>
A figure in cerise materialized silently next to Zen. There was a faint smile on Flamine's face as she said, "I gave Zen a token to enter, so he may walk freely in the Phoenix Palace. He's not making trouble here."
<br><br>
"He broke Ahmad's sword and hurt Chance. Don't you think that's a bit far for a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?" Jean's eyes burned with anger.
<br><br>
Even in the face of Flamine, she wouldn't yield an inch.
<br><br>
Just then, Nelly came to Zen's side frowning and said, "Ahmad wanted to drive us away from the Phoenix Palace and almost killed Lavender. If not for Zen, he would have! Chance is even worse; even though he's a powerful warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm, he still fought Zen. Then you showed up acting like this after Zen had defeated them both. Aren't you ashamed?"
<br><br>
"Like mother, like son. They have no sense of shame," Laquisha added.
<br><br>
Lavender narrowed her eyes and with an air of caution, moved quietly beside Zen, snorted and said nothing.
<br><br>
Being jeered by Nelly and Laquisha only infuriated Jean more.
<br><br>
She was a high-ranking figure here. How dare they speak to her this way? "Shut your mouth! You are asking for death to come calling!" Jean clenched her fists. Ice crystals began appearing above them, quickly turning into a snowstorm sweeping straight towards Zen and his women.
<br><br>
The ice crystals she cast could freeze a space forever. If a person was covered with her ice crystals, they were as good as dead.
<br><br>
The fierce snowstorm was about to engulf them when Flamine raised her hands and layers of golden flames spurt out and fluttered through the air.
<br><br>
Splash! With a flick of the divine flames of the Sun Crow race, the snowstorm had dissipated.
<br><br>
"Lady Jean, that's enough. Please go back to your place and rest," said Flamine.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine! Are you really going to protect these lowly outsiders?" Jean snapped. Her pretty face twisted in anger.
<br><br>
The Phoenix Palace might have seemed peaceful and serene, but the concubines were always in disagreements with one another.
<br><br>
Jean and Flamine had never been on good terms. And now, Ahmad and Chance were beat and Flamine sided with the outsiders? Jean could not make sense of this.
<br><br>
"Lowly outsiders?" A smile of mockery crossed Flamine's face. "Firstly, they are the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, not lowly outsiders.
<br><br>
Secondly, they are friends of my daughter."
<br><br>
"Friends?" Jean smiled disdainfully and was about to respond, but Flamine interrupted her.
<br><br>
"Thirdly, compared to us, Zen is much more important to the Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
Zen was the only one capable of deciphering the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Based on that, Zen was indeed more important to the Oneness Sky Palace than the concubines of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Jean's heart skipped a beat at Flamine's words. Zen? More important than them? What made him so important? This was a hard pill to swallow and she thought Flamine was probably lying to her anyway.
<br><br>
"I don't care what you say. I won't let this matter go to rest unless you hand them over!" Jean said coldly.
<br><br>
"So you want to fight me?" asked Flamine with a menacing smile.
<br><br>
Chapter 3356 Be Summoned Jean's eyes glinted dangerously as she began to assess the weight of the situation.
<br><br>
Even though her strength was comparable to Flamine's, it was unwise to fight Flamine openly within the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
In any case, she was cautious enough not to do anything foolish. Moreover, Flamine said that Zen held a greater importance in the Oneness Sky Palace than they did.
<br><br>
If Zen was truly significant to the palace, she wouldn't want to further complicate things. Otherwise, her position in the Phoenix Palace would be at stake. Once Eastern Emperor Taiyi punished her, she would be demoted from her current position.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Flamine merely stood there waiting calmly, with a charming smile etched on her face.
<br><br>
In actuality, she had set this trap up. The only thing she had to do now was wait for Jean to take the bait and walk into it.
<br><br>
The tension in the area was almost palpable. Even the direct descendants felt their hearts pounding against their ribs.
<br><br>
It was not that big of a deal for the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace to fight in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
However, it would be a serious matter if the two wives of the emperor fought there. Moreover, both of them held high positions.
<br><br>
Zen and the others remained quiet while assessing the current scenario. He surmised that Flamine was confident enough to challenge Jean on the spot.
<br><br>
Boom! All of a sudden, they heard a melodious chime coming from the depths of the Phoenix Palace. It rang all throughout the entire palace.
<br><br>
Flamine, Jean, and the direct descendants turned their heads toward the direction of the chime.
<br><br>
Afterwards, they heard a loud booming voice. It was such a magnificent sound that resonated from the depths of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
"Zen, come here and meet Eastern Emperor Taiyi."
<br><br>
The entirety of the Phoenix Palace heard the voice clearly.
<br><br>
"He is awake!" Flamine wasn't able to hide her surprise.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been cultivating in solitude for such a long time.
<br><br>
This worried the other people in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Jean also showed a flash of surprise on her face. Eastern Emperor Taiyi finally woke up. But instead of summoning someone from their palace, the first person he wanted to see was Zen? "With all due respect, Lady Flamine, who do you mean?" Zen asked courteously.
<br><br>
Flamine responded with a smile and said, "It's Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Make haste. He already summoned you. I'll escort you there."
<br><br>
"You'll be showing me the way?" Zen exchanged looks with Nelly, Lavender and Laquisha. One thing was for certain. They were all dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Jean was extremely narrow-minded. What would happen if she got mad at the girls after he left with Flamine? After all, they wouldn't be able to resist clashing with a strong warrior like her.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, Flamine perfectly understood what worried Zen. She casually said, "There is no need to worry. This is the Phoenix Palace. Even though some of the people here might be unreasonable, they are not completely foolish. They won't tempt fate and bring about their own deaths."
<br><br>
The first person Eastern Emperor Taiyi wanted to meet after he just woke up was Zen. Even a fool would be able to grasp the true importance of Zen.
<br><br>
No matter how senseless Jean was, she wouldn't kill Nelly and the other two. In addition to that, the Phoenix Palace was not exactly huge. Masters like Flamine would be able to cover it easily with her spiritual sense.
<br><br>
After hearing that, Zen turned to the three girls and said, "Kindly wait for me in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace."
<br><br>
Nelly, Lavender, and Laquisha had already been living in the Phoenix Palace for a considerable period of time. In that time, they had heard so much about the Oneness Sky Palace. The legend of Eastern Emperor Taiyi had an even greater impact on them. They found it extremely fascinating.
<br><br>
He was a great warrior who gathered and established an outstanding force of the humans using his own strength. Moreover, he was the supreme leader of the Oneness Sky Palace! The moment he finished his cultivation in seclusion, he wanted to meet Zen. For this, they felt incredibly honored and proud.
<br><br>
"Understood!" Laquisha and Nelly nodded their heads in response.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Lavender smiled at him and tilted her head to one side. It was a good thing that the girls accepted this order obediently.
<br><br>
With that said, Flamine turned around and led the way. Zen followed her politely.
<br><br>
Ahmad and Chance remained rooted to the spot. They were completely stunned. Chance was even more shocked by the unexpected turn of events.
<br><br>
He had rarely seen his father, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, over the last several years. Yet, his father wanted to meet Zen who was merely a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace. What on earth was happening? "Mother, where exactly does this guy come from?" Chance asked Jean out of confusion.
<br><br>
"How was I supposed to know?!" Jean retorted. "You harassed him without even knowing his background? You are always causing problems for me!"
<br><br>
Jean was in no way inferior to Flamine when it came to strength. However, she was always at a disadvantage because Flamine had been favored by Eastern Emperor Taiyi the moment she got promoted. If Flamine chose to tell him of this incident, her current position would be in jeopardy.
<br><br>
Sensing their mother's anger, both Chance and Ahmad were now trembling with fear.
<br><br>
Chance felt wronged. She also wanted to kill Zen even before knowing his background. He wasn't the only one at fault.
<br><br>
However, he didn't dare say these thoughts out loud. He had no intention of contradicting his mother.
<br><br>
With a cold expression on her face, Jean just huffed and stormed off.
<br><br>
True to what Flamine said, it was obvious she wouldn't do anything stupid.
<br><br>
She wouldn't hurt those three girls.
<br><br>
On their way towards the emperor, Zen finally saw a chance to ask about something that he was always curious about. He turned to Flamine and inquired, "Lady Flamine, is there no empress in the Phoenix Palace?"
<br><br>
In his own perception, people were often fond of becoming emperors in the mortal world.
<br><br>
Such eye-catching titles could easily gather and reinforce their imperial power.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, people in the world of warriors cultivated themselves by defying the laws of nature. They honored strength above all else. Even with a good title, one would be kicked out of the throne sooner or later if they were not strong enough.
<br><br>
One's lifespan would last long after they reached the True God Realm. After that, they normally would not care about titles anymore.
<br><br>
Therefore, except the four divine kingdoms in the Lower World, the great forces Zen had ever met rarely established divine kingdoms. Moreover, in the divine land, those forces would only claim themselves as powerful clans.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that the Source World had retaken the hierarchy of the secular world once more.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Flamine smiled. "We are different from the Nine Li race, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race. They all take blood relationship as their basis, so each of them is more closely united than us. Eastern Emperor Taiyi established the Oneness Sky Palace in the Bloom Divine Province because he wanted to gather all the humans that were dispersed all throughout the Source World. He did it to form another human force. As a result, we need to make use of the hierarchy of a kingdom," she graciously explained.
<br><br>
The seven emperors of the seven mountains settled in the Bloom Divine Province. They formed an orthodox force and welcomed all humans from all over the world.
<br><br>
In the old days, it had been difficult for Eastern Emperor Taiyi to establish a strong force of humans. Instead of wasting his energy in creating a new system, he chose to use the traditional titles and routines. Thus, this hierarchy was formed.
<br><br>
"There is definitely no empress in this palace," Flamine finally confirmed while grinning.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, some of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's wives, specifically Jean, had tried many times to compete for the empress throne. However, she was rejected by Eastern Emperor Taiyi every time.
<br><br>
Flamine continued to explain this to Zen while they walked into the depths of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
As soon as they stopped walking, an exquisite three-story pavilion came into sight. Compared to the magnificent halls he saw while walking inside the Phoenix Palace, this seemed a bit simpler.
<br><br>
"You can go inside now, Zen." Flamine stopped walking as soon as they reached the pavilion. Her escort duty to Zen had been fulfilled.
<br><br>
"I'm going in alone?" Zen was taken aback. He thought Flamine would accompany him inside as well.
<br><br>
Flamine nodded in response. "He only summoned you. Hence, you have to enter by yourself."
<br><br>
Zen looked at the simple door of the pavilion. Promptly, he stepped forward.
<br><br>
The pavilion was indeed small but the interior design was very elegant. As soon as he stepped inside it, a faint fragrance greeted his nose. He couldn't quite place what the fragrance was. Nevertheless, it somehow made him feel peaceful.
<br><br>
A thin veil covered the main hall of the pavilion. It was such a delicate fabric yet it concealed whatever it had behind it.
<br><br>
As Zen walked closer to it, the veil curtains automatically opened and moved toward the sides.
<br><br>
He saw a simple yet ancient-looking screen bearing an illustration of an exquisitely huge bell standing in the middle of the main hall. This bell looked exactly the same as the Bell of Eastern Emperor that Chance had activated with his blood.
<br><br>
"Zen?"
<br><br>
A middle-aged man clothed in a grey robe came out from the side of the screen.
<br><br>
This man wore a purple and gold crown upon his head. He had a square face, his eyes looked as sharp as hawk's, and his facial expression was serious. It commanded a magnificent presence. He was the great Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen cupped his hands together and bowed to him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3357 Zen's Request Eastern Emperor Taiyi stared at Zen, a smile cracking through his serious face.
<br><br>
He was always a gravely serious man; Zen didn't know how rare this smile was.
<br><br>
He stretched a finger towards Zen as he smiled.
<br><br>
The finger released the powerful, sharp radiance like a sword. This was a technique that could be performed by any ordinary swordsman.
<br><br>
Naturally, however, as it was Eastern Emperor Taiyi employing the finger strike, it was incredibly powerful.
<br><br>
Zen felt that the finger strike contained the aura of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent's Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Seeing the finger strike heading straight for him, Zen too stretched out a finger. A white spiral burst from his finger's radiance and he began making use of the Truth Enlightenment as well.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
"Swish..."
<br><br>
Zen launched an attack with his finger and Eastern Emperor Taiyi moved slightly and avoided it, responding with a horizontal chop of his own.
<br><br>
Zen reacted by gently moving his finger upward, and with a flip of his hand, he instantly stopped the chop coming at him.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than ten moves.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi restrained his strength to a very low level, only fighting Zen with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.
<br><br>
Zen had comprehended more content of the Truth Enlightenment than he had. His finger radiance was sharper and more formidable than Eastern Emperor Taiyi's, suppressing Eastern Emperor Taiyi's every attack and forcing him to give up over and over.
<br><br>
"I was on the Other Shore for quite a while this time, leaving only a soul fragment here. When anything important happened in the Oneness Sky Palace, Athemar and the others would report it to my soul fragment. After I came back and fused with the soul fragment, I was very surprised by you,"
<br><br>
said Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Zen pretended not to understand and asked innocently, "Why? What is it that has shocked you?"
<br><br>
"I have been studying the Truth Enlightenment for many years, too many. I once contemplated giving it up. Altogether I've only deciphered about 100 words. But you, only around 100 years old, have already surpassed me in deciphering the Sanskrit words. That is what has me shocked," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said earnestly.
<br><br>
He was the man responsible for the construction of the orthodox human force. His goal was to achieve the ultimate level in all respects, such as deciphering the Sanskrit words, and cultivating the swordsmanship.
<br><br>
The Truth Enlightenment had hindered him for too long. He hadn't achieved anything until only recently.
<br><br>
However, after comprehending about a hundred words, the difficulty once again ramped up massively. There was no telling when he would completely decipher the two Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
"I'm flattered," Zen responded courteously.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head and said, "Our Oneness Sky Palace is very lucky that Athemar led you in. May I ask you a question? Do you believe you can decipher the entire Truth Enlightenment?"
<br><br>
In truth, Geoffrey had already deciphered it all.
<br><br>
But Zen would not tell him that.
<br><br>
Instead, his face saddened and he said, "The structures of the Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment are extremely special. It's indeed very difficult to find a correct answer and decipher them, but I've found a method I think could make it possible."
<br><br>
He actually had no idea how to decipher the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
He had just heard these words from Geoffrey and decided to vomit them out now.
<br><br>
When he met Athemar, Zen knew that sooner or later he would meet Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
He hoped to rebuild the Nine Li race and the Oneness Sky Palace was the best ally he could have in his mission, especially considering they were against the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
With this in mind, Zen knew he should agree to a favor asked of him by Eastern Emperor Taiyi. But telling him deciphering the Sanskrit words was a piece of cake for Geoffrey was just not possible.
<br><br>
"You have found a method? What kind of method?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked, brimming with curiosity.
<br><br>
Deciphering the Truth Enlightenment was important work, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi was particularly interested in getting it done. After all, he had spent too much time and energy on deciphering the two Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
"The..." Zen hesitated before saying, "The method is difficult to explain.
<br><br>
The process relies heavily on inspiration and guesses."
<br><br>
Deciphering the Sanskrit words was something that was both mysterious and rigid. It was impossible for Zen to accurately describe it, because it was far from an easy task. Otherwise, all of the Sanskrit words in the world would be deciphered effortlessly.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was eager to examine Zen's memory, but since doing so was quite rude, he opted against it.
<br><br>
"All right." Eastern Emperor Taiyi waved his hand. "Last time Athemar told me that you have deciphered and comprehended 150 words of the Truth Enlightenment. Have you made any progress since?"
<br><br>
"I've been cultivating on the Other Shore since then. I haven't had much time, but I've deciphered more than 200 words," Zen replied.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes lit up once more.
<br><br>
According to Zen, it might be possible to decipher all the content of the Truth Enlightenment, but it could take from ten to over ten thousand years...
<br><br>
If Zen had deciphered 50 more words in his spare time, Eastern Emperor Taiyi believed that at this speed, it wouldn't be long till he deciphered all of it.
<br><br>
"May I have a look?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked, his voice trembling with eagerness.
<br><br>
Zen obliged happily.
<br><br>
He had intended to help him anyway, and he still had to tell him about the matter of the Nine Li race. As he saw it, he would exchange the Truth Enlightenment for his help. He just needed to see if Eastern Emperor Taiyi had the resolve and courage to assist him.
<br><br>
Zen took out a pen and a paper and began writing.
<br><br>
In a matter of moments, he had written the translation of the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi took the paper and examined the words. He recited the words silently to himself, a strong sense of admiration washing over him.
<br><br>
He then carefully folded the paper and said, "Chiyou is lucky to have you as his grandson, but unfortunately..."
<br><br>
When the Nine Li race was destroyed, the Oneness Sky Palace was overtaken by tension and shock because of what happened. Eastern Emperor Taiyi felt sorry for them and that feeling had always lived in his heart.
<br><br>
After the Nine Li race was destroyed, there were only three of the four great orthodox human forces left.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the Oneness Sky Palace did not support the Bearing race, and it seemed they would attack the Oneness Sky Palace sooner or later.
<br><br>
Emperor Charm, who once had a good relationship with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, had turned his back on him. This was all part of the Bearing race's plot.
<br><br>
Hearing the sigh of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Zen stood silently.
<br><br>
"What do you want?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi suddenly asked.
<br><br>
All swordsmen could benefit greatly from the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi did not think Zen would give over the translation without asking for something in return.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had also just alluded to the Nine Li race, which must mean he had seen through Zen's thoughts and known what was coming.
<br><br>
Since Eastern Emperor Taiyi had asked him directly, Zen answered him directly, "I want to rebuild the Nine Li race and I wish for the Oneness Sky Palace to assist me."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not surprised at all. He waved his hand and said, "I can help you. The whole Oneness Sky Palace will help you, but not yet."
<br><br>
"Then, when will you help me?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"When the war between them fully begins," answered Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Most people would probably not know who "them" referred to.
<br><br>
However, Zen had explored the Dark Region and he had inherited the Civilization Artifact. He also understood that those super forces in the Source World were basically the spokespersons of certain civilizations.
<br><br>
"Does 'them' you just talked about refer to the previous civilizations?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"You know of this?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi was truly taken aback this time.
<br><br>
He thought Zen, who had just reached Stage Thirteen, didn't even know the layout of the Other Shore. How could he know the existence of those civilizations? Several Oneness Governors would from time to time report important information to Eastern Emperor Taiyi's soul fragment.
<br><br>
But he still had no knowledge of the fact that Zen had stepped into the Dark Region, and that Elvinia had become a purified being.
<br><br>
Chapter 3358 Leaving "Yes, I've heard of them," Zen responded along with a nod.
<br><br>
In fact, he was not merely aware of them.
<br><br>
He had the full support of the Regal Jade Civilization, one of the top ten civilizations.
<br><br>
With Zen's improvements on the Other Shore, the Regal Jade Civilization would have a far-reaching advantage if they were to join the games again.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Eastern Emperor Taiyi gazed deeply at Zen, as if deep in thought.
<br><br>
Ever since the establishment of the Oneness Sky Palace, he had seen a number of young people with extraordinary strengths and talents.
<br><br>
However, no one had ever come close to Zen's excellence.
<br><br>
After their short discussion, Eastern Emperor Taiyi found that Zen kept many secrets, which made him feel that he could not see him through.
<br><br>
"You know much, but your cultivation is still too low," Eastern Emperor Taiyi muttered. "But as you know, the Chaotic Source World will be opened soon. For the Other Shore Realm warriors, the Chaotic Source Reinforcement is an important threshold they must cross. You must seize this opportunity."
<br><br>
"I have been fully prepared," replied Zen, bowing his head.
<br><br>
He had said this but in actuality, he was a little confused.
<br><br>
Based on Chance's performance, the corporeal body of the Chaotic Source Realm proved to be very strong.
<br><br>
However, if Zen absorbed a few more Shade Stones and used them to protect his body, he would surely have the physical strength as strong as those who went through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, maybe even stronger than them.
<br><br>
Was it even necessary for the warriors at the Other Shore Realm to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement? After a few minutes, Zen left Eastern Emperor Taiyi's place.
<br><br>
Their meeting didn't last long, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi hadn't actually given Zen anything. But at the end of the day, Zen had gotten exactly what he wanted, namely Eastern Emperor Taiyi's promise.
<br><br>
There had to be countless rare treasures and theurgies in the Oneness Sky Palace, but Zen wanted nothing to do with them. Moreover, he was not interested in garnering a bubble reputation.
<br><br>
After Zen left, a person emerged from a corner in Eastern Emperor Taiyi's pavilion. The long cerise dress outlined her slim figure. It was Flamine.
<br><br>
"Your Majesty, why didn't you summon me but Zen after you woke up?"
<br><br>
said Flamine, flustered and frustrated. Before Eastern Emperor Taiyi, she was a very gentle woman.
<br><br>
"My dear, you know very well of Zen's importance," Eastern Emperor Taiyi responded, taking her in his arms. "If I get the Truth Enlightenment, I may be able to make a further breakthrough in swordsmanship."
<br><br>
"I'm sure you will make progress in swordsmanship sooner or later," she responded in a coquettish tone. "Take your time."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head. "In fact, there is not much time left.
<br><br>
At this very moment, a catastrophe is happening on the Other Shore."
<br><br>
"A catastrophe?" Flamine gasped, holding her finger tips to her lips.
<br><br>
"Yes, I'm afraid they are eager for action." Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes revealed his worry. "At this point, it doesn't matter if I die. But I can't bear to see the countless living creatures in the Bloom Divine Province suffer."
<br><br>
In the several provinces under the jurisdiction of the Oneness Sky Palace, many clans were thriving with populations of at least ten billion. If the Oneness Sky Palace became involved, how would these people ever be able to defend themselves? Flamine noticed the look on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's face and comforted him, "They were born at this time, so they won't be able to escape such a catastrophe. If we lose, they will have nowhere to stay in the whole chaos, let alone the Bloom Divine Province. Unless they have the needed qualifications to hide on the Other Shore."
<br><br>
The only shield in the chaos was the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But who knew how many people could just hide on the Other Shore in a round of civilization? "Even if we escape to the Other Shore, we may not escape death," Eastern Emperor Taiyi continued.
<br><br>
"Why is that?" Flamine asked, wondering what could be so bad about the escape.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked at her, seeing that she did not know much.
<br><br>
"They want to destroy everything, including the Other Shore."
<br><br>
Flamine's eyes grew wide, her hands suddenly covering her mouth. "What?! That's crazy!"
<br><br>
Even if the chaos was destroyed, the supreme masters in the Source World would eventually have a way out. They could hide on the Other Shore to save themselves.
<br><br>
This was the privilege of the strong.
<br><br>
Flamine knew the consequences of destroying the Other Shore, so this idea took her by surprise.
<br><br>
"I will not discuss this now." Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head, changing the subject. "Several days ago, you said you wanted a talk with me. What's the matter?"
<br><br>
In fact, Flamine was going to ask Eastern Emperor Taiyi for help. She was at a loss of what to do with Elvinia.
<br><br>
But when she needed help, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was still on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Flamine smiled and said, "Don't worry about it. Elvinia has recovered well."
<br><br>
"Elvinia? What happened to her?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked with concern. He was always concerned about his youngest daughter, Elvinia, who had extraordinary talents.
<br><br>
"She... She has become a purified being," Flamine said.
<br><br>
"A purified being?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi was stunned by the news.
<br><br>
He knew exactly what purified being meant. A purified being was a powerhouse who ruled an entire stage on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Yes." Flamine nodded.
<br><br>
"How could this be possible? Purified beings only come from the Other Shore. How did Elvinia become one?" This surprised Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
"Actually, Zen has something to do with it," said Flamine.
<br><br>
"It's him again!" After Eastern Emperor Taiyi departed from the Other Shore, he was able to gather interesting information that had something to do with Zen. Zen's name appeared too many times for him to forget it.
<br><br>
"It's a long story," Flamine expressed. "But I'll make sure to explain it to you in detail."
<br><br>
When Zen returned to the Heavenly Cultivation Palace, he saw that Nelly, Lavender, and Laquisha had packed their clothes and were about to leave.
<br><br>
After everything that happened with Jean, it was pointless for them to stay at the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
However, just as they approached the gate of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace, Elvinia suddenly appeared before them.
<br><br>
"You have recovered?" Zen asked with a genuine smile.
<br><br>
Elvinia's posture was tall, and her expression was as cold as ice. She wore a long blue dress, looking quite elegant and sophisticated.
<br><br>
It was hard to read her, especially with coldness in her blue eyes.
<br><br>
The Memory Flame recorded everything. After Teague's memory was removed, her memory had been completely restored. This made everything clear to her, especially the incident in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Recalling that she had followed Zen like a little puppy, she blushed in embarrassment.
<br><br>
"Little Master!"
<br><br>
"Little Master, you've finally recovered!"
<br><br>
Nelly, Laquisha and Lavender were happy to see Elvinia healthy and well, most especially because of Elvinia's kindness towards them all.
<br><br>
"It seems that you're heading somewhere." Elvinia blinked, looking at all the bags they carried. "Are you leaving?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Laquisha responded. "Thanks to you in these days, our cultivation base has improved by leaps and bounds. But we seem to have offended Lady Jean, and we don't want to cause more trouble by staying in the Phoenix Palace."
<br><br>
"Lady Jean? What happened?" Elvinia frowned. She was unaware of this.
<br><br>
"When you were gone, they..." Nelly told Elvinia what had happened recently.
<br><br>
After hearing Nelly's explanation, Elvinia felt a chill come over her.
<br><br>
"Chance? Ahmad? They are quite bold!" she sneered.
<br><br>
No descendants of the Phoenix Palace ever dared to offend Elvinia.
<br><br>
Even a Chaotic Source Realm cultivator like Chance would make a detour if he ever came across her.
<br><br>
Little did she know that they started a fight when she was gone.
<br><br>
Chapter 3359 The Ticket Elvinia accepted them as disciples just on a whim, not formally.
<br><br>
But after some time, they developed quite a good relationship.
<br><br>
Now, when Elvinia saw that Nelly and the other two were going to leave soon, sadness overcame her. "There's no need for you to leave," she said, like an afterthought.
<br><br>
"But..." Nelly gave Zen a look.
<br><br>
Before the latter could say anything, Elvinia walked up to take Nelly's hand and stood before Lavender and Laquisha. She glared at Zen coldly and said, "Although I can't call myself their master, we've been getting along well these days. You can't just take them with you."
<br><br>
Elvinia's behavior both angered and amused Zen in return. He knew that at the beginning, she took them to the Phoenix Palace with an ulterior motive.
<br><br>
"I've offended Lady Jean. If they stay in the Phoenix Palace, I can't guarantee their safety," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
The narrow-minded Jean carried much resentment in her heart. Since she couldn't take it out on Zen, she was likely to cause Nelly, Lavender, and Laquisha some trouble. Zen didn't want to allow that to happen.
<br><br>
"I promise I'll keep them safe and sound at the palace," Elvinia assured him.
<br><br>
"How? When the Chaotic Source World opens, won't you also leave the Oneness Sky Palace? How will you protect them then?" Zen questioned skeptically.
<br><br>
"I will leave them to my mother, and I won't let anything happen to them,"
<br><br>
Elvinia said firmly. Turning to Lavender and the other two, she said softly, "Please stay in the Phoenix Palace."
<br><br>
Elvinia's determination piqued Zen's curiosity.
<br><br>
It seemed the damage to her Memory Flame somehow affected her personality as well.
<br><br>
When Laquisha, Nelly, and Lavender heard Elvinia's request, they exchanged uncertain glances. "Zen," Nelly then uttered, "we'd better stay at the Phoenix Palace for now..."
<br><br>
Seeing Elvinia's sincerity, the three felt unwilling to leave. Pursing his lips, Zen merely shrugged and agreed.
<br><br>
Although he could give them good cultivation resources, he knew that they could learn a lot more at the Phoenix Palace than with him. If Elvinia was that certain she could take care of them, then Zen would let them have that opportunity.
<br><br>
After he returned to the Flow Sword Sect, Zen began sorting out the Other Shore Tokens he had obtained in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
In addition to the Civilization Artifact, the two Hearts of Accomplice along with the Regal Jade Beast Elvinia had killed were the most precious objects.
<br><br>
Upon their death, the Regal Jade creatures would turn into statues which served as their corpses.
<br><br>
If Zen fused with the statue, it would greatly strengthen the defense level of his physical body. He could even transform into a Regal Jade body. This was known as an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Such an Other Shore Token was indeed rare, but Zen could only fuse with three Other Shore Tokens. The Strength God Totem was responsible for his power's eruption, the demonic eye could disturb his opponent's mind at the most critical moments, and the Civilization Artifact served as Zen's core token.
<br><br>
The three of them were indispensable, so before entering the Desire World, he did not intend to replace any of them.
<br><br>
The two Hearts of Accomplice were even more precious.
<br><br>
Zen had Dorothy give one of the two to the Origin Mountain, planning to keep the other. After Winchell knew of the matter, he, Athemar, and Goran went to purchase it right away.
<br><br>
It was an important item for a super force—it was only natural that Athemar and the rest were eager to possess it.
<br><br>
Such a token could give one the ability to kill a top-level opponent by sacrificing their own life. While it was a powerful weapon for a super force, it wasn't exactly suitable for Zen's needs. He would've never allowed his companions to fuse with it at the cost of their lives.
<br><br>
Before the opening of the Chaotic Source World, Zen began his cultivation as well.
<br><br>
It wasn't particularly difficult to comprehend the Blood Essence Godly Way, but fusing it with the other Godly Ways was another matter. While he had enough time, Zen still had extreme difficulty fusing successfully.
<br><br>
Zen also needed to enter the Flow Tower to cultivate the Flow Swordsmanship.
<br><br>
But with Letitia and Margaret's company, it seemed as though time went by too fast.
<br><br>
After two months, Milo finally recovered and returned.
<br><br>
The last time he used a secret skill, his soul was damaged severely, putting him in a long-lasting coma. The Flow Sword Sect poured many efforts into his recovery, paying a great price for it.
<br><br>
He then began his cultivation in seclusion after visiting Zen.
<br><br>
Now, there were only two months left before the Chaotic Source World was opened to the public. Naturally, Milo wasn't willing to miss the opportunity, so he wasted no time improving his cultivation base and strength.
<br><br>
During this period of time, the atmosphere in the Oneness Sky Palace became quiet.
<br><br>
Almost all of the disciples who had reached Stage Thirteen were cultivating.
<br><br>
A ticket to the Chaotic Source World was highly precious—the Oneness Sky Palace wasn't exempted from striving hard for more tickets. But in the end, they couldn't garner enough. A bulk would be eliminated and couldn't go to the Chaotic Source World. Of course, no one wanted to come across that misfortune.
<br><br>
And it wasn't only the Oneness Sky Palace; all the super forces in the Source World were facing a similar situation.
<br><br>
Even these super forces had competed for the tickets behind the scenes.
<br><br>
Some small clans and forces bought the tickets even when the prices spiked up sky-high in the black market of the Ear Mouse race.
<br><br>
In the Black Mountain Guild, the stink lingered atop the Black Mountain.
<br><br>
Numerous corpses were piled up there, forming a little mountain of their own.
<br><br>
They belonged to huge beetles, evil wolves, and other creatures of various strange shapes.
<br><br>
When they were alive, all these creatures were extraordinarily strong, having reached at least the twelfth or thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
But they had all fallen during the vicious battle on the Black Mountain.
<br><br>
"Awoo!"
<br><br>
With a final, great roar, a huge fierce ape rushed toward the Evil God.
<br><br>
Even as the ape was severely injured, it was unwilling to accept the fact.
<br><br>
So long as it killed the human being in front of it, it could gain the ticket to the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Another step and it could succeed.
<br><br>
The Evil God watched the approaching fierce ape with a wicked smile.
<br><br>
When he pointed at it gently, his soul aura burst from his body.
<br><br>
It was extraordinarily strong. It flowed and rushed toward the fierce ape.
<br><br>
The moment the creature was enveloped by the aura, it almost lost itself.
<br><br>
"Why is his Soul of Light... so powerful?"
<br><br>
In the ape's confusion, it felt a sharp pain at the back of its head. Its consciousness was then smashed in an instant. Its huge and strong head fell to pieces.
<br><br>
The Evil God merely stepped on the ape's corpse and continued up to the peak of the mountain.
<br><br>
Now, he alone stood proudly on the Black Mountain.
<br><br>
The monsters and beasts of the Black Mountain Guild all looked up at him from afar.
<br><br>
"It's too easy," said the Evil God as he stood atop the mountain. He then took out the token of the Black Mountain Guild and crushed it in his hand with pride. Looking up to the sky, he mumbled, "Will you be late?"
<br><br>
The Black Ship was approaching him from the sky.
<br><br>
It was moving rapidly, almost ominously.
<br><br>
When it stopped right by the Black Mountain, Shera, clad in a long black dress, descended from it and stopped right above the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Don't stand above me," growled the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Cut the crap. Take it and come with us."
<br><br>
Without another word, she threw a black card at him. It was a ticket to the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Four small runes that were drawn on the ticket absorbed the internal divine crystal energy and spread it around. If any of its corners was damaged, the entire ticket would be broken into pieces.
<br><br>
It was safe to say that since the ticket to the Chaotic Source World was too precious, many creatures had dared to make copies of it.
<br><br>
That was why the tickets were made in such a clever way, to prevent plagiarism.
<br><br>
The Evil God held the ticket close to his face, then looked at it with a critical eye.
<br><br>
He had suffered a lot during his time in the Black Mountain Guild, especially when he was a newcomer. Some warriors at the Other Shore Realm had even subdued him too much with their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Yet, he never yielded. In fact, he had even made rapid progress in just a short amount of time. Eventually, he had gotten to either defeat or kill those who had once repressed him.
<br><br>
He had gone through so much for just this little ticket.
<br><br>
He casually tucked it into the space ring and said, "Is there any way to get me a space ring on the Other Shore? I got so many Other Shore Tokens but I can't take them away. What a pity!"
<br><br>
It was actually easy to create Sumeru Space on the Other Shore. The super powers usually raised Thunder Beasts in their temples and they all had their own unique technology to make space rings.
<br><br>
The only thing was Evil God had always acted on his own and had no contact with the others on the Other Shore. Who would make a space ring for him? He had wanted to rush into the temples and force them to carve a space ring for him. But to his disappointment, they had set up restriction against the outsiders in their temples. No matter how strong his Soul of Light was, there was nothing he could do.
<br><br>
Therefore, he had no choice but to throw away many tokens he'd obtained on the Other Shore, save for some extremely valuable ones that were hidden in his Soul of Light. That was really a great pity for him.
<br><br>
When Shera heard his words, she glanced contemptuously at him and said, "The Other Shore Tokens obtained in the Lust World are just rubbish. It's not a waste to throw them away. Besides, we don't have any allies in the Lust World."
<br><br>
The Black Ship had a very small population, but each of its members was a peerless master. They wouldn't have gone to the Lust World if it weren't for some special reasons.
<br><br>
"No! You are rubbish!" Evil God spat back.
<br><br>
He truly hated it when others doubted him. It was just like his time in the Black Mountain Guild all over again, wherein he killed anyone who ever dared to question him.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Shera turned around. Her eyes glittered coldly under her sleek, black bangs.
<br><br>
If it was another man who had provoked her like this, she would have killed him already. But now, she resisted the urge to tear Evil God up despite his arrogance.
<br><br>
Then, she reached out to pinch in the air above Evil God.
<br><br>
Evil God, who was an arrogant and invincible man in the Black Mountain Guild, was deformed by her squeeze without any ability to resist.
<br><br>
After that, Shera threw him abruptly into the Black Ship. The ship then started to speed up to the west.
<br><br>
At the same time, Athemar kept his promise and gave Zen a pile of tickets.
<br><br>
Zen held a pile of black cards in hand, which emitted a faint aura of divine crystal.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace didn't get many tickets to the Chaotic Source World this time. Moreover, all the sects of the seven mountains had to share the tickets.
<br><br>
As a result, the Flow Sword Sect got less. It wasn't easy for Athemar to get seven tickets for him.
<br><br>
"This ticket is so elaborate," Zen muttered to himself as he walked towards the house opposite to his.
<br><br>
As the opening time of the Chaotic Source World approached, Hutton, Sally and the others became more and more nervous.
<br><br>
That day, Athemar just promised that he would try his best to get the tickets, but all of them clearly knew how rare the tickets were.
<br><br>
"Hutton… What if the Oneness Sky Palace can't get us tickets?" Sally asked worriedly.
<br><br>
Hutton, who sat on the couch in the courtyard, shook his head and said, "We have no choice but to wait for the charity from them now."
<br><br>
"Then Grandpa's hope would be deflated. We'd gain nothing from our journey!" came Umar's cold rebuttal.
<br><br>
When Hutton saw that Umar had gotten a little mad, he reminded, "Don't forget that the Oneness Sky Palace doesn't owe us anything. They helped us for the sake of Zen.
<br><br>
It's not their duty to give us tickets!" "But Zen..." Umar said defiantly.
<br><br>
Just then, the door to the house was pushed open.
<br><br>
Restrictions had been set up in front of the door, so ordinary people couldn't open it.
<br><br>
They knew it must be Zen who had come in. "Young master!" Hutton suddenly stood up.
<br><br>
"Zen," Sally greeted him with a smile.
<br><br>
To be honest, Zen felt a little lightheaded when he was addressed in such a way. Yet since Hutton insisted, he didn't correct him anymore. It wouldn't work on him anyway.
<br><br>
Everyone of the Nine Li race looked nervous, and Zen naturally understood why. A smile appeared on his face. With a flick of his hand, a few black cards appeared in his palm. "Are you waiting for them?"
<br><br>
Once he revealed the stack of black cards, the others immediately went wild with joy.
<br><br>
The matter had worried them deeply over the past few days. Now that they'd gotten the tickets, they could finally sigh in relief.
<br><br>
After all, they weren't that confident in Zen as they hadn't had much contact with him before.
<br><br>
But Zen took his responsibility to help them since it was Ambrose who had brought them here in person.
<br><br>
If Athemar or even the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't get them tickets, Zen would buy enough from the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
"Young master..." Hutton tried to say something to show his gratitude, but he was speechless.
<br><br>
Zen waved his hand and said, "Since we are from the same race, you don't need to be too polite with me. There's only a month left. We're going to set off after we finish preparations."
<br><br>
The tickets to the Chaotic Source World were distributed to various sects in succession.
<br><br>
It wasn't easy for other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace to obtain even one.
<br><br>
Although Milo and Zen could get the tickets directly, the others of the Flow Sword Sect needed to compete for the remaining ten ones.
<br><br>
In addition, the Unique Array Sword Sect and the Killing Sword Sect also fell into a fierce competition because of those tickets.
<br><br>
Even the direct descendants had to win the competition to prove their strength before they could get the tickets.
<br><br>
A month later, a gentle wind blew through the sails of the seven giant flying ships as they slowly rose up. Soon enough, they had left the Oneness Sky Palace and flew westward.
<br><br>
The seven flying ships belonged to the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace, and the one that led them belonged to the Oneness Mountain. Of course, disciples from the Phoenix Palace and the three sword sects were in it.
<br><br>
To get to the Chaotic Source World, they had to cross over a hundred provinces. Even if the flying ships could penetrate space, they still had to pass through the walls between provinces when they reached the boundaries. Since they had to pause for a moment, it was clearly impossible for them to travel too fast.
<br><br>
Inside the huge flying ships were hundreds of cubicles that were arranged neatly.
<br><br>
Even though the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace were on the journey, they still continued to cultivate themselves tirelessly.
<br><br>
At the end of the day, the competition in the Chaotic Source World was also extremely fierce. Not everyone who entered it could get through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. Disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace either cultivated their Souls of Light on the Other Shore, consolidated their own sword theurgy, or practiced the use of their newly fused Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Half a month later, the seven flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace came out of the space barrier, and entered a snow-filled world.
<br><br>
Once they reached the cold place, all the disciples from the Oneness Mountain went up to the deck to have a bird's eye view of the area covered with snow and ice.
<br><br>
Zen leaned on the rail as the chilly air caressed his face.
<br><br>
They had now arrived at the Icy Snow Province, where the Chaotic Source World was located.
<br><br>
Chapter 3361 A Huge Black Egg The Icy Snow Province belonged to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Eleven provinces were under its jurisdiction, all of them lined up.
<br><br>
Among the eleven provinces, the Icy Snow Province was the farthest from the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Back then, the super forces had allied and forced the Pear Hill to hand over the Chaotic Source Spirits. The Pear Hill couldn't bear the pressure and chose to compromise instead.
<br><br>
The super forces also required placing the Chaotic Source World in the center of the Source World. But the Pear Hill firmly refused. After several rounds of discussion, they finally gave up the Icy Snow Province, turning it into a public area where the Chaotic Source World was placed.
<br><br>
Some super forces knew it was a long way to go, so half a year ago, they already set off.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace was relatively close to the Icy Snow Province, so it had only taken half a month to arrive.
<br><br>
The temperature in the Icy Snow Province was extremely low. An ordinary mortal could turn into an ice sculpture in mere seconds.
<br><br>
But for powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm, the temperature remained normal.
<br><br>
Even under such harsh conditions, many big cities were built in the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
As they approached the destination, many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace grew excited.
<br><br>
They gathered in pairs and trios to chat away and exchange information about the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Although this was their first time to enter the Chaotic Source World, some elders of the Oneness Sky Palace had offered them some tips.
<br><br>
Although they all belonged to the Oneness Mountain, the four factions were greatly different from each other.
<br><br>
The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace were the most arrogant. They occupied the very front of the flying ship. One of them even announced, "All of us from the Phoenix Palace must unite as one in the Chaotic Source World!"
<br><br>
"But my elder brother said that those Chaotic Source Spirits are scattered.
<br><br>
I'm afraid it'll be difficult to capture them if we hold together," another disciple retorted.
<br><br>
"It depends. Some other races are pretty violent. They'll start killing us mindlessly the moment we enter."
<br><br>
The Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect occupied the center of the flying ship, while the members of the Flow Sword Sect stayed in the rear with Milo and Konnor in the lead.
<br><br>
Although the six members of the Nine Li race were also on the ship, they made sure not to go out onto the deck because of their sensitive identity.
<br><br>
Zen stood on the side of the ship. Snowflakes whirled in the sky like a myriad of loose feathers. They dissipated before his eyes.
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source World is a barrier that all the warriors at the Other Shore Realm must face. Yan should be there too. I wonder if we will meet this time," Zen muttered to himself.
<br><br>
He had stayed in the Source World for many years. After losing contact with Emily and the rest, he never saw them again. Looking at the vast snow scene, he felt a faint sadness come over his heart.
<br><br>
At this time, a snow-white hand stretched out from Zen's right and caught a snowflake ever so gently. Gradually, it melted in the hand.
<br><br>
Zen turned around to find Elvinia standing behind him.
<br><br>
Her appearance caught everyone's attention.
<br><br>
She had always been as cold as ice. No one dared to get close to her.
<br><br>
"My father told me you must be careful in the Chaotic Source World,"
<br><br>
Elvinia said, watching the white snow in the distance.
<br><br>
"Eastern Emperor Taiyi?" Zen's eyes flashed.
<br><br>
Elvinia nodded in agreement. "The Bearing race will never give up on killing you. Sure, they don't know who you are, but I'm pretty sure they will come to the Chaotic Source World and take actions against you."
<br><br>
The corporeal body on the Other Shore was a great hindrance for them.
<br><br>
Now, Zen was formidable in all the thirteen stages. What if he one day reached the Desire World and the higher stages beyond it? It was something none of the Bearing race ever wanted to see.
<br><br>
There were no rules in the Chaotic Source World. They could kill anyone on a whim.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race had made it to the brink of war. If the Bearing race were to confirm that Thad was a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, they'd most likely work with the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race in slaughtering all the disciples from the palace.
<br><br>
This ruthless slaughter would ensure Thad's death.
<br><br>
"They can't do that, can they?" Zen asked with a smile.
<br><br>
"Everything is possible," Elvinia said in a serious tone.
<br><br>
"What about you?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
As a purified being, Elvinia had a physical body on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Everyone could see her face clearly.
<br><br>
This made her very easy to spot.
<br><br>
Not being able to hide her identity, she was even more conspicuous than Zen.
<br><br>
Compared to him, she was in more danger.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked and bared an innocent smile. "You've promised to protect me."
<br><br>
The smile on her flawless face somehow touched Zen. Although she had regained her memory, her journey in the Dark Region undoubtedly had a great influence on her. She had become even more approachable.
<br><br>
But Zen didn't know she acted normally when he wasn't around.
<br><br>
Because of Laquisha, Nelly, and Lavender, Elvinia taught the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace a lesson. The disciples who were to enter the Chaotic Source World kept their mouths shut when she was around.
<br><br>
"Right?" she added.
<br><br>
"Of course," Zen said with a helpless nod.
<br><br>
Elvinia pursed her lips in response before pointing to the front. "Look!"
<br><br>
A huge ring-like mountain appeared before them.
<br><br>
Outside it was a land of ice and snow while its interior was covered in a layer of black mist.
<br><br>
The entire mountain was covered in an enchanted barrier that spanned over three million miles. From afar, it resembled a huge black egg.
<br><br>
It was none other than the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
There were over a thousand huge stone pillars standing in front of the Chaotic Source World. Each one was engraved with the name of a super force. The flying ship of the Oneness Mountain flew toward its pillar and stopped right by it.
<br><br>
The flying ships of the other six mountains, including the Origin Mountain, the Golden Mountain, and the Bright Mountain also stopped by the pillar one after another.
<br><br>
Many flying ships parked beside the pillars. Some were covered in snow. It seemed like they had been there for a long time.
<br><br>
The disciples of the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace came down from the flying ships one after another before gathering.
<br><br>
The six Nine Li people followed closely behind Zen.
<br><br>
Seeing them, Konnor and the others thought it was rather strange. They didn't belong to the Flow Sword Sect. How did they get there by the flying ship? Curious as they were, no one bothered asking questions.
<br><br>
For each team, a powerful figure was appointed to lead them.
<br><br>
Athemar was appointed for the Oneness Mountain, while Winchell was chosen for the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
After flying past the many stone pillars under Athemar's leadership, they saw a huge, open area in front of them. The snow had been cleared out and the creatures of many races had occupied their respective corners.
<br><br>
Chapter 3362 Large Races Gathered Zen's gaze swept around the spacious square, and landed at some giant figures standing on the left side of the area.
<br><br>
"They are the Separate Abyss race," he muttered.
<br><br>
He had previously seen the Separate Abyss race on the Other Shore several times.
<br><br>
Although he wasn't able to see clearly how they looked back then on the Other Shore, the silhouettes of their Souls of Light showed the outline of their figures. Thus, he had recognized them in one glance.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race were all seventy to eighty feet tall, which made them look like small mountains when they stood there.
<br><br>
Every single one of them wore a special layer of golden armor. Their big eyes emitted a strong malicious aura, that they even looked down on everything quite condescendingly as they gazed around.
<br><br>
They were born with huge size and strong bodies. They were indeed superior to other races in terms of physical strength, which was why they were extremely arrogant.
<br><br>
Not far from them were the Ear Mice who sat up straight on the ground.
<br><br>
All of them wore masks and kept silent. They were much more low-key.
<br><br>
Everyone else thought that the Ear Mice weren't that strong when it came to combat strength, but that was because they rarely had conflicts with other races. They preferred to use divine crystals and soul pills to solve everything.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Zen's observation of them on the Other Shore indicated that their combat strength shouldn't actually be underestimated.
<br><br>
After all, all the best Other Shore Tokens were traded through their dealings--so the Other Shore Tokens they had merged with naturally couldn't be bad.
<br><br>
Aside from those two races, there were also the Rain race, the Celestial Wolf race, the Purple Ape race, and so on.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, one could tell the strength of a certain race from the number of creatures they had.
<br><br>
The stronger a race was, the higher authority they had, and the more tickets they could get.
<br><br>
For example, there were more than five hundred warriors of the Separate Abyss race. They currently had the largest number of warriors present.
<br><br>
Thus, they obviously obtained the highest number of tickets to the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the small races like the Celestial Wolf race and the Purple Ape race with about only twenty to thirty members, had a relatively weak overall strength.
<br><br>
The average super forces could get more than two hundred tickets, but this time, only a total of more than one hundred and eighty warriors from the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace had come. It meant that as of now, they were disadvantaged when it came to the distribution of tickets.
<br><br>
Once Athemar had entered the square, he cupped his hands towards the large races. Then, he found a corner and instructed the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace to wait there.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace sat on the ground with their legs crossed. They looked around just like Zen.
<br><br>
Of course, they couldn't help it because the creatures present were their potential competitors.
<br><br>
Not long after the disciples sat down, another whooshing sound came from the sky.
<br><br>
Dozens of flying ships flew across the clouds. One of them was so shockingly enormous that it looked like a floating city instead of a ship. In the center of this flying ship was a huge bear painted on the surface.
<br><br>
"The warriors of the Bearing race have come," whispered the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace Hutton, Sally and the other Nine Li members had been silently following behind Zen. When they saw the flying ship which was as huge as a city, their curious looks turned into trepidation.
<br><br>
They had never seen the Bearing race in the real world. This was their first time to meet them.
<br><br>
To be honest, they had already subconsciously regarded the Bearing race as a terrifying opponent. Now that they saw their grand entrance, they felt the fear and pressure rise in their hearts even more.
<br><br>
The most affected one was Sally, who unknowingly squeezed in beside Zen.
<br><br>
When Zen felt that Sally became a little nervous, his lips moved slightly and using his chaotic energy, he told her, "The Bearing race are also humans like us. Don't be afraid."
<br><br>
"But they have killed so many of our Nine Li people," Sally answered through her life vitality.
<br><br>
"Of course, blood will have blood. Fear can't solve anything," said Zen.
<br><br>
The journey of cultivation was like going through a single-log bridge. No matter how high one stood, they had to get rid of the fear from below-- otherwise, they would fall down and die.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was very important to keep calm and have a strong belief in oneself.
<br><br>
"But they are very powerful," Sally lamented.
<br><br>
"You'll become more powerful one day," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
Sally bowed her head and thought for a while. Then, she looked up again and determination flashed faintly in her beautiful eyes.
<br><br>
In fact, she was a very optimistic girl. It was just that the environment where she grew up in had always depicted the Bearing race as a horrible enemy.
<br><br>
Now, Zen also knew that it was hard for him to reduce the fear of the remaining members of the Nine Li race with only a few words. However, he only needed to prove that Bearing race were not invincible, and the fear in their hearts would be easily dissolved.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the flying ships had descended and the members of the Bearing race flew over through the stone pillars.
<br><br>
The warrior at the helm was an old man with a straight back. His eyes glinted fiercely and his every move indicated that he was vigorous and strong. He also cupped his hands towards the many large races, then led the members of the Bearing race to a corner.
<br><br>
After the arrival of the Bearing race, the members of the Sun Crow race, New Moon race, and the Divine Farmer race all followed one after another.
<br><br>
Over the years, the power of the human race, with the Bearing race as the leading force, had continued to expand.
<br><br>
The human race, which had originally appeared to be the weaker ones, now had the tendency to surpass the other super races. If the few super powers of human race were to unite, their strength would probably surpass that of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race's leader was Elizabeth.
<br><br>
She sauntered towards the front, her slender waist swaying lithely as she did so. A pure, golden pair of wings fluttered gently behind her back and overall, she exuded a breathtaking charm.
<br><br>
All the creatures present focused their eyes on her.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the sight of Elizabeth caused Zen to frown a little.
<br><br>
This woman's Illusory Projection had almost killed him back when he was in the Mountain Viewing Province. He didn't expect to meet her again this time.
<br><br>
However, they were at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World, and he had nothing to fear since he had the elders like Athemar to protect him.
<br><br>
After Elizabeth had walked around the square once, she walked towards them with a cold smile on her face.
<br><br>
This prompted Athemar to step forward and stand in front of the disciples.
<br><br>
He cupped his hands towards Elizabeth and said, "Master Elizabeth, I wonder what you came here for."
<br><br>
Elizabeth's gaze landed on Elvinia, and with a smile she spoke, "Nothing. I just want to see the traitor of our Sun Crow race. She will actually accept the Chaotic Source Reinforcement today. How time flies."
<br><br>
Elvinia's face darkened upon hearing those words. She stood up and hissed, "Dare you say it again!"
<br><br>
The years Elvinia had spent in the Divine Lair were nightmares that she would never want to look back all her life, but Elizabeth actually took the initiative to provoke her. Naturally, she was furious.
<br><br>
"Elizabeth, watch your mouth!" Athemar warned. He too, was displeased.
<br><br>
All of them gathered for one purpose: to enter the Chaotic Source World, and not to stir up trouble.
<br><br>
Still, Elizabeth ignored him and continued, "I didn't say anything wrong.
<br><br>
Your mother is a traitor, and you are a traitor as well. It's fine if you continue to hide in the Oneness Sky Palace like your mother. Since you dared to come to the Chaotic Source World, you must be mentally prepared for the fact that you might not be able to come back."
<br><br>
The light in Elvinia's eyes dimmed further. Just as she was about to retort, Zen suddenly stopped her and said, "There is no need to be so worked up on these birds."
<br><br>
Elizabeth hadn't noticed Zen at first. As soon as she saw Zen, she remembered that moment in the Mountain Viewing Province. Her face suddenly turned sour. "It's you?!"
<br><br>
She had performed the Illusory Projection several times to kill Zen but he had successfully escaped each time, so he left a deep impression on her.
<br><br>
At that time, however, Zen had only recently stepped onto the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Therefore, she was surprised that he would now be able to accept Chaotic Source Reinforcement after just a short amount of time.
<br><br>
Chapter 3363 Target At that moment, Elvinia's anger turned into confusion. She was curious as to how Elizabeth knew Zen.
<br><br>
"Yes, it's me," Zen replied with a faint smile.
<br><br>
Since he had promised Flamine to protect Elvinia, he had to take some of the pressure off of her.
<br><br>
Besides, Elizabeth immediately targeted the Oneness Sky Palace the moment she arrived. It was indeed too much.
<br><br>
Back then, Zen had taken the Shade Stone which caused Elizabeth to hold a grudge against him ever since.
<br><br>
It would've been more acceptable if it was a master like Athemar who had done such a thing, but the person who had snatched the Shade Stone away was a young man, a nobody--and Elizabeth felt greatly ashamed.
<br><br>
Moreover, he didn't even avoid her at all when he had faced her today.
<br><br>
Instead, he even had the guts to stand up for Elvinia and call her a bird. He was too bold! "Do you really think… that because someone is protecting you, you can be safe all the time?" she snarled murderously as a scorching soul aura spread from her being.
<br><br>
In turn, the disciples sitting on the ground stepped back when they sensed her strong aura.
<br><br>
She was so arrogant and domineering that she completely ignored the leaders of the seven mountains.
<br><br>
Even the usually calm Athemar looked visibly angry now. He released a sharp soul aura, which turned into a wall in front of the disciples as a response. Then, he declared, "Elizabeth, if you want to make a move, our Oneness Sky Palace is ready for a fight!"
<br><br>
At that point, Winchell and the elders of the other five mountains started to gather their strength. More and more powerful auras filled the space.
<br><br>
"Oh?" Elizabeth's lips stretched into a thin smile. "We're more than happy to see that the Oneness Sky Palace is ready to fight. Should we find a place then?"
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, the old leader of the Bearing race, a few leaders of the Divine Farmer race and the New Moon race all stepped out and stood beside Elizabeth.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source World hadn't even opened yet, but the atmosphere already became too tense.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, anyone with a keen eye could see that the Oneness Sky Palace was at a disadvantage.
<br><br>
In fact, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had already expected this to happen.
<br><br>
It became worse especially because Zen had anonymously destroyed the temple of the Bearing race. Thus, the Bearing race had every reason to hate him to the core and desire to eliminate him as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Moreover, they had already known that Elvinia had a physical body on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Now, the truth was they had already discussed their plans for their arrival before they set out. Elizabeth would show up first to provoke them.
<br><br>
Hopefully the Oneness Sky Palace would bite the bait, as it was exactly what they wanted to see. If they tolerated it, however, then they would've still achieved their goal of discouraging the morale of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, and they could just come back to it after they had entered the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
This trip to the Chaotic Source World was also the start of their plan to completely cut ties with the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"What the hell is going on inside the human race! They are having an internal conflict?" "I think so! Hahahaha…" A few members of the Separate Abyss race watched them and laughed.
<br><br>
Over the years, the human race had risen very fast, especially the Bearing race, which had grown to a point that even the Separate Abyss race and other large races had to take them seriously. From the looks of it, the Bearing race simply wanted to get rid of the Oneness Sky Palace as soon as possible--which was what the non-human races wanted as well.
<br><br>
"It's against the rules to fight here..."
<br><br>
"As long as Pear Hill doesn't interfere, it doesn't matter what they do."
<br><br>
"I'm afraid the Oneness Sky Palace will be doomed!"
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Athemar, Winchell, and the rest of them went pale with shock.
<br><br>
They knew it was not realistic to fight in the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
Left with no choice, the Pear Hill had made the Icy Snow Province a public province. Still, they had set rules when they made the decision.
<br><br>
One of the rules was that it was forbidden to fight in the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, none of the warriors from the Pear Hill showed up. If Elizabeth and the powerful masters who supported her really made a move now that they were outside the Chaotic Source World, all the Oneness Sky Palace disciples present would probably be killed.
<br><br>
Even Athemar, Winchell, and the other leaders of the mountains might not be able to protect themselves.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace is very famous and they claim they have the best swordsmanship. But, it's actually a place where all the cowards have gathered. Hahaha..."
<br><br>
"That human force is made up of a group of weak warriors. What do you expect of them?"
<br><br>
"They are actually so weak to such an extent. They are simply wasting those tickets! Why don't they just give them to other worthy people?"
<br><br>
Taunts and jeers from the Bearing race began to fill the air.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were naturally furious, but they knew better than to refute in such a situation.
<br><br>
"Now... What do you think about my suggestion?" Elizabeth asked Athemar as she looked at him with a charming smile.
<br><br>
Just as Athemar was caught in a dilemma, a loud thud interrupted his thoughts. A man suddenly fell from the sky and smashed into the ground.
<br><br>
The man wore a black cloak and because he crashed against the floor, they couldn't see his face clearly.
<br><br>
He got up after a few moments and once the crowd had a clear view of him, their curiosity became surprise.
<br><br>
It was Human Sovereign, Fuxi! It was known that he had disappeared from the Source World for a very long time.
<br><br>
No one knew where he had gone, and someone even asserted that he had died in some place within the chaos.
<br><br>
No one expected that he would appear on the day when the Chaotic Source World was about to open! It wasn't until he stood up straight that everyone noticed that he held a wine jar in his hand. His eyes glazed over and he seemed intoxicated.
<br><br>
He slowly walked towards Elizabeth's direction. However, he completely ignored her and the powerful masters from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race who stood behind her.
<br><br>
"Human Sovereign..." Athemar muttered.
<br><br>
He looked at Fuxi respectfully and gave him a salute.
<br><br>
Both Athemar and Winchell were confused. They had no idea what on earth Fuxi was up to.
<br><br>
Once again, everyone was surprised when Fuxi ignored Athemar and directly went past him. Instead, he took a single step and floated towards Zen like a ghost. He slung an arm over Zen's shoulder as he said, "Hey young man, we met again!"
<br><br>
Zen had once experienced the powerful strength of this man back when he was in the bottom of the chaos.
<br><br>
Now that he had reached Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore and that his Soul of Light had become more powerful and sensitive, Fuxi still gave him the feeling that his strength was incomparably unfathomable.
<br><br>
"Yes, what a coincidence!" Zen replied calmly.
<br><br>
"Humph! Coincidence? I've been waiting for you all this time, but you are too late. You haven't accepted the Chaotic Source Reinforcement yet. How long are you going to let me wait?"
<br><br>
Fuxi's question puzzled Zen. "Why are you waiting for me?" Zen asked back.
<br><br>
"Of course, to kill you and replace you when the right time comes," said Fuxi with a grin.
<br><br>
Despite the smile on Fuxi's face and his drunken state, there was a hint of seriousness in his glassy eyes. Zen's heart skipped a beat. This fellow didn't seem to be joking.
<br><br>
Of course, he didn't know Fuxi's long-cherished wish.
<br><br>
After Fuxi had figured out the Chaos Ancient God's intentions, he began to take Zen seriously as his target.
<br><br>
Though Zen had grown at a very outrageous speed, he was still too slow in Fuxi's eyes.
<br><br>
The others who were present were dumbfounded, as they had no idea what Fuxi was talking about.
<br><br>
His strength could definitely allow him to kill Zen with just one finger, so why would he wait until Zen had grown really strong? Furthermore, even if Zen would really grow with his power, could he become as powerful as a man like Fuxi in the future? Elizabeth and those who stood around her were also baffled. Fuxi appeared so suddenly and unexpectedly, and they didn't know what to do next.
<br><br>
At that moment, Fuxi turned towards Elizabeth and the others, then said, "Remember, I don't care about what you do in the Chaotic Source World, but if anyone dares to fight in the Icy Snow Province, I won't show any mercy."
<br><br>
Chapter 3364 Threat Fuxi was not shouting but his words were audible enough for everyone to hear clearly. Then, there was a moment of dead silence.
<br><br>
The Icy Snow Province used to be a part of the Pear Hill, so it was close to it.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the strongest warriors of the super forces, such as the Sun Crow race, the Bearing race, and the Separate Abyss race didn't come.
<br><br>
Everyone was anxious as they knew the price of disobedience.
<br><br>
Even Elizabeth couldn't contain her anger.
<br><br>
Her goal was to give the Oneness Sky Palace a fatal head-on blow to weaken their morale.
<br><br>
The news that arrived from the Other Shore frustrated the members of the Sun Crow race and the Bearing race. The man named Thad had attacked these several super forces relentlessly but they could do nothing to him.
<br><br>
However, Elizabeth didn't expect that Fuxi himself would show up personally.
<br><br>
"Human Sovereign, does this mean that we can fight outside the Icy Snow Province?" Elizabeth asked as she gnashed her teeth.
<br><br>
She thought that if Emperor Charm of the Sun Crow race, the Yellow Thearch of the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer were here, they might not succumb in fear to Fuxi.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, they were in Fuxi's territory now, so they had no choice but to yield for the time being.
<br><br>
"Yeah, that's right." Fuxi shrugged, with a fierce glint in his eyes. He stared at Elizabeth and continued, "But I have to warn you about one thing. If anyone dares to lay a finger on this young man, death will be the consequence."
<br><br>
Zen was the one chosen by the Chaos Ancient God, so Fuxi certainly wouldn't let anyone else kill him.
<br><br>
Of course, Fuxi knew that it wouldn't be easy to bring Zen down. He just deliberately advised Elizabeth and the others not to use any underhanded tricks on his watch.
<br><br>
As they heard Fuxi's threat, everyone was taken aback. Elizabeth's face changed, just as the leaders of the other races.
<br><br>
The younger generation who were present also became confused.
<br><br>
"What's so amazing about him? Why does the Human Sovereign protect him to that degree?"
<br><br>
"Didn't you hear? It's because Fuxi regards him as his rival. Of course he won't let anyone else lay a finger on him."
<br><br>
"What? How could he be a rival of the Human Sovereign? That's insane!"
<br><br>
Those who were about to enter the Chaotic Source World were all shocked.
<br><br>
Even if they had managed to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement and improve their strength to a higher level, they were still considered weak in the Source World where many extremely powerful people dwelled. Even Athemar and Elizabeth could kill them effortlessly, let alone Fuxi.
<br><br>
They were all actually in the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. It was impossible that there was a huge gap in strength between them.
<br><br>
At the same time, a huge flying ship had arrived.
<br><br>
At the sight of the flying ship, a faint smile appeared in Fuxi's drunk face.
<br><br>
"Here comes your sister," Fuxi told Zen as he patted him on the shoulder.
<br><br>
'Sister? Did he just say that Zen has a sister? And this sister that he's talking about is from the Pear Hill?' Elvinia's eyes widened in shock.
<br><br>
Even Dorothy was puzzled.
<br><br>
She knew Zen's origin but she didn't know that he had a connection with the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Athemar and Winchell glared at Zen while letting out a stifled bitter laugh.
<br><br>
They thought that Zen, a surviving descendant of the Nine Li race, had no one to back him up. Supposedly, his full loyalty would be to the Oneness Sky Palace. With the turn of events, they realized that they underestimated him.
<br><br>
Only Sally, Hutton, and the other Nine Li people knew of the truth because of the information that Leopold had told them.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill's flying ship didn't stop beside the stone pillars but continuously floated in the air.
<br><br>
Not long after, several hundred beings were seen jumping out of the flying ship. They turned out to be the members of the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The Pear Hill was comprised of the Snake Goddess race and some humans who had the blood of the Snake Goddess race, like Emily. These half-blood members, though belonging to the Snake Goddess race, were still humans.
<br><br>
Similarly, even though Elvinia had the blood of the Sun Crow race, she didn't have a pair of big golden wings on her back like Elizabeth.
<br><br>
About five hundred members of the Pear Hill had come, a little more than those of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
Most of them were half human and half snake, dragging a long tail. Nearly a third of them looked the same as humans.
<br><br>
Just as they landed, a human girl quickly came out from them.
<br><br>
It was Yan who was searching for Zen. Soon after, she finally found him staying with the people of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
Yan rushed towards Zen and embraced him tightly.
<br><br>
She missed Zen very much. Zen was expected to come when the Chaotic Source World opened. Now that she finally saw Zen, she was overjoyed.
<br><br>
"Yan, I'm glad you're alright."
<br><br>
Though Zen knew that she was safe under Emily's protection in the Pear Hill, he was still worried that it would be hard for a young girl like her to stay there alone.
<br><br>
He was glad that his worry seemed to be unnecessary.
<br><br>
"Hey! You didn't say anything strange to my brother, did you?" Yan suddenly turned to Fuxi and stared at him fiercely.
<br><br>
She knew something about Fuxi and became worried that he might do something bad to her brother.
<br><br>
Others didn't know if Fuxi owed her or if she had something on him for her to dare to talk to him in a very uninhibited manner.
<br><br>
Even Zen was surprised to hear Yan speaking that way.
<br><br>
After all, Fuxi was the Human Sovereign.
<br><br>
Elvinia, Dorothy, Athemar, and the others were so shocked that they had a hard time breathing due to apprehension.
<br><br>
They couldn't believe the audacity of Zen's sister.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the members of the Snake Goddess race looked calm, as if they had already been accustomed to this kind of scene.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Fuxi's reaction was beyond everyone's expectation. He was even no longer drunk as he responded submissively, "No, of course not!"
<br><br>
"If you dare talk nonsense to my brother, you're going to get it," Yan said with a stern face as she waved her fist in front of him.
<br><br>
Everyone was stunned as they didn't know what was going on.
<br><br>
The title of the Human Sovereign was a symbol of strength and status.
<br><br>
As one of the most powerful masters in the Source World, Fuxi exuded an aura of unmatched authority. However, none of those seemed to matter as he stood passively in front of Yan.
<br><br>
Athemar and the others were extremely shocked.
<br><br>
They couldn't stop thinking of what could have possibly happened between them.
<br><br>
They observed that Yan enjoyed a high status in the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
She was surrounded by a crowd of the Pear Hill members as she got off the flying ship.
<br><br>
However, that wasn't an enough explanation for what was happening.
<br><br>
How could Yan scold the Human Sovereign in this way, and why didn't he dare to retort? It was a scene that nobody would believe if they didn't see it with their own eyes and hear with their ears.
<br><br>
Being threatened by Yan in public, Fuxi felt a bit humiliated. Thus, he tried to make an escape. He said, "Well, I don't need to keep the order here.
<br><br>
Members of the Pear Hill, please go to your place."
<br><br>
After saying that, he no longer gave Yan any chance to speak. His figure swiftly distorted and flashed away in front of everyone.
<br><br>
"Damn it! I can't believe he just ran away like that!"
<br><br>
From Yan's expression, it seemed that she wasn't really finished yet, and had no intention of letting Fuxi go at all.
<br><br>
Chapter 3365 The Black Ship Came Elizabeth and the others returned to their places too.
<br><br>
Yan's behavior left them speechless.
<br><br>
The pieces of the puzzle finally clicked in her mind. It finally dawned on her why Zen had so many powerful Latent Theurgies, why he showed incredible ability even when he was at an early stage of the Other Shore Realm and why he wasn't afraid of the burning of the divine flames of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
He must have an amazing background! But now, Elizabeth had a new question.
<br><br>
With Zen's sister daring to act so rudely in front of Fuxi, she couldn't help but wonder exactly who their parents were.
<br><br>
Most of the creatures present were beginning to ask the same question. No one in the Source World could make Fuxi react like this. What kind of background did Zen and Yan have? All the disciples of the Flow Sword Sect, the Unique Array Sword Sect and the Killing Sword Sect were shocked by what had happened.
<br><br>
"Konnor, that disciple of your Flow Sword Sect seems to have a strong background!" a disciple of the Killing Sword Sect exclaimed.
<br><br>
"Isn't he the one who won first place in the Seven Mountains Meeting? He doesn't have a powerful background, does he?" a disciple of the Unique Array Sword Sect asked in a hushed tone.
<br><br>
Konnor and Milo from the Flow Sword Sect didn't know what to say.
<br><br>
In Konnor's eyes, Zen was just like Milo, who had worked his way up the Oneness Sky Palace on his own merits.
<br><br>
How would he know if there were some hidden truths behind it? Meanwhile, Chaim and Efrain, the two top talents from the Oneness Sky Palace, shot each other a meaningful look.
<br><br>
Zen's talent had made the two of them feel a little discouraged before, but knowing better now, they were at peace with it. There was a reason why Zen was so outstanding. His background was much stronger than theirs.
<br><br>
"Brother, after the Chaotic Source World opens, you have to follow my lead, okay?" Yan said to Zen with a smile, before walking away and standing in a corner with the other members of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Zen nodded with a smile on his face.
<br><br>
In the divine land, there was a time when Yan's strength had also increased greatly, but she was still someone whom Zen needed to protect.
<br><br>
But now, she seemed confident that she was strong enough to protect even Zen.
<br><br>
It appeared that Yan had made great progress in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"I didn't know that you had a sister," Dorothy said.
<br><br>
There was a smile in Elvinia's eyes, like a flame burning in an iceberg. "It seems that your sister is more powerful than you," she whispered.
<br><br>
Flamine once told Elvinia that Zen was a surviving descendant of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
A super force that had already declined, of course, was incomparable to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Naturally, Elvinia had felt her background was more superior to Zen's.
<br><br>
Dorothy felt much the same way.
<br><br>
But now it seemed they had it all wrong. Zen was more than a surviving descendant of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
From the looks of it, Zen and his sister were likely to be two of the most important ones.
<br><br>
"Actually, I don't know what happened." Zen scratched his head and smiled sheepishly. In fact, the position of Yan in the Pear Hill was probably much higher than his in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
After the members of the Pear Hill arrived, the people remained waiting.
<br><br>
After a while, some other flying ships came.
<br><br>
Some of them belonged to super forces, and some carried other small races.
<br><br>
There were more and more people now in all corners of the open space.
<br><br>
It was usual practice that the top masters of the super powers would not lead the teams personally.
<br><br>
For example, the leaders of the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace had never come, and nor had the supreme masters from the Bearing race and the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
After the many large races in the Source World had arrived, a large black ship suddenly appeared in the sky.
<br><br>
Seeing it, Athemar, Elizabeth and the team leaders of the super forces were taken aback.
<br><br>
"The Black Ship?"
<br><br>
"Why are they here?"
<br><br>
"In the past thousands of years, the Black Ship hasn't trained any new warriors, right?"
<br><br>
"Have they found an extremely powerful warrior?"
<br><br>
The Black Ship was a notorious force in the Source World.
<br><br>
They didn't ally themselves or compromise with any forces.
<br><br>
They robbed all the other forces, including the powerful ones like the Separate Abyss race and the Bearing race, so they had countless enemies.
<br><br>
But even though all the forces in the Source World hated them, they remained in the Source World.
<br><br>
Only once in history had the Black Ship left. That time, they seized an Other Shore Token from Stage Thirty, offending the Ear Mice in the process. The Ear Mice had offered a high reward to all the super forces of the Source World to take the Black Ship down.
<br><br>
However, even if the top masters of the Source World did everything they could, they were able to kill only one member of the Black Ship. The other members escaped and hid in the chaos for hundreds of years. When they came back, they destroyed a very important branch of the Ear Mice. They also constantly harassed the business teams of the Ear Mice, killing them whenever they saw them.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were the businessmen of the Source World, after all, so they wouldn't spend their days fighting. Moreover, the Black Ship didn't have any fixed stronghold in the Source World. They would flee as soon as they were pressed too hard.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice eventually had no choice but to make peace with the Black Ship. They even gave the Black Ship a generous gift in order to settle the matter.
<br><br>
It had always been a mystery how many members there actually were in the Black Ship, but it was widely known that one must be a supreme master in the Source World to become one of them.
<br><br>
Occasionally, the Black Ship would also train new members.
<br><br>
But the people it chose tended to be monstrously powerful.
<br><br>
The Black Ship had never come to the Chaotic Source World in recent years, which was why their presence now was so unexpected.
<br><br>
As the ship flew over everyone's head, a woman in a black dress jumped down and landed firmly on the ground.
<br><br>
The woman's skin was as white as paper, her face as adorable as a doll's, and her big eyes alluring. However, if you were sensitive enough, you could sense a deadly aura from her.
<br><br>
She was Shera.
<br><br>
Fear gripped Elizabeth, Athemar and the leaders of the other large races.
<br><br>
The strength of Shera was much stronger than that of Athemar and his peers. She was as strong as the heads of the seven mountains and the Fiveelement Emissaries of the Bearing race. According to practice, such a strong warrior wasn't allowed to enter the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
The moment Shera appeared, Fuxi who had disappeared, came back.
<br><br>
"I can smell the odor of corpses from you far away. What are you doing here? Get out of here!" Fuxi said, glaring at her with contempt.
<br><br>
When Shera saw Fuxi, she flashed an innocent smile. She swept back the hem of her dress as she bowed to him, responding sweetly, "You are being too harsh. You know, the most beautiful fragrance in the world is the smell of death."
<br><br>
Chapter 3366 The Soul Devouring Demon It was understandable for Fuxi to act with hostility towards the Black Ship.
<br><br>
After all, it was against the rules for Shera to enter the Icy Snow Province without consent.
<br><br>
"This is the final warning. If you don't turn your ship back now, don't blame me for what happens next." Fuxi threatened her with his utmost resolve.
<br><br>
The Icy Snow Province was open to the public, but it was still under the direct control of the Pear Hill. As long as the Pear Hill remained fair with the resource distribution in the Chaotic Source World, the other super forces were content with it.
<br><br>
Instead of feeling intimidated by Fuxi's threat, Shera gave him a sweet smile and spoke calmly, "Don't fret yourself, Human Sovereign. I'm only here to send a young disciple to the Chaotic Source World. He has a ticket."
<br><br>
Then she shifted her gaze upwards to the ship and said, "You can get off now."
<br><br>
Those who were cultivated by the Black Ship were expected to grow more powerful in the future.
<br><br>
Shera invited everyone's attention through her mention of the disciple. They all awaited his arrival with impatient eyes as they kept them fixated on the ship.
<br><br>
"This woman seems to be really strong. What kind of force is the Black Ship?" Zen whispered in a low tone as he asked Dorothy.
<br><br>
"The people of the Black Ship are a group of bandits that run amuck everywhere in the Source World. It is said that there are only about a dozen of them, but each of them is a supreme master. We consider them to be one of the super forces," Dorothy explained to him.
<br><br>
"There are only a dozen of them. And yet, they are considered to be a super force? Why is that so?" Zen's pupils dilated in astonishment.
<br><br>
According to his understanding, a super force had to have a long history and boast countless talents. For instance, the Oneness Sky Palace housed all human talents in the Source World other than the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Dorothy's words had shocked Zen as they contradicted his knowledge.
<br><br>
"Why not? By now, you should know that strength decides everything. It is said that the leader of the Separate Abyss race has to show respect to the head of the Black Ship. The super forces inferior in power can't touch the Black Ship," Elvinia further explained to dissolve his confusion.
<br><br>
Initially, Dorothy wanted to make it clear to Zen, but Elvinia had beat her to it. A trace of anger flashed on Dorothy's face as she bit her lip.
<br><br>
Elvinia noticed Dorothy's expression and gave her a mischievous smirk.
<br><br>
Under Shera's command, a young man dressed in black jumped down from the ship. When he landed on the ground, his sheer force had created a ditch on the flat surface and sent ripples far and wide. Slowly, he stood up from his self-made hole and scanned his surroundings. The demeanor he displayed was arrogant and cold. Upon seeing the large number of eyes on him, he laughed and sneered, "Are all these creatures my prey in the Chaotic Source World? They seem so weak."
<br><br>
Everyone present on the scene frowned at his words.
<br><br>
The ones who came to the Icy Snow Province today were all from the super forces scattered across the Source World. Only the strongest young warriors from these forces were gathered today in one place. They were each qualified in terms of skills.
<br><br>
And every talent was proud in their own unique way.
<br><br>
However, they had to maintain a low profile as they were faced with many other strong warriors from across the Source World.
<br><br>
They knew that there would eventually be someone who would be better than them. Although they were powerful, they preferred not to show off. It was better to stay on the safe side than provoke someone who surpassed them in strength. It wasn't wise to make too many enemies, or else they'd be besieged and killed in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
However, the young man who appeared from the ship seemed to not care about that. He looked at them as though they were inferior to him. As soon as he appeared, he uttered harsh words from the start. They had never come across a more arrogant man.
<br><br>
Notable warriors like Athemar and Elizabeth didn't take the man seriously.
<br><br>
However, they didn't seem to shift their eyes away from him either.
<br><br>
But his words had provoked some hot-headed young members and disciples of many super forces.
<br><br>
"Who do you think you are?"
<br><br>
"How could you insult us like this by calling us your prey? Your arrogance will be the death of you!"
<br><br>
"You'd better take that back. Otherwise you'll regret it when you enter the Chaotic Source World!"
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race, the Divine Farmer race, and some other large races collectively mocked the man. For a moment, the place became noisy with angry disciples ganging up to retaliate against the man.
<br><br>
If it were an ordinary person, they would have yielded after hearing those angry words.
<br><br>
However, that man stood tall on his feet, refusing to stand down. The corners of his mouth turned into a sinister smile as he returned their glares.
<br><br>
A bright light flashed in his eyes as an irrefutable aura of soul gushed out from him.
<br><br>
His soul aura was undeniably stronger than those of the Indigo Souls at the same level.
<br><br>
"Such an incredible aura!"
<br><br>
Sensing the overwhelming aura, the young disciples and the leaders such as Elizabeth and Athemar stood stunned. They couldn't believe that the man had cultivated his Soul of Light to such an extent in the Lust World. The members of the Black Ship were really a force to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
The small spectacle of his power tied the tongues of the young disciples.
<br><br>
"How come the soul of this young man in black is so powerful?" A burly young man belonging to the Divine Farmer race voiced his concern from the crowd.
<br><br>
A woman was standing next to him. Her curly hairs hung loosely on her face as though they were an accessory. She spoke in a teasing tone, "Uncle Mount, are you afraid of him because he's much stronger than you?"
<br><br>
"I wouldn't count on a strong soul. When I surpass the Lust World and cultivate in the Desire World, my Soul of Light will advance to a higher level. I'll surpass him in no time. He shouldn't act so conceitedly since he's alone. This guy won't stand a chance if the others decide to lay siege against him in the Chaotic Source World," the burly young man blurted out as he shrugged his shoulders.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..." The woman beside him broke out in a fit of weird laughter, but she didn't refute his claims.
<br><br>
A white-haired young man from the Bearing race nudged at his clansman with a frown on his face. "Khalid, keep a close watch on this guy once we enter the Chaotic Source World."
<br><br>
Khalid, the man he addressed to, nodded and said, "Understood. He must possess a valuable Other Shore Token for him to cultivate his Soul of Light to such a degree."
<br><br>
The true level-headed talents from various races did not shout curses to assert dominance. Instead, they quietly observed their opponents from a distance to concoct strategies against them, such as Zen, Efrain, and Elvinia from the Oneness Sky Palace and Yan from Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Of course, the young man in black, namely the Evil God, had easily caught their attention.
<br><br>
After the Evil God gave them a taste of his intimidating aura, he gave a smug smile and said, "Back on the Other Shore, all of you were running scared out of fear of being devoured by me. So, you took refuge inside the temples. I'd watch out if I were you since there are no temples for you to hide in the Chaotic Source World!"
<br><br>
"What? Devoured by you?"
<br><br>
Everyone in the crowd shared expressions of puzzlement on their faces before they realized who this man was.
<br><br>
"Ah! No wonder his soul aura seems familiar!"
<br><br>
"It's him! There's no mistake! He is the Soul Devouring Demon! It must be him!"
<br><br>
"His voice sounds the same. I remember now!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, the expressions of all the young men of the large races switched drastically.
<br><br>
It was said another man had made trouble in Stage Four after Zen destroyed the temple of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
No one could tell what soul theurgy this man used. They only knew he was capable of sucking all the Souls of Light into his body.
<br><br>
It was apparent the cultivation of his Soul of Light improved significantly due to that. And yet he still retained his control over himself and didn't go mad at all.
<br><br>
The three orthodox forces of the human race, as well as several other large races, had suffered irreversible damage by this man.
<br><br>
The more Souls of Light he absorbed, the more his cultivation base improved. He was able to run amuck in the entire Stage Four and walked out unscathed.
<br><br>
Since they were unaware of his origins, they had given him the title of the Soul Devouring Demon.
<br><br>
The name of the Soul Devouring Demon soon caught the attention of many people. Each time they heard of it, the people would tremble in fear.
<br><br>
However, never did they expect this man in black was the Soul Devouring Demon.
<br><br>
Chapter 3367 Teach Him A Lesson The Soul Devouring Demon should keep a low profile now, on account of how wild and ruthless he had behaved on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
No one had thought he would ever be so arrogant.
<br><br>
He was so fearless; he had offended almost all the super forces and then still had the audacity to admit to his evil deeds. It was no wonder the Black Ship chose him! On the other hand, Shera seemed to have no intention to restrain the young man in black and showed zero care for his safety.
<br><br>
Zen was inquiring of the origin of the Black Ship when the young man in black appeared suddenly before him. Zen stood up with eyebrows raised and his eyes glazed over in disbelief.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Elvinia asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"Zen, do you know him?" Dorothy was confused as well.
<br><br>
Both Dorothy and Elvinia were totally confounded. Not only did Zen have something to do with the Pear Hill, but he also seemed to know this man from the Black Ship.
<br><br>
However, Zen had just asked of the origin of the Black Ship; it might be possible he knew nothing about it.
<br><br>
"Yes, I know him," Zen answered with a bitter smile. "He is a secondary creature from my inner world."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"A creature in your inner world?"
<br><br>
Elvinia and Dorothy were both flabbergasted.
<br><br>
Athemar stood at the front and turned his head in shock on hearing Zen's words. "Are you sure?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen replied sourly. "I released him when I entered the Source World.
<br><br>
I didn't expect him to get so powerful in such a short period of time."
<br><br>
When he had released the Evil God, he felt he owed him something because of the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Although he was aware the Evil God had an incomparable talent, he never thought he would be capable of growing and improving his cultivation base at such speed, and join a force like the Black Ship! Zen had taken precautionary measure though. He had built him a Rebirth Land.
<br><br>
He could sense the Evil God's general position if he was near him, but Zen hadn't known until the Evil God jumped from the Black Ship.
<br><br>
How had he avoided the restraint of the Rebirth Land? Zen knew the Rebirth Land was not omnipotent, but he never imagined the Evil God would break free so quickly.
<br><br>
Zen's revelation left Elvinia, Dorothy and Athemar speechless.
<br><br>
What amazed everyone was how powerful both Zen and the creature from his inner world were. They both possessed such formidable strength that it was hard to comprehend.
<br><br>
The young man in black looked strong and arrogant. He was definitely not a kind man.
<br><br>
Elvinia, Athemar and Dorothy still wondered if perhaps Zen had mistaken this young man for someone else.
<br><br>
Many forces were still digesting the words of the young man in black, when he turned his head and looked at the members of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
When he saw Zen, the wild and evil smile on his face grew and was even more prominent now.
<br><br>
"What a coincidence! My Creator is here too," the Evil God bellowed for all to hear.
<br><br>
Everyone looked around in confusion.
<br><br>
"The Creator? What do you mean?"
<br><br>
"It sounds like a supreme title..."
<br><br>
"Ha-ha. Is it referring to the Creator of the inner world?"
<br><br>
Everyone present had created the inner world, which was basically complete. They had at least completely created a Hundred Sanskrit Land.
<br><br>
They all had their own titles in their inner worlds, such as the God of Creation, the Paramount Creator, the Lord of Life and so on. All sorts of strange titles existed. They were the absolute masters of their own inner worlds and it was perfectly normal for the secondary creatures within to address them by those titles.
<br><br>
However, such titles would confuse everyone in the Source World and the chaos. Only the one who created the Source World was qualified to be called the 'Creator'.
<br><br>
Shera's big eyes blinked and released a ray of spiritual light. The revelation that it was a disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace who had created the Evil God irked her.
<br><br>
Zen was not the slightest bit unnerved in the face of the Evil God. He took a step forward and said, "It is indeed a coincidence. I haven't expected you to have raised your cultivation base so fast."
<br><br>
Everyone looked on, trying to understand their relationship. The Evil God stared at Zen as if he were his prey. Eventually he spoke, "I must thank you.
<br><br>
It's an honor to have been born in your inner world. Even so, I wanted to kill you every second of every hour I lived in your inner world."
<br><br>
"Wow..."
<br><br>
This sent everyone present into an uproar.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race and the Separate Abyss race, and even Fuxi were shocked.
<br><br>
Was he kidding? Was this young man really the secondary creature of Zen's inner world? Yan, who stood on the opposite side, bit her lips and said in a low voice, "Zen..."
<br><br>
It was true! This powerful young man in black really did come from Zen's inner world! He had been a secondary creature once.
<br><br>
From the Evil God's point of view, he could not allow anyone to be superior to him.
<br><br>
However, as a member of Zen's inner world, no matter how powerful he was, he still could not disobey Zen.
<br><br>
All it would take was a gaze or a thought from Zen to kill him a thousand times over! Before, the Evil God had to endure this subjugation and restrain himself to wait for the perfect chance to leave. In the end he had won Zen's trust and finally escaped from that damned world.
<br><br>
"It seems I made a mistake by letting you leave my inner world. Perhaps I should kill you with the Rebirth Land," Zen said flatly.
<br><br>
He knew the Evil God had found a way to make the Rebirth Land ineffective, and he simply uttered the words to see his reaction.
<br><br>
"You're welcome to try. Ha-ha..." The Evil God chuckled again.
<br><br>
As he laughed, a terrifying force began crashing towards him.
<br><br>
"Watch out!" Shera was shocked at this scene. "Human Sovereign, how dare you ..."
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Fuxi, not far away, stretched out his finger and pressed it downwards slightly and an invisible force shoved the Evil God to the ground.
<br><br>
Before Shera even realized what had happened, Fuxi stretched his hand out and pulled the Evil God over to him, grabbing him by the neck.
<br><br>
Such was Fuxi's power that even just one of his fingers was capable of releasing this incredible strength.
<br><br>
The Evil God had sustained serious injuries. Blood flowed like a river as he was unable to move in Fuxi's grip.
<br><br>
Shera's lovely face darkened and morphed strangely. Her dark pupils were completely vacant and the whites in her eyes, terrifyingly, had disappeared.
<br><br>
She was now in a fighting state which she would only get into when faced with a powerful opponent such as Fuxi.
<br><br>
Fuxi paid no attention to Shera. He gripped the Evil God's neck tightly and yelled in his face, "I don't care where you're from. I've said it before and I'll say it again. If anyone dares attack Zen outside the Chaotic Source World, I'll kill them!"
<br><br>
Blood trickled down from the Evil God's forehead, a violent force flowed through his body and one of his eyes began glowing with hatred.
<br><br>
He had never suffered such a loss.
<br><br>
But Fuxi was so incredibly powerful...
<br><br>
He was a mere ant to Fuxi, a little creature with no strength to fight back, just as he had been with Zen in the past.
<br><br>
Chapter 3368 Inner-world Generating Avatar Swish! Fuxi dragged the Evil God like a soiled piece of rag that left a bloody trail on the ground.
<br><br>
He pointed at Shera with a glare. "You and your ship get out of the Icy Snow Province. Now!"
<br><br>
His harsh, unfriendly tone served as a warning to Shera that if she didn't heed his words, a fierce battle was bound to ensue.
<br><br>
Shera willed herself to calm down, her eyes returning to normal as she relaxed. Fuxi, with his formidable strength, could've easily killed the Evil God with the tip of his finger but chose to only teach him a lesson instead.
<br><br>
Shera knew he was going to be fine despite his dismal state.
<br><br>
'Well, this isn't so bad, ' she thought to herself as she looked down at her beaten disciple.
<br><br>
She was a soft-hearted woman who accepted the Evil God and his arrogant personality.
<br><br>
However, his arrogance could get extreme at times and would only grow in the future. Shera hoped that Fuxi's lesson would serve to temper his insolence and strengthen his character.
<br><br>
She walked towards the Evil God and threw a golden pill towards him. "Get up. We'll wait for you outside the Icy Snow Province."
<br><br>
Then, she lifted the hem of her black dress and gave Fuxi a respectful bow.
<br><br>
"It'll be hard for us to explain to our captain if there's anything wrong with him. Please hold yourself back, Human Sovereign."
<br><br>
There was an edge to her tone, an evident warning. If the Evil God died in the Chaotic Source World then he would only have himself to blame.
<br><br>
However, dying outside the Chaotic Source World was another thing entirely. Whoever attacked him would earn the wrath of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
After saying her piece, Shera departed by vanishing on the spot. At the same time, the Black Ship began to sail away serenely like a graceful spectre.
<br><br>
Fuxi snorted, watching the Black Ship's departure with a frown. He lingered for a few moments before he too employed the Grand Teleportation technique and disappeared.
<br><br>
At the next moment, he suddenly appeared on top of a snowy mountain where he could see the entirety of the Chaotic Source World. He picked up a wine jar from somewhere and took a healthy swig.
<br><br>
Fuxi hated trouble. The only reason he stood with Pear Hill and maintained order in the Icy Snow Province was to beg for someone's forgiveness.
<br><br>
The Evil God remained curled up on where he lay. He looked like a soiled rag wrung together to get rid of excess water. This humbling sight gave everyone a sort of pleasant feeling in their hearts.
<br><br>
An arrogant man was never pitied by anyone, especially since that man also turned out to be the notorious Soul Devouring Demon.
<br><br>
Many great races hated him right to the core! Grunting heavily, the Evil God forced himself to sit up and threw the golden pill Shera had left into his mouth. He then crossed his legs and closed his eyes as a sinister smile hung on the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>
Shera fully believed that Fuxi could teach the Evil God a lesson, however, she was wrong. Even Zen, who had been the Evil God's creator, did not fully understand how his mind worked, so what more could she? The Evil God once dared to rebel against Zen when he was still in his creator's inner world.
<br><br>
He perfectly understood Zen's significance to the entire inner world along with the fact that he was an invincible being, nevertheless, the Evil God commenced with the rebellion.
<br><br>
To his misfortune, Zen was an omniscient and omnipotent being in his inner world.
<br><br>
His avatar was only a minuscule part of his soul, and even if it was killed, that would scarcely even harm him, much less kill him.
<br><br>
With this, the Evil God was driven to try harder. He was motivated by a primitive evil will that refused to make him compromise to anyone, even his creator.
<br><br>
Zen had already noticed the Evil God's intents back then and had wanted to kill him.
<br><br>
During that time though, Zen had just entered the divine land and had no time to take care of his inner world. He needed a powerful individual to help him manage his inner world and thus spared the Evil God's life.
<br><br>
Initially, no sort of crisis occurred in his inner world as the Evil God chose to behave obediently. Even when living in seclusion, he left behind a system that maintained peace in Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
What Zen didn't know was that the Evil God was merely restraining his evil will while he absorbed the power of the Godly Ways.
<br><br>
The Evil God was extremely talented and grew his strength rapidly. He even managed to blend together a large number of Godly Ways and gained freedom from Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
In short, the Evil God was someone who never gave in to anyone.
<br><br>
Fuxi's power may have been great but he was not an unbeatable enemy.
<br><br>
If the Evil God refused to submit to his own creator, what more Fuxi? As he healed himself with the aid of the pill, a weird aura emanated from his body.
<br><br>
Those who sensed his aura felt terribly annoyed by it. Even Elizabeth and Athemar, despite being powerful beings, couldn't resist the feeling of aggravation in their guts. It couldn't be explained in terms of physical strength or soul power. The Evil God was just born to be evil, as the enemy of the world.
<br><br>
"Zen, this person from your inner world... He is quite ...extraordinary,"
<br><br>
Elvinia remarked with disgust.
<br><br>
The pill had done its work, healing most of the wounds on the Evil God's body.
<br><br>
He was incredibly handsome for someone so evil, charming too if only the vileness he emanated didn't disgust Elvinia that much.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but regret ever releasing this man from his inner world.
<br><br>
He had made a strong enemy for himself that he now had no way of restraining.
<br><br>
"Zen, have you ever heard of an Inner-world Generating Avatar?" Dorothy suddenly asked.
<br><br>
"A what? Inner-world Generating Avatar?" He turned to her with a confused look.
<br><br>
"It's a special cultivation method that was quite popular a long time ago,"
<br><br>
Athemar said.
<br><br>
There were numerous creatures within a warrior's inner world. As always, elites would always sprout amongst these creatures, armed with peerless talents and endless potential.
<br><br>
If a warrior trained these elite creatures separately, allowing them to grow and even taking them out of their inner worlds, then they could turn them into their avatars.
<br><br>
"But these avatars have their own consciousness. They're their own person, right?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Athemar nodded. "That's true. In fact, the Inner-world Generating Avatar is regarded as an evil skill. The Rebirth Land is used as a method to better cultivate and control an Inner-world Generating Avatar."
<br><br>
Zen pondered his words for a bit. "I don't think many people create their avatars nowadays though. Why is that?"
<br><br>
Athemar did mention that this skill was popular a long time ago but not anymore. That meant there was something probably wrong with it that rendered it unacceptable.
<br><br>
"Because it's very difficult to control the avatars through the Rebirth Lands.
<br><br>
Many secondary creatures betrayed their creators after leaving their inner worlds. They never gave their creators a chance to annihilate their consciousness at all," Athemar explained.
<br><br>
There were two steps in the creation of Inner-world Generating Avatars.
<br><br>
The first would be to select the target creatures and build Rebirth Lands for them. The second would be to take them out of the inner world for training.
<br><br>
After a certain amount of time, when the creatures were deemed ready, the creators would then erase their consciousness and turn them into avatars.
<br><br>
Since they were born in their inner worlds, the creators would find no rejection at all when entering their avatars. They would feel like their own bodies. Avatars created this way were deemed the strongest.
<br><br>
Chapter 3369 At A Random Order Zen was shocked to hear of such a method for cultivating an avatar.
<br><br>
It was not fair to the avatar, who was not really the warrior, just a substitute.
<br><br>
The avatar had its own consciousness and its own life.
<br><br>
But it seemed that during those days, the powerful masters did not let too many worries or scruples get in the way of their activities.
<br><br>
In some of the larger forces, the warriors whose strength ranked second to fifth, were all puppet avatars of their leaders.
<br><br>
Nowadays, it was extremely rare to see creatures that cultivated the Innerworld Generating Avatar.
<br><br>
On one hand, it was easy to get rid of the Rebirth Land. On the other hand, the level of strength pursued by the living beings in the Source World was getting higher and higher.
<br><br>
When the Other Shore had first opened, creatures from the warriors' inner worlds would enter the Other Shore and fuse with the Other Shore Tokens in Stage Three or Stage Four. Then the creators would erase the memories of those creatures and transform them into their avatars.
<br><br>
For warriors as strong as Athemar, they needed to let the creatures from their inner worlds enter Stage Twenty, or a higher stage.
<br><br>
It took time to train an avatar. The longer the training, the greater the chance that the creatures would discover the truth of the Source World, and then they would try to get rid of the control of the Rebirth Land. No creature wanted to be an avatar.
<br><br>
When a creature whose memories had been erased was transformed into an avatar, it lost its soul. It could no longer enter the Other Shore, and its cultivation base could not increase.
<br><br>
Thus, while Athemar was easily able to cultivate a few avatars in the third or fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm, these avatars were too weak and useless for him.
<br><br>
"Then..." Zen said slowly, looking at the Evil God standing nearby.
<br><br>
"He was created by you. If you have the chance, you can turn him into your avatar in the future," Athemar said flatly.
<br><br>
"Of course, you must ensure you are stronger than him," Dorothy cautioned.
<br><br>
"Otherwise, he will defeat you sooner or later. He might even be able to transform you into an avatar! It sounds impossible, but it is recorded that such a thing has happened before."
<br><br>
Zen nodded, deep in thought.
<br><br>
The Evil God was too sinister. If there was a chance, Zen must try his best to punish and control him.
<br><br>
Inner-world Generating Avatar was indeed a good choice in this case.
<br><br>
However, as Dorothy had warned, it was crucial to be at the proper level of strength. If Zen tried to take on the Evil God without being strong enough, it was entirely possible that he would be the one to end up getting killed, or getting transformed into an avatar.
<br><br>
As Zen, Dorothy, and Athemar spoke, more and more ships flew down from the sky, landing beside the pillars.
<br><br>
Many small races were arriving at the Icy Snow Province. Occasionally, one or two larger ships of the super forces would show up.
<br><br>
Everyone present was calm and composed. Some of them sat cross-legged and closed their eyes to cultivate, while some of them entered the Other Shore to make deals and deal with things there.
<br><br>
Each time the Chaotic Source World opened, a silence would settle over the noisy, busy Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
After all, the best Souls of Light from Stage Thirteen were gathered at the gate of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
A day passed.
<br><br>
Zen, standing with Elvinia and the others, felt a faint vibration in the ground.
<br><br>
The tremor also caught the attention of his companions.
<br><br>
Zen, Elvinia, and the others looked instinctively to their right. The vibration was coming from the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
There were tens of thousands of people present, and every single one wore a look of eager anticipation. Everyone was praying that they would win the competition and become Chaotic Source Realm warriors.
<br><br>
The members of the large races were expectant and ready to get started, their eyes lit with fighting intent.
<br><br>
The process of reaching the Chaotic Source Realm was by no means a simple matter of fusing with the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
It was a vicious battlefield. Members of various races faced off against each other, all prepared to do whatever took to claim victory. According to the rules set by the Pear Hill and the large races, there must be no retribution— no matter who killed a warrior in the Chaotic Source World, the warrior's race would not be allowed to punish the killer.
<br><br>
As the vibration reverberated across the ground, the giant black egg began spinning slowly.
<br><br>
However, upon closer observation, they saw that it was not really the egg itself that was spinning. Rather, it was the thick black smog inside the enchanted barrier that spun slowly.
<br><br>
One by one, the runes lined in front of the gate of the Chaotic Source World began lighting up. The stone door in front of the participants gradually began to open.
<br><br>
Two women stood beside the stone door. They were members of the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
One of them shouted, "The Chaotic Source World has opened. The people from the Pear Hill will enter first!"
<br><br>
Those who entered the Chaotic Source World first had a great advantage.
<br><br>
They could lie in wait as the others arrived, and ambush them. Or they could quickly rush into the depths of the Chaotic Source World without worrying about encountering other warriors.
<br><br>
Since the Pear Hill had contributed the Chaotic Source World, the members of the Pear Hill naturally had a privilege that no one from other races could obtain.
<br><br>
Each time the Chaotic Source World opened, the members of Pear Hill were always the first to enter.
<br><br>
Yan stood up. Her gaze fell on Zen. She gestured towards him and slightly moved her lips, saying through her life vitality, "I'll be waiting for you inside."
<br><br>
Zen frowned.
<br><br>
He had no desire to be a burden on Yan. If she had a superior ability to protect herself, then he would much prefer that she go as deep into the Chaotic Source World as she could.
<br><br>
"There's no need. You'd better absorb the Chaotic Source Spirit first," Zen responded.
<br><br>
Yan looked unhappy. She resolved not to listen to Zen. She would wait for him once she was inside, regardless of what he said now.
<br><br>
The members of the Pear Hill lined up and passed through the stone door one after another.
<br><br>
As they passed, they pressed their tickets to the Chaotic Source World against the runes by the side of the stone door. They were allowed to enter only after the tickets were shattered.
<br><br>
As soon as all the Pear Hill members had entered, a woman standing by the stone door stepped forward. She lifted a handful of petals to her lips and lightly blew, and the petals scattered outwards in all directions, like a colorful rain. They seemed to multiply as they drifted on the wind, until there were tens of thousands of petals.
<br><br>
One of the petals floated directly towards Zen. It came to a stop in front of him and hovered motionless in the air.
<br><br>
Zen reached out and grasped the petal gently between two fingers. He looked closely at the petal and saw a number written on the delicate surface.
<br><br>
"13, 352..." Zen muttered.
<br><br>
"Mine says 7, 000," said Elvinia, showing her petal to Zen.
<br><br>
"I have 18, 060," said Dorothy.
<br><br>
Zen lightly placed the petal on his palm. "So this is the sequence in which we'll enter the Chaotic Source World? Is it always like this? Warriors enter in an entirely random order?"
<br><br>
Zen had assumed that the members of the same race could enter the Chaotic Source World together. As allies, they could watch out for each other and cooperate in order to get further. But this random sequence made that impossible now.
<br><br>
"In the past, members of the same race were allowed to enter together, but they just ended up fighting in groups almost as soon as they entered the Chaotic Source World. So the rule was changed," Elvinia explained.
<br><br>
Many large races and super forces had long histories with each other, which often involved some degree of enmity and animosity. When groups of warriors entered the Chaotic Source World and began fighting each other, this caused enormous losses to many races. To minimize the needless deaths, the Pear Hill had decided that participants would enter the Chaotic Source World individually, and that the order of entrance would be determined randomly.
<br><br>
Sally, Hutton, and the others held their own petals in their hands. They also looked surprised at this unexpected twist. This rule had only been in place for a few decades, and they had not yet heard of it.
<br><br>
They had all been operating under the assumption that they would enter together, and they were at a loss at this development.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. I will wait for you at the entrance," Zen said to Sally with a smile.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, Sally curled her lips at Zen, shaking her head. She morosely showed him her petal. "You'll be waiting a long time. Look, I got number 39, 000!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3370 The Wind Under normal circumstances, those who entered the Chaotic Source World needed to fend for themselves. But if they banded together, they would have a greater chance of succeeding.
<br><br>
Therefore, the six Nine Li people were willing to follow Zen.
<br><br>
Sally, however, felt a bit disheartened since her number on the petal was so big.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at the number and smiled faintly. "Don't worry. Even if we get separated, we will still be able to locate each other, thanks to the soul marks."
<br><br>
When they were still on the flying ship, Zen had marked the bodies of the Nine Li people, Elvinia, and Dorothy.
<br><br>
"Okay!" Sally nodded meekly.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the members of the super forces studied the numbers on their petals.
<br><br>
Comparing the numbers between them, some obviously felt a little depressed over the gaps. In low voices, they discussed amongst themselves how they'd meet in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Others glanced at the petals and then decidedly ignored them.
<br><br>
Milo, the burly young man and the curly haired woman from the Divine Farmer race were among those who ignored the numbers.
<br><br>
These were the sort of people who were fully confident in their strength and talent, so they frowned upon the idea of working with others.
<br><br>
Once the woman standing in front of the stone gate had distributed all the petals, she cleared her throat. "Everyone, take your tickets and enter the Chaotic Source World according to your numbers. Now, the first one."
<br><br>
As soon as she finished her words, a young man from the Bearing race stepped forward.
<br><br>
Smiling confidently, he rushed towards the stone gate, waving his ticket in the air.
<br><br>
The number on his petal was "one", so he was the first to enter the Chaotic Source World. He felt extremely lucky.
<br><br>
After showing his petal at the stone gate, he then pressed his ticket onto the runes by the side of the gate. Once the runes smashed his ticket, he flew in.
<br><br>
Immediately after, a werewolf with silvery hair from the Celestial Wolf race came forward. The number on its petal was "two". After having its ticket checked, it quickly followed suit.
<br><br>
The creatures started surging forward according to the numbers on their petals.
<br><br>
Within an hour, more than six thousand people had entered the Chaotic Source World! "The 7, 000th one," the woman at the stone gate called.
<br><br>
Elvinia turned to Zen calmly. "I'm going in."
<br><br>
Then, she floated elegantly to the gate and stepped inside.
<br><br>
Later came the 8, 000th one.
<br><br>
Then, the 9, 000th...
<br><br>
The 10, 000th...
<br><br>
The 12, 000th...
<br><br>
The 13, 000th.
<br><br>
Even then, many creatures were left at the gate, waiting for their turns.
<br><br>
"The 13, 352nd!"
<br><br>
The woman finally called Zen's number.
<br><br>
Zen smiled at Dorothy and the six Nine Li people. "I will wait for you inside."
<br><br>
Then he turned and leapt to the stone gate.
<br><br>
After he gave his petal to the woman, she said softly, "Yan didn't go deep into the Chaotic Source World. After you enter the stone gate, go right and you'll see her waiting for you there."
<br><br>
She frowned as she spoke. Zen could tell she was full of reproach.
<br><br>
The woman didn't care who Zen was. She only knew that Yan was willing to delay her own cultivation by waiting for this disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, which made her unhappy.
<br><br>
Zen knew what she was thinking. With a smile, he placed the ticket on the runes.
<br><br>
Crack! After the ticket was torn apart, Zen stepped into the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
After passing through the stone gate, Zen was shrouded in a black smog, and his surroundings became dim.
<br><br>
Even so, it was not as dark as the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The Dark Region was completely shrouded in pitch blackness. Here, in the Chaotic Source World, it was as though a thick, black smog clouded everything.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen also felt a strong resistance in the air.
<br><br>
The air was strangely thick. It was as though he had fallen into a quagmire, with a thick, heavy atmosphere enveloping him.
<br><br>
"Is this resistance coming from the black smog?" Zen wondered.
<br><br>
The smog was everywhere, so he couldn't get rid of the resistance. He tried to blow the smog away by waving his arms, but it didn't do much.
<br><br>
Gathering thirty divine megatons of force, he flapped his arms more furiously, and finally the air caved a bit. Only then was he able to walk properly.
<br><br>
'This smog is truly powerful. This place is inconceivable.' Zen raised his eyebrow in surprise.
<br><br>
Those who had just reached the Other Shore Realm wouldn't be able to move in this place. Even if they used all their strength, they wouldn't stand a chance.
<br><br>
The True Gods would probably be crushed by the smog upon entry to the Chaotic Source World! Whoosh! After Zen, a member of the Separate Abyss race had entered.
<br><br>
Locking eyes momentarily, Zen could see a hint of fear in his eyes.
<br><br>
Although this person didn't know Zen's true power, Zen seemed to have attracted the attention of the Human Sovereign. Moreover, the young man in black had come from Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
He figured it was better not to get on such a person's bad side.
<br><br>
While the Separate Abyss race was known for being arrogant, the man broke eye contact and quickly ducked into the black smog without a word.
<br><br>
Zen shrugged. He didn't have the time to ruminate over such trivial things.
<br><br>
"Yan is waiting for me on the right side."
<br><br>
Zen activated the Other Shore Power and flew through the smog.
<br><br>
Although thirty divine megatons of force was enough for him to move in the mysterious black smog, it had restricted his freedom to a certain extent.
<br><br>
He couldn't speed up, nor could he use his explosive power.
<br><br>
Even so, Zen knew it was only fair that the Chaotic Source World had this restriction aimed at everyone.
<br><br>
After flying a bit towards the right, Zen had seen only rusty-looking stones.
<br><br>
There was no sign of Yan.
<br><br>
"Where is she?" Zen frowned.
<br><br>
Yan was a woman of her word. She had promised she'd meet him there, so where was she? Zen's frown deepened. If she wasn't here, she could be in trouble.
<br><br>
He couldn't help but feel a bit worried.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, he hadn't left a soul mark on her body, so there was no way of finding her.
<br><br>
After wandering around for a while, he tried locating Elvinia. His expression changed abruptly once he found her.
<br><br>
Elvinia had entered the Chaotic Source World only shortly before him, yet she was forty thousand miles away from him! If they were in the outside world, Zen wouldn't have been so shocked. After all, they could use the Grand Teleportation.
<br><br>
However, teleporting was forbidden in the Chaotic Source World. With this smog constricting movement, how could she possibly be that far ahead? While Zen was busy pondering over this, he failed to notice a wind was steadily rising in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Whir...
<br><br>
Suddenly, he felt something pushing him fiercely.
<br><br>
The force of the wind was incredibly powerful. Before Zen had the time to react, he was violently swept up into the air by the wind.
<br><br>
Chapter 3371 Sea Dragon Race Each speck of dust was a small individual that contributed to the black smog area in the Chaotic Source World. The area had the diameter of millions of miles.
<br><br>
The smog was so dense and heavy that it was difficult for all living beings to move, let alone the wind.
<br><br>
Naturally, the wind of the Chaotic Source World required more strength than they could have imagined.
<br><br>
As Zen found himself being carried by the wind, he now understood how Elvinia travelled tens of thousands of miles into the Chaotic Source World in such a short amount of time.
<br><br>
Elvinia did not make it on her own! She rode along the strong wind to get there.
<br><br>
But if that was the case, then perhaps Yan had also been transported by the wind.
<br><br>
"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."
<br><br>
Zen moved in the air at an increasingly high speed.
<br><br>
'Before I came to the Chaotic Source World, I had never heard of such a strong wind. Has the Chaotic Source World changed?' he thought.
<br><br>
Besides, the woman from the Snake Goddess race had dropped a hint that Yan was waiting for him there.
<br><br>
It seemed the woman was unaware of any change that had occurred.
<br><br>
Five minutes had passed and the strong wind finally began to subside.
<br><br>
As the wind calmed down, Zen steadily descended and landed on a firm, brown rock.
<br><br>
Using the soul mark, he found that Elvinia was now around sixty thousand miles away from him.
<br><br>
It was a far distance, and he knew he couldn't get there so quickly.
<br><br>
However, Zen was not in a hurry. After all, everyone had just arrived at the Chaotic Source World. It would take them time to adjust and get used to the place, so there shouldn't be any threats soon.
<br><br>
He stood on the tall rock and looked around. The place was lifeless, quiet, and deserted. He didn't even spot greenery from where he was standing.
<br><br>
The black smog might have just been too heavy, making the environment too harsh for ordinary beings. Perhaps nothing could thrive here except for the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
'Before we set out, Dorothy mentioned that the Chaotic Source Spirits like hiding underground and in the rocks, ' Zen thought to himself. 'Maybe I can search for them in the rocks.' He then lifted his foot and stomped down hard against the rock he stood on.
<br><br>
"Clatter..."
<br><br>
With a crisp sound, cracks began to appear across the surface. The formation suddenly collapsed and disintegrated into countless, rocky pieces.
<br><br>
Dorothy also mentioned that there was no Chaotic Source Spirit in weak rocks. If they were to dwell in one, it would have to be extremely solid.
<br><br>
Even so, Zen still continued to search among the rock fragments, having no success in finding a Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
He jumped to another rock and stomped hard on the surface.
<br><br>
"Clatter..."
<br><br>
Like the first one, the rock cracked and eventually shattered.
<br><br>
This time, Zen didn't rummage through the broken pieces, but he made his way to another rock and jumped.
<br><br>
He repeated this on 20 more rocks, jumping and shattering them into little pieces. Of course, he ended up with no finds.
<br><br>
This did not discourage him.
<br><br>
He was only along the edge of the Chaotic Source World. Moreover, obtaining the Chaotic Source Spirit was never going to be easy.
<br><br>
With all his determination, Zen jumped on rock after rock in the hopes of finding a solid one. After he landed on the 28th rock, to his surprise, it did not break into pieces. It let out an odd, muffled sound.
<br><br>
He stomped on it some more, each step having more power than the last.
<br><br>
However, the rock wouldn't budge, and it did not crack at all.
<br><br>
His eyes lit up and the corners of his lips lifted. He thought, 'Could this rock have the Chaotic Source Spirit? What luck!' After fighting Ahmad, Zen learned a lot about the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
He knew that the Chaotic Source Reinforcement didn't make one's physical body stronger.
<br><br>
Essentially, the Chaotic Source Reinforcement was to fuse the Chaotic Source Spirit with the body. After this, the attacks received by a warrior would be borne by the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
However, the Chaotic Source Spirit's ability to bear power had a limit.
<br><br>
When the power exceeded the amount that the Chaotic Source Spirit could bear, it would fall into a state of fatigue, unable to bear any more. When this happened, the body that had undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement would collapse and weaken.
<br><br>
If a Chaotic Source Spirit was in the rock, it could help the rock bear outside forces and attacks. That was why the rock seemed indestructible. It was the Chaotic Source Spirit that was strong, not the rock itself.
<br><br>
"Let's see just how much power you can bear..."
<br><br>
Zen smirked and jumped up abruptly, circling up in the air before pounding his fists downwards.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
He exerted the power in his arms, which was around 500 divine megatons.
<br><br>
The huge rock trembled, but didn't budge. It withstood Zen's punches.
<br><br>
"Interesting!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Undisturbed by the rock's resilience, he continued to punch down as hard as he could.
<br><br>
And after eight solid punches, a minuscule crack appeared right down the middle of the rock.
<br><br>
"Argh!"
<br><br>
A grayish brown ball-like thing squeezed out from the small crack, and bounced away to the side.
<br><br>
Even though it was Zen's first encounter with the thing, he was quite certain that this was the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
It seemed that Zen's strong blows made the Chaotic Source Spirit jump out of the rock and escape.
<br><br>
"You want to escape? I don't think so!"
<br><br>
Zen leapt into the sky and chased after the Chaotic Source Spirit, like a vicious hawk on the hunt for its prey.
<br><br>
However, the black smog slowed Zen down. It was a good thing that the Chaotic Source Spirit didn't move quickly. Otherwise, Zen would have lost it by now.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit grew exhausted after bearing Zen's attacks. As it ran away, it became slower and slower.
<br><br>
This worked to Zen's advantage! But as he got closer to the little thing, three figures suddenly appeared in front of him. One of them leaned in and grabbed the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
These three figures had red skin, and their bodies were covered with a thick layer of scales. They had long, thick tails behind them, which only meant one thing—they were from the Sea Dragon race.
<br><br>
"Wow! I didn't expect to find a Chaotic Source Spirit minutes after entering the Chaotic Source World!" One of them was overjoyed to find the Chaotic Source Spirit, holding it firmly in his hand as it struggled to get out.
<br><br>
He couldn't let it out of his sight. After all, there were only 200, 000 Chaotic Source Spirits. So many people fought over them because they were so rare.
<br><br>
Thanks to Zen, this particular man was happy to have found one so easily.
<br><br>
However, Zen was not too happy about this. His face darkened slightly. "I found this Chaotic Source Spirit from the rock and dug it out myself." He looked at them fiercely and added, "Could you please return it to me?"
<br><br>
The three had no clue that Zen was there in the first place, so they were shocked to see him.
<br><br>
They knew that Zen's identity was unusual, but the Chaotic Source World was different from the outside world.
<br><br>
This was a rule set by the Snake Goddess, who they feared and respected very much. If they really killed Zen, no one would punish them, so perhaps now was a good moment to kill Zen.
<br><br>
"Hey, are you out of your mind?" one of the Sea Dragon members uttered.
<br><br>
"No one owns a Chaotic Source Spirit until they get a hold of it." The man smiled, taunting Zen.
<br><br>
The group of three were not afraid of Zen, because no matter how powerful he was, Zen stood alone against three.
<br><br>
To them, Zen was on a losing end.
<br><br>
Chapter 3372 Pursue And Attack The Sea Dragon race couldn't be considered a super force in the Source World. Naturally, their resources couldn't compare to those of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
However, they made up for it with their extraordinarily strong bodies. Their dragon scales were considered treasures and served as natural armor.
<br><br>
The three brothers, named Yasin, Musa, and Amir, were quite lucky. The gap in their respective numbers was within a hundred. Additionally, even though a strong wind had begun to rise as soon as they entered the Chaotic Source World, they were able to find each other and team up.
<br><br>
Musa and Amir had sinister expressions, both smiling viciously at Zen.
<br><br>
"So, you are unwilling to let go of the Chaotic Source Spirit." Zen narrowed his eyes at them.
<br><br>
Yasin quickly stowed away the Chaotic Source Spirit into his space ring.
<br><br>
Then, he turned to wink at his two brothers.
<br><br>
Musa and Amir immediately took the hint. In the blink of an eye, Zen was surrounded.
<br><br>
Yasin laughed. "When we were outside, you seemed to have a powerful background. However..." His eye twinkled mischievously. "I didn't expect you to be such an idiot! The moment you saw us, you had a chance to escape. But now, I am afraid you're done for. Musa, Amir, get him!"
<br><br>
Yasin shook his head. He thought Zen would be smart, but apparently, he was just a dumb fool.
<br><br>
They would spare him no mercy.
<br><br>
With a brisk flick of the wrist, Musa and Amir summoned two long sabers.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power flowed throughout their bodies. Their scales began to glow a blue light, which was the Sea Dragon race's body language for excitement.
<br><br>
"You think I'm stupid because I didn't run away?"
<br><br>
Zen asked slowly, a smile creeping on his face.
<br><br>
There were many creatures in the Chaotic Source World. Almost all the large races and super forces had come today.
<br><br>
However, out of all the creatures present, only seven or eight were worthy of catching Zen's attention. These buffoons from the Sea Dragon race were not one of them.
<br><br>
"Chop him!"
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
The long sabers cut through the black smog. With eight hundred divine megatons of force, they could almost crack both the heaven and the earth.
<br><br>
Both Musa and Amir were confident in themselves.
<br><br>
The Sea Dragon race was weak; the Other Shore Tokens they obtained weren't anything outstanding. Fifth-grade Other Shore Tokens were rarely seen in their race.
<br><br>
However, the world was just in a sense. They had a much stronger body to make up for this deficiency.
<br><br>
Both Musa and Amir slashed at Zen, their long sabers arcing in the air. Zen then calmly raised his hands.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Yasin wrinkled his nose.
<br><br>
Why was this human trying to grab the sabers with his bare hands? How futile! In the eyes of the Sea Dragon race, human bodies were very soft and fragile. The many large races would think nothing of them unless they had undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.
<br><br>
'This man is definitely asking for death, ' Yasin thought to himself gleefully.
<br><br>
The two long sabers were powerful enough to slice Zen in half.
<br><br>
Musa and Amir shared the same sentiments.
<br><br>
They had been worried that Zen would use some strange Other Shore Token when they charged. If he did, it would've been difficult to deal with him.
<br><br>
Thankfully, this stupid human was only using his bare hands to defend himself! Bang! Musa and Amir blinked in a dazed confusion. To their shock, the two long sabers were wedged firmly between Zen's clasped hands.
<br><br>
But his hands were no longer flesh. They had turned pitch black, like two iron hands gripping the two blades.
<br><br>
Yasin, who had been watching from a distance, dropped his mouth open in sheer shock.
<br><br>
The mighty warriors who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm were able to catch the two sabers with their bare hands.
<br><br>
But just as the three of them did, Zen came to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. How could he do that? Before Musa and Amir could react, Zen's Strength God Totem suddenly released over a thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
He twisted his two hands, snapping the blades in half.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! In one motion, Zen used the two broken blades against their original wielders.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The broken blades released two blue rays of sharp light in the air and cut Musa's and Amir's throats. They stared blankly forward, unmoving. Slowly, their heads slid off from their necks, and their bodies collapsed.
<br><br>
'The black smog is very annoying. My speed has been reduced by a lot, ' Zen thought, as he rubbed his wrist impatiently. Then, he turned to stare at Yasin expressionlessly. "I am not a bloodthirsty man. You would've been fine if you just handed over the Chaotic Source Spirit. Unfortunately, you are short-sighted and greedy. You deserve it."
<br><br>
With that, he suddenly leapt towards Yasin with incredible speed.
<br><br>
Although the black smog was blocking him somewhat, he still managed to close the distance in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
For Yasin, it was as though time slowed down and he was seeing everything in slow motion. Yet, he was frozen in place, seized with remorse.
<br><br>
The Sea Dragon race had arrived very early, so they had witnessed what had happened at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Strong warriors like Fuxi paid much attention to Zen, and the human young man in black was from his inner world. How could he be afraid of three members of the Sea Dragon race? Then, Yasin snapped back to his senses. It was too late for regrets, now.
<br><br>
Without further hesitation, Yasin turned around and bolted.
<br><br>
In the Chaotic Source World, hurricanes would occasionally appear out of nowhere.
<br><br>
The strength of the hurricane was far from something that Yasin could resist. As long as the hurricane rose, no one knew where he would float to.
<br><br>
By then, Zen could do nothing to him.
<br><br>
Although both Zen and Yasin couldn't move too quickly in the black smog, Zen was obviously faster.
<br><br>
Within a few seconds, Zen was only a few feet away from Yasin. As Zen closed the gap, he threw a punch at Yasin's back.
<br><br>
"Dragon Scales for Body Protection!"
<br><br>
Yasin sensed Zen's strike from behind, and immediately activated the natural armor of the Sea Dragon race. Instantly, the edges of his dragon scales were covered by honeycomb-shaped patterns, hardening his skin tenfold.
<br><br>
Dong! Zen's fist struck Yasin's back with a dull sound.
<br><br>
Yasin buckled a bit under the force of Zen's blow, but he recovered quickly and continued to run as fast as he could.
<br><br>
'The bodies of the Sea Dragon race are truly solid, ' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
'If any ordinary human took a punch, they'd be dead by now.' Little did he know that Yasin was under a great deal of pain.
<br><br>
The strength of Zen's punch was enough to cause some serious internal bleeding. He spat out blood as he ran, cursing under his breath. There was no way he could take another punch like that.
<br><br>
Sensing that Zen was closing in on him once more, Yasin made a split second decision. Gritting his teeth in frustration, he pulled off his space ring and threw it as far as he could in the opposite direction.
<br><br>
Even though the black smog posed some resistance, the space ring flew over a hundred feet away.
<br><br>
Zen hesitated. The Chaotic Source Spirit was stored in the space ring. In that moment, Zen chose to give up the chase and turned towards the direction the space ring landed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3373 Getting Excited Zen had no interest in hunting down and killing the member of the Sea Dragon race, as the Chaotic Source Spirit was his real goal.
<br><br>
If the members of the Sea Dragon race yielded and gave him what he wanted, Zen wouldn't have to kill them.
<br><br>
Just as he rushed toward the space ring, the black smog started stirring from above him again.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
The strong hurricane came.
<br><br>
Zen's face fell when he felt the great gust of wind.
<br><br>
If the hurricane reached him, he knew it would send him far away. By then, he wouldn't be able to find the ring easily again.
<br><br>
And so with even more determination, he pounced on the ring.
<br><br>
It was much lighter than Zen. As the hurricane blew, the ring rose into the air.
<br><br>
The moment Zen landed, he leaped into the air, tailing the space ring closely.
<br><br>
Whoosh! With his right hand, he grabbed the ring at lightning speed.
<br><br>
"Well, that was close..."
<br><br>
He sighed in relief.
<br><br>
As he knew he had to hunt for more than one Chaotic Source Spirit, he needed to know about them as soon as possible.
<br><br>
With the hurricane whirling, he was sent tens of thousands of miles away.
<br><br>
Before the gate of the Chaotic Source World, many creatures of the large races continued entering one after another.
<br><br>
The moment Dorothy entered the Chaotic Source World, she couldn't avoid the hurricane. It lifted her up a few hundred feet high, carrying her further into the black smog.
<br><br>
Without the Other Shore Power, she couldn't move.
<br><br>
In a panic, she checked on Zen's soul mark, only to find that he was also moving forward, carried along by the hurricane.
<br><br>
She figured he was also just as stuck as she was.
<br><br>
But why in the world was there even such a strong hurricane in the Chaotic Source World? No such thing was recorded in the classics.
<br><br>
But it wasn't the time to be thinking about that. First, she had to find Zen.
<br><br>
Having entered the Chaotic Source World ahead of Zen, Elvinia was extremely morose at this point.
<br><br>
While she had originally planned to wait for him, the hurricane blew her away out of nowhere.
<br><br>
Even when it stopped, she didn't get lucky. Instead, she encountered several members of the Sun Crow race, two of which were demon women born in the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
Because of Elizabeth's influence and support, the members of the Sun Crow race regarded Elvinia as a traitor.
<br><br>
After getting herself out of the Dark Region, Elvinia had shown up with a physical body before the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
While the races were confused by her appearance, they also intended to kill her. The members of the Sun Crow race encountered Elvinia the moment they entered, so they, of course, had no intention of letting her get away.
<br><br>
So long as they got rid of her, they knew they would get preferential treatment.
<br><br>
The two demon women along with the other three members of the Sun Crow race were also the top warriors of the Sun Crow race's younger generation.
<br><br>
Elvinia was strong enough to protect herself if at most two of them attacked her. But now, she had no choice but to run for her life—five of them had joined hands to corner her.
<br><br>
At this point, the only good thing Elvinia had on her hands was how she had already mastered the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. Her divine flames were purer than most.
<br><br>
But now, she had a few deep scratches on her back and arms as she was being chased.
<br><br>
When she was nearly besieged, a hurricane blew once again, bailing her out of the situation. Everyone was blown away in different directions.
<br><br>
She tried to check Zen's soul mark, only to find that he was even farther away from her. How could she get back on track? "Number 45, 044..." the woman standing before the stone door called out.
<br><br>
An eight-foot-tall man from the Bearing race stepped forward.
<br><br>
He was none other than Garrett Ji.
<br><br>
In the Bearing race, the Ji Clan enjoyed the highest status, and Garrett Ji was its direct descendant.
<br><br>
As he moved across the open area, he heard a strange laugh from his side.
<br><br>
He turned to the source of the laughter to find that it was from the arrogant Soul Devouring Demon.
<br><br>
The sight made him cast a scornful glare at the human.
<br><br>
He thought that the arrogant ones were always killed off easily. If the Soul Devouring Demon chose to keep silent and keep his recklessness in check, he might be able to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. But as soon as he appeared, he dared to expose his identity, leaving himself vulnerable to the other large races. It wasn't likely he would make it out of the Chaotic Source World alive.
<br><br>
"What are you laughing at?" Garrett Ji demanded coldly.
<br><br>
The Evil God raised a petal and flipped it over. His number read 45, 045, just behind Garrett's.
<br><br>
The latter's expression seemed to change when he saw the number.
<br><br>
While he didn't exactly know what the Evil God meant, he knew that the guy was crazy enough to do anything.
<br><br>
Garrett's chest clenched slightly in uneasiness, but he ignored the Evil God and continued his stride to the stone door.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Bearing race were left upset as well. During their trip to the Chaotic Source World, they had to give priority to protecting the disciples surnamed Ji. Garrett Ji, most especially, held a very high position among the descendants. Being targeted by the Soul Devouring Demon was too much of a bad omen.
<br><br>
After Garrett Ji entered the Chaotic Source World, the woman from the Snake Goddess race announced the next number.
<br><br>
Without a word, the Evil God stood up and took unrushed steps toward the stone door.
<br><br>
Garrett Ji wasn't actually particularly afraid of the Evil God. While the Evil God's Soul of Light was indeed very powerful, Garrett Ji had with him several body protection weapons—he was well-equipped entering the Chaotic Source World. He even carried a secret soul weapon that could protect his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
And Garrett's Other Shore Token was not weak by any means.
<br><br>
His goal was to reach the Chaotic Source Realm as soon as possible, and he wasn't willing to get targeted by a madman in the process.
<br><br>
So once he stepped through the stone door, he flew away without any hesitation.
<br><br>
But the black smog was pervasive in the Chaotic Source World—Garrett Ji was slowed down. After reaching a certain distance, he turned his head to find the Evil God's figure at the gate.
<br><br>
'Is he planning to follow me?' The thought made Garrett's brows shoot up in shock.
<br><br>
He had no enmity with the Evil God, so he figured the latter wouldn't bother getting involved with him.
<br><br>
But as it turned out, he was wrong.
<br><br>
There were people in the world who simply enjoyed killing others.
<br><br>
After staying in the Black Mountain Guild for a long time, the Evil God was rather tired of killing.
<br><br>
When he stayed in Zen's inner world, the Evil God rarely killed because the warriors of the entire inner world were not that powerful—they didn't even deserve to receive his attacks. The Evil God felt no desire to spar with them.
<br><br>
And of course, there was the fact that he would have faced Zen's punishment if he did kill others.
<br><br>
Back on the Black Ship, Shera told the Evil God that he couldn't take anyone so lightly. The creatures who entered the Chaotic Source World were easily the most outstanding beings of the young generation in the entire Source World.
<br><br>
Instead of feeling the pressure of having to face them, the Evil God felt excitement build up inside him at the thought.
<br><br>
To him, it was a feast of killing people to his heart's content.
<br><br>
So as soon as he appeared, he didn't hesitate to grab people's attention by revealing his identity as the Soul Devouring Demon.
<br><br>
The eyes of hatred on him were intoxicating to him, like inhaling fine wine.
<br><br>
After discovering Zen, he was nothing but more excited. He didn't dream of stopping until he was hit by Fuxi.
<br><br>
Chapter 3374 Protection As soon as the Evil God entered the stone gate, he felt the weight of the black smog. He paused slightly.
<br><br>
He shivered a bit, but soon adapted to it.
<br><br>
The black smog obscured the light, but after adjusting to the darkness, his eyes soon caught sight of Garrett sprinting away.
<br><br>
"Humph," the Evil God snorted.
<br><br>
With a small hop, he launched himself straight at Garrett, hurtling through the air like a bird of prey.
<br><br>
Garrett had seen him all this while, looking back as he moved forward.
<br><br>
His face fell as soon as he spotted the Evil God in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Garrett was sure he could take on the Evil God, but he had no intention of confronting him now.
<br><br>
But who would be happy with a lunatic hunting them for no reason? "Toad Pace!"
<br><br>
At this, Garrett accelerated.
<br><br>
His steps now followed a special rule. He could still move forward at high speed even with the black smog in his way.
<br><br>
"So, you choose to flee?"
<br><br>
A cold light flashed in the Evil God's eyes. He picked up his speed behind Garrett. It seemed like he would soon overtake him.
<br><br>
The distance between them began to close quickly.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Garrett panicked.
<br><br>
"How could he be so fast?!"
<br><br>
The black smog should have had the same effect on the Evil God as on him.
<br><br>
The former hadn't gone into the higher stage of the Other Shore Realm, so he shouldn't be much stronger than him.
<br><br>
Realizing he could not get rid of the Evil God, Garrett stopped in his tracks with a new resolve.
<br><br>
He waved his hands, pulled out two machetes from his belt, and faced the oncoming threat head-on. "I have no enmity with you! Why are you chasing me?"
<br><br>
The Evil God halted, excitement dancing in his eyes. He let out a sinister laugh. "You know the answer!"
<br><br>
At his words, Garrett's face darkened. With a flash, a snake shadow appeared and crawled along the surface of each machete.
<br><br>
It was an Other Shore Treasure, and there was a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen merged with it.
<br><br>
"You want to fight me?" Garrett spat out, a deadly warning in his voice.
<br><br>
"Fight? Haha!" The Evil God sneered and raised his right hand. "I want to kill you."
<br><br>
As soon as these words were spoken, he flung out five pieces of diamondshaped fragments from his palm.
<br><br>
These diamond-shaped fragments were all made of the Ways-blending Energy. They broke the black smog, obliterating the dust while emitting a little white light.
<br><br>
"What kind of power is this?"
<br><br>
Garrett's pupils shrank slightly. His face took on a serious expression as he swung his machetes.
<br><br>
"Heaven and Earth Radiance Hacking!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The two rays of blade radiance formed a cross. The snake shadows coiled around the radiance, and then struck at the diamond-shaped fragments.
<br><br>
Garrett might not be the strongest among the young generation of the Bearing race, but he was strong enough to be in the top five among hundreds of his peers. That he deployed his treasured weapons indicated that he thought highly of his opponent now.
<br><br>
The Heaven and Earth Radiance Hacking would have been a normal attack, but with his Other Shore Token attached to it, it could nearly devour all the energy in the world.
<br><br>
It could even swallow the Other Shore Power! However, when the blade radiance came into contact with the diamondshaped fragments, an astonishingly cataclysmic power burst out. The dazzling white light went through the black smog, obscuring Garrett's view.
<br><br>
Garrett stayed calm. He closed his eyes and spread his spiritual sense in all directions.
<br><br>
But just as he did, a powerful soul pressure rushed toward him! The spiritual sense acted as appendages for a soul. These appendages could spread far away and fast, but they were thin and extremely fragile.
<br><br>
The soul pressure destroyed Garrett's spiritual sense violently. Unable to locate the Evil God, Garrett began to feel afraid.
<br><br>
The Evil God had seized the chance to approach behind him. He stretched out his hand and flung a diamond-shaped fragment at the back of Garrett's head.
<br><br>
Two people around a thousand feet away were watching these events unfold.
<br><br>
One of them, a tall and strong young man, had a girl with curly hair seated on his shoulder.
<br><br>
This girl was Mya, treasured by many elders of the Divine Farmer race. The race had high hopes for her entry into the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
The origin of the strapping young man was rather more mysterious. Only a few members of the Divine Farmer race knew his true identity. He was named Mount.
<br><br>
Mya usually called him Uncle Mount.
<br><br>
"Uncle Mount, are you really not going to help him?" asked Mya, pouting her rosy lips.
<br><br>
Her face was covered by her curly hair, but under all that was a pair of pretty eyes.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race were as close as brothers.
<br><br>
Before they set out, their leader had instructed that no matter what happened, they should help each other with the Sun Crow race and the Bearing race in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Garrett was a very important disciple of the Bearing race, so they were supposed to help him.
<br><br>
"Garrett won't die anyway. Why don't we just watch for now?" Mount replied gently.
<br><br>
Although the Soul Devouring Demon was widely known in many races, they didn't appear afraid of him at all.
<br><br>
Strong people tended to be lonesome and arrogant. Being among the top ranks of the extremely powerful, they had never thought that they were inferior to the Evil God.
<br><br>
"It seems that the energy in that man's hand is the Ways-blending Energy, and that he has integrated many..." Mya slightly curled her hair with a finger. "Having fused the Godly Ways to such a degree, this guy is by no means weak..."
<br><br>
"It's just a fusion of different Godly Ways. What's the big deal?" Mount raised his hand, radiating a colorful glow from his fingertips, which contained at least two thousand different Godly Ways that had been blended.
<br><br>
As Mya looked at the beautiful Ways-blending Energy, a smile played at the corners of her mouth. She sighed, "Uncle Mount, you really are omnipotent..."
<br><br>
"Blending Godly Ways is not as difficult as you think. As long as you have enough time, you can make it, too. But it's difficult to activate its power. I just don't know where this young man learned the method to get more than a hundred layers of Ways-blending Energy, making it as powerful as an Other Shore Token," Mount mused somberly.
<br><br>
As they watched, the Evil God moved to embed a diamond-shaped fragment into the back of Garrett's head.
<br><br>
The Evil God was certain that Garrett would die, but just then, a brown ball appeared at the top of his head. As the ball cracked, a layer of transparent enamel covered Garrett's body.
<br><br>
The enamel firmly armored Garrett. It appeared as delicate as porcelain.
<br><br>
But the Evil God soon learned it was not. He could not break through it at all! Chapter 3375 An Amber Crystal Some races in the Black Mountain Guild were superior in terms of strength.
<br><br>
However, all creatures who joined the Black Mountain Guild were violent and vicious.
<br><br>
They were raised to be independent creatures. Without the support or protection of other powerful warriors, they had to rely on their own strength for survival.
<br><br>
The winners would advance further, while the losers had to pay the penalty of death.
<br><br>
The Evil God knew about the Latent Theurgy.
<br><br>
But the members of the Black Mountain Guild didn't have any of them.
<br><br>
The Evil God attempted to remove the enamel that enwrapped Garrett with his Ways-blending Energy. After several failed tries, he realized it was to no avail.
<br><br>
Tenacious as he was, he refused to give up. Just as he was about to pull out his Other Shore Token, he heard mocking laughter coming from near him.
<br><br>
He immediately turned his head to find two human beings from the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
These two had been standing at a safe distance of a thousand feet away from the Evil God. He was so engrossed that he didn't notice their presence.
<br><br>
After they made themselves known, he was instantly alerted.
<br><br>
"What's so funny?" the Evil God sneered as he narrowed his eyes to glare at Mya.
<br><br>
It was obvious Mya was trying to get on his nerves. He was always ready to fight off anyone who dared to annoy him.
<br><br>
While Mount carried Mya's body, he gathered strength secretly. Although both of them displayed relaxed expressions, they knew they shouldn't underestimate the man in black. All the strong warriors had one attribute in common. They were confident in their skills, but they weren't conceited.
<br><br>
Mya smirked and raised her arm upwards. She pointed at the black smog and said, "You can't touch him. It's a Latent Theurgy made from an Other Shore Token from Stage Thirty-One. You cannot break it!"
<br><br>
"Oh? Really?" The Evil God arched one brow upwards and scoffed. The corners of his mouth turned into a sly smile. He didn't seem to take her words seriously.
<br><br>
Since he was unsuccessful in breaking the Latent Theurgy, he decided to let it go for the moment. Mya and Mount remained where they stood and didn't run away. He looked at them with vicious intents as though they were his next prey.
<br><br>
With quick steps, he began to make his way towards them.
<br><br>
Mya shook her head disapprovingly and said, "You don't have time to fight with us now."
<br><br>
"And why is that?" The Evil God shook off her words as he continued to gather his strength while he walked.
<br><br>
"Because the hurricane is coming once again. You'll be swept up before you even get here," Mya said as she smirked while pointing in the distance.
<br><br>
The Evil God stopped in his tracks with a trace of doubt shadowing his face. At this moment, the black smog of the Chaotic Source World began to surge again. It didn't take long before a huge force made its way towards the Evil God and swept him off his feet and into the sky.
<br><br>
Mya, Mount, and Garrett who was still sealed up by the enamel had all been swept up in the air along with him.
<br><br>
The hurricane swirled around the Chaotic Source World. Any living being within close range of it would be tossed thousands of miles away whenever it came.
<br><br>
Trying to get back at her, the Evil God attempted to resist the pressure of the hurricane and made his way towards Mya. However, he was blocked off by several thousand divine megatons of force. The pressure coming from it was so severe that even he was unable to persist against it.
<br><br>
After floating in mid-air for a fair amount of time, he landed at a place seventy thousand miles away from the entrance.
<br><br>
As he got up, he dusted himself off and began to look around. Right in front of his eyes was a tall mountain over a thousand feet high. Hiding in the cracks of this mountain were members and disciples of some large races.
<br><br>
Since the Chaotic Source Spirits would usually hide in the rocks, there was a high probability of them residing in the mountain.
<br><br>
The people who were in the mountain tried to break the rocks to look for them. Although the process was tedious and required a lot of strength, the hopes of obtaining something, in the end, kept them from giving up.
<br><br>
When the hurricane began to rage, they would seek refuge in the cracks of the mountain.
<br><br>
As soon as the hurricane subsided, they would come out of the cracks and continue with the task.
<br><br>
The several races that stayed there held no grudges against each other. Their shared lack of talents and power compared to others bound them together as a group. No one would meddle in the other person's work, and they got along well.
<br><br>
But their fortunate situation only lasted for a short while. The raging hurricane had brought the Evil God right to their doorstep. When their eyes met the Evil God's, they dropped what they were doing and froze in shock.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, when the hurricane stopped, Zen landed in a small col.
<br><br>
Perhaps because of the constant visits of the hurricane, the mountains of the Chaotic Source World remained barren.
<br><br>
Zen quickly made his way inside the small col.
<br><br>
He sat down before he forcefully removed the soul seal from the space ring.
<br><br>
He came across a variety of stored items as he rummaged through it to look for the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
After ignoring all the useless stuff collected by Yasin, he soon found the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
When Zen reached for it, the hair on the surface of its body stood up in response. Zen's touch had activated its defense mechanism. To protect itself from him, it came at Zen ferociously like a rabid dog.
<br><br>
But Zen flipped his hand and pinned it to the ground effortlessly.
<br><br>
"Feisty little thing, aren't you?" he muttered to himself as he felt it struggle.
<br><br>
"Aha..."
<br><br>
Alas, the Chaotic Source Spirit gave up and let out a squeal of grievance while it splayed out on the ground. It looked at Zen with its olive-like eyes filled with pain to appeal to his sensitive side.
<br><br>
Taking a little effect on its pitiful eyes, Zen loosened his grip over it to ease the pain. Suddenly, he realized something.
<br><br>
He didn't know the method of absorbing the Chaotic Source Spirit! The Chaotic Source Spirit existed with a distinctive life form. It was originally a creature on the Other Shore. The question remained whether the descendants of two creatures from the Other Shore were still recognized as the creatures of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Maybe he had to devour the Chaotic Source Spirit to merge with it? Sensing Zen's dilemma, No. 9527 stepped in to guide him. Its voice echoed in Zen's mind as it spoke, "Although most refer to this creature as the Chaotic Source Spirit, it's actually just the carrier of the Chaotic Source Spirit. There's no need for you to take its life. You can keep it in your inner world. I'll teach you."
<br><br>
The most violent method was to kill this tiny innocent creature. They had to dissect its corpse to get the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
Many people would go with this brutal method to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirit. However, there was also a gentler procedure to not harm it and acquire what they wanted.
<br><br>
Without wasting a moment, Zen grabbed the creature and proceeded to put it in his inner world through the cinnabar field. Then he followed No.
<br><br>
9527's instructions and carefully extracted the Chaotic Source Spirit from it.
<br><br>
Not long after, an amber crystal forced its way out of the tiny body.
<br><br>
"Is this the Chaotic Source Spirit?" Zen asked as he studied the crystal.
<br><br>
No. 9527 nodded as it replied, "Yes, it is."
<br><br>
"If I keep this little creature in my inner world, will it produce another crystal after some time?" Zen inquired again.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid not. Just forget about it."
<br><br>
Once the Chaotic Source Spirit was extracted from the body of the creature, it went through some physical changes. Its brown hair turned grayish-white, but its black olive eyes remained bright. It seemed this method had not caused it any harm.
<br><br>
There were a total of two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits in the Chaotic Source World. Once the Chaotic Source Spirit was extracted from the carrier, the carrier would become an ordinary creature. Like every living being, it would gradually age and then die. So it would never produce any new Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Zen kept the little creature in his inner world. After all, it was the right thing to do after he had extracted the Chaotic Source Spirit from it. He had to give it a safe place to live out the rest of its life.
<br><br>
He took the crystal from his inner world and studied it from all sides before storing it safely into his space ring.
<br><br>
Now it was not the right time to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. He had to double his search and look for more Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
As he stood in the small col, he remembered the habitual nature of these little creatures. Studying the landscape of the area, he realized it was probable that some Chaotic Source Spirits hid underneath the rocks.
<br><br>
He had to hurry before the hurricane rose again. Quickly, Zen crushed over a thousand divine crystals and replenished the energy of the Strength God Totem. Keeping his eyes glued to the rocks at his feet, he activated the Other Shore Power once more. Then, he balled his hands into fists and gathered massive power before he smashed the rocks below his feet.
<br><br>
Chapter 3376 The Stone Pillar In The Cave Earlier, Zen had smashed around thirty rocks but only found one Chaotic Source Spirit among them.
<br><br>
There were probably thousands of rocks piled up there. Zen smashed them one by one, almost razing the area to the ground.
<br><br>
And yet, he couldn't find another Chaotic Source Spirit...
<br><br>
Surveying the multitudes of broken stones on the ground, Zen sighed helplessly.
<br><br>
Two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits were scattered within an area with the diameter of millions of miles, most of which lived in groups. It was not easy to find one that appeared alone.
<br><br>
However, Zen refused to give up. The Chaotic Source World would stay open for one month; he still had time.
<br><br>
If it was difficult for him to find Chaotic Source Spirits, how much more for the others? Zen took a break from smashing stones to check on the soul marks.
<br><br>
The hurricanes kept on pushing everyone further away from each other.
<br><br>
The distance between him and Elvinia wasn't any closer than before. In fact, it seemed she had drifted even farther. The same went for Dorothy.
<br><br>
On the other hand, to Zen's relief, he noted that the six people of the Nine Li race were much closer to him. Hutton and the three other Nine Li people were gathered as a group, while Sally was dozens of miles to his left.
<br><br>
"Eh?"
<br><br>
Zen grunted, as he pondered over this.
<br><br>
Sally had left a soul mark on him, as well. If she sensed his existence, she should have definitely headed in his direction.
<br><br>
But now, Sally stayed put, wherever she was.
<br><br>
The hurricane would blow every five minutes, and it was coming again soon. God knew where Zen would be blown to next.
<br><br>
So, he wasted no time and headed to the left, to where Sally was. Soon, he encountered a mountain range -- or what was left of it.
<br><br>
Apparently, someone had also destroyed the mountains. They were almost completely leveled, with shards of shattered rocks everywhere.
<br><br>
"There are still three miles left..."
<br><br>
Once again, Zen checked on Sally's location. After confirming she hadn't moved, he leapt into the air and flew through the flattened mountain range.
<br><br>
When he arrived at the area where Sally was supposed to be, he found no one there.
<br><br>
Puzzled, Zen surveyed the area with vigilance. The soul mark couldn't lie, but he couldn't see Sally anywhere.
<br><br>
"She must be down there..."
<br><br>
There was only one possibility: Sally was within the mountains. There must have been an entrance somewhere.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was deep in thought, the black smog above his head surged once more.
<br><br>
After having gone through this several times, Zen knew what to expect.
<br><br>
As soon as the black smog started to surge, this indicated the hurricane would blow within a few seconds.
<br><br>
He cursed under his breath.
<br><br>
It would be difficult for Zen to escape the hurricane now, but it would be really inconvenient once he was blown away.
<br><br>
Just then, a voice suddenly chirped not far from him. "Zen! In here! Come on in!"
<br><br>
Zen turned his gaze to the direction where the sound came from. Suddenly, he saw Sally's fair arm waving frantically at him from a crack at the side of a mountain.
<br><br>
The upper and lower parts of the crack were folded, so it would have been difficult to detect it without using spiritual sense.
<br><br>
Zen knitted his brows. Planting his feet firmly on one side of the mountain, he launched himself towards the crack with incredible force, shooting towards Sally's waving arm.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As he was closing in on the small cave, the hurricane started to surge.
<br><br>
"Zen, hurry u--"
<br><br>
But before she could even finish her sentence, the hurricane blew with such force that she was pushed violently into the depths of the stone crack.
<br><br>
Zen also felt the incredible force of the hurricane tugging at his body.
<br><br>
Gritting his teeth, he knew he had to do something quick.
<br><br>
Zen lowered himself, rolling over and then kicked a giant rock that was beside him.
<br><br>
The kick was an explosive force of over a thousand divine megatons, completely shattering the rock in an instant.
<br><br>
Zen used this momentum to launch himself forward a bit. It was just enough for his fingers to clasp desperately onto the edge of the crack.
<br><br>
Channeling all his strength into his arm, he pulled himself inside the crack.
<br><br>
Like Sally, the hurricane whipped him from behind so violently, he was pushed into the depths of the crack.
<br><br>
Zen rolled blindly in the dark until he crashed into a stone wall. When he got his bearings, he realized he was in a small cave.
<br><br>
Zen's body was naturally able to withstand the collision. He stood up, unscathed. Instead, the wall of the cave had some hairline cracks from the impact.
<br><br>
Just now, Sally had also been thrown down by the hurricane. Like Zen, she also collided with the wall of the cave, but she wasn't as strong as Zen. She was knocked out, lying motionless on the ground, unconscious.
<br><br>
Zen slid down from the cave wall, and held up Sally. He stretched out two fingers and pressed them against her forehead to check her condition. After a while, he was a little relieved knowing that her injuries weren't serious.
<br><br>
"Fortunately... She's just passed out." As he spoke, he gently released a stream of warm soul force onto her body.
<br><br>
After a while, her eyelashes fluttered as she woke up. To Zen's surprise, the first thing she said was, "Zen, are you alright?"
<br><br>
"You should worry about yourself!" Zen smiled, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"I'm fine!" She sat up and stretched her arms and legs.
<br><br>
After all, Sally was a descendant of Chiyou's brother. Although the bodies of people of the Nine Li race were considered weak compared to that of nonhuman creatures, they were still the strongest among the many human forces.
<br><br>
"Why are you in a cave?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Sally blinked. "I was searching for the Chaotic Source Spirits with them down there. Just now, I found that your soul mark was approaching, so I came up. I didn't expect that the hurricane would come at this time..."
<br><br>
If Sally hadn't spotted Zen and warned him in time, he would have been blown ten thousand miles away by the hurricane.
<br><br>
"Is there a Chaotic Source Spirit in the cave?" Zen's eyes flashed. "And who are the people you're talking about?"
<br><br>
"There are not only Chaotic Source Spirits, but also many vicious beasts! Zen, just follow me and you'll find out," Sally answered cryptically.
<br><br>
She led the way in the front, and they went down the rugged path in the cave. After a while, they took a sharp turn and Zen found that there was a different world underground. Underneath the flattened mountains, there was actually a huge cave, with shimmering stone walls.
<br><br>
In the middle of the cave, there was a thick stone pillar with countless small holes on its surface. Fiery red eyes flickered from inside the holes.
<br><br>
"Zen!" A voice cried as soon as they entered the cave.
<br><br>
"Chaim!" Zen grinned widely.
<br><br>
Chaim was on par with Milo in terms of both status and strength in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Moreover, he was very smart and flexible, which had left a deep impression on Zen on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Besides Chaim, there were other warriors present: two werewolves of the Celestial Wolf race, three members of the Moon Spirit race, and another nonhuman creature.
<br><br>
If they were members of the super forces, they would never have been able to tolerate each other, and would have probably already taken action against each other. However, since they were all from smaller races, they were able to get along quite harmoniously.
<br><br>
With Zen there, Chaim was filled with joy. "Zen, you came at the right time.
<br><br>
This stone pillar is so dangerous. We don't know how to deal with it. I was wondering if you can break the pillar."
<br><br>
Zen, of course, knew that since they stayed in this cave, these warriors had to be up to something.
<br><br>
He glanced at the stone pillar. "Are there Chaotic Source Spirits in the pillar?"
<br><br>
"Yes, and actually, there are a lot of them," answered Chaim with certainty.
<br><br>
"But besides the Chaotic Source Spirits, there are also other ferocious beasts inside, which are very troublesome to deal with."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he summoned a fishing rod, casting the line. Then the hook with the bait flew towards the pillar.
<br><br>
Chapter 3377 Fierce Ants The hook with bait shot past the warriors and went directly towards the stone pillar. Afterwards, Chaim slightly shook his hand to simulate movement of the bait.
<br><br>
Almost instantly, a series of red lights flashed within the small holes of the stone pillar. Around six or seven creatures rushed out of the holes and ripped the bait off the hook. They immediately withdrew back into the pillar. Their movements were as quick as lightning.
<br><br>
In spite of their speed, Zen had no difficulty in seeing them clearly. He realized what the creatures were almost at once.
<br><br>
"Those creatures are ants?" Zen couldn't believe his eyes. But he could not be mistaken.
<br><br>
Those ants had half of an arm's length. Their tentacles were shining with a bright scarlet light. They also had big jaws that glinted dangerously. Upon observation, it was obvious that they were poisonous.
<br><br>
Chaim nodded as he confirmed what Zen had surmised. With a frown, he said, "They must be the kind of wild and ferocious ants unique to the Chaotic Source World. They are highly poisonous. There is no doubt that we must not approach them."
<br><br>
Having said this, he pointed to an area not that far away from them.
<br><br>
Zen looked towards the direction he pointed. There, a member of the Celestial Wolf race lay lifeless on the ground. He had a black mass all over his body. Clearly, he died due to the poison that spread in his system.
<br><br>
Zen turned his head back at the stone pillar. He pondered for a while and then said, "It seems like these ants do not intend to leave their nests. Is it possible to attack them with the Other Shore Tokens?"
<br><br>
"My Other Shore Token is of the descending type, Zen. Watch this," Sally said as she wanted to demonstrate something to Zen.
<br><br>
A little round ball materialized from Sally's hand. It seemed really heavy and compact. Its surface was covered with a rainbow-like luster.
<br><br>
This Other Shore Token was known as the Iridescent Stone unique to Stage Thirteen that contained astonishing Other Shore Power. Upon throwing it, the user would be able to control its movement to hit the target accurately.
<br><br>
Sally launched the Iridescent Stone towards the stone pillar. It soared towards the target with such accuracy.
<br><br>
Pew! Boom! The incredible power of the Iridescent Stone caused ripples in the space as it flew in the air. It heavily crashed upon the stone pillar.
<br><br>
The blow must have unleashed over a thousand divine megatons of force. It was truly remarkable.
<br><br>
Even strong warriors like Chaim would not be able to take that kind of hit head on. It was a force that could probably cause a mountain to collapse upon impact.
<br><br>
Sally might seem like a delicate beauty. However, her strength should not be underestimated.
<br><br>
Dong! No matter how strong the attack was, it only crashed upon its target with a dull thud. The pillar only trembled a little. Apart from that, it appeared completely unharmed.
<br><br>
The pillar itself could not have been that sturdy. The only possible explanation for this would be many Chaotic Source Spirits were probably hiding inside it.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Iridescent Stone Sally had thrown just now disappeared from where it crashed into the pillar. Instantaneously, it reappeared in her hand.
<br><br>
"The Other Shore Tokens that Sally and the member of the Celestial Wolf race have belong to the descending type. They are not particularly afraid of the deadly poison those vicious ants possess. Even after several rounds of attacks, however, the pillar remained intact. One thing can be deduced from that. There might be many Chaotic Source Spirits hiding inside the pillar,"
<br><br>
explained Chaim.
<br><br>
The distinct characteristic of a Chaotic Source Spirit was that it could absorb power. No matter how strong the attack was, it would just absorb it all.
<br><br>
Because of this distinct feature, many powerful masters in the Source World underwent the Chaotic Source Reinforcement to raise the level of their body strength.
<br><br>
However, this characteristic made the Chaotic Source Spirits extremely difficult to capture.
<br><br>
It would be a much easier task if there was only one Chaotic Source Spirit hidden in the rock. They could just tire it out by unleashing continued attacks and then break the rock to capture it. Zen had successfully done this before.
<br><br>
However, this was a different matter. There were many Chaotic Source Spirits hidden together inside the rock. Therefore, they were probably even more powerful. Naturally, it was out of the question to exhaust them all. It would be too difficult and energy-consuming. This seemingly ordinary stone pillar was actually tough to break.
<br><br>
To top it off, there were poisonous ants that built their nests inside the stone pillar. This made it more troublesome to deal with. No one would be able to come close to it.
<br><br>
Chaim was a wise man. Nevertheless, there was nothing else he could do after trying so many times and failing each time. This situation seemed hopeless.
<br><br>
"How about you, Zen? Do you have an idea?" Chaim asked with an air of frustration.
<br><br>
Zen pondered upon this problem for a while. After observing the stone pillar, he responded, "If there are many Chaotic Source Spirits hidden in the stone pillar, I'm afraid one or two people are not enough to break it."
<br><br>
"Of course. That much is obvious," replied Chaim with a nod.
<br><br>
"Then, that leaves us with one option. Let's kill those ants first," said Zen with a confident smile.
<br><br>
Actually, he had another simple and crude tactic up his sleeve. He could use that chess board to summon the Regal Jade Beasts. The Regal Jade Beasts should not be afraid of the poison of these ants. But many divine crystals would be consumed. Moreover, Zen had no intention of using the Civilization Artifact this early.
<br><br>
"That is easier said than done. These vicious ants are very strong." A werewolf of the Celestial Wolf race was listening to their conversation. He couldn't help but chime in. His clansman was poisoned to death. Needless to say, he was very afraid of the fearsome ants.
<br><br>
In actuality, the beasts in the Source World were not that powerful. Those that were not very intelligent were even less powerful. Because of their low intelligence, they were unable to cultivate the Truth of Godly Way and could not bear an Other Shore Token. Therefore, their strength was not on the same level as that of the warriors at the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
Soon after the werewolf shared his opinion, a strange expression crossed Zen's face. "I'll give it a try," he replied boldly.
<br><br>
He was not afraid of the poison. He might as well try to kill these pesky ants.
<br><br>
As soon as he said this, he rushed towards the stone pillar. In the blink of an eye, he was standing right next to it.
<br><br>
"Zen, please be careful!"
<br><br>
Naturally, Chaim knew that Zen was truly extraordinary.
<br><br>
Though he didn't know that Zen was the man known as Thad in the Dark Region, the treatment he received at the gate of the Chaotic Source World was good enough to prove his strength.
<br><br>
Chaim thought that Zen's aura was somewhat similar to Thad's.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, it didn't really matter whether they were the same person or not.
<br><br>
Sally looked extremely nervous while watching Zen.
<br><br>
The moment Zen approached the pillar, it trembled slightly. He felt as though there was some kind of power emanating from it. However, it vanished instantly. This made Zen feel a little uncomfortable.
<br><br>
Shortly after, red lights flickered inside the small holes on the pillar again.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! All of a sudden, dozens of ants rushed out of the stone pillar. They flapped the wings on their backs and headed straight towards Zen.
<br><br>
Chaim, Sally, and the others were over a thousand feet away. But as soon as they saw the poisonous ants flying in the sky, they were all forced to retreat.
<br><br>
If the ants chased after them, they would escape from the cave without a second thought.
<br><br>
"Their speed is astounding!"
<br><br>
As the ants flew fast and circled around Zen, they appeared like solid black lines. The speed of their flight was way beyond Zen's expectation.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The ants circled Zen a few more times before they opened their mouths and charged towards Zen. Their huge clicking jaws looked absolutely menacing.
<br><br>
Zen moved his feet slightly and levitated in the air. With slight twists and turns, he perfectly avoided the attacks of the ants.
<br><br>
At the same time, he grabbed a fierce ant by its abdomen and forcefully smashed it on the ground.
<br><br>
However, the ant just turned its body in an incredibly unusual angle and sank its huge jaws into Zen's arm.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Both its left and right jaws were able to puncture Zen's skin.
<br><br>
"What? Unbelievable!"
<br><br>
Zen was absolutely startled.
<br><br>
He realized that he clearly underestimated the strength of these ferocious ants. He didn't activate the Shade Stone liquid to protect his body. Thus, the ant was able to pierce his skin directly.
<br><br>
This was why even strong warriors like Chaim were incapable of dealing with these ants.
<br><br>
"Zen!" Sally screamed as she saw Zen getting bitten by the poisonous ant.
<br><br>
"Zen!" Chaim yelled together with Sally. This was not a good sight to behold.
<br><br>
Chaim was thoroughly shocked at how reckless Zen was. He did not expect this at all.
<br><br>
A look of disdain appeared upon the faces of the others who witnessed this.
<br><br>
Zen seemed like a highly important figure. However, he turned out to be a foolishly reckless man who underestimated his enemy. Now, he'd gotten himself killed because of his carelessness and impatience.
<br><br>
Chapter 3378 A Silver Haired Young Man Zen was a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm. Even if he was poisoned, he could cut off his arm for survival.
<br><br>
But the deadly poison of the fierce ant could take all the lives in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
A member of the Celestial Wolf race was bitten by one of those ants. He died instantly. There was no chance to treat the wound or slow the poison.
<br><br>
When Chaim and the others saw that, they were scared out of their wits.
<br><br>
None of them was willing to risk death to rescue Zen. He was done for.
<br><br>
But while everyone watched, Zen wrenched the jaws of the giant ant away from his arm. Then, he shifted his grip and grabbed the creature's head.
<br><br>
But Zen's squeeze wasn't enough to crack its hard shell. It could withstand three hundred divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
"Hey..."
<br><br>
Zen smiled helplessly, and squeezed harder with five hundred divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Crack! The young warrior managed to crush the ant.
<br><br>
As Zen smashed his foe to smithereens, the other ants hovering around the scene became even more manic. They dived at Zen at breakneck speed.
<br><br>
Chaim, Sally, and the members of the other races all stared at Zen.
<br><br>
Some of them were silently counting down the seconds, making bets on how long Zen would last. He'd been bitten, after all.
<br><br>
But Zen didn't seem to be suffering any ill effects. It almost like he hadn't been poisoned by that bite.
<br><br>
His figure was still as ethereal as usual, shuttling freely to and fro, fending off the siege of those fierce flying ants.
<br><br>
Seizing the moment, Zen stretched out his arms and caught an ant. He shredded it and watched the pieces drop to his feet.
<br><br>
"Is, is he really poisoned?"
<br><br>
"Did we make a mistake just now?"
<br><br>
"He doesn't seem to be any weaker."
<br><br>
The warriors stared at Zen intently, as if they wanted to see the venom coursing through Zen's body.
<br><br>
"Maybe our eyes were playing tricks on us." Chaim smiled wryly.
<br><br>
"We'll see in a minute. Look!" Sally said, pointing at Zen's back.
<br><br>
The swarm of ants circled around Zen like a cyclone. One of them landed on Zen, and sunk its poisonous mandibles into his back.
<br><br>
Zen merely slapped at the ant.
<br><br>
The vermin was crushed to pieces by several hundred divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Seeing that Zen was still alive, Chaim, Sally and the others finally realized that Zen was not afraid of the poison at all. He might even be immune. That was why he dared to charge fearlessly forward.
<br><br>
"Is he a puppet?" a non-human stranger speculated.
<br><br>
There were some amazing puppet-making skills in the Source World, with which the carvers could make the most realistic-looking marionettes.
<br><br>
The puppets were not made of flesh and blood, so they wouldn't have to worry about any kind of venom.
<br><br>
"Zen's no puppet," said Sally proudly. "He has special talents. The ants' poison can't kill him."
<br><br>
How could a puppet without a soul enter the Other Shore? How could Zen be a puppet? As the young master of the Nine Li race, he was strong and powerful.
<br><br>
When the others saw the expression on Sally's face, they couldn't help but curl their lips. She was worried about Zen a minute ago, but now she seemed like she was cheering him on.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the non-human stranger at the rear of the group had a wicked light in his eyes. No one noticed, because he stood behind everyone. Their gazes were fixed on Zen while he battled the ants.
<br><br>
The stranger was from the Lofty Mountain race. He had mighty-looking limbs, and resembled a gorilla.
<br><br>
The Lofty Mountain race was a minor race in the northern part of the Source World. Since they were so few in number, they had no power. Few in the Source World even knew of them. In the past, one of their race, an evil ape, had been one of the supreme masters there.
<br><br>
He died before the Lofty Mountain race could expand and conquer. So the Lofty Mountain race had fallen into obscurity over the years and had almost been forgotten.
<br><br>
In the past few years, the Bearing race expanded along the Pearl Islet to the north, and occupied the territory of the Lofty Mountain race.
<br><br>
The Lofty Mountain race couldn't mount any kind of resistance. They either paid allegiance to the Bearing race or were exterminated. In the end, they had become a tributary clan of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
But it was good for them, actually.
<br><br>
It was very difficult for them to get tickets to the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Over several decades, maybe a hundred years, only one or two members of the Lofty Mountain race were able to enter the Chaotic Source World to cultivate.
<br><br>
However, when the Chaotic Source World opened this time, the Bearing race had very generously given the Lofty Mountain race three tickets, so they were overjoyed.
<br><br>
If it weren't for the Bearing race, he wouldn't be standing here now.
<br><br>
The non-human stranger did not hate the Bearing race for occupying his race's territory. Instead, he was full of gratitude.
<br><br>
As long as he was useful to the Bearing race, he would be able to reap lavish rewards. The loot was more than he had ever imagined. No wonder the Bearing race was a super force.
<br><br>
Before they set out, the Bearing race made a list. On that list was a record of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace that they had to pay special attention to.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, the New Moon race, the Divine Farmer race, the Lofty Mountain race and a dozen of other small races had all obtained the list.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Efrain, Chaim, Milo, and a few others from the other mountains were in the second row.
<br><br>
Elvinia was in the first row.
<br><br>
The man named Thad had destroyed the Bearing race's temple. Moreover, they had been defeated by him for several times on the Other Shore, so they had long been seeking revenge.
<br><br>
They didn't know whether Thad was a disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace, but since he was in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World, he would definitely enter the Chaotic Source World to cultivate. It was likely that he would come here with the palace.
<br><br>
Therefore, they planned to eliminate the exceptional disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
At first, there was only one name on the first row of the list: Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia made her appearance at Stage Thirteen as a denizen of the Other Shore, so they already knew who she was. That was why the Bearing race made her the first target.
<br><br>
But just before the Chaotic Source World opened, there was another person's name occupying the first row of that list. That was Zen, the guy in front of the stone pillar.
<br><br>
While everyone was gobsmacked at Zen's immunity to the poison, the nonhuman stranger quietly crushed a rune.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race could communicate with each other with the help of the Yellow Emperor Magatama, but this non-human stranger was not important enough to have one.
<br><br>
However, the Bearing race had been well prepared when they issued that list.
<br><br>
On the list, next to those names were runes with different colors. The nonhuman stranger crushed the rune next to Zen's name.
<br><br>
When he crumbled the rune, the soul marks of certain races tingled. The Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race all felt it.
<br><br>
Atop a mountain, a silver haired young man stabbed a spear into the ground and stood still.
<br><br>
The hurricane kept blowing around him.
<br><br>
It was almost unthinkable, but the hurricane with several thousand divine megatons of force was unable to blow him away! Of course he could not resist such a powerful hurricane. If you looked carefully, you could see tiny currents surging and circulating around him.
<br><br>
He had made himself one with the wind.
<br><br>
By doing this, he made the hurricane forget him. This was his way of cultivation.
<br><br>
He wouldn't miss this opportunity to strengthen himself.
<br><br>
At this moment, he suddenly opened his eyes, looking off in the distance.
<br><br>
"That didn't take long," he muttered. "They found the man named Zen. But he's too far away from me. I'll spare his life for now."
<br><br>
Then he closed his eyes again. He stood still in the wind like an iron tower.
<br><br>
Chapter 3379 Pouring Out The hurricane swirled, the black smog within it looking dangerous as it went.
<br><br>
In the hurricane, two Divine Lair women spread out their wings and began to fly downwind.
<br><br>
They couldn't ignore the power of this hurricane, but they could sometimes control their direction and the distance they covered as they flew downwind.
<br><br>
The first woman's eyes flashed before she turned to the other and said, "Brylee, Did you feel that?"
<br><br>
"Yes." Brylee nodded. "If my memory serves me right, it should be a member of the Lofty Mountain race who sent out the signal."
<br><br>
"Your memory is good, Brylee," Lesly said with a smile. "The key is that Zen guy is right there."
<br><br>
Her voice had turned cold with hatred at the mention of Zen's name.
<br><br>
Elizabeth wasn't the strongest among the warriors in the Sun Crow race but every woman in the Divine Lair had the utmost respect for her.
<br><br>
And Zen had committed the unforgivable sin of offending Elizabeth.
<br><br>
The Bearing race had included Zen in the kill list. They would kill every warrior they thought might be Thad. So irrespective of whether or not Zen was Thad, they would kill him in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race hated Zen even more because they respected Elizabeth greatly.
<br><br>
"Should we go there?" Brylee asked.
<br><br>
"Of course! He's not that far away. Also, someone else will be joining us,"
<br><br>
Lesly replied. She paused before continuing, "The hurricane is still blowing, and many people can't move in this situation. But once the hurricane stops, a lot of people will approach him. The target will probably take shelter somewhere or hide in some cave."
<br><br>
Saying thus, Lesly spread out her golden wings and took off, closely followed by Brylee.
<br><br>
Inside the cave...
<br><br>
Zen had finally managed to kill all the ants that had emerged from the pillar.
<br><br>
But Chaim and the others were still scared of approaching the pillar.
<br><br>
Zen had only managed to kill a small number of the ants. There were more where they had emerged from. And no one wanted to risk their lives before the ants were cleared out.
<br><br>
The ants, that had emitted red light from the holes of the pillar, were now hiding so that the people standing outside couldn't see them.
<br><br>
"They are not coming out?"
<br><br>
Zen said, confused, looking into the holes that were now pitch dark. He couldn't see anything, try as he might.
<br><br>
But when he used his spiritual sense to try and perceive what was going on in there, he found that something in the stone pillar was blocking his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
It didn't matter if the ants weren't coming out. Zen wasn't about to show them any mercy.
<br><br>
He took a step back and a short pause later, he suddenly pulled out the power of the Strength God Totem in a mighty burst. As the surging power gathered at his fist, he threw a punch at the stone pillar.
<br><br>
Bang! The Chaotic Source Spirits hidden in the stone pillar completely absorbed the power of his punch. The pillar shook slightly before returning to normal.
<br><br>
Zen might have failed in his attempt to break the pillar, but he wasn't discouraged.
<br><br>
The stronger this pillar was, the higher the number of Chaotic Source Spirits there were in it.
<br><br>
He would reap more benefits when the pillar finally broke.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! Dong! Zen punched the stone pillar again and again, the Other Shore Power he was releasing in the process becoming more powerful with each punch.
<br><br>
Chaim was amazed at the power in Zen's fist. No wonder Zen was the champion of the Seven Mountains Meeting. Chaim wondered which level his sword skill had reached.
<br><br>
Zen's punches were powerful but they weren't strong enough to break the defense of so many Chaotic Source Spirits gathered together.
<br><br>
As he continued to punch the pillar, a dull sound reverberated around them.
<br><br>
Sally's Iridescent Stone smashed into the stone pillar.
<br><br>
Zen turned and found Sally nodding at him, smiling. She then reached out, causing the Iridescent Stone to fly back to her.
<br><br>
She didn't dare approach the pillar but she could still help Zen.
<br><br>
A member of the Celestial Wolf race had also summoned his own Other Shore Token, a dark gray spear that probably came from a race on the Other Shore since it was not naturally formed. It was exquisite and seemed to have been carved from a special material.
<br><br>
This member of the Celestial Wolf race didn't want to be left behind, given that Sally was also helping Zen to break the pillar.
<br><br>
If he contributed his strength right now, he could demand a share of the Chaotic Source Spirits when the pillar finally broke.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The member of the Celestial Wolf race threw the spear. It whistled as it cut through the air before stabbing the pillar.
<br><br>
Snap! The pillar trembled, but the spear failed to make even a small mark on it.
<br><br>
This was why the Chaotic Source Spirits were deemed powerful.
<br><br>
No one was able to hurt them before the Chaotic Source Spirits had gotten tired. These Chaotic Source Spirits could help the Chaotic Source Realm warriors to absorb any harm that came their way. The stone pillar was obviously a Chaotic Source Realm master.
<br><br>
As Zen, Sally, and the member of the Celestial Wolf race took turns to attack the pillar, the ants were no longer flying out of the holes, which caused the other creatures to become braver.
<br><br>
Even if they didn't have the descending type of Other Shore Tokens, they could still use other methods to launch an attack. And even though their attacks weren't too powerful, as the saying went, "When everybody adds fuel, the flames rise high." Everybody was trying their best to help.
<br><br>
Bang! Boom! Dong! Dong! Dong! For one wild moment, everyone began to display different kinds of theurgies and rumbling noises echoed throughout the cave.
<br><br>
The attacks from the crowd lasted for about three minutes. The ants hiding in the stone pillar couldn't stand it anymore.
<br><br>
Red dots of light emerged from the fist-sized holes.
<br><br>
The warriors became vigilant as they saw the red light that the ferocious ants were releasing. Chaim said, "Everyone! Be careful. Run!"
<br><br>
Chaim had barely finished warning everyone when the ants came pouring out of the stone pillar, flying in all directions. There were probably thousands of them.
<br><br>
Most of the ants came to surround Zen, taking him as their first target, since he was nearest the pillar.
<br><br>
But several hundred ants had scattered and they went flying towards Chaim and the other warriors. Chaim retreated abruptly, trying to escape the cave.
<br><br>
They weren't like Zen, who could stand there and resist being bitten by the ants.
<br><br>
They'd be doomed if the fierce ants were to bite them.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
The warriors of the Celestial Wolf race and several other nonhuman creatures began to run towards the entrance of the cave alongside Sally.
<br><br>
They might not be as afraid of these ants in the open space outside.
<br><br>
But as Chaim walked along the rugged path in the cave, the howling of the wind stirred a bad premonition within him.
<br><br>
The moment he arrived at the entrance of the cave, the hurricane poured in, blowing him aside and smashing him into the wall.
<br><br>
It was now blocking the cave's exit.
<br><br>
With their strength, it would be next to impossible for them to go up against the wind.
<br><br>
The warriors' hearts sank at this sight.
<br><br>
Behind them, the wings of the ants vibrated and hummed. If they couldn't get out of the cave, all of them would die here today.
<br><br>
Chapter 3380 The Living Puppet Chains "Ah! Ah!"
<br><br>
"An ant is biting me!"
<br><br>
"Back off!"
<br><br>
Two members of the Moon Spirit race and one of the Celestial Wolf race shrieked miserably as the fearsome jaws of the ants clamped down on them.
<br><br>
But they then froze and flopped to the ground as they died, their bodies rotting immediately.
<br><br>
This surprised the others.
<br><br>
The one from the Lofty Mountain race and the other from the Celestial Wolf race launched a frenzied counterattack on the ants.
<br><br>
They could certainly kill a few ants with their strength, but it would be far from enough.
<br><br>
The member of the Lofty Mountain race was seriously disheartened and disappointed. If he had known this would happen, he would have found an excuse to avoid all this and hide outside before the hurricane showed up.
<br><br>
His longing for the Chaotic Source Spirits had put him here however, and now he was caught in his own trap with no chance of escape.
<br><br>
It would be a pity to die like that.
<br><br>
Chaim and Sally stood at the entrance to the cave, their faces grim as their situation seemed to be getting bleaker.
<br><br>
As the ants got closer and closer, Chaim cleared his thoughts and made his mind up.
<br><br>
He stood shielding Sally, knowing what he had to do.
<br><br>
He was one of the best disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace. His strength could not be underestimated.
<br><br>
He cared little for the lives of the other races, but he could see at a glance that Sally and Zen shared an unusual relationship and so he would do whatever was necessary to protect her.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, he raised his hand and activated his Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Dozens of chains spread out along his left hand, each with thin, sharp spikes on the end.
<br><br>
The chains slithered out and suddenly darted towards Chaim's own body.
<br><br>
Phew! Phew! Phew! The chains pierced deep into his chest, cinnabar field, arms, legs, and even forehead.
<br><br>
Once his entire body had been punctured, the chains began spreading throughout his veins, bones and internal organs, covering his whole body.
<br><br>
The light in his eyes faded as he fell into a trance. His energy force had gone and he now looked like a dead man pierced with chains.
<br><br>
But he was now extremely flexible and agile.
<br><br>
He drew a long snow-white sword from his waist and floated like a terrifying ghost.
<br><br>
"Chaim..."
<br><br>
His aura had changed drastically. To Sally, he was no longer a living creature. He seemed more like a puppet.
<br><br>
To any creature, he seemed like a puppet.
<br><br>
The chains were a very rare token on the Other Shore, called the Living Puppet Chains.
<br><br>
Chaim had practiced the Truth of Cultivation Nature and the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent at the same time, and so he had two Other Shore Tokens. He seldom showed the Living Puppet Chains to others.
<br><br>
Once the Living Puppet Chains had been activated, his energy was lost and he fell unconscious. He was now in the control of the Living Puppet Chains, truly a puppet.
<br><br>
But as a puppet, his strength could skyrocket in a matter of moments.
<br><br>
His speed, reactions and power would be boosted considerably.
<br><br>
There was, however, a huge drawback to the Living Puppet Chains; they would take a massive toll on the user's body. After employing them, the user would be left weak for a while and even the inner world would be greatly disrupted and disturbed.
<br><br>
In other words, if the user failed to kill his opponent with this Other Shore Token, he would most certainly die himself.
<br><br>
For this reason, Chaim would only use it when absolutely necessary, and right now he had no other option.
<br><br>
Phew! He glided swiftly with his long sword.
<br><br>
Even the sword he had thrust out swayed. He was as clumsy as a puppet.
<br><br>
However, the swaying long sword was precise, cutting a flying ant in half with a single flick.
<br><br>
The ants attacking the other races now focused their efforts towards Chaim on seeing the sharp counterattack he had produced.
<br><br>
The chains deeply rooted in his body were closely connected to his every vein, muscle and bone.
<br><br>
He showed incredible skill in his movement, not allowing a single ant to touch even his sleeve.
<br><br>
With every wave of his long sword, he sliced several ants in two.
<br><br>
Five to six hundred ants had pounced at him and in the blink of an eye, only two to three hundred were left. The ants' severed bodies lay on the ground, fluttering their broken wings uselessly.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The sword radiance crisscrossed.
<br><br>
"So powerful!"
<br><br>
"It's no wonder he ranks highest in a super force!"
<br><br>
The remaining members of the Celestial Wolf race, the Moon Spirit race and the Lofty Mountain race were all stunned by what they saw.
<br><br>
Previously, they thought Chaim was only a little stronger than them. Alone they had no shot, but if they worked together, they might be able to defeat him.
<br><br>
However, the power Chaim now displayed was enough to kill them all.
<br><br>
Chaim continued to kill most of the remaining ants.
<br><br>
Cling! Cling! Cling! Once the crisis had been averted, the chains shuddered, slid out from his body and disappeared into his left hand.
<br><br>
Chaim was conscious again but totally exhausted and unable to walk. Sally ran over to hold and help him.
<br><br>
"Be careful. There may be more fierce ants coming. I'm counting on you now," Chaim said as he sat down slowly and took out some divine crystals from his body. He tried to crush them to absorb their energy, but with his strength dwindling, he could not do it.
<br><br>
Sally saw this and assisted him.
<br><br>
The few remaining fierce ants flew over, but they were no threat to the group.
<br><br>
They might have been fast, but there were not many of them now. The other races were on high alert and could take care of them quite easily.
<br><br>
"I want to go down and have a look," Sally said after she helped Chaim absorb several hundred divine crystals.
<br><br>
Although Zen was not afraid of the ants' poison, Sally was still concerned.
<br><br>
The members of the Lofty Mountain race, the Celestial Wolf race, and the Moon Spirit race all nodded. Of course, it was not Zen they were worried about. They cared only for the Chaos Source Spirits in the stone pillar.
<br><br>
If Zen killed those ants and did whatever was necessary to open the pillar, he would take the Chaotic Source Spirits for himself.
<br><br>
"Let's go down together," Chaim said.
<br><br>
He could move freely now that he had absorbed the divine crystals, but his strength had still not yet been fully restored.
<br><br>
The three members of the other races, Sally and Chaim began making their way down. Before they entered the cave below, they heard the clangs of Zen's sword.
<br><br>
There Zen stood. The bodies of ants piled up beside him and only a few ants were left in the air.
<br><br>
Chapter 3381 The Queen Ant Zen's perception was sensitive and accurate. As he saw Sally and Chaim come down from his peripheral view, he finally felt relieved.
<br><br>
A moment earlier, he saw several hundred vicious ants chasing after Sally.
<br><br>
He knew that it wasn't easy to deal with those creatures, so he was worried about her safety.
<br><br>
However, he couldn't offer her any help since he already turned himself as bait in order to attract more ants into attacking him. The moment he followed her, all the ants would also follow him, leading to a much worse situation.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Sally had Chaim protecting her and his capabilities had lived up to Zen's expectations.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Zen withdrew his gaze from Sally and Chaim and composed himself into facing the ants in front of him. As he focused, several rays of sword radiance spiraled out.
<br><br>
The rest of the wild ants were swallowed by his sword radiance. In an instant, numerous dead bodies of ants filled the cave.
<br><br>
"Zen has slaughtered all the ants!" Sally exclaimed as she clapped her hands.
<br><br>
The members of the Lofty Mountain race, the Moon Spirit race, and the Celestial Wolf race were all overjoyed and sighed with great relief.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it was a splendid moment for the one from the Lofty Mountain race. He was able to survive the ants' siege and it seemed he was also able to acquire some Chaotic Source Spirits. All he needed to do now was wait for the large races to come over and kill Zen.
<br><br>
Now, there was just the stone pillar left since all the ants had been slain.
<br><br>
With their combined skills and efforts, it should not be a problem to destroy it easily.
<br><br>
However, as they started approaching the pillar, Zen suddenly felt a strong surge of force from within it.
<br><br>
Immediately after, red ants quickly came out of the small holes on the pillar.
<br><br>
Zen sensed an enormous amount of energy stored within their bodies as they rushed towards him.
<br><br>
"More ants are coming!"
<br><br>
"Be careful! Each ant contains an astonishing amount of energy."
<br><br>
"Move back! Hurry up and step back!"
<br><br>
The three members of the other races who had just come down hurriedly retreated back to the upward passage.
<br><br>
A few dozens of red ants came to sight.
<br><br>
They were much lesser in number compared to the horde of wild ants that Zen had slaughtered earlier, but he knew that he needed to be cautious as they were far stronger than the previous bunch.
<br><br>
As one of the red ants that approached Zen was only a few steps away from him, the bright red pigment on its body surface began to boil. In the blink of an eye, the fierce energy made it explode in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Boom! The shock wave produced by the explosion of the red ant sent Zen flying backward.
<br><br>
Even Chaim and Sally, who were relatively far away, were affected by the shock wave and were blown backward, hitting the mountain walls again.
<br><br>
They were surprised as it was just the strength of a single red ant. The rest of the red ants started chasing Zen and didn't give him a chance to counterattack.
<br><br>
"I was too careless," Zen muttered to himself.
<br><br>
He thought that if those dozens of red ants exploded at the same time, his body would likely be crushed to pieces.
<br><br>
But he already learned from that mistake and wouldn't let them have another chance. As the red ants rushed towards him again, he released his energy, turning his arms, face, and chest to pitch black.
<br><br>
After being fully prepared, Zen stabbed one ant with his sword.
<br><br>
As the sword radiance cut the red ant open, it immediately exploded and caused a huge shock wave.
<br><br>
This time, Zen had already made adjustments with his body. Upon receiving the shock wave, his body smoothly followed through the impact and landed steadily in a distance. Then, he began stabbing the other red ants that came at him.
<br><br>
Each of Zen's strike would cause a red ant to detonate. While the ants exploded one by one, he would just glide over and change his position to attack the remaining ones.
<br><br>
More and more red ants were detonated as Zen continued his skillful attack.
<br><br>
Before long, the last red ant exploded and the cave fell silent again.
<br><br>
They were caught off guard when they carelessly approached the stone pillar earlier.
<br><br>
This time, Zen waited for a while before making any move to the stone pillar.
<br><br>
As he stood from a distance, a pair of huge white jaws suddenly surfaced from the bottom of the stone pillar. These jaws bit the pillar and a huge hole appeared.
<br><br>
Seeing the scene clearly, everyone was stunned.
<br><br>
They knew how sturdy the pillar was. As the Chaotic Source Spirits were hidden in it, they would have a hard time destroying it, even with their combined efforts.
<br><br>
However, with a single bite from the huge white jaws, a large hole was created.
<br><br>
"What on earth is that? How could it destroy the pillar so easily?" Sally uttered in a nervous tone.
<br><br>
"It's the queen ant. It's crawling out of the pillar!" Panic was written all over Chaim's face.
<br><br>
"The queen ant has such great power?" A wrinkle on Zen's forehead was formed as he realized the formidable strength of their foe.
<br><br>
For the queen ant to destroy the stone pillar, it must have possessed tens of thousands of divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
The habits and nature of ants were all the same across every species. The poisonous ants that they first encountered should be the ordinary workforce.
<br><br>
They were responsible for acquiring food for the queen ant and the rest of the colony. The red ants that could self-destruct were the battle-type. They would sacrifice themselves if they needed to, just to protect the queen ant.
<br><br>
After Zen had killed all the worker and soldier ants, the queen ant crawled out personally.
<br><br>
The white translucent queen ant was as long as a human being and had a huge abdomen. Everyone's attention was caught by its unusually huge abdomen as it crawled out from the bottom of the pillar.
<br><br>
There was something in the queen ant's abdomen that made the members of the other races fix their eyes on it with greedy stares.
<br><br>
There, lying in its translucent abdomen were several precious amber crystals.
<br><br>
"Are those Chaotic Source Spirits?"
<br><br>
"There are so many of them! Did the queen ant swallow them all?"
<br><br>
"No wonder it can easily destroy the stone pillar with a single blow!"
<br><br>
They clearly saw the Chaotic Source Spirits in the queen ant's abdomen. It was the queen ant that made the stone pillar so solid.
<br><br>
The white queen ant did not take any immediate action after it showed itself.
<br><br>
It slightly crawled on the ground with its loaded abdomen while the humongous jaws shook. The tentacles on its head shuddered to perceive the surrounding environment as it exuded a ferocious aura.
<br><br>
"It has so many Chaotic Source Spirits in its stomach. Even if it hasn't refined them, it would still possess tremendous strength comparable to the warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm," Chaim noted with a bitter smile as he shook his head. "Zen, we don't stand a chance. Let's just escape while we can."
<br><br>
No one here knew better than Chaim if it came to the strength of the warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
He, together with the outstanding disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace like Efrain, had stayed at the Land of Sword Grief for quite some time.
<br><br>
Not everyone in the Land of Sword Grief was strong. Most of them had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, meaning that they weren't strong enough to be the backbone of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Efrain had once battled with those who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but he didn't even hurt them a little bit. Although the cultivation level of Efrain's opponents was above his, Chaim was greatly shocked to observe the huge gap in strength. He firmly believed that he wouldn't be able to defeat warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm unless he underwent the Chaotic Source Reinforcement as well.
<br><br>
However, last time, Zen had proved this to be wrong. With the help of the Civilization Artifact, he easily took down Chance in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, due to Jean's intervention, the matter was only known to a few people of the Phoenix Palace. They didn't let the other disciples know about it.
<br><br>
"It's not at the Chaotic Source Realm, trust me." Zen stared at the queen ant and continued, "And even if it is, there must be a way to defeat it."
<br><br>
Considering the number of Chaotic Source Spirits that were in the possession of the queen ant, Zen was unwilling to leave and just let go of the opportunity.
<br><br>
Chapter 3382 The Sturdy Body The tensed faces of the three people from the other races relaxed as they sensed Zen's unwavering confidence.
<br><br>
Even if they got ahold of only a few of the many Chaotic Source Spirits, they would be satisfied.
<br><br>
Chaim still harbored doubts, and he didn't want to let his guard down. He felt worried since he would be of no help, at least not for a short while.
<br><br>
Because Chaim had just used the Living Puppet Chains, he needed time before he could offer assistance.
<br><br>
Just when Chaim was about to voice his fears, the queen ant finally began to move.
<br><br>
Even though the queen ant appeared to be overweight, it was still quite agile in its ability to move. It maneuvered itself in an arc on the ground before it headed directly towards Zen.
<br><br>
It might have sensed Zen to be the biggest threat in the cave, so eliminating him first became its primary goal.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Watching the queen ant approach him with malicious intents, Zen prepared himself by drawing out his long sword. His eyes flashed with a wild fighting spirit flaring up as he studied its movements.
<br><br>
Even though he braced for the upcoming attack, Zen couldn't help but feel a little worried and confused by the situation.
<br><br>
However, his worries were not tied to Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Even if these Chaotic Source Spirits collectively contributed to strengthening the body of the queen ant, they could only make it more durable. It would have the resistance of a punching bag, resilient and solid, but not intimidating.
<br><br>
The real issue was to figure out the source of the power of those fierce ants that attacked them earlier.
<br><br>
Each of those poisonous ants contained the power of dozens of divine megatons.
<br><br>
The only way to obtain such power in the Source World was to enter the Other Shore and fuse oneself with an Other Shore Token. Other than that, it was close to impossible for one's physical body to contain the strength of dozens of divine megatons. Even someone like Zen would be unable to do so without entering the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, these ants didn't have a mind of their own. Their strings of control were in the hands of the queen ant. They would follow every order from it blindly without question. Even the orders to lay siege to the intruders were from the queen ant.
<br><br>
Compared to them, the queen ant was quite intelligent. Zen could tell its soul was not to be underestimated when he sensed the aura it emitted. It must have entered the Other Shore through the Truth of Cultivation Nature and later fused with an Other Shore Token...
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token in its possession could provide each of the several thousand ants with dozens of divine megatons of force. Gathering all that power together would further add up to tens of thousands of divine megatons under the queen ant's control.
<br><br>
As the queen ant closed the distance between it and Zen, it was time for him to make his move. Zen jumped back and stationed himself on the wall of the cave. He used it as a boost and turned over to fall backwards towards the queen ant. His body dropped at an alarmingly high speed.
<br><br>
Zen kept his long sword grasped tightly in his hands as he directed himself towards the queen ant's abdomen from above.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The seemingly fragile translucent abdomen of the queen ant made contact with Zen's long sword.
<br><br>
As Zen tried to use the pressure of the air to pierce his way through, the Chaotic Source Spirits housed in the belly of the queen ant flashed in front of him. It soon occurred to him that his offensive strike failed as the Chaotic Source Spirits had absorbed all the power from it! "Whap!"
<br><br>
The ant's head was surprisingly flexible. It suddenly twisted its head frantically to shake off Zen and bite his head off.
<br><br>
After his first traumatic encounter with the ants, Zen had become more cautious of the poisonous bites of the ants. Previously, he had let his guard down and had his arm chewed on by a poisonous ant. That incident alone taught him to remain at a safe distance from them.
<br><br>
After he failed to cut down the belly of the queen ant, Zen retreated to gain some distance from his opponent to rethink his strategy.
<br><br>
Just then, a white-colored ring suddenly shot up above the queen ant's head.
<br><br>
The ring spun around and unleashed a ray of white light. The ant corpses that were connected to this white light regained vitality in their limbs and started to move again! With swift movements, they spun around to weave a huge dense net and moved towards the queen ant. The net of the dead bodies of the ants closed in on Zen, who kept on his attempts to retreat.
<br><br>
However, the queen ant tossed the net at Zen so quickly that he didn't have time to react. He wanted to dodge it, but the queen ant left him with no window to squirm his way out of it. Within a split second, he was entrapped in the huge net woven by the corpses of the dead ants, and was dragged back! The queen ant opened its mouth to reveal its terrifying jaws in hopes of taking a bite out of Zen's approaching body. Suddenly, a colorful light sprung over in its direction.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The Iridescent Stone flung towards the queen ant and slammed itself against its head.
<br><br>
The Iridescent Stone could strike its target without any assistance. Its movements were extremely fast and powerful, which made it hard for the queen ant to bypass it in time. It was a phenomenal Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
As the queen ant's head was forced to lean back from the impact, Zen took advantage of the moment and slipped away from the huge net.
<br><br>
'There's no doubt the Other Shore Token that the queen ant fused with is strong. However, I might have overestimated it. It seems I have made a slight error in my judgment...' While he kept at a safe range from the queen ant, he began to strategize in his mind as he focused hard.
<br><br>
The source of the power of all the ants lay in the queen ant itself. However, there was a slight loophole. The queen ant was unable to provide all of the ants with the same power at the same time. It was only able to give power to a limited number of ants in one go.
<br><br>
When under siege of the ants, Zen discovered they surrounded him from all corners, but didn't strike all at once. Only forty to fifty ants per wave made a move, while the rest just stood by and watched.
<br><br>
At that time, he did have doubts in his mind as to why they didn't gang up on him. But he didn't pay much attention to it and quickly moved on.
<br><br>
Placing all the pieces of the puzzle together, he realized the queen ant had its limitations in its strength. Only by gathering its entire strength at one point, could the queen ant reach its maximum potential.
<br><br>
However, the ants contained deadly poison. As long as they were granted small amounts of power, it was enough to harm the intruders with their bites. Therefore the queen ant had carefully distributed its strength among the numerous ants using the Other Shore Token—the ring.
<br><br>
If forty to fifty ants were bestowed the power of fifty divine megatons each, the estimated strength of the queen ant would be about two thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
Although they were bothersome to deal with, if the warriors at present worked together, they could help end it sooner.
<br><br>
"We should help Zen! If you choose to just stand by and watch the fight, you don't deserve a share of the Chaotic Source Spirits!" Sally stretched her hand out. As if responding to her gesture, the Iridescent Stone returned to her hand.
<br><br>
At her words, the members of the Moon Spirit race, the Celestial Wolf race, and the Lofty Mountain race stood with expressions of shock.
<br><br>
Zen was superior to them in strength. If he was to defeat the queen ant all by himself, he would be in charge of the distribution of the Chaotic Source Spirits. After all, it was only fair since he did all the work.
<br><br>
If they refused to offer any sort of aid, Zen would hold all the rights to cut them off and take all of the Chaotic Source Spirits for himself.
<br><br>
Sally's words made the three people from the different races drown in selfreflection. As if spurred on by her pep talk, they each took out their respective Other Shore Tokens and charged at the queen ant.
<br><br>
"Sizzle..."
<br><br>
The member of the Moon Spirit race carried a small golden bamboo. As he rushed forward, a bolt of fine lightning gushed out from the golden bamboo and struck the queen ant continuously.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the one from the Celestial Wolf race prepared himself to launch his attack. His hair stood on end, and his fingers morphed into sharp claws that he used to jab at the queen ant.
<br><br>
The strength of the claw radiance wasn't weak when faced with a normal opponent. However, when it struck the queen ant's body, it failed to break through its defensive shell.
<br><br>
The weakest offensive strike was that of the Lofty Mountain member. Since he was scared half to death from the queen ant, he was cautious enough to not approach it. Instead, he decided to find some big rocks on the ground and hurl them at it while maintaining a safe distance. Compared to the sturdy body of the queen ant, those rocks were as fragile as tofu. They were quickly reduced to dust upon collision.
<br><br>
Not only did he fail to contribute to causing significant damage to the queen ant, but he also slowed the others down by blocking their view. Sally gave out an exasperated sigh and yelled angrily, "Stop throwing the rocks! They're not helping!"
<br><br>
The man from the Lofty Mountain race cast a sideways glance at Sally and cursed in his heart. He believed when his reinforcements arrived, they would take away all the Chaotic Source Spirits and kill the others.
<br><br>
Although Sally and the others continued their efforts to bring the queen ant down, they failed to distract its attention from Zen. It didn't bother with them at all.
<br><br>
Even though the queen ant could not speak, there was no denying the fact that it was intelligent. It had a sound judgment of the situation. The only person in the cave capable of threatening it was the young man it kept its gaze on. As long as it killed him, the other creatures wouldn't take up much effort.
<br><br>
Fixated on its target, the queen ant kept chasing after Zen without fail. Zen continuously moved around it to dodge its advances.
<br><br>
'This ant has devoured the Chaotic Soul Spirits. However, it hasn't undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement yet. That means its body still has weaknesses. I just need to find them...' At the thought of this, Zen narrowed his eyes slightly. He began to study its body as a white light appeared in his right eye.
<br><br>
Chapter 3383 The Queen Ant's Flaw In theory, no such thing as perfect exists in the world.
<br><br>
Even the most powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm were also flawed.
<br><br>
Zen, however, still couldn't figure out those powerful warriors' flaws with his current abilities.
<br><br>
He had used the Eye of Will to disturb Chance's mind back in the Phoenix Palace, but he had never truly used it to detect his flaws.
<br><br>
Chance had already undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, so it was not easy to find a flaw in his body.
<br><br>
But the queen ant in front of Zen was different from Chance.
<br><br>
"Sword Texture Technique!"
<br><br>
"Eye of Will!"
<br><br>
A bright beam of white light flashed, and then a remarkably clear world materialized around Zen. It was known as the Authentic Visual World.
<br><br>
In this world, everything was covered by lines.
<br><br>
Sally and Chaim were no exception.
<br><br>
The lines enabled Zen to see everyone's level of strength.
<br><br>
For instance, Chaim's fighting ability had dropped sharply, but his body was an integral whole. He was protecting his flaws, although it was unknown if he did it intentionally or unintentionally.
<br><br>
He didn't practice the Sword Texture Technique. He had his instincts which he gained from his rich experience in battle.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the flaws of Sally and the members of the other races were almost the same.
<br><br>
The queen ant was a whole in the Authentic Visual World, just like what Zen had seen before.
<br><br>
"The queen ant has no flaws? It's impossible!"
<br><br>
He couldn't possibly believe such a thing. Since the queen ant hadn't completed the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, he believed that he could find a flaw.
<br><br>
As its white jaws came for him again, Zen bowed and then jumped up, his long sword in one hand. He didn't attack the queen ant, but simply stared at it.
<br><br>
"What? What is he doing?" Chaim asked, confused.
<br><br>
"He has stopped attacking. Is he going to give up?" the member of the Moon Spirit race said with a frown.
<br><br>
The queen ant had the Chaotic Source Spirits in its belly, which made it invincible, but Zen's current abilities made it easy for him to escape.
<br><br>
The only thing was he wouldn't be able to get any Chaotic Source Spirit if he did so. Naturally, the others were slightly upset because of it.
<br><br>
Of course, they still didn't dare to say anything because after all, Zen was the one fighting and not them.
<br><br>
"Zen will not give up," said Sally firmly. Yet, there was a trace of doubt on her face. What on earth was Zen doing? It seemed like he was observing the queen ant. However, what was the point of examining it like that? As Chaim watched Zen constantly dodge the queen ant while he observed it, something suddenly clicked in his head.
<br><br>
As one of the most outstanding disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace, it was not difficult for him to get a supreme swordsmanship manual. He had even read some of the supreme swordsmanship manuals in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Since Zen is a member of the Flow Sword Sect, he should mainly cultivate the Flow Strike. He had previously employed a strike of the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship. Is it possible that, in addition to these two, he has also cultivated the Sword Texture Technique?"
<br><br>
Every supreme swordsmanship manual represented a peak-level swordsmanship. None of them was better than the others, because their focuses were different.
<br><br>
It was no doubt that one had to put in a lot of effort to comprehend a supreme swordsmanship manual. Not long after Zen had joined the Oneness Sky Palace, he had spent a lot of time on the Other Shore and at the same time, had also learned several supreme swordsmanship manuals. Chaim was very surprised at this thought.
<br><br>
What he didn't know was that Zen had learned the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship as well! "Is the queen ant really flawless?" Zen muttered to himself.
<br><br>
He then activated the power of the Eye of Will, and the white light in his right eye glowed brighter as the pressure increased.
<br><br>
More and more lines came to his sight. The cracks in the space began to emerge.
<br><br>
"I see it! There is a flaw over there!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
Finally, he had found a tiny line on the queen ant's back.
<br><br>
That one small line was very important to him.
<br><br>
As soon as the queen ant turned around, he glided through the air like a flying bird and landed on its belly. He shot out the sword light in a flash and then swiftly fled away.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Such a sword attack didn't seem to have much power. Chaim and the others thought that it was simply like tickling the queen ant. It didn't appear to have any effects on it at all.
<br><br>
Yet at that moment, the amber Chaotic Source Spirits in the queen ant's belly dimmed a little.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Why did the Chaotic Source Spirits become dark?"
<br><br>
"That strike just now should be very ordinary..."
<br><br>
The members of the Celestial Wolf race, the Lofty Mountain race, and the Moon Spirit race looked at each other in confusion. They had no idea what Zen had done.
<br><br>
Chaim had so many theories about Zen for a while. The corners of his mouth twitched upwards as he watched the current scene. It looked like Zen had fully mastered the Sword Texture Technique, but the queen ant had swallowed so many powerful Chaotic Source Spirits. Thus, Zen shouldn't be able to find its flaw, unless he had some special ability.
<br><br>
The queen ant became enraged after Zen had stabbed it. Its tentacles shook, and a strong force burst out from its head. Its fat body became more flexible, and then it chased after Zen.
<br><br>
Just as it was about to catch up with Zen, Sally flung her Iridescent Stone and hit the queen ant hard on the head.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
In return, Zen seized the opportunity and immediately swung his sword.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
At that point, the queen ant's amber Chaotic Source Spirits became dimmer.
<br><br>
According to the records of the Sword Texture Technique, attacking this line was not fatal, but it was enough to cause damage to the queen ant.
<br><br>
Still, the Chaotic Source Spirits were so powerful that they could bear all the damage for the queen ant.
<br><br>
So after Zen had attacked the line, the power of the Chaotic Source Spirits could be quickly consumed.
<br><br>
Bang! Ding! Clank! He didn't fight the queen ant head on, but instead took the chance to strike with his sword again.
<br><br>
If the distance was too long, he would attack with his sword radiance.
<br><br>
The queen ant's reaction was quick, but given its body structure, it couldn't protect the thin line. It was beaten, but it couldn't do anything to Zen no matter how hard it tried to fight back.
<br><br>
After Zen stabbed with his sword for more than ten times, the Chaotic Source Spirits in the queen ant's stomach were exhausted and turned into gray particles.
<br><br>
Once that was done, Sally threw out her Iridescent Stone again! Bang! The Iridescent Stone hit the queen ant's belly hard and its belly crumpled on itself.
<br><br>
Sally's eyes were filled with delight! "The queen ant is dying!" she exclaimed excitedly.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! The queen ant was in a great deal of pain. Its two tentacles collided against each other as it let out a strange, roar-like sound.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the other races joined the fight. The queen ant had lost the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits, and couldn't defend itself anymore.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, bruises were scattered all over its body.
<br><br>
Despite having drained its Chaotic Source Spirits, the queen ant still had its powerful Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Splash! Alas, the queen ant couldn't release enough strength after its Chaotic Source Spirits were spent, and its body became much weaker.
<br><br>
It unleashed its Other Shore Power for the last time and then rushed to the stone pillar like a galloping rhinoceros.
<br><br>
In fact, the stone pillar was not the queen ant's lair. Its actual shelter was a huge maze that connected to the bottom of the cave, stretching thousands of feet.
<br><br>
The queen ant had only appeared because Zen had slaughtered all of its offspring.
<br><br>
The queen ant was full of regret. If it had known such a thing would happen, it would've hidden in its lair instead, and wouldn't have ended up in misery.
<br><br>
It didn't expect that this young human man could find its only flaw! Puff! The moment the queen ant was about to go into the cave under the pillar, Zen threw his long sword.
<br><br>
The sharp silver sword went directly through the queen ant's head, and pinned it to the ground.
<br><br>
Chapter 3384 Collapse After the Chaotic Source Spirits lost their power, the queen ant's defensive power dropped significantly.
<br><br>
However, even without that added defense, the queen ant remained resilient.
<br><br>
It continued to struggle in futility for its life, fighting to stand despite the sword that was deeply lodged through the side of its head.
<br><br>
The three warriors from the Lofty Mountain race, the Moon Spirit race, and the Celestial Wolf race were overjoyed at the scene! Not willing to waste such a wonderful opportunity, the three of them quickly rushed towards the dying queen ant.
<br><br>
Sally and Chaim were left in the dust as the three ran. The Lofty Mountain warrior even reached out in an attempt to tear the ant's belly.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Zen snorted as an unpleasant aura surrounded him.
<br><br>
He was the one who killed the queen ant and there was no way he was going to let these three warriors get his spoils.
<br><br>
The aura he released reached the three warriors and all of them quickly froze in their tracks. How could they continue on when Zen had obviously already staked his claim? If the young man had been able to kill the queen ant that was at the same level of strength as a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, what chance did the three of them have? Zen swooped down and pulled his long sword out of the queen ant's head while the three warriors quickly jumped to the side.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
A rather gruesome sound was heard as Zen lifted his sword and slashed the ant's belly open, revealing all the Chaotic Source Spirits and numerous ant eggs.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits escaped out of the split belly and into his hand one by one.
<br><br>
The three warriors could only look on in longing as they counted the amount of Chaotic Source Spirits Zen gathered from this amazing feat.
<br><br>
They knew the level they stood in wasn't very high and that they would have to make do with whatever amount Zen was willing to give them. Their only hope was that Zen harvested a lot of Chaotic Source Spirits, so the three of them could also expect a bit more for their share.
<br><br>
After the ant's belly had been emptied out of all Chaotic Source Spirits, Zen found that he was able to get more than three hundred in total.
<br><br>
There was only a limited amount of Chaotic Source Spirits one could refine.
<br><br>
An ordinary creature would need about two hundred to undergo the complete Chaotic Source Reinforcement, which meant that the amount Zen had gotten from the ant's belly was more than enough.
<br><br>
He didn't notice it but the eyes of the three warriors behind him burned with fury and determination. They couldn't help but think of the possibility of fighting Zen if the Chaotic Source Spirits weren't enough.
<br><br>
Sally and Chaim, on the other hand, remained calm. Since they were Zen's fellow disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace, he was bound to give some to them.
<br><br>
Zen already knew how he was going to split the Chaotic Source Spirits. He was going to take the lion's share, of course, but he was also definitely going to share with Sally and Chaim. As for those three warriors, he'd give them a few to keep them happy.
<br><br>
At that moment though, two pairs of golden wings appeared on top of the mountain.
<br><br>
The hurricane had already stopped, and Brylee and Lesly now floated peacefully in the air.
<br><br>
"We're in the right place. The warrior of the Lofty Mountain race hasn't moved and all of them are directly below us," Brylee said.
<br><br>
Lesly closed her eyes, sensing the soul mark and nodding. "There are two people from the Bearing race currently rushing over along with one New Moon race's member and another from the Divine Farmer race. Should we wait for them?"
<br><br>
They couldn't underestimate Zen's strength, so they had to be smart and gather as much manpower as they could before going for the kill.
<br><br>
However, Brylee's arrogant smile said otherwise. "Are you scared of that guy?"
<br><br>
All the demon women in the Divine Lair were powerful, but only a few were deemed qualified to be cultivated.
<br><br>
The power of the Sun Crow race's divine flames could suppress anything at the same level.
<br><br>
There was no way they would be afraid of any opponent especially if they could fight together. Lesly huffed, "Fine, let's attack!"
<br><br>
With her directive, the wings on their backs flashed golden light as the Sun Crow race's divine flames burst forth.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Two circles of golden light appeared above their heads. They were the highly condensed divine flames of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
The two of them reached out, summoning pure, golden swords from the circles of golden light.
<br><br>
Brylee pressed her index finger down. "Go!"
<br><br>
Her voice made the golden swords shoot downwards, attacking anything below them.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
Each sword's size was only that of a human palm, but the highly concentrated divine flames of the Sun Crow race could burn almost anything.
<br><br>
The mountain would have resisted this barrage of burning swords had there been more Chaotic Source Spirits around. Unfortunately, all had been eaten by the queen ant.
<br><br>
As soon as the swords reached the mountain, it began to burn, even turning the rocks into magma! Inside the cave, Zen, who was just about to speak, suddenly felt a strong force emanate from above.
<br><br>
It wasn't just him. Even Chaim, Sally, and the other warriors also felt it.
<br><br>
They all raised their heads, straining their eyes to see the top of the cave and found a golden rain of swords pouring down from the heavens.
<br><br>
"Dodge!"
<br><br>
Chaim shouted, responding quickly to the danger and retreating towards a corner of the cave.
<br><br>
Sally also moved to seek shelter, but her path was unfortunately blocked by several golden swords.
<br><br>
One even missed her by mere inches and the heat from it had been enough to burn her hair. She froze in fright and only moved out of the way when someone grabbed her arm and dragged her to the side.
<br><br>
"Ah..."
<br><br>
Of course, it was Zen. He did not just drag her away from harm but also protected her from the sword's flames by blocking it with his hand...
<br><br>
The divine flames weren't enough to activate the Sanskrit words on his body. Golden spirals appeared on Zen's arm, completely snuffing out the flames on the sword.
<br><br>
Sally remained in a daze, only snapping out of it when Zen began to speak.
<br><br>
"This cave is going to collapse! Go to Chaim and stay there!"
<br><br>
He immediately pushed her towards the corner and Sally found herself falling on her butt beside Chaim. Their spot was relatively secure and no flaming sword would be able to get them there.
<br><br>
The three warriors, however, were a different story.
<br><br>
All they wanted was their share of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Why did such a disaster suddenly happen? Where the heck did all these flaming swords come from? They all scurried about, trying desperately to avoid the swords that would no doubt burn them to ash on the spot.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
A sharp sword had pierced through the Celestial Wolf race's member, killing him immediately. It hit him on the head, setting his hair alight. The flames spread all over his body until he was nothing but burnt dust.
<br><br>
It was at that moment that the one from the Lofty Mountain race started regretting his actions.
<br><br>
He knew where these swords had come from since he was the one who summoned those two demon women here.
<br><br>
In his defense though, he never knew they would do such a thing! He never thought that those women would be cruel enough and regard his life as expendable.
<br><br>
The man tried his best to avoid this rain of flaming swords but, in the end, failed to cheat death. He was pierced through by three golden swords and burnt to a crisp much like the Celestial Wolf member.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the man from the Moon Spirit race was clever and used his Other Shore Token to create a transparent light film around him.
<br><br>
When the flaming swords penetrated through the light film, they would slow down, allowing him to easily avoid any that came near him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3385 Fighting Metallic clangs filled the air as the sharp, golden swords continued to fall down and erode the rocks above the cave.
<br><br>
There was a dull crack when the rocks had been eroded to a certain extent.
<br><br>
Eventually, the whole rock layer collapsed to the bottom of the cave and covered its surface.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
In turn, Zen, Sally, Chaim, and the Moon Spirit man all retreated to the edge of the cave to avoid being hit by the collapsed rocks.
<br><br>
If they did get hit by the rocks, they wouldn't get hurt because of their strengths. If they exposed themselves, however, it would not end well.
<br><br>
After all the rocks of the cave collapsed, a big pit was formed.
<br><br>
Lesly and Brylee slowly descended.
<br><br>
Their wings, which contained the divine flames of the Sun Crow race, flapped and fanned the fire around them. Hot air surged around the pit.
<br><br>
"What... are you doing?" the man from the Moon Spirit race said in a shaky voice.
<br><br>
He instinctively leaned to the side, his face full of fear.
<br><br>
Although he had avoided the disaster just now, the deaths of the two men from the Celestial Wolf race and the Lofty Mountain race still shook him to the core.
<br><br>
Then again, the fights in the Chaotic Source World had always been quite cruel.
<br><br>
Tens of thousands of warriors fought for the two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits. If they continued to kill each other mercilessly, there would be less and less competitors in no time.
<br><br>
According to the records, members of the same race who entered the Chaotic Source World would gather together as soon as possible and kill everyone else from the other races.
<br><br>
The majority of the people who survived were the members and disciples of the super forces. Meanwhile, many elites who were trained by many small races usually died from unknown reasons.
<br><br>
Although it was bloody and chaotic, it was a great test for the small races' members to succeed in undergoing the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. The risks they had to take were far greater than those of the members of the super forces.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the Moon Spirit warrior was eager to get the Chaotic Source Spirits. Now, his hopes were crushed when he ended up in such a terrible situation.
<br><br>
Lesly glanced at him and didn't show any changes in her expression.
<br><br>
In her eyes, the man from the Moon Spirit race would become a hindrance to her if he stayed there… She gently pointed to the Moon Spirit warrior with her index finger. A golden strip of light burst from her fingertip and transformed into numerous golden fire birds, which charged straight towards the man.
<br><br>
The man from the Moon Spirit race quickly turned around and jumped up when he saw the birds flying towards him, in an attempt to escape.
<br><br>
As the golden fire birds neared further, he patted his head. Then a layer of light film spread out and shrouded the golden fire birds. The birds instantly slowed down.
<br><br>
"Little tricks..." Lesly whispered with disdain.
<br><br>
Then, she tugged her finger and lightly pulled the Moon Spirit warrior.
<br><br>
It was as if an invisible thin thread had wrapped around the Moon Spirit warrior's legs and dragged him down, until he landed in the group of fire birds.
<br><br>
"Ahhhhhhhhh!"
<br><br>
The scream of the man from the Moon Spirit race only lasted for about two seconds until it suddenly stopped. Eventually, he was burned to death.
<br><br>
As soon as he died, Lesly turned around and fixed her eyes on Zen.
<br><br>
To be honest, the calmness of Zen's face displeased her a little.
<br><br>
After all, the more composed the opponent was, the more difficult they would be to deal with. "You are not nervous, right?" Lesly asked.
<br><br>
There was a short silence while Zen observed the two demon women, and then he said with a smile, "I have fought Elizabeth from the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
You are just two demon women from the Divine Lair as well, so why should I be flustered?"
<br><br>
Upon hearing his words, Brylee's and Lesly's lips curved down to a frown.
<br><br>
Even the talents of the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race would still feel a lot of pressure when faced against them. Since there were two of them right now, surely they would get the upper hand during the fight.
<br><br>
Although Zen seemed to be a calm and prudent man, he was just as arrogant as the young man in black.
<br><br>
"You are an arrogant man," Brylee coldly said.
<br><br>
"The one you fought before was only Master Elizabeth's Illusory Projection.
<br><br>
She did not use all of her strength," Lesly calmly added.
<br><br>
Still, Zen's expression didn't change at all. In fact, he simply stared at the two demon women with a sinister grin on his face.
<br><br>
The state of mind was very important during a life and death battle.
<br><br>
Now that Lesly had started to give an explanation about that issue, it meant that she was having difficulty with their situation.
<br><br>
In addition, it was actually true that there had been a huge uproar in the Divine Lair when Elizabeth's Illusory Projection failed to catch Zen.
<br><br>
Zen was able to escape from Elizabeth for two reasons: first, he wasn't afraid of the divine flames of the Sun Crow race; second, he had relied on the Latent Theurgies of the Nine Li race. The latter was crucial, because without it, he wouldn't have been able to hold on until Athemar's arrival.
<br><br>
Of course, at that time Zen had no idea that Athemar was observing him in secret.
<br><br>
Anyway, it was a fact that Zen, who had just reached the Other Shore Realm, was able to escape from Elizabeth.
<br><br>
Zen's intense stare towards Lesly and Brylee made the two demon women uneasy.
<br><br>
Since they couldn't win an advantage when it came to their argument, they didn't want to say anything else.
<br><br>
"Brylee, kill the two disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace. I will deal with this guy," Lesly said decisively.
<br><br>
When Sally and Chaim, who both stood at the corner, heard her words, they couldn't help but feel a bit nervous.
<br><br>
If Chaim was in his best condition, he wouldn't be afraid of the demon women of the Divine Lair. He could even escape if he ever fought against Brylee and Lesly.
<br><br>
However, he hadn't completely recovered after he used the Living Puppet Chains. Thus, he might not be able to resist them.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Sally looked even more nervous now. She gently cupped her hands, and the Iridescent Stone appeared in her palms.
<br><br>
If there was no way to dodge, she could only put up a desperate fight.
<br><br>
"Splash!"
<br><br>
With a wave of heat, Brylee rushed towards Sally and Chaim.
<br><br>
Sally looked very weak, and she was always the one the other members of the Nine Li race had to protect.
<br><br>
At that moment, however, she surprised everyone with her performance, which was even beyond Zen's and Chaim's imaginations.
<br><br>
After she gently tossed the Iridescent Stone, it drew a colorful beam of light and shot towards Brylee.
<br><br>
Brylee's eyes were filled with contempt when she saw that the Iridescent Stone had flown towards her. In return, her wings fluttered and cast a shadow in the air. The Iridescent Stone passed through the shadow, but it was impossible for it to touch Brylee.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Then, Brylee gently flipped her hand and a golden spear appeared. The condensed golden flame at the tip of the spear burned so hot that it could almost melt everything.
<br><br>
Just as Brylee rushed downwards, she heard an unmistakable roar.
<br><br>
Her heart pounded in her ribcage. That seemingly powerful sound frightened her.
<br><br>
She instinctively lowered her head, but the Iridescent Stone, which had just returned, passed by and smashed her ear, making it bleed! "Swish!"
<br><br>
"Click!"
<br><br>
The Iridescent Stone finally flew back to the hand of Sally, who looked at Brylee with a serious face. "Don't get closer to me... Otherwise I will attack you!" she warned.
<br><br>
Chaim had witnessed the whole thing from a distance. He looked at Sally and said encouragingly, "Well done, Sally!"
<br><br>
The Iridescent Stone seemed to be quite an ordinary descending type of Other Shore Token, but it was mysterious and useful, with many functions.
<br><br>
The Iridescent Stone was extremely flexible and was under Sally's complete control. Whenever she threw it away, it always returned to her.
<br><br>
Furthermore, she could even activate the Other Shore Power within the stone, which could enhance its speed and release more power.
<br><br>
Once the stone was triggered, its impact force could easily reach one thousand divine megatons. The only catch was that she could only activate the Iridescent Stone for three times within a day. After that, the Iridescent Stone could not be used again.
<br><br>
Before, Brylee had noticed that Chaim looked weak and Sally didn't seem powerful at all, so she had always looked down on them.
<br><br>
Her mindset caused her to treat them with such contempt and because she was too confident, she hadn't been careful enough, which almost cost her life.
<br><br>
Had the power of one thousand megatons landed squarely on her head, it would have surely smashed it into pieces.
<br><br>
Chapter 3386 The Heavenly South Bow Brylee was furious. Her eyes were burning with anger and humiliation at her mistake.
<br><br>
A spurt of killing intent gushed out from her body. She was about to rush to Sally when the golden flame behind her exploded with a deafening bang.
<br><br>
She quickly turned around. Panic appeared on her face, Lesly was sent flying onto the wall of the cave. Zen floated in the air, surrounded by the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. The fire that burned around him left him completely unharmed.
<br><br>
"He's very powerful," Brylee murmured to herself.
<br><br>
She and Lesly would not make the mistake of underestimating Zen.
<br><br>
After the two of them had broken into the cave, Lesly went to attack Zen while Brylee fought the others.
<br><br>
They had thought that after Brylee killed Sally and Chaim, they would surely be able to defeat Zen.
<br><br>
But their plan fell apart immediately, because Lesly couldn't withstand even a single blow from Zen.
<br><br>
Lesly was stuck in a big rock, and her eyes, usually so bright and charming, were now dark with fear and anger. Under the burning of her wings, the rock slowly melted into scorching lava.
<br><br>
"I don't care if you attack me, but you will pay if you try to kill my friends,"
<br><br>
Zen said coldly, glaring at the two demon women.
<br><br>
He had wanted to get a sense of their intentions before hitting them with any strong attacks, but one of them had gone directly for Sally and Chaim.
<br><br>
As a result, Zen was forced to immediately deal a heavy blow against Lesly.
<br><br>
Zen moved forward. The rock beneath his feet cracked as he rushed at Brylee with lightning speed.
<br><br>
Lesly shouted out a warning, "Brylee! Run! He is not afraid of fire!" Lesly had just suffered a crippling loss and she feared Brylee was about to meet the same fate.
<br><br>
Brylee's divine flames were quite fierce, and far strong than those of the other demon women of the Sun Crow race. At Lesly's words, she withdrew the divine flames she had been about to blast at Zen. Instead, she spread her wings and flew upwards.
<br><br>
By then, Lesly had freed herself from the rock. She had not been seriously hurt by Zen's punch, and she unfurled her wings and rose in the air. She called to Brylee, "Let's go! We must retreat for now!"
<br><br>
The divine flame was the most powerful weapon of the Sun Crow race, and they had expected to use it to defeat Zen. But since Zen was not at all threatened by the flames, they had no chance of winning this battle, so they had to retreat and figure out a different plan.
<br><br>
"You're already here! Why don't you stay a bit longer?" Zen taunted.
<br><br>
He accelerated as he flew into the air, chasing Brylee.
<br><br>
Zen didn't have the flexibility and agility of the Sun Crow race in flight, but he was able to gain enough momentum to outpace Brylee's speed. Even though she was flying away as rapidly as she could, Zen drew closer and closer to her.
<br><br>
"Get down!"
<br><br>
Lesly, in flight behind Zen, raised her eyebrows and took out an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"Go!"
<br><br>
She waved two fingers in the air. Shining awls appeared midair and flew towards Zen.
<br><br>
She didn't expect to kill Zen, but she needed to force him to slow down before he could catch Brylee.
<br><br>
The shining awls had a very strong penetrating power. If Zen failed to dodge them, they would pierce his skin and leave bleeding injuries on his body.
<br><br>
Zen snorted.
<br><br>
He summoned the Shade Stone liquid to protect his back.
<br><br>
There was a series of clanging sounds as the awls hit Zen one after another.
<br><br>
The shining awls could penetrate almost everything, but they couldn't penetrate Zen's back. Lesly's mouth dropped open in shock. Brylee, glancing behind her, saw what happened and was also stunned.
<br><br>
Brylee gritted her teeth. She spread her wings and pushed forward with all her strength, trying to fly faster. But her struggle was in vain. Since Lesly's attack had not slowed him down even a little, Zen flew closer to Brylee. He was an arm's length from catching her.
<br><br>
At that moment, however, the black smog of the Chaotic Source World started to surge around them again.
<br><br>
The arrival of the black smog was an enormous advantage for Brylee and Lesly. As members of the Sun Crow race, they had a much better sense of wind than most other creatures. As soon as they sensed a hurricane coming, they realized with excitement that there was a way to escape Zen.
<br><br>
The winds swirled and surged more and more strongly around them.
<br><br>
Zen was just about to grasp Brylee when an irresistible force swept over them.
<br><br>
The hurricane separated Zen from Brylee. Zen tried to stick to his course, but he soon lost his sense of direction in the black smog.
<br><br>
"Ah! Zen is getting blown away!"
<br><br>
Sally and Chaim, still at the bottom of the cave, crouched down as the hurricane burst into the hole. The pit protected them. The hurricane couldn't sweep them away.
<br><br>
Zen was unable to resist the hurricane, but the two demon women remained steady.
<br><br>
Brylee and Lesly spread their wings and rode the hurricane, quickly putting some distance between themselves and Zen. He couldn't chase after them anymore.
<br><br>
"The hurricane came at just the right time," said Lesly, sounding relieved.
<br><br>
"What should we do now?" Brylee asked, in a more subdued tone. She was also happy at their escape but still felt a lingering tension at how close she had come to being captured by Zen.
<br><br>
"He is trapped in the strong wind. Let the hurricane take his life!"
<br><br>
The two women angled their wings, turning in midair to follow Zen as he was tossed and turned by the hurricane. They made sure to stay a safe distance away from him.
<br><br>
A huge transparent crystal appeared above Lesly's head. In an instant, long spears made of heavenly crystals materialized from it.
<br><br>
They had no trouble resisting the hurricane.
<br><br>
Indeed, their power was multiplied by the hurricane as the pointed tips shot straight towards Zen.
<br><br>
As the two women had observed, Zen was finding it difficult to adjust his position in the hurricane. Even if he could, his range of movement was limited. He grimaced and watched the spears shooting towards him.
<br><br>
A clanging sound could be heard over the sound of the wind, as the spears hit Zen's body and cracked into pieces upon impact. He used the Shade Stone liquid to protect himself, as he had no choice but to take the full force of the attack.
<br><br>
A vicious smile appeared on Lesly's face. "I wonder how long you can hold on!" she called out to him.
<br><br>
She believed that Zen wouldn't be able to resist her heavenly crystal bombardment for too long.
<br><br>
After all, he hadn't even reached the Chaotic Source Realm. And indeed, even if he had, he should have a limit. Beyond this limit, he would run out of strength to keep resisting the attack. Not even Zen could withstand the power of the heavenly crystals forever! However, unbeknownst to Lesly and Brylee, Zen had the Shade Stone liquid that was different from the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
Unlike the Chaotic Source Spirit, the Shade Stone couldn't absorb power, and it wouldn't get tired.
<br><br>
As long as the Shade Stone liquid was on Zen's back, it didn't matter how many times he was hit by the heavenly crystal spears. They wouldn't be able to pierce through his body.
<br><br>
However, each time a heavenly crystal spear shattered into pieces on Zen's back, he felt the force of the blow, like a powerful punch. It made his body tremble, and his vital energy quivered violently.
<br><br>
Moreover, Zen didn't have enough Shade Stone liquid to protect any other part of his body except his back. He was managing to angle himself so that the spears always hit his back, but eventually he would get tired and a heavenly crystal spear might pierce through his limb, or through the front of his torso. He had to figure out a way to counterattack.
<br><br>
Brylee, also flying nearby, waved her hand and brought out an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
She held a long, graceful bow that shone with a soft blue light. She raised the weapon and plucked at the bowstring, and a watery blue arrow appeared.
<br><br>
"Heavenly South Bow!"
<br><br>
This long bow was a sixth-grade Other Shore Token. It was the sacred item of a ruling civilization. The bow was the only one of its kind.
<br><br>
The Heavenly South Bow was well-known on the Other Shore. It had been used by the last head of the Divine Lair and cherished by its people for a long time. When Brylee came along, the last head of the Divine Lair gave her the bow. Many had coveted the Heavenly South Bow, but she was the one chosen to wield this Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"To the south!"
<br><br>
Brylee released the bowstring. A sharp, penetrating blue light shot out from the Heavenly South Bow.
<br><br>
As soon as the blue light burst out, Zen felt its sharpness. His face darkened.
<br><br>
Chapter 3387 An Area Insulated From Wind Zen gritted his teeth. He knew the Shade Stone liquid wasn't indestructible, but at this point, he had no choice.
<br><br>
The Shade Stone liquid covered his back, like a thin sheet. If he was attacked with something that had high penetrating strength, it was possible it'd be able to pierce through it.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a blue light shot at Zen. Eyes narrowed, he desperately searched for a solution.
<br><br>
Because he was trapped in the hurricane, his control over his bodily movement was extremely limited. At this rate, he wouldn't be able to dodge the blue light at all.
<br><br>
"Shade Stone liquid, condensing!"
<br><br>
Since he couldn't avoid the light, his last resort was to face it head-on.
<br><br>
The Shade Stone liquid, which was scattered all over his back, suddenly gathered in one spot on his back.
<br><br>
After the Shade Stone liquid condensed, its defensive power doubled as well.
<br><br>
'She's targeting the center of my back!' Zen gathered the condensed Shade Stone liquid at the center of his back.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
As soon as the arrow hit him, Zen was enveloped in a dazzling blue light.
<br><br>
Both Lesly and Brylee smiled. In their eyes, Zen wasn't strong enough to withstand an attack from the Heavenly South Bow.
<br><br>
However, to their surprise, after the blue light dissipated, Zen was still alive! They froze in shock. Exchanging stunned glances, they were at a loss at what to do next.
<br><br>
"W-what?!"
<br><br>
Brylee stuttered, unable to conceal her shock.
<br><br>
The Heavenly South Bow was her most powerful weapon.
<br><br>
Moreover, it cost a lot just to use such a powerful Other Shore Token. If they had known any other way to deal with Zen, Brylee wouldn't have considered using the Heavenly South Bow.
<br><br>
And yet, Zen had managed to survive Brylee's supposed trump card.
<br><br>
"Ahem!"
<br><br>
Zen coughed. With a frown, he spat out the golden blood.
<br><br>
The blood dispersed in the whirling air quickly.
<br><br>
In the end, the condensed Shade Stone liquid did save his life, but it didn't spare him from some internal injuries.
<br><br>
Fortunately, his injuries weren't too bad. He knew he'd recover in no time.
<br><br>
However, the hurricane kept on blowing, rendering him helpless. After all, the two women still targeted him. If they shot a few more arrows at him, he'd be done for.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Lesly and Brylee also considered their options.
<br><br>
"How could the Oneness Sky Palace have such a superhuman warrior?"
<br><br>
Lesly muttered in a low voice.
<br><br>
After Brylee recovered from the initial shock, she clenched her fists. This only made her more determined to take Zen down. Gripping the Heavenly South Bow, she notched another blue arrow onto the bowstring. "You are able to block the first arrow," she said quietly, "but can you block the second?"
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race were enemies now.
<br><br>
Moreover, Elizabeth loathed Zen.
<br><br>
If he was allowed to live and grew stronger with time, he would inevitably become a huge threat to the Sun Crow race. Bearing this in mind, Brylee was determined to spare him no mercy.
<br><br>
Zen, rolling in the hurricane, quickly wiped the blood from his mouth and laughed. "Go on and try. I also want to know how many arrows I can resist!"
<br><br>
Zen was confident in the Shade Stone liquid; he could move it to whichever part of his body was going to be hit by Brylee's arrows. At worst, he would only be injured by the vibrating impact of the blows, but he knew the arrow wouldn't pierce through the Shade Stone liquid.
<br><br>
As soon as the hurricane stopped, Zen would finally be able to strike back.
<br><br>
Seeing the confident look on Zen's face, Brylee couldn't help but feel a little anxious. What if he could really resist all of the arrows? "Brylee," Lesly suddenly said, "shoot two arrows at the same time. Aim for his head with one, and his cinnabar field with the other."
<br><br>
Although Lesly did not understand how the Shade Stone liquid worked, she could tell that Zen would be able to block the second arrow. She also knew that once the hurricane died down after five minutes, Zen would have the upper hand, and they'd be forced to retreat.
<br><br>
They needed to be smart about this.
<br><br>
Brylee nodded. With a tap of her finger, another blue arrow appeared on the bowstring.
<br><br>
Taking a deep breath, she took steady aim at Zen.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a man from the Separate Abyss race got caught in the hurricane and whirled into the sky. To his surprise, he suddenly saw the tense battle between Zen and the two women.
<br><br>
Naturally, he never expected such a fight would take place inside this damned hurricane.
<br><br>
Zen frowned as he saw Brylee fitting two arrows onto the bowstring.
<br><br>
He knew that it'd be difficult to disperse the Shade Stone liquid to two different parts of his body, and that its defensive properties would definitely weaken in this way.
<br><br>
"I see the fear in your eyes," Lesly said smugly as she noticed Zen's expression.
<br><br>
Zen just sighed. "Well, even a lion will use all its strength to prey on a rabbit. I guess I shouldn't have gone easy on you..."
<br><br>
"A lion fights a rabbit?" Lesly echoed. "Do you think you are a lion?"
<br><br>
Exhaling slowly, Brylee steadily aimed the two arrows at Zen's head and belly. She couldn't possibly miss the target at so short a distance.
<br><br>
Only the demon women of the Divine Lair and the creatures of a few races which could fly would be able to battle in a hurricane. Even if Zen had any tricks up his sleeve, he wouldn't be able to pose a threat to them as long as the hurricane whirled on. Hence, Lesly and Brylee grew complacent.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Brylee released the arrows and two blue lights shot towards Zen. Just as suddenly, a diamond-shaped thorny ball appeared above Zen's head.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power of the diamond-shaped thorny ball was not powerful, but a cyan feather began to emerge from it.
<br><br>
The cyan feather looked so dainty and lifelike! Two huge cyan wings appeared behind Zen as soon as the cyan feather emerged from the thorny ball.
<br><br>
The shadow of the massive wings reached over a thousand feet, flapping formidably in the air.
<br><br>
In an instant, Brylee and Lesly knew they were absolutely no match for this, as Zen seemed to become extremely powerful at this moment.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race was the most powerful among the races which could fly in the air. Few things in the world could scare them. But now, they trembled at the sight of Zen.
<br><br>
The two beams of arrow radiance from the Heavenly South Bow were still shooting towards him, but Zen twisted his body and rose with the wind, easily dodging the two blue rays. Suddenly, he froze in the air, and locked eyes with the two demon women.
<br><br>
Indeed, Brylee and Lesly could fly in this hurricane, but they could only fly downwind. They couldn't even stop in the wind. After all, the hurricane's power reached thousands of divine megatons! As Zen suddenly stopped in the air, the two demon women, who were flying with the wind, were headed straight at him with incredible speed.
<br><br>
There was no time for them to react or even try to change their direction. As they closed in on Zen, the two women's fear-filled eyes were reflected in Zen's long sword light.
<br><br>
Zen slowly raised his sword, and swung it to the left and then right in a flash.
<br><br>
The two demon women passed by Zen, as though nothing happened.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, Lesly and Brylee had flown past Zen around three miles. They flew with the wind, motionless, shock still seared on their faces.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
On each of their delicate necks, a line of blood appeared, and then slowly, their heads were peeled off their bodies.
<br><br>
As the hurricane continued to blow, their heads flew farther and farther away from their beheaded bodies, fear still engraved in their lifeless eyes.
<br><br>
"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."
<br><br>
The hurricane still blew like mad, as though unaffected by the fact that a gruesome battle had just taken place.
<br><br>
Zen stood still, letting the powerful hurricane blow towards him.
<br><br>
But now, Zen's body was covered with an invisible thin film. As the hurricane blew black smog to him, it just whizzed past, with Zen remaining unaffected.
<br><br>
Chapter 3388 Flying Against The Hurricane At the gate of the Chaotic Source World, Elizabeth sat in a corner, meditating with eyes closed. After she sensed Lesly's and Brylee's deaths, her eyes shot open.
<br><br>
In her fury, she emanated wave after wave of malicious aura. Everyone around her could tangibly feel her anger.
<br><br>
Beside her sat three other demon women. They too were shocked when they found out about the deaths of their kin.
<br><br>
"Lesly and Brylee were killed at the same time?"
<br><br>
"That's impossible!"
<br><br>
"How could that happen?"
<br><br>
The demon women communicated with each other using life vitality, their faces full of disbelief.
<br><br>
Elizabeth's expression darkened.
<br><br>
The demon women from the Divine Lair were connected by blood. No matter how far they were from each other, they could sense each other's deaths.
<br><br>
They could also sense it if Elvinia and Flamine died.
<br><br>
"What's wrong, Elizabeth?" a leader of the Divine Farmer race asked through his life vitality.
<br><br>
"Lesly and Brylee are dead," Elizabeth answered bluntly.
<br><br>
"No way!" the leader exclaimed in astonishment.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Bearing race and the New Moon race frowned collectively.
<br><br>
"As of right now, no one has entered the core area. The chances of them dying outside are slim," the old man from the Bearing race said.
<br><br>
When everyone had entered the Chaotic Source World, a huge magic array appeared in front of the leaders. The array produced a huge mirror which reflected the core area of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
However, anything outside the core area wasn't covered; they couldn't monitor what was happening outside.
<br><br>
According to the old man from the Bearing race, no one had stepped into the core area yet. That meant everyone was wandering around the periphery of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
The periphery was vast. It was unlikely the two demon women would encounter strong enemies there. That was why everyone was shocked at their sudden deaths.
<br><br>
Since they got killed at the same time, the only possibility was that they encountered a strong opponent.
<br><br>
Elizabeth did not respond to the leader of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Instead, she spread out her hands before her. Golden lines flowed along her arms, like veins pumping gold.
<br><br>
As the head of the Divine Lair, Elizabeth was more powerful than her clansmen. Closing her eyes, she tried seeing into the scene that Lesly and Brylee saw before they died.
<br><br>
Opening her eyes, she found herself flying haphazardly through the thick black smog, unable to slow down. The next thing she knew was a long sword slashing through her neck.
<br><br>
"It's him!" she suddenly cried, returning to her physical body.
<br><br>
"It's that damned man! How could he fight in the midst of a hurricane?"
<br><br>
Elizabeth turned to glare at Athemar.
<br><br>
It seemed as though she was challenging Athemar to a fight.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace, like Athemar and Winchell, exchanged puzzled glances when they saw Elizabeth glaring at them.
<br><br>
But they were not afraid of her.
<br><br>
Winchell's eyes met Elizabeth's gaze. Turning to Athemar, he asked in a confused tone, "What's wrong with Elizabeth? Why is she looking at us like that?"
<br><br>
"The members of the Sun Crow race are connected to each other by blood,"
<br><br>
Athemar said carefully. "I guess some important figures have died."
<br><br>
Athemar was a smart man. He figured it out in an instant.
<br><br>
"Were they killed by the disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?" Winchell asked, beaming at the possibility.
<br><br>
"I think so." Athemar nodded.
<br><br>
They had predicted that the other races would target the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
It seemed that the members of the Sun Crow race had made their move, but ultimately failed against a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Once he was done speaking, Athemar turned back to watch the mirror.
<br><br>
It was only a matter of time before everyone entered the core area of the Chaotic Source World. When this time came, there would be many bloody battles.
<br><br>
Athemar wasn't worried about the Bearing race, or even the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
What he was worried about was the young man in black who came from the Black Ship. The man was extremely hostile to Zen. No doubt there would be a fierce battle.
<br><br>
Some nonhuman races surged forward, forced by the hurricane.
<br><br>
When they passed by Zen, who calmly stood still amidst the whirling wind, their eyes popped open in shock.
<br><br>
They all wondered in awe how he was able to resist this damned hurricane.
<br><br>
"A single feather from the Wing King sheltered me from the hurricane with thousands of divine megatons of force. I wonder how powerful the Wing King truly is." Even Zen was surprised.
<br><br>
Just now, he faced two powerful demon women in the hurricane.
<br><br>
But the moment he pulled out the feather, he had defeated them in one swift blow. Moreover, the strong wind didn't faze him at all.
<br><br>
This Other Shore Token was definitely much more powerful than any other bodily movement skill or theurgy. No wonder the Wing King was considered the strongest master of a ruling force.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Zen flew against the direction of the wind, without slowing down. He headed for the collapsed cave.
<br><br>
Initially, he had planned to look for the space rings of Lesly and Brylee.
<br><br>
They must have a lot of magic weapons. Even though they might not work for him, he could give them to Sally and the members of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
However, when Lesly and Brylee were killed, their bodies were blown away by the hurricane. It was quite difficult to find them. Finally, Zen retreated to look for the others.
<br><br>
Inside the collapsed cave, Sally and Chaim were hiding in a narrow space, just big enough to shield them from the whirling wind.
<br><br>
Just then, the full force of the hurricane surged forward on top of the cave, slicing through some stones like a knife. Although the two were protected, they crouched uncomfortably.
<br><br>
Sally had been worried about Zen and constantly tried to locate him through the soul mark.
<br><br>
At first, Zen had quickly flown away. But at some point, he suddenly stopped.
<br><br>
Sally froze for a moment. She thought the hurricane had stopped, but when she looked up, she found that it was still whistling. It had only been a few minutes. The hurricane wouldn't stop so soon.
<br><br>
'I wonder if Zen rushes into another cave to take shelter, ' Sally pondered worriedly.
<br><br>
Later, Zen was actually flying towards them amidst the hurricane.
<br><br>
Feeling the soul mark vibrate, Sally covered her mouth in shock.
<br><br>
"Sally, what's wrong with you?" Chaim, noticing her strange behavior, looked at her curiously.
<br><br>
"It's Zen!" she exclaimed, her face full of disbelief. "He's coming to us!"
<br><br>
"Impossible." Chaim shook his head. "Unless he's flying in the underground..."
<br><br>
"Absolutely not! How could he move so quickly in the underground? He must be flying in the sky!" Sally said with certainty.
<br><br>
"Don't be silly, Sally. No one can resist this hurricane. Even the omnipotent Zen can't do it," said Chaim with a smile.
<br><br>
The warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm possessed thousands of divine megatons of force, so they could resist the hurricane. Even though Chaim didn't believe Sally, her expression was so resolute that even he faltered.
<br><br>
"He'll be here soon," Sally said confidently. She knew that Zen was closing in on them.
<br><br>
In no time, they saw Zen freely flying in the hurricane like a lithe bird in the springtime. Steadily, he landed in the middle of the cave.
<br><br>
Chapter 3389 Stench Of Blood Chaim stared right at Zen, unable to utter a single word.
<br><br>
Zen really did fly in the air, against the hurricane! The power of the hurricane was too strong, there was no way Zen could have survived even with the protection of the cave. Chaim knew that if the roles were reversed, he would have been swept away already.
<br><br>
But from the looks of it, Zen didn't seem to be affected at all.
<br><br>
Sally, on the other hand, was hardly surprised. All along, she believed that Zen flew against the hurricane. She didn't even bother thinking about how Zen did it; what mattered was that he was successful.
<br><br>
After moments of wondering, Chaim decided it was best to just ask Zen.
<br><br>
"Zen... How in the world did you make it?"
<br><br>
"I used an Other Shore Token," Zen replied frankly.
<br><br>
"An Other Shore Token..."
<br><br>
Chaim was in awe. What kind of Other Shore Token could be so powerful as to resist a full-blown hurricane like that? Even the sixth-grade Other Shore Tokens at Stage Thirteen of the Lust World still wouldn't be able to demonstrate such resilience.
<br><br>
Though Chaim still had many questions, he chose not to ask anything more.
<br><br>
Usually, Other Shore Realm warriors made sure to keep their Other Shore Tokens in secret. Although there were many people in the Source World who had classified the Other Shore Tokens, many Other Shore Tokens were still mysteries and unknown to people other than the holder. Once those Other Shore Tokens were used, they would have miraculous effects.
<br><br>
"Zen," Sally asked as her eyes widened, "where are the two demon women? Were they blown away by the hurricane?"
<br><br>
"No," Zen shook his head, "I killed them."
<br><br>
The casual tone in Zen's voice made Chaim's eyelids twitch ever so slightly.
<br><br>
By the fact that Zen's strength was not inferior to that of the two demon women and he could fly unharmed in the hurricane, they probably had had nothing against him.
<br><br>
"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Eventually, the hurricane gradually subsided and disappeared into the air.
<br><br>
Chaim and Sally got out of the crack.
<br><br>
They patted down the bodies of the several nonhuman creatures and checked their belongings. Afterwards, the treasures in their space rings were divided between the two.
<br><br>
Sally had taken a large portion of the treasures. Though she had no personal interest in the weapons, she figured that her brothers might need them considering that their weapons were too common. Zen, being the all mighty and gracious, didn't take anything.
<br><br>
Once all the treasures were settled, Zen took out the Chaotic Source Spirits and began to distribute them.
<br><br>
Originally, he had planned to give a number of Chaotic Source Spirits to the several warriors of the other three races. Since they ended up dead, Zen was able to keep that part for himself.
<br><br>
In the end, Zen kept over 160 Chaotic Source Spirits himself, and gave seventy to Sally and Chaim respectively.
<br><br>
"By the looks of it, even if we don't enter the core area of the Chaotic Source World, we can gather enough Chaotic Source Spirits!" Chaim pointed out.
<br><br>
Only very few Chaotic Source Spirits can be found in the periphery of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Usually, smashing a mountain into pieces could generate only one or two Chaotic Source Spirits, much like Zen's first experience. He destroyed many rocks but only found one, and sometimes, he found nothing at all.
<br><br>
They got lucky with the special cave. How the queen ant swallowed so many Chaotic Source Spirits was a mystery. However, they couldn't help but be grateful because it became easier for them to collect the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
"This amount of Chaotic Source Spirits is still not enough," continued Chaim "We should still seek them out in the inner part of Chaotic Source World," he suggested.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
With the help of the soul marks, he found that Elvinia, Dorothy, and the members of the Nine Li race were sent far away due to the hurricane. But on the whole, they were all headed towards the center of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Both Dorothy and Elvinia attempted to get closer to Zen, but the hurricane would arrive and take them away every 5 minutes. It was too difficult for any of them to approach Zen as it would purely depend on luck, so they eventually gave up.
<br><br>
All they knew was that the hurricane whirled from the south to the north, so Zen, Sally and Chaim flew towards the western area.
<br><br>
After the three of them flew in the air for about five minutes, Chaim looked at the black smog and said, "The hurricane is coming back soon."
<br><br>
Though the hurricane came without any warning, it was always, always punctual.
<br><br>
Among the three, Zen did not fear the hurricane. It was Chaim and Sally who had to secure a place to hide.
<br><br>
Deep in thought, Zen scanned his surroundings and found nothing that could be of use. Without warning, he rushed down, jumped in the air, and began smashing into the ground.
<br><br>
Bang! Just like that, Zen had created a cave that was ten-foot deep into the ground.
<br><br>
He'd been saving this plan for a time when he'd need it. Before, Zen would just go with the wind because he just entered the Chaotic Source World and was clueless with where to go. Now that they needed a place of protection, he felt that it was the best time to execute his plan.
<br><br>
The trio hid safely in the cave for five minutes. After the hurricane had settled, they climbed out of the makeshift cave and continued to fly west.
<br><br>
After becoming more familiar with the Chaotic Source World, the warriors realized that the chances of finding Chaotic Source Spirits in the periphery were too small. Because of this, a majority of them began to travel towards the core area.
<br><br>
Some had traveled a long way, only to be blown further back by the relentless hurricane.
<br><br>
But after experiencing this so many times, many of them were able to arrive at similar strategies. They would dig holes in the ground to avoid the hurricane, then once it stopped, they would continue their journey towards the center.
<br><br>
To the three's luck, they found four caves already dug as they traveled. This saved them time and energy as they didn't even need to dig by themselves.
<br><br>
All they had to do was get inside and hide.
<br><br>
Less than an hour of travelling had passed and another low mountain appeared beneath Zen.
<br><br>
Oddly enough, the entire mountain was scorched black, and there were sword marks slashed across its surface. Some parts were riddled with holes.
<br><br>
It seemed as if a serious battle had happened here.
<br><br>
"Let's go down and have a look," Zen suggested. He pointed at the mountain for Sally and Chaim to see.
<br><br>
Zen began to move closer towards the mountain, with Sally and Chaim right behind him.
<br><br>
Due to the hurricane, traces of the battle were close to nonexistent. If anyone had died, their bodies would have been swept away and moved elsewhere.
<br><br>
However, thanks to Zen's spiritual sense that scanned the area, he soon found a huge cave at the back of the mountain.
<br><br>
The three flew to the back of the mountain. At the entrance of the cave, they began to cough and gag as the heavy stench of blood permeated the air.
<br><br>
What they saw in the cave stunned each of them.
<br><br>
Dozens of bodies of nonhuman creatures were scattered across the ground.
<br><br>
Their corpses were dismembered and incomplete.
<br><br>
Chaim tried his best to absorb the horror before him. He looked over the scene, but something caused him to do a double take. He glanced at a body and gasped, "That's Guillermo!" he said, pointing at the body. "Guillermo from the Bright Mountain!"
<br><br>
He rushed towards the edge of the cave where a corpse was embedded in a crack on the wall. Half of his body had been damaged by explosion, but his features were still recognizable.
<br><br>
Because Chaim came from Bright Mountain, he knew Guillermo Wang very well, who was one of the best disciples. Seeing his tragic death had brought Chaim to tears.
<br><br>
"I wonder who did this," he sighed. "It's too cruel." Zen, on the other hand, had something else in mind. He observed all the corpses and noticed something about them: All the corpses' space rings were missing.
<br><br>
Whoever did this didn't only kill people, but also looted their belongings.
<br><br>
Killing all these people took outstanding strength. But on the other hand, outstanding creatures who had the ability to do this were all arrogant and they despised such an act.
<br><br>
With a motive to take space rings, this murder was out of Zen's comprehension. How could someone do this? The image of the Evil God appeared in Zen's mind. He might be the one responsible for this scene as Zen could think of no one else that had such a way of doing things.
<br><br>
As Zen continued to think, he heard a gnawing groan close by.
<br><br>
He rushed to the direction where the sound came from. Then he saw a huge body of someone from the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
The bodies of Separate Abyss race were known to be extremely tough and resilient. To Zen's surprise, the warrior who groaned was severely injured, but he was still alive.
<br><br>
Chapter 3390 Being Chased The wounds on the Separate Abyss warrior's body had stopped bleeding.
<br><br>
But there were still black snakes the length of a forefinger slithering on the wounds—these little creatures were supposedly transformed by energy.
<br><br>
When he heard Zen's footsteps approaching, his eyes widened like that of a frightened bird.
<br><br>
When Zen's image grew clearer, a look of horror filled the warrior's eyes— his body unconsciously curled up in defense.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race was a powerful force—a near-perfect race indeed.
<br><br>
They had the Abyss Spirit race to protect them on the Other Shore, after all.
<br><br>
Their power assured them of the potential to eventually become a ruling civilization among the many superpowers.
<br><br>
They looked down upon the other races with great pride and arrogance.
<br><br>
But the moment the warrior spotted Zen, fear wiped away any hint of arrogance on his face—he trembled in fear like prey that had spotted its hunter.
<br><br>
"What happened here?" Zen asked, examining the area.
<br><br>
While the warrior was sure Zen had come to take his life, the latter's question made him realize that Zen held no animosity towards him. For a moment, he paused and looked at Zen strangely before saying, "That guy… The one who calls himself the Evil God… when he entered this place, he began slaughtering everyone in his path!"
<br><br>
Indeed, such was the work of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Zen's guess was proven, then.
<br><br>
It was known that many races killed each other off in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
But with everyone scattered, most warriors were vigilant in meeting strange opponents. So long as the two races didn't carry deep grudges, they were even willing to cooperate.
<br><br>
The cave was far larger than the one Chaim and the others had first discovered. More creatures of different races were also there to explore.
<br><br>
It was impossible for an ordinary warrior to slaughter so many people at a time.
<br><br>
"The Evil God may be powerful, but he couldn't have killed so many people at once. Couldn't you have just run away?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Even with the hurricane blowing, the warriors there should have been able to flee.
<br><br>
Getting blown away by the hurricane was preferable to getting slaughtered by the Evil God, anyway.
<br><br>
But the fear grew on the warrior's face upon hearing Zen's question. "His… his Other Shore Token is strange… It's an entire world! He controlled the world, and we had no chance of escaping. If it wasn't for my Other Shore Token—the Death Feigning Beast, I would've died along with the others for sure."
<br><br>
The Death Feigning Beast was a creature from Stage Eleven of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Taming the living beings on the Other Shore was no easy task, but the Abyss Spirit race had controlled the entire Stage Eleven, so they naturally had ways to make it.
<br><br>
But the Death Feigning Beasts were not powerful on their own, and few people would fuse with such Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Back then, the Separate Abyss race had entrusted the Ear Mice to auction off the Death Feigning Beasts. Even if the price was reasonable, rarely did anyone buy them.
<br><br>
Some Other Shore Realm warriors chose to merge with a Death Feigning Beast after cultivating the second kind of Truth of Godly Way. When such a token was activated, the aura of the cultivator's inner world along with the cinnabar field was blocked—they were then left in a state of suspended animation.
<br><br>
If a spiritual sense or the like was used to detect it, no sign of life would be sensed—it would be as though the cultivator was truly dead.
<br><br>
But the Evil God had killed so many creatures of various races at a time, so he didn't even bother checking each one individually. In truth, he cared little about a few of them escaping his slaughter—all that mattered was his satisfaction.
<br><br>
And so this particular warrior of the Separate Abyss race managed to escape death.
<br><br>
But the black four-legged snakes that attached to his wounds were still torturing him to death—removing them was no easy task.
<br><br>
"A world…"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes flashed as he asked, "Chaim, have you heard of a similar Other Shore Token?"
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact was not a world. It merely represented a civilization that connected the entire Regal Jade City.
<br><br>
With the help of the Regal Jade Spirit, Zen could receive the help of the entire Regal Jade Civilization as well. Like during the hurricane, the Regal Jade Spirit pulled out a feather of the Wing King from the Civilization Artifact and helped him resist the calamity.
<br><br>
"Bloody Descent," Chaim said after a pause.
<br><br>
"What?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"The leader of our Bright Mountain has an Other Shore Token of the descending type. But instead of an item, it is a special world that descends,"
<br><br>
Chaim explained. "Such Other Shore Tokens could only be owned by the most powerful masters of the Source World. This so-called Evil God..."
<br><br>
"He's that young man in black," Zen said.
<br><br>
For a moment, Chaim stared at Zen wordlessly. The young man clad in black hadn't introduced himself yet.
<br><br>
At the thought that Zen's inner world had actually created such a terrifying existence, Chaim was utterly speechless. A freak created a freak, he thought to himself.
<br><br>
"This Evil God can only move around in the thirteen stages of the Lust World. I'm afraid it's unlikely that he'll manage to obtain such an Other Shore Token," Chaim said, shaking his head.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at the black four-legged snakes and asked the warrior, "Do you want me to help you get rid of them?"
<br><br>
"No! Don't touch them! I will refine them myself!" The warrior's face darkened at Zen's offer.
<br><br>
The four-legged snakes were highly strange creatures. The moment any one of them was removed from his body, the pain would be enough to kill the warrior. Even the strongest of the Separate Abyss race couldn't endure such torture. This warrior had done the work step by step, yet he only managed to refine four of them. There were over ten snakes still left on his body.
<br><br>
Refining each would take ages.
<br><br>
If Zen removed them all by force, the warrior would faint from the pain.
<br><br>
Zen had planned to examine the little snakes more closely, but since the warrior seemed to be on high alert around him, he backed off.
<br><br>
With a shrug, Zen left him be and followed Sally and Chaim out of the cave.
<br><br>
"Zen, this Evil God is highly talented. Haven't you noticed that when he was in your inner world?" Finally, Chaim took a chance and asked what had been plaguing his mind since they were at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Everyone had absolute control over their inner world and Zen was no exception.
<br><br>
"Of course, I was aware of it. He even plotted to kill me," Zen said with a playful smile.
<br><br>
The casual statement made Sally's and Chaim's eyes widen in astonishment.
<br><br>
The Evil God was bold indeed—they found themselves lucky to not have such a creature in their inner worlds.
<br><br>
"But he did help me stabilize my inner world quite a bit. He actually helped me a lot," Zen admitted. "I merely fulfilled my promise and released him."
<br><br>
From the start, Zen hadn't expected the Evil God's nature to remain the same. Worse, he became more reckless after leaving his inner world. It was all fate's doing, Zen believed.
<br><br>
Chaim asked no further.
<br><br>
He found it strange how powerful the Evil God was—it probably had something to do with Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
But if he continued asking, he was afraid to accidentally touch upon some of Zen's secrets that would make the latter uncomfortable.
<br><br>
Once they left the cave, the three continued travelling toward the core area.
<br><br>
After they moved forward for a while, they dug a hole to use as a shelter and waited for the hurricane to pass.
<br><br>
When it passed, they continued with their journey.
<br><br>
But when they stepped out of the hole, Sally and Zen felt something simultaneously and exchanged glances.
<br><br>
The two happened to perceive that Elvinia and Hutton were five hundred miles south of them, running fast.
<br><br>
Even when the hurricane stopped, they were moving at such a high speed.
<br><br>
Either they were chasing someone or were being chased—Zen and Sally were both inclined to believe it was the latter.
<br><br>
Chapter 3391 Dangerous Situation Hutton and Elvinia's current state was far worse than what Zen and Sally had first imagined.
<br><br>
Things were initially going great for Elvinia after entering the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
The hurricane changed things though. She had tried to resist getting swept up in order to go to Zen but it proved futile. In the end, the hurricane carried her farther and farther away from him.
<br><br>
She travelled for over a million miles, almost reaching the other end of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Left with no other choice, Elvinia was forced to explore the world alone.
<br><br>
The prospect didn't worry her that much though. As the Phoenix Palace's number one disciple, Elvinia was by no means weak.
<br><br>
Halfway through her journey, she had already encountered several dangerous situations along with a fight with a demon woman from the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Elvinia was one out of the two people that remained on top of the Bearing race's hit list so that fight with the demon woman wasn't so strange.
<br><br>
Fortunately, with her current strength, Elvinia managed to kill her pursuer with the tiniest bit of effort.
<br><br>
With that taken care of, she went on to explore the Chaotic Source World for several hours and even obtained three Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
She would've normally advanced towards the core area at that point.
<br><br>
The core area was smaller than the periphery and all members of the large races would gather there eventually, so Zen was no exception.
<br><br>
However, since she was so desperate to find him, she made a bold choice and went along with the hurricane.
<br><br>
Each time it appeared, it would carry her at least sixty to seventy thousand miles. Elvinia would activate her bodily movement skill during this time to speed up further.
<br><br>
It was by doing this that Elvinia managed to go around the entire Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Hutton went for a much more normal course of action. When the hurricane came, he dug a hole in the ground and hid.
<br><br>
He was worried about Sally and wanted to join her as soon as possible but, after knowing the fact that she was with Zen through her soul mark, he quickly relaxed. He knew she would be safe and sound under his protection.
<br><br>
Not long after that, Hutton bumped into Efrain and other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Efrain didn't really know where Hutton was from but considered him as a disciple of the Oneness Mountain since he had come with Zen.
<br><br>
This group of Oneness Sky Palace disciples Efrain led moved as a unit that gradually grew in number as more and more people joined them.
<br><br>
Most warriors preferred to travel alone so their group really stood out, in a good way though. Since they were such a large group, no one dared provoke them.
<br><br>
Even those from powerful races preferred to avoid any conflict with them.
<br><br>
Efrain's goal was clear: to head for the core area of the Chaotic Source World as fast as possible.
<br><br>
His influence in the Oneness Sky Palace wasn't on the same level as Chaim's but the other disciples followed his orders just the same. After all, Efrain was strong and powerful.
<br><br>
However, just fifty thousand miles away from their destination, their group encountered some trouble.
<br><br>
That said 'trouble' came in the form of enemy warriors coming from the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race.
<br><br>
Efrain was ranked third in the second row of these races' hit list.
<br><br>
A big fight inevitably erupted between the two forces.
<br><br>
Now, Efrain was strong but he was far outnumbered by the elites that had banded together to defeat him. He got seriously injured after getting hit by their joint attack and thought he was going to die when the hurricane suddenly appeared and carried him to safety. The other disciples following him took advantage of this and also escaped.
<br><br>
Those from the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race went underground and waited for the hurricane to subside. Only four of their elites chose to ride the hurricane and chase after Efrain.
<br><br>
When the hurricane stopped, these four elites immediately caught up with several unlucky disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Hutton was one of those unlucky disciples.
<br><br>
They wanted to kill him because he was regarded as a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace by the four elites. However, there was no way he would tell them that he was actually from the Nine Li race. Either way, they'd kill him on the spot! As he ran for his life, fate came into play and had him bump into Elvinia.
<br><br>
Noticing the four elites hot on his tail, Elvinia came forward to block them for him.
<br><br>
Thus, the two of them banded together to fight off these four pursuers.
<br><br>
Elvinia was valiant and even managed to gain the upper hand at some point.
<br><br>
However, just as their four opponents were about to tap out, another warrior of the Bearing race suddenly arrived. He was strong, far surpassing the elites in terms of power, and wielded two powerful sabers as weapons.
<br><br>
The appearance of this unexpected enemy drove Elvinia and Hutton in grave danger and they were forced to retreat. Instead of just running aimlessly, they chose the path that could most likely help them escape.
<br><br>
Elvinia had run in a circle around the world to approach Zen. The two of them moved towards each other and the distance between them was beginning to close.
<br><br>
The young man in a white robe chased after Elvinia. "I've heard about you in the Bearing race! Your strength is worth your reputation so why do you refuse to fight with me?"
<br><br>
This man was Adonis Yu, a collateral descendant of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
He was not a direct descendant but he was extremely valuable to his race owing to his extraordinary talent. In fact, he was ranked in the top three among all young members of the Bearing race and many expected great things from him.
<br><br>
As a collateral descendant, Adonis Yu put in twice the effort in order to get where he was now. He had to fight twice as hard in order to gain the same level of respect as those with higher status.
<br><br>
Killing Elvinia would no doubt raise his prestige even more! This was a golden opportunity for him and he was seizing it.
<br><br>
Adonis knew he had to work fast. The hurricane was bound to come by any time soon and if that happened, he'd have a harder time catching up with Elvinia.
<br><br>
Taking the time constraint into account, he tapped his head.
<br><br>
A small paper boat appeared above him, quickly growing in size and carrying him forward at a faster speed. He left his four companions in the dust and gradually bridged the gap between him and his two targets.
<br><br>
"I'll catch you no matter how hard you try to escape! Just give up and fight me!" he shouted after them.
<br><br>
As he got near enough, he leaped from the paper boat and raised his two sabers in front of him. Elvinia was the closest and he swung a powerful crisscross slash to her back.
<br><br>
Feeling his intent behind her, Elvinia controlled the Warrior of the Stone Hill that floated above her head and slapped down! As an Other Shore Token of the descending type, the power of the Warrior of the Stone Hill wasn't something that should be underestimated and Adonis knew this.
<br><br>
He knew that he wouldn't be able to take the blow head-on.
<br><br>
He quickly jumped back onto the paper boat and avoided Elvinia's attack.
<br><br>
He was like lightning, evading the slap and aiming another attack towards Elvinia.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Elvinia was alerted by his movements and backed off abruptly, barely dodging the slash that he had intended for her neck. She kept her head but ended up losing her balance.
<br><br>
There was no way Adonis was going to let this opportunity go! Hutton saw Elvinia in a sticky situation and tried to help her, however, the four elite members after them had already caught up and surrounded him.
<br><br>
There was no way he could lend a helping hand when he was too busy trying to defend himself.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! It was like a dance against death's sharp claws as Elvinia dodged Adonis's sabers, contorting into awkward stances due to her precarious position.
<br><br>
Her breath hitched each time the sabers were too close to her.
<br><br>
It was a game of defense and offense. Elvinia kept her guard up for a while but eventually, she showed an opening. Adonis seized this chance and hacked down.
<br><br>
If he landed this strike then he would be able to cut her in half and end this fight.
<br><br>
At such a critical moment, a beam of colorful light suddenly shot towards him and hit his blade.
<br><br>
Bang! There was a deafening crashing sound as the light hit his saber, knocking it away. That powerful force had come from the Iridescent Stone.
<br><br>
Chapter 3392 Being Overbearing As his hand clutched, Adonis grasped at the flying saber.
<br><br>
Putting an invisible force on the weapon, his grip tightened.
<br><br>
But Elvinia took advantage of the opportunity and moved away, quickly putting distance between herself and Adonis.
<br><br>
When Elvinia saw Zen, her eyes turned glassy as she practically pounced on him.
<br><br>
She thought she was done for.
<br><br>
In the Oneness Sky Palace, she hadn't suffered any setbacks. It was in the Dark Region where she had first undergone a truly terrible thing—her Memory Flame was disturbed. But after she recovered, her struggles were all in the past and she managed to calm down as she digested her memories once again.
<br><br>
Such memories were truly unforgettable.
<br><br>
After entering the Chaotic Source World, she wanted to find Zen immediately and stay with him. In all the time she had been there, she traveled across the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
But she had almost died...
<br><br>
While it wasn't Zen's fault, she couldn't help but put some blame on him in her heart.
<br><br>
Elvinia's reaction even shocked Zen.
<br><br>
But it was natural, as she was in a critical situation mere seconds ago. If he had arrived even a little later, Elvinia would have already been cut into pieces.
<br><br>
Enveloping Elvinia in an embrace, Zen patted her back gently.
<br><br>
Adonis held two sabers in his hands, wearing a nasty sneer on his face when he saw Zen. "A hero came to save the beauty just in time!" he shouted mockingly.
<br><br>
Zen pushed Elvinia behind him and uttered coldly, "This is the second time..."
<br><br>
For a moment, Adonis and the rest had no clue what he was talking about.
<br><br>
"This is the second time you people have offended me," Zen continued.
<br><br>
"First, I was previously attacked by Brylee and Lesly from the Sun Crow race. Now, you intend to challenge me as well."
<br><br>
Unable to hide it, Adonis frowned at Zen's words.
<br><br>
As the two strongest demon women among their peers in the Sun Crow race, Brylee and Lesly were highly difficult to deal with in battle.
<br><br>
If Zen had encountered them before, he should have already been dead.
<br><br>
How could he be standing before them, safe and sound? "Are you saying you have encountered Brylee and Lesly? Why would they let you off?" Adonis asked coldly. For some reason, there was a bad feeling in his chest.
<br><br>
Before entering the Chaotic Source World, both the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race took the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace as their prey. It was then that the warriors from these races not only planned to reach the Chaotic Source Realm, but also aimed to kill every single person on the hit list.
<br><br>
Every time they eliminated someone, their race gave them great incentives.
<br><br>
Killing Zen and Elvinia, in particular, would make them garner even greater rewards.
<br><br>
As for Lesly and Brylee, they would never have let Zen off so easily—not unless they were in their graves.
<br><br>
"They didn't." The corners of Zen's mouth curled into a smile. "They're already dead."
<br><br>
His answer had the elites of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race tremble as they took a step backward. Now, they were on high alert.
<br><br>
Zen managed to kill even Lesly and Brylee.
<br><br>
If that was so, he had proven himself to be a troublesome opponent.
<br><br>
But Adonis' brows shot up as he laughed. "Don't brag! How naive of you to think you can frighten us with such words!"
<br><br>
But Elvinia chimed in, "They were indeed killed... I sensed it with my own blood!"
<br><br>
The demon women of the Divine Lair could feel each other's existence. But in spite of that, Elvinia didn't take it to heart when she sensed Lesly's and Brylee's death. At this point, she had nothing but hatred for the demon women and hoped for their death more than anything.
<br><br>
People from the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race knew that the demon women of the Divine Lair had the blood of the Sun Crow race flowing through their veins, and that they had the ability to sense each other's presence. What Elvinia said confirmed Zen's words. The elite disciples of the two races took another step back.
<br><br>
When Adonis realized that those from his race behind him were backing away, fury grew on his face.
<br><br>
To do so in front of their opponents was the greatest taboo. Adonis believed that they must be too cowardly and useless.
<br><br>
"What are you so afraid of? Elvinia is in Zen's league. Are you really going to believe her words? Such fools!" Adonis turned to Zen and said coldly, "This kind of person always appears to be tough on the outside, but I bet he is a timid coward on the inside. The more he brags, the guiltier he feels.
<br><br>
He's bluffing! He just wants us to retreat!"
<br><br>
But Zen merely shook his head. "I didn't mean that."
<br><br>
"Do you want to beg for mercy, now? Haha! I'm afraid that's impossible!"
<br><br>
Adonis mocked him, laughing.
<br><br>
At the gate of the Chaotic Source World, everyone could clearly see that Fuxi had done everything to protect Zen. It wasn't a wise move for them to attack Zen outside.
<br><br>
If they wanted to avoid any big disputes or trouble, killing Zen within the Chaotic Source World was their best bet.
<br><br>
"No." Zen shook his head as a sharp light emitted from his eyes. "I'm telling you now that anyone who dares to offend me must die. I will never let a member of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Sun Crow race, or the New Moon race reach the Chaotic Source Realm!"
<br><br>
His words had Adonis and his group utterly shocked, while Sally, Chaim and Elvinia grinned in satisfaction. They never expected Zen to be so aggressive and overpowering—it certainly pleased them.
<br><br>
And it wasn't a baseless statement—he had his powerful strength supporting him. He wasn't merely being arrogant.
<br><br>
A bad feeling grew worse in Adonis' heart. His instincts told him that he had just offended someone that he shouldn't have.
<br><br>
But he couldn't just take a step back from his position. Neither his strength nor his aura allowed him to lose to Zen. But just then, the black smog above the Chaotic Source World began surging once again.
<br><br>
If the hurricane blew anytime soon, the battle would come to an end.
<br><br>
A hint of a grin flashed across Adonis' face as he said, "It seems that this battle will have to be postponed. We can then fight in the core area of the Chaotic Source World..."
<br><br>
Indeed, the wind would soon be too strong for anyone to fight.
<br><br>
When they arrived at the core area of the Chaotic Source World, Khalid and his other companions were also there. With them, it didn't matter how strong Zen was. He was no match for all of them.
<br><br>
Adonis sighed in relief.
<br><br>
The several disciples of the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race were in the same boat.
<br><br>
But suddenly, Zen turned his head and ordered, "Chaim, Elvinia, start digging a hole. Wait for me..."
<br><br>
Elvinia and Hutton were at a loss. Zen was showing no sign of giving up.
<br><br>
But the hurricane was soon approaching. What was he planning? Sally and Chaim got a clue instantly.
<br><br>
Because Zen could freely travel through the hurricane, he would gain the advantage over those idiots and kill them easily.
<br><br>
Without any more hesitation, Chaim made a huge hole in the ground.
<br><br>
"Zen," Elvinia said worriedly, "the wind is too strong. You'll be blown away again. I don't think it's a good idea..."
<br><br>
It wasn't easy for her to see him, so of course, she didn't want him to leave just like that.
<br><br>
"Don't worry," Chaim interjected. "Zen will be back." Then, he took the lead and jumped right into the hole, flashing a sinister smile at Adonis and the rest as though he was looking upon dead men.
<br><br>
Chapter 3393 Begging For Mercy Despite her confusion, Elvinia still jumped into the crater along with Chaim and the others.
<br><br>
It bewildered Adonis to see Zen remain standing outside the crater.
<br><br>
'What does he want to do? Is he planning to hunt me in the hurricane?' He started to feel nervous at the sight of Chaim's smiling face.
<br><br>
There was no way for ordinary warriors to fight in the hurricane. Why was Zen so calm? Did he have any special method? The other elites were as baffled as Adonis.
<br><br>
As the black smog surged violently, the hurricane finally rolled in again.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! As expected, Adonis and his companions were all pulled up into the air by the hurricane.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen jumped up lightly and followed the hurricane.
<br><br>
The hurricane was heading north, but Zen was moving to the west. He was not affected at all by it! Seeing that, Adonis's eyes narrowed into slits.
<br><br>
How could this be? Elites from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race felt their hearts sink.
<br><br>
This hurricane was as strong as three to four thousand divine megatons of force. It was so strong that nobody who had entered the Chaotic Source World previously could resist it.
<br><br>
They either found a cave, or made a crater in the ground to hide themselves in. Otherwise, they would be swept away by the hurricane. And there had been no exception, until now.
<br><br>
Only a few winged creatures could ride the wind, such as the Sun Crow race, but even for them, it was impossible to go against the wind! "What is he doing?"
<br><br>
"Is he chasing after us?"
<br><br>
"But he can't catch up. It's impossible!"
<br><br>
They took solace in the fact the hurricane blew at a very fast speed, pulling them several miles away in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
As Zen was not pushed by the hurricane, it would naturally slow him down, they thought.
<br><br>
But they forgot Zen could control his movements freely.
<br><br>
After he rushed westward for a distance, he was right behind them. As the feather on his head flashed a cyan light, a huge shadow of cyan wings sprouted on his back.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
Zen was now moving with the hurricane.
<br><br>
Bolstered by the hurricane, he moved at a faster speed.
<br><br>
After about ten seconds, he had already caught up to an elite from the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
The elite was stricken with horror seeing Zen lunging at him like an eagle.
<br><br>
He wanted to fight back, but it was extremely difficult for him to maintain a stable position in the wind. He spun around and shot two flying shuttles of purple light toward Zen.
<br><br>
The wind slowed the shuttles down. Zen easily dodged them with a move of his body.
<br><br>
Just as the elite moved to activate his Other Shore Token, a sword radiance flashed at him and cut him in half.
<br><br>
This scene drove other elites to despair.
<br><br>
"Let's split up!"
<br><br>
"If he catches up to us, we'll be all doomed!"
<br><br>
They all tried to flee in the same direction, expecting the hurricane's heavy winds to do the work of scattering them. If they used their bodily movement skill to move forward, they would be separated faster.
<br><br>
But Zen's explosive speed was still beyond their expectations.
<br><br>
No sooner had they made the decision to split up when Zen appeared behind them and killed the second elite disciple of the Divine Farmer race before he could even react.
<br><br>
Realizing that there was no way to escape, the remaining two elites gave up the idea. They immediately activated their Other Shore Tokens to counterattack wildly.
<br><br>
But now Zen could fight in the hurricane like a fish in water. Even if the two elites fought back with all their might, it only took Zen a few seconds to defeat them.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! With a few flashes of sword radiance, the two elites were killed. Blown by the hurricane, their blood quickly dissipated into a mist and was covered by the black smog in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Now, only Adonis was left.
<br><br>
If he had been confident enough to defeat Zen before, he would have dug a hole at the same place and just waited for the hurricane to pass before he challenged Zen.
<br><br>
However, after hearing what Zen and Elvinia said, he had already given up the idea of challenging Zen.
<br><br>
When the hurricane came, he panicked as he witnessed Zen casually flitting around in the hurricane.
<br><br>
He immediately activated his bodily movement skill and darted forward with the wind.
<br><br>
Adonis's movement technique was extremely outstanding. Although he was not as good as the winged creatures like the Sun Crow race, he was by no means inferior to them. Thus from the beginning, he left the others far behind.
<br><br>
After he had been fleeing for quite some time, he had looked back and saw that the several elite members who had followed him had been killed. Zen was now rushing toward him, picking up speed! 'How fast!' His blood ran cold.
<br><br>
But he would not be as helpless as the others. With a wave of his hands, he connected his sabers and flipped his body in the wind.
<br><br>
Splash! Serrated blades emerged around him. "Go!" he yelled. The blades, which were spinning quickly, darted out.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh Countless blades flew at Zen, containing extremely terrifying power in each.
<br><br>
An ordinary warrior at the Other Shore Realm would definitely avoid such aggressive blades.
<br><br>
That was what Adonis wanted. As long as Zen slowed down to evade, he would be able to escape! From the very beginning, he had always hunted the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace as his prey. But facing Zen, he realized that the roles had been reversed.
<br><br>
He could tell from Zen's words that he would kill them and members of the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race and the New Moon race. None of them would be spared.
<br><br>
Cling! Cling! Cling! The sharp tinkling sounds behind him broke into his thoughts. He turned around and gasped in shock at what he saw.
<br><br>
Zen even didn't block the blades with his sword. He directly resisted them with his own body and smashed through them! What was his body made of?! How could it be so strong? Even a powerful warrior of the Separate Abyss race wouldn't be able to do that! "Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Adonis spun faster and threw more blades toward Zen.
<br><br>
The attack proved futile in slowing down Zen in any way. He blocked all the blades easily.
<br><br>
Zen quickly rushed over until he was hovering above Adonis. He held his long sword and looked down at Adonis.
<br><br>
No matter how fierce the hurricane was, the hair on his head kept still. The feather of Wing King was shielding him from the wind's effects completely.
<br><br>
"Spare me! I can't die!" Adonis pleaded, shouting to be heard above the din of the hurricane.
<br><br>
He had been cornered. He had no choice now but to beg Zen for mercy.
<br><br>
He felt so ashamed and helpless.
<br><br>
If it weren't for the hurricane, he would have been able to take Zen on instead of being completely under his mercy like this.
<br><br>
"It's too late for regrets," Zen said coolly.
<br><br>
He swung his long sword, bearing down with the wind and slashing at Adonis.
<br><br>
Puff! Blood blossomed around the sword radiance as Adonis's body was swept away by the wind.
<br><br>
Zen, who was hovering at great speed, paused mysteriously. He remained floating in the wind for a few moments before turning back where he came from.
<br><br>
Chapter 3394 The Main Peak Elvinia was still worried.
<br><br>
She had never seen Zen stand upright in the wind before. What if he couldn't return? Luckily, she, Hutton, and Sally were able to check his soul mark and sense his position.
<br><br>
In the beginning, Zen had moved in sync with the wind.
<br><br>
But before long, he began to fly backward against the wind.
<br><br>
"How?" Elvinia said, covering her mouth in astonishment as she turned to Hutton and Sally while leaning against the corner of the crater.
<br><br>
But Hutton was as shocked as Elvinia.
<br><br>
Even those who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm found it hard to stand firm for long in such a heavy wind, let alone to go against it.
<br><br>
How did Zen make it? But she knew his soul mark would never lie to her. Zen was really approaching them.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid Zen has already killed them. He didn't turn around until now,"
<br><br>
said Sally, chuckling and looking at her brother and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Sally and Chaim had experienced a similar event before, so she understood Elvinia's shock pretty well.
<br><br>
It was not long before Zen floated towards them above the crater and slowly descended into it.
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyebrows rose as she took in his countenance. "What happened to those people?" she asked.
<br><br>
"I've killed them," Zen replied flatly.
<br><br>
The hurricane had been of great help to him.
<br><br>
And once the hurricane had come along, there had been no match for him.
<br><br>
It had only taken Zen less than three minutes since the hurricane showed up. He had left to hunt, killed them off one by one, and returned - all of it in such a short period of time. .
<br><br>
What was more, Adonis was as powerful as Chaim and Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia and Hutton looked at Zen with new respect in their eyes.
<br><br>
They had previously thought that Zen was powerful but on the same level as Chaim and Efrain. They had regarded him to be just a little stronger than them.
<br><br>
But now, Zen had, in such a casual, easy way, killed a talent at this level. He had matched up to those at the Chaotic Source Realm! But everyone knew that Zen hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Chaim sighed and smiled, feeling lucky that he was not Zen's enemy.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen was on the side of the Oneness Sky Palace. He would have been a terribly formidable enemy if he were from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race. And Chaim knew he'd meet a sticky end as Adonis did if he were to confront Zen.
<br><br>
Elvinia had previously fought with Zen in the Phoenix Palace but the strength that he was showing now was much greater than what he had showed then.
<br><br>
She suspected that he had become stronger because of the Civilization Artifact he had obtained from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
When Eastern Emperor Taiyi had later summoned Elvinia, he had asked her to tell him everything that she had seen in the Dark Region. She had remembered everything after she had fully restored her memory.
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact had chosen Zen instead of her.
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't regret any of it. She knew that if it weren't for Zen, she wouldn't have been able to leave the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Instead, she was happy to see Zen grow into a powerful warrior.
<br><br>
They continued to inch towards the core after they crawled out of the crater.
<br><br>
They had encountered some alien races along the way, but they had just carefully avoided them at the sight of Zen among them.
<br><br>
Most of the creatures aimed at reaching the Chaotic Source Realm and wouldn't compete in vain. A few small races even tried to seek protection from Zen, but were rejected.
<br><br>
Zen was aware that some of the small races were connected to the Bearing race or the Sun Crow race. He didn't want to keep any danger like that man of the Lofty Mountain race around himself.
<br><br>
The core of the Chaotic Source World was a ring-shaped mountain range.
<br><br>
These brown mountains shot up into the sky like sharp swords.
<br><br>
The highest peak was located at the center of the annular mountain range. It was over a hundred million feet high, almost reaching the top of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
"There are tens of thousands of mountains in the core area, but most of the Chaotic Source Spirits gather on the main peak and its four surrounding peaks. The main peak has the largest number of Chaotic Source Spirits,"
<br><br>
said Chaim.
<br><br>
Zen stood on a big rock that was as tall as two people standing, one on the other's shoulder and looked at the magnificent main peak. He said, "Then let's go straight to the main peak."
<br><br>
"No," said Chaim, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Why not?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Both Sally and Hutton looked at Chaim in confusion. Like Zen, they didn't know much about the Chaotic Source World either.
<br><br>
"As a creature from the Other Shore, the Chaotic Source Spirit is different from other creatures from the Source World. They are independent individuals and will grow up after devouring their peers. The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits is on the main peak," Elvinia explained.
<br><br>
The mother was the one that had first given birth to the Chaotic Source Spirits. The longer it remained in the Source World, the stronger it would be.
<br><br>
In the early days, someone had gone to the main peak to look for Chaotic Source Spirits. But as the mother became increasingly powerful, the main peak became more dangerous by the day.
<br><br>
In recent decades, very few people had gone to search for the Chaotic Source Spirits on the main peak since the four peaks around it had offered much reaping and in a safer way.
<br><br>
"But most of the Chaotic Source Spirits are on the main peak. Wouldn't it be a waste if we didn't enter it?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
All he knew was that there were only two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits in all, and that was far from enough for those who entered the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
"Yes, it is. The Chaotic Source World is so huge that it's impossible to dig out all the Chaotic Source Spirits every time. But if we kill the mother, I'm afraid some powerful warriors will have to fuse with Chaotic Source Spirits on the Other Shore, and bring them to the Source World. And that's going to be big trouble," said Chaim, wearing a smile on his face.
<br><br>
In fact, every time the Chaotic Source World opened, only about one hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits would be swallowed. This number shrank gradually with each time.
<br><br>
However, the fewer the Chaotic Source Spirits devoured, the faster they could be recovered, up to two hundred thousand of them. In the early days, the Chaotic Source World opened once every 15 years only because too many Chaotic Source Spirits were being devoured, and they took a long time to recover.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at the towering main peak through the black smog. Since Chaim and Elvinia had filled him in about it, he would, at least for now, not aim at it.
<br><br>
In addition to the main peak, there were also four peaks in four directions around it. They walked west, encountering the easternmost peak first.
<br><br>
"Okay! Our goal is the eastern peak!" said Sally, stretching out an arm and pointing at the destination.
<br><br>
She and Hutton were confident enough to step into the Chaotic Source Realm. After all, they had Zen with them.
<br><br>
People smiled and nodded before heading for the eastern peak.
<br><br>
They chose to take a radian route, walking northward before going west.
<br><br>
Zen had noticed that Dorothy was moving at the beginning, but was later fixed in the northwest after having remained unmoving for several hours.
<br><br>
She should have been hiding and waiting for him. Zen appreciated her smart move. He wasn't about to leave her behind and enter the core area alone.
<br><br>
But the situation was shades different from what Zen had imagined.
<br><br>
Chapter 3395 Provocation The group made their way north and with the help of the soul mark, they had found Dorothy.
<br><br>
To their surprise, she was in a naturally formed cave with an underground stream, not a large pit as they had thought.
<br><br>
A strange look crossed Zen's face as they neared the entrance to the cave.
<br><br>
Dorothy should have been able to sense Zen's presence through the soul mark. If she had, she needn't have stayed in the cave any longer. There was no hurricane, no danger at all. She should have come out to meet him by now.
<br><br>
But the soul mark showed that Dorothy still remained motionless in the cave. How very unusual.
<br><br>
Zen had a bad feeling about this and charged into the cave as his body tingled in concern.
<br><br>
As he entered, an unmistakably strong scent of blood rushed to his nose.
<br><br>
He raised his eyebrows as his concern mounted higher and sped up in his pace through the cave.
<br><br>
The underground stream ran red with blood and broken limbs, some belonging to humans, some not.
<br><br>
The stomachs of Chaim and the others following behind Zen turned at the sight of this wretched scene.
<br><br>
They had entered into a similar cave before, with a similar scene. Back then, all but one member of the Separate Abyss race were dead.
<br><br>
The only good news right now was that Dorothy's soul mark still existed.
<br><br>
She was alive, but how or where she was was still to be discovered.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen, like a bat flying in the night, dashed through the incredibly complicated cave with speed and ease.
<br><br>
'Dorothy, please be safe, ' Zen prayed sincerely from the depths of his heart.
<br><br>
When he had gotten about ten thousand feet deep into the cave, what he saw shocked him even more than before.
<br><br>
The bodies of more than a dozen disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and over a hundred nonhuman creatures piled up in a large gruesome mound before him.
<br><br>
"Konnor..."
<br><br>
Zen saw Konnor, with his eyes open wide, lying on the edge of the pile of corpses.
<br><br>
His body was stiff and the fear on his face was obvious. He had died miserably.
<br><br>
"Efrain!"
<br><br>
Following closely behind Zen, Chaim had found Efrain's body, lying there lifeless.
<br><br>
Before Zen had joined the Oneness Sky Palace, Efrain and Chaim were the two most gifted disciples of the younger generation. They had been close and so the sight of Efrain's corpse left Chaim distraught.
<br><br>
He never would have imagined that with Efrain's considerable strength, he would have died before even entering the core area.
<br><br>
Sally tried to comfort him but he was inconsolable.
<br><br>
The six members of the Nine Li race were much luckier than these disciples.
<br><br>
At the very least, their soul marks hadn't disappeared. They still wandered around the periphery of the Chaotic Source World. Umar was making his way towards them, although he was being slowed by the hurricane.
<br><br>
Zen gritted his teeth and pulled those corpses out of the pile.
<br><br>
He violently tossed one corpse after another aside.
<br><br>
Once they had all been moved, a bloody figure emerged from beneath them.
<br><br>
It was Dorothy. She sat motionless on the ground, her long hair dyed red with blood and her eyes shut firmly.
<br><br>
Four-legged snakes coiled around her head.
<br><br>
"It's the Evil God!" Chaim blurted out when he saw the four-legged snakes.
<br><br>
They had seen these same four-legged snakes before.
<br><br>
Zen checked Dorothy's body and a tinge of relief washed over him.
<br><br>
Fortunately, she was not hurt. She didn't even have any wounds. But the four-legged snakes had formed a barrier around her and had sealed her in.
<br><br>
"How do we remove these four-legged snakes?" asked Sally frowning.
<br><br>
When the member of the Separate Abyss race had tried removing them, it had caused him extreme pain. He decided he would rather patiently and slowly clean them off himself than let anyone else help him.
<br><br>
"Let me have a try," Zen said cautiously.
<br><br>
For the member of the Separate Abyss race, the four-legged snakes had lain on his wounds, but Dorothy had none. The misery on her face was, however, unavoidable.
<br><br>
Zen reached out and grabbed a snake. With a gentle squeeze, the snake was crushed into pieces.
<br><br>
The circle formed by the black four-legged snakes was broken. Suddenly, they moved, and jumped at Zen's face.
<br><br>
Zen reacted quickly and calmly, slapping them to pieces and turning them into energy currents.
<br><br>
Dorothy's body began trembling as she slowly woke up. She began breathing fast and retreating on her arms, kicking her feet as she slid backwards. "Don't come closer! You can't kill me!" she screamed wildly.
<br><br>
People like Elvinia and Dorothy had been given some powerful Latent Theurgies before entering the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
However, the Latent Theurgies would only be triggered at fatal moments.
<br><br>
Because of this, Dorothy was not afraid of the Evil God. She believed that no matter how powerful he was, he would have no choice but to run away in panic once the Latent Theurgy her grandma gave her was activated.
<br><br>
But she had not anticipated the possibility that he had no intention of killing her.
<br><br>
He had just sealed her on the spot and covered her in corpses.
<br><br>
"It's me! Look closely, Dorothy! It's Zen!" Zen said loud.
<br><br>
Dorothy's soul had been sealed for a fair amount of time. Even after being freed, she was still caught in a daze.
<br><br>
She studied the man in front of her carefully, bit her lips and rushed towards Zen with tears in her eyes.
<br><br>
This took Elvinia by surprise. Dorothy had it much worse than she did.
<br><br>
"It was the guy from your inner world," Dorothy said pained.
<br><br>
"I know," Zen replied nodding.
<br><br>
After a long while, Dorothy calmed down.
<br><br>
"The Evil God has killed so many people. Why did he let Dorothy off?"
<br><br>
Chaim asked confused.
<br><br>
When the member of the Separate Abyss race had escaped disaster, it was with his own strength and ability, not because the Evil God had shown him mercy.
<br><br>
Dorothy was confused too.
<br><br>
She had gone all out in her fight with the Evil God. She had used her Other Shore Token, the Twin Blossoms, and given all she had with the Origin Swordsmanship, but she was still no match for him.
<br><br>
She never thought she'd make it out alive.
<br><br>
"It's a provocation," Zen said as he stared at Dorothy. "He did it on purpose to send a message."
<br><br>
The Evil God had seen Dorothy standing beside Zen at the gate of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Perhaps this was why he did not kill her and only sealed her beneath the corpses.
<br><br>
Such an act was nothing but a provocation.
<br><br>
"He is a freak," said Elvinia, frowning in disgust.
<br><br>
The killing intent in the depths of Zen's eyes grew stronger and stronger. He silently helped Dorothy rub off the blood stains from her body.
<br><br>
Although he said nothing, all around him felt his intense killing intent.
<br><br>
In the Chaotic Source World, Zen and the Evil God were bound to clash.
<br><br>
But the strength of the Evil God had them all deeply concerned.
<br><br>
Once the blood stains had been removed, Chaim stored the bodies of Efrain and the other Oneness Sky Palace disciples in his space ring. It was an undeserved fate to come face to face with the terrible and unreasonable Evil God.
<br><br>
With that, the group left the cave.
<br><br>
Chapter 3396 The Clanging Sound After the other four members of the Nine Li race sensed that Zen, Hutton and Sally had banded together, they set out for the eastern peak at a breakneck pace.
<br><br>
Luckily, they had safely crossed the periphery of the Chaotic Source World, and were close to the core area. Umar was the furthest away. He was near the western peak, but was moving towards them now.
<br><br>
Right now, all the super forces that had entered the Chaotic Source World were gathering together.
<br><br>
The Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race gathered on the western peak, the Separate Abyss race on the northern peak, and some minor races on the southern peak.
<br><br>
When Zen, Dorothy, Elvinia and the others approached the eastern peak, more than ten Ear Mice suddenly emerged from a large hole near them.
<br><br>
All of the Ear Mice were half as tall as a person. Each of them had a strong aura, and their black soybean-sized eyes reflected shrewdness.
<br><br>
"Master Zen, I'm Darth. I've waited a long time." The long-haired Ear Mouse in the lead walked over to Zen and raised its paws to salute him.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at the Ear Mice. It seemed that they wanted something from him. He asked, "You were waiting for me here?"
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Darth.
<br><br>
"How did you know where I was?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
No one knew where they would be after the hurricane came and stopped.
<br><br>
Zen was naturally suspicious.
<br><br>
"Well..." Darth put its paw to its mouth and blew, creating a strangelypitched whistle. Not far away, tiny mice emerged from fist-sized caves.
<br><br>
Darth laughed and said, "The Chaotic Source World is teeming with lives.
<br><br>
The Rock Mice serve us."
<br><br>
The Ear Mice weren't that powerful compared to the other races, but they were unparalleled when it came to spying.
<br><br>
The Rock Mice of the Chaotic Source World also worked for them.
<br><br>
"I see." A look of relief appeared on Zen's face as he asked, "What do you want from me?"
<br><br>
Zen had once allied himself with the Ear Mice on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Although the Ear Mice had failed to explore the Grand Sky Temple, and had even been drained of strength, it was not Zen's fault. Moreover, Zen sent back the souls of the Ear Mice that had transformed into cubs.
<br><br>
"I have a proposition," said Darth. "Let's explore the eastern peak together."
<br><br>
The Ear Mice thought Zen was a good guy to have around in a fight.
<br><br>
Although they couldn't prove that Zen was really Thad, it sure looked like they were the same person. Even if they weren't, the mice figured that there must be some connection between the two men.
<br><br>
Zen, Chaim, Elvinia and the others looked at each other, and they nodded their assent.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were a race that could not be ignored. The information they acquired was extremely useful. It seemed foolish not to take them up on their offer.
<br><br>
However, Darth was a little worried about Zen's suspicious attitude as it stared at Zen with its soybean-like eyes.
<br><br>
"It's an honor to be with you," Zen replied.
<br><br>
Hearing Zen's words, the Ear Mice heaved a collective sigh of relief.
<br><br>
The Rock Mice that lived in the Chaotic Source World were very weak.
<br><br>
When the hurricane started blowing, they burrowed deep into the mountain caverns, so they didn't see Zen kill the nonhuman creatures from the Divine Lair and Adonis from the Bearing race.
<br><br>
However, with all the information they gathered, they could come to that conclusion easily.
<br><br>
But they were confused. How did Zen kill those creatures when the hurricane raged all around him? More incredibly, Zen returned to where he had been after the battle, which meant he could fly against the hurricane.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were itching to solve the mystery, but it was considered rude to ask him outright. Zen might not be willing to tell them, so they had to fight down the urge to ask.
<br><br>
Maybe he would reveal more secrets if they were exploring together as allies.
<br><br>
Just as everyone was preparing for another journey, Zen asked, "The Rock Mice work for you? That's pretty handy. I want to know where two certain individuals are. Can you help me out?"
<br><br>
Darth gave a smile and squeaked, "Let me guess. You want to know where Yan and the Evil God are. Right, Master Zen?"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were quite shrewd. They knew exactly who Zen was talking about. They even knew the young man in black was called the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen said, nodding.
<br><br>
"Apparently, the Pear Hill knew of the change in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
They have been prepared for the violent hurricane and they're on the western peak. The Evil God is in the north," Darth replied.
<br><br>
"Is he heading for the northern peak?" Zen raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>
An indescribable expression appeared on Darth's face. "No, he's got murder on his mind."
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had never seen such a bloodthirsty person. The Evil God was not interested in the Chaotic Source Spirit at all. The only thing he did in the Chaotic Source World was kill anyone he came across. Nobody could stop him.
<br><br>
He had killed many important figures. These people were the first-class talents of the major races.
<br><br>
Although the Evil God had killed so many, he never stopped. Now he was going through the members of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
But it was a good thing for the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
The Evil God had killed many of their enemies, and they could avoid the Evil God with the help of the Rock Mice.
<br><br>
"The members of the Separate Abyss race are quite powerful. The Evil God..." Zen remarked, frowning.
<br><br>
Each member of the Separate Abyss race possessed superb vitality and strength, not to mention a sturdy corporeal body. The race was domineering and powerful and couldn't be ignored.
<br><br>
"But those guys are in dire straits now," Darth said, shaking its head.
<br><br>
At the foot of the northern peak, blood ran like a stream through the gap in the rock.
<br><br>
The men and women of the Separate Abyss race were over 100 feet tall, like giants. After more than a dozen of them were torn apart, blood continued to seep out and flowed like a river.
<br><br>
On the hillside, four members of that race still stood. They were the strongest, the best of the best. They were the top talents in theurgy, body and Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
They stared at the Evil God hovering in the air. Their leader coldly asked, "We have nothing against you. Why kill us like this?"
<br><br>
"Why?" An aura of malice surrounded the Evil God as he smiled. "I want to hear the clanging sound. That sound is pleasing to the ear and gets me all excited."
<br><br>
The clanging sound? What was that? The four members of the Separate Abyss race looked at each other, puzzled.
<br><br>
They couldn't understand what the Evil God meant.
<br><br>
"That sound is a special one. It tolls when one gains a reward. It means I'm growing stronger. Hahaha..." As the Evil God spoke, he suddenly waved his hands and a black void materialized, enveloping the four members of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
The four members were very powerful. They couldn't be dealt with by normal means, so the Evil God had to show his trump card.
<br><br>
When the black void descended, the voice of the Evil God came again.
<br><br>
"Don't fight it. You're too weak to comprehend what's happening. Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3397 Gaining Nothing The mountains at the foot of the eastern peak formed a natural, flat path.
<br><br>
There, Zen had the members of his team stop for some time.
<br><br>
Through the soul marks, he could sense the four members of the Nine Li race, including Umar, were approaching him.
<br><br>
About 15 minutes later, three joined his team. The last one, however, didn't get close. He seemed to have been blown by the hurricane about a hundred thousand miles away.
<br><br>
"There's no need to wait for Oswald. Let's go," Hutton said decisively.
<br><br>
In the Chaotic Source World, everyone could reach the Chaotic Source Realm by virtue of their own strength. There was no way so many of them could just stop and wait for a single person.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Darth raised its paws and whistled, causing hundreds of Rock Mice to crawl out from both sides of the mountain path. They scurried into the cave below the eastern peak at its command.
<br><br>
As the Rock Mice led the way, they could detect not only the danger in front of them but also the general direction of the Chaotic Source Spirits. It was indeed convenient.
<br><br>
That was why all the large races preferred traveling with the Ear Mice. But this time, the Ear Mouse race found Zen of their own accord and joined him.
<br><br>
The cave in the eastern peak was wide open with a flat passageway that spiraled upward.
<br><br>
Zen walked to the front and spread his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
In the face of some protruding rocks and pillars, Zen and his people hit them with all their strength.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! After several tries, they found it rather easy to break the rocks and pillars into pieces. As it turned out, there was no Chaotic Source Spirit at this place.
<br><br>
Squeak… "Master Zen, these Rock Mice look weak, but they can bite and break common rocks. The Chaotic Source Spirits exist in the rocks that they can't break," Darth reminded.
<br><br>
When Zen scanned the nearby rocks, he found tiny teeth prints left by the Rock Mice.
<br><br>
Clearly, Zen hadn't completely believed what the Ear Mouse had just told him.
<br><br>
If they discovered any Chaotic Source Spirits, they could simply hide them from the public and come back to take them away later.
<br><br>
"Isn't it said that most of the Chaotic Source Spirits gather in the five peaks?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Even Darth was puzzled. "That is indeed the case. There should be many Chaotic Source Spirits even at the entrance. But it looks like something went wrong this year…"
<br><br>
The Rock Mice seemed to be searching for the Chaotic Source Spirits rapidly. They bit and dug into rocks all the way down into the cave so as to not miss any. Although in theory, they should have confronted some powerful ones by now, they hadn't met any such one yet.
<br><br>
After spiraling over a hundred thousand feet up the cave, they couldn't find a single Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
It was an odd situation indeed.
<br><br>
It was not only Zen who thought it abnormal.
<br><br>
The races who explored the northern peak, the western peak, and the southern peak had also encountered the same problem.
<br><br>
It was known that once they entered all the four peaks, they should have gained many Chaotic Source Spirits. But not even a single one was to be found.
<br><br>
After all of them climbed to the top of the mountain from the cave, their eyes fell on the main peak in the very center, which was as sharp as a sword.
<br><br>
"The only possibility is that all the Chaotic Source Spirits are gathered in the main peak," Darth said to Zen.
<br><br>
The latter examined the structure and asked, "So we can only enter the main peak?"
<br><br>
"In all these years, very few people have gone there. Now, all the Chaotic Source Spirits are hiding up there. I wonder what kind of monster they have transformed into after fusing with each other," Chaim figured.
<br><br>
Although he seemed rather playful and carefree, Chaim was, by nature, a very cautious person.
<br><br>
Every warrior had to reach the Chaotic Source Realm if they wanted to grow more powerful. But it was unwise to risk all their lives for it, and waiting another ten years wasn't a big deal, after all.
<br><br>
"But we can't just retreat now." Hutton frowned.
<br><br>
They had traveled long to get where they were, so how could they give up so easily? "I don't think the others will give up right away." Zen looked up to the black smog in the sky. "First, we have to avoid the hurricane. Then, we can take a look."
<br><br>
It was no easy task for the races to reach the core area, so naturally, none of them were willing to leave just yet. No matter how dangerous the main peak was, they were eager to see what lay there.
<br><br>
But the outside of the Chaotic Source World was already in an uproar.
<br><br>
All the core disciples and talents of the super forces had been guaranteed absolute safety. Almost all of them were equipped with powerful Latent Theurgies, but many of the excellent warriors had died in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
"Who killed our crown prince?" The Celestial Wolf race's leader grimaced with red eyes.
<br><br>
"Our young master is a rare talent. How could he die?"
<br><br>
"It's impossible..."
<br><br>
Many of the members from various races had died in the Chaotic Source World, each of them being extraordinary warriors. It wasn't a normal occurrence.
<br><br>
By rights, it should have been likely for them to reach the Chaotic Source Realm...
<br><br>
The Celestial Wolf race's leader's head suddenly shot up as he roared to the sky. "The Pear Hill owes us an explanation!"
<br><br>
"Yes! What on earth is going on with the hurricane in the Chaotic Source World?"
<br><br>
"Back then, we built the Chaotic Source World in order to compete with each other. If we knew a huge group of warriors would die, we should all just distribute the entirety of the Chaotic Source Spirits, shouldn't we?"
<br><br>
This Chaotic Source Spirits could be controlled. Because of the unequal distribution of these Chaotic Source Spirits, the Chaotic Source World was built. On the one hand, the members of the races could receive training, while on the other hand, they could obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits with their own strength.
<br><br>
But this time, too many warriors had died all at once. Their deaths far exceeded the leaders' expectations and they couldn't bear it.
<br><br>
Squeak! "Those warriors were killed by the young man in black who got off the Black Ship," the leader of the Ear Mouse race spoke up.
<br><br>
Apart from the Pear Hill, only the Ear Mouse race knew the Chaotic Source World as clearly. They always had their own special channels of obtaining information.
<br><br>
"Black Ship..."
<br><br>
"Is Shera still in the Icy Snow Province?"
<br><br>
"I will look for her and try to negotiate."
<br><br>
"Since our members have perished, what's the use of negotiating? When that brat comes out, I'll tear him to pieces!" The leader of the Separate Abyss race uttered curses with his eyes wide open in rage. He wanted to crush the Evil God to dust.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a voice resounded.
<br><br>
"The more people that perish, the more benefits the survivors gain. You can only hope that the rest of your races can survive and even reach the Chaotic Source Realm." Fuxi's figure appeared once again in the middle of the open space.
<br><br>
"Human Sovereign, what do you mean?" the old man of the Bearing race asked.
<br><br>
Adonis' death pained them. While the members of the Ear Mouse race knew that he had fallen to death by Zen's hands, they wanted to side with Zen and put all the blame on the Evil God.
<br><br>
"You can ask Yellow Thearch about it when you go back," Fuxi replied plainly. "It should be the last time the Chaotic Source World opens."
<br><br>
The various alliances in the Source World were growing increasingly clear in the chaotic condition.
<br><br>
Even the civilizations on the Other Shore were itching for some action.
<br><br>
After the Chaos Ancient Gods had brewed for billions of years, they understood their positions.
<br><br>
The spokespersons had already been well prepared for the fierce battle to come.
<br><br>
Chapter 3398 The Arrays For Shielding Hearing Fuxi's words, the leaders of the large races let out gasps and sighs.
<br><br>
They were taken aback by the horrific news.
<br><br>
These people, despite being the backbone of their races, were not spokespersons.
<br><br>
And although they were aware of the situation in the Source World, they had no idea it would come so soon.
<br><br>
Didn't they still have at least ten years left? To their utmost disgrace, the Shade Stones fell faster and faster from the hourglass. Elizabeth and the others had already looked into it, and they thought they still had at least ten years left.
<br><br>
It had slipped their minds that some things could accelerate without warning.
<br><br>
Once things hit a critical point, they would erupt.
<br><br>
That was exactly what had happened on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Still, Elizabeth and the rest were puzzled. Before they set out, Emperor Charm of the Sun Crow race and the Yellow Thearch of the Bearing race had not yet returned from the Other Shore. They had no clue what took place in the upper stages.
<br><br>
However, Fuxi was under no obligation to make their doubts disappear.
<br><br>
After all, many races still stood tall on the opposite side of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Instead, he just ignored them and vanished before everyone's eyes.
<br><br>
In the same moment, one of the leaders pointed at the center of the array.
<br><br>
"Some people have entered the core area. They come from the Pear Hill!"
<br><br>
At the center of the ring-like mountain range was a wide, open area that was perfect for large gatherings. In addition to the main peak in the middle, there were a hundred circular arrays resting there.
<br><br>
If a person wanted to refine their Chaotic Source Spirits, they would have to enter a circular array. These were arranged by the powerhouses of the Nine Li race, with the help of other super forces. Luckily, the arrays were safe and could protect anyone who stayed inside them.
<br><br>
In the past, after obtaining enough Chaotic Source Spirits, creatures would rush towards the arrays.
<br><br>
This would allow them to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
However, entering an array was not as easy as it seemed. Many strong warriors failed to obtain enough Chaotic Source Spirits, so they had to be creative to gain more. Often, warriors would wait around the arrays and attack incoming warriors. This meant that many battles would happen before anyone successfully arrived at an array.
<br><br>
Some races even came together to guard the arrays. Although this was discouraged, this tactic did not break any rules.
<br><br>
Compared to everyone else, the Pear Hill was the most prepared. They were able to enter the Chaotic Source World first, but to their disgrace, they reaped little. For some reason, they found nothing after exploring most of the western peak. Because of this, they moved down heading for the main peak itself.
<br><br>
Yan was walking before everyone else, leading the group. Before she entered the main peak, she looked around the ring-like mountain range, a little disappointed with the results.
<br><br>
"Yan, why are you hesitating?" a woman asked her. "Shouldn't we go ahead?"
<br><br>
This woman had her hair pinned up in a bun with more than a dozen golden hairpins. They were interesting because, if you looked closely, these hairpins were her Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Generally, a lot of divine crystals were consumed when the Other Shore Tokens descended, but these golden hairpins were always on her head.
<br><br>
The woman's name was Natalie. She was one of the best human warriors in the Pear Hill, and became Yan's first friend in the Pear Hill. At this point, the two were like sisters.
<br><br>
"All of the nine caves and eighteen veins at the main peak are quite dangerous. Even though we have been well prepared, obtaining Chaotic Source Spirits won't be simple. My brother Zen..." Yan trailed away, pursing her lips as a wave of anxiety washed over her.
<br><br>
After entering the Chaotic Source World, Yan tried her best to find Zen.
<br><br>
But the hurricanes got in the way of any progress, and the Chaotic Source World was too vast to be explored from end to end. Zen was nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
If Yan had known earlier that this would happen, she would have left a soul mark on Zen before entering. She was too confident at the time, and now, she was regretful of her decision.
<br><br>
"Yan, you always say your brother is an invincible warrior," Natalie said.
<br><br>
"Why are you worried about him now?" She gave Yan a reassuring smile and a friendly pat on the back.
<br><br>
This was true; Yan often mentioned brilliant things about Zen to Natalie. In her eyes, Zen was all powerful, even though Natalie didn't agree with her a hundred percent.
<br><br>
There were just too many talents in the world for Zen to be considered the best. In the Snake Goddess race alone, there were countless talents that couldn't be compared to one another. Zen, on the other hand, was from an unknown, unrecognized place.
<br><br>
Sure, he might be the strongest from where he came from, but in the Source World, he was close to nothing.
<br><br>
At the entrance of the Chaotic Source World, Zen even had a quarrel with Elizabeth. Natalie saw this as unnecessary, and frankly, a little cocky. This did not mean his strength was strong, and after all, he had the help and support of Athemar and Winchell, well-known masters of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
What confused Natalie was that Fuxi had come forward to protect Zen, saying that Zen was his opponent.
<br><br>
What puzzled her even more was that the Soul Devouring Demon from the Black Ship was born in Zen's inner world. Oddly enough, though the demon was born within him, he never listened to his orders.
<br><br>
This led Natalie to wonder more and more about the mysterious Zen.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid something bad would happen to him," Yan expressed, shaking her head in disapproval.
<br><br>
"Your brother is powerful, Yan! He can protect himself," responded Natalie.
<br><br>
"And besides, he's not the only one who will enter the main peak. We all have to do so. Don't think too much."
<br><br>
Although there were nine paths and eighteen diversions in the main peak, there were many competitors aiming for the Chaotic Source Spirits. But because they were the first group at the entrance, they had the upper hand compared to the rest.
<br><br>
Waiting might as well be a waste of time. They'd miss a great opportunity if they stalled for too long.
<br><br>
"Sounds reasonable."
<br><br>
Yan nodded and stepped forward, leading all the creatures from the Pear Hill into the main peak.
<br><br>
Not long after they entered, the sky began to rumble and darken. It was a hurricane again.
<br><br>
It surged in the Chaotic Source World and seemed to be even stronger at the core.
<br><br>
After the hurricane stopped, several more teams appeared. They were from the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and the Divine Farmer race. The one who led them all had silver hair, and carried a long, mighty spear. It was no other than the most outstanding talent of the Bearing race, Khalid.
<br><br>
The large group made it through the plain without any delay. They found a cave at the foot of the main peak and entered.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen's group had failed their exploration at the eastern peak.
<br><br>
Because of this, they moved down from the top of the eastern peak along with the Ear Mice. All together, they passed through the plain and headed for the main peak.
<br><br>
When they passed through the circular arrays along the plain, Zen paused and turned towards the Ear Mice. He asked, "Are these large arrays used to refine Chaotic Source Spirits?"
<br><br>
"Yes! They have the ability to refine Chaotic Source Spirits, and do very well as temporary shields," an Ear Mouse responded.
<br><br>
Once a cultivator entered an array, they'd be safe from outside forces.
<br><br>
However, each array had a limited capacity to hold only ten-odd cultivators at a time.
<br><br>
"Zen, maybe you should just refine the Chaotic Source Spirits here," Sally suggested, her eyes lighting up at what the Ear Mouse had said.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits they obtained from the cave was enough for one person to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. Sally was more than willing to give her Chaotic Source Spirits to Zen.
<br><br>
Sally was thinking that if Zen could reach the Chaotic Source Realm, his strength would have improved a hundred fold. Afterwards, he wouldn't be afraid of the young man in black anymore.
<br><br>
"It's a good idea," said Chaim. "But if Zen reaches the Chaotic Source Realm, he will be sent out of the Chaotic Source World for good." He had a deep intensity in his eyes. "Are you sure you want Zen to leave?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3399 Stalagmites These arrays worked in three different ways. Aside from helping refine the Chaotic Source Spirits, they could protect weaker creatures as well.
<br><br>
Moreover, they also functioned as transmission arrays.
<br><br>
The warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm were much stronger than those who were not able to reach this realm.
<br><br>
Those who were able to finish the Chaotic Source Reinforcement and had reached the Chaotic Source Realm would be directly sent outside. This was done to prevent them from killing others.
<br><br>
Darth already knew that Zen had gathered enough Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
However, it chose not to say anything about it. It was perfectly clear that Zen's departure would be completely up to him.
<br><br>
"No way," Zen said as he shook his head.
<br><br>
Zen was the core of the group. He was the glue holding these people together. If he chose to leave, Chaim would have to lead the group to explore the main peak.
<br><br>
That would be too risky. He couldn't just let them continue on their own.
<br><br>
Elvinia and Dorothy exchanged looks. They understood what this meant.
<br><br>
They knew Zen well enough that there was no way he would just leave these people behind.
<br><br>
Zen and the others continued on their journey and arrived at the foot of the main peak before the next round of hurricane came.
<br><br>
Observed in the distance, the main peak was tall and slender. But actually, the mountain base was not that small. On the east side of it, there were two caves. One of them went upwards while the other one went downwards.
<br><br>
When they arrived at the east side, Zen took a quick look at the two caves.
<br><br>
Afterwards, he chose the one that went upwards.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had always been cautious, and Darth was no exception.
<br><br>
Before they even set foot on the main peak, Darth had already ordered those Rock Mice to go inside it first and scout the area.
<br><br>
Upon entering, they found that the cave was very narrow. However, it suddenly became wider after they walked for over a hundred feet. The inner space was actually bigger than they had previously imagined.
<br><br>
Some of them felt quite uneasy and nervous at this sudden change in terrain so they released their spiritual senses to scan the cave.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, they found no living energy inside the cave. It seemed like this place was desolated and uninhabited.
<br><br>
"It doesn't seem like there is any difference between the main peak and the eastern one," Hutton pointed out. He seemed dejected.
<br><br>
He walked towards several rocks and began smashing them. In the end, however, he got nothing.
<br><br>
The expression on the others' faces also darkened. If they couldn't find any Chaotic Source Spirit on the main peak, where else would they be able to find one? They began to feel hopeless. Did they come for nothing this time? "I think there's a difference. Actually, it's kind of strange," said the Ear Mouse Darth.
<br><br>
"Really? What's the difference?" Zen asked. He was curious now.
<br><br>
"Those Rock Mice I have sent earlier to explore the cave have all been wiped out," Darth replied while pointing towards the depths of the cave.
<br><br>
"Did the Chaotic Source Spirits devour them?" Chaim asked as he peered towards the direction Darth had pointed to them.
<br><br>
"Is it possible that another race had entered the main peak ahead of us and killed those Rock Mice?" Elvinia couldn't help but raise a question as well.
<br><br>
Their main concern now was whether there were Chaotic Source Spirits present here or not.
<br><br>
"I'm not really sure what happened," Darth replied while shaking its head.
<br><br>
"There is a very strange force inside. When the Rock Mice stepped within that power range, they stopped following my orders. Because of that, I don't know what they found."
<br><br>
"Well, there's only one way to find out. Let's go up there and see it for ourselves," Zen suggested.
<br><br>
The Rock Mice had poor combat skills. It was understandable that they could have been devoured by some strong Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Zen took the lead while the rest of the group walked slowly and followed closely behind him. After walking for about a few miles, Darth mentioned to Zen, "The Rock Mice disappeared somewhere around this area. Please be careful, Master Zen."
<br><br>
Zen stopped for a while and looked around. He saw several sharp stalagmites in front of him. These stalagmites were densely arranged together, seemingly like the fangs of a frightful monster.
<br><br>
As he narrowed his eyes, Zen slightly levitated and clung to one of the sharp stalagmites. He gently touched the stalagmite with his palm and pushed it a little. With a muffled sound, the stalagmite turned to dust.
<br><br>
"Nothing found." Zen shook his head and touched another sharp stalagmite.
<br><br>
Just like the other one, the stalagmite turned into a pile of powder. He didn't find any Chaotic Source Spirit inside.
<br><br>
Zen and the others were thoroughly disappointed. On the other hand, they were now able to relax after confirming that no Chaotic Source Spirit could be found here. They copied what Zen did and started beating the sharp stalagmites. Also, they weren't able to find anything.
<br><br>
"This is so peculiar. If there's nothing here, why did the Rock Mice disappear? I don't understand what happened." Darth exclaimed gloomily.
<br><br>
There was something really weird going on inside this cave. But because they gained nothing in this area, they had no other choice but to explore deeper.
<br><br>
Once again, they followed Zen and went deeper inside as they went around the sharp stalagmites.
<br><br>
After they walked for quite some distance, they suddenly heard a rumbling sound. It came from behind them.
<br><br>
With anxiety mounting inside them, they all looked back towards the sound.
<br><br>
A bunch of sharp stalagmites had actually regrown in the place of the stalagmites they had just broken! Moreover, these stalagmites continued to grow and crisscrossed against each other. These had now completely blocked any way of retreat. It was as if a monster had closed its jaws! "The stones are able to grow on their own? What on earth is going on? Let me take a closer look." Seeing what just happened behind him, Hutton intended to go back and figure out what had caused this.
<br><br>
But as soon as he took a step back, several fist-sized sharp stalagmites popped out from every direction and wildly grew towards the center of the cave.
<br><br>
Witnessing this, Zen's eyebrows raised in surprise. With a slight flick of his hand, he cast a ray of sword radiance towards the growing stalagmites.
<br><br>
Cling! Even though Zen's attack directly hit the stalagmites, they still remained intact! The others saw this and stared dumbfounded. Their eyes were wide in shock! "Hutton, come back here! Quickly! Everybody listen to me! Run straight forward!"
<br><br>
Zen bellowed. Realizing they were in trouble, Zen pulled the air above Hutton's head without a second thought. Hutton was pulled back from about a hundred feet away. Everybody started to run forward.
<br><br>
If it was just an ordinary rock, it wouldn't matter how sharp it was because they could smash it easily without getting hurt.
<br><br>
However, it would be a different story if these stalagmites contained Chaotic Source Spirits. Zen and others wouldn't be able to destroy these stalagmites quickly enough. If these sharp stalagmites caught up with them, they would end up getting impaled and eventually killed by them.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Dense rock spikes began to grow all over the surfaces of the cave. They covered the entire ground. Zen and others had to fly as swiftly as they could because there was not a patch of ground in which they could stand anymore.
<br><br>
"The cave ahead is narrow! Watch out!" Chaim reminded the others.
<br><br>
Over ten sharp stalagmites half a foot in length had already grown out. It wouldn't be long before they completely covered the cave from ceiling to ground. They had to rush over before the stalagmites closed the entire cave up! "Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Elvinia, Chaim, and Dorothy were the first ones to pass through them. They were followed by Zen, Darth and others.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Sally, Hutton, and Umar moved a bit slower. Naturally, they fell behind.
<br><br>
As Zen reached the narrow area, he frowned as he saw the others were still running behind. He smashed the sharp stalagmites with his hands and feet.
<br><br>
He unleashed a massive force that actually blocked their further extension! "Hurry up! I can't hold on for much longer!"
<br><br>
The stalagmites sprang out from the stone walls and emitted a tremendous force. Zen could only delay their extensions for a short while.
<br><br>
"Whoosh! Swoosh!"
<br><br>
Sally and Hutton had now passed under Zen's arms and looked back simultaneously. "Umar, hurry up!"
<br><br>
Umar was the farthest one behind. He gritted his teeth and it seemed like he activated some kind of secret method. He turned into a sharp golden sword and passed right under Zen's armpit. However, his body had been cut by the tip of a stalagmite and blood flowed out of the wound.
<br><br>
Right after Umar reached them, Zen couldn't hold on any further. He released his hands and went through the narrow area as well.
<br><br>
The place he had been holding on to had now been filled with stalagmites, which blocked the way of the remaining five Ear Mice.
