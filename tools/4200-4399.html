Chapter 4200 The Guardians Bang! Bang! Bang! The sound of his fist smashing on the heavy irregular sword echoed around the stone hall.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't remember how many punches he had thrown by now. Every time the sword broke, it would just quickly repair itself.
<br><br>
Zen felt exhausted.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline was also repairing his body. A few green lightning bolts flashed across the blood-colored sky in his inner world and poured into his body, dispelling the fatigue.
<br><br>
"Can't we just get this over with?" Zen was getting impatient. "Can't you just analyze the structure of the Life Iron so I can attack its weakness?"
<br><br>
After all, Zen was able to counterattack more efficiently when he knew his opponents' energy structures.
<br><br>
Those calibrated counterattacks had always proven effective, allowing him to beat the likes of Othniel, Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Shouldn't he be using the same tactic on the Life Iron now? "The Life Iron has a weakness, but it's from the Stellar World, and my power can't handle it so well after it was downgraded," the ancestry-level bloodline admitted.
<br><br>
The omnipotent ancestry-level bloodline had finally met its match.
<br><br>
"So we have no choice but to exhaust its energy?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"That's right. Infinite power against a limited one. It will definitely be defeated that way," the ancestry-level bloodline said.
<br><br>
"All right then!"
<br><br>
Zen steeled himself then continued throwing out stronger punches, expending more power and moving faster.
<br><br>
As this went on, a pair of starry eyes observed Zen from inside the black armor.
<br><br>
The Human Spirit King Kincaid was still in an unconscious state, but like the old man outside, he also had a vague sense of the outside world.
<br><br>
Kincaid was a leader of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
He was not as smart as Cornelius, nor as fast as Sheehan, nor as strong as Orlando.
<br><br>
But his power was the most balanced.
<br><br>
He had all the characteristics of the other three kings.
<br><br>
He had ended up in the chaos after a miscalculation when the Snake Spirit King had come to kill him, but he held on to his broken body and set a death trap in this place before his life force ran out.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King had tried repeatedly, but failed every time.
<br><br>
Kincaid calculated that the Snake Spirit King would not be able to break the trap unless he resorted to using the power behind him.
<br><br>
But if he did that, he would never get what he wanted.
<br><br>
After the Snake Spirit King, no one else had tried to break into this place again for a long time.
<br><br>
The long years had been torture for Kincaid.
<br><br>
'Why hasn't anyone come yet? Has Cornelius completely sealed this place? Did something happen to them?' Although Kincaid knew that the possibility of someone getting through was slim, he still held on to hope someone would be able to do it.
<br><br>
Finally, today, a human had broken in! Humans were just creatures brought into existence by the world builders.
<br><br>
Although they were very similar to human spirits, there was still a huge gap between them.
<br><br>
That was to say, if human spirits were paintings done by a master, human race was mere scribbles done by a child.
<br><br>
If this human named Zen could not match Kincaid's will, he would definitely just end up dead.
<br><br>
However, Kincaid had been shocked to see Zen's progress so far.
<br><br>
How could there be such a powerful warrior in the chaos? His speed, strength and even understanding and use of space were beyond those of the Life Sword.
<br><br>
How could it be possible? The methods that Zen was displaying now surprised Kincaid even more.
<br><br>
Zen was countering the Life Sword, planning to exhaust the power of the sword bit by bit.
<br><br>
'He could do it.' The ridiculous idea rose in Kincaid's mind.
<br><br>
This gave him hope. Perhaps this human could change everything.
<br><br>
But the chances were too small.
<br><br>
Back then, Kincaid had combined the intelligence of the entire Human Spirit Sect to set the trap here. Only after he was awakened could it be undone. It was not that he looked down on Zen, but it was nearly impossible to defeat him here.
<br><br>
The Life Sword was only the first challenge. Once the Life Sword was defeated, it would turn into the Death Sword. There was no way Zen could survive.
<br><br>
'Alas, I shouldn't have set such a complicated trap at that time, ' Kincaid thought, irritated with himself.
<br><br>
But he also knew that if he hadn't done that, the Snake Spirit King would have already taken him down. It was quite the dilemma.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the real Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Gonggong, Zhurong and the Wing King were all gathered atop the altar, careful not to reveal their presence.
<br><br>
An air of doom and gloom hung around them.
<br><br>
The Snake Masters and snake-shaped Treacherous Beings had them surrounded. Just as Zen warned, the Snake Spirit King had discovered their location and ordered the members of the Snake Spirit Sect to rush here.
<br><br>
"Do you think they can see us?" asked Fuxi cautiously.
<br><br>
"I don't think so," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied as he shook his head. "Even the Snake Spirit King can't see through the Space Deception Method with the Limited Omnipotent Stone."
<br><br>
"Then we should show ourselves," Eastern Emperor Taiyi suggested.
<br><br>
After all, they were here to prevent the Treacherous Beings from entering the altar, not to avoid them.
<br><br>
"Right! If we're to die here, let's go out with a fight!" Zhurong said, all riled up.
<br><br>
The human heroes hadn't had the chance to fight yet after they cultivated the Blood-controlling Method.
<br><br>
Zhurong had already considered himself much more lucky than those who had been killed by the Space Devouring Technique before.
<br><br>
But the Primeval Lord of Heaven laid a hand on his shoulder before he could move.
<br><br>
"What is it? Are you afraid to die?" Zhurong sniped, glaring at the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head slightly. "Don't act recklessly. Wait for the right moment."
<br><br>
Time passed slowly.
<br><br>
More and more Treacherous Beings arrived at the mountain. Some of the Snake Masters were itching to raid the altar, but they didn't dare to make a move before the Snake Spirit King gave the order.
<br><br>
Finally, a huge figure emerged from the side of the mountain.
<br><br>
The human heroes couldn't help but feel unnerved at the sight of the Snake Spirit King, even if they had been preparing to face him.
<br><br>
"Here he is. Now's the time to show ourselves," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
They then neutralized the Space Deception Method and made themselves visible to the Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
But the Snake Spirit King just continued to slither slowly to the altar with no reaction, as if their sudden appearance didn't matter at all to him.
<br><br>
Sewell, who was beside him, sneered at the heroes, "What are you doing? Are you guarding the altar? How funny!"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke calmly, "We are not alone."
<br><br>
Then he waved his hand gently.
<br><br>
Many coordinates were thrown out.
<br><br>
The human spirits of the Black House, the Joy House and the Broad House came back to life, one after another.
<br><br>
Sewell spotted Alphonse, Hamilton and the others and began to laugh. "It hadn't been easy for you to escape, but you return to die. Fools!"
<br><br>

<br><br>
In fact, even if they were busy fighting the Bird Spirit Sect, the Snake Spirit Sect could easily take these human spirits back by dispatching some snake spirits in their direction.
<br><br>
It didn't take long before the Limited Omnipotent Stone mapped out the escape route of the human spirits.
<br><br>
Even though the human spirits of the Black House, the Joy House and the Broad House had appeared again, the members of the Snake Spirit Sect barely gave a damn.
<br><br>
They knew that the human spirits could not change anything.
<br><br>
"Leave these human spirits to me," Balfour hissed as he emerged from the Snake Spirit King's other side.
<br><br>
Balfour had been harboring some bitterness at the fact that Gianni had cheated him. At the time, if Sewell hadn't stopped him, he would've taken his people to find and exterminate these human spirits once and for all.
<br><br>
"Go ahead," Sewell agreed readily.
<br><br>
From the distance, the Primeval Lord of Heaven stared down the approaching Snake Spirit King, determination surging within him. He suddenly raised his head to look upward. Large birds filled the skies; they were the Bird Masters of the Bird Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Sewell looked behind him. "The Bird Spirit Sect is also here," he reported.
<br><br>
"They are useless."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King, who had been silently moving forward, finally spoke.
<br><br>
He had already known that the Bird Spirit Sect and the Monkey Spirit Sect had joined forces. Additionally, he was also aware that the Bird Spirit King was not going to participate in this battle.
<br><br>
Even if the Bird Spirit King did come, the Snake Spirit King was not afraid. Since the Bird Spirit King hadn't woken up yet, he could only fight by instinct. Moreover, his strength paled in comparison to the Snake Spirit King's, which had been proven quite recently.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, the Snake Spirit King continued to approach the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his other hand, throwing out more and more coordinates.
<br><br>
Buzz! Those coordinates flashed with a burst of golden light, and the monkey spirits emerged from them, one by one.
<br><br>
Out came Tearrag, Hagar, Nereus, Manuel...
<br><br>
With every appearance of a monkey spirit, the Snake Masters' expressions darkened. When the Monkey Spirit King finally came out, the Snake Masters' faces turned stormy, and even the Snake Spirit King stopped in his tracks.
<br><br>
The thought that the Monkey Masters' coordinates were in the hands of these humans had crossed the Snake Spirit King's mind once, but he figured the Monkey Masters wouldn't have taken such a great risk.
<br><br>
After all, this was equivalent to giving their lives to low-level creatures.
<br><br>
Why would they make such a stupid decision? But then again, the Monkey Spirit King was not known for being smart, tactical or patient. He was known for being audacious.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
The resurrected Monkey Spirit King, who was sitting on the side of the altar, burst into hearty laughter.
<br><br>
He roared with all his strength, and his laughter boomed across the land like tidal waves.
<br><br>
The snake-shaped Treacherous Beings in the distance stumbled backward, totally blown away by the sound waves.
<br><br>
Even the three mountains around the altar cracked under the impact of the Monkey Spirit King's roar.
<br><br>
"I finally caught you, Cornelius," the Monkey Spirit King shouted through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was valiant and the best in battle in the Four Spirits Sect. He had always led the monkeys to rush in front, while the Snake Spirit King liked to play dirty tricks in the background. He never understood why the Snake Spirit King operated this way.
<br><br>
But at this point, he didn't care about getting answers.
<br><br>
He only knew that the Snake Spirit King was the enemy, the one who had ruined everything.
<br><br>
Now, it was time to take revenge.
<br><br>
Cornelius replied calmly, "Do you think you can defeat me?"
<br><br>
"Why can't I?" The Monkey Spirit King clenched his fist tightly.
<br><br>
Cornelius shook his head almost pitifully. "If Kincaid was here, you might've a fighting chance. But now, you fight alone."
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was indeed stronger than Cornelius, but it was not difficult to overpower the Monkey Spirit King if he was alone.
<br><br>
Therefore, Cornelius had deceived him into entering the chaos.
<br><br>
"Let's see, shall we?"
<br><br>
As soon as the Monkey Spirit King finished his words, the necklace of teeth dangling at his chest began to glow.
<br><br>
In the past, he only had thirteen wolf teeth, but Zen had helped him repair the remaining nine. This greatly increased his strength.
<br><br>
Planting his foot on the altar, he launched himself towards the Snake Spirit King at full speed.
<br><br>
Buzz! One of the wolf teeth flashed brilliantly.
<br><br>
It all happened so quickly. The crowd was only able to observe the Monkey Spirit King taking one step forward, then countless shadows appeared in a straight line behind him. The next thing they knew, his huge hand had clamped around Cornelius's neck.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King roared excitedly.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Yanking Cornelius's long body into the air, the Monkey Spirit King turned and somersaulted into one of the mountains.
<br><br>
The mountain collapsed immediately.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Snake Spirit King's body, which had been smashed against the mountain, also broke into countless triangular fragments, like a silver-glazed rain shower.
<br><br>
In the next moment, Cornelius was found coiling around another mountain. The golden light in his eyes flickered dangerously. Orlando had become much cleverer in battle; now, he didn't merely rely on brute force.
<br><br>
So Cornelius had to be careful.
<br><br>
Just then, a human appeared at the foot of the mountain, where the tail of the Snake Spirit King extended.
<br><br>
It was Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
The Snake Masters, Bird Masters, and human spirits were all very astonished when they saw his small figure suddenly appear.
<br><br>
How could a lowly human intervene in a battle between the two kings? He had definitely overestimated himself. Was he here to court death? When the Snake Spirit King, who had been focusing on the Monkey Spirit King, saw Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he was momentarily distracted. Had this human gone mad? While the Snake Spirit King was lost in thought, Eastern Emperor Taiyi took the opportunity to stab a golden sword into his tail.
<br><br>
Crack! This golden sword was too long to humans, but to the Snake Spirit King, it was but a small golden needle.
<br><br>
However, to his surprise, the golden needle had an unimaginable power. It pierced right through his tail, although the actual damage it inflicted was negligible.
<br><br>
"You can think that we're insignificant, but we're not stupid. We're as smart as human spirits—"
<br><br>
Before Eastern Emperor Taiyi could even finish his words, the Snake Spirit King flicked his tail towards him. Even though it was supposedly pinned down, it moved so fast that Eastern Emperor Taiyi just saw a blur.
<br><br>
With a muffled sound, his body instantly turned into a blood mist upon impact.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi might've been dead now, but his golden sword didn't disappear.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King had no time to deal with this needle, as the Monkey Spirit King had suddenly appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
"Move!"
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King said.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to move away like what he had done just now, he suddenly felt something was wrong with his body.
<br><br>
It felt like he was being grabbed by something.
<br><br>
He shot a quick glance backward to investigate. What he found stunned him.
<br><br>
That small golden sword had pinned his tail down! Boom! Boom! Boom! Just then, Orlando landed some heavy punches on the Snake Spirit King's head.
<br><br>
With each punch, the mountain that the Snake Spirit King had coiled around collapsed a little. After three or four punches, the mountain had been razed to the ground, and a greater part of the Snake Spirit King's body sank in the ground.
<br><br>
At this point, the Snake Spirit King was still trying desperately to find a way to avoid Orlando's attacks.
<br><br>
However, the golden sword was displaying an extremely strange power, firmly nailing him to the spot.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi might've sacrificed his life, but the golden sword he used in his final moments seemed to mock the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Chapter 4202 A Round As soon as Zen entered the altar, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others also came up with their own plan. There had to be a way for them to contribute to this battle.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions were weaker than the bird spirits, the monkey spirits, and the human spirits. It would be hard for them to last long in a fight like this.
<br><br>
Unlike the Treacherous Beings, they didn't have tough bodies and they couldn't come back to life through coordinates. They were severely disadvantaged.
<br><br>
Even the blood power they inherited was not enough for them to confront powerful beings like the Snake Spirit King. It seemed as though the only thing they could do there was to throw the coordinates.
<br><br>
However, the human heroes wouldn't give up that easily.
<br><br>
They began to discuss with each other. With the right combination of techniques, maybe they would have something to offer.
<br><br>
Their weakness was actually their biggest advantage. They were so weak that the bird spirits, the monkey spirits, and the human spirits wouldn't pay any attention to them.
<br><br>
"As far as I know, the Monkey Spirit King is impulsive and vengeful.
<br><br>
Therefore, I think he will be the first one to make a move," the Snake Goddess surmised.
<br><br>
"What does it matter? The Monkey Spirit King and the Snake Spirit King both are too strong. It will be impossible for us to interfere in their battle,"
<br><br>
Zhurong said skeptically.
<br><br>
Gonggong added, "Yes, I agree with you. If we interfere, we will only get ourselves killed."
<br><br>
"How about we attack the Snake Spirit King directly?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly suggested.
<br><br>
"Have you completely lost your mind? How are we even going to do that?" Even the hot-tempered Zhurong showed a frightened look on his face. "At the very least, we have to come up with a more practical plan,"
<br><br>
he added.
<br><br>
'We are no match for the Snake Spirit King even if we work together, ' Zhurong thought to himself. He didn't want to admit it out loud because his companions would just feel hopeless.
<br><br>
However, Fuxi revealed a mischievous grin. "Hmm, do you think we can eliminate him by merely using reasonable methods?" he asked playfully.
<br><br>
Zhurong was taken aback and didn't know how to reply.
<br><br>
"Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that we're going to deal with the Snake Spirit King on our own. I mean we can team up with the Monkey Spirit King and attack the Snake Spirit King together," the Primeval Lord of Heaven emphasized.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, the Monkey Spirit King was stronger than the Snake Spirit King in terms of brute strength. However, the Snake Spirit King was cunning and had Holy Items at his disposal. Thus, it was possible that the Monkey Spirit King wouldn't be able to touch him even after a hundred rounds.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had remained silent the whole time. But at this point, he opened his mouth to make a suggestion. "I can immobilize anything with my sword," he chimed in.
<br><br>
"Are you sure it will work on the Snake Spirit King? If so, then it probably will come in handy," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
"In theory, it will work as long as my sword doesn't break," Eastern Emperor Taiyi replied confidently.
<br><br>
After Eastern Emperor Taiyi mastered the Blood-controlling Method, his sword skills had become more mysterious and effective.
<br><br>
His sword seemed to follow a certain rule. This enabled it to become unbreakable.
<br><br>
However, he had never used it in a battle before. It was because he couldn't defeat the enemy with this move.
<br><br>
Not long ago, he had communicated with the Eastern Emperor Taiyi that was in the chaos. Unfortunately, they failed to figure out the correct method on how to unleash the full potential of the sword technique.
<br><br>
"In any case, the Snake Spirit King is a Treacherous Being. He will just cut his tail off so he can escape," Fuxi said while shaking his head. The Snake Spirit King was a slippery and crafty opponent.
<br><br>
A mocking smile appeared on the Snake Goddess's face. "Do you really think arrogant beings like him would sacrifice his tail to keep himself safe?" she asked wryly.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Snake Spirit King, humans were merely inferior beings.
<br><br>
It would be too shameful for him to break his tail just to get away with them.
<br><br>
"Well, no one knows what'll happen when the Monkey Spirit King fights the Snake Spirit King. So, how will Eastern Emperor Taiyi trap the Snake Spirit King? How will you even go there?" Gonggong was genuinely curious. If there was even a slightest possibility of defeating the Snake Spirit King, he was willing to cooperate.
<br><br>
"I'll send him there," the Wing King volunteered all of a sudden.
<br><br>
Thanks to his bloodline, the Wing King had the ability of the space-time quadrant. Even though his prowess in this ability was greatly enhanced, he didn't have the chance to use it until now.
<br><br>
He thought that this space theurgy he learnt was not even worth mentioning compared to the Snake Spirit King's Space Guiding Stone.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, he could utilize it to send Eastern Emperor Taiyi to the battlefield. He would do it once the Snake Spirit King and the Monkey Spirit King started battling.
<br><br>
After their lively discussion, they ironed out their plan to defeat the Snake Spirit King. Seeing how it might succeed, everybody was on board with it.
<br><br>
During the second round of the Monkey Spirit King and the Snake Spirit King's battle, the Wing King sent Eastern Emperor Taiyi to the battlefield where the two kings were.
<br><br>
As soon as he arrived there, Eastern Emperor Taiyi used his sword to stab the Snake Spirit King. This attack rendered the Snake Spirit King immobile.
<br><br>
Everything went just as the Snake Goddess had predicted. Their plan was going smoothly.
<br><br>
Even though Eastern Emperor Taiyi just appeared out of thin air, the Snake Spirit King didn't pay much attention to him. He didn't dodge the attack and now he was struggling to break free from the sword.
<br><br>
However, the simple golden sword made him unable to move. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't even lift the tip of his tail.
<br><br>
He was now facing a barrage of attacks from the Monkey Spirit King. But the Snake Spirit King didn't even think about cutting his tail off to get rid of the sword. His mind was clouded with doubt.
<br><br>
'What in heaven's name is going on with this sword? What is this? Why couldn't I break free from it?' he thought out loud.
<br><br>
"You should have seen this coming, Cornelius! Take this!" the Monkey Spirit King roared as he charged towards his immobile adversary.
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, a handful of Holy Stones materialized in his palm.
<br><br>
He didn't waste any time. He swiftly embedded the Holy Stones into the Snake Spirit King's body.
<br><br>
Boom! A loud explosion was heard all throughout the battlefield.
<br><br>
The Light of Annihilation exploded and caused severe injuries in the Snake Spirit King's body.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King also hurt himself with the Holy Stones because he didn't use anything to protect him. Nonetheless, the damage the Holy Stones did to the Snake Spirit King was greater than what they did to him.
<br><br>
And that was all that mattered.
<br><br>
"Annihilation Fist!" The Monkey Spirit King was just getting started. This was the perfect opportunity for him to defeat the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Soon after, a wolf tooth from his necklace glowed with black light.
<br><br>
Seven bloodline powers merged into one and formed a light ball.
<br><br>
Afterward, it shot directly at the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King prepared for his next attack. "Extreme Intent of Thunder!"
<br><br>
This time, another wolf tooth emitted a scarlet lightning that surrounded the Monkey Spirit King's fist. He punched the Snake Spirit King's chest and the powerful lightning hit the latter.
<br><br>
"Power of Broken Stars!" He bellowed once again and launched a different attack.
<br><br>
Most of the power contained in the Monkey Spirit King's necklace of wolf teeth came from the destruction quadrant. That in itself was extremely lethal.
<br><br>
As the Light of Annihilation shone brightly, the bloodline powers simultaneously surged towards the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Bird Masters remained hovering in the sky. They watched in horror as the Monkey Spirit King hit the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Originally, they were here to provide assistance to the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
However, it looked like that the Monkey Spirit King could finish off the Snake Spirit King all by himself. They didn't dare get in the middle of that onslaught of attacks.
<br><br>
None of the Bird Masters saw this coming. In just a fraction of a moment, the Monkey Spirit King gained the upper hand.
<br><br>
Alphonse, Hamilton, and the other human spirits were also dumbfounded by what they just witnessed.
<br><br>
Despite that, Alphonse was clever. He knew that the reason why the Snake Spirit King was suddenly at a serious disadvantage was because of the golden sword. It had trapped him and made him immobile.
<br><br>
"Clearly, I underestimated these humans. Not only did they take advantage of their bloodline powers, but they also saw through Snake Spirit King's mind," Alphonse murmured as he glanced at the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and other humans who were watching not far away from the battlefield.
<br><br>
Sewell and Balfour were more stunned than anyone else. They stood there rooted to the ground. Their faces showed utter confusion at what just happened.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! They heard more explosions going off one after another.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's body was in complete shambles.
<br><br>
At this point, it would be impossible for him to escape. He couldn't even block the Monkey Spirit King's powerful attacks. As the Light of Annihilation eroded the heavily injured Snake Spirit King, his body broke into pieces and slowly began to dissipate.
<br><br>
Everyone who was watching felt like the battle between the two kings had lasted for a long time. But in fact, only a minute had passed.
<br><br>
When two top-level masters engaged in a fight, the one who made a simple mistake would lose in an instant.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King stopped attacking as the crumbling remains of the Snake Spirit King under his feet vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
All the Snake Masters who had been eager to fight immediately fell silent.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King that they pledged their loyalty to was killed in such a short period of time. Because of that, they didn't see any point in continuing the battle.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King stomped on the ground with one foot, and the ground caved in and formed a big crater.
<br><br>
His eyes blazed as he was still full of fighting spirit. "This is boring.
<br><br>
Cornelius was still so weak. Is there anyone else who can be my match?"
<br><br>
the Monkey Spirit King demanded.
<br><br>
Chapter 4203 The Death Sword (Part One) "Long live King Orlando!"
<br><br>
"Long live King Orlando!"
<br><br>
"Long live King Orlando!"
<br><br>
Witnessing their king achieve an undisputed victory, the Monkey Masters jumped and cheered as they were consumed with pride gushing from every fiber of their beings.
<br><br>
Overwhelmed with their sense of achievement, Manuel, Tearrag, and Hagar beat on their chests as hard as they could in unison, making rhythmic sounds like drums.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess glanced in the direction of the overly excited Monkey Masters and shook her head in disappointment.
<br><br>
Even though they were frighteningly powerful, the Monkey Masters were almost mindless. What was there to be so enthusiastic about? How could they celebrate like this? It could not be counted as a victory unless they were successful in removing the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.
<br><br>
A while ago, before Eastern Emperor Taiyi decided to sacrifice his life, he asked, "Let's suppose our surprise attack worked, and we managed to kill the Snake Spirit King with the Monkey Spirit King's power. What's next for us? What would be our next step?"
<br><br>
"We'll just have to keep fighting. I'm certain. He will revive again at his coordinates," the Snake Goddess replied with confidence.
<br><br>
"If that's how it is, won't my sacrifice be in vain?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked as he furrowed his brows.
<br><br>
At his innocent question, the Snake Goddess let out a light chuckle before glancing back at him. "If we're all destined to die anyway, your sacrifice would be inevitable. You're only embracing your death earlier than the rest of us so you could buy Zen some more time."
<br><br>
Agreeing to her statement, the Primeval Lord of Heaven gave a slight nod and spoke, "Once the Snake Spirit King dies, the remaining Snake Masters and Treacherous Beings will be utterly panicked. Once that happens, we will try to kill as many of them as we can. Then, both them and the Snake Spirit King will take a while to gather together again after they are revived. In this way, we'll be able to buy enough time for Zen."
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi listened to their conclusions with his utmost attention. He remained quiet as he stared into the space ahead. His demeanor remained calm, and he showed no signs of backing down at that point. With unwavering resolve, he was prepared to sacrifice his existence to help them achieve their ultimate victory.
<br><br>
After recalling how they had planned before Eastern Emperor Taiyi died, the Snake Goddess turned to address the others. "Everyone, it won't be long before the reanimation of the Snake Spirit King occurs. Before that happens, we must defeat the Snake Masters all!" Her tone was brimming with determination as she roused them all up for the challenge that awaited them.
<br><br>
In response to her words, Alphonse, Hamilton, and other human spirits nodded and raised their fists in the air before they screamed, "Yeah! We can't just let a rare opportunity like this slip by! Let's kill them all!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! After having their spirits lifted, the human spirits charged forward towards their enemies from the altar.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters who were too busy beating their chests and celebrating suddenly stopped in their tracks as they paused to watch the human spirits rush towards their enemies. Witnessing their tenacity, they felt their fighting spirit reignite and take control of their bodies as they followed after them to offer their assistance in their conquest.
<br><br>
At this scene, Lawler, Duran, Orval and other Bird Masters hovering in the air let out shrieks of delight as they aimed themselves towards the Snake Masters and shot down like sharp arrows piercing away at their enemy's flesh.
<br><br>
The sudden death of the Snake Spirit King left Sewell stunned for a significant amount of time.
<br><br>
When he regained his senses, he realized they were fighting a war that would result in a terrible loss for them since they were rendered vulnerable without their king.
<br><br>
"Hiss..."
<br><br>
Thinking quick, he began to let out a series of sounds that were unique to the snake spirits to discretely instruct them on what they should do.
<br><br>
"All of you, retreat!"
<br><br>
The sturdy body of the Snake Spirit King had been obliterated, and it wouldn't be wise of them to keep fighting a battle they would eventually lose.
<br><br>
Even though at this moment, all odds were stacked up against them, it didn't matter.
<br><br>
All they had to do was hold them off and buy enough time for their king to be revived to snatch their lost advantage in the war.
<br><br>
"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."
<br><br>
Each of them began to wriggle away from their enemies in an attempt to escape and split in all directions, all the while maintaining their incredible speed.
<br><br>
Although their movements were significantly agile, the human spirits and the monkey spirits were by no means slow, and the Bird Masters were especially quicker than all of them.
<br><br>
Lawler, Duran, and all the others had harbored strong feelings of hatred towards the Snake Spirit Sect. Now, when finally met with an opportunity to channel their resentment in the worst way possible, they were not going to hold back.
<br><br>
Buzz! Splash! Boom! As the battle raged on, bolts of lightning and pillars of light contributed to the hues of the space around them as they clashed against each other along with a vivid contrast of the bloody mist erupting from the bodies of the dead and the wounded.
<br><br>
The mountains that surrounded the altar collapsed helplessly, unable to withstand the overwhelming energy colliding and tampering with the atmosphere, the earth cracked wide open after having endured several jolts of exploding pressure. The energy waves that were produced from both sides created wild surges of energy like those of seawater.
<br><br>
Rays of Light of Annihilation swept across the ground, disposing of the Treacherous Beings in their path like insignificant obstructions.
<br><br>
Although Sewell ordered the snake spirits to retreat ahead of time, they failed to follow through with his instructions unscathed.
<br><br>
Under the relentless efforts of their enemies to chase them down to their deaths, about seventy percent of the snake spirits were wiped out.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful or experienced Sewell was, he was unable to escape from the clutches of the Monkey Spirit King. Just as he attempted to flee into the earth, the mighty Monkey Spirit King raised his feet and stomped hard on the ground, cracking it wide open from the sheer force, leaving Sewell nowhere to go. Ambushed and surrounded from all sides, Sewell was pulled out mercilessly.
<br><br>
Chapter 4204 The Death Sword (Part Two) As the Monkey Spirit King glared at Sewell, he remembered what this cunning Snake Master had done to him in the Night View Island. After several painful, but unsuccessful attempts to wriggle his way out, Sewell was forcefully kneaded into a ball by the Monkey Spirit King along with several Holy Stones. As the Holy Stones lit up and erupted with Light of Annihilation, Sewell's body was reduced to ashes as he burned to death under the overwhelming heat...
<br><br>
Meanwhile, inside the stone hall, the battle between Zen and the irregular heavy sword continued on.
<br><br>
He had smashed the irregular heavy sword so many times that he lost count. As he continued his relentless attacks, he began to notice that the irregular heavy sword was taking longer intervals to recover compared to before.
<br><br>
When Zen smashed it once more, the green light that shone through the sword started to weaken as it got dimmer. Simultaneously, it took even longer to regenerate itself back to its complete form.
<br><br>
Crack! This time, while the irregular heavy sword was in the middle of repairing itself, it was struck by Zen's fist again.
<br><br>
Before the crack could completely recover itself, it began to expand further as it spread across the sword.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of its vulnerability from having endured several blows, Zen threw in countless punches at the damaged sword. As a result, many cracks extended from the hilt of the sword before it finally gave in and broke into dozens of pieces.
<br><br>
Click, click, click...
<br><br>
As the irregular pieces fell to the ground, they scattered in all directions.
<br><br>
"I finally finished it..."
<br><br>
Zen let out a sigh of relief before he turned to walk straight towards the black armor after sensing he had wasted too much time on this one single sword.
<br><br>
As soon as he took two steps forward towards his destination, the irregular pieces of the sword on the ground began to tremble as they rose up to the air and floated in the space above him. Zen watched as the broken pieces gathered in one place and pieced themselves together to reshape the sword.
<br><br>
"Damn it. When will this end!?"
<br><br>
Zen balled his hands into fists as he tightened his jaw, his eyes reflected unparalleled rage coupled with a hint of impatience. With a flash, he returned to the irregular heavy sword and threw a punch, channeling his inner frustration out.
<br><br>
However, before this punch hit the blade, the irregular heavy sword suddenly became ethereal. Zen's fist penetrated through its shadow, while the irregular heavy sword returned to the black armor's hand.
<br><br>
Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle...
<br><br>
Traces of thick black fog began to emanate from the sword. As the fog began to spread across the entire stone hall, it consumed all the light and continued to expand its inky influence, as everything fell into darkness.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, inside the black armor, Kincaid remained in a state of shock.
<br><br>
This mere human had actually managed to defeat him! He couldn't help but wonder what had happened to the main world after witnessing such a spectacle.
<br><br>
How could a creature as powerful as him appear in the chaos? At that point, he was a product of many conflicting emotions welling up inside of him. On one hand, he was left speechless by Zen's actions and potential, but on the other hand, he sympathized with him.
<br><br>
'Breaking my Life Sword will be the worst mistake you've made in your entire life, ' Kincaid thought to himself. He knew full well about the boundless potential that the Death Sword possessed.
<br><br>
Kincaid had spent a decent amount of time with this heavy sword. During the countless battles he had experienced, Kincaid had only wielded the Death Sword three times. The fact that once the Death Sword was activated, even Kincaid would find it difficult to control it was evident enough to vouch for its strength.
<br><br>
Both he and the sword would find themselves in a tough situation where they would be unstoppable and incapable of controlling their impulses.
<br><br>
The darkness that shrouded the area lasted for three seconds, before several horizontal and vertical streaks of green light bounced off each other and lit up the space.
<br><br>
These light streaks refused to meet an end, as they would extend to infinite distances, outlining numerous large cubes in this space.
<br><br>
"Did the space just change? Are we no longer in the stone hall?" Zen couldn't help but blurt out his inner thoughts as he paid attention to his switched surroundings.
<br><br>
"The space isn't the only thing that's changed..." The ancestry-level bloodline's voice resounded in his ears. "This sword has changed all the rules. This is another world, a world with new rules."
<br><br>
"Is that so... A world with different rules..." Zen exclaimed in an awestruck voice as though he was hypnotized by what he witnessed.
<br><br>
"You are correct..."
<br><br>
Kincaid replied nonchalantly from inside the black armor.
<br><br>
Unable to control himself, he clenched the heavy sword securely in his grip and charged towards Zen.
<br><br>
"Damn. What an incredible speed..."
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened subconsciously as he watched Kincaid close in on him.
<br><br>
Before he could have a moment to dodge, Zen was struck hard with the heavy sword.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen was thrown off into the air as though he were weightless, and his body flew past countless cubes from the impact.
<br><br>
If he were still in the stone hall, his trajectory would have been interrupted after getting knocked into a wall at a distance of several hundred feet.
<br><br>
But now, he had been falling backward in the space for dozens of miles, unable to stop himself as the path was endless, and there was no obstruction in the way to break his fall. This was a world of infinite length and width.
<br><br>
Chapter 4205 Modification And Adaptation "Zen, are you okay? Can you hear me?" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was obviously worried.
<br><br>
It didn't matter how powerful Zen's body was. He still couldn't quite compare to the Treacherous Beings. He must have suffered a great deal after being hit by the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
"Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry about me," responded Zen. He winced just as he finished saying this.
<br><br>
The problem was not the heavy sword itself, but this world. The rules in this place were completely modified.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, he was very familiar with the modification of rules.
<br><br>
The universe, the divine land, the Source World, and the Other Shore all had different sets of rules. They were set when these places were just constructed. But with enough strength, it would be possible for someone to alter them.
<br><br>
It was the simplest to modify the rules of the inner world. For instance, it was fairly easy for Zen to change the rules in his primitive land.
<br><br>
There was no doubt that the movements of the irregular heavy sword were extraordinarily fast. But with his theurgy, he definitely could have avoided it.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the rules of this boundless world had been changed.
<br><br>
Therefore, his theurgy was totally useless. The space theurgy he previously demonstrated was rendered ineffective.
<br><br>
Swish! All of a sudden, he heard a strange rushing sound.
<br><br>
The heavy armor that disappeared in the darkness reappeared unexpectedly. It reached out and made a gentle grabbing motion. At once, the irregular heavy sword returned to its hand.
<br><br>
Afterward, there was a buzzing sound coming from where the heavy armor was.
<br><br>
Buzz! From a distance, Zen saw peculiar lights shining one after another.
<br><br>
The buzzing sound was apparently coming from those strange lights.
<br><br>
Upon closer inspection, those lights were actually coming from the runes embedded on the surface of the black armor. They were lighting up consequently.
<br><br>
Earlier, the heavy armor seemed lifeless and impassive. After the runes lit up, it suddenly became full of vitality.
<br><br>
When Zen confronted the armor a while ago, he merely treated it as a dead thing, although he could clearly sense the unpleasant aura of the Treacherous Being. He thought that his real opponent here was the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Now, it seemed as though the irregular heavy sword had summoned the black armor. Slowly, it was coming to life.
<br><br>
Soon enough, two blood-red dots lit up within the armor's helmet. It gave the black armor a more menacing aura.
<br><br>
"What in the world..."
<br><br>
There was an unusually grave expression upon Zen's handsome face.
<br><br>
This time, the black armor felt like a living person to him. Maybe it was even an exceptional top master.
<br><br>
It radiated with a strong aura of life and soul. Meanwhile, the aura of the Treacherous Being still existed within the armor. He could even feel its strength. This meant that Kincaid had not awakened yet. However, Zen could not help it. He just had to ask. "Is that you, Master Kincaid?" he called out to the black armor.
<br><br>
Kincaid was trapped within the Treacherous Being. When he heard Zen's question, he smiled bitterly. 'Yes and no, ' he thought silently.
<br><br>
'I do not wish to kill you.
<br><br>
But because I'm trapped in here, I have no choice.' Kincaid felt utterly helpless and downhearted.
<br><br>
If he could just change his wish willfully, he wouldn't have to face such a shameful and unpleasant situation now.
<br><br>
But then again, how could a wish be changed at will? If only he knew how.
<br><br>
Swish! Once again, Zen heard a rushing noise.
<br><br>
The black armor took a step forward and instantly disappeared from where it was standing. Out of nowhere, the irregular heavy sword slashed towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Actually, its speed was not that fast.
<br><br>
However, Zen's speed had decreased a lot in this world. There was no way he could dodge this sword attack. His only option was to withstand it.
<br><br>
Crash! The collision between the sword and Zen caused a loud crashing sound.
<br><br>
He crossed his arms over his chest in a desperate attempt to block it. The sword effectively landed a hit, and the impact sent him flying again.
<br><br>
While Zen was still helplessly soaring in mid-air, the black armor appeared above him at an incredible speed. Boom! The sword hit him hard on his back. After that, he began to plummet to the ground.
<br><br>
Swish! Hearing this, Zen already had an idea of what was about to happen.
<br><br>
As he predicted, the black armor disappeared again. This time, it reappeared beneath Zen and pointed the irregular heavy sword upwards in an attempt to stab him once more.
<br><br>
Zen instantly thought that if the irregular heavy sword landed this hit, it would probably pierce through his body.
<br><br>
"This time, I'm sure! I can avoid it! If I could just..."
<br><br>
During the most crucial moment, the ancestry-level bloodline activated the ability of the space-time quadrant once again.
<br><br>
It wouldn't be able to change the basic rules of this space. However, it could immediately adapt to such rules.
<br><br>
As soon as the power in Zen's elixir field emerged, he quickly disappeared. Shortly after, he reappeared dozens of miles away from his previous location.
<br><br>
After his spatial transference, Zen did not stop. He continued to move further away.
<br><br>
He went from ten to a hundred miles away. A few more seconds passed, and he was already a thousand miles away from the black armor.
<br><br>
In just a short span of time, Zen had managed to move thousands of miles away. However, the entirety of this space seemed to have no end.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the black armor appeared as if it wasn't in a hurry to chase after him. It merely hovered in the air and waited patiently.
<br><br>
Once Zen was already ten thousand miles away from it, it took one step forward.
<br><br>
Despite the vast distance between Zen and the armor, it still appeared precisely beside Zen. Obviously, it was perfectly in control of this entire space.
<br><br>
Instinctively, Zen stepped back and tried to keep his distance.
<br><br>
However, a strange thing occurred. As Zen retreated, he collided headfirst with the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Crash! A loud booming sound echoed throughout the space.
<br><br>
The collision between Zen and the sword was so forceful that it left a huge dent on his forehead. The gash was an inch deep.
<br><br>
"Zen, are you alright? Answer me!" Once again, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord asked him anxiously.
<br><br>
"Well, I..."
<br><br>
Before Zen could answer, the black armor had already moved to his left side. Naturally, he moved to the right to avoid it.
<br><br>
Oddly enough, he slammed once again onto the irregular heavy sword. It caused a deep gash on his shoulder.
<br><br>
Thankfully, Zen's bones were extremely strong and hard. His body was also unbelievably tough. No blood gushed out from the wound.
<br><br>
Finally, the ancestry-level bloodline gave him a helpful reminder. "The basic rules of this space are reversed. Therefore, the left and right, up and down, and the front and back directions are actually the other way around."
<br><br>
"I see. So how should I deal with this?" Zen asked as he tried to think about his next move.
<br><br>
"Here, let me adjust your perception!"
<br><br>
A stream of life energy rose from the primitive land and flowed directly into Zen's mind.
<br><br>
While this was happening, Zen's eyes began to flicker. All of a sudden, he felt dizzy. In the blink of an eye, the world was reversed.
<br><br>
"Now, to the opposite direction..."
<br><br>
The heavy black armor slashed at him again. This time, Zen's reaction was perfect. He was able to dodge the attack with ease.
<br><br>
Inside the Treacherous Being's body, Kincaid was deep in thought. He started to process what he just witnessed.
<br><br>
The Death Sword was able to make the basic rules.
<br><br>
All living beings in this space had to follow the basic rules in order to survive.
<br><br>
No one could ever go against the rules.
<br><br>
However, Zen was still alive after battling with the sword for such a long time! Where on earth did he come from? How strong was he? This was completely beyond Kincaid's understanding. He couldn't quite figure out why.
<br><br>
'I see. You can adapt to the rules that have already been changed by the Death Sword twice now. You really are as talented as I was in the past.
<br><br>
But if it continuously changes the basic rules, you are going to be in grave danger, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Everyone's ability was limited and fixed. Perhaps Zen's bloodline power could withstand the twice revised basic rules purely by luck and coincidence. But if the Death Sword frequently adjusted the basic rules, in the end, he would still be killed.
<br><br>
Kincaid wanted to warn Zen about this. Unfortunately, he couldn't.
<br><br>
Just like Kincaid predicted, the irregular heavy sword modified the basic rules once more. Zen's body suddenly became awfully heavy. It seemed like it was made of lead. Moreover, the weight of all the materials in this world increased ten thousand times over.
<br><br>
If Zen didn't figure out the right technique, he would suffer another blow like last time.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline had also adapted. Whenever any of the basic rules were changed, it would use a new ability to help Zen adjust.
<br><br>
When the rules were altered for the third time, it only took Zen a brief moment to readjust his perception.
<br><br>
The black armor didn't quite expect that Zen would manage to adapt in such a short span of time. Nonetheless, it carried on with its assault.
<br><br>
But this time, Zen was ready to fight back.
<br><br>
Chapter 4206 Guard With All Your Might When the black heavy armor came at him again wielding the heavy sword, Zen's initially sluggish body suddenly was able to move nimbly.
<br><br>
As he bended down slightly, the irregular heavy sword swept past his shoulder, missing him by an inch.
<br><br>
He took this as an opportunity to get close to the black armor. Raising his hand, he cried out, "Destructive power, three blows!"
<br><br>
In the blood red sky of the primitive land, nine kinds of power of the destruction quadrant began to merge with each other, turning into three kinds of power.
<br><br>
The three kinds of power gathered in Zen's palm and he slapped the chest plate of the black armor, leaving a clear palm print.
<br><br>
Bang, bang, bang! The palm print then exploded three times in a row.
<br><br>
The noise from the explosions was not too loud, and the power contained in the slaps wasn't formidable.
<br><br>
But its destructive power was limited to the palm print on the black armor's chest, meaning all the force was concentrated solely on that one spot alone.
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack! The black armor began to crack. On the third crack, the right side of the armor exploded to reveal the body of Treacherous Being! The irregular heavy sword obviously hadn't expected that Zen would be able to launch a counterattack so smoothly. The heavy sword changed the rules again, making everything in the space become light, and it simultaneously stabbed at Zen's head with great momentum.
<br><br>
However, the moment the heavy sword changed the rules, Zen was able to adapt instantly. Gently twisting his body like a lithe snake, he narrowly avoided the thrust of the sword blade. In one swift motion, Zen reached out and pressed his palm against the blade of the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen touched it, his palm print was accurately imprinted on the blade.
<br><br>
Bang, bang, bang! Another three muffled sounds rang out.
<br><br>
The surface of the irregular heavy sword, which had been restored to its original shape previously, began to crack once more.
<br><br>
"Wait, what..."
<br><br>
Even though Kincaid was bound inside the Treacherous Being body, he could still feel the pain of the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Even when facing the Death Sword, not only was Zen able to adapt to its rules quickly, but he was even able to severely damage the sword! He really had a chance at winning! This was the first time such a thought had crossed Kincaid's mind.
<br><br>
This time, he no longer felt ridiculous. Instead, he became very excited.
<br><br>
He had not yet awakened, and being trapped in the Treacherous Being body was not something he wanted.
<br><br>
In fact, he always wanted to break free from this 'prison', but this wish had never been granted.
<br><br>
Perhaps Zen wouldn't be able to wake him up, but at least he could bring him out of the altar...
<br><br>
"It's all up to you, extraordinary human being..." Kincaid muttered, feeling a glimmer of hope well within him.
<br><br>
As a Human Spirit King, he looked down upon human beings. This kind of contempt was the attitude that the creatures of a high-grade world would have towards a low-grade world, similar to how people were disgusted by insects crawling on the ground.
<br><br>
While Zen did attract the attention of Kincaid before, he only viewed him as a human slightly stronger than the others.
<br><br>
Now, Kincaid realized that he might have misjudged.
<br><br>
After all, he hadn't awakened yet, so he couldn't observe the outside world directly. He could only infer and make a judgment from some hazy sensations.
<br><br>
The strength of this human being was probably beyond his imagination.
<br><br>
This thought made his heart beat faster as hope surged within him, like water gushing out from a dried out spring.
<br><br>
Just as Kincaid got his hopes up, the basic rules of this world suddenly became extremely complicated: every three seconds, the basic rules changed.
<br><br>
If an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior was in this space, even if the irregular heavy sword did not attack them, they would still be killed by this rapidly changing basic rules.
<br><br>
However, the one facing the irregular heavy sword was Zen who had the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
No matter how quickly the basic rules were revised, Zen could instantly unleash the blood power to deal with it.
<br><br>
The sword's methods and Zen's methods could evenly balance each other out.
<br><br>
This battle lasted for a full five minutes.
<br><br>
At this point, both of them stood glued to their spots, unmoving. It had become a silent battle.
<br><br>
In the end, the irregular heavy sword was still unable to get around Zen's rules.
<br><br>
It had run out of patience.
<br><br>
As the sword emitted rays of green light, this infinite space was filled with the life energy, as though life pulsated everywhere infinitely.
<br><br>
The horizontal and vertical rays of green light in the space then turned into balls, and the abundant life energy gathered within these balls. Then, these balls hatched open, birthing countless monsters with two feet and two pincers.
<br><br>
These monsters emitted a powerful aura the second they were born.
<br><br>
There was no emotion in their eyes, but they were all fixated on Zen.
<br><br>
Awaiting orders, they seemed restless, impatiently wanting to devour Zen.
<br><br>
"Do you plan on winning by relying on the advantage of numbers?"
<br><br>
Zen taunted with a smile.
<br><br>
He thought for a moment. Many incarnations of himself constantly formed in the primitive land.
<br><br>
After these incarnations appeared, they flew straight towards the center of the primitive land. Rushing out of the dome, these incarnations appeared beside Zen.
<br><br>
One, two, three...
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, hundreds of his incarnations stood beside Zen, and the number was still increasing with each second that passed.
<br><br>
This time, what Zen used was not the power of the ancestry-level bloodline, but the power of the primitive land! Seeing how the number of Zen's clones had soared, the monsters surged forward to attack Zen.
<br><br>
"Go," Zen ordered.
<br><br>
His clones were also endowed with spirituality and began to fight the monsters with pincers.
<br><br>
This was no longer a one-on-one battle, but a battle involving countless warriors. Chaos ensued.
<br><br>
Boom! Whoosh! Swish! Swish...
<br><br>
Neither Zen nor the irregular heavy sword joined in on the fighting.
<br><br>
Instead, the two looked at each other from afar while observing the chaotic situation.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, outside the altar, when the Treacherous Beings were done cleaning up all of the snake spirits, they once again gathered above the altar.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King broke the silence first, asking, "What should we do next?"
<br><br>
It was not until the Monkey Masters calmed down from their excitement over defeating their opponents did they realize that the war wasn't over. In fact, it had just begun.
<br><br>
"Let's find out the Snake Spirit King's coordinates," suggested Manuel.
<br><br>
"If we destroy his coordinates, then the Snake Spirit King won't come back to life..." Hagar agreed with a nod.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess glanced at the Monkey Masters almost disdainfully.
<br><br>
'These brainless creatures could only talk nonsense, ' she thought.
<br><br>
"Since he has the Space Guiding Stone, it'd be difficult to find his coordinates," Lawler said, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Then, what are we supposed to do?" Manuel asked again, scratching his head.
<br><br>
"Guard with all your might," the Snake Goddess suddenly cut in.
<br><br>
"How long will we guard here?" asked Alphonse.
<br><br>
In the prior battle, the ones who had made the greatest contributions were the human beings, especially Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Thanks to this, the human spirits and the bird spirits now looked up to them and were willing to listen to their opinions.
<br><br>
"Guard," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in a serious tone, "until Zen comes out."
<br><br>
Hearing the Primeval Lord of Heaven's words, Lawler countered unhappily, "Time is of the essence. We need to fight against the Snake Spirit King, not guard by all means!"
<br><br>
"Can Zen really find our king?" Alphonse asked worriedly, ignoring Lawler's outburst.
<br><br>
Even though the humans had garnered some respect by now, the human spirits and the Bird Masters were not willing to place their hopes on Zen alone.
<br><br>
Seeing that there were different opinions going around, the Monkey Spirit King touched the necklace of teeth on his chest and grinned. "I believe in that guy, and we can guard with all our might," he said.
<br><br>
Chapter 4207 Integration Lawler, Duran, the other Bird Masters, Alphonse and the other human spirits were all raring to initiate the fight.
<br><br>
It was, after all, better than doing nothing.
<br><br>
They were bound to face the Treacherous Beings starting to come alive one after another anyway.
<br><br>
But the Monkey Spirit King had the final say here.
<br><br>
The Bird Masters and the human spirits couldn't disobey his order.
<br><br>
An hour had passed when they suddenly spotted a space fluctuation in the distance, rapidly coming nearer and nearer. Before long, it was already floating close to the altar. It was in the shape of a ball, enclosing something shining with a golden light.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes widened in sudden recognition. "This is a set of coordinates!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
"The coordinates of the Snake Spirit King?"
<br><br>
"The two golden crosses are huge. It must be his!"
<br><br>
The sizes and coordinates of Treacherous Beings were directly proportional to each other.
<br><br>
This was why the coordinates of the monkey spirits, such as Manuel and Tearrag, were far smaller than that of the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
The coordinates in the ball were almost the same size as the Snake Spirit King, so they were likely his.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King scoffed and strode forward. "I don't know what you're thinking, but you must have a death wish since you're showing your coordinates to us."
<br><br>
"No, wait!"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess said, wanting to stop the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
But he was bull-headed and intractable.
<br><br>
He turned a deaf ear to the warning. He launched himself into the sky and tried to grab the ball.
<br><br>
The ball continued to float in the air undisturbed.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King caught nothing.
<br><br>
"Hiding in space, huh?"
<br><br>
the Monkey Spirit King sneered. One of the wolf teeth flashed and began emitting a strong power of space.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's palm began to glow with the space power, making it look like he was wearing a blue crystal glove.
<br><br>
He leapt up and tried to grab the ball again.
<br><br>
He still got nothing.
<br><br>
The ball was like a pocket of air which could only be seen and couldn't be touched.
<br><br>
In the Four Spirits Sect, Sheehan was best at using the space theurgy.
<br><br>
But even he wouldn't be able to get the ball.
<br><br>
A huge snake head slowly emerged from the golden coordinates in the ball. It was the Snake Spirit King, laughing loudly. "You are as strong as ever, Orlando, but you still have nothing on me."
<br><br>
Seething at Cornelius' mockery, Orlando lunged at the ball again.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The Monkey Spirit King kept swiping at the ball, to no avail. His fists, as big as hills and usually powerful enough to destroy the heaven and earth, proved futile now. They couldn't touch the Snake Spirit King at all.
<br><br>
"What's that ball that contains the coordinates?"
<br><br>
"It must be formed by some mysterious Space Law."
<br><br>
"The Monkey Spirit King can't break it!"
<br><br>
"Who knows what it is?"
<br><br>
Everyone was stumped.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess pursed her lips. "The Snake Spirit King must be confident in that ball to dare to bring the coordinates in it."
<br><br>
"We don't know what the ball is. Does it make the Snake Spirit King invincible?" the Wing King muttered, thinking aloud.
<br><br>
The Bird Masters and the human spirits trained all their attention on the ball, trying to figure it out.
<br><br>
There were many masters who were proficient in the space theurgy among them, but even they were puzzled.
<br><br>
Under the violent attacks of the Monkey Spirit King, the Snake Spirit King had revived from his coordinates. He darted out while the former was off-guard, gripping him with lethal force.
<br><br>
Orlando was taken aback by the sudden attack, but soon found his bearings. "You think you can kill me with this? How arrogant."
<br><br>
Had Cornelius continued to just hide in the ball, Orlando wouldn't have been able to reach him. But now that he had come out, he could smash him like an egg.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King's arms began to expand. With his strength, he could break Cornelius easily.
<br><br>
But just then, silver runes appeared on Cornelius' body. His soft flesh took on a metallic sheen. In a moment, his body had hardened like steel wrapped around the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King struggled, but he failed to break free.
<br><br>
"I'm never arrogant. That's more your style," the Snake Spirit King sneered.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! Silver spikes jutted out of the Snake Spirit King's body and pierced into the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
Buzz! A huge Holy Stone suddenly appeared in the ball still floating above the two kings.
<br><br>
The Holy Stone had already been activated. The Light of Annihilation enveloped the two kings.
<br><br>
This was now a fight to the death.
<br><br>
"I can come back to life again and again. What about you? Could you also revive?" the Snake Spirit King hissed menacingly.
<br><br>
"You couldn't even kill me once!"
<br><br>
As the Monkey Spirit King spat these words out, the twenty-two wolf teeth around his necklace began to flicker.
<br><br>
The bloodline power of the wolf teeth flowed and gathered in his body.
<br><br>
Before long, a wild aura burst out from him.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King had always been domineering and overbearing.
<br><br>
The first thirteen wolf teeth possessed blended bloodlines.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, different bloodlines would be used one at a time to deal with different enemies.
<br><br>
But when enraged, the Monkey Spirit King couldn't care less. He would just deploy all thirteen bloodlines he had mastered.
<br><br>
The thirteen kinds of bloodlines would usually not fuse with each other.
<br><br>
At worst, they could even clash.
<br><br>
However, the Monkey Spirit King could integrate them forcibly to obtain an unexpectedly destructive power. This was how he had once been able to kill thirteen ancient monsters of a powerful race with a single punch, shocking the entire main world.
<br><br>
The Bold Conjecture House had tried to analyze the technique and recreate this power, but failed. Elder Xue had bitterly noted then that the Monkey Spirit King had simply lucked out and discovered the extremely powerful technique by accident.
<br><br>
If anyone else had tried to integrate the bloodlines, they would have died.
<br><br>
Now, the Monkey Spirit King meant to use the same method for twentytwo bloodlines.
<br><br>
The bloodlines tangled in his body. One released the smell of fire.
<br><br>
Another revealed the power of life. Another sent a thousand bolts of lightning crackling throughout his body. Even the space around him began to fluctuate.
<br><br>
"What power is this?" The Snake Spirit King was utterly bewildered.
<br><br>
"The power to kill you," the Monkey Spirit King said with a smirk.
<br><br>
A ball of light bloomed from his body like a rapidly growing sun. The light soon devoured him, the Snake Spirit King and everything within a few miles, including the ball which protected the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.
<br><br>
Chapter 4208 Resurrection The terrifying power of the light ball left everyone shaken.
<br><br>
The Bird Masters had always been arrogant. They were convinced that the Bird Spirit King Sheehan was the most powerful being in the Four Spirits Sect. After all, he had taken much of the credit for the rapid development of the Four Spirits Sect in the past.
<br><br>
But now they weren't so sure as they felt the destructive energy the Monkey Spirit King emanated.
<br><br>
Duran shot a concerned look at Lawler and transmitted a question secretly.
<br><br>
"Do you think our king would win if he were here?"
<br><br>
"But he hasn't awakened." Lawler shot back.
<br><br>
"But what if he were awake?" Duran pressed.
<br><br>
"He would not win," Lawler replied with conviction.
<br><br>
Duran fell silent, struggling with his thoughts.
<br><br>
'Since we have sworn our unwavering loyalty to the Bird Spirit King, we have to make enemies with other forces.
<br><br>
We're working with the Monkey Spirit Sect now, but we would probably go back to being in conflict with them in the future.
<br><br>
When that time comes, how can we possibly match up to the Monkey Spirit King?' Duran thought worriedly.
<br><br>
Lawler, however, sensed what was on Duran's mind. "Zen is looking for the Human Spirit King. If Zen can find him, the Human Spirit King might be able to save our king. Don't fret too much. There can be peace in the future," Lawler assured him.
<br><br>
Lawler kept his next thoughts to himself. 'Anything can happen. All we can do is wait.' Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions were completely oblivious to the conversation between the two Bird Masters.
<br><br>
All their attention was fixed on the huge light ball in the distance.
<br><br>
The light ball continued to glow for a while before it began to dim and gradually dissipate.
<br><br>
The massive body of the Monkey Spirit King came into view. There was no sign of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"We won!"
<br><br>
"Our king is invincible!"
<br><br>
"That stupid snake was killed again. Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
Manuel, Tearrag and Hagar started shouting, whooping excitedly.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess shot them an exasperated look that clearly conveyed she thought they were idiots. "Where did that space ball go?" she asked as she turned to her companions.
<br><br>
"It appears to be gone," Fuxi replied, scanning his surroundings.
<br><br>
"Has it been destroyed? So the Snake Spirit King was killed just like that?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in disbelief.
<br><br>
"That snake was giving himself too much credit. It might never have occurred to him that the Monkey Spirit King could be this strong,"
<br><br>
Gonggong pointed out.
<br><br>
The ball had contained the Snake Spirit King's coordinates. If the ball had been destroyed, the coordinates likely had been, too. If that were the case, the Snake Spirit King wouldn't be able to come back from the dead. Once a Treacherous Being's coordinates were destroyed, it would mean final, eternal death for them. The Snake Spirit King would be no exception.
<br><br>
"I wonder if the Monkey Spirit King is all right. He's not moving," the Snake Goddess said, arching her eyebrows at his figure in the distance.
<br><br>
'These Monkey Masters aren't even astute enough to worry about their king, ' she thought huffily.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before more people began to suspect something amiss with the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
He had remained still since he took out the Snake Spirit King, looking exhausted.
<br><br>
Soon enough, cracks began to appear on his tough body, countless white fragments flaking off.
<br><br>
"Your Majesty! Are you all right?" Manuel shouted as he bolted toward the Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
It finally occurred to Manuel something was wrong.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King shattered into pieces and evaporated before Manuel could even reach him.
<br><br>
When the Monkey Spirit King released the overwhelming energy, the Light of Annihilation had enveloped him and the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Neither could survive that.
<br><br>
In the next second, the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates on the altar emitted golden lights.
<br><br>
A massive foot came out, followed by another, followed by legs, a torso, arms, and head. It wasn't long before the Monkey Spirit King had emerged fully again.
<br><br>
"Your Majesty!"
<br><br>
"It's our king!"
<br><br>
"Our king came back!"
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters roared in celebration again.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King had just won a big victory.
<br><br>
With the Snake Spirit King dead, there was nothing else that could be a threat to them.
<br><br>
This also came as a relief to the human spirits and the Bird Masters.
<br><br>
"The Snake Spirit King's coordinates have been destroyed, so he won't resurrect."
<br><br>
"So this is the end of the war? We won?"
<br><br>
"Of course we won. Our king is invincible. Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
But while the Monkey Masters cheered, something began to go awry with the Monkey Spirit King again.
<br><br>
Black cracks started appearing again on the Monkey Spirit King, crawling all over his body and causing white fragments to flake off him until they were scattered all over the altar.
<br><br>
The fragments soon dissipated into nothing again.
<br><br>
The newly revived Monkey Spirit King had just died again. The Monkey Masters were dumbfounded.
<br><br>
"What is happening to our king?" Hagar exclaimed, panic starting to overcome him.
<br><br>
Manuel stepped up to the altar and looked closer at the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates. "Our king just came back to life. No one attacked him, so why did he perish again?" Manuel murmured in confusion, thinking aloud.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess and the others soon joined him in inspecting the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates.
<br><br>
They had met lots of Treacherous Beings over the years, but they had never seen such a strange phenomenon before.
<br><br>
Before long, the Monkey Spirit King's coordinates began glowing again.
<br><br>
His huge body once again emerged from the coordinates.
<br><br>
A pained expression lined the face of the resurrected Monkey Spirit King.
<br><br>
He opened his mouth to say something, but before any words could leave his lips, he broke into pieces and disappeared into thin air again.
<br><br>
Treacherous Beings could resurrect endlessly while their coordinates remained intact. But if they died too many times in a short period, it took them longer and longer to come back.
<br><br>
Everyone watched in helpless bewilderment as the Monkey Spirit King came back to life once more.
<br><br>
It was his third resurrection, but just like before, he didn't even have the time to say anything before he vanished.
<br><br>
After that, he resurrected and died a fourth time.
<br><br>
And then a fifth time.
<br><br>
After the Monkey Spirit King's fifth death, the light that his coordinates emitted began to dim.
<br><br>
The Monkey Spirit King was incredibly strong, but after the successive resurrections, it would take some time for his coordinates to accumulate enough energy to bring him back to life again.
<br><br>
"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>
"This is insane!"
<br><br>
Manuel and Tearrag were in distress. The other Monkey Masters were likewise stumped. Their race weren't known for intelligence, so this was quite an insurmountable problem for them.
<br><br>
"This isn't good," the Snake Goddess warned, her eyes trained on something in the distance.
<br><br>
The snake spirits and the Snake Masters had just revived and were starting to swarm back toward them.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven snorted. "They're nothing without the Snake Spirit King."
<br><br>
They still had the Bird Masters, the Monkey Masters and the human spirits on their side. They could easily defeat the Snake Spirit King's subordinates.
<br><br>
As soon as Manuel, Tearrag and Hagar caught sight of the snake spirits, they started snarling ferociously. They had no idea what had happened to the Monkey Spirit King, but they knew the Snake Spirit King was responsible for it. They were raring to vent their anger on the members of the Snake Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
"I'm not talking about them."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess shook her head and pointed at the sky.
<br><br>
A black light had appeared out of nowhere, like a shadow in the sky.
<br><br>
The black light was exactly where the ball had been before.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven furrowed his brows as he watched it grow.
<br><br>
His eyes soon widened in horror.
<br><br>
The black light gradually expanded, revealing the ball within it. The Snake Spirit King's massive coordinates remained intact inside the ball.
<br><br>
A thick tongue slithered out of the coordinates, followed by the Snake Spirit King's head and body.
<br><br>
All the creatures on the altar were rendered paralyzed at the sight of the Snake Spirit King's resurrection.
<br><br>
Chapter 4209 Freeze "Oh, it was dangerous."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's voice echoed from above.
<br><br>
The power in Orlando's blow went beyond Cornelius's expectations. It actually could've broken his guiding barrier.
<br><br>
The guiding barrier was the ball that protected his coordinates. It was also the most useful and strongest ability of the Space Guiding Stone.
<br><br>
At the time, Cornelius had been too stunned to make a move.
<br><br>
Fortunately for him, the black light was able to protect his coordinates right in the nick of time. Otherwise, he'd probably be dead by now.
<br><br>
"Cornelius! What have you done to our king?" Manuel roared furiously.
<br><br>
"What did I do?" the Snake Spirit King echoed with an amused smile. "I simply cursed him."
<br><br>
The curse he was talking about was by no means simple.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful a curse was, it could only affect the current state, but his curse could directly affect the coordinates.
<br><br>
"Remove the curse! Or else, I will kill you!" Manuel's face contorted in anger, his eyes blazing with killing intent. Baring his two fangs, he growled menacingly at the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"You? Kill me?" The Snake Spirit King chuckled dryly, evidently unimpressed.
<br><br>
Manuel was famous back then for claiming he was only second to the four kings in power. However, there was still a big gap between his strength and the four kings'.
<br><br>
Moreover, he was a Treacherous Being now. He had been staying in the Night View Island for so long that he wasn't able to improve his strength.
<br><br>
"Of course!" Manuel spat.
<br><br>
Rage began to consume him. He no longer feared the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
As he stamped his foot onto the ground violently, the earth beneath him cracked under the impact. Then, he rushed towards the Snake Spirit King like a meteor.
<br><br>
"Poor guy..."
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King sighed as he calmly watched the Monkey Master approach him.
<br><br>
Before Manuel could even get close, an invisible space wall suddenly formed between him and Manuel.
<br><br>
Boom! Manuel crashed into the space wall with full force. Instantly, he was enveloped by the space wall, like a mollusk being squeezed by its own shell.
<br><br>
More space walls appeared and formed a cube around Manuel, trapping him inside.
<br><br>
The cube of space walls began to shrink rapidly.
<br><br>
The burly and strong body of Manuel shrank and filled the space within the cube, until his body followed the shape of his prison. In the end, what was left of Manuel was a small, white cube.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he was a Treacherous Being. If it were a corporeal body that was squeezed into the cube, it wouldn't have stood a chance and would've violently been squished to death.
<br><br>
"Coo, coo, coo..."
<br><br>
The cube kept on shrinking. Manuel's body, which was originally several dozen feet high, turned into a white cube that was three feet tall and wide.
<br><br>
"What a weakling!" As the Snake Spirit King spoke, he sensed a fluctuation in the space. "You're courting death!" he called out coldly.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Crack! Then, Tearrag and the Wing King stumbled out of the space.
<br><br>
The two of them had wanted to save Manuel in secret.
<br><br>
They couldn't stand a chance against the ball floating in the air, but they had enough strength to break the cube that imprisoned Manuel.
<br><br>
The Wing King had been racking his brains, trying to find the right opportunity to make a move. When he saw Tearrag suddenly disappear, he followed suit and transformed into an invisible wind that followed him.
<br><br>
But the Snake Spirit King was powerful.
<br><br>
With the Space Guiding Stone and the Limited Omnipotent Stone in his clutches, no one could defeat him here.
<br><br>
Even if he had come so close to death just now, it was only because he had been too arrogant. Otherwise, no matter how powerful the Monkey Spirit King was, there was still no chance to beat him.
<br><br>
"You two, go to hell!"
<br><br>
Realizing he'd been found out, the Wing King gently spread his wings.
<br><br>
However, his wings were shattered before he could even fully spread them. Before he knew it, a square space encased him. With a loud crackling noise, he became an emerald green cube.
<br><br>
Suffering the same fate as Manuel, Tearrag was trapped.
<br><br>
Once he'd dealt with them, the Snake Spirit King barked, "Sewell, you may go up now. The battle is over."
<br><br>
Sewell had been waiting with a group of snake spirits. As the Snake Spirit King gave the order, he let out a hiss, and all the snake spirits immediately spread out to surround the altar.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the infinite space, the number of monsters with two feet and two pincers was dwindling.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the number of Zen's clones floating in the void soared.
<br><br>
Although the irregular heavy sword was still constantly creating monsters, the speed at which they were created became slower and slower, and the quality of these newly born monsters grew poorer each time. It was only a matter of time before Zen's clones finished them off.
<br><br>
Finally, the irregular heavy sword was exhausted.
<br><br>
"It's over," Zen said with a satisfied smile. "You've lost."
<br><br>
Even if the irregular heavy sword had turned into the Death Sword, the energy it possessed still had a limit. At this point, its limit had been reached.
<br><br>
With the support of his primitive land, Zen was invincible. It had been a mistake for the irregular heavy sword to choose to fight him this way.
<br><br>
When the last monster was finished off by Zen's clones, Zen willed the clones to flow towards him, turn into small dots of light and finally, merge into his cinnabar field.
<br><br>
The black armor was still silently holding the Death Sword as he did this.
<br><br>
The irregular heavy sword had emotions, which couldn't be perceived by outsiders. Only its owner could sense what it was feeling.
<br><br>
Kincaid could clearly feel that the irregular heavy sword was in a depressed state.
<br><br>
'This guy was too hard on my sword..."
<br><br>
Kincaid thought almost wistfully, as he had never felt such an emotion from the irregular heavy sword before.
<br><br>
Every time he held this sword, he could feel its fighting spirit and the strong connection between them.
<br><br>
Even after he had become a Treacherous Being, the irregular heavy sword was still loyal to him.
<br><br>
In the past many years, when he was unable to move, the sword still cultivated on its own.
<br><br>
Although Kincaid was tempted to share the common hatred with the irregular heavy sword, he had hoped that ultimately, Zen would win.
<br><br>
When he felt the sword's depression, he felt bittersweet.
<br><br>
However, the depression only lasted for a moment. The next thing he knew, Kincaid sensed the irregular heavy sword had made up its mind.
<br><br>
"You... What do you want to do?" Kincaid was shocked.
<br><br>
The Death Sword was the ultimate form of the irregular heavy sword. If it couldn't defeat its opponent at its best, then that was it.
<br><br>
Buzz! The unfolded infinite world suddenly disappeared, and Zen returned to the stone hall.
<br><br>
Soon after, the black armor pointed its irregular heavy sword to Zen, and white dots of light and a cold aura emanated from the blade.
<br><br>
"You still want to fight?"
<br><br>
Zen asked with a frown.
<br><br>
The irregular heavy sword might be powerful, but Zen had found a way to deal with it. Did this sword have another trump card? However, to Zen's surprise, the irregular heavy sword did not launch an attack.
<br><br>
Instead, the white dots of light and the cold aura created a Cold Prison.
<br><br>
Gradually, the dots of light landed on the heavy armor.
<br><br>
Layers of white frost appeared and condensed into blocks of ice, sealing the sword and the heavy armor within.
<br><br>
"What's happening?!"
<br><br>
Zen was stunned, unsure of how to react.
<br><br>
"This sword is intelligent," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord explained softly. "It knows that it is no match for you and can't protect Kincaid in the black armor, so it freezes itself."
<br><br>
Even at this time, the sword still protected its owner. How loyal it was! Chapter 4210 Gained Recognition Zen walked forward and gently tapped on the ice of the black armor. A touch of coldness condensed white frost on his hand.
<br><br>
"What should we do now? Carry him out like this?" Zen asked, furrowing his brows.
<br><br>
With Zen's strength, it'd be pretty simple to break through this layer of ice.
<br><br>
The issue now was whether this was the right way to proceed.
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid hasn't awakened yet; I think you'd better move him out,"
<br><br>
the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord suggested.
<br><br>
He thought of this out of respect for Kincaid.
<br><br>
After all, it was the Human Spirit King who was inside the black armor.
<br><br>
"Okay." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
They figured it might be better for Zen to carry Kincaid out first before they made any rash decisions. Perhaps by then, they could think of a way to wake up Kincaid.
<br><br>
However, at this moment, the ancestry-level bloodline spoke, "Zen, dismantle the black armor and the sword."
<br><br>
Zen was slightly stunned. "Why?"
<br><br>
"The ability of this irregular heavy sword is very similar to mine. I want to explore it..." the ancestry-level bloodline explained.
<br><br>
The ability of this sword to constantly modify the rules had truly impressed Zen.
<br><br>
It was impossible for anyone else to leave the infinite space.
<br><br>
The suggestion of the ancestry-level bloodline was aligned with Zen's inclinations, but he was still a little hesitant. "Isn't it disrespectful to do that?"
<br><br>
"Since the Human Spirit Sect has been reduced to such a situation, there is no need to consider if it is respectful or not," the ancestry-level bloodline replied bluntly.
<br><br>
"That may be true..." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
He bowed to the black armor and said, "I broke in here to save the Human Spirit King. I didn't mean to offend you. Please forgive me if I do!"
<br><br>
The irregular heavy sword had proven itself to be intelligent, but Zen didn't know whether it could understand him or not.
<br><br>
After saying that, Zen lightly patted the surface of the ice with his palm.
<br><br>
Pop! A muffled sound rang out.
<br><br>
Then, hairline cracks appeared inside the originally clear ice, until it collapsed into countless finger-sized ice blocks that fell to the ground.
<br><br>
If these finger-sized ice blocks were thrown into any of the large provinces of the Source World, they would've launched an ice age over the whole area. Once they melted, an ocean would be formed.
<br><br>
However, the irregular heavy sword was obviously not willing to give up.
<br><br>
Although it did not attempt to attack Zen again, the moment the solid ice broke, it released white light dots, quickly imprisoning it and the black armor in ice once more.
<br><br>
It seemed determined to struggle till the end.
<br><br>
Pop...
<br><br>
Patiently, Zen broke the ice again.
<br><br>
Knowing that the irregular heavy sword would freeze itself again, Zen immediately reached in to grab the sword hilt before it could take action.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, a flame cyclone formed in his palm.
<br><br>
Clatter, clatter, clatter...
<br><br>
Under the intense heat of the flame cyclone, the cold air of the irregular heavy sword could not be condensed into ice.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Even then, the sword was still unwilling to give up. It trembled in Zen's hand and tried to break free, but Zen clasped it firmly.
<br><br>
During this whole time, the irregular heavy sword was quietly communicating with Kincaid.
<br><br>
Kincaid could roughly tell what was happening outside. After sensing the unwillingness of the irregular heavy sword, he advised, "You've already lost. According to the rule, he's your master, as I also became your master in this way back then."
<br><br>
The sword and the armor made of the Life Iron had been found and obtained by Kincaid and Sheehan in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
When he met it for the first time, Kincaid used all kinds of methods to subdue it.
<br><br>
After years of companionship, he and the sword grew to become comrades in arms.
<br><br>
"What? You say you didn't have a master at that time, but now your master is me?"
<br><br>
Kincaid once again felt a strong emotion from the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
He shook his head and sighed. "According to the standards of the main world, I'm already dead. Now I can't even wake up. How can I be your master? The most important thing is that he is not our enemy. He has come to save me.
<br><br>
I believe in this human being! He is the extension of our human spirits. Please respect my judgment. You can trust him..."
<br><br>
Kincaid urged.
<br><br>
The truth of the matter was that Kincaid might have had some doubts about Zen.
<br><br>
However, Zen standing before him was probably his only hope. He had to trust him. Otherwise, he would probably be trapped there forever.
<br><br>
Finally convinced, the irregular heavy sword stopped trembling.
<br><br>
Zen gripped the hilt of the sword and pointed it upward.
<br><br>
Buzz! The cracks on the blade emitted rays of red light, and a strange emotion that resembled longing was transmitted to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen sensed that it was hungry and thirsty, and it needed energy.
<br><br>
At first, he didn't know how to respond, but the ancestry-level bloodline also sensed its hunger. Immense energy like sea water surged into Zen's arm and flowed into the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
The irregular heavy sword did not even try to repel the energy given by the ancestry-level bloodline. In fact, it seemed to lap it up ravenously.
<br><br>
"Is this sword born for you?" Zen said jokingly.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline said, "I don't know, but I must have some sort of connection with it..."
<br><br>
After the irregular heavy sword's hunger was satiated, it let out a soft buzzing noise. Then, the black armor began to disintegrate.
<br><br>
Clatter! Helmet, breastplate, shoulder pads...
<br><br>
The pieces of broken black armor suddenly flew towards Zen. In the blink of an eye, Zen found himself neatly covered in the black armor.
<br><br>
"This armor..."
<br><br>
While Zen was still caught in surprise, it vaguely registered on him that a Treacherous Being was standing in the exact same place the black armor had just been. This Treacherous Being was tall and strong, bearing a handsome face. A wild and keen aura emanated from him. This was the Human Spirit King, Kincaid.
<br><br>
On the chest of Kincaid, there were two golden crosses floating. They were his coordinates.
<br><br>
"What type of Treacherous Being is Kincaid's body?" Zen asked aloud.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord replied, "He is neither of the killing type nor the friendly type. The kind of Treacherous Being which remains motionless belongs to the sleeping type."
<br><br>
After all, it wasn't Kincaid that had attacked Zen, but his sword.
<br><br>
"Then I..."
<br><br>
Zen wanted to ask how to deal with the Treacherous Being, but before the words could leave his lips, a rumble suddenly came from above. The entire altar had begun to shake! 'They can't hold on any longer.' Zen's eyebrows raised slightly, anxiety suddenly welling up within him.
<br><br>
He knew that the Snake Spirit King would definitely attack the altar, but he had trusted that the combined power of the human spirits, the monkey spirits and the bird spirits was enough to resist for a period of time.
<br><br>
Thus, Zen swiftly took out his Sumeru Space and tossed the Human Spirit King's Treacherous Being body and coordinates into it. Then, he spared no time and quickly left the stone hall.
<br><br>
When Zen pushed the door open, the old man guarding the ice hall jerked his head up.
<br><br>
The old man's obsession was Kincaid, after all. Naturally, he cared about everything that took place within the stone hall.
<br><br>
When the old man saw the heavy black armor push the door open and come out, he froze in place for a few moments. His originally dull eyes suddenly flashed with life. He thought that Kincaid had awakened, and his obsession was instantly satisfied, so he suddenly woke up.
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid!"
<br><br>
The old man strode to Zen excitedly and knelt down on one knee before him.
<br><br>
"You... You have woken up?" Zen, stunned, embarrassedly explained, "I'm not Kincaid."
<br><br>
The old man slowly stood up and looked at him with confusion. "It's you,"
<br><br>
he cried as it dawned on him. "You are that human being! You defeated Master Kincaid? He hasn't woken up?"
<br><br>
"No, his Treacherous Being body has been stored into my Sumeru Space,"
<br><br>
Zen answered.
<br><br>
"Why?" the old man demanded, unable to contain his excitement.
<br><br>
Zen waved his hand. "The Snake Spirit King is attacking outside the altar.
<br><br>
I need to deal with that first."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, Zen headed straight to the gate without another word.
<br><br>
The old man stood there in a daze for a moment, watching Zen's receding figure. Suddenly, he realized that Kincaid had been taken away by this human, so he hurriedly chased after him.
<br><br>
Chapter 4211 The Third Stone While they were on the altar, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions were struggling to hold out against their enemies.
<br><br>
Supposedly, eliminating the snake spirits should be a piece of cake, because they had the bird spirits, human spirits, and monkey spirits on their side.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King was alive. This was a huge advantage to the snake spirits.
<br><br>
Sewell's hissing could be heard all throughout the area.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Hagar and Nereus caught sight of Sewell. They rushed towards him at the same time. The former charged from his left side while the latter charged from his right.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Monkey Spirit King, Manuel, and Tearrag had been cursed. Thus, they were unable to join the battle. Nevertheless, the Monkey Masters didn't feel dejected at all. On the contrary, this made them angrier and more anxious to fight their enemies.
<br><br>
Hagar and Nereus, the two Monkey Masters, moved extremely fast that Sewell didn't immediately realize what was going on.
<br><br>
"If anything happens to our king, we will annihilate all of you!" Hagar roared as he was charging at Sewell.
<br><br>
He stretched out his hands, and a black stick instantly shot out of his right hand.
<br><br>
Under his careful control, he aimed the black stick at Sewell.
<br><br>
As Hagar got closer to Sewell, he directed his stick towards his opponent's shoulder.
<br><br>
The once solid stick suddenly transformed into liquid.
<br><br>
The black ink splashed all over Sewell's body.
<br><br>
Hagar was one of the weakest among the Monkey Masters in terms of brute strength. Nonetheless, he was pretty good with sealing things.
<br><br>
What he unleashed was the Ink Sealing Technique. It was a theurgy devised by the people in the Bold Conjecture House. It was regarded as one of their top theurgies.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the black ink had covered Sewell. Nereus muttered under his breath, "Perfect! I'm going to cut him into pieces!"
<br><br>
After Hagar performed the Ink Sealing Technique, Nereus appeared on Sewell's side.
<br><br>
Colorful fingernails grew on top of Nereus' original ones. These colorful fingernails were actually made from energy. Each one was as sharp as a dagger.
<br><br>
In an instant, Sewell sustained deep scratches from Nereus' sharp fingernails. When Hagar's ink landed on him, his movements slowed down. He felt like his body suddenly became vulnerable. Hence, Nereus was able to rip his body inch by inch.
<br><br>
At first, Sewell didn't take the Monkey Masters seriously. He thought that they would surely win this war. However, Hagar and Nereus' combined attacks completely caught him off guard. The worse part of it was he could not even defend himself.
<br><br>
They already destroyed one-third of Sewell's body. But suddenly, Hagar and Nereus felt a heavy pressure coming from above them. As they were about to get pounded into the ground by the extreme pressure, they attempted to move aside. However, the force converged at them from every direction.
<br><br>
In just a blink of an eye, the two of them turned into cube-shaped bricks.
<br><br>
Sewell gathered all his strength and broke the Ink Sealing Technique.
<br><br>
With a trace of shame all over his face, he said, "Thank you, my king..."
<br><br>
"These Monkey Masters are very powerful, especially now that they want to avenge their king. They are going all out. You should be more careful,"
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King said to him.
<br><br>
"Yes, sir!" Sewell responded with an energetic nod.
<br><br>
All at once, several bone spikes extruded from Sewell's body. They began to move towards the altar at an even greater speed.
<br><br>
One by one, the Bird Masters, Monkey Masters, and human spirits left the altar and attacked the snake spirits.
<br><br>
Every time they did so, the Snake Spirit King would turn them into bricks.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King didn't really kill them. He merely trapped them in a very tight space. This way, they would be unable to move an inch.
<br><br>
After a while, more human spirits, Bird Masters, and Monkey Masters were turned into bricks.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others furrowed their brows. There was no way they could win now that the Snake Spirit King kept turning their allies into bricks.
<br><br>
Even though they once confronted lots of formidable opponents, they were able to hold out against them.
<br><br>
But as they looked at the gigantic Snake Spirit King, they felt powerless.
<br><br>
What else could they do now? They had never been so frustrated. At this point, they were stumped and had no idea how to defeat such an invincible being.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters were trapped in the space blocks one after another.
<br><br>
Soon enough, they were scattered all around the altar.
<br><br>
The Bird Masters suffered the same fate.
<br><br>
Afterward, the human spirits also ended up inside the space blocks.
<br><br>
In the end, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions were the only ones standing on the altar. They were now backed into a corner.
<br><br>
Moreover, they had no trump card up their sleeves. This was such a humiliating situation.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King looked down at them. His face revealed a playful smile.
<br><br>
Zhurong narrowed his eyes and said, "I will fight him to the death." Even at this point, he still had a burning determination to defeat the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
The heat emanated from his body and began to spread.
<br><br>
In a flash, he burst into flames. Tongues of fire radiated from his body.
<br><br>
He jumped up and attempted to attack the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
However, he immediately felt a tremendous force coming at him.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he was condensed into a cube and dropped on the ground. As a result, he couldn't move an inch.
<br><br>
"As a matter of fact, I should thank you," said the Snake Spirit King calmly.
<br><br>
"What do you mean "thank us? What are you getting at?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at the Snake Spirit King with a somber expression on his face.
<br><br>
"That human named Zen got his hands on something that I wasn't able to get," the Snake Spirit King answered.
<br><br>
He could see what was happening in the altar using the Limited Omnipotent Stone.
<br><br>
"Did Zen manage to free the Human Spirit King?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven turned around to look down at the gate.
<br><br>
"Yes, he did," the Snake Spirit King replied. His eyes lit up in excitement.
<br><br>
"I know he's your only hope. He's mine as well."
<br><br>
When they heard this, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were completely bewildered.
<br><br>
'Did he just say Zen was his hope? What is he talking about?' They all wondered about the same thing.
<br><br>
At that moment, a buzzing sound came from the inside of alter. It was immediately followed by a burst of cold air.
<br><br>
They heard a crisp sound of footsteps coming from it.
<br><br>
Zen emerged from the gate clad in black armor. He walked up the stairs with a heavy sword in his hand.
<br><br>
As he stood on the top step, he glanced around. When he caught sight of numerous cubes scattered on the ground, he narrowed his eyes. "You were waiting for me," he said as he raised his head and stared at the Snake Spirit King in the sky.
<br><br>
"Yes, I was," the Snake Spirit King answered.
<br><br>
"I have been waiting for this moment for far too long. You didn't let me down. Good. Very good," the Snake Spirit King continued. There was a trace of suppressed excitement in his voice.
<br><br>
Zen remained standing there and kept looking at the Snake Spirit King calmly.
<br><br>
Without saying anything, Zen raised his sword.
<br><br>
Even though it was a heavy sword, he was wielding as though it was as light as a feather.
<br><br>
As the irregular sword slashed through the air, it made harsh cutting sounds.
<br><br>
"You went into the altar yourself and failed to beat Master Kincaid. Do you really think you can defeat me now?" Zen finally spoke.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King flashed him a confident smile. "Of course, I can,"
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King responded.
<br><br>
"What makes you think I am going to lose against you?" Zen asked once more.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. You'll see soon enough..."
<br><br>
Half of the Snake Spirit King's body was inside the coordinates, which were inside the ball.
<br><br>
Gradually, he went out of the coordinates and returned to his normal figure. There were two stones floating in front of his forehead. One was the diamond-shaped Limited Omnipotent Stone, and the other was the triangular Space Guiding Stone.
<br><br>
A black round gem began to appear in front of his forehead just as a black light flickered slightly around it. The gem exuded a faint black smoke that seeped into his scales.
<br><br>
Shortly after, a layer of black scales appeared on the surface of the Snake Spirit King's body.
<br><br>
"Come up here!" the Snake Spirit King said.
<br><br>
Just then, a space wall appeared under Zen's feet and sent him up in the air.
<br><br>
But suddenly, they heard a light cracking sound.
<br><br>
Zen stepped lightly on the space wall and broke it into pieces. "I can do it myself," he said.
<br><br>
Chapter 4212 The Might Of The Sword The space wall, carefully crafted by the Space Guiding Stone, was so formidable that it was impossible to resist its force.
<br><br>
That was why even the Great Ape King, Lawler, and Duran were trapped by it.
<br><br>
However, once Zen raised his foot and stomped hard on it with his might, it crumbled down as though it were nothing to him. Then, he soared into the sky in a fleeting moment.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess moved her head up as she kept her gaze fixated on Zen's rising figure and asked, "What do you think Zen meant when he said Kincaid defeated the Snake Spirit King?"
<br><br>
"The more important question is, why is Kincaid not here? He's been freed, hasn't he?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven sounded just as puzzled.
<br><br>
Just as they pondered over to make sense of the situation in their heads, their train of thought was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a Treacherous Being at the square entrance. It was an elderly looking human spirit.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven let out a short gasp as his eyes fell on the elderly figure. Recovering from his state of disbelief, he frantically cupped his hands and bowed respectfully. "Master Kincaid."
<br><br>
"What? Master Kincaid?"
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others switched their gazes from the Primeval Lord of Heaven to the elderly figure that stood in the distance.
<br><br>
Judging from the Primeval Lord of Heaven's gesture, they instinctively concluded that man to be Kincaid.
<br><br>
However, the old man diffused their suspicions with a slight wave of his hand as he spoke, "No, you've got it wrong. I'm not Master Kincaid."
<br><br>
"Then, who are you?"
<br><br>
"I'm simply Master Kincaid's servant. My name is Corbett," the elderly man answered in a dignified tone.
<br><br>
In the entire Human Spirit Sect, Corbett was Kincaid's most loyal and sincerest servant. He had been serving him for countless years without faltering.
<br><br>
Even though he had transformed into a Treacherous Being after he died, he still continued to perform his duties by guarding the altar.
<br><br>
"Master Corbett, what happened inside the altar? Where is Master Kincaid?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, unable to contain his curiosity any longer.
<br><br>
"Was the Snake Spirit King really defeated by Master Kincaid?" The Snake Goddess voiced her concerns after him.
<br><br>
Corbett looked at the Snake Spirit King in the sky. A shadow of sadness hovered over his eyes as his expression turned gloomy. "Yes, the Snake Spirit King had entered the altar before and failed to resolve the trap set up by Master Kincaid, which resulted in his death."
<br><br>
"So the key to the altar is a trap?" The Snake Goddess's expression switched as she raised her brow.
<br><br>
"That's right." Corbett nodded to her question and continued, "The Snake Spirit King, as a Treacherous Being, couldn't defeat Master Kincaid, so he wanted to lure someone else to enter the altar."
<br><br>
Upon hearing what happened, the Snake Goddess and the Primeval Lord of Heaven gasped in unison.
<br><br>
Before they could recover from the shocking news, Fuxi asked a direct question, "Where is Master Kincaid right now? Why isn't he here?"
<br><br>
The sole reason behind them coming to the altar was to look for the Human Spirit King.
<br><br>
But Zen came out alone shrouded in heavy armor and wielding a sword. It didn't make any sense. What was going on? "Zen has placed Master Kincaid in his Sumeru Space. He hasn't awakened yet," Corbett sighed.
<br><br>
After being exposed to the truth, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess were all rendered speechless as they fell into a crippling depression.
<br><br>
They had pinned all their hopes on the Human Spirit King and were at a loss for words.
<br><br>
They each had sacrificed so much to get here, only to find out they were being used as pawns in the carefully crafted scheme of the Snake Spirit King all this while. Naturally, they felt a deep sense of helplessness overcome them as they felt their hearts sink.
<br><br>
"Let's not drop all our weapons and lay waste to all our efforts. Maybe all of this can be reversed. Maybe, Zen could win." Gonggong, who had kept silent all this while, suddenly spoke up to lift everyone's spirits. "Don't underestimate him and his talent to turn the tables in his favor. He has inherited the powerful ancestry-level bloodline. Don't be so pessimistic."
<br><br>
"There are many powerful warriors in our sect, and each of them has inherited the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline, but in the end, they still suffered the same fate and ended up like this," Corbett said, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"No, Master Corbett, you misunderstood what I said. Zen didn't inherit the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline. He has inherited the complete ancestry-level bloodline itself."
<br><br>
Perhaps Corbett was still in a daze from his recent awakening, which clouded his thoughts. After taking a few seconds to process what he just heard, Corbett blurted out abruptly, "Wait. What? Are you telling me he has inherited the complete ancestry-level bloodline? Are you serious?"
<br><br>
"Yeah, he's telling the truth," the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded along as he responded.
<br><br>
"Are you absolutely sure about this?" Corbett was still in a state of utter disbelief.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven stepped forward to place his hand on Corbett's shoulder and responded to clear the air, "As Eternal Realm warriors, we know that clearly. There's no doubt about it. Zen can use the power of the four quadrants at will, which is given by the ancestry-level bloodline."
<br><br>
Just as those words escaped the mouth of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Corbett's eyes lit up as though they regained their lost vitality.
<br><br>
"No wonder! No wonder he defeated Master Kincaid. That sword... Yes! There's a chance he could win with that sword!" Corbett spoke in a highpitched voice, unable to hide the excitement sprouting within him.
<br><br>
Swoosh! At this moment, the irregular heavy sword that Zen wielded began to reflect strong emotions of fury and anger through its demeanor.
<br><br>
Although it couldn't speak, it was capable of transmitting human emotions. It could feel anger and sadness.
<br><br>
Face to face with the culprit responsible for the death of the Human Spirit King, the irregular heavy sword was brimming with unparalleled rage.
<br><br>
"You want to kill him, don't you?" Zen addressed the irregular heavy sword as he felt its emotions from its behavior.
<br><br>
Immediately after hearing what Zen had to say, the irregular heavy sword responded with a hint of joy as if to confirm what he felt.
<br><br>
"I can understand your thirst for vengeance. I feel the same way," Zen said as he smiled warmly while tightening his grip on the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
When he looked up, the Snake Spirit King had vanished from where he once stood.
<br><br>
Without wasting a single moment, Zen quickly passed the space of over ten thousand feet to close the distance between him and the Snake Spirit King. As if to assert his dominance over it, he raised the irregular heavy sword and pointed its end towards the Snake Spirit King's forehead.
<br><br>
"Show me what you got," Zen said as he challenged the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Buzz! The surface of the irregular heavy sword suddenly cracked up.
<br><br>
The sword itself was forged using fifteen pieces of Life Iron.
<br><br>
Ever since it was brought back from the Deep Space by Kincaid, not once was it used up to its full potential.
<br><br>
The reason was simple. For it to cultivate its maximum strength, it needed to absorb the bloodline power, but it was difficult for Kincaid to nurture it although he was powerful.
<br><br>
But now, it was continuously absorbing Zen's bloodline power. The high reserves of power contained within the complete ancestry-level was inexhaustible. It could absorb it to maintain its maximum strength without having to worry about it ever being depleted, making its overall strength second to none.
<br><br>
Buzz! A vortex shaped energy appeared in the center of the fifteen pieces of Life Iron and sucked the huge body of the Snake Spirit King into it.
<br><br>
"Destroy him!"
<br><br>
Zen moved swiftly and approached the Snake Spirit King at an incredible speed. In a fleeting moment, he activated the irregular heavy sword and released the vortex shaped energy in an instant.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King was not a small fly who would let Zen's first move to decide his fate.
<br><br>
The Limited Omnipotent Stone was completely focused on Zen.
<br><br>
Every detail of the way Zen moved, such as how his hair danced to the rhythm of the wind, and how his heart beat faster every time he felt an adrenaline rush, constantly flowed into the Snake Spirit King's mind.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Space Guiding Stone lit up and began to flicker with a blue light.
<br><br>
"Endless Space!"
<br><br>
Layers upon layers of space constantly appeared in an endless loop, enveloping the massive body of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Ten layers, a hundred layers, a thousand layers, ten thousand layers...
<br><br>
As a Holy Item, the Space Guiding Stone had the absolute priority to utilize the energy of the holy pillar.
<br><br>
When the stone began to use the power of the pillar, the countless Other Shore Tokens on the Other Shore began to dim down as though they were rid of their usual essence. They temporarily lost the support of the pillar.
<br><br>
Some Other Shore Realm masters began to suspect a change in their Other Shore Tokens as they felt their energy drain out enough to make them useless. To substitute that lost energy in the Other Shore Tokens, they tried to inject some from the divine crystals. However, even the energy that the divine crystals harnessed disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
The Endless Space was solidified to an extended degree.
<br><br>
However, the moment the vortex shaped energy touched it, the Snake Spirit King couldn't resist the pressure and was quickly swept into it by force, causing him to spin rapidly in the air.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he spun tens of thousands of times, and his long body kept on twisting and turning helplessly.
<br><br>
At the same time, countless spiral cracks appeared on the surface of the Endless Space.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Suddenly, three deafening sounds were heard, and the Endless Space was broken. Even so, the Snake Spirit King's body was still spinning against his will at a high speed. Even though his body had been twisted to pieces, it refused to halt its movement. It was as if it was a piece of cloth that was helplessly being swept away in the strong wind.
<br><br>
"This sword..."
<br><br>
Watching this scene unravel before his eyes, Zen couldn't help but feel awestruck.
<br><br>
Both he and the sword used the power of the ancestry-level bloodline, but the sword seemed to have a lot more knowledge than him about it, and even more so than the ancestry-level bloodline itself.
<br><br>
The vortex that appeared to be nothing short of ordinary actually held such high reserves of power! Chapter 4213 Wrong Evaluation Treacherous Beings' bodies were quite resilient. Even if they were torn to shreds, they wouldn't die, let alone be twisted.
<br><br>
Splash! Amidst the howling wind, the Snake Spirit King finally broke free.
<br><br>
His huge snake body was like a long, vicious whip as it ruthlessly lashed at the ground. With a crisp sound, the entire Jade Pure Realm trembled under the impact, and Cornelius sank into the ground.
<br><br>
Zen shook the hilt of his sword slightly, urging the fifteen pieces of Life Iron to return to their original positions to form the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Taking a step forward, Zen suddenly appeared right above the head of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"The second strike!"
<br><br>
Before the Snake Spirit King could get up from the ground, Zen had already thrust his sword downward.
<br><br>
Buzz! The power of the ancestry-level bloodline was once again released, channeled through the irregular long sword.
<br><br>
The cracks on the irregular heavy sword burst forth a blue light. It possessed more than ten abilities from the space-time quadrant.
<br><br>
Now, neither Zen nor the ancestry-level bloodline had a clue how the irregular heavy sword would act out.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline only needed to provide energy, while Zen only needed to thrust the sword out.
<br><br>
The rest was left to the irregular heavy sword itself.
<br><br>
Pop! The tip of the irregular heavy sword's blade connected with the Snake Spirit King's forehead.
<br><br>
Immediately after, palm-sized blue triangle patterns appeared all over the surface of the Snake Spirit King's body.
<br><br>
From his huge head to his wriggling tail, tens of millions of blue triangles lit up.
<br><br>
While Zen was confused at the sight of these countless blue triangles, the Snake Spirit King felt a trace of panic.
<br><br>
Then, the blue triangles began to split apart.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the Snake Spirit King disintegrated into tens of millions of triangles! "So fast!" Zen exclaimed.
<br><br>
Previously, when he used the Blood-controlling Method to activate the ancestry-level bloodline, he could also achieve a similar effect. However, he'd never imagined he'd be able to cut the huge snake's body into countless pieces! Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! Although the Snake Spirit King was cut into tens of millions of pieces, he didn't accept defeat just yet. The triangles quickly transformed into small black and white snakes, all of which gathered in one spot to merge into one complete body.
<br><br>
As soon as the Snake Spirit King recovered, Zen appeared in front of him again. Zen didn't plan on giving him any room to breathe.
<br><br>
"The third strike!"
<br><br>
Once more, the irregular heavy sword absorbed the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
From the cracks of the fifteen pieces of Life Iron, two colors, green and gray, flickered alternately. These were the six abilities of the creation quadrant and the life quadrant.
<br><br>
Zen watched expectantly, his eyes flashing with curiosity. He wanted to know what kind of theurgy the irregular heavy sword would unleash.
<br><br>
It wasn't just him. Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others were squirming with excitement, overjoyed at how this battle was turning out.
<br><br>
Previously, the Snake Spirit King had used the Space Guiding Stone to suppress all of them. It was simply too depressing, as they felt they didn't stand a chance.
<br><br>
Now, as they watched Zen beat up the Snake Spirit King, they felt a sense of relief and hope.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Snake Spirit King felt the opposite; now, he was the depressed one.
<br><br>
It was too discouraging, being beaten to a pulp by a mere human. This had never happened in tens of millions of years! Of course, the Snake Spirit King knew that this was all because of that irregular heavy sword. Back then, it was not that powerful in the hands of Kincaid.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King hissed, finally counterattacking.
<br><br>
Clouds of black mist suddenly burst out from the black round gem, and destructive power poured out like crazy.
<br><br>
Now, Zen had a very keen sense of discerning energy.
<br><br>
He could tell that the energy contained in the black mist was so terrifying that he had no choice but to retreat.
<br><br>
Splash! A black light column shot out from the clouds of black mist, heading straight for Zen's head.
<br><br>
As the black light column descended, the Space Guiding Stone flashed with a blue light. The space around Zen suddenly felt extremely viscous.
<br><br>
Swish! Before Zen could retreat, the black light column hit his body, completely enveloping him.
<br><br>
When the black light dissipated, Zen was nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King studied his surroundings suspiciously, and even the Limited Omnipotent Stone searched crazily. However, they still weren't able to locate Zen.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King frowned slightly, trying to calm himself down.
<br><br>
According to the black light, Zen should've been able to defeat Kincaid and bring out the sword smoothly after entering the altar.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was confident he could easily defeat Zen and take back the sword.
<br><br>
This was his plan originally.
<br><br>
However, Zen's strength vastly exceeded his expectations.
<br><br>
This countered what the black light said! Did the black light make a mistake? Or could it have lied to him? These thoughts raced through the Snake Spirit King's mind as he desperately tried to locate Zen.
<br><br>
It would've been fine if this was all a mistake.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King knew the strength of the black light. If it attacked, no matter how strong Zen was, he wouldn't stand a chance.
<br><br>
If the black light had lied to him, however, the situation would be troublesome.
<br><br>
Buzz! Nearby, Zen's figure appeared, but as soon as he did, a black light column shot towards him.
<br><br>
Boom! The black light column pierced through Zen's shadow and hit the ground.
<br><br>
Buzz! In the next moment, Zen's figure flashed from behind the Snake Spirit King, and the black light column shot towards him once again.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! With the power of the Limited Omnipotent Stone, no matter where Zen appeared, the Snake Spirit King could always find out in an instant and attack him with the black light column.
<br><br>
"That black gem is very powerful," Zen commented, as he appeared briefly from behind the Snake Spirit King once more.
<br><br>
"Shouldn't it consume a lot of Other Shore Power?"
<br><br>
This time, even though the Snake Spirit King knew where Zen was, he didn't use the black light column, or else it would hit him.
<br><br>
The energy of Holy Items was limited.
<br><br>
The Limited Omnipotent Stone, the Space Guiding Stone and this black gem consumed a lot of energy of the holy pillar.
<br><br>
When the Snake Spirit King used these three Holy Items, most of the Other Shore Tokens could not be used properly.
<br><br>
"So what? The energy of the holy pillar is much more than you think. I can catch you before the energy is exhausted!" Once the Snake Spirit King finished speaking, the Space Guiding Stone flashed again with a blue light.
<br><br>
Zen, who had been travelling through space, was forced out.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! This was the opportunity that the Snake Spirit King had been waiting for.
<br><br>
Countless space walls surrounded Zen. Simultaneously, the black light column enveloped him.
<br><br>
"There's no escaping this!"
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King cried excitedly.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! This time, the black light column poured into Zen's body for a few breathless moments.
<br><br>
Through the Limited Omnipotent Stone, the Snake Spirit King could feel that Zen's body was slowly being eroded and melted, till it finally disappeared.
<br><br>
His biggest trouble was solved! The Snake Spirit King was overjoyed.
<br><br>
But at this moment, Zen's voice sounded from behind the Snake Spirit King. "I forgot to tell you that your Limited Omnipotent Stone is actually very easy to deceive."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was confused, about to turn his head towards the voice.
<br><br>
However, just as he was turning around, the irregular heavy sword once again pressed against his back, and his body was instantly cut into tens of millions of pieces.
<br><br>
At the same time, the blazing white Light of Annihilation surged out like a tidal wave.
<br><br>
Under the erosion of the Light of Annihilation, the Snake Spirit King's broken body collapsed rapidly.
<br><br>
Chapter 4214 Bestowed Strength When Zen left the stone hall, he had cut a Holy Stone from the wall.
<br><br>
It was a Holy Stone of the highest grade, even if it was just the size of a fist. The Light of Annihilation it released was extremely powerful.
<br><br>
Zen's own Holy Stone probably wouldn't be able to kill such a huge Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buckling under the intensity of the Light of Annihilation, the Snake Spirit King's body collapsed. The three gemstones went down with him, vanishing into thin air.
<br><br>
From the altar, the Snake Goddess and the others were so excited that they almost jumped up and down from happiness.
<br><br>
After all, according to their original plan, the human race was not supposed to fight against the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's main opponent was the Monkey Spirit King, which was their strongest trump card.
<br><br>
After the Monkey Spirit King was defeated and worse, cursed, they had lost their trump card. Theoretically, they had already been defeated.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, at the most critical moment, Zen emerged from the altar with a sword that overpowered the Snake Spirit King! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! After the Space Guiding Stone disappeared, the cubic spaces it had created began to lose their power.
<br><br>
The square spaces that trapped Manuel and Tearrag were the first to explode. They regained their freedom.
<br><br>
It took some struggling before their bodies returned to their original shapes.
<br><br>
"It was suffocating me!"
<br><br>
"Finally, I can breathe!"
<br><br>
"That's the least important part! Zen of the human race has defeated the Snake Spirit King!"
<br><br>
While they might've been imprisoned, they were still able to observe the fight. They both witnessed how Zen easily defeated the Snake Spirit King with a series of inconceivable attacks.
<br><br>
The Snake Masters and snake spirits were stunned and confused.
<br><br>
In particular, Sewell, Balfour, and the other Snake Masters were at a loss, since they were still under the impression that this was part of the Snake Spirit King's plan.
<br><br>
After all, letting Zen take out that sword was part of his plan.
<br><br>
Logically speaking, the Snake Spirit King should have had a way to take back the sword, so why was he defeated? This was too strange! However, no one made a move just yet. The Snake Masters, Monkey Masters, and Bird Masters were not in a hurry to fight. After all, they were not the key to the success of this battle, but Zen and the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
After finally defeating the Snake Spirit King, Zen looked up.
<br><br>
A transparent ball was floating there, and the Snake Spirit King's coordinates were hidden within it.
<br><br>
If he wanted to completely kill off the Snake Spirit King, he had to destroy this ball.
<br><br>
"Zen! That ball has a special power to protect it," the Snake Goddess cautioned.
<br><br>
Previously, the Monkey Spirit King had gathered all the power contained in the necklace of teeth, almost destroying the ball and the coordinates within it.
<br><br>
However, at that critical moment, a black light suddenly appeared and enveloped it. Both the ball itself and the black light were very strange.
<br><br>
"A special power?"
<br><br>
Zen fixed his eyes on the ball.
<br><br>
He could see the coordinates within the ball flashing with golden light.
<br><br>
They contained a lot of energy, but the Snake Spirit King hadn't come back to life yet.
<br><br>
Zen took a few steps forward and waved his irregular heavy sword, its blade arcing gracefully in the air.
<br><br>
A beam of half-moon-shaped sword radiance shot towards the ball.
<br><br>
There was nothing special about this sword radiance, but it should've been powerful enough to cut off the Snake Spirit King's body.
<br><br>
Swish! In the blink of an eye, the sword radiance had traveled tens of thousands of feet till it hit the ball.
<br><br>
But the ball didn't react, as though it didn't exist. The sword radiance penetrated through it without a sound.
<br><br>
Zen blinked. He wasn't surprised. Raising his heavy irregular sword, he whispered, "I'm counting on you."
<br><br>
He could feel that the irregular heavy sword was eager to have a try.
<br><br>
It was more than willing to end the Snake Spirit King's life.
<br><br>
The power of space contained in the ball was quite mysterious and ever elusive, even the Bird Spirit King, who was proficient in the space rules, couldn't understand it.
<br><br>
However, Zen felt confident. The ancestry-level bloodline had a complete space-time quadrant. No matter how special the space power was, it couldn't avoid the ninety-three abilities in the space-time quadrant! Moreover, the irregular heavy sword could exert the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline to the extreme. Breaking the ball didn't pose a challenge to him.
<br><br>
Zen took a step backward, gearing up to slash another sword strike.
<br><br>
Blue light flashed through the cracks on the heavy sword, and a mysterious space aura emanated from it, permeating the atmosphere.
<br><br>
It was just as Zen had thought, the irregular heavy sword had used as many as nineteen abilities of the space-time quadrant.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to slash forward, Sewell in the distance suddenly charged straight at him.
<br><br>
Although he knew he was no match for Zen, he had to at least try to save the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Zen frowned, seeing Sewell from the corner of his eye. He took a step forward, and his figure appeared behind Sewell in a flash, like a ghost.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, he brandished the irregular long sword.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! The sounds of swift sword slashes rang out.
<br><br>
Before he could even cry out, Sewell's body had been cut into tens of thousands of triangles.
<br><br>
Zen immediately took out the Holy Stone from his Sumeru Space, activated it, and released the Light of Annihilation. Sewell's body rapidly collapsed.
<br><br>
The other Snake Masters gasped. Sewell was one of the top masters among Treacherous Beings.
<br><br>
Before, Sewell had managed to make a scene on the Night View Island on his own.
<br><br>
Now, facing Zen, he didn't even last for a few seconds! When the Monkey Masters, such as Manuel, Tearrag and Hagar saw this scene, they trembled slightly. Since they were always the bellicose ones, they couldn't help but compare themselves to Sewell.
<br><br>
They had always been keenly aware of the gap between their strength and Sewell's. After all, they had been staying on the Night View Island for so many years.
<br><br>
If they were to face Zen, they would probably lose even more miserably.
<br><br>
At this moment, they felt lucky and heaved sighs of relief. Fortunately for them, Zen had gone to the Night View Island and sided with them.
<br><br>
After killing Sewell, Zen once again held up his long sword.
<br><br>
Splash! The sword radiance, which had gathered the power of nineteen abilities of the space-time quadrant, flashed and went straight for the floating ball.
<br><br>
While the sword radiance wasn't particularly fast, the ball made no attempt to dodge it.
<br><br>
Crack! This time, the sword radiance, which contained the power of space, did not penetrate through the ball, but made a cut on its surface.
<br><br>
Crack! Hairline cracks appeared on the surface of the ball, slowly climbing along its sides.
<br><br>
The ball was sturdier than Zen had imagined, so without any hesitation, he slashed out more sword radiance at it.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, from within the ball, a fierce dispute was taking place within the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.
<br><br>
"You asked me to release that guy, but now, he's about to finish me off! You have to give me more strength! Otherwise, we will die together!"
<br><br>
At death's door, the Snake Spirit King was extremely desperate.
<br><br>
By now, they could hear the sound of the ball breaking. The Snake Spirit King grew even more nervous and started shouting, "That guy is attacking the ball!"
<br><br>
However, the black light remained silent.
<br><br>
It had been giving orders to the Snake Spirit King behind the scenes this whole time.
<br><br>
However, after Zen took out that sword, the black light had felt that the Snake Spirit King was of no more use to it.
<br><br>
It could easily take over the Other Shore and the primitive land built by the Snake Spirit King. After all, Cornelius had only gotten thus far thanks to it.
<br><br>
Thus, it had decided that it was a good choice to let the Snake Spirit King die in Zen's hands.
<br><br>
However, while the Snake Spirit King was begging, the black light changed its mind. "Don't worry. Of course I won't watch you die."
<br><br>
"Then what should I do?"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King heaved a sigh of relief, satisfied that the black light finally responded.
<br><br>
"Show your full strength," the black light said calmly.
<br><br>
"But my strength is not enough to face him," the Snake Spirit King said in confusion.
<br><br>
"It's enough now," the black light responded cryptically.
<br><br>
Buzz! The Snake Spirit King's coordinates were originally pure golden, but after the black light finished speaking, pure black light beams crawled around the coordinates like deathly earthworms.
<br><br>
Chapter 4215 Fast Speed Of all the features and theurgies of the Space Guiding Stone, the space ball was the most astonishing one.
<br><br>
Since he hadn't even thought of analyzing the structure of the space ball, Zen was attacking the sphere blindly with the heavy sword.
<br><br>
He also unleashed powerful sword radiance with every attack. However, that only caused a little bit of damage to the space ball.
<br><br>
However, Zen didn't get frustrated.
<br><br>
Although the process was slow, he could see his progress. The first time he brandished his sword, a crack appeared on the space ball.
<br><br>
When he launched his second attack, the crack expanded and reached a bit further.
<br><br>
By his third hit, the entire sphere was looking like a spider's web of cracks.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't going to give up now.
<br><br>
He waved his sword for the fifth time, and the space ball broke into several tiny pieces.
<br><br>
It had taken him just five blows to destroy the space ball.
<br><br>
The second he succeeded in doing that, the golden coordinates turned black.
<br><br>
When he noticed that the Snake Spirit King's coordinates had changed color, Zen waved his sword at them once again. "Let's end this." He smiled.
<br><br>
'Without the protection of the space ball, I am sure that these coordinates will vanish after I hit them, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
"Is it over?"
<br><br>
"Is the damned Snake Spirit King finally going to die?"
<br><br>
"What's going on with his coordinates? Why did they become pitch black? Is something going to happen?"
<br><br>
The human spirits, the Monkey Masters, and the Bird Masters were all excited and nervous simultaneously as they stared at the sword radiance and the fight that seemed to be tipping in Zen's favor.
<br><br>
Just as the sword radiance had reached the coordinates, a black blade suddenly popped out from them.
<br><br>
The blade collided with the sword radiance and a loud metallic sound was heard.
<br><br>
To everyone's immense surprise, the black blade immediately destroyed the sword radiance.
<br><br>
Then a black snake slowly emerged from the coordinates. This was none other than the Snake Spirit King himself.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King had become much smaller than before now, although he was slightly bigger than Sewell. Regardless of his size, his appearance had changed a lot.
<br><br>
The snake's body had also turned pure black, just like the coordinates.
<br><br>
Also, he was not just a snake now. He had grown a pair of locust's legs as sharp as a knife and a halberd-shaped spike was on his tail.
<br><br>
"My king!"
<br><br>
"Our king is still alive!"
<br><br>
"Oh yeah!"
<br><br>
The Snake Masters and the snake spirits had lost all hope upon seeing the space ball destroyed. They had been devoured by sorrow and despair at the thought that the Snake Spirit King could not come back to life now.
<br><br>
What was more, Zen had taken out Sewell with a single strike. They were aware of what would happen to them if things didn't go their king's way.
<br><br>
It was beyond their dreams that not only would the king be alive, but also come out to defend against Zen's moves.
<br><br>
Naturally, they were thrilled.
<br><br>
"Hang on! What is that?"
<br><br>
"The Snake Spirit King has changed his form!"
<br><br>
"He looks more powerful than before!"
<br><br>
The people on the altar were surprised to see the improvements in the king's body.
<br><br>
The now small-looking Snake Spirit King came down like a leaf and stood in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Hiss! The Snake Spirit King brought out his forked tongue.
<br><br>
His golden, slated eyes were filled with a strong will of hatred. At the same time, there was also a hint of pleasure in his eyes.
<br><br>
"It looks like I should thank you for giving me such powers," the Snake Spirit King hissed.
<br><br>
He could feel that he was much stronger than he had ever been before, even if his size did not betray it.
<br><br>
There were no words which could describe the amount of his newly acquired strength.
<br><br>
He had obtained a power that was much stronger than any creature of the main world had ever imagined of. His power was now of such magnitude that finding it was only possible in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
However, he was displeased with the black light.
<br><br>
'Since the black light possesses such strength, why didn't I get it earlier?' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
"This power is not yours," Zen said, as if he had read his mind.
<br><br>
With his extraordinary abilities to perceive his opponent, he easily saw that the Snake Spirit King was several times stronger than before now. He had a feeling that his opponent could easily pose a threat to him in this condition.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the heavy sword in Zen's hand shook slightly. But it was not his reaction of fear. Neither was it the sword's reaction of fear. The weapon was excited.
<br><br>
As an entity from the fifth-grade world, it had once confronted and even lost to the power that the Snake Spirit King had newly acquired. And it had also managed to defeat that power and destroy it once before.
<br><br>
And although it had won, the Deep Space had lost.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was no wonder that the sword was thrilled to meet this power again.
<br><br>
"Doesn't matter whether it belongs to me or not. What matters is that you will..." As the Snake Spirit King spoke, he morphed into a huge black shadow and approached Zen. "Die at my hands," he continued.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! The Snake Spirit King attacked Zen with his legs.
<br><br>
"How is that even possible?"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened in shock.
<br><br>
'I can't believe this. The Snake Spirit King is fast enough for me to be unable to see his movements at all.
<br><br>
How is that possible? I pride myself on being able to withstand and foresee attacks no matter how fast my opponent is.
<br><br>
But the Snake Spirit King's speed is beyond my imagination. It's almost impossible for me to dodge his attack, ' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
He himself could not have stopped the attack but at that very moment, the irregular heavy sword in his hand began to move on its own.
<br><br>
It gently came up to resist the Snake Spirit King's attacks as if it had a mind of its own.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't doing anything, but his hand was waving the heavy sword.
<br><br>
This was not something he could control.
<br><br>
Whoever saw them was shocked by what was happening, including Zen himself.
<br><br>
His right hand, which was holding the irregular sword was nowhere to be seen, and so was the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
All anyone could see was two unnoticeable shadows intertwined and hitting each other non-stop. Meanwhile, metallic sounds reached their ears. In the blink of an eye, the heavy sword had gone countless rounds with the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
"They are so fast!" Fuxi remarked in surprise.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was staring at Zen with a trace of worry in her eyes.
<br><br>
"Something is wrong. It looks like Zen is at a loss and his hand is out of his control!"
<br><br>
"Yes, he is..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven responded.
<br><br>
"Master Corbett, do you have any idea what's going on with them? Have you ever seen the Snake Spirit King in such a form?" the Snake Goddess asked in a respectful tone.
<br><br>
Corbett looked at the scene and surveyed it with a frown. "I've met someone with the power that the Snake Spirit King is using. I was in Deep Space at that time," he replied.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Four Spirits Sect had been rather keen on exploring the Deep Space in the past. They had gone far and wide.
<br><br>
After all, the ancestry-level bloodline and the holy pillars of the Four Spirits Sect themselves had originated from the Deep Space. It was known to everyone that there were many amazing things out there.
<br><br>
As Kincaid's personal servant, Corbett had been lucky enough to enter the Deep Space once.
<br><br>
"Although the place I went to with my master is only the outermost part of the Deep Space, it was still full of dangers. We ran into a black locust there. It had a pair of legs as sharp as knives. The aura it emitted was quite similar to the one the Snake Spirit King is emitting right now," Corbett told them.
<br><br>
"Which means the new power that he has acquired is most likely from the Deep Space?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven remarked with a vacant expression. "Hang on. That also means the power of the Snake Spirit King is now much better than that of any creature in the entire main world?"
<br><br>
Corbett nodded his head. "Most likely!" he confirmed.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others gasped in astonishment.
<br><br>
They had clearly heard the conversation between Zen and the Snake Spirit King just now.
<br><br>
'The Snake Spirit King has got some new power from someone that is not of this world.
<br><br>
Who gave it to him? When did it happen? Was it really some powerful being from the Deep Space?' A million questions ran through their minds.
<br><br>
They had initially thought that the battle would come to an end as soon as the Snake Spirit King died. But that assumption had turned out to be wrong. Now, things were looking to be more complicated than they had imagined.
<br><br>
Clung! Clung! Clung! On the other side, crisp sounds would continuously ring out around Zen and the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Under the control of the irregular heavy sword, Zen was brandishing it and resisting the attacks of the Snake Spirit King involuntarily. Suddenly, the Snake Spirit King made a sly move, and Zen staggered, almost falling down due to the heavy sword.
<br><br>
However, he knew what he had to do. No matter what, he held on to the sword tightly and didn't drop it.
<br><br>
Although the sword was incredibly strong, it needed the ancestry-level bloodline to provide it with the energy it needed to continue fighting.
<br><br>
Once he dropped the sword, it would immediately run out of energy within ten seconds. Maybe even less since it was facing the Snake Spirit King's attacks. And then, Zen would be ripped into bits by the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Chapter 4216 Probability Extreme Form Zen wore a grim expression, failing to see the attacks from both sides clearly.
<br><br>
Although the irregular heavy sword was able to protect him, Zen knew it would take a toll on it if it suffered attacks all the time.
<br><br>
"How are you able to make the sword block each strike?" Zen asked the ancestry-level bloodline, clenching the irregular heavy sword tightly. "The way the Snake Spirit King's body moves is unique, I can't understand it. I can't seem to predict his next move..."
<br><br>
There were two types of movement in the chaos: the first was to use explosive speed, and the other was to use spatial transference.
<br><br>
Any bodily movement skill or any space theurgy fell under these two kinds of movement, but it was possible for each one to differ, since anyone could use them differently.
<br><br>
However, the way the Snake Spirit King moved didn't seem to belong to either of the two types of movement.
<br><br>
Gritting his teeth, Zen attempted to use his spiritual sense to see if he could capture the Snake Spirit King's trajectory. Just moments earlier, Zen thought that the Snake Spirit King was going to attack him head on, but a split second later, he suddenly appeared behind Zen. Just when he felt the black blades slashing at his face, the next moment, they appeared above his head.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King seemed to exist in a special space outside Zen's comprehension, since all the attacks came at him at random. There was just no possible way for him to predict the Snake Spirit King's next move.
<br><br>
"But your sword can," the ancestry-level bloodline replied, reading his mind.
<br><br>
"My sword..."
<br><br>
Zen examined the irregular heavy sword closely.
<br><br>
He could vividly feel the sword's strong fighting intent-- in fact, the sword's emotions were so strong that even Zen felt like he was full of fighting intent.
<br><br>
The sword seemed to have fallen into a state of madness as it desperately chased after the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was hesitating, Corbett, who was standing at the top of the altar, suddenly took a few steps forward.
<br><br>
"Master Corbett, what are you doing?" the Snake Goddess cried.
<br><br>
"I have to remind him," Corbett replied, his eyes trained on Zen in the distance. "Master Kincaid once said that the strength of this sword always matches that of its master."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, his curiosity piqued.
<br><br>
"The stronger the warrior who holds the sword is, the greater the power of the sword," Corbett spoke, almost as though in a daze. "Master Kincaid was filled with regret many times, since he felt he was unable to bring out the sword's full potential."
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid didn't know how to use the sword? Why couldn't he use its full strength?" the Snake Goddess asked dubiously.
<br><br>
"No, Master Kincaid knew this sword very well," Corbett replied. "He said that he and this sword had become one, but he always thought the sword deserved someone better."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed excitedly. "Are you saying that even Master Kincaid didn't deserve this sword, even on his level of strength? What about the power of the ancestry-level bloodline?"
<br><br>
Corbett smiled. "Master Kincaid has tried, but he couldn't control the ancestry-level bloodline."
<br><br>
"But Zen can!" the Snake Goddess said excitedly.
<br><br>
"Yes." Corbett nodded. "But he doesn't completely control the sword."
<br><br>
Zen could only communicate with and passively provide energy for the irregular heavy sword. However, the irregular heavy sword acted on its own, and Zen had no control over it.
<br><br>
So this whole time, Zen was being helplessly dragged by the sword all throughout the battle. It was almost as though he were a burden to the sword.
<br><br>
"Then, what should we do now?" the Snake Goddess frowned.
<br><br>
"I need to remind him!" As he spoke, Corbett took a few more steps forward. Standing at the edge of the stairs at the top of the altar, he shouted, "Zen, although Master Kincaid's sword has acknowledged you, you haven't really controlled it yet!"
<br><br>
At this moment, Zen had been deep in thought, trying to think of solutions. When he heard what Corbett said, his brows shot up in astonishment. "I haven't really controlled this sword? I'm already connected to it, what more do I need to do to be able to control it?"
<br><br>
Just as Corbett was about to answer him, the voice of the Snake Spirit King suddenly boomed. "Shut up!"
<br><br>
Then, the black blades flew towards Corbett.
<br><br>
Clatter, clatter, clatter...
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King wielded the black blades to cut a hundred times. In the blink of an eye, Corbett was sliced into countless, tiny white pieces.
<br><br>
Corbett was tens of thousands of feet away from Zen, yet the Snake Spirit King managed to cut him up and return back to Zen in a flash.
<br><br>
How fast he moved was absolutely terrifying.
<br><br>
Even the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others standing behind couldn't help but take a few cautious steps backward.
<br><br>
Only Gonggong stood still, his hands clasped behind his back.
<br><br>
He was keenly aware that they were in no condition to face the Snake Spirit King, and that trying to escape was futile. Thus, he decided to just stay calm.
<br><br>
After all, Corbett was a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
It didn't take long before the countless, thin white pieces gathered together and merged to form Corbett's figure. Continuing where he left off, he started to shout again. "It's not what you think it is. Zen, you can treat the irregular heavy sword as a cultivation method in an ancient book. You have to truly understand it..."
<br><br>
"An ancient book, understand it..."
<br><br>
Zen echoed under his breath. His heartbeat quickened as he held the sword tightly. Perhaps he had underestimated the sword, maybe that was why the Snake Spirit King was so eager to obtain it! Since he had faith that the irregular heavy sword would protect him, he fused his spiritual sense into the sword.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
Once there, he saw a red ball of light.
<br><br>
One hundred and forty light dots surrounded the ball of light, and from these light dots extended countless, densely-packed thin lines.
<br><br>
Zen observed it for a while. He soon discovered that whenever the ancestry-level bloodline injected energy into the irregular heavy sword, the energy surged to the light dots following along the different thin lines.
<br><br>
Some of the light spots became incomparably bright after they obtained energy, while others became dim.
<br><br>
One hundred and forty dots of light...
<br><br>
One hundred and forty...
<br><br>
As Zen pondered over this number, turning it over in his mind, his eyes suddenly lit up as it finally dawned on him.
<br><br>
"One hundred and forty! The number of the types of energy in the Deep Space!"
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline once told Zen that there were eighty-six types of energy in the sixth-grade world, while there were one hundred and forty types in the fifth-grade world, otherwise known as the Stellar World. The irregular heavy sword came from the Deep Space, which was the Stellar World that the ancestry-level bloodline referred to! All this time, the sword converted the energy of the fourth-grade world into the energy of the fifth-grade world.
<br><br>
'Since the irregular heavy sword can use the energy of the fifth-grade world, then that should mean I can use it, too!' Zen thought excitedly.
<br><br>
Ever since he obtained the sword, he had only been able to feel its emotions. Although the irregular heavy sword acknowledged Zen, it still was fiercely loyal to Kincaid, believing he was its true master.
<br><br>
Even Zen thought the same. After all, it was a sword borrowed from the Human Spirit King. He knew it would be returned to him in the end.
<br><br>
But now, Zen realized that if he wanted to defeat the Snake Spirit King and the power behind him, he needed to gain control over this sword.
<br><br>
Just as Corbett had said, he needed to treat this sword as a cultivation method in an ancient book to understand it "Buzz!"
<br><br>
Zen willed his spiritual sense to reach into the red light ball in the center.
<br><br>
When it came into contact with the red light ball, Zen could feel it resisting him.
<br><br>
The irregular heavy sword was still unwilling to accept him.
<br><br>
"I know you miss your former master.
<br><br>
But only I can exert your power to the extreme," Zen gently coaxed. "You should know what kind of power I have.
<br><br>
If we want to bring Master Kincaid back to life, we have only one choice: we need to defeat the opponent in front of us! Accept me!"
<br><br>
Zen urged the sword through his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
Gradually, he felt the resistance becoming weaker and weaker.
<br><br>
Finally, Zen was able to integrate his spiritual sense with the red ball of light successfully.
<br><br>
Boom! At this moment, Zen felt as if his mind had been smashed by a heavy hammer. A massive amount of information streamed in, information about the countless permutations of the one hundred and forty light dots.
<br><br>
At the same time...
<br><br>
It also informed Zen about the energy used by the Snake Spirit King and the irregular heavy sword, and he even figured out its strange name.
<br><br>
"Probability Extreme Form!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
Then, traces of black energy streamed into Zen's body from the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Chapter 4217 Wandering In The Cloud Zen's current state had the Snake Spirit King confused as well.
<br><br>
His opponent had shifted from Zen to this sword, and as the sword dragged Zen to fight him, Zen clearly had become a burden to the sword.
<br><br>
This was good news for him as it meant that Zen was totally unable to fight back.
<br><br>
Even so, this irregular heavy sword was so sharp and fast that it was capable of keeping up with him and breaking his fierce attacks.
<br><br>
After all this time, he still could not defeat it. The Snake Spirit King was now growing impatient.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen's body turn black brought a grim expression to his face.
<br><br>
If a single sword was so difficult to deal with, how much more troublesome would Zen and the sword together be? With this in mind, he launched another onslaught of fierce attacks! Over ten thousand strikes were launched from his two black blades in a matter of only a few seconds! To everyone else, the Snake Spirit King did not exist, nor were the black blades or the irregular heavy sword visible. Even Zen's hand clutching the sword could only be seen very faintly.
<br><br>
The clanging of the black blades and the heavy sword rang over ten thousand times, louder and harsher than before. It sounded as if someone was grinding a sword on marble.
<br><br>
"Clatter, clatter, clatter..."
<br><br>
Fortunately, the warriors present were all at the Eternal Realm or above. If they had been any weaker, hearing such sounds would have probably driven them insane.
<br><br>
The irregular heavy sword finally buckled under the immense pressure of the attacks and could no longer hold off all the Snake Spirit King's strikes.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
It failed to block one of the ten thousand slashes that came at Zen and a black blade slammed ruthlessly into his heavy black armor.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
A thin crack surfaced across the armor over Zen's waist. It extended through the inner layer, allowing the blade to cut all the way through to his back! "Zen was hit!"
<br><br>
"That sword... can it not withstand the attacks anymore?"
<br><br>
"Zen seems to have fallen into some sort of trance and can't wake up..."
<br><br>
"Waking up would be useless. He couldn't avoid the blade anyway!"
<br><br>
Those on the alter discussed their thoughts with one another, with the human spirits of the Black House, the Joy House and the Broad House the most nervous among them.
<br><br>
They had not expected a human to be the one to decide the final result. As human spirits, they did all they could, which was only to watch from the sideline.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Snake Spirit King slashed out ten thousand more strikes with the blades.
<br><br>
Maintaining constant caution and defending non-stop was impossible and more like a death sentence than anything else. Inevitably, the irregular heavy sword missed two of the ten thousand strikes! "Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
This time, Zen's right shoulder was struck and hurt.
<br><br>
The wound was a foot and a half long, almost splitting Zen's body in two.
<br><br>
Any other Eternal Realm warrior would have been sliced by such a strike.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline had strengthened Zen's body greatly and so he felt close to no pain.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline began moving.
<br><br>
Green energy gushed out of the wound, madly repairing it as fast as it could.
<br><br>
Such a great amount of life energy contained powerful repairing ability, enough to almost bring a dead person back to life. However, Zen's body was so strong and sturdy that it would take a lot more than usual. This made his recovery speed much slower.
<br><br>
Three seconds later...
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King launched another ten thousand strikes! The heavy irregular sword was able to resist nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight of them, letting two through.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
They struck Zen square in the chest, breaking through the black armor, slicing his ribs and piercing into his heart.
<br><br>
The next round of the assault unleashed ten thousand strikes once more.
<br><br>
The hearts of everyone on the alter skipped a beat.
<br><br>
"What should we do! What should we do? That sword can't hold off the Snake Spirit King's attacks!"
<br><br>
"Zen's going to be dismembered!"
<br><br>
"If he keeps taking hits like this he will surely die!"
<br><br>
"Shall we help?"
<br><br>
suggested Hamilton.
<br><br>
Alphonse smiled bitterly and shook his head, "How could we help him?"
<br><br>
They couldn't even see the Snake Spirit King...
<br><br>
He was so fast, that to them Zen was fighting an invisible foe.
<br><br>
Who among them was capable of attacking an 'invisible' opponent? Manuel, Tearrag and other Monkey Masters had already rushed down while Hamilton was still stuck in thought.
<br><br>
But before they could even step out of the altar, they were hit by hundreds of strikes. They were all cut into inch-thin pieces that floated in the wind.
<br><br>
It was a spectacular scene to behold...
<br><br>
The method and skill that were used to execute the attack were beyond their comprehension.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King still had most of his attention focused on Zen when he had sliced the Monkey Masters. He had been distracted for a moment and could not break through the defense of the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Another ten thousand strikes then slashed out.
<br><br>
Zen's black armor was ripped to shreds and more and more horrific and fatal wounds appeared on his body.
<br><br>
Black energy covered his entire body as he was being stabbed over and over again.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's black blades sped up again.
<br><br>
This time, however, he pushed his power to the limit, making his ten thousand strikes even trickier to handle.
<br><br>
"Clatter, clatter, clatter..."
<br><br>
Amongst the high pitched clattering of metal, the irregular heavy sword missed over a hundred strikes this time.
<br><br>
If they were to connect with Zen's body, it'd be enough to slice him to pieces.
<br><br>
But before this could happen, Zen opened his eyes and noticed a cloud. A trace of confusion ran through his eyes.
<br><br>
It was a large black cloud with the radius of about twenty miles, covering the altar and an area in front of it.
<br><br>
Zen gained instant enlightenment when he looked at this cloud; he could appear anywhere within the range it covered.
<br><br>
Whether it be the edge of the black cloud or the center of it, he could appear in multiple places at the same time! It was a truly wondrous feeling.
<br><br>
There did not seem to be any concept of space and time within the cloud, or at the least, space and time behaved quite special.
<br><br>
Although he could be in many places at once, it was not duplicates of himself; it was all him.
<br><br>
He was capable of appearing and disappearing in several places all at once! Zen then saw quite clearly the ten positions of the Snake Spirit King, and the over a hundred strikes coming from these spots were missed by the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
They approached at deceptive angles which made them difficult to escape and made every blow fatal.
<br><br>
Once Zen understood the Probability Extreme Form, he could move through the cloud as the Snake Spirit King could. Because of this, he suddenly vanished from everyone's view.
<br><br>
His figure flashed backward continuously.
<br><br>
There was only one of him, but he appeared more than ten times in different directions. With every dash and dodge, the Snake Spirit King's strikes were inches from connecting with him.
<br><br>
Zen managed to dodge all the black blades' strikes effortlessly! He then put some distance between himself and the Snake Spirit King. For the first time, they both stopped and their figures were clear for everyone to see.
<br><br>
Zen's body might have been covered in wounds and the ancestry-level bloodline was still working double time to repair it, but he still wore a smile on his face. "Did you make this cloud? It's really something. I seem to be able to wander within it freely."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's face darkened.
<br><br>
The Probability Extreme Form had given him a huge advantage, but in such a short period of time, Zen had mastered it. He had never in his wildest dreams expected that.
<br><br>
Chapter 4218 The Disappearance Of The Bold Conjecture House Without uttering a single word, the Snake Spirit King wandered in the black cloud. Afterward, he launched another attack on Zen.
<br><br>
At this point, Zen was already seriously injured. His body was covered in cuts.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's plan was to finish Zen before he could fully recover.
<br><br>
As soon as the Snake Spirit King activated the Probability Extreme Form, a thousand creatures that looked exactly like him appeared in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Then, they all came together and charged towards Zen.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A thousand identical versions of the Snake Spirit King brandished their black blades at Zen.
<br><br>
Just a few moments ago, Zen couldn't see the Snake Spirit King's movements. But now, he was able to see them clearly.
<br><br>
There were nearly two thousand black blades hacking down at Zen. But before the blows could land on him, he suddenly vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Zen reappeared on the edge of the black cloud.
<br><br>
This time, he was not alone. There were nine hundred and ninety-nine duplicates of himself surrounding him.
<br><br>
Adding the original, there were a thousand identical Zens. They stood in a circle on the edge of the black cloud.
<br><br>
"So this is my limit? At most, I can only create nine hundred and ninetynine versions of myself," Zen muttered under his breath.
<br><br>
"It doesn't seem like I can break through..." he whispered darkly.
<br><br>
"Yes, me neither," the other nine hundred and ninety-nine duplicates replied in chorus.
<br><br>
They sounded like bees buzzing in unison.
<br><br>
"Shut up! Come and fight me!" the Snake Spirit King roared furiously.
<br><br>
He was already getting impatient.
<br><br>
He and the copies of himself dispersed simultaneously. Each of them was going to deal with a Zen.
<br><br>
Once again, the Snake Spirit King brandished and directed his black blades towards Zen. The former's copies did the same and went for Zen's copies.
<br><br>
However, Zen had a different approach.
<br><br>
Instead of fighting him head-on, Zen came up with a sensible plan.
<br><br>
Just like earlier, he disappeared again.
<br><br>
One would be unable to predict the other's movement while they were inside this black cloud.
<br><br>
Even though the Snake Spirit King had mastered the Probability Extreme Form, he still wouldn't be able to foresee Zen's next move. As a result, he and his copies didn't hit their targets.
<br><br>
After a short while, Zen reappeared in the center of the black cloud together with his nine hundred and ninety-nine copies.
<br><br>
The two of them exchanged blows back and forth once more as they activated the Probability Extreme Form at the same time.
<br><br>
The people on the altar and the snake spirits below became even more confused.
<br><br>
They couldn't see the Snake Spirit King a few seconds ago, but they could hear harsh metallic sounds echoing from the black cloud. This meant that the Snake Spirit King was still fighting Zen.
<br><br>
But now, there were no signs of Zen and the Snake Spirit King fighting at all. They couldn't hear any sound. They soon realized that the fight between them was now beyond what they could ever imagine.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute. Are they... Maybe they're fighting somewhere else? Maybe they're in a different dimension," surmised one of the people on the altar.
<br><br>
"I can't even sense their auras anymore. This is so weird!"
<br><br>
"It looks like Zen has comprehended the same bodily movement skill as the Snake Spirit King. Don't worry. I think Zen will win," Corbett hypothesized.
<br><br>
The tension in the atmosphere gradually dissipated after Zen and the Snake Spirit King disappeared.
<br><br>
Just then, Alphonse and Hamilton climbed to the top of the altar and stood in front of Corbett.
<br><br>
"Greetings, Elder Corbett," said Alphonse.
<br><br>
"Nice to meet you again, Elder Corbett..." Hamilton bowed respectfully as he said his greetings.
<br><br>
Corbett was an old servant of Kincaid. Even so, he held a high status in the Human Spirit Sect. He was even allowed to take charge of the Human Spirit Sect on behalf of the Human Spirit King.
<br><br>
The human spirits of the Joy House, the Broad House, and the Black House were all excited to see Corbett. However, they were trapped inside the space earlier. Therefore, they couldn't greet him.
<br><br>
Corbett looked at the human spirits and sighed. "Are you the only ones left in this world?"
<br><br>
"Aside from us, there are also two hundred world builders," Alphonse answered promptly.
<br><br>
The world builders were responsible for creating secondary worlds.
<br><br>
However, they didn't have high ranks in the Human Spirit Sect. Simply put, they were not core members of the sect.
<br><br>
"Are there no other members of our sect left?" Corbett inquired once again.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, there are none," Alphonse replied.
<br><br>
The human spirits of the Joy House, the Broad House, and the Black House stayed on the Other Shore for quite some time. Even though they worked for the Snake Spirit Sect, they still searched for their kind in secret. They found that they were the only ones who survived in the world.
<br><br>
"Alas! That is quite regrettable." Corbett sighed again. He felt sorry for his own kind.
<br><br>
Alphonse remained silent and thought for a while. Afterward, he asked, "Do you want to search for the elders of the Bold Conjecture House?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I do," Corbett responded without any hesitation.
<br><br>
Within the Human Spirit Sect, the Bold Conjecture House relished the same reputation as the Ten Directions House. As a matter of fact, it played a more important role in the Human Spirit Sect than the Ten Directions House.
<br><br>
Every member of the Ten Directions House was the greatest among the entire Human Spirit Sect. For instance, the leader of the Ten Directions House was originally only slightly weaker than Kincaid. On the other hand, it was thanks to the Bold Conjecture House that the members of the Ten Directions House became such powerful.
<br><br>
The strongest human spirits in terms of brute strength would join the Ten Directions House. However, the powerful and resourceful human spirits would definitely choose to join the Bold Conjecture House.
<br><br>
When Kincaid was trapped, Corbett placed his hopes upon the Bold Conjecture House. He thought that the members of this house might be able to come up with some plan to free Kincaid.
<br><br>
However, what happened was beyond his expectations.
<br><br>
The young man who came to save Kincaid was not from the Bold Conjecture House or the Ten Directions House at all. In fact, he was not even a human spirit, but a human being. Corbett was absolutely astonished by this turn of event.
<br><br>
"It is unfortunate, but we surmise that all the members of the Bold Conjecture House had all been killed," Alphonse informed.
<br><br>
'We have been looking for them so many years. We haven't heard anything from them yet.
<br><br>
If they were not truly gone, we should have found them already, ' Alphonse thought to himself.
<br><br>
"But now, there's finally hope. This human named Zen is fighting with the Snake Spirit King. If Master Kincaid knew about it, he would be glad,"
<br><br>
Corbett said with a smile.
<br><br>
Although Zen hadn't defeated the Snake Spirit King yet, he had already saved the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
"I really hope he wins against the Snake Spirit King," added Alphonse.
<br><br>
This battle was far too important for them. Their fate rested upon Zen's shoulders.
<br><br>
After the Snake Spirit King and Zen disappeared for two minutes, they suddenly heard a loud sound echoing throughout the entire area.
<br><br>
"Are they battling again?" Hamilton asked while releasing his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
Every one of the people on the altar shivered. They looked around and unleashed their spiritual sense. Soon enough, they saw two figures on the open field in front of the altar.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King slashed at Zen with his two black blades.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen raised his heavy sword above his head to block the attack. "You have been the one delivering attacks for quite some time now. It's time for me to strike back," Zen said tauntingly.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had completely healed his wounds.
<br><br>
Therefore, he thought it was his chance to fight back.
<br><br>
He only uttered a few words before silence fell once more.
<br><br>
He and the Snake Spirit King disappeared again.
<br><br>
Out of the blue, the sound of metal colliding echoed once more.
<br><br>
"Zen has fully recovered! That's good news!"
<br><br>
"So now he's starting to retaliate?"
<br><br>
"He had sustained severe injuries earlier. Yet, he still managed to avoid all of the Snake Spirit King's attacks until now! Zen is incredible!"
<br><br>
Everyone watching the fight from the altar were quite clever. There were no details that could escape them.
<br><br>
The two of them were battling within the black cloud once again.
<br><br>
Zen and the Snake Spirit King kept delivering attacks, blocking them, or avoiding them. They never stopped moving.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, their spectators were unable to follow their actions.
<br><br>
The group of Zen's duplicates closed in on the group of the Snake Spirit King's copies.
<br><br>
Each of Zen's copies attacked its target with moves that differed from the others'.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, each of the Snake Spirit King's copies blocked the attacks and retaliated. It was like watching a well-choreographed dance.
<br><br>
The two of them had fought ten thousand rounds in just about two seconds.
<br><br>
"So, now you have comprehended the Probability Extreme Form as well.
<br><br>
But what does it matter? At most, this fight will merely result in a draw.
<br><br>
Just face it. You can't even hurt me at all." The Snake Spirit King finally spoke.
<br><br>
Zen remained calm and smiled. "Is the Probability Extreme Form all that mysterious person behind you taught you?"
<br><br>
"What are you getting at?" The Snake Spirit King stared at Zen and frowned.
<br><br>
He didn't know why Zen would say that. But he suddenly had a bad feeling about it.
<br><br>
"Truly, the theurgies from the fifth-grade world are powerful and remarkable. Such a pity. The only thing you mastered is the Probability Extreme Form," Zen replied as he gripped his sharp sword tightly.
<br><br>
Once again, energy flowed out of the cracks on his sword.
<br><br>
Chapter 4219 The Backstage Manipulator Faint green flames were now dancing on the edges of the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
They were faint, but highly viscous, like a thick liquid, slowly climbing around the sword, and then onto Zen's arms. Finally, they formed a green head.
<br><br>
The head looked horrendous, as if a ghost had crawled out of the depths of hell. It had huge horns and breathed fire.
<br><br>
Splash! As the head opened its mouth, green flames whooshed out instead of breath, and ignited the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Zen was looking at the Snake Spirit King through the green flames. He suddenly remarked, "It is theoretically impossible to get around the Probability Extreme Form.
<br><br>
I can only see one way of ending this fight. And that is no way! This fight will remain a stalemate, because we can't kill an opponent with infinite speed.
<br><br>
At the same time, maintaining the Probability Extreme Form requires extreme amounts of energy. I can exhaust you little by little as the fight progresses, but I have a better choice."
<br><br>
As soon as Zen finished speaking, he disappeared.
<br><br>
And then he reappeared immediately.
<br><br>
Using the infinite speed, space and distance were meaningless to him.
<br><br>
Even though there was quite a bit of distance between him and the Snake Spirit King, it could be said that they were overlapping.
<br><br>
Splash! The irregular heavy sword slashed down on the Snake Spirit King's head.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King also disappeared rapidly. Zen's attack did not succeed. Both sides possessed almost equal speed.
<br><br>
"Huh! Although I don't know what use those flames have, no matter how powerful they are, they can't burn me. You..."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King couldn't finish his words. He was shocked at what he was seeing.
<br><br>
A giant hole, several hundred feet in diameter had appeared in the black cloud.
<br><br>
The green flames had actually burnt through a portion of the black cloud.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen reappeared, turned around, and looked at the Snake Spirit King with a faint smile on his face.
<br><br>
"Although the Probability Extreme Form is powerful, there is still a way to restrain it.
<br><br>
And that is to utilize...
<br><br>
The Flame Extreme Form!"
<br><br>
The irregular heavy sword was not exactly a living being. Basically, it could only communicate through emotions, and what it felt or made you feel was beyond words.
<br><br>
However, Zen had obtained the ability to understand what it was trying to say.
<br><br>
Splash! Zen began to wave his irregular heavy sword in the black cloud.
<br><br>
The green flames were beginning to spread everywhere now.
<br><br>
The black cloud was hanging over them like a huge curtain. But the flames seemed to know what they were doing. In a few seconds, a large area of the cloud was burn out.
<br><br>
Zen was moving incredibly fast.
<br><br>
He could summon nine hundred and ninety-nine avatars and whip thousands of sword strikes in a flash.
<br><br>
Together, the flames were devouring the cloud like a hungry lion. The hole was now hundreds of thousands of feet long and wide.
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King roared hysterically.
<br><br>
In desperation, he pounced on Zen once again, trying to stop the man from burning down the black cloud.
<br><br>
However, in terms of speed, Zen was easily on par with the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
As long as he maintained the Probability Extreme Form and kept dodging, the Snake Spirit King would be unable to do anything to him.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Splash! With flames flowing all around it, the irregular heavy sword in Zen's hand turned into a burning stick. The flames were now rising up like a dragon.
<br><br>
A giant hole began to spread out from the center of the black cloud and was expanding surprisingly fast.
<br><br>
About five minutes later, it had already spread across two thirds of the area of the black cloud. Two more minutes and the black cloud which had been four hundred square miles in area had disappeared almost completely. Only a few fragments of it remained.
<br><br>
Even though the fragments were not connected to each other, the Snake Spirit King still had the ability to crawl within them.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.
<br><br>
The worst part was that there was no point in being anxious.
<br><br>
Pretty soon, only a small fragment about ten feet long was left, and the Snake Spirit King was trapped on it.
<br><br>
By that time, Zen had already left the black cloud, and the people on the altar could see him.
<br><br>
"Why has only Zen appeared? "
<br><br>
"Where is the Snake Spirit King?"
<br><br>
"What does he want to do?"
<br><br>
"Wait... Can you see those flames on the sword? They are so strange.
<br><br>
They flow like liquid and it's almost as if they're sentient."
<br><br>
The audience watched Zen float in one direction and wave the irregular heavy sword around him.
<br><br>
Splash! Another whip of the sword and the green flames burned the last fragment of the black cloud where the Snake Spirit King was hiding.
<br><br>
He was forced to stumble out.
<br><br>
"Hiss!"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King spat out his tongue. He looked furious at being humiliated like that.
<br><br>
The two black blades on him suddenly morphed into a string of black flowers and chopped at Zen's head.
<br><br>
However, without the black cloud, the Probability Extreme Form had become useless, and the Snake Spirit King's speed had returned back to normal.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Zen blocked his attack as if he were confronting a child.
<br><br>
And not only that, every time Zen blocked the blades, green flames would spread from his sword to the blades and engulf them.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was too focused on his attacks. Therefore, when he finished, unaware to him, the green flames had already spread all over his body.
<br><br>
The interesting thing was that the flames released by the Flame Extreme Form did not cause any burning physical pain; or at least the Snake Spirit King could not feel it. Therefore, he did not realize that he was wrapped in those flames until after he had stepped back and taken a look at himself.
<br><br>
And then he saw that Zen was standing far away from him with a faint smile on his face.
<br><br>
"Damn you!"
<br><br>
Just as the Snake Spirit King was about to rush forward again, the green flames suddenly exploded like fireworks. They burned every single part of his body.
<br><br>
The flames did not have any heat, but they still possessed an astonishing amount of destructive power.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's body was being burned bit by bit.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! It was as if his body had been laced with kerosene. As the flames continued to burn and spread, he began to collapse and shrink.
<br><br>
In less than half a minute, he had been burnt to a crisp, black death.
<br><br>
Up until now, only two ways of killing Treacherous Beings were known on the Other Shore. The first one was to be killed by the Light of Annihilation, and the second was to be completely eroded by the Void Dust. The Snake Spirit King, however, had faced his demise in a way that had never been witnessed before by anyone in any part of the world.
<br><br>
"The Snake Spirit King has been defeated once again!"
<br><br>
"Not just defeated! He was burnt to death!"
<br><br>
"How is that possible? How can Zen's flames burn him down like that?"
<br><br>
At that moment, every single Treacherous Being present there, including the Snake Masters, the snake spirits, the Bird Masters, and the Monkey Masters felt a chill run down their spines. Was it really as easy to kill them now? After all, they were all supposed to be immortal. However, if one more way of killing them had just been discovered, it meant crisis! "Is it over?" someone piped up.
<br><br>
"No, not yet. The Snake Spirit King's coordinates are still there." Came the answer.
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes turned towards the sky once again.
<br><br>
The black coordinates of the Snake Spirit King were still fixed there.
<br><br>
Zen's figure flashed and he whooshed into the sky, holding the irregular heavy sword and slashing at the black coordinates without hesitation.
<br><br>
Luckily, this wasn't supposed to be hard. Without the protection of the ball, the black coordinates couldn't resist Zen's attack.
<br><br>
However, just as the man brandished his sword, a ball of black light suddenly emerged from the coordinates. It spread out like a black hole, and at the same time, a black fist stretched out from it, slamming into the irregular heavy sword with a furious metallic clang.
<br><br>
Boom! Zen felt an irresistible force coming from the irregular heavy sword, and then he was sent flying backwards at an incredible speed. He had been thrown backwards so forcefully that he couldn't even guess how fast he was flying.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Recovering, Zen began using spatial transference. He traveled around back and forth within a distance of two hundred feet, trying to lose the attacker. He didn't stop until he had moved at least a hundred times.
<br><br>
He was not surprised at the sudden appearance of the fist, though. He looked at the black hole calmly and then said, "You gave the Snake Spirit King his power. Are you the evil backstage manipulator that ruined the Four Spirits Sect?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4220 None Of Your Business Slowly, the black fist began to emerge from the black hole.
<br><br>
Then, out came the head, followed by shoulders. A few more moments passed, and the torso and legs were also out.
<br><br>
It was a creature that had a human-like body shape. However, his head was cylindrical, and there were six pairs of indents on it. These hollow spaces were shimmering almost as they were sparkling eyes.
<br><br>
Moreover, his hands and feet were longer than those of human beings.
<br><br>
Somehow, they made him look like a moving tree.
<br><br>
As soon as he came out of the black hole, they felt a wave of pressure being released.
<br><br>
This was not the soul pressure. Yet, everyone present instantly felt that he was a formidable opponent.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess, Primeval Lord of Heaven, and others saw this black figure, their eyes began twitching uncontrollably. He looked quite terrifying that their blood froze.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, they already guessed there was someone supporting the Snake Spirit King when they saw the black light in the ball earlier.
<br><br>
But they were still shocked when the one working behind the scenes actually appeared.
<br><br>
They were even more dumbfounded when they heard Zen's question.
<br><br>
Was this creature really the one who destroyed the once mighty and invincible Four Spirits Sect? With this, the human spirits felt even more anxious and aggravated.
<br><br>
They missed the prosperous history of the Four Spirits Sect with all their hearts. At the same time, they had doubts.
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect had survived facing so many powerful existences in the main world. But why must they lose in the end? Even if the Snake Spirit King exhausted every ounce of his power, it would be impossible for him to fight with the other sects.
<br><br>
But now, they finally understood that there was a creature working behind the Snake Spirit King. This creature's power was probably way beyond what they could ever imagine.
<br><br>
"Who is he? Where the hell did he come from?" one of the human spirits couldn't help asking the question.
<br><br>
"Why did he destroy the Four Spirits Sect?"
<br><br>
"What benefits would he get from destroying the Four Spirits Sect and the main world? This is unbelievable!"
<br><br>
Corbett was trembling slightly. No matter how he thought about it, he still couldn't figure out why the creature wanted to destroy the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters, the Bird Masters, and the human spirits were all curious. What could his motive be? Now, even the Snake Masters were confused.
<br><br>
Why did such a creature appear out of nowhere? And more importantly, where was their king? Needless to say, the Snake Masters were not ignorant.
<br><br>
They knew that the Snake Spirit King's incredible power came from this creature.
<br><br>
But why did he want to destroy the Four Spirits Sect? What was his goal behind all this? Didn't the Snake Spirit King want to take a strong lead and dominate the world? If so, then why was this creature in his place? All of a sudden, they heard a loud booming noise. "Hahaha!"
<br><br>
The black humanoid creature let out such a strange sound. His laughter could be heard throughout the entire area.
<br><br>
The six pairs of eyes were focused on Zen and the irregular heavy sword in his hand.
<br><br>
"Answer me!" Zen raised his voice a little.
<br><br>
Even though the tone of his voice was eerily calm, it was still commanding.
<br><br>
"Easy, human," replied the humanoid creature leisurely. "Yes." Afterward, the entire area was silent.
<br><br>
The silence was broken when they heard a voice. "Why? Why? Why did you do that?"
<br><br>
The voice sounded anguished and enraged.
<br><br>
The one who spoke was a woman from the Joy House.
<br><br>
She was so angry that she couldn't help but demand answers.
<br><br>
It was the same question that everyone was thinking.
<br><br>
The humanoid creature looked down. Then, one of the six pairs of eyes flashed lightly.
<br><br>
Zen's eyebrows twitched as he slashed the irregular heavy sword downwards. The sword seemed as though it wanted to kill something.
<br><br>
However, his reaction was a bit slow. So, he missed whatever he wanted to cut.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, they heard that woman's scream coming from below.
<br><br>
"Ahhh!" It was such a blood-curdling scream.
<br><br>
Pain was a way for creatures to protect themselves.
<br><br>
The Treacherous Beings were tough and powerful. Therefore, it was almost impossible to cause any sharp pain to them. Even if the Light of Annihilation caused their bodies to collapse, they wouldn't make such a spine-chilling scream.
<br><br>
At once, the woman's entire body began to boil. It was as if some sort of gas had spread out from inside her body. White bubbles began to burst out of her skin. In just a few seconds, she became a mass of white mud.
<br><br>
"Oh no! What just happened?!" the human spirit closest to her screamed.
<br><br>
"Hey, what's the matter?" another one asked confusedly.
<br><br>
"What on earth is going on?"
<br><br>
The human spirits turned pale with fright. They hadn't seen anything like this before.
<br><br>
They couldn't understand how or why she died in such a brutal manner.
<br><br>
Moments after, they heard a crackling sound.
<br><br>
Everyone suddenly heard something explode from behind them.
<br><br>
As they turned around to look, they saw a bright golden light. It burst out from the coordinates floating in the center of the altar. The coordinates were burning and rapidly collapsing.
<br><br>
Someone instantly figured out what made the sound and yelled, "These are her coordinates!"
<br><br>
Everyone's face darkened. The coordinates' collapse only meant one thing.
<br><br>
She was now completely dead.
<br><br>
"Such a weak and pathetic creature doesn't deserve to get an answer." At that moment, the humanoid creature's voice echoed through the entire sky again. "It's none of your business that I want to kill all of you."
<br><br>
He merely regarded the Four Spirits Sect as nothing but tiny and helpless ants.
<br><br>
He looked down upon those insignificant and inferior creatures.
<br><br>
Zen's face darkened. He was trying so hard to contain his anger. He asked again, "Are you the downgrader?"
<br><br>
After the ancestry-level bloodline recovered, the first thing it wanted to do was find the downgrader. Therefore, Zen sought for the humanoid creature's confirmation for its sake.
<br><br>
"Yes, I am," the humanoid creature replied arrogantly.
<br><br>
"So this means you lied to the Snake Spirit King. The so-called upgrade and recovery of the main world are all just a bunch of lies, aren't they?"
<br><br>
Zen asked once more. He needed the creature to say it himself.
<br><br>
"Hahaha. Isn't it obvious already? Of course," the humanoid creature replied nonchalantly.
<br><br>
The Snake Masters were utterly bewildered when they heard this.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King vowed to bring them back to the main world and return them to their previous forms. After all, the fourth-grade world was the Snake Masters' true home. This was where they felt the most comfortable.
<br><br>
The third-grade chaos was too crowded and monotonous for them. It was like losing their sight and being forced to live in a dark world.
<br><br>
A while ago, the Snake Masters were absolutely confounded. But now, they finally understood that the Snake Spirit King had led them into a path of no return.
<br><br>
"Hiss! Hiss! Black light!" Out of the blue, they heard someone shout. "You dare lie to me! I'll make you pay for this!"
<br><br>
It was the Snake Spirit King who was hiding in the black coordinates. In his anger, he suddenly stretched out his head and waved the two black blades to chop the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King already had his suspicions after he killed the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
But back then, he had no other choice. The only thing he could do was follow the black light and pray that this was not the truth.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Snake Spirit King was boiling with rage when he heard the truth from the black light itself.
<br><br>
He wanted to tear the humanoid creature into pieces! But before the Snake Spirit King's blades could even come close to the humanoid creature, they instantly shattered into pieces. The Snake Spirit King's black body disintegrated and returned to the coordinates.
<br><br>
"In the Stellar World, I wiped out the entire Fostering race and the Cinnabar race. Both of those races were a hundred times stronger than you," bragged the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
He continued, "In the World of No Limits, I had once deceived the Sacred Spirit race. And that race was ten thousand times stronger than you."
<br><br>
"And in the Boundless Divine World, those creatures that disobeyed me were exiled into time and forced to rot. They only needed a millionth of their strength to tear you to shreds," he boasted.
<br><br>
"In the Boundless Will World, I was an existence that was way beyond what your imaginations can comprehend."
<br><br>
Everyone fell completely silent as they listened to the creature's horrifying declaration.
<br><br>
Soon after, the humanoid creature's six pairs of eyes emitted a faint light.
<br><br>
Everyone could feel the creature's contempt and mockery for them.
<br><br>
He was the best of the best. He didn't even bother to look down upon all living beings. To him, they were utterly infinitesimal in the grand scheme of things.
<br><br>
"Having heard all that, what do you think the Four Spirits Sect means to me?" the humanoid creature asked them all.
<br><br>
Chapter 4221 The Mental Cage The Bird Masters, the Monkey Masters, and the human spirits all stared at the humanoid figure in astonishment.
<br><br>
His words, combined with the oppressive aura emanating from him, shocked them greatly.
<br><br>
What were the so-called Cinnabar race and the Fostering race? Were they truly a hundred times stronger than the Four Spirits Sect? And what was the Sacred Spirit race? Could they really be ten thousand times stronger than the Four Spirits Sect? There were existences even more powerful than the Sacred Spirit race? What worlds was this humanoid creature talking about? All these questions buzzed in their minds as they tried to wrap their heads around everything the humanoid creature talked about. Among everyone present, Corbett seemed to be the calmest.
<br><br>
Eyeing the humanoid creature warily, he asked, "The Stellar World... Are you talking about the Deep Space?"
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect had referred to the world above the main world as the Deep Space. However, Kincaid once mentioned that the Deep Space had a specific name—the "Stellar World", he called it. Only very few people knew of this name.
<br><br>
"What do you think?" the humanoid creature retorted indifferently.
<br><br>
"The World of No Limits... And the Boundless Divine World... Their grades are higher than the Deep Space's?" Corbett queried further.
<br><br>
"I have already downgraded those worlds," the humanoid creature declared proudly.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the humanoid creature incredulously. "Why did you do that? What does the downgrading mean to you?"
<br><br>
The humanoid creature laughed sinisterly. "You don't need to know that.
<br><br>
The only thing you need to do is give me the sword. Once I downgrade this world to the third grade, I'll let you live... Maybe I'll even let the human race rule the Lower Extreme World."
<br><br>
This Lower Extreme World he referred to was actually the chaos.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes lit up with interest at the humanoid creature's offer.
<br><br>
"What do you think?" the humanoid creature asked, noticing Zen's sparked interest.
<br><br>
It actually sounded like a good idea.
<br><br>
After all, Zen's original goal was to revive the human race.
<br><br>
To his surprise, Zen smiled. "After we rule the Lower Extreme World, you continue to downgrade it to the second grade," Zen said slowly. "Then, I'd become your puppet, like the Snake Spirit King, right?"
<br><br>
"If you refuse, I'll just kill you, along with your race," the humanoid creature said with a nonchalant shrug.
<br><br>
The Bird Masters, the human spirits, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others who were listening to their exchange all felt their chests tighten.
<br><br>
Even the usually valiant Monkey Masters had fallen silent, caution written all over their faces.
<br><br>
The situation was definitely grim. This humanoid creature was so powerful that it was simply impossible to put up a fight.
<br><br>
It seemed that Zen's only choice was to accept his offer.
<br><br>
However, to everyone's surprise, Zen just smiled calmly. "What makes you think you're strong enough to kill me?"
<br><br>
His words shocked everyone numb.
<br><br>
Although he was extremely powerful now and had killed the Snake Spirit King twice, it would be no easy feat to kill this black humanoid figure.
<br><br>
What made Zen so confident? "If you were really that powerful, why did you leave this sword in the altar for so long? Why did you have to use the Snake Spirit King as a puppet?"
<br><br>
By now, Zen's calm smile had turned into a smirk. "I doubt you are strong enough to downgrade this world. The truth of the matter is that the Stellar World wasn't completely downgraded. Now, the remains of the starry sky are still floating above the main world. You were also unable to downgrade the main world, even though you wanted to. Therefore, you needed to have the Four Spirits Sect send the world builders to downgrade the worlds little by little. That was why secondary worlds were built one after another, including the chaos.
<br><br>
The Lower Extreme World is not your ultimate goal. If I give you the sword, you will continue to downgrade it.
<br><br>
What do you take me for? I'm not that stupid!"
<br><br>
As Zen spoke, he gradually raised his sword, and the energy in the cracks on the blade slowly began to surge.
<br><br>
His face bore an unprecedented firmness.
<br><br>
Although the ancestry-level bloodline had forgotten a lot of important memories, Zen had gradually figured out that this humanoid creature in front of him was the root cause of all the trouble.
<br><br>
Theoretically, if the worlds hadn't been downgraded so many times, there wouldn't be the Four Spirits Sect, the chaos, the human race, or Zen, for that matter. However, this didn't mean that the humanoid creature was right.
<br><br>
"You!" The humanoid creature's voice finally revealed a trace of anger, and his eyes flashed ominously. "You're courting death!"
<br><br>
His black body began to tremble slightly, and black materials splattered out like ebony ink on white paper. A terrifying energy emanated from his body, and with a low growl, he waved a black hand fiercely towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
While the black hand didn't actually hit Zen, he suddenly cried out in pain.
<br><br>
He plummeted rapidly towards the ground, like a falling meteor.
<br><br>
Boom! As soon as Zen hit the ground, the humanoid creature stretched out his palm towards the ground.
<br><br>
Splash! A black cloud that only he and Zen could see suddenly enveloped Zen.
<br><br>
This was the free space that belonged to the Probability Extreme Form.
<br><br>
The Probability Extreme Form and the Flame Extreme Form given to Zen had not yet been removed.
<br><br>
As he was enshrouded in the black cloud, he quickly divided himself into a thousand figures. The figures all jumped up at the same time, each brandishing their irregular heavy sword. Green flames erupted from the tips of the blades, whirling like tornadoes of fire.
<br><br>
Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! The spiraling flames looked like a huge monster, constantly devouring the black cloud that tried to envelop Zen.
<br><br>
In a flash, the black cloud had been completely devoured. Then, Zen brandished his irregular heavy sword and thrust it at the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
Crack! With a sickening sound, the irregular heavy sword pierced clean through the humanoid creature's body, and the green flames quickly swept over his body, lapping at him crazily.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The humanoid creature struggled amidst the flames that were devouring him, but no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to extinguish the flames on his body. A few moments later, he was completely burnt by the flames.
<br><br>
"Is he dead?"
<br><br>
Zen's eyebrows shot up cautiously.
<br><br>
Although he firmly believed that the humanoid creature wasn't as powerful as he claimed to be, he shouldn't have been so weak. Zen felt a little uneasy, suspecting something was wrong.
<br><br>
Zen's heart pumped agitatedly.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was carefully studying his surroundings, he felt a sense of oppression coming from behind him.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, he swung his irregular heavy sword towards his back and once again struck the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Under the burning of the green flames, the humanoid creature was burnt to ashes again.
<br><br>
"Is this an avatar? Where is his real body?"
<br><br>
Zen frowned deeply. After killing the second avatar, he was even more agitated, his heart filled with unease.
<br><br>
While his mind raced, more and more avatars appeared in front of him, till he was surrounded.
<br><br>
While these avatars were not strong enough to withstand the flames, as they multiplied, Zen realized this fight would never end.
<br><br>
One avatar, two avatars, ten avatars, a hundred avatars...
<br><br>
Zen slashed at these avatars one after another.
<br><br>
Every time he killed an avatar, he became more irritated. He grew more and more paranoid with each avatar he struck, as though he couldn't stop until he killed all these avatars.
<br><br>
In this crazed state, he didn't even notice that the surrounding environment was getting more and more hazy...
<br><br>
Chapter 4222 Remind Zen Zen thought that he was fighting avatars of the humanoid creature, but he was wrong.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and the others on the altar watched as Zen slashed at black palm-sized bugs, one after another, with his heavy sword.
<br><br>
Each time Zen took out a black bug, it'd explode into a faint light, which would then enter his body.
<br><br>
As more and more light flew into Zen's body, his expression became wilder and wilder.
<br><br>
Little did Zen know that the real humanoid being was calmly floating nearby.
<br><br>
As the humanoid creature clapped his hands and opened them, black bugs emerged from his palms and flew towards Zen.
<br><br>
It was the Dream-breaking Bug.
<br><br>
The bugs were created for the humanoid creature to perform the Soul Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Fully aware of what Zen was capable of with his sword, the humanoid creature had no intention of fighting him head-on.
<br><br>
When he summoned the black cloud for the Probability Extreme Form, his plan to crush Zen by driving him crazy had commenced.
<br><br>
When Zen destroyed the black cloud, he had fallen right into the humanoid creature's trap.
<br><br>
Zen was not native to the Stellar World, so he didn't know much about the theurgies there. Additionally, the spirit inside his heavy sword was not very intelligent. They both fell into the Soul Extreme Form easily.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was a breeze for the humanoid being to lure Zen and his sword into his trap.
<br><br>
"Kill as many as you want. The Dream-breaking Bugs will poison you and turn you into a mindless killer. That way, you will be insane for the rest of your life..."
<br><br>
the humanoid creature quietly murmured to himself.
<br><br>
When the people on the altar saw this, they also fell into a state of panic.
<br><br>
"It looks like that he has fallen into an illusion...." the Snake Goddess said, her voice filled with worry.
<br><br>
"What is that light he keeps absorbing?"
<br><br>
"This is not good..."
<br><br>
Discussion broke out among the crowd on the altar. From the looks of it, the illusion was difficult to break.
<br><br>
Although they were keenly aware that Zen was trapped in an illusion, there was nothing they could do to help.
<br><br>
Even the Monkey Masters and the Bird Masters couldn't risk coming to Zen's aid, how much more those at the Eternal Realm? They knew that the humanoid being was too powerful for them to deal with. Even without using the Light of Annihilation, he could finish off Treacherous Beings. He could even destroy their coordinates, preventing them from coming back from the dead.
<br><br>
"We need to make Zen snap out of it!" a human spirit cried out.
<br><br>
"Who can do that?" another human spirit asked.
<br><br>
Although they were Treacherous Beings, they trembled at the thought of eternal death.
<br><br>
While everyone hesitated in fear, Lawler suddenly spoke up. "I will remind him."
<br><br>
"Are you sure, Lawler?" Duran asked in a low voice. He didn't want to see his comrade get himself killed for nothing.
<br><br>
"My eyes can see past all illusions," Lawler answered. "I am gonna give it a shot."
<br><br>
"If you fail to break it, you will die," Duran warned him.
<br><br>
"If we sit here and wait, it'll only be a matter of time before we get killed,"
<br><br>
Lawler snapped impatiently.
<br><br>
'Since the humanoid creature's goal is to downgrade the world, he would definitely kill all the Treacherous Beings. That means all the creatures from the forth-grade world will be slaughtered...
<br><br>
Lawler's right. We can't just stand by and do nothing. We can't give up, even if there is just a sliver of hope.' As these thoughts raced through Duran's mind, he fell silent.
<br><br>
So did the others.
<br><br>
They all understood what was at stake here.
<br><br>
Thus, no one dissuaded him from going to Zen's aid. Without further hesitation, Lawler flew towards Zen.
<br><br>
As soon as Lawler took action, Hamilton of the Black House followed suit. Suddenly, he threw a pair of huge scissors and leapt into the air.
<br><br>
They were the Dream-breaking Scissors, made by the Bold Conjecture House. This magic treasure could break any illusion.
<br><br>
The moment Lawler launched himself into the air, two beams of colorful light shot out from his eyes. The light streaked through the sky and shot towards Zen.
<br><br>
In addition, under Hamilton's control, the scissors opened their blades in Zen's direction.
<br><br>
Crack! All this didn't escape the humanoid being.
<br><br>
Contempt was written all over his face when he saw what was happening.
<br><br>
The creatures in the fifth-grade world were used to showing their emotions; the humanoid creature wasn't spared from this.
<br><br>
He knew there was no need to stop them.
<br><br>
The Soul Extreme Form was much more complicated than ordinary illusions.
<br><br>
Generally, illusions often covered a designated area, creating a dreamlike scene.
<br><br>
However, the Soul Extreme Form worked on a specific object, as opposed to an area. Since Zen was haunted by the Soul Extreme Form, the humanoid creature was confident there was nothing that Lawler and Hamilton could do to save Zen.
<br><br>
"Now that you have no chance of winning whatsoever, you should know your place and stay out of this," the humanoid creature sneered haughtily.
<br><br>
As he watched Lawler and Hamilton, his six pairs of eyes began to flash intensely.
<br><br>
Lawler and Hamilton abruptly stopped in their tracks, as though frozen in place. Then, bubbles appeared on their bodies, until they melted into a puddle of white, translucent mud. Unfortunately, their coordinates weren't spared, and vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
A dead silence fell over the altar again.
<br><br>
Facing the humanoid being, they felt as weak as ants.
<br><br>
Not only were they unable to fight against such a powerful existence, but they couldn't even figure out what method he was using against them.
<br><br>
"Alas..."
<br><br>
Someone sighed and sat on the ground, his head drooping dejectedly. He had given up.
<br><br>
Some clenched their fists, glaring at the sky helplessly.
<br><br>
Some were angry, but they didn't dare make a sound.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess tilted her head as she watched Zen continue slaying the black bugs one by one. Her eyebrows furrowed deeply as she tried to come up with a solution. Suddenly, her eyes lit up decisively. "I will go myself," she said to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"What?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven asked confusedly, caught in a daze.
<br><br>
"I am gonna head for the primitive land!" the Snake Goddess said firmly.
<br><br>
'Since Zen is trapped in this illusion, his heavy sword and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord who is in Zen's mind are also stuck there, ' she thought silently. 'Despite that, we can communicate with Zen in the primitive land.' The Primeval Lord of Heaven perked up. "Are you sure?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded.
<br><br>
Without wasting any time, the Primeval Lord of Heaven took out the Descending Ring and made it float above the Snake Goddess's head.
<br><br>
The Descending Ring then emitted a golden light that enveloped the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the Snake Goddess was transported to the primitive land.
<br><br>
Although the humanoid creature noticed this, he didn't pay it any heed.
<br><br>
Again, he was confident this weakling wouldn't be able to do a thing to ruin his plans.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess arrived at the Pear Hill, she headed straight for the Civilization Artifact of the human race. She was in such a rush, she didn't even bother greeting the people there.
<br><br>
When she finally reached it, the Snake Goddess stretched out her hand and pressed it against the Civilization Artifact. Activating the artifact, she tried to speak to Zen. Since she was in the primitive land, which was actually Zen's inner world, she hoped that she might be able to reach Zen and free him from the illusion.
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact began to flash with a green light. "Zen, can you hear me?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
She waited for a bit, but she didn't get any response.
<br><br>
She tried several more times, but Zen still didn't respond.
<br><br>
"So, this isn't working..." The Snake Goddess lowered her head, her shoulders hunched in disappointment.
<br><br>
Just then, the Eternal Realm warriors of the current chaotic era like the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi walked up to her.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, what happened in Jade Pure Realm? Why are you in such a hurry?" the Snake Goddess of the current chaotic era asked.
<br><br>
It was actually kind of weird to talk to oneself. But noticing that the real Snake Goddess was so anxious, she speculated that they must have encountered a big problem.
<br><br>
Chapter 4223 Free The real Snake Goddess briefly described Zen's current situation.
<br><br>
Naturally, Fuxi and the others were worried when they heard that Zen had fallen into the illusion.
<br><br>
"What about the Monkey Spirit King? You had many allies with you when you entered the Jade Pure Realm this time," said the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
They were well-prepared for this expedition. They took the necessary precautions and decided it was best to go together.
<br><br>
One could say that they gathered all of the powerful warriors in the Monkey Spirit Sect, the Bird Spirit Sect and the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
However, the real Snake Goddess smiled bitterly. "They are still not powerful enough... In the end, we just had to rely on Zen to kill the Snake Spirit King. Moreover, there is an even more powerful being behind the Snake Spirit King. He is the real root of all this chaos."
<br><br>
When they heard this, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others fell silent.
<br><br>
This unexpected turn of events was way beyond their wildest imaginations.
<br><br>
"Let's try reaching him through the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," suggested the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
When they reached another Civilization Artifact, they called out the green figure inside it.
<br><br>
The green figure immediately responded. It agreed to their request and tried to communicate with Zen. Unfortunately, it failed again.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization's Civilization Artifact was the only artifact they hadn't tried using. But because the first two Civilization Artifacts already failed, there was no need to try it anymore.
<br><br>
"Zen is our only hope now. If he is defeated, then everything will be over..." The Snake Goddess pursed her lips. She was deeply distressed.
<br><br>
Her beautiful face showed extreme anxiety.
<br><br>
The others were at a loss for words. They didn't know what else to do.
<br><br>
Everyone was feeling downhearted and gloomy. All of a sudden, the Snake Goddess raised her head. Her eyes were fixed upon the crimson sky above them.
<br><br>
Ever since Zen started the battle, energies of various colors flowed and danced in the crimson sky. All of the energies gathered in the center of the primitive land. In turn, these energies were being continuously transmitted to Zen. Even the creatures of the primitive land could sense that, as the energies' aura was extremely powerful.
<br><br>
"I'm just wondering about something. The ancestry-level bloodline is intelligent. Didn't it notice that something happened to Zen?" the Snake Goddess mused while still staring up at the sky.
<br><br>
The real Snake Goddess thought for a while. Then, she raised her eyebrows and said, "Maybe it hasn't discovered it yet. We can try communicating with it!"
<br><br>
Fuxi shrugged his shoulders and said, "The ancestry-level bloodline only communicates with Zen. It has never communicated with us."
<br><br>
Everyone knew that this crimson sky possessed intelligence. Zen had even mentioned it to them before. However, no one ever tried to communicate with it.
<br><br>
"How will we know what could happen if we don't even try? Let's just do it!"
<br><br>
As soon as the real Snake Goddess finished speaking, she used the Grand Teleportation technique and headed straight to the top of the primitive land. The others followed her closely.
<br><br>
Naturally, they felt a strong sense of pressure when the Snake Goddess and the others stood directly below the blood red sky.
<br><br>
Then, before they could go any further, a thunderous and commanding voice came from the crimson sky. "All of you, retreat!"
<br><br>
Now that the ancestry-level bloodline was busy transferring the energy to Zen, it had no time to deal with the creatures in the primitive land.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, everyone was overjoyed when the ancestry-level bloodline spoke. A few moments ago, they were afraid that it wouldn't respond.
<br><br>
The real Snake Goddess went straight to the point and said, "I am the Snake Goddess, coming down from the altar. Are you aware that Zen has fallen into the illusion?"
<br><br>
"What did you say?"
<br><br>
There was a trace of bewilderment in the otherwise monotonous voice of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
When the Soul Extreme Form trapped Zen, it was able to deceive him, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, the irregular heavy sword, and even the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
At that very moment, the ancestry-level bloodline had also been feeling extremely anxious. Something was definitely amiss.
<br><br>
There was no end to the number of humanoid creatures that kept appearing.
<br><br>
As Zen continued to fight them, his state of mind became awfully unstable.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had already sensed that there was something wrong. Unfortunately, the Soul Extreme Form could silently affect one's ability to think. Therefore, it was unable to find out what exactly was going on! Zen, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and the irregular heavy sword also sensed that something wasn't right.
<br><br>
But as the warning came from the real Snake Goddess, the ancestry-level bloodline finally figured out what was going on. They had been bewitched by the humanoid being.
<br><br>
There were cracking sounds that echoed from within the crimson sky.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't quite remember how many humanoid creatures he had already killed.
<br><br>
Based on his understanding, the creation of the avatars would exhaust a lot of the humanoid creature's energy.
<br><br>
Therefore, he hacked these avatars down one by one until the humanoid creature could no longer create them.
<br><br>
However, the number of humanoid creatures he was facing seemed infinite. He would not be able to kill all of them.
<br><br>
Little by little, he became more irritable and angrier. His eyes began to glow red. It was as if he was going to devour people.
<br><br>
"Zen..." The ancestry-bloodline tried communicating with Zen. "Zen, listen to me..."
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline's voice was coming from his inner world.
<br><br>
Even though Zen heard this voice, it seemed like it was coming from a distant place. He did not have the slightest intention of responding to it.
<br><br>
He was too busy cutting down the humanoid creatures. "Zen... Zen..." He couldn't be bothered to listen to this pesky voice.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen didn't respond at all as the ancestry-level bloodline kept calling out his name.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline thought for a while. Soon enough, it came up with a plan to awaken him from this illusion. It injected a violent energy into Zen's body.
<br><br>
This violent energy did not flow into the irregular heavy sword. Instead, it flowed along Zen's meridians. And then, it directly exploded within his chest.
<br><br>
He heard a loud booming sound and suddenly felt a sharp pain in his chest.
<br><br>
It created an open wound on Zen's chest.
<br><br>
He merely looked down on his chest and then attacked the humanoid creatures frenziedly. He thought that this attack came from the humanoid creatures. Naturally, he counterattacked even more wildly! "It's useless. I should try something else..."
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline paused for a moment to think of another plan. This time, it launched a soul attack on Zen.
<br><br>
As the blood red sky flashed, a brown aura gathered in the center of the primitive land. It instantly entered Zen's body and turned into a sharp needle. It headed straight for Zen's mind.
<br><br>
Just as the needle was drilling into Zen's mind, a streak of white flashing light burst out of his mind and extinguished the needle in an instant! "What just happened? What is that?"
<br><br>
At first, the ancestry-level bloodline was stunned. Nonetheless, it immediately understood what was going on.
<br><br>
The difference between the energies of the fifth-grade world and the fourth-grade world in terms of strength was not that huge.
<br><br>
After all, the energies from the fifth-grade world only changed from one hundred and forty kinds to three hundred and seventy-three kinds in the fourth-grade world.
<br><br>
But they would develop into three thousand kinds in the third-grade world. The gap between them would be very huge.
<br><br>
Zen's current situation was very similar to being caught in the mind trapping technique. However, the humanoid creature's theurgy was obviously stronger than the mind trapping technique of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"I see. So it can only be consumed little by little..."
<br><br>
As soon as it figured this out, the ancestry-level bloodline started to attack Zen's soul incessantly.
<br><br>
As expected, these soul attacks were quickly blocked by the white light and were extinguished in a flash.
<br><br>
Even though the flashing white light was powerful, it was still limited.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen was still stubbornly killing those humanoid creatures. He was continuously absorbing the white light. The speed at which the light was consumed was not as fast as the speed in which he replenished it.
<br><br>
As the ancestry-level bloodline's soul attacks became more intense and relentless, the speed at which the white flashing light was consumed became faster! Slowly, the hostility on Zen's face began to fade. His bright red eyes gradually returned to their original color.
<br><br>
"What is happening? How..."
<br><br>
The humanoid creature was not that far from where Zen was standing. A look of surprise flashed in his compound eyes.
<br><br>
"How are you able to break free from the Soul Extreme Form? It is quite impossible... Ah, I see. Someone is helping you..."
<br><br>
The humanoid creature was shocked. However, he didn't pay much attention to it.
<br><br>
His goal was not Zen to begin with. It was the irregular heavy sword he was after.
<br><br>
As long as this sword was detached from Zen, he had nothing to fear.
<br><br>
Gradually, the white light in Zen's mind faded away. Finally, he came to his senses. Only then did he realize that the ones he killed were not the humanoid creatures, but merely black bugs.
<br><br>
Chapter 4224 The Heavy Sword Losing Its Mind Zen had already managed to come back to his senses, but the heavy sword he was wielding in his hand was still trapped in the illusion of the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
It was not easy for the spirit inside the sword to regain its senses. Thus, under its control, Zen just continued to slay the black bugs rushing towards him.
<br><br>
At the same time, once a black bug was killed, a white light would appear from it.
<br><br>
Some of the white lights would enter Zen's body, while the rest penetrated the heavy sword.
<br><br>
"What is this? What's going on?"
<br><br>
Zen couldn't prevent the white lights from invading his body. As the lights reached his mind, he felt a sensation that his thoughts were being manipulated.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline was on high alert. As soon as the white lights entered Zen's mind, it would immediately take action and purge them.
<br><br>
"Can you also destroy these white lights inside the sword?" Zen asked the ancestry-level bloodline. If the white lights continued to infest the heavy sword, he would also be greatly affected.
<br><br>
"I can give it a try," the ancestry-level bloodline replied briefly.
<br><br>
Without Zen telling it, it could sense that he was being controlled by the sword in his hand.
<br><br>
Thus, the ancestry-level bloodline quickly released a brown aura, making it flow through Zen's body and spread along his arms in order to permeate the heavy sword.
<br><br>
The instant that the brown aura penetrated the sword, beams of white lights swarmed towards it.
<br><br>
The white lights were like an automatic defense mechanism that attacked any foreign entity that probed into their territory.
<br><br>
In their clash, the ancestry-level bloodline didn't care about spending as much energy as it could because it was basically powered by infinite energy.
<br><br>
It was pretty confident that it could prevail and remove all the white lights inside the sword, though it might take a little while.
<br><br>
However, the sword responded immediately as the ancestry-level bloodline launched a soul attack.
<br><br>
Currently, the spirit of the sword got carried away in slaying the black bugs. But when it noticed the soul attack coming from the ancestry-level bloodline, it immediately shifted its focus and fought without hesitation.
<br><br>
Then, wisps of green energy came out of the sword's spirit which looked like a ball of red light.
<br><br>
As the green energy was released, the sword was able to successfully resist the soul attack of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"This is troublesome…"
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was rendered speechless by the turn of events.
<br><br>
It definitely intended to save the sword's spirit, but the latter saw the ancestry-level bloodline as an enemy and fought back.
<br><br>
The white lights continued to confuse and control the spirit of the sword, but it had no way to realize it.
<br><br>
"So, how did it go?" Zen inquired as he gripped tightly on the heavy sword.
<br><br>
"I failed. This approach doesn't seem to work. The spirit of the sword noticed my soul attack and immediately fought back. The white lights inside are manipulating it into thinking that I am an enemy," the ancestrylevel bloodline replied in a frustrated tone.
<br><br>
Zen was a bit surprised at the ancestry-level bloodline's response. He tried to calm down and thought of a feasible solution before he said, "We can keep it from acquiring the energy it needs."
<br><br>
Originally, the heavy sword was only left with a little energy. That was why the sword was not very powerful when it was still in Kincaid's possession.
<br><br>
Then, all of the energy that accumulated on the altar for so many years was consumed by Zen.
<br><br>
The sword was constantly attacking with its full might and even activated the Probability Extreme Form and the Flame Extreme Form earlier. But once the ancestry-level bloodline stopped providing it with energy coming from Zen, the spirit of the sword would eventually run out of energy soon enough.
<br><br>
When that happened, the ancestry-level bloodline could take the opportunity and remove the white lights inside the sword.
<br><br>
"Excellent idea. I'm on it!" The ancestry-level bloodline quickly grasped what Zen was planning, so it didn't waste any time and initiated their move.
<br><br>
At this moment, the blood-colored sky in the primitive land instantly calmed down.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others noticed the silence in the sky, they all thought that the fight between Zen and the humanoid being was finally over.
<br><br>
Under the control of the sword's spirit, Zen had been constantly using and brandishing the heavy sword to kill the bugs.
<br><br>
However, the ancestry-level bloodline had already stopped providing it with additional energy, thus the energy stored inside the sword eventually ran out. In turn, the lights that it emitted also grew dimmer.
<br><br>
Although the spirit of the sword was still eager and frantic to slaughter the black bugs, it was unable to do so because it was already lacking with energy.
<br><br>
"Huh? What's going on?"
<br><br>
The humanoid creature immediately sensed that something wrong was going on with the sword in Zen's hand.
<br><br>
However, as his six pairs of compound eyes flashed, he instantly figured out what Zen had been up to.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! You insolent brat! Do you think you can outsmart me with your petty tricks?"
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the humanoid creature stretched out his hand and a black cloud instantly emerged above Zen's head.
<br><br>
Since Zen couldn't use the heavy sword that had run out of energy, the humanoid creature tried to take the upper hand and bring Zen down using the Probability Extreme Form.
<br><br>
At Zen's current state, he wouldn't be able to utilize the Probability Extreme Form to counter the attack of the humanoid creature. "He's going to use the Probability Extreme Form again!" he said as his eyes widened in shock and anger upon sensing the hint of energy coming out from the humanoid being.
<br><br>
The moment Zen finished speaking, he suddenly felt that a massive fist smashed against his chest.
<br><br>
He was caught off guard and didn't even have the time to react.
<br><br>
Although his body was astonishingly tough, the punch was still able to make a hole in his chest.
<br><br>
In the Probability Extreme Form, the humanoid creature was able to throw tens of thousands of punches within two seconds. The heavy sword was rendered useless and had no way to protect Zen.
<br><br>
Crash! Bang! The humanoid creature's fists continuously landed on Zen's body at lightning speed.
<br><br>
Almost every part of Zen's body was hit by his dreadful punches.
<br><br>
Fist marks were soon imprinted on Zen's body after it was beaten at the same spots countless times.
<br><br>
Then, the people on the altar saw that Zen's body was floating in the sky.
<br><br>
An invisible creature seemed to be cruelly pounding him as if he was a mere sandbag.
<br><br>
"What the hell's happening?"
<br><br>
"Is that really Zen?"
<br><br>
"Why isn't he fighting back?"
<br><br>
Several people got confused and worried at the sight of him being beaten continuously.
<br><br>
However, they couldn't do anything but entrust this to Zen. After all, it was a battle that they didn't even understand, not to mention get involved with it.
<br><br>
Even the powerful Monkey Masters and Bird Masters couldn't do anything except watch and wait for the outcome of this battle.
<br><br>
As Zen was being thoroughly beaten down, the ancestry-level bloodline was left with no choice.
<br><br>
It couldn't let Zen be defeated like this, so it provided the heavy sword with energy again.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the sword emitted bright lights again, thus allowing Zen to activate the Probability Extreme Form and Flame Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Zen swiftly moved along the thick black cloud and repeatedly slashed it using the sword, producing green clouds of fire. These flaming clouds instantly burned the black cloud and turned it into nothing.
<br><br>
However, the humanoid creature still had no intention of fighting Zen head-on. Just before the black cloud was vanquished, he quickly retreated and hid a place where the dark cloud didn't cover. He then stretched out his hand, and fist-sized bugs came rushing out from the back hole on his palm.
<br><br>
Upon sensing the black bugs, the sword immediately manipulated Zen again to kill them. The sword started wreaking havoc once more as if it had gone insane.
<br><br>
"It's so annoying! This guy doesn't give me a chance to take a break at all!" Zen shouted as he narrowed his eyes towards the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
The humanoid being perceived Zen's vexation and laughed grimly. "You can't fool me with your little tricks. Swear your loyalty to me before I completely pollute that sword's spirit. What do you think?" he offered.
<br><br>
He obviously wanted to deal with the sword using his Soul Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Once he succeeded, he would be able to keep the spirit of the sword under his absolute control.
<br><br>
"You think I would agree to that nonsense? No way!" Zen yelled coldly.
<br><br>
"Well, you wasted your last chance, stupid human," the humanoid creature said in a disgruntled tone.
<br><br>
As he stretched out his hand, more and more black bugs appeared and flew towards Zen. All of them were slaughtered by the sword, mistaking them for the humanoid beings as it was still greatly affected by the Soul Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Consequently, more and more white lights invaded the sword, making the sword's spirit break and lose its mind.
<br><br>
As the humanoid creature witnessed this, his eyes flashed with thrill.
<br><br>
"It's almost done. Soul Storm!" he declared in a booming voice.
<br><br>
As the humanoid creature issued the order, a massive number of white lights immediately gathered and entered the sword.
<br><br>
Chapter 4225 Snatching The Sword Whir...
<br><br>
The Soul Storm that the humanoid creature mentioned had blown up. The light emitted by the irregular heavy sword began to spread in a chaotic manner.
<br><br>
Previously, although the sword was bewitched by the Soul Extreme Form, at least a part of it was still sober. It still attacked the humanoid creatures transformed by the black bugs in an orderly fashion.
<br><br>
At this moment, however, the sword seemed to have become completely lost.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was still continuously providing it with energy, but it was transforming the injected energy into various forms and releasing it in random spurts.
<br><br>
"Hoo, hoo..."
<br><br>
Faint golden light shone from the cracks on the surface of the sword.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a glowing circular ring appeared. The irregular heavy sword spewed out a bright golden beam.
<br><br>
The light shot out and cut through the air.
<br><br>
It obviously wasn't targeting anything. It hit a random patch of ground.
<br><br>
There was a crack as the light sliced down.
<br><br>
It pierced through the ground of the Jade Pure Realm. The golden light penetrated to the stage below and kept going. It passed through the Grand Plain Stage, the Sanskrit Light Stage, the Blooming Jade Stage, the Constant Glory Stage...
<br><br>
In a few seconds, almost every Other Shore creature on every stage saw this golden light column as it passed through.
<br><br>
Some unfortunate Other Shore creatures happened to be in the way of the light, and whatever the light touched melted without a trace.
<br><br>
Everything in the path of the golden light column was obliterated.
<br><br>
But the irregular heavy sword was still emitting more energy.
<br><br>
The circles of golden light appeared one after another around the sword.
<br><br>
Golden light columns shot outwards in all directions, and there seemed to be nothing on the Other Shore that could stop them.
<br><br>
Several light columns hit the altar, and a few Monkey Masters and Bird Masters who failed to dodge the beams dissipated upon being touched by the golden light.
<br><br>
"The Holy Light Extreme Form!" said the humanoid creature, laughing.
<br><br>
He enjoyed seeing the sword in a state of madness.
<br><br>
Finally, the irregular heavy sword seemed to have released all the golden light. The surface of the sword began to darken, with traces of green forming on the sharp blade. A green mist rose from the sword.
<br><br>
The green mist spread out. It contained many small dark green arrows.
<br><br>
Although these small arrows had a powerful life energy, they were fatal.
<br><br>
Every life form hit by the arrows would rapidly wither and die.
<br><br>
Luckily, these dark green arrows were not as swift as the golden beams of light. Because the arrows moved at a slower speed, the people on the altar all managed to dodge the new attack.
<br><br>
The humanoid creature didn't dodge. He stood calmly in place and reached out to pluck a small arrow in midair. He held it up, examining it closely. "This is the Life Extreme Form, the arrow of death..."
<br><br>
Then the green mist began to dissipate as flashes of lightning shot out from the sword. It was followed by dark orbs that floated like black moons in the surrounding air.
<br><br>
"What the hell does it want to do?" Zen was still tightly holding onto the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
"It must have gone crazy," said the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"Then cut off the energy supply!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
Although the irregular heavy sword didn't hurt Zen as it attacked, many others were hurt. Several people on the altar were killed. More were dying at present, unable to resist the latest lightning attack released by the sword.
<br><br>
"If I cut off the energy supply, how will you deal with that guy?" asked the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The humanoid creature was waiting, looking unafraid. Indeed, he even seemed entertained.
<br><br>
Once the irregular heavy sword stopped attacking, he would definitely attack Zen without hesitation.
<br><br>
However, Zen could not let the irregular heavy sword just keep spewing out mad attacks at random. That was not an acceptable solution.
<br><br>
Zen gripped the sword tightly, beginning to feel anxious. He came up with one idea after another, but found major flaws in each one. He dismissed every plan that came to mind until it seemed he was out of ideas.
<br><br>
A loud crack reverberated in the air.
<br><br>
An invisible force field had suddenly appeared on the surface of the irregular heavy sword. It was the Force Field Extreme Form.
<br><br>
When the invisible force field surged out, it pushed away Zen's hand, and the sword finally slipped out of his grasp.
<br><br>
"It's time!" cried the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
His compound eyes flashed and he went straight for the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Once it had lost its energy supply, the irregular heavy sword was no more than a piece of scrap iron, so it was easily controlled.
<br><br>
Zen's expression darkened as he quickly reached out, trying to grab back the hilt of the sword.
<br><br>
Just as his hand brushed across the sword hilt, Zen suddenly felt a unique aura.
<br><br>
'Black cloud, the Probability Extreme Form?...' Zen thought. The idea crossed his mind unexpectedly, and an ominous premonition rose in his mind.
<br><br>
"Damn it!" he shouted.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the ominous premonition became reality.
<br><br>
There was a series of loud bangs, as the humanoid creature launched a violent attack on Zen in the Probability Extreme Form.
<br><br>
With a boom, Zen was smashed into the ground.
<br><br>
A billowing cloud of dust rose up over his sprawled form.
<br><br>
The humanoid creature grabbed the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
The people on the altar watched with their mouths open, shocked at the sudden turn of events.
<br><br>
Even the least intelligent warriors understood what was happening.
<br><br>
"It's all over. It's all over..." Gonggong muttered. He had turned into a figure of water, becoming liquid and transparent all throughout his body in order to avoid being hurt by the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
Fuxi, Alphonse, and Corbett were silent.
<br><br>
The Monkey Masters and the Bird Masters looked stunned.
<br><br>
Their only hope had been shattered. In that instant, they were overcome by a terrible emptiness and distress.
<br><br>
Zen lay in the rubble where he had fallen. His face was full of anger, and he struggled to rise, unwilling to accept this outcome.
<br><br>
He had thought that he could grasp an infinite amount of power, but he was wrong. His opponent now had taken away such power easily. It was enough to plunge anyone into despair.
<br><br>
The humanoid creature howled.
<br><br>
He appeared to be bursting with excitement.
<br><br>
He held the irregular heavy sword with both hands. Six pairs of compound eyes looked up at the sky as his mouth opened, forming unfamiliar sounds.
<br><br>
Although no one knew what he was saying, the emotions behind his words were obvious.
<br><br>
It was the exhilaration of one who had survived many vicissitudes of life, and managed at last to obtain something he had been pursuing for a long time.
<br><br>
His excitement formed a sharp contrast with the desperation of the crowd.
<br><br>
It made everyone else even more depressed.
<br><br>
"This day has come too late, but at last I've taken it back. Clarence, it's a pity you can't see this," said the humanoid creature with a sharp bark of laughter.
<br><br>
"Taken it back? Did that sword originally belong to him?" the Snake Goddess asked quietly, her head tilted as she watched the celebration of the humanoid creature. Just now, she had hurriedly returned to the Other Shore after informing the ancestry-level bloodline that Zen had lost his mind and fallen into an illusion.
<br><br>
"Who is the Clarence he mentioned?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked curiously.
<br><br>
Fuxi spread out his hands. "Does it even matter now?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't say anything.
<br><br>
Of course, they understood they were in dire straits.
<br><br>
The humanoid creature raised the irregular heavy sword, looking around at everyone watching him. "I have not felt this excited in a long time! I'll kill you and offer your lives to the sword!"
<br><br>
A buzz filled the air, as the blade of the irregular heavy sword flashed with a dark purple energy.
<br><br>
After several moments, purple cracks began spreading around the humanoid creature, and black energy balls emerged one after another from the cracks. These energy balls contained a violent and terrifying power.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!" shouted the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
Hundreds of purple black energy balls rained down from the sky, as though the God of Death had come.
<br><br>
Some people started to run, trying to escape. Others stayed where they were. Some even changed their forms, trying to defend themselves against this new attack.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stood still. These purple cracks were spreading very quickly. Before long, the entire Jade Pure Realm would be covered with purple black energy balls. When the purple black energy balls covered the whole area, they would die no matter where they had run.
<br><br>
"Ah, Zen, it seems that you can't escape this," she sighed. She looked towards Zen, who was lying on the ground in the distance.
<br><br>
This was the first time that Zen had failed to meet the Snake Goddess's expectations.
<br><br>
It was not his fault. The existence he faced had already far exceeded the limits of his abilities and resistance. It was a miracle that he had held on for so long.
<br><br>
Zen had always managed to pull miracles out of thin air, but he couldn't create miracles forever.
<br><br>
Chapter 4226 Reunion The purple energy balls were falling down slowly from above. It was as if a stage on the Other Shore was sluggishly crumbling after it collapsed.
<br><br>
As the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw this, he quickly stretched out his hand and flicked two golden rings towards Fuxi and Gonggong. The rings that emitted golden lights darted and stopped above their heads.
<br><br>
"You three, leave now while there's still time…" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in a soft voice.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had a Descending Ring with her, so she could descend to the primitive land any time.
<br><br>
"Then, what about you?" the Snake Goddess asked as she raised her eyebrows.
<br><br>
"It makes no difference whether I leave or not." the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with a bitter smile on his face.
<br><br>
He clearly knew that everything and everyone was going to be destroyed eventually. There was no point in prolonging the suffering and needless struggles.
<br><br>
However, deep inside him, all of his frustrations were built up. He couldn't accept that everything was just going to end this way.
<br><br>
Everyone knew how difficult it was for him to reach this certain step.
<br><br>
However, he had failed in the last one, and now, he felt very much dead inside.
<br><br>
Among them, Gonggong was the first one who activated the Descending Ring. After the ring emitted luminous lights, his body trembled, but his body still stayed right where he was.
<br><br>
"What's going on? I can't leave?" Gonggong's voice trembled as he realized this. Among the human heroes, he had always been the most careful and cautious one. He was relatively afraid of death.
<br><br>
Fuxi was kind of surprised when he saw what happened to Gonggong, so he also activated the Descending Ring given to him.
<br><br>
However, just as what happened to Gonggong, he also failed to leave.
<br><br>
Then, the Snake Goddess gave it a try, but the result was just the same.
<br><br>
A bitter and helpless smile appeared on her face as she looked at Zen in the distance. "If we can't leave the Other Shore, then I'm afraid that it's also the same for Zen… "
<br><br>
At the same moment, Zen was also quietly looking at the sky. His expression was as calm as ever.
<br><br>
He had just tried to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune to leave the Jade Pure Realm, but it didn't have any effect. It was as if he had been showered with the Soul Interdicting Water, making it impossible to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Will the primitive land also collapse if I die?" Zen asked the ancestrylevel bloodline with a hint of hesitation.
<br><br>
"Yes," the ancestry-level bloodline replied briefly.
<br><br>
Although the current primitive land was built with the aid of the ancestrylevel bloodline, Zen was still its owner, making him indispensable to it.
<br><br>
"What about you? What will happen to you after?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
"Me? I will have no choice but to leave the primitive land," the ancestrylevel bloodline answered.
<br><br>
"I see. Can you please take care of my family for me?" Zen asked with a slightly trembling voice.
<br><br>
"Sure. I will."
<br><br>
Actually, the result would still be the same whether the ancestry-level bloodline took care of them or not. Even Zen knew this.
<br><br>
The downgrade had already begun. It meant that the entire chaos would soon be under the control of the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen remembered his loved ones—Dorothy, Letitia, Margaret, Lavender...
<br><br>
Their beautiful faces appeared in front of Zen as if he was hallucinating.
<br><br>
At this moment, he suddenly felt a deep sense of regret.
<br><br>
From the moment he knew them, his life turned out like a chess piece that was being constantly pushed, running around all the time. From the Eastern Region to the universe, from the divine land to the Source World, he was restlessly going here and there. He rarely paused and took the time to be with the most important people in his life.
<br><br>
If he had only known that this would be the ending, he thought that he would have rather chosen to be a mere mortal and spend the rest of his life with them in peace.
<br><br>
It didn't matter what mission he had to accomplish, nor would he care about the end of the chaos or the downgrade.
<br><br>
Then, suddenly, he remembered Geoffrey.
<br><br>
He and Ziya were still in the main world at this time.
<br><br>
"If the humanoid creature completes the downgrade, what will happen to Geoffrey and Ziya who stay in the main world?" Zen asked out of nowhere.
<br><br>
"They will also die," the ancestry-level bloodline answered with all honesty.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but fall silent upon hearing this.
<br><br>
Right now, the purple energy balls that were falling were already getting closer and closer to them. Ten thousand feet, a thousand feet, five hundred feet… Boom! The altar in the distance was the first one to be eroded by the purple energy balls.
<br><br>
Before Fuxi got erased by the purple energy balls, he waved at Zen.
<br><br>
"Goodbye, Zen…"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess just knelt on the ground and closed her captivating eyes.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven just stood still as he awaited his impending doom.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Gonggong continued to struggle. He turned into a pool of water and flowed down from the altar, seeping into the ground.
<br><br>
Several others were also unwilling to give up and desperately climbed down from the altar, trying to buy themselves a few more minutes or seconds to survive. At the same time, many people just stayed where they were and waited for what was going to happen.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! The purple energy balls had finally reached the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven. They all quickly melted and disappeared without a trace within the energy balls.
<br><br>
Soon after, the altar where they were standing also collapsed.
<br><br>
The overbearing power of the energy balls eroded the altar layer by layer.
<br><br>
At this point, these energy balls were only just about ten feet above Zen's head.
<br><br>
But suddenly, a space fluctuation occurred directly behind him.
<br><br>
With a surprised look on his face, he quickly turned and saw a door appeared.
<br><br>
"This door…" Zen somehow regained his senses as his eyes widened.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The door suddenly sprang open.
<br><br>
Then, a pair of huge fluffy hands stretched out from the door and hurriedly grabbed and pulled Zen in.
<br><br>
Bang! As soon as Zen was able to enter the door, it closed shut and disappeared in the space.
<br><br>
All of this happened in the blink of an eye, but this still didn't go unnoticed in the eyes of the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
"Really?"
<br><br>
The humanoid creature expressed a trace of confusion in his eyes.
<br><br>
"He still had a backup plan for escape at this point? Well, it doesn't matter. No matter how much he struggles, he can only exist for a few more days."
<br><br>
To be honest, the humanoid creature didn't actually care if Zen died right away or was still able to escape. In his mind, he clearly knew that no one would get away from the fate of fading away soon.
<br><br>
From the very moment that he got total control of the heavy sword, the ending had been decided. There was no possibility of anyone overturning the situation.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, inside the door where Zen was pulled into, two rows of longhaired monsters could be seen standing on both sides of the passageway.
<br><br>
All of them focused their gazes on Zen.
<br><br>
Zen had a hunch when he first saw the door, but he was a little unsure.
<br><br>
"Who are you? Where am I?"
<br><br>
Zen asked with a straight face.
<br><br>
However, there was nothing but silence, and no one answered him.
<br><br>
Then, Zen heard that footsteps were coming from the end of the passageway.
<br><br>
As the footsteps drew nearer and nearer, a figure slowly appeared from the darkness. It was Dorothy, whom he hadn't seen in a long while.
<br><br>
"Dorothy…"
<br><br>
Zen wasn't very surprised upon seeing her face because he had an earlier suspicion when the door appeared behind him.
<br><br>
But still, he couldn't hide the joy and excitement as he saw her with his eyes.
<br><br>
Dorothy clenched her fists tightly to control her emotions. About half a minute passed before she was able to answer Zen's question. "These creatures are from the Bold Conjecture House of the Human Spirit Sect."
<br><br>
"The Bold Conjecture House… I see…" Zen nodded, immediately understanding the meaning behind her words.
<br><br>
He had heard of the name of this house so many times. It could be said that its members were the founders of the entire Human Spirit Sect, and were also known as the smartest group of people within the sect. Even Elder Xue, who helped him obtain the ancestry-level bloodline, came from the Bold Conjecture House.
<br><br>
As Zen finished speaking, Dorothy wasn't able to hold her emotions anymore, and suddenly rushed and threw herself in Zen's arms.
<br><br>
"I'm so sorry, I came in too late. We might have the chance to avoid all this," she said in a muffled voice as she cried on Zen's chest.
<br><br>
Zen immediately understood when Dorothy said that she was late, but for a moment, he was a bit reluctant to realize what "chance" she was pertaining to. Then he smiled bitterly and said, "It's indeed a little late, but even if you came a bit earlier, I'm afraid that nothing would have changed."
<br><br>
"Why? What do you mean?" Dorothy asked with a puzzled expression as she wiped her tears.
<br><br>
"Because even if you were able to wake Kincaid up, he wouldn't be able to resist such an existence," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
"No way!"
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid is the strongest warrior in the Human Spirit Sect. If he woke up, you'll see that he would be much stronger than that guy!"
<br><br>
"That's right. Master Kincaid is our last hope. We must find him at once!"
<br><br>
several long-haired monsters retorted and were convinced that Kincaid was the answer to surpass this overwhelming crisis.
<br><br>
But Zen just gently smiled and said, "Even if Master Kincaid used that sword, he might not be as powerful as me."
<br><br>
"How can you even be sure about that?" one of the long-haired monsters reacted in a cynical tone.
<br><br>
"How?" Zen thought for a moment and said, "Because Elder Xue helped me obtain the ancestry-level bloodline. I'm the only one who could unleash the power of that sword to the fullest."
<br><br>
"W-what?!"
<br><br>
"How is that even possible?"
<br><br>
"You mean that you have the ancestry-level bloodline within your body?"
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters were all stunned. That was the only time that they remembered Elder Xue. He left the Bold Conjecture House a long time ago before he headed for the Deep Space.
<br><br>
Chapter 4227 Satisfy His Obsession In the past, both the Bold Conjecture House and Kincaid himself had opposed Elder Xue's idea of venturing into the Deep Space.
<br><br>
As a result, Elder Xue decided to leave abruptly, without so much as a goodbye. He only left a letter for them.
<br><br>
After that, they hadn't heard from him. After all this time, they figured he had perished.
<br><br>
And yet, now, Zen was claiming he had news from Elder Xue! Hence they felt shock mixed with doubt.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue? How is it possible that you saw him?" a long-haired monster inquired, his tone littered with doubt.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue went to the Deep Space alone back then," another long-haired monster mused aloud. "Although we thought he wouldn't survive, he did manage to avoid the catastrophe that happened in the main world..."
<br><br>
"Never mind that, he found the way to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline!"
<br><br>
"When and where did you see him?"
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters buzzed with questions, their eyes brimming with excitement.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head regretfully. "I didn't see him personally, but someone else did."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's remnant soul emerged from above Zen's head.
<br><br>
He then recounted how he had met Elder Xue. He explained how he had hidden in the Jade Pure Realm and how Elder Xue had planned everything.
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters all listened closely, their shock steadily growing with each story the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord told.
<br><br>
Although they all shared the same roots and were all very smart creatures, they couldn't deny that they were impressed by how far Elder Xue had come.
<br><br>
"I must admit, Elder Xue is the most far-sighted person amongst the Bold Conjecture House..."
<br><br>
"I didn't expect him to come so far!"
<br><br>
"We should have believed him back then..."
<br><br>
While the other long-haired monsters discussed excitedly, a white-haired monster slowly took a few steps forward. "I was wrong about Elder Xue,"
<br><br>
he suddenly said, his tone filled with regret. "I had even scolded him back then. I didn't know he had so much alone..." Then, he smiled. "But what's important is, he made it!"
<br><br>
"May I know your name?" Zen asked him politely.
<br><br>
The white-haired monster cupped his hands courteously and said, "I am Hilario Wen, the chief of the Bold Conjecture House."
<br><br>
The strongest person in the Human Spirit Sect was Kincaid, the Human Spirit King. Below him were the Ten Directions House and the Bold Conjecture House. The two houses were responsible for military and civil affairs, respectively. Hence, Hilario was in charge of the latter.
<br><br>
Zen also cupped his hands and bowed in return.
<br><br>
Hilario studied Zen carefully. "The ancestry-level bloodline is believed to be the origin of everything, and it can provide endless power. If that sword was in your possession, you should've been invincible in this world."
<br><br>
There was a tinge of doubt in his voice. He still felt it was hard to believe Zen's words.
<br><br>
The Bold Conjecture House had made many relevant conjectures. Hilario had deduced that the strongest power in the main world was in theory the combination of the ancestry-level bloodline and that sword. Theoretically, anyone who owned both should be able to take control of everything.
<br><br>
"My enemy came from the world above the Deep Space. He is a higherlevel opponent," Zen explained, seeing they still doubted him.
<br><br>
Hilario was stunned for a moment. "Do you mean he is someone from the sixth-grade world?"
<br><br>
The other long-haired monsters who had been discussing amongst themselves suddenly stopped to listen. They too were intrigued by their conversation.
<br><br>
These creatures had taken it upon themselves to explore the truth of the world.
<br><br>
Thus, while they were almost certain that there was a higher-grade world above the Deep Space, they had figured that it was too difficult for them to explore even the Deep Space itself. Even if there was a higher-grade world, it was most likely something beyond their understanding, so it only existed in their assumptions.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "No. In fact, he might be from the seventh, eighth, or even ninth-grade world..."
<br><br>
"What?!"
<br><br>
"How is that possible? How could there be such an existence?"
<br><br>
"Impossible! You must be joking!"
<br><br>
Chaos erupted amongst the long-haired monsters. They just couldn't believe Zen's words.
<br><br>
"Believe it or not," Zen said indifferently. "The world you lived in was downgraded from the higher-grade worlds by him. That's why he's called 'the downgrader'."
<br><br>
"Why would he do such a thing?" Hilario queried, his curiosity piqued.
<br><br>
"Who knows?" Zen shrugged. "Maybe this was his way of dealing with someone. Or perhaps he was trying to escape from someone..."
<br><br>
The only information Zen garnered from the humanoid creature was that he had faced an opponent named "Clarence".
<br><br>
"It's no wonder, then." Hilario shook his head and sighed. "No wonder you lost..." He finally understood how Zen had been defeated.
<br><br>
Now that Zen, who possessed the ancestry-level bloodline, had been defeated, it would be useless even if they did awaken Kincaid. Although Kincaid was powerful, he would never do better than Zen. They had heavily underestimated their enemy.
<br><br>
"Well, then... Can't I see my father? Can't your curses be removed now?"
<br><br>
Dorothy asked, tears still brimming in her bright eyes.
<br><br>
"Your father must be the Human Spirit King, Kincaid, right?" Zen gently stroked her hair, smiling at her fondly. When he had seen the woman who looked exactly like Dorothy in the altar, Zen guessed the truth of the matter.
<br><br>
"Yes." She nodded.
<br><br>
At first, Dorothy didn't know much about it, but gradually, it dawned on her.
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his hand. With a flash of blue light from his Sumeru Space, a Treacherous Being emerged from inside. It was the Human Spirit King, Kincaid.
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters didn't expect that Zen would hide the Human Spirit King in his Sumeru Space. They immediately became overcome with excitement when they recognized that the Treacherous Being before them was their king.
<br><br>
"King!"
<br><br>
"It's our king!"
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid!"
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters gathered around him excitedly.
<br><br>
"Get out of the way!" Hilario barked irritably.
<br><br>
After the long-haired monsters retreated a distance, Hilario gently lifted Kincaid from the ground.
<br><br>
As a sleeping-type Treacherous Being, Kincaid did not show any resistance whatsoever. Hilario tried to awaken him, "Master Kincaid! Master Kincaid! Look! This is your daughter! Can you see her? Can you wake up?"
<br><br>
As strange as it seemed, it was common practice to wake up Treacherous Beings by using their loved ones.
<br><br>
Each Treacherous Being had differing obsessions, so they couldn't be awakened in the same way. For example, Sheehan, the Bird Spirit King, who had a strong tendency of self-destruction, definitely couldn't be awakened in this way.
<br><br>
In the past, Kincaid was known to cherish his family the most, so this method had a good chance of working.
<br><br>
Eyeing the father she'd never met, Dorothy felt a little nervous.
<br><br>
Although she was actually the reincarnation of his daughter, her memories of the previous life didn't come with her. Thus, this father was a total stranger to her.
<br><br>
Dorothy had been brought up by Yasamin since she was a child, and she had been well taken care of in the Origin Mountain. It could be said that she was the apple of everyone's eye back home, but at the back of her mind, she hoped to see her parents all this time.
<br><br>
Now that she stood before her father, she felt mixed feelings.
<br><br>
Inside the Treacherous Being's body, Kincaid did not have a clear perception of the outside world. He was trapped in the cage of obsession, and his children had been his strongest obsession. When Dorothy was presented in front of him, alive, this information was like a beacon of light that shone into his dark world.
<br><br>
The cage that bound him started to break little by little...
<br><br>
"Has he woken up?"
<br><br>
one of the long-haired monsters grumbled after waiting for a long while.
<br><br>
"Shut up!"
<br><br>
The remaining long-haired monsters glared at him fiercely, shutting him up immediately.
<br><br>
Just then, Kincaid slowly raised his hand and stroked Dorothy's face. His eyes opened slowly, only to reveal tears streaming down his face.
<br><br>
Although the general atmosphere had been a bit glum, what with the news of Zen losing the irregular heavy sword, once they saw the Human Spirit King wake up, the mood instantly brightened.
<br><br>
At least...
<br><br>
They finally completed their mission.
<br><br>
Kincaid stared at Dorothy's face for a long while, his eyes filled with affection. Then, he slowly shifted his gaze to Zen.
<br><br>
"Young man, are you the one who took me out of the altar?" Kincaid asked.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "Please forgive me, Master Kincaid. I took your sword but failed to keep it. It's in someone else's possession now."
<br><br>
Chapter 4228 The New Hope Since Kincaid was put into the Sumeru Space by Zen, he was completely cut off from the outside world.
<br><br>
He didn't realize that his sword had already been lost until Zen told him.
<br><br>
As he heard this piece of news, his hand greatly trembled and a look of extreme surprise appeared on his face. "It fell into the hands of the Snake Spirit King?"
<br><br>
"No. It is an existence that is even far stronger than the Snake Spirit King," Zen replied.
<br><br>
Then, Zen took the liberty of telling him what had happened in his battle against the humanoid being.
<br><br>
When Zen mentioned the ancestry-level bloodline, Kincaid wasn't able to hide his excitement. He was just as thrilled as the others from the Bold Conjecture House. Afterward, the topic went back to Elder Xue, and Zen repeated what he had said to the others.
<br><br>
Hearing all of this, Kincaid wasn't able to keep his calm for a long time.
<br><br>
The development of the situation was far beyond his expectation. They were in such a precarious condition, and even time was their enemy.
<br><br>
Since a long time ago, Kincaid had hated Cornelius to the core. Even if he racked his mind, he couldn't figure out a sensible reason why Cornelius wanted to destroy the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
But now, the mystery had been revealed. He came to understand everything.
<br><br>
Just as Zen had said, the downgrader was a warrior from the world of a higher grade, and once he got a hold of the irregular heavy sword, no one would probably have the chance to defeat him.
<br><br>
"Since the downgrader could downgrade the world from a higher grade to a lower one, his strength should be something that we can't fight against.
<br><br>
Then, why is he hiding behind Cornelius's shadow?" Kincaid was a little confused about this part.
<br><br>
"I think it is because he has lost a large portion of his strength, and the heavy sword was his way to make up for it," Zen replied. "My basis for saying that is because the Deep Space hasn't been completely downgraded yet, and only a small portion of the main world has been downgraded."
<br><br>
Zen was pointing out that if the downgrader possessed all of his original power, there was no need for him to manipulate the Snake Spirit King. He could just directly perform the downgrade.
<br><br>
"I get your point. If that's the case, he will begin the downgrade after he got my sword, right?" Kincaid emphasized.
<br><br>
After all, he was a creature of the main world. Living in the third-grade world made him feel restricted as if his eyes were blindfolded.
<br><br>
"You're right. Even before he got the sword, the downgrade has already begun. He wants to control the entire chaos and expand it outwards," Zen explained.
<br><br>
Although this was just speculation at first, it had been later confirmed by the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had once described the process of downgrading to Zen. At first, it would seem to begin from a bead of water dropping into a pond, which would then create a small bubble. Then, this bubble would expand indefinitely until it finally drained all the water in the entire pond. When the bubble occupied all the space that originally belonged to the water in pond, it was when the downgrade was completed.
<br><br>
After the downgrader came to the main world, he was only able to trick the Four Spirits Sect through the Snake Spirit King. Perhaps, his strength was not enough, or maybe he had lost some of his abilities. One could only speculate on the real reason behind it. Then, the Four Spirits Sect, completely unaware of the downgrader's ploy, sent out the world builders to drop the beads of water to create bubbles.
<br><br>
However, the bubbles they created could not expand indefinitely.
<br><br>
Kincaid took a deep breath to process all the information he acquired.
<br><br>
Then out of nowhere, he asked a question that everyone had overlooked.
<br><br>
"Where is Elder Xue now? Where did he go after he came to the chaos?"
<br><br>
He wanted to know whether Elder Xue was dead or alive. In his mind, the whereabouts of the elder might somehow give them a clue that would lead to something.
<br><br>
The eyes of the long-haired monsters gazed upon the top of Zen's head.
<br><br>
Actually, only the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had come into contact with Elder Xue.
<br><br>
"He came to the Jade Pure Realm and sent me a message through a dream, telling me to travel through the main world. Then, he just left without saying anything. There was no information about where he would go afterward," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord answered.
<br><br>
"Hmm, he didn't tell you where he went…" Kincaid rubbed his chin and thought for a while before asking, "Was it his real self that came, or only an avatar of him?"
<br><br>
This question stumped the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. He never thought of paying attention to this seemingly minor detail at that moment.
<br><br>
After all, he was hiding in the Jade Pure Realm at that time. With the sudden appearance of such an important person, he became so excited that he ignored all other details.
<br><br>
However, he was a powerful Eternal Realm warrior, so the memories hidden in his soul would also be indelible. With that, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord quickly closed his eyes and searched for his memories of the past.
<br><br>
As he opened his eyes, a strange expression was visibly seen on his face.
<br><br>
He then said, "Elder Xue did appear very suddenly. At that time, I thought that he used the Grand Teleportation to come over, and when he left, his disappearance was even more sudden. It seemed that he just literally vanished before my eyes, without causing any space fluctuations…"
<br><br>
Upon hearing what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, Kincaid's eyes lit up. "He must have used the Heaven Projection, which could project him in a lower-grade world. It seems that Elder Xue didn't personally come to you."
<br><br>
"But what about the Grand Weapon Refining Method and the golden page that he gave me?" The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord still had doubts.
<br><br>
"It's not difficult for him to pass these down to you through his projection," Kincaid said confidently. "Elder Xue is very likely to be alive.
<br><br>
He's still probably in the Deep Space."
<br><br>
At this point, Hilario couldn't help but interrupt Kincaid. He thought that they had been off the topic for some time now. "Master Kincaid, I don't think this is the time to talk about whether Elder Xue is alive or not.
<br><br>
Forgive my presumptuousness, but how should we deal with the downgrader now? Even Zen, who has absorbed the ancestry-level bloodline and obtained your sword was defeated by him!"
<br><br>
Of course, Kincaid knew that their current situation was very dangerous.
<br><br>
One could even say that their lives were hanging by a thread that could break at any minute.
<br><br>
All of the currently present long-haired monsters had stayed in this damned place for so long, still hoping that one day, they would be able to return to the main world. He could feel how disappointed they were when they realized that all their hopes were utterly destroyed.
<br><br>
However, Kincaid was a person who was beyond exceptional. He had always been calm and perceptive even when faced with overwhelming pressure. Moreover, he never failed to exhibit a gentle and elegant aura.
<br><br>
After all, his perspective as the leader of the Human Spirit Sect was to always keep a level head even when facing the worst situations.
<br><br>
"There is more than one powerful sword in the Deep Space," Kincaid said abruptly.
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters were all surprised to hear this. "You mean that there's a second one?!" Hilario couldn't help but exclaim.
<br><br>
Kincaid nodded and said, "Well, it's not necessarily a sword, but I'm sure that another weapon like the heavy sword exists. It might be a saber, a spear, or anything, but it definitely is out there."
<br><br>
"How are you so sure about this, Master Kincaid?" Zen asked, knowing that this was a matter of great importance.
<br><br>
Kincaid smiled faintly and started explaining. "The layout of the Deep Space is completely different from that of the main world. In the main world, the Four Spirits Sect was the dominant force, while in the Deep Space, the power was only divided between the Cinnabar race and Fostering race. These two great races had been fighting with each other for countless years, and the war between them continued until the Deep Space finally collapsed."
<br><br>
"It must mean that these two races were evenly matched in terms of strength," Zen speculated. "But it's still hard to believe that during that long-term war, neither of the two sides was able to gain the upper hand.
<br><br>
Usually, one side will inevitably continue to rise and the other one will decline. It's very difficult to maintain such a balance."
<br><br>
"That is correct… in normal circumstances." Kincaid continued, "What maintained the balance between the two great forces were the heavy sword that belonged to the emperor of the Cinnabar race, and the other object, with almost the same prowess as the sword, that belonged to the Fostering race."
<br><br>
This was not something that Kincaid just deduced. Back then, when he obtained the sword of the Cinnabar race, he was also able to obtain some information indicating that the Fostering race had the same weapon, which granted them the power to withstand the Cinnabar race.
<br><br>
Of course, Kincaid became curious and tried to look for it, but he didn't succeed. After all, the broken Deep Space was a vast and extremely dangerous place.
<br><br>
Realizing what Kincaid was trying to say, Zen butted in, "Now, we have to search for this weapon, right?"
<br><br>
Kincaid nodded repeatedly. "That's why I have to make sure that Elder Xue is still alive and is still somewhere in the Deep Space. No one among us can return to the main world, meaning that we also can't reach the Deep Space. If we want to find this object, we can only rely on him."
<br><br>
Everyone was amazed at how fast Kincaid was able to come up with a feasible solution. Just now, everyone was still immersed in despair and felt that the situation was completely hopeless. Even Zen was almost on the brink of giving up. However, Kincaid was the only one who was not affected by the oppressive pressure that the situation was bringing. In fact, he was able to find a glimmer of hope in a very short time. He was really born with tremendous talents that could turn the tables just when everything seemed to be already falling apart.
<br><br>
Chapter 4229 The End Of The World A sense of relief washed over those gathered in the passageway.
<br><br>
They knew the chances were slim with what Kincaid said, but at least there was a possibility.
<br><br>
"But even if Elder Xue was alive, how would we get in touch with him?"
<br><br>
Hilario pointed out.
<br><br>
It was a serious question and a realistic concern, though it sounded pessimistic.
<br><br>
They were in the third-grade world now. They'd have to cross the main world to enter the Deep Space and reach Elder Xue.
<br><br>
But the entire main world had become a barren wasteland after the calamity Cornelius brought upon it. Neither the Treacherous Beings nor the long-haired monsters could return.
<br><br>
New creatures and races had appeared in the main world over time, but they were entirely different to those in the past.
<br><br>
The long-haired monsters looked hopefully at Kincaid, as well.
<br><br>
They were eagerly waiting for a definite answer, too.
<br><br>
They were more afraid of having no purpose in life than death itself. They would dedicate themselves to any goal Kincaid gave them.
<br><br>
A look of hesitation flashed across Kincaid's face.
<br><br>
If they couldn't enter the main world, then they couldn't reach the Deep Space.
<br><br>
There was no way to communicate with Elder Xue unless he reached out himself using the Heaven Projection.
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid, we have two human beings in the main world," Zen offered.
<br><br>
"You have people there?" Kincaid looked surprised. "But if they haven't gone through the Red Jade Rite, wouldn't it be difficult for them to move around in the main world?"
<br><br>
The Red Jade Rite was an exclusive method of the Four Spirits Sect allowing creatures from the third-grade world to enter the fourth-grade world.
<br><br>
But if even the Four Spirits Sect could no longer use the Red Jade Rite, how could anyone else? "One of them indeed has been rendered immobile, but the other, my son, can walk freely throughout the main world even without having undergone the Red Jade Rite," Zen responded.
<br><br>
"Really?" Kincaid's eyes lit up. "Where is he now?"
<br><br>
"He has climbed to the top of a holy pillar," Zen said.
<br><br>
Kincaid looked impressed.
<br><br>
"It's amazing someone from the secondary world was able to get that far! I once captured some powerhouses of the third-grade world and let them into the main world. However, they immediately lost their sight and hearing as soon as they entered there without going through the rite!"
<br><br>
The Red Jade Rite was a method created by the Bold Conjecture House which had concluded, based on many experiments, that the third-grade world creatures could only survive in the third-grade world. They were unable to inhabit the main world without external intervention.
<br><br>
Powerful individuals like Ziya had tried many times, but even he could only barely walk in the main world.
<br><br>
"Would we be able to contact him?" Kincaid pressed, harboring none of the doubts his companions had on what Zen said.
<br><br>
Zen thought for a moment. "Yes. He can deliver information through an Other Shore Token, but he is unable to do that of late as he is adjusting its ability."
<br><br>
Kincaid was ecstatic. "Great!"
<br><br>
He began clapping.
<br><br>
Anyone who knew Kincaid knew of his habit of clapping his hands when he was excited.
<br><br>
"Fate truly works in mysterious ways. The Deep Space should have been beyond us, but now, we have this chance! We must seize it!" Kincaid said, beaming.
<br><br>
As things were settling down at the passageway, the Other Shore was in a state of chaos.
<br><br>
The golden light columns that had appeared had thrown all the inhabitants of Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore in a state of panic.
<br><br>
What kind of theurgy was it that it could even directly pierce through the Other Shore? The Grandmaster of Heaven and the Element Spirit Civilization had been the first to see this threat coming.
<br><br>
They had not personally participated in the battle that had happened in the Jade Pure Realm, but they knew it would impact the Other Shore tremendously.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit Civilization had been hoping that the Snake Spirit Sect would win.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was thinking how to negotiate with the Monkey Spirit Sect after the Bird Spirit Sect had secured victory in battle.
<br><br>
He had been monitoring the situation from the Supreme Pure Realm when he noticed that the water in the Divine River began to flow backwards! It was a first in all of history. He knew it signaled great turmoil in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Just then, black circular shadows appeared in the sky. Purple-black energy spheres started pouring down from them.
<br><br>
These energy spheres were powerful and near-unstoppable. They had just decimated the Jade Pure Realm and had now leaked through to the Supreme Pure Realm. They would soon ravage the entire Other Shore if left unhampered! The humanoid creature had no intention of stopping at present.
<br><br>
A purple light appeared in the distance and began to spread. As it did, a huge bird-shaped Treacherous Being appeared in front of the humanoid creature. It was the Bird Spirit King, Sheehan, who remained unawakened.
<br><br>
Sheehan, in fact, could never be awakened. He was already under the complete control of the humanoid creature. According to his plan, if the Snake Spirit King failed, the humanoid creature would use the Bird Spirit King instead.
<br><br>
In the battle with Zen, the humanoid creature had used a clever method to grab the sword, so the Bird Spirit King never had a chance to fight.
<br><br>
Instead of killing him, however, the humanoid creature chose to just use him as a mount.
<br><br>
Sheehan lowered his head obediently while the humanoid creature stepped onto his back.
<br><br>
Since the energy spheres had completely devastated the Jade Pure Realm, the humanoid creature had been able to see though to the Supreme Pure Realm. The energy spheres had also allowed him to find the Grandmaster of Heaven from far away.
<br><br>
As soon as the Grandmaster of Heaven spotted the humanoid creature in the distant sky, he froze in shock.
<br><br>
He had braced himself for this, but now it was here, and it seemed to be a hundred times worse than he had ever imagined.
<br><br>
The entire Jade Pure Realm was destroyed.
<br><br>
And the Bird Spirit King was enslaved by that strange creature.
<br><br>
How could things have gotten this bad? The humanoid creature's sharp eyes fell on the Grandmaster of Heaven. It sent chills down his spine.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven hurriedly took out the Descending Ring. He knew the sensible thing to do right now was to get away and keep himself safe. After all, his greatest protector had already fallen.
<br><br>
The humanoid creature just scoffed seeing the Grandmaster of Heaven scramble to escape.
<br><br>
His mocking laughter rang through the air as he rode the Bird Spirit King away.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven gritted his teeth and hissed in humiliation. As the leader of the Nihility race, he was held in high esteem on the Other Shore. But now, he was looked down upon. He had the sudden urge to fight the humanoid creature.
<br><br>
But he soon snapped out of it as he noticed more purple-black energy spheres falling around him. He activated the Descending Ring and disappeared from the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
As this happened, the purple-black energy spheres also started appearing in the sky of the Grand Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Many Other Shore races in the Grand Pure Realm were gripped with horror upon seeing them. They never imagined the Three Purities Stage would be destroyed.
<br><br>
Some of the Other Shore creatures quickly began to flee toward Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, the Grand Plain Stage, but most of them were paralyzed by shock. By the time they gathered their wits about them, it was too late.
<br><br>
They could do nothing but watch as their lives, their friends and family, and their homeland for billions of years were wiped out in a snap.
<br><br>
Chapter 4230 Survivors In the Source World, on a black ship, a golden ring suddenly appeared.
<br><br>
From below this golden ring, a figure then emerged; it was the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"G... Grandmaster of Heaven, what business do you have here?" asked Shera as she strode towards him, astonished by his arrival.
<br><br>
People from the Other Shore would usually inform the Black Ship first before they showed up. Only after the crew had made the arrangements would they land at the world.
<br><br>
Since the Grandmaster of Heaven had shown up unannounced, Shera suspected something major must have happened on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"The Three Purities Stage has collapsed to ruins," revealed the Grandmaster of Heaven with pure shock written all across his face. He was having trouble believing what took place himself.
<br><br>
He had been to the Jade Pure Realm before and knew what the Treacherous Beings were capable of. But even so, destroying the Three Purities Stage was not easy work.
<br><br>
"What did you say?" Shera covered her mouth, overtaken by surprise.
<br><br>
'The Three Purities Stage represents the top force on the Other Shore, how could it come to such an end?' she wondered.
<br><br>
"Who's responsible for the destruction? Is it the Snake Spirit King?"
<br><br>
A voice came from beside the Grandmaster of Heaven. A dark green grass then began growing rapidly on the deck and blooming, before a bean pod formed.
<br><br>
The pod opened and a green creature came out. The blurry figure cleared into the Evil God. It was he who threw these questions at the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven looked on at him in admiration on seeing his ability to create his appearance in that way. 'This guy is really quite proficient in the laws of the Source World.
<br><br>
I heard he can possess other creatures and live within them. It now seems he is able to materialize a living being of his own and appear like this, ' thought the Grandmaster of Heaven to himself.
<br><br>
"It was not the Snake Spirit King. It's someone with a strange appearance; he is humanoid," replied the Grandmaster of Heaven, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Who is he? Where is he from?" asked the Evil God with his head tilted in curiosity.
<br><br>
"I have no clue," answered the Grandmaster of Heaven with a deep frown.
<br><br>
"What? Even you do not know who he is?" questioned the Evil God with raised eyebrows.
<br><br>
He was even more arrogant than before. In his eyes, the Grandmaster of Heaven was someone to provide him with any useful information he might need. If he couldn't even do that, he was useless to him.
<br><br>
"I wasn't in the Jade Pure Realm when the fight broke out and so I have no knowledge of what took place there," the Grandmaster of Heaven responded with his eyebrows furrowed, disappointed by his ignorance. He could tell by his voice and expression that the Evil God did not take him seriously and that no doubt got under his skin.
<br><br>
"What about the Bird Spirit Sect? What became of the bird spirits?"
<br><br>
inquired the Evil God.
<br><br>
"The Bird Spirit King could not even defend himself and is now under that creature's control," answered the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Bird Spirit Sect had fallen apart, leaving the Nihility race without protection. The Grandmaster of Heaven replied only to the Evil God.
<br><br>
Considering his current situation, he had no choice but to endure his ill treatment.
<br><br>
"What? You mean to say that even the Bird Spirit King was controlled?"
<br><br>
repeated the Evil God as a seriousness began filling his eyes.
<br><br>
He knew what the Monkey Spirit King was capable of and assumed the Bird Spirit King was around the same level in terms of strength.
<br><br>
However, since the Grandmaster of Heaven knew little about the humanoid creature, the Evil God could not be sure of his strength.
<br><br>
Just then, another golden ring emerged above the center of the ship.
<br><br>
The Evil God, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Shera all looked up at the same time. 'Who else is coming? Are there any survivors in the Jade Pure Realm?' wondered the three of them, surprised by what was unfolding.
<br><br>
The outline of a huge bird then became visible beneath the golden ring.
<br><br>
"It is a Bird Master?" guessed the Evil God with a new light in his eyes.
<br><br>
Before long, one of the Bird Masters of the Bird Spirit Sect came into view. It was none other than Duran.
<br><br>
"Master Duran, you..." Duran's presence caught the Grandmaster of Heaven by great surprise.
<br><br>
"The Jade Pure Realm has been destroyed. I was lucky to have made it out alive," Duran announced indifferently, a visible sadness in his eyes.
<br><br>
"What about the other Bird Masters?" inquired the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Lawler and Orval didn't make it. In fact, all those who tried attacking the Snake Spirit Sect died at the hands of the downgrader," answered Duran flatly.
<br><br>
Zen had proposed holding onto the Bird Masters' coordinates before they set foot in the Jade Pure Realm. The Bird Spirit Sect stood on the opposite side of the human race after all.
<br><br>
Duran had handed his coordinates over to Zen and they were destroyed when the energy balls hit the Monkey Spirit King. But just as Sewell did, Duran had two sets of coordinates and he could travel back and forth between them.
<br><br>
After he was killed and his coordinates were removed, Duran was resurrected using his second set of coordinates. They were placed on the edge of the Jade Pure Realm and although the energy balls shone on the Jade Pure Realm, they did not reach its corner.
<br><br>
Duran chose to come to the Source World using the Descending Ring after his rebirth.
<br><br>
"The downgrader? Is he that powerful?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
Last time Duran had arrived at the Source World, he tried to lure him to their side. But now those hopes had disappeared and the plans no longer existed. "The downgrader is far stronger than you could imagine. His strength is beyond everyone in the main world. We are done for. We just have to accept it," said Duran in despair.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's and Shera's hearts both stopped in fear when they heard these words. 'Is the downgrader really so powerful?' they both wondered.
<br><br>
The Evil God, however, smiled seeming unfazed by all this. "Is that so? Is he really all that difficult to deal with that we ought to just give in?"
<br><br>
"You're just a creature of the third-grade world. You can't even comprehend all that goes on in the main world. Do you honestly think you'll be any kind of match for a being from the Deep Space?" Duran blurted, impatient with his challenging words.
<br><br>
He had never cared for the Evil God's arrogance. Now that he felt they would all die, he felt no need to keep up the act and spoke his true feelings.
<br><br>
His retorts did not bother the Evil God. The Evil God snapped his fingers and a wisp of cyan flames appeared. "Is this one of the bloodline powers in the main world?" asked the Evil God tauntingly.
<br><br>
With a glance at the fire, Duran responded, "The sixth ability of the destruction quadrant. That's no big deal. Don't waste my time showing that off in front of me!"
<br><br>
The Evil God snapped his fingers and another flame arose, this time purple. "This is also a bloodline power of the main world, right?" he asked again.
<br><br>
"The third ability of the destruction quadrant," Duran snorted defiantly.
<br><br>
These two types of fire were among the most common abilities obtained from the ancestry-level bloodline, so Duran recognized them at a glance.
<br><br>
But he had missed a significant detail; where had the Evil God acquired these bloodline powers? The Grandmaster of Heaven had not ignored it though. "Evil God, you have never been to the Eternal Scroll Painting. How did you get your hands on those?" he asked, staring at him incredulously.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's words brought something to Duran's mind.
<br><br>
"Where did you get the bloodline powers? Did you reach the Eternal Realm in the Source World?" he asked, narrowing his eyes at the Evil God.
<br><br>
As far as he knew, although there were Eternal Realm warriors in the Source World, the root-level bloodlines they had inherited were garbage.
<br><br>
Even if the Evil God reached the Eternal Realm, acquiring the two flames that he had displayed was impossible. He too now began wondering how he had come to possess these two bloodline powers.
<br><br>
The Evil God didn't answer. Instead he smiled and suggested, "How about some magic? The third flame..."
<br><br>
Whoosh! A white fire burst from the Evil God's mouth. It was the twelfth ability of the destruction quadrant.
<br><br>
The three flames quickly intertwined.
<br><br>
"Did you blend some bloodlines?" Duran mused calmly.
<br><br>
That he had acquired the bloodline powers was surprising, but blending some bloodlines was not difficult. In the Four Spirits Sect, many beings at Duran's level knew how to blend bloodlines.
<br><br>
Chapter 4231 The Energy Ball The Evil God remained calm.
<br><br>
Once again, he waved his left hand. The fourth flame rose slowly from his palm.
<br><br>
Seeing this, the Grandmaster of Heaven appeared even more shocked.
<br><br>
'I heard that the Evil God was able to cultivate the three thousand Godly Ways. Furthermore, he managed to integrate them. But how did he get his hands on the bloodline powers? Did he get them through the three thousand Godly Ways? That would be impossible!' the Grandmaster of Heaven thought to himself as he stared at the flame.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, something incredible happened.
<br><br>
The fourth flame had instantly merged with the mixture of the other three flames.
<br><br>
Soon after, the Evil God manifested a faint purple bloodline power. This power was from the life quadrant. Without any sign of hesitation, he combined this with the mixture of the four flames.
<br><br>
"That's it? Is that the magic you wanted to show me?" Duran was already getting impatient.
<br><br>
The Evil God's performance of blending the bloodlines meant nothing to him. He actually found it quite boring.
<br><br>
"Be patient and watch," replied the Evil God with a confident smile.
<br><br>
Out of nowhere, they heard a swishing sound. Phew! They heard it one after another.
<br><br>
The Evil God snapped his fingers several times. Each time, more bloodline powers kept appearing. They immediately merged with the mixture of those he had shown before.
<br><br>
Duran was utterly bewildered when he saw so many different kinds of blood powers.
<br><br>
He pondered upon this. 'The Evil God is incredible! How was he able to obtain that many kinds of bloodline powers?' He blended about thirty bloodline powers. Afterward, it formed a black and red ball. It began to expand for a second and then shrunk the next. It was like a human's heart beating madly. It seemed like it might explode at any point in time.
<br><br>
Shera and the Grandmaster of Heaven were very apprehensive about the energy contained inside the ball.
<br><br>
If the ball exploded, it wouldn't kill the Evil God and Duran. After all, the Evil God had infinite avatars and Duran was a Treacherous Being. On the other hand, Shera and the Grandmaster of Heaven wouldn't be able to survive the explosion.
<br><br>
"What on earth is this?" Duran asked with furrowed brows.
<br><br>
In fact, he didn't understand why the Evil God would show this to him.
<br><br>
Based from his observation, it was not that easy for the Evil God to blend the energies.
<br><br>
Moreover, the power of the destruction quadrant was extremely unstable.
<br><br>
He wondered what the purpose of the Evil God was for doing this.
<br><br>
The black and red ball sprang from the Evil God's hand and traveled for a distance. At that moment, he stretched out his hand and made a cubic space to envelope the ball.
<br><br>
The cubic space was stable because it contained the truth energy. Even masters at the Grandmaster of Heaven's level would have a hard time breaking it.
<br><br>
With a wave of his hand, the Evil God made another cubic space and covered the ball. He proceeded to make more spaces to fully wrap the ball.
<br><br>
Each cubic space was an inch larger than the previous one. The Evil God didn't stop until he acquired fifty layers of it.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Duran, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and Shera remained silent. All they could do was watch.
<br><br>
They decided to wait patiently and see what the Evil God was up to. They were compelled to do so by their curiosity and the fact that they didn't have any choice.
<br><br>
Afterward, the Evil God pointed at the ball inside the cubic spaces.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he shouted, "Explode!"
<br><br>
Sizzle! Boom! A loud booming sound reached their ears.
<br><br>
The black and red ball exploded within the cubic spaces. Raging fire filled the insides.
<br><br>
The upper layer was engulfed in light green flames. Meanwhile, the lower layer was a swirling vortex. The two forces eroded each other.
<br><br>
"That was incredible!" Shera exclaimed. Her eyes lit up with amazement.
<br><br>
The flames were trapped within the fifty cubic spaces. Therefore, she was not afraid of getting hurt anymore.
<br><br>
The flames continued to move down. Finally, the first layer of cubic space couldn't withstand them any longer. They heard a muffled sound. After that, the first layer of cubic space disappeared into thin air. It was immediately followed by the second, third, and fourth layers.
<br><br>
Simply put, the cubic spaces were now collapsing.
<br><br>
As they did, the flames became more violent.
<br><br>
"Evil God, over twenty cubic spaces have been broken," reminded the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God remained composed and calm as he stared at the flames. "Focus on the fire." He gestured at the Grandmaster of Heaven to remain silent.
<br><br>
In a mere couple seconds, more than twenty spaces vanished.
<br><br>
If it continued at this rate, the fire would be able to break all of the cubic spaces soon.
<br><br>
The power of space emerged from Shera. As soon as the fire broke free, she would immediately escape.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven didn't do that. He thought that it would be embarrassing. He was at the Eternal Realm. If he acted like Shera, it would mean that he was a coward. Hence, he pretended to be calm even though he felt really anxious.
<br><br>
When there were only two cubic spaces left, the flames stopped spreading.
<br><br>
Soon enough, they began to vanish.
<br><br>
After the flames disappeared, they left a black and red item inside the cubic spaces. It looked like an ore.
<br><br>
"What is that? Is it an ore?" Duran's curiosity was aroused.
<br><br>
All the Bird Masters were incredibly sensitive. He had a feeling that it was not a common ore.
<br><br>
The Evil God put his hand into the square spaces. He carefully took out the black and red ore. At the same time, he spoke, "This thing is very powerful. I will show you what it can do."
<br><br>
The Evil God threw the ore into the distance. As it rotated in the air, he released a streak of lightning.
<br><br>
The lightning struck the ore.
<br><br>
At that moment, the ore exploded and turned into an energy ball. Its diameter was hundreds of feet long.
<br><br>
"Unbelievable! This, this is..." The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes almost popped out as he saw the energy ball. Disbelief and astonishment were written all over his face.
<br><br>
Even though Duran remained silent, he was obviously shaken up by what he just witnessed. He realized that the energy ball released by the Evil God was similar to those that the downgrader had shown.
<br><br>
"What is the matter, sir?" Shera asked the Grandmaster of Heaven confusedly.
<br><br>
"That energy ball is exactly the same as those that obliterated the entire Three Purities Stage," replied the Grandmaster of Heaven. His eyes were fixed at the area where it exploded.
<br><br>
Shera's eyes widened in shock. She felt the power of this energy ball. Yet, she found it hard to believe that it could reduce the entire Three Purities Stage into ruins.
<br><br>
"I understand now! This is the power of the fifth-grade world! It's from the Deep Space!" Duran made an eye-opening realization. He fixed his eyes upon the Evil God and asked excitedly, "How... How did you make it? How were you able to get that power?"
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled confidently. "I think you should ask me how I acquired the bloodline powers first."
<br><br>
"Fine, how did you get them then?" Duran inquired immediately. He couldn't keep the excitement from his voice.
<br><br>
The Evil God tilted his head and raised one hand above his shoulder. "The Ways-blending Energy is the origin of all the energies in the chaos," he replied calmly.
<br><br>
As he said that, the colorful Ways-blending Energy grew bigger in the Evil God's hand.
<br><br>
"Even the six truth powers are born from the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Thus, the Ways-blending Energy is the foundation of all materials. To sum it up, the Ways-blending Energy and the bloodline powers in the main world are the same thing. Therefore, the two things can change into one another," continued the Evil God.
<br><br>
"What? That can't be right!"
<br><br>
Duran shook his head as he retorted determinedly.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, the people of the Bold Conjecture House had long come up with the theory that the Evil God just told him.
<br><br>
However, the Bird Masters were not interested in these theoretical things back then. Therefore, Duran didn't hear about this theory. When he heard what the Evil God said, he thought he was merely talking nonsense.
<br><br>
Duran might believe it if he heard it directly from the intelligent scholars of the Bold Conjecture House.
<br><br>
The members of the Bold Conjecture House worked out lots of theories and did lots of experiments. Unfortunately, no one was able to prove those theories back then.
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled ambiguously. He put his palm down so that it faced the ground. The Godly Way energy came out through his fingers. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of kinds of Godly Way energy appeared. It was quite easy for the Evil God to do that.
<br><br>
"Watch this first then tell me later what you think," answered the Evil God mysteriously.
<br><br>
Chapter 4232 Extreme Form And Field The Godly Way energy that was rising out from his fingertips danced around in the air before slowly merging into a delicate ring.
<br><br>
"What kind of bloodline do you have, Master Duran?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
Duran understood what the Evil God wanted to do. He gently flapped his left wing, and a brilliant light flew out from the edges of his sharp feathers. The bloodline he possessed was of a mixed kind. It had the abilities of space-time and life quadrants. Theoretically, the fusion of just three bloodline abilities wasn't much impressive, but it was still quite useful. In fact, Duran was the only one in the Four Spirits Sect who had managed to master this fusion.
<br><br>
The Evil God glanced at Duran's wings and in response, ten wisps of Godly Way energy rose out from his fingertips as well. They also started to merge into the ring. The whole process was being done very skillfully, and the dexterity here was definitely worth witnessing.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The ring trembled slightly, and a strand of brilliant light began flowing around it.
<br><br>
"You possess a bloodline theurgy concerning bodily movement skill. It's very useful," the Evil God commented.
<br><br>
Duran's body froze when he saw the familiar brilliance of the light.
<br><br>
The blended bloodline he possessed was exclusive to the Four Spirits Sect, or more precisely, exclusive to him. But the Evil God had managed to master it with just a few glances! He couldn't believe his eyes.
<br><br>
"Is... this how you restore the bloodline powers?" The Grandmaster of Heaven was visibly excited at the prospect of witnessing something new.
<br><br>
"How are you able to do it so skillfully?"
<br><br>
The Evil God calmly infused more Godly Way energy into the ring, and the bloodline power inside it continued to change. He replied indifferently, "I restore the Godly Way energy to the bloodline powers. It is something I've practiced millions of times, and therefore, comes naturally to me. It's a piece of cake. The difficult task is restoring them to a higher level of power, by which I mean the power of the Deep Space that Duran mentioned..."
<br><br>
After saying that, the Evil God raised up his hand and pointed towards the side of the ship.
<br><br>
In the huge square that lay in the distance, tens of thousands of avatars of the Evil God were busy doing their jobs.
<br><br>
When the first avatar had proposed the concept of restoring, it had attracted the attention of the Evil God. As a rather sensitive person, he had immediately asked all of his avatars to drop whatever they were doing and focus solely on studying possible methods of restoration.
<br><br>
In order to speed up the task, the Evil God had also been creating more and more avatars to divide and conquer. Very soon, three of the avatars had managed to discover the secrets of the restoration and isolated a unique kind of bloodline power.
<br><br>
Although things had been difficult at the beginning, after the first step, they had started becoming simpler.
<br><br>
Soon after that, they had got their hands on the second, the third, and the fourth bloodline powers.
<br><br>
"You, can restore all the bloodline powers?" Duran asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, there are three hundred and seventy-three kinds, and I can get my hands on all of them." The Evil God was continuously infusing the Godly Way energy into the ring, and now, a new bloodline power was formed from the ring. It was releasing layers of diamond-shaped sources of light.
<br><br>
When Duran saw these diamond-shaped flashes, there was a glint of something in his eyes, something that looked a lot like fury. He was feeling greatly threatened! As long as the diamond-shaped flashes of light continued to shoot out, there was no possible way for him to escape. He coldly spoke up, "This bloodline power..."
<br><br>
"It can completely restrain your bloodline theurgy, but please don't take this the wrong way. I'm just demonstrating my capabilities." The Evil God clapped his hands. The ring dissipated, and the bloodline power also disappeared in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
"Directly restoring the three thousand Godly Ways to all three hundred and seventy-three bloodline powers ..." Duran muttered. "I cannot believe there is a genius who thought of that! I would have considered it impossible were I not seeing it with my own eyes."
<br><br>
It should be noted that the warriors of the Four Spirits Sect had to kneel down in front of the ancestry-level bloodline to beg so that it would bestow upon them, its power.
<br><br>
Those who had been able to obtain even a single one of the various energies had already progressed and were now outstanding warriors of the Four Spirits Sect. If they managed to fuse several unique bloodline powers at the same time, they would become one of the elites of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
The four kings had been racking their brains to find or obtain the full abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline. However, they hadn't succeeded and then, the Four Spirits Sect had been destroyed. They could now, only look at the ancestry-level bloodline with regret. However, this Evil God had used the three thousand Godly Ways to restore the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
But how could there be such a thing in the world? The Grandmaster of Heaven had proclaimed himself to be one of the most powerful warriors of the Nihility race, and he was also one of the most intelligent people from the human race. Now that he was standing in front of the Evil God, even he suddenly felt a sense of inferiority. He was facing someone whose intelligence was beyond even his imagination.
<br><br>
The Evil God himself paid no attention to Duran's shocked expression, and continued nonchalantly, "The power of the Deep Space is a level higher than that of the main world. It exists in various 'extreme forms'."
<br><br>
"Extreme forms?" The Grandmaster of Heaven was confused.
<br><br>
"You won't be able to understand that." The Evil God chose not to explain it and refused directly. This was something that even Duran, who hailed from a fourth-grade world couldn't understand, much less the Grandmaster of Heaven who was from a third-grade world. "In short, the energy ball I released before was a kind of destructive form. At the moment, I can only get this form through restoration. According to my estimate, there are over a hundred different extreme forms in the Deep Space. That number is about half that of the bloodline powers."
<br><br>
The higher grade a world was, the less kinds of energy there would be inside it, and the more difficult it would be to find or create them through restoration.
<br><br>
Compared to the bloodline power, the power of extreme forms in the Deep Space was extremely difficult to obtain, even for the Evil God.
<br><br>
"That's all well and good, but with only this kind of power on your side, I'm afraid you are no match for the downgrader." Duran quickly calmed down. "Through his sword, the downgrader can use various kinds of powers of the Deep Space, or as you just said, various 'extreme forms'."
<br><br>
"Give me enough time, and I will be able to do it," the Evil God replied.
<br><br>
With his extraordinary talent, he could obtain more extreme forms by learning from his previously successful experiences. After obtaining the first "extreme form" in the Deep Space, the difficulties he had met before could be easily solved. "Moreover, I've already touched the power that is a level higher than that of the Deep Space."
<br><br>
Hearing that, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran couldn't help but exchange a gaze.
<br><br>
Shera, who was standing beside them was also puzzled. She had only felt that the power of the Evil God was beyond her imagination, as he had easily suppressed the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran.
<br><br>
And right now, she was even more confused. What was the guy talking about? Did he just say that the power of the Deep Space was not the strongest? "Yes there is a higher level of power, and no, it is not also 'extreme form',"
<br><br>
the Evil God continued to explain. "It's called the Field. All powers exist in the form of Field."
<br><br>
Both Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven had nothing to say now. What the Evil God was talking about was beyond their comprehension and they didn't know what they should ask.
<br><br>
In the primitive land, the Snake Goddess, and the others were still under the bloody sky. They didn't know what was happening on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The fact that Zen hadn't returned yet made them uneasy but there was nothing they could do.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess tried calling for the ancestry-level bloodline. In theory, the bloodline should know the situation of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, the ancestry-level bloodline didn't respond to her and the others at all. It was as if the bloodline was gone. Thus, Fuxi sat down cross legged and decided to take a risk and enter the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The moment he entered the Other Shore, his body fell down rapidly. He should have landed in the Night View Island.
<br><br>
After he finally managed to stabilize himself, he looked around and was stunned. His face looked like he had been struck by lightning.
<br><br>
"The... the Night View Island... The Jade Pure Realm... They're all gone..."
<br><br>
There was only some debris around Fuxi, and the big and small Pure Sky Platforms had completely disappeared.
<br><br>
When he withdrew from the Other Shore, his face had darkened severely.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others asked him what was happening, Fuxi shook his head and told them, "You can go there and see for yourselves. I don't know what or how to say."
<br><br>
Thus, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others hurried towards the Other Shore. What they saw was a complete void with only debris lying around.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi was as flustered as Fuxi was when he saw this.
<br><br>
"The whole Jade Pure Realm is just gone?!"
<br><br>
On the contrary, the Snake Goddess calmed down quickly.
<br><br>
"Zen should be fine."
<br><br>
If something had happened to him, the primitive land would not have been so calm.
<br><br>
Chapter 4233 The Opportunity To Reverse The Situation At the Snake Goddess's words, Eastern Emperor Taiyi smiled and said, "You forgot that his real body is in the primitive land. We'll know for sure once we go take a look."
<br><br>
"Of course! Let's go back!" As she spoke, the Snake Goddess began to chant the Illusion Breaking Rune to retreat from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The sudden disappearance of the Jade Pure Realm had shocked her beyond measure, and she had momentarily forgotten that Zen's physical body was in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Once they returned to the primitive land, they utilized the Grand Teleportation to return to the jadeite platform on the Pear Hill. Zen was still there sitting upright, his face ruddy but calm, and his breathing even.
<br><br>
The life energy within his body was flowing in all directions. This would make ordinary people feel refreshed if they got close to him and could extend their life span.
<br><br>
It was truly a relief to see that Zen was safe and sound.
<br><br>
The moment Zen had risen to prominence within the Source World, they had come to know his importance. They knew he was their only hope, that no other would do. If he perished, everything would become meaningless.
<br><br>
"The Jade Pure Realm is gone. Where could Zen be hiding?"
<br><br>
"With his theurgies, he should have entered some sort of space..."
<br><br>
"Even so, he should have returned already. Why wouldn't he have woken up yet?"
<br><br>
Both spoken words and silent thoughts were revolving around Zen's possible situation.
<br><br>
On the jadeite platform, Judson, Gerald and Kendrick, also joined the discussion.
<br><br>
Since they knew nothing of what happened to the Jade Pure Realm, their discussion went nowhere, so they anxiously waited for Zen to awaken.
<br><br>
Fortunately, they didn't have to wait for too long. Several hours later, Zen's eyes slowly blinked open.
<br><br>
"Finally! You're awake."
<br><br>
"Zen, are you alright?"
<br><br>
"What on earth happened on the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
They crowded around him, throwing a barrage of questions at him without pause.
<br><br>
For a moment, Zen wasn't sure how to answer or if he should, but then he asked, "Where is Madam Yasamin?"
<br><br>
Dorothy cared the most about Yasamin. She had entered the door to save her grandmother, but Zen had already rescued Yasamin from the Other Shore before Dorothy.
<br><br>
"Madam Yasamin is in the Sword Reading Peak. Why? What's wrong?"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess asked, confused.
<br><br>
Many things should have occurred on the Other Shore, but she wasn't sure why any of those things would have a thing to do with Yasamin. Why did Zen ask for her the moment he woke up? "Someone wishes to see her. Please ask her to come," said Zen.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was surprised, and she had to take a moment to think over what he had said. "Dorothy is still alive?" Her voice betrayed her shock at the news.
<br><br>
She was already aware of Dorothy's disappearance. If there was anyone on the Other Shore who wanted to see Yasamin, it could only be Dorothy.
<br><br>
But why would Dorothy be in the Jade Pure Realm? Did the destruction of the Jade Pure Realm have anything to do with her? "I will explain it later," said Zen softly.
<br><br>
With that answer, the Snake Goddess didn't bother to press the issue. She shifted into a bright beam of light, and transported to the Sword Reading Peak to send for Yasamin.
<br><br>
Zen glanced around before asking, "Where are the Descending Rings?"
<br><br>
The Descending Rings were used to connect the Other Shore and the chaos. Some rings were in the hands of the real Snake Goddess and the human heroes on the Other Shore, but when they had needed the rings to work, they failed. After their failure, they had been devoured by the massive energy balls.
<br><br>
Fuxi quickly took out the Descending Rings and put them in front of Zen.
<br><br>
What had once been pure golden rings were now deformed and tarnished, their surface pitted and cracked. With the destruction of the Descending Rings on the Other Shore, the real ones in the primitive land had also been severely affected.
<br><br>
Zen took the three rings, and brought them closer to him. Then he raised his head and said, "Assist me in repairing them."
<br><br>
Energy fluctuations burst from the blood red sky, and a brilliant golden light was born from it that illuminated the three Descending Rings.
<br><br>
When the light touched them, a soft humming sound echoed around them.
<br><br>
The bright golden light began to become more solid, condensing into a single column as it healed the Descending Rings. In a short moment, that felt like forever, they were as good as new. As if they had never been damaged before.
<br><br>
When the healing light had faded, another two streaks of light shot through the sky at them from the foot of the mountain. It was Yasamin and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Zen! I was told someone wanted to see me. Is it Dorothy?" Yasamin asked seriously, a hint of hope in her tone. Fear was etched within the wrinkles of her face. She was afraid of the possible answer.
<br><br>
"Yes, it's her," replied Zen.
<br><br>
Yasamin visibly deflated with relief.
<br><br>
She was old, and had lived long enough in her opinion.
<br><br>
She didn't care much for the fights occurring on the Other Shore or the fate of the chaos. Not every Eternal Realm warrior was as selfless as the Snake Goddess and Fuxi, who fought for the world and those living in it until they couldn't anymore.
<br><br>
There was only one person that Yasamin cared for and that was Dorothy.
<br><br>
Ever since Dorothy had disappeared through the door, Yasamin had no news of her and had fallen into a period of depression living alone within the Sword Reading Peak, This unexpected news gave her hope.
<br><br>
"Where is she? Where is my granddaughter?" asked Yasamin in a rush.
<br><br>
Holding the Descending Rings carefully in his hands, Zen closed his eyes and started to activate the Truth of Godly Way. "You will see her soon."
<br><br>
The air picked up around them, whistling softly.
<br><br>
The next moment, Zen appeared in the passageway within the door.
<br><br>
Without a word or hesitation, Zen handed the rings to Dorothy, Kincaid and Hilario respectively and the three of them began to descend.
<br><br>
The air grew warm, and a soft buzzing sound reached their ears.
<br><br>
Three figures were outlined below the Descending Rings, one for each ring.
<br><br>
As Dorothy attempted to regain her senses after leaving the Other Shore, she could hear someone calling her name. Her expression crumpled and tears welled in her eyes, "Grandma!"
<br><br>
Dorothy threw herself into her grandmother's arms. Although she was the reincarnation of the daughter of Kincaid, and there was a small connection between them, Yasamin was the one she loved dearly.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the Chaos Ancient Gods all focused their eyes beyond the reunion to Kincaid and Hilario.
<br><br>
It was a white-haired monster and a Treacherous Being standing there.
<br><br>
The faint aura they were releasing was making the others feel stressed and anxious.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi had seen the human spirits who were in the form of Treacherous Beings before. For example, the warriors of the three houses of the Human Spirit Sect on the Night View Island. However, even Hamilton and Alphonse were far from being able to compare with this one in front of them.
<br><br>
"Zen, why don't you introduce them to us?" the Snake Goddess said, not looking away from the two strangers.
<br><br>
Before Zen could reply, Dorothy gestured to Kincaid. "Grandma, this is my father!"
<br><br>
"Your father?" Yasamin asked in clear disbelief.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "This is the Human Spirit King, Master Kincaid, Dorothy's father, and this is Hilario, the leader of the Bold Conjecture House."
<br><br>
The Human Spirit King was a very famous figure as well as the goal of Zen's trip to the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
Kincaid nodded at Yasamin and said, "Thank you for taking care of Dorothy in the chaos."
<br><br>
The Human Spirit King Kincaid...
<br><br>
Dorothy's father...
<br><br>
Yasamin was dumbfounded. Although she knew that Dorothy's origin was extraordinary, she was beyond amazed that her father could be the Human Spirit King.
<br><br>
The expressions of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others were similar: utter surprise. After a short period of silence, they raised their hands in a salute.
<br><br>
"I'm Snake Goddess. It's a pleasure to meet you, Master Kincaid..."
<br><br>
"I'm Fuxi. Greetings..."
<br><br>
"My name is..."
<br><br>
Kincaid waved his hand and said, "You don't need to be so courteous. You all have helped me. It is thanks to you that I am still alive and could wake up!"
<br><br>
"We're blessed by the Deep Space. I didn't expect that our human spirits would be saved by the human race in the end..." Hilario said softly.
<br><br>
Zen then went on to tell them what happened in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
Only then did the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others know the truth.
<br><br>
"Then the real versions of ourselves... are all dead?" Fuxi said, his eyes wide. He had never expected their situation to turn so tragic.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess on the other hand was as calm as ever. Her sharp mind was going over everything that had been said before she said, "So if what you say is true, and the sword fell into the hands of the downgrader, aren't we all doomed to lose then? "That is why we came here. We are searching for an opportunity to reverse the situation," Kincaid replied.
<br><br>
"Is there such an opportunity in the primitive land? Perhaps it is the ancestry-level bloodline?" the Snake Goddess asked, brows scrunched in confusion.
<br><br>
"It's not the ancestry-level bloodline," Zen said as he pointed in the direction of the Ruin Graveyard. "Our opportunity lies there."
<br><br>
Chapter 4234 The Proud Geoffrey The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others, were all thrown into a state of confusion.
<br><br>
The opportunity to defeat the downgrader was in the Ruin Graveyard? Although the Ruin Graveyard was created by the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's painstaking efforts, after the chaos began to downgrade, it was unable to even survive itself. Did it have what it took to defeat the downgrader once and for all? What were the odds of it coming true? Just as they remained in their spots and made efforts to sort their thoughts out, a bright light suddenly erupted before their eyes from the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The bright light ascended upwards and pierced through the sky.
<br><br>
"What was that?"
<br><br>
"Damn, what incredible energy!"
<br><br>
"Who could possibly possess such astounding theurgy in the Ruin Graveyard?"
<br><br>
Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the three Chaos Ancient Gods kept their gazes fixated at the source of the energy as their eyes glowed from the reflection of the blinding light.
<br><br>
Although the Pear Hill was adjacent to the Ruin Graveyard, there was still a significant amount of distance that separated the two huge lands from each other. Even so, the energy fluctuating from the light was so overpowering that it could be felt through distances far and wide! The power that this beam of light harnessed far surpassed that of the Chaos Ancient Gods and the Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
If the beam of light wasn't contained in time, it could pierce through the sky shrouded in crimson red and reach the ends of the primitive land.
<br><br>
However, just as this unstoppable beam of light extended towards the bloody red sky, many obstructions containing energy in the form of green beehives appeared to stop it in its tracks. Although the beam of light was considerably stronger than the beehives, the moment they collided with each other, a clear deafening sound reverberated through the sky and sent vibrations far and wide. The two seemed to have canceled each other out and later withered away till they vanished out of sight.
<br><br>
"Is this your doing? Is this the opportunity you were talking about?" the Snake Goddess asked while still gazing at the sky.
<br><br>
Zen, too, wore a puzzled expression on his face as he looked into the distance. Fortunately, he had omniscient abilities in the primitive land. As he focused for a brief moment, he learned what had happened, and a smile of relief appeared on his face as his tense expression eased up. "It wasn't us who did it, but there's no doubt in my mind that the opportunity is there. Everyone! Follow me!"
<br><br>
With a wave of his hand, Zen wrapped everyone in a layer of space created by him. The next moment, they had teleported inside the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
On a cliff in the Ruin Graveyard, Rocher stood rooted to his spot with the Lone Sword in his grip, his eyes wide open in shock.
<br><br>
Ever since Geoffrey pulled out the black stone on the holy pillar that was connected to the sword at the other end, the Lone Sword had lost its old essence as it stopped being responsive and turned into a lifeless scrap of metal. However, Rocher didn't seem to worry about it too much. Geoffrey had told him that he would continue to seek out a stronger power that could strengthen the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
But today, Rocher felt something strange happen to the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
Unusual, intricate patterns painted in a silver yellow color suddenly began to appear on the surface of the sword. These patterns began to carve themselves into the sword from the bottom and slowly made their way to the top, almost covering the entire sword, giving it a new appearance. Just as he was consumed with confusion concerning the strange behavior of the sword, he felt a vivid surge of energy gushing out from the sword.
<br><br>
This power was on a whole other level from what it previously withheld.
<br><br>
Before, the overall power of the sword was dangerously violent, which made it hard for Rocher to contain it with his current strength. It was not compatible with his temperament.
<br><br>
However, right now, the energy flowing within the Lone Sword was as endless as a vast ocean. Slowly, it filled his chest like flowing water.
<br><br>
Swish! He couldn't help but give the sword a wave in a panicked state. The sheer intensity of the strike left him speechless and shocked.
<br><br>
This boundless raw power...
<br><br>
was something he never expected to wield in his hands.
<br><br>
Geoffrey really pulled it off! As a million thoughts raced through his mind to process his current situation, Zen and his group suddenly appeared before his eyes.
<br><br>
"Zen! Zen, listen to me! Geoffrey really did it! This sword... this Lone Sword has surpassed its previous capabilities and has gotten so powerful!"
<br><br>
Rocher was so excited that his voice cracked in between his words as he desperately tried to tell Zen in one breath.
<br><br>
Zen returned his smile and gave an acknowledging nod. "I know. You have succeeded!"
<br><br>
If the downgrader had never existed, Zen would have been as ecstatic as Rocher felt with his newly acquired power. After all, Rocher would become Zen's strongest aid, standing by his side to support him in the face of any crisis.
<br><br>
However, their current enemy was the downgrader, an existence impossible to defeat by simply relying on the power of the main world.
<br><br>
"Why does such a formidable force exist? It's impossible to make it even with the aid of an Other Shore Token from the Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. How did Geoffrey manage to make it?" Kendrick asked in confusion.
<br><br>
In response to his question, Kincaid replied in a rather calm tone, "This sword is linked to the Sunlight Annihilation Light. It was once my most powerful Holy Item."
<br><br>
"So it's a Holy Item..." Rocher muttered in a tone only audible to himself as he stared deeply at the sword in his hands. He quickly switched his gaze from the sword to Kincaid and asked, "Wait... you said that this was once your Holy Item. That must mean that you are..."
<br><br>
"Yes. He is the Human Spirit King, Kincaid," Zen interrupted Rocher as he introduced him to Kincaid. "Geoffrey must have climbed onto the holy pillar of the Human Spirit Sect."
<br><br>
With the sudden revelation that now lay bare to him, Rocher remained stunned in place with his mouth wide open. Suddenly, he nodded to himself and took two steps in the direction of Kincaid before holding his sword horizontally towards him. "If that's the case, then I shall return the sword back to its original owner."
<br><br>
Rocher had a dignified personality, he wasn't one to hog someone else's treasure and keep it to himself, so he naturally felt like he had to return it.
<br><br>
However, Kincaid put one hand forward, signaling him to stop as he gave him a faint smile and shook his head. "It's true that it once belonged to me. However, now, the time has changed, and it has brought about a great change to the world. I no longer own this Holy Item. It's rightfully yours now."
<br><br>
The moment Rocher opened his mouth to say something in response, he was interrupted when he felt a slight movement from the Lone Sword. It was Geoffrey tugging on the link connected to the Holy Item from the other end. "Geoffrey seems to have something to say!"
<br><br>
"What is it? What's he saying?" Zen asked hurriedly, sounding desperate to know.
<br><br>
The Lone Sword was no longer the center of attention. Everyone's concentration shifted towards communicating with Geoffrey through the sword.
<br><br>
Everyone remained quiet as Rocher closed his eyes and grasped the Lone Sword tightly in his grip to perceive what Geoffrey was trying to say.
<br><br>
After a while, he wore a dumbfounded expression on his face as he addressed everyone present there, "He said, Uncle Rocher, the sword has become really powerful, hasn't it? Are you satisfied with the improvement?"
<br><br>
The kid was showing off his capabilities with the utmost confidence on the top of the holy pillar.
<br><br>
"It's amazing! It's so formidable that it's easily the strongest Other Shore Token I have ever seen!" Rocher replied to Geoffrey's question wholeheartedly.
<br><br>
To insert the black stone into the top of the pillar, Geoffrey had put in a lot of effort. At this moment, he was extremely proud of himself after having heard the positive results. When he found out that his father and some others were also beside Rocher listening in from the other end, he fiddled with the link and continued to boast, "If you are not satisfied with it, I can connect it with another one for you. I still have several options here!"
<br><br>
"There's no need for that. Your father wants to speak to you," Rocher said as he handed the Lone Sword to Zen and stood aside. He could see that Zen and the others were desperate to communicate with Geoffrey.
<br><br>
This kind of exchange was strenuous on people on the both ends, so Zen didn't want to waste any time and cut straight to the chase. "Geoffrey, it's true that I'm proud of what you've done. Controlling this sword is enough to make your Uncle Rocher the number one warrior in the chaos, but the enemy we are facing is far stronger. We need your help to defeat it."
<br><br>
"Stronger, you say? How strong could it even be?" Geoffrey replied nonchalantly, seemingly unfazed by Zen's words.
<br><br>
"Have you ever witnessed the Deep Space?" Zen asked, maintaining his calm demeanor.
<br><br>
"You mean the remains floating in the sky? Yeah, I've seen it before. I can see it from a certain position of the holy pillar," Geoffrey replied.
<br><br>
He could see it when he climbed to the top of the holy pillars of the Snake Spirit Sect and the Human Spirit Sect. It was easily visible from there.
<br><br>
Zen continued to explain to Geoffrey the dire situation they were in, "The enemy we are about to face is from that place, so we need you to find a person in the Deep Space, whose surname is Xue."
<br><br>
There was another key point to consider in the plan that Kincaid had proposed - Geoffrey could walk freely within the main world, but could he walk freely in the Deep Space? Whether it was Elder Xue, Kincaid, or Sheehan, if they entered the Deep Space, they would find themselves in the exact same situation as Zen when he had entered the main world, as they were rendered sightless and couldn't see anything and it would be very difficult for them to even walk.
<br><br>
This was all because they did not belong to the fifth-grade world.
<br><br>
Fortunately for Geoffrey, the Deep Space was in a broken state. A large part of the space had already been downgraded and reduced to the main world, and that was why the Four Spirits Sect had the chance to explore the Deep Space.
<br><br>
The difficulty of the task was the last thing on Geoffrey's mind. Instead, he was eager to prove his usefulness to his father. "The Deep Space is on a significant height. Is there a way I can get there?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4235 Circles The Deep Space and the main world were completely different in so many aspects. With Geoffrey's current strength, it would be impossible for him to cross between them.
<br><br>
"Well…" Zen looked at the Human Spirit King.
<br><br>
He didn't even know much about the main world, let alone the Deep Space.
<br><br>
Noticing this, the Human Spirit King immediately said, "There is a transmission array at the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Through this, one can go to the Deep Space."
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect treated the Deep Space with great importance. They believed that this place was like a vast land that was filled with precious treasures.
<br><br>
Therefore, they had spent a lot of time, effort, and resources building a transmission array in the Eternal Divine Courtyard that would connect them to the Deep Space. This way, they were able to monopolize the resources that could be found there.
<br><br>
"The Eternal Divine Courtyard? You mean the courtyard that is chained down?" Geoffrey asked out of curiosity.
<br><br>
"Indeed," Kincaid replied.
<br><br>
"But wouldn't it be too difficult to activate such a transmission array?"
<br><br>
Zen was a bit worried. After all, it was a transmission array that linked two great worlds.
<br><br>
"In theory, yes. But you don't have to worry. The energy needed to activate the transmission array is provided by the Time Lock. As long as Geoffrey can successfully climb and enter the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, there is no doubt that he can activate the transmission array,"
<br><br>
Kincaid remarked confidently.
<br><br>
In the main world, there were so many legacies left behind by the Four Spirits Sect that could last forever, unless the entire main world was fully downgraded.
<br><br>
Right now, Kincaid was being very patient. He knew that he could not solve this crisis by himself, so he needed to trust and depend on Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Although Geoffrey was a human with relatively weak strength, currently, he was the only hope that the whole world could cling to.
<br><br>
Then, Kincaid went on to tell Geoffrey in detail everything that he needed to know about the Deep Space, and what might be waiting for him in that place.
<br><br>
Upon hearing Kincaid elaborating the details about the Deep Space, Zen and the others couldn't help but feel amused.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the people from the third-grade world, the main world would appear that it was composed of countless snow-white dots of light.
<br><br>
On the other hand, if the people from the main world viewed the Deep Space, they would be able to see a lot of circles floating around. It was inevitable for people from a lower-grade world to see a higher-grade world from a different perspective.
<br><br>
It took Kincaid about four hours to finish explaining to Geoffrey everything that he needed to know. In the end, Geoffrey just nodded repeatedly before he left.
<br><br>
"I hope that Geoffrey can make it this time," the Snake Goddess said anxiously.
<br><br>
"Trust him. He will definitely make it!" Kincaid had a huge smile as he confidently said this. He always ignored the possibility of failure when facing such a great crisis. This was the only way that he could maximize his full potential into solving anything.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen stayed silent. He felt a little guilty that Geoffrey was the one who had to take this huge risk and pressure. But at the same time, he was also deeply rooting for him. Right now, the entire chaos didn't have anything but him to count on. There was no other choice.
<br><br>
Noticing that everyone had been a little depressed about the situation, Kincaid turned to Rocher with a smile and said, "The power of the Sunlight Annihilation Light is exceptional. Let me teach you how to activate its full potential.
<br><br>
"Yes, Master Kincaid. Please enlighten me," Rocher immediately responded as he cupped his hands.
<br><br>
Then, Kincaid took the Lone Sword from Rocher. He gently clenched it, and the patterns on the surface of the sword gradually fluctuated and became brighter, eventually turning into endless energy flowers that bloomed successively.
<br><br>
"It's not actually difficult to control the Sunlight Annihilation Light. When using its energy, you just have to separately release it, and then merge it into one."
<br><br>
After explaining this, Kincaid lightly tapped the hilt of the sword.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Bright light beams the size of fingers suddenly shot out and flickered into a shape of a gourd before converging together.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The accumulated sword radiance seemed to become viscous, thus reducing its speed by more than half. But soon after, it transformed into a strange form, splitting into hundreds of beams that shot out through the sky. These beams contained a special law that kept soaring, dazzling everyone who saw them.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, as Kincaid was still teaching Rocher, Geoffrey had already arrived at the edge of the pillar and started crawling along the chain.
<br><br>
He had trod on the chain of the Time Lock several times before, so he had easily adapted to its terrain.
<br><br>
About two days later, he finally crossed the chain and was able to climb up to the Eternal Divine Courtyard right in the middle of the four pillars.
<br><br>
"Hmm, the Human Spirit King said there is a magic array on the roof of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, but I didn't find it before."
<br><br>
Previously, Geoffrey had been thinking about how he could enter the chained courtyard. After searching for a way in and eventually failing, he gave up exploring it. This time, he went straight to the roof.
<br><br>
The main hall of the Eternal Divine Courtyard was octagonal in shape, with a circle of protruding tiles in the middle of it. Right after passing the tiles, he saw a platform that was about thirty feet long. At the four corners of this platform, four chains of the Time Lock were fixed.
<br><br>
Geoffrey observed the platform and the chains for a while. Eventually, he discerned that the transmission array mentioned by the Human Spirit King was most likely to be located on the platform.
<br><br>
With this, Geoffrey immediately jumped towards the platform. The moment he landed and stood on the platform, the four chains began emitting dark blue lights.
<br><br>
These lights were like water droplets that flowed along the grooves of the platform. The lights coming from the four corners gradually streamed in the middle, intertwining and merging.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Geoffrey witnessed that the dots of blue light began forming a diamondshaped array on the ground.
<br><br>
"Is this the transmission array?" He was engrossed as he watched the formation of the array.
<br><br>
He was the type of person who was easily amused and was curious about everything. Needless to say, he was deeply intrigued by the Deep Space.
<br><br>
He wanted to see what a higher-grade world would look like.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, Geoffrey immediately stepped in the diamondshaped array.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Suddenly, the transmission array began to glow even more brightly.
<br><br>
Then, Geoffrey saw that a beam of light was rising from the array. This beam of light instantly drilled through his arm, leaving a hole the size of a thumb. He noticed that his flesh and bones where the hole appeared had completely vanished.
<br><br>
"Hey, what's happening?" Geoffrey was startled. He wasn't informed about this.
<br><br>
But he also realized that he didn't feel any pain even after being drilled by the mysterious beam of light.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A few more rays of light rose and drilled through his body. Two of them pierced through the soles of his feet, and another one bored through his head.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute. Is the transmission array going to split me into countless pieces before I get transported?" Geoffrey felt a little scared. This process was a little weird for him. There were holes in his body but he didn't feel any pain.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Eventually, more and more beams of lights rose and created countless holes in his body.
<br><br>
As the number of holes increased, fewer body parts remained intact. After the lights shot through the remaining parts, Geoffrey's entire body disappeared from the array.
<br><br>
Then, the same beams of light shot upwards. Geoffrey felt that his body and his consciousness were carried within these lights.
<br><br>
After a while, the beams of light finally arrived at their destination. Then, they turned into flesh and blood that eventually formed Geoffrey's original body.
<br><br>
When the beams of light had finished restoring Geoffrey's body, he opened his eyes and looked into the distance.
<br><br>
Then, he remembered Kincaid's warning. He said that if Geoffrey wouldn't be able to understand the Deep Space, he had to walk to the right all the time.
<br><br>
Currently, more than half of the Deep Space had already been downgraded, and there were many areas of the main world in it. The nearest area was at the end of the right path.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey started looking around, the corners of his mouth curled up, and a proud expression appeared on his face.
<br><br>
He could clearly see the circles that formed the Deep Space. He was finally here, and he had to do everything correctly because everyone's survival depended on him.
<br><br>
Chapter 4236 Spiders Although it was the first time that Geoffrey entered the Deep Space, he had hunch that he could see this place clearly.
<br><br>
He might have acquired this confidence when he entered the Abstruse Energy World. That was why he was not that surprised when he did see the Deep Space.
<br><br>
Currently, he was in some circular secret room.
<br><br>
On the walls of this secret room, several ancient patterns were vividly engraved. However, Geoffrey wasn't able to understand any of these words or markings.
<br><br>
"He said to go right?"
<br><br>
Remembering what Kincaid had told him, Geoffrey took a few steps forward and chose to walk along the right side of the passage. Upon treading this path, he saw the other end of the passage was broken. The other end had been downgraded to a fourth-grade space.
<br><br>
As Kincaid was not sure if Geoffrey could move freely in the Deep Space, he asked him to walk in this fourth-grade space.
<br><br>
Now that Geoffrey knew about his ability, he believed he didn't need to choose this kind of broken road.
<br><br>
He quickly withdrew from the right passage he was treading earlier and started walking straight towards the road ahead.
<br><br>
This was a long and narrow pathway, and its surroundings were paved with transparent bricks. He noticed that each of these bricks was encircled by countless tiny rings that emitted bright lights, which illuminated the entire pathway.
<br><br>
If the measurement of the third-grade world was to be followed, this passage would be about three thousand feet long. After a short while, he was finally able to reach its end.
<br><br>
As he stepped out of the passage, a dazzling light welcomed him, making him feel a bit dizzy. Eventually, he was able to adapt to the light. Upon looking up, he was instantly shocked by the scene that appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
There was a huge golden circle floating in the sky, and it was the one responsible for projecting endless luminous lights in all directions.
<br><br>
"Is this the sun here in the Deep Space?" The peculiar appearance of the scene greatly shocked Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Although Geoffrey's cultivation base was not that high, his primary senses, and especially his vision and hearing had been significantly enhanced due to all his experiences over the years. It could be said that he was no longer inferior to the powerful masters in the chaos.
<br><br>
Only half of the circular sun was still intact, while the other half was already broken. The scattered golden fragments had turned into ribbonlike objects that still released heat and light.
<br><br>
"Only half of the sun has been downgraded. Is it because the power of the downgrader wasn't enough?" Geoffrey murmured to himself.
<br><br>
After averting his gaze from the sun, Geoffrey continued to look straight ahead. Then, a huge wheel-shaped building appeared in his sight. He quickly noticed that he was at the edge of the wheel.
<br><br>
Before coming to the Deep Space, Kincaid had a long talk with Geoffrey.
<br><br>
From that, Geoffrey learned that this wheel-shaped building was called the Sky Wheel City by the Four Spirits Sect, and it was supposed to be the most magnificent building in all of the Deep Space. Most of the digging work by the Four Spirits Sect in the Deep Space was carried out around the Sky Wheel City.
<br><br>
"The structure of that place is extremely complicated. We've attempted countless times, but we've never been close to the center of the Sky Wheel City. Once you get to the Deep Space, I urge you to set that place as your goal."
<br><br>
This was what Kincaid told Geoffrey before he set out.
<br><br>
"Hmm, I wonder if I could find that elder whose surname is Xue..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey pursed his lips as he stared at the odd-looking building.
<br><br>
Although he accepted this task willingly, he just realized that the information and tips given by the Human Spirit King were too little. Even if the Four Spirits Sect spent a long time in the Deep Space, it still wasn't enough for them to fully grasp the mystery of the place. As for Geoffrey, he could gain a better understanding of it once he saw and experienced the place.
<br><br>
Still unsure of what he exactly needed to do, Geoffrey continued walking towards the center of the Sky Wheel City. While walking, he remembered that he was carrying the hopes of the human race, the human spirits, and the entire chaos.
<br><br>
However, even though this was such a huge burden, he was actually very passionate about it.
<br><br>
In fact, he was so happy that he became such an important figure.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Geoffrey observed that dozens of huge paths branched out from the center of the Sky Wheel City and were connected to the outer edge of the wheel-shaped building. Seeing this, he just randomly walked through one of these paths.
<br><br>
Since he entered the Sky Wheel City, Geoffrey had been very careful and on high alert. He was afraid that something strange would suddenly appear, so he needed to be vigilant.
<br><br>
He clearly knew that even the vicious beasts in the chaos could defeat him. When he was in the Abstruse Energy World, he was also overwhelmed by the things that attacked him there. Thus, he was aware that the monsters of the Deep Space could only be stronger and more terrifying than the ones that he already encountered. If he wasn't careful enough, he might be killed on the spot.
<br><br>
However, after walking for about an hour, the surroundings still remained quiet, especially on the huge and wide passages. He couldn't hear anything besides himself. Because of this, the fear in his mind and heart gradually dissipated, and he started walking more briskly.
<br><br>
'Ziya can't even move an inch in the Abstruse Energy World. What would happen if he entered this world? I think it would be horrible if he was suddenly dragged into this world, ' Geoffrey thought to himself as he remembered what they went through before.
<br><br>
However, even if he was able to move freely, it still took him more than two months to go up and down the pillar, even without the statues blocking his way.
<br><br>
Rustle! As Geoffrey continued walking and was a bit lost in his thoughts, he suddenly heard a strange sound.
<br><br>
It seemed like the sound of sand falling on a piece of board.
<br><br>
He had already been quite relaxed for a while, but with this sound, he couldn't help but stop on his tracks and wear a suspicious look on his face.
<br><br>
As he looked around, he found nothing.
<br><br>
'Is it just my illusion?' Geoffrey shook his head and continued to walk forward, but he was now on high alert again.
<br><br>
Then, he heard the rustling sound once more.
<br><br>
This time, since he was already on guard, he heard the sound very clearly.
<br><br>
He was able to pinpoint that the sound came from the back of the passage.
<br><br>
However, the passage itself was hanging in the air, so he couldn't see what it looked like on the other side. Nervous at what might happen, he started rushing forward and didn't dare to look back.
<br><br>
Rustle! Rustle! As Geoffrey ran faster, he also noticed that the speed of the rustling sound also increased.
<br><br>
It seemed that the creature on the other side of the passage was following him all this time.
<br><br>
As he heard this, fear easily crept beneath his skin and cast a shadow on his heart. He wasn't able to think clearly so he just continued to speed up.
<br><br>
Rustle! Rustle! Rustle! As Geoffrey moved further, the rustling sound that he heard from the back of the passage became denser. He realized that at this point, more and more creatures must have joined in chasing him.
<br><br>
After running for a few miles, the rustling sound was already getting closer and closer. For the first time, Geoffrey dared to look at the two sides of the passage. His face immediately turned ghastly pale at what he saw.
<br><br>
Black sticks as thick as fingers appeared on both sides of the passage. It turned out that the rustling sound was caused by these black sticks rubbing the ground.
<br><br>
On the other end of these black sticks, there were also some pie-shaped beings with sharp teeth embedded in them.
<br><br>
"Are these... spiders?"
<br><br>
The appearance of the creatures sent a strong shiver down his spine.
<br><br>
These creatures were indeed very similar to spiders, but their legs were much thinner, and their bodies were also smaller. Their appearance was just so bizarre, making them look creepier and more alarming.
<br><br>
"Damn it! The Human Spirit King lied to me!" Geoffrey couldn't help but shout in anxiousness.
<br><br>
Kincaid spent four hours talking to him about the Deep Space, but not once did he mention the existence of these dreadful monsters.
<br><br>
However, the truth was he couldn't blame Kincaid.
<br><br>
The current situation in the Deep Space was very similar to that in the Abstruse Energy World. After an incomplete downgrading, the powerful beings that once ruled and lurked in the Deep Space had all perished. Of course, even the weakest creatures had also been eliminated.
<br><br>
However, it was like a gradual evolution that happened through the passage of time. After more than a thousand chaotic eras, some deviant things slowly developed and appeared in the Deep Space that was supposed to be a lifeless land. These spider-like beings were one of them.
<br><br>
Rustle! One of the spider-like creatures suddenly rushed towards Geoffrey, and its thin black leg swiftly stabbed towards him.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Geoffrey was agile enough to avoid the attack. But even before he could land on the ground, he suddenly felt a piercing pain in his chest. As he looked down, he saw that a thin black leg was protruding out of his chest. He was apparently stabbed from his back. Soon after, he felt that his body was being lifted up in the air.
<br><br>
Chapter 4237 Selecting There was no room for Geoffrey to resist. Even if there were, he wasn't strong enough. After swaying around in the air for a while, he was thrown on the back of a spider.
<br><br>
Although his chest had been pierced, the wound was not fatal. He somersaulted and tried to break free from the spider. He almost succeeded too, but right before he could break free, the sharp teeth on the back of the spider expanded outwards and formed a cage that imprisoned him. He could move about very slightly now, but could not break free.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey was captured, most of the spiders scattered towards the back of the path.
<br><br>
However, the one that had captured him ran forwards with its long legs.
<br><br>
Geoffrey knew that he had to break free. After stopping the bleeding from the wound on his chest, he stretched out his hands and grabbed two of the spider's teeth, trying to break them apart.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the power burst out from his hands, the teeth suddenly turned red. And instantly, as if two pieces of red-hot soldering iron had scalded his hands, he quickly let go of them. It was as if he had grabbed a solid fire.
<br><br>
"Great! I can't leave now," Geoffrey sulked, rubbing his hands helplessly.
<br><br>
In the Abstruse Energy World, he had been rather lucky and had not encountered any danger.
<br><br>
Even while facing the most troublesome bronze statues, all he had to do was lure them down and let Ziya kill them.
<br><br>
This was the first time that he was facing these unknown creatures all by himself. He looked calm on the outside, but in fact, he was extremely flustered.
<br><br>
His only comfort was the fact that the spider had only trapped him and not swallowed him whole in a single gulp. Furthermore, the spider was heading towards the center of the Sky Wheel City, and its speed was ten times faster than his own.
<br><br>
Rustle! Rustle! Rustle! To the naked eye, the Sky Wheel City did not seem so far away, but the path was actually quite long.
<br><br>
It took ten hours even for the spider to cover half the distance. After a full day and night's journey, the spider finally got close to the center of the city.
<br><br>
Geoffrey himself would have needed at least ten days to cover this path.
<br><br>
The spider had indirectly helped him shorten the voyage, but he was not happy at all.
<br><br>
While nearing the city center, the spider proceeded towards a large, arched building and entered inside.
<br><br>
Inside, Geoffrey saw many spiders, all of whom were carrying all sorts of creatures on their backs, and slowly moving forward in a queue.
<br><br>
The spider in front of Geoffrey was carrying a huge bug on its back. The bug kept on struggling, but was unable to escape from the sharp teeth. Its body would occasionally touch the sharp teeth, and get scalded in the process.
<br><br>
Further ahead was a spider carrying a little monster with very long hands, legs, and tail. The monster was sitting quietly in the cage, staring at Geoffrey with a faint smile on his face.
<br><br>
Geoffrey frowned, ignored the little monster, and then continued to look at the other trapped creatures.
<br><br>
The creatures and entities that thrived in the Deep Space were quite mysterious and incomprehensible in the eyes of creatures from third-grade and fourth-grade worlds. In fact, even their forms were indescribable.
<br><br>
However, in Geoffrey's eyes, these creatures were somewhat simple.
<br><br>
Most of the creatures that had been sent here were very primitive. The only ones that looked a bit intelligent was the little monster.
<br><br>
The spiders in the long line moved forward slowly, and Geoffrey felt uneasy. The spiders were definitely up to something. He didn't know what kind of danger he was going to encounter.
<br><br>
Once the spiders had moved a certain distance, Geoffrey saw a triangular platform in front of the line. There was an incision of about three feet at the bottom of the platform, and the spiders would perfectly fit inside it, putting the prey in the cages on their backs into the triangular platform.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey was concentrating on observing the triangular platform, he suddenly saw a flash of golden light and heard a strange scream from the platform. Then a spider retreated from the platform.
<br><br>
The prey on its back had disappeared completely, leaving nothing but a pile of ashes behind. The spider dumped the black ashes on the ground and then left calmly.
<br><br>
"Oh no! That is bad!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey's mind went blank when he saw this.
<br><br>
What on earth did these spiders want to do? Were they capturing these creatures from thousands of miles away just to burn them to ashes? That seemed unlikely.
<br><br>
One spider after another entered the triangular platform to verify Geoffrey's judgment. With every flash of golden light, the prey on the back of a spider would be burnt to ashes.
<br><br>
Very soon after that, it was the little monster's turn.
<br><br>
The little monster seemed quite calm, and there was a constant smile on his distinctive face throughout the whole process.
<br><br>
"He is still smiling even though it is certain he is going to die," Geoffrey remarked to himself, gritting his teeth.
<br><br>
However, after the little monster was sent in, there was no golden flash from the triangular platform. The spider that was carrying him retreated, and he was safe and sound.
<br><br>
When he came out, the monster looked at Geoffrey with an even brighter smile. He even stretched out his hands and made a gesture that seemed like cutting one's neck repeatedly. He was also making a howling sound.
<br><br>
The gesture might have been provocative, or it might have been a greeting, but Geoffrey was elated in any case. He had finally seen a creature come out alive.
<br><br>
This meant that there was a slim chance of survival while inside the triangular platform. Geoffrey still had a chance to live.
<br><br>
Rustle! Rustle! Rustle! Next, it was the turn of the bug in front of Geoffrey. A few seconds after the bug was sent in, the golden light flashed again, and then the spider came out with ashes on its back.
<br><br>
"Okay... My turn."
<br><br>
Geoffrey took a deep breath and got ready.
<br><br>
When he was taken into the triangular platform, a huge mirror appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
There were fifteen small cubes arranged neatly on the left side of the mirror, and only one on the right side. The sixteenth one seemed to be a corner piece of the large cube that the fifteen other ones were trying to form.
<br><br>
"This is a test?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey was stunned for a moment. Then he quickly moved the cube on the right side to the left, forming a complete cube.
<br><br>
After that, the scene in the mirror changed abruptly. This time also, several cubes were laid out on the mirror. They were a bit more than a dozen in number.
<br><br>
Geoffrey thought for a while and then rearranged them into a pattern.
<br><br>
After that, the scene in the mirror changed again.
<br><br>
This time, several cubes and round blocks were mixed together, and Geoffrey knew that he only needed to separate them to pass this round.
<br><br>
After he completed the three puzzles, the scene in the mirror disappeared, and it became blank.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was very nervous. The three questions had all been very simple, but he didn't know if he had passed the test. If the golden light flashed, he would directly turn into ashes.
<br><br>
It was not until the spider that was carrying him began to slowly move that he heaved a heavy sigh of relief. He had passed through one very big hurdle.
<br><br>
Although he was still trapped, escaping the jaws of death felt exhilarating.
<br><br>
'The spiders capture their prey and then select the intelligent ones among them. Those who don't pass the test are burnt to a crisp, and the intelligent ones are allowed to live, ' Geoffrey thought, feeling much more relieved.
<br><br>
If the spiders were selecting intelligent creatures so creatively, it meant that they themselves possessed intelligence. This meant that he could communicate with them. And no matter what they were going to do, as long as he could communicate with them, he didn't need to worry.
<br><br>
After the test, the spider carried Geoffrey out of the arched building, and descended a flight of stairs that led to a huge underground space. Now there were cages on either side of the space in which all sorts of strange creatures were trapped.
<br><br>
They had already passed the test presumably, so naturally possessed enough intelligence.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey was carried in, he attracted the attention of all of those creatures. Some of the monsters even greeted him through the fences by letting out strange screams of excitement.
<br><br>
Geoffrey didn't know what they were trying to say, so he simply ignored them. After the spider found an empty cage, it stuffed Geoffrey inside and the door was shut! Chapter 4238 Eight Diagrams Lock The space inside the cage was very limited. It was barely enough just for a person to sit with his legs crossed.
<br><br>
Inside the cage, Geoffrey tightly grabbed the fence with both hands and looked intently at his surroundings. At this point, his mind was in a mess.
<br><br>
He didn't know what was going to happen to him.
<br><br>
From what he could see, he assumed that there were probably thousands of creatures being held in the underground space. The creatures came in different forms and sizes, and they were also speaking in various undecipherable languages.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure but it seems like these creatures only possess little intelligence," Geoffrey murmured to himself as he observed the creatures around him. "What the hell is this place? Why did they catch me?"
<br><br>
Although Geoffrey was indeed smart, he was far from being as determined as his father. He could be ambitious and confident at times, but once he encountered even minor setbacks, he would easily become frustrated.
<br><br>
"Coo! Coo!"
<br><br>
Diagonally opposite to Geoffrey's position, a white bird was constantly letting out loud cries while furiously flapping his wings. He had been doing this for more than an hour now.
<br><br>
"Oh, shut up! It's so annoying!"
<br><br>
Bang! Geoffrey shouted in extreme irritation as he punched the fence of the cage.
<br><br>
As the bird sensed Geoffrey's hostility, he stopped screaming for a few seconds. Then, suddenly, his eyes flashed with an ominous green light.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey incidentally met his eyes, he instantly felt a crushing pain in his head as if he were hit by a heavy hammer. He felt like his skull was being split open that it almost made him faint.
<br><br>
"Coo! Coo! Coo!"
<br><br>
Then, the white bird started violently flapping his wings again. His cry was even louder than before.
<br><br>
Geoffrey sat down for a long time, holding his aching head. After a while, the pain gradually subsided. He sat properly and helplessly said, "These creatures are so aggressive. They may be a bit intelligent, but they still look like a bunch of idiots."
<br><br>
Just now, the questions that appeared in the mirror were very simple.
<br><br>
Maybe they took the cultural barriers of different races into consideration and only arranged a simple test. Even though they passed the test, Geoffrey realized that these creatures possessed inferior intelligence than humans.
<br><br>
Wallowing in despair, Geoffrey's eyes wandered into the cage in front of him, where the little monster he had seen before was being held.
<br><br>
In contrast to the white bird, this little monster didn't make a ruckus.
<br><br>
Instead, he climbed onto the railing and stared intently at Geoffrey with his black eyes. He wore a strange and creepy smile on his face as if he had taken an interest in Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Why the hell does he keep on staring at me?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey turned around as he complained. He covered his head with both his hands and tried to close his eyes.
<br><br>
Although he no longer needed any sleep after cultivating to his current level, he felt the need to isolate himself from his surroundings. He didn't want to see or hear them.
<br><br>
As the night passed, the noise produced by the monsters didn't cease even for a minute.
<br><br>
When the door of the underground space opened again, they immediately heard rustling sounds coming from beyond the door.
<br><br>
Geoffrey immediately stood up, pressed his head against the fence and saw that numerous spiders were coming in one after another.
<br><br>
Then, one of the spiders stopped in front of Geoffrey's cage. He noticed that at the back of the spider, it was carrying a pile of wooden blocks and three square wooden frames.
<br><br>
"What is it this time? A seven-piece puzzle?"
<br><br>
When Geoffrey was still in the Cloud Hall, he used to play the sevenpiece puzzle. Letitia had hired someone to specifically make and customize the blocks.
<br><br>
After taking a quick glance, Geoffrey reached out his hand and picked out a few blocks to combine them together. In just a second, he was able to use all the seven blocks to fill the first square wooden frame.
<br><br>
'Come on, this is so easy!' he thought.
<br><br>
Then, he used twelve more blocks to fill the bigger square wooden frame, and sixteen more blocks to fill the biggest one.
<br><br>
'Well, compared to the earlier one, this one is a little more difficult. This test might need the level of intelligence that an ordinary eight-year-old human possesses.' As Geoffrey quickly finished, his gaze fell on the white bird that was about to take the test.
<br><br>
In his mind, he had no doubt that this creature possessed great strength.
<br><br>
Just his malevolent stare was able to give Geoffrey a severe headache.
<br><br>
However, with this test, his intelligence would definitely be tried.
<br><br>
The white bird stretched his head out of the fence and began picking up blocks to put into the wooden frame. However, no matter how much he tried, he wasn't able to piece the blocks together.
<br><br>
The blocks were either one piece more or less. The white bird couldn't even finish the smallest frame. Thus there was no way that he could accomplish the bigger ones.
<br><br>
He seemed to know what might happen to him once he failed to solve the puzzle. The speed at which he picked and rearranged the blocks became faster and faster. At the same time, Geoffrey saw that the anxiety was growing in his eyes. The white bird was getting impatient and frustrated as he couldn't solve the puzzle no matter how hard he tried.
<br><br>
"Coo! Coo! Coo!" The white bird stretched out his neck and started screaming in agitation.
<br><br>
With a sneer on his face, Geoffrey said, "Ha, you deserve it. Let's see if you could dare to glare at me again."
<br><br>
This time, the captives were given about an hour to finish the test. As the time was up, the spiders carried unfinished frames away and left the underground space immediately after.
<br><br>
The underground space that was in an uproar just a few minutes ago suddenly became quiet. As the test ended, most of the monsters knew what was waiting for them.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Without any warning, a muffled sound rang out in one of the cages, followed by a flash of golden light. In the blink of an eye, the monster in that cage was burned to ashes.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Immediately after, a wave of golden lights shone one after another. The muffled shrieks of the monsters were heard throughout the place. In a few moments, several monsters were burned to death inside their cages.
<br><br>
At this moment, the white bird clearly knew what was going to happen to him. He struggled madly in the cage, desperately trying to escape from it.
<br><br>
His wings suddenly turned into a bright and rigid weapon that constantly slashed the fence. However, the fence was made from an exceptional solid material. Even with the white bird's extraordinary strength, his wings didn't even leave a dent or scratch on it.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As the golden light flashed in the white bird's cage, he was instantly charred, and only a few of his white feathers remained floating out of his cage.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the miserable death of the white bird, Geoffrey wasn't satisfied at all. Instead, he also panicked because he didn't know for sure that he was already safe.
<br><br>
Even if he had finished all those puzzles, if the spiders had somehow made a mistake in checking their records, then he was still doomed. He could imagine the unjust death that he would receive.
<br><br>
However, after a few moments, all of the golden lights began to dim. That was the only time that Geoffrey felt relieved. It meant that the purging of the creatures who failed the test was finally done.
<br><br>
"Whew, I passed." Geoffrey couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.
<br><br>
Immediately after, his gaze stumbled upon the cage of the little monster from before.
<br><br>
It seemed that he was still safe, and he was staring at him with a playful look as his tail wagged constantly.
<br><br>
Geoffrey ignored him as he didn't have time for his antics. Instead, he started counting the creatures that were left. From what he saw, he concluded that about one out of ten creatures had survived, meaning that the failure rate was about ninety percent. He adjudicated that the remaining monsters must have possessed at least an average level of intelligence.
<br><br>
He also determined that these kinds of tests would probably continue, and he just wanted them to be over.
<br><br>
However, what he couldn't figure out was the real intention behind these tests.
<br><br>
If they wanted to select creatures with high intelligence, was this kind of method necessary? For the first two tests, Geoffrey easily dealt with them. But he worried that if the tests' difficulty increased over time, there was no way to know for sure if he could pass them all.
<br><br>
However, right now, he had no choice but to take them and go on until the end.
<br><br>
About twenty-four hours later, the spiders appeared in the underground space again. This time, they were carrying six pieces of iron with different sizes and unique shapes.
<br><br>
As soon as Geoffrey saw them, his anxious expression gradually relaxed, and a faint smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.
<br><br>
"The Eight Diagrams Lock, huh?"
<br><br>
The pieces of iron were intertwined in a mortise-and-tenon structure. Even an adult would have a bit difficulty unlocking them.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Geoffrey had been fond of playing the Eight Diagrams Lock since he was a child, and thus it should be pretty easy for him to accomplish this test.
<br><br>
Just when he was about to begin, the little monster suddenly made a scene by quickly grabbing the Eight Diagrams Lock, and raising it towards Geoffrey. With a single gentle touch, he was able to unlock it instantly. As soon as it was done, the little monster stared at Geoffrey with a defiant and mocking expression.
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't help but scoff as he thought how ridiculous it was. "Is he trying to provoke me by showing off his skill for something like this?"
<br><br>
All of the creatures in the fifth-grade world had immeasurable strength, or at least, they were much stronger than Geoffrey. Every single one of them could easily take him down, but right now, they were held against their will and competing in these children's games.
<br><br>
Chapter 4239 Intelligent Creature The little monster acted swiftly and smoothly. He seemed very capable of unlocking the Eight Diagrams Locks.
<br><br>
Sure enough, he quickly found a knack to do that. After a few minutes, he successfully unlocked the Eight Diagrams Locks. Then, he eyed Geoffrey curiously, as though he wanted to size up his capabilities.
<br><br>
Because of two prior experiences, Geoffrey was now able to maintain his composure. In fact, he acted as though he was in no rush.
<br><br>
He even observed the other monsters for a while before reaching out his hands to the Eight Diagrams Lock. He grabbed each side of the Eight Diagrams Lock with both hands and gently twisted it, unlocking it with ease.
<br><br>
Then he unlocked the second lock, the third, the fourth...
<br><br>
Once he'd successfully unlocked all six Eight Diagrams Locks, Geoffrey smiled at the little monster in front of him. Then, he began to reconfigure the pieces of the locks.
<br><br>
He paired the biggest two pieces of Eight Diagrams Locks with the smallest two pieces. Then the middle-sized ones were pieced and paired with them. All in all, a strange shape was formed.
<br><br>
There were endless permutations to the combinations of the pieces of the Eight Diagrams Locks. As Geoffrey's flexible hands continued to move nimbly, these Eight Diagrams Locks seemed to come to life, changing shape constantly.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey formed a large structure with all the Eight Diagrams Locks, he put it to the side and gently flicked at it with his finger.
<br><br>
Immediately, the structure collapsed into small pieces again.
<br><br>
The little monster looked at Geoffrey's series of movements, his eyes revealing a look of surprise. It never occurred to him that this thing could be toyed with like this.
<br><br>
Geoffrey gestured towards the little monster and leaned against the side of the cage.
<br><br>
After their time was up, the other losers in the underground space began to be wiped out again.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop...
<br><br>
A series of sounds rang out, indicating that another batch of monsters had been eliminated. Geoffrey's eyes swept throughout the cages as he did a rough headcount. It seemed only a small number of monsters were left.
<br><br>
On the third day, a new round of test began. This time, they were asked to unlock an exquisite chain made of one hundred rings.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had never seen a chain of one hundred rings before.
<br><br>
Fortunately for him, he was very smart. After studying it for a while, he figured it out. In no time, he had unraveled it easily.
<br><br>
In comparison, the little monster on the other side scratched his head and ears, as if it was very difficult for him to unfasten this strange chain.
<br><br>
"You find it difficult, right?" Geoffrey called out to him with a shrug.
<br><br>
However, while the little monster was not stupid, he was also determined.
<br><br>
Although the chain of one hundred rings was complicated, he tried again and again. It took him more than an hour to find out the technique of untying the chain, but eventually he separated the rings, one by one.
<br><br>
When the little monster unfastened the last ring, he let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
Then, he turned to eye Geoffrey, intrigued. It seemed that now, he viewed Geoffrey as a worthy opponent.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop...
<br><br>
Time was over.
<br><br>
Geoffrey could hear the sound of more and more monsters being eliminated.
<br><br>
There weren't many monsters that had survived before, and now the sounds were sparser.
<br><br>
Then, three spiders emerged from the entrance to the underground space.
<br><br>
One of them opened the cage and plucked Geoffrey out, locking him to its back.
<br><br>
The little monster was also treated the same way.
<br><br>
In addition to the two of them left in the underground space, there was a ten-foot-tall black ape, which was also locked on the back of a spider.
<br><br>
"Are there only three of us left?"
<br><br>
Sitting on the back of the spider, Geoffrey realized only now that the underground space was very empty. Were all the other creatures eliminated? How terrifying! Rustle, rustle...
<br><br>
The three spiders carried them, continuing deeper into the space.
<br><br>
At the very end of the underground space, there were layers of stairs, on which three spiders were slowly climbing.
<br><br>
The black ape curled up on the spider's back in silence. The little monster looked around briefly before eventually locking his eyes on Geoffrey. He was very interested in him.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was also used to the little monster's strange behavior. He just pretended not to notice it and decidedly closed his eyes, deep in thought.
<br><br>
However, at this moment, he heard a raspy voice. "What's... your name?"
<br><br>
When Geoffrey heard the little monster's words, his eyes popped open in surprise.
<br><br>
The little monster was speaking Sanskrit! The Sanskrit words of the Four Spirits Sect, nonetheless.
<br><br>
Zen, Ziya, and the others naturally wouldn't have understood if they had heard that. Then again, Zen could decipher the words with the help of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
But for Geoffrey, he didn't need to decipher the words. He could understand the Sanskrit words the instant he heard or read them.
<br><br>
However, the Sanskrit words belonged to the Four Spirits Sect. How did the little monster in the Deep Space know it? Could it be that the creatures in the Deep Space also communicated with each other by using the Sanskrit words? Impossible! Geoffrey had a full understanding of the Sanskrit words already.
<br><br>
The Sanskrit words were the culture created by the Four Spirits Sect; it was not passed down from the Deep Space.
<br><br>
"I..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey squeezed his throat and made a series of guttural sounds.
<br><br>
The pronunciation of Sanskrit was very complicated. Zen had even invited a group of people to 'sing' in order to speak in Sanskrit.
<br><br>
Although Geoffrey knew how to read Sanskrit words, it was too difficult for him to pronounce them all by himself. Thus it took him a while before he was able to utter what he wanted to say. "Can you speak Sanskrit?"
<br><br>
The little monster nodded and replied in Sanskrit. "And you also can..."
<br><br>
'This is nonsense!' Geoffrey thought to himself. Aloud, he asked, "Who taught you?"
<br><br>
The little monster pointed at Geoffrey and gestured with his hands. "A human spirit."
<br><br>
"A human spirit? Is his surname Xue?" Geoffrey's eyes widened with surprise.
<br><br>
During those four hours of exchange between Geoffrey and Kincaid, the latter only worried about two things. First, he had no idea whether Elder Xue was really alive or not. Second, he wondered whether Geoffrey would find him.
<br><br>
Despite the little monster not seeming too fluent in Sanskrit, Geoffrey's heart sparked with hope. It was very likely that Elder Xue taught the little monster how to speak Sanskrit. If that was the case, then his luck had taken a turn for the better! The little monster tried his best to understand Geoffrey's words. After a long while, he finally nodded and said, "Yes..."
<br><br>
Elder Xue was still alive! Geoffrey was so excited that he couldn't help but ask urgently, "Where is he? Can you... take me to him?"
<br><br>
"He's outside." The little monster pointed in a direction. "We can't go out yet."
<br><br>
"We can't go out?" Geoffrey echoed in surprise.
<br><br>
"Well, we won't be able to get out...forever," the little monster said with a nod.
<br><br>
This news disappointed Geoffrey greatly.
<br><br>
All this time, he had been under the impression that if he'd passed a few more rounds of tests, he could finally obtain his freedom.
<br><br>
After he heard the little monster's words, his hopes were dashed.
<br><br>
"Why?" Geoffrey frowned deeply, his expression darkening.
<br><br>
"Only the most intelligent one here can... turn the situation around. Are you that smart?" the little monster chanted almost playfully.
<br><br>
'Only the smartest one can reverse the situation?' Geoffrey turned these words over in his head.
<br><br>
Along the way, there were intelligence tests, and it was indeed like they were trying to select the most intelligent being.
<br><br>
However, this so-called "intelligence" actually had a limit. No matter how smart one was, they wouldn't be able to resist against the one with the strongest power.
<br><br>
Geoffrey felt that he was smarter than the little monster and the black ape, but in terms of strength, he definitely paled in comparison.
<br><br>
What on earth had happened in the Sky Wheel City? Why were there tests to select the most intelligent creature? Chapter 4240 Speaking In The Human Language After Geoffrey's brief talk with the little monster, he formed a general understanding of the situation in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
The Deep Space was no longer as glorious as it had been in the past.
<br><br>
Although these newly born creatures were fifth-grade creatures, they were not as strong as the Cinnabar race and the Fostering race.
<br><br>
Moreover, most of the creatures were still in an extremely primitive state.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had taken note of this in the tests.
<br><br>
However, given enough time, any civilization could be capable of building itself slowly from ruins.
<br><br>
Over the long years, some races had gained intelligence, established strong social structures, and expanded their territories. The little monster came from a race called the Elemental race.
<br><br>
The Elemental race had not been considered a powerful race at first. In fact, they were quite weak, and had almost been annihilated twice in their history. There were countless minor races like the Elemental race that had been wiped out completely.
<br><br>
When the Elemental race was in crisis, they met a human spirit—Elder Xue, who had been mentioned by Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Although Elder Xue was an elder of the Bold Conjecture House and his strength was at the top level in the Abstruse Energy World, he was weak in the Deep Space. After all, the power levels in the Deep Space were different.
<br><br>
However, Elder Xue possessed extraordinary wisdom. This was exactly what the members of the Elemental race lacked.
<br><br>
He had won the trust of the Elemental race and joined them. He helped them escape from their original territory, led them as they slowly built up their strength, and taught them the way to enter the Sky Wheel City.
<br><br>
Countless years had passed since Elder Xue joined the Elemental race.
<br><br>
Now, after many generations of learning and growth, they had grown in power. These days, no one in the Deep Space underestimated the Elemental race.
<br><br>
From the very beginning, the little monster had been extremely interested in Geoffrey. The reason was simple. He looked exactly like Elder Xue.
<br><br>
"Since your race has grown so powerful, how did you get caught?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
"Get caught?" The little monster thought for a moment, then said, "I did it on purpose."
<br><br>
The answer surprised Geoffrey. He had been caught by accident, so he thought that the other intelligent creatures here had also suffered the same fate. But as it turned out, that was not the case for everyone.
<br><br>
The little monster pointed at the black ape not far away and said, "He and I came in out of our own free will."
<br><br>
"Why?" Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
"The Sky Wheel City is the strongest and most powerful city. Whoever occupies it will rule the Deep Space," the little monster replied.
<br><br>
In the Deep Space, there were a total of six powerful races like the Elemental race. They were constantly in conflict with each other, but none had scored a decisive victory over everyone else. This was why they had turned to the Sky Wheel City.
<br><br>
They believed that this city, the legacy left behind by the most powerful Fostering race, contained the power to rebuild the Deep Space.
<br><br>
However, ever since the extermination of the Fostering race, the relatively intact Sky Wheel City had shifted to a unique mode. It would kill any trespasser, and the only way to enter it was to be caught by the spiders.
<br><br>
The creatures that were caught into the Sky Wheel City would then have to take many tests of intelligence.
<br><br>
"These tests are endless. When will they end?" Geoffrey asked. His voice faltered slightly, for he was not fluent in Sanskrit.
<br><br>
"No one has reached the end yet," the little monster replied.
<br><br>
"Then..."
<br><br>
"Most of the creatures here will die," the little monster said.
<br><br>
His black eyes held a determined, grim look.
<br><br>
"Most of them will die? So a small part can survive? Why?" Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
It seemed the Sky Wheel City was enacting a method of selection. If the creatures couldn't pass the intelligence tests, they would die, and only those who passed would survive. Thus, since no one had passed the final test so far, then all the creatures that had entered the Sky Wheel City should have died.
<br><br>
The little monster shook his head. "You'll soon know."
<br><br>
Geoffrey nodded, falling into a pensive silence.
<br><br>
He thought that he had gotten very lucky, to have found someone so informative not long after entering the Deep Space. Not only had the little monster told Geoffrey much that he didn't know, he had even been a source of valuable information regarding Elder Xue.
<br><br>
The only drawback was that he was now in a desperate situation.
<br><br>
'I want to live! I want to get out of the Sky Wheel City alive! I want to return to the chaos!' he thought, and vowed that he would find a way out.
<br><br>
There was a rustling sound as the spiders moved along.
<br><br>
The three spiders patiently climbed up the stairs. Geoffrey had long since realized that these spiders were not living creatures, but puppets. They were simply carrying out orders.
<br><br>
After they had been climbing the endless stairs for more than two hours, a wide exit finally appeared ahead of them.
<br><br>
At the exit was a giant sunken square. A huge, thick chimney stood in the center of the square.
<br><br>
With a swish, the teeth on the back of the three spiders retracted.
<br><br>
Geoffrey, the little monster, and the black ape were all free.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was quite agile, and he somersaulted off the back of the spider, landing cleanly on the ground.
<br><br>
The little monster and the black ape followed suit.
<br><br>
The three of them looked around. Geoffrey's attention was caught by an enormous box on the ground, outlined by red lines as thick as his arm.
<br><br>
Geoffrey raised his foot, about to step forward. The black ape beside him saw what he was doing and his lips spread in a strange smile. However, the little monster jumped up, grabbing his arm. "Don't move forward!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey paused, struck by how anxious the little monster seemed.
<br><br>
Cautiously he asked, "What's wrong?"
<br><br>
"Whoever crosses the line on the ground will die," the little monster said.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was only one step away from the edge of the red box. As soon as the little monster spoke, he immediately took a few steps back. "What? It's so dangerous here!"
<br><br>
"Follow me," the little monster said.
<br><br>
They glanced behind them. The three spiders were gone. When they turned back to the box, it began to glow, and two green lines had appeared on the ground from the edge of the red box.
<br><br>
The little monster waved his hand at Geoffrey and started to walk along a green line. Geoffrey followed carefully.
<br><br>
The black ape stayed where he was for a while. Other green lines appeared on the red box, one after another. Each line obviously led to a different direction, and the black ape chose a path different from theirs.
<br><br>
Soon the huge square was filled with the green lines. Following behind the little monster, Geoffrey finally arrived at the left edge of the square.
<br><br>
Here, there was an oval building. Three members of the Elemental race stood at the entrance of the building.
<br><br>
It seemed they had been specifically waiting for the little monster. When they saw Geoffrey, their expressions grew shuttered and wary. One of them asked the little monster about Geoffrey's identity.
<br><br>
The little monster explained in a low voice. The three members of the Elemental race looked at Geoffrey with surprise and uncertainty, but they opened the door of the oval building and welcomed him in.
<br><br>
There were another seven or eight members of the Elemental race in the oval building. Everyone communicated with each other in their own language. After several moments, they fell quiet and positioned themselves on each side of the room, leaving only one of them in the center.
<br><br>
The man looked at Geoffrey keenly. With a smile, he asked, "So you are looking for me?"
<br><br>
He was not speaking in the intricate language of the Elemental race, nor in the difficult speech of Sanskrit. He was speaking in the human language.
<br><br>
Chapter 4241 Fate It had been a while since Geoffrey had left the Deleting Space. He only used the human language when he talked to Ziya.
<br><br>
That was why he was stunned when he heard the familiar language.
<br><br>
"Pardon me?" he said, still reeling from the shock.
<br><br>
The man of the Elemental race smiled. "I asked if you were looking for me."
<br><br>
"So you... you are Elder Xue?" Geoffrey asked, finally coming back to his senses.
<br><br>
The man of the Elemental race nodded in confirmation, peering at Geoffrey with continued interest.
<br><br>
He had never thought that someone from the main world would come looking for him.
<br><br>
He had initially thought that only the members of the Four Spirits Sect would have access to the Deep Space. But all of them could not return to the main world, not to mention the Deep Space.
<br><br>
Elder Xue knew that there were humans in the chaos. But as far as he knew, they had difficulty surviving the main world. Entering the Deep Space was a different ball game altogether.
<br><br>
So when he came to know of an outsider wanting to meet him, he became as excited as Geoffrey was.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, what happened to you? How did you end up like this?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey exclaimed.
<br><br>
Elder Xue sighed and said, his voice deep and pained. "I did all this for survival."
<br><br>
As a creature of the fourth-grade world, it was beyond difficult for Elder Xue to survive in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
He had been through a lot in order to keep himself alive in this mysterious and foreign place.
<br><br>
First of all, he had to get used to life in the fifth-grade world, for everything here was different from the fourth-grade world.
<br><br>
"I spent a long time here before I got the chance to possess a man of the Elemental race. It was because of this that I was able to live," Elder Xue said. But a sudden thought occurred to him. "Are you from the chaos?" he asked suspiciously.
<br><br>
Geoffrey nodded in affirmation.
<br><br>
"Have you met..." Elder Xue's words petered out.
<br><br>
The only member of the human race that Elder Xue knew from the chaos was the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.
<br><br>
'I bet he knows the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. He wouldn't have been able to get here otherwise, ' Elder Xue thought.
<br><br>
"I've seen Kincaid," Geoffrey answered the unasked question.
<br><br>
"What?" Elder Xue exclaimed, but his voice soon began to tremble. "Did Master Kincaid wake up?" he asked again, excitement dripping off of him.
<br><br>
"Yes, he has awakened," Geoffrey responded, nodding.
<br><br>
He knew Kincaid's true identity and had seen him through the Other Shore Token. He didn't think Kincaid was a great person and that Kincaid was more powerful than his father. That was why he didn't get why Elder Xue was so excited.
<br><br>
"How did he wake up?" Elder Xue pressed on.
<br><br>
"He was awakened by my father," Geoffrey answered with a shrug.
<br><br>
"Is that so? Who is your father?" Elder Xue asked.
<br><br>
"My father is Zen Luo." Geoffrey's voice dripped pride.
<br><br>
Elder Xue was not interested in humans, which was why he had never heard about Zen. He waved dismissively and said, "I've never heard of this person."
<br><br>
His reply upset Geoffrey. "Kincaid asked me to deliver a message to you.
<br><br>
My father absorbed the ancestry-level bloodline, but lost the sword.
<br><br>
Kincaid has asked you to look for an item that contains power from the Deep Space and that only my father can master," Geoffrey said.
<br><br>
Elder Xue stood up abruptly at this, his black tail shivering.
<br><br>
"Your father managed to absorb the ancestry-level bloodline?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, he did!" Geoffrey confirmed proudly.
<br><br>
He was glad to see Elder Xue's reaction. After all, Zen was his role model, someone he looked up to.
<br><br>
Elder Xue walked back and forth, his heart beating faster with every step he took.
<br><br>
'He made it! The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had also succeeded!' But he was soon lost in thought yet again.
<br><br>
After a long while, he asked, "Who taught you to walk normally in the main world and the Deep Space?"
<br><br>
"I don't know. Maybe these powers come naturally to me," Geoffrey replied, shrugging again.
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't answer this question, and neither could Ziya or Zen.
<br><br>
That was why Geoffrey considered it to be his talent.
<br><br>
"Did your father cultivate Grand Weapon Refining Method before your birth?" Elder Xue asked again.
<br><br>
"Yes," Geoffrey replied.
<br><br>
Elder Xue looked relieved at this. He smiled and said, "Your father is indeed amazing. But you have been able to reach this place only because of me."
<br><br>
"What nonsense are you talking?" Geoffrey snapped. . 'Such a shameless old man! Taking credit for something he hasn't even done!' he thought angrily.
<br><br>
Elder Xue wasn't angry. He used to be famous for his good temper in the Bold Conjecture House. "Yes. Your father was able to get the Grand Weapon Refining Method and managed to absorb the ancestry-level bloodline because of me. You can travel through different worlds because your father has a special physique. So, technically speaking, you were able to get here because of me. Is that clear enough?" Elder Xue explained patiently.
<br><br>
His words took Geoffrey by surprise. "My father learned the Grand Weapon Refining Method from you!" he said wonderingly.
<br><br>
"No, no. That's not what I meant. I gave it to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord through a certain method," Elder Xue said.
<br><br>
"I see!" Geoffrey nodded.
<br><br>
"You said that your father lost that sword. How did that happen?" Elder Xue asked again.
<br><br>
Kincaid had explained everything that had happened in the chaos to Geoffrey in detail. Geoffrey hadn't understood what he had said but he filled Elder Xue in on what he was told without missing any details.
<br><br>
When he heard that the humanoid creature had gotten his hands on that sword, Elder Xue's eyebrows furrowed, a troubled expression taking its place on his face.
<br><br>
He had been in the Deep Space for a long time, and had uncovered all the secrets of the Deep Space that the people of the Four Spirits Sect had failed to figure out. That was how he was aware of the terrible thing that would happen since the humanoid creature had now obtained that sword.
<br><br>
"Kincaid told me that the most important thing is to get the other item. Do you know what he was talking about, Elder Xue?" Geoffrey asked. .
<br><br>
Elder Xue walked past Geoffrey and approached the entrance of the ovalshaped building. "The thing that Master Kincaid asked you to look for is over there. I have been thinking about how to get it all these years," Elder Xue said, pointing at the huge chimney in the distance.
<br><br>
"You've been here for so long and you haven't got your hands on it?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey said, his lips pursing in disapproval.
<br><br>
Elder Xue didn't know how to respond to this question. He shook his head helplessly and said, "Anyone who gets that item would be able to rule the Deep Space. Do you think it would be easy to acquire it? Look at this place." He pointed at the several oval-shaped buildings in the distance.
<br><br>
"There are also members of other races of the Deep Space in these buildings. They arrived here with the same purpose as us and that is to obtain that thing. For countless years, the six races of the Deep Space sent countless people here. None of them made it out of there alive," he explained.
<br><br>
"Stop bluffing. It's not that difficult. Those people died there just because they were not intelligent enough. Send me in. I can make it," Geoffrey said confidently, a tinge of arrogance lacing his tone.
<br><br>
Elder Xue stared at Geoffrey.
<br><br>
'What a cocky guy! He has no idea what he is up against.' But it suddenly occurred to Elder Xue that Geoffrey was different from others.
<br><br>
'Perhaps he can do it. Is this fate? I gave his father the Grand Weapon Refining Method although we were in different worlds back then, and now he is here, right before my eyes.' "Maybe," Elder Xue said calmly. "You can give it a shot. But if you fail, you will meet your death."
<br><br>
Chapter 4242 Life And Death Geoffrey was initially brimming with confidence, but at the sound of the word "death", his face paled.
<br><br>
"What's the probability of death?" Geoffrey asked in a small voice.
<br><br>
Elder Xue tilted his head and thought for a moment. "Excluding the people who died long before, about two million people have entered the chimney, but no one has succeeded." He paused for a moment. "If you want me to give you a probability, then the probability is zero."
<br><br>
"All of them died?" Geoffrey's voice trembled.
<br><br>
"Yes. They were the elites selected by the six great races. They were the smartest," Elder Xue added.
<br><br>
Geoffrey fell silent.
<br><br>
He and Zen grew up differently. He had grown up in a relaxed, privileged environment, whereas Zen had faced many challenges. Although he had met some minor setbacks in the past, Geoffrey had never truly dealt with a life-and-death situation before.
<br><br>
When he heard the severe consequence, his heart was seized by fear.
<br><br>
Elder Xue said this to see how Geoffrey would react. He continued, "Your father has lost the sword to that humanoid creature. Do you know what we are about to go up against?"
<br><br>
"An undefeatable opponent," Geoffrey answered.
<br><br>
"It's not that we can't defeat him, but that we will all die," Elder Xue said seriously.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Geoffrey was even more flustered. After thinking for a moment, he asked, "What about my father? And my mother?"
<br><br>
"Everything will be downgraded and destroyed, your parents included,"
<br><br>
Elder Xue said gravely.
<br><br>
Geoffrey grew even more frantic. "I need to go back! I need to go back to my parents!"
<br><br>
Since he knew that there was not much time left, he wanted to escape now and be with his loved ones.
<br><br>
He left them quite a long time ago. He'd be lying if he said he didn't miss them. After all, he'd only left because he thought this'd make for an interesting journey. The things he'd encountered along the way made him realize the seriousness of the matter, which changed his carefree attitude.
<br><br>
In fact, when Kincaid talked with Geoffrey, he made everything very clear. At the time, Geoffrey learned he had a very important role to play.
<br><br>
However, Kincaid didn't want to pressure Geoffrey too much, so he only mentioned that the task at hand was important. He didn't say that eventually, all people would have to die.
<br><br>
Elder Xue, on the other hand, was very blunt. He spared no time in telling him that he would lose his life.
<br><br>
"Even if you go back, you will still die. Do you have the stomach to watch your parents die like this?" Elder Xue asked, not in a harsh tone.
<br><br>
He had lived so long that he could read people's minds. Although he had just met Geoffrey, he had already figured out his personality.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was proud, conceited, and couldn't get his mind off play. He didn't have a sense of responsibility, but he was smart and was extraordinarily talented. Elder Xue needed his talent, which was why he went straight to the point.
<br><br>
"Then, what else can I do?" Geoffrey shouted in frustration.
<br><br>
Elder Xue gently placed his claw on Geoffrey's shoulder. "Of course, there is a way." He pointed at the chimney with his other claw and said, "Your father has the ancestry-level bloodline, but he needs another thing. Only when he gets this thing can he change the situation. This is the only chance."
<br><br>
"But if I fail, I will die..." Geoffrey's voice shook, his eyes brimming with tears.
<br><br>
Like all young men, he had a dream of saving the world and becoming a great hero, but he never expected he'd have to go through such lengths to realize this dream.
<br><br>
"If you fail, you will die; if you succeed, you can live!" Elder Xue snapped.
<br><br>
For anyone else—the Treacherous Beings and Eternal Realm warriors who had lived in the chaos for countless years, they would've immediately seen the gravity of the situation, and would've been ready to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Snake Goddess, Ziya, the Bird Masters, and the human spirits all would've cooperated quickly.
<br><br>
But Geoffrey didn't.
<br><br>
"I refuse! I want to go back! Send me back to the chaos. I want to see my parents!" Geoffrey whined, burying his face in his hands.
<br><br>
"You can't go back. You can't even go out of this square. Look at the line under your feet. The second you take a step forward, you will die!" Elder Xue exclaimed, pointing a claw at Geoffrey's feet.
<br><br>
The square was a forbidden area full of killing intent, and all the creatures could only stay within a certain area to survive.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Geoffrey abruptly took a few steps back and slammed into the wall behind him. He stared at the line in horror, as if staring at the face of the God of Death.
<br><br>
"This house can only accommodate ten people. If there are eleven people in it, everyone will die. So today, one person has to enter the chimney. Are you willing to be this person?" Elder Xue locked eyes with him fiercely.
<br><br>
"No! I won't go!" Geoffrey wailed.
<br><br>
He was overwhelmed with despair.
<br><br>
"If no one goes, we will all die together. Do you want that to happen?"
<br><br>
Elder Xue pressed him further.
<br><br>
"I won't go!" Geoffrey continued to resist.
<br><br>
Elder Xue smiled ruefully. Ignoring Geoffrey's wails, he turned around and gestured towards the others.
<br><br>
All of these members of the Elemental race were trained by Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Like the little monster before, they had no intention of leaving alive since they entered this place and were willing to sacrifice their lives for their own race.
<br><br>
One of them stepped forward and stood before the green lines.
<br><br>
Elder Xue then said to Geoffrey, "There are supposed to be only ten people here." He pointed at the figure standing before the green lines.
<br><br>
"But because of you, he has to die. Although he is a non-human creature, he also has parents, brothers, and is unwilling to leave this world.
<br><br>
However, for the sake of the entire Elemental race, he is willing to sacrifice himself."
<br><br>
Geoffrey feebly watched as the member of the Elemental race walked along the two crooked green lines towards the center of the huge square, until he disappeared within the chimney.
<br><br>
A green light appeared on the side of the chimney. It climbed up, bit by bit, along the chimney. Ten feet, twenty feet, thirty feet...
<br><br>
When the green light came to one third of the chimney, it suddenly disappeared and was replaced by a red light.
<br><br>
Elder Xue closed his eyes. With a pained expression, he said regretfully, "He's dead."
<br><br>
Geoffrey stared at the chimney in a daze. After a while, he finally reacted.
<br><br>
"So soon?"
<br><br>
"Yes." Elder Xue nodded gravely.
<br><br>
The other members of the Elemental race stood up and put their fists on their chests in silence.
<br><br>
They had witnessed this scene so many times before, but they could never get used to it. Their hearts overflowed with sadness, although they stood in silence.
<br><br>
"If that thing is so difficult to get, why do you even try?" Geoffrey asked huffily.
<br><br>
"The same reason as yours. If we don't get it, and it's obtained by other races, the Elemental race will perish." Elder Xue shrugged.
<br><br>
The gaps between races could not be closed, and the law of the jungle was absolutely in control of everything here.
<br><br>
After saying that, Elder Xue turned around abruptly and entered the oval building.
<br><br>
From the moment he saw Geoffrey, Elder Xue knew that his chance had finally come.
<br><br>
He had waited here for so long, but in the end, the Elemental race was unable to produce a member talented enough for the task. However, now the Deep Space had sent Geoffrey here.
<br><br>
He deliberately put a lot of pressure on Geoffrey. Only in this way could he trigger Geoffrey's sense of responsibility.
<br><br>
Now that he had given Geoffrey enough pressure, the rest was up to Geoffrey himself.
<br><br>
Chapter 4243 Face It Head On Geoffrey leaned against the wall and stared blankly at the "chimney" in the distance.
<br><br>
The incredible and fascinating adventure was over. Perhaps now he would have to face the God of Death.
<br><br>
He wasn't prepared for that...
<br><br>
His mother had told him all sorts of legends of his father since he was a child; he had saved the Cloud Hall, the Central Region, the great world and the universe...
<br><br>
His father had always been quite fortunate. It all seemed effortless for him, as if all these feats were accomplished with ease.
<br><br>
Although Letitia had told him of times his father had been trapped in danger and how he had been on the verge of death on countless occasions, what he heard was a stark contrast to what he had experienced himself.
<br><br>
How could he overcome a dead end that no one else had managed to? His father must have been faced with similar predicaments in his time.
<br><br>
What would he have done? What was he thinking in these situations? Geoffrey sat there, still, for a few hours.
<br><br>
It was getting dark.
<br><br>
The golden ring atop the Deep Space seemed to be covered with a layer of scales, gradually turning from golden to a deep black. As night fell, the slightly bright light shone on the chimney. From afar, it appeared almost as a giant beast, ready to devour the people.
<br><br>
Inside the oval building, Elder Xue spoke in the language of the Elemental race.
<br><br>
The creatures in the Deep Space communicated with very unique sounds; unlike the rhythmic sounds of the creatures of the main world, they let out faint squeaks and crackles, like a group of crickets chirping in a low voice.
<br><br>
Elder Xue was teaching the Elemental race. They still needed to acquire more knowledge in order to successfully handle the test in the chimney.
<br><br>
These members of the Elemental race were clear about what lay ahead for them. They knew that if they wanted any chance of passing the test, they would have to absorb as much information that might be useful as they could.
<br><br>
Their race used to be quite primitive. They were once unable to pass even the initial tests, let alone occupy a place in this huge square. The golden light annihilated them when they had been captured by the spiders and brought to the underground space.
<br><br>
As the night stretched on, the black scales on the golden ring became thicker and thicker, and all other surroundings turned pitch black.
<br><br>
Elder Xue reached out and gently scratched the wall. A circular flame slowly appeared, revealing those inside and outside the room.
<br><br>
Geoffrey then stood up and walked in.
<br><br>
"Have you decided?" Elder Xue asked casually.
<br><br>
"Why would such a chimney appear here? Why do they need to select an intelligent creature?" asked Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Good question," replied Elder Xue with pride. "Although the Fostering race was destroyed, before their elimination, they concocted this. It's really quite something to behold."
<br><br>
The Cinnabar race and the Fostering race had perished together and had left this precious inheritance before their demise in order to select an intelligent creature to resurrect the civilization of the Deep Space.
<br><br>
It was a generous and kind race that cared for the well beings of others.
<br><br>
They might not have existed anymore, but they hoped the civilization of the Deep Space would be passed on and continue in some way.
<br><br>
Geoffrey exhaled heavily upon hearing Elder Xue's words and said, "I've made up my mind. I'll go! Can you teach me what I need to do?"
<br><br>
His decision did not surprise Elder Xue, as it was almost inevitable that he would make this choice.
<br><br>
"Do not worry," Elder Xue said, patting on the ground beside him as a gesture for Geoffrey to sit down. He then pointed at the chimney and said, "Something has puzzled me all these years. If the Fostering race wished to select a successor, why would they arrange such a difficult test which is so difficult that no one could pass it?"
<br><br>
"Why would they?" Geoffrey was just as puzzled.
<br><br>
"It is because rebuilding the Deep Space is not something any ordinary creature of the Deep Space can do. Most of the world has collapsed and is filled with the fourth-grade space," Elder Xue spoke with an air of wisdom beyond most. "They need to choose a being capable of controlling it. Those of the Elemental race can only use the ability of Energy Condensation Extreme Form; this is not enough for what they require. Other creatures of the Deep Space face a similar issue."
<br><br>
Geoffrey blinked his eyes as he began to realize something. "But I don't have any ability at all..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey only possessed the Godly Way power of the chaos. This was not even that useful in the third-grade world, not to mention in the fifth-grade and fourth-grade worlds.
<br><br>
"You have the ability to travel through multiple worlds," Elder Xue said with a mischievous grin. "Your ability to travel through different worlds is magnificent!"
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, do you mean the space in the chimney is a higher-level world?" Geoffrey's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
"I do not know,"
<br><br>
answered Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Geoffrey did not understand how that was possible. "Elder Xue, you've said you have been in the Deep Space for a long time. Do you really not know?"
<br><br>
"I have never entered the chimney myself and no living being has returned alive after going in. All I can do is to study the information left behind by the Fostering race. What I am sure of is that the test is very special and related to intelligence, ability and vision. But I do not know the exact content of the test," answered the Elder Xue, shaking his head in disappointment.
<br><br>
"So you do not intend to enter it on your own?" Geoffrey pressed.
<br><br>
Elder Xue acted as a teacher to the Elemental race, and it did not make sense that he did not know what was in the chimney considering he taught them about it.
<br><br>
"Of course I want to," he responded frankly. "It was by mere coincidence that I merged with this body of a member of the Elemental race. I did not have the opportunity to fuse with the second body. Once I am dead, there would be no hope left, and so I have been hesitant and waiting patiently...
<br><br>
But I had not expected to see you here," Elder Xue announced joyfully.
<br><br>
"So this time, I will go with you!"
<br><br>
"You still have a physical body on the outside. But if I die, I'm dead for good," Geoffrey pointed out. He still felt it was unfair.
<br><br>
Elder Xue smiled faintly. "How about I let another physical body commit suicide, right now?"
<br><br>
He had not been afraid of death for a long time, and now through Geoffrey, he understood the situation of the Four Spirits Sect better. It was inevitable that he risked everything.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was taken aback by his determination. He suddenly felt that he shouldn't care too much for narrow personal gains and losses.
<br><br>
"When will we make our way in?" Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
"We will wait for the right opportunity," replied Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Over the next three days, Elder Xue imparted his knowledge to Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Although Elder Xue had only deduced the information and experiences, they had been tested by the members of the Elemental race one by one, through practice.
<br><br>
These people were only able to rise five feet in the chimney when he had first led them here. Now, even the weakest of performers could climb seventy to eighty feet high. And the most outstanding of them could make it all the way up to one hundred and sixty feet.
<br><br>
This proved that what Elder Xue knew was valuable and effective.
<br><br>
Geoffrey understood the gravity of their undertaking and had listened intently to Elder Xue's introduction the last few days.
<br><br>
Three days later, some of the Deep Space races appeared on the huge square. They walked along the green lines and headed straight towards the giant chimney.
<br><br>
Chapter 4244 Setting Off Upon seeing the races of the Deep Space, Geoffrey asked, "Should we be going too?"
<br><br>
Elder Xue walked out of the oval building and looked up at the sky. "It's not the right time yet."
<br><br>
"But they've all sallied forth," said Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Elder Xue shook his head. "Today is the Power-boosting Day, so the innate skills of those races native to the Deep Space will soar. It's indeed a good day for them, but not for us."
<br><br>
In the past few days, Geoffrey had learned much about the races living inside the Deep Space. He knew that a portion of their power came from the annular sun above their heads, and the light it released today was indeed very dazzling.
<br><br>
"What about them?" Geoffrey looked at the members of the Elemental race.
<br><br>
"They'll naturally go too," said Elder Xue.
<br><br>
He then selected four members of the Elemental race. These guys had long prepared themselves thoroughly, so when Elder Xue chose them, they quickly gathered in front of the door, ready to set off.
<br><br>
After Elder Xue gave them a few words of advice, they stepped on the green lines and headed straight for the chimney.
<br><br>
"Actually, they don't have to go," said Geoffrey as he gazed at their receding backs.
<br><br>
"You're surprisingly quite kind-hearted," Elder Xue said with a smile.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. I've taught them a new method. If the method succeeds, they'll be able to go even farther inside the chimney."
<br><br>
"But they'll die..."
<br><br>
Geoffrey murmured.
<br><br>
After staying here for a few days, he found that the members of the Elemental race weren't as hateful as they looked.
<br><br>
Furthermore, they had learned the language of the fourth-grade world from Elder Xue, so they could have simple conversations with Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Now that he had a better understanding of them, Geoffrey couldn't help but feel very sad to watch them heading to their deaths.
<br><br>
Elder Xue remained unconcerned. His gaze was fixated at the chimney in the distance as he wanted to observe the movements of the other races in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
Beams of green light began to rise from the surface of the chimney.
<br><br>
Some went out after they rose about forty feet, some were extinguished after they rose about eighty feet, and some others rose all the way to a height of more than a hundred feet—an excellent record, and it would have been even more excellent if it wasn't obtained at the cost of those creatures' lives.
<br><br>
"There are many surprises this time. The Wrona race did a good job, and the Cold Ape race is unexpectedly weak.
<br><br>
Anyway, it's our turn now,"
<br><br>
Elder Xue, who had been keeping an eye on the results, said.
<br><br>
He considered each result important and always analyzed them. Through thousands of trials and errors, he had managed to roughly figure out some of the techniques to be used in the chimney.
<br><br>
When the four members of the Elemental race entered the chimney, they could see four new beams of green light slowly rising up.
<br><br>
The speed at which the four members climbed up was very slow, and they even stopped for a brief moment sometimes. In the end, however, they kept going up.
<br><br>
The first beam was extinguished when it reached one hundred feet high.
<br><br>
As Elder Xue saw this, the corner of his eyes twitched slightly, and his black claws were clenched into fists.
<br><br>
The second beam didn't die out until it reached one hundred and thirty feet high. This time, Elder Xue's expression looked a little better.
<br><br>
When the third beam climbed up to one hundred and sixty feet high, the members of the Elemental race in the oval building let out a cheer.
<br><br>
This was their previous record, and it seemed that they could climb up ever farther today.
<br><br>
Excitement was also etched on Elder Xue's face. His judgment was right.
<br><br>
One hundred and sixty feet, one hundred and seventy feet, one hundred and eighty feet...
<br><br>
The higher the green light beams rose, the louder the shouts of the members of the Elemental race became.
<br><br>
Expectations started to grow in their hearts. They hoped that the two clansmen could reach the top of the chimney and get the thing left by the Fostering race to end this nightmare-like exploration.
<br><br>
To their disappointment, however, one beam suddenly dispersed at the height of two hundred feet.
<br><br>
"The light is off."
<br><br>
"We still have one person left!"
<br><br>
"He's still rising!"
<br><br>
The members of the Elemental race placed their hopes on the last beam.
<br><br>
But it also stopped at the height of two hundred feet and then went out.
<br><br>
The Elemental race fell into silence.
<br><br>
Although this result was within their expectation and they were also used to this process, disappointment still crept into their hearts.
<br><br>
They failed again.
<br><br>
Elder Xue stood there like a sculpture, staring at the chimney in silence.
<br><br>
Every time the Elemental race failed, he always stood there for a long time to analyze the reason.
<br><br>
After a long time, he suddenly turned around and said, "Next time, Geoffrey and I will go in."
<br><br>
Upon hearing his announcement, the remaining four members of the Elemental race changed their expressions greatly.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, how can you go in?"
<br><br>
"You're more important than even the leader of our race. You mustn't go in!"
<br><br>
"Our lives are of little value. We still have many members who are willing to sacrifice themselves. You, on the other hand, have only one body. You'll die if you fail!"
<br><br>
It wasn't an exaggeration to say that the Elemental race held Elder Xue in much higher regard than they held their own leader in.
<br><br>
Elder Xue wasn't very strong. Any strong member of the Elemental race could kill him easily.
<br><br>
But the Elemental race could reach this point because of Elder Xue. It was Elder Xue who discovered their talents. It could be imagined how important he was for the Elemental race.
<br><br>
"Did the young man ask you to do that? Elder Xue, you mustn't listen to him. I'll throw him out now!" A member of the Elemental race glared at Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't understand the language of the Elemental race, so he was naturally baffled by the sudden death glares they shot at him. Why did they hate him all of a sudden? A faint smile appeared on Elder Xue's face. "No, he didn't."
<br><br>
"Then why? You only plan to go in by yourself after he came here—it must be because of him!" that certain member continued aggressively.
<br><br>
"It's because of the information he brought—an important one at that,"
<br><br>
Elder Xue explained. "If we don't get that thing as soon as possible, the Deep Space will soon be completely downgraded, and you'll all disappear during the downgrading process."
<br><br>
"What?!"
<br><br>
"No way!"
<br><br>
"I don't believe it!"
<br><br>
The members of the Elemental race shook their heads in denial.
<br><br>
Although the Deep Space had shattered, it was still stable and didn't experience any further downgrading.
<br><br>
Faced with their refusal to believe this fact, Elder Xue remained calm and patient. He was indeed used to their stubbornness. After all, he was the one who had been educating them, which really wasn't an easy thing to do. In the end, he roughly explained the reason why the Deep Space collapsed, the current situation, and what had happened in the third-grade and the fourth-grade worlds.
<br><br>
The members of the Elemental race were confused, but they roughly understood what had happened.
<br><br>
The person, who had caused the Deep Space to fall into such a situation, was currently making trouble in the third-grade world. Once he succeeded, the third-grade, fourth-grade, and fifth-grade worlds would collapse. Only by obtaining that object would they be able to save the world.
<br><br>
"So, I have no choice," said Elder Xue. "I'll go in with Geoffrey on the Rippling Water Day five days later."
<br><br>
"What about us?" a member of the Elemental race asked.
<br><br>
"You can come with us, but you'd better leave one person behind," said Elder Xue.
<br><br>
That person could later replace him and continue to fight for the slim chance.
<br><br>
The members of the Elemental race no longer objected, but they were now arguing over who should be left behind.
<br><br>
All of them were more than willing to sacrifice themselves. Now that they had reached this step, no one was willing to be left behind. After a discussion, the one who came with Geoffrey was finally chosen to stay behind.
<br><br>
Five days later, the Rippling Water Day came.
<br><br>
The surface of the annular sun in the Deep Space emitted a ripple-like golden light, and the sunlight became soft and warm.
<br><br>
The warm golden light put all the races in the Deep Space at ease.
<br><br>
Geoffrey, Elder Xue, and three members of the Elemental race finally set off towards the chimney.
<br><br>
Chapter 4245 Reading Ability The green lines on the huge square zigzagged, like a huge rune array.
<br><br>
Geoffrey cautiously followed Elder Xue on the path as wide as his shoulders.
<br><br>
If he so much as crossed this green line, he'd instantly die. Geoffrey took every step with care, vigilantly eyeing the green lines before him.
<br><br>
The chimney was located in the center of the huge square. It was roughly around ten thousand feet away, but because of the zigzagging path, it was as though they'd walked hundreds of thousands of feet.
<br><br>
The other races also sent out their representatives at the same time, so there were more than ten people walking on the huge square. Sometimes, when they got close to each other, Geoffrey could feel a hint of hostility in their eyes.
<br><br>
After all, this was a competition of sorts. It was only natural that the six great races were hostile to each other. It was just because of the special nature of the region that they were not allowed to fight each other head on.
<br><br>
Ten minutes later, Geoffrey and his group finally arrived at the foot of the chimney.
<br><br>
Although Elder Xue had been here for countless years, it was the first time for him to observe the chimney up close.
<br><br>
From afar, the chimney looked like a looming black monster, but now as he observed it closely, he saw it differently.
<br><br>
Squinting, he realized the chimney was made of pure black metal, glistening under the sun.
<br><br>
Elder Xue walked towards the outer wall of the chimney and pressed his hand against it gently.
<br><br>
He had been thinking about the mysteries of the chimney for so long.
<br><br>
Now that he was finally in front of it, he had mixed feelings.
<br><br>
Just then, he heard someone chuckling from behind him.
<br><br>
Three black apes approached from another path. The black ape in the lead said with a smile, "The Elemental race is usually so cautious, but they sent five people this time. Four members of their race already died a few days ago. So, is it only Elder Xue remaining in their camp now?"
<br><br>
"There is a human spirit among them. Is he the helper that Elder Xue found?"
<br><br>
"Last time, one of us saw this human spirit."
<br><br>
These black apes who were talking amongst themselves were from the Cold Ape race.
<br><br>
Among the six great races in the Deep Space, the Elemental race was the weakest. The only reason why they were able to rise to prominence was that Elder Xue had taken action before the intelligence of other five races was fully developed. And that was also the reason why the other races had always looked down upon the Elemental race.
<br><br>
In the past, several races had sent killers to assassinate Elder Xue, but the members of the Elemental race had risked their lives to protect him.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue doesn't stay in the camp. I'm Elder Xue," replied Elder Xue calmly.
<br><br>
The three Cold Apes were obviously stunned for a moment, and the one in the lead showed a puzzled expression. "Everyone knows that you are the greatest help to the Elemental race," he said slowly. "Why are you risking your life today? Have you found a way to crack the Levitation Tower?"
<br><br>
Elder Xue wasn't surprised at their reaction. It was a well-known fact that he was extremely important to the Elemental race, so it didn't make sense for him to go out in the field like this.
<br><br>
The Elemental race would do everything in their power to protect Elder Xue, even at the cost of their leader's life.
<br><br>
"No," answered Elder Xue honestly.
<br><br>
"Then why do you come here?" the Cold Ape asked, his confusion intensifying.
<br><br>
Once they entered the huge square, there was no turning around. Elder Xue would definitely not be able to make it back.
<br><br>
Elder Xue just smiled and ignored the Cold Ape's question.
<br><br>
Just then, another race came in from the other side of the chimney. It was the Wrona race.
<br><br>
The Cold Ape race and the Wrona race were allies. They had always been on good terms. Seeing their allies enter the chimney, the Cold Ape immediately announced, "Look, Elder Xue of the Elemental race has come personally!"
<br><br>
This was indeed no small matter.
<br><br>
The Elemental race had always been ahead of the other five races on the chimney, and that was all thanks to Elder Xue.
<br><br>
The other five races had all pressured the Elemental race, offering them gifts and benefits in the hopes that Elder Xue would help them. But in the end, he had refused all of them.
<br><br>
Thus, the other five races decided to join forces against the Elemental race. Only then were they able to force Elder Xue to share some information with them.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue?"
<br><br>
"Are you sure you will be able to pass the Levitation Tower?"
<br><br>
"Entering the tower rashly is a suicide mission! Aren't you afraid of death!?"
<br><br>
The several members of the Wrona race were stunned. They had the same idea as the Cold Ape race. Since Elder Xue dared to come in person, this must've meant he had come up with a solution! Two of the members of the Wrona race glared at Elder Xue murderously.
<br><br>
Naturally, they didn't want him to succeed.
<br><br>
However, the Fostering race had imposed powerful restrictions on the whole square, and no one was able to break these rules. Even if they wanted to, they couldn't stop the Elemental race.
<br><br>
As the members of the Wrona race stared at the Elemental race with puzzlement and worry, the other three races arrived, one after the other.
<br><br>
Every time the Rippling Water Day came, the six great races would scramble to enter the chimney. But today, they entered calmly, seemingly in no rush. Everyone wanted to see what Elder Xue was going to do.
<br><br>
Paying no attention to them, Elder Xue said to his group, "Let's go!"
<br><br>
The three members of the Elemental race took the lead in entering the gate to the chimney, followed by Elder Xue and Geoffrey.
<br><br>
The door at the foot of the chimney was only as tall as a person. When the five of them approached, it automatically began to shrink.
<br><br>
Upon entering the gate, Geoffrey took a glance at his surroundings. He found that the interior of the chimney was an extremely wide, metal hall.
<br><br>
The floor and walls of the hall were all made of black metal, similar to the chimney's exterior. On the surface of the metal were countless engraved golden rings. Some of the rings were independent of each other, while some were connected to each other. Overall, it looked like a haphazard mess.
<br><br>
"What are these rings?" Geoffrey asked, pointing at the golden rings.
<br><br>
"Ring patterns," Elder Xue answered immediately. "It's exactly what I thought. At the bottom of the chimney, there are the ring patterns left behind by the Fostering race. Anyway, we're not in a hurry to go up. Wait for me to decipher them."
<br><br>
The ring patterns were actually the written words of the Fostering race and the Cinnabar race.
<br><br>
The creatures of the chaos were very interested in Sanskrit words. Masters like the Wing King and the Primeval Lord of Heaven had spent their entire lives deciphering Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect in the main world, on the other hand, were addicted to ring patterns. Kincaid, Sheehan, and Cornelius each had great attainments in the ring patterns.
<br><br>
Elder Xue's attainments in the ring patterns were not as great as theirs in the past, but by now, he not only stayed in the Deep Space for a long time, but also had the body of the Elemental race. His attainments in the ring patterns far surpassed those of anyone else in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
After saying that, Elder Xue gently leaned against the wall and began deciphering the ring patterns.
<br><br>
"The Levitation Tower is the root of our race," he deciphered slowly. "It is..."
<br><br>
The structure of the ring patterns might have been very simple, but it was difficult to decipher them one by one. After all, they were connected to each other, and the line space was quite narrow, so it was difficult to read them. Even if Elder Xue had stayed in the Deep Space for a long time, it was still difficult even for him to decipher them.
<br><br>
"It is also an opportunity for us to start all over again. After we were defeated by the Cinnabar race, we took it as fate dictated by nirvana.
<br><br>
Everyone who enters the tower comes for this opportunity..." Geoffrey read aloud.
<br><br>
Elder Xue froze. Turning around abruptly, he stared at Geoffrey in disbelief.
<br><br>
Embarrassed, Geoffrey rubbed his hands shyly. "I... I seem to be able to read these words..."
<br><br>
Chapter 4246 Answer Honestly Geoffrey didn't find any difficulty in reading the Sanskrit words. It seemed that he had an inherent talent in deciphering them and seeing the hidden information within them.
<br><br>
When he first saw these rings, he wasn't able to clearly read the contents.
<br><br>
However, right after Elder Xue read a few words according to the ring patterns, the ring patterns suddenly became comprehensible before his eyes.
<br><br>
It was as if he had already used these words for many years, so he could easily read them like it was his native tongue.
<br><br>
"You can really read them?" Elder Xue asked as he was surprised.
<br><br>
Just to make sure, Geoffrey shifted his gaze to the other ring patterns, scanned them a few more times and then nodded. "Yes, I can understand them..."
<br><br>
"That's fascinating. How did that happen?" Elder Xue was speechless in surprise for a moment. "It's a little difficult for me to decipher these ring patterns, and sometimes the translation is not accurate. Please help me decipher them!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey had always wanted to be of help if it was within his ability.
<br><br>
Thus, with Elder Xue's strong request, he immediately agreed and began reading the ring patterns.
<br><br>
"The Levitation Tower is five hundred feet high. If one is able to climb the uppermost area of the tower, then they could become its master and would be qualified to obtain the Heavenly Ring Staff, the sacred object of the Fostering race.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Ring Staff is the foundation of the Fostering race. It can freely control all forms of energy.
<br><br>
This item is very important, and couldn't just fall into the hands of anyone.
<br><br>
Only the one who is the most powerful and worthy can attain it. If one desires to get it, then they need to pass the tests of the Levitation Tower first."
<br><br>
While Geoffrey was reading these words, Elder Xue's eyes lit up. He always knew that the Fostering race had some treasure or weapon that matched the heavy sword, but he had no idea what exactly was it.
<br><br>
However, through Geoffrey, he had learned what it was and even heard its true name—the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
Elder Xue refrained from interrupting Geoffrey as he read the ring patterns, and he listened intently to every word that was said. The three members of the Elemental race just stayed quietly at the side since they weren't in a hurry.
<br><br>
The Elemental race and the other Deep Space races found the ring patterns of no use. Since the Fostering race and the Cinnabar race had long been gone and had been destroyed for so many years, the six large Deep Space races that appeared afterward were still in a savage stage.
<br><br>
Even though they had the strength, they didn't bother creating their own civilization, and their attainment in the ring patterns was close to none.
<br><br>
At the same time, the members of the five large Deep Space races outside the Levitation Tower were even more baffled.
<br><br>
Normally, after they entered the Levitation Tower, all of the creatures' instinct was to rush to the top at their fastest speed. No one would dawdle and stay on the first floor.
<br><br>
Outside the tower, most of the creatures saw the five rays of green light coming from the Elemental race staying on the first floor. They were confused about what they were trying to do there.
<br><br>
"The Fostering race has obtained the inheritance of the World of No Limits, and we are the rightful ruler of the Stellar World. Since the very beginning, we have treated the Cinnabar race as our enemy. On the 10, 000th Rippling Water Day, our race managed to slaughter three thousand masters of the Cinnabar race; on the 90, 000th Scorching Fire Day, we broke through thirteen of their lands; and..."
<br><br>
At the beginning of the ring patterns, the Foster race briefly introduced the Levitation Tower. However, the latter parts seemed to only contain a detailed record of the past battles between the Fostering race and the Cinnabar race.
<br><br>
Geoffrey agreed to read the ring patterns in hopes that he could find some clues on the first floor in order to pass through the Levitation Tower, but those clues were nowhere to be found on them. Instead, for the most part, they were comprised of the history of the Fostering race's development.
<br><br>
Naturally, Geoffrey got bored while reading them. He suddenly stopped in the middle of a text and asked, "Elder Xue, do I still need to continue reading this part?"
<br><br>
"Yes, of course! This is important!" Elder Xue was so engrossed in the history of the Fostering race.
<br><br>
As an elder of the Bold Conjecture House, he felt like it was his obligation to explore the world. Thus, if this kind of information was right before his eyes, how could he miss such a very rare opportunity? Upon hearing Elder Xue's response, Geoffrey couldn't help rolling his eyes and continued reading.
<br><br>
From the ten thousandth to the three trillionth Rippling Water Day, the Fostering race had gone through prosperity, rise, conquest, and decline.
<br><br>
With their fierce war against the Cinnabar race, both of them perished together in the end.
<br><br>
After deciphering and reading the last ring pattern, Elder Xue patted Geoffrey on his shoulder with a look of extreme satisfaction. "Now, let's go up!"
<br><br>
The inner part of the Levitation Tower was spiral in structure. As they climbed up ten feet along the spiral staircase, a red line suddenly appeared under their feet and blocked their way. Upon seeing this, they immediately stopped and put their guards up.
<br><br>
Even without Elder Xue warning them, Geoffrey knew that once they crossed that red line, they might die on the spot.
<br><br>
Just as they steadily approached the red line, they felt that a strand of consciousness attempted to simultaneously enter their minds.
<br><br>
"Hmm, it's a test for the soul..." Elder Xue said as if he had already expected this.
<br><br>
During his long years of staying in the Deep Space, he had experienced countless failures. Thus he already had a rough deduction of what to expect within the first two hundred feet of the Levitation Tower.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, can I pass this test?" Geoffrey asked nervously.
<br><br>
Although he currently had a cultivation base of a True God, his soul was still not very strong. In fact, he was far inferior to an ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior in terms of strength.
<br><br>
It meant that even the soul of an ordinary creature in the Deep Space was stronger than Geoffrey's. The moment the creature released a little soul pressure, Geoffrey's soul would be in great danger of being extinguished.
<br><br>
"You don't have to worry. The tests in the Levitation Tower have nothing to do with one's strength. Otherwise, most of the creatures that would dare to enter the tower might pass. Don't resist the consciousness," Elder Xue tried to console him.
<br><br>
It wasn't that there weren't powerful warriors among the six large races of the Deep Space. However, the tests of the Levitation Tower were far from ordinary. For the past years, more and more powerful warriors failed to pass the tests in the tower. Therefore, the six large races decided to stop sending their powerful warriors because they had already lost so many powerful members in it.
<br><br>
After all, every powerful member was necessary for their races to thrive.
<br><br>
Once there was an imbalance in terms of the number and strength of one race, the other races would surely take advantage of this and annihilate this weaker race.
<br><br>
Geoffrey followed Elder Xue's advice and the consciousness freely entered Geoffrey's mind. The moment it touched his soul, a simple question surfaced in his mind.
<br><br>
"Who are you?"
<br><br>
As he heard the question, a strange expression quickly appeared on his face. He wasn't expecting this kind of simple question.
<br><br>
At the same time, Elder Xue and the other three members of the Elemental race showed the same strange reactions on their faces. Soon after, Elder Xue calmed himself and reminded them, "Just relax and answer the question honestly."
<br><br>
'Answer honestly? So am I to introduce myself?' Geoffrey thought with slight hesitation.
<br><br>
Right now, he just had to trust what Elder Xue said, so he answered, "My name is Geoffrey Luo... I'm from the chaos."
<br><br>
No one exactly knew what the correct answer was. At that moment, Geoffrey just simply conveyed what he thought when asked with that question.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey told his self-introduction, a gap appeared from the red line beneath his feet. From the gap, two green lines extended, forming a path to advance.
<br><br>
"Whew, that's pretty easy."
<br><br>
Geoffrey shrugged as he let out a sigh.
<br><br>
Soon after, Elder Xue and the members of the Elemental race also finished answering the question asked by the consciousness. A passageway outlined by green lines also appeared beneath their feet.
<br><br>
With this, they continued to go up along the green lines.
<br><br>
After they managed to climb up some distance, the wisp of consciousness raised a new question.
<br><br>
"What is your dream?"
<br><br>
'Dream? That is so vague.' Geoffrey slightly tilted his head and was reluctant to answer the question right away.
<br><br>
He thought that if the answer was based on the logic of the test from the Fostering race, then it should probably be something connected with saving the world or the people.
<br><br>
But Geoffrey didn't know if that was how he should answer in this test.
<br><br>
When Elder Xue saw that Geoffrey was hesitating, he reminded him again, "Just answer it honestly!"
<br><br>
Through Elder Xue's abundant experiences, he already learned that no one could deceive the Levitation Tower. With the omnipotent method of the Fostering race, it would be very easy to tell whether one was lying or not.
<br><br>
He knew that his companions might also have the same hesitations, so he repeatedly reminded them to answer the questions with all honesty.
<br><br>
Chapter 4247 Dream 'My dream?' Geoffrey blinked a couple of times, thinking hard about what his dream was.
<br><br>
Now, he knew that the whole world was in danger. All he wanted to do was save the world and reunite with his parents.
<br><br>
Pondering for a while, he wondered if those were part of his dream.
<br><br>
However, he soon concluded that they weren't.
<br><br>
Despite everything being hazy at the moment, Geoffrey knew this wasn't his ultimate dream.
<br><br>
His mother was the leader of the Cloud Hall, and his father was a legend in every world.
<br><br>
While he had lived his whole life in a safe environment, he couldn't help but feel like he was in a prison. He couldn't make decisions on his own, and he couldn't leave without permission.
<br><br>
He couldn't live a life he wanted in the Cloud Hall or the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Ever since Zen went to the Source World, Geoffrey had stayed in his inner world. But he was his father's tool. Whenever Zen needed him to decipher Sanskrit words, he would summon him.
<br><br>
Although Zen had given him the illusion of freedom in his inner world, sometimes even creating obstacles for him, Geoffrey knew that everything was still under his father's control. Ultimately, he was safe there, and never needed to stare death in the face.
<br><br>
Due to his experiences growing up, Geoffrey didn't really care about anything, since he couldn't even be the master of his own life.
<br><br>
As he reflected on his past, he found that his days of happiness only really started when he had set foot in the Abstruse Energy World from the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
There, he had encountered so many dangers.
<br><br>
His parents weren't by his side, so he finally felt the thrill of courting death.
<br><br>
Despite the danger, Geoffrey was very happy.
<br><br>
Then, it clicked. "My dream is to travel the worlds freely!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
Even when Geoffrey gave his answer, the consciousness still did not have any reaction. He, Elder Xue, and the others continued to move along the green lines, with no obstructions before them.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, this is easier than I thought," Geoffrey said with a nonchalant shrug.
<br><br>
"It's not that simple," Elder Xue responded, shaking his head. "They are just collecting information."
<br><br>
"Why would they do that?"
<br><br>
Just as Geoffrey finished speaking, he reached the end of the green lines and a red line suddenly blocked their way.
<br><br>
Then, the consciousness suddenly became active in his mind. This time, however, it didn't raise any questions but went straight into Geoffrey's soul.
<br><br>
Boom! Geoffrey felt as though a wild, ancient beast had just rammed into him. A white light flashed in his mind briefly, and when he had gathered his bearings, he found himself in a strange world.
<br><br>
There was no sign of Elder Xue or the Levitation Tower. Instead, Geoffrey saw a seemingly unending wilderness. After taking in his surroundings, he saw several old, dilapidated wooden cabins nearby.
<br><br>
As Geoffrey made his way towards the cabins, he suddenly heard the pained wails of someone crying. Whipping his head about, he tried to follow the direction of the sound. Finally, his eyes landed on a thin, short girl who was as pale as a ghost in one of the cabins.
<br><br>
"Hello,"
<br><br>
Geoffrey called out from a distance.
<br><br>
Since he didn't know where he was, he didn't dare approach the little crying girl.
<br><br>
"Hey, why are you crying?" he asked again.
<br><br>
The little girl slowly raised her tear-stained face. "It's all your fault! We're all going to die!" she wailed.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was confused. "What did I do to you?"
<br><br>
'I guess I am in an illusion created by the Levitation Tower. This must be a test, ' he quickly figured. His face relaxed when he realized this.
<br><br>
Seeing Geoffrey's relaxed expression, the little girl got angrier. "I was created because of you. Dead crows would appear over there. We can't escape from them. We will die here," she spat, resentment written all over her face.
<br><br>
Hearing the little girl's words, Geoffrey immediately realized that the little girl's words was an important hint.
<br><br>
He raised his head and looked at the end of the wilderness in the distance.
<br><br>
A black cloud was steadily approaching, and as he squinted, he realized it was actually a horde of black crows.
<br><br>
"The dead crows are coming our way. Run!" Geoffrey urged.
<br><br>
"No, I am not going anywhere. I can't escape them anyway!" The little girl shook her head stubbornly.
<br><br>
"Then, I'll leave you here!"
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Geoffrey turned around abruptly and started to sprint away. As he ran, he muttered to himself, "What the hell is this illusion?"
<br><br>
After a while, he suddenly stopped in his tracks. He could sense that the little girl was still wailing, sitting on the ground of one of the cabins.
<br><br>
Raising his eyebrows, he turned around and headed back for her.
<br><br>
'Since the little girl is in this illusion, she must play a role, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Squatting in front of the little girl, he said, "You didn't even give it a try.
<br><br>
How would you know that you can't run away from them?"
<br><br>
"This wilderness is very large. The dead crows are very fast. Of course we can't outrun them!" The little girl pouted.
<br><br>
"Are you familiar with this place?" Geoffrey asked, raising an eyebrow.
<br><br>
The little girl shook her head stubbornly. "Anyway, we are doomed. We will die here!" she said again.
<br><br>
"If we don't run, we will surely die. But if we run now, we might make it out of here. So why don't we give it a shot? If we don't do anything and give up, we will regret it!" Geoffrey coaxed her gently.
<br><br>
"Look at those dead crows. It'd only take one of them to devour the both of us. Even the nearest city is a hundred miles away. We'll be their food before we get there. So, just give up!" the little girl huffed with conviction.
<br><br>
"Since you know that this world is illusionary, you should know that it is just a test. If you run with me, we will find a way to get rid of them,"
<br><br>
Geoffrey patiently persuaded. By now, he had already figured out that the little girl was the key to passing the test.
<br><br>
"My existence is meaningless. Whether I run or not, I will disappear with the world. So it makes no difference whether I choose to run or stay here,"
<br><br>
the little girl retorted, her eyes flashing with defiance.
<br><br>
"But it'd mean a lot to me," Geoffrey said, unable to hide the annoyance in his voice. He didn't know how to talk the stubborn little girl into going with him.
<br><br>
"It's not my responsibility to help you, and I can't help." By now, she had stopped crying. If Geoffrey wasn't mistaken, there seemed to be a hint of malice in her large, twinkling eyes.
<br><br>
Quack! Quack! Quack! The dead crows were steadily closing in on them. Geoffrey could see the ferocity in their eyes.
<br><br>
'I've only climbed around two feet on the Levitation Tower. Am I really going to die here?' he thought.
<br><br>
He frowned and stood up. All of a sudden, an idea flashed in his mind.
<br><br>
'I've been focusing on persuading this little girl. What if I tried another method? There's no way I'm giving up like this!' Geoffrey thought to himself resolutely.
<br><br>
Lowering his head, he glanced at the little girl. With his eyebrows raised slightly, he suddenly grabbed the little girl by the arm and began to run.
<br><br>
The little girl was as light as a kite.
<br><br>
He kept running while grabbing the little girl tightly. "Now that you can't help me, let me help you!" he said as he sprinted.
<br><br>
The little girl didn't resist. Instead, she smiled. Gently waving at the sky, a fan-shaped flame suddenly appeared.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, all the dead crows were burnt to ashes.
<br><br>
Then, a hush fell over the vast wilderness. Even though it was just an illusion, it felt so real. The smell of burning flesh filled Geoffrey's nose.
<br><br>
"You passed the test," the little girl said calmly.
<br><br>
Geoffrey threw the little girl to the side and panted. Before he could reply, the illusion abruptly disappeared.
<br><br>
He was back in the Levitation Tower. The red line that had blocked him moments prior was now replaced with two green lines.
<br><br>
As for Elder Xue and the other three men from the Elemental race, their eyes were still shut tight. It was obvious that they were still trapped in the illusion.
<br><br>
Chapter 4248 Afraid Of Death Despite the path continuing before him, Geoffrey didn't rush up the tower.
<br><br>
Instead, he stood there and waited patiently.
<br><br>
A few minutes later, a member of the Elemental race opened his eyes and found himself safe. His eyes gleamed with excitement.
<br><br>
He then noticed that Geoffrey had already left the illusion and tried to say something, but Geoffrey didn't understand a single word.
<br><br>
Soon, the second one woke up. This left only Elder Xue and the last one stuck in the illusion.
<br><br>
"They should wake up soon," Geoffrey said, nodding with certainty.
<br><br>
After all, he had seen once before that the pace of the members of the Elemental race in the first half of the Levitation Tower was very fast. It wouldn't take long.
<br><br>
However, as soon as he finished speaking, he saw the two lines under the feet of the still unconscious member begin to recede.
<br><br>
When the other two members also took notice, they immediately cried out anxiously, but there was nothing they could do.
<br><br>
Everyone had their own path, and they could only move within the lines under their feet. No one dared cross their lines in the slightest.
<br><br>
When the lines drew back to the feet of that member, the originally green lines turned red. Then, that member's legs were burned by an invisible flame, until he was nothing but a pile of white ashes.
<br><br>
"He is dead!" Geoffrey exclaimed in horror, his eyes twitching.
<br><br>
Although he was painfully aware that those who entered the Levitation Tower were willing to sacrifice their lives, he couldn't help but feel depressed with what he just witnessed.
<br><br>
At the same time, he was also consumed with worry about Elder Xue's safety. What was taking him so long? Would he die here? Just as Geoffrey felt like his anxiety was eating him alive, Elder Xue's body trembled slightly. When he finally opened his eyes, Geoffrey heaved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
When the two members of the Elemental race saw Elder Xue wake up, they pointed at the wafting white ashes and jabbered something incomprehensible. Elder Xue understood what they meant. After comforting them, he said to Geoffrey, "He must have lied when the Levitation Tower asked him those questions, so he couldn't pass the test.
<br><br>
As I've said many times, no matter what the Levitation Tower asks, you must tell the truth. Remember this!"
<br><br>
Elder Xue focused all his efforts on Geoffrey. Just now, he used the death of this member as a learning experience for Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"I'll keep that in mind." Geoffrey nodded shakily. He knew he had no choice but to obey Elder Xue, since this was a matter of life and death.
<br><br>
Then together, the remaining four continued to walk along the green lines.
<br><br>
"Those who enter the Levitation Tower will stay at the height of twenty feet for a while and then rise steadily to the height of fifty feet. I don't think there will be any test during this process," Elder Xue said as he walked.
<br><br>
He had observed this many times, and this time he could finally verify his theory.
<br><br>
As he said, the four of them walked around the Levitation Tower two times, and they encountered no obstacles all the way up to the height of fifty feet. The consciousness in their minds had been silent, but the moment they reached the height of fifty feet, another red line appeared in front of them and blocked their way. At the same time, the consciousness in their minds raised another question.
<br><br>
"Are you afraid of death?"
<br><br>
When Geoffrey heard this question, his heart skipped a beat. He had a bad feeling about this, but he still answered firmly, "Yes!"
<br><br>
Boom! The wisp of consciousness once again hit his soul.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, he found himself in a new illusion.
<br><br>
There was a two-foot-long saber in front of him. Not far away was a large lake. By the lakeside, he saw the figure of the little girl with the pale face again.
<br><br>
"Nice to meet you again," the little girl said with a bright, cheerful smile.
<br><br>
Geoffrey ignored her momentarily and looked around vigilantly.
<br><br>
Since the question this time was about death, he figured the test must have something to do with death.
<br><br>
The biggest difficulty of the illusion was that there were too few hints. If he wanted to pass the test, he needed to probe around further.
<br><br>
After taking a few apprehensive steps forward, Geoffrey picked up the saber cautiously. Gripping it tightly in his hand, he asked the girl, "Why are you still here? Are you here to help me?"
<br><br>
"I won't help you," the little girl said, smiling as though she knew all the secrets of the world. "I just want to watch you die. Those who are afraid of death will surely die."
<br><br>
"Watch me die? Those who are afraid of death will surely die?" Geoffrey echoed confusedly.
<br><br>
Taking another look at his surroundings, he saw that there was only the lake in front of him. Was it going to drown him? With his cultivation base, it was impossible for him to drown, but this was an illusion, so anything was possible...
<br><br>
As soon as this dawned on Geoffrey, he noticed a dark shadow moving swiftly at the bottom of the lake. His eyes widened and he immediately retreated a few steps backward.
<br><br>
Swoosh! When Geoffrey retreated several hundred feet, a vine shot out from the lake's surface, rushing towards him like an arrow.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, it coiled around Geoffrey's ankle.
<br><br>
Clang! Clang! Clang! Geoffrey haphazardly chopped at the vine with the saber in his hand. To his horror, the vine was extremely solid, as though it were made of metal.
<br><br>
Sparks flew out in all directions whenever he slashed at the vine, but the vine remained unscathed. Before he could think of something, the vine dragged him into the water.
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! Just as Geoffrey had suspected, he felt suffocated upon entering the water.
<br><br>
He was drowning! Although he struggled madly, the vine was as solid as an iron whip. No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to break free from it.
<br><br>
Standing by the lake, the little girl bent over to watch. Looking at Geoffrey who was struggling under the water, she smiled almost innocently, but her eyes betrayed a sense of malice.
<br><br>
As Geoffrey felt as though his lungs were about to explode, his consciousness began to wane.
<br><br>
If he blacked out, he would really die here.
<br><br>
Thinking of how the member of the Elemental race had been burnt into a pile of ashes, he shuddered. He definitely didn't want to die that way.
<br><br>
"I... I want to live!"
<br><br>
Gritting his teeth, he was determined to survive.
<br><br>
Since the little girl wasn't going to help him, and he couldn't cut the vine, he decided to use the saber on his own self.
<br><br>
Making up his mind, he swung the saber at his legs desperately.
<br><br>
He hadn't suffered much growing up, but now, at such a critical situation, he moved swiftly and ruthlessly.
<br><br>
Crack! Blood began to paint the bottom of the water red as he severed his right leg. Breaking free from his shackles, he swam to the surface of the lake and gasped for air. Just as he was hungrily drinking up oxygen, another vine shot out from the bottom of the lake. This time, it was his left leg that was caught.
<br><br>
Crack! This time, Geoffrey became more decisive. Before he was pulled to the bottom of the lake, he sliced off his left leg.
<br><br>
Despite it being an illusion, everything felt very real. The pain from severing both his legs was unbearable.
<br><br>
"Which body parts do you want? Just tell me! I'll give you everything! As long as I can live!" Geoffrey roared at the little girl fiercely.
<br><br>
The little girl seemed to be a little disappointed. Lowering her head, she thought for a while. It seemed as though she'd lost interest in Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"This is boring. You are really afraid of death. Then, let's end this."
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, the illusion shook and disappeared with her.
<br><br>
Geoffrey found himself back in the Levitation Tower, soaked with sweat.
<br><br>
After successfully passing the test, he felt like he was an extremely lucky survivor.
<br><br>
Looking to see if his companions had passed too, he was stunned when he saw that Elder Xue and the two members of the Elemental race were trembling. What sort of torture were they going through? "My answer was 'yes', yet the test was so horrible. Elder Xue and the others have a stable state of mind, so they must've answered 'no'. The illusions they are facing are probably ten times more difficult," Geoffrey said, shaking his head worriedly.
<br><br>
Chapter 4249 Water The illusions that Elder Xue and the others faced were much more advanced than the one Geoffrey had encountered.
<br><br>
However, in terms of life-or-death struggles, both the Elemental race and Elder Xue had been more experienced than Geoffrey.
<br><br>
It was no exaggeration to state that all warriors who qualified to enter the Levitation Tower had already come to regard life and death as unimportant details, and a life-or-death test wasn't really anything that concerned them.
<br><br>
Therefore, Geoffrey didn't wait long before Elder Xue and the two members of the Elemental race had safely accomplished the illusions.
<br><br>
Upon passing the test, Elder Xue turned to confirm Geoffrey's safety immediately. He was relieved to see that the young man was unscathed.
<br><br>
"What was your answer to the question?" Elder Xue asked out of curiosity.
<br><br>
"I answered it with honesty. I admitted that I'm afraid of death," said Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Oh? Truly?" Elder Xue was taken aback by this unexpected answer, but he quickly understood the reasoning behind it.
<br><br>
Everyone who entered the Levitation Tower knew there was a great likelihood of dying. Elder Xue and the two members of the Elemental race had boldly stated that they were not afraid of death; hence, they had faced much more severe life-or-death challenges.
<br><br>
In particular, Elder Xue had been subject to hundreds of cycles of birth and death in the limited period of time. If it had been Geoffrey, he would have been overwhelmed and succumbed to the pain.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's weakness actually worked to his advantage because his tests in the Levitation Tower had a much lower level of difficulty than the other warriors'. If he continued to advance at this pace, it might not be as difficult for him to pass all the tests.
<br><br>
"Let's move on!"
<br><br>
Once the red line disappeared, the four of them continued to ascend the spiraling stairs of the Levitation Tower.
<br><br>
Sixty feet...
<br><br>
Seventy feet...
<br><br>
Eighty feet...
<br><br>
When they reached the level that was ninety feet away from the starting point, the mysterious consciousness raised another question: "Who will you choose to save in a crisis?"
<br><br>
Before Geoffrey could answer it, his consciousness was drawn into an illusion again. He saw the same little girl in the illusion. This time, she gave Geoffrey a chance to save his own life or the lives of ten thousand other people. He would have to either sacrifice his life for the ten thousand people, or sacrifice their lives for his own.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's sense of self-preservation quickly answered. He selected his own survival with almost no hesitation at all. For the young man, his life was much more valuable than those of irrelevant strangers! Moreover, Elder Xue had repeatedly emphasized the importance of being honest, and that meant he should answer the Levitation Tower's questions with absolute honesty. He was very confident in his honest answer.
<br><br>
In the illusion, those innocent people were slowly submerged in lethal lava. The little girl watched beside Geoffrey. "Cold-blooded," she commented. Then, the illusion immediately disappeared from his mind.
<br><br>
Soon, Elder Xue and the two members of the Elemental race also passed through the test without a hitch.
<br><br>
After passing through three tests in a row, Geoffrey's expression had become greatly relaxed. "Elder Xue, these are actually not soul tests. They didn't involve the strength of soul, nor the level of power," he remarked. "I think they were more like designed to test our humanity..."
<br><br>
"I totally agree." Elder Xue nodded.
<br><br>
"It shouldn't be all that difficult to pass these tests," said Geoffrey.
<br><br>
It was hard for him to believe that no one from the six great races of the Deep Space had managed to pass through the Levitation Tower for a great many years.
<br><br>
Elder Xue chuckled and replied, "Although the Elemental race, the Cold Ape race, and the Wrona race are powerful, their civilizations are still at a barbaric stage. They possess a poorly developed humanity."
<br><br>
In fact, even though Elder Xue had previously figured out the key to success lay in not lying to the Levitation Tower, he had never entered the tower himself before. No matter how bright he was, it was impossible for him to guess at the contents of the tests, and he couldn't draw them out of thin air. Therefore, it was most fortunate that they had already come this far.
<br><br>
Next, they underwent three more tests each time they advanced another thirty feet, and they were drawn into three similar illusions.
<br><br>
These illusions repeatedly tested their humanity in different ways. It wasn't all that difficult for Geoffrey or Elder Xue since they both stuck to answering truthfully according to their hearts. Unfortunately, one member of the Elemental race failed to be honest and was killed at the last test.
<br><br>
The remaining three of them all passed the height of one hundred and eighty feet and headed straight for the height of two hundred feet. It was the highest record, and while two members of the Elemental race had achieved it only a few days ago, it had cost their lives.
<br><br>
Both Elder Xue and Geoffrey were curious as to what they would encounter from here on.
<br><br>
As they ascended the spiraling staircase, they soon discovered that there was a transparent barrier at the height of two hundred feet, and it blocked their way ahead.
<br><br>
It resembled a transparent glazed door, blocking in the stairway, and dozens of gray masses could be seen floating inside the transparent object.
<br><br>
Geoffrey stepped forward and gently touched the transparent barrier. The moment his fingertips touched the surface, layers of ripples appeared, circling outwards. This large transparent barrier appeared to be made up of water! Geoffrey's touch seemed to have activated those gray things. One of these quickly approached the surface of the water near Geoffrey's hand. It suddenly turned into a large gray mouth, biting fiercely towards him.
<br><br>
Luckily, the large gray mouth wasn't able to escape the surface of the liquid. It could only flatten and spread inside the liquid. Geoffrey was so frightened, he sat on the ground, and the grey matter quickly turned back into its normal state and retracted.
<br><br>
"What the hell was that?" Geoffrey's face turned white with fright.
<br><br>
Elder Xue furrowed his brows. This transparent object obstructed the only passageway. If they wanted to move ahead, they apparently had no other choice but to swim across the liquid.
<br><br>
The two members of the Elemental race who had made it to this point before must have died in the water. Judging from the current situation, would they also die at this place? "Let me do it!"
<br><br>
noticing Elder Xue's melancholy face, the last remaining member of the Elemental race offered, and then went straight into the liquid. Of course, he was not blind to the dangers inside.
<br><br>
However, these members of the Elemental race were all very respectful to Elder Xue. He was willing to sacrifice himself to discover a way ahead for Elder Xue.
<br><br>
"No!"
<br><br>
Elder Xue tried to stop him, but it was too late. As soon as the man plunged into the liquid, one of the gray things immediately noticed him.
<br><br>
Splash! The gray thing turned into a large mouth and chomped on his head. Then it transformed into a gray mist, which invaded his brain. The man panicked at this development.
<br><br>
When he realized that he was still alive, he waved at Elder Xue to comfort him, and then swam towards the far end of the liquid. When he was about to leave the liquid, his eyes suddenly rolled to the back of his head, and he involuntarily clutched at his head with his hands. His expression became greatly contorted, as if he was suffering from intense pain.
<br><br>
Elder Xue had taught them how to endure pain. Their wills had actually become much stronger than that of ordinary creatures. Since he was so overwhelmed by pain, it wasn't hard to imagine what severe tortures he might be suffering.
<br><br>
"What happened?" Geoffrey asked in a tone laced with trepidation.
<br><br>
Pop! A muffled sound echoed from within the liquid. The man's head suddenly exploded, and a cloud of gray mist emerged again.
<br><br>
The headless corpse of the man slowly floated in the water until it reached the edge and was finally expelled from the water to drop to the ground before Geoffrey and Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Since the headless corpse had crossed the green lines, it was quickly turned to ashes by the Levitation Tower.
<br><br>
Geoffrey stood transfixed into silence for several minutes before he asked, "We can't pass through this place at all. Shall we turn back now?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4250 Reward Geoffrey knew he wouldn't be able to go back at all. Still, he was frightened, so he couldn't help asking that question.
<br><br>
Elder Xue said nothing. He looked away, observing the gray things in the water.
<br><br>
Here, at the height of two hundred feet in the Levitation Tower, he had never thought there would be such things. He felt a strange calmness wash over him. He considered several possibilities, in line with the longstanding motto of the Bold Conjecture House: "Boldly make a hypothesis; carefully verify it." He had come up with that on his own.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey, does the aura of these things strike you as somewhat familiar?"
<br><br>
asked Elder Xue.
<br><br>
"Familiar? No," Geoffrey admitted, shaking his head.
<br><br>
It was the first time he had seen such things.
<br><br>
Elder Xue thought for a while. After a few moments, he headed straight towards the water.
<br><br>
He plunged his head in with a splash.
<br><br>
As soon as his head was inside the clear water, one of the gray things swam quickly towards him. It spread out, forming the shape of sharp teeth, and started to bite him.
<br><br>
Elder Xue immediately withdrew his head before the thing could bite him.
<br><br>
Drops of water trickled down his face.
<br><br>
The gray thing couldn't leave the water. It lingered in the spot where Elder Xue's head had been and spread outwards, before slowly retreating.
<br><br>
Elder Xue repeated this action several more times, as though he was teasing the grey thing. As soon as it swam away, he poked his head back into the transparent water.
<br><br>
Each time, the grey thing rushed back, but not quickly enough to succeed in biting Elder Xue.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, why are you doing that?" Geoffrey asked, wondering what game he was playing with the gray thing.
<br><br>
"I'm trying to sense its aura. It's a pity that it's in water, because the water is blocking most of its aura, making it difficult to sense. I wanted to get a clear confirmation of what I was thinking," Elder Xue answered.
<br><br>
"What did you learn? What kind of aura is it?" Geoffrey said. He himself had no idea.
<br><br>
Elder Xue smiled. "I already knew, and I just wanted to make sure," he said, tapping his temple lightly. "The wisp of consciousness that entered our minds before is very similar to this aura!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey was interested. "Really? If the aura of the things in the water is similar to the aura of that consciousness, then..."
<br><br>
"It's possible that these are the souls of the Fostering race," Elder Xue finished. As usual with him, it was a clever and bold assumption.
<br><br>
"The souls of the Fostering race!" exclaimed Geoffrey in surprise. He wasn't entirely convinced. "But why would they put their souls here? Just to attack us?"
<br><br>
Elder Xue did not respond at once, as he mulled over the implications of his assumption. Finally, he said, "I can't be sure, but there's a good chance it is a reward."
<br><br>
"A reward?" Geoffrey repeated, thoroughly confused.
<br><br>
Just now, that member of the Elemental race had been killed miserably in front of them. How could it have anything to do with a reward? Moreover, a few days ago, the two members of the Elemental race had also climbed to this height. Both had also stopped here.
<br><br>
Elder Xue ignored Geoffrey's obvious skepticism. He went on, "It's impossible for the Fostering race to set up an insurmountable barrier."
<br><br>
"That's just because we haven't found a way, but it can't be a reward,"
<br><br>
Geoffrey objected.
<br><br>
Elder Xue stared at Geoffrey. "If a random human being with a strength level similar to yours or even weaker than you entered the Levitation Tower, do you think there would be a high probability of that human passing the six tests?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey didn't understand why Elder Xue had asked this question. He hesitated and then said, "The probability of passing is very high!"
<br><br>
Those tests of human nature were not too difficult. If his father or Rocher took part in the tests, they would definitely pass them.
<br><br>
"Over the countless long years, about two million people from the six races of the Deep Space have entered the Levitation Tower. But only you, me, and three members of the Elemental race have come this far. Don't you feel that's strange?" Elder Xue asked, trying to make Geoffrey see his reasoning.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had to admit that analysis wasn't his strong suit, but as Elder Xue spoke, Geoffrey tried to follow his thoughts. He asked, "Could it be that the so-called six large races of the Deep Space are too stupid?"
<br><br>
As for human beings, even if they were placed in the savage land, they would probably develop a high level of intelligence after a few thousand years at most. That period of time would be enough for a civilization to rise and their race to become prosperous.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the six large races in the Deep Space had existed for a long time. The Elemental race had even been cultivated by Elder Xue.
<br><br>
It was strange indeed if the members of these races had not yet developed a high level of intelligence.
<br><br>
"After the Deep Space was broken, the conditions for advanced civilization were lost. These six races are like earthworms and ants that live underground. They have been restricted since they were born, so even if I teach them as much as I can, they can only learn so much. They still underperform and act unwisely on many occasions," said Elder Xue. He added, "If you put a wisp of soul into an ant or an earthworm, what will happen?"
<br><br>
"Their heads would explode?" Geoffrey spoke tentatively. He had never imagined such a thing.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Elder Xue, pointing at the white ashes on the ground.
<br><br>
"From the perspective of the Fostering race, the members of the Elemental race are ants, earthworms and bugs on the ground. They can't bear the souls of the Fostering race at all, so they exploded and were killed."
<br><br>
"What about us? You think our heads will not explode?" Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
"We have no choice but to take a risk!"
<br><br>
With a loud splash, Elder Xue went straight into the transparent water.
<br><br>
Although he had the physical body of a member of the Elemental race, his soul was a human spirit. He came from the main world, but he was still more confident than his companions from the Elemental race.
<br><br>
Once more, the grey thing formed teeth and approached Elder Xue.
<br><br>
It bit him, and then it drilled into his head continuously. Geoffrey watched with his mouth open. He found the scene terrifying.
<br><br>
Elder Xue's eyes rolled and his body twitched repeatedly.
<br><br>
Geoffrey stared, afraid that Elder Xue's head would explode any second now.
<br><br>
Three seconds passed, and then six, nine...
<br><br>
Around a minute later, Elder Xue finally stopped trembling. He floated calmly in the transparent water. His gaze met Geoffrey's, and there was a deep, profound look in his eyes. He crooked his finger at him.
<br><br>
"You can really bear it!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey said excitedly, rushing forward. He started to enter the transparent water, but he stopped as soon as he approached the surface.
<br><br>
He had forgotten that he was different from Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Elder Xue was no ordinary human spirit, but among the strongest ones.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was a human being from the chaos, and he was only a True God.
<br><br>
The gap between them was too big.
<br><br>
Elder Xue could bear it, but Geoffrey might not be able to.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, how about I wait for you here? You can save me after you get the Heavenly Ring Staff," Geoffrey said, smiling weakly at him.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, Elder Xue swam from the transparent water. He stretched out a hand, grabbed Geoffrey by the neck, and dragged him into the transparent water.
<br><br>
The water splashed around them as Elder Xue submerged Geoffrey in the depths.
<br><br>
Another gray thing promptly swam towards Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Like a blooming gray flower, the thing wrapped petal-shaped arms around Geoffrey's head, and drilled into his mind.
<br><br>
Geoffrey trembled.
<br><br>
He felt an intense, swelling pain as the powerful soul force forced its way into his mind.
<br><br>
The soul power was very pure and untainted. Because it had no owner, Geoffrey absorbed it very smoothly and naturally.
<br><br>
As the soul assimilated fully into Geoffrey's mind, the pain grew, becoming unbearable. He felt like his head was about to crack open.
<br><br>
Chapter 4251 The World of Nothingness (Part One) Geoffrey almost had never experienced any sort of hardship before. How could he tolerate such an intense pain now? At this moment, the pain had shut out his ability to think. He only hoped that he could pass out and escape the situation he was in somehow.
<br><br>
However, the soul power continued to strengthen his soul, and at the same time, the pain that wrung through his entire body with it grew much stronger.
<br><br>
It seemed like endless torture that refused to meet an end.
<br><br>
He suffered in silence as the pain had him writhe and groan. It was killing him to have to tolerate it unwillingly. When he was about to open his mouth to release the pressure, the water forcefully poured itself in.
<br><br>
His time of soul infusion was only thirty seconds longer than that of Elder Xue, but Geoffrey felt those minor seconds to be equal to those of a century.
<br><br>
After it was over, Geoffrey remained in the water without moving for a while, staring up into space. His newly acquired powerful soul made him have a new perception of the world, so he just lay there, taking his moment to digest it all in.
<br><br>
"My soul... I can feel it... How did it become so powerful?"
<br><br>
After processing his thoughts and coming to terms with his newly acquired abilities, Geoffrey swam out of the transparent water. The moment his eyes made contact with Elder Xue, they reflected unparalleled momentum.
<br><br>
Of course, Elder Xue quickly caught on with the change in Geoffrey at one glance.
<br><br>
As a top-level master in the main world, Elder Xue's soul was extremely powerful. After he absorbed the soul power of the Fostering race, his soul power had increased by four times, but Geoffrey was different from him.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was a mere True God in the chaos. Because of the difference in their status and abilities, after he went through the ordeal of absorbing the soul power of the Fostering race, his soul had probably grown exponentially.
<br><br>
"This feeling... It's like no other I have ever felt. It's amazing!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey eyed himself up as he exclaimed with excitement. A while ago, he was writhing in pain and prayed for it to stop. But now, he seemed to have forgotten all about it after having obtained such great power in return. He felt as though he had been reborn.
<br><br>
Elder Xue shared his excitement. It was indeed a great surprise that they could strengthen their souls to such a level. But soon as the excitement wore off and he began to collect his thoughts, he turned to Geoffrey and asked, "Why do you think they infuse such a surging soul power into us?"
<br><br>
The Levitation Tower was the last-standing hope left by the Fostering race as a symbol of their existence before they were annihilated. They were an astute race, and nothing they did was pointless. There must have been a reason why they chose to strengthen Geoffrey's and Elder Xue's souls.
<br><br>
"I guess we'll know when we go up," Geoffrey said as he pointed to the top of the tower.
<br><br>
Elder Xue gave him a slight nod then continued to walk up the steps alongside him.
<br><br>
After they left the transparent water, the green lines that once portrayed the path they could walk on disappeared.
<br><br>
When they made their way onto the next floor, which was two hundred and ten feet high, they saw a ball appear before their eyes in the center.
<br><br>
The ball hung loosely in the air. It was free of all imperfections. It was as if it was carved with utmost intricacy. There were no flaws on any side of it.
<br><br>
However, just as they stared deeply at the ball, they suddenly felt themselves being slowly consumed with strong feelings of loneliness. The ball seemed to be in existence for as long as forever. It had no meaning attached to its life. It was without a beginning or an end.
<br><br>
"What's wrong with this ball?" Geoffrey asked in a concerned tone.
<br><br>
Elder Xue kept his gaze fixated on the ball as he walked and gave his shoulders a light shrug, indicating his lack of knowledge about it as well.
<br><br>
At this moment, a faint light appeared before them, stopping them in their tracks. The light continued to twist and changed its form continuously until it finally manifested itself into a little girl. It was the same little girl that Geoffrey had encountered several times in the previous illusions.
<br><br>
"Nice to meet you again," the girl spoke indifferently with her hands clasped behind her back as she leaned towards him.
<br><br>
Geoffrey began to look around in all directions in a frantic state before he asked nervously, "Is this an illusion, or is this real?"
<br><br>
The little girl shook her head at his confusion and replied in a monotonous voice, "It's real."
<br><br>
But Elder Xue could see through the little girl and tell that the girl herself was an illusion.
<br><br>
"If that's really the case then... What are you doing here?" Geoffrey asked as he raised his brows.
<br><br>
In fact, he understood that the little girl was somehow connected to the Levitation Tower. The Levitation Tower needed a person to communicate with Geoffrey. The little girl was created to serve that purpose.
<br><br>
"I'll be your guide. Let me help you climb up from here on," the little girl said, her face devoid of all emotions as she beckoned them to follow her.
<br><br>
"Thank you for the offer, but I think we'll be fine on our own," Geoffrey said blatantly as he refused her help with a wave of his hand.
<br><br>
The little girl paid no heed to his remark and pointed towards the lifeless ball. "This is the World of Nothingness. It is infinitely large and small at the same time. It contains everything, and yet it also remains empty. It's the first-grade world."
<br><br>
Geoffrey still chose to ignore her and brushed her words aside. However, Elder Xue's expression switched drastically after he heard what she had to say. He pointed towards the ball and asked, "Are you telling me that this is the first-grade world? The real first-grade world?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4252 The World of Nothingness (Part Two) "Of course not." The little girl cut his confusion short with a curt reply.
<br><br>
She stared at Elder Xue with eyes filled with mockery as if to look down on him. "The World of Nothingness contains all kinds of things. Even an insignificant needle wouldn't be able to escape it. If it really were to appear, you'd instantly become a part of it, and if that happened, you wouldn't even be able to stand here."
<br><br>
"Is this World of Nothingness a creation of the Fostering race?" Elder Xue asked again.
<br><br>
"No, it isn't." The little girl shook her head. "It was created by Clarence."
<br><br>
"And who is this Clarence that you speak of?" Elder Xue continued to ask one question, followed by the other, to dissolve his confusion.
<br><br>
The girl tilted her head and placed her finger on her chin as if she was lost in thought. "He owns everything, and he has created everything." After giving a brief, yet vague explanation, she continued while pointing her finger upwards, "To advance further, you just need to climb up."
<br><br>
"That's not so hard. We'll be fine." Geoffrey shrugged as if to refuse all her help.
<br><br>
The atmosphere in the World of Nothingness really did have an eerie vibe to it, but what could it possibly do? At most, it could only manage to affect something so little as his mood, right? That was not so bad. Without giving the ball a second glance, Geoffrey continued to climb up, ignorant of his surroundings and the situation he was putting himself in because of his arrogance.
<br><br>
Seeing Geoffrey's indifferent behavior, the little girl just smiled and shook her head in disapproval in silence.
<br><br>
After they walked two circles around the Levitation Tower, they reached the height of two hundred and thirty feet. There, the ball disappeared out of sight, along with the lingering desolate feeling brewing inside of them.
<br><br>
However, just as they took the next step forward, a huge wall appeared before them in the center of the tower. The wall was crafted with several intricate patterns, consisting of squares and circles of various sizes all interlinked with each other, along with different sets of lines that formed unusual things.
<br><br>
"What you see before you is the Wall World, the second-grade world," the little girl explained from behind in her usual monotonous voice.
<br><br>
To Geoffrey and Elder Xue, the Wall World was nothing more than a picture. However, it felt relieving compared to the World of Nothingness they experienced earlier. They could even sense faint signs of vitality emanating from the lines that formed vivid pictures of living creatures etched on the Wall World.
<br><br>
"This is not a test at all. It's just a brief visit," Geoffrey scoffed as he gave his shoulders a slight shrug.
<br><br>
The little girl seemed frustrated from Geoffrey's continued arrogant demeanor. Unable to withstand it any longer, she snapped at him, "The World of Nothingness and the Wall World are at lower levels compared to your world, which is why you remain unaffected. When you are confronted with the higher-grade worlds up there, I'll see if you can still speak as arrogantly as you do now."
<br><br>
Elder Xue was taken aback by the little girl's strong statement. He began to piece everything together and finally figured out the reason why the Fostering race bestowed them with their current soul power.
<br><br>
Next, they would have to go through the baptism of the higher-grade worlds. The higher the grade of the worlds, the more information they contained, and the higher the requirements for the souls.
<br><br>
'Could I withstand the sixth-grade world with my current soul power? What about the seventh-grade world? And the eighth-grade world...' While Elder Xue pondered over his limitations, his eyes fell on Geoffrey, who remained beside him.
<br><br>
As a creature from the third-grade world, Geoffrey was surprisingly able to move freely in the fourth-grade and the fifth-grade worlds. Perhaps he could be able to reach those higher worlds with ease compared to Elder Xue himself.
<br><br>
Even though Elder Xue harbored these concerns in his head, he didn't voice them out to Geoffrey. Instead, he continued to climb up alongside Geoffrey without uttering a word.
<br><br>
After another climb of twenty feet, they came across the third-grade world. This was the world Geoffrey was most familiar with.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had been away from the chaos for a steady period. Suddenly coming face to face with his world made him stop in his tracks as he stared blankly at it. Upon seeing things he was once familiar with, he couldn't help but feel homesick. But then, he lowered his gaze to shake the feeling off.
<br><br>
Then came the fourth-grade world. This time, it was Elder Xue who started to experience deep feelings of nostalgia with one short glimpse of it. After all, he had spent a fair amount of time in the fifth-grade world and never got the chance to return to the main world.
<br><br>
When they continued their climb and reached a height of three hundred feet, they were faced with the fifth-grade world. This world did not pose any difficulty for them as they had no feelings attached to it like the previous ones.
<br><br>
"This is the fifth-grade world, known as the Stellar World. Those are the members of our now perished Fostering race," the little girl introduced.
<br><br>
Just as Geoffrey laid his eyes on the creatures of the Fostering race, he broke out in a fit of laughter. "Seriously? Those are the members of your Fostering race? They look so funny!"
<br><br>
Elder Xue had never seen the members of the Fostering race before. He didn't expect them to look so naive and cute to the eyes. However, his reaction wasn't as offensive as the one Geoffrey portrayed. He nudged Geoffrey with his elbow and shook his head to gesture him to stop laughing.
<br><br>
Chapter 4253 The Soul Reincarnation The little girl, who was leading the way, didn't want to entertain Geoffrey's rudeness.
<br><br>
She knew that there was such a huge gap between civilizations. Thus she couldn't believe and imagine why Geoffrey could laugh at it.
<br><br>
As she took the two of them to climb another twenty feet, the sixth-grade world welcomed them.
<br><br>
However, Elder Xue quickly stopped just before they entered the sixthgrade world.
<br><br>
He noticed that the steps in front of him were no longer visible. What he could only see were these mysterious-looking square frames. At one moment, they would merge to form larger frames, and then the next moment, they would quickly divide again into the smaller ones. It was a cycle that didn't make sense to him.
<br><br>
As a creature of the fourth-grade world, it was extremely difficult for Elder Xue to fully grasp the Deep Space. In fact, he only managed to adapt to the Deep Space because he was able to obtain the physical body of the Elemental race by chance. Now that he was about to enter the sixthgrade world, he had some worries that he might not be able to adapt to it.
<br><br>
"I know what you're thinking. This is the World of No Limits. It won't be that easy for you to adapt," the little girl said with a straight face.
<br><br>
"If I can't adapt, can I pass it?" Elder Xue asked, just to make sure.
<br><br>
Although he had reached so far in the Levitation Tower, he still wanted to leave alive.
<br><br>
Right now, there was just the two of them. If he wouldn't be able to make it, there was still Geoffrey. If Geoffrey could still go up smoothly, he would have no regrets. He could place all his hopes on the young man without reservations.
<br><br>
"Of course not. That's not how it works," the little girl answered straightforwardly. She even wondered why the elder would ask such a question. "You must be able to completely adapt to this world and see everything clearly before you can pass."
<br><br>
"Adapt to this world? See everything clearly?" Elder Xue almost laughed at the little girl's statement. "It's impossible for the creatures from the lower-grade worlds to do what you're saying. Even the masters of your race weren't able to do it."
<br><br>
"What are you saying? Just accept the Soul Reincarnation. This way, the creatures from a lower-grade world would be able to comprehend a higher-grade world. What's the point of the Levitation Tower bestowing you such a strong soul power? Think about it. It is so you can withstand the Soul Reincarnation," the little girl explained.
<br><br>
After listening to her, Elder Xue finally understood this simple logic.
<br><br>
Actually, he remembered that there was a technique in the Four Spirits Sect that was similar to the Soul Reincarnation. It was the Red Jade Rite that was developed by the Bold Conjecture House. Using this method, the third-grade creatures were able to smoothly transform into fourth-grade ones.
<br><br>
However, the drawback of this method was that the creatures would have to endure a lot of pain in the process. Once they failed to withstand it, they would eventually be shattered to pieces.
<br><br>
"I see. Then let's see how many times I can withstand the Soul Reincarnation!" After saying that, Elder Xue took a step forward with a determined expression on his face.
<br><br>
As he stepped into the World of No Limits, he instantly felt that his entire body transformed into the countless square frames of various sizes that he saw earlier. All of his senses had undergone violent changes that he couldn't determine what was going on.
<br><br>
While Elder Xue quickly fell into a state of panic, he saw a bright red square frame appear before him. This frame enveloped him, and he felt like his body was being cut into countless pieces.
<br><br>
He realized that this sensation wasn't coming from his physical body, but directly from his soul. It could be said that he was just hallucinating, but he had no way of knowing for sure. He only felt that his body and soul were in immense pain and suffering. There was no way to avoid the pain, and he couldn't even pass out. He could only resist it through his willpower. He needed to overcome this or he might not be able to return to his original form.
<br><br>
This went on for five minutes before the process suddenly stopped.
<br><br>
The frames began to arrange themselves and combine together to form a unique rule.
<br><br>
While this was happening, Elder Xue gradually understood the rule and saw the steps in the sixth-grade world. "Did I finish the Soul Reincarnation?" Elder Xue asked as he gasped for air.
<br><br>
"Yes," the little girl standing beside him replied briefly. It seemed that she had been there this whole time and was completely unaffected by the shift to the sixth-grade world.
<br><br>
"It's his turn now," she continued as she pointed at Geoffrey who was still standing at the other side.
<br><br>
Just now, Geoffrey was able to clearly see the pain and agony that Elder Xue underwent. Since he had no choice but to proceed, he got very nervous. "I... If I can understand the sixth-grade world, does it mean that I don't need to undergo this Soul Reincarnation?"
<br><br>
The little girl glanced at him coldly and was annoyed at his procrastination. "Cut the crap and just step over here!"
<br><br>
With that, Geoffrey was forced to step inside.
<br><br>
The rules of the two worlds were completely different. As soon as a creature made a step into the higher-grade world, he shouldn't be able to take the next one without experiencing the Soul Reincarnation. However, to the little girl's surprise, Geoffrey entered the sixth-grade world and proceeded to walk up the stairs easily.
<br><br>
The little girl couldn't believe what she just saw. "You came from the sixth-grade world? No, I don't think so. Did you experience the Soul Reincarnation already? But that was too fast."
<br><br>
Geoffrey just shrugged his shoulders while the little girl was still busy analyzing what had really happened.
<br><br>
The fact still remained that he was able to travel through different worlds effortlessly.
<br><br>
In fact, Geoffrey had no idea about the Soul Reincarnation, so he must have not experienced it.
<br><br>
At the same time, Elder Xue, whose face was still pale, let out a faint smile as he saw Geoffrey's relaxed expression as he walked around. His confidence grew stronger that even if he couldn't make it, Geoffrey still had a huge chance.
<br><br>
As he climbed up the steps of the sixth-grade world, Geoffrey couldn't avert his eyes from the center of the tower.
<br><br>
"Hey, what are those square stone tablets over there?" he finally asked out of curiosity.
<br><br>
"Those are not stone tablets. They are the Sacred Spirits," the little girl answered, quite annoyed at Geoffrey's ignorance.
<br><br>
"Huh? Did you mean that those are the stone tablets set up for the Sacred Spirits?" Geoffrey asked again, confused at the little girl's earlier answer.
<br><br>
"No. You heard me right the first time. They are the Sacred Spirits, the strongest race in the World of No Limits. They are also the origin of the Fostering race," the little girl replied in an impatient tone. According to the rules, she shouldn't get emotional at any time. However, the guy in front of her was really starting to get on her nerves.
<br><br>
"Hmm, then why do they look like stone tablets? It is ominous and ridiculous," Geoffrey remarked indifferently.
<br><br>
Elder Xue, who walked in front of them, was rendered speechless. He could only shake his head helplessly as he heard Geoffrey's comments.
<br><br>
Even the little girl just stayed silent as she gritted her teeth.
<br><br>
After they passed the sixth-grade world, they had already reached a total height of three hundred and sixty feet. The little girl stopped for a moment as she was about to introduce the next world.
<br><br>
At this moment, Elder Xue's legs started to slightly tremble. In the past, if he had an opportunity to experience the Soul Reincarnation, he would be deeply overjoyed.
<br><br>
However, after experiencing it once, he realized that the pain it brought was totally unbearable. He also got the hint from the little girl that as the grade of the world got higher, the pain from the Soul Reincarnation would also increase.
<br><br>
"This is the seventh-grade world, the Boundless Divine World. Please come in," the little girl said with an emotionless face.
<br><br>
This time, her gaze was fixed on Geoffrey. She really wanted to see him suffer the torture bestowed by the Soul Reincarnation.
<br><br>
But unexpectedly, just like what happened in the sixth-grade world, Geoffrey walked in leisurely and proceeded to look at the center of the Levitation Tower. His eyes lit up as if he had seen something amusing.
<br><br>
"Bamboos! There are so many bamboos. Don't tell me that they are the natives of the Boundless Divine World!"
<br><br>
"This guy…" The little girl's eyes widened in surprise.
<br><br>
Upon seeing that Geoffrey still roamed around in a carefree manner, she was both shocked and frustrated at the same time.
<br><br>
'This is already the seventh-grade world. He is neither a fifth-grade nor a sixth-grade creature. Then, he's a seventh-grade creature? That should be a nasty joke! Why isn't the Soul Reincarnation activated on him? Is there something wrong with the Levitation Tower? But, it couldn't be. It worked just fine with the elder earlier.' While she was still at a loss for words, Elder Xue took the liberty to step into the seventh-grade world. With his first step, he instantly fell into the torture of the Soul Reincarnation once again.
<br><br>
Seeing this, the little girl was fully convinced that there was nothing wrong with the Levitation Tower. As she looked towards Geoffrey, she finally realized that his ability was way beyond her imagination.
<br><br>
"Does it mean that the worlds of different grades do not affect you?" That was all the little girl could conclude at this point.
<br><br>
"I honestly don't know," Geoffrey answered frankly. He then pointed at the stairs and said, "If we continue to go up, we'll know."
<br><br>
Chapter 4254 Boundless Perfect World Geoffrey had long wanted to know why he could go through worlds completely unaffected. Now was his chance.
<br><br>
The worlds he was visiting became more complex and obscure as time went by, but he reached them with no problems just the same.
<br><br>
He wanted to know what connection he had with these worlds.
<br><br>
But Elder Xue had already been subjected to much agony, and the Soul Reincarnation in the seventh-grade world proved even more torturous than the last. He managed to endure it, but it was clearly taking a heavy toll on him.
<br><br>
When warriors of the Elemental race suffered from some debilitating condition, their faces turned paler and paler then began to wrinkle. Elder Xue's face was now so white and covered with wrinkles; it resembled a crumpled piece of paper. It was a clear testament to the ordeal he had gone through.
<br><br>
"Go on ahead. Don't wait for me. Keep climbing..." Elder Xue said weakly, stopping to catch his breath.
<br><br>
A look of deep concern crossed Geoffrey's face as he saw the state Elder Xue was in. "Do you need to rest?"
<br><br>
He could afford to wait. There was no time limit in the Levitation Tower anyway.
<br><br>
But the little girl piped up, "Resting is futile. Undergoing the Soul Reincarnation always leaves behind a great pressure on the body. There is no fixing it."
<br><br>
Elder Xue nodded at this. The Red Jade Rite of the Four Spirits Sect had a similar effect. It could allow creatures of third-grade world to be able to become creatures of fourth-grade world, but it also imposed a mental strain which could never be lifted.
<br><br>
Elder Xue was able to bear it if he had only crossed a world, but as a fourth-grade world creature in a seventh-grade world, he was already stretched to the limit.
<br><br>
"Then what should we do? Go back?" Geoffrey said, frowning as he mulled the situation.
<br><br>
The little girl sighed exasperatedly, "I could just end his life."
<br><br>
After all, she thought, she really could.
<br><br>
Geoffrey chose not to respond to that. He hurried over to Elder Xue's side to support him as he struggled to climb up. Elder Xue sighed, "I'm afraid the eighth-grade world will be the death of me," he said, before being overcome with a coughing fit.
<br><br>
"But I wouldn't know what to do if you died," Geoffrey bewailed.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had been ambitious and self-sufficient before Elder Xue came along, but now, he would feel quite lost without him.
<br><br>
To Geoffrey's surprise, Elder Xue straightened up, grabbed his collar and lifted him a foot off the ground with a sudden burst of power. "Snap out of it! Do everything you can to get the Heavenly Ring Staff!"
<br><br>
"Even if I get it, I wouldn't know how to get back," Geoffrey muttered.
<br><br>
"Don't forget that I'll just be losing this form. The real me is still outside the Sky Wheel City!" Elder Xue had gotten so riled up that he appeared to recover his energy a little. His face began to regain color and lose some of the wrinkles.
<br><br>
Geoffrey sighed and gave in. "Fine. I'll give it my all," he mumbled.
<br><br>
"Louder!" Elder Xue commanded firmly.
<br><br>
"I'll give it my all!" Geoffrey shouted.
<br><br>
The grip on his collar loosened and Geoffrey found himself on the ground again. Elder Xue fell back into a stoop and continued the arduous trek up.
<br><br>
They had to circle around the Levitation Tower thrice and climb thirty feet to reach the eighth-grade world. Had he been alone, Geoffrey would have sped right through it, but having to assist Elder Xue, it took a full fifteen minutes.
<br><br>
Finally, the eighth-grade world lay before them.
<br><br>
"The Boundless Intent World."
<br><br>
It was a sight to behold.
<br><br>
It was like a work of art in Elder Xue's eyes. The world was full of color, interweaving into each other but remaining distinct at the same time.
<br><br>
Elder Xue knew that the eighth-grade world would kill him at this rate, but with an encouraging pat on Geoffrey's shoulder, he walked in without hesitation.
<br><br>
He already felt blessed having laid eyes on the Boundless Intent World.
<br><br>
The moment he set foot into the world, however, Elder Xue immediately felt like he was being torn into tiny pieces. His body started to dissipate until finally, there was nothing left.
<br><br>
In contrast, Geoffrey entered the world entirely unharmed.
<br><br>
That was, save for his despair. As they had feared, the eighth-grade world was, indeed, the end for Elder Xue. Geoffrey hadn't known Elder Xue for a long time, but the old man had brought him this far. Geoffrey also knew Elder Xue was an important figure in the Four Spirits Sect, and that it was him who had helped his father, Zen, to accomplish all that he had achieved.
<br><br>
Geoffrey became vaguely aware that the little girl was praising his ability to pass smoothly through worlds, but he couldn't find it in himself to appreciate anything right now. He simply steeled himself and strode onward.
<br><br>
Outside the Levitation Tower, the races of the Deep Space were in an uproar, witnessing everything.
<br><br>
Not long after the members of the Elemental race entered, one of them died. This was the subject of much mockery from the Cold Ape race.
<br><br>
Most of them, after all, could at least still survive more than twenty to thirty feet up.
<br><br>
Eventually, however, members of the Elemental race were able to reach a height of two hundred feet. No one could break that record. Then, what was more surprising was that two light orbs ascended further up. The Deep Space races had been stunned at the sight.
<br><br>
Exclamations had broken out when they saw one of the light orbs suddenly get snuffed out.
<br><br>
Some felt vindicated, while others felt pity.
<br><br>
Most of them hoped, of course, that the members of their own race could climb all the way up to the top of the Levitation Tower, but there were still some who were more afraid to die. They would rather see someone finally put an end to this deadly tower. The Elemental race now gave them hope.
<br><br>
"That's four hundred feet, now..."
<br><br>
"Is that Elder Xue?"
<br><br>
"Maybe it's that new guy..."
<br><br>
Tension gripped the Deep Space races as they stared up at the last light orb, different thoughts and theories running through their minds.
<br><br>
In the oval-shaped building at the edge of the square, the little monster from the Elemental race who had been left behind likewise kept his eyes on the light orb, not even daring to blink.
<br><br>
He had come in on the same day as Geoffrey. If everyone died in the Levitation Tower, everything would fall on him.
<br><br>
He had watched with increasing dismay and fear as other green light orbs had been snuffed out one after another in the tower. Now, he could do nothing but pray fervently.
<br><br>
Four hundred and ten feet...
<br><br>
Four hundred and twenty feet...
<br><br>
Four hundred and thirty feet...
<br><br>
"The Boundless Void World."
<br><br>
Four hundred and forty feet...
<br><br>
Four hundred and fifty feet...
<br><br>
Four hundred and sixty feet...
<br><br>
"The Boundless Secondary World."
<br><br>
Four hundred and seventy feet...
<br><br>
Four hundred and eighty feet...
<br><br>
Four hundred and ninety feet...
<br><br>
"The Boundless Shock World."
<br><br>
Geoffrey passed worlds of higher and higher grades, more and more changing scenery that would have astounded any observer.
<br><br>
His father would have cherished the sights.
<br><br>
Geoffrey, however, grew bored of them quickly. The consecutive drastic change in scenery was exhausting.
<br><br>
"The Boundless Shock World is the twelfth-grade world, a world the closest to perfect. A grade higher, and that would be the Boundless Perfect World..." The little girl was still informing him.
<br><br>
"Have I reached the top?" Geoffrey interrupted her.
<br><br>
"But the thirteenth-grade world, the Boundless Perfect World, can not be restored here. Even Clarence couldn't do that. Therefore, there are only twelve small worlds in the Levitation Tower..." the little girl rattled on, adamant that Geoffrey should know this.
<br><br>
"I just want to know if I've reached the top!" Geoffrey pressed.
<br><br>
Infuriated, the little girl stopped her lecture. "If you had just listened, you would know you are at four hundred and ninety feet, and you will reach the top at the next level. Go on up, then, if you can!" she snapped, a challenge in her voice.
<br><br>
Chapter 4255 The Second Reward Geoffrey looked up. He stepped forward without hesitation.
<br><br>
Now that he'd come so far, what else was there to fear? At the end of the Boundless Shock World, the staircase stopped in front of an ordinary stone door. In contrast with the rest of the exquisite Levitation Tower, the surface of the door was rough and unpolished.
<br><br>
Geoffrey did not stop to think it over. He reached out and pushed the door open.
<br><br>
The door creaked as it swung open.
<br><br>
It had not been opened for many years, but the rough material was still intact.
<br><br>
As soon as he saw what lay behind the door, Geoffrey paused, surprised.
<br><br>
Through the doorway was a space as rough and craggy as the door itself.
<br><br>
It was as though every inch of ground had been filled in with crushed, jagged stones.
<br><br>
The space inside the door belonged to the fifth-grade world. The Levitation Tower had become normal at this point. However, that wasn't Geoffrey's main concern.
<br><br>
"Where is the Heavenly Ring Staff?" Geoffrey asked, turning to face the little girl.
<br><br>
The little girl stood a step behind him, making no move to pass through the door. She did not have the right to enter the top floor.
<br><br>
"Go in and find it yourself," she answered, still feeling a sense of dissatisfaction towards Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Geoffrey nodded. He stepped into the room at the top floor and looked around him.
<br><br>
His gaze landed on a purple crystal pillar in the center of the space. He walked towards it, examining it closely. When he got closer, he saw that there seemed to be some wooden object embedded in the pillar.
<br><br>
His eyes lit up as he realized what it was. "This is the Heavenly Ring Staff!"
<br><br>
The staff had a strange, unwieldy shape, which was why Geoffrey hadn't recognized it immediately.
<br><br>
However, since it was the only object of note on the top floor of the Levitation Tower, it must be the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
Geoffrey felt as though he was about to burst with excitement. He'd finally found it. Right now, this was the most important thing in the world to him.
<br><br>
He moved back a few paces and raised his left hand, spreading his fingers.
<br><br>
At the same time, he balled his right hand into a fist, allowing energy to flow through him. He sent a blast of power towards the pillar.
<br><br>
The blast crashed into the purple crystal.
<br><br>
But there was no boom, only a faint, muffled sound.
<br><br>
The purple crystal pillar was completely unharmed by the blast. It had not moved an inch, nor had it sustained any cracks or other damage.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was taken aback. He prepared to use several more theurgies to obtain the staff from inside the pillar.
<br><br>
With his cultivation base as a True God, he was powerful in the universe.
<br><br>
But he was weak in the divine land, let alone in this fifth-grade world.
<br><br>
He displayed his full power and pushed himself to the limit, but it was no use. The purple crystal still stood there. He could not even leave a single scratch on the pillar.
<br><br>
Geoffrey stopped to assess the situation. He realized that he simply wasn't strong enough to get the staff within the pillar.
<br><br>
"It's a pity that Elder Xue couldn't hold on any longer, '" he muttered to himself. "If he had managed to come here with me before he died, he could have broken open the pillar since he had the physical body of the Elemental race."
<br><br>
Geoffrey returned to the door, deciding to ask the little girl for help.
<br><br>
After all, she was the guide of the Levitation Tower. She might not help him, but it was worth a shot. It had not been easy for him to reach the top floor of the tower, and he was unwilling to give up after all his effort. He needed to find a way to break the pillar.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the little girl seemed puzzled, and unable to offer any direct solution. "This is beyond my abilities," she said. "I can't enter this door, and I don't know how to unravel what's inside. But I think that Clarence, in his infinite wisdom, would never leave you in a dead end. Try to explore further and search for clues inside."
<br><br>
Geoffrey was disappointed at the vague answer, but still, what she said made sense. He reentered through the doorway of the top floor.
<br><br>
He glanced around again. "Except for the purple crystal pillar and these rough stones, there is nothing else... So, since I can't break the purple crystal pillar, I must find the answer in these rough stones," he mused.
<br><br>
He bent to examine the rough stones beneath his feet, and found that each stone had a series of small bulges on its surface. Each bulge was about the size of his fist.
<br><br>
A thought flashed through Geoffrey's mind.
<br><br>
'Could there be something hidden in these stones?' he wondered.
<br><br>
He extended a hand towards a nearby stone, scratching its surface.
<br><br>
The rough stone was softer than it looked, as it was made of sand. In moments, Geoffrey had used his fingers to pry sand from its surface.
<br><br>
It took some effort, but eventually, the sand was cleared off, exposing an oval object. Geoffrey's eyes narrowed as he stared at the object. It looked soft, like a piece of flesh embedded in stone, and he could feel heat and energy rising from it.
<br><br>
"What's this?" he said to himself.
<br><br>
Without giving it a second thought, Geoffrey reached down with both hands, grabbing at the fleshy oval object to pull it out from the stone.
<br><br>
To his astonishment, as soon as he touched it, the soft flesh sank down beneath his grip. His ten fingers were embedded in the object.
<br><br>
He immediately tried to pull away, but his fingers were stuck. Like melted candy, the fleshy object had integrated with his hands. It was stuck to his skin and he could not pull loose no matter how hard he tried.
<br><br>
"This thing has drilled into my hands!" Geoffrey muttered in surprise.
<br><br>
Inwardly, he was greatly unsettled. "Calm down! Calm down!"
<br><br>
he told himself, trying to control his nerves.
<br><br>
Here, there was no one to rely on but himself. He could not afford to give in to his panic.
<br><br>
He could feel the flesh continuously integrating with his hands, but it was not painful at all. Indeed, the only sensation was an enveloping warmth.
<br><br>
As Geoffrey watched, unable to do anything, the flesh fused with his own tissue, spreading along the surface of his arms. He found it deeply disturbing, but as far as he could tell, it wasn't doing him any harm.
<br><br>
Several minutes later, the flesh seemed to have completely integrated with his body. Geoffrey could find no sign of the fusion except that his hands were slightly thicker, and looked a tad more awkward. Still, he was able to move freely, and to his shock, he soon realized that his strength had increased significantly.
<br><br>
This flesh contained astonishing energy! "This is— This is a reward!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey spluttered, flexing his fingers experimentally.
<br><br>
When he had reached the height of two hundred feet, the Levitation Tower had given him and Elder Xue a reward for their souls. Now, he had received a reward for his physical body.
<br><br>
"As long as I absorb enough flesh, I can break the purple crystal pillar!"
<br><br>
he exclaimed. Geoffrey finally knew what he needed to do.
<br><br>
He began vigorously scratching at the bulges on the surface of another rough stone near him. When he removed the layer of sand on the surface, he saw another lump of oval flesh.
<br><br>
He grabbed the flesh without hesitation, allowing it to integrate into his body.
<br><br>
By his estimation, there were about four hundred rough stones like this on the top floor. Geoffrey patiently dug out the oval flesh one by one, absorbing each into his body.
<br><br>
As he worked, Geoffrey felt a tremendous change in his body. After consuming the flesh in hundreds of stones, he realized that his body size had expanded to four times its normal size.
<br><br>
'My soul is comparable to those of the masters in the Deep Space, and my physical body has now also reached a high level. If I return to the chaos, the strength of my physical body alone would be enough to terrify my father, ' Geoffrey thought. Finally, he grabbed the last stone.
<br><br>
With his newfound strength, he needed only to scratch the surface lightly to get out the flesh from within.
<br><br>
He absorbed the final piece of flesh. Then he stood straight, stretching out his arms and legs, testing his increased strength. He felt invigorated and very powerful. Feeling anticipation rise inside him, he headed back towards the purple crystal pillar.
<br><br>
"The Heavenly Ring Staff is mine now!" he cried.
<br><br>
He clenched his hand into a fist and punched the pillar with all his might.
<br><br>
This time, there was an earsplitting cracking sound.
<br><br>
The top portion of the solid purple crystal pillar splintered, then smashed into pieces. The upper half of the Heavenly Ring Staff was revealed.
<br><br>
Chapter 4256 Leave Based on appearance alone, there was nothing special about the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
It just looked like a piece of old wood with a frail-looking bottom side and a slightly thick top side. The crown at its top was messily spread out, making it appear a bit bloated and peculiar. All in all, it gave a mysterious impression, like a delicate artwork.
<br><br>
Geoffrey stretched out his huge hand, which was several times bigger than before, and attempted to pull the Heavenly Ring Staff from the purple crystal.
<br><br>
However, he failed to remove it with his brute force. Actually, he couldn't put too much pressure on the staff because he was afraid that he might break it.
<br><br>
Geoffrey then threw a few more punches at the purple crystal, where the lower part of the staff was buried. A few moments after, the crystal was finally smashed to pieces, allowing him to completely acquire the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
As he stared upon the staff in his hands, he couldn't help but blurt out, "Does this thing really have the ability to reverse the grim situation that we're facing?"
<br><br>
He inspected the staff some more and then injected a wisp of consciousness into it. As soon as it entered the staff, it just vanished without a trace.
<br><br>
"It's useless, huh?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey was quite surprised upon seeing it. After thinking for a while, he decided to grab the Heavenly Ring Staff and walked towards the door. He saw that the little girl was still there and standing silently.
<br><br>
Once the Heavenly Ring Staff was taken away, the Levitation Tower had already served its purpose and would lose its meaning of existence. It also meant that the little girl would disappear over time, though no one knew how much time would elapse before that happened.
<br><br>
"Hey, do you know how to use the Heavenly Ring Staff?" Geoffrey thought of asking the little girl.
<br><br>
But as usual, the little girl just shook her head and said, "I don't know."
<br><br>
"Tch. You know nothing…"
<br><br>
However, Geoffrey's primary goal was only to take the Heavenly Ring Staff to Zen. So, it wasn't really that urgent for him to find an answer on how to use it. "Then, how can I leave this place?" he asked again.
<br><br>
This time, before the little girl could shake her head and tell him that she didn't know, a great force of attraction suddenly rushed out from the staff, extracting a small portion of power from Geoffrey's body.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! A ray of purple light hovered around the Heavenly Ring Staff and directly shot towards the ceiling of the Levitation Tower's top floor.
<br><br>
The moment that the beam of purple light hit the ceiling, it suddenly transformed into something inconceivable.
<br><br>
Earlier, when the different races of the Deep Space, which were at the bottom of the tower, had witnessed that the green light had climbed up to the top floor, they got restless. However, soon after, they saw that the green light suddenly disappeared. Normally, when this light was extinguished, it meant that the creature bearing it had died.
<br><br>
Upon seeing this, most of the members of the Deep Space races let out loud cheers. They thought that if they couldn't get the Heavenly Ring Staff, then they hoped that the Elemental race couldn't obtain it either.
<br><br>
However, among all these savage creatures, a small portion of them was actually disappointed. These creatures didn't want to die in the Levitation Tower. If someone was able to acquire the Heavenly Ring Staff, then it meant that their cruel situation would be over.
<br><br>
It had been a while since the green light was extinguished, and then a ray of purple light suddenly appeared. The top of the Levitation Tower, which originally looked like a chimney, began spreading out. It transformed into a flower-like object that bloomed and expanded in all directions. From it, a burly figure eventually emerged.
<br><br>
Buzz! At this moment, Geoffrey noticed that all the lines on the huge square turned into green.
<br><br>
He looked at the green lines and wondered if it meant that the restrictions on the square had been lifted already.
<br><br>
While pondering on this thought, he jumped from the top of the tower.
<br><br>
After floating in the air for a while, he accurately landed at the door of the oval-shaped building on the far right of the tower.
<br><br>
At that time, the little monster from the Elemental race was also standing at the door of the building. So, when Geoffrey suddenly landed, the monster was instantly stunned as Geoffrey appeared in front of him. For a brief moment, he was in a daze. When he came to his senses, the little monster muttered some indistinguishable words, then bent over and bowed before Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Hey, you don't need to do this." Geoffrey was slightly taken aback by the little monster's sudden actions.
<br><br>
He couldn't help but think that these Deep Space races were indeed simple-minded.
<br><br>
In fact, Elder Xue had persevered in teaching them a lot of things.
<br><br>
However, they still held their beliefs and traditions that the primitive tribes followed. With that, Elder Xue had no choice but to disguise himself as their god, because this was the only way that he could properly and effectively command the Elemental race.
<br><br>
When the members of the different races from the Deep Space saw Geoffrey with the legendary staff in his hand, their stares immediately turned nasty. It was as if they were ready to pounce on him any time.
<br><br>
When they found out that the restrictions on the huge square were already lifted, they rushed towards Geoffrey without any hesitation.
<br><br>
They came from all directions while letting out wild screams and roars.
<br><br>
"Waah! Waah!"
<br><br>
"Goo! Goo! Goo!"
<br><br>
"Grrr! Grrr! Grrr!"
<br><br>
They let out a series of roars, but Geoffrey couldn't understand a single word they were saying. He thought that Elder Xue was so amazing, because he was perhaps the only one who had grasped the languages of all the six large races in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
While he couldn't comprehend the words that they were shouting, Geoffrey could roughly guess what was running in their minds and what they were trying to say.
<br><br>
It must have been some nonsense like "hand over the Heavenly Ring Staff, or we'll kill you". He was pretty sure of that because he could see it on their angry faces.
<br><br>
Upon seeing this, the little monster uttered something and actually stood in front of Geoffrey with a dreadful look on his face. Even in front of all those creatures that were rushing towards them, he was hell-bent on protecting Geoffrey at all costs. However, while Geoffrey deeply appreciated the thought, he stretched out his huge hand, lifted the little monster, and put him aside.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. A lot has changed since I entered the Deep Space. You don't need to protect me anymore."
<br><br>
When Geoffrey obtained the soul power as a reward, he was extremely thrilled. Through that, he had attained a massive boost in his strength, but his physical body was still weak. Now, his physical body had become terrifyingly strong. With his every move, he could feel an enormous force surging from within his body. He actually couldn't wait to test out his newly-acquired strength.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Geoffrey then swiftly waved the Heavenly Ring Staff and pointed it at the members of the Deep Space races.
<br><br>
As the creatures continued dashing towards Geoffrey, the three Cold Apes were the first ones to launch their attacks through their agile movements.
<br><br>
Although these creatures possessed low intelligence, their strength, bloodlust, and experience in battle couldn't be underestimated. Since they were natives of the Deep Space, it could be said that their physical talent was still far greater than that of the creatures of the main world and the chaos.
<br><br>
However, strictly speaking, Geoffrey was now a member of the Fostering race—not only an ordinary one, but actually a top master.
<br><br>
Although the movements of the Cold Apes were too fast to be tracked by ordinary warriors, before Geoffrey's eyes, they were extremely slow.
<br><br>
He lifted the Heavenly Ring Staff, and rushed towards the Cold Apes.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! With a tremendous gap in speed and strength, Geoffrey didn't even need to use any special skill to bring down his opponents.
<br><br>
The fight had ended even before the Cold Apes realized what had happened. They didn't know what hit them, but they just felt very dizzy as if their world was spinning furiously. They also felt a severe pain on their backs as if a massive force smashed them. Consequently, they immediately fell on the ground, unable to move even an inch.
<br><br>
All of the other creatures who witnessed this immediately stopped on their tracks.
<br><br>
The truth was Geoffrey even held back most of his strength in fear that he might damage the Heavenly Ring Staff. If he didn't hold back, there was no way that these Cold Apes lying on the ground were still alive.
<br><br>
"I know you're not stupid enough to court death upon seeing what I could do, right?" Geoffrey glared at the creatures in front of him as he said this.
<br><br>
They might not understand what he exactly said, but he knew that through his actions, he was able to clearly relay his message.
<br><br>
When every member of these races saw the pitiful state of the mighty Cold Apes, they eventually stepped back and lost their resolve to fight.
<br><br>
Just from the look in Geoffrey's eyes, they could sense an intimidating aura that would crush them the moment that they dared to go against him.
<br><br>
"Let's go! We're finished here."
<br><br>
Geoffrey turned around and threw the little monster on his back. With a huge leap, he instantly flew out of the square.
<br><br>
After passing the periphery of the huge square, Geoffrey looked into the distance and discovered that he was currently at the center of the Sky Wheel City.
<br><br>
Previously, the spiders had carried him from the underground space all the way up to the spiral stairs.
<br><br>
"Purr! Purr!"
<br><br>
The little monster made some excited sounds as he pointed at a particular direction from Geoffrey's back.
<br><br>
Although Geoffrey couldn't smoothly communicate with him, he kind of knew that he was pointing to the direction of the Elemental race.
<br><br>
After flying quite a distance towards the southwestern part of the Sky Wheel City, Geoffrey observed that there were huge chunks of strata floating in the sky, each of which was about a hundred miles in diameter.
<br><br>
He concluded that these giant strata must have been a part of a huge continent before.
<br><br>
With the guidance from the little monster, Geoffrey flew towards one of the floating giant strata.
<br><br>
However, even before he could get close, the little monster let out successive shrieks. Alarmed by the reaction of the little monster, Geoffrey looked around and quickly saw that there were black smoke pillars rising at the center of the massive stratum.

<br><br>
Spots in the Deep Space such as this were constructed quite simply and crudely, keeping with the forms of a primitive tribe. Elder Xue had introduced some unique construction techniques to the Elemental race and helped them build an exquisite city. However, it had been decimated.
<br><br>
The Deep Space races present in the huge square had their ways of spreading news.
<br><br>
In fact, they had already done so when the Elemental race had climbed up to two hundred feet in the Levitation Tower. They hoped Elder Xue would decipher the mysteries of the Levitation Tower, but also wanted all the information they could get from him. This made it very difficult for them to correctly choose their time of attack on the Elemental race.
<br><br>
As the Deep Space races hesitated, waiting for their opportunity, Elder Xue and Geoffrey entered the tower and reached a height of two hundred feet. News of this mobilized them. No matter how unintelligent they were, they knew they would have to make a move as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Before Geoffrey had gotten to the top of the Levitation Tower, the five races had already set off to attack the Elemental race.
<br><br>
At the center of the gathering place was a wooden pavilion with a narrow underground passage beneath it. In the innermost secret basement, sat the white-haired Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Bang, bang, Bang...
<br><br>
A muffled sound could be heard from above.
<br><br>
"What is that... noise?" Elder Xue asked.
<br><br>
He was still a fourth-grade creature in nature. Although he had been in the Deep Space for a long time, he was limited to his own life level, and his understanding and awareness of his surroundings was still very unrefined.
<br><br>
He heard the huge muffled sound, but was unable to tell its direction.
<br><br>
A man of the Elemental race in a red robe said shakily, "Elder Xue... They are attacking the pavilion..."
<br><br>
Elder Xue sat motionless and murmured, "So soon?"
<br><br>
Truthfully, he had a feeling this day would come when he planned to go to the Levitation Tower with Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, I'll get you out through the tunnel!" yelled that man of the Elemental race.
<br><br>
Elder Xue had built a complicated system of tunnels below the ground to make it more convenient for the Elemental race to escape.
<br><br>
"Alright!"
<br><br>
Elder Xue nodded.
<br><br>
He was not afraid of death, but after the precious body had died, all his hopes rested on Geoffrey. No matter what, before he died, he wanted to know whether Geoffrey was capable of obtaining the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
He refused to die before seeing Geoffrey again.
<br><br>
The man carried Elder Xue on his back, pushed open the door of the secret room and made his way towards the other end of the passageway.
<br><br>
He had only taken a couple steps when a long spear shot at him.
<br><br>
Puff! Before he could react, he was impaled to the wall of the passageway and Elder Xue was thrown to the ground.
<br><br>
"Who is here?"
<br><br>
Elder Xue stood up with a wobble, trying to distinguish what lay before him.
<br><br>
All he could make out were circles of various sizes. With a little bit more time he was able to slowly understand the meaning behind them. Not far away was a golden-haired Cold Ape who had lurked in from the other side of the passageway.
<br><br>
"The Cold Ape race has always regarded you as an esteemed guest. We're much better than these members of the Elemental race. Why are you trying to escape, Elder Xue?" asked the golden-haired Cold Ape.
<br><br>
Elder Xue pretended not to understand and made an attempt to leave.
<br><br>
But the golden-haired Cold Ape sneered and lifted him up. With a slight snort, a layer of black light covered his body and he then took Elder Xue towards the ground above.
<br><br>
Once he stood on the surface of the ground, he held Elder Xue and roared, "Everyone, stop!"
<br><br>
The members of the Elemental race continued struggling, giving all they had. They had been forced to retreat, yet they remained in high spirits. But seeing Elder Xue captured stunned them.
<br><br>
The other races of the Deep Space frothed at the mouth in greed when they saw Elder Xue.
<br><br>
The news that Geoffrey had reached the top of the Levitation Tower had not yet reached them. They just wanted the information about the Levitation Tower from Elder Xue.
<br><br>
"We have nothing against the Elemental race. As long as you are willing to tell us the secrets of the Levitation Tower, our five races will leave, okay?" said the golden-haired Cold Ape menacingly.
<br><br>
"The Wrona race agrees!"
<br><br>
"So do we..."
<br><br>
"I agree!"
<br><br>
Each race echoed the last.
<br><br>
The Cold Ape placed Elder Xue in front of him and said one word at a time, "I know you know our language. Do not pretend you don't. If you don't tell us what we want to know, we will kill the entire Elemental race!"
<br><br>
This was a seriously deadly threat. Elder Xue had established and developed a deep relationship with the Elemental race.
<br><br>
It was not that he was unwilling to reveal anything about the Levitation Tower, but by the rules of the tower, these wild races were unqualified to reach a height of two hundred feet in it! He hesitated for a moment and the golden-haired Cold Ape ran a finger across his own neck, gesturing the cutting of a throat. "Kill them all!"
<br><br>
They were about to resume the slaughter...
<br><br>
"Wait!"
<br><br>
Elder Xue called out. He then said, in a language he was clearly unskilled in, "After reaching two hundred feet of the Levitation Tower, you only need to answer some questions..."
<br><br>
All he could do was to tell the truth.
<br><br>
But he knew that once he told them what he knew, he and those of the Elemental race would be killed.
<br><br>
As he spoke, he tried formulating a plan to get out of this situation. In all his years, he had never encountered such passivity among so many enemies. After all, these Deep Space races also had gripes and issues with each other and would not join hands to attack the Elemental race.
<br><br>
He genuinely had no way to deal with his current predicament.
<br><br>
He was in despair and had almost lost all hope when he suddenly felt a powerful wave.
<br><br>
If Elder Xue could feel the energy, these Deep Space races could feel it much clearer. They sensed a powerful wave of energy coming from the sky. By the time they saw it clearly, it was only a hundred feet away from the golden-haired Cold Ape.
<br><br>
The golden-haired Cold Ape sensed that something was wrong and was about to run, but it was too late.
<br><br>
Boom! Geoffrey's burly body plummeted like a mountain, smashing the goldenhaired Cold Ape into the soil.
<br><br>
Everything else in Elder Xue's eyes were made up of rings, but he saw Geoffrey as clear as day.
<br><br>
A huge sense of relief washed over him when he saw Geoffrey and the Heavenly Ring Staff in his hand. "What... What are you doing here? You should go back to the chaos to find Master Kincaid..."
<br><br>
"I can't find a way back," Geoffrey said with a smile.
<br><br>
"But it's too dangerous here. You shouldn't have come," insisted Elder Xue.
<br><br>
"That's not an issue!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey bellowed with a confident grin.
<br><br>
He grabbed the Heavenly Ring Staff and slammed it into the ground twice. His own power began to drain rapidly and was absorbed by the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
He had discovered this ability of the Heavenly Ring Staff when he was at the top of the Levitation Tower. The staff needed to absorb power to be a help to him.
<br><br>
The staff had taken a lot of his power this time. His limbs felt weak and the Heavenly Ring Staff then released an intense pressure that swept through almost everything. The members of the Elemental race and the other races then felt as if their legs had been filled with lead. They all collapsed face first into the ground, unable to get up again.
<br><br>
Chapter 4258 Return Geoffrey had the physique and soul of a powerful warrior but his theurgy was still limited to the Godly Ways of the chaos.
<br><br>
He had never mastered the power of the main world and the Deep Space.
<br><br>
He had no idea what kind of theurgy the Heavenly Ring Staff possessed.
<br><br>
He was shocked to see everyone around him get knocked to the floor by the strong force it was emanating.
<br><br>
"Stop! Let the members of the Elemental race go!" Geoffrey sputtered.
<br><br>
At this, the Heavenly Ring Staff trembled slightly. The members of the Elemental race who had been brought to the floor felt the pressure ease off them. They quickly scrambled to get back up.
<br><br>
As soon as they were back on their feet, they swarmed around Geoffrey and Elder Xue.
<br><br>
They knelt in front of them and bowed again and again in reverence.
<br><br>
They considered Elder Xue as a sage and a god to be venerated. It was a kind of blasphemy for the golden-haired Cold Apes to have held him hostage! But Geoffrey defeated those heretics, so he must be a stronger sage and a more powerful god than Elder Xue himself! Geoffrey shifted uncomfortably watching the people kowtow to him.
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, please tell them not to bow and scrape like that. It makes me feel so bad."
<br><br>
Elder Xue smiled helplessly. "I can't. The Elemental race is still a primitive race. Faith is quite important to them. I can help them keep the faith, but snapping them out of it is another matter entirely."
<br><br>
Elder Xue then turned and said something to the Elemental race. As one, they got up and began charging at the outsiders.
<br><br>
The members of the Elemental race showed no mercy to those who had attacked Elder Xue. They slaughtered them all. The area was left awash in blood.
<br><br>
Four hours later, in an exquisite wooden hall, Geoffrey began to discuss returning back home with Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Geoffrey actually knew the way back, but he had come here to send the little monster home and try to bring Elder Xue back.
<br><br>
However, Elder Xue only shook his head at his proposition. "I'm afraid that's not possible."
<br><br>
"Why?" Geoffrey asked, puzzled.
<br><br>
Elder Xue looked surprised. "Don't you know? After the catastrophe with the Four Spirits Sect, no one from the main world could return. If they do, they will die."
<br><br>
This was also the case in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
In the decisive battle between the Fostering race and the Cinnabar race, some members had managed to escape. It was unknown whether they were still alive, but rules had been imposed then that they would never be able to return.
<br><br>
That was why when Kincaid in the chaos heard that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had seen Elder Xue, he had correctly estimated that Elder Xue was still living in the Deep Space. He couldn't have broken the restriction. It would have been impossible for him to cross the main world and then go straight to the chaos.
<br><br>
"So I'm really going back alone?" a disappointed Geoffrey said.
<br><br>
"Yes. The top priority is to bring back the Heavenly Ring Staff. The sooner, the better," Elder Xue said firmly.
<br><br>
"But those races in the Deep Space will definitely seek revenge on you.
<br><br>
You might be in danger, Elder Xue," Geoffrey pleaded.
<br><br>
Elder Xue smiled. "You have the Heavenly Ring Staff. It's strong enough to control the life and death of all the inhabitants in the Deep Space. They couldn't take revenge on me if they try."
<br><br>
He knew Elder Xue was probably right, but Geoffrey still couldn't help but feel uneasy. He turned to speak to the Heavenly Ring Staff, "I need some guards to protect him."
<br><br>
The Heavenly Ring Staff extracted Geoffrey's power again.
<br><br>
Rumble! The ground trembled and splintered. Over a thousand human-shaped statues crawled out.
<br><br>
Geoffrey nodded in approval at these guards created by the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
Witnessing what looked like a miracle to them, the members of the Elemental race began to fall all over themselves to praise Geoffrey again.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before Geoffrey had to bid goodbye and start his journey back.
<br><br>
He left the broken ground and returned to the Sky Wheel City. From the center of the city, he went northward to the most remote point. He passed the passageway and made his way back to the secret circular room he had come from before.
<br><br>
He activated the transmission array here. The beams of light started shooting into his body, engulfing him bit by bit from head to foot.
<br><br>
His body began to disappear in parts until it completely vanished from the spot.
<br><br>
In the next moment, Geoffrey found himself in the diamond-shaped array above the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
He gathered his bearings momentarily, looked around, and then jumped down.
<br><br>
Whoosh! It had taken Geoffrey several months to climb up the pillar, but now that he could fly with the help of the Heavenly Ring Staff, his descent was much quicker.
<br><br>
He had left Ziya at the foot of the pillar, so he went to meet him first.
<br><br>
Whoosh! When Geoffrey was a hundred feet high above the ground, he turned and flew toward the nearest secondary world.
<br><br>
At that moment in the secondary world, Ziya was hard at work piecing together a statue.
<br><br>
It had been such a long time since Geoffrey had left, and he had yet to hear from him. He couldn't help but fear he had met a terrible fate.
<br><br>
But Ziya never gave up easily.
<br><br>
He had once been exiled into the Deleting Space, but even then, he had remained steadfast. In the end, he had not only successfully controlled the Deleting Space, but had also drilled a hole right through the chaos.
<br><br>
He refused to leave the secondary world without Geoffrey. After all, without him, he wouldn't have even been able to climb up the pillar, let alone go back to the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
He focused his attention on the statue he was working on. The statue made by the Four Spirits Sect could freely walk around the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He thought if he could control it, perhaps he could leave bit by bit.
<br><br>
However, he soon found that the way the Four Spirits Sect created the statue was quite complex. It took Ziya a long time to repair even a small broken part of it. It occurred to him it would probably take him dozens of years to finish repairing it.
<br><br>
But if he had been able to survive many chaotic eras in the Deleting Space, a few decades here were nothing.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The sound broke into Ziya's reveries.
<br><br>
He snapped his head up and saw a figure flying in. It was Geoffrey carrying a wooden staff! Ziya let out a series of expletives and burst into laughter.
<br><br>
He had lived for over a thousand chaotic eras, but he was still as exuberant as before.
<br><br>
"Master Ziya, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting," Geoffrey greeted with a smile.
<br><br>
"What took you so long? I was beginning to think you had died! Were you able to reach the top of the pillar?" Ziya asked.
<br><br>
He had been isolated here for some time and so knew nothing about what happened in the chaos.
<br><br>
"I did, but..." Geoffrey began.
<br><br>
"Did you find anything there?" Ziya pressed on eagerly. He knew how valuable the Other Shore Tokens at the top of the pillar were.
<br><br>
"Yes, I have, but..." Geoffrey said slowly.
<br><br>
"But what?" Ziya asked.
<br><br>
Geoffrey let out a deep breath. "It's not what you might expect. A lot of things have happened."
<br><br>
Chapter 4259 Meeting Ziya was obviously confused. "What do you mean by 'a lot of things'? Can you please explain to me what happened?"
<br><br>
It was a long story. Geoffrey thought for a moment. Ultimately, he said, "My father brought those human heroes to the Jade Pure Realm."
<br><br>
Naturally, Ziya was taken aback. "What? They attacked the Element Spirit Civilization?"
<br><br>
"No. Actually, they fought some people who were even stronger than the whole Element Spirit Civilization."
<br><br>
Afterward, Geoffrey told Ziya everything he knew about what had happened in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
"So what you're saying is, my master... He is dead?" Ziya was thoroughly stunned by this news. It was like a wave of sadness suddenly washed over him.
<br><br>
Geoffrey looked somber. "Yes. I've heard that the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others died. However, they left their souls behind."
<br><br>
"Well, then what do we do now? Moreover, what's happened to you?"
<br><br>
Ziya asked as he stared at Geoffrey.
<br><br>
At that moment, Geoffrey's body had already expanded several times.
<br><br>
Somehow, it made him look like a small giant. He emitted such a powerful and mysterious aura that it made Ziya a little scared. Even with Ziya's broad knowledge, it was still difficult for him to imagine what Geoffrey had experienced.
<br><br>
"Now, this is actually related to the task assigned to me by the Human Spirit King. He asked me to go to the Deep Space..."
<br><br>
So, Geoffrey told Ziya that he had explored the pillar. He went into the Deep Space to fetch the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
He proceeded to inform Ziya about the details of the matter. It alleviated Ziya's grief a little. At the same time, he also realized that the wooden staff in Geoffrey's hand was an extraordinary magical object.
<br><br>
"You said that the Heavenly Ring Staff is omnipotent, right? Can you transform me into a creature of the Abstruse Energy World?" Ziya just had to ask if this was possible.
<br><br>
Even though he studied the Abstruse Energy World for a long time, Ziya had never been able to fully explore it.
<br><br>
"Well, we'll see... Let's give it a try, shall we? Maybe the Heavenly Ring Staff can perform the Soul Reincarnation."
<br><br>
The Levitation Tower was capable of releasing the Soul Reincarnation.
<br><br>
Thus, the Heavenly Ring Staff might be able to do the same.
<br><br>
"What is the Soul Reincarnation?" This greatly piqued Ziya's curiosity.
<br><br>
With that, a smile appeared on Geoffrey's face. "You'll know soon. Trust me."
<br><br>
Soon enough, he felt like the Heavenly Ring Staff was drawing his strength.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, they heard a splashing sound.
<br><br>
It released an invisible force to envelop Ziya.
<br><br>
The next moment, Ziya was feeling sharp pain all over his body. It began to expand infinitely. The pain was almost unbearable.
<br><br>
Truth be told, Geoffrey was worried about Ziya. He thought that maybe he wouldn't be able to tolerate the pain. After all, the Soul Reincarnation was pretty risky.
<br><br>
On second thought, Ziya was much stronger than those savage races in the Deep Space even though he was a creature of the third-grade world. It shouldn't be difficult for him to undergo one Soul Reincarnation.
<br><br>
The pain lasted for quite some time. Slowly, Ziya opened his eyes. He was in the secondary world. Therefore, he didn't notice any difference.
<br><br>
"Wait, what is this? Did it really have to hurt like that?" Ziya asked as he tried to move his body.
<br><br>
"Just follow me," Geoffrey replied with a smile on his face. He was right that Ziya could tolerate the process.
<br><br>
When he saw Geoffrey walking out of the secondary world, he immediately picked up the rope on the ground. He was afraid to get lost in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Just as he stepped into the Abstruse Energy World, the dots of light everywhere suddenly disappeared. They were replaced by an open, complete, and huge world.
<br><br>
"So this is what the Soul Reincarnation is..."
<br><br>
"Yes. It helped you become a creature of the Abstruse Energy World. If your soul is strong enough, you can even become a creature of the Deep Space," Geoffrey responded.
<br><br>
Naturally, Ziya was quite ecstatic now. After all, he had studied this world for countless eras. And now, he could finally move freely in it. He was like a child who just learned how to run freely.
<br><br>
If he had enough time, Ziya was more than willing to stay in the Abstruse Energy World for a longer period of time.
<br><br>
However, Geoffrey said that the situation in the chaos was very critical.
<br><br>
They couldn't waste a single moment in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a lot of things were also happening in the chaos.
<br><br>
In the Pear Hill, Elizabeth of the Sun Crow race looked rather bored. She had been staring at the distant blood-colored sky for quite some time now.
<br><br>
She had successfully guided Pompeo in taking over the Blooming Jade Stage. Since then, she had rarely left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was very interesting for her to manage the Blooming Jade Stage. After all, she was a predominating ruler there. No one dared to disobey her. So this made her feel like she once did when she was the head of the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
However, she didn't expect that disaster would strike so suddenly. Those destructive energy balls could devour everything.
<br><br>
Elizabeth was able to escape the Other Shore to avoid the catastrophe.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Pompeo was not. This giant creature from the fourth-grade world could only watch the energy balls raining down.
<br><br>
As soon as Elizabeth returned to the Blooming Jade Stage, she saw a huge crater. More than half of the Blooming Jade Stage had been devoured.
<br><br>
Even the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been destroyed.
<br><br>
She didn't have any choice. She couldn't stay on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Therefore, she decided to return to the Pear Hill and just watch the primitive land expand rapidly and grow even stronger.
<br><br>
The primitive land expanded really fast. It exceeded everyone's expectations. Even Zen didn't foresee that it would develop this quickly.
<br><br>
The larger the size of the primitive land was, the faster it would devour the heads. Its expansion speed increased exponentially.
<br><br>
Compared to the primitive land, the once enormous Pear Hill was like a lonely sailboat on the vast ocean.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen was sitting cross legged with his eyes closed on the jadeite platform. He was trying to assess the chaos from the perspective of the primitive land.
<br><br>
"The Source World is not getting any closer. It's actually beginning to move towards the exact opposite direction," Zen stated. His eyes remained closed.
<br><br>
When they heard this news, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the Chaos Ancient Gods felt thoroughly relieved.
<br><br>
A few days ago, the Source World suddenly appeared. Naturally, it made everyone nervous.
<br><br>
They knew the Evil God too well. He was much too difficult to deal with.
<br><br>
If he decided to target them, they would undoubtedly encounter a huge trouble. They would be seriously injured, if not dead.
<br><br>
The primitive land was not how it used to be. It had expanded even larger than the developed Source World. Nevertheless, this was not the right time to fight.
<br><br>
Everyone was starting to relax when Zen continued, "The Source World released a flying ship."
<br><br>
The flying ship was the size of a grain of sand compared to the current Source World. Yet, Zen's keen eyes noticed it immediately.
<br><br>
"What? A flying ship?" The Snake Goddess looked at Zen.
<br><br>
"Allow me to intercept it," said Fuxi.
<br><br>
"We can nevet let the Evil God step foot on the primitive land. Otherwise, we will have a huge problem!"
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Kendrick, and Gerald wanted to make a move.
<br><br>
However, Zen shook his head. "You don't need to do anything. My incarnation can now leave the primitive land by will. I'll be the one to go,"
<br><br>
he said.
<br><br>
It didn't matter what the Evil God was planning to do. At most, Zen would only lose an incarnation. This was the safest plan. Realizing that, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others no longer insisted.
<br><br>
After they settled on the plan, Zen summoned an incarnation to appear on the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The next moment, his incarnation appeared outside the primitive land on a flying ship. It merely floated in the empty chaos.
<br><br>
The distance between the Source World and the primitive land seemed really close. But in reality, they were quite far away from each other. It would take the two flying ships two days of travelling at a great speed before they met.
<br><br>
But still, they were slowly getting closer.
<br><br>
Zen stood on the flying ship and peered into the other one. The enchanted barrier at the top of the ship opened, and a black figure shot out of it and floated in the void. He looked at Zen and laughed wildly. It was none other than the Evil God.
<br><br>
Chapter 4260 Stasis Extreme Form Zen just kept quiet as he waited for the Evil God to finish his shrilling laughter.
<br><br>
"I'm really happy that you're still alive," the Evil God said as he looked at Zen's huge primitive land in the distance. "You have such a huge primitive land, huh? Is that the world where I used to live?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen replied with a nod.
<br><br>
"Are my children still there?" the Evil God asked casually.
<br><br>
"Yes. They're still top masters of that continent," Zen answered.
<br><br>
When the Evil God heard this, a strange smile suddenly appeared on his face. "So, are you planning to use them to threaten me?"
<br><br>
Zen frowned and scoffed slightly, "You know what kind of person I am.
<br><br>
Furthermore, I know your nature. I wouldn't waste my time doing such meaningless things. Just tell me what you want to do."
<br><br>
Of course, Zen wouldn't even think of doing such a detestable thing. He also knew that with the twisted personality of the Evil God, even if he used the important people in the life of the Evil God to threaten him, it wouldn't affect him at all.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! So straightforward." The Evil God laughed awkwardly and pointed downwards. "Down there. That's where our common enemy is!"
<br><br>
He was actually pointing towards the vast chaos.
<br><br>
Without the chaos clouds covering the area, it was just an empty space.
<br><br>
Occasionally, there would be some heads wandering around that must have escaped from being devoured.
<br><br>
"Common enemy? Who are you talking about?" Zen was quite confused with the Evil God's statement.
<br><br>
"Who? The Snake Spirit King and the downgrader behind him of course,"
<br><br>
the Evil God replied with a grin. "They have created an immense primitive land that looks like a huge pyramid. Currently, it is already bigger than mine, and of course, much bigger than yours!"
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the process of the primitive lands in devouring the heads could be likened to rolling a snowball.
<br><br>
Originally, the Source World should have the most advantage, because it had the largest size. Thus, its efficiency in devouring the heads was far greater than the other two competitors.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God was so late in understanding the meaning of the downgrade and also didn't know how to deal with the overwhelming heads that suddenly appeared in the Source World. In fact, before he came up with a solution, a lot of parts of the Source World were already devoured by them.
<br><br>
When the Evil God had finished dealing with the trouble in the Source World, Zen's primitive land and the pyramid-like primitive land had already caught up in terms of size. Thus, even though the Source World was originally the largest, it was now left behind.
<br><br>
"The huge pyramid…" Zen stared at the void with a worried expression in his eyes.
<br><br>
"Now, if you want to deal with it, I suggest that we better join hands. It'll be easier that way," the Evil God recommended.
<br><br>
Previously, when Zen led the Monkey Spirit Sect to the Jade Pure Realm, he deemed it necessary to form a temporary alliance with the Bird Spirit Sect. In this current situation, it seemed reasonable for him to join hands with the Evil God who controlled the Source World, but he was quite hesitant.
<br><br>
He thought that the Evil God was much harder to deal with than the Bird Masters. So, he couldn't help but smirk and ask, "Join hands? How are we going to do that?"
<br><br>
"We join our forces. We will integrate your primitive land with my Source World," the Evil God said indifferently.
<br><br>
Zen was again quite baffled with what the Evil God said. "Can primitive lands merge together?"
<br><br>
"Yes, it's simple. We'll just let my Source World devour your primitive land," the Evil God said it like it was common knowledge.
<br><br>
"Why do you think I should agree to that?"
<br><br>
Zen's expression started to become serious. At the back of his mind, he kind of knew that it was how it was done, but a trace of anger still surfaced from his heart.
<br><br>
As the Evil God noticed Zen's faint anger, a condescending smile appeared on his face. "Isn't it obvious? It's because I'm stronger than you."
<br><br>
"Oh? What makes you think so?" Zen's eyebrow slightly raised as his expression became colder.
<br><br>
"Well, we can test it out if you want," the Evil God continued to provoke Zen with a sinister smile.
<br><br>
Without waiting for Zen's response, he suddenly bent a finger and a colorful light flashed from his fingertip.
<br><br>
It turned out to be the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
As the Evil God gently flicked his finger, the ray of light swiftly shot towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Facing the sudden attack, Zen wasn't fazed at all.
<br><br>
Just before the ray of light hit him, his body became blurry and completely disappeared.
<br><br>
The colorful light that missed its target hit the flying ship from afar and instantly turned into a dazzling white energy ball. The entire ship was annihilated, and not a piece of debris could be found.
<br><br>
The Evil God didn't even need to use his eyes when he fought. With a wave of his hands, a long whip formed from the Ways-blending Energy spread out from his fingers and lashed violently at the void.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen's figure kept moving in the space. After dodging several attacks from the whip, he seized the right chance and grabbed it with his bare hand.
<br><br>
"Explode!" the Evil God shouted.
<br><br>
The long whip instantly turned into a blazing white ball of light and enveloped Zen.
<br><br>
However, before the ball of light continued to expand, it suddenly shrank at an incredible rate and fully dissipated.
<br><br>
As Zen's image emerged, he said, "Although the Ways-blending Energy is strong, it is still the power of a third-grade world. This is your innate limitation."
<br><br>
"Ha, are you sure about that?"
<br><br>
The Evil God showed a defiant grin and quickly dashed towards Zen.
<br><br>
He raised his hand and suddenly brandished a long whip again. However, this time, the whip was not formed through the Ways-blending Energy, but by three energies that emanated green, black, and red lights.
<br><br>
Zen calmly grasped the end of the whip again and analyzed the energies that were flowing in it.
<br><br>
But as soon as he realized the source of the energies, the corners of his eyes twitched slightly.
<br><br>
'These energies… They are bloodline powers.
<br><br>
They are from the fourth-grade world.
<br><br>
And there are actually nineteen kinds of them?' Dealing with nineteen kinds of bloodline powers was still actually a piece of cake for Zen, but he was still surprised that the Evil God could actually handle and master them. After Zen analyzed it, a faint yellow energy surfaced from his fingers. The yellow energy wrapped around the tricolored whip, like a spider web, and rapidly disintegrated it.
<br><br>
The Evil God didn't just stand idly. He then waved his hand, releasing a surge of brown ripples from his palm. As the brown ripples came in contact with the yellow energy, they instantly devoured the energy until not a single trace was left.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the capability of the brown ripples, Zen was actually shocked.
<br><br>
It was not that big of a deal to use several kinds of bloodline powers simultaneously. However, the difficult thing to do was to quickly analyze the bloodline powers contained in a weapon or skill and then find out the corresponding energy that could restrain them. Originally, Zen thought that he was the only one who could do that. If the Evil God could also do the same, he started to think if the Evil God had also mastered all the bloodline powers.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! As the brown ripples were hurled directly towards Zen, he pointed his finger at them, unleashing thin bolts of lightning that instantly disintegrated the brown ripples. These bolts of lightning also charged towards the Evil God at an astonishing speed.
<br><br>
The two of them released all kinds of blood powers to restrain each other.
<br><br>
They exchanged blows and skillfully countered everything that was thrown against both sides.
<br><br>
After several rounds, the Evil God got a little bored because no one was getting the upper hand. "You're right. The innate limitation is the most horrible thing. So, I've been studying how to break out of it. Yes, three hundred and seventy-three bloodline powers are undoubtedly strong, but it's still not enough…"
<br><br>
Upon saying that, he drew a circle in the air using his other hand, and a white hexagonal snowflake emerged from the circle.
<br><br>
After its formation, the Evil God knocked on the hexagonal snowflake.
<br><br>
Crack! Just with that gentle knock, the snowflake shattered.
<br><br>
Soon after, every part of it dissipated in the air.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Zen couldn't shake the feeling that something dangerous was about to happen.
<br><br>
The next moment, the figure of the Evil God also disappeared, but his voice could still be heard.
<br><br>
"If I want to, I can kill you a thousand times or even ten thousand times.
<br><br>
I can put you in an illusion that time is frozen.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, you won't comprehend the beauty of this state. You'll only feel bemused.
<br><br>
How pitiful you are."
<br><br>
Zen felt a little weird as he heard that the sentences of the Evil God were overlapping. It was as if he was speaking them at the same time.
<br><br>
When he finished speaking, the Evil God suddenly appeared in front of Zen, and also behind him, and even at both his sides.
<br><br>
Then, the Evil God stopped about one foot away from him, and said, "This is the Stasis Extreme Form."
<br><br>
Chapter 4261 Warning Under the influence of the Stasis Extreme Form, Zen wasn't able to think straight.
<br><br>
He heard the words of the Evil God, but he couldn't fully comprehend them.
<br><br>
After a while, the Evil God stretched out his hand and drew a circle again in the air. Then, the hexagonal snowflake that was broken and spread out earlier gradually emerged and reorganized into the circle. As it was completely restored, Zen was able to return to normal.
<br><br>
The moment he came back to his senses, the Evil God's words from before drilled into his mind. At the same time, he noticed that the Evil God was now approaching him.
<br><br>
"Stasis Extreme Form?"
<br><br>
Zen's expression changed drastically as he realized how dreadful the skill was.
<br><br>
He was wondering why the ancestry-level bloodline couldn't restrain its power. Never did he expect that the Evil God would be able to use the power of the Deep Space.
<br><br>
The Evil God didn't say anything and just looked at him with a playful smile. He was enjoying this moment when he could clearly see the bewilderment on Zen's face.
<br><br>
He remembered Zen once told him that there was a much wider world outside. He thought that he must probably have the same flabbergasted expression on his face. But now, it was Zen's turn to experience it.
<br><br>
"How did you obtain such a level of power?" Zen couldn't help but ask him without hesitation.
<br><br>
The Evil God fiddled with the hexagonal snowflake and asked teasingly, "Do you want to know?"
<br><br>
"Of course," Zen replied quickly.
<br><br>
"Join us, and I'll tell you," the Evil God said with a conniving smile.
<br><br>
"Forget it then," Zen answered sternly.
<br><br>
Upon hearing his immediate reply, the Evil God placed the hexagonal snowflake in front of Zen. He wasn't willing to take no for an answer that quickly. "I heard that you have fought with the downgrader. You should know by now what kind of power he possesses. If you can't even resist my power, then you definitely have no chance against him. Even if you rely on your primitive land, nothing would change. You will die with everyone. But if you follow me, I can save you! I can save everyone around you!"
<br><br>
Zen couldn't understand where the fanaticism in the eyes of the Evil God was coming from. It was as if saving him meant saving the whole world.
<br><br>
However, Zen just dismissed him by saying, "I don't need you to save me."
<br><br>
After deeming that they had nothing more to talk about, Zen turned around and was ready to leave. The flying ship that he used was destroyed by the Evil God earlier, so he needed the Grand Teleportation skill to return to the primitive land.
<br><br>
However, just when he was about to enter the space channel, the Evil God swiftly grabbed and crushed it, preventing Zen from leaving. "Aren't you afraid of death?!" the Evil God yelled through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
"Why should I be afraid?" Zen retorted with a cold stare.
<br><br>
"Then tell me, what is the meaning of my existence?" This time, it seemed that the Evil God was discombobulated.
<br><br>
Zen felt a little confused as he saw the strange expression on the Evil God's face.
<br><br>
"I have all his memories, and all my talents and power are here to serve him. But I'm still who I am! Isn't that weird? Is this just the entire meaning of my life?" the Evil God asked with a gloomy expression.
<br><br>
At this moment, Zen and the Evil God were just avatars of their real selves. However, Zen's avatar was fully connected to his real self, while the Evil God's avatar possessed his own train of thoughts. He could move and think independently from the will of his real self.
<br><br>
"I can't answer that for you. You'll have to ask the Evil God," Zen said as he shrugged his shoulders.
<br><br>
"Then let me go with you! I don't want to go back and act like a mere slave. Besides, I can teach you how to transform power into a higher level!" the Evil God roared in a desperate tone.
<br><br>
Then, Zen looked at the Evil God intently. He couldn't believe that this avatar could act this way. He found that this avatar of the Evil God was a bit too emotional.
<br><br>
It was actually a good thing because he could make use of him.
<br><br>
But just as Zen made his decision to let the avatar go with him, an unknown black spiral suddenly pierced through the void.
<br><br>
This black spiral then transformed into a massive spear that was over ten thousand feet long. Moreover, it turned out that its target was the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God quickly sensed the danger that it brought. He immediately lifted the hexagonal snowflake in his hand and pointed it towards the black spear. The snowflake was already about to break, but the black spear was unimaginably faster.
<br><br>
Whoosh! With a muffled sound, the Evil God's head was suddenly pierced by the black spear, and his life energy was extracted by it to the point that he became like a dried-up mummy.
<br><br>
"It's really quite troublesome to deal with these traitors.
<br><br>
All of them want to rebel. Don't they know that I have a lot of things on my plate too? By the way, before dealing with the downgrader, I won't do anything to your primitive land. So, I hope you'd do the same to the Source World."
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Zen immediately knew that it was the real Evil God speaking.
<br><br>
Before Zen could even say anything, the dried-up body of the Evil God's avatar continued to shrink as cracks appeared all over his skin. Then, he was reduced to ashes that scattered throughout the void. At the same time, the enormous black spear also vanished without a trace.
<br><br>
As Zen returned to his primitive land, he told everyone what had happened and what he learned.
<br><br>
Naturally, the people on the jadeite platform were all shocked.
<br><br>
"Are you serious? You mean to say that someone was able to comprehend the power of the Deep Space?" Even Kincaid had a strong expression of disbelief.
<br><br>
"The aura of the power he displayed was very familiar. It was similar to the energy that was being exhibited by that heavy sword. It was also too powerful that I wasn't able to resist," Zen explained.
<br><br>
"But there might be another explanation. Maybe it was some kind of blended bloodline?" Kincaid tried to argue.
<br><br>
"But he has the complete abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline," Zen added. "He could dissolve and counter any power of the ancestry-level bloodline that I used."
<br><br>
"How could that happen? Why could he obtain so many bloodline powers?"
<br><br>
"That's inconceivable. He doesn't even have the ancestry-level bloodline."
<br><br>
"That's right. He only relies on the Ways-blending Energy."
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess also shared their sentiments and perplexity.
<br><br>
However, something caught Kincaid's attention. When he heard them say that the Evil God was using the Ways-blending Energy, he immediately asked, "Did he fuse all the Godly Ways by himself?"
<br><br>
"Yes. He boasts an extraordinary talent in that area." Right after Zen answered Kincaid's question, his expression suddenly changed as if he began to realize why Kincaid asked about it. His eyes kind of widened as he said, "We know that the lower-grade worlds can't be transformed into higher-grade ones. But can the energy and power from lower-grade worlds be restored to those of the higher-grade worlds?"
<br><br>
According to what Zen previously knew, the three thousand Godly Ways were actually the downgraded version of the ancestry-level bloodline's power.
<br><br>
Only Zen was able to possess the ancestry-level bloodline. Even the Evil God didn't have any means to obtain it. Therefore, the only viable explanation was that he was able to restore the Godly Ways to their higher-level version, granting him the power equal to that of the ancestrylevel bloodline.
<br><br>
"I actually don't want to believe it. The Bold Conjecture House tried to do that thing but always failed. What kept them trying was only the assumption that it was possible to achieve," Kincaid sighed as he let out a bitter smile.
<br><br>
At that time, the Bold Conjecture House had put a lot of energy, effort, and resources in this respect. They knew that once they succeeded with this, its impact would be so devastating and world-changing. However, they were stuck in a dead end, so they had no choice but to give up.
<br><br>
Now, if a creature in the chaos was really able to restore the Godly Ways smoothly, not only Kincaid, but all the elders in the Bold Conjecture House that dedicated their lives in this matter would feel depressed.
<br><br>
"Although the Evil God doesn't intend to attack us now, sooner or later, a battle would be inevitable. The worst part is that we're at an extreme disadvantage because both the Evil God and the downgrader have the power of the Deep Space," the Snake Goddess said in a dejected voice.
<br><br>
"Well, we still have Geoffrey. We can only place our hopes on him," Zen said with a faint smile, trying to somehow alleviate the mood of his companions.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on one side of the jadeite platform, Rocher was silently sitting.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey set out, Rocher was sent to the jadeite platform so he could immediately report if anything happened to the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had been away for quite a period of time already. However, there had been no news so far. Everyone's anxiety was just deepening with each passing day.
<br><br>
Some of them had started to lose hope that Geoffrey would still return.
<br><br>
But at this moment, Rocher's shoulder suddenly trembled. Upon noticing this, he quickly stood and announced, "The other end of the Lone Sword seems to have trembled!"
<br><br>
The eyes of the people instantly lit up as they heard this. They had been waiting for this news the entire time. With that, Kincaid and the others immediately gathered around Rocher.
<br><br>
Chapter 4262 The Missing Entrance Previously, Kincaid had used "Elder Xue" to calm everyone down, including the human spirits in the Bold Conjecture House and the people in the primitive land.
<br><br>
However, these people were all smart. Leaving aside the question of whether or not Elder Xue was still alive, Geoffrey had a very slim chance to even find Elder Xue in the Deep Space, not to mention get the other weapon.
<br><br>
But hope was still hope no matter how small it was. They rarely mentioned Geoffrey these days, but everyone was obviously worried about him.
<br><br>
Therefore, although Rocher only received a slight response, they immediately surrounded him.
<br><br>
Rocher could clearly feel the Lone Sword vibrate for the second time, then for the third time, and then the fourth time... He deciphered the message according to the rhythm and put it into words.
<br><br>
"I'm... coming... back..." he said.
<br><br>
The people on the jadeite platform looked at each other with joy.
<br><br>
Zen asked Rocher directly, "Is Geoffrey bringing Elder Xue back?"
<br><br>
Everyone was eager to hear the answer, but everyone remained silent because they were afraid that they would disturb Rocher when he was receiving the message.
<br><br>
After a while, Rocher said, "No."
<br><br>
Disappointment was apparent on everyone's faces. Zen frowned but said nothing.
<br><br>
Kincaid, however, asked, "Has he seen Elder Xue yet? Did he get that object?"
<br><br>
Although everyone no longer had any expectations, they still stared at Rocher.
<br><br>
Rocher felt quite awkward to be the focus of everyone's attention, but he threw all these trifles to the back of his mind when he received Geoffrey's message. He said happily, "He's seen Elder Xue and obtained that object..."
<br><br>
"Wow!"
<br><br>
Everyone on the jadeite platform burst into excited cheers.
<br><br>
The three Chaos Ancient Gods weren't an exception. In their excitement, the dens that held their huge bodies were also swaying.
<br><br>
The people living in the Pear Hill even felt that the mountain was shaking.
<br><br>
"Shh, he's still talking," Rocher said.
<br><br>
The atmosphere was still a little merry with joy a moment ago but now, although everyone was extremely excited inside, they were all silent.
<br><br>
"I've already obtained the Heavenly Ring Staff. Elder Xue can't enter the main world and can only stay in the Deep Space. I'm going back to the chaos with Master Ziya now." Rocher continued to deliver Geoffrey's words.
<br><br>
Zen and the others were surprised to hear this.
<br><br>
After spending a brief while at the holy pillar to transmit news, Geoffrey and Ziya began their journey back to the chaos.
<br><br>
The chaos was still quite a distance away from the holy pillar. In the past, Geoffrey had to drag Ziya along the way.
<br><br>
Now that Ziya had completely adapted to the main world and Geoffrey's strength had greatly increased, they were naturally able to return at a much faster speed. The two of them jumped down from the top of the holy pillar like two nimble swallows gliding down.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
A few hours later, the two of them had returned to the grassland where they stayed before.
<br><br>
After they passed through this grassland and crossed a river, they would be able to enter a large mountain where the entrance to the Deleting Space was located.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, when the two of them were flying across the grassland, a strange sound suddenly came from below.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...
<br><br>
There seemed to be many slender things flying speedily across the grassland. Geoffrey and Ziya sensed them almost at the same time.
<br><br>
"What are they? Snakes?" Ziya frowned.
<br><br>
Although he had already gone through the Soul Reincarnation, he needed to resist the pressure of the Abstruse Energy World, so he didn't release his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
"No, they're those tentacles," Geoffrey replied.
<br><br>
"Oh, they won't be a problem for us then." Ziya nodded.
<br><br>
Ziya had also killed those tentacles-like creatures in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
They weren't that powerful.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
The tentacles flew above the grassland for a while, but then they suddenly flew towards Geoffrey and Ziya.
<br><br>
Ziya's expression changed in an instant. There were probably hundreds of thousands of them. When they simultaneously flew towards the two of them, they looked just like a black cloud that rose to the sky.
<br><br>
"Ha!"
<br><br>
Ziya pulled out his God Lashing Whip and swung it down fiercely.
<br><br>
Swish, swish, swish...
<br><br>
Countless whip shadows flew out, looking like golden lights that shred the tentacles they came into contact with into pieces.
<br><br>
Although the power of the God Lashing Whip was formidable, those tentacles still maintained their vitality even after they were shredded into pieces. Ziya had already seen their amazing vitality in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
While Ziya was busy beating those tentacles, Geoffrey only raised the Heavenly Ring Staff and ordered, "Destroy them."
<br><br>
As some power in Geoffrey's body was drawn away, two huge mirrors suddenly appeared in this world. One appeared under Geoffrey's feet and flew downward, while the other one appeared on the ground and flew upward.
<br><br>
In mere seconds, the two mirrors merged together, forming a thin line.
<br><br>
The thin line grew short at a lightning speed before vanishing completely.
<br><br>
Of course, everything caught between the mirrors vanished along with them.
<br><br>
Ziya, who witnessed this, gulped and said, "This ability is too overbearing..."
<br><br>
In the chaos, Ziya had seen all sorts of incredible techniques and weapons, but they were all nothing compared to the Heavenly Ring Staff in Geoffrey's hand. The Heavenly Ring Staff was the real supreme weapon.
<br><br>
After the tentacles were removed, they continued their journey back. They had to go along a river before they could finally enter the mountain.
<br><br>
Although he had left for quite a long time, Geoffrey still remembered the way back clearly. He took a path down at the mountainside, went a few hundred feet forward, and then stopped in front of a mountain wall.
<br><br>
"Here we are," said Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Although it was Ziya who had dug and created the cave in the Deleting Space, since he didn't go through the Soul Reincarnation before, he didn't know about its concrete location and had to get in and out by tying himself with a rope before.
<br><br>
Ziya went towards the direction Geoffrey pointed in, but to his surprise, he only found a cold mountain wall. "Geoffrey, do you forget the entrance? It's not here..."
<br><br>
"How is that possible?" Geoffrey looked in bewilderment.
<br><br>
He stepped forward to look for the entrance. His expression became more and more baffled. "This is impossible! There is a stone step here, and we should be able to enter the cave by stepping on it. The stone step still exists, but is the cave gone?"
<br><br>
Seeing that Geoffrey was so certain about the path he showed, Ziya realized that something must be wrong.
<br><br>
The two of them kept walking around the mountain wall and searched all over the area, but they still couldn't find the entrance! "The entrance has disappeared," Geoffrey said as he looked at the mountain wall.
<br><br>
"It took me a long time to dig this entrance, and it has never disappeared since then. Could we perhaps be mistaken?" Ziya suspected that they might have come to the wrong place.
<br><br>
"No!" Geoffrey said solemnly and then made a light leap. While facing the mountain wall, he said, "Since the chaos is within this mountain, I just have to create an entrance!"
<br><br>
Swish! Swish...
<br><br>
Bang! Rumble...
<br><br>
Geoffrey now had the power equal to the power of the Fostering race's top warriors.
<br><br>
Although he didn't use all his power when he launched this punch, it was still so powerful that the entire mountain range was shaking. A huge crack was created on the mountain wall in front of them. A huge hole gradually appeared in the middle of the crack. Nevertheless, this cave-like hole wasn't really deep. The deepest part of the hole was still mountain rocks.
<br><br>
The passageway that Geoffrey expected to appear was nowhere to be seen.
<br><br>
Chapter 4263 The Mousetrap "What happened?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey was growing more and more upset as he realized that he would be unable to return home.
<br><br>
Ziya went into the cave to look around. He bent and broke off a stone at the edge of the crack.
<br><br>
Then he drilled out of the cave, and handed the stone to Geoffrey. "Here.
<br><br>
Use your spiritual sense to check if there is anything special about this stone."
<br><br>
Geoffrey probed the stone with his spiritual sense. After several moments, he shook his head. Without saying anything, he sent his spiritual sense into the cave, exploring the stones, cracks, plants, and even bugs hiding underground in the cave.
<br><br>
"I don't believe that the large chaos can run away!"
<br><br>
He leapt upwards, rising into the sky.
<br><br>
He focused, closing his eyes, and allowed his spiritual sense to spread out as far as it could go.
<br><br>
Like an invisible cloud, Geoffrey's spiritual sense cloaked the surrounding woods, rocks, and bodies of water.
<br><br>
It flowed out for a mile, then ten miles, then a hundred miles.
<br><br>
Everything within that boundary, regardless of size, was captured by Geoffrey's spiritual sense.
<br><br>
A few minutes passed. Eventually, Geoffrey opened his eyes and slowly descended. Unable to conceal his worry, he said, "I have explored everything within a hundred miles, including seven secondary worlds.
<br><br>
One of them is the world of poisonous mist that we once entered..."
<br><br>
"Let's check them one by one," said Ziya.
<br><br>
Geoffrey nodded. Together, he and Ziya began traveling through the woods. This place was located at the edge of the main world. The seven secondary worlds had been built as experiments, and widely distributed.
<br><br>
The first secondary world they entered was completely dark. After roaming around for a while in pitch blackness, the two of them retreated.
<br><br>
The next secondary world was obscured by heavy mists.
<br><br>
Likewise, there seemed to be nothing of note in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth secondary worlds.
<br><br>
Several hours had passed. They were down to the final secondary world.
<br><br>
Geoffrey and Ziya were silent. They crossed a long, narrow mountain range and found another cave. They glanced at each other, aware that this was the last world to explore, then entered the mouth of the cave.
<br><br>
As soon as they stepped into the cave, they felt a gust of freezing wind blow over their bodies. This world was a land of ice and snow.
<br><br>
Geoffrey sighed. "This is not the chaos. Let's leave," he said.
<br><br>
However, just as they took a last look around the cave, preparing to leave, there was a sudden cracking sound from behind them. They turned swiftly. The sound had come from the flash freezing of ice water—the mouth of the cave was covered entirely with a thick layer of ice. The entrance was blocked. The two of them stared at the barrier and saw that there were faint dark shadows embedded in the depths of the ice.
<br><br>
"Is this a trap?" Ziya asked quietly, looking around him with renewed alertness.
<br><br>
He held the God Lashing Whip firmly in his hand.
<br><br>
He lifted his arm and sent countless golden whip shadows towards the ice.
<br><br>
As the golden whips slashed into the ice blocking the cave entrance, shards of crystal clear ice scattered in all directions.
<br><br>
In general, Ziya was quite confident in his own strength. After all, he was one of the top masters in the third-grade world. How could a mere layer of ice stand in his way? However, this was no ordinary ice. It condensed with a swiftness that defied the imagination. Indeed, as he lashed at the ice, it seemed to be growing thicker and thicker.
<br><br>
Outside the wall of ice, two giants stood at the entrance of the cave. The two enormous creatures, like Pompeo, belonged to the Colossus race.
<br><br>
However, there was at least one major difference. Unlike Pompeo, these two giants had purple crystals inserted along the length of their backs. The purple crystals lined their spines from the waist to the nape of the neck.
<br><br>
The giants were busy emptying their pockets. They were taking out dark blue ice runes, slapping them one after another on the surface of the ice.
<br><br>
Every time they placed down an ice rune, a wave of energy emanated from it, and the wall of ice grew thicker.
<br><br>
One of the giants snorted with laughter, as he looked at the shadowy form of Ziya and his golden whip through the ice. "The two mice scurried in and now they are trapped and want to come out. Our master was right," he said, smirking.
<br><br>
"Their strength is not too bad. What's more, they can freely move in the fourth-grade world. Fortunately, our master has loyal servants like us. We won't lose to them," the other giant said, slapping down more ice runes.
<br><br>
Ziya, who was in the secondary world, didn't know what was going on in the outside world. Golden thorns began to protrude on the surface of his God Lashing Whip.
<br><br>
"Thorny Whip!" he cried.
<br><br>
The whip lashed through the air and made a cracking sound as the thorns pierced the ice.
<br><br>
Ziya was doing his best.
<br><br>
Previously, he had needed to rely on Geoffrey in order to deal with those tentacles. He knew it would be extremely embarrassing to be forced to ask Geoffrey for help again.
<br><br>
However, even though he had unleashed all of his power, the ice withstood the force of his attacks. It seemed to be getting thicker and thicker.
<br><br>
The Abstruse Energy World was full of low-level creatures, and they simply didn't have the ability to create such a solid ice layer. This didn't make any sense.
<br><br>
While Ziya hesitated, wondering what to do next, Geoffrey came and stood beside him.
<br><br>
"Let me do it," he said.
<br><br>
Geoffrey put his hand on the ice and hit it hard with his open palm.
<br><br>
He didn't use any special skills. He simply channeled all his considerable physical strength into the blow.
<br><br>
The huge ice layer vibrated from the force of the slap. The ice became opaque, turning from a translucent blue to a cloudy snow white color as countless splinters and cracks formed and spread. After a couple of seconds, there was a deafening bang as the ice shattered and shards sprayed out like water rushing from a dam.
<br><br>
The two giants standing outside were completely caught off guard. They hadn't expected such a display of strength. Even as they stuck ice runes into the wall, it exploded outwards, and they were carried away by the massive amounts of ice debris.
<br><br>
The giants struggled to get up. When they finally raised their heads, they saw Geoffrey floating above them.
<br><br>
"Who sent you here? Tell me!" Geoffrey said coldly.
<br><br>
He was angry and frustrated at his inability to find the chaos, and he was perfectly prepared to take out his rage on these two giants. He thought they might be able to give him some answers.
<br><br>
The two giants exchanged glances. Neither of them said a word.
<br><br>
Without warning, the purple crystals on their backs flashed with some inner light, and tremendous power flowed into their bodies. Instantly they rushed at Geoffrey. They moved at a frightening speed, so that they looked like no more than blurs as they attacked.
<br><br>
The first giant grabbed Geoffrey with one hand. Even though Geoffrey's body had expanded from his time in the top floor of the Levitation Tower, increasing to four times its original size, he still resembled a child in the giant's hand.
<br><br>
The other giant clenched his fists and brought them crashing down on Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!" he shouted.
<br><br>
Heavy punches rained down on Geoffrey's body.
<br><br>
Stimulated by the purple crystals, the giant bombarded Geoffrey with a flurry of punches. His body couldn't bear the power given by the purple crystals, so his fists were smashed and bled. However, he didn't stop attacking until several minutes later.
<br><br>
But when he finally stopped, and the two giants looked down at Geoffrey, they were stunned. His body was completely intact and unharmed.
<br><br>
"Why is this guy so powerful?"
<br><br>
"Is he a creature from the third-grade world?"
<br><br>
Even as the two giants muttered to each other, Geoffrey slowly raised his Heavenly Ring Staff. He said calmly, "Torture them. Give them unbearable agony."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the Heavenly Ring Staff extracted a portion of his strength, and then released a strange sound, like a string being plucked.
<br><br>
The sound was capable of penetrating into the depths of one's soul, then releasing a terrible illusion of pain.
<br><br>
At first, the two giants tried to endure the pain. However, as it went on and on, they collapsed to ground and began to roll and howl, bellowing with anguish. They were clearly in unimaginable pain.
<br><br>
Eventually, unable to bear it any longer, the two giants began begging for mercy. Geoffrey waved the Heavenly Ring Staff and stopped the sound.
<br><br>
"I'll give you one more chance. Who sent you here?" Geoffrey asked, in the same icy tone as before.
<br><br>
This time, the two giants didn't dare to hide anything, fearful of experiencing another round of torture. They bowed deeply and answered, "Our master predicted that you would come, so he asked us to set up a mousetrap here. He said we must wait for you to enter, and then trap you."
<br><br>
"Who is your master?" Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
"Our master... He is who he is. Who else can he be?" said a giant in a puzzled tone. The other giant nodded along, looking at Geoffrey with an expression of genuine confusion.
<br><br>
Chapter 4264 A Bad Feeling Looking at the giant's silly reaction, Geoffrey felt a little depressed.
<br><br>
Something in his mind seemed to spark and he remembered what Elder Xue had told him. The creatures born after the disaster in the Deep Space were very stupid. In fact, they were not even able to cultivate due to a lack of intelligence.
<br><br>
The Abstruse Energy World had also encountered a great disaster once.
<br><br>
Geoffrey thought that the situation here was most probably similar to that of the Deep Space. These giants' intelligence quotient seemed pitifully low.
<br><br>
"Have you ever seen your master?" Ziya asked him.
<br><br>
Since these giants were not very smart, they could only inquire things little by little. Ziya was much more experienced in talking in a way that they could understand.
<br><br>
"No. But he talks in our minds," the giant answered.
<br><br>
Ziya nodded and then continued, "Can everyone in your race hear him?"
<br><br>
"Yes," the giant affirmed.
<br><br>
"It's a will that descends into their minds," Ziya muttered to himself.
<br><br>
"No one in the fourth-grade world has such a powerful soul. Is he the downgrader?" Geoffrey theorized.
<br><br>
"That's quite likely," Ziya nodded as he looked at the purple crystals behind the giants. Then he asked, "How did you get these crystals?"
<br><br>
If it really were the downgrader who controlled these giants, then the purple crystals would have been his giving since the giants finding them on their own was highly unlikely.
<br><br>
It was hard to say whether the downgrader could return to the Abstruse Energy World, but he could definitely find a way to ship or smuggle the purple crystals out of the chaos. And these crystals might contain some clues of the chaos.
<br><br>
"They were given to us by our patriarch. It was he who gave us our powerful strength," one of the giants explained.
<br><br>
"And where is your patriarch?" Ziya asked gently.
<br><br>
At that moment, a loud voice seemed to come from afar. "No need to inquire about me. I'm here!"
<br><br>
There was a soft shimmering on the top of a mountain not far away from them, and a giant the size of a hill appeared on its peak.
<br><br>
The giant's head was inlaid with hundreds, if not thousands of purple crystals, which spread all the way from his head to his arms. The strangest thing was that at the bottom of those crystals, blood was seeping out. They must have been stabbed into his body not long ago.
<br><br>
Then, giant after giant emerged from the top of the mountain. In the blink of an eye, well over a thousand of them were visible.
<br><br>
Ziya immediately went on high alert and held the God Lashing Whip tightly in his hand.
<br><br>
"That's great! We won't have to waste time!"
<br><br>
With a smile on his face, Geoffrey rushed out and stomped on the mountain. He then turned into a huge arc and smashed towards the patriarch.
<br><br>
Seeing Geoffrey take action first, the members of the Colossus race roared in unison.
<br><br>
Buzz! Before Geoffrey could reach halfway, every single crystal on the patriarch's body began to glow.
<br><br>
A huge power stimulated every meridian in his body. His eyes turned red, and like a machine, his giant fist struck out towards Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Boom! A muffled sound was heard.
<br><br>
The giant had actually managed to block Geoffrey's attack. However, he paid a heavy price for that. His thick arm began to crack, the purple crystals embedded in his arm shot out like sharp arrows, and more than half of his shoulder was torn apart.
<br><br>
Geoffrey then stepped forward and grabbed the patriarch's huge head with one hand. "Where did you get these crystals? You have nine seconds to answer or you die!"
<br><br>
The members of the Colossus race had never thought that their prey would be so powerful. Time seemed to stand still for a moment.
<br><br>
All the giants, including the patriarch, did not even dare to move.
<br><br>
"They... They were given to us by our master," the patriarch stammered.
<br><br>
"Where is your master? Nine seconds or..." Geoffrey threatened.
<br><br>
Just as the patriarch was about to speak, the purple crystals on his back began to glow once again. But this time, the glow seemed a bit different, almost berserk.
<br><br>
Then, as if he had truly lost his mind and didn't care about Geoffrey's threat at all, the giant suddenly threw his remaining arm towards Geoffrey.
<br><br>
However, the moment he tried to make his move, Geoffrey tightened his grip instantly, and the patriarch's head exploded into confetti.
<br><br>
Roar! "Kill them!"
<br><br>
"Eliminate the outsiders!"
<br><br>
The giants swiftly surrounded Geoffrey.
<br><br>
However, they didn't seem to have a desire for revenge for the death of their patriarch. Instead, the purple crystals on their bodies had begun flashing and filling their bodies with a violent power that could control their souls. They had turned into a group of puppets and were now attacking the enemy.
<br><br>
"You are too slow and weak to be of any use to yourselves!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey felt like he was fighting with children when faced with these giants.
<br><br>
His figure became a blur as he moved rapidly between the giants. Every time he passed by one of them, a fist mark would land on their heads, which would then deform, crack, and finally shatter at a speed visible to the naked eye.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! The giants, like heavy doors, were continuously smashed onto the ground.
<br><br>
In less than thirty seconds, Geoffrey had killed about thirty of them.
<br><br>
However, when he turned around, he saw that there were still many giants on the top of the mountain. He had taken a spoon out of the ocean.
<br><br>
"There are too many of them. Kill them all!" Geoffrey ordered as he raised his Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
Swoosh! About one third of his strength was extracted and filled the staff.
<br><br>
Then thunder began to form and brew in the Heavenly Ring Staff. Its crisp crackle reached Geoffrey's ears and a sinister smile raised his lips.
<br><br>
Then with a loud and violent noise, the whole mountain in front of them was shrouded in a burst of powerful lightning, which lasted only for an instant. Once it had disappeared, the giants were still able to maintain their original postures, with some of them climbing and some running forwards, but their bodies were charred and their vitality had disappeared.
<br><br>
Although Ziya had witnessed the power of the Heavenly Ring Staff before, he was still shocked.
<br><br>
The number of energies would be reduced in a higher-grade world. Ziya's strength was greatly weakened in the Abstruse Energy World, even though it was extremely terrifying in the chaos.
<br><br>
However, if Geoffrey's attack was so powerful in the Abstruse Energy World itself, just how powerful would it be in the chaos? Looking at the giant corpses on the ground, Geoffrey seemed a little worried. "They are all being controlled. Our opponent is too cunning."
<br><br>
However, Ziya was not discouraged. "Hmm... Since he's targeting us, he will definitely attack us again."
<br><br>
While they were talking, another sound came from not far away. Geoffrey smiled faintly and then told him, "It looks like you are right."
<br><br>
But when he looked into the distance, his face suddenly froze.
<br><br>
Another group of members of the Colossus race had appeared on the mountain top.
<br><br>
There were over a thousand of them, and their leader was the same patriarch that they had seen just a few moments ago. Even the pattern in which the purple crystals had been stuck on the patriarch's body was the same.
<br><br>
Ziya also felt that something was wrong. "What's going on? Are these giants mere clones?"
<br><br>
"Fight them!"
<br><br>
The patriarch waved his arm and every single giant rushed over towards them.
<br><br>
Geoffrey frowned and raised the Heavenly Ring Staff with some hesitation.
<br><br>
"Kill them."
<br><br>
Boom! The Heavenly Ring Staff once again extracted a third of Geoffrey's strength and lightning fell.
<br><br>
A burst of violent thunder managed to completely annihilate a large group of giants. But this came at a great cost.
<br><br>
After exploding thunder on their heads two times in a row, Geoffrey felt slightly weak. More than two thirds of his strength had been consumed. If he used this move a third time, he would no longer be able to use the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
The power of this staff was totally dependent on the user's strength.
<br><br>
Although Geoffrey had been strengthened for two times by the Levitation Tower and he was easily comparable to a top-level warrior in the Deep Space, his strength was still limited in magnitude.
<br><br>
At that moment, a bad feeling came over him. The hidden opponent knew him and the Heavenly Ring Staff very well. He was trying to tire him out.
<br><br>
Chapter 4265 Flee All The Way When Geoffrey still felt a little uneasy, he saw a blue light flashing from the left side of the mountain peak.
<br><br>
Once the blue light chose an area and shone on it, many giants' figures appeared within that glow.
<br><br>
They were all members of the Colossus race, and their number stretched over a thousand.
<br><br>
"Master Ziya, let's flee from here!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey cautioned as he raised the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
A burst of invisible wind swept violently downward, rolling the two of them up into the sky. They then left, carried on the wind.
<br><br>
When the members of the Colossus race saw Geoffrey and Ziya depart, they didn't give chase at all, since they couldn't catch up to them.
<br><br>
The leader of the Colossus race looked up at the sky and stated, "Master, they have escaped."
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
Colorful lights appeared above the heads of these members of the Colossus race. The colorful lights possessed varying flashes in length.
<br><br>
They blended with each other. Soon, a giant roc-fish appeared and floated in the air.
<br><br>
If Zen had witnessed this scene, he would have recognized it. This was the Starry Roc-fish he had seen in the Soul City.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish was the mount of Kincaid. It was not a sentient being, but a ball of intelligent energy. As a member of the Four Spirits Sect, the Starry Roc-fish was probably the only one who had escaped the big disaster.
<br><br>
For many years, it had been circling outside the chaos, and it could be observed in the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish's voice was quickly transmitted, "Don't worry. They can't escape...
<br><br>
As long as I don't remove this Absolute Existence Form, you won't really die.
<br><br>
I will continue to project you and make you appear in front of them again and again until they are killed!"
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish had been a sacred beast of the Colossus race all this time! The Colossus race, which had been born after the disaster, had been able to reach this level of development because of the kindness and mercy of the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
The leader and the members of this race were all subservient to the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
However, the members of the Colossus race hadn't noticed the change in the Starry Roc-fish. At the top of the originally colorful horns, there was now a bit of black light mixed in, and the Starry Roc-fish's pair of bright eyes were filled with conflicting colors.
<br><br>
At this time, the Starry Roc-fish was no longer the sacred beast that had protected them for centuries.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
After Geoffrey and Ziya had flown a safe distance in the air, they slowly descended to a forest of giant trees.
<br><br>
Standing on the swingy boughs of one of the giant trees, the two of them were a little depressed. However, Ziya remained calmer, while Geoffrey began to complain, "We can't return! What's the use of me discovering this object?"
<br><br>
As Geoffrey spoke, he raised the Heavenly Ring Staff and brandished it around.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Bang! Bang! Crack...
<br><br>
The Heavenly Ring Staff smashed straight onto a tree trunk. How could a mere trunk withstand Geoffrey's power? Thus, the tree trunk snapped with a loud bang.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Heavenly Ring Staff itself was not an ordinary object, and it didn't suffer any damages. The rough tree trunk was as hard as metal, but it still could not withstand the strike.
<br><br>
Feeling the weight of his frustration, Geoffrey lost his temper again.
<br><br>
Ziya remained silent.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had no idea how to find the chaos.
<br><br>
He was also quite certain of the consequences of not being able to return to the chaos.
<br><br>
While Geoffrey was still venting his anger, another ray of blue light flashed on a treetop not far away.
<br><br>
Just as before, the members of the Colossus race appeared within the radius of the blue light again! "You are everywhere! You fools are... courting death!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey instantly and without hesitation wielded the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey!"
<br><br>
Ziya tried to stop Geoffrey from using the Heavenly Ring Staff, but he was too late. Nearly one-third of Geoffrey's power had been absorbed.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Ring Staff would use a fixed ability when dealing with a specific object.
<br><br>
As the energy flashed from the Heavenly Ring Staff, another outburst of violent thunderbolts obliterated the members of the Colossus race.
<br><br>
Boom...
<br><br>
In the blinking of an eye, the members of the Colossus race were decimated.
<br><br>
The loud thunderous roar made flocks of birds fly around in shock, screaming in fear.
<br><br>
Geoffrey felt weakened after his strength had been extracted.
<br><br>
Although his physical body was able to recover swiftly, it couldn't face his overuse of the power.
<br><br>
As soon as he killed this group of giants, another ray of blue light drew a circle on the top of another tree. Those giants reappeared again! "Don't try to fight against them. Let's go!" Ziya urged.
<br><br>
Geoffrey nodded and raised the Heavenly Ring Staff with all his remaining strength. Then he made use of the wind pressure to pull him and Ziya up into the sky again.
<br><br>
Since the members of the Colossus race were able to follow them all over, he and Ziya were surely being tracked.
<br><br>
Choosing to hide behind these giants, their opponent was not afraid of Geoffrey, but he surely feared the Heavenly Ring Staff in his hand.
<br><br>
Once he noticed that Geoffrey's strength was depleted, their opponent would probably take action to snatch it away.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
"Master Ziya, is there anything that can replenish lost energy?"
<br><br>
"Divine crystals.
<br><br>
Do you want to eat some?"
<br><br>
The Stellar World held a higher set of standards. When one relied on the materials from a lower-grade world to nourish themselves, the efficiency was extremely low.
<br><br>
After flying across some distance, the two of them descended again.
<br><br>
However, the situation remained the same as before. Whenever the two of them touched the ground, that blue light would appear. At the same time, the group of giants would be transported there, forcing Geoffrey to escape by flying into the sky again.
<br><br>
After this happened for three or four times, Geoffrey felt that his strength had become even more weakened, and he was not recovering.
<br><br>
If this continued, he would be doomed! Realizing this, Geoffrey suddenly made up his mind. "Take us to the top of the holy pillar!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! The higher the world grade was, the more difficult it would be to use the spatial transference. Geoffrey didn't know if the Heavenly Ring Staff could be moved by means of the Grand Teleportation technique, nor did he know if his physical body could withstand that.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Ring Staff had almost drained the last of Geoffrey's physical strength. His energy was insufficient, and the Heavenly Ring Staff now even began to draw out his soul power! Geoffrey felt dizzy and almost fainted. Then the two of them were wreathed in a layer of blue light and immediately disappeared from the sky.
<br><br>
The next moment, the two of them instantly appeared at the top of the holy pillar.
<br><br>
Ziya stood there steadily, while Geoffrey was so weak that he almost crashed down on the pillar.
<br><br>
"Sir, hurry up. Tell my father..."
<br><br>
Currently, they probably wouldn't be able to enter the chaos. The only possibility was to ask Zen to come out.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had extracted the last of his strength in order to get to the pillar.
<br><br>
Without saying a word, Ziya moved straight to the edge of the holy pillar.
<br><br>
He put his finger on the light ray that connected to the Lone Sword and began to gently pull it.
<br><br>
Previously, he had known how Geoffrey operated it.
<br><br>
On the jadeite platform Zen and the others were restlessly waiting.
<br><br>
The distance from the holy pillar to the chaos was not great. Ziya would bring Geoffrey and descend from the Deleting Space at any moment now.
<br><br>
As time ticked by, Zen and the others became more and more impatient.
<br><br>
"Why haven't they come back yet?"
<br><br>
"Could it be that they can't descend from the Deleting Space?"
<br><br>
"Maybe they can't find their way back..."
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
Just as everyone began burning with anxiety, Rocher's Lone Sword began to tremble again, and new information was transmitted from the other side.
<br><br>
"I'm Ziya. We can't locate the chaos and are unable to return!"
<br><br>
Chapter 4266 The Only Way Left Everyone who heard what Rocher said was surprised and confused.
<br><br>
'The chaos is such a huge world. How is it possible that they couldn't find it?' they all thought at the back of their minds.
<br><br>
"Why can't you find your way back?"
<br><br>
"Are you lost?"
<br><br>
"Be patient and look more carefully."
<br><br>
Zen, Fuxi, and the others were so anxious that they impatiently blurted what they were thinking.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Snake Goddess interrupted them. "Calm down. Ziya is not a fool, and neither is Geoffrey. They wouldn't have come back to the holy pillar and asked for our help simply because they got lost. They must be in a more difficult situation than we can imagine. Let him talk," she kind of reprimanded everyone present.
<br><br>
Upon hearing what the Snake Goddess said, the people on the jadeite platform recognized what she meant. They quickly fell silent and stared back at Rocher.
<br><br>
"They are being pursued by a great number of enemies. Their sheer number is overwhelming that they couldn't defeat them all. Although Geoffrey gained incredible strength, he is now exhausted. They don't know how much longer they would be able to hold on." Rocher reported everything that Ziya told him.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Zen was suddenly alarmed. "Did he say who were after them?" he asked.
<br><br>
After a short while, Rocher replied, "A bunch of giants."
<br><br>
'Giants in the main world?' When Zen heard this, Pompeo immediately popped into his mind.
<br><br>
'If several members of the Colossus race are after them, then both of them are in grave danger, ' Zen thought with a worried expression on his face.
<br><br>
"What should we do now?"
<br><br>
Zen murmured to himself as he paced back and forth.
<br><br>
Right now, Ziya and Geoffrey couldn't come back and bring the Heavenly Ring Staff to them. Moreover, they were in a dangerous situation.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, Zen stopped walking. Something lit in his eyes as he turned to the Snake Goddess. "The Eternal Scroll Painting! We can enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard through it. That's the fastest shortcut!"
<br><br>
Zen exclaimed in excitement.
<br><br>
However, he didn't understand why no one gave a single response.
<br><br>
In the end, it was the Primeval Lord of Heaven who dared to break the silence. A wisp of his soul floated out of the Civilization Artifact and sighed. "Zen, the Eternal Scroll Painting is still closed. Furthermore, the Grand Plain Stage was already destroyed by the downgrader," he explained calmly.
<br><br>
Since the Grand Plain Stage was destroyed, it must also mean that the Eternal Scroll Painting vanished with it too.
<br><br>
Fuxi kept his head lowered as he furrowed his eyebrows, while the Snake Goddess pursed her lips. They couldn't say anything as they didn't want to be the ones to break it to Zen.
<br><br>
Not long ago, Geoffrey had just completed a very risky and difficult mission. However, they didn't expect that things would go south at such a critical point. Now, they were stuck with a problem that they couldn't solve.
<br><br>
All of their choices were being blocked off. They couldn't get to the Deleting Space or the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"Wait! There's still someone who might be able to send me to the Deleting Space," Zen said abruptly as a thought suddenly occurred to him.
<br><br>
"Are you thinking of the Evil God?" the Snake Goddess asked with a suspicious look in her eyes. "I don't think he will help you. Besides, did you forget that Ziya closed the Deleting Space? Even Othniel wasn't able to enter it. Although the Evil God learned the space truth, it's still impossible for him to send you to the Deleting Space," she said in low spirits.
<br><br>
The Deleting Space was under Ziya's total control. Even Chaos Ancient Gods weren't able to do anything with it.
<br><br>
Zen began pacing back and forth again. The frustration was so visible on his face.
<br><br>
Even the blue veins on his forehead were totally exposed.
<br><br>
While everyone was racking their brains for a solution and wallowing in despair, Kincaid chimed in, "There's actually a way to make it to the main world."
<br><br>
"Really? How?" In the blink of an eye, Zen appeared in front of Kincaid, eager to know what he was talking about. He was so desperate that he would do anything whatever it might be.
<br><br>
"There are two paths in the channel that could be found in the Bold Conjecture House. They can come back through one of those roads,"
<br><br>
Kincaid explained.
<br><br>
Everyone present looked at him with a displeased expression as soon as he finished speaking. They all wondered why he kept silent all this time if he had the solution all along.
<br><br>
Kincaid knew exactly what they were thinking. However, he had his own reasons for not bringing it up earlier. "The only problem is who to send.
<br><br>
Hilario, the human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House, and even I couldn't return to the main world because we will die there. On the other hand, though you can enter the main world, you can't walk freely and see clearly in there," he continued.
<br><br>
He knew that none of them had experienced the Red Jade Rite, hence they knew so little about the main world.
<br><br>
"I'll do it," Zen said calmly. "Even if it weren't for Geoffrey and Master Ziya, I still must bring the Heavenly Ring Staff back at all costs. Right now, I'm the only one who can do that."
<br><br>
'According to what Master Ziya said, Geoffrey had run out of strength.
<br><br>
It makes sense since the Heavenly Ring Staff, like the heavy sword, requires a large amount of energy to power it. I must be the only one qualified to wield it since the ancestry-level bloodline would aid me, ' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
"Are you sure? It's too risky," Kincaid warned him in a stern voice.
<br><br>
"Everything that we have been doing is a great risk," Zen quickly retorted.
<br><br>
"We're also as good as dead if we don't do anything right now."
<br><br>
Kincaid clearly felt the determination in Zen's eyes. 'This guy understands all the risks, but he doesn't have the slightest intention of dying, ' Kincaid thought in amazement.
<br><br>
"All right then. You have to sneak into the Other Shore first…" Kincaid started explaining what he had to do.
<br><br>
Zen had initially planned on entering the Other Shore by reciting the Truth of Godly Way. But upon hearing what Kincaid said, he remembered something and said, "Master Kincaid, please wait a moment. I'll be right back."
<br><br>
Swoosh! Then, Zen suddenly vanished into thin air. The next second, he was standing in front of the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
After the Blooming Jade Stage was destroyed, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was also destroyed. Because of that, the Civilization Artifact became useless.
<br><br>
However, Zen didn't want to give up on it. He thought that it would be such a pity if he lost the unique calculation method of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
Therefore, he asked the ancestry-level bloodline to restore its core.
<br><br>
Now, there was a massive cube beside the Civilization Artifact. It was created by the ancestry-level bloodline through the power of the creation quadrant. At this point, three beams of light with various colors were outlining different things on the surface of the cube.
<br><br>
Obviously, the ancestry-level bloodline was much more powerful than the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. With its aid and the will of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, theoretically, a more powerful core would be built soon.
<br><br>
When the Heavenly Obsession Civilization caught sight of Zen, a green figure immediately appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
"How is it going?" Zen inquired about the progress.
<br><br>
"About half done," the green figure informed.
<br><br>
"Do you think it will work?" Zen asked, just to make sure.
<br><br>
The green figure actually didn't know what Zen was up to, but it still answered, "Yes, it will. But its efficiency might be very low."
<br><br>
"I see. Well, I'm going to the main world right now. I would need your help after I get there."
<br><br>
Zen instructed briefly and didn't provide much information since he was in a hurry.
<br><br>
Before the green figure could react, Zen already disappeared.
<br><br>
When he returned to the jadeite platform, Zen quickly sat down with his legs crossed and looked at Kincaid. "I'm ready."
<br><br>
Upon entering the Other Shore, they walked into the passageway.
<br><br>
Hilario immediately spotted the two and was baffled as to why they were there. Reading his mind, Kincaid said, "He wants to go to the main world…"
<br><br>
"What? Why?" Hilario got even more confused when he heard the reason for their sudden appearance. "What happened?" he couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>
Therefore, Kincaid filled him in on what had happened in the main world.
<br><br>
As he explained the unexpected situation, Hilario fell into a deep thought.
<br><br>
"The passageway does lead to the main world. But before you get there, you will need to pass through the Eternal Scroll Painting and face the brush-wielder," Hilario warned.
<br><br>
At the mention of the brush-wielder, Zen's eyebrows quickly raised.
<br><br>
From the moment that Zen knew the truth behind Cornelius's scheme and the alter, he realized that the brush-wielder was actually not on their side.
<br><br>
He was the one who coaxed him into entering the alter in order to acquire the sword.
<br><br>
Judging from that, Zen speculated that the brush-wielder was, in fact, someone who worked for the downgrader.
<br><br>
Zen was able to pass through the Eternal Scroll Painting back then. But now, he thought that it might not be that easy since the brush-wielder might get in his way.
<br><br>
Chapter 4267 Blocked Zen was left with no choice but to pass through this passageway to go to the main world.
<br><br>
"I don't have to be afraid. I have the ancestry-level bloodline," he pronounced.
<br><br>
Kincaid remained silent beside him. It was Zen's own choice, so he had no say in it.
<br><br>
Hilario didn't stop him either. Of course, he hoped that Zen could bring the Heavenly Ring Staff back.
<br><br>
The curses cast on the human spirits from the Bold Conjecture House were done using the powers of the Deep Space. The Heavenly Ring Staff could lift the curses and finally end their misery.
<br><br>
"Since you insist, our Bold Conjecture House has no objection." After saying that, Hilario nodded to the human spirits behind him. The longhaired monsters stepped aside to make way for Zen.
<br><br>
Just then, a golden light flashed beside Kincaid. Out came Dorothy, also returning to the passageway.
<br><br>
Dorothy had arrived from the Pear Hill, where she had been staying with Yasamin.
<br><br>
She had hurried over when she heard that Zen was heading to the Abstruse Energy World alone.
<br><br>
"Zen, I'll go with you!" Dorothy called out.
<br><br>
Kincaid's face darkened when he heard that. "Stop messing around, Dora."
<br><br>
Dorothy glanced at him.
<br><br>
Kincaid was family, but he knew nothing about her life in the chaos.
<br><br>
Dorothy shook her head. "I'm not messing around. I'm your daughter and a human spirit, too. I would probably be able to walk freely in the Abstruse Energy World!"
<br><br>
The warriors of the Bold Conjecture House, admittedly, had also been wondering if Dorothy had that ability.
<br><br>
But they couldn't make any conclusions without a precedent.
<br><br>
"If you are still a creature of the main world, the rules of the main world could kill you. And if you aren't, you would only be a liability to Zen. You cannot go!" Kincaid took a step forward and stood in Dorothy's way.
<br><br>
"Dorothy, please," Zen pleaded, his face serious.
<br><br>
He knew how stubborn Dorothy was. Even Yasamin couldn't stop her, so it was less likely that Kincaid and the human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House could change her mind.
<br><br>
Before Dorothy could move further, Hilario reached out his hand. An oval-shaped gem appeared on his fluffy palm. The gem glowed, and at once, Dorothy felt dizzy and started to lose her balance.
<br><br>
Kincaid came forward and caught her as she slumped down. He turned to Zen and nodded for him to go.
<br><br>
Zen followed Hilario straight to the end of the passageway where a rusty metal door stood shut. Zen surmised it was not made of ordinary iron. He could sense it had been there for trillions of years, and yet, it remained free of any erosion.
<br><br>
As he walked up to the door, Hilario started telling him about it. "We created this path when we were trapped in the chaos. Although it is still in the Eternal Scroll Painting, it is actually a shortcut. You'd have a better chance of evading the brush-wielder through here."
<br><br>
Hilario had speculated the brush-wielder was on the downgrader's side.
<br><br>
Zen and Kincaid were inclined to agree, based on the brush-wielder's actions so far.
<br><br>
Though it was only a speculation, it would be safer to avoid him.
<br><br>
With a curt nod to Hilario, Zen pulled the iron door open and stepped in.
<br><br>
The other side of the iron door looked like a void but felt more like a solid wall. As soon as Zen entered, an irresistible force pressed him onto the wall until he had been flattened and emerged on the other side as a twodimensional figure.
<br><br>
Zen adapted to the transformation quicker now, having entered the Eternal Scroll Painting before.
<br><br>
"A straight road!"
<br><br>
Up ahead lay a path just as Hilario described. Those who took this road could pass through the Eternal Scroll Painting without having to take its myriad tests.
<br><br>
Zen wasted no time. He scrambled onto the path quickly as if he was being chased.
<br><br>
It only took him half a minute to reach the end of the road.
<br><br>
But as he took another step forward, a new path appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
This puzzled Zen for a moment before he realized that this was probably the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
The Eternal Scroll Painting had a total of three pages, and he had to pass through them all.
<br><br>
He moved quickly onward. It wasn't long before he had passed through the second page, too, arriving at the road on the third page.
<br><br>
Zen hurried on the path, looking forward to finally reaching the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
Halfway down the road, Zen could already spot the door drawn at the end.
<br><br>
It was wide open, just calling for him to enter! He could feel his heart thumping in nervous anticipation, fervently hoping there would be no sudden obstacles.
<br><br>
He got closer and closer to the door. He was only two or three steps away when a thick ink mark appeared on the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
The mark crossed the door out.
<br><br>
It was blocking Zen's entry! Zen stopped in his tracks. His glowering looks were evident even in his two-dimensional state.
<br><br>
He couldn't read the brush-wielder's motives the last time they met, but he knew that this time would definitely leave no room for doubt.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish, swish!"
<br><br>
Four more thick ink marks appeared around Zen one after another, acting like a cage.
<br><br>
"Brush-wielder," Zen called out.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't see him in his current form, but he knew that the brushwielder was looking down at him from above the painting scroll.
<br><br>
A crying face appeared above Zen. "You didn't disappoint me. Finally, you opened the altar. You are better than I thought," he said.
<br><br>
"Why are you stopping me, then?" Zen responded.
<br><br>
The crying face turned into a smiling one, but his voice remained somber.
<br><br>
"Your task has already been completed. There is no need for further trouble. So either go back to the chaos, or remain here."
<br><br>
Zen felt a hot flash of anger upon hearing this. He finally lashed out, "And do you think the downgrader will give you what you want? When he created you, he told you the second-grade world, the Wall World, was the most perfect, but it was all just a trick! He also said the same to the Four Spirits Sect about the third-grade world, the Cinnabar race about the fourth-grade world, and the Sacred Spirit race about the fifth-grade world!"
<br><br>
"I do not care. My long cherished wish is to expand the Wall World. This Eternal Scroll Painting is not big enough," the brush-wielder said.
<br><br>
The Eternal Scroll Painting, in fact, was not the actual Wall World.
<br><br>
Creatures in the Wall World could not see their appearance as they were depicted on the scroll. Thus, the Eternal Scroll Painting was just a simulation. But the brush-wielder wanted to make this simulation into reality.
<br><br>
"He won't stop even if the Wall World becomes what you wants it to be! He will still downgrade the Wall World to the first-grade world, the World of Nothingness, and you will be destroyed in the end!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
This was obvious to Zen. He couldn't understand why the brush-wielder, with all that he had seen, couldn't figure this out.
<br><br>
But the brush-wielder could not be reasoned with. "Even if it eventually becomes a first-grade world, at least the Wall World will last for the next decades. It is enough for me. The third-grade world has existed for so long. I will see to it the Wall World exists longer. There would be more second-grade world creatures inhabiting the Wall World, and the entire Wall World will be more prosperous!" the brush-wielder insisted, clinging fervently to blind faith.
<br><br>
Chapter 4268 Rescue (Part One) Ever since he came into existence, the brush-wielder had regarded himself as the God of the Wall World, and he had a very strong obsession with it.
<br><br>
If the downgrader would really turn the entire world into a Wall World, then he couldn't be any happier. It was what he wished all along.
<br><br>
Originally, Zen wanted to persuade the brush-wielder into helping him.
<br><br>
However, as he heard all the crazy words that the brush-wielder had spouted, Zen knew that it would never happen. He was so disappointed and angry at the same time.
<br><br>
"Even if he really turns everything into a Wall World, what do you think would happen to you? Do you think he would let you live? Can't you see that you're just being manipulated too? Did you even see the miserable state that Cornelius ended up with?!" Zen wasn't able to contain his emotions as he tried to drill some sense into the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
"I don't care if I'm being manipulated! All I ever wished is the establishment of the Wall World!" the brush-wielder shouted as he closed his mind to everything that Zen was saying. "Too bad for you, I won't let you leave this place! You shall die here today!"
<br><br>
He knew that Zen possessed the ancestry-level bloodline, thus he didn't dare underestimate him. But right now, he would do everything in his power to eliminate him within the bounds of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
With that, a huge ink brush emerged above the Eternal Scroll Painting, which quickly sent down a stroke that sharply slashed towards Zen.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As the brush slashed, a long trail of ink swept across the snow-white painting scroll.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen instantly sensed that the strong force was about to slash his waist.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Eternal Scroll Painting was not a real Wall World yet, meaning that Zen's body maintained its strength as it was in the thirdgrade world.
<br><br>
Before they waged the war against the Snake Spirit Sect, Zen's body had already been greatly strengthened by the ancestry-level bloodline. He could withstand even the most powerful physical attacks.
<br><br>
Slash! Swish! Whoosh! The brush-wielder threw vicious attacks in rapid succession. He kept on slashing Zen over and over with his sharp strokes.
<br><br>
The black ink almost covered the entire white scroll due to the number of attacks hurled at Zen, but it appeared that his body was still unscathed.
<br><br>
"What is this? Is this the power of the ancestry-level bloodline? How could your physical body withstand such attacks?"
<br><br>
The brush-wielder temporarily halted his attacks as he saw that all those strokes didn't even cause a scratch on Zen's body.
<br><br>
With that, he changed his approach. The ink brush was held high in the air, and beams of golden lights emerged from the shaft of the brush. The ink at the tip of the brush was tinged with golden yellow, making it look even sharper.
<br><br>
"Take this! Demonic Strokes!"
<br><br>
At his command, the ink brush started violently smearing Zen's body.
<br><br>
Wisps of golden yellow strokes began covering the previous black stains, creating a messy artwork on the surface of the scroll.
<br><br>
With the abundance of ink spilled everywhere, it was actually hard to tell where Zen was if he remained still.
<br><br>
Only when he moved slightly to dodge the attacks would his form separate from the ink marks on the scroll.
<br><br>
No matter how savagely he was attacked by the brush-wielder, Zen still kept his calm, knowing that his superior physical strength would overcome every attack thrown at him. Soon enough, the brush-wielder trembled in anger and frustration at the sight of Zen's undamaged body.
<br><br>
He was exasperated by the fact that he already poured a lot of effort, but it didn't affect Zen at all.
<br><br>
"Don't think that I'm done yet! You will die by my hands. You'll see!"
<br><br>
As he finished speaking, the ink brush that was floating in the void suddenly disappeared, and what surfaced in place of it was a huge graver.
<br><br>
At a glance, its appearance might look simple and austere, but Zen perceived that it should be something extraordinary.
<br><br>
At this moment, Zen couldn't see anything outside the scroll painting, but he could clearly sense the sharp aura that the graver was emitting.
<br><br>
However, since he was trapped inside the painting, he couldn't do anything except dodging attacks. He was currently at the mercy of the brush-wielder. Although he might be able to dodge some of his attacks, he couldn't totally escape from him.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Without any warning, the graver slashed down towards Zen.
<br><br>
Splat! A trail of blood appeared on the scroll, covering the previous black and golden ink marks.
<br><br>
As Zen looked, he saw that a deep wound was inflicted on his body. His flesh was ripped open that the surface of his bone was already visible.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! Did you feel that? This is my Life-energy Graver. Every time I use it, it consumes my life energy. Can you imagine that? I'm attacking you at the cost of my own life!" The brush-wielder was acting crazier this time. It was as if he was laughing, crying, and madly yelling at the same time.
<br><br>
"Then, why do you have to do this?" Zen couldn't help but shake his head as he pitied the mental state of the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
"Shut up! I don't need your opinion!"
<br><br>
Swish! Splat! The Life-energy Graver just inflicted a second wound on Zen's body.
<br><br>
Splat! And a third one.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The brush-wielder continued to slash at Zen using the graver, but the ancestry-level bloodline started to gather more life energy in order to repair Zen's injuries.
<br><br>
This cycle continued for over five minutes on the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
The attacks of the graver became more and more ferocious, but at the same time, the rate of regeneration of the ancestry-level bloodline also became faster and faster.
<br><br>
"Damn it! Your body's already extremely sturdy, but it also has such formidable regeneration ability. Let's see how you handle this one though!"
<br><br>
Chapter 4269 Rescue (Part Two) Whoosh! In an instant, the aura of the Life-energy Graver became even sharper.
<br><br>
The overwhelming aura that it was emitting almost penetrated directly into the scroll.
<br><br>
Before the intense aura of the graver, Zen felt a shiver shot down his spine. His body started trembling as if telling him that he might not be able to withstand the next blow.
<br><br>
However, at this crucial moment, a flock of beasts from the scroll painting suddenly rushed over to them.
<br><br>
On one of the beasts sat a graceful woman. It turned out that she was actually the fox girl who lived in the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
As she reached Zen, the fox girl waved his fingers around him, and a hexagram array instantly enveloped him. When the array was completely formed, she immediately told Zen to get out of that place.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The moment that the array was activated, Zen's body was also released from the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
As he stood on the surface of the Eternal Scroll Painting in his normal form, he saw the huge face of the brush-wielder floating in the sky, along with his fast-approaching Life-energy Graver.
<br><br>
"What the hell have you done?! Are you out of your mind? Why did you save him?!"
<br><br>
The brush-wielder couldn't believe that the fox girl would betray him during such a critical moment.
<br><br>
Folding her arms over her chest, the fox girl stared coldly at the brushwielder and said, "I don't think you should be the one asking questions here. Why don't you answer my question first? What the hell are you really trying to do?"
<br><br>
At this point, the brush-wielder realized that the fox girl must have heard the earlier conversation between him and Zen.
<br><br>
However, he didn't have time to deal and argue with the fox girl right now.
<br><br>
His priority was to eliminate Zen as soon as he could.
<br><br>
But now that Zen was finally set free from the Eternal Scroll Painting, there was no way that he was going to stand idly and wait for the brushwielder to attack him again.
<br><br>
Just now, it seemed that he remained still as the sharp graver came right towards him. But when the graver was about to land on his body, his figure gradually blurred and turned into a shadow that eventually dissipated.
<br><br>
The next moment, the brush-wielder was shocked as Zen appeared in front of his face. "Well, it seems that she also doesn't agree with you," Zen said in a mocking tone.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! Right after finishing what he said, Zen suddenly threw a massive punch on the huge smiling face before him.
<br><br>
Then, the smiling face instantly disappeared and turned into a crying face.
<br><br>
As soon as the crying face emerged, Zen threw another punch at him again.
<br><br>
Smash! Boom! It was Zen's turn to launch his own strikes. He threw lightning-fast massive punches towards the brush-wielder's face, making it rapidly shift between the crying face and the smiling one. Soon enough, the huge face began to break apart, and the cracks quickly extended to all directions.
<br><br>
Generally, the brush-wielder was the one in charge of all the passageways leading to the secondary worlds, and his abilities were supposed to only serve this purpose. Thus, his fighting abilities were not that strong enough.
<br><br>
As he faced Zen, who was now able to exhibit all of his skills without restrictions, the brush-wielder definitely had no chance to fight back at all.
<br><br>
Floating above the Eternal Scroll painting, the fox girl displayed a conflicted expression across her beautiful face.
<br><br>
She was actually surprised that she had chosen to save Zen on a whim.
<br><br>
For countless years, she had been totally obedient to the brush-wielder because of her dream. She wished that one day, she would be able to return to the main world and regain her previous life.
<br><br>
With Zen's appearance, she thought that her dream was being slowly brought to reality. The brush-wielder was the one who told her that Zen was the key to completing their goals.
<br><br>
However, when she heard the conversation between Zen and the brushwielder earlier, the fox girl almost went mad.
<br><br>
She realized that all this time, she had been living in a lie. Her dream immediately shattered before her.
<br><br>
That was the reason why she chose to save and release Zen from the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
As Zen continued his menacing attacks, the cracks had completely covered the brush-wielder's face.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! Finally, the brush-wielder's face collapsed and broke into countless pieces.
<br><br>
The shattered pieces dropped onto the Eternal Scroll Painting and could no longer make any move.
<br><br>
After ensuring that he already vanquished the brush-wielder, Zen descended onto the Eternal Scroll Painting and slowly approached the fox girl.
<br><br>
"Thank you for saving me…" Zen cupped his hands towards her.
<br><br>
"No need to thank me. Just go ahead," the fox girl answered in an indifferent tone as she waved her hand, motioning for him to leave.
<br><br>
"Okay then." Zen nodded as he quickly walked towards the exit of the Eternal Scroll Painting. He needed to hurry now because he wasted so much time dealing with the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
But as he was about to step out of the Eternal Scroll Painting, the fox girl suddenly asked, "How confident are you that you can defeat the downgrader?"
<br><br>
Zen paused for a moment before he turned around, wearing a bitter smile on his face. "I actually don't have the confidence."
<br><br>
After the downgrader obtained the mighty sword that once belonged to the Cinnabar race, Zen couldn't even start imagining how powerful he already became.
<br><br>
"What?" The fox girl was almost rendered speechless, obviously dissatisfied with his answer. Even her charming face faded in an instant.
<br><br>
"Nonetheless, I'll still try my best."
<br><br>
Zen just smiled at her before he went straight to the exit of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Chapter 4270 Meeting With Zen After Zen's figure disappeared from the Eternal Scroll Painting, the fox girl remained where she stood without moving an inch as though she were paralyzed.
<br><br>
When she snapped out of it, she noticed a white light dot flickering above the void.
<br><br>
The fox girl's gaze followed the white dot of light as it floated above for a while before it finally slid down towards the exit of the Eternal Scroll Painting. She heaved a sigh of relief and then turned to look at the face that was bruised to the point of no recognition by Zen.
<br><br>
Confronted by Zen's fearsome relentless attack, the face of the brushwielder gave in and was smashed beyond repair.
<br><br>
"Master brush-wielder... are you alright?" the fox girl called out to him in a concerned voice.
<br><br>
As the words left her mouth, the pieces that once sprawled lifeless on the Eternal Scroll Painting regained their lost vitality and slowly crawled their way towards the face of the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
The brush-wielder raised his face carefully as though it were as delicate as porcelain.
<br><br>
At this moment, his face portrayed a strange calmness to it as he remained in his place without uttering a word. He was neither laughing nor crying.
<br><br>
"Please speak to me, Master brush-wielder. Are you alright?" the fox girl asked once again, her tone brimming with undying concern for him.
<br><br>
"I was born with the Eternal Scroll Painting. As long as it is not destroyed, I won't die. Don't worry. I'm fine," the brush-wielder replied. His tone showed no hints of anger when he addressed the fox girl after he recovered from his wounds.
<br><br>
"I wonder if we were able to deceive the downgrader just now..." The fox girl voiced her worried thoughts out loud.
<br><br>
"It shouldn't be a problem." The brush-wielder sighed softly.
<br><br>
Compared to the creatures of the third-grade and fourth-grade worlds, the brush-wielder held more knowledge about the boring life in the Wall World. Everything within that world was divided by length, and it was free from any sort of thickness. Even if there were any sort of life being born within the second-grade world after a long time, those lives would be proclaimed the weakest and the lowest of all lives present there.
<br><br>
In fact, the third-grade world was the lowest limit of life diversification. It was the Lower Extreme World after all, meaning it should be the lowestgrade world. If it continued to downgrade, the life it held within its borders would lose its sense of existence and the purpose attached to it.
<br><br>
The brush-wielder harbored deep-seated resentment for the second-grade world. But he was powerless against the downgrader, so the only option he was left with, was to cooperate with the fox girl to collectively play a trick on him.
<br><br>
"It seems the downgrader is cautious about Zen, so he must be afraid of him. Perhaps there is a chance that Zen will succeed," the fox girl said with her eyes glowing with hope.
<br><br>
Although Zen didn't give her a definite answer, the fox girl remained hopeful and pinned all her expectations on him.
<br><br>
The moment Zen left the Eternal Scroll Painting, countless dots of white light gathered and shot towards him.
<br><br>
Right now, Zen was completely surrounded and mesmerized by these light dots.
<br><br>
His ability to keep track of time and distance disappeared without a trace, rendering him helpless.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen had already anticipated this scenario, so he came prepared.
<br><br>
Before he could lose sight of everything, he contacted his inner world.
<br><br>
"Heavenly Obsession Civilization, are you ready?" Zen asked as he prepared himself.
<br><br>
If given a fair amount of time, coupled with the ancestry-level bloodline's ability, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization would have been fully replenished, or even more powerful compared to before.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the time it was granted was far too short to accomplish anything. It was also an extremely complicated task to construct the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
Even though the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had mastered the technology, they had only managed to build the core halfway.
<br><br>
To prove itself useful to Zen's cause, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization sealed the core forcibly. The moment it received Zen's message, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization responded to his call and began to operate rapidly.
<br><br>
"Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do this," the Heavenly Obsession Civilization replied back to Zen with confidence.
<br><br>
"I need your help to decipher it!"
<br><br>
"I'll do my best!"
<br><br>
As it spoke, a ray of green light suddenly began to hover over Zen's eyes, shrouding them in its influence.
<br><br>
The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization took control of Zen's eyes and ran his gaze, scanning each light dot one after the other to decipher their meaning. Once everything lay bare to it, it transferred the information gathered into Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
Because its ability to calculate didn't have enough time to fully restore itself, the process was slower than usual.
<br><br>
After five minutes of continuous repetition of this tedious process, a blurry picture revealed itself as it flashed before Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
He saw four chains extending in four respective directions, and he also witnessed four obscure pillars standing in the distance...
<br><br>
As this blurry scenery flashed before his eyes for a brief moment, Zen was able to faintly determine his whereabouts.
<br><br>
"This must be in the center of those four pillars! Geoffrey told me that he stays at the pillar on the north side...
<br><br>
I need to get there!"
<br><br>
Taking the help of the blurry picture alone wasn't enough for Zen to successfully make his way over the long chain.
<br><br>
However, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had a strong learning ability, which helped it to overcome any difficult task it was confronted with. It continued its vigorous attempts to explore the light dots. As a result, it successfully deciphered the rules behind their distribution. Soon, it picked up the pace and started restoring the scenes at a quicker rate, which made the picture clearer than before.
<br><br>
But it would still take some time before the picture was as clear as day to maneuver Zen's way to his destination without facing any difficulty...
<br><br>
After Zen entered the Eternal Scroll Painting from the exit of the passageway, the Human Spirit King, Kincaid, descended to Pear Hill once more.
<br><br>
He turned towards Rocher to relay his message to Geoffrey through the Lone Sword. "Your father is on his way to the main world. He should be able to reach the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. You can meet him there."
<br><br>
The information was crucial.
<br><br>
It was because it was inconvenient for Zen to move as freely as Geoffrey could in the main world.
<br><br>
It was better to let Geoffrey await Zen's arrival at the exit than for Zen to look for him instead.
<br><br>
After hearing the message, Ziya wasted no time to run frantically towards Geoffrey and stood before him. "We should head to the Eternal Divine Courtyard immediately. Your father is supposed to meet you out there."
<br><br>
Geoffrey remained calm as he kept his eyes closed and kept his breathing steady. He took his time to accumulate all his strength to prepare himself to meet Zen.
<br><br>
This body was entrusted to him by the Levitation Tower. So it should be the most powerful body in the entirety of Deep Space with a solid recovery ability.
<br><br>
His body and soul suffered from exhaustion after being overexerted, but after he rested for quite a while, they began to show signs of recovery.
<br><br>
Geoffrey only hoped the downgrader would not show up soon.
<br><br>
Luckily, the main world was exceedingly large, so it would be hard for the downgrader to pinpoint Geoffrey's location at the holy pillar.
<br><br>
After hearing what Ziya had said, Geoffrey opened his eyes slightly and asked, "Really? Are you sure?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I am!" Ziya exclaimed, unable to mask his feelings.
<br><br>
"Alright. Take me there..."
<br><br>
As soon as Geoffrey declared his wish, his eyes fell on a creature flying over from afar, painted in several appealing colors. It was none other than the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
Although it was Geoffrey's first time witnessing the Starry Roc-fish in the flesh, he immediately sensed from its demeanor that the beautiful fish was seeking them out! Although the pillar under their feet was very wide, the surface of the pillar was quite bare. They were unable to dodge or hide.
<br><br>
As the Starry Roc-fish continued to close in on them, Geoffrey was suddenly struck with an idea. He grabbed the Heavenly Ring Staff and put it into Ziya's hand before he exclaimed, "Use this to let it hide us! Hurry up, we don't have much time!"
<br><br>
Ziya's powerful ability might have been insufficient when trying to dispose of the Starry Roc-fish. However, making use of a small hiding method seemed to be not that difficult.
<br><br>
Ziya was surprisingly quick to react. He had seen how Geoffrey used the Heavenly Ring Staff before. Therefore he encountered no difficulty in wielding it. After taking it, he raised the Heavenly Rising Staff and yelled out, "Hide us!"
<br><br>
As soon as he voiced his command, Ziya felt the energy from his inner world gush out uncontrollably.
<br><br>
When a small-scale hiding technique was put to use, his inner world went through dramatic changes as almost half of the energy was drained from it.
<br><br>
But the effect was surprisingly effective! A faint net of light veiled their bodies and suppressed their auras as though they were never there.
<br><br>
As soon as they were hidden from the naked eye, the Starry Roc-fish flew over from afar till it reached where they stood.
<br><br>
"Woo...
<br><br>
Goo..."
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish lowered its head to try to get a whiff of their auras but failed at its attempt. After searching unsuccessfully for a while, it moved on to the next holy pillar.
<br><br>
"Master Ziya, we must hurry and head to the Eternal Divine Courtyard. It will be bad if that fish reaches my father before us," Geoffrey said, relaying his concerns to Ziya.
<br><br>
The two of them didn't resort to flying in fear of the Starry Roc-fish locating them. They could only climb along the extended chain.
<br><br>
Fortunately, they were able to move quickly along the chain.
<br><br>
Chapter 4271 Magnetic Light Extreme Form The Starry Roc-fish swam around the four pillars, searching earnestly.
<br><br>
It had initially only planned to exhaust Geoffrey's strength.
<br><br>
It figured this was the most efficient way to deal with him and Ziya. Ziya would have been easy pickings after that.
<br><br>
But the Starry Roc-fish hadn't expected Geoffrey to use Grand Teleportation to escape.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish could detect objects using the aura of space, but the Heavenly Ring Staff was obviously shielding Geoffrey and Ziya. It took some time for the Starry Roc-fish's echolocation ability to lead it toward the general direction of the pillars.
<br><br>
It began to sense Geoffrey and Ziya in the area as soon as it approached.
<br><br>
But suddenly, the two became undetectable again.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish had such keen senses that it could see the energy emanating from everything in the world, including from dead people. It could easily pick up on energy fluctuations, too.
<br><br>
Avoiding its detection like this would usually require those in hiding to block all external energy auras and stop emitting auras themselves.
<br><br>
Suffice to say, that was a near impossible feat.
<br><br>
That was why the Starry Roc-fish concluded Geoffrey and Ziya must be using the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
It was likely why the Starry Roc-fish couldn't find them now.
<br><br>
But it had to, all the same. It couldn't disobey the downgrader's orders.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish emitted a long wailing sound.
<br><br>
The sound waves bounced back from surfaces, allowing the Starry Rocfish to determine the shape of its surroundings, including those concealed.
<br><br>
The sound waves washed through a vast area. But it still failed to pick up on Geoffrey and Ziya.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish figured it must be looking in the wrong area.
<br><br>
It turned to go.
<br><br>
Just then, a door suddenly opened above the Eternal Divine Courtyard. A white light emanated from the doorway.
<br><br>
The light began to flash, and the voice of the downgrader piped up directly in the Starry Roc-fish's mind, "Wait there!"
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish didn't know what it had to wait for, but it couldn't refuse. It hovered in place for a moment.
<br><br>
Soon, it saw a person being dropped from above. The person landed on the roof of the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
The white light flashed again. "Give it your all and kill him!" the downgrader commanded.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish was left a little puzzled at that.
<br><br>
The human in front of it looked extremely weak. He seemed to be just a third-grade creature who had not even undergone the Red Jade Rite. It didn't look like it would take much to kill him.
<br><br>
But the Starry Roc-fish just did what it was told.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! Five-colored lightning bolts started swirling around the Starry Roc-fish's sharp head.
<br><br>
The more bolts there were, the more powerful the force became.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish emitted the echolocation sound again to lock in on its target. It released the lightning.
<br><br>
All this time, Geoffrey and Ziya had been arching their backs and running on the chain, hiding successfully from the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
They had heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the Starry Roc-fish turn to leave, but felt confused when it had suddenly stopped in place, as if waiting for something.
<br><br>
That was when they saw the door open and Zen drop down like a corpse.
<br><br>
"Father!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't help but hiss urgently as he saw the Starry Roc-fish preparing to zap Zen.
<br><br>
Crack! The five-colored lightning enveloped Zen completely.
<br><br>
The light bloomed over the entire courtyard.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish was not worried that the Eternal Divine Courtyard would be destroyed. It was, after all, under the Time Lock.
<br><br>
It did feel, however, that using the five-colored lightning on a barely conscious human was a bit too much. It would have chosen a milder technique had the downgrader not directed it to use maximum force.
<br><br>
The five-colored lightning exploded in one blow then died down quickly.
<br><br>
But the blinding light cleared up only to reveal the man completely unharmed.
<br><br>
"I told you to give it your all! Even the brush-wielder couldn't do much damage!" The downgrader's voice chastised the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish was surprised to hear that. The brush-wielder wasn't that powerful, but as the ruler of the Eternal Scroll Painting, he was omnipotent there.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish took on a more resolute attitude. "Alright, then."
<br><br>
The five-colored lightning appeared around its head again. But this time, the colors were much deeper, the energy contained therein much stronger.
<br><br>
Zen started to come around. Even in a state of unconsciousness, he had still felt that powerful jolt of force.
<br><br>
Fortunately, his body had been strong enough to withstand it.
<br><br>
The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization was now working on overdrive to assess his surroundings. Zen saw a colorful roc-fish floating in the sky. He felt like he had seen it before.
<br><br>
"It's the Starry Roc-fish!"
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish had not been hostile to him the first time he had met it in the Soul City, so Zen figured the downgrader probably had something to do with why the creature was attacking him now.
<br><br>
As the Starry Roc-fish was charging up for a second strike, Zen staggered back to his feet.
<br><br>
Were it not for the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization, Zen probably wouldn't be able to do this. After all, it took Ziya many chaotic eras before he succeeded at this.
<br><br>
Zen's mind raced as he thought of ways to be able to deflect the looming attack even in his disoriented condition.
<br><br>
The deep-colored lightning bolts were now heading for Zen.
<br><br>
"Just die already!" the Starry Roc-fish said.
<br><br>
Before the lightning could hit Zen, however, thin metal strands sprouted all over his body, forming a cage around him.
<br><br>
The metal strands deflected the lightning bolts and sent them crackling throughout the Eternal Divine Courtyard instead. Zen was once again left unharmed.
<br><br>
"What was that?"
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish was stunned.
<br><br>
No one had ever dodged its lightning strikes like that before! "If that doesn't work, let's try the Magnetic Light Extreme Form, then."
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish flicked its tail. Two thin rays of light spiraled toward Zen.
<br><br>
The Magnetic Light Extreme Form was not organic to the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
It actually came from the downgrader's theurgy and the power of the Deep Space.
<br><br>
The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been accurate thus far in its analyses of this situation.
<br><br>
That was why when Zen saw the light rays, his first reaction was to run.
<br><br>
But he was still unsteady on his feet. His first steps forward were clumsy, making him an easy target. One of the light rays pierced through his arm, the other through his foot.
<br><br>
The body parts that the light rays hit were quickly turned into pure energy and absorbed.
<br><br>
It made quick work of Zen.
<br><br>
In a flash, he had lost a hand and a foot.
<br><br>
The light rays now rapidly began to spread from Zen's limbs to his torso.
<br><br>
"Father!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey cried out in panic, completely forgetting he was supposed to be in hiding.
<br><br>
Zen's entire body would soon be turned into pure energy at this rate! Chapter 4272 Sacrifice Zen couldn't hear Geoffrey's shout.
<br><br>
All his senses within the main world relied on the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. But this core hadn't absorbed this sound, which was why Zen couldn't hear it.
<br><br>
Two thin rays of light began to magnetize his shoulders and the other leg, the magnetized energy being quickly absorbed by them.
<br><br>
It felt to him as if he had been bitten by an invisible monster that would soon gobble him up in a few bites.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's shout exposed he and Ziya's position.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish noticed the two people on the chain of Time Lock. Its huge eyes emitted a ray of blue light that formed a space wall in front of these two people.
<br><br>
"Break it!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey roared.
<br><br>
His physical strength had recovered a little, but he was largely in a state of exhaustion. However, he still managed to use all his strength to hit the space wall.
<br><br>
Bang! The power of this punch only caused the space wall to shake slightly. All power had left him.
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack, crack...
<br><br>
Ziya, staying behind Geoffrey, pulled out the God Lashing Whip and attacked the wall with all his strength.
<br><br>
The shadows of the golden whip were like raindrops that came crashing down, but the space wall did not budge one bit. The wall was tougher than they had anticipated.
<br><br>
After a series of futile attacks, Ziya grabbed Geoffrey, intending to jump over the space wall. But the moment he dragged Geoffrey towards the edge, the light in the eyes of the Starry Roc-fish began to flicker, more and more space walls appearing. The space walls closed up, forming a closed space that blocked them.
<br><br>
Helpless in the face of this blockade, Ziya had no choice but to bring Geoffrey back to the chain.
<br><br>
"Father!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey continued to shout through the transparent space wall. His heart broke as he watched Zen's body slowly turn into pure energy.
<br><br>
Ziya's face darkened. Everything would be over if they were to be trapped here forever.
<br><br>
The white light dot, which represented the will of the downgrader, suddenly drew a thin line and drilled into the body of the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
The situation had been under control when the downgrader had begun to take control of the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
And since there had been no room for resistance, the Starry Roc-fish had easily submitted itself to the downgrader.
<br><br>
Once its soul had finally landed and the downgrader had gained complete control of the Starry Roc-fish, he said loudly, "You've done it! You've really done it! I'm surprised.
<br><br>
I wondered if there was a slim chance.
<br><br>
But you have really brought back the Heavenly Ring Staff from the Deep Space! Good job! However, I have to take back the Heavenly Ring Staff. You've only helped me get it back. I can now defeat you, which saves me a lot of trouble."
<br><br>
Saying thus, he began to laugh.
<br><br>
Ziya's eyes lit up at the mention of the Heavenly Ring Staff and were focused on it.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had run out of energy now, while Ziya's energy level was low.
<br><br>
The only person who could use the power of the Heavenly Ring Staff was Zen.
<br><br>
He had the complete ancestry-level bloodline in his body, which was also why Geoffrey had gone looking for the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
At this, a bold idea came to Ziya's mind.
<br><br>
He couldn't exert the power of the Heavenly Ring Staff, but could he send it to Zen? Ziya knew it was a fleeting opportunity, given how Zen's body had become magnetized and was being devoured little by little.
<br><br>
He reached out and grabbed the Heavenly Ring Staff from Geoffrey's hand. Ziya barked an order under Geoffrey's astonished gaze. "Send us there!"
<br><br>
Once he finished speaking, the energy in his inner world began to be constantly extracted.
<br><br>
His inner world had been operating for a long time and had long formed a complete small world.
<br><br>
Even though the Heavenly Ring Staff had already extracted half his energy, the inner world had still not suffered too much loss. But Ziya was beyond caring now. In addition to the inner world's energy, he also had the energy of the three Other Shore Tokens in the inner world.
<br><br>
Employing the spatial transference in the Abstruse Energy World consumed a great deal of energy. The remaining half of the energy in Ziya's inner world had been absorbed, and the Other Shore Tokens had also become dim. It was still not enough to feed the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
"Is this distance too long for you?"
<br><br>
Ziya gritted his teeth and made a move, causing the three Other Shore Tokens in his inner world to start burning.
<br><br>
Splash...
<br><br>
Although these Other Shore Tokens were not Holy Items, they were, nevertheless, top-level Other Shore Tokens. They were all connected to the top parts of the holy pillars.
<br><br>
When these Other Shore Tokens began to burn, three chains suddenly shone brightly.
<br><br>
Burning the Other Shore Tokens was a form of overuse. It could take more energy from the holy pillars in a short period of time, while at the same time, it could lead to a punishment that was worse than death.
<br><br>
Ziya was saddened when he heard from Geoffrey about the suffering that the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others had faced. His master and the other human heroes had the same level of awareness. How could he be afraid of death? Energy gushed out of the three burning Other Shore Tokens like water at high tide.
<br><br>
When ordinary people had burned the Other Shore Tokens, there had always been a great movement since the violent energy was difficult to control. But the Heavenly Ring Staff in Ziya's hand could completely absorb the violent energy. Thus, Ziya looked calm.
<br><br>
Geoffrey finally sensed that something was wrong. "Master Ziya, what are you doing?"
<br><br>
Ziya remained silent. His life force was fading away after he had burned the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
His normally bright eyes dimmed, fatigue quickly overtaking him.
<br><br>
It was at this time that the blue light began to flash on the surface of the Heavenly Ring Staff, wrapping Ziya and Geoffrey within it. They disappeared from their spots and in the next moment, appeared beside Zen.
<br><br>
With the last of his energy, Ziya stuffed the Heavenly Ring Staff into Zen's palm.
<br><br>
"It all depends on you..."
<br><br>
Ziya had barely finished speaking when the skin on his face cracked, and the dry muscles began to roll up. His bones withered and shattered, which was a counterattack from the holy pillars.
<br><br>
The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization transmitted this scene to Zen, who panicked as he held the Heavenly Ring Staff in his hand. He couldn't understand why Ziya would suddenly collapse like this.
<br><br>
Although the Heavenly Ring Staff had already fallen into Zen's hands, Zen couldn't use it at the moment. Neither his spiritual sense nor his voice could be transmitted within the main world.
<br><br>
Seeing his father stunned as he was, Geoffrey, without caring about the consequences, rushed up and grabbed the Heavenly Ring Staff before shouting, "No matter what method you use, please protect us! You can absorb as much energy as you want in my father's body!"
<br><br>
He didn't know if it would work.
<br><br>
After all, the Heavenly Ring Staff would only listen to the holder's orders.
<br><br>
Geoffrey began to worry when the Heavenly Ring Staff began to frantically absorb Zen's energy at an astonishing speed.
<br><br>
With such a high speed of absorption, an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior wouldn't be able to hold on even for about two seconds.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline that Zen possessed provided him with an endless energy. After the Heavenly Ring Staff had absorbed enough energy, a halo flashed on top of the staff, within which countless hexagons were released, enveloping Zen and Geoffrey.
<br><br>
As the hexagonal enchanted barriers spread out, they also cut off the thin light rays of the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
The downgrader, who had already controlled the Starry Roc-fish's body and was speaking slowly, hadn't expected Ziya to hand the Heavenly Ring Staff to Zen in such a short time. He didn't know what had happened until the enchanted barriers had unfurled completely.
<br><br>
Chapter 4273 Counterattack As soon as the thin streaks of light released from the Magnetic Light Extreme Form were cut off, the magnetic energy immediately stopped.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline began continuously transferring the energy from the life quadrant. This was done to compensate for Zen's incomplete body.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the newly regrown flesh and bones were not as good as before. Nevertheless, Zen had to make do with it for now.
<br><br>
Even though his body had somewhat recovered, everything was still a blur to him. He did not quite understand what just happened.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Obsession Civilization's core was able to help Zen decipher Sanskrit words. It even helped him decipher the scenes from the main world. However, he was still unable to understand everything clearly.
<br><br>
Geoffrey saw that his father was still in a daze. Because of that, he gave another order to the Heavenly Ring Staff, "Help him with the Soul Reincarnation. Do as we did before. Extract the energy from him!"
<br><br>
With that, Zen heard a swishing sound.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey gave his command, the Heavenly Ring Staff carried out the order surprisingly fast.
<br><br>
Soon after, Zen saw the Heavenly Ring Staff flash before Geoffrey pointed to his head. At this moment, he was still utterly befuddled. In just a split second, he felt an intense pain that almost shattered his soul.
<br><br>
The pain one would feel from the Soul Reincarnation was truly indescribable. In simple terms, it was like breaking and reorganizing the original soul. It was an excruciatingly painful kind of suffering. It was already a miracle that Elder Xue was able to reach that high in the Levitation Tower.
<br><br>
When the pain finally stopped, Zen slowly opened his eyes. He couldn't believe what he was seeing.
<br><br>
The scenes that were flashing before his eyes earlier were no longer presented by the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. All at once, everything became clear to him.
<br><br>
At that moment, he heard Geoffrey's voice. "Father! Are you alright? How do you feel?" Geoffrey was thoroughly relieved that his father finally came to his senses.
<br><br>
"I... What happened to me?" Zen stared at his hands in shock. This was quite unbelievable! "You have undergone the Soul Reincarnation. So now, you can move freely in the Abstruse Energy World!" Geoffrey looked at him and smiled.
<br><br>
"Wait... What happened to Master Ziya just now? He was just right here a moment ago." Zen looked around because this scenery felt unreal to him.
<br><br>
He had no idea what exactly just happened. He wondered why Ziya suddenly disappeared from their midst.
<br><br>
"The Heavenly Ring Staff requires a massive amount of energy to absorb.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Master Ziya didn't have enough. He might have just burnt his Other Shore Tokens," Geoffrey responded with a sad look on his eyes.
<br><br>
Not once had he ever stepped foot on the Other Shore. Yet, he still knew a lot about the Other Shore Tokens. It was fairly obvious to him that Ziya had been punished by burning the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
"He burnt his Other Shore Tokens?!"
<br><br>
The powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm regarded this method as their last resort. Zen didn't expect that Ziya would be so stubborn.
<br><br>
He was still in a state of shock when a blinding flash of light suddenly illuminated the entire sky.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish was floating above. At once, the spiral lights began gathering in its open mouth.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the Starry Roc-fish shouted, "Magnetic Light Extreme Form. Magnetic energy impact!"
<br><br>
They heard strange buzzing sounds around them.
<br><br>
The spiral lights whirled rapidly in circles down from the air. All at once, they began to attack the hexagonal enchanted barrier above Zen and Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Clang! Clang! Clang! The spiral lights bombarded the barrier one after another.
<br><br>
The sound of the spiral lights crashing onto the enchanted barrier was like a woodpecker eagerly picking away at a tree trunk.
<br><br>
The magnetic energy's destructive force was truly astonishing. By now, the surface of the enchanted barrier had been dented by this barrage of attacks. Little by little, cracks began to form.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Heavenly Ring Staff was under Zen's control. The ancestry-level bloodline was continuously replenishing its energy. The dented and broken enchanted barrier was quickly restored to its original state. There was no amount of outside energy that could break it.
<br><br>
"The Polygon Extreme Form is indeed one of the most powerful defensive methods. However, the Magnetic Light Extreme Form will be enough to restrain you! Let me see how much longer you can hold out!" The Starry Roc-fish taunted them and increased its attacks.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Once again they heard a strange buzzing sound.
<br><br>
The downgrader had immensely amplified the Starry Roc-fish's power.
<br><br>
At that point, the spiral lights became denser. Their collision with the polygonal enchanted barrier, also known as the Polygon Extreme Form, had a strong impact.
<br><br>
He knew that Zen had the ancestry-level bloodline and almost endless supply of energy. Nonetheless, he wanted to break the enchanted barrier with the help of the Magnetic Light Extreme Form. Moreover, he wanted to kill Zen and Geoffrey within the enchanted barrier.
<br><br>
Clang! Clang! Clang! Once more, the barrier was bombarded with the spiral lights.
<br><br>
The enchanted barrier endured more pressure. It was a good thing that the ancestry-level bloodline worked exceptionally well with the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
With an almost bottomless supply of energy, any cracks that appeared would be instantly repaired. Therefore, they could easily block the Starry Roc-fish's energy.
<br><br>
"Again! Don't stop until that barrier is completely shattered!"
<br><br>
The downgrader really pushed the Starry Roc-fish's power to its limit.
<br><br>
The real Starry Roc-fish curled into a ball within the downgrader's mind.
<br><br>
It was at a loss for words when it saw what the downgrader did. If the downgrader hadn't taken the time to speak to them slowly, it would have already killed these people. He wouldn't have to exert so much effort now.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish was made out of pure energy. The energy within its body had been accumulated for countless years. But now, the downgrader released all its acquired energy all at once. The Starry Roc-fish felt utterly crest-fallen.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! When the downgrader pushed its power beyond its limits, the five colored lights quickly dimmed. Moreover, the magnetic energy impact became erratic and broken.
<br><br>
"What?! What just happened?!" the downgrader shouted confusedly.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, all my stored energy has been used up." The Starry Rocfish sounded dejected and distressed.
<br><br>
"You are worthless!" the downgrader cursed in anger.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, it was obvious that using the Starry Roc-fish against the ancestry-level bloodline was impractical. He failed to prevent Zen from obtaining the Heavenly Ring Staff. Therefore, he was thoroughly frustrated and furious.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the dimmed Starry Roc-fish. With that, the corners of his mouth curled upwards. "Well, then. It's time for our counterattack."
<br><br>
He raised the Heavenly Ring Staff and made a gesture. Embarrassed, he lowered the staff and turned around. "How do I use the Heavenly Ring Staff?" he asked Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Just give it orders. It can easily understand," Geoffrey answered.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Zen nodded. He raised the Heavenly Ring Staff once more and firmly said, "Kill it!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, they heard a loud swishing sound.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Ring Staff began to absorb a massive amount of energy.
<br><br>
It was just like that particular sword. The stronger its bearer was, the more power it could unleash.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the ancestry-level bloodline could supply it with boundless energy. Therefore, the Heavenly Ring Staff was allowed to display its maximum power.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! The Heavenly Ring Staff released a flash of light. In an instant, dark red cones gathered above Zen's head. As soon as these cones appeared, they immediately soared towards the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The cones were flying at a breakneck speed. They could easily reach their target.
<br><br>
The Starry Roc-fish noticed that the situation was not favorable. Thus, its soul regained control of its body immediately. With a wave of its tail, it turned around and decided to flee.
<br><br>
The downgrader didn't stop it. After all, it was entirely his fault that they got into this pinch.
<br><br>
However, it was far too late for the Starry Roc-fish to escape.
<br><br>
Those dark red cones looked a little ordinary. But as a matter of fact, they were created through the Pure Energy Extreme Form. Their speed was even faster than that of the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Simultaneously, the cones found their target.
<br><br>
Dozens of cones shot into the Starry Roc-fish's body.
<br><br>
With regards to its enormous size, the cones were just as small as thin needles.
<br><br>
At first, the Starry Roc-fish hoped that the cones weren't too powerful.
<br><br>
But when the first cone exploded, it immediately knew that it was doomed.
<br><br>
From afar, Geoffrey and Zen watched the Starry Roc-fish. It looked like a ball that expanded dozens of times before it cracked and blossomed into a colorful firework.
<br><br>
In the end, the dot of white light that belonged to the downgrader was unable to escape. It was annihilated along with the Starry Roc-fish.
<br><br>
Chapter 4274 Removing The Curse The shock waves spreading across the sky didn't dissipate for a long time.
<br><br>
The heat contained in these shock waves was astonishing, causing Zen and Geoffrey to feel like they were baking in the sun.
<br><br>
"The attack seemed ordinary but its power is so terrifying! I didn't know the Heavenly Ring Staff was this powerful!"
<br><br>
Zen originally wanted to say that the Heavenly Ring Staff was more powerful than the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
But on second thought, he felt it was not right.
<br><br>
Both of them could make full use of the power in the Deep Space, but the difference was that the Heavenly Ring Staff was more intelligent.
<br><br>
There was also a spirit within the irregular heavy sword that wasn't as intelligent. Even the downgrader had managed to bewitch it.
<br><br>
Not only could the Heavenly Ring Staff understand human language, it could also make appropriate judgments and release the Polygon Extreme Form and the Pure Energy Extreme Form when needed.
<br><br>
Could it be that the spirit inside had retained its memory? Zen's thoughts were whirling.
<br><br>
"The Heavenly Ring Staff is powerful, but I'm not weak either!" Geoffrey said, thumping his chest.
<br><br>
Only then did Zen's gaze focus on Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Right now, Geoffrey was twenty feet tall, like a small giant. His strength had been completely exhausted but he exuded a rich vitality, his every move vigorous. Zen had never seen such a perfect body before.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey, what has happened to make you so powerful?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, surprised.
<br><br>
Not considering the Treacherous Beings, Zen's body, which had been tempered by the ancestry-level bloodline, was the strongest.
<br><br>
But Zen was dwarfed in comparison with Geoffrey, despite being Geoffrey's father.
<br><br>
He had been very clear about Geoffrey's strength before he had set out on this 'quest'. It was difficult for Zen to imagine the kind of method that could enable Geoffrey to make such rapid progress.
<br><br>
"It's not just the body!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey laughed, releasing the last bit of soul force inside him.
<br><br>
His soul was at the top level in the Deep Space. Although the power had been obtained pretty easily and it needed to be further honed, the aura alone that the soul had released was terrifying.
<br><br>
Zen was stunned. But before long, his face lit up. "I hadn't expected you to improve your power so greatly on this trip!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey's head lifted proudly at his father's praise. He didn't have to live under his father's glory any longer.
<br><br>
They didn't remain in the main world for long.
<br><br>
On the one hand, time was precious. On the other hand, he was afraid that the downgrader would cause them more trouble.
<br><br>
They collected Ziya's cremains before they returned.
<br><br>
If it hadn't been for Ziya's sacrifice at the critical moment, the situation would have turned into something completely different.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's eyes misted as they collected Ziya's cremains. Ziya had been the only one to accompany him when he was exploring the world. He was sad to see Ziya die.
<br><br>
"Us humans have lived through a thousand eras just to win this fight.
<br><br>
Everyone should be ready to sacrifice, be it Ziya, me, or those human heroes. You have now undergone a complete transformation. You must have the will to sacrifice yourself," Zen said seriously, noting the emotion on Geoffrey's face.
<br><br>
No father was willing to sacrifice their children, no matter how noble the course they were pursuing.
<br><br>
But they were now facing a life and death situation. All creatures in the third-grade world had no choice but to fight.
<br><br>
Saying thus, Zen patted Geoffrey on the shoulder.
<br><br>
"Let's go."
<br><br>
Geoffrey collected himself, schooling his features, his young face looking mature.
<br><br>
He followed Zen into the door without a word. They then returned to the passageway in the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
According to the rules of the passage, they would turn into a picture after entering the painting.
<br><br>
Before long, Zen and Geoffrey were standing on the Eternal Scroll Painting. Zen looked down to discover a hexagram array set at the door.
<br><br>
This was probably arranged by the fox girl.
<br><br>
It was the first time that Geoffrey had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
He looked curiously at the white paper beneath his feet, and then at the empty surroundings.
<br><br>
"Let's go quickly before something happens," Zen said as a warning.
<br><br>
As they passed through the Eternal Scroll Painting, neither the fox girl nor the brush-wielder appeared.
<br><br>
They arrived at the end of the scroll and pushed the door open, entering it and returning to the passageway that belonged to the Bold Conjecture House.
<br><br>
Hilario, Kincaid, Dorothy, and the group of long-haired monsters were all waiting at the entrance to the passageway.
<br><br>
Dorothy's face looked like it was covered with a layer of ice and snow; so cold was the expression she wore on it.
<br><br>
Kincaid, on the other hand, sat beside his daughter, smiling. He had irritated his daughter, thus he was given a cold shoulder.
<br><br>
It was obvious that Dorothy would never forgive her father if Zen didn't return safely to her. .
<br><br>
The iron door creaked before it was suddenly pushed open.
<br><br>
And then, Zen and Geoffrey emerged from the door.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Kincaid, and Hilario shot to their feet.
<br><br>
"I didn't fail you," Zen said, raising the Heavenly Ring Staff in his hand.
<br><br>
To Dorothy, the Heavenly Ring Staff was a piece of wood and she didn't take it seriously. She merely threw herself into Zen's arms.
<br><br>
Geoffrey stepped out of the door, shrugging helplessly at the scene unfolding before him.
<br><br>
Kincaid, Hilario, and the other long-haired monsters stared at the Heavenly Ring Staff in excitement. They hoped that this staff could remove the curse that had been cast on them.
<br><br>
Zen obviously noticed their expressions. He slowly broke apart from Dorothy but didn't let her go as he said to the Heavenly Ring Staff, "Remove the curse on them!".
<br><br>
With a deafening buzz, the Heavenly Ring Staff absorbed the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
To Zen's surprise, it needed a lot of energy to remove the curse.
<br><br>
Dark green dots of light floated in the passageway one after another. The hair on the bodies of these people and their figures began to change, their hands slowly shortening and their appearance returning to that of ordinary humans.
<br><br>
"Ah!"
<br><br>
Dorothy screamed and turned around, covering her eyes.
<br><br>
The clothes of these human spirits had decayed a long time ago, and their hair had covered their bodies over these past years. But now that the curse had been lifted, they were all stark naked.
<br><br>
Zen was also embarrassed. He immediately activated the Truth of ThreeEnergy Construction and created some clothes for them.
<br><br>
These human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House had been living in the form of long-haired monsters for countless years. Now that they had been restored to the human spirits, they played around, touched their own faces, and poked others' buttocks, as excited as children. The passageway was filled with laughter and noise.
<br><br>
Kincaid understood their feelings and did not stop them.
<br><br>
Geoffrey, on the other hand, was staring at Dorothy, a puzzled expression in his eyes. It seemed that there was something he couldn't figure out.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey, what's wrong?" Zen asked, unable to understand why Geoffrey was reacting thus.
<br><br>
"I've seen a person who looks just like her, a splitting image of her!" said Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Really?" Zen relaxed, not taking it seriously. "Maybe it's just a coincidence?"
<br><br>
There were hundreds of billions of people in the world. It was possible that a lot of people looked alike. One would be able to find someone from the primitive land who looked just like Dorothy.
<br><br>
But Kincaid asked, "Where did you see the person?"
<br><br>
"In the chaos. She is embedded in the wall of chaos. Her entire body can't move. Moreover, she carries a Holy Item. I saw her through the light ray of that Holy Item," Geoffrey said.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Kincaid's expression changed dramatically.
<br><br>
Zen also realized that something was wrong.
<br><br>
If a woman embedded in the wall of chaos looked very much like Dorothy, he was afraid that it was not, after all, a coincidence.
<br><br>
Chapter 4275 Buds Kincaid stared at Geoffrey and pursued the matter further. "Is the Holy Item the Evil Bead?"
<br><br>
"The Evil Bead?" Geoffrey grew pensive for a moment and replied, "I'm not certain of that, but it resembled a round piece of metal."
<br><br>
"Was there anything unusual about her facial features?" Kincaid questioned further.
<br><br>
"Her facial features..." As he tried to remember all that he had seen, Geoffrey suddenly clapped his hands as he exclaimed, "Now I recall, I think she had frightening eyes, and they were slitted like those of a snake!"
<br><br>
The snake eyes were the most striking feature of that woman.
<br><br>
Upon hearing what Geoffrey said, Kincaid suddenly fell silent, while Hilario silently let out a sigh beside him.
<br><br>
"Dad, who is that woman?" Dorothy asked. She could tell from Kincaid's earlier emotions as well as his sudden silence that he knew without any doubt who the woman was. She wanted to get the answer from him.
<br><br>
"She's your mother," Kincaid answered in a somewhat bitter voice.
<br><br>
"My mother?" Dorothy asked in confusion. "If she is my mother, why is she imprisoned in the wall of the chaos?"
<br><br>
"In the past, her father had defeated us all. I believed she was dead back then. Now, it appears that her father showed mercy to her. Her imprisonment in the wall of the chaos must be her father's punishment,"
<br><br>
Kincaid slowly explained.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Zen, and Geoffrey were all momentarily stunned by his words.
<br><br>
Zen was the first to figure it out, and he said, "Is her father the Snake Spirit King, Cornelius?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Kincaid admitted. "She is Cornelius' daughter, Itzel."
<br><br>
Although the Four Spirits Sect was an entity, the four sects were comprised from different races, and each hailed from their own ancestral lands. Their lifestyles varied greatly from each other.
<br><br>
Normally, a snake spirit had a large number of offspring, and competition among them was extremely cruel.
<br><br>
Cornelius was reputed to have hundreds of thousands of children, but most of them had died before they reached adulthood. The cause of their death was mainly the fierce internal family strife, and only those who were strong enough to survive were considered deserving enough to be Cornelius' descendants.
<br><br>
Compared with his other children, Itzel had led a charmed life.
<br><br>
In the past, the Bold Conjecture House had required the study of the bloodlines of the four leaders' children. Technically, the leaders only required one of their children to give blood.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King had instead sent them an egg.
<br><br>
After Itzel's hatching, the Bold Conjecture House had wanted to return her, but the Snake Spirit Sect had become indifferent to her fate. They had then allowed the Human Spirit Sect to deal with her as they pleased.
<br><br>
Following that, Itzel was raised in the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
Compared to her several hundred thousand siblings, Itzel was therefore undoubtedly much luckier. She grew up in a relatively stable environment.
<br><br>
She performed well there and showed a willingness to accept the human spirits' culture.
<br><br>
She didn't like her original identity as a snake spirit. Therefore, the Bold Conjecture House had helped her to assume a human body and turned her into a beautiful human spirit.
<br><br>
The only mark that could prove her original relationship with the snake spirits was the golden crescent-shaped pupils in her attractive eyes, which was a typical feature of snake spirits.
<br><br>
With the abilities of the Bold Conjecture House, it was a small matter to remove the snake pupils for her. Once those were removed, nobody would know that she was actually a snake spirit. However, she had insisted on keeping her snake pupils as a reminder of where she came from.
<br><br>
Cornelius had never cared for Itzel, and he had almost forgotten that he actually had a daughter who lived within the Human Spirit Sect.
<br><br>
It wasn't until Kincaid and Itzel fell in love that Cornelius recognized his daughter through her snake pupils. Discovering the truth, he had opposed their relationship vehemently. This was the first breach of trust between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Human Spirit Sect. At that point, Kincaid had given the Snake Spirit King a king's ransom in exchange for his compromise.
<br><br>
As a result, the Snake Spirit Sect had never mentioned this matter again, and Cornelius had disowned Itzel as his daughter.
<br><br>
"Her father is the Snake Spirit King… So, my mother is a snake spirit..."
<br><br>
Dorothy muttered to herself.
<br><br>
Kincaid stared at her and gently asked, "Does this fact disgust you?"
<br><br>
In fact, he had questioned Dorothy about this in her previous life.
<br><br>
However, he wanted to confirm her answer once again.
<br><br>
"Why? She is my mother, after all. What does that have to do with her identity?" Dorothy observed in confusion. "I think our focus should now be on where my mother is trapped in the chaos and whether we can save her," she added.
<br><br>
Kincaid flashed a relieved expression at her answer and replied firmly, "Of course! We must rescue her."
<br><br>
Dorothy's positive attitude towards her mother was good news for Kincaid, and he was obviously most satisfied by it.
<br><br>
Zen was able to leave the passageway immediately by reciting the Illusion Breaking Rune.
<br><br>
However, Dorothy and Kincaid were left with no option other than to enter the primitive land through a process of descent.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's options were even more complicated.
<br><br>
He had left the chaos through the Deleting Space. Though he had entered the Other Shore, his physical body wasn't in the primitive land, so the Illusion Breaking Rune wouldn't work for him.
<br><br>
In the end, Geoffrey also chose to return by means of descending, and he landed steadily on the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
On the staircase reaching up to the jadeite platform, Letitia had been standing there like a sculpture for a long time, and her beautiful eyes were filled with anxiety and uneasiness.
<br><br>
Even when she saw Zen open his eyes, she didn't step forward to acknowledge him.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had been gone for a very long time, and she had missed her son so much. If she still couldn't be reunited with her son at this time, she would pester Zen until he returned Geoffrey to her.
<br><br>
To her surprise, Geoffrey soon appeared and landed in the center of the jadeite platform. However, his bulky figure startled everyone present.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey, how did you become like this?" Letitia stormed up to the jadeite platform and grabbed Geoffrey's burly arm, tears streaming down her cheeks.
<br><br>
Although she hadn't personally witnessed Geoffrey's journey, she had already imagined it thousands of times in her mind. She feared her son must have experienced all kinds of trials and tribulations on the quest.
<br><br>
"Mother, I'm well. I have become like this because my body has grown so strong, and I can't find a way to shrink it..." Geoffrey rushed to explain.
<br><br>
"Really?" Letitia skeptically raised her eyebrow at his explanation.
<br><br>
"It's true. I bet that nobody throughout the entire chaos could now match me in a melee combat!" Geoffrey confidently assured her. He had grown adept at comforting his mother.
<br><br>
"Do you mean to say you are more powerful than your father now?"
<br><br>
Given Letitia's current cultivation base, she lacked the ability to determine Geoffrey's real strength, so she turned to look at Zen for confirmation.
<br><br>
Zen nodded with a solemn look. "He's right. His body has gained experience and unimaginable strengthening, and even I can't hold a candle to him now."
<br><br>
After hearing their explanations, Letitia finally smiled through her tears.
<br><br>
Since her son had returned safely, and his strength had increased to such an extent, her pent-up sadness quickly vanished like mist before the sun of her joy.
<br><br>
Six hours later, in the center of the primitive land, the Heavenly Ring Staff floated in isolation in the air.
<br><br>
Thin but long streaks of blood rained down from the blood-red sky and tightly wrapped around the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey first gained control of the Heavenly Ring Staff, he had tried to infuse his consciousness into it. However, his small wisp of consciousness had disappeared without a trace, and it was immediately devoured by the Heavenly Ring Staff as energy.
<br><br>
It was not easy to completely subdue the Heavenly Ring Staff, and the task was left to the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The moment the streaks of blood wrapped around the Heavenly Ring Staff, the ancestry-level bloodline started to notice a massive amount of energy being drawn away by the Heavenly Ring Staff. Zen also sensed that there was a strong energy flow across the primitive land.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline didn't stop the energy supply. Instead, it was willing to offer the Heavenly Ring Staff as much as it wanted.
<br><br>
Regardless of how much energy it required to activate the staff, it would be satisfied as long as it continued to supply it. As the energy flow fused with and filled the Heavenly Ring Staff, its surface, which looked like a withered branch, began to radiate an aura of life. On the top of the staff some green buds even grew, and these were about to bloom.
<br><br>
Chapter 4276 Illusory Vision "Buzz..."
<br><br>
A tiny ring grew out of the Heavenly Ring Staff and floated on its side.
<br><br>
It was purple and was surrounded by purple lightning bolts.
<br><br>
Zen, who was not too far away, could feel the power of those purple lightning bolts. The power wasn't the energy of the fourth-grade world. It was an energy of certain Extreme Form from the Deep Space.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A second ring floated out of the staff.
<br><br>
There were two spiral lights at the center of the ring. One was black, and the other one was white. The two lights intertwined and completely filled the whole ring.
<br><br>
Zen had seen these lights before—the Starry Roc-fish had once used this power to turn Zen's body into energy. They were the power of the Magnetic Light Extreme Form that could magnetize substances into energy.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The third ring came out, and then the fourth one, and the fifth one...
<br><br>
One after another, rings grew out of the Heavenly Ring Staff and lined up neatly around it.
<br><br>
As Zen watched all of these occurred, a word suddenly popped out in his mind—the map...
<br><br>
There were three hundred and seventy-three types of abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and there was also a map that marked the types. The function of these rings should be similar to that of the map.
<br><br>
"Ancestry-level bloodline, is the Heavenly Ring Staff displaying its abilities?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
After a moment of silence, the ancestry-level bloodline said, "This is more than a display of abilities. As the staff shows its abilities, it's also directly merging into your primitive land. Once the merging process is completed, these abilities can be used by you just the same way you can use my abilities!"
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows. Although obtaining the Heavenly Ring Staff meant he gained control of the power in the Deep Space, he never expected the process to be so smooth. He continued, "In that case, I should have one hundred and forty types of abilities later?"
<br><br>
"Yes," the ancestry-level bloodline replied in a depressed tone.
<br><br>
The reaction of the ancestry-level bloodline baffled Zen. "What's wrong with you?"
<br><br>
"I... I'm searching for my memories," said the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
When the Deep Space was downgraded, the ancestry-level bloodline lost a portion of its extremely important memories, causing it to forget its original identity.
<br><br>
It had been placing its hopes on the Heavenly Ring Staff because it thought that a portion of its lost memories very likely resided within the staff.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, as the abilities of the Heavenly Ring Staff came out one after another, it still hadn't found any signs of its lost memories.
<br><br>
"Don't worry—maybe your memory is hidden deep inside it. Let's wait and see," Zen comforted, though he knew the possibility was slim.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
Many rings representing various types of abilities appeared and lined up around the staff.
<br><br>
One hundred and thirty-seven...
<br><br>
One hundred and thirty-eight...
<br><br>
One hundred and thirty-nine...
<br><br>
One hundred and forty...
<br><br>
All the abilities the Heavenly Ring Staff had were presented before Zen and the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze never strayed away from the staff. This staff most likely housed a spirit that had gained wisdom, so he was wondering—would it appear? At this moment, the green color on the surface of the Heavenly Ring Staff was fading away at a rapid speed. Along with the fading of the green color on its surface, the Heavenly Ring Staff began to dry up, transforming back into a withered branch. Before long, it quickly started to rot.
<br><br>
Crack...
<br><br>
A thick crack suddenly broke open on it, and a palm-sized crystal appeared from within.
<br><br>
"This crystal..."
<br><br>
Zen released his spiritual sense to examine the crystal.
<br><br>
However, the moment his spiritual sense touched the crystal, it disappeared without a trace. The crystal seemed to be conscious and on guard. It simply didn't allow Zen to see through it.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
Long, thin, blood-red lines suddenly appeared, spread over the crystal, and completely shrouded it in a matter of seconds. Right at that moment, the ancestry-level bloodline said, "This crystal is the spirit of the Heavenly Ring Staff. It won't allow strangers to touch it, but it might have my memories within it."
<br><br>
An understanding expression appeared on Zen's face. "Can you touch it then?"
<br><br>
"I'm not sure, but I'll try. Leave this crystal to me. I'll deal with it," said the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"Of course—go ahead," said Zen.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline and the Heavenly Ring Staff had the same origins. They belonged to each other, so it actually didn't need to ask for Zen's consent at all.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the crystal soared to the sky.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze fell on the rings representing energies of various Extreme Forms. These energy rings were the capital he needed to fight against the downgrader, so he needed to master the use of every Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Five days later.
<br><br>
One "Zen" was standing under each energy ring.
<br><br>
In total, there were one hundred and forty "Zens" standing under those one hundred and forty energy rings.
<br><br>
"Soul Extreme Form..."
<br><br>
Zen's voice echoed in the primitive land.
<br><br>
One of those "Zens" slowly floated up, heading towards the energy ring above his head.
<br><br>
That particular ring was light brown in color, and there was a thin layer of mist whirling at its center.
<br><br>
"Disperse!"
<br><br>
When that "Zen" opened his eyes, his eyes were also covered in a layer of brown mist.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A wave of invisible consciousness spread from that "Zen."
<br><br>
In a few seconds, the wave of consciousness had spread all over the vast space of the primitive land. However, it did not stop at that point. It continued to break through the space barrier and quickly spread around the chaos.
<br><br>
Everything the wave of consciousness came into contact with was shown in Zen's mind. This was an exploring-type of theurgy in the Soul Extreme Form. In other words, it was equivalent to the spiritual sense in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
However, the spread of consciousness in the Soul Extreme Form was more difficult to be detected than the spread of spiritual sense. Moreover, the consciousness in the Soul Extreme Form could spread at a speed countless times faster and cover an area many times bigger.
<br><br>
Soon, this rapidly spreading wave of consciousness had covered the Source World...
<br><br>
Above the center of the Source World, there was an exquisite building.
<br><br>
The building was made of pure black metal, and it was filled with countless black chains that bound an avatar of the Evil God inside the building.
<br><br>
This avatar of the Evil God was a sentry. He had a terrifyingly acute perceptivity, and for this reason, he was placed outside the Source World to monitor every movement occurring in the chaos.
<br><br>
For the current Evil God, how to manage his avatars was indeed a headache.
<br><br>
Every avatar was extremely intelligent, and their rebellious nature was engraved in their bones.
<br><br>
The Evil God had no choice but to forge a special kind of metal to trap the avatars that had tried to betray him.
<br><br>
When that unnoticeable wave of consciousness spread to the Source World, the avatar suddenly raised his head. A trace of surprise appeared on his sinister face.
<br><br>
"That direction... It's the primitive land...
<br><br>
This consciousness is the Illusory Vision in the Soul Extreme Form. Has he also comprehended the power of the Deep Space? Interesting! Zen's performance isn't bad! Master, did you feel it? I'm curious... Are you feeling afraid now? Hahaha..."
<br><br>
Five minutes later.
<br><br>
That wave of consciousness had already enveloped more than half of the chaos. Zen also noticed the giant pyramid the Evil God had mentioned.
<br><br>
But this time, Zen's focus wasn't on the giant pyramid. He wanted to help Dorothy find her mother, and this Soul Extreme Form was naturally the best way to achieve his purpose.
<br><br>
Just as his consciousness spread past the boundless inner wall of the chaos, Zen suddenly discovered that tens of thousands of heads were piled up on the inner wall.
<br><br>
It was such a rare scene to behold.
<br><br>
Because these heads should have devoured each other until only one head remained—the last winner that would grow huge from devouring the others.
<br><br>
Only when those heads had a common goal would they pile up on the wall like that.
<br><br>
Zen controlled his consciousness, directing it to see through these heads.
<br><br>
Once he did, he finally saw a woman embedded in the wall.
<br><br>
Chapter 4277 Exhibition Zen saw that the woman was protected inside an invisible enchanted barrier. The huge heads moved along the edge of the barrier, trying to chomp at her.
<br><br>
They scrambled almost desperately, trying to devour the woman, but the barrier stopped them from doing so.
<br><br>
The woman was stoic and emotionless, closing her eyes slightly, so Zen could barely make out whether she had the pupils of a snake.
<br><br>
But this didn't matter. The woman had a striking resemblance to Dorothy.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to withdraw his consciousness, the woman's eyes suddenly popped open. Her golden pupils revealed a trace of confusion mixed with wonder.
<br><br>
Logically speaking, creatures of the fourth-grade world shouldn't have been able to sense the aura of the Illusory Vision, since the consciousness transmitted in this way was a very small wisp and was activated in the Soul Extreme Form.
<br><br>
The Evil God was an exception, only because he had also grasped the power of the Deep Space.
<br><br>
As for this woman, she was a snake spirit. Among the Four Spirits Sect, the snake spirits had the most acute perception.
<br><br>
Upon sensing the faint disturbance, she immediately could tell that someone was there, despite it being extremely difficult to detect where it was exactly.
<br><br>
"Is someone spying on me again?" she wondered aloud. "If yes, then that would be good news for me...
<br><br>
Things shouldn't go the way my father says they should go," she continued, a trace of anger in her voice. "He said that he can control the overall situation of the chaos, but I bet he must have been met with opposition. Am I right?"
<br><br>
Narrowing her hatred-filled eyes, she shouted, "If you are someone who opposes him, please-- stop at nothing to kill my father!"
<br><br>
Her voice rang throughout the space, and Zen could tangibly feel her anger.
<br><br>
While she might've been the daughter of the Snake Spirit King, she had grown up in the Human Spirit Sect. All of her skills were taught by the human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House. The only thing that Cornelius had ever given her was the Evil Bead that hovered above her, which had been his wedding gift to her.
<br><br>
No matter how she viewed it, it was a great honor for her to receive a Holy Item from her father.
<br><br>
It had even made her siblings seethe with jealousy.
<br><br>
That was the only time she ever felt some semblance of affection from her father.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, she later realized that the Evil Bead was not a gift at all, but a weapon in disguise. It was hidden within her body, which was all part of Cornelius's grand plan.
<br><br>
When the four sects fought fiercely in the chaos, her father had demanded her to fight by his side.
<br><br>
She had refused to submit, even if it meant she had to die.
<br><br>
From the moment Kincaid was killed, she viewed her father as a horrendous enemy.
<br><br>
While she was painfully aware that she personally would never be able to exact her revenge, she still wished she'd live to see the day her father would regret his actions.
<br><br>
Zen felt the strong hatred emanating from her, but he couldn't communicate with her through the Illusory Vision. The only thing he could do was listen, then silently retract his consciousness.
<br><br>
Upon deactivating the Soul Extreme Form, Zen's replica closed his eyes and fell asleep.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, on the jadeite platform, Zen slowly opened his eyes.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Kincaid, and Hilario had been waiting anxiously by his side.
<br><br>
When they saw him wake up, they all gazed at him inquisitively.
<br><br>
"I found her," said Zen, clearly reading their expressions.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Kincaid, and Hilario silently rejoiced at this news.
<br><br>
"How is Itzel? Is she okay?" Kincaid asked, his tone tinged with worry.
<br><br>
"She looks unharmed, but she bears a strong hatred for the Snake Spirit King," Zen answered. He then recounted what he had just witnessed.
<br><br>
When he was finished, Kincaid lowered his gaze and his eyes dimmed.
<br><br>
After a while, he finally asked, "Can we save her?"
<br><br>
"Of course!"
<br><br>
Zen replied enthusiastically.
<br><br>
Two hours later...
<br><br>
The primitive land, which had been moving consistently in the chaos, suddenly changed course and headed straight into the depths of the chaos.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, in the Source World...
<br><br>
The Evil God was ordering people to build a new palace.
<br><br>
What they had built so far resembled a huge, black pyramid. It was somewhat bleak in appearance; there seemed to be nothing special about it.
<br><br>
When the palace was finally completed, his will suddenly reverberated throughout the entire Source World, like a pulse in the earth.
<br><br>
He invited all the powerful warriors in the Source World to come to visit him in his newly built palace.
<br><br>
More than two hundred warriors in total showed up, including many Holy Soul Realm warriors, Eternal Realm warriors, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and even Duran.
<br><br>
Crack! With a loud noise, the gates of the palace slowly creaked open.
<br><br>
Then, a complex aura of energy streamed forth from the gates.
<br><br>
When the Holy Soul Realm warriors and Eternal Realm warriors felt this aura, their gazes were drawn towards the palace interior. There, they saw that the ceiling of the hall was inlaid with countless triangular crystals, each of which containing the energy of a specific Godly Way.
<br><br>
"The three thousand Godly Ways?"
<br><br>
"What's the point of extracting the energy of the three thousand Godly Ways?"
<br><br>
"What is he planning to do?"
<br><br>
The Holy Soul Realm warriors and Eternal Realm warriors eyed the ceiling warily, all confused as to what was going on.
<br><br>
If they had been given enough time, it wouldn't have taken much effort for them to grasp all three thousand Godly Ways.
<br><br>
In the Source World, the power of the Other Shore Tokens was regarded as superior, while the Godly Ways were usually cast to the side.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran remained silent. By then, they had already guessed what the Evil God was up to.
<br><br>
"Everyone, please go upstairs from the staircase behind the hall," the Evil God's voice boomed, echoing throughout the hall.
<br><br>
Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven led the way, and all the other warriors followed behind them.
<br><br>
Upon climbing the stairs, they found the Evil God standing in the center of the hall on the second floor. However, no one stared at him too long.
<br><br>
What really drew their attention was what was on the ceiling.
<br><br>
Countless diamond-shaped crystals were embedded on the ceiling, with different kinds of energy flowing within them. Everyone was familiar with this aura: they were the bloodline powers! "Oh my God! There are so many bloodline powers!"
<br><br>
"One, two, three... They are three hundred and seventy-three in total!"
<br><br>
"Are these all the bloodline powers in the world?"
<br><br>
Holy Soul Realm warriors never had the chance to even encounter the bloodline powers. Even Eternal Realm warriors could, at most, get a rootlevel bloodline in the Eternal Scroll Painting. Their powers paled in comparison to the ones embedded in the ceiling.
<br><br>
Chaos suddenly broke loose among the warriors. It was as though a group of beggars encountered a cave filled with gold and silver treasures.
<br><br>
Everyone eyed the crystals greedily, and a somewhat stiff tension filled the atmosphere.
<br><br>
It was only Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven who remained calm amidst the chaos, as they had already predicted this. However, internally they were both shocked to see the complete bloodline powers neatly arranged on the ceiling.
<br><br>
"You can each select a specific bloodline power." The Evil God smiled.
<br><br>
"I'll give them to you as a gift."
<br><br>
His words were music to their ears.
<br><br>
Ever since the Evil God assumed control over the Source World, the warriors of different races had been dissatisfied with his rule. However, they wouldn't have stood a chance if they dared oppose him, so they had only grumbled under their breaths.
<br><br>
Now that the Evil God was so generous with the bloodline powers, the dissatisfaction in their minds instantly disappeared.
<br><br>
Before these Holy Soul Realm warriors and Eternal Realm warriors could express their gratitude, the Evil God turned to the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran. "Please follow me to the third floor."
<br><br>
Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven exchanged surprised looks.
<br><br>
At that moment, they both had guessed what was going on.
<br><br>
Without saying a word, they followed the Evil God upstairs and entered a hall on the third floor.
<br><br>
This time, the ceiling was embedded with countless rings. However, these rings were empty; no energy flowed within them.
<br><br>
At a glance, Duran's sharp eyes had counted the number of rings. There were one hundred and forty in total.
<br><br>
Just as he'd finished counting, the Evil God raised his head slowly.
<br><br>
Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle...
<br><br>
One after another, the rings lit up, until the ceiling was covered in glowing rings.
<br><br>
To their surprise, all kinds of Extreme Form energy now streamed within the rings! The Grandmaster of Heaven's mouth hung open in shock as he sensed the Extreme Form energies in the rings.
<br><br>
"This, this..." he stuttered.
<br><br>
"Are these all the kinds of energy from the Deep Space?"
<br><br>
Because the two of them had witnessed the Evil God's restoration of the Extreme Form energy from the Deep Space, they knew what to expect.
<br><br>
While they had already mentally prepared themselves for this scene, they were still unable to conceal their excitement at the sight of so many kinds of Extreme Form energy.
<br><br>
"I can teach you how to grasp any kind of Extreme Form energy.
<br><br>
However..." The Evil God suddenly frowned. "The consumption of power when you use the Extreme Form energy is significant. Even I can't use them for long..."
<br><br>
Chapter 4278 Make A Move All materials were made of energy, and all energy formed materials.
<br><br>
The third-grade world, the Lower Extreme World, was made up of three thousand kinds of Godly Way energy. Water, fire, wind, grass, wood, stone, and sand were all formed from the most basic Godly Way energy.
<br><br>
The energy of the Evil God's inner world was in abundant supply.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, all the materials in the fourth-grade world, the Grand Lower World, were formed by blood power.
<br><br>
The fusion of blood power was actually a type of transformation. Once the Eternal Realm warrior inherited the blood power, they could just rely on their own blood supply from then on.
<br><br>
The Evil God had not undergone this transformation. He was not an Eternal Realm master, and thus, still tapped on to the energy of the Source World.
<br><br>
It had always proven sufficient for his needs, anyway. The current Source World was so vast and huge that the energy it contained had been enough for the Evil God's use so far.
<br><br>
However, the consumption of Extreme Form energy in the Deep Space was a different matter entirely.
<br><br>
He wouldn't dare waste energy coming from the Source World at will, and he lit up one hundred and forty kinds of Extreme Form energy only when showing that to the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran.
<br><br>
"You see, if we can master the Extreme Form energy, we can improve our strength without limit. I'm willing to cultivate it," said Duran.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven nodded. "The power at this advanced level is certainly far greater. It's on a completely different level. Teach me and I will forever be grateful!"
<br><br>
Having witnessed the display, Duran, too, came to acknowledge that Extreme Form energy surpassed blood power in all aspects.
<br><br>
"As you wish." The Evil God knew they'd make that choice.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at the end of the hall. There was a staircase there leading to a higher floor.
<br><br>
"So there's still a fourth floor here. Does it have an even higher-level power?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven knew the Evil God better than Duran did.
<br><br>
He knew the Evil God was extremely selfish. If he was willing to teach them something, it only meant he was hiding the stronger strength in his arsenal.
<br><br>
He had heard the Evil God mention the Field last time. In such a short period of time, he had already thoroughly comprehended the power of the Deep Space. It was highly likely he had also mastered the higher-level power.
<br><br>
"The fourth floor is not open for the time being," the Evil God said curtly.
<br><br>
He waved his hand dismissively and left the matter at that.
<br><br>
Both the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran raised a brow at this, but kept quiet.
<br><br>
The Evil God was probably the most talented warrior they had ever met.
<br><br>
Just then, a voice piped up in the mind of the Evil God. It was a message from the Evil God acting as the sentry.
<br><br>
The Evil God tilted his head, narrowing his eyes as he listened. His lips curled into a sneer. "Something strange is going on with the primitive land."
<br><br>
"Zen's primitive land?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
The Evil God nodded. "It appears to be flying to the right and speeding up."
<br><br>
"Why is it doing that?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked with concern.
<br><br>
The Evil God shook his head. "I don't know yet either."
<br><br>
He knew that Zen had obtained the power of the Deep Space, infusing the primitive land with greater strength. It was huge progress, but he felt even that wasn't enough to match up to the downgrader.
<br><br>
The Evil God had warned Zen that neither of them should act rashly about it. He could just let the primitive land devour the heads and grow stronger.
<br><br>
After all, the larger the primitive land became, the more energy it contained. So this sudden move seemed unwise of Zen.
<br><br>
"Are we going to follow them?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
The Evil God pondered for a moment and answered in the affirmative.
<br><br>
The Source World alone wouldn't be enough to deal with the downgrader.
<br><br>
The Evil God intended to bring the Source World and Zen's primitive land closer together so they could join forces.
<br><br>
They would just be defeated in succession if they acted alone.
<br><br>
Hence, two hours later, the huge Source World began to turn slowly.
<br><br>
The Evil God working as the sentry shook the thick black chains on his body and stretched out a hand. "Thirty degrees towards west, rotate!"
<br><br>
The whole Source World revolved slowly under his command.
<br><br>
When the Source World had turned thirty degrees, the sentry barked out, "Move forward!"
<br><br>
Rumble! The Source World started to move forward, growing faster and faster as time went by.
<br><br>
The authority to control the Source World actually lay with the real Evil God.
<br><br>
The sentry only predicted the actions of the Evil God and relayed the orders.
<br><br>
As this happened, a giant pyramid spun at high speed in the depths of the chaos.
<br><br>
This was the Burial Land that had already massively expanded.
<br><br>
The Burial Land was filled with chaotic power, dark and obscure.
<br><br>
As the Burial Land grew, the monsters that inhabited it also became immensely powerful.
<br><br>
However, they didn't dare to approach the mountain at the center of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
The master of this world was staying on that mountain. It was a giant snake.
<br><br>
The giant snake had a nasty disposition. He devoured any living creature that dared to approach him. The area within a thousand miles around the mountain thus became the dangerous, forbidden territory.
<br><br>
Just then, two moon-shaped objects appeared over the mountain top. The monsters knew what they really were.
<br><br>
They were the eyes of the awakened giant snake.
<br><br>
Buzz! The downgrader materialized on top of the mountain.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King lowered his head. "Greetings, downgrader."
<br><br>
The downgrader once referred to himself only as the black light to the Snake Spirit King. The Snake Spirit King never imagined that the black light was actually the downgrader.
<br><br>
The downgrader only revealed his true identity after the battle in the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
That was when Cornelius realized he would never be able to return his hometown, the main world.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's only value to the downgrader now and his only chance of survival were to control the Burial Land well.
<br><br>
"They're all on the move," the downgrader said.
<br><br>
"On the move? Where are they headed?" the Snake Spirit King asked, puzzled.
<br><br>
"Thirty degrees to the west," the downgrader said, pointing in a direction.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King seemed a little surprised at this. "Are they looking for my daughter?" he asked, after a pause.
<br><br>
"The Blood Snake Girl," the downgrader corrected.
<br><br>
"But how did they know her location?" the Snake Spirit King asked.
<br><br>
The chaos was so huge that even huge chaos clouds seemed insignificant.
<br><br>
What more a person? It should have been impossible to find her. She was embedded in the inner wall of the chaos, after all.
<br><br>
"The Soul Extreme Form," the downgrader replied. "The Illusory Vision in the Soul Extreme Form can explore the boundless world. They used this method to find the Blood Snake Girl."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King drew a breath. "How did they obtain the power of the Deep Space?"
<br><br>
The downgrader's six pairs of eyes flickered down.
<br><br>
Like the members of the Four Spirits Sect, he, too, was unable to return to the main world. He had deployed the irregular heavy sword and controlled the Starry Roc-fish, but even then, he had failed to prevent Geoffrey from taking back the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
His failure would always bring him deep shame.
<br><br>
"They can still be defeated even if they have the Deep Space power," the downgrader said coldly.
<br><br>
"Are you planning something?" The Snake Spirit King's interest was piqued.
<br><br>
All his dreams had been shattered, but his malevolence remained intact.
<br><br>
He knew he was on a slow descent to hell, but he hoped that he could bring everyone down with him.
<br><br>
Chapter 4279 Setting Itzel Free The downgrader silently glanced at the Snake Spirit King and mockingly asked, "You want me to make a move now?"
<br><br>
"It's up to you, Master. I am at your disposal," the Snake Spirit King said as he submitted with a lowered head. He was afraid that the downgrader would read his mind.
<br><br>
"The Blood Snake Girl has fulfilled her mission. It doesn't matter if we let her go," the downgrader said.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King felt a flash of disappointment because he didn't want to see his daughter being freed.
<br><br>
"The end of the chaos is about to arrive, and she possesses the power to destroy the Source World. We can't let her fall into the hands of other people." After pondering for a moment, the downgrader continued, "We are going to follow them."
<br><br>
"Yes, sir," the Snake Spirit King replied with an ingratiating nod.
<br><br>
The Burial Land, which had spun at high speed, stopped, and its side emitted a bright radiance. It changed its path and flew into the depths of the chaos.
<br><br>
In the empty chaos, two giant objects were advancing at high speed.
<br><br>
When he had finished a fifth of his trip in the chaos, Zen activated the Soul Extreme Form once again.
<br><br>
Since the Illusory Vision expanded over a vast area, Zen immediately discovered that the Source World was chasing after him from behind.
<br><br>
"I didn't expect it to pursue me..." Zen murmured to himself as he furrowed his eyebrows.
<br><br>
Zen frowned slightly and felt relieved as a new thought occurred to him.
<br><br>
'The Evil God considers the downgrader his biggest threat, not me. He follows closely behind me simply because he fears that the downgrader will make a move against him.' Hence, the Evil God's actions didn't unnerve Zen at all.
<br><br>
However, as the Illusory Vision continued to advance, he frowned deeply for he realized that the Burial Land was also tailing after him.
<br><br>
This was definitely not welcome news. Although he had already got the Heavenly Ring Staff, he was not sure that he could prevail over the downgrader.
<br><br>
He knew that undoubtedly the most important thing was to be proficient in harnessing the Extreme Form energies.
<br><br>
But there were one hundred and forty different kinds of Extreme Form energy waiting for him to master. Plus, he had to learn several theurgies of each Extreme Form energy. Hence, it was no small task to master all those energies.
<br><br>
While the primitive land headed west, Zen had been constantly testing these Extreme Form energies, not even pausing for sleep.
<br><br>
Ten days later, the primitive land slowed down as it approached a mark a million miles from the inner wall of the chaos.
<br><br>
The heads were still tirelessly stirring, obstructing Itzel's vision. However, she still saw the massive primitive land while it was still a million miles away from her.
<br><br>
"What is that?" Itzel mused.
<br><br>
There was a trace of confusion shining in her eyes.
<br><br>
Trapped within in the wall, she had seen lots of things in the chaos. But never had she seen a huge world approach.
<br><br>
'Was this world sent by the force hostile to my father?' She had been trapped there for over a thousand chaotic eras, and nothing had stirred her. But at this thought, her heart beat faster in excitement.
<br><br>
Over the years, she had come to believe that no one would come here and set her free.
<br><br>
But now that there was a slim chance, she couldn't control her excitement and longed to seize the opportunity.
<br><br>
The massive land drew closer and closer, finally stopping in its tracks when it was a hundred thousand miles away from her.
<br><br>
From her vantage point, the primitive land had collided against the inner wall of the chaos.
<br><br>
Five minutes later, Zen could be seen, floating in front of the primitive land.
<br><br>
He stretched forth his finger, and ripples appeared in the space in front of him. The ripples twisted the space upside down, folded it up for a hundred thousand miles, and then restored it to its normal shape.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen was one hundred thousand miles away from where he had previously been.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Those heads were originally slamming into the wall of chaos with force nonstop.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, they sensed the burst of a life force coming from behind them.
<br><br>
For these heads, who only fed on creatures, Zen was their favorite type of food.
<br><br>
They all gave up on Itzel, turned around, and came at Zen.
<br><br>
As soon as those heads left, one after another, a huge wall came into Itzel's view.
<br><br>
The primitive land was massive; plus, it was so close to her. As a result, she could only see the wall. But then, she caught sight of Zen not far away.
<br><br>
"It's a human being?"
<br><br>
Surprise crept onto Itzel's face.
<br><br>
She had imagined that all sorts of powerful and unique creatures would spill out of the primitive land. But it never occurred to her that what appeared would be a human.
<br><br>
"Watch out! Those heads feed on all life force," Itzel warned as she saw that the heads were trying to bite Zen.
<br><br>
But the next moment, she saw that Zen had transformed into countless shadows.
<br><br>
Those shadows gently touched the foreheads of each of the heads.
<br><br>
With the heads no longer attacking, Zen moved past them and flew towards Itzel slowly.
<br><br>
"Those heads are still alive. Watch out..." Itzel urged him.
<br><br>
The heads all swung about and with their jaws flapping, they rushed up to bite Zen.
<br><br>
However, as soon as they had covered over a mile, they crumbled, turning into powder and dissipating in the air. They didn't even have the chance to touch Zen, never mind to hurt him.
<br><br>
As Zen made his way towards Itzel, he saw a faint blue enchanted barrier which separated them.
<br><br>
The enchanted barrier could repel the fierce attacks of the heads, which meant it was hard to break.
<br><br>
Zen pointed at the enchanted barrier with one finger, and a purple energy ring materialized around his wrist. His arm was instantly filled with energy of the Destruction Extreme Form.
<br><br>
As Zen wiggled his fingers, the enchanted barrier disintegrated, breaking into pieces like a thin layer of ice.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" Itzel finally asked.
<br><br>
"My name is Zen Luo," Zen replied with a friendly smile. "Your husband and daughter have asked me to free you," he added.
<br><br>
"My daughter and my husband?"
<br><br>
Itzel echoed his words, stunned.
<br><br>
A puzzled look filled her eyes.
<br><br>
Zen understood why she was behaving like that. 'If any other person had been locked up in the wall for over a thousand chaotic eras, they would have already gone crazy, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
He stretched his hand forward.
<br><br>
Then space began to fluctuate again. Space became folded, and Dorothy and Kincaid materialized next to Zen.
<br><br>
"Mother..."
<br><br>
Dorothy called out.
<br><br>
The moment Dorothy caught sight of the woman, she felt a sense of kinship with Itzel. Perhaps it was because of their blood ties.
<br><br>
"Itzel..."
<br><br>
Kincaid also called out affectionately to her.
<br><br>
When she had first been sent to the Human Spirit Sect, Itzel didn't have a name yet. Kincaid had given her the name.
<br><br>
Kincaid had given up hope of ever seeing her again.
<br><br>
Hence, he also became somewhat carried away with excitement.
<br><br>
Itzel stared blankly at Kincaid and Dorothy for a while, and then she began to sob.
<br><br>
Upon seeing this, Kincaid hurried forward and held her, rubbing her cheeks gently. "I am sorry. I should have come here earlier," he said with both guilt and affection in his voice.
<br><br>
Zen felt glad at the reunion of the family. He left the three of them alone to enjoy their private moment.
<br><br>
An hour later, Kincaid gestured at Zen to come join them.
<br><br>
Zen approached them, and the hesitance in Itzel's eyes was gone as she looked at him.
<br><br>
She had already heard about who Zen was, and Kincaid had told her that Dorothy had feelings for Zen. If her daughter married him, he would become her son-in-law.
<br><br>
"The inner wall of the chaos is almost impenetrable. Please endure it!"
<br><br>
Zen said as he laid one hand on the wall.
<br><br>
Wisps of dark purple energy of the Destruction Extreme Form flowed out of his hand.
<br><br>
The energy penetrated every nook and cranny of the wall, and dyed the surface of the wall to purple. Its surface became decayed, and it would be a small task to remove the layer of wall and free Itzel now.
<br><br>
Chapter 4280 The Last Shade Stone Zen had just released Itzel from the wall, and she was just catching her breath when suddenly, the Evil Bead appeared above her head.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's voice was then heard coming from the bead. "My daughter, you've waited for so long. Finally someone is here to save you."
<br><br>
Although the Snake Spirit King had given this Holy Item to Itzel, he had tampered with it beforehand and could take control of it any time.
<br><br>
Itzel looked up at the Evil Bead and had mixed feelings.
<br><br>
Snake spirits were known to be cold-blooded. It was not difficult for her to accept the fact that her father had become her enemy now. But when Itzel grew up in the Human Spirit Sect, she had remolded herself thoroughly. At this very moment, the grievance in her heart was like a volcano that was about to erupt.
<br><br>
Kincaid reached out a hand and pressed her shoulder softly. He looked up and shook his head at the Evil Bead. "You're right. We are here. I have survived more than a thousand chaotic eras. Itzel is safe and sound today, and you will eventually face defeat at our hands."
<br><br>
The members of the Bold Conjecture House had been cursed in the battle on the Other Shore. They now remained hidden in the passageway, but the remaining people of the Four Spirits Sects were long dead. The only way they could continue to exist was because they had all become Treacherous Beings. However, Itzel's body had been preserved.
<br><br>
When the Snake Spirit King heard Kincaid's calm answer, there was a burst of cruelty and hatred in his heart.
<br><br>
He had spent so much time and energy in trying to be omniscient and powerful, only to end up becoming a slave of the downgrader. And yet, Kincaid could still reunite with his daughter. Why? That was not fair! The Snake Spirit King felt depressed, but he sneered, "Safe and sound? Let me see how safe and sound she can be!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Flames suddenly burst forth from the Evil Bead hovering Itzel. The Snake Spirit King had sent it into an unstoppable combustive state! This was troubling! Even if an ordinary Other Shore Token was burnt, it would release an exceedingly large amount of energy, and the Evil Bead was not even an ordinary token.
<br><br>
Weird noises started coming out of the Evil Bead! Then it began to swell up at a rapid pace and was shaking, as if it were going to explode.
<br><br>
Kincaid was not afraid of the impending explosion since he was a Treacherous Being, but Itzel and Dorothy would most likely be killed if that happened.
<br><br>
However, when the Evil Bead had expanded to the size of a fist, Zen quietly stretched out two fingers and pointed at it calmly. A cubical space box, which was one foot wide, appeared out of nowhere and trapped the bead inside it.
<br><br>
Boom! With a muffled sound, the Evil Bead exploded in the space box and released its terrible power, but was unable to break through the space box.
<br><br>
Very soon, all of its energy was consumed.
<br><br>
The powers that came from the Deep Space were much stronger than those of the main world.
<br><br>
The trouble was, Zen had resolved the terrifying power of the Evil Bead, but the counterattack that came with its burning could not be stopped. The punishment of the pillar quickly devoured Itzel's vitality like a hungry lion. Like Ziya, Itzel's body instantly rotted into nothingness, turning into ashes and scattering in the air like confetti.
<br><br>
"Mother!"
<br><br>
Dorothy shouted and was about to rush forward, but Kincaid stopped her.
<br><br>
"No. Wait. Your mother won't die."
<br><br>
Itzel was a creature of the fourth-grade world. The punishment of burning a Holy Item was not death, and it would only destroy her body. This meant that when her body had completely dissipated, two golden crosses began floating in the air, which were her coordinates.
<br><br>
Buzz! With a slight shake of the golden coordinates, Itzel came out. She had now become a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
It was a pity that her body had been destroyed beyond repair, but it was inevitable.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's control of the Evil Bead allowed him to also control Itzel's life and death. Luckily, she was able to become a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
"I'll send you back to the Pear Hill," Zen told them as he gently pinched his fingers and folded the space around them.
<br><br>
Kincaid, Dorothy, and Itzel felt a soft flash of light before they found themselves standing atop the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Standing on the jadeite platform and looking at the huge world around her, Itzel couldn't hold back her shock. "Kincaid, Zen's space technique is remarkable!"
<br><br>
Itzel was a highly knowledgeable person. And she had also merged with the bloodline power of the space quadrant.
<br><br>
However, Zen's use of spatial powers was far beyond her imagination. He had already reached a point where he could bend and move space at will.
<br><br>
"There..."
<br><br>
Kincaid was looking around and suddenly pointed at the center of the primitive land, where a giant, colorful halo was floating softly in the air.
<br><br>
"There are all kinds of power in the Deep Space which are controlled by Zen."
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Itzel knew very clearly just how terrifying the powers of the Deep Space were. After hearing that Zen controlled them, she was so surprised that she couldn't even speak a word.
<br><br>
As for Zen himself, he sent the three of them into the primitive land, but did not return immediately. He folded the space once again and reached the top of the primitive land.
<br><br>
Once again, he released the Illusory Vision of the Soul Extreme Form, quickly spreading out his consciousness across millions of miles. After his consciousness reached the Burial Land, he silently calculated a certain time in his heart before he withdrew it and returned to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Six days later.
<br><br>
The sentry Evil God was swinging on a chain idly as it swayed back and forth like a hammock.
<br><br>
His sole duty was to guard the Source World. He could easily use the Illusory Vision anytime and anywhere to guard and oversee a range of twenty thousand miles around him.
<br><br>
The moment the Burial Land broke in, the sentry Evil God turned around like a predator that had sensed its prey. He saw a huge pyramid appear in the depths of the chaos, which was growing larger rapidly.
<br><br>
The change in size wasn't physical. It just meant that the pyramid was approaching very fast.
<br><br>
"Is it going to bump into the Source World?"
<br><br>
The sentry Evil God opened his eyes wide. However, instead of shock, there was an inexplicable trace of excitement on his face. He approved of the style of the downgrader.
<br><br>
Twenty million miles...
<br><br>
Fifteen million miles...
<br><br>
Ten million miles...
<br><br>
When it reached a distance of ten million miles from the Source World, its speed suddenly decreased rapidly. It continued to spin, but its speed was falling down rapidly, and finally, it stopped five million miles away from the Source World.
<br><br>
The sentry Evil God sneered with disdain, "Coward!"
<br><br>
He had really hoped that the Burial Land would bump into the Source World. He would have a chance to see if the Source World could face that mess.
<br><br>
The pyramid stayed hovering five million miles away from the Source World, neither moving forward nor retreating backwards.
<br><br>
Both the Evil God in the Source World and Zen were confused as to why the downgrader was doing that.
<br><br>
It was improbable that he had come all this way just to show off.
<br><br>
However, since he was making no move, Zen and the Evil God did not do anything either. They just waited silently.
<br><br>
It made them impatient and curious but they could only wait and watch.
<br><br>
Ten days later, another Shade Stone descended.
<br><br>
Previously, many Shade Stones had appeared one by one.
<br><br>
At that time, everyone thought that this meant the end of the chaos, but all of a sudden, the stone stopped appearing. They had never expected that another Shade Stone would appear in the Source World at this time. They were beginning to get nervous now, twitching and asking here and there for whatever explanation whoever could offer.
<br><br>
Not long after the Shade Stone had descended, the entire chaos began to shake violently.
<br><br>
And now it hit them why the Burial Land had remained motionless.
<br><br>
That was the shift of the last grain of sand in the hourglass of time.
<br><br>
The downgrader had been waiting for the end.
<br><br>
The end of the moments of chaos meant the end of the chaos itself.
<br><br>
Every single thing in the chaos would disappear. Tradition had it that in every single chaotic era, only six creatures were chosen to be Chaos Ancient Gods. These chosen ones were the only creatures that would survive the end of this era and journey on into a new one.
<br><br>
No one else could ever survive that. In fact, every single creature in the chaos had been born and bred to regard surviving such an end as their ultimate goal.
<br><br>
With time, they had developed confidence that they could survive the end, but the setup had undergone a tremendous change this time around.
<br><br>
Chapter 4281 The Sound Of Doomsday Every time a round of chaos ended, some creatures would flee to the Other Shore. These creatures brought with them their knowledge and recollection of what had happened, so people were familiar with the end.
<br><br>
As long as one reached the Other Shore Realm, it would be easy to find records and descriptions of the end of a round of chaos.
<br><br>
It was not a secret. It was simply a disaster that no civilization could survive.
<br><br>
Most records described it as a huge needle that pierced through the very fabric of the primitive land, smashing everything into pieces, and causing an unimaginable wave of destruction.
<br><br>
However, this direct description was not entirely accurate.
<br><br>
The needle only appeared in the final stage of the end. In fact, the end was a series of processes divided into separate stages.
<br><br>
When the last Shade Stone descended, the entire chaos would rumble and shake madly. It was said that the noise was deafening.
<br><br>
This loud sound came from the collision between the chaos and the main world. It was like the most powerful thunderbolt, and this also signaled the first wave of disaster in the end. The thunderous sound turned into destructive sound waves, which would spread throughout the entire chaos within three days.
<br><br>
The weakest of the creatures that lived in the chaos would be pulverized into puddles of blood and gored by the force of the sound waves. The buildings built around the bottom region of the chaos would be the first to collapse, crumbling so thoroughly that they would be reduced to a powdery white mist that blew across the land.
<br><br>
As for the creatures in the primitive lands, they were much luckier, because they had a natural barrier.
<br><br>
There was a deep rumbling sound.
<br><br>
Destructive sound waves quickly spread throughout the chaos.
<br><br>
However, even before this, the Snake Spirit King had already begun to downgrade the chaos. All the corners of the chaos had been devoured by the heads. Those who had been eaten were gone and could no longer be reduced to blood puddles by the sound waves.
<br><br>
Twenty eight hours later, the sound waves spread towards the Source World.
<br><br>
The sentry Evil God saw a slight distortion in the space in the distance. He tilted his head and smoothed his hair, unconcerned. The next moment, his ears exploded, and two spurts of blood gushed from his ears.
<br><br>
In fact, with his cultivation base, it would have been easy for him to protect himself from the sound waves, but he deliberately chose to experience the impact.
<br><br>
Since he had been deafened by the shock, the sentry Evil God had to repair his eardrums so that he could hear clearly again.
<br><br>
The thick outer wall of the Source World offset most of the energy of the sound waves. By the time the sound waves reached the inner parts, their power had been greatly reduced.
<br><br>
Even so, the rumbling sounds were still far beyond the ordinary sound of thunder.
<br><br>
Everywhere in the Source World, the sound waves penetrated.
<br><br>
Initially, the creatures in the Source World were uncertain as to what had happened. They initially assumed it was some fluke of abnormal weather.
<br><br>
Others imagined it was the sound of some extraordinary warrior unleashing powerful thunder.
<br><br>
But four hours later, the rumbling sounds had yet to dissipate. Because the creatures couldn't communicate with each other in words, they communicated using their spiritual senses. Some of them couldn't bear the sounds and punctured their ears.
<br><br>
Soon, more and more creatures began to realize that something was wrong. Some rushed to the ancient books, vaguely remembering something similar, and they found the terrible answer.
<br><br>
This was probably the last thunder before the end! This meant that the end was drawing near.
<br><br>
Panic quickly spread into every corner of the Source World.
<br><br>
Everyone reacted in different ways. Some began holding sacrificial ceremonies, praying to the gods to spare them. Some began looking for a place of safety, and many of these creatures hid underground. Most, however, were reduced to pure panic and fear, unable to think what to do next. After all, what was there to be done? Everything in the chaos was about to be destroyed. There was nowhere to escape.
<br><br>
However, some powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm retained a glimmer of hope.
<br><br>
They had gone further on the Other Shore. They had learned some things from the masters at the Holy Soul Realm and the Eternal Realm. Most of all, they were familiar with the tyrannical Evil God, the current controller of the Source World, and understood just how powerful he was.
<br><br>
Maybe he would find a way to survive the end.
<br><br>
In times of despair, when there was no other choice, people were forced to hold on to even the faintest slivers of hope. Soon, the wisest and most powerful people in the Source World had all turned their eyes towards the Evil God, waiting to see what he would do.
<br><br>
Zen's primitive land was undergoing the same experience.
<br><br>
Within seconds, the primitive land was completely enveloped by incessant sound waves.
<br><br>
However, the internal structure of the primitive land was much simpler than that of the Source World.
<br><br>
Most of the primitive land was empty. Only the continents, the Pear Hill, and the Ruin Graveyard were occupied. Zen used a kind of Extreme Form energy to build a huge enchanted barrier to cover these places.
<br><br>
The enchanted barrier was unable to completely block the sound waves, but it helped to reduce the sound level significantly.
<br><br>
But although the disturbance caused by the sound waves was alleviated, panic inevitably began to spread across the primitive land.
<br><br>
Most of the people in the Ruin Graveyard, the divine land, and the continents were fine. The vast majority of them didn't even know what the end meant, and they continued to live without worry.
<br><br>
But all the people in the Pear Hill were from the Source World, and some of the elites had learned about the end. They recognized the signs and felt a growing fear that the end was about to come.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess didn't hide the news. Instead, she announced it to the public.
<br><br>
She knew it would cause a panic, but she felt that everyone had the right to know, and to face this moment in the best way they chose.
<br><br>
At the top of the divine land, many Holy Beings gathered together. They had been summoned by Mike and did not yet know what had happened.
<br><br>
Mike stood with his hands behind his back and solemnly told them that the end had arrived. This information was news to them.
<br><br>
The Holy Beings had been calm despite the strange, muted rumbling sounds, but now their whole demeanor changed.
<br><br>
The current divine land was so peaceful. They had never thought that such a disaster could strike without warning.
<br><br>
Like the wise warriors in the Source World, they quickly considered their options, and decided to place all their hopes on Zen.
<br><br>
"Your son could create a world that is so many times larger than the divine land. Can't he deal with the end?" said one of the Holy Beings.
<br><br>
"Is there anything in the chaos that Zen can't do?" another said.
<br><br>
"We believe he will make it!"
<br><br>
Zen was their only hope, and the Holy Beings put their faith in his abilities.
<br><br>
Of course, Mike knew what they were thinking. He smiled bitterly but did not contradict them. Although he and the Holy Beings were powerful in the divine land, they didn't even have the right to speak when the end came.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the fairy palace, Geoffrey stood in the empty courtyard and looked up at the sky.
<br><br>
He was highly sensitive, and his perception of energy fluctuations was far stronger than that of ordinary people. It was even stronger than Zen's.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey," Letitia called at the gate. She gazed at him as he stood with his back towards her.
<br><br>
After a moment, Geoffrey turned around, smiling. "Mother, it begins."
<br><br>
Letitia nodded. She knew what Geoffrey meant.
<br><br>
"I want to fight. I want to protect this world and you," Geoffrey said. His tone was grim, almost fanatic in his determination.
<br><br>
For the first time, Letitia didn't object. Instead, she nodded, her eyes shining.
<br><br>
In the Ruin Graveyard, Rocher sat on a broken giant tombstone. In his hand was the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
He had mastered the methods that Kincaid taught him. He was now capable of unleashing the full power of the Lone Sword.
<br><br>
He had never regarded the survival from the end as his goal. Indeed, before this, he hadn't even known much about it.
<br><br>
However, he did not plan to wait passively for the end. He was ready to act at a moment's notice.
<br><br>
Chapter 4282 The Needle The thunderous noise lasted for three days and three nights before it finally stopped.
<br><br>
The entire chaos temporarily returned to a state of tranquility. Some of the creatures in the Source World began to regain their senses of hearing.
<br><br>
Even though the terrible shock waves already disappeared, the people did not feel relieved. Instead, they became even more worried.
<br><br>
Some of them began to leaf through the ancient books. They were trying to predict what would happen next.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, someone in the Bloom Divine Province found a relevant passage.
<br><br>
An old man opened an ancient book with his hands trembling with fear and anxiety.
<br><br>
This ancient book was written long ago by an elder of his race. It talked about what would happen should the end come.
<br><br>
"The last thunder will destroy everything with its sound. However, the six sages will be protected by a bright and dazzling light."
<br><br>
"Those six sages refer to the six Chaos Ancient Gods," murmured one of his companions.
<br><br>
"So six lucky warriors will be selected in the Source World," another one chimed in.
<br><br>
To be chosen as one of the Chaos Ancient Gods, there were two conditions that must be satisfied. First, the person must possess enormous amounts of strength. At the very least, they must be at the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
The second one would be sheer luck.
<br><br>
Knowing this secret, the warriors at the Holy Soul Realm and the Eternal Realm had high hopes that they could be one of the chosen Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
If they were selected, they were basically granted a special ticket to the next round of chaos.
<br><br>
Out of the blue, everyone heard a buzzing sound.
<br><br>
A beam of light suddenly appeared in the Source World. It headed straight for the hall the Evil God built.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, on the second floor of the hall, several cultivators of the Holy Soul Realm and the Eternal Realm were greedily absorbing the bloodline powers.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked at these people impassively. He appeared extremely generous. But in actuality, he felt thoroughly disgusted of them.
<br><br>
Soon enough, he would need their help. All he could do for now was patiently satisfy their greed.
<br><br>
Buzz! Something streaked past them from above.
<br><br>
The beam of light pierced through the black hall and enshrouded one of the cultivators of the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
The cultivator was still digesting the bloodline power he had just absorbed. He opened his eyes and saw the light enveloping his entire body. Naturally, he was awestruck for a few moments. Suddenly, he realized that he was chosen to be a Chaos Ancient God and master a truth.
<br><br>
He was so happy that he jumped up from his meditating position earlier.
<br><br>
"Is he the one chosen to be a Chaos Ancient God?" one of the cultivators whispered to his fellow cultivator.
<br><br>
"Even if we don't survive the end, he will still make it to the next chaotic era with such ease," murmured another.
<br><br>
"What a stroke of luck! He doesn't possess that much strength. Why is he chosen? It's unfair!" a fierce warrior of the Holy Soul Realm protested.
<br><br>
Another warrior felt envious. "Why couldn't it be me?"
<br><br>
All the warriors in this hall had been invited here to merge with the bloodline powers. Earlier, they were quite happy and satisfied as they were able to gather much power. But when they saw that one of them was chosen as a Chaos Ancient God, they felt terribly envious and depressed.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, this beam of light also reminded them that there would be six chosen Chaos Ancient Gods. This meant that they still had a chance.
<br><br>
The chosen warrior was extremely excited. Anyone who was granted a sure ticket to the next chaotic era would obviously feel overjoyed.
<br><br>
But before long, he saw a black figure approaching him. It reached out and grabbed him by his neck.
<br><br>
The black figure was none other than the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Holy Soul Realm warrior was a little flustered. He had no idea why the Evil God attacked him. "What... What are you doing?" he asked as he trembled with fear.
<br><br>
"What part of this do you not understand? This is the last chaotic era. If I lose, there won't be a next chaotic era. What's the use of choosing the next Chaos Ancient Gods?" The Evil God's expression was cold and apathetic.
<br><br>
"But... But... I was chosen..."
<br><br>
the Holy Soul Realm warrior stammered as he didn't know what else to say.
<br><br>
The Evil God's hand flashed with a black light. In the blink of an eye, the warrior's body turned into colorful steam that scattered in every direction.
<br><br>
When they saw this scene unfold right in front of them, all the other warriors were frightened. The Evil God slayed the warrior in such a way they had never seen before.
<br><br>
Even if what he said was true, this was totally uncalled for. Whether or not there would be a next round of chaos, there was no need to kill anyone so recklessly.
<br><br>
At that very moment, they realized that the seemingly generous Evil God was never a good person in the first place.
<br><br>
A short while ago, they were looking forward to being chosen as the Chaos Ancient Gods. But now, they changed their minds. They were afraid that the light would envelope them, which in turn, would prompt the Evil God to kill them.
<br><br>
Buzz! Once again, someone had been chosen.
<br><br>
The second beam of light appeared.
<br><br>
It shot directly into the primitive land and fell upon the Pear Hill. It landed on Fuxi who was currently standing on the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess and the others saw this, they were slightly astounded. After a second, they smiled as they understood why he was chosen.
<br><br>
In this current chaotic era, Fuxi had never given up on achieving the Finale Way. Therefore, it was not surprising that he was chosen as a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
However, Fuxi smiled bitterly. "I've worked so hard for so long. But in the end, I still can't live up to the expectations of the human race. Is this supposed to be a compensation for me?"
<br><br>
"Well, this kind of compensation can never be fulfilled," joked the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Obviously, they were well-aware that this was the last chaotic era and there would be no next one after this.
<br><br>
Afterward, came the third, fourth, fifth, sixth beams of light.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, they all landed in the black hall of the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God killed three Holy Soul Realm cultivators and one Eternal Realm cultivator on the spot. Everyone watching the massacre was rendered speechless.
<br><br>
After the Chaos Ancient Gods were chosen, the chaos began to clean up itself.
<br><br>
This was done to ensure that all living beings within the chaos would be annihilated. However, there were no living beings within the chaos due to the downgrading. Like the last thunder, this round of purging had no effect.
<br><br>
Three days passed since that fateful day.
<br><br>
There were lots of intricate cracks that suddenly appeared on the inner wall of the chaos.
<br><br>
These cracks intertwined with each other and formed a huge circular array. Little by little, a needle appeared in the center of the array.
<br><br>
When the needle first emerged, it was only the size of an embroidery needle. It was particularly tiny compared to the vast Source World.
<br><br>
However, the needle continued to extend outwards.
<br><br>
At first, it was only a one-inch protrusion. Then, it extended from ten inches to a hundred inches.
<br><br>
After a while, it became ten feet long. Then from a hundred feet, it reached a thousand feet.
<br><br>
From that, it continued to grow until it extended up to ten million feet! The needle grew not only in length, but also in its diameter. It continued to expand further. In just an hour, it had already expanded into a massive object.
<br><br>
As soon as the needle appeared, the sentry Evil God and Zen immediately noticed it.
<br><br>
An idea flashed through their minds almost at the same time. Who would be the first target of this needle? Usually, there was only one primitive land in a chaotic era. But in this round of chaos, there were three. Which of those primitive lands would the needle attack first? Meanwhile, there was something happening in the Burial Land.
<br><br>
The downgrader was floating in mid-air.
<br><br>
There was a complicated array plate right in front of him. This was exactly the same as the array that hatched the needle.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King said, "The structure of the secondary world is quite exquisite. The hourglass is the one controlling the restart time. After that, the needle will end everything and signal the beginning of the next chaos.
<br><br>
I applaud you!"
<br><br>
It was the downgrader who invented the method of creating secondary worlds. In order to downgrade the main world, he designed the aforementioned method in advance. He did this to deceive the Snake Spirit King and trick the Four Spirits Sect into building one secondary world after another.
<br><br>
This must seem shameful to the Snake Spirit King. Nonetheless, he had to flatter the downgrader.
<br><br>
"Humph! This method of the Lower Extreme World is awfully insignificant!" the downgrader exclaimed as he fiddled with the array plate.
<br><br>
The needle had already become incredibly massive. It changed its direction constantly and continued to grow at an even faster rate.
<br><br>
The sentry Evil God was watching all this. Suddenly, his expression became serious.
<br><br>
He confirmed that the needle was heading straight for the Source World.
<br><br>
Chapter 4283 The Black Hole And The White Hole Inside the black hall, the Evil God had received the warning from the sentry.
<br><br>
"The Source World would be targeted first... That bastard surely is looking down on me, huh?" The Evil God was vexed at the information.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven, who was standing next to him, smiled faintly and said, "If I remember it correctly, it was the 300th chaotic era when the twin primitive lands appeared. When the first primitive land was destroyed by the needle, it didn't take long before the second was also destroyed. They might not be destroyed at the same time, but there was no exception in the face of the needle."
<br><br>
However, they didn't know that the needle of the end could actually be controlled.
<br><br>
The only reason why the Source World was targeted first was because the downgrader felt that it was much easier to deal with.
<br><br>
The sentry had released the Illusory Vision many times, which also aroused the vigilance of the downgrader. He found out that there were people in the Source World who could control the power of the Deep Space, but they only relied on the Soul Extreme Form, which was why the downgrader didn't really deem it as a threat.
<br><br>
On the other hand, his real problem was Zen, who had already mastered the Heavenly Ring Staff and possessed all the powers of the Deep Space.
<br><br>
Needless to say, it would be difficult for him to deal with Zen right now.
<br><br>
"What are you going to do?" Duran asked "We need to come up with something very soon."
<br><br>
The Evil God contemplated for a while before he looked and asked Duran, "Your Treacherous Being body should be immortal, right?"
<br><br>
"Well technically, as long as the coordinates aren't damaged, and there's no presence of the Light of Annihilation, it's impossible to harm or kill the Treacherous Being body," Duran said confidently.
<br><br>
"I see. Then, how about you help me with something?" the Evil God said as if he already thought of something to overturn the situation.
<br><br>
"I'm listening. What are you planning?" Duran asked.
<br><br>
A devilish grin appeared on the face of the Evil God as he said, "Well, I'm just thinking of doing something to startle the downgrader, so he'll realize that he can't just look down upon me."
<br><br>
As of the moment, the needle was still elongating, like a massive bamboo that was growing like crazy. It wouldn't stop until it crushed its target.
<br><br>
The needle was extending at an incredible rate, but the distance between it and the Source World was also immense. At its current speed, it would still take about two more days before the needle reached its target.
<br><br>
At the same time, on the jadeite platform, Zen also gathered everyone to discuss and prepare the countermeasures.
<br><br>
There, Geoffrey, Rocher, Kincaid, Hilario, the remaining energy souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and the other human heroes, as well as the avatars of the three Chaos Ancient Gods, assembled upon Zen's call.
<br><br>
Although the end of the chaos was almost upon them, they were still able to keep calm and think straight.
<br><br>
In this round of chaos, they were able to master and acquire power that was far stronger than the needle. With that, it shouldn't be that difficult for them to handle it.
<br><br>
"Father, the end of the chaos is coming soon. Let me fight!" Geoffrey volunteered with all sincerity.
<br><br>
Right now, there was an inexplicable power that was surging in his body.
<br><br>
The power was plain but powerful, and it was actually superior to the current powers of the other Eternal Realm masters and the three Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
Zen recognized Geoffrey's power and fighting spirit, but he said, "Geoffrey, you will definitely be a great help, but you can't make a move yet."
<br><br>
"Huh? Why?" Geoffrey was a bit confused. If his father had really recognized his power, wouldn't he be given the chance? "It's because the needle is not aimed at us," Zen replied. "It's actually aimed towards the Source World."
<br><br>
When everyone heard this, there was an instant expression of relief on their faces. The extreme tension had somehow subsided.
<br><br>
"Really? Then, it gives us a bit more time."
<br><br>
"Let's wait and see what will happen first."
<br><br>
"If the needle was aimed at the Source World, then the Evil God would surely suffer."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyebrows slightly twitched, and she butted in, "We can't relax yet! Don't underestimate the Evil God. There's a huge chance that he would be able to deal with the needle. Moreover, with his twisted personality, we don't know what kind of trouble he may cause to us. We'd better be careful."
<br><br>
Previously, the Evil God expressed an intention to join hands with Zen.
<br><br>
However, no one could really trust his words.
<br><br>
"The Snake Goddess is right. Indeed, we have to be on guard against the Evil God, but we have to remember that we should be more vigilant towards the downgrader. I'm sure that he will make a move once the Source World is already attacked. I'm afraid that we can't just watch idly,"
<br><br>
Fuxi also expressed his opinion.
<br><br>
The Evil God was pretty known as a detestable and wicked person, but his destructive power couldn't be compared to the terror that the downgrader could bring.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Evil God couldn't downgrade the world. Though the chances were slim, if he managed to win in the end, he still wouldn't be able to destroy everything according to the will of the Bird Spirit King.
<br><br>
Zen listened to everything they had said and nodded. "Right now, we can only wait until the needle arrives at the Source World. Once it's there, we shall act according to the circumstances. If the Evil God would be at a disadvantage, we'll have no choice but to help him."
<br><br>
Each round of chaos produced a different civilization, and the way they treated the needle also varied.
<br><br>
Once, there was a civilization that accurately predicted where the needle would come from. Thus, they had set up a big array on the inner wall of the chaos in advance, in an attempt to seal the needle outside of the chaos and eliminate it on its bud. However, their plan still failed in the end.
<br><br>
Still, some civilizations went all out and set up enchanted barriers to block the growing needle. However, they weren't able to fight off the power of the needle.
<br><br>
The 77th civilization, which was the human race, settled for a mediocre method. Like most civilizations before them, they guarded the primitive land and only relied on the most powerful Other Shore Tokens to gather their power on a human ancestor. They hoped that a single human would be able to resist the needle, but as expected, it ended in failure.
<br><br>
After that, over a thousand chaotic eras had passed, and all sorts of strange civilizations had appeared. There were so many ways to resist the needle, but no one managed to succeed.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, the creatures in this round of chaos were not prepared at all.
<br><br>
Even as the needle approached, the three primitive lands that existed didn't take any action to directly prevent it.
<br><br>
Two days later, the needle already appeared about fifty million miles away from the Source World and was fast approaching.
<br><br>
"It's here! It's coming!"
<br><br>
A faint grin appeared on the face of the Evil God acting as a sentry, as he shook the black chains.
<br><br>
Within five minutes, the needle was just thirty million miles away from the Source World.
<br><br>
Another five minutes had elapsed, and the needle was only ten million miles away.
<br><br>
Five million miles...
<br><br>
One million miles...
<br><br>
Five hundred thousand miles...
<br><br>
One hundred thousand miles...
<br><br>
Finally, at this distance, the sentry could already observe it pretty well.
<br><br>
The front end of the needle was very thin, as thin as an embroidery needle, but the diameter of the entire needle was actually as huge as the Source World. Therefore, the needle would not necessarily pierce through the Source World, but would rather crush everything in it.
<br><br>
Fifty thousand miles...
<br><br>
Ten thousand miles...
<br><br>
Three thousand miles...
<br><br>
At this distance, the front end of the needle had almost landed on the surface of the Source World.
<br><br>
"What the hell are they waiting for?" The sentry stared intently at what was happening.
<br><br>
"What's going on? Aren't they going to do anything?" Zen murmured to himself, baffled at the strange behavior of the people in the Source World.
<br><br>
The six pairs of compound eyes of the downgrader also flashed. He couldn't see any movement or reaction in the Source World. "Do they give up resisting and just accept their death? Pathetic," the downgrader said in a low voice.
<br><br>
However, when the needle was just within a thousand miles, a space fluctuation suddenly occurred in front of it.
<br><br>
Then, it was Duran who appeared in front of the needle.
<br><br>
Compared to the point of the needle, Duran almost looked negligible.
<br><br>
But there was no hint of fear on his face. He just raised his wings and rushed forward.
<br><br>
Crack! The great momentum of the needle caused it to pierce through Duran's body, and instantly came out from his back.
<br><br>
Duran didn't stop the needle at all. Instead, he was pushed by the needle towards the Source World.
<br><br>
Upon seeing that they were about to hit the Source World, he smiled and shouted, "Now!"
<br><br>
"Waah! Waah! Waah!"
<br><br>
Strange blaring voices were heard from within his body.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a black hole was released from Duran's body and expanded at an unimaginable speed. In just three seconds, the black hole expanded from the size of a person to the size of the entire Source World.
<br><br>
Then, the needle that was about to hit the Source World, drilled into the huge black hole.
<br><br>
"Waah! Waah! Waah!"
<br><br>
At the same time, a white hole appeared on the other side of the Source World.
<br><br>
It also expanded to the size of the Source World, and it faced the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Chapter 4284 The In And Out Holes Zen watched warily as the white hole formed rapidly, the needle drilling out from within it.
<br><br>
The needle itself still continued to extend at incredible speed.
<br><br>
The distance between the Burial Land and the Source World was not too big, and the needle steadily approached the Burial Land.
<br><br>
From the jadeite platform, Zen projected this shocking scene, so that everyone could see it.
<br><br>
"Is this a space channel?" Kendrick asked, his eyes widening with shock.
<br><br>
Everyone could tell that the black hole and the white hole were two ends of a space channel.
<br><br>
It was relatively simple to construct a space channel, but it definitely was no easy feat to build a space channel big enough for the needle to pass through. This space channel was so large that it could fit the entire Source World! "They are the In and Out Holes built from the Hyperspace Extreme Form," Zen explained calmly.
<br><br>
The black hole swallowed everything in its path, whereas the white hole served as the exit for everything that entered the black hole.
<br><br>
Once the needle entered through the black hole, there was nowhere else for it to go but the exit through white hole.
<br><br>
"What an incredible method!" the Snake Goddess praised, beaming with awe.
<br><br>
"I don't know how the downgrader will deal with this. The needle is moving so fast!" Kincaid said excitedly.
<br><br>
The Evil God had built the In and Out Holes right in the nick of time, and the needle was now approaching the Burial Land.
<br><br>
It would've been fine if the downgrader had prepared in advance. But now, since it was so sudden, it was difficult for him to change the direction of the needle.
<br><br>
Three hundred miles.
<br><br>
One hundred miles.
<br><br>
Ten miles.
<br><br>
One mile.
<br><br>
The needle was so close to piercing the Burial Land...
<br><br>
Suddenly, the needle abruptly stopped in its path. It was as though a giant hand had grabbed it with force.
<br><br>
In the Burial Land, the plate in front of the downgrader had turned a dark red. In the face of danger, he had chosen to forcefully stop the needle. A trace of anger was revealed in his six pairs of eyes; he never expected that the Evil God would master the Hyperspace Extreme Form, much less that he would fall into such a trap.
<br><br>
The Burial Land had almost been destroyed just now.
<br><br>
Everyone on the jadeite platform was shocked at the turn of events.
<br><br>
"Why did the needle stop?"
<br><br>
"The needle isn't long enough to reach the Burial Land?"
<br><br>
"No," the Snake Goddess said, her eyes growing misty. "The needle is controlled by the downgrader, and the Source World is the first target chosen by him."
<br><br>
The other people exchanged surprised glances. What the Snake Goddess said was logical.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Meanwhile, from the sentry Evil God's perspective, his eyes almost popped out of his head when he saw what happened.
<br><br>
His real self's expression darkened. He immediately arrived at the same conclusion as the Snake Goddess. "So it's true. The needle is really controlled by the downgrader! I won't stand for this!"
<br><br>
Since the needle stopped in its tracks, it just stood still, a mile away from the Burial Land.
<br><br>
After a while, a black dot appeared on the surface of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Quickly, it grew to be a large black hole.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, a black hole had been built by the downgrader by using the Hyperspace Extreme Form. After he had created the hole, he did something to the plate in front of him, and the red color that lingered on the plate disappeared. The needle once again began to move forward.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Using the exact same technique, the downgrader turned the tables on them. As the huge needle plunged into the black hole, another white hole appeared above the Source World. Once more, the needle was steadily advancing towards the Source World! The needle had ended many rounds of chaos, and every time it could do that in an instant.
<br><br>
No matter how powerful an Other Shore Token was, no one could change the needle's course.
<br><br>
By now, the direction of the needle had been changed four times in a row.
<br><br>
Yet, it continued to plough forward through the distorted space.
<br><br>
As he watched the needle rush towards the Source World, the Evil God found that he no longer felt indignant. Instead, he felt quite excited.
<br><br>
He figured that the downgrader viewed him as insignificant, since he dared attack his Source World first. With a sinister smile, the Evil God vowed he would make the downgrader regret choosing him as a target.
<br><br>
Buzz! As he waved his hand slightly, the Hyperspace Extreme Form was activated once more.
<br><br>
The power of the Deep Space was incredible, but it consumed too much energy each time.
<br><br>
Building a set of In and Out Holes for the needle was extremely taxing to the Evil God, since he needed to continuously draw power from the Source World.
<br><br>
But now that he was in high spirits, he no longer cared about how much it cost.
<br><br>
A new set of In and Out Holes appeared. The black hole and the white hole appeared at the same time, sending the needle back.
<br><br>
Soon, the third set of holes appeared.
<br><br>
Once more, the needle was heading towards the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Seeing the needle being sent back again, the downgrader sneered. He saw the Evil God's message loud and clear—he was being challenged.
<br><br>
"I don't know how much Extreme Form energy you have mastered, but is the energy of the Source World enough to defeat me? I'll just keep returning the needle to you!"
<br><br>
Buzz! The downgrader built yet another set of holes, reverting the course of the needle back to the Source World.
<br><br>
The downgrader smiled confidently. Since the Evil God built several holes in such a short time, he figured the energy of the Source World would be depleted rapidly. Ultimately, once the energy was used up, it would collapse.
<br><br>
The downgrader was so sure of this, so he chose to deal with the Source World first.
<br><br>
In comparison, Zen was much more difficult to deal with, because his ancestry-level bloodline could provide endless energy.
<br><br>
Seeing that the needle was sent back again, the Evil God frowned slightly.
<br><br>
Turning around, he stared at the primitive land floating nearby.
<br><br>
"Zen, you idle fool. Don't just watch the battle from afar. Come help me!"
<br><br>
Once he'd finished speaking, the Evil God abruptly whipped around to build the fifth set of holes.
<br><br>
Once again, the black hole swallowed the needle, but this time, its white hole was facing Zen's primitive land! Meanwhile, on the jadeite platform, everyone had been focused on the movements of the needle.
<br><br>
The needle that had changed its direction so many times in a row looked like a big snake that was coiling around the space. Seeing such a huge thing moving rapidly, everyone was both anxious yet transfixed.
<br><br>
This was the needle that would end the chaos! It was a terrible weapon that had annihilated over a thousand civilizations.
<br><br>
However, now it was being practically toyed with by the Evil God and the downgrader! "Ah, the white hole!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey cried when he saw the white hole appear facing his father's primitive land.
<br><br>
Everyone wore a nervous expression as they eyed the needle steadily approaching.
<br><br>
If it wasn't stopped, the needle would crash into the primitive land in a matter of seconds, crushing the Pear Hill, the Ruin Graveyard, and the other places.
<br><br>
"Of course, the Evil God wants us involved," Zen said, as though he had been expecting this.
<br><br>
The Evil God knew perfectly well where Zen's position was, so he had shifted the needle's target to his primitive land.
<br><br>
However, Zen was well prepared, so he didn't panic. As he pointed a finger to the skies, an avatar slowly floated up. A ball of energy floated above his head; it was the Hyperspace Extreme Form.
<br><br>
The sixth set of holes were created by Zen.
<br><br>
As usual, the black hole swallowed the needle in one gulp, but Zen didn't return it to the Evil God. Instead, the white hole faced the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Once again, the massive needle was charging towards the downgrader.
<br><br>
Chapter 4285 Hold On "Ha-ha, you are united," the downgrader sneered.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King said beside him, "We can't redirect the path of the needle indefinitely."
<br><br>
"I can constantly create the In and Out Holes, and Zen can also do so. But how can that being from the Source World also do this?" the downgrader asked.
<br><br>
Like Zen, his energy did not originate from the primitive land. He had boundless energy and could create limitless In and Out Holes.
<br><br>
But the Source World couldn't do this.
<br><br>
This temporary balance would sooner or later be destroyed because of the energy drain from the Source World.
<br><br>
The downgrader was in no rush. As time ticked by, the situation would more and more turn in his favor.
<br><br>
He stretched out his hand, and the seventh set of In and Out Holes appeared. The needle flew towards the Source World.
<br><br>
Without saying a word, the Evil God waved his hand and released the eighth set of holes.
<br><br>
He didn't let Zen be an onlooker. He directed the needle towards Zen's primitive land.
<br><br>
However, once he released the eighth set of holes, his expression became cautious.
<br><br>
Although the Source World had expanded by more than a thousand times, and the energy contained within it was much powerful than it used to be, the energy required to create the holes was massive. The Evil God had released four sets of holes in rapid succession, which had consumed most of the Source World's energy. If he continued to release more holes, the Source World would probably not survive this.
<br><br>
But now that things had picked up momentum, there was no way out of this for the Evil God.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the first one who couldn't hold on would lose.
<br><br>
Soon, Zen created the ninth set of holes.
<br><br>
The downgrader released the tenth set.
<br><br>
The Evil God unleashed the eleventh set.
<br><br>
The twelfth set.
<br><br>
The thirteenth set.
<br><br>
The needle drilled in and out of the black and white holes. It had already zigzagged to and fro thirteen times, and it was now heading towards the Source World.
<br><br>
"The Hyperspace Extreme Form!"
<br><br>
The Evil God tried to release the fourteenth set of holes.
<br><br>
He absorbed the remaining energy of the Source World and began to transform it into the holes, but the process was abruptly cut off halfway.
<br><br>
The energy of the Source World had been utterly spent! The Evil God raised his eyebrows, his eyes revealing rare traces of uneasiness.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven observed the change in the Evil God. He knew clearly how much the drain on the Extreme Form energy was. The Evil God probably wouldn't be able to hold on for long.
<br><br>
The needle was still careening ahead at an extreme velocity. Almost half a minute later, it would hit the Source World.
<br><br>
At this moment, the corners of the Evil God's mouth suddenly curved up, forming a leering smile.
<br><br>
'When did I become so indecisive?' he thought.
<br><br>
In the past, he had been so cold that he could sacrifice everything to reach his goal: his future, family, strength, status, and even his own life. All he craved was to defeat Zen.
<br><br>
Now that he took control of the Source World, he unwittingly became softhearted. He began to care about Edna and Shera, who had tried her best to please him, and also the numerous living beings in the Source World.
<br><br>
Once people began to care, they developed weaknesses.
<br><br>
The Evil God realized that in caring, he would suffer a complete failure.
<br><br>
"The Source World is so vast and boundless. It should have much more than just a little energy," the Evil God muttered darkly.
<br><br>
His will was transmitted through the Source World, and soon it arrived in a province belonging to the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
Humans dwelt there.
<br><br>
When the will of the Evil God was felt, everyone in the province raised their heads.
<br><br>
The citizens, the True Gods, and even the warriors at the Other Shore Realm were all terrified when they felt this indomitable will. They didn't know what fate awaited them.
<br><br>
"The Source World is in grave danger. You must offer yourselves to save it." The booming voice of the Evil God rang in everyone's ears.
<br><br>
Hearing this, everyone was immediately overcome by an ominous feeling.
<br><br>
They were being told to sacrifice themselves! For what? Why did they have to sacrifice themselves to save the vast majority? Needless to say, they were most reluctant.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God didn't offer them any alternatives.
<br><br>
Splash! Some plants, soil, sand, and stones quickly rose up into the air, turning into fine powder and finally disintegrating.
<br><br>
Then the rocks, houses, animals, and people who were still resisting were all sucked into the air by an irresistible force where they also disintegrated and dissipated.
<br><br>
In the end, the many layers of the ground, the caves, the bed rocks underneath, and even the creatures hiding underground were also sucked into the air and disintegrated.
<br><br>
They were not destroyed. Instead, they were all transformed into energy.
<br><br>
Before long, the Evil God had transformed everything in the province into energy, leaving behind only a layer of crushed shell that was three or four miles thick. If this thin layer of shell was converted into energy, an opening would be created in the Source World, and this would let Zen and the downgrader notice the weakness of the Source World.
<br><br>
More and more provinces suffered the same fate.
<br><br>
Hundreds of billions of creatures from hundreds of races in more than thirty huge provinces were all deprived of their lives, and their bodies were consumed after they heard the words of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Everything happened in less than ten seconds.
<br><br>
The energy gained from these living materials successfully created the fourteenth set of holes for the Evil God.
<br><br>
A Holy Soul Realm master was engrossed with his cultivating in the black hall of the Evil God. He was one of the masters invited by the Evil God.
<br><br>
He possessed dozens of life tokens of his clansmen. The moment the province he had called home was destroyed, all these life tokens were shattered.
<br><br>
"What happened?" the warrior screamed in agony and took out a large bronze mirror. In the mirror, he saw the empty province. Every living thing in the province had disappeared. "Oh, my God! What happened to the province? It is gone? Why is everything gone?"
<br><br>
He was not the only one to be shocked. A member of another race also discovered that the Life Lamps of his clansmen had been extinguished.
<br><br>
Although he couldn't detect what was going on with his clansmen, he reasoned they must have suffered the same fate.
<br><br>
"Shh!"
<br><br>
The real Evil God suddenly appeared next to the warrior, held his neck with one hand, and made a gesture of silence towards the crowd with the other. "They have all been sacrificed for the Source World. You should be beholden to me. If I didn't do that, you would have perished too."
<br><br>
"I..." The warrior clenched his fists, exposing blue veins.
<br><br>
However, when the Evil God clamped his neck so gently, all of his strength vanished, and there was no possibility of him resisting. Every muscle and bone in his body turned into powder, and then into energy.
<br><br>
"You not only need to know devotion, but also your place." The Evil God grinned at the crowd and then walked towards the third floor.
<br><br>
Although the Evil God had decisively sacrificed dozens of provinces at the last moment, the speed at which he created the holes was slower than normal, which allowed Zen and the downgrader to discover some clues.
<br><br>
"The Evil God released the holes when the needle was only five hundred miles away from the Source World. The energy of the Source World may not be enough," the Snake Goddess keenly observed.
<br><br>
"That's to be expected. When limited energy faces off against infinite energy, it's not hard to imagine the end," Kincaid said, shaking his head.
<br><br>
Zen, the Evil God, and the downgrader all possessed Extreme Form energy, so they seemed to be standing shoulder to shoulder at the starting line, but the Evil God and the Source World would surely be the first to fall behind.
<br><br>
Zen didn't say anything and focused on releasing the fifteenth set of holes.
<br><br>
The sixteenth set.
<br><br>
The seventeenth set.
<br><br>
The eighteenth set.
<br><br>
These huge holes overlapped in a most complicated way.
<br><br>
Although the needle resolutely moved forward, it was difficult to distinguish its intended goal.
<br><br>
By the time the Evil God had released the twentieth set of holes, he had sacrificed over a hundred provinces! Chapter 4286 The Maximum Number Of In And Out Holes A long time ago, Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and Othniel also attempted to destroy many provinces in the Source World.
<br><br>
Back then, they used the Minimum Spaces' flames to burn down about three hundred provinces.
<br><br>
However, they weren't fully destroyed.
<br><br>
Although life was burned, the substances that comprised them were still there, and the foundation for nurturing these substances was still present.
<br><br>
The entire sea was evaporated by the blazing flames, but the water just turned into rain and returned to the ground.
<br><br>
However, this time, the Evil God transformed all the materials in the world into pure energy that formed the enormous In and Out Holes. This kind of drastic destruction would never be reversed.
<br><br>
In the face of the aggressive and terrifying downgrader, the Evil God could only come up with such a method.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Burial Land, a blue light film was unfolded in front of the downgrader.
<br><br>
At the center of this light film, a huge sphere appeared. This sphere was actually the Source World, and its surface was covered with dark blue spots.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! What are you thinking?" The downgrader let out a loud burst of laughter. "Turning such a massive amount of materials into pure energy is like quenching your thirst by drinking poison. Let's see how long you could hold on."
<br><br>
At the same time, on the jadeite platform, there was also a blue light film that appeared in front of Zen. From it, Zen could sense the miserable situation the Evil God was in.
<br><br>
"It seems that the Evil God has already consumed more than a hundred provinces. So many living beings in the Source World have suffered and were sacrificed," Zen said with a frown on his face.
<br><br>
"Well, from the perspective of the Evil God, he is doing the right thing,"
<br><br>
Kincaid said. "It is necessary to sacrifice those provinces, or else, all of the creatures of the Source World would be annihilated."
<br><br>
"But if all the materials of the Source World are consumed, then there's no point in fighting," the Snake Goddess remarked.
<br><br>
Zen nodded as his thoughts aligned exactly to what the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
However, Hilario, who had kept silent all this time, suddenly said, "It's still early to say that..."
<br><br>
Kincaid, Zen, the Snake Goddess, and the others looked at him as they heard what he said.
<br><br>
As the leader of the Bold Conjecture House, Hilario was known to be an extremely knowledgeable and talented person. At this moment, he might have other insight that none of them had thought of yet.
<br><br>
"Can all of you easily construct a space channel?" Hilario then asked them.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the others nodded. It was, in fact, very easy for them to do it.
<br><br>
Then, Hilario stretched out two of his fingers. Suddenly, a power of space burst out from his fingertips and a thin space channel was instantly formed.
<br><br>
Immediately after, a second space channel was formed. Then, a third, and a fourth...
<br><br>
Just within seconds, he was able to construct a thousand space channels.
<br><br>
"Hilario, what are you trying to do?" Even Kincaid was quite confused at what Hilario was trying to prove.
<br><br>
However, Hilario didn't answer and just continued to build numerous space channels. When he had created about one thousand and five hundred space channels, these space channels between his hands suddenly became extremely unstable. The originally well-arranged space channels started to intertwine with each other, and ultimately, they exploded.
<br><br>
The moment the explosion happened, Hilario gently rubbed his hands and the mass of energy that exploded immediately vanished.
<br><br>
"I still don't get it. How is it related to what the Evil God is trying to do?"
<br><br>
Fuxi couldn't help but ask in confusion.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was the first to state her hypothesis. "The number of space channels in an area should only be limited. If there are too many, they would become unstable and collapse..."
<br><br>
She had actually done similar experiments before, but she didn't think of this concept.
<br><br>
"So, what you're trying to say is..." Zen's eyes narrowed as he kind of understood what was going on inside Hilario's head.
<br><br>
"The space power contained in the In and Out Holes is several times stronger. Like what I've demonstrated earlier, if there would be many In and Out Holes in the same area, they will all easily collapse," Hilario explained.
<br><br>
"Then, how many In and Out Holes can this area bear?" Kincaid asked straightforwardly.
<br><br>
Hilario furrowed his eyebrows while shaking his head. "I can't say the exact number. Maybe twenty, thirty, or even more..."
<br><br>
"If the In and Out Holes collapse, will the needle in the hole also be destroyed?" Fuxi asked as he started to understand where the thought was headed.
<br><br>
However, Hilario still shook his head.
<br><br>
He couldn't give any definite answer because he could only speculate based on his own knowledge. Besides, it was the first time that someone came up with this idea to deal with the needle. It was impossible to actually know what could happen.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen released twenty-first set of In and Out Holes.
<br><br>
Then, another set of In and Out Holes was released by the downgrader.
<br><br>
The Evil God responded by releasing another set, making it the twentythird in the area.
<br><br>
The competition that took place after the needle appeared became anticlimactic.
<br><br>
But obviously, it wouldn't end up in a stalemate, because the Evil God couldn't hold on much longer.
<br><br>
Every time he transformed some of the Source World's provinces, the Holy Soul Realm warriors and the Eternal Realm warriors on his side would cringe and show a depressed expression. However, they didn't dare to say anything to the Evil God. Right now, it was the Evil God who was deciding on everything. If they would go against him, they might be the ones transformed into energy.
<br><br>
Even the Grandmaster of Heaven didn't say anything, though his face was also incomparably grim. At the back of his mind, he knew that if this went on, they would definitely lose.
<br><br>
Not long after, the downgrader released the thirty-first set of In and Out Holes, increasing the number of holes in the area to sixty-two. The needle passed through the maze of holes, making it impossible to determine where was the front end and the back end.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, the Evil God transformed over thirty provinces and released a black hole again.
<br><br>
However, at this moment, something unusual started happening.
<br><br>
The surroundings of the black hole became slightly distorted.
<br><br>
The more unusual thing was that the distorted ripples around this black hole also appeared in other black holes.
<br><br>
Upon seeing this, the Evil God revealed a devilish smile. "Finally..."
<br><br>
The real Evil God had tens of thousands of avatars, and each one of them possessed exceptional intelligence.
<br><br>
According to what they agreed upon with the real Evil God, these avatars took action independently and carried out all sorts of odd experiments that usually involved the space power.
<br><br>
From the start, the Evil God knew that with such a large number of In and Out Holes, they would inevitably collapse soon enough. This was actually what he was waiting for.
<br><br>
Crash! Then, the Evil God released another white hole, and ripples of space fluctuations also appeared around it.
<br><br>
When the ripples spread to the other white holes, all of the In and Out Holes began to sway left and right. One moment, they were expanding; the next they were shrinking. Just as Hilario deduced, the huge space channels finally became extremely unstable.
<br><br>
As a rigid body, the needle would definitely conflict with all of the unstable In and Out Holes.
<br><br>
Some of the holes that shrank tightly held the needle. The space and the needle violently rubbed against each other, producing ear-piercing sound waves in the entire chaos. As the other holes expanded, they also collided with the needle inside, causing even stronger space distortion.
<br><br>
Right now, the space was in utter disarray.
<br><br>
"It's really happening! With the thirty-two set of In and Out Holes, the space couldn't bear them!" the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord exclaimed in surprise as he witnessed the chaos.
<br><br>
"But it doesn't seem like the In and Out Holes could do anything with the needle. I think it is withstanding the violent reactions of the holes!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey said as he observed.
<br><br>
"It would actually be better if the needle is cut off by the broken In and Out Holes. The three primitive lands would only be impacted by the space windstorm..." Hilario said in a gloomy tone.
<br><br>
"But what if it can't be cut off?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"I'm not sure, but theoretically, if the needle is able to bear that great force, it would still be compressed and twisted by the power of the space."
<br><br>
Hilario demonstrated by showing a crooked finger. "Then it would straighten up!"
<br><br>
He continued demonstrating and flicked his finger.
<br><br>
With his explanation, the others easily understood what he meant.
<br><br>
The needle would become as thin as a steel rope, and the great force that it would release would destroy everything it came into contact with.
<br><br>
Just as Hilario finished his demonstration, all of the In and Out Holes suddenly collapsed simultaneously, leaving many pieces of needles floating in the air. The needle was not actually broken, but it was the illusion created after the space was wrecked.
<br><br>
The moment that the In and Out Holes collapsed, the pieces of the needle began twisting like countless frantic leeches.
<br><br>
Chapter 4287 The Gamble Of Life The needle, twisted and distorted badly, trembled violently as it tried to return to its original straight profile. If it wanted to forcefully break the space, it had to be connected as a whole.
<br><br>
This was a fight of physics. The needle represented an indestructible mass, but the space had been separated. Consequently, the aftermath was extreme.
<br><br>
All kinds of shock waves burst and rippled outwards.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! A huge claw-shaped shock wave swept towards Zen's primitive land, gouging out a large chunk from its surface. Another shock wave drilled into the earth, leaving a pit that was dozens of miles deep.
<br><br>
While Zen's primitive land and the downgrader's Burial Land were caught in the line of fire, they were both solid enough to bear the impact.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God had transformed the materials in many large provinces into energy. Consequently, many parts of the Source World were weakened. When the shock waves rained onto the Source World, it cracked like an eggshell.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, the entire surface of the Source World was riddled with holes.
<br><br>
Fortunately, no materials or creatures had been left in these provinces, so it wasn't that big a deal. However, the proud Evil God couldn't tolerate this easily.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! After a few moments of twisting and turning, the indestructible needle finally broke the rules of space.
<br><br>
The space that bound and distorted the needle broke, and the parts of the needle began to connect again.
<br><br>
Even though the segments of the needle connected, it was still crooked, since it was forcibly twisted by the In and Out Holes.
<br><br>
Then, the needle tried to return to its originally straight state, moving like an uncontrollable metal whip that was lashing around violently.
<br><br>
It smashed anything in its way, without exception.
<br><br>
Splash! A deafening sound of grinding metal echoed throughout the space as the needle tried to stretch back to a straight profile, a small crooked part of it shooting towards the Burial Land.
<br><br>
"What in the world..."
<br><br>
The downgrader's eyes widened as he saw the incoming needle.
<br><br>
He initially had absolute advantage over the whole situation.
<br><br>
He had felt like the Source World didn't even qualify to join this battle, and figured they would be the first to suffer.
<br><br>
Even he could tell that the Evil God was trying to drag out his feeble existence at this point.
<br><br>
Yet, how did the tables turn so suddenly? Splash! As the needle whipped towards the Burial Land at a terrifying speed, the downgrader's eyes darted all over the place as he tried to come up with a solution. He wanted to build a hole, but the space in this area was still in chaos, so that was out of the question.
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
the downgrader shouted, as he controlled the array plate in front of him.
<br><br>
The entire plate was then enveloped in a red light.
<br><br>
What happened next was exactly the opposite of what he wanted.
<br><br>
While he could control the extending speed of the needle, reduce the extending speed to zero, and even force the needle to shrink back, he couldn't change the direction of the needle.
<br><br>
Moreover, the huge stress contained in the needle from having been twisted was outside his control.
<br><br>
As a result, he wasn't able to stop the needle.
<br><br>
To his horror, the needle continued heading towards the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Crack! Rumble! The collision made a deafeningly thunderous noise.
<br><br>
One of the three corners of the Burial Land had been smashed into smithereens.
<br><br>
Inside this corner was a huge space, where countless Troubled Creatures lived. They had been clamoring and raising their morale, as they were preparing to join the upcoming war.
<br><br>
But before the real war had even started, the skies began to crumble before them.
<br><br>
Broken pieces of the sky, together with a huge silver creature, fell to the earth. The Troubled Creatures were swept away in the blink of an eye; they didn't even have the time to scream.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The Burial Land was originally in a stagnant state, but once one of its corners was hit, the remaining kinetic energy pushed itself to spin.
<br><br>
Fortunately, after colliding into the Burial Land's corner, that specific curved part of the needle instantly straightened out and did not cause any further damage.
<br><br>
However, there were many other curved parts of the needle that were still moving irregularly, trying to straighten out.
<br><br>
On the jadeite platform, Zen and his companions were dumbfounded as they watched this scene unfold before them.
<br><br>
Although Hilario had expected this, even he was taken aback.
<br><br>
"The Evil God...
<br><br>
Was this his plan from the very beginning? This is horrible! He is gambling his own life," the Snake Goddess said, her eyebrows furrowing deeply.
<br><br>
Zen didn't spare any time to speak. He focused on controlling the primitive land, avoiding the needle as best as he could.
<br><br>
A fifth of the Burial Land had been destroyed after one of its corners was hit. If it was hit by the needle head-on, it was doomed.
<br><br>
The same went for Zen's primitive land; unfortunately, it was so vast that it was hard to navigate in such a way that they could avoid the needle completely.
<br><br>
As the primitive land moved slowly, the needle whipped around violently.
<br><br>
Then, its bent head shot in the primitive land's direction at a frightening speed.
<br><br>
Everyone on the jadeite platform raised their heads in unison.
<br><br>
A huge tear appeared on the blood red sky, as if a pair of scissors had cut open the blood red cloth, revealing the chaos outside.
<br><br>
It seemed the huge needle had shot forward enough to pierce through the primitive land's skies, but it had stopped there and whipped back.
<br><br>
Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
If the needle had hacked down any further, the primitive land would have been split in half. They were lucky it had left only a wound.
<br><br>
Now, the needle was heading towards the Source World at an even faster speed. Fortunately, it stopped in its tracks again, and whipped backwards, towards the Burial Land.
<br><br>
In the black hall, the Evil God buried his face in his hands and began to laugh hysterically.
<br><br>
His shrill laughter echoed in everyone's ears.
<br><br>
When faced with this undefeatable opponent, the Evil God had decided to unleash utter chaos, to even out the playing field.
<br><br>
While that was his plan, it was also a gamble.
<br><br>
Seeing the needle coming straight for him once more, the downgrader was consumed with fury.
<br><br>
If this was a game of luck, why wasn't luck on his side? Right now, if the needle hit the Burial Land, it would probably be completely destroyed.
<br><br>
"Withdraw!"
<br><br>
the downgrader said wisely. He had grown quick witted in the face of danger. He controlled the array plate to force the needle to retract.
<br><br>
Then, he watched as the needle shrank rapidly. Just as it was about to lash at the Burial Land, it shrank to a size that completely missed the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Now, it was shooting towards the opposite direction once more.
<br><br>
"It's time for you to die." The downgrader laughed maniacally.
<br><br>
The Source World was right in the needle's path.
<br><br>
The downgrader controlled the array plate to make the needle grow rapidly again.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The needle turned into an unimaginably huge metal whip that was lashing towards the Source World. The Source World at this point was like a fragile egg that was about to be smashed with a stone.
<br><br>
Chapter 4288 The Collision Of Worlds Being smashed, the Source World released a massive amount of fragments.
<br><br>
The largest of the fragments were several trillions of miles long and wide, while the smaller ones were thousands of miles long. They formed a spreading band of debris that floated up and down.
<br><br>
After the needle smashed the Source World, it rebounded in the opposite direction, then swung back. Eventually, the vacillations slowed, and the needle stopped moving, returning to its original form.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Yasamin, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the other natives of the Source World looked at their broken world with silent sorrow.
<br><br>
They had been born and raised in the Source World. It was their home. Its utter destruction was a heavy cross to bear, and they felt heartbroken at the loss.
<br><br>
At the moment, however, they had little time to nurse their grief.
<br><br>
Once the needle had returned to its original straight form, it began extending further and further. It was aimed now at the primitive land.
<br><br>
The Burial Land also sped up, keeping parallel with the primitive land.
<br><br>
As everyone watched, a few minutes later, the point of the needle came very close to the primitive land.
<br><br>
Just as it was about to pierce the land, a new set of In and Out Holes had been formed.
<br><br>
Because the primitive land had already left that chaotic space, Zen could easily release a new set of In and Out Holes.
<br><br>
The black hole sucked in the needle, and the white hole spat it out.
<br><br>
The needle was now heading towards the Burial Land, which was flying parallel to the primitive land.
<br><br>
As the needle drew closer, another set of In and Out Holes appeared.
<br><br>
Immediately the needle vanished into the black hole and was sent back over the primitive land.
<br><br>
This was the same situation as before—except this time, the Source World was gone, and the fierce battle between the three worlds had turned into a desperate contest between the remaining two.
<br><br>
The key point was that both sides were moving. This was important, because it prevented the space around them from collapsing due to the number of holes being created.
<br><br>
Ideally, with an infinite energy source, an infinite number of holes could be summoned, letting the needle bounce from one point to another for countless repetitions.
<br><br>
Strange sounds were released as the enormous needle moved in space.
<br><br>
It almost sounded like the splashing of waves and the howling of wind, at the same time.
<br><br>
As the huge needle zigzagged back and forth, it released the noise of a massive tide surging unhampered through space.
<br><br>
A corner of the Burial Land had been broken, so the sound was clearly transmitted to everyone inside.
<br><br>
In the face of the deadlock, the downgrader was patient. He mechanically released the holes to counterattack.
<br><br>
His companion was less sanguine. The Snake Spirit King couldn't help but ask, "How long will you be able to keep doing this? Will you just go on indefinitely?"
<br><br>
"Of course not," the downgrader replied calmly.
<br><br>
"Then what are you going to do?" said the Snake Spirit King anxiously.
<br><br>
The downgrader's tone remained cool and steady. "I need you to fight," he said.
<br><br>
"Me? How?" said the Snake Spirit King, sounding startled and confused.
<br><br>
If the two worlds collided, there was no question about his fighting abilities. The Snake Spirit King would not hesitate to lead the charge and rush into battle.
<br><br>
But as things stood right now, there was no other role for him to play but that of a passive onlooker.
<br><br>
"Take this," said the downgrader.
<br><br>
He pointed directly at the Snake Spirit King with his finger. A bright white ring had enveloped the king's head—the embryo of the white hole.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King looked down at the white ring, his eyes widening.
<br><br>
"What should I do?"
<br><br>
"Send it over," the downgrader replied.
<br><br>
"What do you mean? I have to send the hole over?" said the Snake Spirit King, looking stunned.
<br><br>
"Of course," the downgrader said coldly. His manner left absolutely no room for negotiation. The Snake Spirit King was not fully convinced by this plan, but he had no choice except to agree.
<br><br>
Within minutes, the Snake Spirit King's body became blurry. It was fusing into the environment. After the Snake Spirit King was completely concealed, the downgrader sent him into the chaos.
<br><br>
As the needle approached the Burial Land, the Snake Spirit King leapt up.
<br><br>
Moving with quiet precision, he landed on the silver needle and attached himself to it.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was relatively large compared to many other creatures, but compared to the gigantic needle he was tiny. Moreover, since the downgrader had helped him to hide himself, it was virtually impossible to see him with the naked eye.
<br><br>
With another strange, buzzing and sloshing sound, the needle once again changed its direction.
<br><br>
A new set of In and Out Holes had appeared, and the needle was now extending towards the primitive land.
<br><br>
Zen did not detect the presence of the Snake Spirit King. He simply released new holes, planning to keep sending the needle back towards the Burial Land.
<br><br>
In that instant, the shadow of a snake detached itself from the needle.
<br><br>
As the Snake Spirit King jumped, he released the white ring on his head.
<br><br>
In a split second the white ring had expanded into a massive white hole.
<br><br>
As Zen watched with astonishment, a corner of the Burial Land slid out from the white hole, crashing into the primitive land.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King, positioned in the center of the white hole, was carried into the primitive land.
<br><br>
With a heavy boom, the two worlds collided.
<br><br>
The primitive land started to shake. So did the Pear Hill and the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Zen, Kincaid, the Snake Goddess, and the others had not expected this turn of events.
<br><br>
Before their very eyes, the blood red sky had been torn apart, revealing a sharp corner of the Burial Land drilling in. Meanwhile, they saw the shadow of an enormous snake rolling in the air. It was none other than the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was slightly dazed, for he had also felt the brunt of the impact. Nevertheless, he was triumphant to find himself in the primitive land.
<br><br>
"I have come in!" he cried.
<br><br>
The downgrader did not respond. Azure space doors appeared on the corner of the Burial Land, and a group of black Troubled Creatures rushed out. There were so many of them that it was impossible to count. They surged out of the doors and swarmed in the sky like locusts. From a distance, they looked like an ominous, thick black mist.
<br><br>
There was a buzz as a figure suddenly appeared in front of the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
It was an incarnation of Zen.
<br><br>
"We meet again," roared Snake Spirit King. "Today I will have my revenge!"
<br><br>
However, even as he spoke, a powerful force locked onto his huge body.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen said coolly, "This is my territory. Here, you can't be considered my opponent."
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his fingers and made a gentle pinching motion.
<br><br>
Instantly, the Light of Annihilation covered the Snake Spirit King's body, while the force that locked him in place increased tenfold.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King, as a Treacherous Being, was abnormally strong.
<br><br>
But he was not even able to offer the slightest resistance to Zen's attack.
<br><br>
Inch by inch, he was crushed by the unyielding force, until he had dissipated completely.
<br><br>
In the past, the Snake Spirit King had the advantage in the Jade Pure Realm due to his reliance on the Limited Omnipotent Stone. It was different now. Zen was omniscient and omnipotent, and the Snake Spirit King no longer had even a small chance of defeating him.
<br><br>
However, the Troubled Creatures continued to howl and hiss as they poured out of the space doors.
<br><br>
The noise they made was overwhelming.
<br><br>
Zen watched them without any discernible change of expression.
<br><br>
By now, there were at least hundreds of thousands of Troubled Creatures swarming in the red sky.
<br><br>
The ones in the front had already noticed and targeted Zen. They let out their strange howling cries as they rushed towards him.
<br><br>
"You? You are too weak!"
<br><br>
Zen tilted his head slightly, and waved a hand in their direction.
<br><br>
He released a powerful surge of energy that transformed into invisible blades, which shot with deadly precision towards the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
In a second, the invisible blades sank into the flesh of the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
They did not even understand what was happening. One moment, the wind was blowing in their ears, and in the next, they had been chopped and sliced into pieces.
<br><br>
Black blood rained down as broken and dismembered limbs sailed through the air.
<br><br>
All the Troubled Creatures died instantly.
<br><br>
However, those space doors were still open, and more Troubled Creatures emerged. The attack showed no signs of slowing down.
<br><br>
Zen flicked his hand a few more times, until the air was thick with the stench of blood and death. However, as he slaughtered these Troubled Creatures without any difficulty, he felt doubt and suspicion forming in his mind.
<br><br>
These creatures were cannon fodder. It was meaningless to send them in for the purpose of defeating Zen. Why was the downgrader doing this? What was he planning? Chapter 4289 Illusion Zen slightly raised his right hand.
<br><br>
More invisible blades emerged and shot towards the space doors.
<br><br>
As they penetrated through the bodies of the Troubled Creatures, these blades hit the surface of the space doors.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Crack! The space doors were actually as fragile as a piece of glass in the face of Zen's invisible blades. He was able to effortlessly break them into pieces.
<br><br>
However, just as Zen shattered them, more space doors suddenly appeared around him.
<br><br>
With this, more Troubled Creatures continued to swarm and rush out.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but snort at the sight of all the new Troubled Creatures that surfaced, but he just continued to attack them and kill them off without breaking a sweat.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Burial Land could witness the merciless death of the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
Although it seemed that these Troubled Creatures were flooding the area, it only took Zen a few moments before he finished them off.
<br><br>
As the number of the space doors increased, Zen also released more and more blades. The rate at which he killed the Troubled Creatures was much faster than their appearance. That was why he was able to fully obliterate them along with the space doors.
<br><br>
However, after killing them off, Zen suddenly noticed that there was something wrong with the bodies that he had slain.
<br><br>
After Zen had successfully killed them off, their corpses didn't actually fall to the ground. Instead, they floated in the air as if they weren't affected by gravity. From afar, they looked like black insects in various shapes that hovered over a large area.
<br><br>
"Did you finally realize?" The Snake Spirit King's voice sounded in a contemptuous tone. "Too bad for you, it's too late!"
<br><br>
The black corpses began to move and merged with the other bodies until they formed a humongous hand that attempted to grab Zen.
<br><br>
"Is that it?" Zen said with an unimpressed tone.
<br><br>
He then narrowed his eyes and gathered his power. He summoned countless invisible blades that formed a storm around him, spinning from top to bottom.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the invisible blades were about to set out, they were suddenly destroyed.
<br><br>
"What the hell happened?"
<br><br>
Zen was taken aback and was confused at the sudden turn of events.
<br><br>
"Ha! Do you think that this is still your territory? This area has already been contaminated by the Troubled Creatures. This space is now under our control! Prepare to die!"
<br><br>
The enormous hand made up of the corpses of the Troubled Creatures completely grasped Zen's body and exerted a tremendous force.
<br><br>
Splat! In an instant, Zen's whole body was crushed into pieces.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! That's what you get for being too arrogant. You're only human.
<br><br>
How dare you—"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King suddenly stopped in the middle of his sentence, surprised at what he saw from afar.
<br><br>
Another avatar of Zen appeared outside the contaminated area. He stared at him with an indifferent expression and said, "The bodies of the Troubled Creatures are actually filled with the energy of the Pollution Extreme Form, which is a kind of energy to contaminate the space. I've never used it before, so I wanted to verify what it could do. What are you so happy about?"
<br><br>
The real Zen was still on the jadeite platform, while the Snake Spirit King was facing his avatar. He could actually summon as many avatars as he could if he wanted to.
<br><br>
"You arrogant bastard!"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King felt so humiliated with Zen's mockery that he was filled with rage.
<br><br>
He quickly controlled the black corpses and formed a huge hand again, aiming directly at Zen. However, Zen didn't even dodge, and the big hand crushed him again.
<br><br>
Immediately after, another avatar appeared.
<br><br>
This time, Zen raised his hand, and balls of light the size of marbles condensed behind him.
<br><br>
These balls of light were not created from his omnipotent power, but rather from the Purification Extreme Form, which could instantly purify the space that was contaminated by the Pollution Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The balls of light rained on the black corpses torrentially.
<br><br>
They drilled into them one after another.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the black color of the corpses quickly faded and turned into the color of the flesh.
<br><br>
These countless flesh-colored corpses floated in the air and gave off a terrifying aura. Soon enough, the contaminated space returned to its original state.
<br><br>
If Zen hadn't obtained the Heavenly Ring Staff, he wouldn't be able to do anything about the Pollution Extreme Form. As a result, he would have no way to prevent the downgrader from polluting and devouring his entire primitive land. But now, it didn't even take him much effort to restore it and launch a counterattack.
<br><br>
"This is our place. Although the Burial Land forcefully broke in, they still wouldn't be able to do anything with Zen." The Snake Goddess assessed that the situation they were in was much better than she imagined.
<br><br>
"But I still didn't have the chance to make a move." Geoffrey was sulking a bit because he had been itching to fight in this war. However, Zen had already blocked the Burial Land by only using a few of his avatars.
<br><br>
"Will you continue to hide behind the Snake Spirit King and these weak creatures? I didn't expect that you were such a spineless coward!" Zen continued to unleash his invisible blades to kill the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
From time to time, he would use the Purification Extreme Form when the black corpses had already accumulated to a certain extent.
<br><br>
"My master doesn't need to deal with you personally! You're not even worth his effort!" the Snake Spirit King sneered.
<br><br>
At the same time, several huge space doors appeared.
<br><br>
This time, the Snake Spirit King summoned Troubled Creatures that were more peculiar than the previous ones.
<br><br>
As the huge space doors opened, ginormous Troubled Creatures rushed out one after another. There were giant snakes with multiple heads, ghosts with long arms, spiders with several legs, and many others.
<br><br>
"Really? You think that these could make a difference?"
<br><br>
Zen glanced at all the creatures with a taunting expression on his face.
<br><br>
Except for their obviously larger bodies, these Troubled Creatures were no stronger than the previous ones.
<br><br>
Zen didn't even change his way of attacking. He just increased the number of invisible blades to slaughter these creatures.
<br><br>
In no time, they were all cut to pieces.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Spirit King didn't stop summoning these Troubled Creatures. More and more of them came in various forms and sizes, fearlessly rushing and sacrificing themselves.
<br><br>
Then, there were millions of them… Tens of millions… Hundreds of millions… However, all these waves of black corpses were just purified by Zen. The downgrader would never succeed in contaminating the primitive land by just using the Pollution Extreme Form.
<br><br>
At the same time, Hilario had been observing in silence as Zen continued to slaughter the Troubled Creatures. Although the Pollution Extreme Form was easily resolved by Zen, he still couldn't shake the feeling that there was something wrong going on.
<br><br>
He clearly knew that the downgrader was an extremely intelligent being.
<br><br>
There should be some meaning behind all these seemingly useless things that he was doing.
<br><br>
'Is he doing something while our attentions are focused on these creatures?' Then, Hilario suddenly raised his head and looked at the corner of the Burial Land that pierced into the primitive land. It was just a small part with respect to the entirety of the Burial Land, but it was still quite huge.
<br><br>
After all, the Burial Land was large enough to swallow two primitive lands.
<br><br>
'Swallow?' Hilario realized something. His eyes instantly widened. "Zen! Project the image outside the primitive land!"
<br><br>
The real Zen, who was standing on the jadeite platform, looked at Hilario with furrowed brows but still did what he was told. As he pointed to the air, the image of the outside was projected on the jadeite platform. From there, they could clearly see the corner of the Burial Land that drilled into the primitive land.
<br><br>
"Is there something wrong? What do we need to see here?" Kincaid asked as he was also a little confused with Hilario's sudden request.
<br><br>
After studying the projected image, Hilario continued, "Zen, can you try and push that corner out?"
<br><br>
"Huh? I'm afraid that's difficult to do," Zen said while shaking his head.
<br><br>
Doing so would actually be equivalent to lifting the entire Burial Land upwards.
<br><br>
With Zen's current strength, he could easily prevent the Burial Land from invading further into the primitive land, but it would be difficult to completely get rid of it. He actually preferred to fight the downgrader head-on, but the latter had never shown himself.
<br><br>
"Just try it!" Hilario insisted.
<br><br>
Although Zen didn't really understand why Hilario was strongly suggesting he do it, he still followed and did his best to push the corner.
<br><br>
With that, his avatar raised his hand.
<br><br>
In an instant, the power of the entire primitive land was directed to that corner.
<br><br>
Rumble! Rumble! With the avatar's full power, the corner was slowly raised to a height, but it was quickly pressed down hard again.
<br><br>
"I can't do it. It's too heavy," Zen said as he turned to Hilario.
<br><br>
Then, Hilario pointed at the image of the outside and said, "Even if it was just a little, you were able to lift the corner of the Burial Land, but the image didn't move one bit. It means that the image is fake! It's just an illusion created by the downgrader!"
<br><br>
Chapter 4290 Outside The Primitive Land The collision of the Burial Land into the primitive land created a huge shockwave. Even though only a corner of the former had made contact, there was a loud noise and it attracted everyone's attention.
<br><br>
At that very moment, Zen himself was busy killing the Troubled Creatures and purifying the energy of the Pollution Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Hearing Hilario's words, he realized that something was wrong and decided to find out what was going on.
<br><br>
The best way to do that was to utilize the Illusory Vision of the Soul Extreme Form! The consciousness created by the Illusory Vision quickly spread out in all directions and he began sensing everything that it touched.
<br><br>
Its radius was increasing at an extremely fast speed, and in a very short period of time, it would have been able to reach the end of the chaos.
<br><br>
However, before that could happen, the consciousness encountered an obstacle. As soon as it left the primitive land, it was completely absorbed by a mysterious force and vanished without a trace.
<br><br>
"How is that even possible?" Zen almost shouted in shock.
<br><br>
The consciousness had spread out in all possible directions. Even if it hit a barrier in one direction which captured and erased it, what about the consciousness in other directions? The primitive land was enormous in size now, which meant there was only one way that this could have happened. The primitive land needed to be wrapped up in something larger than itself for that consciousness to be completely absorbed.
<br><br>
Wrapped up...
<br><br>
Zen's heart began thumping at the thought.
<br><br>
He looked up at the blood red sky overhead and suddenly realized something, which darkened his face.
<br><br>
"Father, what's wrong?" Geoffrey instantly noticed Zen's grim expression.
<br><br>
Not only him, but the others did so as well.
<br><br>
Zen didn't answer the question, though. He narrowed his eyes and created an avatar that appeared at the edge of the primitive land.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
The avatar reached out and placed his palm on the inner wall of the primitive land.
<br><br>
This wall of the primitive land was extremely thick and generally considered impenetrable. This was the consequence of absorbing countless heads in the chaos. Even Eternal Realm warriors would not be able to break through it into the chaos. But this wasn't going to hinder Zen.
<br><br>
"Go!"
<br><br>
Zen's avatar spat out.
<br><br>
Then, with a soft, fluid movement, the avatar went straight through the wall, quickly passed through it, and was outside.
<br><br>
Logically speaking, the avatar should have been gazing into the empty chaos now.
<br><br>
But instead, he saw large, black mountains standing in the distance. And somehow, these mountains were upside down, with their peaks touching the ground instead of towering above.
<br><br>
"Waah... Waah..."
<br><br>
"Goo..."
<br><br>
"Coo!"
<br><br>
There were hundreds of Troubled Creatures on the black mountains.
<br><br>
When they discovered the avatar, they immediately sensed that this was an extraordinary prey. They spread their wings and charged towards him.
<br><br>
But even before the Troubled Creature in the front could approach him, a snow-white light had already shot into its chest. After drawing an arc in the air, the light returned back to the avatar's hand. This was a light shuttle, made up of the energy of the Purification Extreme Form.
<br><br>
The black matter in the body of the Troubled Creature faded away. It fell on the surface of the primitive land and died instantly as a result.
<br><br>
Outside the primitive land, Zen's avatar couldn't use the omniscient power, which might be nothing but an annoyance at best. Dealing with these Troubled Creatures was still a piece of cake for him.
<br><br>
The trouble was, the Troubled Creatures didn't know about fear and even after one fell, they still swarmed towards Zen's avatar However, the light shuttle went on rushing forwards like the sickle of death. After it had drawn numerous irregular curves in the air, hundreds of bodies were lying on the ground around Zen's avatar.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang...
<br><br>
The corpses of the Troubled Creatures piled up beside him.
<br><br>
However, the reason Zen's avatar had left the primitive land was not to kill these Troubled Creatures. He wanted to investigate and find out what was going on. He also had a theory he needed to verify.
<br><br>
After killing over a thousand Troubled Creatures in the chaos, he was planning on leaving and going to a place from where he could observe more.
<br><br>
He stretched out a hand and clasped his thumb and index finger together.
<br><br>
Calmly, he folded the space between him and his targeted area and in the blink of an eye, he had moved several trillions of miles. Now, he was standing at the top of the primitive land.
<br><br>
Just as he had reached there and was beginning to look around, a voice came from behind him. "Good. Have one long look at this place... Your last look at it!"
<br><br>
This was the voice of the Snake Spirit King! Zen's avatar whirled around instantly, but there was nothing behind him.
<br><br>
Before he had a chance to put up his guard, a thin tail had quietly wrapped itself around his throat and lifted him up.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
"You're in my world now, and I rule this place!"
<br><br>
Zen's avatar was lifted up into the air by the tail, and saw the giant head of the Snake Spirit King in front of him.
<br><br>
Inside the primitive land, the Snake Spirit King did not stand a chance against Zen, which was why the fight hadn't been too long. But now, the tables had turned, and it was Zen who had barged into the Snake Spirit King's territory.
<br><br>
The snake tail changed direction as it seized Zen. Zen looked around and saw black mountains and Troubled Creatures everywhere. He was finally sure that he was inside the Burial Land now. His theory was right. The primitive land had been devoured by the Burial Land and no one had noticed! "Ha-ha..."
<br><br>
Zen's avatar sneered as the light shuttle in his hand quickly lengthened into a blazing white light sword. With a fierce slash, he cut off the slender snake tail that was choking him and turned around. In the blink of an eye, the light sword had been shot into the Snake Spirit King's mouth.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
The sword released countless slender white lines inside the body of the Snake Spirit King. These lines themselves were also white in color and they forcefully sliced Zen's opponent into countless pieces. The huge snake body collapsed like a mountain that had lost its foundation and broke into pieces, falling down like confetti.
<br><br>
The attack power of the Purification Extreme Form was not too strong, but Zen wasn't actually facing the Snake Spirit King. Rather, what was in front of him was also an avatar, which meant that it was easy to face him.
<br><br>
Buzz! A brand-new snake appeared behind Zen instantly. This time, the avatar was about the same size as Zen himself. When the snake appeared, it wrapped itself around Zen's body. Then it raised its head, gazed into Zen's eyes, and asked in a malicious tone, "Can I be your opponent now?"
<br><br>
"You? Not a chance!"
<br><br>
The energy of the Destruction Extreme Form suddenly burst out from Zen's body. It created six short, purple swords which circled around the snake's body and once again, Cornelius's avatar was slashed into countless pieces.
<br><br>
Possessing energies from the various Extreme Forms, Zen was still extremely powerful even though it was his avatar who was fighting and he was outside the primitive land.
<br><br>
As soon as this particular avatar was dismembered, a new avatar appeared like clockwork, once again wrapping itself around Zen's body. "It doesn't matter how many times you slice my avatar. This is a battle between two worlds. Once I devour your primitive land, then I'll see if you are as good as you think you are!"
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King laughed, and hundreds of black spirals appeared in the inner space of the Burial Land. One of them landed on the surface of the primitive land and began spinning like a crazy top.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
The surface of the primitive land was remarkably sturdy, but when compared to the black spiral, it was as fragile as glass. It cracked rapidly, and every single thing, from the smallest grain of sand to the broadest of the mountains began falling off! The black spiral was only the size of a person, and the amount of matter it peeled off from the surface of the primitive land was pitifully small. In fact, what it did was almost negligible compared to the huge primitive land.
<br><br>
However, there were trillions of these black spirals and each of them was spinning in various places.
<br><br>
They had landed on the primitive land like locusts. Looking from afar, it was as if the surface of the primitive land had been covered with a layer of black gauze! The elements that formed the surface of the primitive land were quickly peeled off, separated into confetti, and then absorbed! After swallowing the primitive land in one huge gulp, the Burial Land was planning on digesting it bit by bit! Chapter 4291 The Final Announcement The downgrader was very aggressive. From the moment he had released the needle, he had already planned every step ahead.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, followed a relatively conservative approach. He only fought back at whatever came at him.
<br><br>
However, the downgrader was able to control the needle, thus he kept the initiative. Besides, he had gained a wealth of experience. He had been in the Deep Space for a long time, so he was much more proficient in the use of all kinds of Extreme Form energies.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha ha-ha... I won't kill you. I'll let you watch as I devour your primitive land..."
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King teased with a smug smile.
<br><br>
He had a keen awareness of emotions and could sense Zen's despair.
<br><br>
Zen stopped his counterattacking. It was an exercise in futility to keep killing the Snake Spirit King's avatars in the Burial Land. He could only observe this scene silently.
<br><br>
The size of each black spiral was comparatively quite small, and the speed of them devouring the primitive land was also limited. However, there were simply too many of them. If this continued, the primitive land wouldn't be able to last for too long...
<br><br>
On the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Everyone swept their eyes over anxiously. They sometimes studied Zen's real body, while also looking at the fake projection, trying to figure out what had happened.
<br><br>
Not long after, Zen's real body finally moved. He gently flicked his finger, and the fake illusion that had been projected onto the jadeite platform disappeared.
<br><br>
"Zen, what's going on?" Kincaid was the first to question the events.
<br><br>
After a moment of silence, Zen explained, "We're already inside the Burial Land. The Snake Spirit King is maneuvering the Burial Land to devour the outer wall of the primitive land..."
<br><br>
Although everyone present had been mentally prepared, their faces still darkened after Zen confirmed their suspicions.
<br><br>
"Then what can we do?" Yasamin asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
This was a situation unlike any they had ever experienced. Even the Snake Goddess, who was extremely intelligent, was at a loss.
<br><br>
Kincaid questioned, "Hilario, if one world is wrapped up in another world, how will the rules be changed?"
<br><br>
Although the Bold Conjecture House had performed all sorts of strange experiments, the question Kincaid raised was an unpopular topic that few people would be interested in studying. If one primitive land wrapped up another primitive land, who would then be the real controller? Hilario was also stumped by the question. "I haven't conducted any relevant research. I wonder if the other members of the Bold Conjecture House might have some experience. Wait for me. I'll go to the Other Shore..."
<br><br>
With those words, Hilario returned to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After half a minute, a Descending Ring flashed with a golden light.
<br><br>
However, the one who descended was not Hilario, but a thin human spirit.
<br><br>
"Greetings, Master Kincaid! I'm Barth from the Bold Conjecture House."
<br><br>
The human spirit named Barth saluted.
<br><br>
Kincaid waved away formalities with his hand. "You don't have to be so courteous. Can you answer my question?"
<br><br>
Barth nodded. "I'm in charge of the research into the secondary worlds.
<br><br>
I'm an expert in this field, so Master Hilario asked me to descend here.
<br><br>
Back then..."
<br><br>
"Get straight to the point!" Kincaid rushed to cut him off from rambling.
<br><br>
Given the critical situation, Barth was wasting time with nonsense, which left everyone speechless.
<br><br>
"I once created several primitive lands at the same time, observing as they merged and devoured each other. One of these test cases was similar to what you have encountered—a large primitive land devoured a small primitive land..." Barth continued to unhurriedly explain.
<br><br>
Kincaid, the Snake Goddess, and the others shared helpless looks on their faces, but they could only let him continue explaining in his meandering way.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, wore a look of concern. "What will happen to me as the controller of the smaller primitive land once it is devoured?"
<br><br>
"You will not be affected," said Barth with a smile. "Your controlling force and the Snake Spirit King's will become integrated. What's interesting is that as a controller, you can even assert control over the Burial Land in turn. To put it bluntly, you and the Snake Spirit King will fight for control over the whole Burial Land. The winner will take all."
<br><br>
Hearing this, the Snake Goddess couldn't help but blurt out, "It wouldn't be advantageous for them, right?"
<br><br>
Barth responded with a smile, "Yes, it's a great disadvantage to them. It's simply stupid to do so. The Snake Spirit King and the downgrader must have never done experiments of this nature. They mistakenly believe that they can control everything by devouring the primitive land, but in fact, the opposite is true..."
<br><br>
Although this thin man was verbose and rambling on, everyone became more patient to hear what he had to say.
<br><br>
The situation remained critical, but there was now a chance to fight back.
<br><br>
It was unclear who would win in the end, anyway.
<br><br>
However, the primitive land was probably no longer a safe haven, and an unprecedented and fierce war was looming.
<br><br>
The people on the jadeite platform had already been mentally prepared, but this war involved countless innocent people: the people in the large cities on the Pear Hill, the people in the Ruin Graveyard, the people in the divine land, and even the people in various universes who knew nothing about the outside world.
<br><br>
"I want them to know the truth, so even if they die, they will know the reason..." said Zen.
<br><br>
"What do you plan on doing?" asked Fuxi.
<br><br>
"Announce it to everyone."
<br><br>
As he spoke, Zen tapped his tiptoe on the jadeite platform and launched himself into the air.
<br><br>
"I'm Zen, the controller of this primitive land. Whether you hail from the Pear Hill, the Ruin Graveyard, the divine land, or the universes, you're all under my protection..."
<br><br>
While his voice did not have significant penetrating force, Zen had immediately activated the omniscient power, causing his voice to ring in everyone's ears. It was as if hundreds of trillions of Zens were whispering an explanation to countless people.
<br><br>
"At this moment, the primitive land has encountered a great crisis. A larger world has descended, and the primitive land will fall into turmoil.
<br><br>
Everyone living within will have no way to escape… But I will do my best to protect you all..."
<br><br>
In the divine land, on the edge of the Time Sea.
<br><br>
A girl with sad eyes looked up at the sky. She was Yolande.
<br><br>
She had asked Mike to take back a Heavenly Destiny. Although her cultivation level had returned to that of a world lord for a while, she broke through the shackles and became a True God, finally entering the divine land.
<br><br>
When Zen's voice rang out, she felt as if she was in the Evolutionary Universe once more. At that time, Zen's voice had often echoed across the universe.
<br><br>
In the Evolutionary Universe, the Supreme Lord of Original Sin, the Supreme Lord of Oracle, and the other Supreme Lords even thought that Zen had returned.
<br><br>
They had been trying to communicate with Zen through the Roaring Tokens.
<br><br>
In the fairy palace...
<br><br>
Inside the Pear Hill...
<br><br>
Humans, nonhumans, and intelligent creatures all experienced different thoughts when they heard Zen's words.
<br><br>
Many didn't believe what they heard, while some didn't care, others were sad, and many were crying...
<br><br>
Whether they were willing or not, they were about to face an inevitable catastrophe.
<br><br>
Once Zen returned to the jadeite platform, he began to communicate with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
After the Heavenly Ring Staff was taken back by Geoffrey, the ancestrylevel bloodline took away the spirit in the staff, which was the crystal. The ancestry-level bloodline was trying to find its own memories in it.
<br><br>
However, the process was not going smoothly. This crystal was in a completely sealed state. The ancestry-level bloodline feared damaging the crystal, so it did not dare to use too much power on the crystal.
<br><br>
"The outer wall of the primitive land will be broken. No matter what happens, you must return to my body first," said Zen.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline accepted Zen's instructions without hesitation.
<br><br>
The huge blood red sky began to shrink, converging into an extremely thin blood pillar, and then it entered into Zen's body, taking with the crystal that belonged to the Heavenly Ring Staff.
<br><br>
Chapter 4292 Merging Into One After the ancestry-level bloodline went back to Zen's body, only one hundred and forty rings which were the energies of the one hundred and forty Extreme Form energies floating in the sky.
<br><br>
It was a little complicated to control the Extreme Form energies, so Zen created one hundred and forty avatars—each of which was responsible for one kind of energy. When he needed to use any of the energies, he would activate one of his avatars to control it.
<br><br>
However, the primitive land was about to be captured, so he had to prevent the Extreme Form energies and the avatars from being destroyed.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, Zen gently raised his hand, and a mysterious power of space circulated his fingertip. After the avatar in charge of the Hyperspace Extreme Form opened his eyes, a space began to envelop all of the energies and the avatars.
<br><br>
"Shrink!" Zen commanded.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The space began to shrink. The one hundred and forty kinds of energies as well as the avatars also shrank with it, until finally, they all landed on Zen's palm.
<br><br>
He looked at the space on his palm and heaved a sad sigh.
<br><br>
After he put the space away, Zen's gaze swept across everyone present.
<br><br>
Everyone there all had mixed feelings.
<br><br>
They thought back to the start of the war in the Source World to their successful escape. The steps they had to take to reach this moment were not easy at all.
<br><br>
The end of the chaos was not worth mentioning now. What they had to focus on now was facing the Snake Spirit King and the downgrader.
<br><br>
Fuxi said with a wide smile, "Even if we lose, it will all be worth it. There were so many civilizations before us, but none of them were able to experience what we experienced!"
<br><br>
"I had never thought of fighting against such powerful enemies before. If I had known about the force we were about to face today a lot earlier, I'm afraid I would have given up on day one," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said expressionlessly.
<br><br>
"It's not just you. I didn't think I'd ever reach this point, either," Hilario replied, shaking his head.
<br><br>
While they seemed to be full of fighting spirit, in their hearts, the feeling of despair quietly began to grow.
<br><br>
It was like they had worked so hard to hike up a mountain, only to reach its peak and realize there was still a dangerous ladder they had to climb. It was difficult for them not to feel despair, especially when their previous efforts seemed to be for nothing.
<br><br>
Kincaid, however, was having none of it. "Wait, why do you guys think that we're going to be the ones who will lose?" He spoke up. "Let's not forget—whatever the downgrader has, we have it too. If that's the case, why are you guys so sure he's going to win?" he continued.
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid's right! Also, Zen controls the Extreme Form energies.
<br><br>
As the controllers of the primitive lands, they are equally matched in strength. More importantly, we have something that they don't have," the Snake Goddess exclaimed.
<br><br>
Zen asked in astonishment, "What do you mean?"
<br><br>
"Listen to me first."
<br><br>
Ignoring Zen's and everyone else's puzzled expressions, the Snake Goddess continued, "The human spirit called Barth said that when a big primitive land devours a small primitive land, the former wouldn't have any advantages. The controllers of the two primitive lands have the same authority, right?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen confirmed.
<br><br>
"The Snake Spirit King and the downgrader definitely don't know about this. If they did, they wouldn't have chosen to devour your primitive land," the Snake Goddess continued to explain.
<br><br>
Zen thought about it for a while before nodding his head in agreement.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess' analysis made perfect sense.
<br><br>
"When the two worlds merge into one world, your omniscient and omnipotent power will meet no obstruction in the Burial Land. You can find out the Snake Spirit King in an instant and kill him!" the Snake Goddess exclaimed.
<br><br>
As Fuxi, Kincaid, and the others heard the Snake Goddess' suggestion, their eyes lit up with hope. But it was quickly turned down by Hilario, who said, "Cornelius is in the form of a Treacherous Being. It will not be easy to kill him."
<br><br>
As Hilario said, the reason why Treacherous Beings were so terrifying to face in combat was that it was extremely difficult to kill them. Even if one used the Light of Annihilation to kill the Treacherous Beings, the latter would still be able to revive themselves through their coordinates.
<br><br>
If Zen used the Flame Extreme Form, he didn't need to use the Light of Annihilation. He could directly burn the Snake Spirit King to death. He had already done it once on the Other Shore, but the question was this— how could he remove the Snake Spirit King's coordinates? "It shouldn't be difficult to find his coordinates with your omniscient power," the Snake Goddess said, her brain still swiftly racing.
<br><br>
"Yes. If his coordinates are in the Burial Land, there might be a good chance I can kill him," Zen said, growing more hopeful.
<br><br>
"But what if his coordinates aren't in the Burial Land but on the Other Shore?" Hilario asked again.
<br><br>
Now, everyone fell into silence.
<br><br>
It wouldn't be easy to find the Snake Spirit King's coordinates if they were on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..."
<br><br>
Kincaid laughed suddenly, breaking the silence. "Cornelius is a very cautious person. I'm afraid he wouldn't want to be separated from his coordinates. There's a high chance of him bringing his coordinates to the Burial Land, but still, we can't be a hundred percent sure we'll win this war. All we can do is try!"
<br><br>
"Forget the hundred percent chance of winning! Even if the chance is slim, we still have to go on to fight!" Zen said, punching his fist into the air.
<br><br>
Outside the primitive land, Zen's avatar was still tightly held by the Snake Spirit King. He looked down.
<br><br>
When the black spirals eroded the primitive land, they might have absorbed a portion of the matter that fell off from the primitive land.
<br><br>
These black spirals grew stronger and stronger each minute. As a result, the speed at which they eroded the outer wall of the primitive land grew quicker and quicker.
<br><br>
It was as if they were peeling off a fruit, grinding the primitive land's outer wall bit by bit.
<br><br>
This might take a longer time, but it was the safest plan in the eyes of the Snake Spirit King and the downgrader.
<br><br>
On a peak of the Burial Land stood the Snake Spirit King's real body, and on his head stood the downgrader.
<br><br>
"We're at an absolute advantage with this strategy. The Source World has been smashed into pieces. Congratulations! You've won the battle earlier than we expected," the Snake Spirit King said, praising the downgrader.
<br><br>
However, the downgrader's six pairs of light blue, compound eyes were not celebrating. Instead, his eyes looked bored. "Well, it is a little boring..." he said, trailing off.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" the Snake Spirit King asked in surprise.
<br><br>
"I've fought against Clarence countless times, and every battle with him was fierce. I did my best whenever I was battling him, but I always failed to take him down. Now that I fight with these weak existences, there is no challenge in it for me. I can't help but find this all boring..." the downgrader said, shaking his head in disappointment.
<br><br>
"Clarence... Who is he?" the Snake Spirit King asked cautiously.
<br><br>
The downgrader scoffed. "You are not qualified to know," he said coldly.
<br><br>
Although the Snake Spirit King cursed in his heart, he didn't dare to say anything about it.
<br><br>
Four hours later...
<br><br>
One-fifth of the primitive land's outer wall had been eroded.
<br><br>
Six hours later...
<br><br>
Half of the primitive land's outer wall had been eroded.
<br><br>
Ten hours later...
<br><br>
The once thick wall of primitive land became thin. It had only about onetenth of its original thickness.
<br><br>
At this time, the Snake Spirit King released an aura smelling like blood, which spread to every corner of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
When the Troubled Creatures of the land smelled the blood, they followed it like they were hungry sharks. They flapped their wings and surrounded the huge primitive land.
<br><br>
They waited. When the outer wall of the primitive land was completely eroded, they would rush towards it.
<br><br>
"Desperate?" the Snake Spirit King's avatar asked.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..." Zen's avatar sneered, refusing to entertain him.
<br><br>
Looking at all the Troubled Creatures surrounding the primitive land, he couldn't help but think of what the Snake Goddess mentioned. The Snake Spirit King and the downgrader didn't know that when the boundary was broken, the two primitive lands would merge into one. They weren't aware of the consequence of what they were doing.
<br><br>
Another hour later, the outer wall of the primitive land cracked. Countless holes and crevices began to appear. The rest of the broken shell was completely eroded by the black spirals until finally, the two worlds merged.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
"We've succeeded!" They cheered.
<br><br>
At this moment, the Snake Spirit King felt a lot of information rush into his mind.
<br><br>
Before, the primitive land was like a locked, black box to him. He couldn't open it up or see through it. Now, it was as transparent as water. He looked at it intensely as his mind absorbed endless details. His omniscient ability finally extended to Zen's primitive land.
<br><br>
However, what the Snake Spirit King didn't know was that Zen felt the same way about the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Chapter 4293 Assault The entirety of the Burial Land now came into Zen's view.
<br><br>
From the specific number of the Troubled Creatures, to the huge jars that were used to nurture Troubled Creatures at the bottom of the black mountain... Zen could see it all.
<br><br>
He could even sense the horde of Troubled Creatures swarming over to the primitive land, their minds filled with craziness, restlessness, and strong killing intent.
<br><br>
However, Zen had no interest in them. Instead, he focused on finding the location of the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.
<br><br>
Buzz! In the blink of an eye, the figures of the Snake Spirit King and the downgrader appeared in his mind's eye.
<br><br>
While the two of them both had an acute sense of perception, they didn't notice Zen's watchful eye. If it were anyone else, they'd have found out immediately, but Zen's state of omniscience was different. As opposed to spying, this omniscience let him know everything about anything in a single thought.
<br><br>
"The downgrader, and the Snake Spirit King. I've found them now..." Zen said to the others.
<br><br>
However, this still wasn't what he was looking for.
<br><br>
"The Snake Spirit King's coordinates..."
<br><br>
In his state of omniscience, nothing in the Burial Land could remain secret to him. As long as Zen thought about it, he would instantly get the answer.
<br><br>
His mind was quickly directed to the bottom of a mountain. There, he saw the Snake Spirit King's coordinates, which were encased in an orb of black light. Additionally, a golden ring surrounded the black orb.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Zen shot a quick glance to the others and gave them a comforting nod before abruptly teleporting to the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.
<br><br>
However, he did leave a replica of himself before he left.
<br><br>
Shortly after, the Snake Spirit King set foot on the Pear Hill. His huge body slowly coiled up onto the peak. All the while, he hissed proudly. He didn't even bother to hide his complacency in his golden eyes as he revealed himself before everyone.
<br><br>
"Panic, fear, and uneasiness," he exclaimed elatedly. "I feed off of your negative emotions!"
<br><br>
What he said was true. The eyes of the Snake Goddess, Kincaid, Hilario, and everyone else were filled with anxiety. However, their uneasiness actually stemmed from fear that Zen's movements would be found out.
<br><br>
Whatever the case was, their panicked expressions worked like a charm to delude the proud Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King was so carried away that he couldn't be bothered to check if the Zen before him was just a replica, nor did he even use his omniscient power to read their minds. He believed that everything was well under his control. Kincaid, Zen, Hilario, and Itzel... None of them would be able to change anything. There was no longer any chance for these weaklings to turn the tide, he firmly believed.
<br><br>
"My foolish daughter! Did things go as you wished?" the Snake Spirit King sneered, directing his forked tongue at Itzel.
<br><br>
Standing at the corner of the jadeite platform, Itzel stared coldly at her father, disgust written all over her face. "Might I remind you, father," she snapped back, "Your wishes haven't been fulfilled, either. How pathetic!"
<br><br>
"How dare you!"
<br><br>
The fact that he failed to upgrade the world was a terrible blow to the Snake Spirit King's ego. Although he had already tried to accept it as fact, he still felt furious and embarrassed when Itzel pointed it out. Unable to suppress his anger, he opened his huge mouth in an attempt to swallow her whole.
<br><br>
Kincaid, Hilario, and Rocher all immediately sprang into action, ready to strike back. However, before they could even get close, a strong, burly figure had already stepped forward.
<br><br>
Before the Snake Spirit King could react, Geoffrey had closed in on him in a heartbeat and swung his large fist at the Snake Spirit King's body.
<br><br>
Pop! A light muffled sound rang out, as though Geoffrey had hit a piece of cotton. However, the power that erupted from his blow was extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
The huge body of the Snake Spirit King caved in upon impact, and the power even penetrated through his body. An energy wave strong enough to distort the space within tens of thousands of miles rippled out, influencing even the Troubled Creatures that had just set foot onto the primitive land. Despite them being so far away, these creatures were still blown away, losing their balance.
<br><br>
Clatter! After the punch was landed, the Snake Spirit King's body instantly disintegrated into ashes.
<br><br>
Everyone who had witnessed this scene was stunned into silence.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey had returned from his long journey, he was known to have undergone a drastic change. Once when he had sparred with Rocher, his power had surprised everyone. However, he now displayed even greater power that was far beyond everyone's imagination.
<br><br>
"Let me protect you all!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey said with a smile as he waved his huge fist.
<br><br>
After returning to the chaos, he hadn't yet used his strength to its full potential. His body was, after all, the strongest physical body in the Deep Space, and its power was so great that even he himself was startled. This great power boosted his confidence; he was a different person now.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Moments later, a new Snake Spirit King appeared before them.
<br><br>
He hissed in frustration, shooting an annoyed glance at Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"I must admit, what a strong force! You really surprised me." Narrowing his eyes at Geoffrey, he continued, "But that doesn't matter, it won't make a difference. Do you really think you can defeat me?" He sneered disdainfully.
<br><br>
Bang! As soon as he finished speaking, Geoffrey materialized in front of him once more and punched him right on his forehead.
<br><br>
His body was powerful enough to transcend the restraints of space. To a certain extent, his movements were beyond the Snake Spirit King's prediction, regardless of his omniscience.
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King's body was once again blown to smithereens.
<br><br>
However, what Geoffrey killed was only another avatar. As long as the Snake Spirit King wanted, he could create thousands of such avatars.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Once the avatar was killed, the Snake Spirit King summoned a new one to take its place, which was then killed by Geoffrey again.
<br><br>
It became an endless cycle of summoning and killing. This scene soon became too much for the others to take in.
<br><br>
As they watched in awe, Kincaid and the rest did not try to interfere.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's intentions were clear: he wanted to distract the Snake Spirit King with his incredible strength so that Zen would have enough time to complete his mission.
<br><br>
Speaking of Zen, as Geoffrey continued to kill the Snake Spirit King's avatars, he had quietly appeared at the foot of a mountain, which was only several feet away from the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.
<br><br>
Zen frowned. He had planned to appear right in front of the coordinates.
<br><br>
With his omnipotence, it should have been easy for him to achieve that.
<br><br>
However, there was something special about the golden ring, which blocked him from doing so.
<br><br>
Although his teleportation had been disturbed by the golden ring, this distance was close enough for him. Shrugging it off, he decided to proceed immediately.
<br><br>
If the Snake Spirit King noticed something was amiss and tried to find out where Zen was, his current location would immediately be exposed to his enemies. In fact, the Snake Spirit King only needed to check what the people on the jadeite platform were thinking to know what their plan was! "Destruction Extreme Form!"
<br><br>
A circle of purple energy formed in front of Zen, from which a spear quickly materialized...
<br><br>
Grasping the spear firmly in his hand, he jabbed forward towards his target.
<br><br>
Bang! The long spear stabbed into the surface of the golden ring and made a harsh, crisp sound. The golden ring trembled, and several cracks appeared on its edge.
<br><br>
"It's not destroyed? Oh no!"
<br><br>
Zen had expected he would penetrate through the golden ring and shatter the coordinates in one blow. Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined this ordinary-looking golden ring would withstand the Destruction Extreme Form energy! However, he quickly gathered his bearings. Withdrawing the long spear, he quickly landed another blow. Simultaneously, he summoned two replicas beside him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, from the top of the mountain, the Snake Spirit King and the downgrader had all their attention focused on Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's strong body was definitely something beyond their expectations, and consequently they had been caught off guard. It seemed Geoffrey's plan was working, as they had failed to shift their attention away from him.
<br><br>
"This young man's body is incredibly strong. Moreover, I can feel that his soul is equally strong. If I wasn't connected to the Burial Land, I would be no match for him. Why is there such a powerful warrior in the primitive land? Is this a result of the Extreme Form energy?" the Snake Spirit King inquired.
<br><br>
The downgrader shook his head. "He was the one who brought back the Heavenly Ring Staff. He must have obtained a great fortune in the Deep Space. Both his physical body and soul are the strongest in the Deep Space. It's normal that you are not a match for him."
<br><br>
"It's a pity such strength will go to waste," the Snake Spirit King said complacently, a smile creeping on his face.
<br><br>
"Don't slacken your vigilance. They've grasped the Extreme Form energies. It's not worth mentioning to me, but..." Before the downgrader could finish his sentence, his six pairs of eyes suddenly flashed with a red light, and uneasiness emanated from him.
<br><br>
Chapter 4294 Indestructible The downgrader's eyes suddenly widened in realization. He discovered that the golden ring was under attack, and it already got damaged! The golden ring, also known as the Narrow Steel Ring in the Deep Space, was an immensely powerful defensive treasure invented by a genius of the Cinnabar race. Even the downgrader was amazed when he first saw it. He was awed by the inventor's wisdom and the fact that he managed to create such a powerful treasure with the Extreme Form energy.
<br><br>
After the downgrader had obtained the irregular heavy sword, he used the Extreme Form energy to build the Narrow Steel Ring. However, it was a pity that he was not in the Deep Space right now. That was because the creation of Narrow Steel Rings required some specific techniques and materials from the Deep Space. Therefore, the downgrader could only make a simplified version.
<br><br>
Yet, although he had only made a simplified Narrow Steel Ring, it still had a spectacular defensive ability. It should've been impossible to damage it with just a single blow! "What's wrong?" the Snake Spirit King asked curiously. He could not understand why the downgrader felt worried when everything was well under their control.
<br><br>
"Someone is trying to destroy your coordinates and my Source Light..."
<br><br>
the downgrader answered.
<br><br>
"What? But how could that happen?"
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King said in disbelief while he subconsciously began to think about the possible answers. As he did so, his omniscient abilities immediately conveyed all the relevant information to him.
<br><br>
It included the inner thoughts of the people on the jadeite platform, the reason why Geoffrey continued to attack his avatars in vain, as well as Zen's current location.
<br><br>
As the information flashed in his mind, he saw Zen, who thrust a purple spear towards the golden ring. After he did that, numerous cracks appeared on the ring's surface.
<br><br>
Bang! With a crisp sound, the cracks immediately spread to the entire body of the Narrow Steel Ring. If Zen thrust the spear once more, the Narrow Steel Ring would undoubtedly break into pieces! "Stop!"
<br><br>
the Snake Spirit King yelled, his face blanched in fright. He quickly attempted to teleport himself beside Zen to block the spear.
<br><br>
The downgrader's reflexes were much faster than the Snake Spirit King's.
<br><br>
However, he needed a longer time to use the Grand Teleportation technique, since the Burial Land had been handed over to the Snake Spirit King. As a result, they did things almost simultaneously.
<br><br>
Just as both of them were about to teleport away at the same time, two avatars of Zen suddenly appeared behind them.
<br><br>
"Exile!"
<br><br>
In a split second, two cubic spaces enveloped the downgrader and the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
They felt their heads spin for a moment, then they got sent out of the Burial Land at the same time and found themselves floating somewhere else in the chaos.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
In turn, the downgrader's six pairs of compound eyes instantly turned bright red. He quickly understood the situation and spiraled into a flurry of emotions.
<br><br>
"It's Zen... He could control the Burial Land?!"
<br><br>
It was not until the Snake Spirit King got kicked out of the Burial Land that he realized what happened.
<br><br>
"Stop him, my avatar!"
<br><br>
Since they got sent quite far away, it was not easy for the Snake Spirit King to go back. Thus, he immediately created an avatar beside Zen.
<br><br>
But before his avatar could stop Zen, the purple spear which was formed from the Destruction Extreme Form energy had already stabbed the Narrow Steel Ring.
<br><br>
Bang! Covered in cracks, the Narrow Steel Ring finally broke apart at that one thrust.
<br><br>
As a defensive treasure, it was already impressive enough to have withstood three blows of the Destruction Extreme Form energy before it finally shattered.
<br><br>
However, the long spear did not stop even after it broke the Narrow Steel Ring. Next, it pierced through the black orb of light and punctured the coordinates.
<br><br>
Crack! The moment the coordinates, which were two golden crosses, came into contact with the Destruction Extreme Form energy, they instantly turned into a heap of fine golden powder.
<br><br>
The poor Snake Spirit King had sensed everything through his connection to the Burial Land. He even knew how many pieces his coordinates had broken into, but he could not stop it from happening. He could only watch helplessly in a daze. If he could not do anything, then what use were his omniscient abilities? "Help, help me..." On the brink of death, the Snake Spirit King desperately asked the downgrader for help.
<br><br>
"You died of stupidity," the downgrader only remarked mockingly.
<br><br>
"I... I..."
<br><br>
The Snake Spirit King failed to finish his sentence, as his body slowly became snow-white in color, then a translucent shade. Eventually, he completely disappeared from the downgrader's vision.
<br><br>
The chief culprit behind the destruction of the main world and the one who had brought the Four Spirits Sect to its end finally died in this way.
<br><br>
After he died, his avatars could no longer move, as if they had lost their souls.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen stretched out his hand and stabbed the avatar's body with the purple spear, which blasted it into pieces. His lips curved into a relieved smile.
<br><br>
On the jadeite platform, the Snake Spirit King's avatars originally kept forming in succession before Geoffrey quickly killed them. Just as Geoffrey began to worry that his physical strength could not hold on for longer, the avatars suddenly stopped appearing.
<br><br>
Did Zen succeed? Or did the Snake Spirit King just give up wasting his time fighting with Geoffrey? A moment of silence later, everyone turned to look at Zen's avatar. They knew this avatar was connected to Zen's consciousness.
<br><br>
"Zen! How's it going now?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
Everyone on the jadeite platform went silent and eagerly waited for Zen's avatar to answer.
<br><br>
The avatar paused for a few seconds before the corners of his mouth curved up into a smile. "I have removed the Snake Spirit King's coordinates," he said.
<br><br>
Kincaid, Hilario, the Snake Goddess, Geoffrey, Rocher, and the human heroes' energy souls all felt stunned for a moment — then they jumped in joy.
<br><br>
"He really made it!"
<br><br>
"It was easier than I expected!"
<br><br>
"As the saying goes, 'the smarter one will win in an inevitable confrontation.' Because they were both world rulers, this fight quickly yielded results!"
<br><br>
The crux of the battle between the world rulers lay on seizing the advantage of time. It was especially important for Zen to have obtained the most crucial information from Barth, and the Snake Goddess' suggestion was no less significant.
<br><br>
As the others celebrated, Itzel looked relaxed. Her father, who had remained one of her worst nightmares, was finally gone. Her curse that had lasted for over a thousand chaotic eras came to an end at last.
<br><br>
While everyone basked in their excitement, Zen added, "Although his coordinates have gotten destroyed, the orb of black light still exists. I can't eliminate it..."
<br><br>
Everyone on the jadeite platform felt very optimistic already, but their happiness did not last long when Zen pointed out the graver issue. Then, they became serious once again.
<br><br>
They had not forgotten the fact that the downgrader remained their biggest threat.
<br><br>
At the bottom of the mountain, different rings flashed in Zen's palms one after another.
<br><br>
He tried every kind of Extreme Form energy in succession, but none of them worked to affect the black light.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A white ring released a blazing beam of light, which melted the entire mountain right away. However, the black light was still undamaged.
<br><br>
"Zen, why don't you try to exclude that entire area from the land?" the Snake Goddess advised his avatar, who was on the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen's eyes lit up as a blue ring materialized in front of him.
<br><br>
"Hyperspace Extreme Form!"
<br><br>
Buzz! A space of ten miles in length, width, and height appeared in a particular area. This space was completely isolated from the primitive land.
<br><br>
"Exile!"
<br><br>
Zen tried to exile everything in this specific space, including the black light.
<br><br>
Theoretically, this entire space should have gotten exiled into somewhere else in the chaos. However, the black light still floated in its original position and did not even move an inch at all.
<br><br>
A headache began to brew in Zen's head. This thing was a tougher challenge than he had imagined! "Ancestry-level bloodline... Do you have any idea?" he asked helplessly.
<br><br>
Although the ancestry-level bloodline had been busy dealing with the crystal, it had also paid attention to Zen's movements. Of course, it had also noticed the black light earlier.
<br><br>
"When we were in the Jade Pure Realm, I noticed something familiar in this orb of black light," said the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"What's it?" Zen asked hurriedly.
<br><br>
"I can't tell. My relevant memories were lost. Perhaps we can find the answer in the crystal," the ancestry-level bloodline answered.
<br><br>
"Alright..."
<br><br>
While Zen communicated with the ancestry-level bloodline, his eyes remained transfixed on the black light. As he looked closely at it, he began to feel a strange sensation. He felt as if someone was staring back at him in the black light.
<br><br>
The second he was about to speak, he heard the downgrader's laughter from within the black light.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! Have you found me? You have sharper eyes than I thought!"
<br><br>
Chapter 4295 Tools As the downgrader floated in the chaos, his six pairs of compound eyes shone a bright, flashing orange. He sized up Zen.
<br><br>
When Zen noticed the downgrader, he was not threatened at all. If anything, he merely mocked him with a chuckle.
<br><br>
However, Zen's heart sank as he heard the downgrader's words. It seemed that he did not care about the death of the Snake Spirit King, which was not a good sign.
<br><br>
"It turns out that I can't control the primitive land by devouring it directly.
<br><br>
When a large primitive land devours a small one, this leaves the two controllers to have the same power. The Snake Spirit King is really a good-for-nothing bastard.
<br><br>
You must have known this secret and made plans accordingly," the downgrader nagged. "But because you were born in this chaos, you have limited knowledge. I can only assume that someone from the Bold Conjecture House told you this."
<br><br>
The downgrader always had a better understanding of nature than anyone else. With ease, he could quickly come up with the most accurate guesses and answers.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen intently stared into the black light as he felt a great pressure of energy from it.
<br><br>
When he was in the Jade Pure Realm, he hadn't known the downgrader well. However, he had enough confidence to put up a fight against the downgrader and almost win. Now that Kincaid had woken up and Geoffrey had returned with the Heavenly Ring Staff, he gradually realized that the downgrader was more complex than he seemed.
<br><br>
Even if he disposed of the Snake Spirit King, it seemed that everything was still in the palm of the downgrader.
<br><br>
"So what?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Your resistance is notable and surprises me, but the effort you make is in vain," the downgrader pointed out.
<br><br>
"In vain?" Zen's eyebrows ruffled as he pulled himself together. "Don't forget that I am now the owner of the Burial Land. I also have the Extreme Form energies of the Deep Space while you are all alone!"
<br><br>
It seemed that Zen had the upper hand and he shouldn't fear the downgrader any more.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
The downgrader roared with frightening cackles and shrieks. "Your present struggle reminds me so much of the Sacred Spirit race. They were born as indestructible stone tablets. Would you like to guess how they planned to defeat me?"
<br><br>
Zen looked at the ground, not saying a word.
<br><br>
The downgrader nodded and continued, "They united as one and grew together to form a huge stone cage that trapped me within. It's a pity you weren't able to witness it. It was truly an unprecedented big move. Though the power of the sixth-grade world is far weaker compared to that of the seventh-grade and eighth-grade worlds, they were persistent and determined all throughout, which resulted to a very cruel ending."
<br><br>
"What... What happened to them?" Zen couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>
"Oh, they turned from stone tablets to tombstones. Hahaha!" The downgrader let out a merciless laugh. "When I injured Clarence in the fifth-grade world, I won. That says a lot, because in this world, only Clarence can stop me. And you, you're just materials and tools. All brawn and no brain."
<br><br>
"We still have our own intelligence," Zen defended with his eyebrows raised.
<br><br>
"No, you don't." The downgrader looked down and shook his head. "Your intelligence is too low. Undeniably, it is impressive that you have reached this point, but like I said before, you are all tools. Without Clarence, you are nothing. You have no idea how funny it is to see you explore the chaos like chickens with their heads cut off,"
<br><br>
he said with a tone of revulsion, as if Zen's small, shallow understanding disgusted him.
<br><br>
"Without Clarence, we can also win. Otherwise, why did you attach yourself to the Snake Spirit King all these years?" Zen retorted. He was definitely not going to back down on such argument.
<br><br>
"Clarence lost his memory in the Deep Space while I lost my strength.
<br><br>
Since then, it became extremely difficult for me to downgrade the worlds." As he spoke, he stretched out his slender arms and the parts of the irregular heavy sword appeared one by one, slowly piecing themselves together. "Now that I've regained my strength, everything is different." He smiled, "Let me show you how to properly use this weapon."
<br><br>
Buzz! Just then, the cracks across the heavy sword began to flicker with a bright light.
<br><br>
Oddly enough, the light was not monochrome; it was colorful.
<br><br>
Within the sword, various Extreme Form energies quickly switched around.
<br><br>
Swoosh! At the same time, Zen felt a sudden change within the Burial Land.
<br><br>
"Troubled Creatures!"
<br><br>
Before, when the Snake Spirit King used black vortexes to get rid of the outer wall of the primitive land, he ordered the Troubled Creatures to attack. That was when a vast number of Troubled Creatures swarmed to the primitive land from all directions, attacking left and right.
<br><br>
However, Zen's primitive land had expanded a lot. This brought about a long distance between the outer wall to the Pear Hill and the Ruin Graveyard in the center. It would take the Troubled Creatures quite a long time to get there.
<br><br>
Once he controlled the Burial Land, Zen ignored the Troubled Creatures so they safely continued to fly in the void.
<br><br>
If one looked closely from the farthest corner of the Burial Land, they would easily spot a number of Troubled Creatures huddled together like a black ball as they moved towards the center.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, blue bands of light appeared on the bodies of the Troubled Creatures. Simultaneously, their bodies increased in size as the black ball moved even quicker than before.
<br><br>
Realizing that something was wrong, Zen appeared in the center of the Burial Land and immediately sent a message as the controller. "All of you, return! Now!"
<br><br>
Because the Troubled Creatures were born in the Burial Land, they were completely under Zen's control.
<br><br>
The creatures were determined to get to their goal and quickened their pace. However, the moment they heard Zen's message, they stopped in their tracks and flowed backwards. The ball they formed expanded as they made their way back.
<br><br>
Splash! Just then, black flames appeared at the center of the Burial Land too. With the irregular heavy sword in his hand, the downgrader roared his order, "Kill everything you see! That is an order!"
<br><br>
When the Troubled Creatures heard this, they roared once again and charged forward. At the hands of the downgrader, they actually disobeyed Zen's order without hesitation.
<br><br>
The downgrader looked at Zen with a grin across his face. "Look how weak your power is. What kind of controller are you?" he mocked.
<br><br>
Zen's face darkened at the downgrader's words. "These Troubled Creatures can't withstand even a single blow. What is it to you if you can control them?"
<br><br>
Without a second thought, Zen released a thousand avatars.
<br><br>
When he'd used an avatar before, the avatar wiped out a hundred million Troubled Creatures. Though the creatures were enormous, they were still considerably weak in battle.
<br><br>
This time was different, and it went beyond any of Zen's expectations.
<br><br>
As one of the avatars rushed towards the Troubled Creatures, he released invisible blades from his body. However, before the blades approached the Troubled Creatures, their bodies fluctuated. They charged and tore the avatar into pieces.
<br><br>
Likewise, they did the same to the other avatars before them. Within seconds, all the avatars were ripped apart by the Troubled Creatures, which puzzled Zen even more. His best counterattack stood absolutely no chance.
<br><br>
"I made a few light changes to them. Do you like it?" the downgrader said, smiling down at Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 4296 Infinity Zen looked at the densely packed Troubled Creatures with disbelief.
<br><br>
These Troubled Creatures that were previously weak like ants had suddenly turned as terrifying as beasts.
<br><br>
"You could change all the Troubled Creatures?" Zen asked, staring at the downgrader with wide eyes.
<br><br>
"Of course," the downgrader replied. It seemed that he had long anticipated this question, and he said indifferently, "I just gave them the Hyperspace Extreme Form, making them more free."
<br><br>
Taking a deep breath, Zen closed his eyes and quickly got a number.
<br><br>
Seventy-six billion six hundred and nineteen million three hundred and thirty-four thousand four hundred and eighty-one.
<br><br>
This was the number of Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
"You could give this many Troubled Creatures the Extreme Form energy?" Zen asked again as he still couldn't believe it.
<br><br>
"Of course," the downgrader replied calmly.
<br><br>
"No way! No one can do that!"
<br><br>
Zen argued, refusing to accept his answer.
<br><br>
With a wave of his hand, three thousand avatars appeared and surrounded him.
<br><br>
As soon as these avatars popped up, they immediately used the Grand Teleportation to rush towards the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
The result was the same as what happened before.
<br><br>
After the avatars appeared around the Troubled Creatures, they were like innocent sheep being mercilessly thrown into a vicious tiger's mouth.
<br><br>
They were instantly slaughtered and torn apart.
<br><br>
In just half a minute, all three thousand avatars died.
<br><br>
The direction in which these avatars used the Grand Teleportation was completely random, which meant that the downgrader didn't lie about his claim. He had truly bestowed the Hyperspace Extreme Form on tens of billions of Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
"How did you do it? It's impossible!" Zen's voice sounded of a hint of bitterness. The downgrader had indeed done something he couldn't imagine.
<br><br>
The consumption of the energy was tremendous, and the primitive land wasn't capable of continuously supplying it.
<br><br>
For example, the Evil God possessed all the Extreme Form energies, but he usually didn't dare to activate such energies because the Source World couldn't provide enough energy for him.
<br><br>
Zen had the ancestry-level bloodline, so he had more energy than the Evil God.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had limitless energy that could supply about ten people with Extreme Form energy at the same time.
<br><br>
This was already remarkable and impressive.
<br><br>
Yet, the downgrader could supply tens of billions of Troubled Creatures with Extreme Form energy all at the same time.
<br><br>
He was countless times more powerful than the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
In comparison, the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline came out as a ridiculous joke.
<br><br>
The downgrader observed Zen's expression, and there was a bit of mockery in his intense glare. "You think it's impossible because the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline has been enough to make you proud and even laugh so arrogantly until this turning point.
<br><br>
Do you think the ancestry-level bloodline can provide energy as infinite as a river? Ironically, a river's length is infinite but its width is limited. I'm afraid that's not the real infinity.
<br><br>
This is what real infinity looks like..."
<br><br>
the downgrader said, raising the irregular heavy sword in his hand.
<br><br>
Buzz! Purple energy started to flash from each of the cracks of the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
This was the Destruction Extreme Form.
<br><br>
At the same time, the eyes of all the Troubled Creatures turned into purple.
<br><br>
They were all infused with the energy of the Destruction Extreme Form.
<br><br>
If the Extreme Form energy burst out all at the same time, it would be enough to destroy the huge Burial Land hundreds of times! "Real infinity refers to infinite length, infinite width, and infinite size.
<br><br>
There isn't a single limit to this word." The voice of the downgrader resonated with some kind of magic power.
<br><br>
Every word he uttered was a heavy punch to Zen's heart, making him tremble.
<br><br>
"Why can't I do this?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Why?" The downgrader chuckled as he seemed to have heard a joke.
<br><br>
"I've already said that you're just a tool, not a person who uses the tool. I guess you don't understand the meaning of infinity at all. This is the limit of your life, Zen."
<br><br>
"As you said, I am a tool. But the ancestry-level bloodline has its consciousness. Why can't it do this, either?" Zen asked again as he was losing his patience.
<br><br>
The downgrader, who was so sure of winning, dealt with him very patiently. He continued to explain, "It had inadvertently obtained its consciousness. It's also just a tool."
<br><br>
Zen fell silent for a while.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline didn't refute even as it heard these words.
<br><br>
"I... I don't believe it!"
<br><br>
Zen growled as flames suddenly appeared in his eyes.
<br><br>
Circles of light then began to appear above his head.
<br><br>
Seven kinds of Extreme Form energy exploded in alternating turns, strengthening his body like crazy.
<br><br>
In order to fight this battle, Zen had tried to strengthen himself with Extreme Form energies and trained both day and night. These seven kinds of Extreme Form energy were indeed the most effective.
<br><br>
His body expanded rapidly, turning him into a height of ten feet. Precious crystals appeared on the surface of his body that made him look like an enormous glass man. A pair of blue wings unfolded from his wide back, and finally, a purple sword appeared in his hand which he gripped tightly.
<br><br>
The downgrader saw the changes in Zen, but he remained composed. He then raised the irregular heavy sword horizontally.
<br><br>
"The Probability Extreme Form!"
<br><br>
Zen let out a roar that shook the whole area.
<br><br>
A large cloud formed above him and the downgrader and started to envelop them.
<br><br>
Zen summoned one thousand avatars, and so did the downgrader.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! The long purple sword, which was transformed from the Destruction Extreme Form, and the irregular heavy sword collided with each other repeatedly, bursting out the power of destruction each time. In the blink of an eye, they had already clashed for more than ten thousand times. The entire cloud was filled with powerful energy. Any ordinary Eternal Realm warriors would have disappeared in such an environment in an instant.
<br><br>
"You don't have to be shamed into anger," the downgrader said as he easily withstood all of Zen's attacks. "Clarence and I have used more than ten million tools. In fact, you are the best among the rest."
<br><br>
"You are the tool! Go to hell!" Zen's sword attack became even more powerful as he was consumed by his rage.
<br><br>
Boom! The energy of the Destruction Extreme Form exploded, igniting a huge purple flame that surrounded the downgrader.
<br><br>
After the purple flame dissipated, the downgrader came out unscathed.
<br><br>
"I'm praising you..."
<br><br>
But before he could finish his words, Zen struck him again.
<br><br>
The purple flame engulfed the downgrader once more.
<br><br>
Because of the cloud, the people on the jadeite platform couldn't see the battle between Zen and the downgrader, but they saw the Troubled Creatures rapidly approaching.
<br><br>
"The speed of these Troubled Creatures is unimaginably fast. It's very strange," Kincaid said as he was the first to notice that something was wrong.
<br><br>
"Well, they seem to be much stronger than before," Hilario said as he observed.
<br><br>
"Zen, what's happening?" the Snake Goddess asked as she stared at Zen's avatar on the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen's avatar knew the reason. He hesitated whether he should tell everyone the cruel truth or not. After thinking for a while, he said, "All the Troubled Creatures are given the energy of the Hyperspace Extreme Form by the downgrader."
<br><br>
"All the Troubled Creatures?" Hilario's eyes widened.
<br><br>
"Do you mean that every Troubled Creature has the energy of Hyperspace Extreme Form? Are you serious?" Hilario stared at Zen in shock, clearly in suspicion.
<br><br>
"There are a total of about seventy billion Troubled Creatures, and each of them is bestowed with the Hyperspace Extreme Form. At the same time, their bodies are also infused with the energy of the Destruction Extreme Form," Zen's avatar narrated in a dry tone.
<br><br>
"How is that possible? You must be lying..." Fuxi said as his voice trembled. He was confused at everything that Zen's avatar said.
<br><br>
Chapter 4297 Infinite Treatment Nobody dared to look down upon the downgrader. If he was able to downgrade the worlds, then that meant he was extremely powerful.
<br><br>
Surely though, there was a limit to his strength.
<br><br>
The power he just exhibited exceeded everyone's expectations and filled their bodies with despair. How could he be so powerful? "It wasn't a lie. He truly has real, infinite energy," Zen's avatar muttered, trying his best to remain calm.
<br><br>
"The real infinity..."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess smiled in self-mockery. "If that is the case then resistance is futile."
<br><br>
All numbers meant nothing with regards to the real definition of infinity.
<br><br>
"It was once said that the truth was controlled by us six Chaos Ancient Gods; however, the infinite energy displayed by the downgrader is the absolute truth. This is power with no restrictions." Gerald could only sigh.
<br><br>
All hope that remained in their hearts had been quashed by this revelation.
<br><br>
It wasn't just them. Even the energy souls that floated around the Civilization Artifact also felt dejected. They had sacrificed themselves yet in the end, it was all for naught.
<br><br>
"But... Don't you still want to give it a try?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
His voice had been loud and everyone on the jadeite platform heard him.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's words triggered something in them. Kincaid, who had previously also lost hope, raised his head. "You're right! Despair is meaningless! Since we cannot escape death, then we must at least face it head-on in battle!"
<br><br>
"My dream has been completed. Even if I die, I will have no regrets," Itzel seconded.
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
With just a few hopeful words, the morale on the jadeite platform rose exponentially.
<br><br>
A blue ring of light appeared in the hand of Zen's avatar, which contained the energy of the Hyperspace Extreme Form.
<br><br>
"Zen? Why?" Rocher asked, having felt the mysterious power of space.
<br><br>
"You may be stronger than the Troubled Creatures but the fact remains that they have the Hyperspace Extreme Form. Other than Geoffrey, nobody else would be able to touch them. Allow me to help you offset their advantage," Zen's avatar replied.
<br><br>
Even if Zen's avatars were stronger than everyone present on the platform, the Troubled Creatures had no problem slaying every single one. This was because the Troubled Creatures were endowed with the Hyperspace Extreme Form, which rendered them uncatchable.
<br><br>
The only way to resist was to reduce this advantage. Zen's avatars could create a large area wherein everyone could muster the strength to fight back.
<br><br>
Zen's heart, however, was clear.
<br><br>
He knew that resistance was futile as they were faced against about seventy billion Troubled Creatures with the Hyperspace and Destruction Extreme Forms. There was no winning this fight.
<br><br>
Buzz! One of his avatars suddenly appeared in a hall on top of Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Yan sat in the pavilion on the left side of the hall. Geoffrey's voice buzzed in her ears and she had half a mind to go and join everyone on the jadeite platform even if the Snake Goddess had yet to summon her.
<br><br>
"Brother?" Yan called out when she saw Zen's avatar.
<br><br>
"Would you like to join us?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Yes! Of course!" she replied with no hesitation.
<br><br>
In the fairy palace, another one of Zen's avatars appeared in Letitia's room.
<br><br>
His sudden appearance surprised her but she remained calm.
<br><br>
With her cultivation base, it was hard for her to tell whether it was truly Zen or just his avatar.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, Letitia gave him a gentle smile. "It seems that time is running out, huh?"
<br><br>
"Yes," he nodded. "I'm..."
<br><br>
Just as he was about to apologize, Letitia held a finger to his lips and shushed him. "You didn't do anything wrong."
<br><br>
And with that, Zen simply pulled her close and held her in his arms.
<br><br>
In a courtyard of the fairy palace, Margaret was currently placing some books in front of Salome. The young girl was extremely intelligent and could already read, so Margaret thought it best to borrow some books from the library for her.
<br><br>
In the midst of their study session, Zen's avatar quietly condensed and stared at her and Salome.
<br><br>
His appearance went unnoticed as Margaret was too busy sorting the books out.
<br><br>
Salome, however, noticed him and called out to her father. Margaret stiffened and when she turned around, her eyes were already red with tears.
<br><br>
She had heard Zen's announcement. She was no fool. She completely understood the current situation they were all in.
<br><br>
Unlike Letitia, however, Margaret was afraid of death and couldn't handle this calmly.
<br><br>
"Waah... Waah..."
<br><br>
With a loud sob, Margaret ran to Zen's avatar and collapsed in his arms.
<br><br>
"Salome hasn't even grown up yet! She's innocent! She hasn't seen much of the world. Can you protect her and let her live on?"
<br><br>
Her words stabbed a metaphorical blade onto Zen's heart but he shook his head. "I'm sorry."
<br><br>
"What if you send her to the chaos?" Margaret asked again.
<br><br>
"Not even the chaos will let her escape this disaster," he told her.
<br><br>
"What about the Abstruse Energy World? Salome could live there, right? Why not send her there?" Margaret insisted, not willing to give up just yet.
<br><br>
She had heard of that magical world and knew her daughter was talented so maybe she could live there? She had no idea of the situation in the Abstruse Energy World but she didn't care. All she wanted was for her daughter to live on.
<br><br>
"She won't be able to escape this disaster there either," Zen said, shaking his head once again.
<br><br>
Not understanding what was happening, Salome simply looked on at her parents and behaved well.
<br><br>
She had read many books but her time in this world was too short. Of course, she knew life and death but did not really have a good grasp of what those two concepts truly meant.
<br><br>
"Why? Why?" Margaret continued to wail.
<br><br>
Another avatar also appeared in Aura's room.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't the only one to say his final goodbyes to his family.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the other Eternal Realm warriors did the same thing. Some bade farewell to their loved ones, while others felt the need to inform their inner worlds of their imminent destruction.
<br><br>
In the cloud of Probability Extreme Form, Zen had transformed into a thousand avatars that launched more than ten thousand sword strikes towards the downgrader.
<br><br>
Despite the attacks, the downgrader did not even bother summoning his avatars to dodge.
<br><br>
More than ten thousand long swords came at him as he floated in the air, all of them transformed from the Destruction Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! There was a flash of violet as the purple sword radiance drew over ten thousand paths in the air in an effort to slash at the downgrader.
<br><br>
The power Zen released at that moment should've been enough to tear his enemy to shreds and even disintegrate him.
<br><br>
However, the downgrader remained completely unharmed.
<br><br>
In fact, a strong aura of life continued to emanate from his body as he activated the Life Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Of course, that alone was not the reason as to why he was able to withstand Zen's attack. In truth, an infinite energy of the Life Extreme Form was gathered in his body.
<br><br>
Any damage dealt to him was repaired at an imperceptible speed. That was why such a miraculous scene was delivered.
<br><br>
Chapter 4298 A Strange State "Again!"
<br><br>
Zen roared, and over a thousand avatars appeared at his command again.
<br><br>
The avatars formed a circle while overlapping with each other and violently slashed the downgrader.
<br><br>
Ten thousand sword strikes.
<br><br>
Thirty thousand sword strikes.
<br><br>
One hundred thousand sword strikes! Despite their all-out attack, the downgrader still emerged unharmed.
<br><br>
"I might have overestimated you," he sneered. "After all, you are not even a member of the Cinnabar race or the Fostering race in the fifth-grade world. You don't have that many chances to use the Extreme Form energies," he commented with a sly smile as if nothing happened.
<br><br>
After he finished speaking, he suddenly raised his hand and the irregular heavy sword emitted a blinding orange light.
<br><br>
Splash! An orange ring of light then started to spread out from the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
When the orange ring of light passed through Zen's avatars who surrounded the downgrader, they instantly evaporated into beams of light and disappeared without a trace. Only the real Zen was left.
<br><br>
"You may not be convinced, but I can easily kill you even without using the infinite energy!"
<br><br>
Buzz! The irregular heavy sword flashed with different colors this time. In an instant, massive amounts of Extreme Form energies were unleashed from each of its cracks.
<br><br>
When Zen saw the irregular heavy sword flashing, he became distracted.
<br><br>
"The Soul Extreme Form!"
<br><br>
Zen uttered as he recognized it.
<br><br>
However, the downgrader did not intend to use the Soul Extreme Form to create an illusion and control Zen. He only wanted to divert Zen's attention. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he rushed towards Zen as he dragged the irregular heavy sword. He pulled it up afterward, creating huge sword radiance.
<br><br>
Bang! Without hesitation, Zen swung his purple sword at the irregular heavy sword.
<br><br>
He had immediately blocked himself from the attack of the heavy irregular sword.
<br><br>
However, an invisible force passed through Zen, splitting the cloud in half, which forced Zen to withdraw from the Probability Extreme Form.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Zen's heart skipped a beat. With a gentle pinch of his hand, he bolted away from the downgrader through the Hyperspace Extreme Form.
<br><br>
However, the downgrader didn't let Zen get away. He went after him with a much faster speed.
<br><br>
Before Zen could leave, the irregular heavy sword cut through the distorted space and drew an arc in the air, slitting down towards his head.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The irregular heavy sword sheared down Zen's head, mimicking a sound of rotten wood being chopped down.
<br><br>
Zen's entire body began to twist, transforming into a strange kind of wood. The wood grew rapidly and entangled the downgrader. At this point, the downgrader was unable to break free as he was firmly planted in place. The light in his six pairs of compound eyes then dissipated, while the Extreme Form energies that flickered in the cracks of the irregular heavy sword gradually faded out.
<br><br>
"It is... The Energy-devouring Wood..."
<br><br>
A part of the downgrader's mouth had been shut by coiled branches. It was a bit difficult for him to speak or even mutter a few words.
<br><br>
The Energy-devouring Wood was a product of the combination of the Life Extreme Form and another extreme form. It had once been popular in the Deep Space. The Cinnabar race had even created a forest full of Energydevouring Wood to impede the attacks of the Fostering race.
<br><br>
The downgrader didn't expect Zen to employ the Energy-devouring Wood at all. He had accidentally been trapped by the Energy-devouring Wood which absorbed all the Extreme Form energies from his body.
<br><br>
"I don't even know what kind of wood it is. I only know that it can trap and kill you!"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes flared with a mix of colors.
<br><br>
By the looks of it, two kinds of Extreme Form energies had been heavily accumulating.
<br><br>
The purple color was the Destruction Extreme Form.
<br><br>
The white one was the Doubling Extreme Form.
<br><br>
The Destruction Extreme Form turned into a huge arrow that dragged a blazing purple flame behind.
<br><br>
While the Doubling Extreme Form formed both large and small white rings of light that extended from Zen all the way to the downgrader.
<br><br>
The Destruction Extreme Form was the most destructive of the one hundred and forty kinds of Extreme Form energies, and its power was multiplied by the Doubling Extreme Form.
<br><br>
The long arrow traveled fiercely across the small and large rings of light and shot the body of the downgrader.
<br><br>
Splash! The sky suddenly lit up with what appeared as a huge firework.
<br><br>
The purple flame was, in fact, more than ten thousand miles long.
<br><br>
Any target that was hit would undoubtedly die, yet no trace of joy reflected on Zen's face.
<br><br>
The downgrader had changed the infinite energy into a limited one, which gave Zen a chance to counterattack.
<br><br>
However, he didn't think that he would kill the downgrader just like that.
<br><br>
His trump card could at most save him some pride.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! A round of applause came from behind.
<br><br>
As expected, the downgrader reappeared.
<br><br>
"You have already figured out these methods not long after you brought back the Heavenly Ring Staff. I underestimated you.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, you still don't stand a chance.
<br><br>
Go to hell!"
<br><br>
The downgrader reached out his hand and swept towards Zen.
<br><br>
His energy was boosting to infinity again.
<br><br>
Infinity meant that he was absolutely powerful and unparalleled, and no one could resist him.
<br><br>
But Zen suddenly disappeared.
<br><br>
He was still the master of the Burial Land after all. He didn't need to use the Hyperspace Extreme Form, the Grand Teleportation, or construct a space channel to appear anywhere. The reason he activated the Hyperspace Extreme Form now was to trick the downgrader.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen disappear without warning, the downgrader said indifferently, "Playing hide and seek is useless. This world is too small, and you have nowhere to escape. The Probability Extreme Form..."
<br><br>
Boom! A thick black cloud then started to disperse.
<br><br>
The downgrader created a huge cloud that could fill the entire Burial Land. It was made up of countless smaller clouds.
<br><br>
As he stood beneath the huge cloud, Zen reacted quickly and turned into a thousand avatars who scattered in all directions. It was hard for the downgrader to find the real Zen now.
<br><br>
But after a few moments, Zen became desperate as he was struck with a realization.
<br><br>
Since there were one thousand avatars in a cloud, countless avatars should also appear in countless clouds. In Zen's eyes, numerous downgraders filled every corner of the Burial Land as well.
<br><br>
There was no way for over a thousand avatars of Zen to escape. All of them were instantly killed by the downgrader.
<br><br>
"This is your primitive land, and you can safely revive even if you die.
<br><br>
But how many times are you able to do so?" the downgrader asked condescendingly.
<br><br>
He didn't withdraw the clouds or his avatars and quietly waited for Zen to come back to life.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, countless fragments of different sizes scattered from the broken Source World.
<br><br>
There was a body embedded in the crack of a rock with a diameter of three hundred miles.
<br><br>
It was a huge hyena.
<br><br>
When the Source World was destroyed by the needle, it was feasting on its prey. An unimaginable force swept down from above and split its head from its body.
<br><br>
It was expected to die shortly as it had been beheaded.
<br><br>
Compared to the creatures that had been sacrificed in the Source World and didn't even have traces of their corpses left, this hyena was already lucky.
<br><br>
What was luckier was it was still breathing.
<br><br>
With unexpected consciousness, it saw the neat cut on its neck after its head was severed from its body. It could even give an order to its body and get it out of that crack.
<br><br>
Two hours later, it was still alive.
<br><br>
Four hours later, it was still alive.
<br><br>
Ten hours later, it felt a little hungry as its stomach began to rumble.
<br><br>
Its head controlled its body to grab the dead roe deer nearby. It then directed it to stuff the deer into its mouth, and then gobbled it ravenously with its sharp teeth.
<br><br>
Although the hyena wasn't very intelligent, it had a feeling that this was the strangest way of eating.
<br><br>
It continued to chew and swallow the flesh it devoured until it felt its stomach becoming full.
<br><br>
This was what confused it the most. It seemed that its head and body remained intact in a very incomprehensible way.
<br><br>
Chapter 4299 The Method Of Restriction Such a kind of odd thing was happening across the Source World.
<br><br>
Severed body parts lay scattered across the devastated area of the Bloom Divine Province. Some citizens were lucky enough to survive with limbs still attached, but they were broken, all the same.
<br><br>
Those who had lost limbs, however, didn't feel any pain. In fact, they found they could still control their severed body parts just like the hyena could.
<br><br>
An old man's body had been halved from the waist, but he could still feel his legs. When he controlled his legs to walk, he could see the severed limbs moving in the distance.
<br><br>
Cries of horror and confusion began to break out. "We must have been cursed!"
<br><br>
"How can we still be alive?"
<br><br>
The remaining creatures in the Source World wailed, aghast at their condition.
<br><br>
Whereas before, they could look to the Other Shore for the answers to some mysteries, this was completely unprecedented.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the province where the Evil God was located had also been decimated by the needle, the black hall reduced to rubble.
<br><br>
When the huge needle fell down from above the Source World, its gargantuan size flattened the province evenly.
<br><br>
Most of the Holy Soul Realm warriors and Eternal Realm warriors in the black hall survived, however. They began to scramble out of the ruins.
<br><br>
Only one Holy Soul Realm warrior was killed and three were injured.
<br><br>
"The Source World has been destroyed, but we are still alive. Is it finally over?" a Holy Soul Realm warrior asked.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm warrior next to him scoffed. "Dream on. In the past, at the end of a chaotic era, it wasn't the needle that killed people. The needle only broke the Source World. Now, we're actually in the chaos and no longer under any protection of the Source World. When that last thunder rolls again, we're doomed."
<br><br>
An air of gloom descended over them. He was correct. The Source World had been destroyed and could no longer protect them.
<br><br>
Just then, a Holy Soul Realm warrior not far away began sputtering loudly, "Look! What a strange phenomenon!"
<br><br>
He was one of the three injured Holy Soul Realm warriors. One of his arms had been severed and lay hundreds of feet away from him.
<br><br>
"What phenomenon?" an Eternal Realm warrior asked.
<br><br>
The injured Holy Soul Realm warrior pointed at his arm in the distance.
<br><br>
"My arm is still connected to me."
<br><br>
"What nonsense are you talking about?"
<br><br>
"It's true! Take a closer look if you don't believe me!" The injured Holy Soul Realm warrior concentrated on moving the severed arm. The severed arm indeed began to flex its fingers.
<br><br>
However, the arm was a long way away from the warrior's body.
<br><br>
"What a basic trick. How can you goof around at a time like this?" the Eternal Realm warrior said, exasperated.
<br><br>
With their cultivation base and strength, it was too easy for them to make objects move with their mind.
<br><br>
The injured Holy Soul Realm warrior remained adamant. "I'm not playing around! I'm telling the truth! I don't feel the injury at all. It's like that arm is still attached to me!"
<br><br>
The warrior struggled to explain his condition.
<br><br>
Just then, another Eternal Realm warrior piped up, "Actually, I've also been sensing something anomalous..."
<br><br>
"Anomalous? How so?"
<br><br>
"If you release your spiritual sense, you will know that. The entire landscape appears to be destroyed, but my spiritual sense shows me otherwise. It's like this is all an illusion," the Eternal Realm warrior said.
<br><br>
The other Eternal Realm warriors and the Holy Soul Realm warriors hurriedly tapped into their spiritual senses then.
<br><br>
A sense of unease came over them as they saw the anomaly for themselves.
<br><br>
Some of the Eternal Realm warriors used the Grand Teleportation technique to get around the broken landscape to confirm what they were seeing.
<br><br>
Rocks, mountains, and trees all seemed crushed to the naked eye and touch, but they remained fully intact under the lens of the spiritual senses.
<br><br>
The dissonance was disorienting.
<br><br>
High up in the sky, Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven hovered side by side, observing matters.
<br><br>
The two of them had keen senses and had already detected the abnormality in the Source World much earlier.
<br><br>
"Everything in this world appears destroyed, but everything is actually intact. There must be some force behind this. What do you think, Master Duran?" The Grandmaster of Heaven himself was stumped.
<br><br>
"It must be related to the Evil God somehow. He would probably know,"
<br><br>
said Duran.
<br><br>
"He disappeared without a trace the instant the needle descended. Even his avatars are gone. I don't know what he's planning," the Grandmaster of Heaven grumbled. He was really hoping the Evil God didn't escape.
<br><br>
He knew that everyone, including the Evil God, couldn't escape after the Source World was destroyed.
<br><br>
"I'm figuring out how to restore the Source World."
<br><br>
The voice of the Evil God suddenly rang out around them.
<br><br>
Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven watched as the real Evil God slowly materialized in the distance.
<br><br>
"That would be impossible," the Grandmaster of Heaven scoffed, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"The Source World has already fallen. You would have lost the power of the primitive land along with it," reminded Duran.
<br><br>
The Source World, the Burial Land, and Zen's primitive land all got a portion of separate space from the chaos. When one collapsed, the invisible boundaries would disappear, and the space would merge with the chaos.
<br><br>
Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven, of course, assumed the Evil God was no longer the controller of the Source World because the Source World no longer existed.
<br><br>
The corners of the Evil God's mouth curled up. "That's where you're wrong."
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
Blue light beams flickered behind him. The Evil God's avatars appeared one after another until tens of thousands of them hovered in the air.
<br><br>
"What?" The Grandmaster of Heaven could only gawk in shock.
<br><br>
"You haven't lost the power of the Source World!" Duran exclaimed.
<br><br>
"Because the Source World hasn't collapsed," the real Evil God said with a faint smile.
<br><br>
"How could you say that?" The Grandmaster of Heaven pointed at the horizon, where a huge crack merged desolately with the chaos.
<br><br>
"It is not what it seems," the Evil God said dismissively. "Watch."
<br><br>
The Evil God stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
With a flick of his wrist, pieces of the broken landscape began to move.
<br><br>
Pebbles gathered together until they reformed into boulders. Trees, mountains, rivers all returned smoothly to their original state.
<br><br>
Everything within a hundred miles were restored to their previous condition. The ruins had all disappeared. It was as if the needle had missed the area.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven could hardly believe it. "How did you do that? That's astounding!" he gasped.
<br><br>
"I activated the Restriction Field as the needle shot towards the Source World. It can resist any hit, protecting everything therein," the Evil God replied.
<br><br>
"That's amazing!" Duran exclaimed.
<br><br>
"Doing so, I discovered something new about the Restriction Field," the Evil God went on, motioning to the distance. "After being hit by the needle, many fragments of the Source World erupted into the chaos.
<br><br>
Those materials are still within the Restriction Field."
<br><br>
"What does that mean?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"It means that the further those fragments go, the bigger the Source World would be," the Evil God replied.
<br><br>
