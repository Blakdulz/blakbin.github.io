Chapter 3200 Serious Trouble Warriors from the Su City and Xu City gradually felt the gravity of the situation. Horror filled their minds.
<br><br>
The Su Clan was the weakest among all clans around the Clear Lake. They only majored in weapon refining, which had no high requirement in terms of cultivation base.
<br><br>
But the heads of the Xu Clan, Li Clan, Zhao Clan and others were all at the peak of Lust World. Some of them had even crossed the Lust World and reached the threshold of the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
They knew exactly how powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm were! The realm was the first limit that many of them would physically encounter.
<br><br>
Lazlo was a mere half-step from the Chaotic Source Realm, while Drystan was also close to the realm.
<br><br>
But just within a few minutes, Zen had killed both of them.
<br><br>
This was an unthinkable turn of events for many of them.
<br><br>
The head of the Xu Clan was at first motivated to stop Zen. He was even willing to kill him if he had to.
<br><br>
But this motivation was replaced by fear as soon as he saw Drystan get killed. He halted in mid-air and slowly backed away from Zen.
<br><br>
He knew he was no match for Zen, but he also knew that he shouldn't just let Marco die at the hands of Zen. He was in a dilemma: should he try to counter Zen's attacks or flee to safety? As soon as he killed Drystan, Zen no longer had any hesitation in him.
<br><br>
He flew swiftly like a big hawk and went straight to Marco.
<br><br>
Marco only had Grayson for a guard.
<br><br>
And Grayson was the weakest among the three.
<br><br>
It was a good thing that he had his Other Shore Token, the Spying Mirror, with him. With it, he was able to detect his opponents in secret.
<br><br>
"You brat! I'll fight you to death!"
<br><br>
Grayson's eyes opened wide with fury. A small mirror appeared above his head.
<br><br>
A beam of radiance shot out of the mirror's surface. It went straight towards Zen.
<br><br>
Phew! Zen was able to dodge it at the last second. He focused on reaching Grayson all while avoiding the light. The long sword in his hand left a long trail in the air.
<br><br>
Crack! Zen couldn't even be bothered to use the Sword Texture Technique as well as the demonic eye.
<br><br>
Instead, a silver light beamed in the air and pierced right through Grayson.
<br><br>
It sliced him from top to bottom and cut him in half. Finally, the all of the three were gone.
<br><br>
With Grayson out of the way, Zen and Marco were finally looking at each other eye to eye.
<br><br>
Marco was still lying on the waters, protected by the diamond-shaped light curtain. Above him hovered Zen, gazing at him coldly.
<br><br>
Just a few moments earlier, Zen launched an all-out attack. Marco ended up badly injured, with only the light curtain to protect him. The Latent Theurgy had saved his life once, but it wasn't going to save him each time.
<br><br>
With Lazlo, Drystan, and Grayson dead, he no longer had anyone that could save him from Zen.
<br><br>
Marco's eyes filled with fear as Zen loomed overhead. He stared at Zen with his remaining energy and, with a trembling voice, declared, "You can't kill me!"
<br><br>
"You tried to kill me more than once!" Zen said with gaze so piercing it would make anyone shiver.
<br><br>
"But I failed every time! You survived!" Marco retorted desperately.
<br><br>
"I survived?" Zen laughed. A mocking smile appeared on his face.
<br><br>
The moment of their first encounter in the temple, Marco had already attempted to kill Zen. During their second encounter at the Seven Mountains Meeting, Marco barely held himself back. The third time, he rushed into the Flow Sword Sect to challenge Zen. Now, they were face to face once more.
<br><br>
If Zen let him go, there would be no assurance that Marco would give up.
<br><br>
"If you kill me now, you will regret it! People of the Vastness Mountain will not let you off, neither will my father!" Marco resorted to using his status and identity as a way out. He knew begging Zen and enticing pity out of him was useless.
<br><br>
He knew that no ordinary disciple of the Flow Sword Sect would dare offend the Vastness Mountain, one of the seven mountains in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the head of the Xu Clan and Cailen arrived. "Young man, I implore you to think about what you're about to do," the head of the Xu Clan persuaded. "His death would cause the entire Oneness Sky Palace to go into chaos. There will be no place for you in the palace!"
<br><br>
He turned to wink at Cailen.
<br><br>
Cailen had never intended to get involved in this matter at all, but he wanted to maintain their clan's close relationship with the Xu Clan, and the Xu Clan had asked for his intervention.
<br><br>
Cailen also agreed that Zen should not kill Marco.
<br><br>
Unlike these declining clans around the Clear Lake, the Vastness Mountain was a great power that Zen couldn't afford to offend.
<br><br>
"Zen, they're right. Please think twice before you kill a direct descendant of the Vastness Mountain," Cailen pointed out.
<br><br>
Zen turned to look at them both. "So what do I do? Not fight back and pretend he hasn't repeatedly attempted to kill me? Are we going to allow this power play just because I was born inferior?"
<br><br>
"But..." the head of the Xu Clan stammered through a response. He knew Zen was right.
<br><br>
"He's not the first of his kind to have given me threats, nor will he be the last," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
Then, he turned towards Marco and swung his sword at him.
<br><br>
The light curtain created by the Latent Theurgy was about to collapse. Zen's attack weakened the shield and cut Marco's head.
<br><br>
Marco opened his mouth to plead more, but it was too late.
<br><br>
Splash! His dead body fell and floated into the water.
<br><br>
"Oh no. This is going to be a serious trouble for all of us!" the head of the Xu Clan exclaimed.
<br><br>
Marco's presence was a big honor to their clan, but now he was killed before his own eyes. How was he going to explain to the Vastness Mountain? Cailen's eyelids widened. Anxiety filled his heart. He knew that what Zen did was impulsive and reckless, but at the back of his mind he felt deep admiration. Zen had once more proven how extraordinary he was. If he continued growing, he would end up as a legendary figure.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Many warriors of Xu Clan who witnessed the murder flew into the air to approach Zen.
<br><br>
Not everyone was well-aware of what was truly happening. All they cared about was that Marco was a member of the Xu Clan. They would not allow Zen to escape their sight.
<br><br>
Zen was strong, but the members of the Xu Clan outnumbered him. They were confident they'd win against a single person.
<br><br>
Zen narrowed his eyes and placed his long sword horizontally across his chest. "Anyone who stands in my way will die," he warned.
<br><br>
As he spoke, a white light flashed across his right eye.
<br><br>
The warriors floating above the Clear Lake felt shivers go down their spines. With fearful gazes, they stared at Zen.
<br><br>
"Let him go," said the head of the Xu Clan in an exhausted voice.
<br><br>
He knew that Zen could easily escape their hands. He didn't want to risk any more lives just to stop him from leaving.
<br><br>
He wanted to act smarter.
<br><br>
Zen returned to the Su Clan's crowd. The blank faces of Ruben, Reid, and all the others welcomed him.
<br><br>
The Su Clan knew they were in big trouble if they were to be implicated.
<br><br>
Only Gant stepped forward with a look of admiration on his face. "Flag Master, you truly are formidable!" he praised.
<br><br>
Zen patted his shoulder. "I killed Marco. Aren't you afraid of being implicated?"
<br><br>
Cailen and all the others were cursing Gant in their minds. All they wanted was to disassociate from Zen.
<br><br>
"Afraid of being implicated?" Gant raised his brows. "There must be several thousand direct descendants in the seven mountains, but there are only a dozen of disciples capable of Instant Enlightenment as you are. I highly doubt they'd do anything against you, Flag Master!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3201 Slaps An uncomfortable silence hung in the air after Gant said those words to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen was a talented warrior who was capable of Instant Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Moreover, he had Athemar's support. That being said, this made it difficult for the people of the Vastness Mountain to get back at Zen.
<br><br>
Of course, Gant was aware that his clan was trying to be cautious. After all, the Su Clan was but a weapon refining clan; they bore little to no importance to the Oneness Sky Palace. They couldn't afford to provoke the people of the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
Gant surveyed the elders before him. They, as well as the other people of the Su Clan, all looked quite surprised.
<br><br>
The people started to whisper amongst themselves. "Zen is capable of Instant Enlightenment?"
<br><br>
"Only fourteen people could do that in the history of the Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
"No wonder Zen was so confident and did not hesitate to kill Marco."
<br><br>
"Fine," Zen said quietly. He knew Gant was constantly trying to please him.
<br><br>
"Now, do we still need to continue fighting?"
<br><br>
Zen took a look at his surroundings. His battle with Marco dealt a lot of damage to the battle ring. Huge cracks dotted the drums.
<br><br>
The other clans like the Li Clan and the Zhao Clan were also quiet. They were unwilling to fight because they knew very well that none of their young warriors could match Zen's strength.
<br><br>
Also, the battle that just took place was truly gruesome. None of the clans was in the mood to compete with each other.
<br><br>
All the clan masters gathered together to discuss. Finally, they decided that the Su Clan should take control of the Ripple Pavilion.
<br><br>
And with that, the gathering at the Ripple Pavilion came to an end. Despite everything that happened, Zen ended up helping the Su Clan reach their goal; he owed them nothing.
<br><br>
Zen packed up and left with Gant.
<br><br>
Cailen watched their receding figures. He was a little worried about Gant, but he dared not say anything in front of Zen.
<br><br>
After leaving the Su City, Zen and Gant decided to walk westward, along the Clear Lake.
<br><br>
Although much had happened in the competition this year, the gathering at the Ripple Pavilion pushed through, unaffected.
<br><br>
Throngs of people talked excitedly amongst themselves by the banks of the Clear Lake.
<br><br>
Many couldn't get over Zen's heroic stunt today. In their eyes, the battles between Zen and Marco, Zen and the three brothers were the highlight, despite many other battles not even having taken place yet.
<br><br>
"Flag Master, Trish is your maid, but she is too unruly," Gant complained.
<br><br>
"She should have come back when the Ripple Pavilion rally began, but she didn't," Gant huffed indignantly while trailing closely behind Zen.
<br><br>
The day after Zen arrived at the Su Clan's mansion, Trish asked if she could leave for a while. She had wanted to go back home; this was why she came to the Clear Lake with Zen.
<br><br>
However, she hadn't come back yet. Gant decided to take Zen to the YanZhao City to look for her.
<br><br>
In the Yan-Zhao City lived two big clans: the Yan Clan and the Zhao Clan.
<br><br>
However, over time, the Yan Clan grew weak, and gradually deteriorated.
<br><br>
Consequently, the Zhao Clan took full control of the city.
<br><br>
During this time of festivities, the Yan-Zhao City was brightly lit with colorful lanterns tied to the roofs of the buildings.
<br><br>
However, the cheery festivities ended at the northwest corner where a dilapidated house sat. This was the Yan Clan's ancestral home.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, from the backyard of the Yan Clan's house, Trish gritted her teeth as she tried to search for a way out.
<br><br>
She had promised to go back to the Su Clan's mansion today to meet Zen, but now she was trapped in her own house.
<br><br>
Many times she attempted to climb over the courtyard wall, but every time her fingers touched the bricks, a ray of dark, scarlet blood light would shoot at her. She turned a somersault and fell to the ground.
<br><br>
"Trish, just quit." A voice came from within the house. "This enchanted barrier was personally set up by the Zhao Clan. It's impossible to get out."
<br><br>
From the shadows, Trish's stepmother emerged.
<br><br>
"How could you treat me like this? I have given you many divine crystals!"
<br><br>
Trish spat with resentment.
<br><br>
Her stepmother shrugged. "To rebuild our clan, the divine crystals you earn are far from enough!" She smiled in a sinister manner. "If you marry into the Zhao Clan, they may help us."
<br><br>
"How can you possibly think that?! That's just wishful thinking! Lachlan is a playboy. I, I would rather die than marry him!" Trish said, unable to fight back the tears from streaming down her face. She had done so much for her family, but her stepmother was trying to force her to marry into the Zhao Clan! Her heart broke.
<br><br>
The Yan Clan had also been influential in the past. However, twenty years ago, the elders of the Yan Clan had all passed away. This left only a group of women and children to fend for themselves, with no one to rely on.
<br><br>
While their power declined over the years, the Zhao Clan's influence increased rapidly. Gradually, they took over the business of the Yan Clan, eventually taking over the whole city.
<br><br>
"Don't make things difficult for me," her stepmother replied unsympathetically. "Young Master Lachlan will come to pick you up tonight. You can't go anywhere else today." As she spoke, she heard the floorboards in the house creak with footsteps.
<br><br>
A man garbed in white emerged, followed by a few servants dressed in black.
<br><br>
"Young Master Lachlan, you're here! Is the Clear Lake bustling? Hee hee."
<br><br>
Trish's stepmother attempted to greet him with an ingratiating smile.
<br><br>
"Of course it's bustling," Lachlan said indifferently.
<br><br>
Lachlan wasn't an ambitious man. He wasn't strong enough to fight for the Zhao Clan at the gathering. Moreover, with the great accident that happened earlier today, the battles had come to a hasty end.
<br><br>
After the curt greetings, Trish's stepmother led Lachlan to the backyard, where Trish sat, seething.
<br><br>
Lachlan's eyes lit up the moment he saw Trish. With a grin, he said, "Trish! I haven't seen you in years. You grow more and more beautiful each time I see you. It seems that the Oneness Sky Palace treats you well."
<br><br>
He stepped forward and gently touched Trish's face.
<br><br>
Slap! Without a word, Trish had slapped his hand away, her eyes brimming with anger.
<br><br>
Lachlan looked back at Trish's stepmother with surprise. "Have you made everything clear to her?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I have told her everything," Trish's stepmother said, beaming. "Trish, don't worry! Young Master Lachlan will treat you well after you become his concubine."
<br><br>
"Listen," Trish said coldly, "I came back with my master this time. You can't afford to offend him. If..."
<br><br>
"Trish!" her stepmother sneered. "Do you really want to be a maid for the rest of your life?"
<br><br>
Lachlan frowned scornfully. "Your master is just a disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace. Do you really think he can beat my clansmen? Even if he were to visit me in my house, I wouldn't be afraid of him!"
<br><br>
He waved his hand with disdain and said, "Tie her up and take her back. I will teach her a lesson once we get back."
<br><br>
The servants gave a curt nod and then walked towards Trish.
<br><br>
Trish's eyes darted back and forth between the servants approaching her. In her desperation, she took a few steps back and leaned against the wall.
<br><br>
Suddenly, she felt her hand grow warm.
<br><br>
It felt as though a force was controlling her arm; as the first servant finally reached her, the next thing she knew was her hand suddenly flailed forward.
<br><br>
Slap! The servant in the front flew more than a hundred feet away at the impact of Trish's slap.
<br><br>
When the others saw this, they froze. Lachlan was also stunned. "Are you all cowards? Get her!"
<br><br>
The servants summoned up courage and rushed at Trish again, this time more fiercely determined.
<br><br>
Trish felt like a god was helping her. She lunged forward suddenly, her hands flailing uncontrollably. Yet, she managed to hit the servants square in the face, sending them flying.
<br><br>
Slap! Slap! Slap! Crisp slaps were heard one after another. After a while, all the servants lay unconscious on the ground.
<br><br>
Trish looked at her hands in shock.
<br><br>
Lachlan narrowed his eyes. He felt something strange, like an invisible force was running around the courtyard. "Who is it? Who is there? Get out!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3202 Making Trouble No one responded to Lachlan.
<br><br>
Trish and her stepmother also looked around the courtyard with puzzled looks.
<br><br>
"Who are you? How dare you cause me trouble in the Yan-Zhao City?"
<br><br>
Lachlan continued, raising his voice. "You must have a death wish!"
<br><br>
The whole Yan-Zhao City was under the rule of the Zhao Clan. Everyone, no matter how influential they were, had to show their respect to the Zhao Clan if they passed by the city. This would explain why Lachlan was so indignant.
<br><br>
"Show your..." Before he could finish his words, Trish let out a panicked scream.
<br><br>
Lachlan whipped his head around in time to see her rushing towards him at an inhuman speed. It was as though her entire body was enveloped in some invisible force. Before he had the time to react, Trish raised her hand and slapped him full in the face.
<br><br>
"How dare you!"
<br><br>
Slap! Slap! Slap! Trish couldn't stop her hands from slapping Lachlan's face.
<br><br>
With a grunt, her final slap sent him flying, crashing into a small room in the courtyard.
<br><br>
"Trish, are you crazy?!" her stepmother shouted hysterically.
<br><br>
Trish turned to face her. She raised her hand, about to slap her stepmother.
<br><br>
Her stepmother's eyes widened in fear and she immediately covered her face with her hands. She dared not say another word.
<br><br>
At this moment, two figures emerged.
<br><br>
Gingerly, they touched the enchanted barrier set up by the Zhao Clan.
<br><br>
Immediately, a ray of blood light shot at them.
<br><br>
Crack! With a flick of his hand, a light flashed from one of the figures, slicing through the blood light. In doing so, the barrier broke apart.
<br><br>
"Who, who are you? How dare you break into our house without permission?" Trish's stepmother said in a shaky voice, unable to contain her horror.
<br><br>
Lachlan climbed out of the ruins and his face changed when he saw the two people in the air.
<br><br>
Trish's face was full of joy and surprise as she walked up and bowed to Zen.
<br><br>
"Mr. Luo, I'm so sorry. I failed to return to the Su Clan today, because..."
<br><br>
"I know." Zen gently raised his hand to stop Trish from speaking any further. Turning to face her stepmother, Zen said coldly, "Trish is my maid, and I am taking her away today. Do you dare to defy this?"
<br><br>
Trish's stepmother was aware that she served a disciple from the Flow Sword Sect. Back when the Yan Clan was still influential, the Flow Sword Sect was unpopular and known to be weak. However, now, she trembled slightly at Zen's words.
<br><br>
"I don't dare!" she replied hastily. "It wasn't my idea to keep Trish here. It was the Zhao Clan's idea!" The woman immediately pointed a finger at Lachlan.
<br><br>
Zen didn't want to argue further with her, so he turned to look at Lachlan.
<br><br>
Lachlan was a mess. His face was red and swollen from the slaps, his clothes covered in rubble and dust. Yet, there was still a fierce look in his eyes. "She's right. Trish is mine. What do you want?"
<br><br>
Lachlan had also gone to the Ripple Pavilion with his clan members earlier that day, but he had no interest in the competition. Instead, as the giant drums gathered to form the battle ring, he decided to spend the afternoon with a whore. He hadn't heard about what happened till the competition came to an abrupt end.
<br><br>
"What do I want?" Zen blinked. "I want Trish. She's coming with me."
<br><br>
"Do you really think you can leave this city?" Lachlan said unflinchingly.
<br><br>
Then, he pulled out a jade pendant that hung from his waist. Without any hesitation, he crushed it in his hand.
<br><br>
Buzz! From the broken shards of the jade pendant, a green light flashed.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Trish's eyes widened in fear. "Mr. Luo, we'd better get going. If the people from Zhao Clan come over, I'm afraid you'll be in trouble."
<br><br>
Trish knew that Zen, an outstanding disciple of the Flow Sword Sect, might not be afraid of the Zhao Clan.
<br><br>
But this wasn't the Oneness Sky Palace. There were some notably strong people in the Zhao Clan. If Zen insisted on staying, she was afraid he'd get hurt, which was the last thing she wanted to see.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter," Zen said indifferently.
<br><br>
Lachlan sneered at Zen's calm face.
<br><br>
The Zhao Clan had been doing business by the Clear Lake for many years.
<br><br>
Every year, they offered a lot of magic pills to the Oneness Sky Palace and had a very good relationship with the palace. Lachlan, in his haughtiness, thought he could punish any disciple of the palace without much consequence.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! In a matter of seconds, a dozen figures swept across the sky above the Yan Clan's house. In the blink of an eye, they landed in the small courtyard, each figure equally menacing.
<br><br>
One of the figures stood out among the rest. It was the leader of the Zhao Clan.
<br><br>
"Father!"
<br><br>
Lachlan beamed at the sight of his father, and he confidently glared at Zen.
<br><br>
"This brat has made trouble here," he said arrogantly. "He doesn't take our clan seriously!"
<br><br>
The master of the Zhao Clan strode forward, surveying the damage: the fallen servants and the destroyed walls. But when his eyes landed on Zen, he gasped in shock.
<br><br>
He immediately recognized that Zen was the one who ruined the competition at the Ripple Pavilion.
<br><br>
Moreover, this was the guy who had killed a direct descendant of the Vastness Mountain effortlessly.
<br><br>
With a shake of his head, he wondered inwardly, 'What did Lachlan do to piss this man off?' "Father," Lachlan echoed. "What're you waiting for? Arrest this guy and punish him severely. Otherwise the other people may think we're weak and incompetent..."
<br><br>
Slap! The master of the Zhao Clan slapped his son's face, much harder than Trish had.
<br><br>
Lachlan rubbed his temples as his thoughts swirled dizzily. Once he came back to his senses, his mouth fell in shock. His father was bowing deeply to Zen in respect! That was the highest honor.
<br><br>
Only grandsons would bow to their grandfathers in this way.
<br><br>
But this was Lachlan's father, the lord of the Yan-Zhao City and the master of the Zhao Clan! How could he do this to a mere disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace? Lachlan was totally confused.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry that I didn't teach my son well," the master said cautiously. "Mr.
<br><br>
Luo, please forgive him."
<br><br>
The master of the Zhao Clan was well aware that Zen had just defeated notable warriors earlier that day; if he stirred conflict now, it might ruin the reputation of the Zhao Clan.
<br><br>
Moreover, he also knew his third son well. He knew that Lachlan was in the wrong without having to ask what happened.
<br><br>
Zen cast a cold glance at the master of the Zhao Clan. "I don't want to get involved in the affairs between the Yan Clan and the Zhao Clan. This is your son's fault; he should never have offended Trish."
<br><br>
"Lachlan!" the master cried angrily. "Come here! Kneel down!"
<br><br>
Lachlan turned livid with rage. His father had never been so strict with him.
<br><br>
He walked over reluctantly, but refused to kneel. Mumbling, he said, "She's just a maid! A maid..."
<br><br>
"I said kneel down!" The master of the Zhao Clan raised his voice.
<br><br>
Lachlan finally flopped down on his knees in front of Zen. The master of the Zhao Clan said, "Mr. Luo, my good-for-nothing son is at your disposal!"
<br><br>
Zen waved his hand indifferently. "Break his legs and arms. Don't treat him in a year."
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, the master of the Zhao Clan flicked his wrist violently. Instantly, invisible forces rushed at Lachlan.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! With a terrible shriek, Lachlan collapsed to the floor, his arms and legs horribly disfigured.
<br><br>
"Let's go," Zen said expressionlessly. Before he turned to leave with Trish and Gant, he suddenly said, "Trish is my maid." Narrowing his eyes, he continued ominously, "I don't want her family to decline."
<br><br>
The master of the Zhao Clan broke out in a cold sweat, a chill running down his spine.
<br><br>
Chapter 3203 Invitation To The Mountain The Yan Clan's decline had something to do with the Zhao Clan.
<br><br>
The master of the Zhao Clan knew full well.
<br><br>
If Zen looked any further into it, it would probably only cause more trouble.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Trish was just his maid, and he said he didn't want to get involved in this.
<br><br>
When the master of the Zhao Clan finally calmed himself down, he heard Lachlan scream, "Father! Some pills for my wounds! It really hurts! Who is that guy? Is he the son of the head of the Oneness Sky Palace? Father, why were you so respectful towards him?"
<br><br>
Lachlan lay on the ground in pain.
<br><br>
He knew he had offended someone he shouldn't have; his father was just putting on a show and trying to prove a point.
<br><br>
His arms and legs being broken was no big deal. The pills of the Zhao Clan would heal him up in an instant.
<br><br>
But his father still refused him the pills, and only continued to drive his foot into him again and again.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! The kicks almost killed him. His father yelled furiously, "You bastard! You almost got us all killed! You want the pills? Forget it! You will stay on the ground this year! If anyone dares to heal you, I'll break their arms and legs as well!"
<br><br>
The master of the Zhao Clan left with his people in tow.
<br><br>
Trish's stepmother was trembling in a corner. Until now, she still didn't understand what had happened, but she vaguely knew that Trish's master was a somebody, and that 'somebody' had made a statement that the Zhao Clan could no longer make life hard for the Yan Clan.
<br><br>
On the flying ship, Zen sat upright at the front end.
<br><br>
Trish contemplated a while before finding the courage to walk up to Zen.
<br><br>
She walked up silently and unassumingly, and bowed to him.
<br><br>
"There's no need to be so courteous," Zen said with a friendly smile.
<br><br>
"I'm just your maid, yet you care so much for me," Trish said meekly.
<br><br>
The fate of the Yan Clan had always been controlled by the Zhao Clan.
<br><br>
If things went on like this, 'Yan' would be removed from the city name sooner or later, and the city would be renamed the Zhao City.
<br><br>
But Zen's warning was surely enough to scare off the master of the Zhao Clan.
<br><br>
"It's no big deal. Don't think on it too much," Zen said, smiling tenderly.
<br><br>
Trish smiled too. She paused a moment before she spoke again, "There's one more thing. The master of the Zhao Clan is a powerful and influential man. Why is he so afraid of you?"
<br><br>
Even if Zen was an outstanding disciple of the Flow Sword Sect, he was still not strong enough to intimidate a clan living by the Clear Lake.
<br><br>
"It's because today, Flag Master killed Marco, as well as his strong followers," Gant explained with a wry smile.
<br><br>
Trish's eyes widened.
<br><br>
"Are you afraid? If you are afraid, you're free to leave," Gant said, toying with her still.
<br><br>
Offending the direct line of the Oneness Sky Palace would bring quite serious trouble to whoever dared do such a thing. Zen, however, didn't just offend them. He killed one of them! Noticing Trish's shock and stillness, Gant continued to threaten her playfully, "There's probably going to be something disastrous waiting for us when we return to the Oneness Sky Palace. And I'm afraid those of us who work for Flag Master Zen are likely to be put under fire too."
<br><br>
After a moment of panic, Trish managed to compose herself. She stood up straight, tightened her jaw and said, "I'm not afraid of anything. At the worst, I will die with Mr. Luo!"
<br><br>
Seeing she was taking Gant's words seriously, Zen smiled and said, "Don't listen to Gant. I know what I'm doing."
<br><br>
Truthfully, he wasn't too sure what he was doing.
<br><br>
In his current position, he really couldn't afford to offend the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
All depended on Marco's status in the Xu Clan on the Vastness Mountain. If Marco really was very important, it was possible that even Athemar would not be able to simmer the anger of the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
But Zen had an important bargaining chip, and that was the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.
<br><br>
He firmly believed that the Truth Enlightenment could solve all problems.
<br><br>
Half a day later, the three stepped into the transmission array.
<br><br>
It was already early morning when they returned to Dragon City.
<br><br>
The dark starry sky began to fade and brighten.
<br><br>
Zen didn't go directly up the mountain but instead left the Dragon City with Gant and Trish.
<br><br>
Monica had completely adapted to her role.
<br><br>
Amongst the Alliance Chiefs, she was the weakest, but none of them dared to disobey or ignore her.
<br><br>
Zen gave her enough divine crystals to keep the operation of her alliance running.
<br><br>
She had more and more Flag Masters join her and more than ten thousand people at her command, making her alliance the largest outside the Dragon City.
<br><br>
When Zen arrived, Monica appeared pleasantly surprised and noticeably uneasy at the same time.
<br><br>
The disciples from the Sword Light Palace, including Beldene, Elgin and Kenelm, had also come when they heard the news. It had been a long time since they had seen Zen last time.
<br><br>
"Zen... Alliance Chief... Flag Master..." Kenelm stammered as he ran over.
<br><br>
He had called him all these things at one point or another. Now that Zen had gone up the mountain, he didn't know what to call him.
<br><br>
"Just call him Flag Master!"
<br><br>
"Right. He will always be our Flag Master."
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Jago and the others giggled casually.
<br><br>
Zen glanced around and asked curiously, "Why don't I see Nelly, Lavender and Laquisha?"
<br><br>
Monica appeared distressed by hearing their names. She spoke solemnly to Zen, "I have something to tell you. A few days ago, I asked someone to go to the mountain to look for you, but you weren't there."
<br><br>
"What happened? Where are they?" Zen asked, his concern growing with every word.
<br><br>
Zen had won first place in the Seven Mountains Meeting and offended many people. No one had come after him as blatantly as Marco. Perhaps they would use some dirty tricks to get back at him.
<br><br>
If anyone hurt his family...
<br><br>
At the thought of this, Zen's face darkened.
<br><br>
"They have gone up the mountain," Monica said. "Elder Sellers from the Dragon City said the Oneness Sky Palace had sent out an invitation. They said that the three of them had outstanding talent and they wanted to meet them."
<br><br>
"I know them. They would not agree to something like that," Zen said affirmatively.
<br><br>
Laquisha and Lavender would definitely ask for Zen's opinion if they wanted to join a sword sect on the mountain.
<br><br>
They wouldn't go up the mountain without telling him.
<br><br>
"You're right. They didn't agree, but someone from the mountain took them away. Someone forced them. I'm sorry..." Monica said full of remorse.
<br><br>
Zen trusted Monica and felt safe leaving his three wives with her. Her heart was filled with great sorrow and guilt as she had failed him. The last few days had been hell for her trying to figure out how she would break it to him.
<br><br>
"Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault," Zen comforted Monica.
<br><br>
No matter how strong Monica was, she was only an Alliance Chief of the Dragon City. The people on the mountain didn't even take the Oneness Guards seriously. It was simply impossible for Monica to have stopped them.
<br><br>
After staying outside the Dragon City for a while, Zen ordered Trish to go up the mountain by herself. Then, he went into the Dragon City and headed straight to the Sword Tower.
<br><br>
Now that Sellers was involved, he seemed to know exactly what was going on.
<br><br>
Chapter 3204 The Phoenix Palace In the Sword Tower, Sellers saw Zen rush in. The mask he had on was only barely concealing the helpless smile underneath.
<br><br>
"Master Sellers! I just came back to Dragon City. I heard that Nelly, Laquisha and Lavender had been taken away. Which sect did they join?"
<br><br>
Zen asked.
<br><br>
Usually, the warriors in the Dragon City who had gone up the mountain would join the Flow Sword Sect, the Killing Sword Sect or the Unique Array Sword Sect.
<br><br>
But sometimes, the other six mountains would choose the disciples in the Dragon City too.
<br><br>
"They didn't join any," Sellers said with a light shake of his head.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen frowned. He figured they must have been under house arrest instead.
<br><br>
Was it the Vastness Mountain disciples who had taken them away? Zen's brows furrowed deeper. Suddenly, he felt the urge to kill flow through his veins.
<br><br>
"Someone from the Phoenix Palace took them away," Sellers said. "Did you do anything to offend them?"
<br><br>
The Phoenix Palace was the core of the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
The palace only trained and recruited disciples who were in the direct line of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Lavender, Nelly, and Laquisha were talented, but none of them were qualified to enter the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Their sudden kidnapping to the Phoenix Palace was odd. Sellers figured that Zen must have had something to do with it.
<br><br>
"Me? Offend the Phoenix Palace?" Zen rubbed his chin as he tried to recall.
<br><br>
Then, a trace of cold light flashed through his eyes. "Elvinia!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
Sellers gasped. "What did you do to offend her?" he asked.
<br><br>
Not every descendant of Eastern Emperor Taiyi held a high status, but Elvinia was highly favored.
<br><br>
Sellers tried to stop the Phoenix Palace from taking away Zen's women, but he was threatened by a powerful warrior from the palace. He wondered whom Zen had offended to lead to this.
<br><br>
Finally, Sellers gained clarity.
<br><br>
"Humph!" Zen snorted. "It was nothing. We just had some conflict in the Seven Mountains Meeting."
<br><br>
Whatever happened between them, Zen found it unreasonable that Elvinia would involve the three women just to deal with him. It was a low blow in his standards.
<br><br>
"Where is the Phoenix Palace? Master Sellers, can you take me there?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"What are you planning to do?" Sellers asked him. "Take them back?"
<br><br>
"Yes, exactly," Zen confirmed.
<br><br>
He was afraid of what Elvinia would do to his women. He didn't want to waste any more time.
<br><br>
"The Phoenix Palace is located at the back of the Oneness Mountain. It's surrounded by the Primitive Illusion. It's not an easy place to go to. I've never been there," Sellers said.
<br><br>
As if ignoring what he had said, Zen rushed out of the Sword Tower.
<br><br>
"Zen! It's not easy to penetrate the Primitive Illusion. Not even brute force would work! Please, think about what you're about to do!" Sellers desperately wanted to stop Zen, but without success.
<br><br>
Zen knew his way up the mountain.
<br><br>
Halfway through the mountain, he decided to abandon his route. Instead, he flew towards the other side.
<br><br>
The sword arrays on the Oneness Mountain were usually inactive, so it was not dangerous for Zen to fly along the mountain. The mountain was huge.
<br><br>
Its three peaks were occupied by different sects, namely: Flow Sword Sect, Killing Sword Sect, and Unique Array Sword Sect.
<br><br>
And the Phoenix Palace occupied the back of the mountain.
<br><br>
But few disciples were able to see the palace.
<br><br>
From above, that area was covered with white fog called the Primitive Illusion. It was a mirage that protected the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
After flying for a while, Zen was finally seeing the fog below him.
<br><br>
He smiled with satisfaction.
<br><br>
Seeing the impenetrable fog, however, he almost retreated. But the mere memory of his women motivated him to land without hesitation.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The thick fog hung in the air and blocked his line of sight. He could barely see the outlines of the trees that surrounded him.
<br><br>
"Spiritual sense..."
<br><br>
Zen blinked several times until a strand of his spiritual sense began to spread out.
<br><br>
However, as soon as it was out of his system, it disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
"Did the fog swallow my spiritual sense?" Zen was slightly shocked.
<br><br>
He was walking aimlessly without his spiritual sense and eyesight. He didn't even know where the Phoenix Palace was exactly located.
<br><br>
Whoosh! His feet kicked the ground and his body jumped up. He rapidly shuttled through the fog.
<br><br>
He flew fast, but this did not help him. The fog kept on drifting and covering everything in front of him.
<br><br>
Zen halted and gave his next steps some thought. He opened his right eye and a flash of white light appeared.
<br><br>
"The Authentic Visual World!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, his surroundings became clearer.
<br><br>
It was still covered with fog. Not even his demonic eye could see through it.
<br><br>
But, through the fog, he was able to outline a long and thin black figure in the distance. He proceeded towards its direction.
<br><br>
A few moments later, he was finally standing in front of it. It was a pillar similar to the ones in a royal palace. However, it looked tattered and disheveled, as if it had been there for a while.
<br><br>
Zen stepped closer to approach the pillar when, suddenly, another thin black shadow caught his right eye.
<br><br>
"Are these pillars leading the way to the Phoenix Palace?" Zen muttered to himself.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen flashed swiftly toward the second pillar. As he neared it, a third one appeared not too far away.
<br><br>
Zen's guess was correct.
<br><br>
To protect the Phoenix Palace, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had arranged the Primitive Illusion.
<br><br>
It was designed with the eighteen pillars passed down from the Primitive Temple. The pillars were almost invincible. No normal method worked against them.
<br><br>
Gratefully, they were free of wars and major conflicts now, and so the Primitive Illusion wasn't fully activated.
<br><br>
Servants, maids and guards needed to go up and down the mountain. They carried with them a special token that allowed them to see the pillars and go as they pleased.
<br><br>
Zen didn't need the special token to see the pillars. He was able to see them with his demonic eye.
<br><br>
He continued to follow the pillars upwards. Finally, he saw a huge palace gate with a plaque that said, "Phoenix Palace."
<br><br>
"Here it is!"
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, Zen went up and knocked on the palace gate.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Obviously, the Phoenix Palace did not receive plenty of visitors. The few distinguished guests usually had their own ushers.
<br><br>
No one in recent history had done what Zen did. No one just climbed up the mountain, navigated the fog, and knocked at the palace gate.
<br><br>
So, when they heard the loud banging on the gate, the golden-armored guards of the Phoenix Palace were taken aback. They looked among themselves, wondering who it could be.
<br><br>
Chapter 3205 Lady Flamine From atop the wall, the golden-armored guards watched Zen knocking at the gate. Exchanging dubious glances, they started whispering amongst themselves in wonder.
<br><br>
"This man isn't a servant of the Phoenix Palace. How could he have walked out of the Primitive Illusion?"
<br><br>
Finally, the leading guard called Zen's attention. "Who are you?" he shouted with a frown. "Why do you knock on the gate?"
<br><br>
Zen, looking up to face the guard, answered clearly, "I'm Zen Luo, a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect. I'm looking for Elvinia."
<br><br>
"A disciples of the Flow Sword Sect?"
<br><br>
The guards exchanged puzzled glances.
<br><br>
Their leader continued to speak to Zen harshly. "I don't care which sect you are from. You are not welcome here. Get out!"
<br><br>
The Phoenix Palace was where the direct descendants of East Emperor Taiyi lived. Additionally, it was the core area of the Oneness Mountain. It was impossible for ordinary people to enter.
<br><br>
Zen's expression darkened as his patience ran thin. He leapt forward, and ricocheted off the wall, launching himself into the air. With a determined look on his face, he decided right then and there that he was going to break through the gate.
<br><br>
Once the leading guard realized what he was up to, he sneered haughtily, "Never in my years here have I witnessed anyone attempt to break into the Phoenix Palace. Sir, you are courting death; don't blame me for killing you."
<br><br>
Bang! Eyes flashing menacingly, he then channeled his aura to summon a large golden shield, which smashed towards Zen.
<br><br>
The leader had been a five-star Oneness Guard. Due to his excellence, he was transferred to guard the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
While the technique he used was relatively simple, the sheer force of the shield attack reached eight hundred divine megatons.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed as he observed the approaching shield. With gritted teeth, he summoned the strength from the Strength God Totem, while simultaneously gathering the Shade Stone's liquid into his right hand.
<br><br>
Bang! The other guards covered their ears in anguish at the deafening sound, lights flashing everywhere, which blinded them. When they finally regained their senses, they were stunned.
<br><br>
Their leader had been flung off the wall, and had fallen into the square of the Phoenix Palace. The impact was so great that a crater was formed where he landed.
<br><br>
Zen, on the other hand, stood firmly on the wall, unscathed.
<br><br>
The guards shuffled backwards uneasily, maintaining a distance from Zen.
<br><br>
"Where is Elvinia?" Zen demanded once more, staring at the guards coldly.
<br><br>
Although they trembled underneath their golden-plated armor, all the guards shook their heads in defiance.
<br><br>
They knew their responsibility was to protect the Phoenix Palace; even if Zen terrified them, they stood their ground.
<br><br>
Crack! Zen moved forward in a flash. In the blink of an eye, his hand was on the neck of one of the guards. With a restrained squeeze, he shouted, "Tell me.
<br><br>
Now!"
<br><br>
"I...I..." The guard was frozen in fear.
<br><br>
At this moment, a clear voice came from inside the palace.
<br><br>
"A mere disciple of the Flow Sword Sect dares to act wildly in the Phoenix Palace. Why do you think of us so lowly?"
<br><br>
As the cool voice floated over, a purple ribbon snaked its way across the palace square, heading straight for Zen.
<br><br>
The purple ribbon, like a nimble dragon, shot towards Zen in a zigzag motion.
<br><br>
Zen threw the guard aside to reach out and grab the ribbon. However, as soon as his fingers grazed the silken ribbon, it split into two, then four, until they coiled around his body.
<br><br>
As the ribbons intertwined around Zen, he felt a terrifying power. The ribbons tightened their grip on him.
<br><br>
The pressure was not something that Zen could withstand. Not long after, he found it difficult to breathe.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen was yanked forward by the ribbons, as though he was a mere puppet. It all happened so fast; his surroundings seemed to whip past him. He could barely make out being dragged through several palace gates, over gardens and courtyards.
<br><br>
Bang! Finally, Zen smashed into the front door of one of the palaces.
<br><br>
A woman garbed in purple stood not far away with crossed arms. Her fierce eyes studied the helpless figure before her, wrapped in purple ribbons.
<br><br>
The woman stepped forward gracefully. Zen noticed she had a pretty face.
<br><br>
She was captivating at first glance.
<br><br>
However, that didn't stop him from trying to wriggle his way out of the ribbons.
<br><br>
No matter how much he twisted and struggled, he was unable to get rid of the seemingly ordinary ribbons.
<br><br>
The woman was a little surprised. "You haven't gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, and yet your power is so extraordinary."
<br><br>
Normal human bodies could withstand three hundred divine megatons of Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
Some strong-built humans could withstand six hundred divine megatons of Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
For example, Marco's Other Shore Token, which could absorb his opponent's Other Shore Power, had the potential to unleash the force of five hundred divine megatons. Although he could only bear the force of three hundred divine megatons, the other two hundred divine megatons of force would be borne by his sword.
<br><br>
As Zen struggled, he also released a force of more than a thousand divine megatons. This would've been impressive for nonhuman creatures, all the more for humans! After struggling for a while, Zen finally stopped. He twisted his body one more time, to face the beautiful woman wordlessly.
<br><br>
By this time, the guards had rushed over, kneeling before the lady. Even the leader knelt humbly. "This person trespassed into the Phoenix Palace under my watch. We failed to stop him. Please, Lady Flamine, punish me."
<br><br>
Flamine gave them an amused smile. She showed no traces of anger whatsoever. With an elegant wave of her hand, she said, "It's no big deal.
<br><br>
You can leave now."
<br><br>
"Yes, Lady Flamine!"
<br><br>
The leader stood up with a salute. Turning to the other guards, he gestured for them to take the subdued Zen with them.
<br><br>
Flamine, however, stopped him. "Let him stay."
<br><br>
"But this person trespassed into the Phoenix Palace. He needs to be punished severely!" the leader cried indignantly. As a five-star Oneness Guard, it was humiliating for him to have been sent flying by a Flow Sword Sect disciple's punch.
<br><br>
"Let him stay. I need to talk to him," said Flamine firmly.
<br><br>
"Yes, Lady Flamine!"
<br><br>
The guards could do nothing but bow humbly to the woman and take their leave.
<br><br>
If Zen was just an ordinary disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, Flamine would have let the guards take him away.
<br><br>
However, she could sense Zen's extraordinary power. This definitely piqued her interest.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Flamine withdrew her ribbons, freeing Zen from his shackles.
<br><br>
"Why did you break into the Phoenix Palace, young man?" Flamine asked, eyes sparkling with curiosity.
<br><br>
Rubbing his hands and neck, he answered calmly, "I'm looking for Elvinia."
<br><br>
"Elvinia?" Flamine raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Why are you looking for her?"
<br><br>
"She took my people away," Zen answered bluntly.
<br><br>
Scratching her chin delicately, she asked, "Why did she take your people away?"
<br><br>
"God knows what that stupid woman was thinking!" he cried exasperatedly.
<br><br>
"Maybe since she lost to me in the Seven Mountains Meeting, she has been holding a grudge towards me." Zen shook his head in frustration.
<br><br>
When Flamine heard Zen cursing Elvinia, her cheeks flushed red with embarrassment. "I can take you to see her."
<br><br>
"You can help me find her?" Zen's eyes lit up at her offer.
<br><br>
"Of course. If what you say is true, I must make her apologize. After all, I'm her mother." She smiled cunningly.
<br><br>
Zen was stunned. He recalled how Konnor told him that Elvinia had been brought back from the Divine Lair. Did this mean Flamine was also a nonhuman creature from the Divine Lair? Chapter 3206 The Stone Statue The demon women from the Divine Lair of the Sun Crow race all had a pair of huge sprawling wings.
<br><br>
Flamine and Elvinia were as beautiful as those demon women, but they didn't have wings.
<br><br>
This sudden encounter with Elvinia's mother had made Zen uncomfortable and was creating a little trouble for him.
<br><br>
Looking at a stunned Zen, Flamine calmly instructed, "Follow me. I'll take you there."
<br><br>
She entered through the palace gate as she spoke, gliding with graceful steps and dragging purple ribbons behind her.
<br><br>
Zen hesitated a moment before deciding to follow her in.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had many children, and the Phoenix Palace was quite large and magnificent.
<br><br>
They came across very few people as they walked. Any guards and maids they saw knelt and saluted Flamine respectfully.
<br><br>
They walked along a tall red wall for some minutes when Zen turned and was faced with a gigantic palace gate. Just before it stood a triangular bronze furnace. In it, flames flickered and jet out in spurts and a faint golden light glowed from within.
<br><br>
"This is the divine flame of the Sun Crow race," Zen pointed out in surprise, raising his eyebrows slightly.
<br><br>
Flamine walked just ahead of Zen, but she was stunned when she heard him and turned back to look at him. "You know the flame?"
<br><br>
"I have been to the Mountain Viewing Province. There I saw... I saw the demon women and such flames," Zen said.
<br><br>
He had intended to tell her he had seen Elizabeth then. But after considering the link between Flamine and Elvinia and the Divine Lair, he changed his mind, afraid that Flamine would ask many questions.
<br><br>
Flamine pointed lightly at the bronze furnace. A divine flame flew from the furnace, turning into a small fire bird and rushing to Flamine. It then stopped when it reached her and settled itself on her sleeve.
<br><br>
Zen didn't know what material her beautiful purple dress was made of but she clearly was not afraid of the burning of the divine flame.
<br><br>
The fire bird stayed in her hand for a short while and then snapped into a wisp of flame. It hissed and entered her mouth horrifyingly. Flamine had swallowed the divine flame! She spoke as she swallowed, "The Sun Crow race was born in the divine flames, and their blood power is hidden in them. Even the demon women born in the Divine Lair can't live without the divine flames."
<br><br>
She had just admitted she was a nonhuman creature from the Divine Lair.
<br><br>
It seemed that the bronze furnace was there to produce endless divine flames for her and Elvinia to devour as they required.
<br><br>
After absorbing the divine flame, she stepped through the huge palace gate, followed by Zen.
<br><br>
As soon as they entered the palace gate, two maids dressed in blue hurriedly came to them.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine," the maids in blue greeted, kowtowing to Flamine.
<br><br>
"Is Elvinia in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace?" asked Flamine.
<br><br>
"Yes, she is," one of the maids in blue answered respectfully.
<br><br>
"Take me to her," commanded Flamine.
<br><br>
"Yes, Lady Flamine."
<br><br>
The two maids in blue led the way dutifully.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Cultivation Palace was a place for cultivation in the Phoenix Palace. Along the way, there were four tall towers and some other large buildings, from which a strong energy could be felt emitting.
<br><br>
A short while later, the maids had brought them to the Fire Bearing Hall in the innermost circle of the palace.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, please wait here. I'll let Princess Elvinia know you are here." The maid in blue kowtowed to Flamine once more before scurrying into the Fire Bearing Hall.
<br><br>
Zen was growing impatient. The Phoenix Palace was like the royal palace of the divine kingdom. There were too many formalities.
<br><br>
Luckily, Zen didn't have to wait much more.
<br><br>
Before long, Elvinia appeared at the gate of the Fire Bearing Hall. "Mother, what can I do for you?" she asked exacerbating and impatient.
<br><br>
Flamine smiled and said, "Nothing for me, but Mr. Luo wants to see you."
<br><br>
"Who is Mr. Luo?"
<br><br>
Elvinia raised her head and saw Zen standing close by. A fierce look flashed in her eyes.
<br><br>
As the direct descendant of the Oneness Mountain, she was fate's favored one. Her parents spoiled her very much, and she was regarded quite highly among her peers.
<br><br>
Even her brothers and sisters didn't dare to cross her.
<br><br>
She lost to Zen at the Seven Mountains Meeting, and even worse, he humiliated her to her face. This enraged her massively and she could not let it go.
<br><br>
"Look at you," she said with condescending surprise. "You actually came right to the Phoenix Palace. Who brought you here, Athemar or Goran?"
<br><br>
Elvinia sneered, one eyebrow raised.
<br><br>
Zen's face darkened with anger as he barked, "It doesn't matter how I got in.
<br><br>
Where are Nelly, Laquisha and Lavender? I will get them back!"
<br><br>
He had no idea as to where they were or whether they were safe or not. He'd been worrying about them all this time and all the way here.
<br><br>
A triumphant smile graced Elvinia's frigid face as she saw the concern drawn across Zen's face. "They are enduring the Soul Fire Swirl, so I will not give them to you. If you want them back, you have to go through me first!"
<br><br>
Zen had no idea what the Soul Fire Swirl was. But it sounded to him like a cruel punishment.
<br><br>
Rage burned from his heart throughout his entire being.
<br><br>
Bang! He kicked off the ground and was gone in a flash, rushing at Elvinia in complete disregard of Flamine.
<br><br>
Flamine was close enough to have stopped Zen if she wanted. But she saw the expressions on her daughter's face before she moved and decided to just stand aside and let this be.
<br><br>
Elvinia laughed scornfully at Zen charging at her. "I may have lost to you at the Seven Mountains Meeting, but that was not a competition of real strength. You just took advantage of the Truth Enlightenment. Do you really think you're powerful enough for this?"
<br><br>
Zen's hand was already moving at breakneck speed to grab her when she was done speaking.
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyes overflowed with hatred in the face of Zen's grab. She stretched out her hand and gave it a gentle wave.
<br><br>
Thanks to her unique body, her slender hand was able to unleash three to four hundred divine megatons of force. Even Marco and Konnor couldn't withstand this gentle wave.
<br><br>
But when she touched Zen's arm, the color disappeared from her face. She realized immediately that she had got it all wrong.
<br><br>
It seemed as if Zen's right hand was made of fine steel, and the power that he unleashed was beyond her imagination. He grabbed her, swung his arm over his head, and slammed her into the ground behind him.
<br><br>
Bang! The floor was cracked and near destroyed from the impact.
<br><br>
Elvinia appeared almost buried.
<br><br>
If it were Marco who had been thrown, he would have been seriously hurt if not dead. However, there were indistinct fire textures on the surface of Elvinia's body, and she appeared unharmed.
<br><br>
"Tell me! Where are they?"
<br><br>
Zen snarled mercilessly.
<br><br>
If Elvinia didn't tell him the whereabouts of his wives, he would kill her right in front of her mother.
<br><br>
Lying on the ground, Elvinia opened her eyes wide as she looked at Zen.
<br><br>
She could not believe how Zen treated her. She had never been treated this way in her life.
<br><br>
She snapped back to reality and her irritation returned with her.
<br><br>
She raised her head and sniggered, "As I said, if you want to know their whereabouts, defeat me first."
<br><br>
As she finished speaking, two golden lights suddenly materialized in her hands.
<br><br>
A golden sun appeared in her right hand, and a golden moon appeared in her left.
<br><br>
She closed her eyes and slapped both hands into the ground firmly.
<br><br>
Buzz! A huge stone statue had appeared before Zen.
<br><br>
The stone statue had a strange shape. It had sixteen arms in total, and fifteen of them were on its left side. There was only one on the right.
<br><br>
The moment it appeared, it thrust its only right arm at Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3207 Warrior Of The Stone Hill The stone statue's right hand was so frighteningly powerful that the space in front of Zen bent out of shape.
<br><br>
"Bang!" Zen was knocked back for dozens of feet from the massive force.
<br><br>
Splash! It looked as though he was wiping the ground with his entire body as he continued to be swept away from the impact, leaving a ditch in front of him before he finally crashed into a huge building.
<br><br>
The building was called the Sword Bearing Hall. It was a dwelling built explicitly for the direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace to cultivate sword skills.
<br><br>
The unfortunate events caused an imperfection in the form of a large hole on the wall of the Sword Bearing Hall! "What just happened?"
<br><br>
"Who dares to fight in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace?"
<br><br>
"I think it's Elvinia."
<br><br>
Apparently, the commotion happening outside had distracted the direct descendants from practicing in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.
<br><br>
Most of them paused their practice to come out and make sense of what they just heard. As a result, their jaws dropped to the floor when their eyes fell on the broken wall, and the tiles piled up on the ground.
<br><br>
Elvinia scoffed at the ruins and rolled her eyes indifferently. She had full faith Zen wouldn't get back up from that attack. If anything, she thought he was dead.
<br><br>
Not wanting to say a word till she saw it for herself, Lady Flamine remained quiet and kept her gaze fixed at the ruins. A few seconds after, she noticed something that made her gasp.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Minor turbulence could be seen coming from the pile of tiles as they shook noticeably. A huge boulder about ten feet wide was flipped over by a black hand as a black figure emerged from the ruins.
<br><br>
Curious at the sudden appearance of a man cloaked with black substance around his body, Elvinia squinted her eyes to focus on his direction. She was shocked to see it was Zen, who now wiped the debris off his shoulders and cracked his knuckles as if unfazed by her move.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token she possessed was called the Warrior of the Stone Hill.
<br><br>
The Stone Hill race had deep ancient roots.
<br><br>
Similar to the legendary "Stone God," they would grow in the form of rocks. When they'd reach the age they matured in, they would emerge from the rocks.
<br><br>
The strong warriors from that race were called the Warriors of the Stone Hill.
<br><br>
In search of this Other Shore Token, the Oneness Sky Palace had dug out an entire mountain in Stage Thirteen. It took them several decades to do so.
<br><br>
It was a descending type of Other Shore Token, which was extremely powerful because it had the potential to evolve further. The "Warrior of the Stone Hill" could further upgrade itself to the "Saint of the Stone Hill." The day it happened, the power of it would multiply by dozens! To attain that ascension in power, Elvinia had to get to the Stone Hill Temple on Stage Twenty-two. However, she had a ways to go yet.
<br><br>
Even with the current level of her Other Shore Token, Elvinia's single attack had exceeded 600 divine megatons of force! That kind of power was way beyond her physical strength, so it was borne by the Other Shore Token itself. How come Zen resisted an attack of that intensity and took no damage? The black layer of Shade Stone cloaking Zen's body began to dissipate from his skin, and permeated into his bones from his pores. Once it disappeared completely, Zen regained his usual appearance.
<br><br>
He never imagined Elvinia would play so rough and prove to be a nuisance.
<br><br>
What more could he expect from a direct descendant like her! Even so, Zen did not intend to stand down from this fight.
<br><br>
He could compromise on many things without caring about them, but letting his women bear the pain for him wasn't one of them.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Securely gripping the Snow Sword in his hands, he pointed the end in her direction as if to challenge her. Swiftly, he took one step back to gain momentum and pushed himself forward, he dashed towards Elvinia once more.
<br><br>
The mysterious movements of the Snow Sword made it tough to foretell the direction of the attack. When Zen got halfway through to her, the sword's actions became as fast as lightning. They were hard to be seen through the naked eye.
<br><br>
"Nine-Flash Light-splitting!"
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The sword morphed itself into dazzling flashes of light that all shot towards Elvinia vengefully from all directions.
<br><br>
"Pathetic!"
<br><br>
Elvinia spited at him as she raised her hand and shook it slightly.
<br><br>
She opened up a space ring, from which long swords shot out one after the other.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! With its fifteen left hands outstretched, the Warrior of the Stone Hill reached out and grabbed those long swords coming from the space ring.
<br><br>
Now armed with fifteen long swords in its fifteen hands, Elvinia's Other Shore Token looked more frightening than ever.
<br><br>
"Slash at him now!"
<br><br>
Elvinia pointed towards the light shooting through Zen's sword and commanded her Other Shore Token dominantly.
<br><br>
At her wish, the fifteen armed hands slashed vigorously at Zen in frantic movements. They moved swiftly and even overlapped with each other, but there was not a single collision between them. Each attack had precision and accuracy! From their rapid continuous movements, the swords formed a silver shield to deflect any attack and keep Elvinia out of harm's way.
<br><br>
"Cling! Cling! Cling!"
<br><br>
Even though Zen's Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship was formidable, it still failed to break through the silver curtain that protected her.
<br><br>
Even so, he had no plans on backing down, as the speed of the sword in his hands grew gradually. It became faster and faster! "Oh my god! The swords are moving too fast!"
<br><br>
"I can't believe Elvinia has progressed again!"
<br><br>
"Who is this guy, and why is he challenging someone like Elvinia? He doesn't seem to be like one of us."
<br><br>
The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace discussed among themselves without keeping their eyes off of the intense scene.
<br><br>
Elvinia was the youngest of the direct descendants, despite that she had the most potential. After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was quite fond of her. Due to that, they never dared underestimate her skills.
<br><br>
On many occasions, she had proven herself to have talents beyond the reach of her peers. She was always ahead of them. Even without the aid of her Other Shore Token, she could easily beat any of them in battle.
<br><br>
"Nice sword shield, but I wouldn't count on it to protect me if I were you!"
<br><br>
A confident smirk appeared on Zen's face as one corner of his mouth tilted upwards. He continued his relentless attacks to break his way through.
<br><br>
Not holding back, he charged fearlessly into the sword curtain guarding her.
<br><br>
Before he made his way through it, the black layer on his skin appeared once more and covered his entire body up like armor.
<br><br>
"Cling! Cling! Cling!"
<br><br>
One after another, the long swords rained down on Zen, but failed to pierce through his body. It was like he was made up of pure iron! Watching Zen draw closer with every passing second, Elvinia felt slightly panicked.
<br><br>
Taking caution to the situation, she began to move backward gracefully as if gliding on the surface of the water. Stalling for time before she could make her move, she kept retreating to keep Zen in the sword curtain.
<br><br>
"Cling! Cling! Cling!"
<br><br>
Within just ten seconds, the swords had hit Zen tens of thousands of times! However, his movements remained quick. There was no hint of staggering or injury on his body.
<br><br>
Having witnessed this incredible spectacle, the spectators were rendered speechless. Each of their jaws had made their home on the floor as they stood there rooted to the ground.
<br><br>
These direct descendants from the Oneness Mountain received a better education than the ordinary people, and they had had their fair share of experiences. However, nothing compared to what they were observing just now.
<br><br>
Was that body covered in black substance still human? Elvinia kept at her attempts on retreating, but Zen was faster.
<br><br>
He finally caught up to her and managed to pass through the sword curtain! With a determined look on her face, she raised her right hand. As if to mimic her gestures, the Warrior of the Stone Hill raised its right hand as well and aimed for Zen.
<br><br>
Even if Zen was resilient enough to withstand the sword curtain, Elvinia was sure he couldn't survive the Warrior of the Stone Hill! "Phew!"
<br><br>
With quick action, the Warrior of the Stone Hill launched its attack on Zen with its right hand. It wanted to smash Zen like a bothersome insect.
<br><br>
The strength held by the enormous palm apparently reached a specific limit.
<br><br>
Anything that came under it would be reduced to little silver dust.
<br><br>
"Look at that! It's unbelievable!"
<br><br>
At the sight of the large palm, Zen prepared himself. He tightened his jaw and twisted his face while he drew massive power from his Strength God Totem.
<br><br>
"What is he doing?"
<br><br>
"The power of the Warrior of the Stone Hill reaches the limit of the Lust World! He doesn't stand a chance!"
<br><br>
"The ultimate force should exceed 1, 000 divine megatons! This is suicide! Is he going to get smashed under it?"
<br><br>
The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace shared pitiful looks as they found out that Zen refused to move from his spot and wanted to take the Warrior of the Stone Hill head-on. To them, he was already a dead man.
<br><br>
Zen stood straight as he composed himself. The Other Shore Power he had gathered from the Strength God Totem was ready. With a determined look on his face, he dashed to hit the gigantic palm falling down on him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3208 Unexpected Fear The Warrior of the Stone Hill was ten times bigger than an ordinary person, which was why it had such a large palm.
<br><br>
The huge palm pressed down, distinctly contrasting with Zen's black fist.
<br><br>
Zen gave his all to extract his strength to the fullest.
<br><br>
He channeled most of the Shade Stone liquid into his right arm, leaving only a small part to converge in his spine.
<br><br>
He was afraid that his spine wouldn't be able to bear such a strong impact and crash.
<br><br>
Flamine's eyes were sparkling with a golden brilliance, the radiance of the divine flames of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Logic dictated that she should stop the fight right this moment.
<br><br>
She rarely left the Phoenix Palace and she didn't know Zen, but her keen eyes allowed her to minutely observe Zen's potential.
<br><br>
She assumed that such talent might be greatly valued in the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
If he died in the Phoenix Palace, the Phoenix Palace could never explain themselves to the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
But as she looked at Zen's powerful momentum, Flamine had a premonition that Zen would probably not be defeated by this blow.
<br><br>
The premonition got the better of her and as a result, she did nothing to stop the fight.
<br><br>
Bam! The entirety of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace shook violently as the palm met Zen's fist.
<br><br>
Even the concubines, who were always in the depths of the Phoenix Palace, felt the tremor.
<br><br>
A crackling sound ripped through the air.
<br><br>
The Warrior of the Stone Hill retracted its right hand, a crack spreading along it all the way to its shoulder.
<br><br>
"Ah?"
<br><br>
Elvinia looked at her Other Shore Token in disbelief.
<br><br>
It was unbelievable that the right hand of the Warrior of the Stone Hill had cracked! There were many kinds of Other Shore Tokens with different abilities on the Other Shore. The Warrior of the Stone Hill was ranked among the top five Other Shore Tokens of the descending type in the Lust World.
<br><br>
Its strength and defensive power were considered the best in the Lust World. Elvinia had the ability to fight against the masters at the Chaotic Source Realm with the help of this Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
And now, Zen had broken its arm with just one punch! The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace looked on in shock at the powerful punch that had shaken the earth.
<br><br>
"He is outrageous!"
<br><br>
"I've never heard of a person like him in the Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
"But where is he? Why can't I see him?"
<br><br>
"It looks like Elvinia's Other Shore Token sent him underground. He might have broken the Warrior of the Stone Hill with his punch, but I think he's badly injured as well!"
<br><br>
As they speculated, the ground behind Elvinia began to bulge. Before anyone could react, Zen emerged from it and made his way towards Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia was surprised to see Zen alive. He had taken the most powerful palm strike from the Warrior of the Stone Hill and turned it on the warrior such that it hadn't been able to bear the impact.
<br><br>
How had this guy remained unharmed? When Elvinia saw that Zen was coming straight at her, her eyes began to flash with a golden light, like two suns shining in her eyes.
<br><br>
"No, Elvinia! You can't!"
<br><br>
Flamine was horrified at what was about to transpire before her eyes.
<br><br>
Elvinia was going to release the divine flames of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Zen was now too close to Elvinia. It was too late for Flamine to stop him.
<br><br>
With a crisp sizzling noise, gold flames poured out of Elvinia's body in all directions.
<br><br>
At the rate they were going, they might burn everything they touched.
<br><br>
The people of the Phoenix Palace watched the golden flames, paling in horror.
<br><br>
The divine flames of the Sun Crow race also existed in the furnace at the gates of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. Everyone knew of the power of the flames. Anyone who touched them was sure to die.
<br><br>
The whole Heavenly Cultivation Palace would catch fire if Flamine didn't stop the flames soon! Once the people of the Phoenix Palace moved to a safe location, the ribbon that was on Flamine flew into the air and twisted into an enormous circle, a bright golden light radiating off of it.
<br><br>
The divine flames of the Sun Crow race had been contained, but Zen was in trouble.
<br><br>
Flamine was regretting not taking any early action. If she had known this would happen, she would have stopped it at the very beginning. She shouldn't have let the two kids fight each other.
<br><br>
She turned to look at Zen but was surprised at what she saw.
<br><br>
Zen glowed within the golden flames, unafraid of being burnt by the divine flames of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
He grabbed Elvinia's snow-white neck with one hand and pushed her down, sneering as he said, "Your flames are stronger than those of the demon women of the Divine Lair, but if you think you can burn me to death, you're dreaming! Release them! Or I will kill you!"
<br><br>
But Elvinia was incredibly tough.
<br><br>
She hadn't the slightest intention of giving in. Flames lit up on her body, completely wrapping her within them. She grinned and said sarcastically, "Your strength is indeed beyond my expectation. But can you really kill me?"
<br><br>
"Keep talking and you will see soon enough!"
<br><br>
Zen said, laughing. The pupil of his right eye suddenly began to glow.
<br><br>
As the white light flashed, the Snow Sword came to his hand with a sudden whooshing sound.
<br><br>
It was difficult for Zen's demonic eye to see through powerful warriors who had gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. Elvinia was powerful, but she was still in the Lust World with Zen and hadn't gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement yet.
<br><br>
As he activated his demonic eye, he found many flaws in her body.
<br><br>
The only thing that could protect her was the flame textures that wrapped her tightly within them, protecting her from getting injured.
<br><br>
But with the help of the Authentic Visual World, Zen saw that these flame textures were not perfect. There were still minor flaws in the gaps between the textures.
<br><br>
'Under the neck!' That was where the flaw of the flame textures and Elvinia's flaw overlapped.
<br><br>
Elvinia was sure to die if he were to attack that spot.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
As Zen brought his sword down, a flash of fear entered Elvinia's heart.
<br><br>
She had assumed that under the protection of the flame textures, Zen would not be able to kill her. But she now had a premonition that this sword strike was going to shatter her into pieces.
<br><br>
Red light flashed in Zen's eyes, magnifying the fear within her.
<br><br>
She saw a faint illusion in which her body shattered to the ground like porcelain. Now that her emotions were all over the face, the apathetic defense that she had put up, collapsed.
<br><br>
"Ah! Please don't kill me!"
<br><br>
Elvinia cried, her body straightening up and her hands curling reflexively.
<br><br>
Her tears evaporated into steam the moment they formed, thanks to the golden flames.
<br><br>
She had never been so afraid of death in her life.
<br><br>
"No, please!"
<br><br>
Flamine was horrified at what was transpiring before her.
<br><br>
The Snow Sword stopped abruptly, humming in midair, the tip pointing at Elvinia's chest.
<br><br>
"Release them, and I will not kill you," Zen said.
<br><br>
Killing Elvinia would be his last resort now.
<br><br>
But this evil woman was stubborn. She'd never make a concession unless her life was threatened.
<br><br>
"Please don't kill me! Please!"
<br><br>
Elvinia seemed not to hear Zen as she continued to beg.
<br><br>
Zen had already withdrawn the demonic eye but she was still seized with fear, unable to emerge from the panic it caused.
<br><br>
Chapter 3209 An Outsider A sharp, snapping sound cracked through the air.
<br><br>
A purple ribbon lashed out at Zen, sending him flying with the force of the blow.
<br><br>
Flamine rushed up to Elvinia and held her in her arms, looking worried.
<br><br>
Zen steadied himself midair and landed cleanly on the ground. He stood up unharmed, giving Elvinia a strange look.
<br><br>
In theory, as soon as the demonic eye stopped releasing the power of fear, then the imposed fears of the opponent would vanish.
<br><br>
Zen had released the power of his demonic eye to frighten her, but even now that he had stopped, Elvinia remained in a state of deep fear. She seemed unable to shake off her terror.
<br><br>
The divine flames of the Sun Crow race were gradually burning themselves out. Soon they extinguished, surrounded by the black, charred remnants of everything burned by the flames.
<br><br>
In the arms of Flamine, Elvinia still trembled and shuddered with fear.
<br><br>
Flamine raised her hand and gently touched the spot between Elvinia's brows. A soothing aura passed through her fingers and flowed into Elvinia's body, until she began to calm down.
<br><br>
Flamine turned to Zen. "Did you use some trick to cause her such fear?" she demanded.
<br><br>
The Truth of Goodwill and Malice was a rather unpopular Truth of Godly Way in the Oneness Sky Palace, but Flamine still recognized it immediately. What she didn't know was that Zen had used the power of the demonic eye.
<br><br>
"Yes," said Zen.
<br><br>
Flamine sighed. Instead of blaming Zen, she said guiltily, "It's my fault...
<br><br>
After she was born, she was put through a series of very cruel tests in the Divine Lair. Your trick has brought back those terrible experiences to her."
<br><br>
Many people imagined that a demon woman of the Divine Lair would grow up in an environment of love and care just like humans. In truth, it was nothing like that.
<br><br>
Elvinia, for instance, had been considered a front-runner in the quest for the Divine Lair's next leader from the moment she was born.
<br><br>
To establish her right to become the leader, she had been forced to compete from a very early age with other demon women of the Divine Lair in fights to the death. Countless young girls like her died at her hands, while she herself sustained various injuries and traumas. She grew up exposed to cruelty, death, and suffering. When Elvinia was six years old, Eastern Emperor Taiyi fought his way into the Divine Lair and took her under his care. If not for his intervention, Elvinia would have become the leader already.
<br><br>
Although Elvinia spent the next several years in the relative safety of the Phoenix Palace, the memory of her childhood was indelible. Flamine had needed to use a special method to seal Elvinia's traumatic memories in the depths of her soul.
<br><br>
However, there were some theurgies of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice that could still trigger her and stir up her childhood memories.
<br><br>
Elvinia's bouts with panic and fear were particularly unsettling because she had otherwise developed a facade of indifference and detachment. It was the only way she could survive the brutal experiences of her childhood.
<br><br>
"Then why didn't you stop us just now?" Zen admonished, frowning.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't expected that he would have to fight Elvinia with Flamine on the sidelines, watching the battle the entire time.
<br><br>
He felt anger rising in him. He had needed to force Elvinia to release Laquisha, Nelly and Lavender.
<br><br>
Flamine continued to rub the spot between Elvinia's eyebrows, sadness appearing in her face. "I made a mistake. I wanted to see how far she had come, by seeing how far you could push her..."
<br><br>
Upon her return to the Phoenix Palace, Elvinia had been mostly laconic and indifferent to everything going on around her. Flamine spent as much time with her as she could, often staying by her side throughout the day, but there seemed to be little to no improvement in Elvinia's disposition. As a mother, she couldn't help but feel desperate for anything that could shake her daughter out of her apathy.
<br><br>
But Flamine's efforts were in vain. Nothing she did succeeded in changing her daughter's attitude. Elvinia's heart had been shaped by fear and cruelty, and she now used indifference as a wall to guard against everything and anything that could do further damage to her psyche.
<br><br>
"Wouldn't it be more painful for both of you if I kept pushing her?" Zen asked with a sigh.
<br><br>
Flamine gave him a small smile. "No. When she is with you, she seems to be feeling things more deeply. Her emotions are richer. I am her mother and I never saw her that angry, but today I even saw her cry..."
<br><br>
When Flamine first brought Zen to her, Elvinia was indeed indifferent to her mother. She was apathetic towards everyone, really.
<br><br>
Zen wanted to roll his eyes, although he resisted the urge. This was too strange for him. He couldn't help feeling like this Flamine and Elvinia were a matched pair of lunatics. Should he scare Elvinia occasionally to satisfy Flamine? "The Soul Fire Swirl is not a punishment. It's actually a cultivation method.
<br><br>
Even the direct line of the Phoenix Palace would cherish this kind of cultivation method. The people you want to find should not be in danger,"
<br><br>
Flamine said.
<br><br>
Zen was stunned for a moment. To himself he thought, with a trace of exasperation, 'If you two had made that clear earlier, we could have avoided the fight entirely.' After a while, Elvinia finally awoke, and she found herself lying in her mother's arms.
<br><br>
She saw Zen nearby and glared at him. Breaking free from Flamine's arms, she hurriedly got up and started to leave the place.
<br><br>
"You lost to me," Zen said behind her.
<br><br>
Elvinia stopped in her track and asked coldly, "So what do you want?"
<br><br>
"Take me to find them," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
Flamine watched their exchange without comment. Elvinia hesitated, looking torn, then she seemed to make up her mind. "Follow me," she told Zen.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Flamine, who nodded her assent. Elvinia marched out and Zen followed her as she made her way to the Fire Bearing Hall.
<br><br>
Flamine watched them leave, gazing at Zen's tall figure from behind. She smiled to herself, and murmured, "He's not afraid of the divine flames of the Sun Crow race, and his strength is greater than Elvinia's. I think they could be a good match..."
<br><br>
Streams of hot, intense auras reached Elvinia and Zen as they drew closer to the Fire Bearing Hall.
<br><br>
The walls of the hall were strung with glowing, red-hot chains, which drooped down like noodles as the metal of the chains softened in the burning heat. When Elvinia and Zen glanced up at the beams supporting the chains, they could see the tongues of flame licking at the pillars and eaves.
<br><br>
When they looked down at the floor, which was also emanating heat, they could see the same burning flames in the cracks.
<br><br>
Zen was curious and would have liked to hear what people were cultivating in the Fire Bearing Hall. But, catching sight of Elvinia's stony, sullen face, he decided it would be best to stay quiet for now.
<br><br>
The two of them walked silently down a long, narrow corridor, then Elvinia abruptly turned and entered a side hall. Zen followed.
<br><br>
Zen instantly sensed a soul aura within the scorching, intense heat of the side hall.
<br><br>
His eyes lit up with excitement. This aura was quite similar to the aura of the soul pills. It was similar to that of the starlight that had landed outside Dragon City. And yet, the aura here was far stronger than either of those.
<br><br>
Indeed, the aura here was at least ten times stronger than that of the soul pills or the starlight.
<br><br>
There were three people seated cross-legged in the center of the hall.
<br><br>
Lavender, Nelly, and Laquisha sat beneath several red-hot chains. There were small swirls of flame burning under each chain, and these seemed to be the source of the powerful soul aura.
<br><br>
It was the first time Zen had seen a soul cultivated in such a manner. He was surprised and interested.
<br><br>
"Is this the Soul Fire Swirl?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Well, what else would it be?" Elvinia snapped, still angry with Zen.
<br><br>
Zen looked mildly embarrassed. "Ah, I thought it was a kind of torture for a moment..."
<br><br>
Elvinia's indifference was giving way to anger as she stared fiercely at Zen.
<br><br>
At that moment, Nelly opened her eyes, and the flame swirling over her head immediately dissipated along the chain above her. Nelly saw Elvinia and grinned. "Little Master, I feel my aura has improved again! Eh? Zen?"
<br><br>
Zen, watching Nelly, was puzzled by her reaction.
<br><br>
He had not expected her to treat Elvinia as though she was an intimate, and he was surprised to feel like somewhat of an outsider.
<br><br>
Laquisha and Lavender also opened their eyes. When Laquisha saw Zen, she showed no sign of distress or worry. She only smiled sweetly and said, "You finally found us here!"
<br><br>
"Little Master said that you probably wouldn't be able to enter the Phoenix Palace," Lavender said, also favoring Zen with a smile.
<br><br>
Zen was nonplussed. He had fought so hard to find these three, but now they were acting as though they hadn't been in danger at all. He realized that they had not been imprisoned. They were never in any kind of peril, and they had not been worried about anything.
<br><br>
Chapter 3210 Strangers Zen stood there uncertainly and frowned. "You called her Little Master?"
<br><br>
Lavender, Nelly and Laquisha exchanged knowing glances, then they all turned to face Zen. "We have all become Elvinia's disciples!" Nelly beamed. "Since Elvinia is still quite young, we address her as 'Little Master'."
<br><br>
Zen shot a glance at Elvinia, who stared back at him unflinchingly.
<br><br>
"But since you are fine, let's go back already," Zen said.
<br><br>
He figured it wasn't appropriate for his wives to stay in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
He couldn't fathom why they needed to become disciples of Elvinia.
<br><br>
However, to his surprise, both Nelly and Laquisha shook their heads. Even Lavender smiled wistfully without saying a word.
<br><br>
Zen knew Lavender wouldn't ever go against his wishes, but he could tell from her reaction that she also thought the Phoenix Palace would be an excellent place to cultivate.
<br><br>
He scratched his head, trying to figure out what to do.
<br><br>
Initially, the girls had been against the idea. However, since Elvinia didn't cause them trouble and instead treated them as those direct descendants sincerely, they warmed up to the idea of training under her.
<br><br>
They considered their options. The Phoenix Palace was definitely superior compared to the environment outside the Dragon City. Even the Flow Sword Sect couldn't come close to it. After all, it was built by Eastern Emperor Taiyi; of course its resources were of the best quality.
<br><br>
Besides, Elvinia did give them advice from time to time. No one could deny her talent. With her input and their good understandings, they made notable progress more rapidly than before.
<br><br>
As a result, the three girls started calling her Little Master...
<br><br>
Seeing Zen's upset expression, Laquisha came forward and held his hand in hers. "It's safe here." She batted her eyelashes at him. "If we were in the Dragon City, we might not be able to reach the Other Shore in decades. We can save a lot of time here!"
<br><br>
There were many challenges on the way to the Other Shore, such as the nine lines and the huge whirlpools on the Sea of Truth, which posed a great risk. No one knew how many people were lost to the whirlpools or died on the nine lines. However, this risk could be greatly reduced if they could train in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Zen sighed. He knew this was true.
<br><br>
Even if he had earned a lot of divine crystals by virtue of his Instant Enlightenment, he would not be able to provide such a good environment for the girls.
<br><br>
But seeing Elvinia gloating over him, he couldn't help but feel exasperated.
<br><br>
"Why did you bring them here?" Zen suddenly asked her.
<br><br>
Elvinia hesitated for a while. "I want to get the Truth Enlightenment."
<br><br>
On the day of the Seven Mountains Meeting, Elvinia had been severely humiliated by Zen since he had more words of the Truth Enlightenment than she did.
<br><br>
She lost to Zen not because she was not powerful enough, but because her understanding of the Truth Enlightenment was inferior to Zen.
<br><br>
This fed her hunger to grow stronger, but naturally, her pride didn't let her ask Zen for the words directly.
<br><br>
Thus, when she found out that Zen had family cultivating in the Dragon City, she arranged to have them brought to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Her initial plan was to blackmail Zen into handing over his Truth Enlightenment by holding these women hostage.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Nelly, Lavender and Laquisha all had a bad feeling about the arrangement in the first place. However, it turned out to be rather beneficial for them; the only disadvantage was Elvinia was difficult to get along with. They didn't even know her true identity until they asked a maid.
<br><br>
After meeting the three girls, gradually, Elvinia grew to be almost fond of them. She even gave them several tips about cultivating.
<br><br>
Once Zen finally understood what had really happened in the past few days, he sighed and waved his hand gently.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A piece of rice paper materialized in his hand.
<br><br>
"Fine. I have already shared one hundred and fifty words of the Truth Enlightenment with several people. In fact, if you had asked Athemar or any of the other elders, you could've easily gotten it." Zen gently touched the scroll of rice paper, and it unfurled before him.
<br><br>
Then, with a slight gesture, Zen produced an ink brush in his other hand.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! With quick and vigorous movements, Zen wrote down one hundred and eighty words of the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
"I've only deciphered the last thirty words recently. No one knows about it.
<br><br>
I'm giving this to you in exchange for teaching my girls," Zen said as he gently pushed the rice paper to fly towards Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia had been indifferent about everything her whole life. Her sole interest was to improve her cultivation, so she didn't mind taking the time to give Nelly, Laquisha and Lavender some tips. It also seemed as though she'd taken a liking towards teaching.
<br><br>
Elvinia snatched the paper eagerly, gulping down every word Zen wrote down.
<br><br>
After that, she carefully folded the rice paper. "Is there any more? If the Truth Enlightenment has been deciphered completely, it should be more than this."
<br><br>
Zen chuckled. There was no way he was going to give it all to her in one go.
<br><br>
"It's hard to decipher the rest. This is all." He paused, raising his eyebrow.
<br><br>
"If they can successfully break through to the Other Shore, I might be able to decipher something by then..."
<br><br>
Elvinia knitted her brows, dubious as to whether Zen was speaking the truth. However, there was nothing she could do about it; in fact, she was already quite happy with the hundred and eighty words.
<br><br>
As Zen waved good-bye to Nelly, Laquisha and Lavender, he gently reminded them to stay safe. Then, he turned to leave the Fire Bearing Hall.
<br><br>
When Zen arrived at the door of the Fire Bearing Hall, he found Flamine there waiting for him. There seemed to be a concerned look on her face, as though she wanted to tell him something, but she hesitated.
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine," he said, "do you have something to tell me?"
<br><br>
Flamine, noticing Zen had come out alone, realized that the three women would be staying at the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
"It is true that cultivating in the Phoenix Palace is far better than that in the Dragon City. If they stay here, they will be treated as direct descendants of the Oneness Sky Palace," said Flamine cautiously.
<br><br>
"Thank you, Lady Flamine," said Zen as he politely nodded his head.
<br><br>
Flamine suddenly stretched out her hand and pressed a green jade token onto his palm. "This is the token of the Phoenix Palace. You must take it the next time you come here." Her eyes flashed seriously. "You were lucky to have entered the Primitive Illusion and emerged from it in one piece, but the next time, you won't be so lucky..."
<br><br>
Zen knew the guards would up their defense the next time he came here. If he were to visit the Phoenix Palace again, he knew that what Flamine said was true.
<br><br>
Zen gratefully took the token and held it up to his eyes to observe it closely.
<br><br>
Without a word, he stuffed it into his space ring.
<br><br>
As Zen finally took his leave, Flamine called to him softly, "If you have the time, you should come here more often..."
<br><br>
She smiled mischievously. Zen waved, but couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy.
<br><br>
He knew he was definitely going to come back sometime in the future, since the girls were cultivating here. But what did that have to do with Flamine? When Zen exited the gates of the Phoenix Palace, the dense, white mist of the Primitive Illusion ebbed away, giving him a path. The road before him seemed to be made of mist, soft as cotton.
<br><br>
After flying along the road for a while, Zen arrived at the Cloudy Mountain Palace on the hillside.
<br><br>
Zen was surprised to be met by three figures by a big stone that marked the front of the Cloudy Mountain Palace -- an old man in black flanked by two young men. While Zen had passed by the Cloudy Mountain Palace several times before, he'd never seen them before.
<br><br>
Chapter 3211 Invitation To Vastness Mountain Zen headed straight towards the Dragon Path, ignoring the group of strangers.
<br><br>
He was walking past the old man in black when one of the young men called out to him. "Pardon me, but are you Zen Luo?"
<br><br>
Zen stopped, instantly alert. But he believed it was relatively safe here on Oneness Mountain, so he nodded. "Yes, I am."
<br><br>
The young man smiled coldly at him. "Zen Luo, we'd like to extend you an invitation. Come with us to Vastness Mountain."
<br><br>
At the mention of Vastness Mountain, Zen's eyes narrowed slightly. He said, matching the young man's cold tone, "No. I have no interest in going there."
<br><br>
After he had killed Marco at Clear Lake, Zen had known that there would be retribution from Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
But despite what had happened between him and Marco, Zen was a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace and an elite disciple of the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
The Vastness Mountain would not dare to go openly against him. To get their revenge, they would have to operate in secrecy. He had not expected representatives of Vastness Mountain to be so bold as to wait for him at this place, in broad daylight. They must have known he would refuse their invitation.
<br><br>
Zen had absolutely no intention of agreeing to go with them to Vastness Mountain. He decided not to engage these strangers any further. He turned away from the young man and started to walk away.
<br><br>
The young man and his companion quickly moved forward, blocking his way. He faced Zen and said, still in that icy tone, "I'm afraid it's not up to you."
<br><br>
"Do you plan to try and force me? Do you want to fight me right now?" Zen said incredulously, speaking as loudly as possible. The Cloudy Mountain Palace was nearby and he wanted the palace to hear the trouble taking place. He believed Calum would not just stand by and watch.
<br><br>
The old man in black heaved a sigh, and Zen turned back to look at him.
<br><br>
The old man stared at Zen and said, "It seems you truly don't realize the gravity of what you did. We have every reason to kill you where you stand, without even engaging you in a fair fight. But as you can see, we are not here to kill you. We are only obeying orders."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he released a strand of his aura, which quickly reached Zen.
<br><br>
The aura did not seem particularly strong, so at first Zen was not worried.
<br><br>
But as he perceived the aura and tried to resist it, he realized he couldn't.
<br><br>
'This man is more powerful than I am!' Zen thought, his eyes widening with astonishment. He decided his best course of action was to flee and take stock of the situation. But before he could choose between going to the Cloudy Mountain Palace or taking the Dragon Path, a gleaming circle of silvery light suddenly opened beneath his feet. There was a dark, ominous space in the depths of the silver circle.
<br><br>
Zen instantly knew that something was wrong. As his one foot slipped into the hole, he attempted to push off from the ground with his other foot, trying to leap up and take flight.
<br><br>
But the mysterious power in the dark space within the circle pulled on him, refusing to let him fly away. Zen lost his balance and fell into the darkness.
<br><br>
It swallowed him instantly.
<br><br>
As Zen vanished, the old man waved his hand gently, and a little golden monkey appeared above his head.
<br><br>
The golden monkey emitted a strong, distinctive Other Shore Power. It was obviously a living Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
The old man held out his hand and a few divine crystals appeared in his palm. The golden monkey crawled gently along his arm and grabbed the divine crystals from his hand, throwing them into its mouth and starting to gnaw with relish.
<br><br>
"Put away the ring," the old man ordered.
<br><br>
The small monkey squeaked in reply.
<br><br>
In response to the monkey's squeak, the silver circle of light on the ground shrank and disappeared, leaving no trace that it had ever been there.
<br><br>
No sooner had the circle vanished than a loud thud was heard from the Cloudy Mountain Palace nearby.
<br><br>
The bang was deafening.
<br><br>
Shadows emerged around the Cloudy Mountain Palace, which dissipated as Calum stepped out of the palace entrance. Calum ignored the young men and zeroed in on the old man in black, his expression thunderous. "Holden! How dare you engage in this kind of treacherous behavior? You go too far! How dare you abduct a disciple right here at Oneness Mountain!"
<br><br>
Early that morning, Holden, the old man in black, had visited the Cloudy Mountain Palace with his two disciples.
<br><br>
Holden was well-known in many circles as a powerful warrior. While he did not have the reputation of Athemar and Goran, he was equally as strong as them.
<br><br>
Calum had been bewildered by the sudden, unexpected visit. After all, there was rarely any communication between the Vastness Mountain and the Oneness Mountain. However, since Holden was a respected master, Calum welcomed them properly.
<br><br>
Now he realized that Holden had been lurking here with his disciples for several days for only one reason: to abduct Zen.
<br><br>
This deceit and abuse of his hospitality angered Calum greatly. As soon as Zen had arrived, Holden had set a magic array around the Cloudy Mountain Palace which concealed their acts from the people inside the palace.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Calum had noticed something wrong through the array plate of the Dragon Path. Otherwise Zen would have been taken away without anyone ever knowing what had happened.
<br><br>
Holden remained imperturbable. "You should know, that man killed the son of our mountain head. He deserves to be punished. I was ordered to take him to Vastness Mountain to ensure that justice is served. Calm down, Calum."
<br><br>
"Bring Zen back right now, and I will calm down," Calum snapped back, glaring at Holden.
<br><br>
Like Sellers, Calum was a guide, although he was tasked with more important duties. In Oneness Mountain, he was in charge of the Dragon Path and part of the mountain protecting arrays.
<br><br>
As a member of Oneness Mountain, Calum was aware of the close relationship between Zen and Athemar. He had vowed to do everything in his power to keep Zen safe, so there was no way he would let Holden just walk away after abducting Zen.
<br><br>
Holden was not moved by Calum's anger. "What if I can't do that?"
<br><br>
His words were accompanied by a squeak.
<br><br>
It was his little monkey, who bared its teeth at Calum, trying to provoke him.
<br><br>
The most precious and powerful of all Other Shore Tokens took the form of living beings.
<br><br>
Calum couldn't help but feel a twinge of fear at the sight of the small golden monkey.
<br><br>
Holden saw his fear. He waved his hand at his two disciples, motioning for them to leave with him. He gazed solemnly at Calum and warned, "It was by the order of Gethin that I captured Zen. You shouldn't get involved in this matter. You'll just get yourself into trouble."
<br><br>
With that, he and his disciples vanished from Calum's sight.
<br><br>
"Gethin is the head of the Vastness Mountain...
<br><br>
Why would Zen kill his son?"
<br><br>
Calum muttered. He wondered anxiously what he should do next.
<br><br>
Zen's excellent performance in the Dragon Path had greatly impressed Calum.
<br><br>
He believed this young man was destined to be a new star in the Oneness Mountain. He was better than Milo. He couldn't understand how or why Zen would provoke such a serious conflict with the powerful Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
Holden was right—this matter exceeded Calum's authority. Calum thought it over and decided the best course of action was to report to Athemar as quickly as possible.
<br><br>
Zen, meanwhile, had been shocked as he fell into the darkness. It was like dropping down an infinite abyss, without any light, without any hope of reaching the bottom.
<br><br>
A mysterious force gripped Zen's body like an invisible shackle which prevented him from moving as he fell. It felt like he was trapped forever in the abyss.
<br><br>
Zen wondered with some despair if it would ever end. Then abruptly, after about an hour had passed, a silver light flashed in his vision, and he felt a surge of relief. A circle of silvery light appeared once more below his feet.
<br><br>
He slipped cleanly through the silver circle.
<br><br>
There was a crashing sound as he landed somewhere.
<br><br>
The dark space vanished behind Zen as he rolled onto a cold floor.
<br><br>
He tried to get up. He could move again! Instantly he jumped up and glanced around him.
<br><br>
He was in an unfamiliar, gloomy hall.
<br><br>
The room was dark, and several people were already there, apparently waiting for him. Men in black robes flanked a woman who sat facing him.
<br><br>
She was very beautiful, dressed all in red, but she was looking at Zen with deep hatred.
<br><br>
Zen studied the woman. She had a red dot in the center of her eyebrows.
<br><br>
Her eyes were full of bitterness and resentment as she stared back at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen did not move or speak. Finally the woman broke the silence. "Was it you who killed my son?" she demanded, gnashing her teeth.
<br><br>
Zen realized that this beautiful woman was Marco's mother.
<br><br>
The Vastness Mountain knew that Zen had killed Marco almost as soon as it had happened. They immediately sent people to Clear Lake to capture Zen, but he was no longer there when they arrived. Zen himself had not stayed any longer at Clear Lake once he had killed Marco. He returned as soon as possible to Dragon City with Trish and Gant.
<br><br>
The agents of Vastness Mountain had failed to intercept Marco's killer, but they quickly identified the killer as Zen. To abduct him, the Vastness Mountain sent Holden to wait for Zen on the only way into Oneness Mountain—right before the Dragon Path.
<br><br>
As soon as he understood what this was all about, Zen calmed down. He collected his thoughts and met the eyes of the beautiful woman in red. "Yes, it was me."
<br><br>
Chapter 3212 The Soul Searching Hand Zen thought admitting he had killed her son would make her furious.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, however, any resentment she did have seemed to disappear in the blink of an eye and she was calm again.
<br><br>
The expression of the beautiful woman in red made Zen restless and uneasy.
<br><br>
Something didn't feel right when he was captured by the old man in black.
<br><br>
If the old man really wanted to kill him to avenge Marco's death, he could have done it on the Oneness Mountain and Zen would not have been able to fight back. If there really were people secretly protecting Zen, even they would not have been able to get to him in time.
<br><br>
But the old man had brought him here. The people of the Vastness Mountain had to be up to something.
<br><br>
"Marco was my favorite son. You have to give me an explanation for his death," the woman said coolly.
<br><br>
"An explanation?" Zen retorted, his eyebrows raised and his voice rife with derision. "He tried to kill me on several occasions. This time, at the Ripple Pavilion competition, he lured me into the arena and tried to kill me again.
<br><br>
If he wasn't so weak, I'd be dead. And now you want an explanation? Are you kidding me?"
<br><br>
"Even if what you say is true, it's not you who died, but my son," she replied indifferently.
<br><br>
It sounded somewhat reasonable.
<br><br>
Marco had lost his life, while Zen stood here safe and sound. Relatively.
<br><br>
It seemed rational enough that his mother had him brought here, wanting an explanation.
<br><br>
"Enough beating around the bush. What is that you want?" Zen asked impatiently.
<br><br>
The woman stood up and strolled gracefully to Zen's side. Her gaze was so sharp that it seemed as if she could see through him. Finally, she revealed her true intention. "I heard that you stood out in the Seven Mountains Meeting and showed extraordinary strength. It seems that your victory had something to do with the Truth of Godly Way, right?"
<br><br>
Zen stood still and silent.
<br><br>
"The runes that Athemar created are all made of the Imperial Sword Seals.
<br><br>
Even if you are a genius capable of Instant Enlightenment, you should not have performed as you did. What did you rely on?" she asked with a smile.
<br><br>
Now Zen finally understood her purpose—she wanted the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
He sighed inwardly at her quick change in attitude.
<br><br>
She didn't appear sad at all. It seemed that Marco's life or death didn't really mean anything to the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
Zen was right.
<br><br>
Eastern Emperor Taiyi had many concubines and even more direct descendants. So did the leader of Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
The Phoenix Palace had even more disciples than the Flow Sword Sect. The ones in high regard were either those with incredible talent or those favored by Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Elvinia was one of them.
<br><br>
The Vastness Mountain was not much different. Gethin was born in the Xu Clan of the Clear Lake and had stayed in the Bloom Divine Province for almost as long as Eastern Emperor Taiyi. He had been the head of the Vastness Mountain for countless years and had tens of thousands of sons.
<br><br>
His sons had more sons still and these were all his direct descendants.
<br><br>
Marco was one of Gethin's favorite sons, but still not as important as Elvinia was in the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
"I relied on my strength," Zen replied seriously.
<br><br>
The woman focused her gaze tightly on Zen, a faint flicker of disappointment in her eyes. "You're very strong. It really is quite impressive that you killed Lazlo, Drystan and Grayson on your own. However, Athemar's Imperial Sword Seal is very special. It's activated by the truth aura and has nothing to do with one's strength," she said, still smiling.
<br><br>
She could not hide her motives anymore. "I heard that there is a subsequent chapter to the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, and it is the most important.
<br><br>
But it has never been deciphered before. Now, it seems someone has indeed done it."
<br><br>
Zen shrugged and looked at her dully. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said flatly.
<br><br>
"Really?"
<br><br>
The woman stretched out her hand, and a piece of yellow paper appeared in it. On the paper were more than twenty words.
<br><br>
Zen managed to catch a glance of the words, which happened to be the beginning of the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
He had already revealed one hundred and fifty words of the Truth Enlightenment. Athemar, Winchell, Goran and Master Hai would give the chapter to their disciples. It shouldn't be difficult for the Vastness Mountain to get their hands on it.
<br><br>
It had in fact taken a great deal of effort for the Vastness Mountain to procure the twenty-odd words.
<br><br>
Athemar, Winchell, Goran and Master Hai paid great attention to the Truth Enlightenment. Even though they had one hundred and fifty words in their hands, they didn't reveal all of them at once. For example, Winchell only gave the one hundred and fifty words to a few direct descendants of the Origin Mountain, while the elite disciples only had the twenty-odd words.
<br><br>
And the Vastness Mountain got the twenty-odd words from some elite disciple.
<br><br>
"These twenty-odd words are part of the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but they're not enough. According to our research, there should be at least a thousand or two thousand words in total. And you have them," the woman said as she walked behind Zen. "Hand over all of them and I will let you go. What do you think?"
<br><br>
Zen looked at her suspiciously.
<br><br>
She wanted him to give her the complete Truth Enlightenment in exchange for her forgiveness. She must be out of her mind.
<br><br>
The Truth Enlightenment was very important. It was after all part of the foundation of the Oneness Sky Palace. He would give it to the palace if the right opportunity presented itself. He had hoped to exchange the chapter for the support of the palace or maybe for the palace to support the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
But this was definitely not the right time.
<br><br>
The woman wanted the complete Truth Enlightenment just because Zen had killed her son. That was not a deal worth taking.
<br><br>
"It was me who deciphered the twenty-odd words."
<br><br>
After much restraint, Zen finally admitted it. The eyes of everyone in the room lit up, revealing their judgment was well-placed.
<br><br>
"But I've only deciphered a hundred and fifty words in total, and I've handed them to Master Athemar. If you want, I can write them down," Zen added.
<br><br>
Since the one hundred and fifty words had already been released, sooner or later, they would be passed down like the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent to the entire Oneness Sky Palace disciples, and even to all the humans. He didn't mind writing them down again.
<br><br>
"That's not enough," the woman said, staring intently at Zen with a devilish smile. "I want the complete version."
<br><br>
Zen shrugged his shoulders, embarrassed. "That's not possible. I haven't deciphered the complete chapter myself. How can I give it to you?"
<br><br>
The woman shook her head and said, "I don't believe you. There are only two ways for you to get out of this. Either you write down the complete version yourself, or..."
<br><br>
She flicked a glance at the men in black robes.
<br><br>
One of the men stepped out of the line. A shadow appeared above his head, green mist rose and a green arm faintly materialized from it.
<br><br>
"It is an Other Shore Token from Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore. It's called the Soul Searching Hand. He won't hurt your soul. However, he is able to shuffle through your memories, bit by bit, with the Soul Searching Hand," she said with a grimace.
<br><br>
The Godly Ways such as the Great Dominance Technique had little effect on the powerful Other Shore Realm warriors. As long as Zen resisted, it would be difficult to search his soul.
<br><br>
However, there were some Other Shore Tokens that were able to deal with warriors' souls, and one of them was the Soul Searching Hand.
<br><br>
In the face of the green Soul Searching Hand, Zen's face darkened.
<br><br>
Chapter 3213 A Little Trick Zen could trace hints of doubts in the faces of Athemar, Goran and others when he told them about the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
They also wanted to acquire all of the Truth Enlightenment, but they didn't want to force Zen by using the method of soul searching.
<br><br>
Since Zen said he only had one hundred and fifty words, they believed what he said.
<br><br>
But the Vastness Mountain people were different. The woman in red insisted on the complete version, and they didn't believe Zen when he said he had only deciphered one hundred and fifty words.
<br><br>
She had been preparing even before Zen's arrival.
<br><br>
"Have you made up your mind? Do you want to write the complete chapter down yourself or do you need us to use force?" She stared at Zen with ice cold eyes.
<br><br>
Zen's brows furrowed as he remarked, "I only have one hundred and fifty words. It will take me years before I could decipher the whole thing. Even if I do, I will only give it to Eastern Emperor Taiyi and he will be the one to share it with the whole Oneness Sky Palace. You don't think he won't give it to the Vastness Mountain, do you?"
<br><br>
He wondered why the woman was in such a hurry.
<br><br>
The woman ignored Zen. She swiftly turned to the man in black. "Arjun, do it!" she ordered.
<br><br>
The man ran straight to Zen, and the green hand above his head charged towards him too.
<br><br>
How could Zen agree? He had plenty of secrets, not just the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
His secrets included the Chaos Ancient God, the divine land, Geoffrey's talent in deciphering the Sanskrit words, the Nine Li race and so on.
<br><br>
He would bring these secrets with him to his grave.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen kicked the floor and abruptly flew backward.
<br><br>
When he moved less than ten feet, the woman waved her hand gently.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen was back where he had been.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen attempted to flee again.
<br><br>
The trick repeated itself. Zen would barely reach ten feet before he found himself back on the floor.
<br><br>
Zen felt like there was an invisible force around him. No matter how hard he tried, he just kept spinning back to his spot.
<br><br>
"Young man, stop struggling," the woman said with a sinister smile.
<br><br>
Arjun reached Zen and pressed him with his green hand. Zen felt anxiety spin in his stomach.
<br><br>
Zen closed his eyes and the voice of No. 9527 filled his consciousness.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, it's just the Soul Searching Hand. Let him do it."
<br><br>
"Do you have a solution?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Of course," No. 9527 answered positively. "Just relax. He won't find anything."
<br><br>
No. 9527 was a wisp of its master's soul. It didn't contribute to Zen's strength in battle, but it had endless methods to deal with one's soul. Hence, Zen felt relieved with its words of assurance.
<br><br>
Of course, he still looked very nervous on the surface.
<br><br>
Swoosh! As Arjun approached Zen, the Soul Searching Hand grabbed Zen's head.
<br><br>
All of the five fingers sprawled neatly on his head.
<br><br>
Zen felt a whirlpool stir inside him. The soul aura was coming straight to his mind.
<br><br>
Inside him, No. 9527 was also making its move. Zen started to feel numbness in his soul. His mind was slowing down; he stood blankly, allowing the Soul Searching Hand to interrogate him.
<br><br>
Arjun wore an evil smile on his face. Green mist rolled on the surface of the Soul Searching Hand as it emitted a green glow.
<br><br>
He was gradually sucking Zen's memories to the point that he would remember some of Zen's memories as his own.
<br><br>
"Have you found it?" the woman asked Arjun. "Do you need a brush and ink to write it down?"
<br><br>
"Not yet," Arjun replied.
<br><br>
Countless memories entered his mind.
<br><br>
The memory of a beggar's life...
<br><br>
A butterfly stuck in a spider's web...
<br><br>
Even the evolution of a world...
<br><br>
Arjun's face curled into a confused expression. From what he knew, a person's memories would be arranged chronologically as they occurred— from one's childhood to adulthood.
<br><br>
But why were Zen's memories so haphazardly arranged? "I find some special memory fragments,"
<br><br>
Arjun declared as he found some memory fragments with special shapes.
<br><br>
Normally, he would ignore these and would only focus on acquiring what he needed to know. However, he wasn't able to find anything valuable in Zen's soul so his attention was all on the memory fragments.
<br><br>
He read the first memory fragment. Suddenly, a look of shock covered his face.
<br><br>
Those were the first ten-odd words of the Truth Enlightenment! It seemed like the words were scattered across memory fragments for some reason.
<br><br>
Arjun could not comprehend how and why that would happen, but he made sure to not let that chance go.
<br><br>
He transferred Zen's memory fragments into his own soul and tried to read through them as if they were his own.
<br><br>
As he was doing so, his eyes widened and his body began to tremble. His face suddenly turned ghostly pale.
<br><br>
"What? There are too many memory fragments. Damn it!" Arjun began to talk nonsense.
<br><br>
"Arjun, what's wrong with you?" The woman approached his trembling body.
<br><br>
Other men in the room shared puzzled looks.
<br><br>
Arjun wasn't the strongest among them, but he had the unique and important ability of the Soul Searching Hand. He had solved difficult problems in the past with that ability. What was his problem with Zen? Arjun dragged his own body away and retreated. After a few steps, he passed out and collapsed to the floor.
<br><br>
Zen recovered to his normal state. When he saw Arjun lying on the floor, he let out a genuine gasp. "No. 9527, what did you do?" he asked in his mind.
<br><br>
Arjun's soul was much stronger than Zen's. Even if No. 9527 was a wisp of Chaos Ancient God's soul, it would take a whole lot of effort to cause Arjun to suffer that much.
<br><br>
"I didn't do anything special. He likes searching people's souls, right? So I simply overwhelmed him with countless memories. His soul wasn't able to handle so many," No. 9527 said with a chuckle.
<br><br>
At first, it resembled the Chaos Ancient God in character. Now, since it had been with Zen for a long time, its own self-consciousness had evolved. It started to gain unique character traits. The Chaos Ancient God himself would never use such a little trick.
<br><br>
The memory fragments were a trap arranged by No. 9527 on purpose. It wanted to fool Arjun into thinking there was important information in the fragments.
<br><br>
The memory fragments covered a long timeline. No. 9527 made sure to include memories of the birth of chaos. Apart from the overwhelming quantity, the memories were also useless for humans as they did not have the ability to interpret them anyway.
<br><br>
A human's feeble attempt to interpret them would cause immense pain to their soul.
<br><br>
Chapter 3214 Emperor Gethin As the saying went, "A man whose heart is not content is like a snake that tries to swallow an elephant." Arjun had absorbed all the memory fragments into his mind and interpreted them.
<br><br>
It wasn't an elephant that he had swallowed. It was much larger than that. A whale.
<br><br>
A massive amount of memories poured out, raging at Arjun's soul. He fainted, unable to bear the weight of the memories.
<br><br>
The woman in red glared at Zen and shouted, "What did you do to him?"
<br><br>
Zen spread his arms out and shrugged, indicating that he hadn't done anything.
<br><br>
The woman waved her hand, causing a loud "bang" to reverberate through the air.
<br><br>
Zen felt like he had been hit by a heavy hammer. His body flew backward and crashed into the palace wall.
<br><br>
Even through the pain, he wondered what material this palace was made of.
<br><br>
The wall had only bent a little under such great force.
<br><br>
Zen leaned against the wall, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>
The woman was so strong, she had managed to injure him a little despite the protection of the Shade Stone liquid.
<br><br>
She looked coldly at him, although she was a little surprised as well.
<br><br>
She had thought she could beat Zen into unconsciousness, but the blow had hardly made a difference, much to her surprise.
<br><br>
"Lock him up!"
<br><br>
she ordered before turning around and leaving.
<br><br>
Two men in black walked up to Zen and dragged him to the back of the palace. One of them stomped his feet, causing the floor of the palace to crack open. A large square hole appeared, and they threw Zen in.
<br><br>
Zen didn't resist during the whole process.
<br><br>
These people were much more powerful than him and he knew that it would be useless to resist. If he did, there would be serious consequences and he could get seriously hurt.
<br><br>
Zen was unusually calm as he sat up cross legged in the cave and began to heal himself.
<br><br>
On one hand, the Vastness Mountain feared the Oneness Sky Palace. On the other hand, they also wanted to obtain the Truth Enlightenment. Going by this logic, Zen knew he was safe for the time being, but wasn't sure what they would do to deal with him next.
<br><br>
He had managed to get through it this time with No. 9527's help. But he might not make it the next time.
<br><br>
"I wonder if Master Athemar or Master Goran will come to save me," Zen murmured to himself as he stared at the dark cave wall.
<br><br>
The woman in red left the gloomy palace and disappeared at the palace gate in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Pillars formed by black iron swords sat atop the Vastness Mountain, holding a bluish black palace amidst them.
<br><br>
This was the center of the Vastness Mountain, the Mighty Sword Hall.
<br><br>
The woman appeared at the gate of this hall and quickly walked inside.
<br><br>
The guards of the hall, on seeing her approach, knelt down in unison.
<br><br>
"Good day, Lady Natasha!"
<br><br>
"Nice to meet you, Lady Natasha!"
<br><br>
"Lady Natasha, Emperor Gethin doesn't want to see anyone at the moment."
<br><br>
A mole sat on Natasha's forehead. Its maroon color made it look like blood was dripping down her forehead. The guards knew she was furious, but they had been instructed not to let anyone enter the Mighty Sword Hall.
<br><br>
They had no choice but to stop Natasha, even though they knew she was far above their station.
<br><br>
Natasha was nettled.
<br><br>
She waved a hand without even looking at them.
<br><br>
They were sent flying backwards and fell to the ground with a heavy thud.
<br><br>
A middle-aged man with a long beard sat on a large golden throne at the top of the Mighty Sword Hall. He looked energetic, his eyes shining sharp as blades.
<br><br>
This was Emperor Gethin, the head of the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
Two black shadows stood beside Gethin. It was hard to see their faces in the dim light. One could only vaguely make out their human shapes.
<br><br>
These two men were the leaders of the intelligence agency. They lowered their heads to whisper something to Gethin.
<br><br>
Gethin raised his hand. The two men had already noticed the beautiful lady walk in and stepped aside to merge into the shadows.
<br><br>
At the sight of Natasha's face, Gethin smiled gently and said, "Natasha, what makes you so angry?"
<br><br>
"That brat refused to tell us anything! He says he will only give us one hundred and fifty words!" Natasha spat out angrily.
<br><br>
Gethin stroked his long beard thoughtfully and then said, "What he says actually fits the information we first received."
<br><br>
"He must be lying!" Natasha said, her eyebrows shooting up.
<br><br>
She actually wasn't sure if Zen had lied or not. People like Natasha usually insisted on getting what they wanted. So she had chosen to believe that Zen had lied to her.
<br><br>
"So what if he lied? Didn't I send Arjun to help you?" Gethin asked.
<br><br>
Natasha's eyes flashed at the mention of Arjun's name. "I don't know what trick the brat played. Everything went smoothly when Arjun was extracting his memories. But he passed out before he could find out anything useful."
<br><br>
Zen's soul level was outstanding, but there was a huge difference between his soul and Arjun's, which was why Zen couldn't use his soul to attack Arjun. Natasha was puzzled at this and didn't know why Arjun had passed out.
<br><br>
Gethin's expression cleared, pure interest taking its place on his face. "He caused Arjun to pass out? Interesting! Bring Arjun here!"
<br><br>
Natasha could do nothing but follow Gethin's orders. She asked her people to bring Arjun to Gethin. He was soon carried into the Mighty Sword Hall.
<br><br>
Gethin raised his hand slightly and the unconscious Arjun floated up slowly. He pointed a finger at Arjun, a ray of brown light shooting into his mind. He stirred and it wasn't long before he began to wake up.
<br><br>
As he sat up and saw the man before him, Arjun was startled and then knelt down on the floor respectfully. "Greetings, Emperor Gethin!" he said.
<br><br>
"You have been using the Soul Searching Hand for many years, and you are already confident in its usage. Why can't you deal with a little guy who is still in the Lust World?" Gethin asked calmly.
<br><br>
When Arjun recalled what he had read in Zen's memories, his features convulsed back into shock.
<br><br>
"That bloke is not human at all!" he said, his eyes widening.
<br><br>
How could a person have so many memories? There were too many memories in the fragments. One of the memories was watching the sun rise and fall for ten billion years until the sun selfdestructed.
<br><br>
Zen was only over a hundred years old. How could he have watched the sun rise and fall for ten billion years? How could someone of this world do such a boring thing for so many years? Even the members of the Stone race, which had a long history, and the members of the Turtle race, which moved extremely slow, would not do such a thing.
<br><br>
At Arjun's words, Gethin, Natasha, and even the two leaders of the intelligence agency in the shadows were astonished. How could there be such bizarre memories in this world? "He has probably fused with a special Other Shore Token. Maybe these weird memories belong to that token," Gethin said hopefully, after thinking for a while. Most Other Shore Tokens held a certain number of memories.
<br><br>
And despite the hope with which he was talking, Gethin had never heard of an Other Shore Token possessing such a massive amount of memories.
<br><br>
"The question is how we can make Zen speak?" Natasha sighed.
<br><br>
One of the two leaders of the intelligence agency suggested, "There are many ways of making people talk, like using brutal corporal punishment. I don't think he can bear it."
<br><br>
Chapter 3215 Searching The Mountain The intelligence agency had plenty of tried and tested torture methods under their sleeves. They did not think that someone like Zen could withstand them.
<br><br>
Natasha, however, disagreed. "We already broke the rules when we took Zen to the Vastness Mountain," she said with a light shake of the head. "If he gets tortured under our watch, I'm sure it would be a big deal."
<br><br>
Just as Zen guessed, the people of the Vastness Mountain could only capture him, but they wouldn't dare to hurt him.
<br><br>
Gethin waved his hand and said, "We need to be careful. We can't just torture him. I think we should leave him to Barnaby."
<br><br>
The Vastness Mountain was one of the top three among the seven mountains. They were known as a force full of great talents.
<br><br>
Barnaby was among them. He was a powerful man who worked for Gethin, and his Other Shore Token possessed great power. It could penetrate an opponent's soul and send them into deep confusion. Compared to Arjun, Barnaby was much better. They would have better luck if they sought his help.
<br><br>
"But Barnaby is..." Natasha muttered with a surprised look on her face.
<br><br>
"Alright, invite him back," said Gethin with a glimmer in his eyes. "We don't have much time left. This is a rare opportunity."
<br><br>
Then, the tension in the room was disrupted by a muffled sound outside the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
Bang! A loud noise similar to the sound of thunder erupted.
<br><br>
Gethin and Natasha tensed at the sound of the muffled thud.
<br><br>
A black armed guard rushed inside the Mighty Sword Hall. "Emperor Gethin," he started as he knelt down in front of Gethin. "Two Oneness Governors are trying to destroy our mountain protecting array!"
<br><br>
"It must be Athemar and Goran. Are they out of their minds?" Natasha frowned.
<br><br>
From the shadows, the voice of a man sneered, "Is it because we've been too modest recently? Are they really willing to go this far? How dare they break into the Vastness Mountain?!"
<br><br>
Gethin's face darkened. His gaze turned stone cold. "We must have underestimated Zen's importance to them. Natasha, quickly ask Barnaby for help."
<br><br>
"Yes!" Natasha nodded as she ran out of the hall.
<br><br>
Gethin turned to the guard in black. "Remove the mountain protecting array," he ordered. "Fetch the two Oneness Governors and take them here."
<br><br>
Outside the Vastness Mountain, bright light covered the sky.
<br><br>
Upon careful observation, one could see that thousands of long swords glittered the heavens. This was the protecting array of the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
This array was powerful, but the two men that hovered were not going to back down so easily.
<br><br>
Athemar spread his long arms and a huge seal covered his back.
<br><br>
It was the original Imperial Sword Seal.
<br><br>
Behind Athemar, over one hundred long swords floated. When he activated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, the original seal on his back released many rays of large sword radiance, each extremely powerful.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! A ray of sword radiance flew right into the mountain. It trembled as its protecting array was harmed.
<br><br>
Beside him, Goran held a long sword. He quietly tried to sneak an attack.
<br><br>
His eyes shone like torches.
<br><br>
Each time the mountain trembled in weakness, Goran waved his sword.
<br><br>
The sword strike caused immense pressure to the array.
<br><br>
Athemar and Goran were Oneness Governors. It was unwise of them to attack the protecting array of the Vastness Mountain directly.
<br><br>
But they needed a quick way to rescue Zen. He was of great value to them, after all.
<br><br>
He was the only one who had deciphered the Truth Enlightenment. His special knowledge made him extra special to their group.
<br><br>
Just now, they politely requested to see Gethin outside the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
But the guards merely answered no. They said that the mountain was closed and no outsider was allowed to enter it.
<br><br>
With great rage, Athemar caused further damage to the Vastness Mountain as he continued to attack it.
<br><br>
Bang! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The mountain protecting array shook violently. Only a few hits and it would surely be destroyed.
<br><br>
Then, an armed guard ran towards them. "Stop!" he shouted with a pleading voice. "Don't attack the array anymore! Emperor Gethin agreed to meet you!"
<br><br>
Then, the light faded as the array was removed.
<br><br>
Athemar put away the Imperial Sword Seal, with his head held high.
<br><br>
Goran also put away his long sword. He smiled and said, "We already did so much harm to the mountain. I'm sure Gethin is furious. I doubt the negotiation would go smoothly."
<br><br>
Athemar stood his ground firmly. "As long as he hands over Zen, then things are fine. Otherwise, get ready to fight."
<br><br>
Goran shook his head. Athemar was acting like a typical member of the Flow Sword Sect: stubborn and rash. But Goran knew that even if they worked together, they would not be strong enough to win against the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
The two of them rushed towards the mountain top and entered the Mighty Sword Hall.
<br><br>
Athemar tried to conceal his anger with a curt smile. "Greetings, Emperor Gethin," he greeted as he reached his hands out.
<br><br>
Oneness Governors were normally perceived as inferior to a mountain master. However, Oneness Governors were conferred by Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself. Because of that, they were considered powerhouses. They did not have to humble themselves too much in front of Gethin.
<br><br>
Gethin sat on the golden throne. He ignored Athemar's salute and instead slapped his hand on the throne's armrest. "That is the way how you greet me? By trying to destroy my mountain protecting array?"
<br><br>
Gethin's attitude amused Goran, but Goran tried his best to maintain a serious face. He knew that Gethin was being exaggerated.
<br><br>
Athemar didn't buy his reactions as well. "Well, I didn't come here for niceties as well. We know Zen is here and we merely want to rescue him.
<br><br>
Your mountain protecting array was obviously in the way so I did what I had to do. We hope you could forgive us."
<br><br>
Athemar could tell that Gethin was merely stalling for time.
<br><br>
"Forgive you? Why would I forgive you so easily?" Gethin sneered.
<br><br>
Athemar remained unfazed. "I don't care whether you forgive me or not," he remarked. "Just hand over Zen today. Let's deal with the damages next time."
<br><br>
Gethin was sensing just how significant Zen was to them. He knew they wouldn't give up without a fight. He just didn't expect Athemar to be so rude.
<br><br>
With a straight face, Gethin said, "Zen is not here. You must have come to the wrong place."
<br><br>
"Don't lie. I know he's here. If we search the mountain, I'm sure we can find Zen," Athemar insisted.
<br><br>
"Search the mountain?" Gethin's face grew red with fury. A terrifying aura filled the Mighty Sword Hall. He said in a sinister tone, "The Vastness Mountain is as old as the Oneness Sky Palace. I've lived far longer than Eastern Emperor Taiyi in the Bloom Divine Province! No one dares to threaten me like that! No one is allowed to search my territory!"
<br><br>
Goran tried to keep a straight face, but Gethin's strong aura was starting to suffocate him.
<br><br>
"Well," Athemar sneered, "I guess today's an exception."
<br><br>
Chapter 3216 Unexpected Guests Zen sat in the dark cave. The lid above opened once again, allowing a ray of light to pierce through from above.
<br><br>
"Come up!"
<br><br>
a strange voice whispered from the entrance of the cave.
<br><br>
Zen, who sat cross legged, turned a deaf ear to the voice.
<br><br>
Phew! An invisible force drew Zen up from the bottom of the cave and he fell into the palace with a thud.
<br><br>
Pushing himself to his feet, he found Natasha standing not far off. He smiled at her and said, "We meet again."
<br><br>
Zen's fearlessness upset Natasha to her core.
<br><br>
Athemar and Goran had arrived at the Vastness Mountain too soon. Time was running out.
<br><br>
Barnaby had been practicing on the Other Shore. Natasha had forced him to leave it for now to join her.
<br><br>
"Barnaby, we need your help. But don't kill him," Natasha called out.
<br><br>
A tall, thick man appeared from behind Natasha.
<br><br>
He was dressed in a white robe, with eyes drawn on it. The eyes seemed embedded in the robe and were unnervingly real.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, Lady Natasha. He is just a young man in the Lust World,"
<br><br>
Barnaby said with a slight smirk.
<br><br>
She wanted to remind him of what had happened to Arjun, but given his cultivation base and strength, she thought he should have no difficulty in dealing with Zen.
<br><br>
Zen tensed up with caution when he saw Barnaby.
<br><br>
Arjun, one of the best warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm, had been very powerful in Zen's eyes. But he was unable to figure out Barnaby's real strength. He figured Barnaby was probably as strong as Athemar.
<br><br>
Barnaby smiled nicely as he walked up to Zen, which was very disconcerting. "Once a creature is born, it will have its memory. But it's only a dream. Just relax. This can be very easy."
<br><br>
As he spoke, seven eyes on his white robe snapped open. They didn't look like eyes on a robe anymore; they looked real.
<br><br>
Zen looked into them and a trance immediately overtook him.
<br><br>
"Oh no! Don't look into the eyes!"
<br><br>
Zen's heart seized as he closed his eyes as fast as he could.
<br><br>
When they were closed, everything else disappeared but the eyes. They kept coming closer and closer.
<br><br>
"It's useless, Zen. It's the Illusory Eyes. Closing your eyes won't help," said No. 9527.
<br><br>
"Then what should I do?" Zen asked anxiously.
<br><br>
His techniques and understanding in the soul level were quite limited.
<br><br>
"The Flow Swordsmanship may help you resist them, but unfortunately, you haven't fully mastered it yet. This is troublesome. You can try the Authentic Visual World," No. 9527 suggested.
<br><br>
No. 9527 knew how to deal with those as powerful as Arjun, but it couldn't defeat a powerhouse like Barnaby. It could only offer ideas.
<br><br>
"I can create the happiest illusion, and make the fragile strong. This new world will be amazing for you," Barnaby whispered gently, as if Zen was a close friend he cared for greatly.
<br><br>
Zen still wore the same dreamy look on his face.
<br><br>
It was as if he had returned to the divine land and established a new great clan in the center of the Time Sea.
<br><br>
He no longer pursued ultimate power and never experienced hardships.
<br><br>
Natasha's lips curled into a sneer. "You're indeed an amazing master, Barnaby. This stubborn man is no match for you."
<br><br>
Barnaby paid her words no mind and turned to look at her. He smiled and lifted a finger to shush her. "Lady Natasha, please don't make a sound. It will be done soon."
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen opened his eyes, and the demonic eye in his inner world was activated. A white light flashed in his right eye.
<br><br>
All the illusions shattered into pieces. He was no longer in a trance and his eyes cleared.
<br><br>
"That was close! I was almost trapped!" Zen broke out in a cold sweat.
<br><br>
The faces of Natasha and Barnaby froze.
<br><br>
Barnaby stared at Zen, full of disbelief and confusion.
<br><br>
Even the powerful masters at the Chaotic Source Realm who had stepped into the Desire World found it impossible to break his illusions. How could Zen, who had just stepped into the Lust World, accomplish it? "Barnaby, what's going on?" Natasha asked.
<br><br>
She didn't know how much longer Gethin could stall. Time was running out; there was no room for error.
<br><br>
"It's just a small hiccup," Barnaby said, sizing Zen up. "He probably has an Other Shore Token capable of destroying the illusions."
<br><br>
An Other Shore Token of that kind was very rare. Barnaby was startled to learn Zen had one.
<br><br>
"What should we do?" Natasha asked, frowning intensely and staring at Zen.
<br><br>
"Don't worry," Barnaby reassured her confidently. He then slowly lifted his white robe.
<br><br>
The eyes on it opened one after another.
<br><br>
Inside the Mighty Sword Hall, a powerful aura filled the air.
<br><br>
Gethin still sat in his golden throne, like a slumbering dragon, ready to devour anything that dared disturb him.
<br><br>
Black fog began gradually spreading from the shadows beside him, the killing intent wandering along it. Suddenly, two leaders of the intelligence agency appeared.
<br><br>
"Athemar, life has been too smooth for you these past years. It seems you have forgotten who you are!" Gethin flared with anger. "I'd like to see how you manage to walk out of here today!"
<br><br>
Sensing the killing intent in the black fog, Goran was on high alert and more cautious than ever.
<br><br>
If Gethin really took action, Athemar and Goran would be too weak to fight back.
<br><br>
Just then, another person could be heard walking in from outside the Mighty Sword Hall.
<br><br>
He had a pair of bright piercing eyes. It was none other than Winchell of the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Gathin laughed grimly when he saw Winchell. "Oh? The Origin Mountain wants to get involved too?" he asked, sniggering.
<br><br>
Winchell cupped his hands to Gethin and said, "Goran is my best friend. I have to stand by his side and help if I am needed."
<br><br>
"It's not enough. It's far from enough for the three of you to do anything here," said Gethin, shaking his head.
<br><br>
Although Winchell was not a Oneness Governor, he was almost as strong as Athemar and Goran. But they were far from being able to contend with Gethin, even if they worked together. Moreover, there were countless masters in the Vastness Mountain. The two leaders of the intelligence agency, for example, were not weak.
<br><br>
"Is it enough if I join them?"
<br><br>
an old voice asked.
<br><br>
A stooping old woman came in from the door of the Mighty Sword Hall, clutching a thin walking stick.
<br><br>
"Grandma, slow down," Dorothy said, holding the old woman by her arm as she walked her in slowly.
<br><br>
When Gethin saw the old woman, the corners of his eyes twitched.
<br><br>
Gethin had decided that nothing and no one would stand in his way of getting the Truth Enlightenment. However, the old woman's arrival had startled him to be sure. This was going to be a tough situation.
<br><br>
Chapter 3217 Madam Yasamin Both Athemar and Goran were surprised to see the old lady. Their eyes lit up with delight.
<br><br>
As soon as Calum informed Athemar that Zen had been abducted, and by whom, Athemar had gone to Goran to ask him to accompany him to the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
Goran immediately agreed. Before leaving, he went to Winchell to tell him of Zen's abduction too.
<br><br>
What happened next was completely unexpected. To the astonishment of Goran and Athemar, Winchell didn't come alone. He had brought the head of the Origin Mountain with him.
<br><br>
The Origin Mountain was headed by Yasamin, whose power was second only to that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the great leader of the Oneness Sky Palace. Yasamin herself held an important position in the Oneness Sky Palace as well.
<br><br>
It was generally known that the stature and glory of the Oneness Sky Palace could be attributed, in part, to the efforts of Yasamin. Indeed, many said at least half of the credit for all the achievements of the Oneness Sky Palace should go to Yasamin.
<br><br>
"I didn't expect that Madam Yasamin would take an interest in a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect," Gethin said, stepping down from the golden throne.
<br><br>
He went to Yasamin and reached out a hand to support her.
<br><br>
The old lady grunted, ignoring Gethin's help. "No need," Yasamin said, making her way towards the throne.
<br><br>
Gethin cursed her inwardly, but he forced a smile and followed behind Yasamin.
<br><br>
After a few moments, Dorothy helped Yasmin to take her seat on the golden throne.
<br><br>
Yasamin sat, exhaling heavily. Then she bent and used her long, thin stick to poke the golden engravings around the throne. Cracks formed on the ground where her stick touched it. "Don't hide now, you two little assholes! Come out!"
<br><br>
There was a puffing sound.
<br><br>
Two people staggered out of the shadows where they had been hiding, falling to the ground. They were two leaders of the intelligence agency.
<br><br>
As soon as they were exposed, they scrambled to their feet and bowed to Yasamin, not daring to show the slightest hint of disrespect.
<br><br>
Although most of the people in the Oneness Sky Palace had never even seen Yasamin, everyone had heard of her legend.
<br><br>
The thin walking stick she always carried around was her weapon. It was called the Gliding Dragon Sword.
<br><br>
She was famous for many outstanding feats, including the creation of the Origin Swordsmanship. At one time she had capably guarded the Dragon Cliff alone. People still spoke with awe of how she had killed in one strike a powerful master who lived many provinces away, using the Origin Deity Attack. Many thought of her as the hero who stabilized chaos.
<br><br>
Moreover, her Other Shore Token was a strengthening type — it had no special ability, but it contained incomparably massive divine megatons of force. Anyone who met her was struck by the formidable impression she made on others.
<br><br>
Thus, although she looked like a weak old woman on the verge of death, her reputation always preceded her, and everyone went to great lengths to treat her with the proper respect.
<br><br>
Yasamin didn't waste time with small talk. "Hand Zen over!"
<br><br>
she ordered from her perch on the golden throne.
<br><br>
Gethin took a deep breath. He had no choice. Even though Yasamin was legendary and the head of the Origin Mountain, he could not give in and just hand Zen over without a fight.
<br><br>
He decided to try dissembling first. He gave her a wry smile and said, "Madam Yasamin, you have just arrived here. Don't you want to talk about it? What makes you so sure that Zen is even here?"
<br><br>
Yasamin was unmoved. "I don't need to explain anything to you. I repeat, hand Zen over now. I don't care what your reasons were for abducting him."
<br><br>
She looked coldly at Gethin, daring him to defy her. She was used to dominating everyone around her, and Gethin was no exception.
<br><br>
Gethin wasn't immune to the pressure. Indeed, if it had been about anyone else, Gethin might have acquiesced to Yasamin's request. However, he couldn't this time. This was about the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
"I apologize, Madam Yasamin, but I have no idea what you're talking about.
<br><br>
I'm afraid I cannot hand over someone we don't have," Gethin said, forcing his voice to stay calm.
<br><br>
Athemar, Goran and Winchell exchanged glances. They knew he was lying, but couldn't imagine why he would dare to lie to Yasamin.
<br><br>
It seemed that Gethin was absolutely determined to obtain the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Or was this about something else? Was there some other plot involved? They wondered what would happen if Gethin kept arguing with Yasamin.
<br><br>
Yasamin snorted. "I don't care about your denials. Winchell! Go and search the Vastness Mountain for Zen," she ordered.
<br><br>
Winchell snapped to attention. "Yes, Madam Yasamin!" he said.
<br><br>
Gethin was losing his cool. Dropping some of his deference, he said coldly, "Madam Yasamin, this is not reasonable at all. We are not responsible for anyone you might be looking for. Is the Origin Mountain superior to the Oneness Sky Palace? Do you have the right to impose your will on us?"
<br><br>
The seven mountains were the alliance formed by Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
No one could command all seven mountains except Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who was the leader of the alliance.
<br><br>
Although Yasamin had incredible strength and could probably go head-tohead with Eastern Emperor Taiyi in terms of ability, she still had no power to violate the rules of the alliance. She was overstepping her authority.
<br><br>
What would the heads of the other mountains think when they heard what Yasamin had done in the Vastness Mountain? At Gethin's words, a slight look of hesitation appeared in Yasamin's wrinkled face.
<br><br>
Dorothy pursed her lips. She thought, 'Gethin is truly cunning. What he said is true, and that will make it harder for grandma to deal with him. But we can't give up on Zen...' She wore a look of anxiety as she wondered where exactly Zen was and what had happened to him.
<br><br>
Athemar and Goran also understood the import of Gethin's words and felt worried. They hadn't expected him to have the nerve to stand up to Yasamin like that.
<br><br>
There was a sudden blast of sound.
<br><br>
Two people appeared in front of the Mighty Sword Hall, moving too quickly to be identified by the naked eye.
<br><br>
Gethin and the two leaders of the intelligence agency felt a surge of tension, worried about who were coming. They wished no more people would get involved in this.
<br><br>
Chapter 3218 The Edict Of Eastern Emperor Taiyi Since Athemar's arrival, more and more people had been coming to Vastness Mountain to look for Zen.
<br><br>
All who came were strong, respected warriors of high ranks. Gethin stared at the newcomers, wondering who they were. Gethin scowled inwardly.
<br><br>
Had he known that so many would be coming, he would have ordered the activation of the mountain-protecting array.
<br><br>
As the two people came to a stop at the gate, he took a deep breath, fortifying himself.
<br><br>
Like Gethin, everyone was watching the newcomers at the gate of the hall.
<br><br>
One of them was none other than Master Hai, who was in charge of distributing the flags in Dragon City.
<br><br>
Master Hai didn't intimidate Gethin, but unfortunately, he was not alone.
<br><br>
Next to Master Hai stood a beautiful lady wearing a purple dress and a disarming smile. It was Flamine.
<br><br>
By now, Gethin was totally confused. Who was Zen? Why was he so significant? Wasn't he just a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect? Both the Origin Mountain and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had sent representatives for him, which Gethin found deeply unsettling.
<br><br>
Why? What made Zen so special? Flamine, still smiling, floated in the air, her ribbon fluttering in the wind.
<br><br>
She looked like a lovely fairy from a classic painting.
<br><br>
She flew towards them, saying lightly, "That young man is always involved in some kind of trouble, isn't he? What has he done to Vastness Mountain? Why did you take him?"
<br><br>
As she entered, everyone present greeted her, including Athemar, Gethin, Goran and the leaders of the intelligence agency. Dorothy gave her a prim salute, and Yasamin gave her a curt nod.
<br><br>
After all, Flamine was the favorite concubine of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. She was now the only person who could meet with him.
<br><br>
Gethin sighed. Flamine's arrival and her status as Taiyi's favored concubine signaled the end of his resistance. He wondered whether Barnaby had already taken action. Had he obtained the Truth Enlightenment? Flamine flew to Yasamin and landed beside her, by the throne at one end of the Mighty Sword Hall. A golden token materialized in Flamine's hand. She held it up and spoke loudly, "This is an edict from Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Gethin, you are commanded to release Zen immediately!"
<br><br>
Gethin stared at her, the wheels turning in his head. The edict was unequivocal, but perhaps he could stall and buy Barnaby more time.
<br><br>
After a moment, he pasted a smile onto his face. "Lady Flamine, I can't help but wonder why Zen is so important? Who is he that Eastern Emperor Taiyi would issue an edict and send you in person to enforce it?"
<br><br>
Flamine smiled back. "Zen met my daughter earlier in the Phoenix Palace. I think the two of them are a good match! So as soon as I received the news from Master Hai, I decided to see how I could help Zen. It's not so strange, is it, to want to assist someone who may very well be my son-in-law in the future?"
<br><br>
Flamine's reasoning left Athemar, Goran, Winchell, and Master Hai dumbfounded. They raised their eyebrows at each other, lost for words.
<br><br>
At Flamine's words, Dorothy's lips quivered, and she blinked quickly.
<br><br>
Her grandmother Yasamin observed her expression and frowned.
<br><br>
She could feel how unhappy Dorothy was.
<br><br>
In her long rule over Origin Mountain, Yasamin had become more and more unsociable, but there was one person whom she still treated with kindness —her granddaughter, for whom she felt a great love.
<br><br>
The people of Origin Mountain tended to walk on eggshells around Yasamin, for they were all afraid of her.
<br><br>
Winchell, for instance, hadn't dared to inform her himself about Zen's abduction. He had told Dorothy instead, and he had been as surprised as anyone when Yasamin deigned to go to Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
It showed just how much she cared about Dorothy. .
<br><br>
In the days after Dorothy first met Zen in the Sea of Truth, she had often brought him up in conversations with Yasamin. She told her grandmother all about Zen and her experience with him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen had gone on to save Winchell's son, and then he had made it to the Other Shore. His successful exploits delighted Dorothy and she loved talking with her grandmother about him.
<br><br>
But when Yasamin asked Dorothy directly whether she had a crush on Zen, Dorothy would either blush and stammer and evade the topic, or get bothered and deny it outright.
<br><br>
Still, Yasamin was wise and experienced, and she couldn't help but know how Dorothy felt about Zen.
<br><br>
Dorothy's stories had captured her attention and made her interested in getting to know Zen, but Zen hadn't gone to Origin Mountain. Instead, he'd joined in the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
Now, seeing her granddaughter's unhappiness at Flamine's declaration, Yasamin was upset. She shot Flamine a dark look and said, "It's not advisable to marry someone with nonhuman blood! We can't deny that the purity of one's blood is important. My Dora's blood is the purest!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3219 Argue The Oneness Sky Palace was a place where human forces from all over the world gathered. Each mountain had its own bloodline.
<br><br>
But Elvinia's bloodline was different. Her blood mostly belonged to the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
It was taboo to talk about Elvinia's bloodline in the Phoenix Palace. Even Flamine took great care not to mention any of it in her daily life.
<br><br>
Flamine had become furious when Yasamin had mocked Elvinia's bloodline to her face. And when Yasamin had mentioned Dorothy, Flamine searched Dorothy's face, trying to understand something from it. "The Sun Crow race are blessed by the sun and are favored by fate. Elvinia's talent is the best among all the women. She has a bright future. How could she be compared to a bumpkin?"
<br><br>
Elvinia and Dorothy were both beautiful in their own way. One was noble and lofty while the other was passionate. But it was obvious that Elvinia was superior to Dorothy in terms of talent.
<br><br>
Yasamin knocked her cane on the ground, causing the Mighty Sword Hall to tremble.
<br><br>
"It's just Instant Enlightenment. But my Dora is-"
<br><br>
Yasamin broke off.
<br><br>
A huge secret was sealed within Dorothy's soul that was limiting her talent.
<br><br>
The seal would be removed only when her soul crossed the Lust World, stepped into the Desire World, and then reached the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
But she could not reveal this secret now.
<br><br>
"But what?" Flamine smiled smugly and said, "The Instant Enlightenment is not easy to achieve. There are only fourteen warriors who have become capable of the Instant Enlightenment in the Oneness Sky Palace over the years. Moreover, Elvinia can not only achieve Instant Enlightenment on the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, she might also achieve Instant Enlightenment on the Truth of Cultivation Nature. It's just that she is too young right now, which is why I don't allow her to practice it."
<br><br>
There was probably no other talent who could achieve Instant Enlightenment on two Truths of Godly Ways in the Oneness Sky Palace. It really was an amazing ability.
<br><br>
"So what? Does marriage depend on talent? Because then the couple can fight all day long?".
<br><br>
Gethin's eyes widened in confusion as he watched Flamine and Yasamin bickering with each other. He had no idea what they were quarreling about.
<br><br>
He had asked the question to buy more time. He hadn't expected it to start a fight between them! The two leaders of the intelligence agency looked on, astonished. It was strange to them that they were fighting for trifles when the two parties were at daggers drawn.
<br><br>
Who the hell was this Zen? Why were both the Origin Mountain and the Oneness Mountain so hell bent on wanting him to marry their precious girls? Athemar, Winchell, and the others looked on, speechless.
<br><br>
Athemar knew a little about Zen and Dorothy's relationship. The Origin Mountain had fought for Zen because Dorothy had met Zen before Athemar had. But Athemar had outright dismissed it. After all, Zen had already joined his Sword Light Palace.
<br><br>
But what about Elvinia? On the day of the Seven Mountains Meeting, Zen had defeated Elvinia. Her defeat had pissed her off and she had left in a huff.
<br><br>
Why would Flamine favor him?. Athemar cleared his throat and said, "I think we should look for Zen first."
<br><br>
Dorothy, who was standing next to her grandmother, couldn't bear for the argument to drag anymore. She was a shy girl and to see her grandmother argue with someone over her marriage depressed her to no end. She shook Yasamin's arm and said, "Grandma, stop it. We don't even know if Zen is still safe!"
<br><br>
It was then that Flamine remembered what she had come here for. She turned to Gethin and said, "Gethin, please hand Zen over to us."
<br><br>
Gethin had had more time to think as they argued. He was now calmer as he said, "I really don't know about Zen being brought into the Vastness Mountain. If you still have doubts, you can search the mountain by yourselves."
<br><br>
Gethin was still playing the fool, something that gladdened Athemar. He sneered as he said, "It's not that difficult to find Zen."
<br><br>
Athemar, in order to protect Zen, had cast a Latent Theurgy on Zen when he had given him the Flow Swordsmanship.
<br><br>
This Latent Theurgy was called the Nirvana Strike. Zen could use this strike to save himself in desperate situations.
<br><br>
Athemar could feel the Latent Theurgy he had cast on Zen as long as they were close to each other, which was why he had proposed to search the mountain in the beginning. With his ability, it wouldn't have taken him long to find Zen.
<br><br>
But things had gotten rough when Gethin stopped him.
<br><br>
Athemar flew into the sky.
<br><br>
He transformed into a light and hovered around the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
He circled the mountain, beginning from the top and towards the bottom.
<br><br>
Athemar's eyes lit up. He had sensed the Latent Theurgy on the other side of the Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
"There he is!"
<br><br>
Once he had locked on the position, he began to make his way to Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3220 Lose In the dark palace, Zen was caught in illusions.
<br><br>
He had shattered Barnaby's first attack with his Authentic Visual World, so for his second offensive, Barnaby had used sixty percent of his strength.
<br><br>
Before Zen could even activate the demonic eye, he had been completely trapped within the illusions again.
<br><br>
He could no longer tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Such was Barnaby's strength.
<br><br>
Being under Barnaby's control, Zen suddenly felt a sharp pain in his soul.
<br><br>
It made him tremble and get rid of the illusions.
<br><br>
"There is another soul in his mind!" Barnaby exclaimed in shock.
<br><br>
The one causing the pain was No. 9527.
<br><br>
No. 9527 was left with no choice on seeing Zen trapped in the illusions. It had to give his soul a ferocious blow, even at the risk of exposing itself.
<br><br>
The attack, though not very powerful, was effective. It had at least brought Zen back to his senses.
<br><br>
"What happened?" Natasha asked impatiently.
<br><br>
She couldn't fathom why a young man of the Lust World would cause Barnaby so much trouble.
<br><br>
Barnaby's face darkened.
<br><br>
He had tried to deal with Zen but his methods didn't work. He felt terribly ashamed by his failure.
<br><br>
He realized he couldn't afford to underestimate Zen in any way.
<br><br>
He was in no mood to analyze the soul hiding within Zen's body, as he abruptly shook his white robe.
<br><br>
A big black and white eye emerged on the top of his head, like a human's.
<br><br>
This was his Other Shore Token; the Illusory Eye.
<br><br>
"Lady Natasha, take a few steps back please," Barnaby said politely.
<br><br>
Natasha and the others in black stepped back without hesitation, filled with fear of his Illusory Eye.
<br><br>
Barnaby had set his mind on using one hundred percent of his strength this time. He was sure if he didn't hold back, there'd be no possible way Zen could escape the illusions.
<br><br>
"Good luck," No. 9527 said helplessly. It had done all it could.
<br><br>
Zen's heart sank in defeat as he looked at the Illusory Eye. He knew this time, he was doomed.
<br><br>
The Illusory Eye blinked and a swirl of patterns took shape in it. Zen followed and blinked his eyes involuntarily.
<br><br>
When the Illusory Eye blinked again, he blinked again too.
<br><br>
"What's going on?"
<br><br>
This time, Zen could do nothing to resist. His eyes glazed over and turned dull as they were lost to him.
<br><br>
Barnaby couldn't bear having failed twice already. If he had failed once more, he felt he would have smashed his head through a wall.
<br><br>
"Now follow me to explore the secrets of the extreme joy," Barnaby recited.
<br><br>
Zen, like a puppet, repeated back, "I will follow you to explore the secrets of the extreme joy."
<br><br>
"Obey my orders," Barnaby continued.
<br><br>
"I will obey your orders," Zen replied zombified.
<br><br>
"Give me the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent,"
<br><br>
Barnaby ordered, shooting a devious smile at Natasha.
<br><br>
Her face lit up. With a wave of her hand, the brush and ink floated towards Zen.
<br><br>
He took the brush and began scribbling on the white paper.
<br><br>
Word by word, the Truth Enlightenment appeared.
<br><br>
"Finally we've got it!"
<br><br>
Natasha shrieked excitedly.
<br><br>
Finally, after so much trouble and effort, they had the Truth Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Twenty words.
<br><br>
Fifty words.
<br><br>
Eighty words.
<br><br>
The paper was filled with more and more words.
<br><br>
Just as Zen finished writing more than one hundred words, Barnaby and Natasha sensed something. Suddenly, their faces changed and they were no longer so excited and confident.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The brush, ink and paper flew back towards Natasha at once. "Get Zen out of here!" she bellowed.
<br><br>
Barnaby began waving his arms and was about to lead Zen to an escape when a loud explosion rang out from the ceiling of the palace.
<br><br>
Bang! The ceiling cracked.
<br><br>
Bang! A huge hole opened as the ceiling was destroyed by the second explosion.
<br><br>
Athemar then descended through the hole.
<br><br>
Barnaby still tried to lead Zen away. Athemar noticed his shuffling and a stern expression took over his face as he gestured forward towards them.
<br><br>
A touch of sword radiance turned into thousands of waves and rushed at Barnaby to stop him in his tracks.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Natasha gently stretched her body.
<br><br>
The space in the palace began to twist. The waves of the sword radiance released by Athemar were cut into several pieces, swishing about madly.
<br><br>
"Even your Emperor Gethin has given up but you still choose to struggle.
<br><br>
Do you really want to die?"
<br><br>
Athemar was truly infuriated.
<br><br>
He stamped his foot down hard, and a circle of sword marks appeared around him.
<br><br>
In a flash, countless mysterious textures spread throughout the palace. The bodies of the men in black robes, Natasha, and even Barnaby and Zen were engulfed in the strange textures.
<br><br>
Splash! The palace was quite sturdy. Athemar had struck it twice in order to enter earlier.
<br><br>
Now, the palace collapsed in an instant, turning to a mess of tiny shards.
<br><br>
The shards were the same as the textures that Athemar had set, their edges as sharp and smooth as knives.
<br><br>
Chapter 3221 An Explanation Nearly all of the palace had disintegrated. Only Zen, Barnaby, Natasha, and the men in black remained intact.
<br><br>
From the looks if it, Athemar only needed to activate a simple command to dissolve them into pieces as well.
<br><br>
Everyone stood frozen, careful not to make even the smallest movement.
<br><br>
Barnaby wasn't incredibly inferior to Athemar, but his special ability, the Illusory Eye was almost useless during a face-to-face battle. If he really fought with Athemar head-on, he'd probably lose to him.
<br><br>
Natasha was definitely powerful, but not as powerful as Athemar.
<br><br>
The men in black were the backbone of the intelligence agency. They were warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm and they were unable to challenge Athemar.
<br><br>
Since Athemar had told them that Gethin had already given up, none of them could resist. They would easily die if they did.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Barnaby withdrew his Illusory Eye.
<br><br>
The illusion went away and Zen reverted back to normal.
<br><br>
He finally saw Athemar who was standing not far away. "Master Athemar!"
<br><br>
he greeted enthusiastically.
<br><br>
"Are you all right?" Athemar asked with concern.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head and smiled. "I'll be alright," he assured.
<br><br>
"This is my fault. I did not expect that they'd have the audacity to take you away." Athemar shifted his glance towards Natasha and Barnaby and added, "Don't let me see Holden again if you don't want him to suffer."
<br><br>
Athemar couldn't deal with Gethin, but he had his confidence in beating Holden.
<br><br>
"Let's go!" Athemar said to Zen.
<br><br>
"Where are we going, Master Athemar?" Zen inquired.
<br><br>
"To the Mighty Sword Hall. We can't let them think that they can get away easily," Athemar replied coldly.
<br><br>
Then, he grabbed Zen as they flew up swiftly.
<br><br>
Barnaby straightened his robe, ensuring that it was crisp and perfect. He realized just how strong Athemar had become and how little progress he had been through in comparison in the past few years. Suddenly, sadness washed over him.
<br><br>
"I'll go to the Mighty Sword Hall, too," announced Natasha.
<br><br>
Gethin would have never allowed Athemar to come. Someone must have forced him to do it.
<br><br>
Athemar took Zen to have Gethin explain. What they did not know was that Natasha would soon be standing beside Gethin ready to defend her husband.
<br><br>
When Zen was brought into the Mighty Sword Hall, Athemar sneered.
<br><br>
"Emperor Gethin, you said with absolute certainty that Zen wasn't here.
<br><br>
Then who is this guy?"
<br><br>
Athemar tried his best to sound as polite as he could be.
<br><br>
Gethin had no defense. He merely shrugged his shoulders and acted innocent. "I really was kept in the dark about this." He turned to the others behind him. "Why is he here? Would you know?"
<br><br>
Yasamin responded from her golden throne, "Quit playing dumb. You can't save yourself by lying."
<br><br>
Flamine added, "Emperor Gethin, please explain yourself."
<br><br>
Gethin's face felt hot. As a man occupying a high position, he wasn't used to being confronted.
<br><br>
He knew they wouldn't let the matter go so easily.
<br><br>
Neither Yasamin, Flamine, nor Athemar would let go of this matter just because Zen had returned unharmed. They needed an explanation from Gethin.
<br><br>
Despite the pressures, Gethin maintained his calm.
<br><br>
He kept silent and fixed his eyes on the exit of the hall.
<br><br>
Natasha came rushing in. She went straight towards Gethin and knelt down in front of him.
<br><br>
"What's going on, Natasha?" Gethin asked, pretending that he knew nothing.
<br><br>
"This is all my fault," Natasha cried. "I shouldn't have kidnapped Zen and taken him to the Vastness Mountain. I only did it to avenge Marco's death.
<br><br>
I'm so sorry to have caused you trouble!"
<br><br>
Tears poured down her face.
<br><br>
"Marco's death? What happened to Marco?" Gethin asked in shock.
<br><br>
Natasha wiped her tears as she got up on her feet. "He killed him." She pointed at Zen and went on to tell his husband how their son had died a tragic death.
<br><br>
Chapter 3222 The Chaotic Source World Yasamin and Flamine were poker-faced.
<br><br>
Everyone present knew that Natasha and Gethin were putting on a show.
<br><br>
Only those who didn't know the truth might be deceived by their act.
<br><br>
And whatever the reason, Zen had killed Marco.
<br><br>
But Marco's death wasn't a loss to Gethin.
<br><br>
Dorothy couldn't stand it any longer. She interrupted Natasha and said, "Marco brought trouble upon himself. He deserved it. Some time ago on the Other Shore, Zen didn't want any enmity with him, but Marco attacked Zen with the intention of killing him. This time, Zen must have had no choice but to fight back and kill him."
<br><br>
Zen knew what Natasha was driving at. If he didn't fight back, others would think he was in the wrong.
<br><br>
"Marco followed me all the way to the Clear Lake to try and kill me. He even lured me into the battle ring. Lady Natasha, it was fine you didn't stop your son from killing others, but no one was allowed to fight back? How is it reasonable?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Natasha's eyes flashed. She was trying to cover up the Vastness Mountain's guilt and Zen's cutting reply was exactly what she wanted. "No matter what Marco did, he was my son. Isn't it reasonable for me to take revenge for his death? I had no other choice but to bring you here. I wasn't expecting so many people to blame me!"
<br><br>
Zen cursed inwardly, 'You don't care about your son's life. All you want is the Truth Enlightenment.' Natasha's words did make sense.
<br><br>
As a mother, she was furious but all she could do was bringing Zen to the Vastness Mountain. And she was justified in doing so.
<br><br>
Athemar, Flamine, and Yasamin were finding it difficult to find reasons for making a fuss about it.
<br><br>
"Tit for tat. Marco wanted to kill Zen but Zen killed him instead. It is justified that Lady Natasha created problems for Zen as a way of revenge.
<br><br>
But since Zen is fine at the moment, I think it would be better for us to let it go for now," Flamine said, in an attempt to make the final judgment.
<br><br>
Everyone present was intelligent and she knew that she couldn't get a satisfactory answer for Zen.
<br><br>
If Natasha continued to act the way she had so far, she would gain the upper hand. That was why Flamine thought it better to put an end to this thing right away.
<br><br>
Clasping his hands behind his back, Gethin sighed, "I didn't teach my son well, or else he wouldn't have been in trouble. I'm sorry for the trouble caused to you, Lady Flamine, Madam Yasamin."
<br><br>
Yasamin waved a hand at the golden throne. Dorothy helped her up and they both walked up to Zen.
<br><br>
Dorothy had told her all about Zen even when he was still in the divine land, but this was the first time that Yasamin had seen him.
<br><br>
She looked Zen up and down with her old eyes, and her crumpled face relaxed as she said, "The first time I heard of you, you had just entered the Sea of Truth. Your cultivation base has increased at a very high speed. Am I right in saying that you will soon have the Indigo Soul?"
<br><br>
Zen folded his hands in respect and bowed to Yasamin. "Yes, but it will take some more time," he said.
<br><br>
One's Soul of Light gradually turned from brown to indigo purple as they continued to cultivate. Humans usually called it the Indigo Soul.
<br><br>
After the Seven Mountains Meeting, Zen had once again gone to the temple and obtained some soul crystal. His Soul of Light was now emitting a faint purple light.
<br><br>
Of late, Zen hadn't been to the Other Shore much and because of this, he hadn't made it to the next stage. Nobody knew his limits but it would be a while before his Soul of Light became an Indigo Soul.
<br><br>
"I have prepared soul crystal for Dora to help her step into the Desire World. Looks like I need to prepare some for you as well," Yasamin said.
<br><br>
Zen was confused.
<br><br>
The soul crystal Yasamin had prepared would be more than enough to help Dorothy enter the Desire World. It must be a very big one and he thought it was inappropriate for him to accept such a gift.
<br><br>
Zen bowed to Yasamin once again and said, "It's very kind of you, Madam Yasamin, but I am in no hurry to practice."
<br><br>
The old lady shook her head and said with a smile, "The Chaotic Source World is about to reopen. You can't miss such a good opportunity. I have two tickets, one for you, and the other for Dora. Only this way can I rest assured. Please don't refuse this."
<br><br>
Dorothy said, "Zen, it will take ten years for the Chaotic Source World to open again. It doesn't matter if you miss out on it now but you will have to wait for ten more years for the next one. Don't refuse my grandma's kindness."
<br><br>
Zen knew that one had to break through to the Chaotic Source Realm after entering the Desire World.
<br><br>
That was a type of complete reinforcement for the corporeal body. Only after this reinforcement could one bear more Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
But he didn't know how to do it.
<br><br>
Dorothy was right. The Chaotic Source World opened once in ten years and he couldn't miss such an opportunity.
<br><br>
Flamine made her way to Zen's side and smiled as she said, "What a coincidence! My daughter Elvinia is also planning to go to the Chaotic Source World. I have a lot of tickets. I can give you as many as you want.
<br><br>
Besides, you don't need to take care of Elvinia. She will be of help to you instead."
<br><br>
What was going on? Flamine was prepared to give Zen as many tickets as he wanted? Everyone was flabbergasted at this development.
<br><br>
The tickets that Flamine and Yasamin were talking about weren't extraordinary.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source World complemented the Grand World Cultivation Method.
<br><br>
Long long ago, when the creatures of the Source World had entered the Other Shore, they had, with time, gradually discovered many powerful Other Shore Tokens. They had thus greatly increased their power of control.
<br><br>
But their strength reached a limit, which was about 1, 000 divine megatons, and caused their physical bodies to be limited as well.
<br><br>
Only a small number of powerful nonhuman creatures could exceed this limit while creatures of most races came to a halt.
<br><br>
No creature since the middle ages had been able to break through this limit.
<br><br>
Some masters had stepped into higher stages of the Other Shore. The power of their Other Shore Tokens could reach thousands or even tens of thousands of divine megatons. But they could only use up to a thousand divine megatons of Other Shore Power when they fought.
<br><br>
That was why the Other Shore Tokens of descending type were their best options. They didn't need the warriors' bodies to bear their power and so, the Other Shore Power that the warriors released would be far beyond the limit of their bodies.
<br><br>
However, the Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type, auxiliary type, and mysterious type were excellent. It was a great waste to just put them aside.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had later discovered a special method on the Other Shore that could greatly increase the strength of the body.
<br><br>
Chapter 3223 The Origin Of Chaotic Source Reinforcement The method the Snake Goddess had discovered to exceedingly increase one's physical strength was called the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.
<br><br>
When the body refining in the Wild God System no longer worked to enable warriors to cross the Sea of Truth and reach the Other Shore, it slowly declined in the Source World.
<br><br>
However, some barbarian races still preferred that technique. But it could only give them limited power, which in most cases, was incomparable to the Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
Both the Snake Goddess, and the other super forces in the Source World faced difficulties in tackling this issue. They had spent a long time trying and finding a way to strengthen their bodies.
<br><br>
At that time, the Snake Goddess had successfully reached Stage TwentyTwo. Over there, she came across an unusual Other Shore Token, and it was called the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
It was an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Its mechanisms were simple: when one activated it, it would become one with the cultivator's body and merge with it. By doing so, it would assist them and increase their physical strength by a fair amount.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit was no extraordinary Other Shore Token. In fact, it was quite common to be found on Stage Twenty-two. The Other Shore Power contained in it was about average, and it didn't give the warriors who used it much of a power boost. Therefore, it wasn't an invaluable find.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess had stumbled upon a distinctive property of the Chaotic Source Spirit and tapped into its hidden power.
<br><br>
It turned out that the Chaotic Source Spirit was actually a living being! Coming across living creatures on the Other Shore was rather rare.
<br><br>
However, it was nothing impressive for someone like the Snake Goddess, who had already reached a high level of cultivation.
<br><br>
Even so, the Chaotic Source Spirit had some distinctive properties to its name that set it apart from other living beings. Although it was an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token, it also shared the qualities with descending type of Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Having learned such a thing, the Snake Goddess planned on testing her new theory out.
<br><br>
Without wasting a second, she asked Fuxi to catch one Chaotic Source Spirit on the Other Shore and then summon it at the same time when she did.
<br><br>
Once they were activated, the two Chaotic Source Spirits familiarized themselves with each other and began communicating in their own language. It was discovered that they were interdependent creatures and were capable of reproducing, which explained how descending type of Other Shore Tokens remained in the Source World for that long.
<br><br>
Once they began to reproduce, the Snake Goddess observed an inconceivable phenomenon.
<br><br>
The new Chaotic Source Spirits made from their breeding did not return to the Other Shore but remained in the Source World.
<br><br>
What was more interesting was the fact that they were born owner-less! Both the Snake Goddess and Fuxi stood dumbfounded at this sight. They couldn't figure out the mystery behind the Chaotic Source Spirits. Just what were they? Were they beings of the Source World? Or were they Other Shore Tokens from the Other Shore? They could have been both or neither of the two...
<br><br>
One Chaotic Source Spirit held the capability of strengthening the physical prowess of the warrior who activated it, but what if they used more than one at once? Once she thought of this method, the Snake Goddess felt excitement fill her existence.
<br><br>
Quickly, they used their acquired Chaotic Source Spirits and caused them to reproduce until they multiplied to a significant degree.
<br><br>
When their population reached just over a hundred, the Snake Goddess made Fuxi absorb all of them to test out her theory.
<br><br>
One after the other, each of them merged with Fuxi's body and made his physical prowess rise steadily. They kept being absorbed into his body until his physical power reached a notably high level. Thus, Fuxi was the first one to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.
<br><br>
The news that the Pear Hill was nurturing the Chaotic Source Spirits quickly spread like wildfire.
<br><br>
As a result, their value increased, and they became notably popular on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Every super force out there began their frantic search for Chaotic Source Spirits. As a result, the Chaotic Source Spirits that once lay in high numbers on Stage Twenty-Two were almost depleted.
<br><br>
Following in the footsteps of the Snake Goddess, the masters of the super forces bred these Chaotic Source Spirits and multiplied their quantity to their desired number. They began viewing these unusual creatures as a gateway to attaining overwhelming power for themselves.
<br><br>
The emergence of the Chaotic Source Spirits meant that those strengthening type of Other Shore Tokens and the mysterious type of Other Shore Tokens, which had various incredible abilities, would become more practical. At least after the warriors had enough Chaotic Source Spirits, they could exceed their limits and further build up their physical strength.
<br><br>
However, this fortunate find didn't stay relevant for long. Soon they were stuck on this path.
<br><br>
When the Snake Goddess bred the Chaotic Source Spirits, everything went on smoothly. She nurtured about several thousand of the Chaotic Source Spirits within a year. However, when the super forces began to do the same, they found that the reproduction ability of the Chaotic Source Spirits was limited and had considerably declined.
<br><br>
Some super forces had worked hard for several years, but only managed to obtain a few hundred Chaotic Source Spirits. And in more unfortunate events, they got nothing, as the Chaotic Source Spirits refused to breed.
<br><br>
Confused and frustrated, the super forces scavenged the temples for an explanation and a conclusion to the issue.
<br><br>
It soon came to light that the Chaotic Source Spirits had a limitation of a certain number to exist at one time, which was two hundred thousand.
<br><br>
Once they capped two hundred thousand, they would discontinue reproducing themselves.
<br><br>
The only condition for a new one to be born was if an existing one was refined.
<br><br>
Since the Snake Goddess was the first one to discover this property, she had already gathered a hundred thousand of them before the super forces could follow after her. This left close to nothing for the rest of the aspirants. In the best cases, they managed to nurture over ten thousand Chaotic Source Spirits. But for some others, they only got a few hundred, how unfortunate! Moreover, after the Chaotic Source Spirits those super forces caught gave birth to new ones, there was a high probability that they would be born in the Pear Hill. After all, Pear Hill had the largest population of them.
<br><br>
As this continued, the number of Chaotic Source Spirits of the Pear Hill had reached as many as one hundred and fifty thousand, while the other forces had less.
<br><br>
This unfair distribution of these Chaotic Source Spirits made many super forces jealous. Soon after, they gathered in one place and stood united to force Pear Hill to hand over the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Coming under pressure from the confrontation, the Snake Goddess gave in and reached a compromise with them. Together, with the super forces, she created the Chaotic Source World and stored all their Chaotic Source Spirits in there.
<br><br>
As per the estimation, every ten years, the number of Chaotic Source Spirits would reach its limit of two hundred thousand from reproducing. Only then would the members of different races come to absorb them. And the amount of Chaotic Source Spirits one would be able to absorb to complete the Chaotic Source Reinforcement all depended on luck.
<br><br>
However, the Chaotic Source World was not accessible to everyone. They required tickets to enter, which were always scarce in the Source World.
<br><br>
One ticket almost meant an opportunity to become a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm. There were so many talents in the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace, and all of them had their lustful eyes on the tickets.
<br><br>
Now that Flamine offered to give Zen many of these in one go, it seemed like the unthinkable! Feeling frustrated, Yasamin poked her cane into the ground as she hissed at Flamine with enraged eyes. "What's the use of having many tickets?"
<br><br>
Flamine didn't bother to argue with her. She barely gave her a second glance. Instead, she smiled sweetly at Zen and gestured with kind words.
<br><br>
"Since the Flow Sword Sect is very close to our Phoenix Palace and I've given you the token of our palace, you must come to visit us someday."
<br><br>
With that, she turned around without looking at anyone else and made her way out.
<br><br>
Watching her receding figure Yasamine spat in her direction dejectedly then walked away towards the gate of the Mighty Sword Hall.
<br><br>
Dorothy switched her gaze between her grandmother and Zen to read their expressions. After a long pause, she spoke to break the silence, "Zen, why did you go to the Phoenix Palace?"
<br><br>
Flamine's attitude differed from that of usual. It made Dorothy suspicious of whether something had happened between Zen and Elvinia.
<br><br>
"I offended Elvinia at the Seven Mountains Meeting last time," Zen said in an indifferent tone.
<br><br>
Dorothy crossed her arms and nodded as she recalled the events. "Oh, I remember that I reminded you to be cautious of Elvinia's revenge because she was very angry at that time."
<br><br>
Zen shrugged his shoulders and said, "She did take her revenge. She kidnapped my families to Phoenix Palace. I had no choice but to go there and have a battle with her."
<br><br>
Athemar, Goran, Winchell, and Master Hai were treading along slowly behind Yasamin. They were all famous strong warriors, but they were also interested to know a lot of things. Overhearing what Zen had to say, they couldn't help but wonder to themselves.
<br><br>
How did Zen manage to gain such favor from Flamine after just a fight with Elvinia? It seemed too good to be true.
<br><br>
"If you really battled with Elvinia, why was Flamine so nice to you just now?" Dorothy asked innocently while blinking her big beautiful eyes that were filled with curiosity.
<br><br>
Chapter 3224 Backer Zen had not been present in the Mighty Sword Hall during the argument between Yasamine and Flamine.
<br><br>
It thus puzzled him to see Yasamin's hostile attitude towards Flamine. He assumed they must have some longstanding grudge against each other.
<br><br>
As for the tickets to the Chaotic Source World, Zen didn't know their value, so he did not see it as a big deal when Flamine offered to give him many tickets. He was more curious as to why Yasamin and Flamine were fighting over him. He wondered what that was all about.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" he asked Dorothy, hoping to make sense of everything.
<br><br>
She smiled at him playfully. "She wants you to be her son-in-law!"
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Zen asked incredulously. His jaw dropped.
<br><br>
He had only met Flamine one time. It had been a memorable encounter, and she had been very friendly towards him, but to marry her daughter? What the hell was this? "Are you tempted?" Dorothy teased. She could see his reaction and deliberately sought to provoke him further.
<br><br>
Zen could see what Dorothy was doing, so he modulated his response. He put on a helpless smile and said, "I don't know Elvinia all that well, and we don't really have anything to do with each other. If Lady Flamine said that, perhaps she was just joking."
<br><br>
Was he serious? Did he really believe Flamine was just kidding around? Dorothy stared at Zen, her eyes wide with disbelief.
<br><br>
She was very young and naturally shy, so although she wanted to press him, she decided to stop asking further questions. She was worried that others would think she was jealous.
<br><br>
After they left the Mighty Sword Hall, Athemar took out a massive sword, motioning for everyone to come closer. They all stepped on the sword and it lifted them into the air. They flew quickly away from Vastness Mountain, eager to be done with the whole ordeal.
<br><br>
Back in the Mighty Sword Hall, Gethin walked to the golden throne and sat back down.
<br><br>
Natasha clapped her hands. Green light curtains covered the entire hall.
<br><br>
Gethin's gentle manner had changed completely. His sharp eyes became ferocious, like those of a furious beast.
<br><br>
"How many words did you get from him?" he roared.
<br><br>
Natasha and the two leaders of the intelligence agency looked tense. Their efforts with Zen had been cut short by the arrival of representatives from Origin Mountain and Oneness Mountain, which was a great shame. It explained why Gethin was so angry.
<br><br>
"About a hundred words—" Natasha began.
<br><br>
She was cut short by an energy that lashed out at her with a sharp, cracking sound.
<br><br>
She let out a croak of pain.
<br><br>
An invisible hand reached out and grabbed Natasha by the throat, strangling her. She was dragged before Gethin, who watched coldly as she choked.
<br><br>
She wheezed and struggled unsuccessfully to free herself.
<br><br>
"After all our efforts, the best you could do was a hundred words? Today I almost couldn't find a way out!" Gethin spat out angrily.
<br><br>
"Please stop, Emperor Gethin!"
<br><br>
"Emperor Gethin, what happened was not Lady Natasha's fault!"
<br><br>
the two leaders of the intelligence agency spoke up and pleaded with Gethin to be reasonable.
<br><br>
Gethin threw Natasha to the ground, and she landed with a thud, clutching at her aching throat.
<br><br>
Gethin's eyes still burned with rage. "The worst part is, we openly asked Zen about the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. No doubt he will report this to Athemar!"
<br><br>
"So what? No one in Vastness Mountain harmed Zen or did anything wrong. They can't accuse us of anything. What can they do to us?" Natasha said, slowly sitting up on the ground. She shot a look of grievance at Gethin.
<br><br>
Gethin glowered back at her. "You underestimate them. They will suspect us and eventually put together the pieces and figure out what we are doing."
<br><br>
"Emperor Gethin, you are worrying too much. Given the current situation of the Oneness Sky Palace, it doesn't matter if they notice something. In two to three years, we can finally rest easy. We have strong allies on our side!"
<br><br>
said one of the leaders of the intelligence agency.
<br><br>
Gethin shook his head and exhaled deeply. The fierce light in his eyes grew intense as he said, "I certainly hope so!"
<br><br>
As they flew, perched on Athemar's huge sword, Zen told the others what had happened to him on Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
The faces of Athemar and Goran darkened.
<br><br>
"They clearly place a great significance on the Truth Enlightenment, which is strange," said Master Hai.
<br><br>
"After Zen deciphers the complete Truth Enlightenment, it will be circulated throughout the entire Oneness Sky Palace sooner or later. Why are they in such a hurry? Do they worry that we won't give it to the Vastness Mountain?" Goran mused.
<br><br>
"I thought it was strange too," Zen admitted.
<br><br>
It was impossible that the people of Vastness Mountain had asked about the Truth Enlightenment without any deeper motive. There was clearly more at stake, something that they just couldn't see yet.
<br><br>
"Unless... maybe they can't wait," Athemar said thoughtfully.
<br><br>
"Why not? The Vastness Mountain has existed for a long time. They're not moving away, are they?" Winchell asked.
<br><br>
As soon as he spoke, the expressions of the others changed.
<br><br>
Yasamin's eyes narrowed, and she snorted. Coldly she said, "It seems that they have decided to walk on a different path!"
<br><br>
She and the others realized that Vastness Mountain must be planning to break away eventually from the Oneness Sky Palace. Why would they be so eager to get the Truth Enlightenment ahead of the others, unless they were going to leave the Oneness Sky Palace before the Truth Enlightenment was disseminated to everyone? Of course, this was all speculation. They had no evidence except Zen's experience to support their assumption. But at least for now, they had a theory that explained the mysterious actions of the people of Vastness Mountain, and they would act accordingly.
<br><br>
"I will report this to Eastern Emperor Taiyi," Master Hai said.
<br><br>
Athemar touched the huge sword and it sped up. They accelerated until they were flying at a blurring speed, and soon they arrived at Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
As soon as they landed, Zen started to leave, but Yasamin held out a hand to stop him. She told him that she meant it about preparing the soul crystal for him, and that he needed to get ready to go to the Other Shore to receive it.
<br><br>
Yasamin was the second most important figure in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
To refuse her would be an act of utmost disrespect. So Zen nodded obediently.
<br><br>
At any rate, if the Chaotic Source World was really going to open, then Zen definitely had no intention of missing this opportunity.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Sky Horizon Province, the Black Ship quietly sailed across the sky.
<br><br>
Shera sat on one side of the ship, her slender legs dangling in the air.
<br><br>
A gentle rolling mountain came into view. The mountain was dotted with buildings of various shapes and sizes.
<br><br>
The tallest building was a whopping ten thousand feet high, while the smallest was only as high as a palm. The variation was too great. Obviously the mountain was home to different races of beings.
<br><br>
Most of the races in the Source World had carved out their own exclusive territory. It was rare to see different races living together on the same land.
<br><br>
"We've already arrived at Black Mountain Guild..."
<br><br>
Shera murmured to herself. She put one hand on the rail while she dragged something with the other hand.
<br><br>
There was a whoosh, and a man was pulled out of the Black Ship. He slammed onto the deck with a muffled thud.
<br><br>
The Evil God stood up from the deck, his face full of displeasure. "I was cultivating! You interrupted me when you dragged me here."
<br><br>
Shera was not bothered by his irritation. "There is a more suitable place for you to cultivate," she said, pointing downwards.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked down. There was a strange, eerie aura emanating from the mountain below them. He could sense that this was not a good place.
<br><br>
"Below us is the Black Mountain Guild, which is comprised of over 800 races. The competition among the people of that sect is very fierce. It's almost impossible for someone to succeed without a backer. You must be constantly on your guard, even among people of your own race. Not every human can be trusted," Shera said in a clinical, analytic tone, as she gazed down at the mountain.
<br><br>
"Backer?" The Evil God looked disdainful. "I don't need anyone to back me up. I'm my own backer!"
<br><br>
By now, Shera was used to the arrogant manner of the Evil God. This man's talent had surprised her again and again. Still, he had just reached the Other Shore Realm, so she thought his arrogance in this instance was unfounded and a bit annoying.
<br><br>
She curled her lips at him. "Fine. You may go down there now."
<br><br>
A bang sounded.
<br><br>
The Evil God suddenly fell, as though a heavy and irresistible weight had been strapped to his body. He dropped from the sky like a stone.
<br><br>
Chapter 3225 Black Mountain Guild As the pressure of gravity that was exerted on the Evil God increased, he was rendered powerless and couldn't escape the situation he was in.
<br><br>
If he continued freefalling at such a rapid pace, it wouldn't be long before he smashed into the ground forcefully. Even he wouldn't be able to bear the repercussions.
<br><br>
When the distance between him and the ground decreased to less than two hundred feet, he shut his eyes bracing for impact. A trace of ruthlessness was smeared across his face.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a wild stream of energy rushed out! Bang! It was like something as big and bright as the sun had exploded and sent ripples surging across the ground. A massive crater thumped to the surface with the Evil God lying inside.
<br><br>
"That damned woman..."
<br><br>
he cursed under his breath, his voice barely audible from the pressure of the air.
<br><br>
After that, his head smashed against a weighty object as he finally collapsed on the ground.
<br><br>
It almost made him faint, but he resisted the concussion.
<br><br>
Attempting to get a hold of his senses, he shook his head several times and held it firmly. After he blinked several times, he noticed a black token lying near his feet. He picked it up carefully and flicked it to study it from all sides. It had a strange pattern carved into it. Other than that, there was nothing else worth looking at.
<br><br>
As the Evil God got back up on his feet, he put away the token safely.
<br><br>
Looking around his surroundings, he cursed Shera again, blaming her for his ordeal before climbing out of his self-made pit.
<br><br>
The moment he climbed out, his ears alerted him to rustling sounds coming from a distance. As he looked in the direction of the noise, two wolves that were the size of humans lurking nearby enveloped his view.
<br><br>
When their eyes fell on the Evil God, they gleamed under the dark as they spotted their prey.
<br><br>
'You want to eat me now, huh?' A cold smile stretched across the face of the Evil God as he fearlessly continued walking in the direction of the Black Mountain Guild.
<br><br>
Just as he turned around casually, the two wolves took advantage of the moment and pounced on him aggressively.
<br><br>
Suddenly, two balls of light filled with massive energy erupted from behind the Evil God's back.
<br><br>
The wolves whimpered in pain as they got crushed by the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
"It seems beasts will always be beasts..."
<br><br>
The Evil God glanced back at the broken limbs splayed on the ground of the two black wolves and shook his head.
<br><br>
When he turned his head back to look ahead, he frowned.
<br><br>
He rolled his eyes as he examined the sunken ravine straight ahead. Strange creatures of all shapes and sizes made themselves known as they appeared before him from it. Some as big as a leopard, some as small as mice, but each of them was powerful. Other creatures of unfamiliar forms were among them too.
<br><br>
"So, Shera has thrown me into the lair of beasts!" Pleased by how it all turned out for him, the Evil God laughed violently. He could feel the killing intent buried deep within him reignite as he glared back at the creatures.
<br><br>
At this moment, the beast in the lead walked up and spoke in an authoritative voice. "Human! Hand over the Black Mountain Token in your hand!" The creature stretched out its palm as if to gesture the Evil God to give it up.
<br><br>
"The Black Mountain Token is not something for you to take. If you give it to us, we will go easy on you and grant you a painless death!" Another beast came forward and erupted in frustration.
<br><br>
Some of them stood behind in the ranks, and hissed at the Evil God who stood arrogantly.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, all sorts of noises began to surround him as the creatures howled declaring war.
<br><br>
It so happened, the reason the two wolves attacked him in the first place was to retrieve the Black Mountain Token from him.
<br><br>
Black Mountain Guild was very important to these creatures. It was wellknown around these parts. It was willing to admit beasts from any race.
<br><br>
Such a place was perfect for the nonhuman creatures who roamed the lands alone and hadn't been born in a strong group.
<br><br>
Since it was a highly regarded place, getting access to it wasn't easy. It was close to impossible for these creatures to obtain the Black Mountain Token.
<br><br>
In fact, some beasts that resided near Black Mountain Guild fought and ate each other, simply to get a Black Mountain Token.
<br><br>
Sensing overwhelming aggression soaring from the creatures, the Evil God slowly began to let his arrogance fade.
<br><br>
Although Shera didn't tell him anything about the Black Mountain Token, it was still evident the token could get him into the Black Mountain Guild.
<br><br>
Each of these creatures stood in their ranks stationing themselves, ready to attack. But then, diamond-shaped light rings appeared under the Evil God's feet.
<br><br>
Due to receiving some guidance recently, he had managed to reach a new level of Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
As he stood there gathering all his energy, the creatures all dashed towards him to not give him the window to counterattack.
<br><br>
"Tear him apart!"
<br><br>
"That Black Mountain Token belongs to me!"
<br><br>
The beasts roared violently with bloodshot eyes. They gathered motivation from one another's words and charged towards the Evil God.
<br><br>
Right then, a piercing noise exploded and filled the air with its dominance.
<br><br>
As the creatures gathered around the Evil God like moths to a flame, the rings of light exploded layer by layer in the air.
<br><br>
An incandescent shock wave spread out far and wide like a fountain overflowing with energy.
<br><br>
With the help of the impact force, the Evil God boosted himself forward like an arrow shot from a bow.
<br><br>
Some of the beasts perished under the influence of the Ways-blending Energy, while the rest chased after him. They were unfazed by their fallen companions.
<br><br>
These creatures inhabited near the Black Mountain Guild had grown up witnessing massacre and slaughter. Death wasn't something that could scare them, it was a common occurrence to them. Even though the Evil God's spectacle of strength was frightening, he failed to intimidate them.
<br><br>
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak An extremely agile grey mouse leaped up towards the back of the Evil God amidst the commotion.
<br><br>
Before it could cause much damage, he crushed it using his aura. However, the mouse had already succeeded in ripping off a piece of his flesh from his shoulder.
<br><br>
Just then, a gigantic beast the size of an elephant used a long whip covered in thorns to slash at the back of the Evil God.
<br><br>
It caused his clothes to tear apart as blood gushed out from his flesh. He almost staggered after getting attacked as he groaned in pain.
<br><br>
'If I let these monsters surround me, I'm afraid I'll lose my limbs. Damn that Shera!' he cursed at her again in his heart to not voice his fears out to the beasts that chased after him.
<br><br>
His journey in the Black Ship had caused him to expand his knowledge about a lot of things and broadened his perspective.
<br><br>
Although Shera was an arrogant woman, she still helped the Evil God rebuild his points of view on many things.
<br><br>
She had told him that Ways-blending Energy was pointless and even warned him that some people had failed to try to succeed in this respect.
<br><br>
Instead, she gave him the suggestion of an alternative method he could use.
<br><br>
Ignoring her advice at first, he stood firm on the fact that these energies would be mixed with each other sooner or later.
<br><br>
But eventually, he gave up and decided to listen to her. After all, she was the woman who promised him freedom from the Rebirth Land that restrained him. In exchange for that, he was tasked to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
However, to enter the Chaotic Source Realm, one had to go to the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
The time when the doors of the Chaotic Source World would open was already drawing near. Time was running out of his hands like grains of sand. He had to increase his cultivation quickly before that happened.
<br><br>
This was the reason why Shera had thrown him down from the Black Ship, to send him off into the Black Mountain Guild for cultivation.
<br><br>
This guild housed many different races within it, and at times it was very chaotic. Killing and conspiring against each other was a common practice in there. It only produced the most ruthless warriors.
<br><br>
It wasn't just a place for cultivation, but to test your survival instincts as well.
<br><br>
The Evil God continued to rush his way away from the creatures for tens of miles without stopping and entered a ravine.
<br><br>
Just as he walked inside, the beasts stopped chasing after him and stopped.
<br><br>
"What should we do now? He has reached the gate of the Black Mountain Guild!"
<br><br>
"We have no Black Mountain Token. Anyone who dares to step in there without a Black Mountain Token will surely die."
<br><br>
"Let's just go. That human brat got lucky. But I know he won't be able to survive half a day inside the Black Mountain Guild!"
<br><br>
As those creatures slowly dispersed and disappeared into the dark, the Evil God watched as his face declared a hint of viciousness.
<br><br>
He had always been the one who would try to kill others, how could he swallow the insult of being the one hunted instead? At that point, he decided and wrote it on his flesh, once he made some achievements in the Black Mountain Guild, he would come back and annihilate all of them! When he thought of this, he felt a faint trace of cold air tickle his neck. Just then, he sensed an unsettling presence approach him from behind. A miserable voice echoed in his ears and caused him to turn around. "Human, do you have a Black Mountain Token?"
<br><br>
He glanced in the direction of the sound and saw pieces of ragged cloth drifting in the air, beneath which was a skeleton. It was unknown to what creature it had belonged before, and on the back of the skeleton was a pair of folded wing bones.
<br><br>
Witnessing a live structure of bones, the pupils in his eyes shrank as he handed over the token obediently.
<br><br>
"All warriors of our Black Mountain Guild who have survived to get out of here are formidable. But I hope you can live to see that day. Hahaha...
<br><br>
Follow me!"
<br><br>
The skeleton let out a horrific laugh and turned around while gesturing him to follow after. The Evil God walked behind it with determined eyes, letting the darkness devour his existence.
<br><br>
Chapter 3226 Milo's Way Of Returning The Favor The second Zen showed up in his house in the Flow Sword Sect, Margaret rushed to him, eager to ask him some questions.
<br><br>
When Zen had gone to the Clear Lake, he had taken his leave without saying goodbye.
<br><br>
The fact Trish had returned alone, without Zen, had left Margaret and the other women very worried about him.
<br><br>
Now, seeing their beloved Zen back home safe and sound, they felt so relieved.
<br><br>
The women demanded an explanation. Zen shrugged apologetically. He decided to tell them about his adventures at the Clear Lake, but he completely omitted his journey to the Phoenix Palace and Vastness Mountain.
<br><br>
Trish eyed him carefully. She knew that Zen was keeping something from them, but she kept quiet. As a servant, she couldn't meddle with how her master chose to deal with these things.
<br><br>
Barely a day had passed when someone knocked at the door of their house.
<br><br>
When Trish opened the door, she was surprised to be greeted by a very excited Milo.
<br><br>
"I heard that your master Zen is back?" Milo asked eagerly.
<br><br>
He was becoming more and more polite with Zen. In the beginning, he didn't even have interest in knowing Zen's name.
<br><br>
"My master just came back..."
<br><br>
she answered hesitantly. Trish wondered how Milo knew so soon. Could he have hired someone to keep an eye on their courtyard house? It turned out her suspicions were correct.
<br><br>
After Milo had gotten a part of the Truth Enlightenment, he started to study it at once and found a huge secret.
<br><br>
Unable to contain his excitement, he had rushed to Zen's dwelling to share the news, only to find out Zen wasn't there. He had no choice but to wait for him to come back.
<br><br>
Thus, he resorted to hiring someone to watch Zen's house. He needed to be notified the moment Zen returned.
<br><br>
"I have something to tell him," explained Milo, his eyes twinkling excitedly.
<br><br>
Trish couldn't see how she could refuse. With a meek nod, she went off to fetch her master.
<br><br>
Zen saw how Milo was practically giddy with excitement. His curiosity was piqued. 'Is he here for more words of Truth Enlightenment?' he wondered.
<br><br>
"It's been a long time since you joined in the Flow Sword Sect, Zen," Milo said with a curt bow. "I wonder what level of cultivation you're on with the truth swordsmanship manual..."
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrow in surprise.
<br><br>
It had indeed been a while since he joined in the Flow Sword Sect, but he had obtained the Flow Swordsmanship only recently. Additionally, since he had been busy with the Seven Mountains Meeting some time ago, he hadn't really taken the time to study it til he got to the Clear Lake. Even then, he hadn't been able to study it that much.
<br><br>
"I haven't grasped much of it," Zen answered honestly. "Why do you ask?"
<br><br>
It seemed Milo grew even more excited when he heard Zen's answer. "Then hurry and cultivate it! The first hundred and fifty words of your Truth Enlightenment are truly a perfect match for the Flow Strike, especially the first move of Heart Slaughtering Theurgy. When paired with the Soul of Light, it is extremely profound and powerful..."
<br><br>
As spoke, Milo's eyes darted all over the courtyard, as though he were looking for something. Lacking a more suitable target, his eyes fell on Zen.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" Zen asked vigilantly. He noticed the crazed look in Milo's eyes.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Milo activated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. With a slight wave of his hand, he began to emanate a powerful aura.
<br><br>
With a flash of light, Milo transformed into a giant sword and swung at Zen.
<br><br>
"Heart Slaughtering Strike?"
<br><br>
Zen cried in alert.
<br><br>
He could sense how strong the killing intent was. He darted backward warily.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen dodged the blade just in time. Channeling his power to his feet to act quickly, he prepared to strike back as his footprints left cracks in the pavement.
<br><br>
The women, who were on the other side of the house at the time, were all shocked by Milo's sudden attack.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen successfully avoid his attacks, Milo came back to his senses.
<br><br>
Transforming back to his human self, he glanced about the courtyard apologetically. "Ah, I'm sorry. I just wanted to give it a try. I didn't mean to get so carried away."
<br><br>
Hearing the sincerity in his words, Zen shook his head in annoyance. Yet, somehow, he was also amused. 'This fellow is truly obsessed with his sword...' "Your momentum... is that created by cultivating Truth Enlightenment?"
<br><br>
Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Actually, Zen already realized that even when he had just started to cultivate Truth Enlightenment. He just wanted to confirm this with Milo.
<br><br>
After all, the Mind Sword of Truth Enlightenment, which transformed his thoughts into a sword, was similar to Heart Slaughtering Strike.
<br><br>
Zen had been too busy to study these days. Milo, on the other hand, kept practicing. Because of this, he had figured out the connection between the Truth Enlightenment and the Flow Strike sooner.
<br><br>
"Yes!" Milo's expression shifted from apologetic to elated in a split second.
<br><br>
"Impressive, right?"
<br><br>
"Soul-level methods are indeed very powerful," Zen said slowly.
<br><br>
"Of course!" Milo laughed. "I've been killing many people in Other Shore the past few days. The people from the Bearing race are all scared of me! Hahaha!"
<br><br>
Within the first four stages of Other Shore, the three sacred temples of the human race were built together.
<br><br>
Most of the warriors within the first four stages were young. They tended to challenge each other, often resulting in soul-level confrontation.
<br><br>
In earlier times when the four temples had just been built, everyone had gotten along fine.
<br><br>
However, with the decay of the temple of the Nine Li race, the temples of the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race, gradually rose to power. The Oneness Sky Palace's temple, on the other hand, grew to be at a disadvantage. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were often bullied.
<br><br>
With the help of Truth Enlightenment, Milo had made great progress in cultivation. This earned some respect for himself and the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"So that's how it is..." Zen nodded slightly in approval.
<br><br>
It was true that the battles within the Other Shore were all soul-level. The warriors with a stronger soul would win. If the Flow Strike could work together with the Truth Enlightenment, it would indeed be a great help to them.
<br><br>
Milo smiled at Zen gratefully.
<br><br>
He usually didn't like asking others for help, but he was thankful that Zen had shared a hundred and fifty words of the Truth Enlightenment with him.
<br><br>
He was determined to repay Zen's kindness. This was why he shared this exciting news with Zen.
<br><br>
While Zen knew he could've discovered this too on his own through cultivation, Milo's input could speed up the process.
<br><br>
Zen had already read through the Flow Swordsmanship, but there were some points he didn't understand. Now, with Milo's guidance, he was able to comprehend it all. His hands twitched, as he was itching to verify Milo's theory.
<br><br>
Once Milo left, Zen turned to Trish and asked her to help him apply for the Flow Tower.
<br><br>
Ordinary disciples of the Flow Sword Sect could only enter the pagoda once a month, two hours at a time.
<br><br>
But for elites like Zen, there was no limit to the number of times he could enter in a month. However, there was still a limit to the time he could stay inside the Flow Tower.
<br><br>
Even elite disciples couldn't stay inside for over four hours at a time. If they stayed longer than that, the Flame of Soul would consume them completely.
<br><br>
Among all the elites, only Zen and Milo were able to stay for a long period of time inside the tower. This was because, not only were they capable of Instant Enlightenment, but both of them also practiced the Emotion Closing Godly Way.
<br><br>
Zen's personal record in the Flow Tower was a whole day and night.
<br><br>
Needless to say, the Flow Tower was a perfect place for comprehending Flow Swordsmanship.
<br><br>
"Turn your mind into a sword.
<br><br>
Use your mind to kill hearts..." Zen chanted softly from the tenth floor of the Flow Tower.
<br><br>
The white cyclone in his mind began to whirl faster and faster.
<br><br>
With a gentle flick of his fingers, he seemed to slice the very flames around him. To his satisfaction, in his hand was an invisible long sword, with a power unimaginable.
<br><br>
Chapter 3227 Turning Into Indigo Soul Milo had once fought with Zen in the Dragon City.
<br><br>
At that time, Milo held a dense mass of air in his hand, yet it was indestructible. It even broke the Snow Sword! That mass of air was actually a sword formed by Milo's thoughts.
<br><br>
"Milo didn't use all of his strength back then. Otherwise, I'm afraid that I would have failed to resist..." Zen muttered to himself as he stared at the invisible long sword.
<br><br>
The way the invisible long sword was formed was completely different from the Power Shaping of the Might Godly Way.
<br><br>
The sword was created by a warrior's mind, and could directly hit one's soul once it struck. The killing power that sword contained could easily destroy Zen's Soul of Light back then.
<br><br>
Now Zen had already mastered the way to form a sword with his mind, and through the help of the Truth Enlightenment, his sword was probably more powerful than Milo's. And the only way to prove it was through a sword fight.
<br><br>
Zen, of course, would not challenge Milo right now, he couldn't afford to waste his time. Zen had promised Yasamin that he'd go to the Other Shore as soon as he could, and now it was time.
<br><br>
He immediately left the Flow Tower and returned to his own courtyard house quickly. Then he chose to cultivate in seclusion again.
<br><br>
It only took a few moments for Zen to enter the Other Shore with his physical body.
<br><br>
His Soul of Light had stepped into Stage Four, while his body still stayed in Stage One.
<br><br>
Luckily, Dorothy had shown him the way before, so it wasn't too difficult for his physical body to climb up to Stage Four.
<br><br>
As usual, he had attracted many surprised gazes on the way.
<br><br>
It took Zen more than ten hours to reach Stage Four. Then his physical body safely retreated, and his soul returned to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Last time, Zen had retreated from the practice room of the temple, and now he went back to the same room.
<br><br>
When Zen pushed the door open, another room's door was also opening.
<br><br>
Although he hadn't seen the face, Zen was sure that the person from the other room was Dorothy. He had learned to identify her by her aura, which he had grown familiar with.
<br><br>
"I've been waiting for you for a long time!" Dorothy complained, but it was evident that she was glad to see him.
<br><br>
Yasamin always kept her words. She held the high position only inferior to Eastern Emperor Taiyi's in the Oneness Sky Palace. If she really wanted to give soul crystal to Zen, she could do it the way she wanted.
<br><br>
However, after Zen returned to the Flow Sword Sect, he didn't visit the temple first, and that made Dorothy upset.
<br><br>
Despite that, she couldn't shake her optimistic nature, and her dissatisfaction only lasted for a short while. A moment later, she was already smiling at Zen while saying, "Come with me."
<br><br>
This time, they were led by someone as they walked around the temple.
<br><br>
Upgrading their Souls of Light into Indigo Souls required quite a lot of soul crystal. But as much as Zen could remember, the temple had only a small stock of soul crystal, didn't it? Zen was getting confused, so he asked Dorothy about it.
<br><br>
But before Dorothy could even answer, their escort smiled at him and said confidently, "Since the day when someone discovered the Other Shore, the soul crystal has always been in great demand, but it doesn't mean that the Oneness Sky Palace doesn't have enough soul crystal at disposal."
<br><br>
Near the entrance of the temple, every disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace could get some soul crystal. As for how much they could get, it depended on how much importance their sects attached to them.
<br><br>
Whether it was the Oneness Mountain or the Origin Mountain, they had their own private savings of soul crystal.
<br><br>
Yasamin and the other powerful figures could not come to the Lust World, so they couldn't use it. It was prepared for their direct descendants.
<br><br>
"Grandma only prepared the soul crystal that I need. So she went to borrow some from the Golden Mountain for you this time. Isn't she nice?" Dorothy smiled at Zen, who was a little surprised at the news.
<br><br>
"Ha ha! It is a great favor, young man," their escort said in an envious tone.
<br><br>
Of course, this person knew that fusing with that soul crystal was enough to let a warrior's Soul of Light turn into a powerful Indigo Soul. It meant the soul was raised to a higher level, which allowed the warrior to enter the Desire World.
<br><br>
Such an opportunity was so precious, and most people could only envy it.
<br><br>
"Please tell Madam Yasamin my sincere appreciation. I owe her big time,"
<br><br>
Zen said earnestly.
<br><br>
Yet, until now, Zen's confusion hadn't been alleviated at all.
<br><br>
'What had happened between Madam Yasamin and Lady Flamine? Why would Madam Yasamin impose such a good thing on me all of a sudden? If she just wanted to win me over to her side, why would she go to such lengths?' He wanted to ask Dorothy about it, but then he remembered that last time he mentioned Flamine and Elvinia, Dorothy immediately became weird. So he thought he might just look for the answer himself or find someone else to ask about it.
<br><br>
The man led them to a covert place in the temple. It was heavily guarded with soldiers flanking each side of the doorway. Many runes were also engraved on the walls, from which Zen could feel powerful soul waves transmitting endlessly. Those runes must be used as a killing array to kill unwelcome souls.
<br><br>
"The soul crystal is ready. You two can go in now." Their escort stopped in front of a door, gesturing Zen and Dorothy to enter.
<br><br>
The two went inside without hesitation. The room, as they'd observed, had a few small compartments.
<br><br>
They each selected one, and instantly sat cross-legged, wasting no time.
<br><br>
In a short while, drops of white light began to appear from the texture on the wall of the compartment, and a strong soul aura forced its way out.
<br><br>
Zen did not hesitate. He reached out his hand, and with a gentle pull, the pure soul crystal flooded into his body. He could feel it slowly entering his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
As more and more white dots of light came in slowly, the Souls of Light of Zen and Dorothy were becoming stronger and stronger rapidly.
<br><br>
Zen's soul was slightly stronger than Dorothy's when the two of them had just entered the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
Later on, they reached the first temple and absorbed a large ball of soul crystal together. With the help of that, they were able to reach the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm quicker than they'd anticipated. Then, the Flow Sword Sect had given Zen a fist-size chunk of soul crystal, bigger than others', so his Soul of Light had surpassed Dorothy's a lot.
<br><br>
As Zen continuously absorbed the soul crystal into his body, the purple light of his Soul of Light started to shine brighter and more vividly.
<br><br>
The white dots of light that emerged on the wall weren't shrinking or showing any signs of diminishing at all. On the contrary, more and more were actually appearing! About an hour later...
<br><br>
The last piece of the soul crystal had merged with Zen's Soul of Light, which was glowing brightly with purple light.
<br><br>
In that narrow space, Zen flapped his arms around, stretching, and got a test of his current stronger power. He threw a punch against the wall closest to him, and his fist collided with the wall with a strong force. His Soul of Light had changed completely. It was an entity on its own now. He felt like it was his own physical body that was on the Other Shore, instead of his soul! Dorothy had already climbed out of the narrow space a few moments ago, but she waited for Zen at the door. Her soul also emitted a stronger purple light now. After only an hour of absorbing the soul crystal, their aura had become much more powerful and imposing.
<br><br>
For ordinary disciples, this would have been an unimaginable feat.
<br><br>
Most of the disciples could only get the rare soul crystal when they had attained a great achievement or if they were willing to explore the temples that only a few people had set foot in.
<br><br>
When Dorothy saw Zen exit the room, she came up to him before he could even greet her, and pinched his arm. After turning into Indigo Soul, she sensed her touch felt more real, and even her face became clearer.
<br><br>
Although he couldn't see her clearly, Zen could feel that the edge of her soul had become sharper.
<br><br>
"I feel like I've changed my soul entirely. It feels kind of strange," Dorothy said, frowning.
<br><br>
"I'm still not used to it either," Zen answered with a smile, encouraging her.
<br><br>
They then walked out of that place together, feeling more powerful and confident. But just as they had reached the entrance of the temple, throngs of Souls of Light started rushing in, and they were all screaming.
<br><br>
Chapter 3228 Soul Snakes Dorothy stopped one of them and asked, "What happened?"
<br><br>
"The Bearing race is coming to take revenge," the man answered. "They released the snakes!"
<br><br>
"Snakes? What snakes?" Zen looked aghast.
<br><br>
"The Soul Snakes raised by the Bearing race," Dorothy answered with a frown. "How dare they use snakes to attack us! Let's go out and have a look!"
<br><br>
They rushed out of the temple, but black creatures suddenly blocked their path.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the creatures closely. They were black snakes, but he couldn't see any other details on them.
<br><br>
In fact, they could only see the appearance and details of the aboriginal inhabitants clearly on the Other Shore. The Souls of Light and even Zen's body were outsiders to the Other Shore, and others could only trace out the outlines of them. The snakes were brought to the Other Shore by the Bearing race, so he naturally couldn't see them clearly.
<br><br>
"The snakes are coming!"
<br><br>
"Return to the temple quickly!"
<br><br>
"Damn it! Does the Bearing race want to attack the Oneness Sky Palace's temple?"
<br><br>
Resentment filled the voices of the Oneness Sky Palace disciples.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! Suddenly, many Soul Snakes were cut in half.
<br><br>
These disciples were in a panic. Some of them fled, while the others pulled out their swords and began to deal with the snakes.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace disciples were all powerful. The Souls of Light glowed purple light; this meant they were in the ninth or tenth stage of the Other Shore Realm and soon would become Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
But still, they were weaker than the group of Soul Snakes in front of them.
<br><br>
They kept on cutting and cutting but, in the end, they had to retreat to the entrance of the temple.
<br><br>
"Are these Soul Snakes planning to break into our temple?" Zen wondered out loud.
<br><br>
Dorothy shook her head calmly. "I don't think so," she replied.
<br><br>
Despite the small conflicts between the Bearing race and the Oneness Sky Palace throughout the years, they never launched an all-out attack. If the Bearing race decided to break into the temple, then that would signal an allout war between the two races.
<br><br>
"Help!"
<br><br>
A sharp scream was heard not too far away.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy turned their attention towards the noise and saw four people surrounded by snakes.
<br><br>
The four people's souls were still light brown and their breaths were a little messy. Obviously, they had just stepped into the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
They were simply trying to return to the temple, but the snakes had them surrounded. They had tried their best to fight against the snakes, but were then losing power.
<br><br>
They were no match for the snakes. They would die sooner or later.
<br><br>
"Why didn't they leave the Other Shore?" Zen was curious.
<br><br>
Souls of Light could simply choose to depart the Other Shore. Anyone in the right mind would definitely resort to leaving at the sight of the Soul Snakes.
<br><br>
"Look at their feet," Dorothy prodded.
<br><br>
There were faint blue lights that shone underneath the feet of the four people.
<br><br>
Members of large races had been cultivating in the Other Shore for many years. They were able to develop various methods that entrapped Souls of Light in the Other Shore. This included the Soul Binding Thread that tied people's souls into the place. The technique was popular among the Bearing race.
<br><br>
It looked like the four disciples had fallen into a dead end.
<br><br>
"I'll rescue them,"
<br><br>
Zen announced as he darted forward. He twisted his arm and a sharp thorn flew through it.
<br><br>
The thorn shone purple, indicating Zen's soul was much stronger than the Soul Snakes. Quickly, he attacked the snakes and had dozens of snakes cut into pieces.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Dorothy joined Zen and fought the snakes as well.
<br><br>
A small soul sword appeared around her, ready to cut any snake that came near Dorothy.
<br><br>
They cut a path in the middle of the snakes and rushed towards the four people.
<br><br>
The four warriors were trembling.
<br><br>
They had entered the Other Shore a few years ago, and now they reached the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm. They were diligent and outstanding disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace. They were not prepared to die right there and then.
<br><br>
They were close to breaking down when surging soul waves suddenly came into light.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The Soul Snakes were swept up, thrown all over, and cut like straws.
<br><br>
Two Souls of Light shining with purple lights landed beside them.
<br><br>
"What powerful soul fluctuations!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God! The Indigo Souls! They are Indigo Souls!"
<br><br>
"Sophia, we're finally rescued!"
<br><br>
Tears of joy swelled in their eyes.
<br><br>
Sophia had her eyes fixed on one of the souls. A sense of familiarity lingered in her mind.
<br><br>
"We can't stay here," Zen said hastily. "Return to the temple quickly."
<br><br>
Then, he walked past Sophia, blocking the surging snakes.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy were as sharp as ever. Their teamwork made them invincible. Each time the waves of snakes crashed towards them, they simply flicked their swords and split them apart.
<br><br>
"Sophia, run! What's wrong with you? Run!"
<br><br>
Sophia felt someone tug at her arms. When she realized what was happening, she quickly followed them and rushed toward the temple.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy stood behind and continued fighting back. Each time they launched an attack, they also inched backwards. Slowly, they were retreating to the entrance of the temple.
<br><br>
When they finally reached the entrance, the Soul Snakes suddenly stopped attacking.
<br><br>
"They stopped?"
<br><br>
Zen asked in confusion.
<br><br>
As if on cue, all the Soul Snakes just abruptly halted and stopped at the entrance.
<br><br>
"They know their line. They know that as soon as they enter the temple, they'd be in Oneness Sky Palace's territory. Crossing the line would be as good as declaring war against the Oneness Sky Palace. This is the rule signed by all the races in the Source World," Dorothy explained.
<br><br>
All of the great powers had established their own temples within the Other Shore. The Source World was already filled with wars; no one wanted the same for the Other Shore. Thus, everyone agreed that none of them were allowed to attack each other's temple.
<br><br>
No race would cross boundaries unless they had the intention of wiping out the other.
<br><br>
In the past, the Bearing race invaded the Nine Li race's temple. This triggered a great war between the two races. Soon, the Nine Li race was exterminated.
<br><br>
"We can't just let the Soul Snakes block our path," Zen remarked.
<br><br>
The Soul Snakes swarmed the entrance of the temple. They even covered the sculpture in front of it. The Oneness Sky Palace disciples trembled in fear.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss! The Soul Snakes seemed agitated. Suddenly, they cleared a path and made way for three warriors.
<br><br>
The warriors strolled over and stopped in front of the temple.
<br><br>
"What's going on? Is the Bearing race planning to start a war?" Dorothy asked the warriors arrogantly.
<br><br>
The Bearing race had plenty of powerful warriors among them, but the Oneness Sky Palace was far from an inferior race.
<br><br>
If war erupted between them, the Oneness Sky Palace could summon back all the warriors in Stage Thirteen of Lust World. It would be a great fight and it would be difficult to predict who the winner would be.
<br><br>
Chapter 3229 The Cause Of The Whole Thing The three men from the Bearing race paid Dorothy no heed.
<br><br>
Their leader gently raised his hand. The Soul Snakes raised their heads attentively, their threadlike tongues darting in and out.
<br><br>
Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Dorothy trembled slightly.
<br><br>
Then, the man said, "Call Milo Mo from your Oneness Sky Palace over to receive his death!"
<br><br>
Hearing this, the Oneness Sky Palace disciples exchanged confused glances.
<br><br>
"Milo?!" a disciple cried in surprise.
<br><br>
"He came to the temple a few days ago, but we haven't seen him in a while," someone chirped.
<br><br>
"Several days ago, he challenged some disciples from the Bearing race,"
<br><br>
another added. "Did he cause any trouble?"
<br><br>
Dorothy's brows knitted. She was puzzled. No one had expected this predicament had anything to do with Milo. "Zen, isn't Milo also a member of the Flow Sword Sect? Have you seen him recently?" she asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
"I did see him," Zen admitted.
<br><br>
"Then what happened?" Dorothy asked curiously.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "I don't know exactly what happened, but I guess he might have hurt someone important from the Bearing race, and now they're trying to take revenge."
<br><br>
Although Zen had no idea what had happened exactly, Milo had disclosed to him about a great breakthrough in the Flow Swordsmanship. He had eagerly practiced what he discovered on some unfortunate souls on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After all, the best place to practice the Flow Swordsmanship without holding back was on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Milo had also specifically said that he had beaten many rivals and even the Bearing race was afraid of him. Zen was afraid that Milo might have bullied the Bearing race on the Other Shore. So the disciples from the Bearing race were going to seek revenge today.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Zen and Milo were both from the Flow Sword Sect. He took a step forward. "Milo is my fellow disciple. May I ask what he's done to offend you?"
<br><br>
"Yesterday he almost killed my younger brother in the Soul Arena. My brother is still in a coma today. I would like to face the man who did this!"
<br><br>
the man said in a cold voice.
<br><br>
The Soul Arena was an open field that stood in the middle of the three temples of the human race. Souls of Light would go here to compete against one another, to determine the strength of their souls.
<br><br>
"Oh, this is so trivial," Dorothy said in an annoyed tone. "A soul battle is likely to cause accidents. Since your brother chose to enter the Soul Arena, he should've been aware of the risks. Yet you have the nerve to demand for an explanation!"
<br><br>
Many had lost their lives in the Soul Arena. Anyone who entered knew their fate would be determined by the strength of their souls.
<br><br>
"Who said I am here to ask for an explanation?" he sneered. "He should've known he wouldn't get away with this so easily. If he doesn't come out to fight me, I won't let you go." The snakes hissed ominously.
<br><br>
Zen surveyed his surroundings. Everywhere he turned, hordes of snakes blocked his way. Even the gate of the temple was swarmed with the vicious creatures; no one could go in or out. The Oneness Sky Palace was in for a lot of trouble if this kept up.
<br><br>
"What should we do?"
<br><br>
"Shall we go get Milo?"
<br><br>
In terms of strength and status, the Bearing race was indeed more powerful than the Oneness Sky Palace. Although the Oneness Sky Palace disciples were angry with the situation, it seemed they had no choice.
<br><br>
Some of the warriors quietly left the Other Shore and delivered the news to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Sophia and her three companions looked at Zen silently.
<br><br>
"This man is from the Flow Sword Sect," the man next to Sophia said in a low voice. "I heard that the Flow Sword Sect's talent, Milo, is capable of Instant Enlightenment. But this is not Milo. Could he be Konnor?"
<br><br>
"I have seen Konnor before," another man answered, puzzled. "That can't be him."
<br><br>
Looking Zen up and down, Sophia was filled with confusion.
<br><br>
She couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd met him before. His aura and voice were exactly the same as those of the man she had met on the Sea of Truth. That man could swim in the Sea of Truth! Could this be the same guy? Among the people of the Oneness Sky Palace, it was Sophia and her companions who had first found out that someone could swim in the Sea of Truth. After all, they had witnessed it themselves.
<br><br>
But since then, she had never run into Zen again.
<br><br>
But that person hadn't been a member of the Oneness Sky Palace at the time. Why was he a member now? Sophia's mind buzzed with so many questions.
<br><br>
On the outside, however, she tried to remain composed. Deciding not to tell her companions the truth, she just shook her head to drop the subject.
<br><br>
The horde of snakes continued to block the entrance of the temple.
<br><br>
The three men from the Bearing race were stubborn. They weren't going to leave till they faced Milo.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a man appeared inside the temple. Strolling past the crowd to face the three men, he said, "Didn't I tell you I would go to the Soul Arena three days from then? Why are you so impatient?"
<br><br>
He smiled. Of course, who else could it be but Milo? A faint purple light flashed on his Soul of Light. Although it wasn't as bright as Zen's and Dorothy's, people could tell it was not that far from reaching the Indigo Soul. It seemed the Flow Sword Sect was offering him many resources.
<br><br>
"You are Milo Mo?" asked the leading warrior of the Bearing race with a snort.
<br><br>
"Yes, I am," replied Milo calmly.
<br><br>
"Do you dare to enter the Soul Arena and fight me?" the man continued, baring his teeth.
<br><br>
"Why not? But..." Milo gestured at the snakes. "Get rid of that crap."
<br><br>
The man did not refuse. Raising his right hand, a bright silver halo appeared. Reaching into the halo, he pulled out a brown pot. Then, he pointed the mouth of the pot at the black Soul Snakes.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! All the Soul Snakes transformed into pools of black light that the pot seemed to suck in.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, all the Soul Snakes that blocked the entrance of temple had disappeared.
<br><br>
The disciples in the temple heaved a sigh of relief. While they were glad the matter didn't escalate, they were worried for their companion, Milo.
<br><br>
The three Souls of Light of the Bearing race were Indigo Souls. Indigo Souls could try to surpass the Lust World. After they finished the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, they would be promoted to Chaotic Source Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Milo's soul was undeniably a bit weaker than that of the leading disciple of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"I've heard that Milo is capable of Instant Enlightenment," a disciple whispered. "No wonder he is a rare genius in the Oneness Sky Palace. He doesn't seem to be nervous at all!"
<br><br>
"Unfortunately his soul is a little weaker," another one said wistfully.
<br><br>
"Really? I don't think so. A few days ago, he defeated three Indigo Souls from the Bearing race all by himself."
<br><br>
The man who had summoned back the Soul Snakes put away the pot and gestured towards the arena.
<br><br>
Without a word, Milo followed them.
<br><br>
Although they had been filled with fear just minutes prior, curiosity overcame the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. They too wordlessly followed Milo and the men to the arena.
<br><br>
By now, the news had spread so quickly, permeating the depths of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The normal disciples, elite disciples, and the direct descendants of the various mountain heads visited the Other Shore, streaming out of the temple gate. It seemed the interest of the entire Oneness Sky Palace was piqued.
<br><br>
"Let's go and have a look too," Dorothy said excitedly.
<br><br>
It was not a trivial matter anymore. While many disciples of the Bearing race had died in the Soul Arena, no one had dared to block the entrance of the Oneness Sky Palace's temple before. To a certain extent, this somewhat represented the true attitude of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Zen had just become an Indigo Soul. Originally, he had wanted to go to Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore with Dorothy, and perhaps he could find an Other Shore Token that was suitable for the Truth of Cultivation Nature.
<br><br>
He didn't expect such a thing to happen before he could do so. With a sigh, he followed after Dorothy.
<br><br>
Chapter 3230 An Unexpected Bet Zen and Dorothy followed the crowd, heading for the back of the Oneness Sky Palace's temple.
<br><br>
A square platform was situated at the intersection of three temples. This was known as the Soul Arena.
<br><br>
The surface of the arena was covered all over with a layer of pale blue powder, which was made of the same material as the Soul Binding Thread.
<br><br>
The powder was used to enforce an important rule. A fighter in the Soul Arena was not allowed to leave the Other Shore. Otherwise, when one was losing, they could simply leave the battle. The powder ensured that warriors who participated in the fight could not just escape.
<br><br>
"Why are there so many people here?" Zen asked, glancing at the crowd of warriors around the arena.
<br><br>
A large number of people were gathered around the Soul Arena, and all of them were strong Souls of Light. Many shone with vivid purple light, indicating that they were Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
"The situation is getting more and more strange," Dorothy said with a frown.
<br><br>
Most people came to the Other Shore primarily to search for suitable Other Shore Tokens. Many were not even interested in the soul battles.
<br><br>
Although the Soul Arena had been established here for a long time, it simply wasn't very popular among warriors.
<br><br>
Now, however, the arena was surrounded with warriors. The people of the Bearing race were present, and the members of the Divine Farmer race were also in the crowd.
<br><br>
When there were still four great human forces, it was the time when humans had forged the strongest unity.
<br><br>
The Bearing race couldn't have wiped out the Nine Li race on their own.
<br><br>
They succeeded because they allied with the Divine Farmer race to deal with the people of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
The cooperation between the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had long been a source of some concern to the Oneness Sky Palace. But because the Bearing race and the Oneness Sky Palace were quite distant from each other geographically, the palace was placated, and generally existed in harmony with both the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
Yet Athemar's prediction held true. The Oneness Sky Palace would eventually clash with the Bearing race, and the two races would turn against each other.
<br><br>
Seamus Ji, the man who had previously driven the surge of snakes, stepped onto the Soul Arena. The crowd quieted as they focused their attention on him. He waited until everyone was listening, and then said in a loud voice, "Yesterday, ten men of the Bearing race were defeated one after another.
<br><br>
My younger brother was one of those men. He sustained soul damage in the fight, and he still hasn't awakened. On behalf of my brother, I challenge the warrior who defeated him—Milo Mo!"
<br><br>
As soon as Seamus Ji stopped talking, a clamor rose up from the members of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Their Souls of Light emitted powerful auras, displaying quite intimidating strength.
<br><br>
Milo stepped up onto the Soul Arena. He showed no sign of fear.
<br><br>
Nonchalantly, he said, "No need to talk so much. If you want a fight, then let's fight!"
<br><br>
"Wait!" said Seamus Ji coldly. "It is tradition to place bets on the outcome of battles in the Soul Arena. Today is no exception."
<br><br>
"You want to bet?" Milo said impatiently. "Fine! How about I bet a thousand soul pills on my victory?"
<br><br>
To an ordinary disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, a thousand soul pills were a lot. But to Milo and Seamus Ji, it was an insignificant amount. The perfunctory offer made it clear that Milo had no interest in betting.
<br><br>
Seamus Ji understood this, and he scowled fiercely. "A thousand soul pills is not enough!" He turned and gestured to a man behind him.
<br><br>
At his command, the man stepped forward, taking out a large, transparent ball from his Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
The sight of the huge, shining ball elicited cries of astonishment from the people around the Soul Arena.
<br><br>
"The soul crystal!"
<br><br>
"That's a large chunk of soul crystal!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God..."
<br><br>
"Is Seamus really going to bet the soul crystal?"
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy, who had been watching the exchange between Seamus Ji and Milo, were stunned.
<br><br>
Soul crystal was an extremely precious object. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to buy it even with large amounts of divine crystals or soul pills. Soul crystal was priceless.
<br><br>
The soul crystal in the transparent, shining ball was enough to transform a warrior's soul into an Indigo Soul. Any warrior would fight hard to obtain the soul crystal, which was even larger than the one Zen had absorbed in the temple just now.
<br><br>
"Is it worth it? Why would he risk such a large chunk of soul crystal?"
<br><br>
Dorothy asked curiously.
<br><br>
Zen was also deep in thought. He couldn't fathom where the soul crystal had come from. Regardless of Seamus Ji's rank in the Bearing race, he shouldn't have such a large chunk of soul crystal. And if he did, he shouldn't be able to risk losing it all on a rash bet. What was his intention here? Milo had been utterly disinterested in betting, but at the sight of the soul crystal, his face lit up with excitement. He had yet to become an Indigo Soul yet. Winning this bet would dramatically accelerate that process. Yet his next words were unexpected. His face turned serious again as he said to Seamus Ji, "It seems this battle cannot continue."
<br><br>
"Why not?" Seamus Ji demanded, his own expression darkening.
<br><br>
Milo laughed bitterly. "Your bet is too precious. I can't match it. I don't have such a large chunk of soul crystal."
<br><br>
He wondered if Seamus Ji would insist on pushing through with the battle, since the difference in value between a thousand soul pills and that huge chunk of soul crystal was so vast.
<br><br>
To his surprise, Seamus Ji waved his hand and said curtly, "It doesn't matter.
<br><br>
Let me finish what I have to say. Although I am betting this chunk of soul crystal, it's not easy to get it."
<br><br>
He turned once more to his people and made another gesture, at which two members of the Bearing race stepped forward.
<br><br>
These two Souls of Light emitted cold, powerful auras. They were obviously very strong even among the Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
"Three of us will challenge the people of the Oneness Sky Palace. Two people will fight at a time, one from the Bearing race and one from the Oneness Sky Palace. Any time someone is defeated, another must take his place. If all three of us lose, the soul crystal will be given to the last Oneness Sky Palace disciple standing," said Seamus Ji.
<br><br>
His proposal caught the interest of many of the disciples around the arena.
<br><br>
If someone fought against the three warriors alone, it would be quite difficult.
<br><br>
But Seamus Ji was offering to let them take turns fighting against their three warriors until all of them were defeated.
<br><br>
Many thought to themselves, 'If I am the one who defeats the last of the three, then I will win the soul crystal!' But Milo quickly dashed everyone's plan. "You don't need to say anything more," he told Seamus Ji. "No one else will get the chance to fight. I can beat all three of you alone."
<br><br>
Seamus Ji sneered at him, and then walked out of the Soul Arena. He motioned for one of his men to step up. "Deon, you will be the first to fight Milo!"
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Deon Ji leaped into the Soul Arena.
<br><br>
There was a hiss of sound, and six purple Soul Rings appeared above his head.
<br><br>
His cold, powerful Indigo Soul sent out a strong aura across the Soul Arena, and weaker Souls of Light trembled at its force.
<br><br>
Milo smiled faintly. His own Soul of Light emanated in the arena wisps of white light that swept out and formed a small whirlpool which emitted a bold, sharp intent.
<br><br>
"What a strong truth aura!" Dorothy exclaimed, gazing at the shining white whirlpool of light.
<br><br>
Zen smiled. "Can't you figure out the origin of the white light?"
<br><br>
Dorothy thought for a moment and then responded, "That's the Truth Enlightenment! How could he combine it with his soul theurgy so soon?"
<br><br>
She had practiced the first one hundred and fifty words of the Truth Enlightenment, and thus was able to recognize the origin of the white vortex.
<br><br>
"It is," Zen nodded. "I'm not sure yet either."
<br><br>
Maybe Milo had mastered it in such a short period of time because the first hundred-odd words of the Truth Enlightenment were a perfect match of the Flow Strike.
<br><br>
In contrast, the Origin Swordsmanship practiced by Dorothy was not a soul theurgy, and she hadn't gone deep into this aspect. It was not easy to combine the two—perhaps it would have to be done by her grandmother.
<br><br>
Swoosh! In an instant, the white light released by Milo had vanished, and in its place, an invisible sharp sword appeared, rushing rapidly towards Deon Ji.
<br><br>
Chapter 3231 Purpose The Ji Clan was one of the two large clans of the Bearing race. The Soul Rings that Deon practiced were tough indeed.
<br><br>
Thanks to his Soul Rings, he was able to do as he pleased on Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
However, that didn't stop Milo from trying. He shot out his Mind Sword, slashing through the three Soul Rings on the outer layer.
<br><br>
Deon's face fell.
<br><br>
Seamus had warned him not to underestimate Milo, yet he was still surprised.
<br><br>
Deon was ranked part of the top ten among the younger generation of the Ji Clan. He had inherited some of the unique skills of the clan. The audiences were stunned. Would he be defeated in one strike? With a snarl, he reactivated his soul force, summoning more Soul Rings to spread out and protect him.
<br><br>
When Milo's second Mind Sword attacked him again, he leapt to the side, dodging the blade by a hair.
<br><br>
Milo still remained calm.
<br><br>
Since he had mastered the Truth Enlightenment, he was confident in the power of the Heart Slaughtering Strike.
<br><br>
With this power, he might even be able to kill a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Of course, this would only be possible if the warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm had just cultivated their soul to the Indigo Soul level. After all, after one had the Indigo Soul, they could improve further with enough soul crystal.
<br><br>
Whoosh! An idea flashed through his mind and the invisible Mind Sword began to hover in the air. With a slight smile, he controlled the sword to slash at Deon again.
<br><br>
Deon didn't dare face him head on, and he swiveled to the side to dodge the slash. Moving as flexibly as a snake, he pounced from side to side, narrowly dodging Milo's strikes.
<br><br>
However, the space of the Soul Arena was limited. After several dodges, he was trapped in a corner. Milo slowly headed towards him, taking his sweet time.
<br><br>
Milo continued slashing at him with his invisible Mind Sword, his eyes flashing in anticipation. Finally, all the Soul Rings were shattered into thousands of pieces. Milo pointed his sword at Deon's soul. Deon immediately raised his hand in surrender.
<br><br>
Milo knew when to stop. Withdrawing his Mind Sword, he walked away from the trembling Deon.
<br><br>
"Milo is truly amazing," Dorothy praised, nodding in approval.
<br><br>
Although her Soul of Light had improved a lot, she knew that if she were to fight Deon in the Soul Arena, it wouldn't be so easy for her to win.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
Somehow, even though Milo's soul strength was nowhere near as strong as Deon, he had managed to destroy him without breaking a sweat.
<br><br>
If Milo's soul succeeded in turning into an Indigo Soul, his power would be unimaginable.
<br><br>
Zen was deep in thought. From the way Milo ended the fight, it didn't look like he was a bloodthirsty killer, killing for killings' sake. The second Deon admitted defeat, he stopped his attacks. So why did Seamus claim that Milo almost killed his younger brother? Zen's thoughts were interrupted as the crowd erupted into cheer.
<br><br>
"Milo won the battle so easily!"
<br><br>
"Is the fight over? I just got here!"
<br><br>
"I heard that the Bearing race gambled soul crystal on this match..."
<br><br>
Because of the news about Soul Snakes swarming the Oneness Sky Palace's temple, many of the elite disciples had come to the Other Shore to see what was happening.
<br><br>
Just now, Deon had taken out the soul crystal, causing the audience to whisper amongst themselves excitedly. More and more disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace started showing up.
<br><br>
Apparently, the disciples that had just come were only here for the soul crystal, and most of them were elites from the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
After Deon's swift defeat, he left the Soul Arena dejectedly. The audience held their breath in anticipation, waiting for the next warrior to step onto the arena -- but no one came.
<br><br>
Standing in the middle of the Soul Arena, hands clasped behind his back, Milo grew impatient. "Seamus, you said you'd send three people to fight me. Where is the second one?"
<br><br>
Milo saw Seamus whispering to his group under the stage. Suddenly, Seamus's once arrogant disposition changed into one of respect. "Please wait a while," he said courteously with a charismatic smile.
<br><br>
As the clock ticked, the crowd grew restless in anticipation.
<br><br>
"Are the Bearing race afraid now?"
<br><br>
"Milo is really strong. The power of the Flow Strike is incredible!"
<br><br>
"But Seamus wouldn't go back on his own words, would he?" "If he really flinches and backs out, that would be a huge disgrace. Hahaha..."
<br><br>
People from the Oneness Sky Palace laughed amongst themselves, confident in Milo's abilities.
<br><br>
However, the disciples from the Bearing race kept quiet; no one tried to defend themselves.
<br><br>
After a while, Seamus finally spoke up, "Okay, I'm done making arrangements. Rex, it's your turn to face Milo."
<br><br>
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, a warrior from the Bearing race stepped onto the Soul Arena.
<br><br>
And just like that, the second battle began. Rex Ji was a little stronger than Deon. No one knew what kind of soul theurgy he had cultivated, but every time Milo slashed at him with the Mind Sword, Rex flitted away with ease, as though he were as light as a feather.
<br><br>
Zen's brows furrowed. This wasn't a fight; this was just a game of cat and mouse.
<br><br>
It looked as though Rex Ji had no intention of attacking. He continued to tirelessly dodge Milo's strikes, darting around the arena like a graceful gazelle.
<br><br>
"Are you here to fight me? Or are you just here to run away?" Milo asked impatiently, his nostrils flaring.
<br><br>
Rex Ji seemed unbothered by Milo's taunts. He floated about the arena, indifferent to Milo's attacks. It seemed that he still didn't plan to seriously fight the battle.
<br><br>
"Okay, fine."
<br><br>
Milo raised his eyebrows, evidently exerting more effort now. The white truth aura spun more violently around him, the Mind Sword crashing down at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
As Milo attacked with all his strength, Rex Ji's expression changed to that of worry. Suddenly, his dodges were less graceful, until he was cornered, just like his predecessor. Throwing his hands up immediately, Rex Ji admitted defeat, too.
<br><br>
"Get out of here." Milo waved his hand impatiently.
<br><br>
He knitted his brows, wondering what trick Seamus was playing. How could he have sent a warrior to play hide and seek with him? "This is the last round. Are you going to send someone from your race, or will you fight me yourself?" Milo called out to Seamus.
<br><br>
Seamus surveyed the Soul Arena. Multitudes of Souls of Light flashed purple around the arena. It seemed most of the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace had gathered there. A look of satisfaction crept on his face as he strode confidently to the center of the arena.
<br><br>
"You dawdled for two hours!" Milo mocked. "Don't tell me you're going to go back on your words!" Milo crossed his arms over his chest to assert dominance.
<br><br>
Seamus's face broke into an even wider smile. Anyway, people on the Other Shore couldn't see each other's expressions. He said, "Go back on my words? The petty soul crystal is nothing compared to the lives of more than half of the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace!" He threw his head back and laughed maniacally.
<br><br>
Almost all the elite disciples on Stage Four had come to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Only a small part who were exploring on Stage Twelve and Stage Thirteen were still on the way here. But Seamus thought the number of warriors that had gathered here was enough.
<br><br>
Milo's expression changed. "What do you mean?"
<br><br>
Dorothy and Zen exchanged anxious glances.
<br><br>
They felt that something was wrong from the beginning, and only now did they finally realize what was going on: it was all an elaborate trap! Seamus only wanted to gather the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace in one place and kill them off! Dorothy gasped. Was Seamus crazy? "Retreat!"
<br><br>
Zen shouted as he grabbed Dorothy and flew backwards.
<br><br>
Although he didn't know what tricks Seamus had under his sleeve, he didn't want to wait to find out. All the disciples who had come to watch were unprepared for an ambush. Anxious cries rose from the crowd.
<br><br>
Seamus continued to laugh hysterically. He and his men had been plotting this for a long time; they were ready for any type of response.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Seamus raised his hands higher. Out of nowhere, Soul Binding Threads burst forth from the ground in a ten thousand-foot radius around the Soul Arena, coiling around the ankles of each and every Soul of Light present.
<br><br>
While this didn't restrict their movement, they were tied to the Other Shore and could not leave there.
<br><br>
Chapter 3232 Champion Fish And Smoke Wall It was said that a soul was as light as a feather. It drifted anywhere, wherever the wind went.
<br><br>
However, the same rule did not apply in the Other Shore. Souls of Light were heavy. They didn't have the ability to float and fly. Warriors needed a boat to simply cross the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
When the Soul Binding Threads spread all over an area, it meant that people would move very slowly in that area.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace eagerly wanted to return to the temple to wait for the effect of the Soul Binding Threads to disappear and then they could leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy were moving swiftly through the crowd, unaffected by the Soul Binding Threads at their feet.
<br><br>
Despite his seeming confidence, Zen was wary that something bad was going to happen.
<br><br>
The Bearing race was making bold moves. They even used soul crystal as bait. Seamus wouldn't let go of them easily.
<br><br>
By the time Zen and Dorothy, leading the crowd, had rushed three to four thousand feet, shadows of altars appeared in the distance.
<br><br>
The altars had steps. They were roughly the size of a house and looked a little unsophisticated.
<br><br>
Zen squinted his eyes to investigate the altars better. He was clueless as to what those altars were for.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace knew better. They all muttered a gasp of recognition.
<br><br>
"Champion Fish! These are the Champion Fish Altars!"
<br><br>
"Where did they get so many Champion Fish Altars?"
<br><br>
"There are at most ten-odd of them in the Stage Twelve of Other Shore. But here, there must be over a hundred of them!"
<br><br>
Altars nearly encircled every inch of the arena.
<br><br>
"What is Champion Fish Altar?" Zen asked with a frown.
<br><br>
Although Dorothy had an Indigo Soul, she also had a similarly limited experience as Zen when it came to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Luckily, she had heard of Champion Fish. "The Champion Fish is a common creature living in the Other Shore. They like gathering inside altars."
<br><br>
A huge sea of sand covered Stage Twelve. Within its vicinity, temples of more than ten greatest races stood.
<br><br>
Almost all of these temples required an Other Shore Key to enter. Only the Champion Fish Temple did not. One could simply come and go as they pleased.
<br><br>
However, it was a very dangerous place. It posed greater risks than Stage Thirteen. Warriors who had entered the Champion Fish Temple were rumored to have gone downhill. It was common practice for the warriors to avoid the temple altogether.
<br><br>
Now, the Bearing race had moved so many Champion Fish Altars from Stage Twelve of Other Shore here. No one could figure out how they did it.
<br><br>
The elites of the Oneness Sky Palace who had been in the Champion Fish Temple were scared. They knew how scary it was and they trembled at the sight of the altars.
<br><br>
"Rush over," Zen ordered without any hesitation.
<br><br>
"Alright," Dorothy said with determination.
<br><br>
They knew that the longer they stayed, the more vulnerable they became.
<br><br>
That was another attempt to get rid of them. They had no choice but to fight head-on.
<br><br>
When Zen and Dorothy were about a thousand feet away from the altars, a mirror suddenly appeared on each of the altars. Fish that looked like carps with thick scales could be seen in the mirrors. On their backs, a pair of wide wings fluttered and tusks were contained in their mouths.
<br><br>
When the mirrors appeared, fish leapt out until there were more than ten of them on each altar.
<br><br>
The Champion Fish was a creature living within Stage Twelve. They were formidable and terrifying creatures, especially in groups. The warriors gasped in horror. Even the strongest among them trembled with fear, much more those only in the fourth or fifth stage of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! A handful of Champion Fish hurled themselves towards Zen.
<br><br>
Zen squinted his eyes. He rolled over and, with a flick of his wrist, purple light beamed from his hand. His fingers transformed into five sharp thorns which allowed him to stab each of the fish that came his way.
<br><br>
Bang! "Blocked?"
<br><br>
Zen looked mortified.
<br><br>
It turned out a different technique was needed to approach the fish.
<br><br>
They were different from the Soul Snakes they had previously fought. The Soul Snakes were much easier to deal with for someone like Zen and Dorothy.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! A Champion Fish made contact with Zen's prickly finger and flopped to the ground. However, in just a matter of seconds, it quickly bounced up and flapped its wings with full momentum. It seemed unfazed by Zen's attacks.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
A fierce light flashed in Zen's eyes. His body flashed with purple light.
<br><br>
Above him, a white energy cyclone hovered.
<br><br>
"Mind Sword!"
<br><br>
Milo's Heart Slaughtering Strike might be powerful, and he was far more proficient in it than Zen.
<br><br>
But Heart Slaughtering Strike's power depended on the strength of the warrior's Soul of Light.
<br><br>
As Zen had an Indigo Soul now, the invisible Mind Sword became more powerful than Milo's Heart Slaughtering Strike.
<br><br>
With a swift wave of Zen's Mind Sword, some of the Champion Fish erupted into pieces.
<br><br>
Seamus had been observing everything from the back of the Soul Arena.
<br><br>
His eyes widened at the sight of Zen using the Mind Sword.
<br><br>
He thought Milo was already powerful. He did not expect someone else to come forward with the unique ability. However, Zen was proving himself to be more powerful than Milo. Seamus made a mental note of what he had seen. He knew this was golden information he had to report to his superiors.
<br><br>
The power of the invisible Mind Sword was far beyond the scope of a Soul of Light's ability in the Lust World.
<br><br>
"You're capable. So what? You'll still end up dead today," Seamus sneered.
<br><br>
He then ordered his men, "Ask the Divine Farmer race to kill them. Nobody will be spared!"
<br><br>
Plenty of people from the Divine Farmer race stood as part of the audience.
<br><br>
Their presence had long been part of the plan.
<br><br>
After Seamus had given the orders, pink seeds emerged from the edge of the area covered by the Soul Binding Threads. Slowly, the seeds sprouted.
<br><br>
Soon, they were going to bear fruits.
<br><br>
As soon as that happened, the fruits withered and started to smoke.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer race were good at making pills and poison. But the smoke wasn't poison; the smoke curtains created a special enchanted barrier.
<br><br>
When the curtains of smoke reached a few hundred feet above ground, members from the Divine Farmer race said in unison, "Condense!"
<br><br>
The smoke did as ordered. It condensed into a solid round wall that entrapped the disciples within it.
<br><br>
On the other side, Zen was occupied battling the Champion Fish. Together with Dorothy, they had killed at least forty of those fish.
<br><br>
They were surprised to see the weird wall block their way as they reached the altars.
<br><br>
"Shatter!"
<br><br>
Zen's mind activated. His Mind Sword stabbed the wall of smoke.
<br><br>
The Mind Sword successfully pierced it but, to Zen's dismay, it wasn't able to fully penetrate it. There was something strange with the wall. No matter how hard Zen tried, he could not break it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3233 Predicament As Zen tried to destroy the smoke wall, several Champion Fish rushed towards him secretly.
<br><br>
They had begun to open their mouths, ready to bite into Zen's body when a small sword pierced through them, cutting all of them into pieces.
<br><br>
"Be careful, Zen," Dorothy warned, concerned.
<br><br>
Dorothy was keeping an eye on Zen's surroundings while he concentrated on destroying the wall.
<br><br>
"This wall is too strong. It's too difficult to destroy," Zen said, frowning.
<br><br>
They could neither break through the wall, nor leave the Other Shore. A constant stream of Champion Fish kept emerging from the altars. This was a dead end for the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The Champion Fish could not hurt Zen but the other disciples were in great trouble.
<br><br>
The Champion Fish shot out of the altars from all directions and charged at the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race seemed to have used some special method that caused the Champion Fish to ignore them.
<br><br>
One of the weaker disciples was slower than the others in his escape and soon found himself surrounded by a large group of Champion Fish. Before he could react, the malicious creatures had torn his Soul of Light apart. He screamed in pain, desperate for relief, as his soul was mercilessly ripped into shreds. But his scream only lasted three seconds before the Champion Fish ate up his soul.
<br><br>
As more and more disciples met the same fate, their pathetic screams echoed across the place from time to time. It was like witnessing the worst kind of hell on earth as the Champion Fish devoured the Souls of Light of the poor disciples.
<br><br>
Quite a few elites of the Oneness Sky Palace were present and all of them, including Milo, could protect only themselves.
<br><br>
"There's no point in going on like this," Zen muttered, as the number of Champion Fish swelled. He climbed onto an altar and roared, raising his voice through his soul power, "All disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace! Please stay close to me!"
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace heeded his words and began to move towards him.
<br><br>
Zen had been charging forward at the front, the rest following him in a loose formation. At his summons, the elite disciples gathered together tightly, trying to keep as close to him as possible.
<br><br>
The weaker disciples were at the center, surrounded and protected by the others, while the Indigo Souls who were capable of fighting the Champion Fish remained in the outer circle.
<br><br>
They stayed close to each other, their backs against the edges of the altars.
<br><br>
The Champion Fish kept coming at them with a ferocity that was unmatched. But the moment they made it near the crowd, the disciples' joint attacks succeeded in killing them.
<br><br>
"Don't panic! Stand your ground!"
<br><br>
"We have the power to fight against these fish!"
<br><br>
"Let's fight the Bearing race to death since they didn't allow us to leave!"
<br><br>
Now that they were out of danger, the elite disciples calmed down quickly and began to encourage their companions. They soon managed to erase their fears and regain their confidence to fight.
<br><br>
"Zen! Let me help you!"
<br><br>
a man shouted, jumping onto the altar that Zen was standing on.
<br><br>
Zen recognized the man's voice. Konnor.
<br><br>
"Konnor? I didn't know you were here!" Zen said, surprised.
<br><br>
"I only came here as a spectator. I didn't expect things to take such a turn,"
<br><br>
Konnor grumbled.
<br><br>
Most disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had come here out of curiosity. It was possible that some of them wanted to acquire the soul crystal of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Zen had neither the time nor the mood to listen to Konnor's complaints.
<br><br>
Now that so many disciples had gathered around him, he hoped that they could think up a way to destroy the smoke wall. He said, "This wall of smoke is proving difficult to destroy. If any of you have an idea of how to deal with it, please come and have a try!"
<br><br>
Zen had tried all the tricks in his book until a few moments ago. His Mind Sword was sharp and powerful but he hadn't been able to make a single dent in the wall.
<br><br>
These elite disciples came from different mountains in the Oneness Sky Palace, and they all cultivated different types of theurgies. Zen hoped that some of them might have practiced powerful soul theurgies that could destroy the wall.
<br><br>
Saying thus, Zen jumped off the altar and made his way to the outer circle to help the other elite disciples kill the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
"Let me do it!"
<br><br>
A man flew out of the crowd and came to stand on the altar.
<br><br>
"It's Efrain!"
<br><br>
"The best of talents from the Azure Mountain!"
<br><br>
"His power is on par with Milo's, and his cultivation base is even higher than Milo's!"
<br><br>
As the crowd hissed with excitement and gazed up at him in awe, purple flames began to appear on the surface of Efrain's soul. His Soul of Light seemed to be burning. He slapped both hands onto the wall, causing the peculiar purple flames to climb the wall, lapping fiercely against it.
<br><br>
This purple flame was a soul skill unique to the Azure Mountain. Disciples could rarely grasp it.
<br><br>
Fiery as the purple flames were, they had almost no effect on the wall. They just paled slightly in color. There was no sign of any substantial damage at all.
<br><br>
Efrain tried a number of times but when he saw that he was making no difference, he shook his head helplessly and jumped off the altar. "I can't destroy this wall," he said with a sigh.
<br><br>
"Let me try!"
<br><br>
"And me!"
<br><br>
The elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace took turns to try their luck with the wall, displaying their unique skills in the process.
<br><br>
Zen killed the Champion Fish as they charged at him, but he also had an eye on what was going on behind him. He couldn't help but feel disappointed at the various soul theurgies that his companions were using.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace had a serious disadvantage. It was one of the three orthodox forces of the human race, but it was in fact a union of a number of clans. The seven mountains were separated from each other and each had their own set of systems. They were not merged together as one whole.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race both consisted only of members from the same race, who shared bloodlines with each other. They had had the advantage of strong cohesion on many occasions before — an advantage that the Oneness Sky Palace would never be able to acquire.
<br><br>
The elite disciples who had the confidence to destroy the wall took turns trying their luck with the wall. But every single one of them ended up failing.
<br><br>
"We can't break this wall!"
<br><br>
"What should we do now?"
<br><br>
"We can't just sit around trapped in this place, right?"
<br><br>
As they spiraled into desperate discussions, the Champion Fish continued to emerge from the altars and rain down on them.
<br><br>
They had gathered all their strength and killed a number of Champion Fish.
<br><br>
But their soul power was limited. They could still consume soul pills to replenish their power, but they would eventually use up all of the pills if they couldn't manage to find a way out.
<br><br>
They would all die even if they were to guard themselves while staying put.
<br><br>
"Why don't we try to destroy the altars instead?" someone piped up suddenly.
<br><br>
The altars that the Bearing race had summoned had fully materialized by now. Dorothy and a few others stepped gingerly onto some of them. If any Champion Fish were to fly out of the altars, they could immediately kill them from where they stood.
<br><br>
There were over a hundred altars here. If they could destroy all of them, they might still have a chance of surviving.
<br><br>
"I don't think it's that easy," Dorothy said skeptically.
<br><br>
The Necklace of Mystic Soul hanging on her chest flashed and a soul sword that had been floating beside, shot fiercely towards an altar.
<br><br>
Ding! But the small sword merely bounced away with a clanging sound.
<br><br>
These altars were almost as strong as the temples, which was why they were unable to break them.
<br><br>
A few other disciples tried to have a go after Dorothy, but ended up with the same result.
<br><br>
Zen frowned at this disappointing sight, wondering what else they could do.
<br><br>
If his Soul of Light could get out of the Other Shore and he then returned with his physical body, he believed that he could destroy these altars.
<br><br>
But if he could get out of the Other Shore, it meant that the others could do just the same. This would no longer be a predicament to them.
<br><br>
Splash! The Champion Fish in the distance were swirling and spiraling upwards into the air, forming a protecting layer around a Soul of Light. Seamus.
<br><br>
"You're still under the illusion that you have a chance of survival, aren't you?" Seamus said, smiling. "Let me break the illusion for you and turn you into feed for these Champion Fish!"
<br><br>
He had barely finished talking when a faint golden light flashed across the mirrors on all the altars. The Champion Fish emerging from the mirrors grew several times in size.
<br><br>
Chapter 3234 Impulse Studying the Champion Fish whose size was exceedingly bigger than before, all the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace lost their ability to speak.
<br><br>
Never having encountered such a situation, they stood with their feet rooted to the ground.
<br><br>
"I'll go kill him!"
<br><br>
Milo blurted out abruptly, breaking the deathlike silence.
<br><br>
Even though everyone knew they were caught in a trap carefully designed by the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race, the fact that Milo had blindly facilitated their plan could not be denied.
<br><br>
The overwhelming pressure and guilt weighing down on his shoulders kept him silent from the beginning. He only had one thing on his mind, and it was to kill those Champion Fish to redeem himself.
<br><br>
Witnessing Seamus act more and more rashly, Milo could not just stand by and watch anymore.
<br><br>
Seamus was the source of all problems. He was obviously the one who was controlling the altars and the Champion Fish like some puppeteer.
<br><br>
Apart from destroying the altars and breaking the wall to escape, killing Seamus could be an alternative way. However, it would still pose a challenge due to him being guarded by several layers of Champion Fish.
<br><br>
"Don't be impulsive, Milo! You'll jeopardize everything!"
<br><br>
"Seamus must have taken all necessary preventive measures against us today!"
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Konnor and the others tried to calm him down by reasoning with him.
<br><br>
But it was to no avail. Milo shook off all their pleas as he clenched his fists, a cold aura beginning to emit from his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Even though Milo was arrogant, he was still a levelheaded person. Ever since he went up the mountain, not once did he lose his cool over anything.
<br><br>
But now, it seemed Seamus had stepped over his last nerve and driven him off the edge of sanity.
<br><br>
Swish! Milo's figure flashed at the speed of light as they all watched him charge towards Seamus without any hint of hesitation.
<br><br>
"No! Milo, stop!"
<br><br>
"He's heading to his death! Somebody stop him!"
<br><br>
"Who can get him back?"
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace erupted in frustration as they all screamed in unison.
<br><br>
No matter how strong Milo was, there was no way he could survive the besiege laid by the countless Champion Fish.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Someone else was seen heading in the same direction as Milo from the crowd.
<br><br>
While the person rushed forward, he left a series of purple flames behind from his steps! "Efrain?"
<br><br>
"Efrain! What are you doing?"
<br><br>
Judging from his speed and determination, it did not seem like he went on a rescue mission to get Milo back. But, he was going to assist Milo in his attempt to kill Seamus! "Staying here is like inviting death to consume us all! Instead of waiting for our end, why don't we just fight for our lives?" That was all Efrain said to the disciples who tried to stop him.
<br><br>
Those who were strong enough to stand out from others in the Oneness Sky Palace were by no means afraid of going face to face with death.
<br><br>
Both Efrain and Milo had gone through their fair share of life and death situations. And neither of them shied away from making desperate decisions when faced with challenging circumstances! "I'll go too!"
<br><br>
Zen's figure began to flash as he prepared to charge towards Seamus as well.
<br><br>
"Zen, wait!"
<br><br>
Dorothy shouted desperately from afar.
<br><br>
"What is it?" Zen hesitated to turn to look at her.
<br><br>
"Please, be careful..."
<br><br>
Dorothy was worried about him, but she didn't stop him. They would have a less chance of survival if both Milo and Efrain died. If they really wanted to kill Seamus today, their best bet would be to cooperate and launch their mightiest strike together.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Following their lead, another pair of warriors emerged from the crowd with determination. Both of them were Indigo Souls. They were outstanding warriors coming from the Ivory Mountain and the Bright Mountain, respectively.
<br><br>
Seeing the five tenacious figures approach him with agility, Seamus put on a smug smile. "The desperate rabbits will bite. What a pity, they all seem to be courting death..."
<br><br>
With a gentle gesture of his hand, he pointed at Milo, who was in the lead.
<br><br>
In response to his command, the Champion Fish swarmed over towards Milo like a gust of wind.
<br><br>
Each of these fish was quite tough. Ordinary means of attack just wouldn't suffice in tearing their scales apart, and there were thousands of them. One on top of the other, they forged a thick wall and made their way towards Milo.
<br><br>
Milo's young face was full of coldness, and the aura of his Soul of Light became colder, which could even be sensed by people from some distance away.
<br><br>
"Do you honestly believe that these things can stop me?"
<br><br>
Milo turned over, and his Mind Sword responded to his growing rage. It began to swirl around him crazily in frantic movements, like a blade of a windmill.
<br><br>
Biff, Biff, Biff, Biff...
<br><br>
Every Champion Fish that came within a ten feet radius of Milo was brutally cut into pieces by his Mind Sword. He actually managed to power through the wall made of Champion Fish and charged towards Seamus.
<br><br>
"Huh..."
<br><br>
Seamus remained unfazed by this sight, he still had other moves up his sleeve.
<br><br>
The army of Champion Fish he sent out at the beginning was small. He didn't pin his hopes on them to kill the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. But then, more Champion Fish of huge sizes came out of the altars and revealed themselves. Slowly, they stationed themselves behind Seamus as if they were the last layer of protection he had. These bigger ones were surely not easy to deal with.
<br><br>
However, Seamus seemed to have overlooked one detail, and that was how fast Milo could move.
<br><br>
Now in a state of sheer madness, Milo was out of control as he went all out to activate his soul force. It was as if his whole figure had morphed into a sharp blade, rushing to his target with incredible speed.
<br><br>
Crack, crack...
<br><br>
Efrain, Zen, and the other two had broken through the wall of the Champion Fish and watched in shock at how fast Milo was advancing.
<br><br>
"The speed of Milo... is amazing!"
<br><br>
"How did he achieve that?"
<br><br>
"He seems a little unnatural!"
<br><br>
The warriors on the Other Shore did not use their eyes to see. Instead, they used their souls to perceive things.
<br><br>
Milo's soul grew more and more ruthless with time. His aura was bonechilling cold like that of the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
Phew! Not only did his increasing speed surpass the expectations of Zen and Efrain, but Seamus was caught off guard as well.
<br><br>
When Seamus regained his senses, Milo was already only a hundred feet away from him! Not knowing how to deal with the situation, Seamus remained dumbfounded with his eyes fixated on Milo. Fear began to seize him as he felt himself give up.
<br><br>
He was not strong enough to go against Milo if they were up against each other in a fair fight. And now, Milo was going all out rampaging towards him. How could Seamus be willing to risk his life fighting Milo? The only logical plan spiraling in his mind now was to retreat! Phew! However, he could never escape in time as Milo's speed far surpassed his.
<br><br>
Soon, the distance between them had closed significantly.
<br><br>
Zen, Efrain, and the other two warriors quickly rushed over to watch the scene more closely. A glimmer of hope flashed through their hearts. 'Can he really do it? Can Milo kill Seamus and end it once and for all?' they started to wonder to themselves.
<br><br>
"Mind Sword!"
<br><br>
Milo roared in aggravation as he unleashed a sharper aura than before. An invisible Mind Sword began to take its form in front of him.
<br><br>
As the sword was about to kill Seamus, the ground beneath Milo's feet cracked open.
<br><br>
Bang! A vine full of sharp teeth extended from the open ground and wrapped itself around Milo, restraining him! Meanwhile, Seamus, who was retreating, stopped in his tracks and began to laugh viciously. "Surprised? Don't forget, I didn't come here alone!"
<br><br>
This trap was carefully planned. It was a joint work from the elite disciples of the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race. Seamus' job was only to control the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
"In remembrance to your bravery, I'll grant you a quick and painless death!"
<br><br>
Seamus gloated while waving his hands gently once more.
<br><br>
Upon his command, the huge Champion Fish gathered from all directions and charged at Milo with an intent to kill. In the blink of an eye, Milo was surrounded with no place to retreat.
<br><br>
"No! Milo!"
<br><br>
"No way! Milo!"
<br><br>
"Somebody, please go save him!"
<br><br>
The expressions of Efrain, Zen, and the others switched immensely. If he fell into the mouth of these Champion Fish, his Soul of Light would be devoured within a split second. Milo might not be able to survive this.
<br><br>
Chapter 3235 A Chance Of Surviving Efrain was the first to rush over to where the huge Champion Fish were tangled together, knitted into a huge fish column. Zen followed closely behind.
<br><br>
Milo was trapped in the middle of the column.
<br><br>
"Burn!" Efrain shouted.
<br><br>
A sizzling noise rent the air.
<br><br>
Purple soul flame had begun to burn intensely.
<br><br>
Efrain's soul flame was powerful. The huge Champion Fish had thick, rough skin, but under the soul flame's intensity, their twisting bodies were scorched black.
<br><br>
Efrain removed the charred corpses of the fish from the outer layer. But there were still a lot of fish inside. No one knew how many layers of fish had wrapped themselves around Milo.
<br><br>
Zen was also working hard and trying his best to save Milo, but to no avail so far.
<br><br>
Killing these fish was much more difficult than they had imagined. These were several times stronger than the smaller ones they had dealt with before.
<br><br>
Even with his sharp Mind Sword, Zen had managed to kill only six of them.
<br><br>
They looked at each other, their hearts sinking. It looked like Milo was going to die this time.
<br><br>
They needed to be careful of the Champion Fish sneaking up on them while they tried to save Milo. What was more, they had to be cautious of the creepy vines that sprang suddenly out of the ground.
<br><br>
Seamus had, in fact, intended to finish off Zen and the other four warriors who had come to attack him. He had sent only half the number of Champion Fish to attack the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. The other half kept gathering together, forming a huge circle.
<br><br>
To Seamus, the guys who were rushing towards him were already dead.
<br><br>
Zen suddenly felt a chill emanating from the column that the Champion Fish had formed.
<br><br>
Efrain was burning the Champion Fish with his soul flame. But it was extinguished the moment the chill began to spread outwards.
<br><br>
"It's so cold!"
<br><br>
This chill was a hundred times more horrifying than that of the Sea of Truth. Even Zen and Efrain who had Indigo Souls had to beat a retreat.
<br><br>
The Champion Fish that formed the column wriggled madly, and only stopped moving when the chillness spread over them. It wasn't long before the entire column froze and became a solid, unmoving column.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Cracks began to appear on the surface of the column, and those huge Champion Fish broke as well.
<br><br>
Seamus looked at the column, confused. He could not figure out the kind of method that was used to freeze the Champion Fish so instantly.
<br><br>
Seamus's puzzlement lasted just a moment before the fish column broke and shattered. The Champion Fish and the vines that had trapped Milo turned into pieces. A blue sharp sword radiance shot towards Seamus.
<br><br>
'This is the Mind Sword. But where did the chill come from?' Zen wondered.
<br><br>
The Mind Sword was originally colorless and invisible. But the chillness it contained was so strong that its energy manifested itself so that it outlined the originally invisible Mind Sword in a tinge of light blue.
<br><br>
Seamus hadn't expected this to happen! He was stunned at the sudden surge of sword radiance coming his way.
<br><br>
He took a deep breath before ducking out of the way in a bid to dodge the attack.
<br><br>
The sword radiance brushed past Seamus's arm. His arm went numb, losing all sense of touch. The chill managed to injure his soul.
<br><br>
"Milo!"
<br><br>
The moment he had launched the strike, Milo fell from the sky onto the frozen corpses of the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
Milo's soul was left incomplete from being trapped by the vines and bitten by the Champion Fish. His arms were gone, his torso ripped, and his soul had become badly damaged.
<br><br>
But he was able to unleash a terrifyingly powerful strike even in this state.
<br><br>
Efrain and the others who had witnessed it were impressed by the braveness of the act.
<br><br>
Zen didn't have time to check on Milo.
<br><br>
It was obvious that Milo must have paid a huge price to be able to perform that strike and freeze the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
But he missed his target and failed to kill Seamus.
<br><br>
Zen caught sight of Seamus fleeing. He wasn't about to let go of this opportunity. He followed Seamus.
<br><br>
Seamus calmed down after a short period of panicking.
<br><br>
The Champion Fish obeyed his orders and this was his greatest advantage.
<br><br>
As he spotted Zen following him, he waved a hand and the Champion Fish rushed to create a barrier between him and Zen. At the same time, a seed began to sprout from the ground under Zen.
<br><br>
Milo's situation had become desperate after having been wrapped up in the vines that grew from the seed. Zen had learned his lesson from Milo and was on constant guard.
<br><br>
The seed began to grow into vines and spread to Zen. But his Mind Sword turned downwards and chopped at the vines, cutting them in half.
<br><br>
Zen was fast in his reactions but Seamus had already put quite some distance between himself and Zen.
<br><br>
The number of Champion Fish coming Zen's way from all directions was increasing. They would surround him if he hesitated for even a moment.
<br><br>
"I'll escape from the right!" he said to himself.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! He killed several Champion Fish before he found it was pointless to continue chasing Seamus. He escaped the encirclement from the right.
<br><br>
But the moment Zen found some breathing space, more Champion Fish emerged out of nowhere and began to chase him.
<br><br>
"You want to kill me? Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Seamus yelled, turning his attention to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen fought the fish off as he withdrew. But he only managed to dodge the fish a few times before he was cornered.
<br><br>
Behind him was the wall formed by smoke. There was no way out of here.
<br><br>
Zen frowned at the rapidly flapping wings of the Champion Fish, his jaw clenching. There were few tricks on the Other Shore that Zen could use to retaliate and he had fallen into a dead end this time.
<br><br>
He had never thought he would find himself in such a sticky situation when all he wanted was to watch a fight.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
As the Champion Fish closed in on him, Zen continued to control his Mind Sword and brought it down in continuous strikes. But the number of Champion Fish that were killed was too small when compared to the ones still making their way towards him.
<br><br>
"Eh?"
<br><br>
Zen was just about to give up when a sudden chill went through him.
<br><br>
"What's that?"
<br><br>
A sword mark could be seen on the smoke wall. It was the mark left by Milo's strike. Cold blue air rose around the mark.
<br><br>
The strike that Milo had launched with all his strength hadn't hit Seamus.
<br><br>
Instead, it brushed past his arm and had traveled several thousand feet to hit the wall.
<br><br>
"The wall is frozen!" Zen exclaimed, his eyes flashing.
<br><br>
Zen had no idea how things worked on the Other Shore, but in reality, anything that was frozen would become crisp.
<br><br>
Now Zen was in a desperate situation, and as the idea crossed his mind, he rushed along the smoke wall and headed towards the sword mark on the wall.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Thousands of Champion Fish were still chasing Zen, leaving hardly any space for Zen to move.
<br><br>
Crack! A Champion Fish caught up with him and bit him on the shoulder.
<br><br>
Zen's soul force burst out at the immense pain.
<br><br>
"Mind Sword!"
<br><br>
In a flash of white, three Mind Swords shot out simultaneously and circled around Zen, killing a lot of Champion Fish and clearing some space for him.
<br><br>
He continued along the space and finally closed in on the sword mark. His body ached from all the wounds that the Champion Fish had inflicted on him.
<br><br>
"Break!"
<br><br>
Zen was finally relieved. Uncaring about everything else, he activated his Mind Sword to hit the wall.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The wall that had been tough before became so crisp that it cracked under Zen's blow. A large round hole appeared on the wall.
<br><br>
Chapter 3236 Leaving The Other Shore For a moment, Zen stared at the enormous, gaping hole in the wall in surprise. The impact of Milo's sword strike was stronger than he'd thought.
<br><br>
Quickly, he moved forward and passed through the hole in the wall.
<br><br>
Once he got outside, Zen paused, observing the scene around him. A lot of disciples from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were clustered around the hole on the outer side of the wall, goggling at him.
<br><br>
When the wall had first appeared, trapping the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace inside, they hadn't been able to do anything. They could only wait anxiously outside.
<br><br>
So it came as a shock to everyone when a hole was suddenly blown in the wall, and a man emerged, seemingly unscathed.
<br><br>
"Didn't they say that the wall was impenetrable?"
<br><br>
"How could someone manage to break through the wall and escape?"
<br><br>
"Damn it! Stop him!"
<br><br>
shouted Seamus. His goal was to take down all the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace, and he was determined not to allow anyone to escape from inside the wall.
<br><br>
"You want to stop me? You are courting death!"
<br><br>
Zen said coldly, glaring at Seamus.
<br><br>
The cultivation base of those guarding the outside of the wall was much, much weaker than Zen's.
<br><br>
Zen had the ability to kill Indigo Souls; there was no doubt that he would find it easy to defeat these Souls of Light who had not yet become Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
Within the wall, Zen and the other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had suffered from the torment of the Champion Fish. This cruelty had roused his anger. Now, when he saw several Souls of Light moving to obey Seamus' command and attack him, Zen struck back without mercy. A white cyclone appeared on the surface of his soul.
<br><br>
"Mind Sword!"
<br><br>
The sharp Mind Sword formed between Zen's eyebrows and shot forward.
<br><br>
The invisible sword radiance slashed through the air and instantly killed the six people in front of Zen. Three of the dead had been close to becoming Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Bearing race looked at the bodies of the dead with wide eyes, struck with terror. Who was the young man who had emerged from the hole in the wall? He had just killed six powerful people in a single blow.
<br><br>
They instantly realized that even if they attacked him together, they would probably be no match for him.
<br><br>
"Back off!"
<br><br>
"Get out of the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
"Don't fight this guy head on!"
<br><br>
These disciples called out frantic instructions to each other as they retreated. Some left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen let them go. He had no way of trapping them, so if they left the Other Shore, there was nothing he could do.
<br><br>
More importantly, Dorothy and the other disciples were still trapped within the wall. The huge Champion Fish summoned by Seamus were very difficult to defeat, so Zen needed to return immediately to help his companions. If he did not rescue them soon, they might get killed by the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
He looked down at his feet. Blue light still shone brightly beneath his feet.
<br><br>
The Soul Binding Threads had not disappeared when he passed through the hole in the wall.
<br><br>
To test the Soul Binding Threads, Zen tried to leave the Other Shore. It didn't work.
<br><br>
'I must go to the temple and find a way to remove these threads, ' Zen thought to himself. His eyes gleamed.
<br><br>
His body was in Stage Four of the Other Shore. When his Soul of Light left the Other Shore and his body entered it, he would confront the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race once more. Then they would understand the meaning of real fear.
<br><br>
With a soft whooshing sound, Zen's Soul of Light turned into a sharp arrow.
<br><br>
He headed straight to the Oneness Sky Palace's temple.
<br><br>
Some distance away, huddled where they had retreated, the disciples of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race saw Zen leave. But they made no move to stop him. They thought they wouldn't be able to stop him even if they tried.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were on high alert, standing at the entrance of the temple with tense, nervous expressions. None of them dared to take a single step out of the temple.
<br><br>
"Who are you? Show me your soul mark!"
<br><br>
someone shouted at Zen as he approached the temple.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore, they could not see each other's face clearly. They were afraid that the incoming figure was a spy sent by the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Zen raised his hand and displayed the lines on his palm.
<br><br>
As soon as his identity had been verified, the people of the Oneness Sky Temple let Zen inside. Several people immediately formed a circle around him to ask what was going on.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Why have you returned alone?"
<br><br>
"Where is Efrain? He hasn't come back yet. He seems to be trapped inside the wall."
<br><br>
Seamus had enacted his bold plan so suddenly and unexpectedly that no one had gotten the chance to escape from the wall. The disciples in the temple realized that something terrible must be happening inside the wall, but they had no way of finding out what exactly was going on.
<br><br>
"There's no time to explain now," Zen said impatiently. "Quick, help me get rid of these Soul Binding Threads."
<br><br>
Some of the nearby disciples misunderstood Zen's words. They thought he was scared of what had happened and wanted to escape to the Source World. Angrily, someone said, "Tell us what's going on before you flee!"
<br><br>
"We should find a way to save the others!"
<br><br>
"We are absolutely safe here in the temple. They don't dare to enter. Don't be so timid!"
<br><br>
The disciples were making a great mistake in jeering at Zen for his supposed cowardice when he was already so angry. Zen's face darkened and he turned sharply towards the one who had called him timid.
<br><br>
"Timid?"
<br><br>
he sneered, grabbing the disciple.
<br><br>
The man that Zen had grabbed unceremoniously was also an Indigo Soul.
<br><br>
However, under the pressure of Zen's intimidating aura, he was unable to offer up any kind of resistance.
<br><br>
"I escaped the wall to find a way to rescue the others. I need to go back as soon as possible, and yet idiots like you are slowing me down with your ignorant comments! Do you actually think any of you could save them if you tried?" Zen shouted, losing his temper. "Tell me the way to remove these Soul Binding Threads. Now!"
<br><br>
The disciple in Zen's grip looked thoroughly daunted. "Go to the Soul Purifying Room. You can remove those Soul Binding Threads in there."
<br><br>
"Take me there," Zen ordered, throwing him onto the floor.
<br><br>
The man hastily got to his feet and led Zen away. The moment the two men disappeared, all the remaining disciples began talking at once. While they had been somewhat unsettled by Zen's flash of temper, they were still convinced he was trying to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"That guy must be really scared."
<br><br>
"From the way he looked, I'm afraid he won't dare to return to the Other Shore anymore."
<br><br>
"It's very selfish of him to only care about himself. There are so many Oneness Sky Palace elite disciples inside the wall. If we lose them all, it will be an enormous loss for us."
<br><br>
Everyone nodded and sighed. They wondered what they could do to help, but they couldn't think of anything.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen soon found himself at the door of the Soul Purifying Room. As he stepped inside, the patterns on the wall began to glow.
<br><br>
Zen stood in the center of the room, and the complex lights flickered and shimmered around him. He glanced down at his feet and saw the Soul Binding Threads dimming and then disappearing altogether.
<br><br>
As soon as the threads were gone, Zen didn't waste any more time. He used the Illusion Breaking Rune to get out of the Other Shore and return to his own room.
<br><br>
The moment he opened his eyes, a flame spread out from his body, completely covering him from head to toe. Then his body returned to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
As soon as he entered the Other Shore, he flew without hesitation towards the three temples.
<br><br>
On the way, he saw a tall statue standing at the entrance of the Bearing race's temple. He flew headlong towards the statue.
<br><br>
There was a loud crash as he collided with the statue.
<br><br>
It was completely destroyed, crumbling to the ground in shards. The statue had been a valuable one. It had stood proudly in its place of honor for countless years.
<br><br>
Shouts sounded from inside the temple when they saw the destruction.
<br><br>
"Hey! Who are you?"
<br><br>
"How dare you destroy the statue of our race!"
<br><br>
"You are dead!"
<br><br>
Several Souls of Light rushed out of the temple to confront the man who had demolished their treasure.
<br><br>
Zen ignored them. As he moved past the remnants of the statue, he kicked at the rubble, sending several stones flying like arrows towards the gate of the temple.
<br><br>
His body strength far exceeded his soul strength. A casual kick from his body was far greater than the power of his Indigo Soul. He knew that the stones he had kicked would turn pillars into dust and instantly eliminate any Souls of Light they hit.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't normally so bloodthirsty, but these were unusual circumstances.
<br><br>
It had been treacherous for the disciples of the Bearing race to lure the Oneness Sky Palace disciples into their trap to kill them all. Had it not been for Milo's astonishing sword attack that hit the wall, Zen himself would also be dead, eaten by the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
To be kind to his enemy was to be cruel to himself and his companions.
<br><br>
Right now, he had no time for lengthy combat. He needed to dispense with any distractions quickly and with finality so that he could hurry back to the wall and save the other Oneness Sky Palace disciples. Otherwise, he would directly tear down the temple of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Chapter 3237 The Real Strength Seamus scratched his chin in surprise. He didn't expect anyone would be able to escape.
<br><br>
Then again, he didn't expect that Milo's sword strike would freeze the wall and Zen would create a hole big enough for himself to get through.
<br><br>
With a shrug, Seamus waved the thought away. He didn't care about Zen's escape; after all, he was just one out of the many disciples gathered here.
<br><br>
Right after his escape, disciples of the Divine Farmer race blocked the hole.
<br><br>
What truly bothered Seamus was that the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace still fought fiercely despite being overpowered by the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
When Zen was trapped by the Champion Fish, Efrain carried the severely injured Milo on his back.
<br><br>
As Zen took care of majority of the Champion Fish, Efrain and the others grabbed the opportunity to escape. However, as they were rushing out, they saw Zen cornered by a group of massive Champion Fish. They felt their hearts sink, knowing they failed to turn the tables and even lost Zen.
<br><br>
Once Efrain and Milo were safely on the other side, the other disciples pressed their backs against the wall, fighting tooth and nail to defend themselves.
<br><br>
"Did Zen really get swallowed by the Champion Fish?" Unable to believe the news, Konnor grabbed Efrain by the arm, gripping him tightly.
<br><br>
The other elite disciples exchanged uneasy glances.
<br><br>
"He was too impulsive..."
<br><br>
"Alas, I don't think we'll be able to escape either. He isn't the only fallen disciple." Low morale permeated the atmosphere, as the disciples mourned the loss of their companions.
<br><br>
"Look!" someone suddenly cried out. "The Champion Fish are coming!"
<br><br>
Out of the five who had broken out of the encirclement and tried to kill Seamus, one had lost his life. However, they had managed to almost kill Seamus. While this lifted their spirits momentarily, they had been unable to turn the tables in their favor, dampening their spirits just as quickly.
<br><br>
The disciples banded together, ready to fight for their lives with everything they got.
<br><br>
However, upon a closer look, these Champion Fish looked different. They were bigger in size, on a higher defense level. It was extremely difficult to kill them off with only soul strength.
<br><br>
As swarms of Champion Fish surged forward to close in on their prey, the Oneness Sky Palace disciples gritted their teeth. Soon, the disciples dwindled in numbers as one by one, the Champion Fish killed or injured them. With every lost disciple, their morale sank lower and lower.
<br><br>
"We are done for."
<br><br>
"I never expected I'd die like this."
<br><br>
"I'm not giving up!"
<br><br>
Dorothy declared as her eyes gleamed with hope.
<br><br>
Among these disciples, only she knew that Zen was not dead. Not only was he still alive, but he had also rushed out of the wall.
<br><br>
Because she had left a mark in Zen's soul before, she even knew where his soul was.
<br><br>
She didn't know which stage of the Other Shore Zen's body was in. If he could come back here in his physical body, the crisis the Oneness Sky Palace was facing might be overcome.
<br><br>
As those around her were about to give up, she felt helpless.
<br><br>
Because only a small number of people knew that Zen was capable of entering the Other Shore in his body, she hesitated to tell the other disciples about this.
<br><br>
Eyes darting back and forth amidst the madness, Dorothy racked her brains trying to figure out how to boost the morale of her fellow disciples. "Guys, quit being too pessimistic! We have strong reinforcements on their way!"
<br><br>
"Strong reinforcements?"
<br><br>
"How is that possible?"
<br><br>
"We won't be saved unless the elders of our Oneness Sky Palace force the Bearing race to stop! But it seems the Bearing race has been plotting this for a while now."
<br><br>
Majority of the elite disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace were already here, fighting for their lives. Meanwhile, the masters in the Desire World were unable to return to the Lust World, and wouldn't be able to come to their rescue. They were doomed.
<br><br>
"There must be," Dorothy said with certainty. "I promise."
<br><br>
She could sense Zen's Soul of Light had already retreated from the Other Shore; at this rate, he should've been able to return to the Other Shore in his physical body by now. Looking around her, she noticed that, while her feeble attempt to cheer up the disciples was childish, they seemed to fight more fiercely now.
<br><br>
Even though everyone had a strong desire to survive, it was still difficult for them to fight off these Champion Fish.
<br><br>
The number of Champion Fish was doubled, and these Champion Fish came to the disciples to launch attacks.
<br><br>
Efrain and the other Oneness Sky Palace disciples managed to kill off a group of Champion Fish, and they cheered victoriously. However, seemingly endless hordes of Champion Fish still swarmed towards them.
<br><br>
"Ahhh... My arm!"
<br><br>
someone screamed hysterically. When Dorothy turned to look, the Champion Fish had already chomped off the disciple's arm.
<br><br>
"Help, help!"
<br><br>
But before Dorothy could even react, another disciple was dragged off by a Champion Fish and devoured.
<br><br>
More and more people were killed by the Champion Fish nonstop. In their desperation, the disciples lost all strategy and just lashed out wherever they could, leaving their attacks uncoordinated and clumsy.
<br><br>
The air was filled with piercing screams as Champion Fish continued to mercilessly devour the Oneness Sky Palace disciples.
<br><br>
Dorothy's expression darkened. Calming her soul, she reached out and clasped the Necklace of Mystic Soul that hung from her neck.
<br><br>
Buzz! Suddenly, a bright blue light emanated from the Necklace of Mystic Soul. A powerful aura shot out, causing the Champion Fish to whirl confusedly, retreating chaotically.
<br><br>
Somehow sensing the strange aura, Seamus smiled delightedly.
<br><br>
"That necklace is wonderful! I absolutely must get my hands on it."
<br><br>
The Champion Fish still swam about in complete chaos, temporarily out of control due to their fear.
<br><br>
But Dorothy couldn't hold out forever. The power of the Necklace of Mystic Soul only lasted half a minute before the aura began to fade. What was worse, she could not summon the sword now.
<br><br>
When the Champion Fish sensed the aura growing weaker, they surged forward once again.
<br><br>
At this point, most of the disciples had accepted defeat, resigning themselves to their gruesome fate.
<br><br>
"We're all going to die. There's no use trying to resist," said a lonesome voice.
<br><br>
Dorothy sat on the steps of an altar, gritting her teeth. Her mind was filled with doubt. Could she be wrong about Zen? Did he run away and refuse to come back? Or did he not make it because his body hadn't reached Stage Four of the Other Shore? Dorothy sighed. Disciples all around her fell prey to the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
Unable to watch this gruesome scene anymore, she closed her eyes.
<br><br>
Just as she was about to completely give in to her despair, she suddenly heard the sound of cloth being ripped violently.
<br><br>
Opening her eyes, she turned towards the direction of the sound. Much to her surprise, a large crack appeared on the wall not too far from her.
<br><br>
A pair of hands reached in from the other side of the wall, ripping open the crack. From the hole in the wall, a person stepped inside.
<br><br>
The disciples whipped their heads around to face the new presence. They could sense this person was not a Soul of Light, but a physical body.
<br><br>
"Who is he?"
<br><br>
"How did a physical body get here?"
<br><br>
"Haven't there been rumors about him? Someone has entered the Sea of Truth with his body. Is he the one?"
<br><br>
Although everyone was confused, they still had their guard up. After all, they didn't know if he was friend or foe.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace disciples had lost the will to fight, and froze in place, unsure of what to do. Even Seamus hesitated, unsure as to how to deal with this newcomer. But before he found the words to say, the figure stepped onto an altar.
<br><br>
Bang! With just a stomp, the Champion Fish Altar was smashed into thousands of pieces.
<br><br>
All the Champion Fish that were born from that altar suddenly exploded into thin air.
<br><br>
"What are you doing? Stop!" Seamus shouted at the figure in shocked anger.
<br><br>
The Bearing race had paid a price to get these altars that could produce Champion Fish. Each of the altars was extremely precious. Seamus didn't expect that someone could destroy the altars.
<br><br>
Zen ignored Seamus and proceeded to jump onto another altar, crushing it beneath his feet.
<br><br>
Bang! The second altar was smashed to pieces, and again, many Champion Fish vanished.
<br><br>
With every step he took, Zen trampled a Champion Fish Altar. Before Seamus even had the time to react, more than ten altars were destroyed, with nothing left but shards.
<br><br>
Chapter 3238 Pulverize Seamus stared at the broken altars. He clenched his fist as he felt his heart slowly breaking into pieces.
<br><br>
He had gone to such great lengths to take the altars here in advance. They weren't Souls of Light that could be withdrawn from the Other Shore instantly. If he wanted to move them back, it wouldn't be easy work.
<br><br>
The Bearing race did so much to acquire the altars. They were like treasures to them that would help them suppress other super forces in the Lust World of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Stop him!" shouted Seamus.
<br><br>
The warriors of the Divine Farmer race started to make their moves. From the ground, seeds suddenly sprouted with vines that rapidly moved towards Zen.
<br><br>
The power of the vines was not weak. As soon as the Souls of Light were restrained by the vines, it would be difficult for them to break free.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Soon enough, Zen was also tightly wrapped by green vines.
<br><br>
Moments ago, when the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace saw how the man displayed his mighty strength, they had their hopes pinned on him.
<br><br>
Now they started to feel worry when they saw that the man was entangled.
<br><br>
Crack! Within three seconds, Zen was able to break free from the vines.
<br><br>
He jumped up and trampled on another altar.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Zen trampled on each altar and broke them one by one.
<br><br>
He walked half circle along the wall and broke each Champion Fish Altar he walked past. He must have broken more than fifty.
<br><br>
No longer attempting to focus on killing the elite disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace, Seamus simply ordered the remaining Champion Fish to attack Zen all at once.
<br><br>
"Tear him up!" Seamus was seething with anger.
<br><br>
Everything was going according to plan until the physical body's sudden appearance. He had no idea how this had happened.
<br><br>
Those Champion Fish indeed posed a great threat to Souls of Light. Even Zen's Soul of Light was unable to withstand the biting of the Champion Fish, but it was a different case when his physical body was involved. He was unthreatened by the Champion Fish as his body remained unfazed. He saw them to be low-level beasts.
<br><br>
Zen screamed so hard that his body trembled slightly. As his body vibrated, anything that came in contact with him shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
It didn't take him a lot of effort. It was a low-level skill of the Might Godly Way that had no use to deal with warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the Source World. However, it was easy enough for it to work to deal with these Champion Fish.
<br><br>
Zen hurled himself towards the torrent of the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
Any Champion Fish that touched his body erupted into a cloud of blood.
<br><br>
"What trick is that?"
<br><br>
"It's so terrifying!"
<br><br>
"This man must be invincible on the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
The disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace murmured and whispered among themselves. They could not comprehend Zen's powers.
<br><br>
"That's not a unique skill. He's just vibrating his physical body. What's strange is that he used his body to enter the Other Shore," one of the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace said. He had seen through Zen's little trick.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Champion fish turned into blood wherever he went.
<br><br>
Within thirty seconds, all of the huge Champion Fish inside the wall were dead.
<br><br>
Huge Champion Fish still came out of the mirrors on the remaining altars, but they did not replenish fast enough. Zen was still able to kill all of them before they became too many.
<br><br>
Dorothy, seated on the steps of an altar, was finally breathing easy.
<br><br>
Zen's physical body had a lot of potential uses on the Other Shore. But after he entered the Oneness Sky Palace, he was focused on his cultivation.
<br><br>
Today, he finally found a chance to display his physical power.
<br><br>
Zen continued to pulverize the remaining Champion Fish and destroy the altars.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! As soon as the last altar was crushed, all the Champion Fish disappeared.
<br><br>
Seamus stomped his way towards Zen.
<br><br>
"You... Who on earth are you?" Seamus asked feebly.
<br><br>
Zen gazed at him coldly, looked him in the eye, and said, "You are not qualified to know."
<br><br>
He found no reason to expose his identity.
<br><br>
However, he knew that he might have shown too much of his skills. Just the fact that he was able to go through the wall and returned in his physical form could easily connect him with his true identity. However, even if some of them had speculations, they had no evidence.
<br><br>
"I don't care who you are. Everyone who has offended our race will die!"
<br><br>
Seamus retorted with a chuckle.
<br><br>
It was truly inconceivable that a corporeal body entered the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But there was only one such person here and Seamus assumed that he posed no threat. Seamus perked up and made sure he looked unfazed. "If you join our Bearing race, we can assure you great success," he said proudly. "What do you think?"
<br><br>
"Join you?" Zen snorted.
<br><br>
"Yes, won't that be great?" Seamus held on to a sliver of hope. He wanted Zen to agree.
<br><br>
"Not really." Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
"What a pity," Seamus responded. "If you won't join us, then get ready to be our enemy. I'll always remember what you did today. The world is big, but the Other Shore is small. We'll meet again."
<br><br>
Seamus turned to leave.
<br><br>
Despite what happened, he remained bloated with arrogance.
<br><br>
He was able to enter and exit the Other Shore freely, so leaving here would be easy. Soon, he would be back in the Source World.
<br><br>
Seamus's soul of Light began to blur. Suddenly, Zen's chuckles echoed in the air. "I don't think we'll ever meet again," he said.
<br><br>
"What?" Seamus was shocked.
<br><br>
Behind him, a Soul of Light quietly approached him. It was Efrain.
<br><br>
Souls of Light relied on spiritual sense to perceive everything on the Other Shore. Fortunately, Efrain had the special ability to hide his aura.
<br><br>
His soul flame glowed with a sinister green light that emitted no heat. It protected him and allowed him to sneak up on Seamus.
<br><br>
Splash! Efrain threw a handful of blue sand.
<br><br>
"Soul Restraining Sand!"
<br><br>
Like the Soul Binding Thread, the Soul Restraining Sand could prevent Souls of Light from leaving the Other Shore. It was what the Oneness Sky Palace used to trap people, while the Soul Binding Thread was more favored by the Bearing race. They both had their own advantages.
<br><br>
The surface of Seamus's soul was tainted with the Soul Restraining Sand.
<br><br>
He emitted a faint blue glow. Suddenly, his Soul of Light became visible again.
<br><br>
He shivered in fear. Under his breath, he was chanting the Illusion Breaking Rune in an attempt to break through the illusory Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, the grains of the Soul Restraining Sand firmly nailed him to the Other Shore. Every time he recited the Illusion Breaking Rune, the light emitted from the Soul Restraining Sand intensified.
<br><br>
"Chant all you want. You're stuck here." Efrain had a sinister smile on his face when he walked over.
<br><br>
Realizing that he couldn't leave the Other Shore, Seamus turned around and, with full speed, rushed towards the temple of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
But of course, Zen was not going to let him go.
<br><br>
He caught up with Seamus and gently lifted him up.
<br><br>
Seamus tried to counterattack. His soul force burst forth all of a sudden, forming two gray crescent-shaped energy waves that came at Zen like scissors. Still, with Zen's physical body, it was impossible that an Indigo Soul could hurt him.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Suddenly, there were two crisp sounds but Seamus's attack failed to even leave a mark on Zen's neck.
<br><br>
Chapter 3239 Begging For Pardon A look of despair appeared on Seamus' face when he saw that Zen was unharmed. Seamus couldn't believe that after he had unleashed an all-out strike, he didn't cause even a little damage to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen released a small portion of his strength, staring coldly at Seamus as he prepared to crush his soul. But Efrain suddenly shouted, "Don't kill him!"
<br><br>
Seamus had started this entire incident because he wanted to get revenge on Milo who injured his younger brother.
<br><br>
However, it was obvious the people of the Bearing race had used that as an excuse to attack and kill as many Oneness Sky Palace disciples as they could.
<br><br>
This event would leave a lasting impact. It would cause a dispute between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race that would linger for a long time. But Efrain realized that as long as Seamus was alive, they could use him to gather evidence against the Bearing race.
<br><br>
At Efrain's words, Zen paused, halting his attack.
<br><br>
To Zen's astonishment, at the precise moment that he stopped his strike, Seamus' Soul of Light began twisting and contorting. Seamus let out a series of strange, piteous screams.
<br><br>
There was an awful ripping sound.
<br><br>
Seamus' Soul of Light was torn into pieces in front of Zen.
<br><br>
Zen was dumbfounded. "I didn't kill him!"
<br><br>
Efrain frowned. "He was killed. Someone else killed him."
<br><br>
As they entered the Other Shore with their Souls of Light, their bodies still remained somewhere in the Source World. Efrain was suggesting that someone near Seamus' body in the Source World had been responsible for his death.
<br><br>
The failure of their trick had brought many members of the Bearing race back to the Source World. Now that Seamus was unable to go back, there must be something wrong with him.
<br><br>
Some powerful warriors could know from the souls of their juniors what happened in the Other Shore. When some masters of the Bearing race found that Seamus had been captured, they killed him immediately.
<br><br>
"Damn it," swore Zen, gritting his teeth.
<br><br>
"Wait, why does your voice sound familiar?" Efrain asked, glancing at Zen in confusion.
<br><br>
Except for Dorothy, the others didn't know Zen's real identity. He had consciously lowered his voice so they wouldn't recognize him.
<br><br>
But in the heat of the moment, Zen had forgotten to alter his voice, so he caught Efrain's attention.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Efrain was not expecting Zen to be here. Zen cleared his throat and lowered his voice again, ignoring Efrain's question. "I just didn't expect the Bearing race to be so decisive."
<br><br>
Cupping his hands toward Zen, Efrain said, "I agree, and thank you very much for your help, sir. May I know your name?"
<br><br>
Zen grinned. "Just call me Thad."
<br><br>
Zen's family name, Luo, was rare in the Oneness Sky Palace. So he decided to use only "Thad" as his name.
<br><br>
Efrain nodded, repeating the name silently to himself. He would keep Thad in mind when they left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
More disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace swarmed around Zen, peppering him with questions.
<br><br>
Standing in the crowd, Sophia looked at Zen. She had suspected him to be Zen before. Now she was certain. Yet she could see that Zen didn't intend to reveal his identity, so neither would she. She would not expose him against his will especially after he had just saved everyone's lives.
<br><br>
"All right, let's go back to the temple first," Zen said, fending off the questions everyone was asking him.
<br><br>
Many disciples had been killed. Some were injured, their souls damaged by the Champion Fish. Milo was also still in a coma. They had no time to waste.
<br><br>
The group gathered everyone who had sustained injuries and headed back to the temple.
<br><br>
Dorothy stayed where she was. As soon as everyone was gone, she went to Zen. "So now what? What are we going to do next?"
<br><br>
Zen gazed coldly at the temple of the Bearing race. His eyes narrowed, and he sneered, "Next, I want to tear down this temple!"
<br><br>
"Tear down their temple?" Dorothy raised her eyebrows. It sounded like a crazy plan.
<br><br>
"Follow me," Zen said as he walked towards the temple.
<br><br>
Even before this latest incident, Zen had wanted to demolish the temple of the Bearing race. At that time, however, there was peace between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race, so he didn't take any action.
<br><br>
Now that they were in the middle of a full-blown conflict, he had no qualms about finally destroying their temple.
<br><br>
"All right," Dorothy sighed.
<br><br>
Although Dorothy was a bit concerned, she didn't hesitate. If Zen was determined, then she would support him fully.
<br><br>
During what had happened on the Other Shore, the Oneness Sky Palace in the Source World was alert as well.
<br><br>
So many elites of the Oneness Sky Palace were in a precarious situation as they were trapped. Their deaths would be a huge loss to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Moreover, many of them were mountains' direct descendants. Even when this incident had just happened, some disciples in the temple quickly returned to the Source World and reported it to the elders of their mountains.
<br><br>
Masters of the seven mountains gathered together to discuss how to deal with the situation.
<br><br>
Athemar showed up to join in the meeting.
<br><br>
At first, the masters considered the possibility that the Bearing race intended to declare a war. But that didn't seem to fit.
<br><br>
A true, all-out war among the superpowers would be devastating for all involved. And if the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had wanted to do the most damage, it would have been better for them to attack the Oneness Sky Palace with all their powers instead of provoking a small-scale war on the Other Shore. It didn't make sense as this kind of action would only alert the powerful leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace and put them on guard.
<br><br>
As more and more news came from Stage Four of the Other Shore, the masters of the seven mountains soon grasped that the people of the Bearing race were killing the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, using revenge on Milo as an excuse.
<br><br>
As the Bearing race grew more and more powerful, they knew that the Oneness Sky Palace would hesitate before going to war against them. Now they had managed to eliminate a number of elites from the Oneness Sky Palace with a convenient excuse. Blaming their actions on Milo allowed them to evade responsibility for what they had just done. After all, they could claim that it was Milo who had started the conflict, and they were just trying to avenge one of their own.
<br><br>
Indeed, it didn't even matter whether or why Milo had injured Seamus' brother. The only thing that mattered was that getting revenge on Milo was a story plausible enough that the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't refute.
<br><br>
Over the span of several hours, the masters of the seven mountains had tried to contact the Bearing race through various channels, but the news that had been sent back was discouraging.
<br><br>
Some who replied were evasive and dishonest. Some outright ignored them.
<br><br>
There were even a few who accused the masters of allowing their disciple to hurt the people of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
All this filled the masters of the seven mountains with righteous indignation. Some of the masters, including Yasamin, were furious enough to suggest directly confronting the Bearing race. Yasamin was indignant because her beloved granddaughter was involved in the conflict.
<br><br>
They were discussing countermeasures when a new report arrived.
<br><br>
"Report! According to the message from disciples in the temple, most of the elite disciples of our palace have managed to get to safety!"
<br><br>
This news was quite welcome. The masters were initially surprised, then their shock gave way to joy.
<br><br>
The information they had previously collected had seemed to suggest that their elites probably wouldn't be able to survive. The risk of this terrible outcome had prompted them to beg for a pardon for their elites from the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"It seems that the Bearing race has given in."
<br><br>
"Good news."
<br><br>
"We must verify that they are truly safe as soon as possible."
<br><br>
As they celebrated, another news arrived. This time, the report came from the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"Report! Message from the Bearing race!"
<br><br>
"What is it?"' asked the head of the Golden Mountain quickly. "Tell us the news."
<br><br>
The man reporting the news replied, "They beg us to pardon them. They want us to stop tearing down their temple."
<br><br>
The mountain heads and the warriors who were present looked at each other in confusion, unsure as to what this was about. Who was destroying the temple of the Bearing race? Chapter 3240 Destruction Even the person who had brought them the message looked puzzled, unable to decipher the meaning of the message.
<br><br>
Destroying the temple? Were they serious? It was widely known that it wasn't easy to build a temple at the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was as difficult as destroying one.
<br><br>
He couldn't believe that someone belonging to the Oneness Sky Palace had really been able to destroy the temple of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
The heads of the mountains and many other masters of the Oneness Sky Palace present were just as bewildered as he was.
<br><br>
They couldn't understand the rapid change in the attitude of the Bearing race as a whole. And what did they mean by begging them for pardon? "Who brought the message to you?" Athemar asked.
<br><br>
"The Fire Emissary of the Bearing race," the person replied.
<br><br>
The Five-element Emissaries were the five famous warriors of the Bearing race who shared a high status in the great race.
<br><br>
"What does he mean? Is he serious?"
<br><br>
"Is someone really tearing down their temple?"
<br><br>
"That's something I'd like to know too!"
<br><br>
"There are many restrictions imposed on the temples. They can't be destroyed by ordinary people."
<br><br>
The heads of the various mountains erupted into discussion, each one of them secretly happy about the development.
<br><br>
This was because the Bearing race had earlier attempted to kill the elite disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. Now that they were getting their retribution, it was a huge relief to the people of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Athemar thought for a moment before turning to the messenger and saying, "This is our response to the Bearing race: we don't know who is tearing down their temple. We will conduct our own investigation before we give them another reply."
<br><br>
"Yes, master!"
<br><br>
the messenger said, bowing with respect. He then turned around and quickly exited the meeting hall.
<br><br>
After Seamus's failure, the remainder of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had either left the Other Shore or retreated to their temples.
<br><br>
They still thought their temples were safe places where they could hide in peace.
<br><br>
It was not easy to take down a temple.
<br><br>
After the Nine Li race had been defeated by the Bearing race in the war back then, they had escaped and gone into hiding. Only a small number of them had stayed on to guard their temple. Even so, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had continued to attack their temple for a long time before finally taking it down.
<br><br>
And now, the Bearing race was full of powerful warriors. Once other races began to attack their temple, a large number of their own people would come there for aid. The number of restrictions on their temple meant that nobody could easily invade it.
<br><br>
Just like the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, many members of the Bearing race also stood in front of the gates of their temple and watched on in curiosity.
<br><br>
"How did Seamus fail?"
<br><br>
"Didn't he say his plan was faultless?"
<br><br>
"Who knows what happened inside the smoke wall. It seems that someone tore the wall with bare hands!"
<br><br>
"How can there be such a powerful warrior in the Lust World? I don't believe it!"
<br><br>
While the members of the Bearing race watched and whispered among themselves, Zen and Dorothy made their way over to them.
<br><br>
Dorothy was on full alert, walking at a much slower pace than Zen.
<br><br>
Nobody would dare provoke him, especially since he had appeared here with his physical body. But Dorothy might face dangers since she was only an Indigo Soul. She was ready to leave the Other Shore at a moment's notice if any unfavorable situation were to arise.
<br><br>
"Someone is coming at us!"
<br><br>
"That guy in the front..."
<br><br>
"He's not a soul! What's wrong with him?"
<br><br>
Many members of the Bearing race still didn't know what was going on.
<br><br>
But as they watched Zen walking aggressively towards them, many of them left the Other Shore for safety. Some of them hid deep within their temple, while a few remained at the entrance, waiting for Zen to reach them.
<br><br>
Once Zen was close enough, they brought their hands together in respect and politely began to ask him, "Friend, what business has brought you to our-"
<br><br>
But Zen didn't heed them. He walked up to the wall and kicked a temple pillar.
<br><br>
Four huge pillars supported the main entrance of the temple of the Bearing race. Each of them was ten feet wide and supremely strong. But Zen's kick broke half the pillar into pieces, causing rubble to fly in all directions. The members of the Bearing race present there ducked, scared of Zen's sudden violence.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen landed a kick on the next pillar, destroying it by sending a crack through the middle.
<br><br>
"What are you doing? Don't you know that our race is the most-" a member of the Bearing race came forward bravely, his voice trembling with fear.
<br><br>
But Zen couldn't be bothered with him. He merely turned around and kicked the third pillar.
<br><br>
Zen had every reason to kill these crooked people in revenge, given the things that the Bearing race had done to the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. But he held himself back. . . .
<br><br>
The four pillars of the temple broke apart under Zen's violent kicks, causing the top of the temple to collapse with crashing groans and thuds.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race left the Other Shore for fear of being buried under the rubble of their temple.
<br><br>
Zen rushed inside the temple after tearing down the entrance.
<br><br>
But since he wasn't a member of the Bearing race, the moment he stepped inside, the restrictions imposed on the temple were immediately triggered by the invasion.
<br><br>
Just a few feet from Zen, a dozen tiles on the ground suddenly flipped over, beams of white light shooting out of the devices hidden beneath them. The Soul Purifying Light! Most temples were equipped with such devices. Even an Indigo Soul would be eliminated without a trace on being hit by the Soul Purifying Light. Such was the terrible cost of trespassing into an unfamiliar temple, which was why no one was usually willing to invade a temple.
<br><br>
Zen's physical body, though, was not afraid of the Soul Purifying Light.
<br><br>
The bright light illuminated Zen's body, but caused no damage at him.
<br><br>
Dorothy stood outside the temple and watched. She wouldn't enter it until Zen had destroyed all the restrictions inside the temple.
<br><br>
With several snaps, Zen moved swiftly around the temple and destroyed the devices within the tiles.
<br><br>
All the Soul Purifying Light vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
He then set his eyes on the pillars that supported the structure. Once he destroyed all of them, the entire temple would be reduced to rubble.
<br><br>
A commotion erupted within the Bearing race as Zen destroyed the temple.
<br><br>
The Five-element Emissaries were furious.
<br><br>
"Water Emissary, this is all your fault! Your idea of killing the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace has brought us no benefits and is showing us this horrific day!"
<br><br>
"And now they even dare destroy our temple. What a shame!"
<br><br>
"Fire Emissary, did the Oneness Sky Palace respond to our plea?"
<br><br>
Fire Emissary folded his hands before his companions and said, "I have received their reply. They have declared that they knew nothing about the temple-destroyer and that they would send people to investigate this matter."
<br><br>
"Pooh! Don't believe a word of it!" Metal Emissary sneered disdainfully before continuing, "Tell them that if they don't stop tearing down our temple, we'll go and invade their base!"
<br><br>
"Are you serious?" Fire Emissary said, rolling his eyes at him. "Do you think the people of the Oneness Sky Palace will believe that?"
<br><br>
The conflict at the Stage Four of the Other Shore was quite a common one.
<br><br>
Even if both sides were furious at their losses, they would restrain themselves in public and only seek retribution in secrecy. If the two great forces were to start a full-scale war, the whole world would be thrown into a state of chaos. Invading the Oneness Sky Palace would just be a joke.
<br><br>
"But what should we do now?" Water Emissary asked anxiously.
<br><br>
The temple at Stage Four was the first station for their warriors on the Other Shore. Even if they reached Stage Thirteen, they usually needed to return to the temple for one reason or the other. It would be a great loss to the Bearing race if their temple was completely destroyed.
<br><br>
More importantly, there was a considerable amount of soul crystal stored in the temple. The soul crystal was left behind for the descendants of the race.
<br><br>
But once their temple was destroyed, this important resource would fall into enemy hands.
<br><br>
Chapter 3241 Make A Concession While the Five-element Emissaries from Bearing race remained anxious, Zen had already entered the central hall of the temple through the entrance.
<br><br>
On one side of the central hall, there was a wall on which a big bear statue was engraved as decoration. The carvings and delicate details on the statue were exquisitely sophisticated.
<br><br>
After Zen looked around in all directions, he approached the wall and placed his hand on it.
<br><br>
He had intended to destroy it to have a look at what was on the other side.
<br><br>
Just as he began to break it down, a man showed up behind him and shouted, "You cannot destroy that wall!"
<br><br>
The man that suddenly appeared was an Indigo Soul. Zen immediately concluded him to be a member of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"You think you can stop me?" Zen turned his face towards him and sneered meaningfully.
<br><br>
"Yes, I do!"
<br><br>
After saying this, the man abruptly made a move and pounced on Zen.
<br><br>
Immediately, Zen spurned this mere Indigo Soul and disposed of him like a bothersome gnat. As Zen waved his hand, the man was effortlessly thrown back for a few feet before he crashed into a wall.
<br><br>
He went easy on him this time. If he had added more strength in his blow, the man's Soul of Light would have been shattered.
<br><br>
With no more hindrances in his way, Zen approached the wall a second time. Wasting no time, he pressed hard on the wall with his right hand and applied a little pressure. 'Now then, let's see what we could find.' "Crack!"
<br><br>
Not long after, the wall couldn't bear any more pressure, and it collapsed inwards.
<br><br>
He watched intently as the wall cracked up and revealed hidden compartments within it.
<br><br>
These secret compartments were in thirteen rows. And in each of them, there lay a piece of Other Shore Token! Among the many Other Shore Tokens that now lay bare to him, three distinct ones in the thirteenth row caught his attention. A golden sculpture carved in the shape of a bull, a rhombus-shaped green gem, and a pair of curved feet of a monster.
<br><br>
He ran his eyes across them as if to scan these tokens and counted them in his heart. There were more than a hundred Other Shore Tokens in total from Stage One to Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"You can't touch those Other Shore Tokens! They belong to our Bearing race!" Two more people appeared on the scene and shouted while pointing at the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Similar to the Oneness Sky Palace, the Bearing race also collected various Other Shore Tokens and kept them inside the wall for the members of their own race to use. However, they had never imagined someone like Zen would infiltrate their temple and attempt to steal them before they moved them away.
<br><br>
"Not anymore, they belong to me now," Zen chuckled in amusement, staring at their frustrated faces.
<br><br>
These Other Shore Tokens must hold a lot of value in the market. Zen might not need them for himself, but he could sell them for something else.
<br><br>
However, he did not have a Sumeru Space of his own, as he was now in the form of his physical body. Collecting these Other Shore Tokens and storing them would be a problem. Zen had called Dorothy to aid him in his invasion for this reason.
<br><br>
The two men felt anxiety growing inside them as Zen remained firm to his cause. It was apparent the most they could do was attack him without caring about what would happen to them. Suddenly, they rushed towards him to try and take him down.
<br><br>
Zen was starting to get a little impatient. These guys would prove to be a nuisance if they weren't dealt with once and for all.
<br><br>
"Puff! Puff!"
<br><br>
This time, Zen exerted a little more force than before and threw them heavy punches. Although they were not dead, their Souls of Light had taken massive irreversible damage.
<br><br>
In the darkness inside the temple, the many members of the Bearing race stood watching the scene helplessly. They hung their heads loosely from their necks in defeat.
<br><br>
They could guess Zen's ultimate reason for coming here was to avenge the attack on the Oneness Sky Palace. But they had never expected him to be so ruthless. If only they hadn't done what they had to the Oneness Sky Palace, they wouldn't have to swallow the bitter pill they received at present.
<br><br>
For the sake of her safety, Zen hadn't called Dorothy in.
<br><br>
After dealing with the members of the Bearing race, Zen proceeded to penetrate the wall with his two hands. Soon, the immense wall was lifted off the ground whole before Zen carried it onto his shoulders and walked out of the temple casually.
<br><br>
"That guy..."
<br><br>
"Shit! He can enter the Other Shore with his physical body. We can't compare to his strength."
<br><br>
"He's too terrifying. We can't compete with him!"
<br><br>
Noticing Dorothy from afar, Zen walked up to her smiling ear to ear with the wall still on his shoulders. Before he set it down, he glanced at her and said, "Put these away for me."
<br><br>
Dorothy smiled tenderly. Her Soul of Light fluttered around the wall. With quick hands, she conjured up a blue square on her slender fingers. Soon after, those Other Shore Tokens were all sucked into the square.
<br><br>
"Wow! Quite a find if I do say so myself!" Dorothy let out a scream in excitement.
<br><br>
Zen chuckled at her reaction and shook his head. "This is nothing. I will have a bigger surprise for you, just wait and see..."
<br><br>
Just then, a man rushed over in their direction, almost out of breath. "Wait! Slow down..."
<br><br>
Zen paused to glance at him and asked, "Why? What's wrong?"
<br><br>
The man got closer to Zen's ear and whispered in a low voice, "Master Athemar has requested you to stop destroying the temple of the Bearing race."
<br><br>
Zen sighed at his request and frowned to himself.
<br><br>
He had already torn down almost half of the temple, and he did not plan on stopping there. But now, Athemar had asked him to halt his attacks. It was probably because the Bearing race had asked the Oneness Sky Palace to do so, or maybe they had come to a compromise between both parties.
<br><br>
"Fine, I'll stop," Zen said with an exasperated sigh as he raised his hands in defeat.
<br><br>
The messenger was a little shocked at Zen agreeing with Athemar's wishes so quickly. He never expected Zen would listen without much persuasion.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, such a man who could enter the Other Shore with his physical body could not be easily controlled. He never expected Zen to be so obedient. 'What relationship does Master Athemar share with this guy?' "But, I will take what I deserve," Zen said as the corners of his mouth turned into a mischievous smile.
<br><br>
The over one hundred Other Shore Tokens he just gathered had no value in Zen's eyes. Instead, he would give them away without hesitation in exchange for soul pills and soul crystal in the future.
<br><br>
Immediately, his mind began to wonder if the temple of the Bearing race had a large amount of soul crystal, just like the Other Shore Tokens. He could stop destroying the temple as ordered, but he would take what he came to get.
<br><br>
It seemed the Indigo Soul was not the destination of the soul. Later, he would definitely need more soul crystal as he would surpass the Lust World to enter the Desire World.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the great hall of the Oneness Sky Palace in the Source World, a disciple sat upright in the center, while the masters waited for him to wake up and bring the news of Zen's response.
<br><br>
"I doubt that guy would listen to Athemar..."
<br><br>
"Now that his physical body has entered the Other Shore, he must be unstoppable. Alas, I hope he can show some mercy!"
<br><br>
"I didn't expect the Bearing race would make such a huge concession!"
<br><br>
Several masters hung their heads with a hint of worry on their faces.
<br><br>
Just then, another news came from the Bearing race, offering a compromise.
<br><br>
They had proposed to order the Sun Crow race to withdraw from the Mountain Viewing Province.
<br><br>
The dispute between the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace in the Mountain Viewing Province had lasted for many years. It was always a headache to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Back then, when the Sun Crow race had a conflict with the humans of the Oneness Sky Palace, the Bearing race played a huge part in adding fuel to the fire. If they could end their war with the Sun Crow race by stopping Zen from destroying the temple, it could be beneficial for both parties.
<br><br>
But they didn't think that mysterious guy would obey Athemar's instructions.
<br><br>
Among all the masters present, only Athemar, Madam Yasamin, Winchell, and Goran knew Zen was that guy. When Athemar asked someone to take a message to Zen, Yasamin glanced at him with meaningful eyes.
<br><br>
After a while, the disciple opened his eyes and awakened, he returned the hopeful gazes of the masters and said, "That guy has agreed to not destroy their temple, but he still wants to go inside."
<br><br>
"Why does he want to go to the temple?" the master of Ivory Mountain spoke up in curiosity.
<br><br>
"The Bearing race has accumulated countless treasures over the years. He wants to gather the things he wants from them." "I really have no idea where this greedy guy came from!" laughed the master of the Golden Mountain.
<br><br>
Chapter 3242 Plunder Zen was a lot calmer when he stepped into the temple of the Bearing race again. He no longer continued to destroy the temple.
<br><br>
He started looking around the temple. Thankfully, its structure was simple.
<br><br>
He walked through the rest half of the temple as the warriors of the Bearing race stood, watching. Their Souls of Light glowed a nervous sheen.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the faces of the Bearing race warriors dimmed with the sudden realization of what Zen was looking for.
<br><br>
Two things were of great value in the temple: the Other Shore Tokens and the soul crystal.
<br><br>
He already took the Other Shore Tokens, which meant he was aiming for the soul crystal.
<br><br>
Zen took a glance at the scene before him. There were several forks ahead and each fork had warriors guarding them, but the road right in front of him had the largest number of warriors.
<br><br>
His lips curled into a smile. The Bearing race basically gave away the route leading to the soul crystal.
<br><br>
As Zen approached, Souls of Light stood firmly and blocked his way. They had no intentions of making way for him.
<br><br>
"You can't go in," said one of the warriors. "This is an important part of our temple."
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "Try and stop me," he dared.
<br><br>
He had already destroyed half of the temple. The warriors here weren't in the position to reason with him.
<br><br>
Despite this, they stood their ground.
<br><br>
Zen stepped forward. He bumped them and caused everyone to stagger away.
<br><br>
Some of them tried to approach Zen to grab him, but as they neared him, Zen simply flicked his wrist and threw them out. Once all of them were out of his way, he continued on his path to the depths of the temple.
<br><br>
"Alas!"
<br><br>
"This is our fault. We shouldn't have set up a trap for the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. We are taking the consequences of our own deeds."
<br><br>
"I haven't received my soul crystal yet. It seems that I won't have any chance to get it."
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
The Bearing race collectively sighed. A heavy air rose as depression dawned on them.
<br><br>
It was extremely difficult for ordinary warriors to improve their souls on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The only luck they could count on was if they were able to acquire some soul crystal from the temples and wilderness.
<br><br>
However, warriors and disciples from the super forces often had the resources to improve themselves rapidly. Zen and Dorothy were two of these warriors. They were able to have Indigo Souls almost effortlessly.
<br><br>
If anyone plundered the soul crystal in the temple, then the warriors of the Bearing race here would have little to no hope to further their improvement.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, they remained inferior to Zen's powers, so they were unable to stop him.
<br><br>
In the innermost room of the temple, a thick wall covered with small holes stood. Several warriors of the Bearing race busily gathered in front of it before Zen arrived. They were ordered to use their Sumeru Spaces to absorb as much soul crystal as they could.
<br><br>
They diligently did as they were ordered.
<br><br>
However, the design of the temple prohibited them from maximizing their collection. They were not fast enough. Although they worked nonstop, they only managed to absorb a small part of the soul crystal.
<br><br>
"Everyone get out!"
<br><br>
Zen shouted coldly.
<br><br>
The several warriors were horrified. They were afraid of being killed by Zen, so they immediately ran for their lives.
<br><br>
Zen's method of taking the soul crystal was simple and crude. He pressed his hand on the wall and gently patted it. The wall burst open and revealed a huge stone covered by tiny holes, like a beehive. Each hole emitted a bright light.
<br><br>
He simply lifted the huge stone and walked out like it was no big deal.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race were mortified. They were losing the little hope they had.
<br><br>
As he walked out of the temple, Zen tossed the stone towards Dorothy.
<br><br>
Dorothy gasped at the sight of the stone. "You have taken all the soul crystal of the Bearing race!"
<br><br>
The stone was called Myriad Holes Stone. It stored the soul crystal perfectly. The Bearing race sealed the stone in the thick wall when they built the temple. Some disciples of the race would also store the soul crystal they found on the Other Shore in it. The Oneness Sky Palace also used such stone to store their soul crystal.
<br><br>
"Absorb the soul crystal into your Sumeru Space quickly before something happens," Zen said with a soft chuckle.
<br><br>
Dorothy nodded and put her hand on the stone. The soul crystal in the small holes gathered inside the square space in her hand.
<br><br>
Zen stared at Dorothy's square space and thought to himself, 'I should get another Sumeru Space.' Unlike his soul, his corporeal body couldn't hold things so he always had to ask Dorothy to keep items for him. She would then transfer the items to his Soul of Light. It was very inconvenient. He wondered if the Oneness Sky Palace would be able to provide his corporeal body with a Sumeru Space.
<br><br>
As soon as all the soul crystal was kept by Dorothy, Zen tossed the stone onto a pile of ruins that used to be a part of the temple. Together, they left the place.
<br><br>
When they arrived at the gate of the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace, Zen's body quietly retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
This time, he was able to get a lot of soul crystal. Though the Bearing race had transferred a part of it before his arrival. What he acquired was enough for eight warriors to achieve Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
Eventually, Zen's Soul of Light returned to the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace. As soon as it did, he grabbed Dorothy into the secret room. Dorothy quickly transferred all the soul crystal to him.
<br><br>
"Shouldn't we share it equally?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"No, I don't need it," Dorothy replied.
<br><br>
It was Zen who obtained the soul crystal, anyway. She merely helped in safekeeping it. She didn't think she deserved any of it.
<br><br>
Since Dorothy was so determined not to take any, Zen didn't insist. He just decided to generously share it with her in the future should she need it.
<br><br>
Zen had been itching to go to higher stages of the Other Shore since he had the Indigo Soul. But considering what happened that day, his plan would be delayed.
<br><br>
"I wanted to go to Stage Thirteen with you, but it looks like I wouldn't be able to do that," Zen said.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Dorothy blushed and giggled. "Let's go back first. I'm sure the Oneness Sky Palace and Bearing race are in chaotic states now!"
<br><br>
Zen then retreated from the Other Shore. With the space twisting a bit, he was sitting in his room again.
<br><br>
When he removed the enchanted barrier and opened the door, he saw three guests in the courtyard.
<br><br>
Goran, Winchell, and Athemar stood in the middle of the courtyard while Trish and Carrie served them tea. It looked like they were there to visit Zen.
<br><br>
Trish and Carrie looked worried.
<br><br>
Letitia stood on the second floor just as worried as Trish and Carrie. They wondered what Zen had done wrong.
<br><br>
Although she couldn't see through the real strength of these men, for some reason unknown to her, the aura the men exuded made her tremble.
<br><br>
Letitia couldn't figure out why such figures came to visit Zen and were willing to wait quietly in the courtyard. She wanted to call Zen out, but before she could, the three men stopped her as if they were afraid of disturbing him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3243 Failing To Get The Sumeru Space The moment Zen pushed the door open, Letitia hurriedly told him, "Zen, these guests have already been waiting here for a long time."
<br><br>
Zen noticed that Letitia was a little nervous, so he comforted her first. After that, he escorted her down from the second floor.
<br><br>
"Welcome, masters!"
<br><br>
As Zen reached downstairs, he promptly bowed to the three people before him.
<br><br>
Athemar asked, "Who is she?"
<br><br>
"This is my principal wife. Tia, greet these masters," Zen responded honestly.
<br><br>
As Zen finished his words, Letitia bowed to them then respectfully retreated to the side.
<br><br>
The three of them regarded Zen with meaningful expressions.
<br><br>
They thought back on what happened in the Vastness Mountain not long ago. They were surprised that Zen had been married. They also wondered if he already had a child and if Yasamin and Flamine knew about this.
<br><br>
But of course, it was none of their business. They came here to discuss what happened on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
To keep the absolute confidentiality of this topic, Athemar set up an invisible enchanted barrier with a wave of his hand.
<br><br>
In this way, he could prevent Letitia, Trish, and Carrie from hearing their conversation.
<br><br>
Letitia perfectly knew that they came here to discuss something important with Zen. Since she was not interested in intruding in their affairs, she quietly stood aside.
<br><br>
"You were truly amazing today! You destroyed half a temple of the Bearing race. You probably have lots of harvests, right?" Athemar said as he laughed, as if he actually saw Zen rob the temple.
<br><br>
Zen cupped his hands and said, "I took all their Other Shore Tokens and soul crystal inside. I could just hand them over if the Oneness Sky Palace wouldn't be able to endure their anger."
<br><br>
Because he destroyed the temple of the Bearing race, the Oneness Sky Palace must be under a lot of pressure. Zen didn't want to cause any more troubles for the palace.
<br><br>
"You are quite gracious," Winchell said as he looked at Zen with admiration. If it was him in this position, he probably wouldn't be willing to hand them over.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Goran snorted. He said, "For many years, the Oneness Sky Palace was bullied by the Bearing race. This time, you subdued them with your own power. What can they do to us next? You got them with your efforts so naturally, they now belong to you!"
<br><br>
"But I'm worried that the Bearing race would seek revenge against the palace..." Zen seemed hesitant.
<br><br>
"For the past years, people have fought repeatedly for profit in the Source World," Athemar said after he took a sip of his tea. "A fierce war will break out sooner or later. Even if we don't provoke them, they will probably take revenge on us when that time comes. However, they might not dare take actions now."
<br><br>
The three masters were very open-minded about these issues. They chose their own paths and followed their own fates. It was clear to them that a mere compromise could not stop the Bearing race from fighting against the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"In conclusion, you must hide your identity well on the Other Shore. Don't expose yourself to anyone, even to those who are from our palace!" Goran advised.
<br><br>
After the accident that occurred on the Other Shore, the Oneness Sky Palace counted the number of trapped elite disciples.
<br><br>
With the exception of the Vastness Mountain, all of the other six mountains had trapped elites. These included the Oneness Mountain and the Origin Mountain. Strangely enough, disciples from the Vastness Mountain were not involved. Because of this, Goran thought that not everyone from the Oneness Sky Palace could be trusted.
<br><br>
Zen completely understood what they meant by this. He nodded and asked, "How is Milo now?"
<br><br>
It was clear to Zen that he wouldn't have been able to escape from the combined attack from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race by himself.
<br><br>
Milo finally displayed an astonishing skill which allowed Zen to escape.
<br><br>
Without his help, the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace, including himself, would have been annihilated.
<br><br>
With a dark look on his face, Athemar responded, "He hasn't regained consciousness yet."
<br><br>
"Is his soul severely injured?" Zen sighed and asked.
<br><br>
During that time, Milo was completely engulfed by the Champion Fish.
<br><br>
How was he able to bear their ceaseless biting? "It's not because of the soul damage," Athemar shook his head as he explained.
<br><br>
"Then, what?" Zen asked with uncertainty.
<br><br>
"You must have seen the sword strike Milo made," Athemar replied.
<br><br>
"I did," Zen nodded.
<br><br>
For Zen, Milo's final strike was absolutely incredible. It directly froze all the Champion Fish and even a part of the wall.
<br><br>
Zen was thoroughly puzzled. Milo's Soul of Light had not yet reached the level of Indigo Soul. However, his strike was much stronger than those of ordinary Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
"He had utterly overdrawn his talent. Therefore, he was severely punished.
<br><br>
We are trying our best to revive him but it takes time," said Athemar.
<br><br>
Yet, Athemar didn't mention to Zen what talent Milo had overdrawn to launch that strike.
<br><br>
The reason why they visited Zen was to ease his worry and confirm the truth as well.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace would never admit that it was Zen who destroyed the temple. However, the outside world still believed that Zen had a close connection with the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
However, other forces wouldn't be able to blame the Oneness Sky Palace for whatever Zen did on the Other Shore. Moreover, this could also scare other super forces and warned them that whoever dared provoke Oneness Sky Palace on the Other Shore would bring tragedy to themselves.
<br><br>
Over the next couple days, the Bearing race negotiated with the Oneness Sky Palace. They demanded that the man who destroyed their temple return their soul crystal and Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace only admitted that they indeed stopped that man from demolishing the entire temple. However, it was beyond their ability to ask him to return the soul crystal and Other Shore Tokens he took from the temple for they had no idea who that man was.
<br><br>
This kind of statement was almost hard to disprove. The Bearing race needed to swallow this bitter loss.
<br><br>
Despite their anger, they kept their word. They asked the Sun Crow race to retreat from the Mountain Viewing Province. With this, the war between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race ceased temporarily.
<br><br>
On Stage Four of the Other Shore, many Souls of Light moved back and forth through the temple of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
The ruins needed to be cleaned up while the collapsed beams needed to be rebuilt. For the Souls of Light in the Lust World, this was a very laborious project.
<br><br>
As he returned to the Other Shore with his body again, Zen headed to the temple of the Oneness Sky Palace. He wanted to get a space ring from that Thunder Beast.
<br><br>
For many years, that Thunder Beast stayed in the Oneness Sky Palace's temple. It was a bit apprehensive of Zen as it might be its first time to see a human body.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, the Thunder Beast lowered its head and stretched out its tentacles when Zen extended his hand toward it. It proceeded to make a carving around Zen's fingers.
<br><br>
Gradually, a shining square formed at Zen's fingertips. Just as it was about to be completely formed, it suddenly broke like a glazed tile with a sound of "bang".
<br><br>
"Woo?"
<br><br>
For a moment, the Thunder Beast appeared stunned. It never expected this to happen.
<br><br>
Zen was also shocked as he stared at his fingertips. He had never thought that the Thunder Beast could fail.
<br><br>
"Please do it again," Zen implored.
<br><br>
The Thunder Beast complied. It repeated the process for the second time but as soon as the space ring was almost formed, it broke again.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
The Thunder Beast shook its head and now refused to make a space ring for Zen the third time.
<br><br>
Zen's face was filled with disappointment. He turned his head and spoke to Dorothy, "It seems like the physical body is unable to get a space ring here."
<br><br>
Dorothy seemed relieved as she smiled and said, "Your body is invincible on the Other Shore. If you have a Sumeru Space, I'm afraid all of the good things here would be collected by you alone."
<br><br>
In reality, Dorothy was happy about this.
<br><br>
She was the only one who knew Zen's secret on the Other Shore. Zen needed her help in order to transfer those things he got on the Other Shore to his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
So if Zen had gotten the space ring successfully, he would not need her help anymore. Hence, she would be useless to him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3244 Ancestral Glory Stage Zen naturally failed to decipher what was going on in Dorothy's mind.
<br><br>
After he switched his form from his physical body to his Soul of Light to enter the Other Shore, he left the temple with Dorothy and headed for that square not far away.
<br><br>
On that square, there was a star ring. It continued to emit coldness that was chilling to the bone.
<br><br>
Around the star ring, many people sat with their legs crossed. They wanted to attempt at increasing their resistance against the cold.
<br><br>
There were many ways to improve cultivation. The privileged super forces had reserves of soul crystal, and they would absorb it to increase their cultivation of Soul of Light faster compared to others.
<br><br>
But the common folk in the Source World had no qualifications to enter the temples, let alone to get any soul crystal.
<br><br>
So they had to make use of other ways to improve cultivation that were less effective, such as enduring the brutal cold exuded by the star ring.
<br><br>
Since Dorothy and Zen both had Indigo Souls, they inevitably attracted a lot of attention as they approached the scene.
<br><br>
The Indigo Soul was invincible in Stage Four since it could reach Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore directly. As a result, Zen and Dorothy were much more compelling than the others present there.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
Dorothy gestured Zen to follow after her, and then she stepped into the star ring without any hesitation.
<br><br>
As the star ring began to spin around her, her Soul of Light stretched up vertically and turned into a ray of light. With a swift movement, it shot up towards the sky, like a rising comet.
<br><br>
After Dorothy ascended, it was Zen's turn. He entered the star ring to follow after her.
<br><br>
Recalling back to when he first entered Stage Four, he remembered how hard it was for him to bear the pressure exerted by the same star ring.
<br><br>
However, that was a while ago, and his Soul of Light had made substantial progress since then. The coldness contained in the star ring could not harm him anymore.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Within a split second, Zen had also successfully left Stage Four.
<br><br>
Just as they left Stage Four, a Soul of Light slowly condensed and formed in the square where they once stood.
<br><br>
It was the first time this soul had reached Stage Four. Naturally, he was curious about exploring his surroundings.
<br><br>
He glanced around to see if he could find anything worth his interest, and then he walked over to the side of the star ring. Upon noticing a warrior, he approached him and asked curiously, "Hey man, what are you guys doing here?"
<br><br>
The cultivator looked annoyed by his question. He glanced at him and answered impatiently, "Are you blind!? We are cultivating here!"
<br><br>
"What? Really?"
<br><br>
The man turned around and scanned the star ring with a baffled expression.
<br><br>
The principles of this cultivation method were not hard to understand.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he began to chuckle in amusement and said, "This cultivation method is equivalent to ants crawling on the ground, it's too slow! I heard that the super forces had built temples in Stage Four. Why don't you guys go there?"
<br><br>
Hearing his suggestion, the cultivator fell into a crippling depression. He wasn't a disciple of a noble race, which was why he didn't have the qualification to enter any of the temples. Did this man only come here to make him feel inferior and provoke him? "It's none of your business. Leave me alone!" The cultivator frantically waved his hands to drive the irritable man away.
<br><br>
"It's none of my business? How disrespectful! No one dared to talk to me like that in Stage Three!"
<br><br>
Offended by the cultivator's attitude, the man reached for his arm and gently scratched at it. As a result of this action, the cultivator's arm immediately left his torso. The man grabbed it and swallowed it down.
<br><br>
This man could directly devour other people's Souls of Light! What was even more shocking was that the warrior remained seated in cultivation as if he didn't sense his arm being pulled off. However, when he glanced in the direction of the man to see what he was eating, he saw it was his arm! "You, you... You can directly swallow other people's Souls of Light!" As feelings of terror filled the cultivator, he struggled with the right words to say.
<br><br>
"What's so strange about this? The creatures in Stage Two and Stage Three were too weak, so I came to Stage Four. This damned place. I don't like to swallow the Souls of Light of my race, but I have no choice. It seems that there are only humans in this stage?" The man replied, seeming unapologetic for his actions.
<br><br>
Of Course, Stage Four wasn't filled with humans only. But since they belonged to the same race, they would usually fly upwards in the same direction and land at the same location.
<br><br>
"What the hell is wrong with you? You're crazy!" The cultivator shrieked in horror. Then he turned into a blur and immediately retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"That man can actually devour Souls of Light?"
<br><br>
"Isn't he afraid of the consequences?"
<br><br>
"This guy is crazy!"
<br><br>
Other cultivators in the square began to scream in shock after witnessing that horrific scene.
<br><br>
Each soul had its own will and could not devour each other. If one devoured too many other souls, it would be overwhelmed by them and would lose control of its will.
<br><br>
Absorbing soul crystal was also like swallowing other souls. However, the soul crystal was not accumulated in a short time, and it was quite pure and free of such risks.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, all the Souls of Light in the square emptied their spots. They left out of fear of being devoured by this man.
<br><br>
The man looked at the empty square in disappointment and sighed, "I've said that I don't really like to devour the soul of my race. I just wanted to know how it tasted here. It seems that Stage Four is also nothing special."
<br><br>
He didn't bother to stop the cultivators from deserting the area. In his eyes, they were similar to insignificant ants.
<br><br>
There was an abundance of Souls of Light in the Other Shore. Everyone in the Source World would have their Soul of Light step onto the Other Shore once reaching the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
In addition to humans, it also harbored myriads of nonhuman creatures.
<br><br>
It only took the man a few days to move from Stage One to Stage Four by swallowing the Souls of Light of other beings.
<br><br>
While he stood still, he narrowed his eyes to look further in the distance.
<br><br>
Soon, his gaze fell on a temple where disciples of the Bearing race were busy with their work. A curious look appeared on his face.
<br><br>
'I've heard that the temples keep the purest soul crystal within them. I wonder if they would give me some if I asked.' He always did what came to his mind, nothing was stopping him this time either. With quick steps, he made his way towards the temple.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen felt his soul take shape again. When he opened his eyes, he found he had reached Stage Five, the Primary Light Stage.
<br><br>
This stage was different from Stage Four. It was fully painted in white with the ground covered in layers of salt.
<br><br>
"Is it always so quiet in Stage Five?" Zen asked while looking around curiously.
<br><br>
Dorothy nodded her head and explained to him, "Most races regard Stage Four as a starting point. So Stage Five is naturally neglected. No one would stay here, unless they want to explore some unique temples."
<br><br>
The Other Shore Tokens of Stage Five were not much different from those in Stage Four. Moreover, those from major forces managed to obtain Other Shore Tokens from higher stages in their temples, so there was no point in exploring Stage Five.
<br><br>
The same could be said about Stages Six and Seven.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy didn't stay there for long. They entered another star ring and continued to ascend to the next stage.
<br><br>
Stage Six, the Seven-brilliance Stage, was a little dangerous and had a complex landscape. It was covered with giant rocks painted in a bright red color.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Stage Seven, the Nothingness Stage, was occupied by pink fern. It proved refreshing in contrast to the previous stages.
<br><br>
Stage Eight, the Great Ultimate Stage, seemed more like a world of only ice and snow.
<br><br>
Stage Nine, the Red Sun Stage, like its name, was similar to that of a blazing sun with high temperatures.
<br><br>
Stage Ten was called the Mysterious Light Stage...
<br><br>
The pair kept stepping into star rings of the stages and flying upward.
<br><br>
As they ascended, they felt the pressure of the star rings increase gradually.
<br><br>
For an ordinary person with an average Soul of Light, it would take a few years or even longer in the ascension.
<br><br>
However, they were Indigo Souls. They could resist the pressure with ease.
<br><br>
They kept progressing without a hitch.
<br><br>
Finally, they reached Stage Eleven, the Ancestral Glory Stage! Dozens of giant Souls of Light appeared not far from them once they showed up in Stage Eleven. These blurry Souls of Light looked terrifying, judging from the aura they emitted.
<br><br>
Behind Zen, there were countless star rings. No one could tell exactly how many they were.
<br><br>
"Humans, come this way!"
<br><br>
A tall and seemingly powerful Soul of Light walked up to Zen and Dorothy and pointed to the right while giving the order.
<br><br>
Chapter 3245 Rip Off Zen's eyes filled with confusion, his gaze switching from the star rings to the non-human creatures stationed there.
<br><br>
The origin of the star ring was unknown to him. All he knew was that it served as a key item for a warrior's ascension to the upper stages.
<br><br>
According to what he had observed, one star ring was shared among all creatures of a particular race.
<br><br>
For instance, despite the existence of a large number of star rings in Stage One, the human race could only rely on one to ascend to the next stage.
<br><br>
This was the case for all the following stages. All the humans used the same rings to ascend.
<br><br>
All races had their own star rings, and the star ring that belonged to the human race would normally be surrounded by humans while those that belonged to the non-human races would likewise be surrounded by nonhuman creatures.
<br><br>
However, the scene in front of him right now was entirely different from what he initially thought.
<br><br>
For one, there were countless star rings piled high before him, and two, he was being ordered around by these non-human creatures as if they owned the place! Dorothy pulled his sleeve and whispered to him. "Just do as they say."
<br><br>
She knew significantly more about the Other Shore so Zen chose to follow her advice, albeit with a noticeable frown on his face.
<br><br>
He returned his gaze onto the star rings. They had been arranged in an orderly fashion. Meanwhile, hundreds of Souls of Light gathered nearby and were lining up in two, neat queues.
<br><br>
"The road on your left will lead you towards the upper stage while the one on your right will lead you to the temples. Choose one and line up!" a tall, non-human creature announced in a loud voice.
<br><br>
A collection of various creatures immediately followed: small Ear Mice, giant beasts, and others, all lined up to form orderly queues.
<br><br>
"What's going on?" Zen asked Dorothy in a low voice after they joined a long line. This Stage Eleven feels different from the previous stages."
<br><br>
"It's because the Ancestral Glory Stage is controlled by the Separate Abyss race," she explained.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race was considered one of the strongest powerhouses in the Source World. Superior in terms of both soul and strength levels, they proved to be a force that the human race found difficulty in contending with.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened in shock upon hearing this piece of information. "A race can control an entire stage?"
<br><br>
"This is a special case. The Separate Abyss race is closely related to a race on the Other Shore so they got a bit of help from them in taking over this stage. Any super force that comes here would have to follow their rules,"
<br><br>
Dorothy told him.
<br><br>
"What are the rules?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Well, anyone who wants to pass through this Ancestral Glory Stage and reach Stage Twelve has to pay ten thousand soul pills. And we need to line up for our turn," she explained.
<br><br>
Zen turned to her with an intrigued look. "We have to pay? What if I leave Stage Twelve and go down through here? Would I still have to pay?"
<br><br>
Dorothy nodded. "Yeah."
<br><br>
She definitely knew some stuff about Stage Eleven but this was actually her first time coming here.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, paying ten thousand soul pills was only to gain entry into the stage. If one wanted to explore, then they would need to pay an additional amount.
<br><br>
Most Souls of Light would travel up and down in the Lust World and the Separate Abyss race would charge everyone who passed this stage ten thousand soul pills as the toll.
<br><br>
"Isn't this robbery? What about the other large races in the Source World? Are they fine with this?" Zen asked with evident concern.
<br><br>
Ten thousand soul pills were nothing to an Indigo Soul, but that cost could pile up since it had to be paid every time they passed through here.
<br><br>
A non-human stranger snorted upon hearing his question. "The Separate Abyss race is really powerful and there's no way any other super force would be able to go against them. Besides, the cost is fairly reasonable so everyone just chooses to pay rather than causes conflict."
<br><br>
The stranger had a similar appearance to that of humans except for the fact that he was much shorter and had several sharp thorns on his head. Zen had no idea which race he came from but it seemed that he spoke the human language fluently.
<br><br>
Dorothy nodded in agreement with the stranger's words. "That's basically it."
<br><br>
"No wonder Emily told me that humans weren't powerful here in the Source World..."
<br><br>
Zen muttered to himself, feeling a bit bothered by this new information he had just learned.
<br><br>
To him, the Oneness Sky Palace, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race were super powerful.
<br><br>
However, not even these three super forces combined could dream of monopolizing an entire stage. Zen couldn't help but begin to fathom just how powerful the Separate Abyss race was to have been able to do such a feat.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy waited for nearly an hour. Their turn was just about to come up when they heard a bit of a commotion up ahead. It seemed someone was begging for entrance.
<br><br>
"I only have eight thousand soul pills, sir. Could you please make an exception and let me pass?" The voice belonged to a human woman, very young judging from her childish tone.
<br><br>
"A human, eh? Don't you know the rules around here? Ten thousand pills isn't that much. If you don't have enough then you can go ahead and work over there," a Separate Abyss member guarding the place answered in spite, pointing towards the west.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race had fully occupied Stage Eleven. They had already staked their claim, erected their temples, and were actually in the process of building a grand home for them to stay in.
<br><br>
Construction on the Other Shore was laborious. Zen remembered the Bearing race's temple he destroyed and figured that repairing it was going to be extremely difficult and would definitely take a long time.
<br><br>
Since the Separate Abyss race wanted to build, then they would definitely need a lot of labourers.
<br><br>
The girl's lips trembled in fear when she saw the direction the guard had pointed to. Everyone knew that working under the Separate Abyss race entailed certain dangers, one of them death. There was no way she would willingly go there if she valued her life.
<br><br>
"I...I give up. I won't go up... I'll just go back to Stage Ten!" she exclaimed, tears brimming her eyes from disappointment.
<br><br>
"Of course you can go back to Stage Ten! But you'll still have to pay ten thousand soul pills if you want to leave!" The guard laughed cruelly, relishing in the devastated look that flashed upon the human girl's face.
<br><br>
"It's ten thousand to go up, and another ten thousand to go down. That's the rule here."
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
Several more Separate Abyss members joined in, laughing at the human girl and her suffering.
<br><br>
Faced with such a hopeless situation, the human girl could only turn to others for help. She immediately began asking those lined up if they had two thousand soul pills to spare. She'd pay them back when she reached Stage Twelve. She promised! Unfortunately, the ones around her were all non-human creatures. Why in the world would they help her? In the end, she was left all alone.
<br><br>
"Then... Can I leave first and pay the debt later when I earn enough soul pills?" she asked in a soft, timid tone.
<br><br>
"Either pay ten thousand soul pills or go over there to work for it, girl!" the guard snapped.
<br><br>
With no more options left, the human girl stood there for a while before eventually walking towards the west.
<br><br>
It was at this time that Zen decided to step out of his spot in line. He went towards her and nodded to the Separate Abyss guard up front. "It's only two thousand soul pills. I'll pay for her."
<br><br>
His words shocked the human girl. She couldn't believe some stranger would be kind enough to help her out of this hopeless situation. It was a miracle! "Thank you! When I reach Stage Twelve, I promise I'll pay you back!"
<br><br>
Zen, however, shook his head. "No need."
<br><br>
He took out two thousand soul pills from his space ring and was about to give them to the guard. However, the guard merely laughed at Zen. "Boy, if you really want to help her then it'll cost you more than two thousand!"
<br><br>
Zen frowned. "How much would it cost?"
<br><br>
"One hundred thousand soul pills!" the guard declared.
<br><br>
Zen's face immediately darkened. These Separate Abyss members were truly determined to rip him off.
<br><br>
True, he had managed to acquire a lot of soul crystal from the Bearing race which made him very rich. A finger-size chunk of soul crystal could be sold for a massive amount of soul pills and a mere one hundred thousand wasn't going to cause a dent in his fortune.
<br><br>
What he didn't like though, was how thick-skinned the Separate Abyss race were in their dealings.
<br><br>
"Isn't it that everyone only has to pay ten thousand soul pills?" Zen asked in a clipped tone.
<br><br>
"Haha!" the guard laughed, clearly mocking Zen. "This is our place and you have to give whatever amount we ask! You want to stand up for your fellow human, then I say that both of you now have to pay one hundred thousand soul pills!"
<br><br>
The bystanders waiting in line could only shake their heads. This was the exact reason why nobody was willing to help the human girl earlier.
<br><br>
Dealing with the domineering Separate Abyss race was incredibly complicated and could end up biting them in the ass if they ever so much as offended them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3246 Too Greedy The exorbitant price required by the Separate Abyss race depressed the human girl as she could not afford it.
<br><br>
She was afraid that she couldn't leave this stage today.
<br><br>
Most people minded their business and would not meddle in others' affairs.
<br><br>
She was, thus, grateful that Zen was willing to help her. Nevertheless, two hundred thousand soul pills were simply too much.
<br><br>
"Fine," the girl gritted her teeth as she muttered, "I'll work for you."
<br><br>
Although she knew it was dangerous, she had no other choice.
<br><br>
At this time, Zen said, "I will pay two hundred thousand soul pills!"
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race always charged at will. What was worse, they increased the price randomly. Before the guards could change their minds, Zen nodded at Dorothy.
<br><br>
Dorothy had been watching silently. When Zen nodded at her, she took one hundred thousand soul pills out of her space ring and offered it to the guards of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
The human girl's eyes opened wide. Even though they didn't know each other, Zen paid such a significant sum to get her out of trouble. She was surprised and extremely grateful.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race, on the other hand, had been cunning as always.
<br><br>
When Zen had stepped in to help the girl, they had increased the price tenfold and asked for two hundred thousand soul pills. Nevertheless, Zen still paid that amount.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss guards hadn't expected Zen to take out two hundred thousand soul pills. If they were to make things difficult for them now, it would ruin their race's reputation. Therefore, the leader of them waved his hand and said, "You can go!"
<br><br>
The human girl walked up to Zen and said, "I'll wait for you in Stage Twelve. Thank you for your help. I will find a way to repay you!"
<br><br>
Two hundred thousand soul pills were not a significant amount for any Souls of Light who could enter Stage Twelve or Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
But it was an exorbitant amount for the girl as her clan had declined. As she wasn't sure whether she could acquire two hundred thousand soul pills, she was hesitant to make the promise.
<br><br>
"Never mind all that. You can fly upward now," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
As she was a stranger who he had met by chance on the Other Shore, Zen didn't think he would see her again in Stage Twelve. Even though he knew that she couldn't return the soul pills, Zen had still helped her.
<br><br>
The human girl nodded and walked toward the star ring.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy waited in line for a while before it was finally their turn.
<br><br>
According to the previous agreement, Zen paid one hundred thousand soul pills.
<br><br>
But the guard of the Separate Abyss race pointed his huge finger at Dorothy and said, "You, one million soul pills."
<br><br>
Dorothy's eyebrows shot up, and she asked, "Why?"
<br><br>
"You paid two hundred thousand soul pills for him just now. It is fair to ask you to pay a higher price," the guard said with a sneer. "If you can't afford it, go that way!"
<br><br>
He sneered as he pointed to the west.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Enraged, Zen's Soul of Light exuded powerful soul aura.
<br><br>
Even the alien races who were waiting in line felt that the Separate Abyss race was too greedy.
<br><br>
"They are greedy bullies!"
<br><br>
"That's what happens when you help others!"
<br><br>
"If you want to pass Stage Eleven, you have to obey them."
<br><br>
The other races whispered amongst themselves. They could tell that these two humans were in trouble.
<br><br>
"What? Do you have a problem with that?"
<br><br>
The guards of the Separate Abyss race glared at Zen. They didn't take him seriously.
<br><br>
Never before in the history of the Separate Abyss race had anyone dared to start a fight in Stage Eleven! Dorothy could feel Zen's anger, but she didn't want to cause more trouble.
<br><br>
She quickly interjected, "I don't have a million soul pills. Can I pay with soul crystal?"
<br><br>
The eyes of the guards of the Separate Abyss race lit up as soul crystal was more valuable than soul pill.
<br><br>
In fact, every race valued soul crystal. After all, even if you had soul pills and divine crystals, you would still be unable to exchange them for soul crystal, considering its rareness.
<br><br>
"It depends on how much soul crystal you are willing to pay. Ha-ha..." The guards of the Separate Abyss race laughed. As they decided who proceeded to the next stage, they used their authority to extort greater amounts.
<br><br>
"A finger-size chunk," Dorothy offered.
<br><br>
"Deal," the guards of the Separate Abyss race agreed without hesitation.
<br><br>
Everyone knew that soul pills could be slowly accumulated, but soul crystal was rarely seen. As they could find no way to buy some, one finger-size chunk of soul crystal was more precious than a million soul pills.
<br><br>
Dorothy took out a finger-size chunk of soul crystal from her space ring and handed it to the guard of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
The other races' eyes shone with greed at the sight of the soul crystal. This was the rarely seen soul crystal. And she had actually paid the fee for passing Stage Eleven with it! What a reckless waste! Suddenly, everyone present was curious about her background.
<br><br>
Although they sighed with envy at the sight of the soul crystal, they cursed the Separate Abyss race. Judging from the situation, they believed that the Separate Abyss race was becoming greedier and greedier! "Let's go." Dorothy walked to Zen and tugged at his arm. She wanted to avoid trouble, but Zen was rooted to his spot. He wasn't going to allow some guards to extort such an unfair price from them.
<br><br>
Seeing that Zen wasn't leaving, the guards of the Separate Abyss race grinned, "Human boy, if you don't want to leave, you can stay here forever."
<br><br>
"Settle your anger, please. Let's go!" Dorothy pleaded with Zen.
<br><br>
Since staying here would only cause more trouble, Dorothy was naturally a little anxious.
<br><br>
Finally, Zen turned and followed Dorothy toward the star ring. As soon as their Souls of Light entered the star ring, they turned into two rays of light and flew to Stage Twelve.
<br><br>
The human girl had been watching the star ring all this while. She had been waiting for Zen in Stage Twelve, just as she had promised him.
<br><br>
She wanted to repay Zen as she owed him a big favor. But, first, she needed to know more about him, including his name.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
As the two rays of light descended, Zen's and Dorothy's Souls of Light reached Stage Twelve.
<br><br>
"Sir, thank you..."
<br><br>
As soon as the human girl recognized Zen's aura, she rushed toward him.
<br><br>
However, before she could say more, Zen turned his head and said to Dorothy, "Wait for me here." Before anyone could object, Zen had left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Dorothy's plea to stay safe and be careful echoed in the space as Zen's figure had already disappeared.
<br><br>
She shook her head slightly. Had the Separate Abyss race accepted two hundred thousand soul pills only, this would never have happened. But they had been unreasonable when they demanded a million soul pills. If she didn't have the soul crystal, she would have been left in Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
When the human girl saw Zen disappear, she was at a loss for what to do.
<br><br>
She stood silently for a while before she asked Dorothy, "Miss, where has he gone?"
<br><br>
Dorothy replied, "He'll be back soon."
<br><br>
She knew that it wouldn't take Zen long to turn Stage Eleven upside down.
<br><br>
"Oh." The human girl shuffled her feet. "Then, I'll wait for him here."
<br><br>
"Why are you waiting for him?" Dorothy asked as curiosity coursed through her.
<br><br>
"I want to know his name. I will return the soul pills to him," the girl explained.
<br><br>
Dorothy smiled at the girl. "You don't need to do that."
<br><br>
For her and Zen, two hundred thousand soul pills were not a significant amount. She did pay a higher price of a finger-size chunk of soul crystal as demanded by the Separate Abyss race, but that had nothing to do with this young human girl.
<br><br>
As Dorothy was generous and open-minded, she didn't blame the little girl.
<br><br>
"No! I must return them to him!" The girl was surprisingly persistent.
<br><br>
Since Dorothy's patience had waned, she said slowly, "I gave the soul pills on his behalf. Now, I'm telling you that I don't need you to pay me back.
<br><br>
You can leave!"
<br><br>
Dorothy's words upset the human girl, and she walked away reluctantly.
<br><br>
Chapter 3247 A Hundredfold As soon as Zen arrived—in his corporeal form—at the Oneness Sky Palace's temple, he saw a group of disciples stationed at the entrance of the temple. They all had grim expressions on their faces.
<br><br>
Zen quickly deduced that they were guarding against a strong enemy.
<br><br>
"What's the matter?"
<br><br>
he demanded, going straight up to one of the disciples.
<br><br>
Although they didn't know who he was, they knew he had helped them before.
<br><br>
"Before you came, something serious happened!" said the disciple, sounding frantic.
<br><br>
"Tell me quickly. Did the Bearing race come to make trouble again?" Zen asked, looking around him for signs of danger.
<br><br>
The great loss suffered by the Bearing race should have taught them not to go against the Oneness Sky Palace. Could they have dared to make trouble again so soon after their recent failure? Or was this the work of another race? The disciple shook his head. "There was a man, but he didn't belong to the Bearing race... We don't know where he came from. He can devour the souls of others!"
<br><br>
"A man who devours souls?" Zen repeated, startled.
<br><br>
"Yes!" The disciple sounded extremely upset. "He wanted soul crystal, and when we refused—he swallowed one of our members! We had to retreat to the temple."
<br><br>
The temple was protected by a variety of powerful restrictions. Apart from Zen, who could come and go as he pleased, even the strongest souls would be burnt to ashes.
<br><br>
"Then he left?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"He went to the Bearing race. We think he went there for soul crystal too,"
<br><br>
the disciple answered.
<br><br>
Soul crystal was very difficult to obtain.
<br><br>
At the moment, there were a lot of elite disciples of the Bearing race here, but they were busy rebuilding their destroyed temple. This meant that no restrictions were yet in place to protect them. And so the man attacked them, eating at least seven souls before the rest of the members of the Bearing race fled from the Other Shore completely.
<br><br>
Once they were gone, the man went through the ruins of the Bearing race's temple.
<br><br>
However, he had come too late. The temple had already been plundered by Zen, and whatever valuables remained had also been taken away by the Bearing race. He wasn't able to find anything useful.
<br><br>
He refused to give up. He went next to the temple of the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
But by then, word had reached them of the danger on the Other Shore, and the temple was heavily guarded. Indeed, in the battle that ensued, the disciples of the Divine Farmer race managed to lure him inside the temple and almost succeeded in killing him. The man managed to escape the temple.
<br><br>
After hearing the story, Zen asked, "So where is this person now?"
<br><br>
"He has probably left the Other Shore. His power to devour souls is terrifying, but apart from that one ability his soul does not seem very strong.
<br><br>
He is also alone. He will find it hard to stand against many elite disciples united against him. When the Bearing race realized what had happened, they cooperated with the Divine Farmer race to send a few Indigo Souls to hunt him down. Unfortunately, they did not succeed in capturing or killing him," said the disciple.
<br><br>
"The power to devour souls... This world is so vast, so full of so many mysteries!" Zen muttered to himself, deep in thought.
<br><br>
That kind of power was formidable. It seemed their unknown enemy was not afraid of any kind of counterattack or adverse reaction from the souls he had devoured.
<br><br>
This man's Soul of Light might not be very strong now, but if he kept on swallowing souls, his cultivation speed would probably not be much slower than that of a warrior absorbing soul crystal. Zen wondered how this man had obtained such a power.
<br><br>
The silver lining was that at least their enemy didn't come from the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race. Better yet, he had apparently struck a severe blow against the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Since Zen had learned what he needed to know, he left the temple and headed straight to the star ring. Dorothy was still waiting for him in Stage Twelve of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
On the way up, Zen didn't stop. He reached Stage Ten in less than an hour.
<br><br>
Soon after that, he stepped into the star ring again.
<br><br>
Several members of the Separate Abyss race stood on the square of Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
They had the task of driving the Souls of Light to the other side to wait in line.
<br><br>
With a glimmer of light, Zen's body appeared in the center of the square.
<br><br>
"You! This way!" one of the men shouted at Zen, coming closer to him. He was about to usher Zen into his proper place in the line when he noticed something strange. He stopped in his tracks, looking stunned. "A corporeal body?"
<br><br>
It was clear that the members of the Separate Abyss race had never met a corporeal body here.
<br><br>
Zen gave him an indifferent glance and walked past him.
<br><br>
The square was full of members of the Separate Abyss race, as well as people of other races who were waiting in line. One by one, as they saw Zen and realized he had a corporeal body, their faces changed and became full of shock and suspicion.
<br><br>
"What the hell is that?"
<br><br>
"This guy doesn't seem to be a Soul of Light..."
<br><br>
"Yes! It's simply a corporeal body!" "But how did he enter the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"What is he? Is he a ghost?"
<br><br>
In their eyes, "ghosts" referred to souls that had left bodies. To this group, a corporeal body on the Other Shore was at least as mysterious and terrifying as a ghost in the outside.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen had no intention of waiting in line. He bypassed everyone and walked up to the group of people in front who seemed to be in charge.
<br><br>
"Excuse me, what can I do for you?" asked one of the men as Zen drew closer. The man was a member of the Separate Abyss race, and seemed to be the leader here.
<br><br>
Given their status in Stage Eleven, these members of the Separate Abyss race tended to have an arrogant attitude towards the new arrivals. Most of the others found them overbearing and supercilious. But Zen was unlike anyone they'd encountered here before. Faced with a corporeal body, they became polite and deferential.
<br><br>
Zen scowled and spoke in a threatening voice, "Repay me a hundredfold for the amount of soul pills you just took! You have charged me a million soul pills, so you must return a hundred million—otherwise, I fear this situation will not end well for you."
<br><br>
The Souls of Light who were waiting in line watched the scene avidly. They felt puzzled at Zen's words. They had no idea what had happened before, but right now Zen's ultimatum was very clear. He was extorting soul pills from the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
Within Stage Eleven of the Other Shore, the Separate Abyss race was the most powerful, and they were the only ones who could blackmail other races. Especially here, no one dared to fight back.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race had extorted soul pills from all the super forces and powerful people. It was rare that someone went against them. This stranger was daring.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race exchanged astonished glances with each other. The truth struck them like a blow—this man in front of them was the person who had just given them soul pills and soul crystal.
<br><br>
The leader was silent for a moment, thinking hard. Then he said to Zen, "We apologize for failing to recognize you. If you want them back, we will return the soul crystal and the two hundred thousand soul pills you gave us." He turned to one of his companions. "Alberto, take out the soul crystal."
<br><br>
He and the others who were in charge of the square didn't have a high position in the Separate Abyss race. They had made a mistake in extorting Zen. Should the leader and elders of the Separate Abyss race ever learn that they had been foolish enough to offend a person capable of coming to the Other Shore in corporeal form, they would be severely punished.
<br><br>
They decided it would be best to avoid further trouble and just return everything to Zen.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light waiting in line couldn't hide their pleasure at seeing the Separate Abyss race humbled.
<br><br>
They who had always been so tough, who had always acted so superior, had finally met their match! Zen gave the members of the Separate Abyss race a cool glance. "No. One hundred million soul pills, or a hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal."
<br><br>
The leader's face changed, and his companions looked worried.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light who were watching couldn't help but feel uneasy too.
<br><br>
What would happen if the Separate Abyss race couldn't meet the stranger's demands? They felt that something big was about to happen.
<br><br>
The leader squared his shoulders and glared at Zen. "Are you joking? It's enough that we will return everything to you. Alberto, hand it over."
<br><br>
Alberto stepped forward and gave the soul crystal to Zen. Zen grasped it in his hand, and squeezed hard.
<br><br>
The soul crystal burst into pieces and splattered around. Some of the fragments shot into the Souls of Light in line, and they were extremely satisfied with this unexpected development.
<br><br>
Without the space ring, Zen could not store soul crystal. And he did not intend to take this finger-size chunk of soul crystal.
<br><br>
At the waste of the soul crystal, the members of the Separate Abyss race groaned.
<br><br>
Zen stared coldly at them. "Send one hundred million soul pills to Stage Twelve. If there is even a single pill missing, I will raze the Separate Abyss race to the ground."
<br><br>
Chapter 3248 The Abyss Spirit Race Zen's statements had left everyone speechless.
<br><br>
Most nonhuman creatures had pinned him to be crazy. They thought he had lost his mind.
<br><br>
It was already a ridiculous thing for Zen to come over and blatantly demand a hundred million soul pills from the Separate Abyss race. And now he continued to assert his dominance by stating he would raze the territory of the Separate Abyss race to the ground.
<br><br>
Among the nonhuman creatures, there was a human. He originated from the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
This man had gone all the way from Stage Four to Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
However, he had only been on the Other Shore for a short while. Therefore, he hadn't witnessed the scene of Zen destroying the temple of the Bearing race before he came here.
<br><br>
But he did hear from his clansmen about everything that had happened in Stage Four, including the fact that Zen could enter the Other Shore with his physical body.
<br><br>
"I didn't expect this brat to suddenly come to Stage Eleven. From the looks of it, the Separate Abyss race has offended him as well. Does he really plan to cause a scene in the Separate Abyss race?"
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race was formidable. Their strength was not something to be underestimated. Even the Bearing race hesitated to provoke them.
<br><br>
Anyone who stood and watched began to anticipate the likelihood of something interesting to happen.
<br><br>
Upon hearing Zen's arrogant words, the leader of the guards laughed mockingly. "What did you say? You want to destroy our territory? Hahaha! What a joke!"
<br><br>
Initially, the Separate Abyss race wanted to come to a compromise with Zen on the issue at hand. After all, Zen was the only one who had arrived at the Other Shore with his physical body. They didn't want to offend him and cause too much trouble for either of them.
<br><br>
If this matter escalated without coming to a conclusion, a rumor would spread that the Separate Abyss race had demanded an exorbitant price. This would result in a severe blow to their reputation.
<br><br>
Now that the situation was getting out of hand, they realized the problem couldn't be solved peacefully. Therefore, they changed their attitudes.
<br><br>
"It's true that it's a remarkable thing to have a physical body on the Other Shore. Other races might be intimidated by you, but, we're not afraid of you!"
<br><br>
"I'd suggest that you move to Stage Twelve if you know what's good for you!"
<br><br>
"We share the same origin with the Abyss Spirit race of the Ancestral Glory Stage. Your physical body is no threat to us!"
<br><br>
There were many creatures of different kinds living on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The strength and durability of beings increased with a higher stage.
<br><br>
Naturally, the ones that lived on Stage One to Stage Four were not much strong in comparison.
<br><br>
Some creatures would even occupy restricted areas where no one else but themselves were allowed on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
There was not much known about these races because they maintained a low profile. They would seldom communicate or interact with the Souls of Light. Similarly, the Souls of Light that roamed the Other Shore would never dare to enter their territories and trespass on them.
<br><br>
However, the Abyss Spirit race from Stage Eleven was an exception.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race and the Abyss Spirit race enjoyed a healthy relationship. It was said that in the middle ages, the Separate Abyss race was not as powerful as they stood today. When the leader of the Separate Abyss race had entered Stage Eleven, he had come across the Abyss Spirit race by chance. After a few interactions, they became exceedingly acquainted with one another.
<br><br>
Since the Abyss Spirit race regarded the Separate Abyss race as their allies, they supported them in all aspects of their growth in Stage Eleven. Due to their relentless assistance, the latter soon took control of Stage Eleven on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It could be said that the Abyss Spirit race had made a significant contribution to their development.
<br><br>
"Oh, really? Is that so?"
<br><br>
With swift movements, Zen grabbed the arm of the man in front of him.
<br><br>
The immense Soul of Light was weightless in Zen's grip, and he threw him straight onto the wide square area.
<br><br>
Watching Zen launch a direct attack made some of the impulsive members of the Separate Abyss race charge forward to avenge their clansman.
<br><br>
Chaos ensued when the other races in the line saw this. They began to flee frantically in all directions like a flock of disturbed birds.
<br><br>
Some people took it as a source of their entertainment, while others were worried since they got involved in the matter for no reason. However, neither of them could get out of this. There was no way to retreat from the Other Shore in this damned place.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race were massive in terms of size, and each of them was innate mighty warriors. Moreover, they cultivated under the watchful eyes of the Abyss Spirit race, who taught them to develop a unique soul method. It was a technique that allowed them to enhance their Souls of Light to an extended degree within a short amount of time.
<br><br>
At the same time, several members of the Separate Abyss race dashed towards Zen to strike. Meanwhile, Zen stood there as he had to bear terrible soul pressure from all of them.
<br><br>
Each of those members was equipped with a soul spear that they thrust at Zen mercilessly.
<br><br>
However, they had underestimated the strength and resistance of Zen's physical body.
<br><br>
Although they had increased their soul power substantially, a soul was still inferior to a body. Moreover, Zen's physical body was far more compelling than that of an average person.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! The soul spears that would usually cause immense damage were like wooden arrows in front of Zen. The moment they came in contact with his body, they cracked into many minuscule pieces.
<br><br>
After a full round of countless attacks towards Zen, he remained tall on his feet completely unscathed.
<br><br>
Realizing that their attacks had all gone to waste, the members of the Separate Abyss race opened their eyes wide in shock. Their leader felt an undeniable fear build up inside of him.
<br><br>
"Alright then, it's my turn now," Zen said as he cracked his knuckles to prepare himself to counterattack.
<br><br>
He never was ruthless towards the people of his own race; he would show them mercy.
<br><br>
When he destroyed the temple of the Bearing race, he had spared the lives of all humans.
<br><br>
However, he didn't consider the members of the Separate Abyss race to be from his race. These intelligent beings were no different from beasts with violent tendencies.
<br><br>
Swish! By stomping on the ground hard with his feet, Zen boosted himself upwards as fast as an arrow released from its bow.
<br><br>
When he passed through a tall and mighty warrior of the Separate Abyss race, he gently pressed on his head.
<br><br>
Swish! The man's Soul of Light diminished in an instant! However, Zen did not plan to stop there. He turned his head to find his next target and rushed towards a man close by. Within a split second, Zen had attacked four people and destroyed their Souls of Light! "He's too strong for us!"
<br><br>
"We can't fight against him!"
<br><br>
"Hurry and inform the Abyss Spirit race!"
<br><br>
The remaining members of the Separate Abyss race began to retreat and flee the field one after the other. But they had nowhere to go since the area was sealed shut.
<br><br>
Zen stood patiently and didn't bother to follow after them to kill them off.
<br><br>
After observing the panicked looks on the faces of other races, he turned to them and said, "Find your own star rings and leave this place."
<br><br>
Without the obstruction of the Separate Abyss race, they were able to leave Stage Eleven through the star rings. And they wouldn't have to pay the heavy fee of ten thousand soul pills.
<br><br>
All the other races were grateful to Zen. He had helped them save ten thousand soul pills. And more importantly, he had taught the arrogant members of the Separate Abyss race a good lesson.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race had kept their dominance over small and powerless races in Stage Eleven and the Source World. It was about time someone showed up and put them in their place.
<br><br>
"Thank you, sir. We are grateful to you for helping us. But you have to be careful with the Abyss Spirit race!"
<br><br>
"Those living creatures on the Other Shore can also present themselves with their physical bodies."
<br><br>
"They are very powerful."
<br><br>
Some people who knew a little about Zen's approaching enemy gave him all the information they had so he could prepare himself.
<br><br>
Zen carefully listened to them and nodded. Then he made his way forward and scanned his surroundings.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race had built an entire city on the Other Shore, not just a temple. The city wall alone stood over a thousand feet high, and the buildings within were at an astounding height of ten thousand feet.
<br><br>
With careful steps, he walked over to the wall and gently pressed his hands against it.
<br><br>
As he exerted a little pressure, the wall which was one thousand feet high and one hundred feet wide collapsed with a loud sound that reverberated far and wide. A noticeable gap was formed.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race, who stood behind the wall, were oblivious to the scenario that took place on the other side. They eyed Zen up in astonishment.

<br><br>
"Did the city wall collapse?"
<br><br>
"Who was strong enough to destroy the wall?" "Was it the Ghost Sneaking Beast?"
<br><br>
Creatures in Stage Twelve of the Other Shore were not limited to those from the Abyss Spirit race and the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
It was also home to unique and powerful beasts, one of which was the Ghost Sneaking Beast.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light in the eleventh stage of the Other Shore Realm were not strong enough to destroy the city wall, but the Ghost Sneaking Beast could.
<br><br>
As usual, Zen, too, was an exception. He could easily destroy the city wall, which was why the Separate Abyss race was astounded by his power.
<br><br>
"What's that?"
<br><br>
"He seems to be a simple human."
<br><br>
"He's not in soul form. Unbelievable!"
<br><br>
Upon seeing Zen, members of the Separate Abyss race gasped.
<br><br>
They could not believe what they were seeing.
<br><br>
Zen squinted as he walked. He remained completely unbothered by their reactions.
<br><br>
He walked calmly and on his toes towards a huge building. Then he crashed into the pillars of the building.
<br><br>
As he moved forward, the pillars broke into pieces.
<br><br>
Members of the Separate Abyss race hastily tried to approach Zen without considering the risks.
<br><br>
"No matter which race you come from! You are courting death!"
<br><br>
"No one has ever dared to go against us, especially not a mere human like you!"
<br><br>
"Are you from the Bearing race?"
<br><br>
Zen didn't want to waste any more time on them.
<br><br>
For those who approached him boldly, Zen simply flicked his arm to smash their Souls of Light.
<br><br>
He had killed several of their members and the Separate Abyss race was quickly realizing how much of a threat he really was.
<br><br>
But they did not give up. They did not leave the Other Shore. Despite Zen's display of strength, they gathered behind him and cursed him. They wanted to stop him but did not dare approach him.
<br><br>
Then, they heard the sound of a rumble.
<br><br>
Zen had passed through another huge building a moment before its collapse.
<br><br>
He walked towards the center of the city, triggering the collapse of every building he passed by.
<br><br>
Nothing could stop him.
<br><br>
More and more members of the Separate Abyss race followed behind Zen.
<br><br>
Each time a building collapsed, their hearts sank deeper.
<br><br>
"Hey, human! Stop!"
<br><br>
"Take what you want!"
<br><br>
The place grew tense.
<br><br>
These people were not figures of authority in the city. Zen had previously asked for a hundred million soul pills, but they refused.
<br><br>
They had to really see Zen's power before they bowed to his wishes.
<br><br>
Zen ignored them profusely.
<br><br>
He passed a wide road where a magnificent building stood.
<br><br>
He remembered his reactions to those temples when he newly entered Stage Four. He could not comprehend then how the human race was capable of such wonder.
<br><br>
The building in front of him put him in even more awe. It was bigger than what he had seen before.
<br><br>
"What a beautiful building!"
<br><br>
Zen remarked.
<br><br>
Members of the Separate Abyss race who trailed behind him trembled at his words. They did not want to lose anything to him anymore.
<br><br>
"What, what do you want to do?" someone of the Separate Abyss race asked.
<br><br>
Zen had already destroyed the buildings in the outer part of the area, but they could not take it if he destroyed the building ahead of them. It was the real temple of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
"I want to tear it down," Zen said nonchalantly.
<br><br>
Then he casually walked towards the building.
<br><br>
"Stop him!"
<br><br>
"Don't let him enter the temple!"
<br><br>
"Nobody can desecrate our temple!"
<br><br>
Members of the Separate Abyss race furiously rushed towards Zen in an attempt to stop him.
<br><br>
However, before they even got close, Zen shattered them instantly.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race fell into despair. Would the temple really be destroyed by a young man? Suddenly, the sound of horns played in the distance.
<br><br>
"Woo-oo-oo!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, huge eagles filled the sky. They flew from outside of the city walls carrying giants on their backs.
<br><br>
The giants bore a close resemblance to those from the Separate Abyss race, but the latter had blurred outlines because they were only Souls of Light.
<br><br>
However, the giants' appearances were clearly visible.
<br><br>
They were from the Abyss Spirit race that lived on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Great! The knights of the Abyss Spirit race are here!"
<br><br>
"They're here to save us!"
<br><br>
"Kill this damn human brat!"
<br><br>
Excitement stirred the place. The Separate Abyss race grew confident.
<br><br>
Their backup finally arrived and they could smell victory coming their way.
<br><br>
Splash! The eagles lined up and swooped towards Zen.
<br><br>
The destruction of buildings was a capital offense both for the Separate Abyss race and the Abyss Spirit race. The Abyss Spirit race were definitely angered by Zen's disrespect. They were determined to kill him.
<br><br>
Splash! As the Abyss Spirit knights neared Zen, they revealed white bone spears in their hands.
<br><br>
Bone spears were known to be even more powerful than soul spears.
<br><br>
"Kill him!"
<br><br>
The Abyss Spirit knights shouted with conviction.
<br><br>
'How strong could these creatures from the Other Shore be?' Zen squinted his eyes as if inspecting their features.
<br><br>
He did not know much about the Other Shore even though he was a competent Indigo Soul now.
<br><br>
In his long stay on the Other Shore, he had only encountered two types of aboriginal creatures. One was the Heavenly Spider's body in the Sacred Mallow Temple, and the other was the Thunder Beast in the temple of Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
For the first time, he encountered two creatures at the same time in the same place. One was the Abyss Spirit race, and the other was the flying eagles that they rode.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
A bone spear flew towards him but Zen was able to avoid it. He stretched out his hand and easily grabbed the spear.
<br><br>
"They seem strong.
<br><br>
Much powerful than Souls of Light.
<br><br>
But they can't be strong enough to defeat me!" Zen said scornfully.
<br><br>
As soon as he grasped the bone spear, Zen pushed it out with his hand.
<br><br>
The bone spear lashed in the air. It emitted a whistling sound as it landed directly on the chest of an Abyss Spirit knight.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Blood spewed out of the body of the Abyss Spirit knight. He lost his balance and fell from the back of the eagle. His bleeding body lay crumpled on the ground. The eagle, disoriented from what happened, followed suit. It flapped its wings to carry itself up but failed.
<br><br>
Zen grabbed another spear and threw it towards another Abyss Spirit knight rushing towards him.
<br><br>
"Bang! Bang! Bang!"
<br><br>
Zen kept on throwing spears, each time hitting an Abyss Spirit knight right on the chest. Bodies fell from the sky and crushed on the ground.
<br><br>
The Abyss Spirit race was indeed stronger than the Souls of Light, but they were only creatures of Stage Eleven. This meant that Zen was still miles stronger in terms of pure physical strength.
<br><br>
A total of eight Abyss Spirit knights lay on the ground. The others panicked behind Zen, trying to force the eagles into flight.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a look of terror dawned on the faces of the Abyss Spirit knights.
<br><br>
"Does he cultivate Wild God Power?"
<br><br>
"Are we dealing with a Wild God once more?"
<br><br>
"No way! Rules have been changed. No Wild God could enter the Other Shore. It has been like that for the past tens of millions of years!"
<br><br>
The Abyss Spirit knights exchanged frightened murmurs as they shared the memories of the time when they were dominated by Wild Gods.
<br><br>
Chapter 3250 The Past In ancient times, the warriors of the Source World mainly cultivated the Wild God system, and they used the Ancient God Cultivation Method to enter the Other Shore.
<br><br>
At that time, it was much easier to travel on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
A Wild God could become tens of thousands of feet tall. As the corporeal body was far stronger than the soul, warriors of the Source World were immensely powerful when they entered the Other Shore with their real bodies. At that time, the creatures on the Other Shore, who were at a significant disadvantage, were easily slaughtered by the Wild Gods.
<br><br>
A race like them could only hide in a corner of the Ancestral Glory Stage.
<br><br>
Every time the Wild Gods plundered the Other Shore, it was disastrous for the whole Abyss Spirit race.
<br><br>
At one point, the Wild Gods had almost annihilated the Abyss Spirit race! Everything happened at that time was like a nightmare. This was indeed a dark period for the Abyss Spirit race.
<br><br>
After the decline of the cultivation method of the Wild Gods and changes in the truth rules, the creatures on the Other Shore earned a gradual respite.
<br><br>
This reprieve allowed struggling races, like the Abyss Spirit race, to pull through. Eventually, these creatures turned the tables and took the lead.
<br><br>
Those who entered the Other Shore later were weak Souls of Light. Without their corporeal bodies, how could they possibly be a match for the creatures on the Other Shore? As a result, the races on the Other Shore took furious revenge for what they had endured! At that time, stages above Stage Four were death land for the powerful warriors of the Other Shore Realm. They were extremely dangerous places, and any Other Shore Realm warrior that entered would die because none could resist the attack of the races on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
This was also the reason why most races had built their temples on Stage Four. Although there were also Other Shore creatures that lived on Stage One to Stage Four, they hadn't formed any groups, and they wouldn't target the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Over time, the hatred the Other Shore creatures harbored for the Source World warriors gradually subsided. No one knew why.
<br><br>
From the middle ages until now, the Other Shore creatures and the Souls of Light had managed to co-exist peacefully. Some of the large races even chose to form alliances with the races on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Abyss Spirit race and the Separate Abyss race, for example, were connected by blood, and thus, naturally associated.
<br><br>
After the few Separate Abyss members, who had extorted soul pills from warriors passing through Stage Eleven, fled, the matter was reported to the senior leaders of their race. These senior leaders quickly communicated with the Abyss Spirit race, who then sent Abyss Spirit knights to confront Zen before he could destroy the temple of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
These Abyss Spirit knights were almost invincible. Although their cultivation was not extraordinary, the Souls of Light in the Lust World could not resist them at all. Unfortunately for these Abyss Spirit knights, they had no idea that they were about to deal with a corporeal body! Naturally, what they saw before their eyes alarmed them. The fear hidden deep within their hearts erupted and coursed through them like an unstoppable force.
<br><br>
Those who had survived the dark ages would never want that history to repeat itself.
<br><br>
And people who had heard about the dark times would always be seized by terror whenever they thought about it.
<br><br>
If warriors could enter the Other Shore with their corporeal bodies again, it would undoubtedly mean the return of the darkness.
<br><br>
"Wild God?"
<br><br>
A playful smile appeared on Zen's face.
<br><br>
In the entire chaos, perhaps only those living at the bottom of the chaos cultivated the Wild God system. However, none of them could use the Ancient God Cultivation Method to enter the Other Shore. Zen had not tried to activate his Wild Body after he arrived on the Other Shore. He said to the Abyss Spirit knights, "Is this the Wild God you were discussing?"
<br><br>
Then, his body began to grow.
<br><br>
In a flash, his body reached over ten thousand feet in height.
<br><br>
Even the Abyss Spirit knights who were sitting on the back of the eagles needed to look up at him.
<br><br>
They paled and the flying eagles became restless at the sight of Zen's enlarged body.
<br><br>
"He really cultivates the Wild God system!"
<br><br>
"I heard about the Wild Gods from my grandfather, but I didn't expect him to grow to such a massive size!"
<br><br>
"He is probably over ten thousand tall, isn't he?"
<br><br>
The Abyss Spirit knights present stared at Zen with their mouths wide open.
<br><br>
Even the large number of Souls of Light from the Separate Abyss race, who were in the city, gaped at Zen.
<br><br>
When the Abyss Spirit knights arrived, it boosted the morale of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of the Separate Abyss race in the city had often heard about the powerful strength of the Abyss Spirit knights, but none had ever seen it. Over the years, no one had dared to make trouble on Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
Even if someone caused trouble, it was not serious enough to alert the Abyss Spirit knights! Who would have thought that such a powerful team of Abyss Spirit knights would be so weak in front of Zen? They were all depressed, shocked, and confused when they saw Zen's body expand to such a degree in the blink of an eye. The Souls of Light exuded an aura of fear, and the more cowardly ones retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But most of them were reluctant to leave.
<br><br>
"Oh, dear! Did fate send him to wipe out our Separate Abyss race?"
<br><br>
"We, the Separate Abyss race, have occupied Stage Eleven for many years.
<br><br>
Is this the end of our happy days?"
<br><br>
"It seems that... our temple might be destroyed today."
<br><br>
In the corner of this large city, the Soul of Light of the Separate Abyss race, who had blackmailed Zen, trembled when he saw Zen's colossal body. It was only now that he understood where Zen's confidence came from, and he was regretful for what he had done before.
<br><br>
"One hundred million soul pills is not an exorbitant amount to pay to make him leave."
<br><br>
"One hundred million soul pills!"
<br><br>
"Give them to him!"
<br><br>
the Soul of Light muttered as he rushed into the temple. He was so terrorized by fear that he was already out of his mind.
<br><br>
On the square outside the city, many non-human creatures also saw the giant figure rising on the horizon. Zen's body was so enormous that it would be difficult for them not to notice him.
<br><br>
"That is a human?"
<br><br>
"He seems familiar. Could it be the man who was here just now?"
<br><br>
"How did this person become so huge?"
<br><br>
Although these non-human creatures knew that Zen wanted to make trouble for the Separate Abyss race, they never expected that he would use such an incredible way...
<br><br>
Currently, the temple only reached Zen's calf. It seemed as though he could trample an entire temple just by lifting his leg. While the thought terrified everyone, only Zen knew that he wasn't capable of such damage.
<br><br>
Although he had absorbed a large number of wild bones, the limit his body could grow into was far more than ten thousand feet high.
<br><br>
However, the Wild God Power was incomparable to the Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
After all, the Wild Gods corresponded to True Gods, and when Zen was just a consummate True God, the force he could unleash with his full strength was only one divine megaton.
<br><br>
As the ancient Wild Gods, who had used the Ancient God Cultivation Method to enter the Other Shore, cultivated Truth of Powerful Holy Body, they were able to merge with Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
However, Zen was special as he hadn't cultivated the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. And so, he didn't know whether his body could merge with Other Shore Tokens, or if it could, how he should go about it.
<br><br>
Just then, three more eagles flew toward Zen from outside the city.
<br><br>
Three elders of the Abyss Spirit race were on the backs of these flying eagles. They had lived for a very long time, as evident from their shrunken sizes. They were pygmies when compared with the Abyss Spirit knights.
<br><br>
The three old men hovered in front of Zen. The white-haired old man at the helm asked, "Human boy, why do you destroy our city and temple for no reason?"
<br><br>
Zen sneered, "Ask the Separate Abyss race. They forced a human to pay one million soul pills to pass Stage Eleven. How could you say that I have no reason?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3251 Reach An Compromise Zen's thunderous voice shook the Souls of Light to the core.
<br><br>
His words shocked everyone, especially the three old men from the Abyss Spirit race The three did not show it but what just happened made them worry greatly.
<br><br>
If Zen came here to make trouble for no reason, then they would be in great trouble. However, if he had some reason to do what he did, things would be different because that meant that they had a chance of negotiating with him.
<br><br>
The leader of the three old men bowed respectfully to Zen. "My friend, please calm down and wait a moment. I shall go and ask the Separate Abyss race regarding this matter."
<br><br>
With this, the eagle beneath his feet let out a shrill cry before descending towards the temple.
<br><br>
There was a bit of a five-minute wait before the old man returned, still atop the eagle, and faced Zen. "I apologize for what the members of the Separate Abyss race did. They were the ones who broke the rules and inconvenienced you. As compensation, we will be giving you a hundred million soul pills."
<br><br>
That amount might seem like a terrible loss at first, but they could easily earn it back. One hundred million soul pills was just the toll fee of ten thousand creatures after all.
<br><br>
Zen's rampage in the city cost no less than a hundred million soul pills, but it was important to placate him now, or they would risk paying a bigger price if he continued his destructive ways.
<br><br>
What the old man was worried about was the possibility of Zen going back on his word.
<br><br>
"Send one hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal instead of one hundred million soul pills to the human race's star ring in Stage Twelve," Zen ordered.
<br><br>
Given his reasonable demand, the three old men of the Abyss Spirit race raised no more objections against him.
<br><br>
Once an agreement had been reached, Zen finally shrank back to his normal size.
<br><br>
With this problem taken care of, the young man turned away to take his leave. The old man of the Abyss Spirit race, however, stopped him. "My friend..."
<br><br>
Zen turned around, an eyebrow raised in suspicion. "What is it?"
<br><br>
The old man hesitated for a brief moment but went ahead to ask his question. "As far as I know, the body refining skill of the ancient gods has long since lost its effect and no real body could enter the Other Shore. Just how were you able to enter with that body of yours?"
<br><br>
Truth ruled the whole chaos. It was greater than everything and the old man believed that it was also unbreakable. Zen's existence right now was an enigma. How exactly did this young man do it? The only explanation the old man could think of was that Zen surpassed the truth, but that was impossible! Surpassing the truth would mean that he was stronger than the Chaos Ancient Gods and there was no way that was the case given his cultivation base.
<br><br>
"I... I don't know either. Even if I did, why should I tell you?" Zen answered coyly.
<br><br>
His reply had the old man blush in embarrassment. Since the young man was unwilling to disclose his secret, then all they could really do was let him leave quietly.
<br><br>
Numerous members of the Separate Abyss race lined the road that led out of the city. Almost all of them stared at Zen in fear as he walked past.
<br><br>
None of them knew of the fact that they weren't the first ones to suffer his wrath. The Bearing race had previously tasted the bitter consequences of angering this human man.
<br><br>
Outside the city, Zen stepped into the human race's star ring and immediately entered Stage Twelve.
<br><br>
Dorothy had been waiting for him for quite a while now. She immediately heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing him finally walk out of the star ring.
<br><br>
Going against the Separate Abyss race was an entirely different can of worms compared to when Zen went against the Bearing race. The main reason was that the Separate Abyss race was backed by the Abyss Spirit race who were natives of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"How did it go?" Dorothy asked, hiding her worries with a nonchalant greeting.
<br><br>
"It went fine. We should wait here for a moment," Zen told her.
<br><br>
"Why?" Dorothy asked.
<br><br>
Zen smirked. "One hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal."
<br><br>
Dorothy let out a slight gasp. "You seriously made them pay you back with one hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal? And they said yes? Did you demolish their entire temple or something?"
<br><br>
She was well aware of how arrogant and domineering the Separate Abyss race was. For Zen to have made them agree to his terms and pay him back meant he probably caused great damage to their temple.
<br><br>
Zen shrugged. "Kind of. We came to an agreement before I managed to destroy their temple."
<br><br>
Dorothy was no fool. No matter how casual Zen made it out to be, she knew that he caused a great deal of devastation to the Separate Abyss race for things to have turned out this way.
<br><br>
'It's as Grandma said. Once Zen passed the Sea of Truth in the form of his body, he can do whatever he wants on the Other Shore. He's already demolished the Bearing race's temple, and almost destroyed the Separate Abyss race's. He's truly leaving a trail of destruction in his wake, isn't he?' she thought to herself.
<br><br>
The two of them waited for two more hours before a Soul of Light appeared and immediately headed towards Zen.
<br><br>
There was only one corporeal body here on the Other Shore which made identifying Zen quite easy.
<br><br>
"I've been entrusted by the Separate Abyss race to hand you the agreed settlement," the Soul of Light told Zen politely, taking out small pillars from his space ring. These were the one hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal.
<br><br>
Zen accepted these pillars and casually threw them to Dorothy. He nodded back to the Soul of Light in front of him. "They gave you these. Weren't they scared you'd run away with the soul crystal or something?"
<br><br>
The courier laughed. "You've got quite the sense of humor, sir! My corporeal body is in the Separate Abyss race. How in the world would I be able to run away?"
<br><br>
Zen shrugged and figured that it made sense. The Separate Abyss race was a super force, so there was a huge possibility that they would have a number of warriors from other races serving them.
<br><br>
Since the soul crystal had been delivered, the courier stepped back into the star ring and returned to Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
Zen's body left the Other Shore and his Soul of Light returned. He had no intention of staying at Stage Twelve for too long. Instead, he entered the star ring and continued straight to Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
Stage Thirteen, also known as the Ethereal Glorious Stage, was the last and most important stage of the Lust World.
<br><br>
Most Souls of Light stayed here in search of the most suitable Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
The Ethereal Glorious Stage never disappointed. Even until now, this stage continued to hold a lot of unveiled secrets and unexplored temples.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, its splendor was countered by how dangerous it was. Six or seven native races lived in this stage along with other strong and dangerous creatures that still hadn't formed their own tribe. It was easily the most perilous stage in the entire Lust World.
<br><br>
Several great forces had made numerous attempts to control the Ethereal Glorious Stage, much like how the Separate Abyss race managed to gain control of Stage Eleven. However, all of them failed. The natives of this stage fought with each other quite violently so there was no way the Souls of Light from the Source World could come in and take control.
<br><br>
When Zen reached Stage Thirteen, he was a bit taken aback to how different it was from what he initially imagined. "I thought Stage Thirteen would be desolate. I didn't expect it to be quite a busy place."
<br><br>
Star rings from all races were strewn about here and there. What was most peculiar was the fact that despite the co-existence of all sorts of creatures, they got along rather harmoniously.
<br><br>
Souls of Light who had the ability to step into Stage Thirteen were usually Indigo Souls or one step away from that realm.
<br><br>
"Elite disciples of all races from the Source World gather here in Stage Thirteen. There are naturally more Indigo Souls here," Dorothy told him.
<br><br>
Unlike Zen, she didn't seem that surprised at the scene before them despite the fact that this was her first time here.
<br><br>
The two of them went past the randomly strewn star rings and headed south where they stumbled upon a one-floor building.
<br><br>
Dorothy sighed with relief. "It's here!"
<br><br>
No race ever built a temple in Stage Thirteen, instead, they constructed simple strongholds and the one in front of them was built by none other than the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Chapter 3252 The Growing Dark Region As Zen and Dorothy cautiously approached the stronghold, they noticed it wasn't as guarded as the temples.
<br><br>
Even by the entrance, there wasn't a guard in sight. Zen and Dorothy exchanged uncertain glances, but proceeded anyway. There, they were greeted by a lone figure.
<br><br>
"Dorothy, so glad to meet you," the figure bowed to Dorothy. Then, turning to Zen, he cupped his hands courteously. "Nice to meet you as well, Zen."
<br><br>
Dorothy and Jermain had arranged to meet by the entrance beforehand. He had been waiting for them there expectantly.
<br><br>
Immediately recognizing the man's voice, Zen smiled. "Nice to meet you, too, Jermain."
<br><br>
Back in the Seven Mountains Meeting, Jermain had also performed well and eventually led the Origin Mountain in winning second place.
<br><br>
Zen secretly thought Jermain's talent was slightly inferior to that of Elvinia and Milo.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, even he agreed that Jermain must have something extraordinary about him; after all, he was a leader of the disciples of the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Zen squinted. He could sense that Jermain had a unique Soul of Light, which was also an Indigo Soul, thus his aura glowed a deep purple.
<br><br>
However, what piqued Zen's curiosity was the three palm-sized souls that hovered behind Jermain. Upon a closer look, Zen noticed that the three little souls looked exactly like Jermain.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Jermain felt Zen's curious stare. Then, the three souls approached Zen, flitting about him almost playfully.
<br><br>
"Zen, are you curious about us?" one palm-sized soul asked.
<br><br>
"We are separate fractal souls," another explained.
<br><br>
"Each of us is a separate individual," the third continued.
<br><br>
The three souls circled Zen as they explained. Each one sounded exactly like Jermain, which made Zen feel somewhat unsettled.
<br><br>
"Jermain," Dorothy giggled, "your separate souls are so funny!"
<br><br>
She had known prior that Jermain had separated three souls from his main soul, but this was the first time she had met them.
<br><br>
"Why did you split your soul?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Before Jermain could even open his mouth to respond, Dorothy answered for him. "Because his Other Shore Token is 'four in one', and belongs to the descending type."
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token Dorothy was talking about was Jermain's four clay figurines. Each one could transform into any shape in the Source World.
<br><br>
But he needed a soul to control each piece, which was why he split his.
<br><br>
"I see," Zen nodded.
<br><br>
He understood. Some Other Shore Tokens were so outstanding and worth splitting one's soul.
<br><br>
"Anyway," Jermain finally said. "Let's go! Let me introduce this region to you first."
<br><br>
He had patiently waited for Dorothy so that he could serve as a guide for them. Stage Thirteen, being the last stage of the Lust World, was very different from other stages.
<br><br>
Jermain proceeded to lead them away from the simple stronghold. "Stage Thirteen is completely different from Stage Twelve and the rest."
<br><br>
As he spoke, the little souls flew to Zen and Dorothy. Then, they banded together to transform into a round cake.
<br><br>
"The first twelve stages are round-shaped with star rings distributed randomly. Only Stage Eleven is an exception as it is controlled by the Separate Abyss race. You must have known that," Jermain said bluntly.
<br><br>
Dorothy and Zen both nodded. They had guessed the Separate Abyss race was still in chaos.
<br><br>
"But Stage Thirteen is long and narrow." Jermain slightly wagged his finger, and suddenly, the round cake was sliced on both sides, leaving a long, thin strip of its middle. "The star rings of all races in the Source World are gathered at one end, and the way to the Desire World is on the other end."
<br><br>
Dorothy gasped softly. She and Zen understood immediately. Exchanging pleased looks subtly, they were impressed by Jermain's visually-aided explanation.
<br><br>
"Why is Stage Thirteen like this?" Zen asked, eyebrow raised.
<br><br>
Jermain smiled. "Actually, Stage Thirteen was once round, too. But now, like the two parts of cake I sliced off, those regions are covered by the darkness." His expression darkened. "If one entered the Dark Region rashly, they would fall into the dark void. Even now, the Dark Region continues to expand, albeit slowly. Perhaps one day, the two Dark Regions will merge into one, completely covering the path. The road to the Desire World would be impassable."
<br><br>
At the mention of the Dark Region, Zen's heart skipped a beat.
<br><br>
He recalled that time he obtained certain candles from the bottom of the Sea of Truth. While Zen couldn't feel the Other Shore Power in the candles, No.
<br><br>
9527 had asked him to keep them carefully, as he would need them if he were to enter the Dark Region.
<br><br>
No. 9527 said Zen probably wouldn't need them in the near future, so Zen had just tucked them away into a corner of his space ring.
<br><br>
"Just like I said," a voice within him whispered. "You need the candles to enter the Dark Region."
<br><br>
"Is there truly a Dark Region in Stage Thirteen?" Zen asked the voice.
<br><br>
"This is the first I've heard of it," No. 9527 replied. "In the past, the Dark Region only crept along the highest stages; but it's possible it has reached Stage Thirteen in recent years."
<br><br>
"All who enter Stage Thirteen have two motives," Jermain continued. "One, to obtain better Other Shore Tokens. Two, to go to the Desire World."
<br><br>
Turning to the two, he suddenly asked, "Are you going to the Desire World directly or wanting to obtain an Other Shore Token here first?"
<br><br>
Jermain had figured both Zen and Dorothy would have had brilliant Other Shore Tokens already, as they were the famed talents of the Oneness Sky Palace. This meant they were probably here to enter the Desire World.
<br><br>
But to his surprise, Zen answered, "I need an Other Shore Token that is suitable for the Truth of Cultivation Nature."
<br><br>
Jermain hesitated momentarily. He wasn't expecting this answer. After all, he had witnessed Zen's incredible strength at the Seven Mountains Meeting: Zen lifted a boulder by himself, so he must have an Other shore Token of the strengthening type. Then, it dawned on him. "So you cultivate two Truths of Godly Ways..."
<br><br>
That was a great surprise to him. In his common sense, people rarely cultivated two Truths of Godly Ways when they were in the Lust Word.
<br><br>
Only after reaching the Chaotic Source Realm would they choose to cultivate the second Truth of Godly Way for greater power.
<br><br>
Zen smiled. He didn't tell Jermain that he was cultivating three ways, not two only.
<br><br>
"You can try exploring the temples," Jermain suggested. "Or, buy one in the rats' auction."
<br><br>
"The rats' auction?" Zen asked. "Are you referring to the Ear Mouse race?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Jermain replied.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were notoriously greedy. Even though they already held great power and dominated the trade on the Other Shore, other races still despised them as rats.
<br><br>
Zen had heard before that the Ear Mouse race monopolized trade on the Other Shore. But he had yet to come across them, since he had chosen to explore only temples in the previous stages.
<br><br>
Jermain's words piqued his interest.
<br><br>
Zen reflected on his assets. He had obtained 100 finger-size chunks of soul crystal that were worth a hundred million soul pills from the Separate Abyss race. Additionally, he had a considerable amount of loot from the Bearing race.
<br><br>
If the Ear Mouse race auctioned some extremely precious Other Shore Tokens, then he'd definitely opt to just buy one, rather than waste time and energy exploring.
<br><br>
"Please take us to the auction," Dorothy spoke his thoughts.
<br><br>
Jermain sighed at Dorothy's enthusiasm for Zen. She was, after all, considered a brilliant talent in the Oneness Sky Palace-- many disciples of the Origin Mountain sought her attention. Anyone who saw how devoted she was to Zen would feel heartbroken.
<br><br>
Chapter 3253 Selling Other Shore Tokens The three of them traveled north for a while under Jermain's guidance before they spotted a low-rise building.
<br><br>
Many people were gathered in front of the building and seemed to be waiting for something.
<br><br>
Jermain went to make an inquiry. Before long, he returned to them and said to Zen, "There are two hours left before the auction starts. Looks like we'll have to wait here."
<br><br>
"Since the Ear Mice are in charge of the auction, they will also have to purchase the Other Shore Tokens. You can sell the tokens to them," Dorothy reminded Zen.
<br><br>
At her words, Zen remembered that he had a large number of Other Shore Tokens stashed away.
<br><br>
All these Other Shore Tokens were precious treasures of the Bearing race and were of great value.
<br><br>
Zen had studied each of them with precise concentration. They were good, but none was particularly suited to him.
<br><br>
He had now merged with two Other Shore Tokens, the Strength God Totem and the Eye of Will, both of which had their own uses. But he must now be very careful when he merged with the last Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Selling the extra Other Shore Tokens was the best option he had at the moment.
<br><br>
"The Ear Mice will buy the Other Shore Tokens, but they are very picky.
<br><br>
They don't like ordinary Other Shore Tokens. I'll take you there," Jermain said.
<br><br>
This was Zen's first time in Stage Thirteen. Zen hadn't upgraded his soul to the Indigo Soul during the Seven Mountains Meeting and could stay in Stage Four at most. That was why in Jermain's eyes, Zen shouldn't have obtained any quality Other Shore Tokens in such a short period of time.
<br><br>
But Jermain didn't know that Zen had plundered a number of Other Shore Tokens from the Bearing race's temple.
<br><br>
"Don't bother. Zen can go by himself," Dorothy said.
<br><br>
Jermain had probably heard all about the commotion in Stage Four and would eventually figure out his true identity if Zen were to take out over a hundred Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
And although Dorothy trusted Jermain, she didn't want to expose Zen's identity.
<br><br>
Jermain was curious but didn't say anything. He merely showed Zen the directions he had to follow.
<br><br>
Zen followed Jermain's instructions and walked around the small building until he found another entrance.
<br><br>
A shrill voice sounded behind him the moment he entered it.
<br><br>
"Human! Are you going in to sell the Other Shore Tokens?" An Ear Mouse about half the height of a man was hurrying over to him.
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Zen.
<br><br>
"Follow me," the Ear Mouse squeaked.
<br><br>
It ushered Zen into a low house. Zen had to bend in half to enter and move through the house.
<br><br>
There were two other Ear Mice in the house. They greeted him and said, "Please show us the Other Shore Tokens that you have. But I must tell you that we do not accept trash. If your Other Shore Tokens are not above the fourth grade, you can just leave."
<br><br>
"The fourth grade? Are the Other Shore Tokens graded as well?" Zen asked, stunned.
<br><br>
The three Ear Mice looked at each other.
<br><br>
Zen was looking to sell them his Other Shore Tokens without even knowing how the Other Shore Tokens were graded. Was he kidding? The Ear Mouse that had led Zen in pointed to the door and said with an angry squeak, "You can leave if you don't even know the token grades. We are very busy and don't appreciate you wasting our time!" Its tone had suddenly become unfriendly.
<br><br>
Zen truly didn't know how the Other Shore Tokens were graded.
<br><br>
He had thought that the Other Shore Tokens were graded according to where they were found. For example, the Other Shore Tokens found in Stage Two were stronger than those in Stage One, and the ones in Stage Thirteen were more powerful than those in Stage Twelve.
<br><br>
Such a grading method was simple but not rigorous. It was true that there were many common Other Shore Tokens in Stage One, but some of them were excellent. For example, Zen's Eye of Will was an excellent Other Shore Token from Stage One.
<br><br>
Zen felt helplessness seep into him at the sight of the Ear Mice trying to drive him away. He stretched out a hand, a square appearing on his fingers.
<br><br>
An Other Shore Token had fallen out of his space ring. "I'm sorry. I really don't know how to grade the Other Shore Tokens. Please advise me on it."
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token that Zen had pulled out of the ring was the skull of an animal. It had sharp horns and emitted an extraordinary aura.
<br><br>
The eyes of the three Ear Mice lit up when they saw the skull.
<br><br>
"It's the ox skull of Stage Five!"
<br><br>
"It is a fourth-grade token!"
<br><br>
"We will buy it!"
<br><br>
The three Ear Mice squeaked in unison, as if by prior agreement.
<br><br>
Zen's eyebrows went up at their enthusiasm. He took this opportunity to ask them about the grading of the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
"You don't even know how the grading of Other Shore Tokens works! How did you even cultivate the Indigo Soul? What a strange human you are!"
<br><br>
one of the Ear Mice squeaked incredulously before continuing to explain the method to him. "The Other Shore Tokens are usually divided into six grades, ranked from one to six."
<br><br>
The higher the grade of the Other Shore Tokens, the more expensive they would be. If the Other Shore Tokens were of the same grade, their stages would determine their prices.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse who was examining the skull piped up. "The ox skull of Stage Five is worth one hundred thousand soul pills. Will you accept it?"
<br><br>
"Sure," Zen agreed, nodding.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse pulled out one hundred thousand soul pills from its space ring and handed them over to Zen. "Here are one hundred thousand soul pills. You can leave now."
<br><br>
Zen had sold just one Other Shore Token. He didn't want to leave yet.
<br><br>
He took something else out of his space ring.
<br><br>
"It is from Stage Six. It's of the fourth grade, worth one hundred and twenty thousand soul pills," the Ear Mouse said.
<br><br>
"Okay." Zen nodded again.
<br><br>
Just as the Ear Mice had begun to think that Zen would now leave, he took out another Other Shore Token, rendering the Ear Mice speechless.
<br><br>
They had thought Zen didn't have anything of substance with him. But now that he was pulling more Other Shore Tokens out of his space ring, they were shocked. One of them asked, "How many Other Shore Tokens do you want to sell? Can you take them out in one go? We have been doing business on the Other Shore for many years. We have a good reputation, and we won't cheat you."
<br><br>
Zen looked at each of the three Ear Mice before taking out the Other Shore Tokens from his space ring under their eager gaze.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice hadn't taken Zen's Other Shore Tokens seriously in the beginning. But they soon found something unusual with his tokens. The worst of the Other Shore Tokens in Zen's space ring belonged to the fourth grade. He even had a couple of fifth-grade tokens among them! They remained calm even when Zen took out a dozen Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
But as the pile grew, as many as sixty Other Shore Tokens in it, the three Ear Mice looked at Zen with shock.
<br><br>
"He doesn't even know the grading system. Where did he get so many Other Shore Tokens?"
<br><br>
'They are from different stages. Did this guy rob a temple of some super force?' 'I can't believe this! I've been buying Other Shore Tokens for so many years, but I've never seen anyone sell tokens like this!' The Ear Mice thought to themselves as they looked suspiciously at the pile of Other Shore Tokens before them.
<br><br>
Most Souls of Light would explore a certain stage and collect the Other Shore Tokens over there. It wasn't necessary for them to explore every single stage.
<br><br>
Chapter 3254 The Loot As more and more Other Shore Tokens emerged from Zen's space ring, the Ear Mice's eyes grew wider and wider.
<br><br>
"It's of the fifth grade! I can't believe it!"
<br><br>
"There are three Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirteen. Two are fourthgrade, and one is fifth-grade!"
<br><br>
The three Ear Mice had Indigo Souls. Although they weren't powerful fighters, they knew their trade.
<br><br>
Even though they were in shock, they still managed to gather their wits.
<br><br>
With briefly exchanged glances, one of the three quietly left the room through the back door.
<br><br>
Although Zen was preoccupied with taking the Other Shore Tokens out of his space ring, out of the corner of his eye, he observed the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
Seeing one of them leave, Zen inadvertently smiled.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse had probably gone to find out the origin of these Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
The other two Ear Mice began to busy themselves, assessing the values of each of Zen's Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
As expected, the value of the fourth-grade Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirteen was higher than that of those from Stage Twelve.
<br><br>
The fourth-grade ox skull from Stage Five was sold for only one hundred thousand soul pills, but a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen was worth two million and five hundred thousand. And a fifthgrade one from Stage Thirteen was worth nearly twenty-two million! "This is a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Three," one of them squeaked. "We usually don't buy such things. It's worth fifty thousand soul pills. But we will make an exception for now."
<br><br>
"Eight thousand soul pills for a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage One," the other added.
<br><br>
The two Ear Mice assessed the Other Shore Tokens, commenting on each of them.
<br><br>
Zen was well aware that they were just stalling, but he wasn't worried. He wasn't in a hurry, anyway.
<br><br>
Since the Ear Mice were so intelligent, Zen knew it would only be a matter of time before they'd find out what happened to the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Just as Zen thought about this, the Ear Mouse that had quietly left earlier finally returned. It looked directly at Zen. "I have something to discuss with them," it squeaked, gesturing at its colleagues. "May we have a moment?"
<br><br>
"Okay." Zen nodded and sat there quietly.
<br><br>
Then, the three Ear Mice left the room to confide in each other.
<br><br>
"I've asked around already," the Ear Mouse said. "A few days ago, the temple of the Bearing race was destroyed!"
<br><br>
"What? Their temple was destroyed?!" one cried in shock.
<br><br>
"Who destroyed it?" the other asked.
<br><br>
The other two Ear Mice wiggled their whiskers in confusion.
<br><br>
"Not only was their temple destroyed, but all their accumulated wealth, like soul crystal and Other Shore Tokens, have been looted," the Ear Mouse continued. "What's more, they've warned us not to buy their Other Shore Tokens if someone tries to sell them!"
<br><br>
The other two shrugged indifferently. The Ear Mouse race had offended many races in the past. Offending one more race wouldn't hurt. Even though the Bearing race was one of the strongest human forces, the Ear Mice were under the impression that there was nothing the Bearing race would be able to do if they wanted to buy these Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
"I wonder who was powerful enough to destroy their temple," one Ear Mouse mused.
<br><br>
"Haw haw, it was a human who destroyed the temple of the Bearing race,"
<br><br>
the first Ear Mouse continued. "And he also destroyed the city that the Separate Abyss race had built in Stage Eleven. In fact, he almost destroyed their temple, too!"
<br><br>
The other two Ear Mice stared at it, wide eyed.
<br><br>
"What? Did I hear you wrong?"
<br><br>
"Did you just say 'a human'?"
<br><br>
The Bearing race was one of the most powerful human forces. Moreover, the Separate Abyss race was one of the top super forces in the Source World. They had taken control of Stage Eleven, garnering the support of the Abyss Spirit race. It had been difficult for the Ear Mice to get any news there.
<br><br>
The other two Ear Mice shook their heads in disbelief. This was just too much! "Even the powerful Indigo Souls in Stage Thirteen couldn't do those things."
<br><br>
"Right. The power of the Indigo Souls in the Lust World is indeed limited.
<br><br>
Besides, even the top masters in the Desire World can't do those things."
<br><br>
Seeing how its peers didn't believe what it was saying, the Ear Mouse said in a hushed whisper, "It's because he is not a soul, but a corporeal body!"
<br><br>
"A what? Corporeal body? It makes sense, but..."
<br><br>
"How can a corporeal body enter the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
The other two Ear Mice couldn't take it anymore. There was too much shocking news.
<br><br>
With his corporeal body, one could run wild on the Other Shore. The ridiculous things could be explained reasonably in this way, but it sounded even more ridiculous to enter the Other Shore with a corporeal body.
<br><br>
"I don't care if you believe it or not. This is the news I got," the first Ear Mouse said impatiently.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were good at sifting through information; they knew fake news from the truth.
<br><br>
"So, if that's the case, should we buy the Other Shore Tokens from that guy?" an Ear Mouse asked, pointing a thumb back at the enclosed room.
<br><br>
The first Ear Mouse hesitated but said, "Of course!"
<br><br>
Even if they had bought the loot, the Bearing race wouldn't find it easily.
<br><br>
Even if the Bearing race found it, they could resort to sophistry. Whatever happened, it wouldn't pose too much of a problem if they ended up offending the Bearing race.
<br><br>
However, they figured that person selling the loot must have something to do with the corporeal body that wreaked havoc throughout the stages.
<br><br>
After all, he had destroyed the city of the Separate Abyss race all by himself! If they dared to offend him, they might be expelled from Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
They concluded it'd be better to please this seller at the risk of offending the Bearing race. After all, the Ear Mice always aimed to maximize benefits.
<br><br>
Good and evil were just abstract concepts to them, nothing they could be bothered with.
<br><br>
After reaching a unanimous decision, the three headed back to the room, treating Zen in a more friendly manner.
<br><br>
In total, the price of Zen's Other Shore Tokens was estimated to be over sixty million soul pills.
<br><br>
To be honest, Zen was a little disappointed at the number.
<br><br>
So many Other Shore Tokens were only worth sixty million soul pills, which was equivalent to sixty finger-size chunks of soul crystal.
<br><br>
Even though these Other Shore Tokens were useless to him, he was hoping they'd amount to much more than that.
<br><br>
"Fine, you can exchange the soul pills for soul crystal and pay me," Zen said.
<br><br>
"Exchange for soul crystal?"
<br><br>
The three Ear Mice shook their heads in unison.
<br><br>
"Aren't one million soul pills equivalent to one finger-size chunk of soul crystal?" Zen asked, knitting his eyebrows.
<br><br>
One of the Ear Mice laughed squeakily. "The soul crystal is too rare. It is priceless, so we usually don't exchange the soul pills for it."
<br><br>
The soul crystal was extremely scarce on the Other Shore. The super forces needed to support their members, and they didn't have much. Thus, the price of the soul crystal soared, and now, one finger-size chunk of soul crystal could be exchanged for one million soul pills.
<br><br>
But even then, the supply fell short of the demand.
<br><br>
Most races wouldn't be foolish enough to exchange the soul crystal for soul pills.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was not because those Other Shore Tokens were not valuable.
<br><br>
Over sixty million soul pills were a huge amount of money, but soul crystal was just too precious.
<br><br>
At that time, the Separate Abyss race had no choice but to obey Zen's orders. That was why they took out a hundred finger-size chunks of soul crystal.
<br><br>
This time, however, Zen didn't force the Ear Mice to pay him soul crystal.
<br><br>
After all, they were businessmen, not fallen warriors.
<br><br>
Although they were annoying, they could be useful in some situations.
<br><br>
Chapter 3255 Grand Sky Temple Zen put away the soul pills and was just about to leave when one of the Ear Mice politely called out, "Sir, please wait a minute."
<br><br>
Zen stopped and turned around. His gaze landed at the Ear Mouse and he asked, "Yeah, what's up?"
<br><br>
"It's nothing really. But I was wondering if you could tell me something.
<br><br>
What is the relationship between you and that physical body on the Other Shore?" the Ear Mouse asked.
<br><br>
After a thorough investigation of the matter, the Ear Mice seemed much more polite now.
<br><br>
The change in their attitude made Zen realize that they already knew something about his secret. The only thing was, he had never expected that they would ask him about it directly.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, he smiled gently and told them, "I am his spokesperson."
<br><br>
An interesting property of the Other Shore was that nobody could identify anyone with their blurred appearance. This might also be considered an advantage. As long as Zen did not admit it personally, it was almost impossible for others to be sure that he was exactly the person appearing on the Other Shore in physical form.
<br><br>
When Zen had invaded the Bearing race's temple, Dorothy had also been present with him.
<br><br>
Because of that, the Bearing race knew that the temple-destroyer had some connections with the Oneness Sky Palace. However, since the Oneness Sky Palace insisted that the Bearing race were wrong and they had nothing to do with the invasion, there was no way to know. There was no way for the Bearing race to confirm their suspicions.
<br><br>
After leaving the room, Zen circled around the low building.
<br><br>
Dorothy and Jermain were waiting for him at the gate.
<br><br>
"Zen's coming!" Dorothy saw Zen coming from the distance; she waved at him and said, "Come on. The auction has already begun. Let's hurry up!"
<br><br>
Zen nodded and the three of them entered the auction house together.
<br><br>
Coming there felt like coming to a different place altogether.
<br><br>
Compared to the low-lying building behind them, the auction house was built lavishly and reeked of wealth.
<br><br>
Most of the other super forces would only build a small stronghold at Stage Thirteen. In comparison, the Ear Mouse race possessed a large area of land, and that was apparent.
<br><br>
The wide hall had efficient seating arrangements, which had been well thought out, keeping guests of different sizes in consideration. After all, their guests were from various races and would be of various sizes. Some chairs were a few inches tall and some were several feet long.
<br><br>
When they entered the hall, the auction had already been going on for some time.
<br><br>
Inside, an Ear Mouse was zealously introducing a fourth-grade Other Shore Token. It was standing right at the center, and explaining how the token had been obtained from Stage Nine. The base price was set at two hundred thousand soul pills.
<br><br>
But Zen himself had just sold a large number of fourth-grade Other Shore Tokens to the Ear Mice. Therefore, he had no interest in the item on display at the moment.
<br><br>
However, there were quite a few people from various races bidding for the item. A single Other Shore Token might not be of any use to them, but after they had accumulated a large enough amount, they could send them back to their temples at Stage Four.
<br><br>
After several fierce rounds of bidding, the Other Shore Token was finally sold and the next item was brought in.
<br><br>
Following this sale, the Ear Mouse put several more fourth-grade Other Shore Tokens up for auction. Zen and Dorothy kept on watching quietly without any intentions of participating in bidding.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Jermain won a bid for an Other Shore Token from Stage Eleven. But it was obvious that he had not bought the item for his own use.
<br><br>
After a dozen fourth-grade tokens had been sold in a row, the Ear Mouse finally brought out a fifth-grade Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Now this was something valuable. Even Jermain showed high interest in this item. However, it had a very high base price. Ten million soul pills was not something that Jermain could afford, therefore, he had to let go of the idea.
<br><br>
"Jermain, the Ear Mice have put up several fourth-grade and fifth-grade tokens for auction. I want to know if there will be any sixth-grade tokens too," Zen remarked.
<br><br>
Zen didn't know the ranks of the two Other Shore Tokens he had.
<br><br>
He had two Eyes of Will with him. He had originally considered selling the spare one, but now that he didn't lack soul pills, he decided not to do so.
<br><br>
The Eyes of Will were very rare items. Legend had it that only nineteen of those existed in the Dreaded Eye Demon race. The value of an Eye of Will therefore, was quite evident, but their rank still remained unknown to Zen.
<br><br>
His Strength God Totem had been obtained from the Oneness Sky Palace's temple. Zen believed that the Oneness Sky Palace was not inferior to the Bearing race. This meant that they had comparable treasure hordes, which also meant that the Strength God Totem was probably a fourth-grade token.
<br><br>
"Sixth-grade token, you say?"
<br><br>
At the mention of this, Jermain smiled wryly and said, "Very few such tokens were ever discovered in the Lust World. Therefore, it is almost impossible that such a powerful and precious token would be put up for auction. Even if someone wants to sell one, it would be impossible to complete the deal with just soul pills. Sixth-grade tokens are usually exchanged for soul crystal."
<br><br>
Sixth-grade Other Shore Tokens were priceless, and so was the soul crystal.
<br><br>
It was reasonable therefore, that people would exchange one of them for another.
<br><br>
"Ah well. Looks like I am going to have to leave this auction emptyhanded. I don't see anything of interest," Zen said, heaving a sigh.
<br><br>
"Oh? So you didn't bid for anything because you had no interest in any of the items at all?" Jermain asked, somehow astonished. Now this was an interesting turn of events.
<br><br>
Jermain didn't know Zen's other identities. The only thing he knew was that Zen was an excellent disciple of the Flow Sword Sect. Therefore, he had no idea about his wealth or lack thereof. Hence, he thought that Zen did not participate in the auction because he didn't have many soul pills.
<br><br>
Dorothy chuckled, sitting on the other side. She knew that if Zen revealed even a fraction of his whole wealth, he would shock Jermain to the core.
<br><br>
To be frank, if Zen really did put up all of his assets on display, Dorothy herself would be equally shocked. After all, the treasures and the wealth Zen had obtained from the Nine Li race were huge, both in quality and quantity.
<br><br>
"It's not that I completely lack interest in them. But I just did not find anything suitable enough for me," Zen replied modestly.
<br><br>
However, as the auction progressed, Zen did eventually participate and buy several Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
These Other Shore Tokens were of no use to him. However, once Nelly, Lavender, and Laquisha reached the Other Shore Realm, they were going to need these tokens. Midway through the auction, he had come up with the idea of buying a few things for them.
<br><br>
"Ladies and gentlemen, all Other Shore Tokens have been sold now. The last item for today's auction is: the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple!" the Ear Mouse suddenly announced in a louder, excited, and much more grandeur voice.
<br><br>
Zen instantly felt a sudden rise in the interest the bidders were showing in the auction when the Ear Mouse mentioned the Grand Sky Temple. It was obvious that they valued this Other Shore Key very much.
<br><br>
"The Grand Sky Temple... Hey isn't that the temple that Tyquan once explored in the past?" Dorothy suddenly asked.
<br><br>
The explorer Dorothy was referring to was named Tyquan Yuan, an excellent and talented person from the Origin Mountain. He had now surpassed the Lust World and entered the Desire World. Today, he was a legend and was considered one of the best warriors in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
However, the time he was referring to was a long while back. In those days, Tyquan had obtained a sixth-grade Other Shore Token from the Grand Sky Temple. It was from Stage Thirteen and therefore, had guaranteed him powerful strength even in the Desire World.
<br><br>
"Yes! You are right," Jermain replied, equally surprised. "I never expected that the Ear Mice would put the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple up for auction. This might be the grand finale for the auction!"
<br><br>
As soon as the Ear Mouse had finished the introduction, it announced a base price of five million soul pills. The audience were stunned into silence when Dorothy quickly raised her hand and made the first bid, "Eight million soul pills!"
<br><br>
Zen and Jermain both looked at Dorothy, taken aback by her bold bidding.
<br><br>
Jermain audibly gasped. No matter how much interest she had in the Other Shore Key, they thought that such a high bid was a rather impulsive decision.
<br><br>
"Dorothy..."
<br><br>
Jermain tried to remind Dorothy that she shouldn't be so generous, or more accurately, reckless with her wealth.
<br><br>
However, his fears were allayed. "Don't worry. I was bidding on his behalf,"
<br><br>
Dorothy said with a chuckle. "He will be the one paying for it anyway!"
<br><br>
"Hey! Really! That's a great favor!"
<br><br>
Zen sighed in resignation. It was true that he wanted to bid for this Other Shore Key, but such a high bid was obviously unwise. In any case, their discussion was put on hold when, "Sixteen million soul pills."
<br><br>
Another voice rang out in the hall, doubling Dorothy's bid immediately.
<br><br>
Zen and Jermain were stunned into silence. They had witnessed all sorts of auctions, and had seen quite a few where fast and even ultra-fast bidding would take place, but they had never seen someone crazy enough to totally double the price, especially when it was already so high. Who was this guy? Chapter 3256 The Three Huts In The Dark Region Zen was surprised at the offer.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Jermain looked as though he lost the ability to speak.
<br><br>
The Grand Sky Temple was one of the three major temples in Stage Thirteen, and it was the most well-known among them.
<br><br>
If one was fortunate enough to obtain a sixth-grade Other Shore Token from it, they would attain a massive boost in strength in a short period. The increase in power would be so immense that they would immediately become a top disciple in their force.
<br><br>
However, the Grand Sky Temple was not easy to explore. It was full of risks, and sometimes they would end up with nothing.
<br><br>
According to the market price, the value of the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was eight to nine million soul pills. But this man had blatantly blurted out sixteen million soul pills as the bid. There must be some hidden information to this that they might have overlooked.
<br><br>
Just as Jermain was in the middle of processing his thoughts, a creature screamed and raised the price even further.
<br><br>
"Nineteen million soul pills!"
<br><br>
The one who gave this offer was from the Celestial Wolf race. The Celestial Wolf race was not a super force. However, its members were proud owners of massive strength. Due to them existing in a small population, they were not very prominent in the Source World.
<br><br>
Just as the member of the Celestial Wolf race announced the bid, someone from another race raised it up again. "Twenty million soul pills!"
<br><br>
The price was only increased by a million soul pills.
<br><br>
Both Dorothy and Zen were clueless about the market, so they turned to Jermain with questioning eyes as if to ask what to do next.
<br><br>
Since Zen had put in a lot of effort to reach Stage Thirteen, he did not intend to leave empty-handed. Exploring the temples was his first priority.
<br><br>
Jermain waved his hands and said, "The Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple is indeed precious, but it's worth no more than ten million soul pills."
<br><br>
A pheasant-shaped Soul of Light overheard him and sneered in a sharp voice, "You might have been able to buy it with ten million soul pills three days ago. But now things have changed."
<br><br>
Hearing what the "pheasant" said, Jermain suddenly got curious and attempted to inquire more. "Excuse me... Mr. Pheasant..."
<br><br>
In addition to those super forces, there were countless small races in the Source World. He had no idea what race this Soul of Light belonged to, so Jermain addressed it based on its appearance.
<br><br>
However, that "pheasant" felt offended and retaliated as it yelled, "I'm not a pheasant! I am a nine-eyed peacock!"
<br><br>
The voice of the nine-eyed peacock was so sharp that it turned everyone's attention towards the commotion.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse was forced to warn them to keep the decorum of the event.
<br><br>
"Please keep your voices low! No noise in the auction hall!"
<br><br>
Feeling a little flustered, Jermain humbly apologized for offending the nineeyed peacock. "I'm so sorry. Please excuse me for my ignorance."
<br><br>
When dealing with creatures of alien races, he should have been more calculated with his words to not offend them in any way.
<br><br>
The nine-eyed peacock was still grumpy over their last exchange, so it said in a harsh tone, "You wanted to ask about the Grand Sky Temple? The news about it has been circulating for a while now. You really have very little information. Humph!"
<br><br>
"I just entered the Other Shore, so I have no idea. What's going on with the temple?" Jermain asked with his kindest voice.
<br><br>
Although Jermain was reasonably familiar with everything in Stage Thirteen, he was not on the Other Shore recently. He had only returned to welcome Dorothy, which was why he was clueless about what might have happened in the past few days.
<br><br>
"Of course! Everything has changed! They say the back door of the Grand Sky Temple has been opened, which means there is one more path to enter it," the nine-eyed peacock answered in a serious tone.
<br><br>
"What? No way." With a hint of confusion in his eyes, Jermain continued, "As far as I remember, the Grand Sky Temple was against the Dark Region, wasn't it? Does that path lead to the Dark Region?"
<br><br>
For the Souls of Light, the Dark Region was like a restricted area.
<br><br>
The light emitted from them was barely enough to light up the Dark Region. If a Soul of Light accidentally stepped into it, they would get lost into the endless abyss of black space.
<br><br>
"It is a path to the Dark Region. However, this time things are a little different. There is a ray of light in the Dark Region, and it shines from three huts. The huts are visible even from outside the Grand Sky Temple!" the nine-eyed peacock responded with arrogance.
<br><br>
"What? Really?!"
<br><br>
Jermain's pupils dilated visibly at his surprise.
<br><br>
A lot of legends circulated the Other Shore about the Dark Region. It was said that the creatures of the Dark Region were the real rulers of the Other Shore. And that it contained numerous sixth-grade Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Many such legends spread from word of mouth, but none of those were ever confirmed with concrete evidence.
<br><br>
The reason behind less information regarding the Dark Region was simple.
<br><br>
Anyone who entered it with their Soul of Light, never made it out alive to tell the tale.
<br><br>
As a result, many Souls of Light attempted to cultivate different ways to counter the darkness of the Dark Region, such as the special soul fire theurgy.
<br><br>
All the light sources provided by the theurgy were instantly put out by the darkness of the Dark Region. It was as if the fire was being thrown into the water to extinguish it.
<br><br>
Since ancient times, the Dark Region had always been a forbidden area.
<br><br>
But there was finally an exception this time...
<br><br>
Someone inside the Dark Region had managed to light up a ray of light that even went as far as to shine three huts.
<br><br>
What was the source of the light? What was in those huts? All kinds of questions and speculations circulated in the minds of every being on the Other Shore for the past three days.
<br><br>
Every Soul of Light within Stage Thirteen fell into complete excitement from the news.
<br><br>
Anything inside those huts would be of great value.
<br><br>
The news spread like wildfire all across Stage Thirteen. The already expensive Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple became even pricier as a result because of its demand.
<br><br>
"If what you're saying is true, then why did the Ear Mice put the Other Shore Key on auction?" Jermain asked while rubbing his chin curiously.
<br><br>
Dorothy had the same thoughts. She nodded to his question and said, "Yes, if the Grand Sky Temple leads to the Dark Region, the Other Shore Key should be priceless. The Ear Mice are so shrewd. Why do they choose to sell it at such a starting price?"
<br><br>
After the door of the temple was opened by someone who possessed the Other Shore Key, other Souls of Light could enter it too.
<br><br>
But Stage Thirteen was different in how it functioned compared to Stage One.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of Stage One would wait days for someone to open the door for them like a group of beggars.
<br><br>
However, those of Stage Thirteen were much more sensible. Before they would enter the temple, they would pay the door opener with soul pills as a fee instead of freeloading. In this way, they would both benefit, the door opener would earn a profit of soul pills in exchange for their service.
<br><br>
"I don't know either." The nine-eyed peacock shook its head.
<br><br>
It was not just the nine-eyed peacock, but other races present in the auction hall were equally confused.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice could still be trusted in the trade. Since they were willing to auction the Other Shore Key, they were sure to hand it over to the winner if they were willing to pay the price.
<br><br>
Since the opportunity came, many creatures bade their price up one after the other. They doubled the price to scare off potential competitors for the Other Shore Key.
<br><br>
Although the light that shone in the Dark Region revealed itself only three days ago, most races had already found out about it. Hence, the competition for the highest bid was crazy.
<br><br>
While they were immersed in conversation, the price had already been raised to fifty million soul pills! "The price just sky-rocketed! We'd better not join now, we can't afford it,"
<br><br>
Jermain said as he shook his head.
<br><br>
Fifty million soul pills was too high a price even for the Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
Without the contribution of great forces, they would not be able to afford such a huge sum.
<br><br>
If Jermain would have heard the news earlier, he could have asked the Origin Mountain for assistance. But obviously, it was too late to do that now.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen raised his hand and said out loud, "Sixty million soul pills."
<br><br>
"You..."
<br><br>
Jermain's eyes widened after listening to Zen's offer. He almost wanted to cover Zen's mouth.
<br><br>
Did Zen really own such a large sum of soul pills? The auction hall of the Ear Mice had concrete rules. Those who failed to pay what they offered would have to face severe consequences Chapter 3257 Ninety-percent Discount Jermain was exasperated. Meanwhile, Zen seemed calm and relaxed.
<br><br>
The moment he got the first candle, Zen became aware of the Dark Region's existence.
<br><br>
He had always been interested in the Dark Region. Naturally, he wouldn't let go of this opportunity.
<br><br>
"This human friend right here offered sixty million soul pills.
<br><br>
If no one else is willing to bid, the key to the Grand Sky Temple will be his!" said the Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
For some reason, the Ear Mouse spoke more quickly after Zen placed his bid. It was as though it was eager to get the deal done.
<br><br>
This made Jermain more anxious. He was scared that Zen wouldn't be able to afford the sixty million soul pills. And so, he hoped someone else would raise the price.
<br><br>
Just as the Ear Mouse was about to announce that the deal was done, another voice came from the crowd. "Sixty-four million..."
<br><br>
The Soul of Light who raised the price was as tall as a thin tree. It was obviously a member of the Heavenly Pine race in the Source World.
<br><br>
As Jermain heard the voice, he let out a sigh of relief. Now that this guy's bid was higher than Zen's, he need not worry about Zen anymore.
<br><br>
In the meantime, a bunch of Ear Mice in the back stage of the auction house clutched their chests in dismay.
<br><br>
"He is so stupid!"
<br><br>
"Why didn't he just announce the deal was closed? What was he waiting for?"
<br><br>
"I heard that the name of the corporeal body's spokesperson is Zen Luo!"
<br><br>
"Damn the Heavenly Pine race! They ruined our plan!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse seemed a little disappointed as it announced miserably, "This friend of the Heavenly Pine race offers sixty-four million soul pills."
<br><br>
With this, the Heavenly Pine member who offered the price grew angry at the Ear Mouse's reaction. "What's the matter? Do you not want me to bid for the key? Could it be that the soul pills of the human race are more valuable than those of our Heavenly Pine race?"
<br><br>
Zen, Jermain, Dorothy, and the others present all felt like there was something wrong.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse seemed to be desperate to sell the Other Shore key to Zen.
<br><br>
"Zen, please don't bid anymore. How would we afford that amount of soul pills if no one else tops your bid?" Jermain hurriedly warned Zen.
<br><br>
Zen was not planning to bid again. He just looked at the Ear Mouse on stage and smiled. It was not that he didn't want to add more soul pills. He simply wanted to find out what tricks the Ear Mice were playing.
<br><br>
But then, something strange happened.
<br><br>
As Zen didn't bid anymore, the Ear Mouse became silent.
<br><br>
Silence fell over the entire auction house. It was as though they were not here for auction but for tea.
<br><br>
The behavior of the Ear Mouse displeased the member of the Heavenly Pine race even more. "Hey, are you not intending to sell the Other Shore Key?"
<br><br>
"When did we Ear Mice ever go back on our words? Of course, we will sell the Other Shore Key. It's just that I have been presiding over the auction for too long today. I feel a little bit tired..."
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse began to stall for time. It still wouldn't announce that the Other Shore Key was now sold to the member of the Heavenly Pine race.
<br><br>
"Do not stall. I have the soul pills right here. Give me the Other Shore Key! Now!" the member of the Heavenly Pine race demanded angrily.
<br><br>
With that, Zen smiled slightly and said, "I offer sixty-four million and ten thousand soul pills."
<br><br>
This time, he only added ten thousand soul pills to the Heavenly Pine member's bid.
<br><br>
Immediately after he offered his price, the Ear Mouse shouted without thinking twice, "Deal!"
<br><br>
All the creatures off the stage were stunned as they witnessed this.
<br><br>
"What a fraud!"
<br><br>
"Is this even an auction?"
<br><br>
"Why didn't you just sell it to humans directly?"
<br><br>
"Today I finally know how shameless the mice are..."
<br><br>
The nonhuman creatures began talking among themselves.
<br><br>
The member of the Heavenly Pine race became even more furious. He went up the stage and grabbed the Ear Mouse. "You dare play tricks on me!"
<br><br>
However, the Ear Mouse was not afraid of him at all. It squeaked twice before saying, "I wasn't making fun of you. This human friend's bid is indeed higher than yours."
<br><br>
"I already offered a huge price but you waited a long time and refused to announce that the deal was done. But when that guy offered his price, you didn't even wait for anyone else to offer theirs. What if I add one million soul pills?" proposed the member of the Heavenly Pine race.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry but the deal is already done," answered the Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
"Then, I'll add ten million more!" The member of the Heavenly Pine race went all out now.
<br><br>
"Sorry. The credibility of our Ear Mouse race is most important. We can't go back on our words," responded the Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
The member of the Heavenly Pine race felt helpless. This Ear Mouse was determined to give the Other Shore Key to that human and he could do nothing more about it.
<br><br>
Neither the member of the Heavenly Pine race nor the other nonhuman creatures could understand the reason why the Ear Mouse would do this.
<br><br>
"Zen, what the hell have you done? Why did the Ear Mouse insist on selling the Other Shore Key to you?" Jermain asked confusedly.
<br><br>
"It's possible that they want me to enter the Grand Sky Temple," Zen replied with a smile.
<br><br>
"They want you to go to the Grand Sky Temple?" Jermain couldn't believe it at all.
<br><br>
Those who were in Stage Thirteen were the strongest Souls of Light in the Lust World. Anyone who was able to reach this stage was probably not an easygoing person.
<br><br>
Jermain knew that Zen was a talented disciple. However, the latter was still unfamiliar with Stage Thirteen because he had just entered it. The Ear Mice wanted Zen to go to the Grand Sky Temple? Nothing of the sort had ever happened in the world.
<br><br>
"You'll find out in a while. Just wait," Zen said.
<br><br>
"But sixty-four million and ten thousand soul pills?!" Jermain began to worry that Zen might not be able to afford the soul pills.
<br><br>
"No need to worry, Jermain. It's just tens of millions of soul pills. I can still afford it," Zen replied.
<br><br>
Jermain was extremely worried about Zen. On the other hand, it made Zen a little uncomfortable that Jermain cared too much about him. After all, it was not the first time Zen had stepped on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Jermain had no choice but to sit quietly beside Zen.
<br><br>
The auction came to a close after the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was sold.
<br><br>
Although the member of the Heavenly Pine race was very unhappy about how it turned out, all he could do now was leave.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse on the stage walked towards Zen and said, "Sir, you will get the Other Shore Key after you pay the soul pills."
<br><br>
However, Zen suddenly said, "The price of the Other Shore Key is too high."
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse didn't expect to hear Zen say that. So it told him, "Sir, you were the one who bid it."
<br><br>
"How about a ninety-percent discount? I'll pay you six million soul pills and I'll only take one person with me. You can decide the others who can enter the Grand Sky Temple," Zen added.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Jermain thought that Zen must have gone crazy.
<br><br>
He had bought it with more than sixty million soul pills himself. And now he was bargaining for a ninety-percent discount? Jermain thought the Ear Mouse would be enraged.
<br><br>
However, things didn't turn out as Jermain expected. "I can't make the decision for what you just offered. Wait here just a minute," said the Ear Mouse before it turned around and left.
<br><br>
With a bitter smile Jermain said, "I think we'd better get out of here."
<br><br>
Zen didn't pay attention to Jermain. When the Ear Mouse returned, it told Zen, "If you don't need the Other Shore Key and let us keep it, you need not pay any soul pills. We will take you and your companion to the Grand Sky Temple."
<br><br>
"What?!" Jermain exclaimed. He could hardly believe what he heard.
<br><br>
This didn't come as a surprise to Zen, though. He stood up and said, "Thank you for your kindness. I wonder when you plan on going to the Grand Sky Temple."
<br><br>
"We will open the gate to the Grand Sky Temple tomorrow," replied the Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
"Then I'll see you at the gate of the Grand Sky Temple." Zen shrugged and left the auction hall with Dorothy.
<br><br>
Jermain was still following them in amazement. He felt like he had attended a false auction and had no idea what just happened.
<br><br>
Chapter 3258 Journey As Zen and Dorothy left the auction house, Jermain suddenly stood in front of them and blocked their way.
<br><br>
"Zen, do you have something on the Ear Mouse race?" Jermain asked. The young man was truly curious as to why the Ear Mouse had been so kind to Zen.
<br><br>
Although the Ear Mouse race did not give Zen the Other Shore Key, he was given permission to enter the Grand Sky Temple for free and even bring one person along.
<br><br>
This free pass was no simple arrangement. The Ear Mouse race was overly cautious especially given what happened at the Grand Sky Temple recently.
<br><br>
Their set entry fee would be steep and only rose as time went on.
<br><br>
Zen shrugged. "I don't know much about the Ear Mouse race."
<br><br>
"Then...why did they let you enter the Grand Sky Temple for free?" Jermain asked.
<br><br>
"Maybe they need something from me?" Zen answered. He didn't show it on his face but his tone made it obvious that he found the conversation quite dull.
<br><br>
"What would they want from you?" Jermain continued, not willing to back down with his questions.
<br><br>
"I don't know," Zen repeated with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse race's invitation was really directed to Zen's corporeal body.
<br><br>
But he didn't know why they needed his corporeal body. He was telling Jermain the truth.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, he agreed to the invitation and even requested that he be allowed to bring a companion with him.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse race thought that Zen's companion was the corporeal body they so wanted to see, so they allowed it.
<br><br>
They had no idea that Zen was actually going to use his corporeal body to enter the Grand Sky Temple and the companion he would be bringing with him was Dorothy.
<br><br>
This arrangement was rife with misunderstanding, but the results were set to be the same.
<br><br>
Seeing that Zen was truly clueless, Jermain had to back down. He still had one more thing to ask, though. "You can take one more person with you, right? Who are you going to take? If you don't have anyone, can you bring me with you?" he requested.
<br><br>
"I already have a suitable candidate," Zen replied, turning his gaze to Dorothy.
<br><br>
Jermain's brows furrowed. "Is the person you're referring to Dorothy?"
<br><br>
His tone was incredibly serious and before Zen could reply, Dorothy opened her mouth. "Why? Is there a problem? Do you think I'm unsuitable to go to the Grand Sky Temple?"
<br><br>
"Of course you're not suitable!" Jermain exclaimed, not even bothering to hide his opinion. "You've only recently reached Stage Thirteen, so you have no idea just how dangerous this place is! Do you know what their true goal is? It's the Dark Region behind the Grand Sky Temple! The temple isn't even a safe place for you to explore, let alone the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
He had always considered himself as an elder brother to Dorothy. Even if she was the Origin Mountain head's granddaughter, he still did his part in keeping her safe from harm.
<br><br>
However, his protective tendencies proved to be too much for Dorothy right now. "Jermain, don't you think you're meddling too much?"
<br><br>
Her hostile reply made him frown, but Jermain had no intention of giving in. "If you insist on going, then I will have to report this to Uncle Winchell.
<br><br>
I'm sorry, but I won't be able to keep this as a secret."
<br><br>
"Then go! Report it to him!" Dorothy's nature had always been resolute.
<br><br>
Once she made a decision, not even her grandmother would be able to stop her.
<br><br>
Realizing this, Jermain cupped his hands respectfully and withdrew. He was definitely going to report all of this to Winchell.
<br><br>
Once he was gone, Zen turned to Dorothy. "I didn't say I was going to take you with me," he pointed out.
<br><br>
Dorothy smirked. "I am the most suitable candidate," she declared in confidence.
<br><br>
However, Zen shook his head. "It's too dangerous."
<br><br>
The two of them had only explored the Sacred Mallow Temple in Stage One and nearly lost their lives.
<br><br>
Jermain was right. The Grand Sky Temple was very dangerous and the Dark Region even more so. If they weren't careful, they could very well lose their lives.
<br><br>
"You don't have any other choice," Dorothy said with a triumphant smile.
<br><br>
And she was right. There was no way Zen would be able to find a suitable candidate within the day.
<br><br>
He needed to enter the Grand Sky Temple in the form of his corporeal body.
<br><br>
However, that meant he wouldn't be able to store the candles and a few other things. He needed a Soul of Light with him, someone he could trust.
<br><br>
He needed Dorothy.
<br><br>
Zen sighed. He looked at Dorothy and, even if he couldn't see her face clearly, he knew that she was smiling smugly at him right at that moment.
<br><br>
Her company was undoubtedly meaningful. Zen couldn't imagine exploring the Other Shore without her.
<br><br>
When he went to the Sacred Mallow Temple the second time, he had to switch between his body and soul in order to store the soul pills. It was terribly tedious and Dorothy's existence just made everything so much easier.
<br><br>
However, it couldn't be denied that the further they ventured into the Other Shore, the more perilous their journey was set to be. Right now, he felt a bit selfish in dragging her with him to a potentially precarious situation.
<br><br>
Dorothy noticed his misgivings and waved a hand to his vacant face.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?"
<br><br>
Zen pushed her hand away and said seriously, "I will protect you."
<br><br>
Those were the only words he said before turning around and walking away.
<br><br>
Dorothy could only look on at Zen's back in confusion. She didn't really understand what he meant, though she figured he was now alright with her tagging along.
<br><br>
The agreed meeting time between Zen and the Ear Mouse race was tomorrow, but it was worth noting that the Grand Sky Temple was located at the other end of Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
First and foremost, Zen had to send Dorothy to the Grand Sky Temple gate.
<br><br>
Second, he would then have to transport his corporeal body from Stage Twelve to Stage Thirteen. All things considered, they didn't really have a lot of time.
<br><br>
After leaving the living creatures' strongholds, the two of them entered the wilderness.
<br><br>
Stage Thirteen had been eroded on both sides by the Dark Region. There was only one road left that the Souls of Light took, and there was no way they would get lost.
<br><br>
Numerous Souls of Light, all of them quite strange, passed them by. Some were as big as elephants while others were as small as Zen's fist. Almost all of them moved hurriedly.
<br><br>
Like Zen and Dorothy, they too must be headed to the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
The two of them travelled for quite some time. After covering over a hundred miles, Dorothy suddenly pointed southwest. "Zen, look! It's so dark!"
<br><br>
Zen turned and found a huge, black ball in the distance.
<br><br>
It seemed to be devouring the land, casting eternal night on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"That's the Dark Region," Zen remarked as he stared at the absolute darkness.
<br><br>
As they went on, the area shrouded by the Dark Region grew. The road they ventured on was reasonably wide, but they felt great pressure upon them as they walked.
<br><br>
As a kind of experiment, Zen decided to release a bit of his spiritual sense and tried injecting it into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
However, the moment his spiritual sense touched the border, it immediately disappeared. Zen didn't bother doing it a second time.
<br><br>
It took the two of them almost half a day to complete the journey. To their relief though, they soon saw the Grand Sky Temple in the distance.
<br><br>
The temple was located at the very edge of the Dark Region. This put it in danger of being devoured fully by the darkness if it ever decided to expand again, but for now, its unique location made it serve as a passageway to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Dorothy pouted her lips as they approached the Grand Sky Temple. "Why are there so many creatures here?"
<br><br>
"All the Souls of Light we saw on the way were heading towards the temple," Zen said.
<br><br>
True enough, thousands of Souls of Light waited by the gate, densely packed and eager to rush in as soon as the temple opened its gate.
<br><br>
Chapter 3259 Demand An Exorbitant Price Even though the Dark Region was extremely dangerous, the mystery about it made it all the more fascinating.
<br><br>
Since ancient times, no one had ever stepped into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light that had entered Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore were all elite disciples of the younger generation in each race. Perhaps it was their youthful spirit that tempted them to further explore the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, it was rather difficult to enter the Grand Sky Temple, as there was a very limited number of Other Shore Keys. One usually waited several years, or even decades, before the Grand Sky Temple opened.
<br><br>
But there were still some keys despite the small number.
<br><br>
In fact, a few of the creatures possessed the Other Shore Keys to the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
There was news that was spreading rapidly that there was a path from the temple that led to the Dark Region. It was most likely that those who did possess the keys had caught wind of the news by now; it was only a matter of time before someone opened the gate to enter the temple.
<br><br>
All the Souls of Light that gathered at the gate were determined. No matter the cost, they absolutely had to break into the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
It was possible that the one who possessed a key would be willing to let them pass in exchange for soul pills. But it was also likely that they would need to fight for it.
<br><br>
"Did you hear? Just today, the Ear Mouse race auctioned an Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple!" a nonhuman creature among the crowd suddenly announced.
<br><br>
These Souls of Light had been waiting here for a long time now. As soon as they heard that news, they began to whisper amongst themselves excitedly.
<br><br>
"Really? I didn't even know the Ear Mouse race had an Other Shore Key!"
<br><br>
"I've told you so! I told you that they definitely had the key."
<br><br>
"But why would they be stupid enough to sell the key? They could have just charged soul pills as entrance fees; that way, they could've earned so much more!"
<br><br>
Thousands of Souls of Light were present, and each of them had hundreds of thousands of soul pills they were willing to trade to enter the temple.
<br><br>
Moreover, more Souls of Light kept arriving. The Ear Mouse race had always been known to be intelligent. How could they have missed such an opportunity? "I don't know. A member of the Heavenly Pine race offered over sixty million soul pills, but the Ear Mouse race refused. They wanted to sell it to a human."
<br><br>
Many creatures had witnessed what happened at the auction, and felt a bit unsettled at how the events unfolded before them.
<br><br>
"They wanted to sell the key to a human?"
<br><br>
"Hey, when does the human race deserve special attention from the Ear Mouse race?"
<br><br>
The nonhuman creatures laughed.
<br><br>
To them, this all seemed like a petty rumor.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen and Dorothy found a suitable place to wait. "You can leave the Other Shore first," Zen said to her seriously. "There are too many nonhuman creatures here, who knows what might happen."
<br><br>
Zen checked the time. He had about 14 hours left. He had to leave the Other Shore now and re-enter in the form of his body. Fearing for her safety, he didn't want Dorothy to stay on the Other Shore alone.
<br><br>
Dorothy nodded obediently. Just as she was about to leave the Other Shore, Zen suddenly said, "Wait."
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Dorothy asked confusedly.
<br><br>
"Stretch out your hand," Zen ordered.
<br><br>
Without asking for a reason, she immediately obeyed.
<br><br>
"Something may be useful after we enter the temple," Zen answered.
<br><br>
"Activate your space ring."
<br><br>
A square appeared above the palm Dorothy held out. Zen also activated his, and positioned near Dorothy's.
<br><br>
After the two squares connected, Zen stealthily transferred all the candles from his space ring to Dorothy's. Even though the knowledge about the candles wasn't widespread, he still didn't want others to see what he was doing, just in case.
<br><br>
"These are the candles from the bottom of the sea." Dorothy's mouth hung open in shock.
<br><br>
"Shh," Zen shushed her. "They might come in handy in the Dark Region."
<br><br>
"Candles... You mean they might light up the Dark Region?" Dorothy's eyes twinkled with excitement.
<br><br>
No. 9527 had told Zen before that these candles could be useful in the Dark Region, but he hadn't told Dorothy about it.
<br><br>
However, she was a smart girl. It wasn't hard for her to connect the dots.
<br><br>
"It's possible." Zen smiled.
<br><br>
Dorothy's mind whirled at the possibilities. If they could use these candles in the Dark Region, did this mean they could finally explore the forbidden and unknown? Dorothy safely tucked away the candles and then left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen turned to gaze upon the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Realizing he wanted a better vantage point, he headed for higher ground.
<br><br>
Again, he fixed his gaze towards the Grand Sky Temple. Sure enough, he found a little light shining from behind the temple.
<br><br>
"Those are the three small huts in the Dark Region."
<br><br>
Because he was too far away, Zen could only barely make out the faint silhouette of the three small huts.
<br><br>
But it was enough. After confirming the existence of those huts, Zen retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Around four hours later, even more throngs of Souls of Light gathered at the gate of the temple.
<br><br>
"Fuck off! This is the territory of the Separate Abyss race!"
<br><br>
More than a dozen of massive Souls of Light from the Separate Abyss race came to take up the space right in front of the gate.
<br><br>
Having shoved away all the other Souls of Light, the Separate Abyss race planned to enter the temple first, if someone were to open the gate.
<br><br>
"So what? The Separate Abyss race might be invincible in Stage Eleven, but we're in Stage Thirteen. Just who do you think you are?" Several nonhuman creatures clamored in protest.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race had always exhibited a superiority complex over other races. As a result, they had offended many super forces in the past.
<br><br>
In Stage Eleven, the other super forces didn't dare to fight against the Separate Abyss race; it was widely known that Stage Eleven was their territory. But things were different in Stage Thirteen. Everyone's soul was roughly on the same cultivation level. If the other races worked together to attack the Separate Abyss race, they wouldn't stand a chance.
<br><br>
"You dare provoke us?" shouted a member of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
"We are not afraid of you. Are you challenging us to a fight? Right here, right now?"
<br><br>
Just as the Souls of Light were about to strike each other angrily, a nearby Ear Mouse cleared its throat. "If anyone fights here, they will instantly be disqualified from entering the Grand Sky Temple."
<br><br>
If it were a creature from any other race, no one would have paid it heed.
<br><br>
But it was an Ear Mouse, and the race was known to be credible sources.
<br><br>
After all, they were the ones who possessed the Other Shore Key.
<br><br>
Immediately, the Souls of Light backed off quietly.
<br><br>
"Mouse, do you really have the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple?" the member of the Separate Abyss race asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, we do," the Ear Mouse said nonchalantly.
<br><br>
Upon hearing the answer, the rest of the Souls of Light cheered. Entering the Grand Sky Temple seemed so possible now.
<br><br>
"Why don't you open the gate to the Grand Sky Temple now?" urged the member of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
"It's not the time yet," the Ear Mouse squeaked. "We still have to wait a few hours. We are waiting for an important guest."
<br><br>
"What important guest?"
<br><br>
"Quit wasting our time! Just open the gate!"
<br><br>
"Perhaps the light in the Dark Region would vanish soon."
<br><br>
The nonhuman creatures at present tried to convince the Ear Mouse to open the gate to the temple.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse said unhurriedly, "If you want to enter the temple, you have to follow our rules. We won't open the gate until our important guest comes." With a sly smile, he continued, "You'd better pay the soul pills first to share the cost of the Other Shore Key."
<br><br>
"How many soul pills does it cost?" a nonhuman creature asked eagerly.
<br><br>
"One million soul pills per Soul of Light," the Ear Mouse announced with a flourish.
<br><br>
Instantly, the faces of the creatures that had gathered there fell.
<br><br>
There were probably around two thousand Souls of Light gathered.
<br><br>
If each Soul of Light needed to pay a million soul pills, it'd amount to roughly two billion in total! How could this be? The price of the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was usually only a few million.
<br><br>
This was way too expensive! Chapter 3260 All Sorts Of Races While the ultimate goal of the Ear Mouse race wasn't to earn money, they couldn't pass this opportunity to earn a large sum of soul pills.
<br><br>
They were well aware of how the elite disciples from all races were eager to explore the three huts in the Dark Region. Truly, it was quite a big price to pay, but all the creatures present had no choice.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was just too elusive. Not knowing when the temple would open again, they were willing to pay a hefty sum just to enter the gate.
<br><br>
"The Ear Mice are too greedy!" complained a member of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse remained calm. "I'm afraid out of everyone here, you are in the worst position to call us greedy."
<br><br>
The complainant was taken aback. But it was true; the past years, the Separate Abyss race had controlled Stage Eleven. Whoever wanted to reach Stage Twelve needed to pay a large sum of soul pills to the Separate Abyss race. No one knew how many soul pills they had accumulated all these years. This was practically robbery! The Ear Mouse just shrugged. It knew its race was just conducting business.
<br><br>
"Before opening the gate, we'll set a restraining force in front of the Grand Sky Temple. Everyone can use soul pills to exchange for a soul mark.
<br><br>
Those with soul marks can go through the restraining force," the Ear Mouse announced.
<br><br>
Although the Souls of Light were extremely dissatisfied, they knew they had no other choice.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race all seethed with rage. Ultimately, however, they ended up paying their entry in soul pills and each obtained a soul mark.
<br><br>
The rest of the Souls of Light who could afford it also paid the price and received their soul marks.
<br><br>
Those who couldn't afford it all looked gloomy. They had only brought 200, 000 to 300, 000 soul pills, which would've been more than enough according to the normal market price. They didn't expect the Ear Mouse race would skyrocket its price.
<br><br>
Others left the Other Shore to ask for help from the members of their race.
<br><br>
The opportunity to enter the Grand Sky Temple was just too great, they couldn't bear to let it pass.
<br><br>
At a corner of the gathered souls stood six Souls of Light from the human race.
<br><br>
The girl at the leftmost was the most petite. Judging from her silhouette, she was obviously a young lady.
<br><br>
"Brother, we may not be able to get in the temple," the human girl said in disappointment.
<br><br>
"A million soul pills per Soul of Light?! We would have to pay six million! These damned mice!" the tallest of the six said through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
"We must think of a way to raise some soul pills!" another man suggested optimistically.
<br><br>
"How in the world will we raise enough soul pills?" the young girl pouted.
<br><br>
"I still owe someone 200, 000 soul pills."
<br><br>
She was the same girl who had been detained by the Separate Abyss race in Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
Even though Dorothy had been quite generous and told her that she didn't need to pay her back, the young girl still felt indebted to her.
<br><br>
Another person mocked her, "You owe someone 200, 000 soul pills by passing through Stage Eleven? Well done!"
<br><br>
The human girl frowned. She was obviously displeased. "What choice did I have in that situation?"
<br><br>
"Enough! Quit arguing." The tallest of the six put a stop to their meaningless quarrel. "I'm going to raise enough soul pills for all of us. You stay here and wait. Although our Nine Li race was destroyed, I don't believe that will stop us from raising six million soul pills."
<br><br>
Obviously, this man was the leader among the six. As soon as he spoke, the others fell silent. He could tell, however, that his speech didn't boost his peers' morale.
<br><br>
Of course, raising six million soul pills would be no easy task. While their race had once been one of the four major human forces, now they were quite desolate.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, by the gate of the Grand Sky Temple, a line of Souls of Light had formed. Each paid their entry fee and obtained their soul mark.
<br><br>
A few hours passed. By this time, even more races had gathered around the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
"Get out of the way!"
<br><br>
Nine Souls of Light trudged straight to the gate.
<br><br>
From the torso upwards, they were human, but their lower bodies terminated in snake tails.
<br><br>
"The Snake Goddess race!"
<br><br>
"Damn, the Snake Goddess race is here as well."
<br><br>
While they were normal humans in the Source World, on the Other Shore, their Souls of Light were half human, half snake. This made it easy for them to be distinguished among the other Souls of Light.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess race was an esteemed super force in the Source World.
<br><br>
It was said that the Other Shore was prosperous thanks to that race.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess race had always been known to be peaceful and non-aggressive. They were seldom in conflict with other races.
<br><br>
After learning the price of the entrance fee, they nonchalantly paid the soul pills, each earning their soul mark. Then, they retreated to the side of the gate.
<br><br>
The super powers were making their way here, one after another. Another powerful race made their way to the front.
<br><br>
"The Bearing race?"
<br><br>
"Wow, there are quite a few members from the Bearing race."
<br><br>
"They'll need to take out tens of millions of soul pills. Ha-ha..."
<br><br>
More than twenty people from the Bearing race showed up, causing a stir among the other creatures.
<br><br>
Technically, all the races would compete against each other in the Grand Sky Temple. With so many members of the Bearing race present, they obviously had an advantage over the other races.
<br><br>
Many more races arrived. At this point, another group of eight reached the gate.
<br><br>
"They are from the Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace doesn't seem to have much confidence. They only sent eight people."
<br><br>
"Now that the Oneness Sky Palace is being bullied by the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race, it must be difficult for them to compete."
<br><br>
Among the eight figures, their leader overheard the whispers amongst the other creatures.
<br><br>
Her expression darkened. In an indifferent tone, she said loudly, "The Oneness Sky Palace is being bullied by the Bearing race? Not long ago, a certain race's temple was destroyed. I wonder which race that was."
<br><br>
The news that Zen had completely demolished the Bearing race's temple wasn't that widespread, since the Bearing race went through great lengths to keep it hush. However, this didn't stop the members of the Bearing race from frowning at her words.
<br><br>
The other races just shrugged, puzzled. After all, they didn't really understand what had really happened.
<br><br>
"Humph! If it weren't for the help of that mysterious man, all of your elite disciples would've died!"
<br><br>
"That's right. You are just a group of nobodies.
<br><br>
We will destroy you one day!"
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race began to taunt in defense.
<br><br>
The woman from the Oneness Sky Palace fumed. She wasn't good at retorting, so she just threatened, "Humph! Do you want to die?"
<br><br>
Buzz! As she channeled her soul force, golden patterns began to appear around her Soul of Light.
<br><br>
"The divine flames of the Sun Crow race?"
<br><br>
"How could this Oneness Sky Palace member use the divine flames of the Sun Crow race?"
<br><br>
"Weird. Are these people from the Oneness Sky Palace or not?"
<br><br>
From a distance, members of the Sun Crow race flapped their wings in confusion, discussing amongst themselves in low voices at the sight of the golden flames.
<br><br>
"It is her!"
<br><br>
"It is said that only two people in the Oneness Sky Palace have the blood of the Sun Crow race."
<br><br>
"The mother couldn't possibly be in the Lust World, so this must be the daughter."
<br><br>
The conflict between the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace had been going on for quite some time now. They were quickly able to perceive that the woman wielding their divine flames was Elvinia.
<br><br>
In the Source World, there were various bloodline theurgies. Some of them could be used on the Other Shore, and the divine flame of the Sun Crow race was one of them. Although using the divine flames by one's Soul of Light on the Other Shore was different from using it in the Source World and its power could be diminished, it was also an extremely powerful bloodline theurgy.
<br><br>
But the Oneness Sky Palace was still outnumbered, eight to twenty. So the Bearing race just threw their heads back and laughed.
<br><br>
"Hey, little girl, do you really want to fight all of us?"
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace disciples truly are so stupid. How dare you be so arrogant!"
<br><br>
"You must be courting death, young lady!"
<br><br>
The people from the Bearing race sneered at Elvinia and her companions.
<br><br>
Other races had gathered around the commotion. The Sun Crow race, as well as the Divine Farmer race, all thought Elvinia was simply bluffing.
<br><br>
Little did they know, she never bluffed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3261 A Threat "Princess Elvinia!"
<br><br>
"Let's not argue with them!"
<br><br>
There was a chorus of pleas from the people surrounding Elvinia. They could feel her rage, and sought valiantly to calm her down.
<br><br>
They were familiar with how stubborn Elvinia could be.
<br><br>
But to fight the Bearing race here and now was reckless. She was asking for trouble! But the pleas of Elvinia's companions fell on deaf ears.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Elvinia launched an attack. The golden light on the surface of her soul shimmered and trembled, and instantly, the divine flames of the Sun Crow race lashed forward like a golden whip.
<br><br>
The energy struck out at the two members of the Bearing race who stood nearest to Elvinia.
<br><br>
They were struck forcefully by the golden whip, a crackle of energy sounding as it hit them.
<br><br>
A bright golden light spread outward across their souls from the point of impact.
<br><br>
If not taking measures, their souls would be completely burnt to ashes by the golden light.
<br><br>
"Bitch!"
<br><br>
"How dare she!"
<br><br>
Feeling the burning in their souls from the divine flames of the Sun Crow race, the two persons who had been struck withdrew in a hurry from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Anger rose up in the soul auras of the other members of the Bearing race, and they rushed towards Elvinia, intent on avenging their comrades.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, we'd better leave the Other Shore now!"
<br><br>
"They outnumber us. I'm afraid we're no match for them!"
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, please withdraw from the Other Shore now!"
<br><br>
The people around Elvinia clamored to leave immediately, pale with fear.
<br><br>
None dared to voice their thoughts, but inwardly they were not pleased with her. Over the years Elvinia had always gotten them into trouble every time they accompanied her to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
These guards were elite members of the Oneness Sky Palace. As such, they were quite strong enough to deal with the forces of small races. The problem now was that they were severely overwhelmed by the sheer number of the people from the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Elvinia ignored them.
<br><br>
There was a sharp, buzzing sound.
<br><br>
Elvinia's body suddenly sent out tendrils of golden light, soaring high into the air as the divine flames of the Sun Crow race turned into twelve whips all lashing forward.
<br><br>
It was a bold, powerful move. However, these Souls of Light at Stage Thirteen wouldn't be defeated so easily.
<br><br>
The Bearing race had already lost two of their members from the Other Shore because of Elvinia's first attack, so they were more prepared for this one.
<br><br>
As the twelve whips swooped and slashed through the air, the members of the Bearing race jumped back from the golden strands, evading Elvinia's attack.
<br><br>
None of those in her line of sight could get close to her. They were focused entirely on defending themselves.
<br><br>
But while the members of the Bearing race in front of Elvinia captured her whole attention, their companions flanked Elvinia, slowly surrounding her on both sides.
<br><br>
The several men with Elvinia quickly stood with their backs to her, forming a protective circle around her. They activated their soul theurgies to prevent the Bearing race from coming closer to Elvinia.
<br><br>
Despite this defensive stance, the people from the Bearing race still had the upper hand.
<br><br>
On the sidelines, the members of the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race watched Elvinia's struggles coldly.
<br><br>
The several guards with Elvinia soon realized that they couldn't defend her for too long. As the Bearing race pressed closer and closer, they began edging away from Elvinia. There was no choice but to retreat.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, we can't hold them any longer. You must retreat now from the Other Shore!"
<br><br>
Elvinia, at this point, was entirely surrounded, and her companions couldn't protect her any more. If she didn't leave the Other Shore right this instant, she was doomed.
<br><br>
But Elvinia was entirely focused on her attack, and didn't seem to hear what she was being told. The golden whips were becoming more and more ferocious. The members of the Bearing race who bore the brunt of the whips were getting weary as they dodged, fearful of slipping up and getting hit by the bright golden energy of the divine flames.
<br><br>
While Elvinia concentrated on manipulating the whips, someone came up behind her. He had a small snake wrapped around his hand. When he was near enough, he shook the little snake lightly, and it formed a circle and shot towards Elvinia's body.
<br><br>
Too late, Elvinia noticed the movements behind her, and she turned around.
<br><br>
Seeing the snake, her face changed.
<br><br>
Instantly, she realized her danger and decided to use the Illusion Breaking Rune to escape the Other Shore.
<br><br>
She recited the spell, and her body blurred. The man who had thrown the snake quickly stepped forward, shaking his hand once more, and a blue thread was released. The Soul Binding Thread rose and floated over Elvinia's body.
<br><br>
Her spell failed. She couldn't leave when she was held by the Soul Binding Thread.
<br><br>
The little snake hissed and moved, enclosing her in the trap completely.
<br><br>
Elvinia was stunned as her soul force froze. She couldn't launch any further attacks. The golden light faded as the divine flames were extinguished.
<br><br>
The man who had defeated her was named Haider. Seeing her predicament, he sneered, "I can't tell if you are very brave, very foolish, or perhaps both! How dare you pick a fight with us when you are so obviously outnumbered?"
<br><br>
"What a hot-tempered woman! I like her spirit!"
<br><br>
"Look, she's still trying to escape Haider's Dragon Snake Trap! She's crazy!"
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race jeered and laughed at Elvinia as she struggled desperately to break loose. But the longer the little snake held her, the more her soul force weakened. She was utterly unable to escape from the trap.
<br><br>
Haider motioned with his hand, tugging at the snake, and Elvinia was dragged to his side. He lifted her up easily.
<br><br>
Elvinia's guards had also been surrounded by members of the Bearing race, but they shouted loudly when they saw Elvinia tied and lifted.
<br><br>
"Let go of Princess Elvinia!"
<br><br>
"Don't you know who she is? How dare you treat her this way!"
<br><br>
Haider glanced at them and then smirked at Elvinia. She glared at him.
<br><br>
"Let go of me right now, or you will regret it!" Elvinia threatened.
<br><br>
But the people of the Bearing race were not afraid of the Oneness Sky Palace at all, especially Haider, for even among his own people he was powerful, and he held a high position in the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Thus, Haider merely snorted at Elvinia's outburst. "You hold some sort of unusual position at the Oneness Sky Palace, don't you? Seems like you're an important person. How unfortunate that you met me. If someone else had caught you, you might have a better chance of succeeding with your threats."
<br><br>
Before Elvinia could reply, he tossed her in the air, and caught her again, chuckling to himself.
<br><br>
He moved to hand her over to one of the other members of the Bearing race. "Take her to our stronghold. Let the Oneness Sky Palace know that we will return her in exchange for soul pills. Then our costs today will be offset," Haider instructed. He chuckled again, imagining the reaction of the leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace to his demands.
<br><br>
Elvinia's face was flushed. She had never been humiliated like this before.
<br><br>
Held in the Dragon Snake Trap, she closed her eyes, focusing on amassing her remaining strength. Faint golden lights flickered on the surface of her soul.
<br><br>
But each flash and flicker of the golden light was absorbed by the snake, leaving no trace behind. The Dragon Snake Trap was too powerful for her.
<br><br>
She had no chance of escaping.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race were about to take Elvinia away when over a dozen people suddenly rushed towards them.
<br><br>
"Wait!" someone shouted.
<br><br>
The newcomers ran up to the Bearing race, blocking their way.
<br><br>
They were from the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace did not always act in unison. For instance, after hearing about the Grand Sky Temple, Elvinia had taken a few of the elite members of the Phoenix Palace and gone alone to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Other mountains, like the Bright Mountain, had also heard the news. Chaim from the Bright Mountain quickly organized his own group and led them to the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Chaim was the man who had shouted. He and his companions had been astonished to reach the Grand Sky Temple and witness Elvinia being carried away by the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Against outsiders, the people of the seven different mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace always presented a united front. Moreover, Elvinia held a unique and important position, so Chaim was duty-bound to try and stop the Bearing race from abducting her.
<br><br>
"Ah, more people from the Oneness Sky Palace, I see," said Haider in a bored voice. He was clearly not afraid of the newcomers.
<br><br>
Chaim let the others block the way of those who had Elvinia. Correctly identifying Haider as the leader of the Bearing race contingent, Chaim walked up to him and said, "Sir, Princess Elvinia is the favorite daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. You are inviting trouble by trying to take her away like this."
<br><br>
That caught Haider's interest. But his arrogant expression remained.
<br><br>
Sneering, he said, "So that's the reason everyone says she's important. I have miscalculated. If she's the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, then I should ask for an even greater ransom!"
<br><br>
Haider had been born into one of the most influential clans in the Bearing race, and was himself a relative of Yellow Thearch. He was completely unimpressed by Elvinia's status as Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter.
<br><br>
"Don't you think it's a shame for the Bearing race to kidnap Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter for ransom?" Chaim asked.
<br><br>
Haider's face turned cold. "Don't you think it's wrong for this girl to provoke us, start a fight, and almost kill two of us? You should be glad her only punishment is to be held for ransom. She will not be harmed. And if you doubt my story, there are people here from races apart from the Bearing race who witnessed the whole thing."
<br><br>
Chaim paused. He did agree that Elvinia was in the wrong. It would not work to try and make Haider feel guilty or ashamed. Being a clever man, Chaim quickly switched tactics.
<br><br>
"So you are definitely not going to let her go?" Chaim asked.
<br><br>
"She stays with us," said Haider, in a tone that brooked no argument.
<br><br>
Chaim tilted his head, giving him a thoughtful look. "Like everyone else here, you came for the Grand Sky Temple, didn't you? Wouldn't it be prudent to make sure no one gets in your way after the gate to the temple is opened? After all, your ultimate goal here is the Grand Sky Temple. If we try to make things difficult for you, it would put a wrench in your plans. Don't you agree?"
<br><br>
This time, Chaim's veiled threat worked. Haider's face darkened, and his aura became ice cold.
<br><br>
Chapter 3262 The Soul Fighting Skill Chaim was smart. He knew that the Bearing race was more powerful and that the people from the Oneness Sky Palace were no match for them.
<br><br>
If a conflict erupted with the Bearing race now, the other races that followed the Bearing race wouldn't stand by idly.
<br><br>
But after they entered the Grand Sky Temple, the situation would change.
<br><br>
Considering the many dangers and risks in the temple, it would be difficult for the Bearing race to deal with the people from the Oneness Sky Palace if they made trouble.
<br><br>
Chaim's threat left Haider quite restless.
<br><br>
He clenched his fists and said, "It seems that it's necessary to kill all of you here now."
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The soul auras of all members of the Bearing race rose in an instant. The tension was so thick, and people were so on edge that even the smallest offense would spark a big fight here.
<br><br>
Unlike the others, Chaim was not nervous at all. Instead, he grinned and said, "So the mission of exploring the Grand Sky Temple isn't important to you. Our Oneness Sky Palace may not be your equal, but we can still kill at least half your people. Do you want to take that risk?"
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace standing behind Chaim were on the alert as well. They were prepared to make a move as soon as Chaim gave them the signal.
<br><br>
Haider hesitated when he heard Chaim's statement.
<br><br>
Their goal was the Dark Region.
<br><br>
It was not wise to fight with the Oneness Sky Palace now. If too many members of the Bearing race were killed, Haider would be responsible for the loss.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice, who were the gatekeepers, observed from the sidelines all this while.
<br><br>
They didn't care about the life or death of humans. They thought it was better for the Bearing race to die since they had paid the soul pills.
<br><br>
After brief contemplation, a smile appeared on Haider's face. He then shouted, "Members of the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race, please help me kill this group of disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace!"
<br><br>
The three races had been on the fence during this discussion between Chaim and Haider. After hearing Haider's call, they stood, one after another.
<br><br>
The number of people on Haider's side was about a hundred. In Stage Thirteen, except for a small part of the Indigo Souls that had some special innate theurgies, the strength gap between them was not too big. Now that Haider had an overwhelming advantage, the strength of the people from the Oneness Sky Palace was insufficient to defeat them.
<br><br>
A bitter smile appeared on Chaim's face when he saw the other large races support Haider. It seemed that they could not avoid trouble, no matter what logic Chaim presented Haider with.
<br><br>
"Chaim, what should we do?"
<br><br>
"Should we run?"
<br><br>
"But we can't abandon Princess Elvinia."
<br><br>
If they fled and left Elvinia behind, they would become the joke of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Chaim didn't have much time to figure out their next move. The Bearing race, as well as the other races, was already rushing toward them! With no other alternative left but to fight, Chaim stretched his hands. In an instant, his arms separated from his Soul of Light and transformed into eight purple long swords.
<br><br>
"I will stop them. Go rescue Princess Elvinia," Chaim instructed.
<br><br>
He had observed the situation while talking to Haider. Now that the battle had begun, he could implement his plan.
<br><br>
The other members of the Bearing race, who held Elvinia captive, were on the other side. If they decided to move Elvinia, they would be at a disadvantage, which the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace could exploit to defeat them.
<br><br>
"But..." someone hesitated.
<br><br>
"Don't worry. I won't die!"
<br><br>
Chaim was quite confident.
<br><br>
As Chaim was one of the top three disciples at the Oneness Sky Palace, excluding the Land of Sword Grief, he was as well-known as Elvinia and Efrain. He also had the ability of Instant Enlightenment, and his soul was even more powerful than Efrain's.
<br><br>
Buzz! The eight purple soul swords shot forward like dragons, and Chaim began to retreat quickly.
<br><br>
He was not only powerful but also experienced.
<br><br>
The Other Shore was a special place. He knew he could leave as long as the Soul Binding Thread did not block him.
<br><br>
He chose to distance himself from the other party from the very beginning to ensure his safety.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The eight soul swords flew in all directions and formed a sword curtain that blocked Haider and his group for a while.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace rushed toward Elvinia.
<br><br>
As those who held Elvinia captive were unable to deal with the situation, they left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"You have a lot of dirty tricks!"
<br><br>
Haider was furious when he saw that Chaim's cooperation with the disciples resulted in Elvinia's release.
<br><br>
He shook his fingers lightly, and several little snakes flew out. These little snakes were purple-black, and their mouths were wide open. Their ghastly fangs promised an agonized death to anyone who had the misfortune of being bitten.
<br><br>
As Chaim's arms had transformed into eight soul swords, he could not stop these little snakes.
<br><br>
He kept backing away, but the little snakes shot straight at him even faster! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Those little snakes caught up with Chaim and then entered his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
"Is he trapped?" Haider was delighted.
<br><br>
Just then, Chaim's Soul of Light blurred. As he had left the Other Shore unexpectedly, those little snakes only collided with his shadow.
<br><br>
After Chaim left, the eight soul swords disappeared as well.
<br><br>
Haider was furious as Chaim had cheated him again. Although anger coursed through him, Haider could not seek revenge as Chaim had left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Kill the other disciples! And if they escape, kill the woman!" Haider shouted.
<br><br>
It was not easy to break free from the Dragon Snake Trap that he had set.
<br><br>
While the disciples could leave the Other Shore, Elvinia could not.
<br><br>
Elvinia, who was still tied up, was shocked. Did the Bearing race really dare to kill her? After Haider gave the order, however, Chaim returned to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"It's not a dirty trick. It's a soul fighting skill." His cynical tone enraged Haider further.
<br><br>
"Screw you!" Haider wanted to tear Chaim apart.
<br><br>
"The first rule of the soul fighting skill is that once a soul leaves the Other Shore, the soul fragments will also disappear. However, if the soul returns in a short time, the soul fragments will not integrate with it. Instead, they will reappear at the same place from where they disappeared earlier,"
<br><br>
explained Chaim with a smile.
<br><br>
At his words, the soul swords that had disappeared with his exit reappeared.
<br><br>
The people of the Bearing race had left their earlier positions to carry out Haider's order. Now, the soul swords were flying toward them from behind.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Unable to defend themselves, the Souls of Light of several members of the Bearing race were pierced by the swords.
<br><br>
A long sword cut Haider as well. He screamed as his Soul of Light emitted a burning pain.
<br><br>
Although this kind of attack was not fatal, it had a significant impact on their Souls of Light.
<br><br>
The other races that witnessed this battle from a safe distance, marveled at Chaim's superb abilities and his knowledge of the rules of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was truly worth their respect.
<br><br>
Chapter 3263 Failure "The guy from the Oneness Sky Palace is so powerful..."
<br><br>
"He single-handedly dealt with a group of warriors from the Bearing race!"
<br><br>
"If I were him, I probably would run away."
<br><br>
The warriors from other races discussed among themselves while stealing glances at the scene.
<br><br>
The nine members of the Snake Goddess race stood quietly observing from afar.
<br><br>
"The Bearing race are trying to kill the members of the Oneness Sky Palace, should we make a move?" A clear voice reverberated in the ears of the other members.
<br><br>
"No... Don't forget our purpose," another woman said while shaking her head in disapproval.
<br><br>
If the Source World was divided into three large groups, the Snake Goddess race and the Oneness Sky Palace belonged to the same one. However, the alliance between them wasn't out in the open yet. The Snake Goddess race preferred not to cause too much trouble, so they chose to stand by and watch.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Chaim continued his attempts to retreat.
<br><br>
After he successfully launched a sneak attack, the eight swords under his manipulation were scattered in all directions after breaking down in many pieces. At the same time, some of those pieces bore the weight of Chaim, retreating from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Damn it! He did it again!"
<br><br>
"Keep your eyes on the pieces!"
<br><br>
"What if he returns to the Other Shore? The pieces are hard to deal with!"
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race felt helpless and gnashed their teeth in frustration.
<br><br>
This time, Chaim had broken down the eight swords and spread them around the area.
<br><br>
If the Bearing race wished to go after him, they would have to be on a constant lookout for the location of those pieces at any given moment. This way, the warriors would be restricted from moving at will.
<br><br>
"Nobody has ever dared to fool me like this!"
<br><br>
From Haider's point of view, Chaim's attacks were equivalent to cheap little tricks.
<br><br>
He completely disregarded the debris lying around and charged towards the direction where Chaim had left.
<br><br>
Haider stretched out his hand while in pursuit. A sharp streak of purple flashed in his hand. Shortly after, a thin blade appeared as he clenched it tightly.
<br><br>
He wanted to wait here for Chaim to return to the Other Shore so he could kill him! The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace escaped with Elvinia under their protection. The other races kept a close watch on the movements of the Bearing race. While the rest of the disciples from the Bearing race stood in place, Haider waited in silence with full attention.
<br><br>
Three seconds passed...
<br><br>
Nine seconds...
<br><br>
Thirty seconds...
<br><br>
"Come out! You bastard!"
<br><br>
Haider shouted on top of his lungs in frustration, his veins protruding from his neck.
<br><br>
It was slowly becoming apparent that Chaim might not return to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Oneness Sky Palace...
<br><br>
On a distinct mountain somewhere, Chaim sat in the center of a hall with his legs crossed. He let his long luscious hair hang loosely over his back.
<br><br>
His mustache was rugged and uneven, covering most of his face, and his robe was covered in filth, giving him an overall messy appearance.
<br><br>
He seemed to be in a pleasant mood as he smiled to himself softly.
<br><br>
The man beside Chaim slowly opened his eyes suddenly.
<br><br>
"Is he still there?" Chaim inquired.
<br><br>
The man shrugged and answered, "Yes. Don't go back in there now. He is yelling like some crazy man. I'm afraid, if you get in right away, he'll kill you."
<br><br>
"Alright then, I'll stay here and wait for your news." Chaim patted on the man's shoulder. The man nodded and closed his eyes to focus. Aura of the Truth of Godly Way began to spread out from his body, and then he returned to the Other Shore to investigate the scene.
<br><br>
The same method had a miraculous effect for the first time, but if used a second time, the result might be bad. Although Haider was reckless, he was not a fool. He was well aware of the fact that Chaim would not return to the Other Shore so soon.
<br><br>
Chaim had asked the man to hide himself in the crowd before the conflict broke out. The Bearing race wouldn't know he was a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The man made several rounds in and out of the Other Shore to spy on the situation. Even though his movements were suspicious, no one would direct their attention to him.
<br><br>
Finally, realizing it was useless to just stand and wait there, Haider decided to make his move.
<br><br>
"What are you doing here? Go and get that woman back for me!"
<br><br>
With a roar, Haider began to chase after the disciples. He turned all his focus towards capturing Elvinia. As long as he caught her, any tricks Chaim was planning on playing with them would be rendered meaningless.
<br><br>
When the other members of the Bearing race were convinced Chaim would not be returning so soon, they activated their soul force and followed closely behind Haider.
<br><br>
Just as Haider left to go after Elvinia, the man left the Other Shore once more.
<br><br>
After the man gave Chaim the news, he immediately set out to return to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Just as he entered, the broken swords' pieces also emerged one by one.
<br><br>
"Phew! Phew! Phew..."
<br><br>
Once again, all the bits made their way to attack the Souls of Light of the members of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
However, they were not going to be fooled by the same trick twice. They were prepared this time. As a result, Chaim's attacks fell short of being effective. Only three warriors were harmed, and the damage caused by the debris was not severe.
<br><br>
The attacks caused Haider to stop in his tracks. He heaved a sigh of relief as turning around. "You're smart, but not enough. As long as your weakness is out in the open, you will never be able to turn the tables."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Chaim asked, suddenly baffled by the calmness in Haider's voice. Yet, Chaim remained focused and restored the broken swords.
<br><br>
"Let me see how you manage to get out of the Other Shore this time."
<br><br>
Haider gloated as a smirk appeared on his face. His demeanor gave off the impression as if Chaim had walked right into a carefully constructed trap like a sacrificial lamb.
<br><br>
"Look at his feet!"
<br><br>
"Haider has set up the Soul Binding Thread on his feet!"
<br><br>
"It appears his luck has run out."
<br><br>
Overhearing the discussion of the other races, Chaim lowered his gaze to his feet subconsciously.
<br><br>
There was a Soul Binding Thread wrapped around his feet to restrict his movements. Just as he returned to the Other Shore, the Soul Binding Thread was bound to his feet.
<br><br>
A weak smile appeared on Chaim's face. It seemed the man he had sent to check on the situation had left this detail out of his report. 'That boy still has a ways to go yet...' Chaim shook his head in visible disappointment.
<br><br>
Of course, Haider wouldn't allow Chaim enough time to think of a strategy or counterattack. After he walked a few steps slowly, he leaped up in the air and dashed towards Chaim with an intent to kill, while the members of the Bearing race followed close behind.
<br><br>
As for the members from the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race, although they didn't make a move, they were still blocking Chaim from behind with their murderous eyes.
<br><br>
Chaim had nowhere to go now, and he was unable to retreat from the Other Shore. He was like an insect, trapped in a spider's web, counting the time before death consumed him.
<br><br>
Even in the face of such an intense situation, he kept himself composed.
<br><br>
Tenacious as he was, he refused to give up. The eight long swords flew around him and vigorously fought back a fraction of the Bearing race members.
<br><br>
However, Haider moved past all the long swords and swiftly made his way to strike Chaim with his slender blade.
<br><br>
Chaim's hands were occupied as they'd changed into swords. Without his arms, how could he be able to fight off someone as powerful as Haider? He could only use his feet to dodge and retreat.
<br><br>
Observing his movements, Haider finally caught up to him and used the opportunity. The thin blade in his hand suddenly emitted a blood-red light and attempted to chop down Chaim's head.
<br><br>
Although Chaim was unaware of what the blood light contained in the thin blade was, he did know if he got cut by it, his Soul of Light would get destroyed.
<br><br>
Some of the other races spectating from afar sympathized with Chaim.
<br><br>
They had already predicted his tragic fate in their hearts.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a sharp light shot towards Haider's thin blade.
<br><br>
"Ding!"
<br><br>
With a crisp sound, a small soul sword circled in the air and made its way back to the chest of a human girl.
<br><br>
It was Dorothy who swung the soul sword to protect Chaim.
<br><br>
After Jermain had left the Other Shore, he had told Winchell what she was about to do and caused a lot of trouble for her.
<br><br>
However, there was nothing that could change her mind to return to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
She didn't expect to see the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace fighting against the Bearing race as soon as she entered the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Watching Chaim's life hanging by a thread as he was faced by a ruthless Haider, how could she hold back? Finally, she decided to make her move.
<br><br>
Chapter 3264 A Single Palm Strike After Dorothy's Soul of Light grew to the Indigo Soul, her attack's intensity increased as well.
<br><br>
Her irresistible soul force was so mighty that the thin blade in Haider's hand was sent flying. Even Haider was forced to take a few steps backward.
<br><br>
If ordinary people were saved at a crucial life and death moment, their first thought would be to escape.
<br><br>
However, Chaim was by no means an ordinary man.
<br><br>
When he saw Haider staggering backward, he didn't stop to see who had saved him. Instead, he believed this to be the perfect opportunity to attack Haider. And so, he slammed his feet against the ground and somersaulted through the air.
<br><br>
When he felt considerable pressure descending on him, Haider panicked and glanced up.
<br><br>
Unable to protect himself, Haider fell to the ground after Chaim trampled his head.
<br><br>
"Withdraw!"
<br><br>
Chaim ordered.
<br><br>
The eight soul swords flew toward Chaim. Just as they were about to pierce through Haider's body, Haider returned to his senses. Upon detecting the threat, he released a strong soul force, and a bear shadow flashed faintly on his back.
<br><br>
At this moment, his soul force increased manifold. As a result, Chaim could not hold on and was flung into the air.
<br><br>
'What a pity, ' Chaim sighed in his heart.
<br><br>
His ultimate goal was to kill Haider with his soul swords.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace wasn't a match for so many super forces, and yet, he had nearly reached his goal just now. The disappointment he felt was palpable.
<br><br>
After the bear shadow appeared behind Haider, he resembled an angry lion.
<br><br>
"Members of the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race, what are you waiting for? Kill him!"
<br><br>
Now that the other two races were attacking Chaim, Haider turned his attention to Dorothy.
<br><br>
"Whoever dares to stand in my way is doomed to die!"
<br><br>
Haider moved so quickly and his aura was so overwhelming that it was a thrill to watch him.
<br><br>
"Is that the Bear Soul Shadow of the Bearing race?"
<br><br>
"It's so powerful! But it is said that he has to pay a heavy price for it."
<br><br>
"The human woman who attacked Haider is not weak."
<br><br>
Panic flashed across Dorothy's face when she saw that Haider was heading straight for her.
<br><br>
Dorothy lacked experience in soul battles and didn't know how to escape this dilemma.
<br><br>
Buzz! As her Necklace of Mystic Soul flashed, a soul sword shot toward Haider again.
<br><br>
Haider didn't flinch when he saw the soul sword nearing him. On the contrary, he stretched out his hand and slapped it.
<br><br>
Bang! His attack deflected the soul sword.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Dorothy was dumbstruck with fear when her attack failed. She knew that she had to flee, or she would die! Her Soul of Light flashed, and she rushed to the other side.
<br><br>
But as she was not as fast as Haider, the distance between them decreased continually.
<br><br>
"Leave the Other Shore now!"
<br><br>
shouted Chaim from a distance.
<br><br>
He was dealing with the attacks of the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race. Although overwhelmed, he noticed Dorothy's predicament from the corner of his eye. When he saw that Dorothy was stupidly trying to escape, he reminded her.
<br><br>
As she found herself in a situation where she couldn't escape, Dorothy prepared to use the Illusion Breaking Rune to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, at this time, she saw a familiar figure appear in front of her.
<br><br>
Then she stopped reciting the spell.
<br><br>
"What on earth are you thinking?"
<br><br>
Helplessness coursed through Chaim when he saw that Dorothy still hadn't left. He hadn't, as yet, noticed who had appeared in front of Dorothy.
<br><br>
Haider was only fifty or sixty feet away from Dorothy. As he was afraid that she would leave the Other Shore, he gathered all his strength to activate his soul force. As a result, a faint golden light flashed on the bear shadow behind him.
<br><br>
As Haider leaped forward, his hands turned into sharp claws. Just as he was about to grab Dorothy, she pounced forward. The man in front of her reached out and caught her. The two of them spun wildly for a moment.
<br><br>
Then, the man skillfully removed the impact force from Dorothy, and threw a palm at Haider.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
At that moment, Haider didn't have time to figure out the identity of the man. He only knew that he had used the Bear Soul Shadow. As a result, his Soul of Light would be burned off, piece by piece. As soul pills could not replenish a burned Soul of Light, he had to use soul crystal instead.
<br><br>
Now, he was burning his soul crystal and his cultivation base! The price was high, but the effect was visible. No one could stop him in the thirteen stages of the Lust World.
<br><br>
Haider reached forward and tried to defend against the palm. He believed that with his strike, he could break his opponent's arm. Moreover, he was so angry that he wanted to tear his opponent apart.
<br><br>
But all that was wishful thinking. As soon as his hands touched the man's palm, Haider felt as though something was wrong.
<br><br>
It seemed that his opponent was not a soul and that his arm was made of fine steel.
<br><br>
He couldn't even move the arm, let alone break it.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?"
<br><br>
Confusion coursed through Haider as he reeled from his failed attack. Zen, on the other hand, sneered, "Go to hell!"
<br><br>
With that, he attacked Haider's chest.
<br><br>
Puff! Zen didn't even use all his strength.
<br><br>
However, the power contained within his palm strike was far more than a hundred times stronger than Haider's.
<br><br>
Although the bear shadow behind Haider tried to protect him, it only lasted for a very short time. Soon, the shock wave shattered the shadow, and Haider, like a piece of light paper, flew backward.
<br><br>
As the shadow dissipated, his Soul of Light also collapsed, and gradually, it dissipated on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
With just one palm strike, Zen had destroyed Haider's Soul of Light, even though the Bear Soul Shadow protected him! When the other races witnessed that, they were shocked.
<br><br>
"He has a corporeal body!"
<br><br>
"Why is a corporeal body here?"
<br><br>
"Haven't you heard? It's said that he created trouble in the Separate Abyss race, and almost destroyed their temple!"
<br><br>
While some people from the other races knew about Zen's earlier actions, the majority of them did not. They couldn't believe what they had seen.
<br><br>
Zen relaxed his arms and placed Dorothy on the ground. After a brief pause, Dorothy glared at him and said, "You were late."
<br><br>
"Why did you get involved in a fight?" Zen asked with a frown.
<br><br>
Before he continued his journey with his physical body, he had asked Dorothy to leave the Other Shore to ensure her safety.
<br><br>
Zen didn't expect that as soon as he arrived, he would see that Haider was chasing Dorothy. So his tone was reproachful.
<br><br>
Dorothy pouted and said, "I don't know. As soon as I returned to the Other Shore, I saw that the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were fighting with the Bearing race. Chaim was almost killed before I went to help them."
<br><br>
When she entered the Other Shore, she saw Chaim risking his life. As for why the disciples fought with the Bearing race, she did not know.
<br><br>
Chaim was being attacked by the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race. Although he was flexible and had several schemes, the combined strength of the two races was beyond what he could handle.
<br><br>
But after Zen's appearance, the other races stopped their attacks.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race didn't want to get involved in this battle in the first place. It was only on Haider's insistence that they obliged.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race might not have seen Zen's body before, but the Divine Farmer race had witnessed how Zen had destroyed the temple of the Bearing race. Even if some of them hadn't seen Zen, they had already heard about him.
<br><br>
They knew that they could not fight against such a monster.
<br><br>
Chapter 3265 Saving Elvinia Chaim's Soul of Light had taken a lot of damage from his bout with the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
But he had no regrets; in fact, he was still optimistic. He took out some soul pills and swallowed them before turning his head to yell to Zen, "Princess Elvinia is still being pursued by the Bearing race. Go after her!"
<br><br>
Chaim didn't know who Zen was, but he knew he was on the side of the Oneness Sky Palace, and that was all that mattered.
<br><br>
While Chaim was being chased down by Haider, he had seen some people of the Bearing race going after the Oneness Sky Palace disciples. He wondered what had happened to them.
<br><br>
"Elvinia?"
<br><br>
"Why is she here?"
<br><br>
Both Zen and Dorothy were stunned.
<br><br>
A strange feeling took over Dorothy's heart. Her mind couldn't help but wander to what happened in the Vastness Mountain and what Flamine had said.
<br><br>
"I'll save her,"
<br><br>
Zen said, taking off in the direction Chaim had pointed.
<br><br>
Dorothy pursed her lips, saying nothing.
<br><br>
Zen darted forward and before long, he caught sight of a dozen people fighting in the distance.
<br><br>
A woman lay on the ground, wrapped by a little snake and unable to move.
<br><br>
This was the first time that Zen had seen Elvinia on the Other Shore, but he could still recognize her by her silhouette.
<br><br>
Elvinia, constricted by the Dragon Snake Trap, was so anxious that she was about to spit blood.
<br><br>
She was more dissatisfied than she had ever been. She had never suffered any great losses on the Other Shore and so certainly didn't expect to end up in this situation.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace disciples were at a disadvantage. When they felt they had no chance of winning, they had opted to retreat from the Other Shore for the time being. However, the members of the Bearing race were fearless and soon there were only five disciples left to struggle through the battle.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry, Princess Elvinia. I... I can't stand it anymore!" The Soul of Light of a disciple had suffered greatly. He was left with no choice but to leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Another two had no time to escape. The Bearing race killed them and they let out a piercing shriek as their Souls of Light collapsed.
<br><br>
The last two disciples then saw it was hopeless, and decisively activated the Illusion Breaking Rune.
<br><br>
Only Elvinia remained.
<br><br>
"Two of us were killed because of this bitch!"
<br><br>
"Didn't you hear them? She is the direct descendant of Eastern Emperor Taiyi!"
<br><br>
One member of the Bearing race hoisted Elvinia up and chuckled. "You're from the direct line, right? You were born noble, but what does that matter? Once we return to our base, mark my words, you will suffer!"
<br><br>
"How... how dare you..." Elvinia shuddered with fear, unable to finish her words.
<br><br>
Although the soul was not as strong as the body, no one had ever dared to threaten her like this.
<br><br>
She knew if she fell into the hands of the Bearing race, they would do nothing but make her life torturous.
<br><br>
"You just wait and see. We're on the Other Shore now. Eastern Emperor Taiyi will not come here for us!" the man of the Bearing race scoffed arrogantly.
<br><br>
"If Eastern Emperor Taiyi does show up, he will never return!"
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace has been content to exercise sovereignty over an area for so many years. Although it is known as one of the three orthodox human forces, it actually enjoys an unwarranted reputation. Ha-ha!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
A wind blew while the members of the Bearing race continued their sarcastic remarks.
<br><br>
"Up here."
<br><br>
They all snapped their heads up at the sound of a voice and felt a black shadow crashing down on them.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen smashed down on top of the one holding Elvinia. At the same time, he stretched his hand out and swept over the rest of the Bearing race around him. His hand shook slightly, and all the people who were touched by his hand collapsed.
<br><br>
They didn't even have a chance to escape the Other Shore before they perished.
<br><br>
Elvinia sat on the ground, dumbfounded by the scene before her.
<br><br>
She had heard of what took place on the Stage Four, but she didn't know it was Zen who had done all those amazing things.
<br><br>
Without a word, Zen wrapped his hand around Elvinia's back and pinched the little snake with his fingers, tearing the snake apart. He then said in a low voice, "Follow me."
<br><br>
He had deliberately changed his voice, yet it still felt somewhat familiar to Elvinia.
<br><br>
They had only met twice before, one at the Seven Mountains Meeting and the other at the Phoenix Palace, and so Elvinia just couldn't place the voice she heard. When she saw Zen about to leave, she called out helplessly, "I...
<br><br>
I'm too weak to walk."
<br><br>
The Dragon Snake Trap had continued draining her soul force once it had grabbed hold of her. She was extremely weak now.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't leave her alone out here in the wild.
<br><br>
He thought about it for a moment, picked her up under her arms and put her on his back to carry her away.
<br><br>
It was the first time that Elvinia had been carried on the back of a man, though this was only on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen's back felt like a solid stone to her. Her heart raced uncontrollably. She couldn't think clearly and her curiosity about this stranger raged.
<br><br>
He had been helping the Oneness Sky Palace all this time so she assumed he must be a disciple of the palace.
<br><br>
The palace might not have said as much, but everyone believed this to be true.
<br><br>
"Are you a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?" Elvinia asked in a soft and sweet voice.
<br><br>
Both times they had met, Elvinia always wore an imperious look on her face. Zen was not used to this sudden change. He smiled and replied, "You could say that, but I'm not really."
<br><br>
He purposely gave an ambiguous answer.
<br><br>
Elvinia blinked and asked, "Is your body in the palace?"
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Zen.
<br><br>
"May I meet you?" Elvinia asked kindly.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head without uttering a sound.
<br><br>
He would not reveal the secret of his physical body to others unless it was absolutely essential.
<br><br>
In the Sword Light Palace, he was left with no other choice and had to reveal the truth to Dorothy. If not for this, he would have joined the Oneness Sky Palace as an unknown disciple instead of letting Winchell bring him back.
<br><br>
Elvinia was disappointed by his rejection. But Zen had saved her life; she couldn't force him to show himself. More to it, she really didn't have the ability.
<br><br>
Many other races still waited at the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Many of them were already growing impatient.
<br><br>
"Ear Mice! We have given you the soul pills as you requested. When will you open the Grand Sky Temple?"
<br><br>
"Were you lying? Do you even have the Other Shore Key?"
<br><br>
"What are you waiting for?"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice, of course, were waiting for Zen.
<br><br>
Without Zen's presence, they could not open the door easily.
<br><br>
Although they had investigated Zen's body through various channels, they were still surprised to see that he had shattered Haider's Soul of Light with a single blow. This kind of power made the Ear Mice overjoyed.
<br><br>
Dorothy stood beside Chaim, waiting for any sign of Zen.
<br><br>
She looked around and saw Zen in the distance, carrying a Soul of Light on his back. She frowned and mumbled unhappily, "Why doesn't Elvinia walk by herself?"
<br><br>
Chaim laughed on the inside. He knew Dorothy was just jealous.
<br><br>
Chapter 3266 Argument Everyone stared at Zen. Regardless of which race they belonged to, all of them had fear in their eyes.
<br><br>
The only exception was the Ear Mouse race, whose members let out sighs of relief. It seemed that the Soul of Light named Zen was right. He was this corporeal body's spokesperson.
<br><br>
One of the mice squeaked. "You are finally here!"
<br><br>
Three Ear Mice came up to Zen with an air of great respect and deference.
<br><br>
It was their first time to see Zen's physical body.
<br><br>
Zen, of course, knew that they had been waiting for him, but he didn't want to talk about opening the door right now. "We'll discuss this later," he said.
<br><br>
He walked past the mice and towards the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. Grimly he asked them, "Which races attacked you just now?"
<br><br>
At Zen's words, many warriors in the crowd looked shocked and nervous.
<br><br>
"The Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Sun Crow race and the New Moon race," answered Chaim in a cautious tone.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and turned to the crowd. His eyes swept over the warriors and landed on a flock of bird-shaped Souls of Light, belonging to the Sun Crow race. Coldly he said to them, "Don't even think about exploring the Grand Sky Temple. I give you a choice. Leave the Other Shore now, or I will kill you."
<br><br>
At Zen's ultimatum, the Sun Crows shrank back and drew closer to each other.
<br><br>
While they felt fear at Zen's words, they were hesitant to leave right away.
<br><br>
They wanted to see how the situation would develop. Even if the worst happened, they believed that they could escape from the Other Shore at any time.
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race were thinking along similar lines. They stood a safe distance from Zen, observing him as he spoke, and they refused to give up on the chance that they might still find a way to explore the Grand Sky Temple. After all, they had already handed in their soul pills.
<br><br>
It was different if the Ear Mice were on Zen's side.
<br><br>
After they entered the Grand Sky Temple, they wouldn't be able to leave the Other Shore. By then, they would have no choice but to let their souls be slaughtered by him.
<br><br>
A warrior of the Divine Farmer race spoke up. "Are you willing to listen to the reason? The Bearing race asked us to help, and our only choice was to fight with them. Incidentally, not a single disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace was killed by us. Will you deny our entry just because we fought alongside our allies?"
<br><br>
"It was not your only choice. You could have refused to fight," Zen said, sneering at the warrior. "Since you chose to follow the Bearing race, you must pay the price. That's not the first time you've played such a trick. You also allied with each other to kill the Nine Li race. There are consequences for your actions."
<br><br>
The destruction of a superpower was a matter of great importance even in the Source World. All the races present were familiar with the history of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race. Their coordinated efforts had led to the destruction of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
The crowd were curious and slightly anxious. They wondered why Zen had specifically mentioned the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
He had sounded genuinely indignant. Was Zen a member of the Nine Li race? Elvinia, who was on the back of Zen, sensed the change in his aura, a shift towards darkness at the mention of the Nine Li race. She thought that this corporeal body's identity was probably more complicated than she had imagined.
<br><br>
The six people standing in the corner had also been jolted by the mention of the Nine Li race. They looked uneasily at each other.
<br><br>
"Brother, Why did he bring up the Nine Li race? Is he one of us?"
<br><br>
murmured the human girl in a low voice.
<br><br>
"It could be... Otherwise, why did he mention the Nine Li race at all?" one of her companions whispered back.
<br><br>
The burliest man in the group shook his head. "It's hard to say. It could simply be that what happened today reminds him of what had happened to the Nine Li race. There are so few of us after entire branches of our race were killed off, and we keep ourselves hidden even now. How could someone like him come from the scattered survivors of our race?"
<br><br>
At present, the last survivors of the Nine Li race were struggling to survive, having lost most of their long-held resources. The younger generation found it hard to compete with other more powerful races, so the Nine Li race continued steadily to decline.
<br><br>
The human girl curled her lips, considering the matter. She did not contradict her brother, who was by nature suspicious, but she also made up her mind to ask Zen about this issue as soon as she got the chance.
<br><br>
The warrior of the Divine Farmer race had fallen silent, intimidated by Zen's unyielding stance. In contrast, a member of the Bearing race laughed out loud, stepping forward. He said to Zen cockily, "It's truly impressive that you've entered the Other Shore with your corporeal body, but I can't help wondering how you're going to deliver on all your threats. On your own? Or will the members of the Oneness Sky Palace help you out?"
<br><br>
The Bearing race were not afraid of offending Zen, especially since he had already dictated that they had no chance of entering the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
They were not afraid of the Oneness Sky Palace, either. Although the members of the Oneness Sky Palace were arguably among the top three strongest forces of the human race, in terms of pure numbers, they simply couldn't compare with the Bearing race—and that was without factoring in the alliance of the Bearing race with the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
Zen replied calmly, "It's not just me or the Oneness Sky Palace. We are speaking of justice and fairness. I don't expect you to understand, but it is in the interests of most people to curb the actions of crooked groups like the Bearing race. Any power you have now is temporary. Eventually your strength will dwindle until you are nothing, less than the smallest grain of sand."
<br><br>
Zen's words were powerful. It was true that he and the members of the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't stand alone against the Bearing race, but there were many other strong forces and superpowers in the Source World who had chosen the Finale Way. If it came down to war, these forces would side with the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Great speech!"
<br><br>
shouted a member of the Snake Goddess race, whose body was half human and half snake. Her words were met with applause from her companions.
<br><br>
"Yeah! The Finale Way leads to the right path!"
<br><br>
"Down with the Bearing race! We will fight those idiots who cheat, lie, and deceive others for their own benefit!"
<br><br>
"I've never trusted the Divine Farmer race!"
<br><br>
It was clear from the chorus of cries in the crowd that they supported Zen and also believed in the Finale Way.
<br><br>
Many of those from younger generations were not involved in the decisionmaking and path-choosing that were usually conducted by the elders of their races. However, they were not blind to the situation unfolding around them, and they were willing to take a stand.
<br><br>
Zen had only said what many of them were already thinking. They agreed wholeheartedly with his condemnation of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
Most of the Bearing race warriors looked offended and angry and began raising a clamor, trying to argue with what Zen said. But Zen had already lost interest in further arguments.
<br><br>
"You can clear up here and block this area. I don't want to see them again,"
<br><br>
Zen said to the Ear Mice, ignoring the members of the Bearing race. There was no point in dragging out the argument any further—they believed in different ways, and there was no possibility of reconciling their competing beliefs.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice, of course, were even less interested in the Bearing race than Zen. Since Zen had arrived, they viewed all this discussion as a pure waste of time.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice rushed forward at Zen's prompting, squeaking. "Time to get to work! Let's clear up this place! The Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Sun Crow race and the New Moon race are forbidden to enter. So are those who have not handed out their soul pills and gotten their soul marks.
<br><br>
Everyone else, please gather in front of the Grand Sky Temple," said an Ear Mouse in a high-pitched voice.
<br><br>
A group of ten Ear Mice stood nearby, holding watering cans. They sprayed out thin, pale blue liquid that spread out and covered the ground completely.
<br><br>
The blue liquid was the Soul Interdicting Water. Like the Soul Restraining Sand of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Soul Binding Thread of the Bearing race, it was intended to prevent Souls of Light from leaving the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After the ground had been covered with the Soul Interdicting Water, the Ear Mice continued to put some restrictions on it. The whole Grand Sky Temple was now a temporary impasse, and no Souls of Light would dare to enter without permission.
<br><br>
One of the members of the New Moon race stepped up to the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
"Hey! If you won't let us enter the Grand Sky Temple, then return our soul pills to us. We've already paid and we want them back," he said forcefully.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice squeaked, looking upset. The soul pills were already in their possession and it was very difficult to think of returning them.
<br><br>
But they couldn't renege on their debt in front of so many races, human and non-human.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice gathered and chattered, looking for a loophole. Finally an Ear Mouse turned to the man who had asked for their soul pills. "The members of the four races who have paid soul pills are free to try and enter the temple. But remember! We are not responsible for the consequences!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse rolled its eyes meaningfully towards Zen, who stood at the gate of the Grand Sky Temple, emanating an intimidating and powerful aura.
<br><br>
Because they stood a safe distance from Zen, the four races barred from entering the temple dared to argue with the Ear Mice. But none of them dared to move closer to the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Chapter 3267 The Ear Mice's Real Purpose "Ha-ha..."
<br><br>
Elvinia, who was being carried by Zen, laughed. She knew that the Ear Mice were shrewd, but this was too shameless.
<br><br>
At this moment, Dorothy suddenly said, "It's time for you to get off. It's indecent for you to lie on a man's back for so long."
<br><br>
She was unable to contain her jealousy any longer.
<br><br>
Offended by Dorothy's rebuke, Elvinia glared at her before slowly asking, "Who the hell are you? What does any of this have to do with you?"
<br><br>
As Elvinia couldn't see Dorothy's face, she didn't recognize her. She thought Dorothy was a disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace. Few disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace dared to catch her attention.
<br><br>
"You!" Dorothy raised her eyebrows as outrage coursed through her. She was about to call to Zen but stopped when she remembered that she couldn't reveal his identity. Instead, she held back and pinched Zen's arm. "Hey! Put her down!"
<br><br>
Zen wasn't focusing on the two women as he didn't expect them to argue over such a trivial thing.
<br><br>
He glanced at both women as he tried to figure out what was going on.
<br><br>
Chaim chuckled before responding, "We're family. Princess Elvinia, this is Dorothy. She helped us earlier."
<br><br>
"Oh, it's you." Elvinia was stunned.
<br><br>
"So what?" Dorothy seemed as imposing as Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia was unwilling to back down. She leaned her head against Zen's shoulder and deliberately said, "My soul force has been drained. As I have no strength left, I can't come down!"
<br><br>
Elvinia was taking soul pills the entire time that Zen carried her. Although she had lost a considerable amount of soul force, she had now replenished most of it.
<br><br>
Dorothy knew that Elvinia would be dishonest about her soul force.
<br><br>
With a smile, Dorothy said, "The Grand Sky Temple is going to open soon.
<br><br>
Since you lack soul energy, you should leave the Other Shore and rest. You must take care of yourself. The temple is a very dangerous place."
<br><br>
As soon as Dorothy finished speaking, Elvinia jumped off Zen's back. She was so fast that everyone was astounded. Even from her Soul of Light, one could tell that she was flexible. She replied coldly, "Thank you for your concern. I can replenish my soul force."
<br><br>
As she spoke, she took out a few more soul pills and absorbed them into her Soul of Light. At the same time, her soul rapidly filled with energy.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, the Grand Sky Temple is a perilous place. As you are a princess, perhaps you'd better not enter it," Zen rationalized.
<br><br>
Both Chaim and Elvinia were not included in Zen's plan. However, the Grand Sky Temple would surely attract the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, and the conflict caused by Elvinia was something that Zen had not expected.
<br><br>
"I can take care of myself. I'm not as fragile as someone," Elvinia said sarcastically as she glared at Dorothy.
<br><br>
Dorothy raised her eyebrows and readied herself for a scathing retort, but Zen reached out and pinched her arm. So, she bit her tongue. After all, she hadn't come to quarrel with Elvinia.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had used the Soul Interdicting Water to seal the area in front of the Grand Sky Temple and imposed restrictions. The large races that had paid the soul pills lined up at the temple gate as they waited to enter.
<br><br>
The arrogant and aggressive members of the Separate Abyss race fell silent as soon as Zen appeared.
<br><br>
As most of them had come from Stage Eleven, they had witnessed Zen grow to over ten thousand feet tall. Since they were terrified of Zen's physical body, they didn't dare to provoke him.
<br><br>
After the other races had completed their preparations, an Ear Mouse climbed the stairs in front of the Grand Sky Temple and stretched its thin claw, which was marked with long and thin lines.
<br><br>
As it tapped the gate with its claw, the gate flashed with metal luster before it slowly opened.
<br><br>
The other races appeared anxious. Everyone wanted to enter the temple first, but as the Ear Mice had imposed restrictions in this area, the members from the other races had to follow their orders.
<br><br>
"Well, you can enter now," said the Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
As soon as it finished speaking, the gigantic Souls of Light of the Separate Abyss race rushed into the temple.
<br><br>
The other races also dashed forward, one after another.
<br><br>
In stark contrast, the Ear Mice stood by patiently. They didn't seem to be in a hurry, even though they had opened the door.
<br><br>
More than two thousand Souls of Light had gathered at the gate of the temple. In a flash, almost every Soul of Light had entered the temple.
<br><br>
"Why don't you go in?" Dorothy prompted Chaim.
<br><br>
As she hated the princess, Dorothy couldn't wait for Chaim to escort Elvinia inside.
<br><br>
Dorothy had been with Zen ever since she had entered the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
Jealousy coursed through her at the thought of someone else vying for Zen's attention.
<br><br>
However, Chaim, Elvinia, and the other disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace thought that it was the best to follow Zen.
<br><br>
As Zen didn't move, they stayed put as well.
<br><br>
"I have reached an agreement with the Ear Mice. I can only take Dorothy into the temple with me," Zen explained.
<br><br>
Among all the creatures here, only Zen and Dorothy hadn't paid the soul pills.
<br><br>
Elvinia fixed her gaze on Zen. She was a straightforward woman. Since he did not intend to explore the temple with her, she decided to proceed alone.
<br><br>
Chaim cupped his hands and bowed before Zen and Dorothy. Then, he said, "If that is the case, we will enter first. Thank you again for saving us!"
<br><br>
"There's no need to be so formal about it," Zen replied.
<br><br>
After the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace entered, Zen walked up the steps too.
<br><br>
At this time, the Ear Mice surrounded him. One of them asked respectfully, "What's your name, sir?"
<br><br>
"Just call me Thad," Zen replied.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice knew that Zen wouldn't give them his real name, so they didn't pressure him. One of them asked, "Since you came to the Other Shore with your corporeal body, you must have some extraordinary talents. I wonder if you can destroy the Grand Sky Temple."
<br><br>
"You want me to destroy the Grand Sky Temple?"
<br><br>
Zen had no trouble breaking the Sacred Mallow Temple on Stage One. The Bearing race's temple on Stage Four and the buildings on Stage Eleven were not a challenge either.
<br><br>
However, he was unsure if he could destroy the Grand Sky Temple on Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
Zen turned to study the building. The temple glowed with a faint metallic luster as though it had been infused with a special metal during its construction.
<br><br>
He walked to the door, pressed his hand against the wall, and slowly released his strength.
<br><br>
Sizzle! The wall was apparently more solid than Zen had expected. Even though he employed fifty percent of his strength, only a fingermark was left on the wall's surface.
<br><br>
"As the wall is five feet thick, it will be difficult to destroy," Zen surmised.
<br><br>
When the Ear Mice saw this, ecstasy appeared on their faces.
<br><br>
"Unbelievable! You left a fingermark on the wall!" one Ear Mouse praised.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen was puzzled.
<br><br>
"The way to the Dark Region is blocked by a wall. It is not as solid as this one. Since you have such strength, you will be able to destroy it easily," the Ear Mouse explained.
<br><br>
The reason why the Ear Mice were not in a hurry was that they knew that no Soul of Light could destroy that wall.
<br><br>
They had completed their preparations before entering the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Chapter 3268 Ruling Forces Compared to the other great races, the Ear Mice had an unparalleled advantage in this aspect.
<br><br>
After all, they were involved in most of the deals on the Other Shore. They knew the whereabouts of the Other Shore Keys as well as the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
For the past ten years, the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was rarely encountered. Only three were ever sold. However, when the anomaly appeared behind the Grand Sky Temple, the Ear Mice immediately located a creature that possessed the key and bought the key for a steep price.
<br><br>
As they reached the end of the Grand Sky Temple, they found a wall blocking their way. Seeing this, they felt disheartened.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light were not able to cross the wall.
<br><br>
Later on, the Ear Mice quickly came up with another plan. They began to spread the news. Soon enough, all the major forces in the Source World found out about the anomaly of the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Their goal was to earn more soul pills. Because there was no Soul of Light that could break the wall down, they wouldn't be able to enter the Dark Region.
<br><br>
But a few days ago, they heard news from Stage Four and Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
This allowed the Ear Mice to change their strategy once more.
<br><br>
The man in front of them gave them hope that the wall could be torn down.
<br><br>
The Grand Sky Temple was enormous. It was a hundred times larger than the Sacred Mallow Temple.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy followed the Ear Mice into the hall. There they saw a huge statue in front of them.
<br><br>
The statue was sixty feet tall. It had an eagle head and a bear body. It emanated an extraordinary aura.
<br><br>
"Is this the race that built the Grand Sky Temple?" Zen inquired.
<br><br>
One of the Ear Mice nodded and said, "The Grand Sky race was a powerful race. They could be considered as a ruling force."
<br><br>
"A ruling force?" Zen blinked in wonderment.
<br><br>
"Yes. Any powerful race that has ruled the entire chaos can be called a ruling force," the Ear Mouse laughed. "The current super powers in the Source World are simply too weak compared to them."
<br><br>
Although the Source World was relatively peaceful now, there were various forces that struggled for supremacy. There had never been a ruling force.
<br><br>
There were many super powers that existed.
<br><br>
These included the Separate Abyss race, the Pear Hill, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
There was a great gap between these super powers. However, none of them was able to control the entire Source World, let alone the chaos.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse's statement reminded Zen of the Sacred Mallow Temple.
<br><br>
"How about the Dreaded Eye Demons of the Sacred Mallow Temple?" he asked.
<br><br>
"They can also be considered as a ruling force," answered the Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
"Nevertheless, they still can't compare to the Grand Sky race. The races that were able to build their temples on the Other Shore used to be ruling forces."
<br><br>
"Is that so?" Zen questioned No. 9527 in his mind.
<br><br>
"Yes. Perhaps you can say that but only because it's how the Ear Mice define the forces. The Chaos Ancient Gods are above all those forces," No.
<br><br>
9527 replied.
<br><br>
The creature that could control the truth was the true master of the chaos.
<br><br>
Zen thought of what he had just said outside the temple. Somehow, he felt confused. He asked the Ear Mouse, "Did the Grand Sky race follow the Finale Way?"
<br><br>
"Yes." The Ear Mouse nodded.
<br><br>
"Well, it looks like they also failed." A look of regret registered upon Zen's face.
<br><br>
Both the Dreaded Eye Demons and the Grand Sky race had been able to control the entire chaos. They could summon more resources and they might be even more powerful. But in the end, they couldn't escape that needle.
<br><br>
"You are living in too much pain. In addition, you have only repeated the path of the predecessors. Before the Finale Way is realized, you have to rely on us for everything," the Ear Mouse said.
<br><br>
"What? We have to rely on you?" Zen was stunned by this.
<br><br>
Dorothy also blinked in shock.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were the most mediocre super force in the Source World.
<br><br>
They didn't seem to have any other needs except earning divine crystals and soul pills.
<br><br>
They could just exchange powerful Other Shore Tokens, rare Other Shore Keys, and a large sum of soul pills for divine crystals.
<br><br>
Other than being used as a currency, the divine crystals could only be used to replenish the energy of the Other Shore Tokens. The Ear Mice's obsession with the divine crystals had always been incomprehensible to the other races.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
"Squeak!"
<br><br>
Several Ear Mice squeaked to change the topic.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse talking with Zen gave a wicked smile and promptly changed the subject.
<br><br>
Obviously, Zen and Dorothy understood. Regardless, a super power would definitely not be as simple as they thought. The Ear Mice should not be underestimated either.
<br><br>
They bypassed the statue and continued towards the end of the hall where there were nineteen arched doors.
<br><br>
It was Zen and Dorothy's first time to visit here. Naturally, they didn't know what the doors meant.
<br><br>
"All of the nineteen arched doors lead to the same destination, but they differ in their difficulty. The thirteenth and seventeenth ones are death roads. The seventh one is the simplest while the nineteenth one is the most difficult. The Souls of Light that went inside had a slim chance of surviving; however, many of them had discovered some powerful Other Shore Tokens there." The information provided by the Ear Mouse was worth more than 100, 000 soul pills. The more they knew about the temple, the more hope they would have for survival after all.
<br><br>
With that, it asked Zen, "Which arched door will you choose?"
<br><br>
It left the decision up to Zen.
<br><br>
"I'd like to choose the nineteenth one," answered Zen.
<br><br>
There weren't many things that could threaten Zen on the Other Shore. In the first place, he had already planned on finding Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Therefore, he wouldn't let go of this great opportunity.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice glanced at each other. They didn't know much about what was behind the nineteenth door. They only knew that this path was very dangerous. But this time, Zen was leading the way. Thus, they would have the chance to find some high-grade Other Shore Tokens as well.
<br><br>
"Well then, let's go." The Ear Mice believed in Zen's strength. They agreed without much hesitation.
<br><br>
Zen walked in the front followed by Dorothy and the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
There was a long and narrow semi-circular passageway behind the arch.
<br><br>
The ceiling of the passageway was bumpy and uneven. It was covered with lines that resembled the blood vessels of a human body. The faint red light emitted by the lines was flickering. Sometimes it was bright and sometimes dim. It was just like the rhythm of breathing.
<br><br>
As Zen entered the passageway, he didn't feel anything uncomfortable.
<br><br>
Dorothy who was behind him, however, suddenly felt very unwell.
<br><br>
"Well..."
<br><br>
Dorothy couldn't help but wrap her arms around herself. She leaned against Zen's back.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Zen turned his head and asked in concern.
<br><br>
He didn't worry about his own safety but he had to protect Dorothy.
<br><br>
"I feel like my soul force is fading away," Dorothy answered.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the Ear Mice and one of them said, "After we enter the Grand Sky Temple, our soul force will constantly drain. This is the rule of this temple. Before we enter the passageway, it drains very slowly. But now, it is depleted faster. You can take soul pills to replenish it."
<br><br>
Dorothy nodded and took out some soul pills. She took them to replenish her soul force.
<br><br>
She brought a lot of soul pills with her so the lost soul force was not a problem for her at all.
<br><br>
Chapter 3269 The Faces On The Walls "What is going on here?"
<br><br>
Zen muttered in curiosity as he pressed a hand against the rough wall.
<br><br>
Despite its roughness, his hand could press and make a slight indentation on it. It wasn't rock but more of fleshy material, almost like the internal cavity of an animal.
<br><br>
"We don't really know. According to rumors, the 19 passageways within the Grand Sky Temple are, in fact, living creatures, and we are walking in their bellies," an Ear Mouse answered.
<br><br>
The Other Shore was filled with infinite mysteries, some stranger than the last. There was no way to investigate, much less prove, all of them.
<br><br>
The party continued forward and every thousand feet, the Ear Mice and Dorothy would have to absorb soul pills in order to replenish their soul force.
<br><br>
Blood red luster radiated from the walls, becoming brighter as they ventured deeper into the passageway. There were times when sections of the path were illuminated entirely by the red light but there were also times when it simply stretched on in darkness.
<br><br>
Despite having Zen lead the way, the Ear Mice and Dorothy still felt the pressure and were definitely on high alert.
<br><br>
"ARGH!"
<br><br>
Sounds of screaming could be heard up front, catching them by surprise.
<br><br>
"What was that?!"
<br><br>
"That must be the creatures that entered the passageway first!"
<br><br>
"What did they encounter for them to scream like that?"
<br><br>
Numerous creatures from various races had also entered the temple that day.
<br><br>
Some knew of the slim chances the 19th passageway offered in terms of survival but there were others that had no idea and chose it without knowing the possible horrors that awaited them.
<br><br>
"I'll go look," Zen told them determinedly.
<br><br>
He darted forward the passageway, leaving the party behind.
<br><br>
It was after two thousand feet when he came upon a strange sight: faces, all of them with their eyes closed, lined both sides of the path.
<br><br>
The faces had variety and belonged to all kinds of races. Zen could identify a few human ones among them. What was unsettling about these faces though, was the fact that all of them sported abnormally painful expressions.
<br><br>
"The scream didn't come from these faces," Zen muttered to himself.
<br><br>
He continued to take a few more steps forward and entered the corner where he saw eight Souls of Light being pulled into the walls by random hands coming out of the walls.
<br><br>
There were still a few faces in this area and some of them had their eyes open.
<br><br>
"They're from the Separate Abyss race," he said to himself in realization.
<br><br>
Members of the Separate Abyss race possessed large bodies that could block the passageways entirely. Zen could recognize them at a glance.
<br><br>
At that moment, they were currently struggling against the arms that were adamant in pulling them into the walls. The Souls of Light used their best methods and their soul force continually surged within the passageway but to no avail.
<br><br>
At last, the hands succeeded in dragging them into the walls.
<br><br>
As the last member was taken, he looked up and locked eyes with Zen. He pointed at him and began to grovel. "Help! Help me..."
<br><br>
Zen's history with the Separate Abyss race was less than stellar but he still found it in himself to reach out and grab the begging man's arm.
<br><br>
He tried, he really tried to pull him out but even his help couldn't save this man from becoming prey to the passageway wall.
<br><br>
All that Zen managed to do was break off his arm and let the rest of him get swallowed up by the wall, quite literally.
<br><br>
One could split their soul into many pieces and they were all alive, just like Chaim's long soul swords.
<br><br>
However, if Chaim's main soul lost consciousness, then the long swords would disappear.
<br><br>
Zen held the arm, the only thing that had been left of that unfortunate warrior. However, a moment later, it suddenly vanished in a wisp of purple smoke.
<br><br>
At that moment, the faces that lined the walls all opened their eyes.
<br><br>
Suddenly, numerous arms, long and pale, shot out of the walls.
<br><br>
These arms were extremely pale, bordering snow-white complexion. Each arm ended in a sort of weird, three-fingered hand, and each finger was one foot long. It was something Zen had never really seen on any creature before.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The arms all made a grab for Zen, clawing at his flesh.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! In a blink of the eye, eight hands managed to grab hold of him and began to drag him towards the wall.
<br><br>
"Impressive. Also a tad bit creepy. But it's wishful thinking to think you can drag me in," he hissed at the arms coldly.
<br><br>
Zen twisted his body and swung his right hand. There was a nasty crunching sound as the hands he hit broke, some even splintering completely and leaving hanging, broken bones and sinew.
<br><br>
Probably realizing that Zen wasn't as weak as their earlier prey, the broken arms all retreated into the walls.
<br><br>
"What's behind the walls? Let me see!"
<br><br>
Zen demanded, grabbing hold of a broken bone that was in the process of retreating. He attempted to pull it out but the bone was fragile and simply crumbled in his hand.
<br><br>
"Ahahah..."
<br><br>
The faces on the walls began to growl.
<br><br>
It was a rather creepy sight with all these growling faces, especially when they all began to move along the walls and headed towards the direction of Dorothy and the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
"NO!" Zen screamed.
<br><br>
He had chosen the 19th passageway because he was confident in his abilities but Dorothy and the Ear Mice were a different story. He couldn't allow these faces to get close. He had to protect them! Dong! The young man had switched on the offense and punched the wall with his strength.
<br><br>
His power was terrifying and the punch was not lacking in force at all. Even the entire passageway trembled from his attack.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the faces were completely unharmed. They disappeared for a few seconds but quickly resurfaced all over again. Some even stared at Zen, almost as if mocking him.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! Dong! Zen, however, was resolute and continued his tirade of punches, targeting each face that lined the walls.
<br><br>
As per his observations earlier, the walls weren't made of hewn rock but some kind of fleshy material. This proved to be a disadvantage as the flexible walls absorbed the force of Zen's punches, keeping the faces out of harm's way.
<br><br>
"Thad! What's going on?!"
<br><br>
Dorothy shouted from the red haze. She heard the commotion and figured that Zen had made his move. She couldn't really see anything since her spiritual sense was blocked.
<br><br>
"Mind both sides of the path!"
<br><br>
She heard Zen answer from beyond.
<br><br>
"What? Why? What's wrong with the walls?"
<br><br>
"Wait! Look, some masks are flying along the walls!"
<br><br>
"These are faces! Look, I can even see some of our race! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice began to panic, quite scared of what was happening.
<br><br>
The reason they dared venture into the Grand Sky Temple was that they held a lot of information, more so than the other races. Moreover, they had Zen to protect them.
<br><br>
However, their current situation proved to be quite precarious.
<br><br>
As the faces reached their area, white, three-fingered hands began to shoot out of the walls and charged at them! An unfortunate Ear Mouse that had been standing close to the wall was the first casualty. It was suddenly grabbed by a hand and dragged into the wall before it could even scream.
<br><br>
"Stay away from the walls!"
<br><br>
"Don't allow yourself to get caught!"
<br><br>
"Soul Protection Shield!" one of the Ear Mice cried out, summoning a shield from its claw.
<br><br>
There was a flash of light as a small, round shield surrounded the Ear Mice and Dorothy, protecting them from harm.
<br><br>
The Soul Protection Shield was a powerful soul weapon and was only a bit weaker than Dorothy's Necklace of Mystic Soul.
<br><br>
Relieved due to the fact that there was now a shield to protect them, the Ear Mice and Dorothy began to relax. Surely the hands wouldn't be able to reach them now. Unfortunately, they were very wrong. Numerous, ghastly, white hands scratched at the shield and one managed to break through. It grabbed hold of Dorothy and began to drag her towards the wall.
<br><br>
Chapter 3270 The Hearts Of Accomplice These hands were nothing for Zen. However, the Souls of Light simply found them totally vulnerable to their attacks.
<br><br>
Even though Dorothy had an Indigo Soul, it was still difficult for her to defend herself.
<br><br>
More importantly, she had just seen an Ear Mouse being dragged into the wall. The mouse had instantly lost its life. Therefore, she understood what was at stake if the hand won.
<br><br>
Faced with such a desperate and impossible struggle, the Necklace of Mystic Soul on her chest began to shine. Then, the soul sword shot out and slashed at the hand.
<br><br>
Crack! Dorothy let out a gasp. The almost invincible soul sword had only left a shallow mark on that hand! And after her first attack failed, the hand reacted so fast that there was no chance for her to launch another one. She was directly dragged towards the wall.
<br><br>
Just as her body was about to be squeezed into the wall, Zen rushed over, grabbed the hand with one fist and squeezed. "Crack!" There was a loud snapping sound, and the bones inside the hand were instantly broken to pieces.
<br><br>
"Yargh!"
<br><br>
A face on the wall let out a shrill cry of anguish and rushed back into the wall.
<br><br>
However, more faces appeared on both sides of the passageway and more hands began to come out on both of the walls. It was as if there was an army of attackers around them.
<br><br>
Zen wrapped his arms around Dorothy and pulled her towards the center of the passageway. He then called out, "Follow me, all of you!"
<br><br>
When the Ear Mice saw that even the Soul Protection Shield could not protect them against this unknown foe, their faces turned deathly pale.
<br><br>
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeaking shrill cries of fear, they rushed and nestled around Zen, wishing to enter his body for protection.
<br><br>
A demonic laughter rang out.
<br><br>
More hands began to creep out of the walls and the entire passageway was almost filled with the creepy sight.
<br><br>
Zen, who was standing in the center and was therefore at a distance from them, didn't seem to care. However, if any of the hands tried to reach out and grab the Ear Mice or Dorothy, he would instantly cut them one by one with his bare hand.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! More and more broken pieces of deathly white bones began to pile up on the ground. They were already almost as high as Zen's knees.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Come here, Thad!"
<br><br>
"Help! Help!"
<br><br>
"Cut it out!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice were all panicking badly. Their temperament and grace were gone. They seemed completely different from what they used to be outside the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Dorothy, on the other hand, seemed rather calm.
<br><br>
She wasn't flustered at all when Zen had thrown his arms around her to protect her. He was keeping a promise and she trusted him.
<br><br>
Zen had assured her that he was going to keep her safe, and she knew that he was definitely able to do so. The things she had experienced on the Other Shore had strengthened her faith in Zen.
<br><br>
The fight lasted for about fifteen minutes. The pile of bone fragments on the ground could almost reach his waist now. Finally, the noise began to subside.
<br><br>
No more hands stretched out from the walls, but numerous faces were still floating on them, gazing at Zen with empty eyes.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Finally they are gone!"
<br><br>
"Damn! The 19th passageway is really dangerous!"
<br><br>
"Thad, you are really powerful! Squeak! You're our best friend!"
<br><br>
Hearing the Ear Mice's praise, Zen merely rolled his eyes. If he were being honest, he didn't want to be friends with them.
<br><br>
"What the hell are these creatures?" When Dorothy finally came out of Zen's arms, she stared at the faces on the walls. It was a little creepy to look at and her voice shook a bit.
<br><br>
One of the Ear Mice was observing the walls intently and said after a while, "If I am not wrong, then these faces must be the legendary Wandering Ghosts."
<br><br>
"Wandering Ghosts?" Zen repeated in a curious tone.
<br><br>
"I've heard of them," Dorothy piped up. "Those who cannot return from the Other Shore are referred to as the Wandering Ghosts."
<br><br>
If a soul died on the Other Shore, the body would become a simple shell.
<br><br>
However, some people's souls didn't die. Instead, they stayed on the Other Shore forever for some reasons. They were called the Wandering Ghosts.
<br><br>
A few disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had become Wandering Ghosts, so Dorothy had heard of them.
<br><br>
"Their souls are enslaved in the walls forever. How poor they are," Zen sighed as he stared at the faces.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice didn't have much pity for these Wandering Ghosts. They were more concerned about their own lives and business. The latter part was made clear when they waved their hands, and small blue triangles appeared.
<br><br>
They were going to collect the broken bones lying on the ground.
<br><br>
In their defense, these arms had displayed astonishing strength. The bones could now be sold as powerful Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
After collecting all of the broken bones, the Ear Mice bowed towards the faces on the walls and then left with Zen and Dorothy.
<br><br>
As they moved, so did the faces on the walls.
<br><br>
After losing their arms, the faces could obviously no longer launch an attack. They could only track the group on its progress through the passageway. Even so, the group was still followed closely by the faces on both sides. The eyes were mainly staring at Zen. They howled in a voice full of resentment.
<br><br>
After Zen had led his group over twenty thousand feet forward, the passageway gradually became wider and turned into a path going up. The blood vessels at the top of the passageway were also beginning to get thicker.
<br><br>
"What are these things?" Dorothy asked as she raised her head and looked upwards.
<br><br>
Zen looked up as well. His eyes narrowed and a flash of surprise appeared.
<br><br>
"Three hearts? What creature's innards are we in right now?"
<br><br>
On the top of the passageway, three hearts were hanging, pounding and pumping constantly. Each of them was half as tall as a person. The thick blood vessels they had been following gathered in those hearts.
<br><br>
Every time the hearts beat, the red light would become dim, and then return to normal on the next beat.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Oh, my God!"
<br><br>
"This is..."
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice usually talked in human language, but suddenly, they started to speak in their own tongue. Something had horrified them severely.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy stealthily exchanged glances with dissatisfaction on their faces. What was going on? The Ear Mice had bought and sold a large number of Other Shore Tokens over the years, which meant that they were experts in identifying the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
They must have recognized the hearts. And it was obvious that they didn't want Zen and Dorothy to know. Otherwise, why would they start discussing among themselves in their tongue? Zen had seen with his own eyes how shrewd and clever the Ear Mice were.
<br><br>
He didn't know what they were plotting, but since they didn't want him and Dorothy to know about it, something was definitely up.
<br><br>
Zen's face darkened and he said, "Alright then. Since you guys don't want me to know what you are up to, you can go ahead by yourselves. Dorothy and I are going to leave the Grand Sky Temple."
<br><br>
He was being clever now. The group was still exploring the 19th passageway. Without Zen, the Ear Mice wouldn't be able to leave the passageway alive, let alone explore the Dark Region.
<br><br>
These three hearts were quite a significant discovery. The truth was, they wanted to obtain the maximum benefits for their own selves, so they were discussing whether to tell Zen and Dorothy the truth or not.
<br><br>
While they were chatting non-stop, they suddenly became anxious when they heard Zen's words. If he really did leave, they were gone! "Squeak! That's not what we meant!"
<br><br>
"Squeak! Alright, listen. These are the Hearts of Accomplice. They are one, or rather, three of a kind!"
<br><br>
"We've only seen one of those in the Source World. And even that was a long time ago. But now, there are three of them in front of us, which is quite a surprise! The Grand Sky Temple is truly a miraculous place!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice explained at once. Obviously, they were very excited about this discovery, but also frightened of him leaving.
<br><br>
Despite their disorganized and incoherent speech, Zen and Dorothy still understood what they were trying to say.
<br><br>
Chapter 3271 Terrifying Ability The Other Shore had always been a magical place.
<br><br>
It was home to the Other Shore Tokens that did not just have Other Shore Power, but had various special abilities as well.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type always possessed strong Other Shore Power. For example, the Strength God Totem had more Other Shore Power than others in Stage Thirteen, however it was no longer popular among the warriors.
<br><br>
For one, the bodies of the warriors in the Lust World were restricted, so they couldn't exert the full strength of it. Besides, only strength was not enough.
<br><br>
But Zen's body was able to handle the Strength God Totem, and so he chose it without hesitation.
<br><br>
Among the Other Shore Tokens, the mysterious and descending types were the most popular.
<br><br>
They were known to have rare abilities.
<br><br>
"The Heart of Accomplice is a mysterious Other Shore Token. It was once possessed by a member of the Celestial Wolf race," the Ear Mouse explained.
<br><br>
The Celestial Wolf race were extremely powerful. However, they were small in numbers. This had prohibited them from going against super forces.
<br><br>
In the early days, the Celestial Wolf race dwelled mostly in the Star Wolf Province. They rarely participated in the disputes outside.
<br><br>
However, that changed when the Dog Barbarian race, a super force, invaded the Star Wolf Province some ten thousand years ago.
<br><br>
The Celestial Wolf race fought with all their might, but they were weak and powerless against the Dog Barbarian race.
<br><br>
The leader of the Dog Barbarian race, Lord Shaw, was one of the top warriors in the entire Source World. No one in the Celestial Wolf race was at par with him. Lord Shaw easily annihilated the Celestial Wolf race, including their leader. The Celestial Wolf race neared extinction.
<br><br>
Fortunately for them, Lord Shaw was killed by someone from the Celestial Wolf race at the last minute. The Dog Barbarian race had to flee the Star Wolf Province. Surprisingly, that killer was only at the primary level of the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
"The primary level of the Chaotic Source Realm?" Zen blinked his eyes in confusion. "How strong was Lord Shaw?" he asked.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse rubbed its chin as it thought. "He was almost as strong as Eastern Emperor Taiyi of the Oneness Sky Palace. They weren't on the same level, but Lord Shaw wasn't too inferior."
<br><br>
"What?!" Zen gasped.
<br><br>
Soon, he'd be able to enter the Chaotic Source Realm and he knew it would make him stronger.
<br><br>
However, it never occurred to him that a warrior of Chaotic Source Realm would be able to battle powerful warriors like Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
"That's impossible. From what I know, Lord Shaw was lured into a trap and the Celestial Wolf race attacked him together," Dorothy retorted.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse shook its head firmly. "That's what the rumors say, but we can confirm otherwise."
<br><br>
Conflicts between alien races were of no concern to the human race. It wasn't a surprise that Dorothy did not have the exact information from the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"How can a warrior at the primary level of the Chaotic Source Realm kill Lord Shaw? That's incredible!" Zen was still skeptical of the Ear Mouse's story.
<br><br>
"As far as we know, the attacker relied on the Heart of Accomplice," the Ear Mouse said as it stared at the three hearts above the passageway.
<br><br>
"How much Other Shore Power the Heart of Accomplice contains? Lord Shaw was powerful. Not even two to three thousand divine megatons of force could hurt him," Dorothy remarked.
<br><br>
"He killed Lord Shaw by relying on the ability of the Heart of Accomplice, not the Other Shore Power," the Ear Mouse explained. "The heart can turn someone into an accomplice."
<br><br>
Lord Shaw was feeling invincible. After they had killed the leader of the Celestial Wolf race, the Dog Barbarian race was thirsty and ready to kill more.
<br><br>
But, the moment Lord Shaw walked into the tribe of the Celestial Wolf race, he heard a heartbeat.
<br><br>
Everyone else heard it too, including the rats lurking in the Star Wolf Province.
<br><br>
The crowd stirred in confusion and then, amidst the chaos, someone from the Celestial Wolf race stepped out and rushed towards Lord Shaw.
<br><br>
Lord Shaw merely snickered as this warrior approached. After all, he was only at the primary level of the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Lord Shaw snatched that man and tore him to pieces.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the man was killed, an Other Shore Token rose from his body. It was the Heart of Accomplice.
<br><br>
It hovered in the air and floated above Lord Shaw's head.
<br><br>
Unfamiliar with the object above him, Lord Shaw simply punched it away.
<br><br>
The Heart of Accomplice reeled a few million miles away. As it flew into the distance, the sound of the heartbeat grew louder. Everyone was bothered by it.
<br><br>
Then, after a few minutes, the heart returned and took its place once more above Lord Shaw's head.
<br><br>
Once more, he attempted to punch the heart, but it remained still. He tried and tried but kept on failing. It started beating faster and faster.
<br><br>
Soon, its beating became indecipherably fast and then, all of a sudden, it stopped. When it did, Lord Shaw's body floated into the air, limped, and crashed into the ground. He was dead.
<br><br>
Both his soul and body disappeared silently.
<br><br>
Supposedly, Lord Shaw's body and soul were extremely strong. His death came as a surprise to everyone.
<br><br>
"Lord Shaw killed himself. That man of the Celestial Wolf race chose him as an accomplice. After that man died, his accomplice must die as well," the Ear Mouse said.
<br><br>
"It sounds like the life contract of the Life Godly Way," Zen said.
<br><br>
The life contract also required contracted lives to be connected. If one died, the other would as well.
<br><br>
"No, not really. The life of contract can't compare to the Heart of Accomplice!" The Ear Mouse sneered.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in understanding.
<br><br>
The Godly Way's energy level was much lower. It made the life contract vulnerable. It was already difficult to work against ordinary warriors, let alone a warrior as strong as Lord Shaw.
<br><br>
The Heart of Accomplice could actually cause the death of a top master in the Source World. That made it absolutely terrifying.
<br><br>
"We investigated it for a long time. We even looked into the past of the attacker, but we could not find the origin of the Heart of Accomplice. It became regarded as a unique Other Shore Token in the Source World. But perhaps that isn't true anymore," the Ear Mouse elaborated.
<br><br>
There were now three Hearts of Accomplice. It was no longer considered unique.
<br><br>
"If what you said is true, then that makes the Other Shore Token truly terrifying," Dorothy said with a cautious look on her face.
<br><br>
With the Heart of Accomplice, an ordinary warrior could sacrifice their own life to kill a top warrior in the Source World. It was a very worthy deal.
<br><br>
Chapter 3272 Bloody Hands Whether or not the Heart of Accomplice was unique, its ability was undeniably terrifying.
<br><br>
The three Hearts of Accomplice could take the place of any three peerless masters.
<br><br>
It could be a remarkable killing weapon for any super force.
<br><br>
At this point, Zen, Dorothy, and the Ear Mice could feel the excitement bubbling up within.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice, in particular, were more excited wondering how many Hearts of Accomplice Zen would give them. A single one or all the three? Was there any way to fight for more? Just as Zen took another step forward, moving closer to the hearts, an enormous face suddenly appeared atop the wide passageway.
<br><br>
It was a hideous face—something like a piece of a dirty rag. Two dark holes served as its eyes.
<br><br>
"Aha!"
<br><br>
The ugly face whimpered as the blood vessels—what were formerly attached to the ceiling of the passageway—rolled up and down like spiraling vines, forming exactly eight bloody vortexes.
<br><br>
Well aware of how dangerous the nineteenth passageway was, Dorothy and the Ear Mice knew to be more vigilant once they sensed any foreign movement within the vicinity.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the bloody whirlpools, they all backed away while Zen stood unmoving, staring at them.
<br><br>
Splash! Eight enormous bloody hands reached out from the spinning whirlpools, moving towards Zen.
<br><br>
Even Zen felt the onset of a crisis as he sensed the bloody hands' aura.
<br><br>
While his body was undoubtedly strong on the Other Shore, he knew that he was by no means invincible.
<br><br>
A warrior's physical body couldn't simply enter the Other Shore since the banning of the Ancient God Cultivation Method.
<br><br>
Where had the Wild Gods all gone? Those who had entered the Other Shore with their physical bodies? A Wild God had limitless longevity.
<br><br>
At the time, there were as many Wild Gods as there were True Gods now, spreading across the entire Source World. But now, not a single Wild God could be found. Neither on the Other Shore nor in the Source World had anyone even seen a glimpse of a Wild God. It was indeed unreasonable.
<br><br>
Zen reckoned that some methods existed on the Other Shore that could suppress the Wild Gods.
<br><br>
In a flash, a bloody hand shot at Zen right before he managed to raise his hands and block the attack.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
In spite of his defense, the bloody hand still landed a blow on Zen's body, sending him flying across the passageway and onto a wall.
<br><br>
"As I suspected..."
<br><br>
Zen frowned as he leaned against the wall, taking a second to recover.
<br><br>
The bloody hand's power must have reached up to at least 300 divine megatons, going way beyond Zen's expectation.
<br><br>
"Thad..."
<br><br>
The Ear Mice's eyes were wide in surprise as they saw how Zen was thrown onto the wall. To them, Zen was someone undefeatable. But seeing how he failed to resist the bloody hand, the Ear Mice thought that perhaps no one in the entire Source World could defeat it.
<br><br>
'Zen...' Dorothy was lost in thought at the sight. It was the first time she had ever seen Zen suffer such a loss with his physical body.
<br><br>
"Hahaha…"
<br><br>
The faces in all sizes on the walls began making horrible sounds, indistinguishable from crying or laughing.
<br><br>
"I'm fine," Zen said as he pushed himself off from the wall and walked toward his attacker.
<br><br>
While normal warriors on the Other Shore couldn't have hoped to still be breathing after being attacked by 300 divine megatons of force, it only made Zen's blood surge.
<br><br>
It was a pity that he couldn't use the Shade Stone, or he could've easily taken 600 divine megatons of force—300 would have been nothing.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice found themselves releasing a breath of relief at Zen's response. If they had been attacked like that, their Souls of Light would have been destroyed instantly—the gap between a physical body and a Soul of Light was far too wide.
<br><br>
"Waaah…"
<br><br>
The great face above the passageway saw Zen approaching once again and howled in warning.
<br><br>
What else could it possibly do to frighten away the warrior? After taking a few more steps, Zen kicked off, his body rushing towards one of the bloody hands like a shot arrow.
<br><br>
Woosh! That bloody hand was about Zen's size. As he rushed up, it flipped to land another attack.
<br><br>
"Strength God Totem!"
<br><br>
Back when he was in the Flow Sword Sect, the Strength God Totem carried by Zen's inner world held such an explosive power that in a flash, all things in the room were immediately turned to dust by it.
<br><br>
Someone as strong as Zen didn't need to consume too much strength when dealing with a Soul of Light.
<br><br>
But when dealing with the Abyss Spirit knights, he had had to activate the Other Shore Token's power.
<br><br>
The bloody hands before him were not to be trifled with—Zen had no intention of underestimating them.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
Unable to use the Shade Stone, Zen didn't dare release the entirety of the Strength God Totem's power. It had already given out 500 divine megatons of force now.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore, such a great force was extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
Sensing the high pressure from the great power, the Ear Mice had no choice but to retreat—their Souls of Light were already feeling uncomfortable under the pressure and tension.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
When the bloody hand collided with Zen's physical body, a mass of blood plasma burst.
<br><br>
Zen had just caused a great hole in the center of the hand.
<br><br>
"Waah -"
<br><br>
It wailed in pain.
<br><br>
After being struck down, it began trembling as the face on the passageway cried out harshly. The other seven bloody hands then came at Zen from different directions in retaliation.
<br><br>
"That's what you get!"
<br><br>
Having the upper hand, Zen could feel the corners of his mouth turn up in amusement.
<br><br>
Since no one in the temple could leave the Other Shore, Zen was wellprepared before even entering the area. He had already filled many divine crystals into his Other Shore Tokens before even stepping inside.
<br><br>
So now, the Strength God Totem's power was abundant enough—Zen had no hesitation when drawing out the Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
He was going rapidly back and forth now, dodging every bloody hand and striking a great force from his every body part. His elbows and fists struck right through the bloody hands, breaking their wrists with every hit.
<br><br>
The face atop the passage couldn't stop shrieking in pain.
<br><br>
"Ahahah..."
<br><br>
Soon enough, Zen had broken the eight bloody hands.
<br><br>
Six of them were drawn into the blood vortexes, while two had been cut off cleanly, wriggling on the ground like a lizard's tail. Gradually, they lost all vitality.
<br><br>
"Done!"
<br><br>
Zen called in triumph as he turned back to Dorothy.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice then came out of hiding, squeaking as they flittered to Zen.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Take back the two bloody hands too!" one of the Ear Mice said as it pulled out its space ring.
<br><br>
"Wait," Zen called out suddenly, "I cut those hands, so I will take them."
<br><br>
When the Ear Mice had collected those broken bones earlier, neither Zen nor Dorothy felt the need to say anything about it. The two weren't there to collect bones, after all. They cared nothing about the soul pills or divine crystals that the Ear Mice were crazy about.
<br><br>
Although Zen decided to turn a blind eye to the bones the Ear Mice had picked up, the two bloody hands were both rare and precious—Zen couldn't simply hand them over.
<br><br>
Chapter 3273 The Pattern It was extremely difficult for the Ear Mice to defeat the bloody hands alone.
<br><br>
Zen could claim credit for the success, so it was reasonable that he took the hands away.
<br><br>
"Dorothy," Zen called out.
<br><br>
He did not need to explain further, for Dorothy understood what he wanted.
<br><br>
She nodded and walked over to the bloody hands, using the space ring to absorb them.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice wisely stayed silent, deciding it would be best not to say anything more.
<br><br>
After Dorothy had taken care of the bloody hands, they turned their focus back to the three hearts at the top of the passageway.
<br><br>
"I wonder how the Hearts of Accomplice should be distributed," said one of the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
"Thad, you don't need the Hearts of Accomplice. If you use it, you'd have to sacrifice yourself," another Ear Mouse squeaked. "How about we keep the three hearts, and after the auction, we give half of the soul pills to you?"
<br><br>
Only the Ear Mice had the cheek to speak so shamelessly.
<br><br>
"Shame on you!" Dorothy said, shaking her head.
<br><br>
Zen was firm. "Dorothy and I will each get one, and the third one belongs to you."
<br><br>
It was a statement of fact, not a proposal. He did not need the approval of the Ear Mice to take as many of the hearts as he wanted.
<br><br>
His cooperation with the Ear Mice had mainly been about breaking down the wall. Beyond that, they were each on their own. What the Ear Mice would be able to obtain from the Grand Sky Temple depended on their own abilities.
<br><br>
Without Zen, the Ear Mice wouldn't have even made it through the 19th passageway, let alone reached these three Hearts of Accomplice.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race, for instance, was far stronger than the Ear Mouse race—but they had been trapped in the walls of the passageway, never to be reborn.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice squeaked reluctantly in agreement with Zen's words.
<br><br>
After all, they had no choice but to accept it.
<br><br>
Zen braced himself and leaped into the air, wrapping his arms around one of the hearts.
<br><br>
He gathered his strength and dragged the heart down, slowly but steadily disconnecting it from the blood vessels above it.
<br><br>
There was a beating, pulsing sound as the vessels of the heart strained with Zen's efforts.
<br><br>
Once Zen had succeeded in pulling the heart down, it still kept beating and bleeding. Zen and the others stood in the passageway and observed as the heart began to heal itself rapidly, until eventually the blood stopped flowing from the rips where it had been torn free.
<br><br>
Zen gave the heart to Dorothy.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice watched morosely as Dorothy put it into the space ring.
<br><br>
Then Zen pulled down the second and third hearts from above them. He handed Dorothy one more heart, and then gave the last one to the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
All of them were pleased that the harvest had been good in the 19th passageway, even though the Ear Mice would have preferred a bigger share of the loot. However, Zen was not yet contented. Neither the bloody hands nor the Hearts of Accomplice were suitable for his needs.
<br><br>
Certainly the Heart of Accomplice was strong, but one had to sacrifice themselves if they wanted to use it. This kind of ability could only be used as a last resort.
<br><br>
Zen knew that if he integrated with the Heart of Accomplice, it would take up a Truth of Godly Way. He wasn't sure if he wanted to do that. After all, at this point he could only integrate with three Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had not evaluated the two bloody hands, but Zen estimated them to be merely fourth-grade Other Shore Tokens. That level did not meet his requirements.
<br><br>
As they left, Zen looked up at the huge face on the ceiling of the passageway.
<br><br>
The enormous face was still screwed up, whining, but they could not tell what it was trying to say. Like the other faces, it became powerless after losing its hands.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the 11th passageway was entirely lined with small skeletons, about half the size of an average man. Their bones were dusty and shadowed.
<br><br>
The skeletons were positioned with their backs to the walls. Upon closer inspection, the spines and legs seemed to be embedded into the walls, as if they were a part of the walls and not just leaning against them.
<br><br>
The hollow eye sockets in each skull glowed with faint, flickering lights as several Souls of Light entered the passageway.
<br><br>
"Princess Elvinia, slow down," Chaim warned.
<br><br>
Elvinia had gone through an ordeal at the hands of the Bearing race at the gate of the Grand Sky Temple. However, instead of deterring her, it only made her even more determined to keep pressing forward.
<br><br>
"I'm fine," Elvinia replied coldly.
<br><br>
A faint blue light still glimmered at her feet. It was the Soul Binding Thread from the Bearing race.
<br><br>
No one in the Grand Sky Temple would be able to leave the Other Shore, so the Soul Binding Thread was redundant. Elvinia was unconcerned with it, for after some time, it would lose its effect on its own.
<br><br>
Suddenly, there was a series of creaking sounds.
<br><br>
As the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace walked deeper into the passageway, the jaws of one of the skeletons suddenly fell open. A thin centipede emerged from its open mouth.
<br><br>
"Watch out!" said Chaim, rapidly moving towards Elvinia.
<br><br>
He had seen the centipede and his instincts were alerted.
<br><br>
Elvinia suddenly leaped and waved her right hand in the air. A wave of golden light struck the centipede. Elvinia had launched the whip transformed by the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. In a moment, the centipede turned to ashes on the floor.
<br><br>
"You're too timid," Elvinia said to Chaim, shaking her head.
<br><br>
She used to think that Chaim was one of the only two worthy opponents in the Oneness Sky Palace, but her opinion of him was changing.
<br><br>
Chaim saw what she was thinking and shrugged, forcing a smile.
<br><br>
He thought rather bitterly that he was only jumpy because Elvinia was always so reckless. The Grand Sky Temple was wholly unfamiliar territory, and it would be wiser to proceed with caution. Any carelessness could lead to death.
<br><br>
There was a clicking sound, and a faint cry sounded from behind Chaim and Elvinia. They turned.
<br><br>
A disciple had been bitten on the leg by a centipede.
<br><br>
His Soul of Light had been glowing with a strong purple aura, but as they stared in horror, his soul darkened and turned to black. He didn't even have time to say anything before his Soul of Light, now a cloud of black smoke, drifted lifelessly to the top of the passageway.
<br><br>
Everyone began speaking at once. "Watch out!"
<br><br>
"Be careful of the centipedes!" "The centipedes are poisonous!"
<br><br>
"Look! The skeletons have opened their mouths!"
<br><br>
Indeed, every single skeleton along the passageway had let their jaws fall open, and many centipedes swarmed out. They crawled along the walls and the ground towards the Souls of Light that had invaded the passageway.
<br><br>
The fate of the bitten disciple had left everyone terrified.
<br><br>
"Follow me," said Elvinia decisively.
<br><br>
She leaped forward, waving her hands and flinging out whips of golden light that lashed mercilessly at the centipedes. The swarming, crawling mass of centipedes turned to ashes. Chaim and the other disciples pressed close to her back, following her as she moved forward.
<br><br>
In the 7th passageway, a human girl carefully walked forward. She was under the protection of her companions.
<br><br>
Because there were only a few of them in the group, and their collective strength was relatively weak, they had chosen the seventh passageway which was said to be the easiest one.
<br><br>
In fact, the vast majority of the other races had also chosen this passageway.
<br><br>
Since they had passed through first, they had already cleared out the obstacles along the way. So this group, coming through last, no longer faced any danger.
<br><br>
Every hundred feet or so, one of them would squat in a corner and draw a pattern on the wall using his or her soul force.
<br><br>
"How many patterns have we drawn by now?" one of them asked.
<br><br>
"437. We're only about halfway through," answered the man who drew the pattern.
<br><br>
Chapter 3274 The Courtyard "That clue should be right. Come on!" one of the human Souls of Light called out.
<br><br>
"But if it is, that'll prove the Ear Mice are wrong, won't it?" said the human girl.
<br><br>
Her brother nodded. "Yes. The Ear Mice want to use that corporeal body to destroy the wall, but it'll be a disaster—you can't even imagine."
<br><br>
"Will they all die? But what about the corporeal body?" the girl then eagerly asked.
<br><br>
"He will die too," said the little girl's brother without so much as a change in tone.
<br><br>
At that, the human girl's face sank.
<br><br>
When she heard the man mention the Nine Li race, something pinched her heart—she had a feeling he had something to do with them.
<br><br>
It was a pity to realize he would die in the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
"Should I warn him?" she suggested.
<br><br>
But her brother only sneered. "Would he even believe our words? How are we going to explain where this clue came from? Tell him we're descendants of the Nine Li race and expose all our identities?"
<br><br>
That shut her up.
<br><br>
After the Nine Li race suffered the massacre, they all went into hiding.
<br><br>
Although they had finally settled down after all those years, they still had to live with great caution.
<br><br>
On the Other Shore, it was relatively easy for them to keep their identities secret, allowing them to cultivate without worry. But once one of them was exposed, they would all be put in danger.
<br><br>
As the group advanced, they drew peculiar patterns along the passageway.
<br><br>
Although some of the monsters there had been eliminated by the warriors ahead, they were still moving all too slowly. It was a while before a faint cyan light appeared before them.
<br><br>
Several fist-sized ghosts then emerged from both sides of the passageway.
<br><br>
As they were in the seventh passageway, which was considered the simplest one, the cyan ghosts were not to be trifled with.
<br><br>
Many other Souls of Light had been extinguished by these cyan ghosts in that particular passageway. The survivors had to fight for their lives just to get through.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
A group of bees flew right at those Nine Li members as the ghosts emerged from the walls.
<br><br>
"Bro..."
<br><br>
The aura had the girl panicking immediately.
<br><br>
"Aariv, bring out the powder!"
<br><br>
Her brother, on the other hand, seemed rather calm. The group had made full preparations, after all. Even though it was their first trip to the Grand Sky Temple, they were quite familiar with this passageway, and even the ghosts, to an extent.
<br><br>
One of them pulled out some silver powder from his space ring. Soon after, the powder covered the entire crowd, triggering a bright-silver glow around their souls.
<br><br>
Then, something strange happened—it was as though the cyan ghosts had lost their minds.
<br><br>
Clearly, they could feel the breath of these Souls of Light, but they couldn't seem to find them, even in that proximity. All they could do was hover above their heads.
<br><br>
"The Silver Scales Powder proves to be very effective," Aariv said with a smile.
<br><br>
They moved forward, unbothered by the cyan ghosts above them. After moving another hundred feet forward, a pattern was drawn once again.
<br><br>
After using the Silver Scales Powder to protect themselves, they decided to only leave one person behind to draw the pattern so the rest could move on quickly.
<br><br>
After a long while, everyone caught up and finally arrived at the end of the passageway.
<br><br>
"This is it, the 949th. The last one," one of the men sighed and squatted down to draw the final pattern.
<br><br>
After that, the girl's brother gave the command. "All of you, step back."
<br><br>
With that, he unfolded his palm, revealing thin, long lines drawn in the middle. The pattern they formed was similar to the Other Shore Key.
<br><br>
When he put his palm on the last pattern, the first-drawn pattern at the entrance of the seventh passageway began shining with a faint golden light.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The first pattern...
<br><br>
The second pattern...
<br><br>
The third pattern...
<br><br>
Soon, the entire passageway began glowing, forming a long chain tens of thousands of feet long.
<br><br>
At last, after the 949th pattern lit up, the entire passageway began trembling violently.
<br><br>
The vibrations reached the entire Grand Sky Temple—even the warriors who had passed through the passageways could feel them.
<br><br>
"It's coming from the back!"
<br><br>
"Is the passageway collapsing?"
<br><br>
"Forget it. We've come in anyway…"
<br><br>
"But we still need to go back!"
<br><br>
No one was willing to go back for further investigation.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"
<br><br>
By then, the entire seventh passageway was shaking. The entire group began wobbling left and right. The cyan ghosts above their heads flew into the walls instantly.
<br><br>
The vibrations lasted for a while until the two walls began shrinking and narrowing. Simultaneously, a dull sound echoed throughout the passageway before a gate in the wall opened automatically.
<br><br>
Whether it was the little girl or the others, their eyes began gleaming with excitement.
<br><br>
Inside the gate stood a small statue—it was the same as what was in the hall of the Grand Sky Temple, but it held a few different details. On its front were three oval pieces of jade.
<br><br>
The pieces were each a different color—cyan, red, and purple.
<br><br>
At the sight, the little girl's brother bowed to the statue. "The seventh god in the Grand Sky race! Please forgive me for disturbing you!"
<br><br>
Each of the nineteen passageways in the Grand Sky Temple represented one of the nineteen gods of the Grand Sky race.
<br><br>
The man then strode through the door and took out the three jade stones.
<br><br>
With that, the gate closed with a cracking sound as it sunk into the wall, leaving no trace.
<br><br>
After leaving the 19th passageway, Zen and Dorothy found themselves walking down a row of stairs.
<br><br>
At this point, they had reached the middle of the Grand Sky Temple. An open, wide courtyard came into view, where a variety of Other Shore plants were growing. A huge willow in the middle of it drew their attention instantly.
<br><br>
"What are they doing?" Zen examined the willow and asked curiously.
<br><br>
Hundreds of branches hung from the willow—at the end of each was a nonhuman Soul of Light, greedily sucking on it.
<br><br>
"They are sucking on the essence of the holy willow," whispered an Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
Before something went wrong in the Dark Region, one of the reason why the Souls of Light on the Other Shore came to the Grand Sky Temple was for the willow.
<br><br>
The effect of the holy willow's essence was similar to that of the soul crystal, probably even better.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light from different races rushed through the passageways just to claim a branch to gain the essence from—it was a limited resource.
<br><br>
All the Souls of Light that failed to take up a branch were wandering around in the courtyard instead. Certain rare plants could make for special Other Shore Tokens—if they were lucky, they could nab something.
<br><br>
Chapter 3275 The Thin Wall Zen had already obtained a great deal of soul crystal, so the willow did not interest him at all.
<br><br>
They went down the steps and crossed the path through the middle of the courtyard.
<br><br>
There were other Souls of Light sucking the willow essence and looking for the Other Shore Tokens in the courtyard. They all focused their eyes on Zen as he walked by.
<br><br>
They had spent one million soul pills to enter the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
For that price, just a little walk in the courtyard was definitely not enough.
<br><br>
Most Souls of Light were waiting here, although some had already crossed the courtyard to look for the way leading to the Dark Region themselves.
<br><br>
The further end of the temple was incredibly dangerous. They'd be dancing with death if they attempted to explore it blindly, without any assistance.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had opened the door to the Grand Sky Temple and it seemed as though Zen had some sort of deal with them. Believing they must have concocted some great plan, most of them had stayed back to follow behind them.
<br><br>
And so, when they passed through the courtyard, everyone sucking the willow essence and searching for Other Shore Tokens stopped what they were doing and shuffled closer to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen paid them no mind and let them follow on, but the Ear Mice were quite displeased.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice did not want to go along with these Souls of Light of other races, so they had opted to enter the Grand Sky Temple last.
<br><br>
They hadn't expected the Souls of Light to be so lazy and incompetent.
<br><br>
They had no plan to search for the treasures themselves. All they wanted was to follow them and reap the rewards of their labor.
<br><br>
One of the Ear Mice turned and yelled back at the Souls of Light with annoyance, "Squeak! Don't follow us!"
<br><br>
Outside the Grand Sky Temple, the Ear Mice had the final say.
<br><br>
After all, they had opened the door and set powerful restrictions.
<br><br>
But inside the temple, the other races gave them no respect.
<br><br>
"Hey, mice, you need to remember one thing; we have paid the soul pills!"
<br><br>
"The temple is not yours. You just opened the door. I can go wherever I please and I am not following you!"
<br><br>
"That's right! It just so happens we're heading in the same direction!"
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of the other races spoke out one after another. Their shameless words left the Ear Mice speechless and with no choice but to turn to Zen for help. "Thad, could you drive all these people away?"
<br><br>
Zen was the only one they could count on in the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head and laughed. "They have a point. I mean, they did pay one million soul pills."
<br><br>
"Squeak!"
<br><br>
The Ear Mice steamed in frustration. If they had known it would be this way, they would not have sold the tickets and Zen would have only taken them to the temple.
<br><br>
They might have earned a lot of soul pills, but entering the Dark Region was far more important.
<br><br>
Now they were stuck with these Souls of Light following them whether they liked it or not.
<br><br>
There were six paths in the back of the courtyard, which led to the six towers behind the Grand Sky Temple. The towers were clearly visible from outside the temple.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice asked Zen to take the leftmost path. After a short while, they entered a tower.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of the other races followed them closely.
<br><br>
The six towers behind the Grand Sky Temple were known as the six treasures.
<br><br>
Each tower had twenty-nine floors. The higher the floor, the more challenging it would prove.
<br><br>
Once they had entered the tower, an Ear Mouse explained to Zen, "So far, no one has been able to climb to the top of the tower. Squeak!"
<br><br>
"There must be a sixth-grade Other Shore Token at the top!"
<br><br>
"I made it to the 16th floor before I could take no more. I obtained a fifthgrade Other Shore Token there!"
<br><br>
"Oh my God, you have been to the 16th floor? That's amazing!"
<br><br>
The other races chimed in while the Ear Mouse spoke earnestly to Zen.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse turned its head irritated and said, "You know, there are some truly wonderful treasures at the top of the tower. Don't let this opportunity pass. Go up there and obtain all the incredible rewards!"
<br><br>
"I'll explore the tower next time, ha-ha!"
<br><br>
"My Soul of Light is not in a good condition, so I can't go up there."
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of the other races were set on following Zen. The Ear Mouse's tricks would not change their minds.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice shook their heads and began chattering among themselves. It seemed as if they knew there was no getting rid of them and they'd have to take some other course of action.
<br><br>
One of the Ear Mice walked up to the edge of the tower. It raised its tail and turned it into a flat blade. The Ear Mouse then cut a small square into the ground using its tail blade.
<br><br>
Stabbing its tail into the square, it lifted up a small door that covered a passageway leading downward.
<br><br>
"There is a door here!"
<br><br>
"Does it lead to the underground?"
<br><br>
"I've been wondering all this time how one would get to that section behind the temple. I never imagined it was hidden inside the first tower!"
<br><br>
This secret belonged only to the Ear Mice. Understandably, the other races were astonished by this discovery.
<br><br>
With the small door lifted, a passageway revealed itself.
<br><br>
The others didn't rush in. Instead, they looked on quietly as Zen, Dorothy, and the Ear Mice entered one by one.
<br><br>
As soon as they had gone through, everyone else rushed in chaotically, even fighting their way through if they had to.
<br><br>
Zen could only shake his head when he heard the ruckus coming from behind him.
<br><br>
The underground passageway was not long, only over a thousand feet. At the end of it was a basement where a row of large oddly shaped stones were placed.
<br><br>
The stones were all very smooth, except for some oval hollows in the center. It seemed as though something had once been embedded in the sunken parts, but they were no longer here.
<br><br>
Zen and his group arrived at the basement, followed shortly after by over one thousand Souls of Light of the other races.
<br><br>
The basement would have been spacious were it not for the more than a thousand creatures crowding it.
<br><br>
One of the Ear Mice said to Zen, "Squeak! It is this wall! If you break this wall, we can enter the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
Hearing 'the Dark Region' excited everyone. This was what they had come for.
<br><br>
"It is this wall," Zen repeated.
<br><br>
He walked up to the wall and gently scratched the surface. The wall began to glow with a metallic luster.
<br><br>
The material of the wall was similar to that of the Grand Sky Temple. That would mean it should be made of some sort of mixed metal.
<br><br>
Zen tapped the wall lightly and a crisp echo rang throughout the basement.
<br><br>
From that sound it was clear the Ear Mice had not lied; the wall was indeed very thin.
<br><br>
Phew! Facing the wall, Zen took a step back and gathered power within his hand.
<br><br>
He clenched it into a fist and unleashed a heavy blow to the wall.
<br><br>
Chapter 3276 Terrifying Armors "Bang!"
<br><br>
Zen's punch to the wall resulted in a dull sound. But unlike an ordinary stone wall, it didn't break into pieces.
<br><br>
The metal wall was unusually tenacious—Zen's punch only made an impression on the surface.
<br><br>
"It didn't break!"
<br><br>
"Not enough!"
<br><br>
"But that punch was strong! He'll break it after a few more."
<br><br>
The over a thousand Souls of Light felt nerves seeping in, especially the Ear Mice.
<br><br>
When they last explored the place, they had tried all sorts of methods, using even taboo power. But their souls were simply too weak, resulting in failure. They could only turn back in the end.
<br><br>
But with just a punch, Zen had dented the wall. The Ear Mice weren't disappointed.
<br><br>
'It's tougher than I thought…' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
Without much hesitation, Zen darted forward, his legs bending. Once again, he threw a punch to the wall.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
And with another dull sound, the dent sank further inward by two inches.
<br><br>
"Come on!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Every hit made the entire tower vibrate from the shock.
<br><br>
Above the basement stood several Nine Li people who could clearly feel the tremors from below.
<br><br>
"Brother, he's really smashing the wall in," remarked the human girl.
<br><br>
"Let's wait and see. We can't go down there until they're all dead," her brother responded.
<br><br>
The girl was left conflicted.
<br><br>
Though she was still a little worried about the physical body's safety, she couldn't go down and stop the man in the current situation.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice wouldn't just let her go down, let alone a thousand Souls of Light of alien races.
<br><br>
"We'd better retreat. We don't want to get caught up in the mess," one of them suggested.
<br><br>
And so the human girl could only follow them out the passageway.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The metal wall had sunk deeper and deeper until thumb-sized cracks began appearing on its surface.
<br><br>
The other side of the wall was engraved with circular patterns—the strange markings spread across the wall all the way to the platforms on both sides where two livid armors stood.
<br><br>
They were each about the height of a person, a rusty saber in each hand— they gave off a sinister and intrepid aura, especially with chains as thick as rods wrapping around the armors.
<br><br>
For years, they stood motionless, experiencing many vicissitudes of life.
<br><br>
Since the two were placed at the end of the Grand Sky Temple, surrounded by the Dark Region, no race had come to know of their existence.
<br><br>
Finally, the wall cracked when Zen threw more than 20 punches in a row.
<br><br>
At this moment, all the Souls of Light of the alien races craned their necks, trying to catch a glimpse of what was behind the wall through the cracks.
<br><br>
None of them, not even Zen or the Ear Mice had any idea what lay behind the wall.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Finally, the patterns on the other side of the wall shattered.
<br><br>
As they were broken, the light continued spreading through the remaining patterns to the platforms where the chains wrapping around the armors were also broken to pieces, inch by inch.
<br><br>
"Buzz!" "Buzz!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, two spots of bright red light flickered from under the armors' headgear, as though the eyes hidden in the darkness opened wide.
<br><br>
Free from the chains' restriction, the armors came back to life and jumped right off the platforms.
<br><br>
"Clang!"
<br><br>
"Clang!"
<br><br>
"Clang!"
<br><br>
The figures were so heavy that the ground shook with every step they took.
<br><br>
"What's that sound?"
<br><br>
"Something's approaching the wall!"
<br><br>
"What is it..."
<br><br>
Curiosity spread among the Souls of Light, but the cracks in the wall were too narrow for anyone to see clearly what was behind them.
<br><br>
Even Zen, standing at the front of the crowd, couldn't get a clear look.
<br><br>
But the sound of heavy footsteps had made Zen grow vigilant. Frowning, he moved back slowly.
<br><br>
"Clang! Clang! Clang..."
<br><br>
The sounds began accelerating until something seemed to start pushing against the wall from the other side.
<br><br>
"Sizzle!"
<br><br>
At that moment, everyone heard a kind of metallic, ear-piercing sound.
<br><br>
Rusty sabers were piercing the wall.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen was quick enough to retreat when he saw the bulging wall.
<br><br>
His body would have been pierced, otherwise.
<br><br>
"Sizzle, sizzle..."
<br><br>
Four rusty sabers began twisting until they made circles in the wall. From the holes emerged the two sinister armors—they rushed right at the Souls of Light in the basement.
<br><br>
"Retreat!"
<br><br>
Without even having time to process the situation, Zen pulled on Dorothy and rushed back.
<br><br>
He moved so quickly that the Souls of Light behind him were knocked out of balance.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light that had gathered in the basement were left in a fit of chaos—they scrambled up the passageway, jamming it in the process.
<br><br>
"Hurry up!"
<br><br>
"What are those things?"
<br><br>
"It's a trap, a trap!"
<br><br>
"Clang!"
<br><br>
The figures jumped up in the basement and smashed into the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Given the very weight of the armors, how could the Souls of Light possibly survive an attack from them? They were easily crushed to death. Even those that had been slightly grazed just turned into dust.
<br><br>
No matter how strong the Souls of Light were, they were completely vulnerable in front of the armors.
<br><br>
Whines and screams resounded in the basement—it had become a terrifying scene of carnage.
<br><br>
Everyone began fending for only themselves—how could they worry about any other Souls of Light in that situation? Some even began killing their own kind just to free up the passageway.
<br><br>
Zen and Dorothy were in the same boat, rushing toward the free path.
<br><br>
Because he led the way with his physical body, the Souls of Light posed no hindrance.
<br><br>
Within a mere six seconds, he and Dorothy had arrived at the entrance. But just as Zen took another step forward, something broke the surface above them.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The entire passageway collapsed without a sign, cutting off everyone's one chance of surviving.
<br><br>
'Is it really a trap? Or did the Ear Mice just get something wrong?' A thought flashed through Zen's mind.
<br><br>
"The passageway is broken!"
<br><br>
"Ahhh! Help!"
<br><br>
"It's going to kill me!"
<br><br>
The lost path put all the Souls of Light in despair.
<br><br>
It wasn't a wide basement, after all, and they were all crammed in the space.
<br><br>
The two armors holding the rusty sabers merely spun and killed off anything in close proximity. They seemed to glide from left to right like a metal storm.
<br><br>
Any Soul of Light caught in the calamity was killed instantly.
<br><br>
"Zen... I'm scared!"
<br><br>
Dorothy gripped his hand extremely tightly as her eyes filled with fear.
<br><br>
Mere seconds had passed since the armors broke through the wall, but only half of the Souls of Light were left.
<br><br>
Because they were in the temple, they had no way to leave the Other Shore —they were in an even more dangerous situation than in the Sea of Truth.
<br><br>
At this point, it seemed as though they truly had nowhere to escape.
<br><br>
Chapter 3277 Climb Up Just as Zen was about to open his mouth and say something to comfort Dorothy, one of the armors suddenly began making its way towards them.
<br><br>
Zen immediately grabbed Dorothy and threw her to a corner where he knew she'd be safe against the oncoming enemy.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! The armor was fast and the unfortunate Souls of Light that stood in its way were practically ripped to shreds. In a blink of an eye, it was already in front of Zen.
<br><br>
"Stop!" Zen screamed.
<br><br>
He bent down and pounced towards the floor, avoiding the two, rusty, rotating sabers and slamming himself onto one of the armor's feet.
<br><br>
Zen spared no force from his attack, imparting five to six hundred divine megatons of force as he collided with the armor.
<br><br>
Despite the strength and equivalent danger this armor posed, Zen wasn't too worried about it since he figured that he was in equal footing with the enemy.
<br><br>
The collision should've shaken its center of balance, making it fall to the ground. It should give him an advantage and let him obliterate this armor.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, what he expected to happen, did not happen.
<br><br>
Bang! The impact from hitting the armor rebounded towards Zen and he felt a sharp sting of pain on his shoulder before it went numb. Contrary to his former expectations, this armor was actually far stronger than his own body.
<br><br>
There was no way he could use the Shade Stone to strengthen his body here on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
How in the world were there such strong armors here in Stage Thirteen? With his shoulder numb, the regret of underestimating his opponent only began to settle in his bones. However, before he could fully immerse himself in his misery, a buzzing sound from above reminded him that he was still in the middle of a fight as a rusty saber headed towards him, ready to chop his head off.
<br><br>
Zen swiftly rolled out of the way and, instead of his head, the saber slashed at the floor and created a long, deep crack.
<br><br>
The floor was of a faint metallic color and Zen knew that the material it was made of wasn't something he could destroy even if he exerted his full strength. Seeing that the rusty saber easily destroyed a part of it let him know that he had greatly underestimated the power of his armor opponent.
<br><br>
Buzz! The two red spots inside the armor's head flickered. The rusty sabers in its hands continued to come at Zen, getting faster and faster with each slash! Cre-ka-rack! It came at him with six to seven strikes in a row and Zen had no other choice but to avoid it by continuously rolling on the floor.
<br><br>
In the end, however, he was still too slow. He felt a sudden, stinging pain on his back as one of the sabers caught up with him, creating a horrible gash.
<br><br>
Buzz! Despite having landed a hit on Zen, the armor was still a bit dejected that all it could give him was that gash. With that, it gave up on going after the other Souls of Light and focused solely on Zen instead.
<br><br>
"Zen! Fall back!" Dorothy shouted.
<br><br>
She had been thrown into the corner and kept safe, but she still felt incredibly nervous with Zen in danger like this.
<br><br>
There was no way he could keep rolling out of the armor's grasp indefinitely. The basement wasn't very wide and the fact that the armor only went faster each time its attacks were avoided meant that Zen only had so much time until it caught up with him.
<br><br>
Even the members of the Nine Li race that stood above could hear those below crying for help.
<br><br>
"Poor things!" the human girl exclaimed. She didn't have the heart to keep listening.
<br><br>
Most of the Souls of Light trapped in the basement were non-human but it was not easy for them to cultivate to this level. There was no other fate that awaited them save for a miserable end here in the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"This is the price they have to pay for their greed," her brother remarked viciously.
<br><br>
The entrance to the Dark Region was undoubtedly a great temptation.
<br><br>
In order to ascend to the higher stages, these Souls of Light took this rare opportunity that presented itself to them.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, it ultimately led to their doom.
<br><br>
Dorothy could only back herself up into the wall and watch as Zen dodged his inevitable death, one slash at a time. She let out a cry each time the saber ventured too close to his body.
<br><br>
It was a deadly dance between Zen and his opponent. The worst thing was that Dorothy couldn't really do anything but watch.
<br><br>
Other Souls of Light also tried to attack the two armors but if Zen's strong body barely made a dent, then what more their feeble soul attacks? Dorothy could only watch in bated breath as Zen continued to dodge for his survival. She was so caught up in keeping him in her sight that she completely forgot about her own safety.
<br><br>
Once all the souls on the right had been slaughtered, the other armor finally noticed Dorothy in the corner. Taking advantage of her vulnerable state, the armor lunged towards her! Zen could hardly protect himself but he still kept an eye on Dorothy.
<br><br>
Noticing the other armor charging towards her, he quickly ran from his spot and blocked its way. Despite knowing his strength was useless against his enemies, Zen still reeled back his feet and threw a punch.
<br><br>
BANG! His punch hit the armor's elbow, tilting it back slightly. Zen, on the other hand, felt as if his hand was breaking.
<br><br>
The young man, unfortunately, didn't have the luxury to linger on his injury.
<br><br>
With the armor sent back a bit, Zen quickly rushed past and headed straight towards Dorothy. He picked her up, stamped his feet on the wall, and flipped into the air! His movements pushed the two of them seventy to eighty feet away, not really enough to take them fully out of danger's way.
<br><br>
The two armors remained in hot pursuit and chased after Zen.
<br><br>
"They're coming at us!" Dorothy exclaimed in panic.
<br><br>
Zen continued to run, zigzagging his way out of enemy clutches all the while continuously trying to think of a way to escape their current predicament.
<br><br>
Staying in the basement meant absolute death for both of them. It was in this face of impending doom that Zen raised his gaze and looked up at the wall.
<br><br>
Stricken with a bright idea, his face suddenly lit up with anticipation. "Yes! This will work!"
<br><br>
Without explaining his plan nor showing any slight hesitation in its effectiveness, Zen rushed up to the right wall and activated his power.
<br><br>
With some sharp kicks, Zen climbed over one hundred feet in an instant, as if he was a nimble gecko and not a human.
<br><br>
However, the basement walls were over a thousand feet high. There was no way to escape unless he flew which wasn't really an option here in the Other Shore. Zen was bound to fall given that there were no footholds in the air.
<br><br>
"Hold onto me!" he ordered Dorothy.
<br><br>
He shifted Dorothy on his back and redirected all his power in his right hand. He reeled back his palm and slammed it right into the wall.
<br><br>
Dorothy didn't know how, but Zen managed to stab four fingers into the wall, giving him an anchor point and preventing them from falling.
<br><br>
The two of them hung on the wall, out of reach from below but still very much in danger.
<br><br>
The two armors that had been chasing Zen could only look up in confusion.
<br><br>
The red lights in their heads flashed and they tried to jump up after him but failed miserably. It was comedic to a degree as they watched the two armors smack their bodies onto the wall in an attempt to reach them.
<br><br>
There were two loud thuds as the armors jumped.
<br><br>
However, both fell rather quickly.
<br><br>
Even if they contained great power, these two armors were quite heavy.
<br><br>
They couldn't even manage to lift themselves an inch above the ground, let alone reach Zen and Dorothy from such a high place.
<br><br>
Dorothy, who had previously been scared witless for their lives, found herself laughing. "Ha! They can't catch us!"
<br><br>
Zen nodded in relief. "Yes. They can't touch us now."
<br><br>
The two armors tried to jump a few more times but to no avail. After realizing that they were not going to be able to reach their prey, they finally chose to give up.
<br><br>
A large number of Souls of Light remained in the basement. The two armors' attention had been focused on Zen earlier, giving the souls some time to relax and take a breather. However, Zen was now unreachable and the two armors turned towards them again.
<br><br>
Five minutes passed.
<br><br>
The basement, once filled to the brim with Souls of Light, stood empty.
<br><br>
Dorothy and Zen were the only survivors.
<br><br>
Granted that was mostly because they hung a hundred feet high, away from the dreadful place that was the bottom of the basement.
<br><br>
"Will they leave?" Dorothy asked, looking down at the armors that remained below.
<br><br>
"They will since they won't be able to reach us," Zen assured her with confidence.
<br><br>
However, as soon as he said that, the two armors approached the wall once again.
<br><br>
This time though, instead of trying to jump, they stabbed their sabers onto the wall.
<br><br>
The two armors were attempting to climb up to finally get rid of the remaining survivors.
<br><br>
"Ah, it seems they're more persistent than I thought," Zen said, shaking his head and revealing a wry smile.
<br><br>
Chapter 3278 Benefactor Clank! Clank! Clank! Zen and Dorothy hung suspended against a wall over a hundred feet above ground. Below them, two armors rapidly followed them. They had already climbed eighty to ninety feet in the twinkling of an eye.
<br><br>
Dorothy was clinging onto Zen's body, her mind sifting through their options.
<br><br>
She suddenly remembered her Necklace of Mystic Soul. It flashed and a soul sword shot down.
<br><br>
Clank! Clank! Clank! The soul sword worked incredibly against the Souls of Light, but it was incapable of harming the armors. It merely clanked and fell.
<br><br>
The armors were getting closer. Dorothy was beginning to panic. "It's useless," she remarked while looking at the soul sword. "They are too powerful."
<br><br>
Zen stared at the armors and then looked up.
<br><br>
There was a passageway leading to the exit. Unfortunately, most of it had collapsed. There was, however, a small hole that remained uncovered.
<br><br>
When Zen saw it, he turned to look at Dorothy. "Don't be discouraged," he said. "We don't need to defeat them. Let's escape."
<br><br>
"How?" Dorothy asked.
<br><br>
"You can count on me," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
Clank! Clank! Clank! Before they could escape, the armors had caught up and were nearing Zen's feet.
<br><br>
Their two hands made them look like human beings. Since they thrust their rusty sabers into the wall, they wouldn't be able to launch an attack.
<br><br>
Unlike humans, they were unable to make wise decisions.
<br><br>
When they were five feet below Zen, Zen said, "Hold tight!"
<br><br>
Dorothy wrapped her arms around Zen's neck, feeling that she was falling.
<br><br>
Zen stepped on the shoulders of an armor with full might and jumped up.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He jumped more than a hundred feet and was able to stab his hand into the wall again.
<br><br>
Dorothy's heart was pounding against her chest. When they were finally safely hanging against the wall again, she heaved a long sigh of relief.
<br><br>
The two armors were slow to respond. When they realized what happened, their eyes flashed red and they started climbing faster.
<br><br>
Zen looked at them calmly.
<br><br>
He initially wanted to bust the armors out of their way, but he wasn't able to do that. So he opted to use them as leverage to help them climb higher.
<br><br>
When the armors approached him for the second time, he stepped on their shoulders again.
<br><br>
But as he did so, one of the armors suddenly turned its head and the mask on its head opened. It revealed an empty hollow with only two lines of serrated teeth like fangs.
<br><br>
Crack! The teeth almost clenched Zen's foot.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Zen was able to dodge them before they did.
<br><br>
"How dangerous!"
<br><br>
Zen's heart thumped.
<br><br>
He knew that he couldn't risk getting bitten. It would drastically make their escape difficult.
<br><br>
Zen perked up with more vigilance.
<br><br>
The armors still looked like they weren't thinking well, but they definitely improved their cognition.
<br><br>
At first, they thought jumping would be enough of an effort to reach Zen.
<br><br>
When they failed, they started to climb.
<br><br>
When Zen used them to thrust himself upwards, they had approached him differently the second time they caught up with Zen. If they reached Zen the third time, they would probably have a smarter and more dangerous solution.
<br><br>
Dorothy tightened her grip around Zen.
<br><br>
She clung onto him and felt safe. No matter how much danger they were in, she trusted Zen to find a way. She knew they were going to reach the top soon.
<br><br>
Zen pondered over the armors' actions. It seemed like they were merely learning from their mistakes, but they did not have the wisdom to foresee what would happen next.
<br><br>
Zen changed his course of action. Instead of stepping on their shoulders, he landed his feet directly on top of their heads.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The armors turned as if to reach for something on their shoulders. Zen chuckled at their utter mindlessness.
<br><br>
The fourth time they reached him, he stepped on their elbows.
<br><br>
He changed his approach again the fifth time.
<br><br>
And once more on the sixth time.
<br><br>
By the time they had caught up to him for the seventh time, Zen and Dorothy were already close to the exit.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He dragged Dorothy and finally rushed out of the square exit.
<br><br>
Nearby, the members of the Nine Li race waited.
<br><br>
From what they had gathered, everyone in the basement would soon be dead, including Zen.
<br><br>
Then, the two armors would leave the basement.
<br><br>
So when the armors did not leave after a long while of battling Zen, they started to wonder.
<br><br>
"I'll go check," the girl's brother said.
<br><br>
Just as he approached the square exit, he saw a figure rush up.
<br><br>
As reflex, he threw a punch at the figure.
<br><br>
"Fuck off!"
<br><br>
Zen didn't know who threw the punch, but he couldn't risk running into another obstacle when he had just come out.
<br><br>
The girl's brother started to feel a force stir around him. This force could have killed him.
<br><br>
The man was breathing heavily, his back lying flat against the ground.
<br><br>
He had avoided Zen's blow by a short distance, but the gust of wind knocked him over.
<br><br>
He got up and prepared to attack Zen once more. Just then, his sister's voice shouted, "Let my brother go! He didn't mean it!"
<br><br>
Her voice was crisp, innocent, and strangely familiar to Dorothy and Zen.
<br><br>
Zen recognized they were humans. He dragged Dorothy and made her stand firmly beside him.
<br><br>
Dorothy stared coldly at the girl. "I saved you in Stage Eleven when you were having troubles with the Separate Abyss race," she snarled. "And now you're planning to return the gesture with ingratitude?"
<br><br>
The girl was speechless. She wasn't able to see Dorothy's face, but she knew exactly what the voice was talking about. Dorothy was the one who had helped her pay two hundred thousand soul pills in Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
"Is it you? Were you the one who saved me?" the girl asked in a daze.
<br><br>
When she was still in Stage Twelve, the girl had looked for them. She wanted to give back the two hundred thousand soul pills, but Dorothy was nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
She asked around but the Other Shore was too vast. Finding another person without even knowing their name was a very difficult task.
<br><br>
Dorothy's sudden appearance was completely unexpected for her.
<br><br>
That incident was known to the girl's companions too. When the girl's brother realized what they were talking about, he cupped his hands. "Thank you so much for saving my sister," he said sincerely. "I was just trying to know the situation in the basement. I'm sorry for attacking you. Please forgive me!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3279 The Truth It looked like the man was telling the truth. He wasn't able to see who Zen was. Otherwise, he wouldn't have dared to attack Zen.
<br><br>
After all, no ordinary Souls of Light could cause Zen any real damage.
<br><br>
Attacking him was like courting death.
<br><br>
"It's okay," Zen said, finally relaxing.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! The two armors were nearly catching up. Any moment, they would be climbing out of the basement.
<br><br>
Zen wanted to run away right away. He was already exhausted from trying to lose them during the climb.
<br><br>
"These two armors are strong. We have to go," Zen announced as he dragged Dorothy's arm.
<br><br>
The members of the Nine Li race looked at each other and hesitated.
<br><br>
They knew that the two armors could not leave the basement.
<br><br>
The basement was, as a matter of fact, a trap. As soon as the thin wall was destroyed, the two armors would be activated, resulting in the collapse of the underground passage. All the Souls of Light inside would die.
<br><br>
The armors weren't supposed to be capable of climbing out of the basement.
<br><br>
The Nine Li people exchanged looks of hesitation.
<br><br>
The girl's brother reacted out of haste. "We have to get out of here right now! The armors are too powerful! Let's go! Hurry up!"
<br><br>
The others reacted the same way. They pretended to be scared.
<br><br>
As they were about to leave, Dorothy halted in her tracks. "Wait," she said, grabbing Zen's arm.
<br><br>
She felt that something was wrong.
<br><br>
She looked at the crowd. They were acting strangely.
<br><br>
After the door of the basement was opened by the Ear Mice, all the Souls of Light of the other races had entered, but they stayed outside.
<br><br>
There might be two reasons.
<br><br>
First, they only came after the armors entered the basement. Perhaps they didn't want to enter it when they saw how bad it was.
<br><br>
Second, they might have stayed outside because they knew that something bad was going to happen in the basement.
<br><br>
At first, Dorothy believed the first option. She thought the people were just passing by, clueless about the truth.
<br><br>
However, Dorothy found it odd that they did not even flinch at the sight of the armors. They even hesitated to leave upon Zen's command.
<br><br>
It was not until the girl's brother reminded them that they stirred into action.
<br><br>
Dorothy could tell that they were acting.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The members of the Nine Li race stopped in their tracks. They wondered what Dorothy was thinking of.
<br><br>
This only confirmed Dorothy's speculation. She snickered as she walked towards the hole.
<br><br>
"Be careful." Zen followed behind her. It was unlike her to act recklessly.
<br><br>
Zen was curious as to what Dorothy had in mind, so he did not stop her.
<br><br>
Dorothy stood by the hole and looked down. "Look," she said, nudging Zen to look below.
<br><br>
The two armors were hanging five feet away from the hole. To Zen's surprise, they were not moving at all.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The two armors raised their heads and their eyes flashed red. However, they did not move an inch.
<br><br>
Curious, Zen squatted at the square hole and stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
The armors were not willing to give up. One of them pulled out a rusty saber and brandished it into the air.
<br><br>
The saber was far away from Zen, so it couldn't hurt him.
<br><br>
"Be careful!" Dorothy warned.
<br><br>
She was afraid that Zen was being too risky.
<br><br>
The other armor pulled out two rusty sabers. This caused it to lose its grip and fall down.
<br><br>
It dropped more than a thousand feet and, soon, its body was heard clanking against the ground. Zen and Dorothy looked and saw that it created a big hole.
<br><br>
The other armor did the same thing. However, just as soon as they got rid of the armors, something happened.
<br><br>
Wisps of colorful fog gradually rose from the underground, completely blocking Zen's sight.
<br><br>
"Look! What's that?" Something small was floating along the fog, but Dorothy was having trouble seeing it clearly.
<br><br>
Zen stared at it closely. "It's an hourglass," he said, narrowing his eyes.
<br><br>
It floated amidst the thick fog—an hourglass the size of a fist.
<br><br>
The sand inside it was dripping quickly. Every time the top half emptied, it would automatically rotate and continue its flow again.
<br><br>
Each time the hourglass turned, everything in the underground room reversed back in time.
<br><br>
The two armors returned to the other side of the wall.
<br><br>
The chains that already broke became whole again.
<br><br>
Even the wall, which had already been partially broken by Zen, repaired itself.
<br><br>
The basement restored its original state. The collapsed passage floated and reconnected with the square entrance.
<br><br>
Nearly everything was restored. Only the dead Souls of Light remained in their dead state.
<br><br>
Zen took a moment to think about his next steps. Clearly, something was wrong. He turned his head to look at the people behind him. "You knew this would happen."
<br><br>
The members of the Nine Li race remained silent. It was difficult to explain, but they didn't want to admit it.
<br><br>
"If you don't want to talk to me peacefully, then maybe we should resort to tougher means. What do you think?" Zen's voice became as cold as ice.
<br><br>
He could kill anyone in sight easily in the Grand Sky Temple. There was no place for them to run to.
<br><br>
Perhaps the humans thought that Zen would spare them. They did not know that he wouldn't hesitate resorting to violence if necessary.
<br><br>
"We can't force the back door of the Grand Sky Temple open. If we do that, everyone will die," the girl's brother explained.
<br><br>
It was no use to continue tricking Zen. He had to tell the truth.
<br><br>
"Is there a way to open it?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
Everyone was silent again.
<br><br>
If they revealed the clue, they risked exposing their identities.
<br><br>
It would be as good as surrendering their lives to Zen.
<br><br>
"Say it," Zen ordered.
<br><br>
Dorothy tilted her head slightly.
<br><br>
"I heard you talk about the Nine Li race outside the temple," the girl chirped. "You don't intend to harm the Nine Li race, do you?"
<br><br>
"Sally!"
<br><br>
"What the hell are you talking about?"
<br><br>
She then kept silent, not wanting to disappoint her companions.
<br><br>
She knew she asked a foolish question.
<br><br>
It wasn't a good time to ask such things.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen had the upper hand. She was but a powerless being compared to him.
<br><br>
She nearly told Zen that they were from the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Everyone else stood tense and worried as Zen and Dorothy exchanged a meaningful look.
<br><br>
Chapter 3280 The Background Although Athemar knew part of Zen's background, he didn't disclose it to the people of the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
But Dorothy had already speculated that Zen was from the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
The issue of his identity was too sensitive. She figured that since he didn't mention the topic himself, she should avoid the topic entirely.
<br><br>
But she never would have guessed that the Nine Li race still had direct descendants.
<br><br>
"You're from the Nine Li race?" Zen asked, taking a step forward.
<br><br>
The other people of the Nine Li race grew anxious. "She's talking nonsense," Sally's brother said. "You don't have to take it so seriously. If you have nothing else to say, we must take our leave now!"
<br><br>
They could explore the Grand Sky Temple next time.
<br><br>
Though it was a pity to have to give up now, revealing their identity was the last thing they wanted to do.
<br><br>
If Zen somehow left something on their Souls of Light to track them down, he could end up killing all the remaining descendants.
<br><br>
To ensure everyone's safety, they opted to give up. Someone else would open up the Grand Sky Temple some other day.
<br><br>
"Wait," Zen called out and stepped forward, blocking the entrance.
<br><br>
The Nine Li people's faces suddenly sank.
<br><br>
If Zen truly wanted to keep them there, it would be all too easy for him.
<br><br>
"Sir, we have no enmity with you. You don't need to be too hard on us,"
<br><br>
Sally's brother pleaded with his hands clasped together.
<br><br>
But Zen merely ignored him and pointed to Sally. "You, come over here!"
<br><br>
Sally blinked.
<br><br>
In spite of her companions' anxiety about the situation, she felt oddly relaxed.
<br><br>
Somehow, she knew that the person before her posed absolutely no danger to them, but that was merely naivety in her companions' eyes.
<br><br>
"Sir, please leave my sister alone," Sally's brother said, now sounding bitter.
<br><br>
The others didn't like it either. She was young and inexperienced—they thought she'd end up revealing their true identity.
<br><br>
But Zen wasn't interested in these people at all. He went ahead and pulled Sally to the other side.
<br><br>
Seeing that Zen paid them no mind, Sally's brother called out through gritted teeth, "I tried to be civil, but you don't even have the decency to listen. We have no choice but to use force!"
<br><br>
Buzz! His soul and those of the other four began shining with purple light.
<br><br>
And then, their souls became whole.
<br><br>
A shadow with a form of three heads and six arms grew from the center of the light.
<br><br>
"They truly are from the Nine Li race…" Dorothy muttered to herself. Her eyes lit up at the sight before her.
<br><br>
The shadow was made from the Nine Li race's blood power. Its power was undoubtedly astonishing, but Dorothy wasn't worried at all. No matter how powerful it was, it was no match for Zen.
<br><br>
But the situation had pushed the Nine Li people on edge and they chose to attack.
<br><br>
"Brother!"
<br><br>
There was worry in Sally's voice as she called out to her brother who was ready to take action.
<br><br>
"Three heads and six arms?" Zen's mouth slightly curled up into a smile. "I can do just the same!"
<br><br>
Buzz! All of a sudden, the Wild God Power was activated, and the Nine Li race's blood surged within his body.
<br><br>
In a flash, Zen's figure grew tenfold. His giant body was about the same size as the shadow opposite him. In the next second, he threw six fists and hit the shadow hard.
<br><br>
This shadow was considered the Nine Li people's trump card. They never used it unless they faced death itself—using it immediately gave away their identity, after all.
<br><br>
But because of Zen, they felt they had no other choice but to use it against him.
<br><br>
Puff! While the shadow was powerful in killing the Souls of Light, it couldn't fight against Zen who came to the Other Shore with his physical body.
<br><br>
The moment Zen's fists made contact with the shadow, the Nine Li people felt dizziness overcome them. The shadow collapsed before they could even recover.
<br><br>
A tearing pain pierced all of their heads. The five were left bending over onto the ground, each with their hands on their head.
<br><br>
"Don't hurt them!" Sally called out anxiously.
<br><br>
Although Sally's brother was clearly in great pain, he was overcome with some kind of inexplicable emotion. Pushing the pain aside, he struggled to stand up and pointed at Zen in disbelief.
<br><br>
"You, you, you…" he muttered, still suffering from the blow he received, rendering him unable to even complete a sentence.
<br><br>
Zen quickly withdrew the Wild God Power, his body returning to normal.
<br><br>
With a smile, he asked, "You want to ask why I could form the same figure, don't you?"
<br><br>
"Aha..."
<br><br>
Sally's brother put his head in his hands, enduring the sharp pain piercing through him as he nodded. "Yes! This is the bloodline theurgy of the Nine Li race. How could you..."
<br><br>
"Brother, don't you see? He must be one of us!" Sally announced confidently.
<br><br>
To that, Zen smiled. He thought Sally was forthright and sincere.
<br><br>
But it wasn't her brother's fault that he was suspicious.
<br><br>
After the Nine Li race was exterminated, the remaining members had no choice but to be extremely careful.
<br><br>
All of them stared at Zen in utter disbelief—none of them was expecting to find another one of them, much less the man Sally was suspecting at the gate of the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
"Sir, which branch of the Nine Li race are you from?" Sally's brother asked, losing the harshness from his tone.
<br><br>
Zen then glanced at Dorothy, who merely shrugged—she decided to leave the sharing up to Zen.
<br><br>
It had been quite a while since Zen had joined the Oneness Sky Palace. If he was still on guard against Dorothy, she would undoubtedly be left disappointed.
<br><br>
"My mother is Lorena," Zen finally said.
<br><br>
His mother had later given herself the family name 'Li, ' but among the Nine Li people, she was known as Lorena.
<br><br>
The destruction of the Nine Li race had already passed when these people were born.
<br><br>
While they didn't live in that time, they had grown up hearing many of the legends—they were well aware of who Lorena was.
<br><br>
"You..."
<br><br>
"You are from the royal family!"
<br><br>
"How do I know I can even believe you?"
<br><br>
Everyone, even Sally, was wide-eyed and stunned, looking at Zen in confusion.
<br><br>
Sally's brother shuddered and took a step forward, ready to kneel down before Zen.
<br><br>
The latter gently helped him up and shook his head with a smile. "There's no need to be so courteous. I might be lying to you,"
<br><br>
Zen joked kindly.
<br><br>
However, materializing three heads and six arms required a great amount of power and his blood of the Nine Li race was nothing to take lightly.
<br><br>
Amidst the confusion, Dorothy looked just as conflicted.
<br><br>
Although she had already guessed that Zen had come from the Nine Li race, she certainly didn't expect him to be a member of the royal family.
<br><br>
If the Nine Li race was flourishing, that meant his status would be as high as Elvinia's.
<br><br>
In truth, his status could even be much higher than hers.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace was the union of the seven mountains, each of which had a respective emperor.
<br><br>
The Nine Li race had nine tribes, but Chiyou was the supreme ruler. The royal members held a greater status than the direct descendants of the palace.
<br><br>
Chapter 3281 Uninvited Followers The Nine Li members chose to believe Zen, irrespective of whether Zen was joking or not.
<br><br>
Zen had proved himself to be a member of the Nine Li race. They couldn't test his blood lineage on the Other Shore, let alone test his blood purity. But the best proof lay in the fact that he had three heads and six arms.
<br><br>
"Thad, you belong to the royal family. How did you become a member of the Oneness Sky Palace?" Sally's brother asked again.
<br><br>
Their curiosity about Zen had surpassed that about the Dark Region.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had addressed Zen 'Thad' at the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple. Thus, those Nine Li members thought that that was his real name.
<br><br>
"It's a long story," Zen said cautiously. "I hope you will ask the elders of Nine Li race to come to the Oneness Sky Palace someday. I want to meet them if possible."
<br><br>
Both sides had tried to trust each other but were still far from reaching a place where they could share everything.
<br><br>
Sally's brother would not disclose the location of the remaining members of the Nine Li race, nor would Zen tell them where the divine land was.
<br><br>
"I will report this to the elders of our race," Sally's brother said.
<br><br>
If Zen was really Lorena's son and possessed such amazing abilities, the remaining members of the Nine Li race would fall over themselves to meet him in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The Nine Li race and the Oneness Sky Palace had never been enemies. The beliefs that they had chosen to follow were the same, which meant that the Oneness Sky Palace could still ensure their safety and peace.
<br><br>
These people then introduced themselves to Zen.
<br><br>
"My name is Hutton," Sally's brother said.
<br><br>
"My name is Sally. It's so nice to meet you, Thad," the girl said with a smile.
<br><br>
Once all the members had introduced themselves to Zen, Hutton said to him, "Thad, you can't break the wall with just brute force. Forcing it open will only lead you into fatal trouble."
<br><br>
Both Zen and Dorothy had been through what Hutton was describing.
<br><br>
Even Zen's corporeal body was unable to resist the two armors. A Soul of Light would definitely suffer grave consequences if fighting against the armors.
<br><br>
"Do you know how to get inside?" Zen asked Hutton.
<br><br>
"Yes," Hutton replied.
<br><br>
He was beginning to trust Zen.
<br><br>
Although they didn't completely trust each other, it wouldn't be so bad to explore the Dark Region together. After all, even Hutton wasn't confident about exploring the Dark Region. All he got were the clues that the Nine Li race had left behind.
<br><br>
Zen gestured wordlessly towards the square entrance of the basement.
<br><br>
Hutton nodded before walking to the entrance with Sally and the other members of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
"Oh, here you are!"
<br><br>
A cold voice rang out from the entrance of the tower.
<br><br>
The group became nervous at the voice. Dorothy frowned.
<br><br>
It was Elvinia, leading the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
When they were about to enter the temple, Chaim and Elvinia wanted to follow Zen. But Zen refused them. He had agreed to cooperate with the Ear Mice and brought only Dorothy to enter it.
<br><br>
Elvinia, Chaim, and many other disciples walked through another passageway.
<br><br>
They explored the yard for a while before choosing a tower to enter.
<br><br>
Some of the Souls of Light, who had entered the Grand Sky Temple, had died in the passageways. Half of the others had died in the basement, and the other half had gone into the towers like Elvinia's group did.
<br><br>
Elviniai and Chaim were unlucky. Their exploration had dug up nothing, thanks to the many traps in the tower. Elvinia had finally suggested that they move to another tower.
<br><br>
As soon as she arrived here, she saw Zen and Dorothy.
<br><br>
"There is nothing here. Chaim, please take her away," Dorothy said coldly.
<br><br>
Her face turned gloomy the moment she saw Elvinia.
<br><br>
Before Chaim could say anything, Elvinia burst out at Dorothy. "What do you think of yourself? You think this is your Origin Mountain? Is it Princess Dorothy who has the final say?"
<br><br>
"You are right. It is me!" Dorothy stared at her fiercely.
<br><br>
The fight between the two women confused the people around them.
<br><br>
Hutton looked at Zen, a little worried. Only Zen could make the final decision here.
<br><br>
"Dorothy, now that we have entered the Grand Sky Temple, don't we have the right to choose where we continue our exploration? We are all from the Oneness Sky Palace and are on the same side. If anything should happen, we can take care of each other. Thad, what do you think? Am I right?"
<br><br>
Chaim tried to broker the peace between Dorothy and Elvinia, with a hard but polite smile on his face.
<br><br>
He had seen the square entrance the moment he entered the tower.
<br><br>
Though he didn't know what had happened here, he guessed it was probably related to the way leading to the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Chaim didn't want to miss such an amazing opportunity.
<br><br>
Dorothy pursed her lips, not knowing how to respond.
<br><br>
It would have been fine if Elvinia hadn't been with the group. Dorothy wouldn't have minded Chaim and the other disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace going with them.
<br><br>
"Yes, we are on the same side. We can take care of each other as we explore this place together," Zen said, nodding.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light of the Ear Mice were all dead by now. Zen could trust both the group from the Oneness Sky Palace and the Nine Li members. If Dorothy were to disagree even now, there would eventually be a collision between the Origin Mountain and the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
Dorothy knew she shouldn't cross the line. Now that Zen had made his decision, all she could do was reluctantly agree with him.
<br><br>
Hutton and his group were also reluctant, but they were more careful about expressing their thoughts.
<br><br>
"Come with us then," Zen said.
<br><br>
Hutton, Sally, and the other members of the Nine Li race went in first. Zen and Dorothy followed them, while Chaim, Elvinia, and the disciples came last.
<br><br>
As they walked through the passageway, Chaim questioned Zen about the whereabouts of the Ear Mice. Zen sighed and said, "They're all dead."
<br><br>
"The Ear Mice... All dead?" Chaim froze.
<br><br>
He couldn't believe what he was hearing. All the Ear Mice were cunning.
<br><br>
Many of them had entered the Grand Sky Temple, but now they were all dead. How was that possible? "Not only them. More than a thousand non-human Souls of Light also died in this basement," Zen said, and then proceeded to tell them what had happened in the basement.
<br><br>
Elvinia, Chaim, and the disciples stopped short, shocked at Zen's revelations.
<br><br>
If this basement was that dangerous, did it mean that anyone who entered it would be courting death? "You don't have to follow us if you are afraid," Dorothy said as she turned to look at Elvinia. Her voice had a provoking bite to it.
<br><br>
Elvinia couldn't stand ridicule. She merely snorted and continued on her way.
<br><br>
Zen laughed. "Don't be nervous, Chaim. We are safe in the basement, because they've a solution," he said.
<br><br>
"The solution..." Chaim looked doubtfully at Hutton's group and asked, "Which force of the human race do these people belong to?"
<br><br>
Both the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had been expelled. All the other human forces were small ones. If these people really knew the way to the Dark Region, it was impossible that they were from those small forces.
<br><br>
Zen said with an easy smile, "Don't ask improper questions if you want to follow us to explore the Dark Region."
<br><br>
Chapter 3282 Moving The Wall Chaim laughed lightheartedly as he realized their delicate identities. Then he said, "They are all human beings. It really doesn't matter where they come from."
<br><br>
The Nine Li people, including Hutton, who stopped in their tracks, felt thoroughly relieved.
<br><br>
The entire basement had now been fully restored. There wasn't even a single indication of the previous mess. It seemed like nothing happened.
<br><br>
"Squeak... Squeak! Squeak..."
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak..."
<br><br>
They heard squeaking noises from the corner of the wall while they walked along the passageway.
<br><br>
"What do you think that was?"
<br><br>
"They're mouse-shaped souls?"
<br><br>
"Indeed. They do appear like the souls of the Ear Mice! They look so weak and fragile!"
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace looked at the souls. A curious look registered upon their faces.
<br><br>
Those who entered Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore were probably either Indigo Souls or Souls of Light that were about to become Indigo Souls.
<br><br>
However, the souls at the corner were almost invisible. They seemed like candles in the wind that would go out at any time! The souls were back in their fundamental form. It was probably difficult for them to leave their bodies, let alone cross the Sea of Truth to reach the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"I think they really are... the souls of the Ear Mice," Zen murmured while staring at the faint souls.
<br><br>
Hutton nodded in agreement. He said, "They have been reverted to their initial form because of the hourglass."
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had found the basement behind the Grand Sky Temple even without any clue. It was highly likely that they had big plans for the Dark Region.
<br><br>
And for this mission, they had been prepared and had carefully worked out a plan.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, they did an excellent job. They invited Zen to come with them and he had successfully broken the wall down by force.
<br><br>
However, they were not fully aware that breaking the wall would come at a great price.
<br><br>
When the two armors appeared, even Zen wasn't able to stop them. But then, the Ear Mice made a seemingly smart decision. They hid in a corner of the wall using a soul weapon.
<br><br>
The way in which they hid was extremely brilliant. The two armors, the Souls of Light of alien races, and even Zen did not notice them in the chaos that ensued.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Ear Mice didn't expect that everything would be restored in the basement after the armors left! As the fog rose slowly, the Ear Mice immediately noticed that something was terribly wrong. However, it was now impossible for them to escape.
<br><br>
The passageway leading to the entrance was gradually restored. The Ear Mice were restored by the fog as well. Eventually, they became what they were now.
<br><br>
These Ear Mice's Souls of Light only had their most rudimentary consciousness now. When they saw Chaim coming over, they squeaked and crowded round him. Even in the basement, they could not withstand the aura of the Other Shore and trembled in fear.
<br><br>
Sally blinked, took out a soul pill, and gently crushed it. The powder of the soul pill released a trace of brown soul force.
<br><br>
The little Ear Mice had instinctively believed that the soul force was their food. But as soon as they came forward to get it, Hutton rushed over and dispersed the soul force.
<br><br>
"Brother, what are you..." Sally was taken aback. She didn't understand what Hutton was trying to do.
<br><br>
"The force of soul pill can make them feel better," Dorothy muttered in agreement with Sally.
<br><br>
Nearby, Elvinia smiled coldly and said, "The Souls of Light of the Ear Mice are almost like newborn babies. You can try feeding soul pills to a baby and see if it can take it."
<br><br>
Chaim bowed his head in agreement, "Princess Elvinia is right. Soul pills will only accelerate their death."
<br><br>
"But look at them, they seem so pathetic!" Sally commented while she shook her head.
<br><br>
Although the Ear Mice looked ugly and disgusting in their adult forms, these small Ear Mice's souls were fairly cute. They even rubbed themselves against their feet.
<br><br>
"Dorothy, kindly put them into the Sumeru Space," Zen finally said.
<br><br>
He believed that these souls could cultivate again. Given enough time, these Ear Mice might still be able to recover as long as their race had kept their Memory Flames.
<br><br>
In any case, Zen was brought here by the Ear Mice. If he had even the slightest chance of saving them, he definitely wouldn't just abandon them.
<br><br>
"Understood." Dorothy bowed her head in reply. Almost instantly, a blue square appeared on the tip of her finger. She pointed towards the direction of the Ear Mice's souls. "Squeak! Squeak..."
<br><br>
The Ear Mice had no idea what was going on. But all of a sudden, they were drawn into the space ring.
<br><br>
The space ring on the Other Shore was also regarded as a space in which severe auras could be avoided. As for how they would move these weak souls out of the Other Shore, it now depended upon the Ear Mouse race.
<br><br>
After the Ear Mice settled down in the space ring, Hutton walked towards the huge and strangely shaped stones on the side of the basement.
<br><br>
The row of stones were almost entirely smooth except for a few defective round holes on their surface.
<br><br>
Zen examined the stones closely. However, he was quite puzzled. He had no idea what purpose they served.
<br><br>
Hutton walked slowly along the stones from left to right. Then, he stopped in front of the seventh one. He took out three pieces of jade of different colors from his pocket.
<br><br>
At the sight of the three pieces of jade, Zen's eyes shone with sudden comprehension.
<br><br>
These pieces of jade fit perfectly into the round holes of the stone! After observing for a while, Hutton put the cyan jade into the round hole on the top.
<br><br>
He gently pushed the jade into the hole and a crisp sound rang. There seemed to be a mechanical device in the basement causing a vibration.
<br><br>
Everyone raised their heads and looked around. However, they didn't notice any changes.
<br><br>
Without pausing, Hutton then put the red and purple jades into the two round holes on the bottom.
<br><br>
"Click!"
<br><br>
"Click!"
<br><br>
After they heard two crisp sounds again, the entire basement trembled with a thundering sound.
<br><br>
The patterns on the other side of the wall began to change. The connected patterns started to move to two sides and then separately connected with the two armors. They formed two distinct circles.
<br><br>
Afterwards, the wall slowly began to move. Meanwhile, the passageway that led towards the outside also opened.
<br><br>
The movement of the wall didn't break the integrity of those patterns. The chains wrapping the two armors didn't break either. They were still standing motionlessly on the platforms.
<br><br>
"Unbelievable! It worked!"
<br><br>
"Finally, we can get out of here!"
<br><br>
"The clues are completely right!"
<br><br>
A smile crept across the Nine Li people's faces.
<br><br>
Before they entered the Grand Sky Temple, they were very nervous. But now that they had moved the wall, they became quite excited.
<br><br>
Zen went out and walked around. His eyes fell upon the two armors. After he got another look at the patterns on the wall, he suddenly became enlightened. The mechanical device was designed to prevent someone from forcefully smashing down the wall! "Are these armors really that powerful?" the disciples asked a bit skeptically.
<br><br>
"About a thousand Souls of Light of alien races were slaughtered. Tsk, tsk..."
<br><br>
"If only I could take the armor as my Other Shore Token," someone remarked regrettably.
<br><br>
A few disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace reached out their hands and tried to touch the armors. Chaim hurriedly warned them, "Don't just touch them randomly. If they come to life again, I doubt that any of you will survive!"
<br><br>
Those disciples quickly withdrew their hands as if they had been burned.
<br><br>
After these warriors passed by the two armors, they saw a wooden bridge ahead. The bridge was long and narrow. It seemed like it would only fit two people. It also extended all the way forward into the vast distance. They could vaguely see the three wooden huts in the darkness.
<br><br>
It was a little strange that there was no change in the wooden huts they saw in front of the temple and at the back of it. They should have been near the huts now, yet the huts still hung gloomily in the distant Dark Region.
<br><br>
Chapter 3283 The Wooden Bridge As far as most creatures knew, no one was allowed to enter the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Anyone who entered would be swallowed up by endless darkness.
<br><br>
What happened in there was shrouded in mystery. No one knew how and why the Souls of Light disappeared in the depths of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
People who entered died suddenly and silently. Their Souls of Light were lost and their bodies were left empty, like ships without a rudder.
<br><br>
Everyone carried a deep and abiding fear of the Dark Region. It was terrible to lose your own soul. And so the Souls of Light wandering Stage Thirteen would be careful to stay far away from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Chaim paused, analyzing the situation. "The bridge should be within the Dark Region," he said.
<br><br>
The two Dark Regions in Stage Thirteen formed two semicircles, the ends of two arcs connected behind the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
At Chaim's words, those from the Oneness Sky Palace stopped in their tracks. They even took several steps back, as though retreating from some horrible monster awaiting them on the bridge.
<br><br>
However, the Nine Li people stepped confidently onto the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
Hutton said, "It's true that the bridge is located within the Dark Region, but we're safe in the place with light."
<br><br>
Zen followed Hutton forward onto the bridge. He looked around, his curiosity increasing at the sight of the mysterious light. "Where does the light come from? It's so strange."
<br><br>
According to No. 9527, only those candles could light up the Dark Region.
<br><br>
When Zen had first reached the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple, he'd been able to see the wooden bridge from a distance. He had wondered to himself if there were candles on the bridge. He couldn't see any candles now, which made him feel uneasy.
<br><br>
Where was the light coming from? "The light comes from something we can't see," Hutton replied calmly.
<br><br>
They knew little about the Dark Region, and they had accepted that they would never unravel most of its secrets.
<br><br>
Zen nodded, still observing the light. He knew that the candles could light up the Dark Region. But What were they made of? What else was in here? Dorothy followed behind Zen, and in turn she was followed by Chaim, Elvinia and the other disciples.
<br><br>
The disciples were very scared, but they had finally come to the Dark Region which had never been explored before. If they could find a unique Other Shore Token, their status would be greatly improved in the Oneness Sky Palace in the future.
<br><br>
And so, dreaming of the possibilities, they cautiously stepped onto the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
There was a creaking sound, followed by another, then another, as the Souls of Light walked on the bridge.
<br><br>
No one knew for sure how long the bridge had been standing there, but it was clearly old, and over the years the wood had become slightly rotten.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light were not heavy, and they moved very carefully to avoid straining the bridge. However, the wood creaked and strained with each step Zen took. Zen had a corporeal body and was thus the heaviest person on the bridge, so he held his breath as he stepped forward, thinking that the bridge could collapse at any time.
<br><br>
"Thad, tread softly. If this bridge collapses, it will certainly make things more difficult for us," said Chaim with a wry smile.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and moved slowly, treading as gently as possible.
<br><br>
In this manner, the group moved slowly forward. They made their gradual way deeper and deeper into the darkness.
<br><br>
A deathly silence surrounded them. The darkness pressed in on all sides, and although they kept moving forward, they still couldn't see the end of the wooden bridge ahead. The cold, eerie atmosphere strained the nerves of the disciples on the bridge.
<br><br>
Suddenly, one of the disciples cried out, "What happened? The temple is gone!"
<br><br>
The disciple hadn't been able to resist looking backwards, and what he saw stunned him.
<br><br>
Zen, Dorothy, and the others quickly turned around. To their surprise, the high towers of the Grand Sky Temple and the vista of the Other Shore beyond it had vanished completely. There was only the wooden bridge, stretching out into the black gloom. Absolute darkness lay ahead of them and behind them.
<br><br>
"I—I want to go back," said a disciple, unable to conceal his fear.
<br><br>
He was a follower of Elvinia from the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
He had been reluctant to explore the Grand Sky Temple, but he came because his duty was to protect Elvinia. He had been even more hesitant about following her here into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
He had encountered many hardships so far, but with the help of other disciples, including those from other races, he was still alive. He had hoped that he would be able to leave safely after exploring the Grand Sky Temple, but this quiet, dark bridge somehow seemed more dangerous than anything they had previously encountered.
<br><br>
Elvinia glanced indifferently at him. "All right, you can turn back on your own," she said coolly. She always looked down on cowards.
<br><br>
The disciple said nothing, but he didn't move. Going back alone seemed like a risky option. Who knew what he would encounter by himself? Zen intervened, speaking in a composed voice intended to calm the others, "The Grand Sky Temple can't have disappeared. Perhaps our eyes are just deceiving us. Let's keep pressing forward and see what happens."
<br><br>
Although it was Hutton and the other Nine Li people who led the way, Zen was the unspoken leader of the group.
<br><br>
He was the only corporeal body on the Other Shore. If something bad happened, everyone knew that they must turn to Zen for protection.
<br><br>
Chaim and Dorothy also spoke soothingly to the others, building their courage. Then everyone continued on their journey.
<br><br>
The light on the bridge was unevenly distributed. At some points the light seemed bright, but after a few steps, the light dimmed and flickered. This supported what Hutton told them. The light must come from candles, but they couldn't see them from where they stood.
<br><br>
The bridge still creaked loudly with every step Zen took.
<br><br>
Zen walked as slowly as he could, testing every plank before he placed his foot down, but no matter where he stepped, the bridge still creaked.
<br><br>
It made him tense, but he was determined to continue forward. The group moved without talking, and the only sound in the infinite darkness surrounding them was the creaking of the bridge. However, after a few minutes, those closest to Zen heard a new sound.
<br><br>
They tilted their heads, trying to identify the strange sound.
<br><br>
It was distinct from the creaks, but it seemed to come only when Zen was moving.
<br><br>
It was as if bugs were eating the wooden boards of the bridge.
<br><br>
Zen, Hutton and Chaim were the ones who had noticed the new sound first.
<br><br>
"Stop," Hutton said sharply.
<br><br>
"Listen, do you also hear that sound? Can you tell what it is?" Chaim asked.
<br><br>
Zen stopped moving, and the sound disappeared.
<br><br>
"What sound are you talking about? Brother, don't scare me!" Sally said, her voice trembling.
<br><br>
The environment of the Nine Li race had made its people strong, but after all Sally was still quite young.
<br><br>
"The noise only comes when I move," Zen said softly.
<br><br>
He took a step forward.
<br><br>
The bridge creaked, and beneath that creak was the distinct sound of something unfamiliar.
<br><br>
This time, everyone on the bridge heard it clearly.
<br><br>
"It seems that there is something under the wooden bridge!"
<br><br>
"What the hell is that? Is something following us?"
<br><br>
"Oh my God! It must be a monster of the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
The disciples spoke in hushed, panicked voices, looking around them fearfully at the darkness.
<br><br>
Dorothy couldn't help but lean towards Zen. Although Elvinia was scared, she still looked around the wooden bridge, squinting her eyes.
<br><br>
"It's down there," said Zen. "Something is following us."
<br><br>
He held on to the railing of the wooden bridge and looked down over the side, into the black chasm below.
<br><br>
The planks of the wooden bridge were wider than the railings on each side.
<br><br>
This made it impossible to probe what was under the bridge simply by leaning over the edge. The underside of the bridge was shrouded entirely in impenetrable darkness. Nobody could explore it just by using their spiritual sense.
<br><br>
Everyone was anxious and afraid. All of a sudden, Hutton, who was in the lead, spoke in a low and urgent voice, "Thad, look behind us."
<br><br>
Zen, Dorothy, Sally, and Elvinia turned their heads. To their horror, a black tail was visible on one side of the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
The tail was as slender as a rope, and tapered to a sharp hook at the tip.
<br><br>
Without making any sound, the tail flicked and moved towards a disciple who stood in the rear of the group.
<br><br>
Chapter 3284 Human-Monkey Monsters Evidently, the one who stood on the far end of the line had no idea about what was going on.
<br><br>
Naturally, when everyone turned to look at him, he became cautious.
<br><br>
Suddenly baffled by the unwanted attention, he began to eye himself up. As he glanced sideways, his gaze fell on the black tail, which caused him to stiffen up.
<br><br>
Although he had no clue what it was, there was a high probability it came from under the wooden bridge. If so, then it must have been a creature from the Dark Region! Even though he tried his best to remain calm, the situation at hand required a lot of wits to do so. His Soul of Light couldn't help but have a strong fluctuation out of fear.
<br><br>
"Help! Someone, please help me!"
<br><br>
he shouted but in a low voice for a few people near him to hear.
<br><br>
When the other disciples close to him noticed the tail, they were too scared to approach him and help.
<br><br>
Now that they didn't want to alarm the creature, they had to walk on the wooden bridge with careful steps.
<br><br>
When he realized his calls were all for naught and no one would come to his aid, the disciple paced anxiously to get as further away from the tail as possible.
<br><br>
But just as he moved, the tail with a hook shot up in the sky. It began to spiral in the air before it aimed itself towards the disciple.
<br><br>
"All of you get down now!"
<br><br>
Zen shouted on top of his lungs. Then, he dashed towards the tail while jumping over the heads of the disciples.
<br><br>
These Souls of Light were powerful. However, they were not strong enough to fight against the monsters that resided on the Other Shore. What was more frightening was the fact that this creature was from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
No one but Zen could handle a situation such as this.
<br><br>
When Zen's words rang in the ears of the disciple, he instinctively ducked in time for the tail to miss its target.
<br><br>
But now, Zen had only managed to pass over Elvinia's head. He was still far away from the reach of that disciple. The tail, on the other hand, was much more flexible in its movements than anyone could have imagined.
<br><br>
Although it missed, the tail did not seem to retreat. Instead, it went around the bridge. The disciple who had been lying on the bridge had no space left to go. He was surrounded. The teammates of the disciple watched in horror as the creature from the Dark Region pierced his Soul of Light and moved out of the bridge.
<br><br>
In an attempt to rescue him, Zen jumped up in the air and reached his hand out to grab ahold of the disciple.
<br><br>
But the tail seemed to have eyes of its own and had seen Zen approach it swiftly. Suddenly, it swept right to lead Zen in the wrong direction and bypassed him. With quick movements, the creature shrank into the darkness under the bridge with the disciple still in its grasp.
<br><br>
Desperate shouts of help were heard from the disciple when his Soul of Light was first pierced. His voice was loud in this quiet space and could be heard far and wide. But the moment he disappeared into the darkness, it was as if it had swallowed him as his cries for help left with him. Only the trembling sound of the wooden bridge could be heard as everyone fell into a deep silence. Zen had almost broken the rotten wooden bridge from his jump.
<br><br>
"It must be a monster of the Other Shore..."
<br><br>
"Jabir has been dragged down. I think it killed him!"
<br><br>
"What the hell is that thing?"
<br><br>
The disciples snapped out of their confusion and began to panic all at once.
<br><br>
"The problem is that monster is right below us," Chaim said with a frown while pointing his finger downwards.
<br><br>
The light on the bridge was unable to light up the underneath. Moreover, they knew nothing about the Dark Region, which was why they had no idea how to deal with the monster.
<br><br>
"Hutton, do you know what it is?" Zen asked, looking rather serious.
<br><br>
After all, among them, the Nine Li members were the only ones who knew this place.
<br><br>
Hutton shook his head and replied, "Sorry, I don't know much about the Dark Region. I only have some clues about going through the Grand Sky Temple."
<br><br>
The members of the Nine Li race had never expected to encounter such a crisis.
<br><br>
"There is a possibility that the monster won't come for us, right? Maybe it feels full after devouring one Soul of Light," Sally said, suddenly sounding anxious as she ran her gaze in all directions.
<br><br>
"Sally!" Hutton's face visibly darkened as he yelled at her, "This is not the time to utter such nonsense."
<br><br>
However, Zen walked up to Hutton and calmed him down by placing his hand over his shoulder. He spoke in a solemn voice, "There is no need to get all worked up. What Sally said might be true. I know we are not able to figure out the monster's purpose as yet. But, it is possible that its target is to eat up your Souls of Light."
<br><br>
Zen didn't include himself in the possibility now that he was a physical body. But he did not know the limits of power this creature contained, so he was unsure whether this monster was able to swallow his physical body or not.
<br><br>
"It would be in our favor if it was full after snacking on one Soul of Light.
<br><br>
However, I have a strong hunch it won't leave us alone just yet..." Chaim said with low spirits as he hung his head.
<br><br>
Hearing his painfully honest words, everyone felt a cold chill run down their spines. Out of fear, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace prepared for the reappearance of the tail. They all began to release their spiritual sense.
<br><br>
Having no other choice, they began to advance forward. With fearful steps, they set out for their destination once more.
<br><br>
However, this time, their formation differed from that of before. Chaim and the members of the Nine Li race led the group forward while Zen remained in the middle of the troops. With this strategy, Zen could be able to guard them against all attacks, whether from ahead or behind.
<br><br>
As they walked along the wooden bridge, they had covered a long distance without encountering the monster. Their hearts heaved a sigh of relief as they felt like they were out of danger. Maybe, Sally was right. The monster might be full after swallowing one Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Just as everyone relaxed their tensed bodies, they heard many noises from behind! "Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
The noises sounded as if there were hundreds of monsters running under the wooden bridge! Elvinia, Hutton, and the others froze in place. Their faces turned white as a sheet out of fear, and their Souls of Light trembled unsteadily.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
After every passing second, the noises drew closer and closer. It would only be a matter of seconds before the monsters reached their feet. The constant running of the creatures caused the wooden bridge to shake continuously.
<br><br>
It was hard enough for them to fight against a single monster from the Dark Region, let alone dozens or hundreds of them. The group had already lost all their morale and let down their guards in defeat. However, Zen remained calm. He clenched his fists and began to concoct a countermeasure in his mind.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
The voice under the bridge was only a few inches away from the group. The monsters were running with frantic movements at a notably fast pace. But they crossed them at the same speed they approached them with.
<br><br>
As he sensed their footsteps fade away in the distance, traces of fear disappeared from Chaim's face as he said, "It seems we are not their target..."
<br><br>
"Exactly. It isn't us, but I think they are running from something far more dangerous. We should get a move on, and we must be fast," Zen said as he pointed towards the behind.
<br><br>
Not too far behind them, a thick red python was covering most of the wooden bridge. It twisted and turned its body to move forward. Sometimes, it would move towards the darkness to camouflage itself, and occasionally it would show up on the bridge. In front of the python were a few monsters.
<br><br>
From their appearance, they seemed to be half-human and half-monkey. As the python slithered its way towards them, they galloped wildly to get away from it.
<br><br>
Their tails were exactly the same as the one that pulled the disciple into the darkness. It was apparent that they were the monsters that hid under the bridge.
<br><br>
Splash! Of course, these human-monkey monsters' movements were remarkably agile, but it was still hard for them to escape the clutches of the python.
<br><br>
Every time the red python looked up and clenched its teeth towards them, a human-monkey monster would be swallowed whole into its stomach.
<br><br>
After gobbling up several human-monkey monsters, the red python raised its head to scout its next prey. Its huge tongue slithered out of its mouth when it discovered Zen and the others. "Hiss..."
<br><br>
Without wasting a moment, the red python went around the wooden bridge and crawled forward at an incredibly fast speed.
<br><br>
"Hurry, let's go now!"
<br><br>
At this point, they could all agree on one thing: to run and escape as further away as possible from this creature.
<br><br>
However, the power of the Souls of Light had their limitations. In terms of speed, they couldn't compare with a physical body.
<br><br>
Zen felt anxiety build up in his body as he noticed the Souls of Light would struggle to keep up with him. At this rate, the red python would catch up to them in seconds and devour them one by one.
<br><br>
Under such circumstances, he suddenly thought of a plan and shouted towards them, "Quick! All of you grab onto each other! I will drag all of you with me as I run!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3285 To Cross The Bridge Zen knew that the Souls of Light weighed almost nothing.
<br><br>
As the width of the bridge could only allow two people walk on it side by side, the people of the Nine Li race and the Oneness Sky Palace had been marching in two rows, moving forward along the bridge.
<br><br>
Now they each grabbed onto whoever was in front of them, so that the whole group was connected.
<br><br>
Zen moved to the front of the line and grabbed the hands of Hutton and Sally.
<br><br>
There was a whooshing sound.
<br><br>
Everyone felt like a vise had gripped them by the arms and pulled them up forcefully. The Souls of Light were lifted into the air.
<br><br>
"Hang on!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
As they held on tightly to him and to each other, Zen stomped on the ground and increased the power beneath his feet.
<br><br>
Earlier, he had been controlling his steps, trying to tread as lightly as possible, because he feared the bridge would not bear his power. However, as the red python glided by, he realized the bridge was not as fragile as it seemed.
<br><br>
As he stomped down, the wooden planks under Zen started to sink. But the bridge did not break.
<br><br>
Instead, the bridge bent down, then snapped back into place.
<br><br>
Like a tight bowstring, the bridge bounced Zen away. The Souls of Light flew into the air but kept a tight grip on each other, forming a glowing line in the darkness. From a distance, it looked like Zen was flying a kite.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light were disoriented at being tossed into the air. Some of them called out to each other, trying to fight their dizziness. "We're moving so fast!"
<br><br>
"Where are we now?"
<br><br>
"Careful, we might fall into the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
They could feel cool, dry winds sweeping through their souls in the air.
<br><br>
The bridge creaked and groaned as Zen landed on it.
<br><br>
As soon as he found his footing on the bridge, Zen rushed forward again.
<br><br>
The red python seemed to have been caught by surprise at how fast these people were moving. It hissed loudly. The scales on its head crested, like a threatening cockscomb.
<br><br>
The python slithered forward on the cramped bridge, increasing its own speed and gaining on Zen and the others.
<br><br>
In the air, the disciples could see the snake catching up. They felt chills of fear at the terrible sounds made by the red python behind them.
<br><br>
The speed of Zen's movement left the disciples behind him floating in a line that trailed upwards. The disciples at the furthest end of the line were at least fifty feet in the air.
<br><br>
The disciples had fought to keep their grip on each other despite Zen's jarring quickness. Some of them were screaming. Most of them found it difficult to stay calm especially as the red python seemed to be moving even faster than Zen.
<br><br>
"Thad, hurry!" "It's coming closer!"
<br><br>
"It's only a hundred feet away!"
<br><br>
"We're going to get eaten!"
<br><br>
Those words were from the disciples at the end of the line, who realized that they would be the first to get eaten if the red python decided to raise its head and snap its jaws at the line of flying Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Zen didn't bother looking back. He could feel the rhythm of the red python's movement on the bridge and knew that it was about to catch up to him.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Zen couldn't fly on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
He didn't waste energy on speaking. He just focused all his energy on moving forward. He was now running at his maximum possible speed.
<br><br>
However, it wasn't fast enough. He still couldn't shake off the red python.
<br><br>
Each time it raised its head, half of its body rose into the air. Its huge mouth opened to reveal sharp fangs and a forked tongue. The disciples closest to it were terrified.
<br><br>
"Hold on!" Zen shouted.
<br><br>
The disciples gripped each other tightly as Zen swung his arms and flicked the line of souls forward.
<br><br>
The red python had just reared its head. Its open jaws closed on nothing as the Souls of Light were sent flying forward. Zen had flicked the line of souls like a whip.
<br><br>
The python let out a sound that was a mixture of roar and hiss.
<br><br>
It had fully expected to bite down on the souls at the end of the line, and it slithered forward so quickly it looked like a long red blur on the bridge.
<br><br>
"The python is much faster than I am! I can't outrun it much longer,"
<br><br>
Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
The red python lifted its head and snapped its jaw forward.
<br><br>
It approached Zen and the others like a streak of red lightning.
<br><br>
This time, Zen had no time to save the souls at the end of the line. He tried to flick them forward again, but the python was too fast. In an instant, its jaws had closed around four screaming disciples.
<br><br>
In a panic, most of the remaining disciples lost their grip and fell to the bridge. Chaim shouted as he fell off the edge of the bridge. Fortunately, he managed to grab the railing of the bridge with one hand. Trembling, he pulled himself up.
<br><br>
Everyone stopped and turned to face the red python. Now they had to fight.
<br><br>
There was no chance to escape.
<br><br>
The majority of the disciples were so terrified that they stood frozen in place, just gawking at the intimidating red python. Elvinia, Dorothy, and the members of the Nine Li race retreated cautiously, keeping a nervous, watchful eye on the python.
<br><br>
They were frantically considering what they could do to fight against the python. But Souls of Light were no match for the creatures who lived on the Other Shore. Moreover, the python was a creature of the Dark Region. It was too strong for them.
<br><br>
The python roared and opened its jaws to reveal long white fangs.
<br><br>
It began to slither towards them, ready to devour more souls.
<br><br>
The disciples kept backing up instinctively. But they knew in their hearts that the python was about to eat them.
<br><br>
"Stand aside!"
<br><br>
Zen bellowed. Instantly, he turned into a giant version of himself. He was hundreds of feet tall now. Before the python could react, Zen reached down and grabbed it by the head.
<br><br>
Even though Zen had activated the Wild Body, his power was not increased by much. Still, his size made it a fair fight between him and the python.
<br><br>
The red python tried to open its jaws but it was smothered in Zen's grip. It twisted and thrashed, but to no avail. Zen lifted the python into the air and threw it over the side of the bridge.
<br><br>
The snake roared one last time.
<br><br>
The red python fell into the infinite darkness, until they couldn't hear it anymore.
<br><br>
Most of the people in the group, including Chaim, had never seen Zen change into a giant. They had been so focused on the python that they initially failed to recognize that the giant who had saved them was Zen.
<br><br>
They stared at him for several moments, stunned, before coming to their senses.
<br><br>
"Thad's thrown the red python off the bridge!"
<br><br>
"I thought we were doomed!"
<br><br>
"Damn, we lost six more disciples!"
<br><br>
They paused, remembering the six who had been killed by the python.
<br><br>
Those who survived were grateful to Zen for saving them. If he had hesitated for even a moment, more of them would have died.
<br><br>
"I don't know how deep the darkness goes. The python comes from the Dark Region, so it may not be killed simply by falling into the darkness. We should cross the bridge as soon as possible," Zen said.
<br><br>
Everyone sobered up at Zen's warning.
<br><br>
The two kinds of creatures they had met in the Dark Region were stronger than they had ever imagined, so it would not be wise to underestimate the place.
<br><br>
Without Zen, even Hutton and his people would have given up already.
<br><br>
They were not afraid of taking risks. But they would not court death in the face of impossible odds.
<br><br>
"Let's keep going!"
<br><br>
They resumed walking forward on the bridge, trying to move as quickly as they could.
<br><br>
They kept a sharp lookout for further threats, but it looked like the python might have scared those human-monkey monsters away. They did not show up again. Indeed, compared to the tribulations of the first half, the second half of their journey across the bridge went very smoothly.
<br><br>
After an hour, Zen saw the end of the bridge.
<br><br>
The bridge led to a path on the ground, which was lit by a dim yellow light.
<br><br>
Zen squinted. He saw that the path eventually became forked. There was a hut at the end of each of the three forks. Three lit candles had been placed in front of the huts.
<br><br>
The candle at the furthest hut was too dim to light up the fork.
<br><br>
Chapter 3286 The Strange Road With the sudden appearance of three mysterious wooden huts in the Dark Region, many great races in the Source World itched to explore them.
<br><br>
While, up to this point, they had different theories as to what the huts hid.
<br><br>
Zen and his group stood apprehensively before the huts now.
<br><br>
Everyone held their breath in excitement. Finally, the huts were but a stone's throw away! However, considering the dangers they had just faced prior to getting here, no one dared approach the huts. Instead, they all looked towards Zen for guidance.
<br><br>
It seemed everything was up to him now.
<br><br>
"Everyone, follow me," Zen ordered as he cautiously stepped off the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
The candles in front of the huts lit the bridge and the forks only.
<br><br>
It meant there was no other way to go but straight towards the wooden huts.
<br><br>
Without hesitating, Zen set foot on the narrow road at the foot of the bridge.
<br><br>
Slowly but steadily, he approached the nearest hut.
<br><br>
At first glance, the hut looked quite ordinary. People wouldn't have paid it any heed if it were in any other place, but they were in the Dark Region, a forbidden place.
<br><br>
Zen gently knocked on the door.
<br><br>
Knock, knock.
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, there was no response.
<br><br>
"This hut seems to be unoccupied," Elvinia said, breaking the silence. "We don't know what creatures are living in the Dark Region."
<br><br>
Chaim nodded. "Open the door," he urged.
<br><br>
If ever there was a creature within, there was no telling they'd be able to understand what it was.
<br><br>
Zen hesitated. But, they had come all this way to find out what was in the huts.
<br><br>
Pressing his hand against the door, he pushed it open.
<br><br>
"Wow!" Sally, who was standing behind them, gasped. "It's so beautiful!"
<br><br>
A light had suddenly burst forth from the doorway once Zen pushed the door open. When their eyes finally adjusted, they were at a loss for words at what lay before them.
<br><br>
Elvinia and Dorothy both dropped their jaws, unable to conceal their awe.
<br><br>
On a massive shelf standing against the wall of the hut were some strange crystals. Each one seemed to emit different colored lights that danced off the wall, creating a stunning effect.
<br><br>
Zen reached out and took one of the crystals, inspecting it closely. To his disappointment, he discovered that it didn't hold any Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
Even though treasures that didn't contain this power were still valuable on the Other Shore, Zen had no interest in them. After all, he was in search for an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elvinia, Dorothy, and the others eagerly took crystals to study carefully.
<br><br>
"What are these crystals used for? It seems like there's no energy fluctuating within them."
<br><br>
"Doesn't matter. It'd still be good to take some back!"
<br><br>
"I want some, too!"
<br><br>
A number of disciples and the Nine Li people activated their space rings to store some of the crystals.
<br><br>
Zen walked away from the hubbub. He then noticed some white threads hanging from a corner of the wooden hut. They had been knitted into bunches. Upon a closer look, Zen realized what they were.
<br><br>
"Do you know what it is?" No. 9527 asked, as though reading his thoughts.
<br><br>
"The candlewick?" Zen asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
"Yes, those crystals are the unique wax mines in the Dark Region," No.
<br><br>
9527 replied. "This wooden hut is probably used to make candles." Zen noticed a hint of caution in No. 9527's tone, as though it were worried about something.
<br><br>
Zen frowned, puzzled. When he crossed the Sea of Truth, the number of whirlpools in the sea was constantly increasing.
<br><br>
Candles were very precious in the Dark Region. Supposedly, those in the Lust World were brought here from the Desire World. Even No. 9527 didn't expect that they would be made in Stage Thirteen directly.
<br><br>
"So?" Zen urged No. 9527 impatiently.
<br><br>
"Didn't you think it was strange when you left the bridge? There are always demons and monsters lurking in the Dark Region, yet this area is so quiet.
<br><br>
It's too abnormal. Maybe the human-monkey monsters and the red python do not dare to approach this area," No. 9527 said. "After all, even creatures of the Dark Region need candles."
<br><br>
Candles had always been rare. It was too bizarrely extravagant for someone to light up the long wooden bridge using the candles. Just how powerful was the owner of these huts? "So you mean..." Zen knitted his brows.
<br><br>
"Hurry up and leave here," No. 9527 ordered firmly. "It's difficult for even my master to deal with some of the strong creatures in the Dark Region, let alone you."
<br><br>
"Your master is no match for them?" Zen asked incredulously.
<br><br>
In his eyes, the Chaos Ancient Gods were the strongest beings. It shouldn't have been a problem for them to explore the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"No," No. 9527 replied with a trace of regret. "Both the Dark Region and the Other Shore are not subject to the rules of the truth. Some creatures hiding in the Dark Region had mastered the power of the truth before. In their time, they were also called the Chaos Ancient Gods."
<br><br>
Although there was a slim chance those creatures would appear in Stage Thirteen, Zen was worried about the owner of the huts.
<br><br>
If the one who had built these huts returned, Zen would not be able to defeat him or her.
<br><br>
"Put down all those crystals and let's get out of here," Zen barked to the others urgently.
<br><br>
While many crystals were left on the shelf, even Elvinia and Dorothy had pocketed some. They were considerably rare treasures after all, though they didn't contain Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
"Why should I put the crystals back?"
<br><br>
"I don't think anyone will come back to the wooden hut."
<br><br>
"Why are you asking this?"
<br><br>
Everyone protested. Neither the disciples nor the members of the Nine Li race were willing to go. They had been through so much to get here, and since the crystals were the only thing of value inside the hut, they were eager to take some. Otherwise, the journey was for naught.
<br><br>
Seeing how everyone wouldn't budge on the crystals, Zen shook his head in frustration. "Fine. But we have to leave now. Let's go back to the wooden bridge."
<br><br>
Zen was worried about their safety.
<br><br>
He had experienced a lot in his life, so he knew he could take care of himself. But he could only hope to protect the others.
<br><br>
Survival was the only thing that mattered in places like the Dark Region. It wasn't worth it to lose a life over some shiny, new objects.
<br><br>
Despite him not gaining anything new from this journey, he wasn't frustrated. More than anything right now, he just wanted to get out of here before the owner of the three wooden huts came back.
<br><br>
With Zen's strained tone, it finally dawned on the others that danger was heading their way. They quickly followed Zen out of the wooden hut and headed down the road.
<br><br>
The road wasn't long, and they should've reached the foot of the bridge in no time.
<br><br>
However, once they reached the intersection of the three roads, to their surprise, the door to the wooden hut stood before them.
<br><br>
"What happened?" Chaim frowned.
<br><br>
The others looked at each other, confused.
<br><br>
"Keep going!"
<br><br>
Zen also frowned. No. 9527 was right. The creature that dared to make candles here was by no means ordinary.
<br><br>
The group dashed towards the road again under the guidance of Zen.
<br><br>
However, just as Zen stepped on the intersection, they somehow kept ending up at the entrance to the wooden hut again and again.
<br><br>
Chapter 3287 Fear As the disciples and the Nine Li people repeatedly showed up at the entrance to the hut, they felt a surge of panic.
<br><br>
Exchanging anxious glances at each other, they turned to Zen in the hopes that he'd have an answer to this madness.
<br><br>
"Is it a magic array?" Dorothy guessed in a low voice.
<br><br>
Hutton shook his head. "Impossible. If it was a magic array, we would have detected some energy fluctuations."
<br><br>
Souls on the Other Shore usually were much more perceptive of energy fluctuations than if they were in their corporeal bodies. However, no one could sense anything of the sort here.
<br><br>
"Then why can't we leave?" Elvinia demanded.
<br><br>
"Is it possible that this is a magic array designed extremely skillfully in the dark?" Chaim suggested.
<br><br>
Chaim's words made some sense. However, this brought more anxiety than comfort.
<br><br>
The Dark Region was secluded from everything, and seemed to be impervious to light, sound, and energy. Aside from what was lit by the candles, everything else was shrouded in darkness.
<br><br>
If a magic array had truly been arranged in the darkness, they would not have been able to perceive it.
<br><br>
"Let me try again."
<br><br>
Elvinia went down along the road again. But after a dozen or so steps, when she reached the intersection, she found herself in front of the entrance to the hut again.
<br><br>
"We can't get out of here," Elvinia said resignedly.
<br><br>
Zen frowned. Suddenly, the crystals came to mind.
<br><br>
As No. 9527 had said, the candles were precious in the Dark Region. So, it made sense that there would be countermeasures laid out to protect the crystals used to make them.
<br><br>
"Return all the crystals," Zen suddenly said.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had already asked them to return the crystals. But since everyone protested, Zen decided not to push it.
<br><br>
Now that they were stuck there, it seemed they had changed their minds about the crystals.
<br><br>
After all, getting out of there alive was more important than harboring some crystals of unknown use.
<br><br>
So, they all obeyed Zen this time. They all went back inside the hut and returned the crystals. Once all was returned, they stepped outside the hut once more.
<br><br>
Hutton volunteered this time. He walked along the road till he reached the intersection.
<br><br>
Zen and the others held their breath as they watched him intently. If Hutton showed up at the wooden door again, they'd be doomed.
<br><br>
"I passed it!" Hutton called out, waving his hands excitedly.
<br><br>
Everyone let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
"Let's go! We really shouldn't stay here any longer," Zen urged. He still couldn't shake off his worry that the owner of the huts would show up.
<br><br>
The others obeyed without the slightest hesitation. After what they'd just been through, they could tell the owner of the huts was not hospitable.
<br><br>
Everyone trudged back to the wooden bridge along the road.
<br><br>
Just as Hutton set foot on the bridge, he immediately sensed something wrong. He hastily jumped backward, accidentally knocking down two people from the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Hiss! A massive red snake reared its scaly head, biting off one end of the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Hutton had acted quickly; if he had jumped a second later, he would have been swallowed.
<br><br>
Previously, this red python had been tossed off the bridge into oblivion by Zen. Although it had fallen pretty far down, it managed to survive.
<br><br>
The whole time the disciples had been stuck in the intersection of three forks, the snake had slowly climbed along the walls of the mountain, hiding in the darkness.
<br><br>
It had waited for Zen and his companions, poised and ready to strike. But much to its surprise, the one it had tried to bite managed to escape certain death.
<br><br>
The others' jaws dropped, frozen in shock at what just happened.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the python started slithering towards them.
<br><br>
In their panic, they stumbled backwards in an attempt to retreat.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the red python had crossed the bridge. It opened its mouth to take a bite out of the two unfortunate Nine Li people who had just been knocked over.
<br><br>
As they were about to be swallowed whole, a black shadow suddenly shot down from the sky.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Zen landed in front of the two Nine Li people to defend them. After he activated his Wild God Power, his eyes flashed at the massive python that loomed before him.
<br><br>
Zen's body contained hundreds of divine megatons of force, so he could face the beast before him. With a stomp of his foot, the python's open mouth was snapped shut.
<br><br>
"Leave now!" Zen shouted to the two men of the Nine Li race. "I can't hold on much longer!"
<br><br>
When Zen had fought the red python before, he had only managed to throw it off the bridge. In fact, the snake was actually stronger than him.
<br><br>
"Hiss!"
<br><br>
The snake writhed under Zen's foot angrily. How could a mere human trample its head? It raised its tail and violently whipped at Zen.
<br><br>
Even though the others were at a considerable distance, they felt the force of the snake's tail. Terror spread across their faces as they worried for Zen's fate.
<br><br>
The power contained within it was likely to reach several thousand divine megatons. They would be smashed into pieces by such strong power once they were hit in the Source World, let alone on the Other Shore! How would Zen possibly survive the force of the python's tail? Fortunately, Zen was quick-witted. He somersaulted backwards instantly, narrowly avoiding the tail's blow. However, the python too was quick; its tail circled back to whip at Zen.
<br><br>
"Hiss!"
<br><br>
Zen had leapt into the air to dodge the tail. But now, the snake had reacted quickly, and shot its tail towards Zen's body in midair.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to be smashed by the snake's tail, Zen quickly removed the Wild God Power. His huge body instantly shrank, having dodged the tail by a hair's width.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
Zen, who had landed on the ground, immediately ran to the fork leading to the hut.
<br><br>
The red python threw its head back and hissed in fury, its forked tongue dancing ominously. It had been waiting under the bridge for so long, yet it had failed to devour anyone thus far. In its anger, it rushed straight towards Zen and the others.
<br><br>
Zen and the others ran frantically. They had nowhere to hide. Clumsily, they made their way back to the hut.
<br><br>
However, when Zen turned to look back at the red python, something strange happened.
<br><br>
Just as the snake had slithered to the intersection of the three forks, it stopped abruptly.
<br><br>
"Whoosh..."
<br><br>
If Zen wasn't mistaken, there seemed to be a trace of fear hidden in the massive python's narrow eyes. Slowly, the red python backed up slightly.
<br><br>
"The python doesn't dare to come up!"
<br><br>
"It is scared! Haha!"
<br><br>
"A coward!"
<br><br>
Several disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace sneered at the python on the fork when they saw that it had stopped.
<br><br>
After everything they'd been through, they were relieved to see the snake back off.
<br><br>
"The red python dares not come up because it fears the owner of the huts,"
<br><br>
Chaim cautioned. "But what should we do if it just waits there until the owner of the huts comes back?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3288 Blue Twin Stars At this point, the only option to exit was this creaky, wooden bridge.
<br><br>
However, the python remained at the intersection of forks. There was nothing they could do.
<br><br>
Silence took over the disciples as they heard what Chaim just said.
<br><br>
"What should we do now?" Sally whispered hastily.
<br><br>
"What else can we do? Honestly, I guess it's all just up to fate right now,"
<br><br>
one of the Nine Li members said, shaking his head anxiously.
<br><br>
To make matters worse, the python was unpredictable. Even if it did disappear, they did not dare to go onto the wooden bridge. Who knew when the python would return? The way back to the temple was so long, and the chances of returning safely were too small.
<br><br>
Standing beside Zen, Dorothy was not as depressed as the others. As long as Zen stood by her, she was unafraid. There was no reason to fear.
<br><br>
"What if I draw it away?" Zen asked the bunch.
<br><br>
Dorothy thought about it quickly and then shook her head in disagreement.
<br><br>
"You're no match for this python. Moreover, even if you can lure it away, how far can you go? You couldn't go into the dark, right? Then after it finishes you, it will come back for us. We would die as well."
<br><br>
"I can lead it into the Dark Region," Zen said.
<br><br>
"I know." Dorothy nodded, thinking of the candles in her space ring. She already had a rough idea what was the use of these candles. "But your speed can't compare with the python's, and there are so much more threats in the Dark Region. The result will be the same."
<br><br>
Of course, she didn't want Zen to sacrifice for nothing.
<br><br>
Facing the python, everyone began brainstorming. Some people even tried to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune, but it was just wishful thinking to want to leave here by such an easy way.
<br><br>
"Hoo..."
<br><br>
Just then, the red python began to wriggle. When it opened its mouth, its long tongue made a strange sound.
<br><br>
"You fool! Go back!"
<br><br>
…… …… In desperation, these disciples even tried to use words to drive the python away.
<br><br>
Of course, that idea flopped, and the beast remained motionless on the ground, yet threatening.
<br><br>
The rules and competition in the Dark Region were also cruel, so the residing creatures also had to rack their brains to capture more prey.
<br><br>
However, the python had no choice but to wait there, as Zen and his group chose to stay on the spot.
<br><br>
Time went by and there was no progress.
<br><br>
Hutton walked back and forth to think. Meanwhile, Chaim searched for some clues inside and outside the hut, but in the end, he found nothing. He could only move within the range of light, which was too limited for him to even go around.
<br><br>
An hour later, Zen felt a violent vibration under his feet.
<br><br>
"Dong!"
<br><br>
The vibration spread out like a wave, resounding in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Neither Zen nor the Souls of Light could feel the energy fluctuating in the dark, so once they felt the vibration, they knew it must have been going on for a while.
<br><br>
Even the red python resting on the ground raised its head in curiosity. Its eyes were filled with vigilance.
<br><br>
Just then, it instinctively hid. After crawling for a while on the ground, it went towards the darkness under the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
"What on earth caused the vibration? Look, even the python seems a little rattled!"
<br><br>
"Is it possible that there is an even stronger being approaching?"
<br><br>
"There can't be anything more terrifying than the python. This can't be!"
<br><br>
Just as they discussed, a loud bang came again, and this time, it was followed by a more outrageous, violent vibration.
<br><br>
In the same moment, it was as if a huge monster waved across the bridge.
<br><br>
When it passed through, the crowd vaguely recognized a shadow: a fluffy giant hand.
<br><br>
"Oh my God!"
<br><br>
"What's that?"
<br><br>
"I'm doomed..."
<br><br>
The python was already so frightening to them. At the looks of it and considering the vibration, this creature was probably a thousand times larger than the red python. Everyone's hearts were slowly sinking.
<br><br>
When the huge red hand flew to the bottom of the wooden bridge, it completely disappeared in the darkness.
<br><br>
About six seconds later, Zen and the others felt the soles of their feet begin to quake. Afterwards, they saw the giant hand emerging from the darkness.
<br><br>
It reached out and grabbed something like a bug.
<br><br>
No, it was the red python! Compared with the enormous hand, it looked just like a tiny little centipede.
<br><br>
The giant hand brought the python into the darkness, as two blue lights flashed. With that, everyone saw a huge face. It was a huge ape face.
<br><br>
"It's the Blue Twin Stars in the Dark Region!"
<br><br>
"So, the Blue Twin Stars are... They are... seem to be... The eyes of a giant ape?"
<br><br>
"Such a terrible beast has been at the Stage Thirteen all this time!?"
<br><br>
Everyone was aware that the Dark Region was some sort of massive, dark energy that remained out of reach. Once being swallowed by it, there would be no possibility of returning.
<br><br>
Oddly enough, some strange lights would flash in the Dark Region once in a while.
<br><br>
And when the candles of the three huts were lit up, countless creatures in the Source World were immediately drawn to the light.
<br><br>
While, the most famous part of the Dark Region was always the majestic Blue Twin Stars.
<br><br>
The Blue Twin Stars appeared in various places. Sometimes, they would approach the entrance to the Stage Thirteen. Other times, they would be at the middle or at the end. But it was known that the Blue Twin Stars would only appear in the southern Dark Region; never the northern one.
<br><br>
Every time the Blue Twin Stars appeared, there would be a violent shock, which was known as the Other Shore Earthquake.
<br><br>
Because of that, almost every race took the Blue Twin Stars as the sign of an earthquake. The sign worked every time, making the wise warriors in those powerful races feel confused.
<br><br>
Now the answer was unveiled.
<br><br>
In this distance, they could finally see what was behind the Blue Twin Stars very clearly.
<br><br>
Those were not stars. They were the eyes of a huge ape! The ape's body was too huge, which was why there was a dramatic quake every time it moved.
<br><br>
This mystery had lasted for thousands of year.
<br><br>
Zen believed he still had a little chance to resist the red python. However, he knew that he was no match for the huge ape.
<br><br>
The once arrogant python was sent into the ape's mouth and chewed.
<br><br>
Because of the darkness between them, they could hardly hear the chewing sound. However, the picture the python was chewed into pieces frightened them to the core.
<br><br>
Some of them began to regret.
<br><br>
If they had known this was going to happen, they wouldn't have joined the exploration in the first place. This was no place for ordinary beings.
<br><br>
Chapter 3289 A Three-eyed Boy After swallowing the red python, the huge ape closed its eyes.
<br><br>
That was the last they saw of it as its face naturally blended into the darkness and disappeared.
<br><br>
None of them knew what happened in the Dark Region. Was this huge ape perhaps reaching out its hand to them? Or was it actually preparing to smash them all into bits? Dorothy grabbed Zen's hand in fear while Elvinia continued to look around nervously.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the giant, hairy hand appeared in front of them again! This time, it was curled up like a fist.
<br><br>
Its sudden appearance stressed out everyone present. Some warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Nine Li race even trembled in fear.
<br><br>
Zen himself felt the domineering pressure that emanated from this giant fist.
<br><br>
To their surprise, however, the giant fist did not slam down to smash their fragile souls. Instead, it slowly descended, like it was dragging something in its hold.
<br><br>
They watched the fist unfurl and reveal to them a boy.
<br><br>
He looked like any other eight-year-old human boy, save for one unique feature.
<br><br>
A third eye, right in the middle of his forehead.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but stare.
<br><br>
The little boy was injured. Zen could see that both his shoulders were broken and the left side of his face was bleeding. However, he didn't seem to be in any pain.
<br><br>
"I was fighting with those black monkeys when I found that I caught the fish. You're such a bummer!" the three-eyed boy whined, stomping his foot and shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Fish?"
<br><br>
Zen's and Chaim's hearts both trembled in fear.
<br><br>
The light from the three huts had felt like a trap.
<br><br>
It was just so convenient: a shining road, a stable-looking bridge, and three lit huts.
<br><br>
There were times when clarity was only granted after experiencing a disaster. This situation right now seemed to be a fair example. None of them really knew anything about the Dark Region, after all.
<br><br>
"Excuse me. What do you mean by fish?" Hutton asked, respectfully cupping his hands to the boy.
<br><br>
A powerful ape was under this three-eyed boy's control which meant that he wasn't anyone that should be trifled with. Hutton knew he had to be careful of what he said.
<br><br>
"I mean you guys," the three-eyed boy answered.
<br><br>
He then suddenly sprang up from the huge palm and sniffed the air.
<br><br>
"You're all weak."
<br><br>
"Too weak..."
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy meant what he said. These Souls of Light were terribly weak. Even the ants of the Dark Region were a hundred times stronger than them! As he sniffed, his eyes caught Zen and a strange expression flashed on his young face. "Huh? At least there's a body here. I don't know how you entered the Other Shore. But since you're here, just stay. The others can just go to hell."
<br><br>
The way this three-eyed boy casually sentenced death upon these Souls of Light stumped everyone present.
<br><br>
All of them took a step back, their breath surging from this threat.
<br><br>
They knew there was no way they could defeat this formidable opponent but that didn't mean they were going to give up that easily. Hutton and his group once again showed the shadow with three heads and six arms, Elvinia's soul burned with golden flames, and Dorothy's Necklace of Mystic Soul emanated power in waves.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
"Splash!"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Their joint attack was formidable.
<br><br>
Nobody in Stage Thirteen would dare confront this attack head-on, save for Zen's body.
<br><br>
However, it was still too weak against this formidable opponent. Without even lifting a finger, the three-eyed boy summoned a ray of light out of his third eye, forming a green hoop that began to circle the Souls of Light.
<br><br>
Then their theurgies that had stimulated the powerful force disappeared.
<br><br>
As the group's attack was blocked, Zen took this chance to rush towards the boy.
<br><br>
Zen's attempt made the boy sneer. He tilted his head as if inviting him to come closer.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was an arm's length away, the boy suddenly reached out and grabbed his right hand. With minimal movement, he flipped Zen over and smashed him onto the ground! "Bang!"
<br><br>
Previously invincible Zen found himself powerless against this three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
After tossing his assailant into the ground, the boy once again released a ray of green light from his third eye. "Puff, puff, puff, puff..."
<br><br>
This light pierced through all the warriors' chests, forming a gruesome string of souls.
<br><br>
Pierced by this strange light, the warriors found themselves no longer in control of their souls and could only stare at the three-eyed boy in shock.
<br><br>
Only Elvinia's Soul of Light was left behind.
<br><br>
"Your soul fire is useful, so you can stay," the boy told her. "The rest will go to hell now."
<br><br>
However, before the boy could exterminate everyone, Zen found the strength to shout. "Stop!"
<br><br>
The boy pouted, his eyes full of malice as he looked at Zen. "Do you actually think you're qualified to stop me?"
<br><br>
As soon as he said that, the green light on his third eye flashed and a soul of the Nine Li race began to get sucked in.
<br><br>
"Tod!"
<br><br>
"Tod!"
<br><br>
This grisly sight of their member dying caused great pain and sadness to Hutton, Sally, and the others. Unfortunately, they had no means to resist.
<br><br>
"Since Elvinia and I are fish, we must be useful to you! We'll do whatever you ask, just don't kill them!" Zen cried out, eager to negotiate with the boy.
<br><br>
"To kill them or not to kill them, the choice is all mine to make, not yours.
<br><br>
At the end of the day, you will still have to serve me," the boy said with a shrug as another person's Soul of Light shrank and was sucked into the green light.
<br><br>
"You kill one more person and Elvinia and I will kill ourselves rather than serve you," Zen demanded, meeting eyes with Dorothy who stood not far away.
<br><br>
Dorothy stared blankly at Zen. His words touched her heart.
<br><br>
One more soul and it would be her turn to get sucked into the green light.
<br><br>
Dorothy didn't really feel any fear in dying but she still appreciated his gesture. "Zen..."
<br><br>
Elvinia didn't really want to give up her life but she couldn't refute Thad's words. Hearing what Dorothy called him though stunned her.
<br><br>
"Zen?"
<br><br>
Elvinia repeated, staring at Thad with suspicion.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy did not care for these Souls of Light which was why he was making quick work of exterminating all of them. That elaborate trap he had set up took a lot of time along with waiting for actual victims to show up. Now that he managed to fish up Zen and Elvinia, there was no way he was willing to let go of them. He had no way of knowing when the next group of creatures would break into the Grand Sky Temple and he might have to wait for another long while. Most importantly, Zen's body was extremely rare and valuable.
<br><br>
It was at that moment that the three-eyed boy finally hesitated.
<br><br>
Chapter 3290 Hint The three-eyed boy hesitated for barely a second, but Zen caught it immediately.
<br><br>
'He poured all efforts into arranging the three huts and this wooden bridge —clearly, he didn't want to get nothing.' "If you let them go, Elvinia and I will work for you! No complaints! I promise they won't dare tell anyone what they've seen here." Zen looked at the boy in earnest, showing his sincerity.
<br><br>
To that, Dorothy stared at Zen blankly.
<br><br>
She had stayed by Zen's side for a long time on the Other Shore. He had always managed to get rid of the obstacles before him and marched forward as an invincible soldier. But when he did meet someone he knew he couldn't defeat, he chose to sacrifice himself to make a feasible compromise. It was something that never would've even occurred to Dorothy.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy gave it a thought for a moment before sneering. "I don't care if they tell anyone else. So long as you two stay!"
<br><br>
With that, the eye on his forehead closed shut, making the green light that strung the Souls of Light together disappear. Everyone was then released from the hold of manipulation.
<br><br>
"Get out of here!" He pointed toward the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
With him and the giant ape there, no other creatures of the Dark Region dared to approach the wooden bridge. It was a safe route for them to return to the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
"Dorothy," Zen suddenly started, "I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to meet Elvinia…your best friend… again."
<br><br>
This statement had Elvinia feeling confused. Dorothy was by no means her best friend. She had no clue as to what Zen was planning.
<br><br>
But Dorothy, clever as she was, understood the situation immediately. She turned around and gave Elvinia a hug. "Elvinia, my dear, I'm sorry that you must stay behind. If you get the chance to leave someday, I swear we will meet again!"
<br><br>
As she spoke lovingly, she grabbed Elvinia's right hand and entwined it with hers behind the latter's back. Simultaneously, Dorothy activated her space ring.
<br><br>
Elvinia could tell that both Zen and Dorothy were implying a course of action through their words. When she felt Dorothy activating her space ring, she activated hers as well, assuming that perhaps Dorothy was going to hand her something.
<br><br>
When the Sumeru Spaces collided with each other, Dorothy stuffed the candles into Elvinia's space ring.
<br><br>
It was done in a mere blink of an eye. Dorothy then turned around and put on a pained expression. Covering her face, she followed her companions as the warriors rushed onto the bridge and began their return journey to the temple.
<br><br>
Dorothy's little act was so flawless that the three-eyed boy suspected nothing.
<br><br>
Not wanting to waste any more time on these Souls of Light, he turned to Zen and Elvinia. "Follow me!"
<br><br>
The two didn't dare show any signs of disobedience. They followed behind him quietly up along the fork.
<br><br>
The boy glanced at the first hut and said, "You've already been in this one.
<br><br>
Do you know how to use the stuff inside?"
<br><br>
"Seems to be some kind of ore," Zen responded thoughtfully.
<br><br>
Zen's judgment satisfied the three-eyed boy. He then nodded and reached out, a candle appearing in his hand. With a flick of his finger, the candle was lit with a green flame.
<br><br>
"In the Dark Region, these candles are in high demand," he explained calmly. "The ores are called Burning Crystal—they are the candle's main ingredient. Your task is to make these candles in there."
<br><br>
This strange task stunned Elvinia, but Zen showed no sign of surprise.
<br><br>
Since No. 9527 told him of the materials' origin, he already had a good idea of what the boy was going to have them do. "You're very strong—strong enough that making these candles would be a mundane task for you," Zen remarked. "Why did you go to such lengths to lure people here from Stage Thirteen?"
<br><br>
If he wasn't satisfied with the Souls of Light this time around, would he have killed them all? "The Dark Region is not as simple as you think. I still have to deal with the black monkeys… Besides, we can't stay in the light for too long."
<br><br>
Something like yearning flashed across the boy's eyes as he spoke.
<br><br>
While he was, indeed, very strong, so were the rest of the creatures that filled the Dark Region.
<br><br>
But being strong had a price—they were trapped in the darkness forever.
<br><br>
Many places of the Other Shore were filled with light, but it was something they could only long for in the dark.
<br><br>
While they could obtain light from the candles, this was a short-lived pleasure. Even with a mild candle, bathing themselves in light for too long could be fatal.
<br><br>
Then, the boy led the two to the largest and tallest hut.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
With a light breath, he blew out the flame of the candle in his hand.
<br><br>
The third hut's light wasn't connected to the other two. Without candlelight, Zen and Elvinia had no way to escape.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
As the boy waved his hand, the door swung open on its own. "You two have to figure out how to make the candles yourselves. Make sure they're ready before I return or I'll make sure you regret it."
<br><br>
The boy believed he was being kind enough. Previously, he never would've let the Souls of Light go. But if they didn't prove to be capable of honest work, he had many means at his disposal to make their lives a living hell.
<br><br>
On that note, he turned around, jumped away and into the darkness. Once he fell into the candlelight again, he landed on the giant ape's hand firmly.
<br><br>
"Buzz! Buzz!"
<br><br>
Two spots of blue light appeared in the darkness again.
<br><br>
"Boom... Boom... Boom..."
<br><br>
The giant ape's heavy steps had the entire Dark Region shaking, as well as the wooden bridge and even the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
"He's gone!" Now filled with excitement, Dorothy started, "I… I want to go back!"
<br><br>
But Chaim shook his head firmly. "Dorothy, quit daydreaming. Our survival is already a great blessing. Even Thad would scold you for being stupid enough to return to that place!"
<br><br>
They couldn't quite perceive what special restriction was arranged by the powerful boy in the Dark Region. Going back there meant courting death.
<br><br>
"But..." She was still filled with reluctance.
<br><br>
"Fate will bless Thad. If anyone can get through this, it would be him,"
<br><br>
Hutton reassured her.
<br><br>
While the Nine Li people failed to gain much from their journey to the Grand Sky Temple, they had obtained something else—the strong man with a physical body just so happened to be of their royal bloodline.
<br><br>
At this point, everyone was concerned about Zen's life. They knew they had to report this to the race elders the moment they returned to the Source World.
<br><br>
Still gathered outside the temple were many Souls of Light. They had no chance of entering the temple, let alone knowing what had happened in the Dark Region. Instead, they pointed to the Blue Twin Stars and discussed amongst themselves.
<br><br>
Chapter 3291 Boiling When the three-eyed boy left them be, Elvinia turned to Zen with a grim expression.
<br><br>
A thought struck her about the man's real identity.
<br><br>
Some moments earlier, in the face of death, Dorothy had called out Zen's name, which was bewildering.
<br><br>
When appearing on the Other Shore with his physical body, Zen assumed a different name, changing his voice along with it. This made it impossible for anyone to recognize him.
<br><br>
But after hearing how Dorothy called after him, Elvinia noticed something — studying 'Thad' in front of her, she couldn't help but compare him to Zen's image in her mind. Their silhouettes seemed to be almost identical.
<br><br>
While she now bore many great doubts in her mind, she didn't feel it right to voice them out just yet.
<br><br>
Standing at the door, she asked, "Now what do we do?"
<br><br>
Zen merely shrugged and pointed inside. "What else is there to do? We just have to do as he ordered."
<br><br>
"But Dorothy…" As she spoke, Elvinia raised her hand.
<br><br>
As Zen realized that Elvinia was about to activate her space ring, something in his expression changed.
<br><br>
He couldn't tell if the three-eyed boy was still hiding in the darkness around him. It would be bad for them if Elvinia exposed what she had in her space ring.
<br><br>
"What did Dorothy say to you?" Zen asked abruptly, cutting off her attempt to reveal the candles.
<br><br>
She frowned but understood that he meant to keep the candles concealed.
<br><br>
Well aware that she wasn't a good liar, Elvinia just pouted and said stiffly, "Nothing."
<br><br>
"Let's go inside and have a look," Zen said before entering the hut.
<br><br>
It was much wider than the other two below. The shelves on either side were filled with colorful Burning Crystals, while several narrow vessels of various lengths were placed on the shelves that faced the door.
<br><br>
Behind the vessels were a few white, cotton threads, used as candle wicks.
<br><br>
Seeing all the mundane resources in the hut, Elvinia felt the onset of a headache.
<br><br>
Did she really need to do such menial work as candle-making? In the Phoenix Palace, it was common to see Glint Pearls as large as a house. The ingenious craftsmen would carve the pearls into various shapes, dotting the palace corners.
<br><br>
There, candles, used only by mortals, were such a rare matter.
<br><br>
"Are we really going to make candles for him?" Elvinia asked, sounding reluctant.
<br><br>
"If you don't want to die, you'd better just do what he said," Zen replied.
<br><br>
She blinked in confusion. "But the candle he lit can light up the surrounding space in the Dark Region. If we manage to make some, won't we be able to run away with them?"
<br><br>
The third hut was separated from the road by pure darkness. Without the help of candlelight, they had no way of escaping it.
<br><br>
Zen found Elvinia's naive assumption rather amusing. He pointed to the door and said, "Why go through so much trouble? There's a candle right there. You can try it yourself."
<br><br>
And so Elvinia did as he suggested.
<br><br>
Leaping to grab the candle that sat on the door, she tried to pull it out.
<br><br>
But the moment she reached for it, the candle turned into a phantom.
<br><br>
Elvinia could still see the light and feel the heat emanating from it, but she couldn't touch it at all.
<br><br>
"Even a fool would know we will try escaping with the candles. The threeeyed boy isn't stupid enough to leave us here without making sure we couldn't leave on our own," he explained with a shrug. "I'm afraid that even if we succeed in making a good number of candles, we won't be able to light them up."
<br><br>
He had pinned his hopes on the candles that he had obtained from the bottom of the Sea of Truth. But before he could figure out how to light them up and where to escape, he first had to make the boy's candles.
<br><br>
Although he wasn't completely sure of the exact candle-making process, he knew he could figure it out using the materials in the hut.
<br><br>
The mortals in his inner world had tried every means possible to obtain fire since the very beginning of their civilization.
<br><br>
The first candles they created were made of animal fat and beeswax.
<br><br>
But there were no such materials in the hut. Zen knew from both No. 9527 and the three-eyed boy that there, Burning Crystals were the main candlemaking ingredient.
<br><br>
He figured the first step to their task was melting and boiling the crystals.
<br><br>
With that point in mind, he walked up to the shelves and grabbed several Burning Crystals with both hands and turned to a corner of the hut.
<br><br>
There was a large pot in the corner, right beside a box of green powder.
<br><br>
What was interesting was that Zen could sense Other Shore Power in neither the pot nor the powder.
<br><br>
Everything on the Other Shore supposedly contained a certain amount of Other Shore Power, including every grain of sand on the ground. Since matters within the hut did not contain such power, Zen figured they were collected from the Dark Region. As he examined the substances, Zen grew more interested in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Zen threw all the crystals into the pot with a loud, clanging sound.
<br><br>
Then, he picked up the box to pour some green powder evenly over the crystals. "It's your turn now," he said to Elvinia.
<br><br>
"What should I do?" She asked, confused.
<br><br>
"The three-eyed boy left you here because you can use soul fire. He might've already tried to kill you, otherwise," Zen explained. "The crystals need to be melted and boiled by your soul fire — that is your role here."
<br><br>
Silently, she nodded and got to work.
<br><br>
With a flick of her right hand, a golden whip rolled out from her sleeve.
<br><br>
The golden whip was created by her divine flames. Under her control, it turned into a light-yellow flame that burned under the large pot.
<br><br>
From the side, Zen observed the process. The Burning Crystals didn't show signs of melting anytime soon, but when the green powder was heated, it integrated quickly into the Burning Crystals. Zen's brows shot up — he thought it would take more time for the crystals to start melting.
<br><br>
While he was deep in thought, Elvinia suddenly broke the silence. "My soul fire is not very powerful."
<br><br>
The sudden shift in topic was unexpected, but Zen smiled and said, "Well, your soul fire is powerful enough on the Other Shore. Even Efrain's soul fire is far less powerful than yours."
<br><br>
"I know someone with flames much more powerful than mine. If she employs her preternatural fire on the Other Shore, I bet it would have power much greater than the divine flames of the Sun Crow race," Elvinia explained calmly.
<br><br>
"Really? Is there someone in the Source World with flames more powerful than yours?" Zen was doubtful about it — the divine flame of the Sun Crow race was the most powerful flame he had ever witnessed in the entire Source World.
<br><br>
"Of course, there is," Elvinia laughed. "My disciple's preternatural fire is both unique and miraculous. When my mother activated it with her secret skill, the fire nearly burned up the entire Phoenix Palace. It's incredibly powerful. My disciple suffered from her own fire's counterattack and almost..."
<br><br>
As Zen listened to Elvinia's words, he stared intently at the Burning Crystals in the pot. They gradually showed signs of melting.
<br><br>
But his brow shot up at the mention of Elvinia's disciple.
<br><br>
'Elvinia is still so young herself.
<br><br>
When on earth did she accept a disciple?' he wondered to himself.
<br><br>
But on second thought, he recalled once hearing Laquisha, Lavender, and Nelly addressing her as 'Little Master' during his visit to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
'A disciple who possesses powerful flame… isn't she talking about Laquisha?' he was taken aback by the sudden revelation.
<br><br>
Chapter 3292 The Legendary Fire Crow Laquisha's preternatural fire had always been considered to be one of the mysteries in the divine land.
<br><br>
In the early days, even Samuel didn't know about why it existed.
<br><br>
Since Laquisha left the divine land, her cultivation base had improved greatly. She was able to hone her preternatural fire even if she did not know where it came from.
<br><br>
It soon dawned on Zen just how serious things were. "The counterattack of the fire?" he asked with his heart beating rapidly in his chest. "What happened to her?"
<br><br>
Elvinia heard the anxiety in Zen's voice. She was actually skeptical about Zen's identity, and his reaction confirmed her guess. "This has nothing to do with you, right?" she replied with a cold smile.
<br><br>
"Tell me! What happened to her?" Zen clenched his fist and stepped closer.
<br><br>
His aura grew boldly.
<br><br>
He left the girls with Elvinia because he thought that the Phoenix Palace was a safe place as it was the core of the whole Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
He didn't expect anything bad to happen. Now he was worried.
<br><br>
Zen's reaction surprised Elvinia. He was standing directly in front of her with the veins of his neck bulging in anger. Elvinia summoned a golden whip and charged it at Zen's face.
<br><br>
Zen snickered. The divine flames of the Sun Crow race had already failed to harm his physical body while he was in the Source World. It was much less of a threat to him right then.
<br><br>
He reached for the divine flames and broke the golden whip into pieces.
<br><br>
With the other hand, he grabbed Elvinia by the collar and shouted, "Tell me!"
<br><br>
"She...she's fine!" Elvinia stammered. "Why are you so angry?" she added with a trembling voice.
<br><br>
A huge wave of relief swept over Zen. For a moment, he was calm. And then he quickly realized Elvinia's real purpose. It was obvious that she was testing him.
<br><br>
Elvinia calmed down and sneered. "You are indeed a disciple of our Oneness Sky Palace, Thad. Or should I call you Zen?"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened. His identity was finally revealed. He could no longer deceive Elvinia. What she had just said meant she'd been suspicious of him for a while. Zen sighed. "Is Laquisha really okay?" he asked once more.
<br><br>
"My mother helped her. How could she not be fine? Once her bloodline is activated, her strength will greatly increase. She has such a great talent; it would be a great pity if she wasted it by staying by your side all the time,"
<br><br>
remarked Elvinia.
<br><br>
"Her bloodline?" Zen's brows furrowed.
<br><br>
There was no doubt that Laquisha was Samuel's biological child. Although the bloodline of the Han Clan was certainly not bad in the divine land, it was nothing special in the Source World.
<br><br>
According to Elvinia, Laquisha seemed to have a rare bloodline.
<br><br>
"She has the Fire Crow bloodline. Her fire is called the 'Sprite Fire',"
<br><br>
Elvinia explained. "The Fire Crow is a legendary bird with a crane-like body, a single leg, and a white beak. It's a kind of firebird. Its presence means that a fire-related disaster will occur. The fire that took place in the Phoenix Palace has proved this legend."
<br><br>
"Fire disasters?"
<br><br>
Zen recalled Laquisha mentioning this in the past. When she was a child, she was unable to control her preternatural fire. She would cause a fire from time to time. The Han clan had to arrange a private palace for her.
<br><br>
Elvinia's words coincided with that story.
<br><br>
But why and how did Laquisha acquire such blood line? Even if the Han Clan had any kind of blood inheritance, it could only be related to the Nine Li race. Zen could not understand how the Fire Crow could have anything to do with their bloodline.
<br><br>
"You haven't been honest with me. I've been so good to my three disciples."
<br><br>
Elvinia gazed coldly at Zen as she continuously produced divine flames of the Sun Crow race to heat the pot.
<br><br>
She was able to bond with Laquisha and the other girls previously. While they did not disclose their origins, they did talk about their relationships with Zen.
<br><br>
Dorothy hated Elvinia, especially after Zen had saved her from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
At that time, Elvinia wasn't able to figure out Zen's identity. She was in awe of him. If she didn't figure it out this time, he would have pretended to be someone else for much longer.
<br><br>
Elvinia knew that she wasn't regarded as much by Zen. She hated the feeling as any woman would.
<br><br>
Zen gave a wry smile and said, "The fact that my corporeal body can enter the Other Shore can't be known by many people."
<br><br>
Elvinia became silent. She went on letting out the divine flames and was lost in thought.
<br><br>
The flames hissed.
<br><br>
Once the green powder was inside the Burning Crystals and under high temperature, it turned into fine green threads. These threads spread in all directions like blood vessels and erupted almost silently. The Burning Crystals cracked.
<br><br>
Then, these Burning Crystals all became rice-sized crystals. The pot was eventually filled with clear colorful "rice". Zen could even smell a calming scent of flowers.
<br><br>
"It looks gorgeous," Elvinia commented.
<br><br>
She did not stop heating the pot. Eventually, the rice-sized crystals melted and turned into a translucent thick liquid. Finally, it was almost done.
<br><br>
Zen suddenly remembered something he had to do. He swiftly turned and walked towards the other side of the wooden hut. He pulled down the white cotton threads hanging on the wall, twisted them into wicks and put them into vessels of various lengths.
<br><br>
Then he picked up the big pot and poured the liquid into the vessels.
<br><br>
Zen carefully and calmly did his task as if it wasn't his first time to do such work.
<br><br>
If Elvinia hadn't been stuck with Zen, she would have thought that Zen had been working here for a long time. He had the perfect skills, after all.
<br><br>
"I figured out the method through the few items in this hut. Once the wax solidifies, then it's done," Zen explained.
<br><br>
"Can we try to light up the candles we made?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
"Let's try." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
In no time, the wax was already dried up and densely packed together, turning into white candles.
<br><br>
Elvinia pointed at a candle, and a golden flame rushed towards it. However, no matter how many times the flame got in contact with the wick, the candle wouldn't light up.
<br><br>
"There must be a specific way," Zen said nonchalantly as though he had already expected the result.
<br><br>
Elvinia sighed. "So how can we leave?" she asked in a hesitating voice.
<br><br>
Zen rubbed his chin to think. "Maybe if we could finish the task in advance, the three-eyed boy would let us go," he said.
<br><br>
No matter what they had to do, he couldn't let her take out the candles in her space ring within a short time. He didn't even bring up this option.
<br><br>
After comforting Elvinia, he put more Burning Crystals in the big pot and spread the green powder on them. She continued to heat them up.
<br><br>
Then he held the vessels in his hand and pulled out the embedded candles one by one.
<br><br>
They continued to work in harmony for at least ten hours. Soon after, they had more than forty candles.
<br><br>
After using up all the Burning Crystals, Zen and Elvinia finally had the time to rest. They leaned on a wall of the wooden house, and rested as they waited for the three-eyed boy to return.
<br><br>
Chapter 3293 Stealthy Communication The mysterious black was deep and all around, blocking all eyes from seeing anything. Nothing but loneliness was left in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Previously, the other disciples had been there with them, but even then, they had found it hard to resist this lonely and gloomy feeling. Now that Zen and Elvinia were left alone, the uncomfortable feeling overwhelmed them even further.
<br><br>
The huts had seemed mysterious and fascinating when they had seen them from the Other Shore. But once they were inside them, they knew they were nothing but candle workshops. This disappointing fact added to their depression, especially after they found that their freedom had been taken from them.
<br><br>
"The other disciples will return to the Oneness Sky Palace and report our situation to my mother... She is going to be so worried..." Elvinia murmured, staring at the flickering candlelight that was casting ghostly shadows around them.
<br><br>
"You are right, but her worries won't take us out of here," Zen remarked, shaking his head and heaving a sigh.
<br><br>
They had no way of leaving the Other Shore. The Illusion Breaking Rune had been rendered useless, and they couldn't be forcibly woken up by friends in the outside world, either.
<br><br>
And no matter how powerful Flamine was, she couldn't descend from the upper stages of the Other Shore to come to their rescue. In fact, even Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin couldn't find a way to help them at this point.
<br><br>
The Other Shore was a special type of place. Most of the time, it could be considered safer than most other places in the Source World. Almost all kinds of predicaments could be faced using the Illusion Breaking Rune only. However, if someone were unable to get out, then the Other Shore would become the most dangerous place.
<br><br>
"What if the three-eyed boy refuses to let us go?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
"Right now, I don't know," Zen replied briefly with a shrug.
<br><br>
If they continued with this topic, it was highly likely that Elvinia would mention the candles hidden in her space ring. Therefore, Zen decisively stopped the conversation.
<br><br>
They waited in front of the hut for another two hours.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Blue Twin Stars emerged in the dark sky above them, and the ground beneath them began to shake.
<br><br>
"The giant ape is back now..." Zen muttered, his eyes flashing into alertness.
<br><br>
The first time they had seen the three-eyed boy, he and the giant ape had appeared together.
<br><br>
Going by that, the giant ape's return could be considered a sign of the threeeyed boy's return. Still, Zen was worried that the three-eyed boy would merely hide himself in the darkness around them, choosing to observe them without being noticed.
<br><br>
Several loud thuds resounded in the darkness as the ground continued to shake.
<br><br>
Before long, the sound ceased abruptly somewhere close to the hut.
<br><br>
A giant hairy hand stretched out from the darkness and spread at the door of the hut.
<br><br>
Then, the three-eyed boy stepped down from the giant ape's palm. He had been bloodstained all over his body when they had seen him before. But now, he was injured even more severely. One side of his face was scraped very badly, and his arm was covered with several lacerations. Numerous small, black bugs were wriggling and biting the flesh within his wounds.
<br><br>
"These black bugs..." Zen mumbled.
<br><br>
Despite the extraordinary experiences and insights he had, Zen felt an inexplicable sense of fear in his heart when he saw the black bugs, as if they were the nemesis of the physical form of all creatures.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy got down in front of the hut and stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
The candle that was burning in front of the door flew into his hand, which he circled around his arm, shining the light at the black bugs on his wounds.
<br><br>
Some sizzling sounds could be heard when the light fell on the bugs.
<br><br>
The black bugs seemed deathly afraid of the candle. They had been greedily biting the three-eyed boy's arm, but when the candle-light fell on them, they crazily writhed in pain. Very soon, they dropped down dead. The boy waved his arm slightly and shook the remaining corpses to the ground.
<br><br>
As if noticing the careful gaze Zen was casting at him, the three-eyed boy explained flatly, "These Black Helmet Bugs are not afraid of fire. They fear only light..."
<br><br>
All the creatures in the Dark Region were afraid of light, including the three-eyed boy himself.
<br><br>
However, some of them were powerful enough to endure the candle light for quite a long while, while others would quickly succumb to the light.
<br><br>
In front of their very eyes, the Black Armor Bugs' corpses on the ground were very soon neutralized by the candle light and they vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
The strange thing was that the corpses of the Black Helmet Bugs emanated a faint black light before they completely dissipated. Zen noticed the phenomenon and wondered, 'Does everything in the Dark Region conflict with the substances of the outside world?' While Zen was still focused on observing and thinking, the three-eyed boy spoke up, "Show me the fruits of your effort. If you can't prove your value, it will be pointless for me to keep you here."
<br><br>
"So will you let us go?" Elvinia asked in surprise.
<br><br>
Zen sighed to himself and thought, 'Elvinia is so naive.' The three-eyed boy merely sneered in reply and walked into the hut. As soon as he entered, his eyes fell on the candles placed in the corner. Zen had collected the candles he and Elvinia had made and placed them together.
<br><br>
The vessels had also been returned to their original position.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy glanced at the candles for a while before he reached out and grabbed one in his hand. He then nodded with a satisfied expression on his face. "Your first candles are good enough. I will spare your lives so you may work for me," he said.
<br><br>
Hearing his comments, Zen finally heaved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy then fetched more Burning Crystals from another hut below. He placed them at the center of the third hut. Together, the crystals made a big pile on the floor. After giving them a few more orders, the boy jumped onto the giant ape's palm and left in a hurry.
<br><br>
The ground shook severely as the boy and the ape galloped away.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia watched them until their figures vanished into the darkness.
<br><br>
Very soon, the place returned to silence.
<br><br>
"He seems in quite a hurry, doesn't he?" Elvinia said.
<br><br>
"You are right. His injuries are getting worse each time, and he stayed here for a much shorter period this time," Zen nodded.
<br><br>
Since the creatures of the Dark Region couldn't survive long in the light, it meant that the three-eyed boy would have to pay a certain price if he wanted to stay in the candle light for any period of time, especially if that period was long. This was an obvious assumption.
<br><br>
The more serious the boy's injuries grew, the more trouble he would have staying in the light, which was why he had to come and go in a hurry each time.
<br><br>
Zen pondered over his assumptions as he threw a few Burning Crystals into the pot. After he had poured some green powder over them, he asked Elvinia to release her divine flames to melt the crystals.
<br><br>
While Elvinia was releasing the divine flames, she suddenly asked, "We can't light up these candles. I am wondering how the three-eyed boy lights them up."
<br><br>
Zen shook his head and replied, "I don't know, but I have a feeling these candles we made are unfinished. I think that he conceals the last stage from us."
<br><br>
Zen was wondering why Elvinia had suddenly raised such a question when she waved at him and said, "I believe there are at least three candles that we can light up. What do you think?"
<br><br>
Three was the exact number of candles Dorothy had handed over to her secretly. Elvinia had attempted to inquire about them, but had been interrupted by Zen every time. She understood that he wanted to conceal them from the three-eyed boy, and therefore, decided to ask about them cleverly.
<br><br>
Zen instantly understood the undertone of her words and replied, "Yes, I suppose so. We may give it a shot after the work is done. But there's no hurry for now. In any case, the three-eyed boy doesn't seem that bad. Maybe he'll let us go at the right time after we make enough candles for him."
<br><br>
"I agree," Elvinia nodded.
<br><br>
She was smart enough to get Zen's real meaning: the three candles from Dorothy could be lit up, but right now wasn't the time. They would light up the candles and escape only when the time was ripe.
<br><br>
Some distance away in the Dark Region, the three-eyed boy was sitting in the giant ape's palm and healing himself.
<br><br>
Beside him, a round black curtain was floating in the air gracefully. If creatures from outside the Dark Region looked into this curtain, they would see nothing. The curtain would just be that for them; a curtain. However, through this black curtain, the three-eye boy could see every movement of Zen and Elvinia, as well as hear their conversation.
<br><br>
"Let you go? Huh, in your dreams!" The three-eyed boy sneered and waved his hand. The round black curtain disappeared immediately.
<br><br>
The Burning Crystal mine had been taken over by the black monkeys. They were very strong creatures, and successfully plundering the Burning Crystals from them was no small achievement. The three-eyed boy had recently obtained a large amount of those Burning Crystals, but the price was that he had suffered a lot of injuries.
<br><br>
Fortunately, his candle workshop had already been on. The drudges he had found — a human male and a female — were quite efficient, therefore, he had decided on working hard to plunder more crystals now.
<br><br>
Chapter 3294 Wounded Every single time the three-eyed boy returned, he would carry along with him some Burning Crystals.
<br><br>
If there happened to be too many Burning Crystals, he would stuff them into the huts below. But if there were not many Burning Crystals, he would toss them directly to Zen.
<br><br>
At the beginning, the three-eyed boy was indifferent to Zen and Elvinia. But eventually, after they got to see each other more often, he grew more comfortable and friendly with them.
<br><br>
Once, the three-eyed boy even brought back a small mountain of Burning Crystals and took out a small black toad. As the toad was revealed to light, its body began to emit traces of black light.
<br><br>
He handed this toad to Elvinia as a gift.
<br><br>
With a nasty glimpse at the dark strange creature, Elvinia, of course, was in no way going to accept this.
<br><br>
Just then, the three-eyed boy directly threw the toad to her. The moment it came into contact with her, it seeped into her soul. Then, Elvinia felt that her soul force began to surge. It turned out that the black toad was actually more effective than soul crystal itself.
<br><br>
Elvinia was in shock. The three-eyed boy scoffed coldly and walked away.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen continued to study the properties of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Every time the mission of making candles was completed, Zen squatted outside the hut and sat at the junction of candle light and darkness, trying to understand the properties of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
He took down some pieces of wood from the corner of the hut, carefully placing them in and out of the darkness.
<br><br>
For some reason, the wood sticks remained unchanged.
<br><br>
In addition to this experiment, Zen also poked candles into the darkness.
<br><br>
Still, when he took them back, the candles didn't alter in any way.
<br><br>
"It should be because of the energy!" he gasped.
<br><br>
Like candles, the wood sticks from the hut didn't possess any energy fluctuation. The materials that didn't contain energy fluctuation or the Other Shore Power could freely go in and out of the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Sands, stones, the Souls of Light, and corporeal bodies on the Other Shore all contained some level of energy. If these things fell into the Dark Region, something would definitely occur to them.
<br><br>
"Elvinia!" Zen called out, excited.
<br><br>
Elvinia walked over with an unwilling expression on her face, but she still took out an Other Shore Token from her space ring.
<br><br>
Zen's corporeal body could not carry the Sumeru Space, so he could only study with Elvinia's things.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token Elvinia took out was an ancient sword, which was said to have been found and retrieved from Stage Twelve.
<br><br>
With great caution, Zen held the ancient sword in his hand and slipped its tip into the darkness.
<br><br>
He had no clue what was occurring in the darkness, but he definitely felt the energy fluctuations from it. When Zen pulled the sword back, the sword tip was missing, as if it had been trimmed off by the darkness.
<br><br>
At the sight of this, the faces of Elvinia and Zen changed dramatically.
<br><br>
They remembered that when they crossed the wooden bridge behind the Grand Sky Temple, many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace fell into the darkness.
<br><br>
Although they knew what happened to them—death, they never thought that the Dark Region was so cruel to living beings in the light.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the front end of the ancient sword and thought for a while.
<br><br>
Then he suddenly thrust the sword into the darkness and struck the ground.
<br><br>
Before the sword disappeared completely, Zen began to press it down as he pried some type of substance from the ground into the light.
<br><br>
It was only black soil, but under the candlelight, it melted like the snow in summertime as it released its energy.
<br><br>
"The light and darkness are as incompatible as fire and water...
<br><br>
In theory, if we enter the Dark Region, we would just meet our own deaths.
<br><br>
In the same way, the creatures in the Dark Region, like the three-eyed boy, the red python and the human-monkey monsters, should then die once exposed to the light of the candle." Zen was tremendously dumbfounded.
<br><br>
"But they didn't. What keeps them unharmed by candlelight? And can we use such things too?"
<br><br>
As long as he was free, Zen would spare no time to do anything else except study.
<br><br>
However, Elvinia was not very interested in such things. All she could do was to support him in any way that she could.
<br><br>
In fact, Elvinia wanted to chat with him about the Phoenix Palace and her three disciples. But whenever she asked Zen where he came from, the man responded with silence. She eventually learned to just let go of the topic for good.
<br><br>
However, the more Zen refused to tell her, the more curious she became.
<br><br>
She had made up her mind that if she could survive this time, she would have to interrogate the three disciples when she returned to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy already knew that Zen and Elvinia were trying their best to escape, but he never attempted to stop them.
<br><br>
Because they were confined to the small hut, their resources proved to be limited and were simply not enough to allow them to enter the Dark Region. In some sense, the Dark Region held them like prisoners.
<br><br>
"This is for you!"
<br><br>
When the three-eyed boy returned this time, he threw a handful of green fruits right towards Zen.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Zen took the fruits, and stuffed them into his mouth, as if he was famished.
<br><br>
Not long after he swallowed them, he felt like his internal organs began to burn within him. The fruits that grew from the Dark Region continuously released energy, and the energy had directly turned into Zen's physical strength.
<br><br>
Zen's physical strength increased very slowly, but surely. Compared to the Other Shore Power that came from the Other Shore Token, his physical strength was meager.
<br><br>
However, with the help of the fruits, his strength increased rapidly which took him by surprise.
<br><br>
Looking at Zen's surprised expression, the three-eyed boy was a bit proud.
<br><br>
He said, "Work hard here, and you will benefit in the future."
<br><br>
Although the three-eyed boy seemed to have ice in his veins, he was quite generous to them. There were great treasures everywhere in the Dark Region, all of great value.
<br><br>
Days passed and they were almost weary.
<br><br>
There was no difference in day and night on the Other Shore. But Zen thought ahead, and he made sure to keep an accurate record of it from the very beginning.
<br><br>
He and Elvinia had been in the candle workshop for three months, and they had made about a thousand candles.
<br><br>
In desperation, Elvinia repeatedly hinted towards Zen that after the threeeyed boy and the giant ape had left, they would just light candles and escape.
<br><br>
However, Zen had been a bit hesitant about this idea. If the three-eyed boy had been monitoring them or had set traps in the surroundings, they would be in trouble.
<br><br>
There was only one chance for them to escape, and Zen must remain extremely cautious to ever succeed.
<br><br>
It was the first week of the fourth month, and Zen and Elvinia were hard at work to make wax.
<br><br>
Just then, they began to feel the ground shake. With a quick glance at each other, they wondered why the boy had returned so soon.
<br><br>
As they approached the door, they were met once again with the huge hairy hand stretching out from the darkness. Dark red blood began falling from it, like a red rain. Because the blood belonged to the Dark Region, it released energy and quickly disappeared when the light from the candle met with it.
<br><br>
"Whose blood is it?" Zen frowned slightly.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The giant ape's hand unfurled after landing on the ground, and Zen and Elvinia let out a large gasp. The three-eyed boy was lying in the palm of its hand, drenched in goopy blood. His skin was bitten by probably numerous monsters. Zen and Elvinia had no idea whether he was dead or alive at this point.
<br><br>
Chapter 3295 A Strange Black-and-White Tree The Blue Twin Stars floating in the darkness continued its descent. Then, the giant face of the ape appeared in the candlelight.
<br><br>
Seeing the face of the ape up close, Elvinia felt a little scared. She took a few steps back and hid behind Zen.
<br><br>
"Don't be afraid." Zen reassured her.
<br><br>
The ape's face slowly came near Zen. Afterwards, a huge gap appeared in it as it opened its mouth to speak. The voice that came out of it was a bit muffled.
<br><br>
"Save... Him!"
<br><br>
The words of the giant ape were quite unclear. It seemed like it wasn't used to speaking the language of humans. However, Zen and Elvinia heard it clearly.
<br><br>
"You want us to save him?" Zen looked a bit hesitant.
<br><br>
He only had limited treatment methods on the Other Shore. Furthermore, the three-eyed boy was from the Dark Region. Basically, his structure was very different from theirs.
<br><br>
"Swoosh... Swoosh..."
<br><br>
The giant ape covered the top of the hut with its enormous hands. It did a pressing-down motion meaning that it would crush the hut down. At the same time, its mouth opened and said, "If he dies, you'll die too!"
<br><br>
If it did crush the hut with its hands, Elvinia and Zen would absolutely die.
<br><br>
They wouldn't have any chance to escape.
<br><br>
Zen had no other choice now but to save the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
"How will we be able to save him?" Elvinia asked in despair.
<br><br>
Zen carried plenty of soul pills, soul crystal, and even some special soul treasures inside his space ring. Unfortunately, these secret treasures could only save the Souls of Light, not the flesh body from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Besides, his space ring wasn't with him.
<br><br>
"I can give it a shot," Zen replied but he wasn't entirely confident.
<br><br>
Even though his body was unable to use Shade Stone on the Other Shore, it could still activate the cinnabar field. Thus, he might still be able to utilize the power of the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
The same thing could also be applied to the Godly Ways.
<br><br>
Despite the fact that it sounded crazy to use a Godly Way to treat the creatures from the Dark Region, Zen had run out of options.
<br><br>
The huge ape did not seem smart but there was no doubt that it would do what it said. Simply put, if they managed to save the three-eyed boy's life, they would live. But if he died, they would die as well.
<br><br>
Zen squatted down, getting close to have a careful examination on the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
The boy's eyes were closed as he was lying motionless on the ground.
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his hand and pressed his fingers against the boy's neck.
<br><br>
As his skin came into contact with the boy's skin, he immediately felt a burning sensation.
<br><br>
"Sizz..."
<br><br>
Zen's fingers were burned black. Meanwhile, the three-eyed boy's neck was also marked with black fingerprints.
<br><br>
No matter what, the energy of the Dark Region would always melt that of the light.
<br><br>
Zen already predicted that kind of reaction.
<br><br>
However, this was truly troublesome. It complicated things even more.
<br><br>
The energy of the Life Godly Way would work completely against that of the Dark Region. There was only a faint possibility that they would be able to save him.
<br><br>
At that point, the only thing Zen could do was release the internal momentum from his cinnabar field.
<br><br>
A strong aura of life emanated from the Life Godly Way. This green aura swiftly curled into a wisp. As Zen gently pointed at the three-eyed boy with his finger, it swept towards him.
<br><br>
"Sizz, sizz..."
<br><br>
The green aura was able to heal the wounds of humans quickly and effectively.
<br><br>
When it touched the body of three-eyed boy, however, it corroded his body instantaneously. It left black earthworm-like scars on his body.
<br><br>
As he saw what happened, Zen stopped at once.
<br><br>
"What's going on? What happened?" Elvinia asked in a serious and worried tone.
<br><br>
"He is from the Dark Region. All of our treatments are like fatal poison to him," Zen replied.
<br><br>
"Hoo, hoo..."
<br><br>
The giant ape that hovered above the hut also saw what happened. Its huge eyes displayed a hint of sadness. It obviously had a deep relationship with the three-eyed boy. Now, it realized that there was a high chance the threeeyed boy would die. Naturally, this caused distress to it.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
"Sizz, sizz..."
<br><br>
A teardrop with the size of a huge wooden barrel fell from the giant ape's huge eye.
<br><br>
This teardrop also belonged in the Dark Region. It quickly dissipated as it passed through the candlelight. Meanwhile, it continuously released energy.
<br><br>
Witnessing this, Zen's heart skipped a beat.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he stood up and gestured at the giant ape. He asked loudly, "Why... are you not hurt even when you're in the candlelight?"
<br><br>
Ordinary articles of the Dark Region would be immediately destroyed in the candlelight.
<br><br>
However, the creatures of the Dark Region that Zen had ever met were not quite scared of the candlelight. The truth behind this must be simple enough. Maybe it was just very easy to resist the candlelight in the Dark Region. Otherwise, the mere act of making candles would be courting death.
<br><br>
"Hoo?" The giant ape looked confused.
<br><br>
Zen thought for a moment and then jumped up and pulled a long hair out of the giant ape's hairy hand. After that, he threw the hair into darkness and pulled it back from it. At the same time, he asked, "Why... are you not afraid of the light?"
<br><br>
The giant ape stared back at Zen and appeared in thought for a long time.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, it made a sound coming from its throat and showed an expression of understanding. The enormous face and pair of equally enormous hands hastily left the candlelight and dove into the darkness.
<br><br>
"Boom, Boom, Boom..." Its footsteps thundered loudly away from them.
<br><br>
Watching the giant ape leave at such a brisk pace, Elvinia asked, "Do you think it really understood what you said?" She seemed concerned.
<br><br>
"Hmm. Maybe..." Zen answered. He was unsure of it either.
<br><br>
Elvinia gazed at the three-eyed boy lying on the ground. And then she faced Zen and said, "Let's run away now. In any case, that giant ape looks stupid.
<br><br>
It won't be back in such a short time. Now that this boy has fainted, it is our chance to escape!"
<br><br>
Zen's face displayed a hint of uncertainty as he gazed at the face of the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
It was true that now might be the best time to escape. In addition to that, he didn't have a deep relationship with the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, it was still difficult for Zen not to save him. Moreover, he was already getting along with him for the past days.
<br><br>
Anyway, the most crucial thing for Zen right now was to determine how the creatures in the Dark Region were able to survive in the candlelight. He wondered whether it would be possible for him to come and go in the Dark Region whenever he wanted.
<br><br>
After pondering for a while, Zen told Elvinia, "The wooden bridge is very long. The giant ape might be returning already before we can pass through the bridge. We will still be caught by it."
<br><br>
Elvinia searched Zen's face and looked at him with a conflicted expression on her eyes.
<br><br>
There were actually a lot of opportunities for escape they could have seized these past few months. But, Elvinia noticed that Zen was reluctant to leave.
<br><br>
In any event, Zen could have escaped from the area of the hut as long as he lit candles. He could just run along the wooden bridge to leave here.
<br><br>
She was aware of what Zen was thinking. Despite that, she didn't say anything.
<br><br>
For some unknown reason, she was not in a hurry to leave as well. Even if she was scared most of the time within the candlelight, she felt secured and calm somehow. She wasn't too anxious to run away.
<br><br>
But it didn't matter if she wanted to leave now or not. The opportunity had already slipped through their fingers.
<br><br>
Merely three minutes later, the giant ape had returned swiftly with its footsteps still causing the ground to tremble.
<br><br>
Clatter! Without warning, the giant ape inserted a large tree into the area shone by the candlelight.
<br><br>
They estimated the height of the tree to be about ten feet. It had a normal shape but its colors were very peculiar.
<br><br>
They noticed that the branches, leaves and fruits on the left side were jet black while those on the right side were snow-white. It was unbelievable that a tree produced leaves and fruits with two completely different colors.
<br><br>
"Eat, not afraid of..." the ape said as it gestured towards the black fruit and touched it with its fingertip. "Light..."
<br><br>
Chapter 3296 Treat The Boy Zen gave the strange black-and-white tree an astonished look.
<br><br>
This plant in front of him was incredibly strange and new, something he had never seen before.
<br><br>
The giant ape's words were vague but he heard them clearly. He was now certain that his speculations were completely right.
<br><br>
There was indeed something here in the Dark Region that could make those creatures immune to candlelight, something not that rare that even the red python and human-monkey monsters could get.
<br><br>
The two kinds of fruits of this tree right in front of him! Zen pointed at a white fruit. "What about that one?"
<br><br>
The giant ape also pointed at the fruit. "Eat... Not afraid of darkness..."
<br><br>
This white fruit was useless to the creatures of the Dark Region since they were born in the darkness, but it was a different story for those that came from outside the region.
<br><br>
Elvinia and Zen looked at each other, exchanging a hopeful realization between them.
<br><br>
If they ate this white fruit, would it perhaps be possible for them to walk freely in the darkness? The giant ape continued to point to the fruit. "You... Eat it."
<br><br>
It had been inspired by Zen.
<br><br>
Zen was not a living creature in the Dark Region so the internal momentum of his Life Godly Way had the ability to hurt the three-eyed boy. However, what if Zen merged with the Dark Region? It was with this curious thought that the ape found the tree, uprooted it, and carried it all the way back to the young man.
<br><br>
"Whatever..."
<br><br>
Zen shrugged. He had already eaten a lot of strange foods so he had no problem taking a bite out of this white fruit.
<br><br>
He grabbed one off the tree and casually put the entire thing in his mouth.
<br><br>
As soon as he swallowed, Zen felt a soft energy spread from his stomach to his entire body.
<br><br>
It was powerful and it didn't stop, even going as far as seeping into his cinnabar field.
<br><br>
As he let this strange energy flow through him, Zen began to notice a few changes.
<br><br>
The Dark Region had previously been dark. The only light in this place came from the candles and the giant ape's eyes. However, upon eating the fruit, Zen found himself slowly being able to make out the shapes of things around him.
<br><br>
He saw the blurry shadows of the mountains, various trees, and paths - Zen could now see the Dark Region! "How is it?" Elvinia asked.
<br><br>
"I..."
<br><br>
Zen walked to the edge, gently stretching his hand forward.
<br><br>
He was a bit nervous, especially when his fingers reached the border. He hesitated for a few moments, debating whether or not he should insert his hand into the darkness.
<br><br>
Knowing that he would never really know the result unless he tried, Zen willed himself to cross the border and into the Dark Region. As soon as he did, he felt the gentle energy thrum underneath his fingertips and resisting the darkness.
<br><br>
"It works!" Zen exclaimed happily.
<br><br>
The white fruit had changed his body, allowing him to walk in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
He knew it was far too early to celebrate though. They still needed to deal with the matter regarding the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
Since he now had the ability, Zen figured that he should use the Life Godly Way in order to save the boy.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A ray of green light spiraled out of Zen's body, casting an energetic aura around him.
<br><br>
"Rain of life..."
<br><br>
The green light coalesced above the three-eyed boy and formed a sort of fluffy green cloud. The internal momentum then turned into raindrops that fell on the boy's body.
<br><br>
Zen's internal momentum of the Godly Way no longer came into conflict with the three-eyed boy. Instead, it began to heal his wounds.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Zen found out that the power of the Godly Way remained too weak.
<br><br>
It could work for those at the Other Shore Realm and hadn't yet reached the Chaotic Source Realm since their bodies were roughly on the same level as the True Gods, though the power they could use was hundreds of times stronger than the one used by the True Gods.
<br><br>
Reaching the Chaotic Source Realm meant great improvements to a warrior's body.
<br><br>
This three-eyed boy was a creature of the Dark Region and never experienced the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. Zen, however, couldn't resist the strength he released, which meant his body was at least comparable to that of those at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Using the internal momentum of the Life Godly Way to heal a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm was like using ordinary medical herbs on a warrior's critical injuries. It could work, but it would take an extremely long time.
<br><br>
Two hours had passed...
<br><br>
Four hours had passed...
<br><br>
Six hours had passed...
<br><br>
Luckily for Zen, his inner world was extremely mature and he felt no signs of exhaustion despite constantly extracting internal momentum for a prolonged period of time.
<br><br>
After seven hours, some small wounds on the three-eyed boy's body began to heal.
<br><br>
After eight hours, black smoke began to rise from the surface of the boy's body as his body and the candlelight began to reject one another.
<br><br>
"The protection time of the black fruit has expired," Zen said.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, he did not panic. He reached out and took another black fruit from the tree and force-fed it to the boy.
<br><br>
The black smoke instantly disappeared.
<br><br>
Ten hours passed...
<br><br>
Twelve hours passed...
<br><br>
Green raindrops continued to fall down onto the three-eyed boy's body but some black spots appeared.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
The giant ape groaned, reminding Zen to eat another one of the white fruits.
<br><br>
Zen had already begun to feel the fruit's effects starting to fade but he wanted to know just how long it could last.
<br><br>
It seemed that it could last for fourteen hours at most.
<br><br>
After picking another white fruit from the tree and consuming it, Zen continued to unleash his Life Godly Way. His green life rain now practically soaked the three-eyed boy at this point.
<br><br>
One day passed...
<br><br>
Two days passed...
<br><br>
Three days passed...
<br><br>
Slowly, but surely, the boy's body recovered. Most of his torn flesh had been repaired at this point, though he remained in a comatose state.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the giant ape guarded the hut like a strong guardian.
<br><br>
In the Grand Sky Temple, many people stood and stared idly in the distance.
<br><br>
They could see the three huts, the Blue Twin Stars, but none of them could tell what had possibly occurred.
<br><br>
Dorothy's Soul of Light manifested on a hillside, looking at the distance as she murmured a prayer.
<br><br>
"I know that you are lucky and will be blessed to overcome any misfortune, so..."
<br><br>
Before she finished her words, her Soul of Light dissipated and she retreated from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Her consciousness had returned to the second floor of Zen's house in the Flow Sword Sect, located in the Oneness Mountain of the Oneness Sky Palace, in the Bloom Divine Province of the Source World.
<br><br>
She sat straight up in front of Zen and gazed at his handsome face.
<br><br>
He looked troubled and Dorothy couldn't help but wonder if he met with some kind of trouble.
<br><br>
She stretched her hand and rubbed the wrinkles between his brows. "So...
<br><br>
You will wake up!"
<br><br>
Outside the door, Letitia sat all gloomy and worried. She had been sitting there for days, silent and brooding.
<br><br>
Margaret wasn't as quiet, knocking on the door constantly and shouting at Dorothy to get out.
<br><br>
Dorothy's guards could only glare at Margaret's insolence. Insulting the princess was a grave offense and if it wasn't for Dorothy's orders, they would've taken away this madwoman long ago.
<br><br>
Trish and Carrie were busy serving. They had no idea what was happening but they knew Zen was in danger. To say they were worried about Zen was an understatement.
<br><br>
Chapter 3297 Suspicion One week later, the three-eyed boy's wounds almost healed. He was still constantly infiltrated with the internal momentum of the Life Godly Way.
<br><br>
Since the giant ape had been with Zen and Elvinia over the past several days, it had developed quite a bit of trust in them. Now, it would sometimes leave the three-eyed boy alone with them.
<br><br>
Just now, it had left the hut and was picking up some rare herbs from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
It was true that it didn't know much about medicine making, but being a long-time resident of the Dark Region, it had a fairly good idea of what effect those herbs had.
<br><br>
After returning to the hut, the ape gave the herbs to Zen and tried to inform him of their effect. Zen had finally developed a rough understanding of its words and understood what it was trying to say. He processed the juice of the herbs and fed it to the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
Ten days later, either due to those herbs, or the Life Godly Way, the threeeyed boy finally opened his eyes.
<br><br>
Shaking his head to remove any grogginess, he got up from the ground and looked around vigilantly. He then remarked in surprise, "I'm fine?"
<br><br>
Before falling unconscious, he had thought that he was doomed.
<br><br>
"Hmm."
<br><br>
The ape grunted in response, shaking its huge head with a joyful smile on its face.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy stared at the giant ape and asked, "You brought me back and cured me?"
<br><br>
"Woo?"
<br><br>
The honest ape shook its head at once.
<br><br>
It was true that it had brought the three-eyed boy back from the mine. Some time ago, the three-eyed boy had broken into the area of the Burning Crystal mine, but had been surrounded by several black monkeys. This was not the first time he had dealt with them, so he had not taken them seriously at first.
<br><br>
However, this time, hundreds of black monkeys had rushed out in full force.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy did not realize that he was outmatched until it was too late.
<br><br>
He had only gotten through the siege by spending the last ounce of his strength.
<br><br>
Although he had managed to finally rush out of the mine, the black monkeys had chased closely after him, biting his flesh and draining his blood all the way. In the end, he just wasn't able to resist anymore. He had fallen to the ground in the pool of blood. At that critical moment, the giant ape had stretched out its hand and taken him away fast.
<br><br>
However, the ape believed that it was Zen who had saved the three-eyed boy's life.
<br><br>
It pointed at Zen with its big finger and said, "He... Saved... You... "
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy had been living with the giant ape for a long time now, so he could clearly understand every word it said. When he heard that Zen was his savior, his face was full of doubt.
<br><br>
It was impossible for Zen to save him due to his physical conditions.
<br><br>
Then his eyes swept around, and he saw several large trees inserted around the hut. When he saw the black-and-white trees all around him, his eyes flashed with surprise.
<br><br>
Zen and Elvinia didn't belong to the Dark Region. All their medicines and efforts would prove to be lethal toxins for him.
<br><br>
But with those trees around the hut, things were different.
<br><br>
"You ate the Darkness Fruit?" The three-eyed boy asked as he stared at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen hesitated for a moment before he nodded, "Yes."
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy sneered coldly and continued, "You ate the Darkness Fruit, which means that you had several chances of escaping the Dark Region over the past several days. Why didn't you go away? Why did you stay to save my life?"
<br><br>
After eating the Darkness Fruit, Zen would be able to completely adapt to the environment of the Dark Region and leave the range of the candlelight.
<br><br>
Once they crossed the wooden bridge and left the Dark Region, even the giant ape would have been unable to do anything to them.
<br><br>
But they hadn't escaped. Instead, they had stayed there to save him. In the heart of the three-eyed boy, something was going on. Why would someone sacrifice their own freedom? "Answer me!"
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy roared as the eye on his forehead opened. A ray of green light flashed out and shot towards Zen.
<br><br>
The green light could not only penetrate Zen's body, but also his very soul.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
As the green light penetrated into his chest, Zen was pulled up into the air.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
The huge ape let out a puzzled cry. It had never thought that the three-eyed boy would attack Zen after he woke up.
<br><br>
"Stop it! How can you do this?! He saved your life!" Elvinia stood up and cried at the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
Over the past several days, Zen had spent a lot of energy in trying to save the three-eyed boy. Although he had only expedited the internal momentum, he had done so day and night without a break. But even after that, when the three-eyed boy had woken up, he was returning the kindness with ingratitude! The three-eyed boy ignored Elvinia and stared at Zen with his eyes fixed on him. He wanted an answer; he needed an answer! Zen's expression didn't change much. He could easily endure the pain of being pierced. He calmly asked in response, "Have you always been alone in the Dark Region?"
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy didn't know why Zen was asking this question. He replied coldly, "So what?"
<br><br>
"You don't have any friends... or family?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
"Friend? Family?"
<br><br>
These two words were completely new to the three-eyed boy.
<br><br>
The only creature he could consider as his friend in the Dark Region might be this giant ape. When it came to a friend of the same race, or a member of his family, he indeed did not have one.
<br><br>
Some people said that the fights in the Source World and on the Other Shore had been long and cruel. But compared to those in the Dark Region, they had been nothing at all.
<br><br>
In the Dark Region, there had never been any sort of friendship. All the races had been engaged in endless battle ever since they were born. Only a few lucky creatures who had survived countless bloody fights could find a way out and be summoned by the organization.
<br><br>
Over the past years, the three-eyed boy had climbed up one step after another. If even a single mistake had found its way into the past ten million steps he had taken, he would have been dead.
<br><br>
After going through such a long and cruel experience, he had lost the ability to trust anyone.
<br><br>
To him, Zen and Elvinia should have been ungrateful and angry since they were locked up by him.
<br><br>
But even then, at the time of his death, they hadn't run away. Instead, they had saved him. There must be a plot! "I wanted to explore the Dark Region not only to obtain the Other Shore Tokens, but also to satisfy my curiosity about it," Zen explained. "In the beginning, we did plan to run away. In fact, we were well prepared for that.
<br><br>
But I have a feeling you aren't that bad. You're definitely worth making friends with. I naturally chose to save you."
<br><br>
Worth making friends with? The three-eyed boy's face changed when he heard Zen's words. Some deep and small part of his heart was touched by this sentence.
<br><br>
'If this guy really thinks so, something must be wrong with his brain, ' the three-eyed boy thought.
<br><br>
But somehow, he didn't hate this kind of thinking.
<br><br>
His originally stiff and cold face softened a little. The third eye on his forehead blinked softly, and the green light disappeared. Freed of the flash, Zen fell down to the ground with a thump.
<br><br>
The three-eyed boy then took some white fruits from the black-and-white trees and handed them to Zen. "As long as you are willing to help me make more candles, I am willing to give you more freedom," he promised.
<br><br>
These Darkness Fruits would enable Zen to walk freely in the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Chapter 3298 Black Monkeys While the three-eyed boy was asleep, Zen had managed to hide several Darkness Fruits.
<br><br>
He hadn't expected the boy to give them to him on his own prerogative.
<br><br>
"Aren't you worried about us running away?" Zen asked, staring at the boy.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, the latter smiled coldly. "If you wanted to escape, you should have left by now. I think you're right. Somehow, the resources in the Dark Region attract you. We can work together."
<br><br>
"As friends?" Zen asked with a friendly smile.
<br><br>
The boy glared at him viciously in response before walking down to the hut below.
<br><br>
Because of his serious injuries, he couldn't keep all the Burning Crystals he had robbed from the black monkeys. The hut below was the only place with some reserve.
<br><br>
Making the candles remained the most important task at hand, after all.
<br><br>
After taking all the Burning Crystals to the top hut, the three-eye boy turned and stared at Zen and Elvinia. "You said that you wanted the Other Shore Token?"
<br><br>
The two glanced at each other questioningly.
<br><br>
In the time they spent there, the Dark Region had shown itself to be much more powerful than they could have ever imagined.
<br><br>
While they surely yearned for Other Shore Tokens of the Dark Region, those were things unreachable.
<br><br>
Even Elvinia, who was normally proud and arrogant, realized how great of a chance it was.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Token she had was also highly precious. Although there was a chance for it to grow, she was willing to change it into something from the Dark Region.
<br><br>
"Of course, who wouldn't want it?" Zen replied matter-of-factly.
<br><br>
"Your energy and that of the Dark Region repel each other," explained the boy. "I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to fuse with the Other Shore Token here."
<br><br>
Indeed, Zen had ignored the fact. He scratched his head in embarrassment.
<br><br>
Over the past ten days, he had been constantly observing the phenomenon of repulsion.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Tokens of the Dark Region weren't to be integrated with the creatures outside the Dark Region.
<br><br>
Noticing Zen's expression, the boy continued, "It is indeed very difficult to fuse the tokens, but it's not entirely impossible."
<br><br>
At that, Zen's eyes lit up. "Do you have something in mind?"
<br><br>
"There's one way I can think of…but it isn't the right time. I can help you when that time comes."
<br><br>
"What do you mean by 'the right time?'" Zen asked, confused.
<br><br>
"Once you finish the candles," responded the boy, revealing a rather stiff smile as he gently patted Zen on the shoulder.
<br><br>
Zen could feel his shoulder blade threaten to break into pieces from that gentle pat—the three-eyed boy was undeniably powerful.
<br><br>
Once he disappeared into the darkness again, Elvinia chimed it, "He didn't leave with any warning this time. It seems he isn't afraid of us running away."
<br><br>
"The Darkness Fruit is much more convenient than the candles. He was willing to leave them to me, which means he allowed us to come and go freely," Zen said.
<br><br>
"Then… How about we leave now?" She suggested hesitantly.
<br><br>
Throwing the Burning Crystals into the pot, Zen merely smiled at her. "Let's get to work!"
<br><br>
In acceptance, Elvinia said no more. Instead, she concentrated on melting the crystals.
<br><br>
Previously, Elvinia was worried about being trapped in that place for the rest of her life—she felt the urgency of heading back to the Phoenix Palace any chance she got. But knowing that she could leave at will provided some comfort. In fact, she thought that perhaps staying within the range of the candlelight wasn't such a bad thing—she was free from the endless fights that plagued the world outside.
<br><br>
Taking a Darkness Fruit, Zen walked into the Dark Region.
<br><br>
After having tested it out before, this time, he didn't feel as nervous going into the dark.
<br><br>
Despite what it was, the Dark Region didn't seem to put Zen down.
<br><br>
The energy scattered in the area was no longer repelling Zen after he took a Darkness Fruit.
<br><br>
The dark world shone brightly in Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
The road extending to the huts turned out to be a hillside that led to a cliff.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't tell how high up it was, but every time the giant ape arrived, it walked below the cliff.
<br><br>
For a while, Zen walked along the front of the hillside until he hit a deadend. The path before him had been completely obstructed by shrubs.
<br><br>
"So the huts are in an isolated location…the boy chose the safest area," Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Although he was deeply curious, he figured he shouldn't wander deeper into the Dark Region—it was his first time exploring on his own, after all. He couldn't leave Elvinia alone in the hut for too long.
<br><br>
But just as he turned around to head back, he heard something squeak from nearby.
<br><br>
In the Dark Region, sound fluctuations were also kinds of energy. No one, including Zen, had been able to catch such a sound before. Having immersed himself in the Dark Region completely, Zen could finally hear it clear as crystal.
<br><br>
Squinting into the dark, Zen spotted over a dozen human-monkey monsters jumping up and down, rushing straight at him.
<br><br>
Such bad luck, Zen thought, frowning at the sight of them.
<br><br>
Without a second of hesitation, Zen turned back and rushed to the peak of the hillside.
<br><br>
Even the red python didn't dare go within range of the huts, let alone the human-monkey monsters.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The human-monkey monsters were, of course, far more familiar with the terrain than Zen was.
<br><br>
They were carefree as they bounced and rolled, rapidly closing the distance between Zen and themselves with great flexibility.
<br><br>
Squeak! One of the human-monkey monsters started squeaking loudly as it jumped onto Zen's head, trying to stab his head with its hooked tail.
<br><br>
But Zen was not as weak as the Souls of Light the human-monkey monsters had attacked before.
<br><br>
While he might not have been able to resist a red python's attacks, Zen had no trouble dealing the human-monkey monsters behind him.
<br><br>
Bowing his head slightly, Zen extended his hands as fast as lightning, twisting the human-monkey monster's tail. There was a sudden wave before the monster could only scream and hit another one.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Two human-monkey monsters were knocked straight to the ground as the rest moved in to surround Zen.
<br><br>
He climbed up the slope, as the human-monkey monsters continued coming after him. He simply pulled one up to throw it at the others. Some fell right into the mountain stream.
<br><br>
In almost no time, Zen arrived at the peak of the hillside.
<br><br>
About a hundred feet away from the huts, he settled his pace and calmed down.
<br><br>
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! More and more human-monkey monsters were gathering under the hillside —their numbers going up into the hundreds. But none of them was climbing the hillside. Instead, they sat in rows as though they were welcoming something with respect.
<br><br>
Curious, Zen stayed in his spot to watch.
<br><br>
From a distance, the jungle was in a state of turmoil. A road appeared in the middle where many ten-foot-tall monkeys emerged.
<br><br>
Even from where he stood, Zen could tell that the tall, strong monkeys were all completely black.
<br><br>
Chapter 3299 The Bridge Was Broken "Black... monkeys."
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows in slight curiosity.
<br><br>
Though the three-eyed boy rarely spoke to them, Zen recalled him mentioning that these black monkeys were the creatures responsible for guarding the Burning Crystals.
<br><br>
Since the three-eyed boy was almost killed by them, Zen figured they were strong.
<br><br>
But what were they doing here? A bad feeling began to churn in Zen's stomach.
<br><br>
Chatter! Chatter! Chatter...
<br><br>
As these black monkeys showed up one after another, the human-monkey monsters' voices grew louder. The atmosphere around them was tense.
<br><br>
Just then, this group of monkeys slowly walked towards the hillside.
<br><br>
Zen bowed his body on the hillside and motioned backward. Soon enough, he was within range of the candlelight and made his way towards the little hut.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Elvinia was so focused on making the wax that she hadn't noticed Zen's footsteps outside the hut.
<br><br>
Having made so many candles, she grew to become more and more skilled.
<br><br>
She was even able to discover the best temperature to make wax.
<br><br>
The sound rang for another time, which finally got her attention. She looked up from her spot and was surprised to see Zen rushing in like a vanguard.
<br><br>
Zen never rushed this way. He was always calm and collected.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Elvinia asked lightly.
<br><br>
Although the human-monkey monsters beneath the hillside were extraordinarily noisy, Elvinia couldn't hear their voices as sounds could not pass through the darkness.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Zen handed a Darkness Fruit to her. "Eat it!" he urged.
<br><br>
Elvinia stared at him and furrowed her brows in confusion, "Why? What happened?"
<br><br>
"We don't have time to talk. We need to leave right now or we'll die!" Zen replied hastily.
<br><br>
Looking at Zen's serious look, Elvinia didn't hesitate and swallowed the Darkness Fruit in one gulp.
<br><br>
The Light Fruits and Darkness Fruits had very special features. The moment Elvinia swallowed the Darkness Fruit, traces of black clouds spread from her purple soul. In the blink of an eye, the clouds spread throughout her entire soul.
<br><br>
Zen grabbed her wrist. "Let's go!"
<br><br>
The two rushed out.
<br><br>
"But those Burning Crystals..."
<br><br>
Elvinia couldn't help but look back at the wax she had to stop working on, but there were other things to worry about now. They had no time to care about those Burning Crystals.
<br><br>
The two sped out of the hut within seconds.
<br><br>
But just as they left the hut, the human-monkey monsters and black monkeys had already climbed up the hill.
<br><br>
"Chatter, chatter, chatter?"
<br><br>
"Chatter!"
<br><br>
"Chatter! Chatter..."
<br><br>
Some of those human-monkey monsters saw the two run out of the hut, so they immediately let out a scream to warn the others.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
One of the black monkeys spotted them and instantly rushed towards the two.
<br><br>
As Elvinia saw the shadow that was heading for them, she couldn't help but shout at Zen, "What in the world is that?!"
<br><br>
Of course, Zen was too preoccupied to process any of her questions.
<br><br>
He'd mentally prepared for this exact situation, so the adrenaline in his body erupted without any hesitation.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Under the strong impact, a crater appeared in the open space in front of the hut. Zen, like an arrow from the string, shot towards the wooden bridge, holding Elvinia's hand as tight as he could.
<br><br>
With only one step forward, Zen got on the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
This move was so unexpected that neither the black monkeys nor the human-monkey monsters had time to react.
<br><br>
The black monkey that came at them stopped in its tracks. At first, it was confused, its eyes wide and blinking dramatically. But after a few seconds, it let out a sly grin and turned towards its companions. It raised its right thumb up in the air and slowly dragged it horizontally across its neck.
<br><br>
The other monkeys grew excited and began to jump and groan rowdily.
<br><br>
"Chatter! Chatter! Chatter..."
<br><br>
They dashed towards the wooden bridge, screaming in excitement.
<br><br>
The black monkeys were extremely agile, and climbed the bridge at high speed. But Zen, he was fast, too.
<br><br>
Zen pushed his strength as much as he could after he arrived at the wooden bridge.
<br><br>
Taking Elvinia, he shot both of them forward five hundred feet, one thousand feet, three thousand feet on the bridge. In the blink of an eye, they had run away. The black monkeys could see merely black dots moving.
<br><br>
"Chatter, chatter, chatter?"
<br><br>
"Chatter!"
<br><br>
The creatures were dismayed by Zen's capabilities. How could he do this? Coming to their senses, they decided to go back to the end of the bridge after discussing with each other. They knew they couldn't catch the two even if they tried.
<br><br>
This wooden bridge was made by the three-eyed boy to lure creatures outside of the Dark Region from the Grand Sky Temple. The wooden bridge was very steady, and it was reinforced with an magic array.
<br><br>
It was not easy for the human-monkey monsters, pythons and even Zen to break the bridge with their strength—but the black monkeys could.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
On one side of the hill, several black monkeys alternated punching the area where the bridge met the hill.
<br><br>
After several punches, cracks began to appear across it. As the cracks grew larger, the entire bridge began to creak and shake.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
With a loud bang, a section of the wooden bridge fixed on the hill finally broke off, sliding towards the ravine below.
<br><br>
Zen had no time to care about what was happening behind him. All he thought about was moving forward and never looking back.
<br><br>
"Zen... Zen!"
<br><br>
Elvinia called out from behind.
<br><br>
"Not now!" Zen snapped in a stern voice.
<br><br>
Elvinia puckered her lips. If there was one thing she hated the most, it was being told to shut up.
<br><br>
She was going to warn him of the bridge, but decided it was best to just keep quiet and let Zen continue on.
<br><br>
The bridge had no piers. It was like a line that connected the Grand Sky Temple to the hill.
<br><br>
Because the part that connected with the hill collapsed, the entire bridge began to slope downward rapidly.
<br><br>
After a few seconds, Zen felt the bridge under his feet begin to quake and tilt. Just as he was wondering, the entire bridge grew steeper and steeper. In a flash, instead of running forward, he was running upward! Caught off guard, Zen and Elvinia fell towards the ravine.
<br><br>
"What happened? Is the bridge broken?" Zen asked as they were falling.
<br><br>
Elvinia answered with an impassive face. "That's what I was trying to tell you!"
<br><br>
Zen was struck dumb with the news.
<br><br>
As they were falling towards the darkness, he felt a twinge of regret.
<br><br>
They had no idea how deep the ravine was, so Zen observed their fall carefully as they descended.
<br><br>
After eating the Darkness Fruits, he and Elvinia had become accustomed to the Dark Region. They could see the outline of the things beneath them.
<br><br>
About half a minute later, Zen used all his might to curl his legs and drag Elvinia into his arms. The next moment, he was hurled directly into the nearby bushes.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
It was all right for Zen's body to fall from such a high altitude.
<br><br>
But the Soul of Light was much weaker than the physical body. Zen fell to the ground with Elvinia in his arms, and he made sure to hold her closely to him so that he could take most of the impact. If Zen wasn't careful enough, she might just die.
<br><br>
"Are you all right?" Zen asked with concern, feeling her head and arms for any signs of injury.
<br><br>
"I'm... I'm okay." Elvinia answered in a stammer.
<br><br>
She freed herself from Zen's embrace, feeling some sort of warmth deep within her heart.
