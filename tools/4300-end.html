Chapter 4300 Enclosure This was a result that surprised even the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Restriction Field allowed all living beings and materials in the Source World to remain their original form, including the form of the Source World itself.
<br><br>
"So, you mean the Source World can now be expanded at will?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked with a trembling voice.
<br><br>
If that was the case, expanding the Source World would become extremely simple. All they had to do was take its fragments out so that the fragments could either fly or be transported as far away from the Source World as possible.
<br><br>
"Yes." The Evil God nodded affirmatively with hopeful eyes.
<br><br>
"Then you..."
<br><br>
"I've already sent out my avatars to try to expand the Source World, but I still don't know if the Restriction Field could expand indefinitely," said the Evil God, interrupting what the Grandmaster of Heaven was about to say.
<br><br>
After the Source World had been smashed into pieces, the broken fragments gathered together and formed a long oval belt instead.
<br><br>
Thousands of giant rocks floated at the front most portion of the belt.
<br><br>
Above these rocks were all sorts of creatures and vicious beasts, including snakes, insects, ants, and even ancient beasts. Despite the drastic change, they had all managed to be peaceful.
<br><br>
Even in the face of disaster and destruction, these creatures and beasts remained calm. They only wanted to survive and did nothing more or less than that.
<br><br>
However, even the smartest beasts did not understand what had really happened. They could only curl up and stay cozy in their small caves, looking into the endless void.
<br><br>
At this moment, one of the beasts suddenly began to shiver.
<br><br>
This tall and powerful beast shook as its body started to shrink into a smaller size that later turned into an avatar of the Evil God.
<br><br>
The avatar looked around and fixed his gaze on a triangular rock about ten feet wide. He observed that this rock was very suitable for making a boundary.
<br><br>
"I'll choose you!"
<br><br>
The Evil God flew over and grabbed the bottom part of the triangular rock with one hand.
<br><br>
Because of the powerful aura of the Evil God, the creatures that gathered on the triangular rock scrambled to different directions in fear. However, a python drilled deep into the triangular rock. This was its cave.
<br><br>
After the Evil God lifted the rock in his hand, his fingertips flashed with the power of the Hyperspace Extreme Form. With a gentle pinch of his fingers, the two spaces were connected into one while he had already crossed a long distance with that triangular rock.
<br><br>
"Thirty trillion miles. There seems to be no change in the Restriction Field at all. Can it hold on?" the Evil God's avatar asked himself hesitantly.
<br><br>
Others couldn't perceive the existence of the Restriction Field, but the Evil God could clearly observe it. It was clear as day from his eyes.
<br><br>
At the edge of the debris belt of the Source World, a blue light band floated, which extended to the farthest material. Now that the Evil God's avatar had moved the triangular rock thirty trillion miles away, the blue light band had also extended by thirty trillion miles.
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God's avatar finished speaking, he glanced at the light band in the distance that had stretched out horizontally by thirty trillion miles.
<br><br>
He recognized another avatar who was carrying out the task as well. The real Evil God had sent out a total of eight avatars to expand the Source World in eight directions.
<br><br>
Buzz! Just then, the real Evil God suddenly appeared in front of the avatar without warning.
<br><br>
This space now belonged to the Source World after it had been enclosed by the Restriction Field. He no longer needed to use any space theurgy to appear anywhere.
<br><br>
"There are no pressure on the Restriction Field. It should be able to extend infinitely. Now, take this stone to the edge of the chaos," the real Evil God ordered.
<br><br>
"Yes," the avatar responded obediently.
<br><br>
The avatars that the Evil God created also had their own consciousness.
<br><br>
However, when he created the avatars, he had placed extremely fearsome memories into their minds, which made them believe that he was indeed undefeatable. Only then did these avatars learn to behave.
<br><br>
Although there were still some avatars who made trouble in secret, they became much better than before. The real Evil God didn't worry himself too much about them.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The avatar went away in an instant with the triangular rock in his hand and proceeded with the enclosure.
<br><br>
The poor python that had entered the triangular rock was also brought far away.
<br><br>
In just a few minutes, the area under the actual control of the Source World had already expanded by over a hundred times. This was a huge space that the real Evil God had never imagined before. His ambition was to directly expand it to the entire chaos, and now his plan was slowly falling into place.
<br><br>
One of the avatars flew down to the east and came across a lone pyramid floating in the void.
<br><br>
"The Burial Land..."
<br><br>
The avatar flew past it while still contemplating about it.
<br><br>
It was the Burial Land that planned to destroy the worlds. After the Source World had been broken by the needle, its next goal would definitely be Zen's primitive land.
<br><br>
But now, the avatar could only see the Burial Land while Zen's primitive land had mysteriously disappeared.
<br><br>
What happened? Although he was very curious, he did not stop to find the answer to his question.
<br><br>
He was reminded that he only needed to complete the task assigned by the real Evil God. Otherwise, he would be blamed.
<br><br>
As the avatar included the Burial Land in his enclosure, the real Evil God sensed it with his omniscient power. He then informed the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran, "We've found the Burial Land."
<br><br>
The two men's eyes suddenly lit up. The Grandmaster of Heaven eagerly asked, "Are you going to attack him?"
<br><br>
To him, the "Field" that the Evil God had comprehended was too miraculous. After making the Burial Land part of the Source World, he would certainly take revenge and there was no doubt about it.
<br><br>
"It's not the time yet." The Evil God shook his head unexpectedly.
<br><br>
"Why?" asked Duran, confused with the Evil God's answer.
<br><br>
"Energy," the Evil God said with a frown. "The energy I have is very limited compared to them. They don't have this problem."
<br><br>
Previously, when the downgrader, Zen, and he used the In and Out Holes to strike attacks against one another, he had only suffered a great loss.
<br><br>
His energy was evidently insufficient, so he could only constantly sacrifice the materials of the Source World at the time.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid there's no solution to this problem," said Duran. "Zen has endless energy all thanks to the ancestry-level bloodline, while you can't obtain that ancestry-level bloodline, so..."
<br><br>
He paused as he saw the look on Evil God's face. He didn't mean to question him at all.
<br><br>
The talent that the Evil God displayed had gone beyond his imagination.
<br><br>
Even in the Four Spirits Sect, there was no such highly-talented person.
<br><br>
However, some things couldn't be solved by mere intelligence, such as the problem of infinite energy.
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled faintly and turned to look at the tens of thousands of avatars at a distance. "The rules of the Fields are very clear to me. There are a total of eighty-six kinds. As long as I deduct according to the rules of the Restriction Field, I will soon be able to restore all the Fields."
<br><br>
"If you comprehend all the Fields, your might will be doubled. But you can't release even Extreme Form energies infinitely. The energy consumed by the Fields is surely more unimaginable," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, also worrying about the energy.
<br><br>
"You're right." The Evil God nodded in agreement. "Restoring energy is like sharpening a knife. No matter how sharp a knife is, in the end, it's only a tool. It's useless if one does not have the strength to use it."
<br><br>
With these words, he stared at the void with sharp eyes. He then clenched one hand in the air, and energy started to rotate from his closed fist like a dancing elf. "If I want to become a person who uses the tool, I must know what the most essential energy is. The Fields are not the end. I master not only the rules of restoring the Fields but also the rules of restoring the essence."
<br><br>
Chapter 4301 Memories Inside the Burial Land, the cloud of Probability Extreme Form continued to stretch over the surface, covering it completely.
<br><br>
The figures of the downgrader came into sight and then left over and over again.
<br><br>
In less than a minute, tens of billions of avatars appeared, only to disappear, leaving without a trace. The number was meaningless when it came to infinity.
<br><br>
Over a thousand Zen's avatars in the cloud were killed. His real body was sliced into smaller parts and scattered around the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Despite this, Zen's ancestry-level bloodline, consciousness, and Extreme Form energies were still alive, pushing through the tragedy that had just happened.
<br><br>
Buzz! With all that was left of his power and strength, Zen called his scattered body parts to come together and waited as it took shape.
<br><br>
However, before he could regain his balance, an uncountable number of the downgrader's avatars came to surround him.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
the downgrader's avatars said, launching palm strikes towards Zen.
<br><br>
Zen knew palm strikes were not very great in power. They weren't even strong enough to kill an Eternal Realm warrior.
<br><br>
What worried him was the number of avatars aiming the strikes at him at the same time. Enduring one strike was possible, but to endure tens of billions of strikes at the same time was a different ball game. For all he knew, they could have the power to burn him into ashes in the blink of an eye! 'In the primitive land, I would not die, ' Zen thought to himself. Even if his original body was broken, it would still remain inside the Burial Land.
<br><br>
However, as soon as his parts began to morph into his original body, what was always waiting for him were the downgrader's avatars, ready to attack him with great intensity.
<br><br>
Five times.
<br><br>
Ten times.
<br><br>
Fifty times.
<br><br>
One hundred times.
<br><br>
He had barely stitched his body parts back together, and the avatars were already breaking it down. It would be impossible for him to fight back.
<br><br>
"You're becoming desperate, Zen. I can feel it," the downgrader said. "I was generous enough to give you every chance to surrender, but you're too hard-headed. You still refused. Now, there's no time for regret. You'd better use the only time you have left to say goodbye to this world!"
<br><br>
Buzz! At the foot of a mountain reaching the heavens, Zen's body continued to condense.
<br><br>
However, just as his body began to regain shape, the downgrader's avatars appeared before him again. In a split-second, the giant mountain and Zen were smashed into fine powder.
<br><br>
Regardless, Zen wasn't ready to quit. He quickly began to think of other places where he could continue condensing into his original form.
<br><br>
However, just as he was doing this, he heard a voice call to him. It was the voice of the ancestry-level bloodline. "Zen, stop," it pleaded, sounding very concerned.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Don't do useless things," the ancestry-level bloodline replied, which irritated Zen.
<br><br>
"What do you even mean? Are you saying I shouldn't do anything about this?" Zen asked with anger present in his voice.
<br><br>
In the past, he had been face-to-face with a large number of strong and powerful opponents. For the first time in his life, he had felt so weak.
<br><br>
As the Troubled Creatures were inching closer and closer to the Pear Hill, he knew everything would be destroyed. Everything he had done was going to be for nothing. The thought that he couldn't even do anything about it frustrated him greatly.
<br><br>
The opponent he was facing now was just too powerful to be defeated.
<br><br>
He was busy in his thoughts when the ancestry-level bloodline began to speak again, catching his attention. "I've found Clarence's memories," it said.
<br><br>
"What did you say?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, not being sure if he had heard right.
<br><br>
When the Heavenly Ring Staff was brought back, the ancestry-level bloodline was certain its memories were stored in the crystal, but it had never been able to understand the crystal.
<br><br>
Just a few moments back, Zen's physical body had been crushed into pieces by the downgrader. His body parts, as well as the crystal, merged into the Burial Land. Then, unexpectedly, the memories inside the crystal flowed out.
<br><br>
"You shall inherit Clarence's memories," the ancestry-level bloodline said.
<br><br>
"Why?" Zen asked, furrowing his brows in confusion.
<br><br>
"I'm just a wisp of intelligence from the ancestry-level bloodline. I'm not a part of Clarence. You're more suitable for this," it replied.
<br><br>
Before Zen could ask more questions or refuse, he felt a sharp pain from the back of his brain. "Argh!" he screamed in pain. All of a sudden, endless memories came flooding in, reaching even the deepest parts of his soul.
<br><br>
Boom! After the short, sharp pain was gone, things returned to normal.
<br><br>
He was back in his own consciousness again. After this, he noticed that in front of him lay a pure, blank space.
<br><br>
There was absolutely nothing in it, but for some reason, it didn't make him feel empty. Ironically, it gave him a sense of satisfaction.
<br><br>
"Where am I?" Zen couldn't help but ask, taking in his new environment.
<br><br>
"You're in the perfect land," an unfamiliar voice answered.
<br><br>
"The perfect land? But there is nothing in here. How can this be perfect?"
<br><br>
he asked, confused but curious.
<br><br>
There was nothing in the world that was absolutely perfect, especially considering that everyone had a different definition of perfection. What was perfect for one person could be imperfect to another.
<br><br>
But as Zen spoke, his voice caused countless ripples to appear in the space.
<br><br>
The ripples began to fill the space, and suddenly, the area began to transform. The sky became pure blue. Courtyard walls rose from the ground which was paved with cyan-colored bricks. A group of laughing children ran along the corridor, followed by the adults scolding them for running.
<br><br>
The walls looked similar to those of the fairy palace but even more like those of the Luo Clan's old mansion.
<br><br>
The laughing children were very much like younger versions of Letitia, Margaret, and the others.
<br><br>
Standing in the courtyard, Zen felt a sense of peace and contentment in his heart.
<br><br>
He had no idea how he managed to do it, especially so easily, but he was very happy to have built such a world.
<br><br>
"This is your perfect land. The space you saw just now is my perfect land," the voice said.
<br><br>
"Yes! A world that corresponds to all perfection," Zen exclaimed.
<br><br>
"You're right," the voice said, becoming low. "But everything has been destroyed."
<br><br>
Rumble! The blue sky was overcast with dark, grey clouds. The courtyards collapsed one after another like dominoes. The brick road was blown away by the strong wind, and the children fell to the ground, covered in their own blood. Darkness fell upon the land, devouring it completely.
<br><br>
Although Zen knew what he was seeing was not real, he could not help the sinking feeling in his heart. He was unable to suppress his anger, questioning the voice. "Why did you destroy this world?" he screamed.
<br><br>
"I destroyed it because of him," the voice said.
<br><br>
"Because of whom?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"I call him Mastema, but I believe you know him as the downgrader," the voice answered.
<br><br>
"If this was your perfect land, why was Mastema here?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"He was a wisp of my consciousness. I created him," the voice replied.
<br><br>
Zen began to feel his blood boil even more. "Then why did you create him?" he said, raising his voice.
<br><br>
"At that time, I thought the only perfect world was an imperfect one. This was why I created Mastema. He was necessary for breaking the perfection I created, but I didn't expect things to reach a point that I couldn't handle anymore. I didn't plan for him to be so powerful."
<br><br>
After the voice said this, a black dot appeared and began to expand. It expanded like a bubble, bigger and bigger until eventually, it popped.
<br><br>
It broke into four pieces, which were all connected, forming a giant trapezoid.
<br><br>
'This should be the Boundless Shock World, ' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had told him before what happened in the Levitation Tower.
<br><br>
Because of this, he had a general understanding of the worlds of all grades. 'The perfect land I was just in must be the Boundless Perfect World. Geoffrey has never been there before, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
The trapezoid continued to collapse, turning into rectangular pieces. When the pieces gathered together again, it turned into an even larger trapezoid.
<br><br>
This was the Boundless Secondary World. When this collapsed, the Boundless Void World appeared.
<br><br>
And when this collapsed, another world came to view.
<br><br>
A total of nine worlds appeared and collapsed. In the end, the Stellar World appeared, specifically the Deep Space. Most of its parts had collapsed.
<br><br>
"I realized too late that Mastema would destroy everything. I did my best to chase him down and kill him. However, from the twelfth-grade world to the fifth-grade world, I failed completely," the voice said, sad and full of remorse.
<br><br>
It was much easier to destroy than to create. The downgrader wouldn't stop just like that, especially when he had already begun the downgrade.
<br><br>
Chapter 4302 Infinity And Everything "I had been in the perfect land for such a long time. I thought I could control everything, so I released Mastema.
<br><br>
Then, I started cultivating him bit by bit. I was glad to see him become much stronger.
<br><br>
Especially when we were in the Boundless Shock World, I was deeply elated when I saw the range of destruction that he made. At the same time, I also despised the perfect land. Perfection means that it's already done, and there is nothing else to change. That's why I liked the imperfection of the Boundless Shock World more.
<br><br>
Mastema brought death, but he also brought forth creation and rebirth.
<br><br>
However, he went out of control. That was my biggest mistake and failure."
<br><br>
Clarence's voice became too dispirited.
<br><br>
His confidence was crushed by repeated failures.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Zen wasn't able to respond right away.
<br><br>
He had never thought that Clarence would actually have a depressing personality.
<br><br>
"But, isn't there still a chance?" Zen finally asked.
<br><br>
"Chance? What do you mean?" Clarence replied.
<br><br>
"You have awakened. With your absolute infinite energy and the ancestrylevel bloodline, don't we have a chance to defeat him?" Zen answered with positivity.
<br><br>
"Forget it…" Clarence said with a bitter smile. "I have already defeated him many times. It's still no use. I still wasn't able to stop him from downgrading the worlds," he continued.
<br><br>
"Well, it's better than doing nothing!" Zen retorted, not showing any hint of willingness to give up.
<br><br>
When he first heard of Clarence's name, he had several guesses and high expectations for him. Thus, he was disappointed and frustrated that this person wasn't what he thought he would be.
<br><br>
At the same time, Clarence could actually read all of Zen's thoughts and memories. He could even feel his emotions, but he still didn't care.
<br><br>
The downgrader always treated the creatures born outside of the perfect land as tools, while Clarence saw them as a process.
<br><br>
This included the human beings, the four spirits, the Fostering race, the Cinnabar race, and the Sacred Spirit race.
<br><br>
He saw their existence as a process, and now, that process would finally come to an end. All the positive and negative things that occurred within the process were actually insignificant. Everything would still end at the appointed time.
<br><br>
"Well, if you still want to resist, I can help you. You're already skillful in using the Extreme Form energies, right? The only difference between you and the downgrader is the amount of energy, but I can also give you what he already has," Clarence said unexpectedly.
<br><br>
"Really? You'd do that?" Zen's eyes instantly lit up as he heard this.
<br><br>
"Yes. It's not that difficult for me," Clarence replied indifferently.
<br><br>
"Well, then…" Zen took a deep breath and sincerely said, "Please entrust it to me!"
<br><br>
Clarence didn't say anything but just directly infused some memories into Zen's soul.
<br><br>
Zen quickly and silently read these memories as he received them. After he finished, he suddenly understood why there was such a huge gap between him and the downgrader.
<br><br>
If the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline was likened to a line on a plane, then countless points could be acquired out of this line. This would be deemed as an infinite amount of energy.
<br><br>
However, what the downgader possessed were all the points in the plane.
<br><br>
It was a different kind of infinity that would surely overwhelm even the power of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
With this, Clarence had already bestowed Zen everything he needed.
<br><br>
"Now, you know what you are about to face.
<br><br>
Let me see your resolve. I want to witness what this infinite strength could change."
<br><br>
Clarence had somehow become excited that his voice was even trembling.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! "Come out! You can't just hide for the rest of your life!"
<br><br>
The downgrader knew that he had many ways to kill Zen. However, he still needed to completely destroy the Burial Land before he dealt with Zen.
<br><br>
In order to downgrade the worlds, he needed the primitive land. He didn't want to create a new one, which was why he hadn't destroyed the Burial Land just yet.
<br><br>
For a while, he had been shouting in the whole Burial Land, but Zen was still nowhere to be found and wasn't making any move.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Suddenly, the downgrader looked towards the center of the Burial Land, where many tiny creatures were currently gathered.
<br><br>
"Ha! The Troubled Creatures have arrived. If you still plan on hiding, the remaining creatures in your primitive land will all be eaten up!"
<br><br>
About seventy billion Troubled Creatures shrank into a ball with a diameter of tens of millions of miles, tightly wrapping around the Pear Hill, the Ruin Graveyard, and the other places.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Ruin Graveyard was actually located at the edge, and the Troubled Creatures had already invaded it.
<br><br>
"Hurry up! Those monsters are coming!"
<br><br>
"We have to run!"
<br><br>
"What do you mean? Where do you plan on going? Didn't you listen to what Zen said? We have no choice but to fight against them! There's already no way to escape!"
<br><br>
The masters in the Ruin Graveyard had already been ready to fight or die.
<br><br>
Previously, when they had escaped from the heads, they were able to hold on to a glimmer of hope. They thought that perhaps, they could do the same with the Troubled Creatures. These creatures looked dreadful, but if they worked together, they might be able to defend themselves.
<br><br>
However, when the Troubled Creatures already appeared in the Ruin Graveyard, everyone was utterly dumbfounded.
<br><br>
These creatures possessed demonic space theurgies. Their bodies flickered, making it very hard for them to capture their movements with just their naked eyes.
<br><br>
"Ha! You may be fast, but let's see how powerful you are. I'll send you back to the hell you came from!"
<br><br>
Augustus roared as he rushed towards the Troubled Creatures. He was one of the masters responsible for guarding the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
He released a huge diamond-shaped space, which spun crazily and dashed towards the first Troubled Creature.
<br><br>
Augustus's Other Shore Token had the space attribute, which was considered outstanding among the Other Shore Tokens possessed by the warriors in the Ruin Graveyard.
<br><br>
However, it was extremely inferior against the strength of the Troubled Creatures, which possessed the Hyperspace Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Augustus only saw a blur in front of him. The next moment, he was already grabbed by a huge Troubled Creature in one of its hands.
<br><br>
"These silly humans! You're so pathetically weak, yet you still struggle?"
<br><br>
Right after the Troubled Creature spoke, it stuffed Augustus into its mouth.
<br><br>
Before he was chewed, Augustus's remaining consciousness had fallen into endless despair, and everything else went hazy.
<br><br>
'These Troubled Creatures are this powerful? There are tens of billions of them, for crying out loud! What an unjust world this is!' In his fleeting thoughts, Augustus couldn't do anything but blame his weakness and the unfair world.
<br><br>
"Augustus!"
<br><br>
Not far away, Hallet was fast approaching.
<br><br>
He shook the fishing rod in his hand, and a golden thread swept across towards the Troubled Creature. He was desperately trying to save Augustus by attempting to cut off the Troubled Creature's head using the fishing thread.
<br><br>
However, just when the golden fishing thread flew out, Hallet suddenly felt that a huge black shadow brushed past him. Then, he noticed that his body became lighter. As he looked down, he saw that the lower part of his body was already cut off. Beside him, he saw a floating Troubled Creature, and the lower part of his body was hanging on its sharp nails.
<br><br>
"Do you even know how weak you are? Ha-ha! These people have a death wish!" The Troubled Creature licked the blood off its nails as it stared at Hallet.
<br><br>
"These… These creatures… They're just soldiers, yet they are this powerful."
<br><br>
Hallet coughed out blood as he looked at the Troubled Creature in disbelief.
<br><br>
He knew that he wouldn't be able to survive after the damage he suffered.
<br><br>
He even thought at first that with his strength, he might be able to kill at least a thousand or ten thousand of them. Never did he expect that he couldn't even deal with a single one.
<br><br>
Crash! As Hallet's body was falling to the ground, the Troubled Creature launched another attack.
<br><br>
Its movements were so fast that Hallet didn't even have any time to react.
<br><br>
As the Troubled Creature's fist landed on Hallet, his body instantly turned into a blood mist.
<br><br>
The other warriors at the Other Shore Realm had initially mustered their courage to guard the Ruin Graveyard against the Troubled Creatures and put their lives on the line. However, when they saw what had happened to Augustus and Hallet, they all fled and dispersed in all directions.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, in the face of these vicious creatures, no one could get away from them.
<br><br>
In an instant, all of them were mercilessly killed.
<br><br>
It wasn't even a battle. It was just a massacre. Only the Pear Hill was able to resist the Troubled Creatures, and it was all because of Zen.
<br><br>
Previously, he had used the Hyperspace Extreme Form to create a huge blue ring of light. Whenever a Troubled Creature passed through the blue ring of light, their Hyperspace Extreme Form would be countered.
<br><br>
Chapter 4303 Resist At that moment, the masters who gathered on the jadeite platform had dispersed and stood in different locations.
<br><br>
The Troubled creatures were not that strong, but once they acquired the Hyperspace Extreme Form, the creatures from the third-grade world stood no chance against them.
<br><br>
But there was a catch: once they lost the Hyperspace Extreme Form, they would get significantly weaker.
<br><br>
Buzz! Meanwhile, a wisp of sword light that was as thin as hair continued to wander around.
<br><br>
It was powerful, albeit restless. It could cut a Troubled Creature that came into contact with it in half. What was more amazing was that there were dozens of such sword lights.
<br><br>
Rocher sat cross-legged by the end of the sword lights, and the Lone Sword stood in front of him.
<br><br>
When he had first obtained the Lone Sword, he tried to learn more brilliant sword skills to use his sword to its maximum potential.
<br><br>
However, after its merge with the Sunlight Annihilation Light, Kincaid gave him some advice which enlightened him and changed his views about some things.
<br><br>
For instance, he realized that he did not have to spend too much time studying swordsmanship, spear skill, or blade skills.
<br><br>
Generally, those who had reached a certain level in this field and possessed more energies that they were skillful enough to use would be the great masters.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was useless to attach too much importance to the techniques or intents.
<br><br>
Zen had realized that when he merged with the Other Shore Tokens in the Source World. Although Rocher had fused with all kinds of powerful Other Shore Tokens, he lacked actual combat experiences. The latter only became aware of it much later than Zen did.
<br><br>
"The Sunlight Annihilation Light is indeed sharp and powerful. It's a useful tool to terminate so many Troubled Creatures, but the energy of the Destruction Extreme Form is too much…" Rocher muttered to himself.
<br><br>
He looked around with fear in his eyes.
<br><br>
Every time he took out a Troubled Creature, a purple light ball emerged from it.
<br><br>
The energy of the Destruction Extreme Form inside the purple light ball was overwhelming.
<br><br>
Moreover, Rocher figured that even the amount of energy he would obtain through burning ten Other Shore Tokens was less than that of the purple light ball.
<br><br>
If he destroyed hundreds of Troubled Creatures, hundreds of purple light balls would appear.
<br><br>
The mere thought of it sent him into a flurry of panic.
<br><br>
He tried to break the purple light ball with the Sunlight Annihilation Light, but the sharp sword light only touched the purple light ball, then vanished into it. Even the amount of energy in a Holy Item was far less than that of the purple light ball.
<br><br>
The only thing that made him slightly relieved was that the purple light balls descended quite slowly. It would take them quite a while to reach the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, large Eight Diagrams shadows exploded in the air, and Fuxi's palm crushed dozens of Troubled Creatures in the process.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop! After the Troubled Creatures had died, they turned into purple light balls and slowly came down.
<br><br>
Just as his head ached because of the purple light balls and did not know what to do, he looked up, and what he saw surprised him.
<br><br>
Thousands of purple light balls had appeared above his upper left side, and a figure floated among them. Although he could not see it clearly, he could tell that it was Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Then, Geoffrey punched the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
He used thirty percent of his strength for this attack.
<br><br>
Afterward, a fan-shaped wave spread out in front of him.
<br><br>
All the Troubled Creatures covered by the fan-shaped wave got pulverized and turned into purple light balls.
<br><br>
Once Geoffrey had dealt with the Troubled Creatures around him, he went past the purple light balls and targeted another group of Troubled Creatures. Once again, he destroyed them with a punch.
<br><br>
Since he had chosen the most efficient method to clear up the Troubled Creatures around his area, there were far more purple light balls in his surroundings than in the other places.
<br><br>
"We have to stop!" Fuxi shouted.
<br><br>
Kincaid, Hilario, the Snake Goddess, and the others tried to wipe out all the Troubled Creatures. When they heard Fuxi's call, they slowed down.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed with confusion. "What's wrong?" she asked.
<br><br>
"Those purple light balls will destroy Pear Hill!" Fuxi answered.
<br><br>
"So what?" the Snake Goddess asked again.
<br><br>
"Can't we stop that?" Fuxi said with a pained expression.
<br><br>
"Are you serious?" the Snake Goddess said and smiled. 'I have to admit that sometimes, Fuxi is too naive. He still does not know about our current situation.
<br><br>
Everyone here has pulled out all the stops to fight the Troubled Creatures, and we know what we are doing.
<br><br>
There are over seventy billion Troubled Creatures here.
<br><br>
Furthermore, they were all infused with the energy of the Destruction Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Even if these Troubled Creatures did not fight back and waited for us to put them down, the Extreme Form energy from their corpses will kill us all.
<br><br>
We are doomed to lose, but Fuxi still wanted to win, ' she thought to herself.
<br><br>
"Let me... give it a shot," a soft voice spoke. It was Yan.
<br><br>
Everyone turned to look at her.
<br><br>
Yan's Energy Shaft could transform the energy, provided that the energy had no master or that the energy didn't belong to those that carried it.
<br><br>
Thus, Yan might successfully transform the energy inside those purple light balls.
<br><br>
At that point, she took out her Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
Then, her gaze landed on the purple light balls.
<br><br>
For her, these Extreme Form energies were no different from wild monsters.
<br><br>
She clasped her hands and tightly closed her eyes as if she tried to communicate with the owner-less energies.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, something had changed.
<br><br>
Tiny bubbles appeared on the surface of one of the purple light balls.
<br><br>
Yan abruptly opened her eyes and shouted, "Stay put!"
<br><br>
In turn, the purple light ball that was slowly falling stopped in its tracks and floated in the air.
<br><br>
Everyone who saw what happened was dumbfounded. They did not expect that Yan would succeed.
<br><br>
"She did it! She can control the Extreme Form energy!" Fuxi exclaimed excitedly.
<br><br>
"She has special powers," Kincaid praised as he nodded his head.
<br><br>
"But she only controlled one. There are still so many of them left. We can't change anything," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said with a bitter smile.
<br><br>
As for Yan, she remained calm and composed even after she kept the Extreme Form energy under her control. Then, she opened her palms and said, "Separate."
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Purple flames came out of the purple light ball that she controlled and flew towards the other purple light balls. Eventually, she was able to control the other light balls and suspended them in the air.
<br><br>
Just like that, she controlled even more and more purple light balls.
<br><br>
In a short time, she had managed to make over twenty thousand purple light balls float in the air.
<br><br>
"Well done!"
<br><br>
"She has truly controlled the purple light balls!"
<br><br>
"Can Yan really use the Extreme Form energy?"
<br><br>
While everyone chattered about Yan's progress, Yan stayed focused as sweat broke out on her forehead.
<br><br>
She drew the purple flames out of the twenty thousand purple light balls, then used the fires to make a net to trap the Troubled Creatures. In the blink of an eye, thousands of Troubled Creatures fell dead.
<br><br>
All this time, the downgrader who hid in the cloud of Probability Extreme Form secretly watched the scene.
<br><br>
"Energy Shaft? They've got so many interesting gadgets. But what's the point of holding on like this?" he murmured to himself.
<br><br>
It was already amazing that Yan had controlled tens of thousands of purple light balls in such a short time.
<br><br>
However, there were about seventy billion Troubled Creatures left. It only meant that she had to control another seventy billion purple light balls, even if they were lucky enough to kill all the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
It was impossible for her to control all the purple light balls before they turned Pear Hill into ruins.
<br><br>
Chapter 4304 The Desperate Situation The downgrader was not in a hurry to make a move because as long as he wanted to, he could destroy everything in a snap.
<br><br>
Even the Destruction Extreme Form that was controlled by Yan had been given by him voluntarily. The energies were, in fact, not ownerless.
<br><br>
The downgrader liked to watch life being destroyed little by little. He had already experienced great destruction many times.
<br><br>
In the end, these creatures were just like bees whose hives had been set on fire. In order to defend their homeland, they desperately tried their best, yet they fell into the abyss of their defeat in the end.
<br><br>
After Yan had killed thousands of Troubled Creatures, numerous purple light balls started to appear again.
<br><br>
Her clear eyes opened wide as if she was dreadfully glaring at them.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Energy Shaft above her head rotated like crazy.
<br><br>
Swish, swish, swish...
<br><br>
Many purple snakes then shot into the purple light balls one after the other, and the ownerless energies were controlled by Yan once more.
<br><br>
Twenty thousand purple light balls were already a difficult challenge for Yan. Now there were over four thousand more balls, which stressed her out even more.
<br><br>
"Kill!"
<br><br>
she shouted as she gritted her teeth. She pulled out a larger purple energy net from the purple light balls, using it to envelop the sky.
<br><br>
More Troubled Creatures were killed as their bodies touched the energy net. Purple light balls burst out from their broken bodies, melting into the energy net and further strengthening it.
<br><br>
After a while, the net made by Yan had grown much larger as the number of purple light balls that were fused into it already reached fifty thousand! "Yan..."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked at Yan with concern, but she couldn't persuade Yan to give up just yet.
<br><br>
"Auntie!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey felt sorry for her and was also worried about what would happen next.
<br><br>
Yan's hair began to stand strand by strand as her eyes became unfocused and rolled up. These were obvious signs that she had reached her limit.
<br><br>
But she didn't dare give up easily. The moment the net covered the entire Pear Hill, it would definitely and totally be destroyed.
<br><br>
"Rise!"
<br><br>
She had almost run out of the potential of the Energy Shaft as she maxed it out until its last bit. As a final move, she tossed the huge net into the air.
<br><br>
As soon as she did, she declined into a state of exhaustion and suddenly went falling from the sky.
<br><br>
In a flash, the Snake Goddess stretched out her arms to catch Yan and held her.
<br><br>
"I... I've tried my best..." Yan said as she looked at the Snake Goddess with tired eyes.
<br><br>
"You've done very well," the Snake Goddess affirmed her as she smiled.
<br><br>
"But I still can't protect the Pear Hill," said Yan in a disappointed tone.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess sighed and said, "Silly girl, who can protect the Pear Hill?"
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm warriors, the Chaos Ancient Gods, or the Human Spirit King could not even do that.
<br><br>
It was already amazing that Yan could achieve all this.
<br><br>
"Are we really all going to die?" Yan asked, looking straight into the Snake Goddess' eyes.
<br><br>
She had been summoned to the jadeite platform by Zen. Although she knew how serious the situation was, she still believed that there was a chance to win.
<br><br>
"All of us will die, and there is no exception," the Snake Goddess told her calmly.
<br><br>
Despair appeared in Yan's eyes as she glanced at the huge blue halo in the sky.
<br><br>
More and more Troubled Creatures continued to descend in groups like a horrendous storm.
<br><br>
The number of the first group of Troubled Creatures she had annihilated before reached fifty thousand, while the number of Troubled Creatures at the top of the Pear Hill alone had reached ten billion.
<br><br>
"Where is my brother?" Yan asked, directing her eyes at the Snake Goddess again.
<br><br>
"I don't know." The Snake Goddess shook her head.
<br><br>
Zen's avatar, which had been left on the jadeite platform, was killed, but his real body had mysteriously disappeared.
<br><br>
Judging the energy possessed by the downgrader, Zen's chances of surviving it were slim.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Rocher, Geoffrey, and Kincaid still gave their best as they tried to attack and kill all the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
The falling purple light balls were unstoppable. They slowly descended to the Pear Hill, devouring every part of it they landed onto. This created countless big holes and even the jadeite platform was eaten up without exception.
<br><br>
There were a lot of cities on the hillside of the Pear Hill, and panic started to spread among their residents.
<br><br>
"Those purple light balls... are coming for us!"
<br><br>
"Run!"
<br><br>
"Leave the Pear Hill!"
<br><br>
They knew that the Pear Hill was their last shelter, and they couldn't escape death even if they tried to run away from it. However, they were left with no choice but to give up their homeland and flee in this time of crisis.
<br><br>
However, before these people had moved far away, the Troubled Creatures came rushing from different directions and attacked them.
<br><br>
These Troubled Creatures didn't pass through the blue halo, and their Hyperspace Extreme Form was not offset. This group of monsters feasted on all of the people first before they invaded the cities for more slaughter.
<br><br>
The number of Troubled Creatures descending from the top of the mountain was one hundred thousand at the beginning, and then increased greatly and reached up to tens of millions.
<br><br>
Geoffrey and his group laboriously passed through the cracks of the purple light balls, taking advantage of the narrow spaces just to counterattack.
<br><br>
"Ah..."
<br><br>
a voice suddenly screamed.
<br><br>
When Eastern Emperor Taiyi accidentally touched the purple light balls during his journey, he was directly devoured by the Destruction Extreme Form. His physical body at the Eternal Realm was fragile as a piece of paper in the face of the purple light balls and completely melted.
<br><br>
Yasamin, King Ieuan, and the others didn't even have the time to scream before they evaporated into a layer of thick green smoke and disappeared.
<br><br>
"Eighty percent of the strength!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey detected a site in the gap between three purple light balls and threw a forceful upward punch. Terrifying waves of power surged up. As the Troubled Creatures were densely standing close to one another, this punch might produce hundreds of thousands of purple light balls.
<br><br>
"Ouch..."
<br><br>
He felt a sharp pain radiating through his body after he had thrown the punch.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, one of his hands was sucked into one of the purple light balls. By the time he pulled it out, his flesh and blood had been obliterated, leaving only the ghastly white bones of his clenched hand and fingers.
<br><br>
Luckily, Geoffrey's physical body was very powerful. If other people encountered this situation, they would certainly die.
<br><br>
The number of purple light balls continued to increase, leaving them lesser and lesser room to dodge.
<br><br>
In the end, Geoffrey, the Snake Goddess, Yan, Fuxi, Rocher, and Hilario were all cramped up in a small space. A suffocating sea of purple light balls surrounded them.
<br><br>
"Where is the Human Spirit King?" the Snake Goddess asked, looking at each side.
<br><br>
"Since his Treacherous Being body has been devoured, he should be able to revive on the Other Shore," Hilario concluded.
<br><br>
"Why don't we use the Grand Teleportation technique to jump out?"
<br><br>
suggested Fuxi.
<br><br>
"It's useless," Rocher said, shaking his head as he frowned.
<br><br>
The Troubled Creatures with the Hyperspace Extreme Form gathered around and waited for them. If Fuxi and his group jumped out, it would only be faster and easier for them to be killed.
<br><br>
The space suddenly began shrinking, squeezing rapidly against their limited space.
<br><br>
One hundred feet...
<br><br>
Fifty feet...
<br><br>
Thirty feet...
<br><br>
Ten feet...
<br><br>
The group of people then huddled together, trying to compress as much as possible in the tiny space they had. In addition, it became very much inconvenient for Geoffrey who was about ten feet tall. Even if he initiated to fold both of his arms and legs, he was still taller than ordinary people.
<br><br>
"It's so exciting. I didn't expect to die like this," said Fuxi as he stared at the overwhelming light balls.
<br><br>
"This way of death won't cause too much pain after all," said the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Let's just have a good time then," Fuxi said, preparing to jump into the purple light balls.
<br><br>
But just as he was about to plunge in, a thin layer of light instantly covered his whole body. This light film that was as elastic as rubber dragged him back and firmly bound him with the others.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, as the purple light balls pressed towards the light film, the light film did not flinch at all and remained unaffected by the Destruction Extreme Form.
<br><br>
"This must be..." The Snake Goddess' eyes lit up as she realized something.
<br><br>
It was not hard to guess who was still able to protect them at this time.
<br><br>
Chapter 4305 Protector Everyone felt a glimmer of hope when they realized the light film was protecting them.
<br><br>
Just a moment ago, they had all been grimly resigned to their death.
<br><br>
But now it seemed all was not lost after all! "Is it Zen? Has he come to rescue us?"
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"Father!"
<br><br>
Each person in the group called out.
<br><br>
There was no response from the voice they were expecting to hear.
<br><br>
A mocking voice rang out instead.
<br><br>
"Finally, you decided to appear," the downgrader taunted. "But you won't be able to change their fate. Hahaha!"
<br><br>
Rumble! A thin spike shot out from a purple light ball. The spike spun wildly, gathering momentum before stabbing at the pale yellow light film.
<br><br>
The pale yellow light film was condensed from the Energy Transfer Extreme Form, which could easily isolate, transfer, and gather all kinds of energies. But it was vulnerable to piercing. The sharp spike entered the light film with only a slight twist.
<br><br>
"Auntie, watch out!"
<br><br>
As the spike headed toward Yan, Geoffrey threw his whole body in front of her, exposing his back so the spike would hit it instead.
<br><br>
Phew! The spike skewered Geoffrey's shoulder, baring his bones.
<br><br>
"Ahhh!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey's face contorted in pain, but he remained in place, blocking Yan.
<br><br>
"Geoffrey!"
<br><br>
Yan felt her heart drop. It was unbearable seeing Geoffrey suffer for her.
<br><br>
Buzz! Despite her exhaustion, Yan once again used her Energy Shaft to try to control the purple spike.
<br><br>
To her dismay, however, she found that she could not. She had been able to control the purple light balls before when they had been owner-less.
<br><br>
But now, the purple spike was under the control of the downgrader. Yan's Energy Shaft couldn't wrest control at all.
<br><br>
Geoffrey gritted his teeth and hissed as the spike continued to sear through his flesh, blood, bones, and his insides.
<br><br>
The others could only despair at the sight. They were completely helpless.
<br><br>
They knew if they came into contact with the Destruction Extreme Form, they would turn into ashes. Only Geoffrey's extremely strong physique could endure it.
<br><br>
"This is your son, isn't it? Can you really bear to see him slowly melt away and die in agony? What kind of father are you?"
<br><br>
The downgrader had no empathy, but he could read the memories of those gathered here and figure out Zen's thoughts.
<br><br>
Green ripples started covering Geoffrey's body as the Life Extreme Form energy worked double-time to heal him even as he continued to endure grievous injury.
<br><br>
The pale yellow light film started unraveling, its threads extending towards the rapidly spinning purple spike.
<br><br>
The Energy Transfer Extreme Form merged with the Destruction Extreme Form, dulling the latter's power.
<br><br>
"Hahaha!"
<br><br>
The downgrader's laughter echoed.
<br><br>
He had been able to suppress Zen before. He just needed to do it again.
<br><br>
Purr, purr, purr! Countless purple spikes shot out of the purple light balls, heading straight at the pale yellow light film from all directions.
<br><br>
But before the spikes could penetrate the film, a blue light flashed.
<br><br>
Those trapped were suddenly teleported away, from that cramped space in one moment to the fairy palace in the next moment.
<br><br>
The fairy palace, located in the core area, hadn't been affected by the Troubled Creatures.
<br><br>
Rocher, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yan, Hilario, as well as dozens of people including Lorena, Mike, Bromley and Rosie who had originally stayed in the divine land arrived at the same time by Grand Teleportation.
<br><br>
"Why are we here?"
<br><br>
"Yan! Why do you look so pale?"
<br><br>
"Where is Zen?"
<br><br>
Most of the Ruin Graveyard had been eroded. The divine land was also in a dismal situation. The Troubled Creatures had slaughtered their way to invasion.
<br><br>
Lorena, Rosie and the others had fled into the Evolutionary Universe to go into hiding, but they knew it wouldn't solve the problem. It wouldn't be long before the Troubled Creatures invaded the entire divine land.
<br><br>
As chaos erupted in the fairy palace with the new arrivals, floating golden particles appeared in the center of the courtyard.
<br><br>
The golden particles, resembling ears of wheat, melded together, forming a human figure.
<br><br>
The golden light dissipated to reveal Zen.
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"It's really Zen!"
<br><br>
"Zen is alright! He is safe!"
<br><br>
Those gathered here were obviously Zen's loved ones and those who cared about him the most. They had been beside themselves with worry for him.
<br><br>
When the downgrader had occupied the entire Burial Land with the Probability Extreme Form, he had killed all of Zen's avatars scattered across the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Thus, the avatars Zen had created to accompany Letitia, Margaret, and the others had suddenly dissolved into a pool of blood. Up until this moment, they really feared that Zen had been killed.
<br><br>
Zen did not respond to the rush of friends and family around him. He fixed a steely gaze on the skies.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! One by one, the downgrader's avatars began to appear in the sky above the fairy palace.
<br><br>
These were not illusions created by the Probability Extreme Form but genuine avatars.
<br><br>
One thousand...
<br><br>
Ten thousand...
<br><br>
One hundred thousand...
<br><br>
A million...
<br><br>
A chill ran through those assembled below as the number of downgraders increased.
<br><br>
"You really think your presence can change anything?" the downgrader said, sneering at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the downgrader with a faint smile. "Try me."
<br><br>
Zen radiated so much confidence the downgrader was a little miffed.
<br><br>
Zen must have realized by now that there was a huge discrepancy in the energies they used. There was no chance of him winning. How could he remain so calm? Had he gone insane? "Oh, quit bluffing!"
<br><br>
As the downgrader spoke, he swung his fist.
<br><br>
His over a million avatars likewise did the same. They all threw a punch at the same time.
<br><br>
An invisible fluctuation spread through the space.
<br><br>
The combined punches from the avatars were equivalent to a punch from the downgrader at maximum force. The impact would be enough to reduce the fairy palace into fine rubble. There was no way Zen could survive it.
<br><br>
Bang! With a muffled sound, a fist print appeared over a hundred feet above the fairy palace. An enchanted barrier that protected the fairy palace came into view.
<br><br>
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! Fist marks crowded the surface of the enchanted barrier as the punches landed like rain.
<br><br>
A million punches had landed in only a few seconds, but they were all blocked by the enchanted barrier! "What's this?" the downgrader spat out, taken aback. "How is that possible?"
<br><br>
In his opinion, Zen couldn't possibly bear a million punches, but now he did it right before his eyes! "Have I underestimated you?"
<br><br>
It began to dawn on the downgrader then that the energy given by the ancestry-level bloodline must be much more powerful than he had imagined. He steeled himself and once again activated the Probability Extreme Form to launch another strike on the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Countless downgraders gathered around the fairy palace in clouds created by the Probability Extreme Form. They all struck out their palms downward at the same time.
<br><br>
"Ten billion strikes!"
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Over ten billion palm prints appeared on the enchanted barrier. The enchanted barrier trembled from the impact, but it remained intact.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! "A hundred billion strikes!"
<br><br>
The downgrader kept stepping up his attacks, but the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace continued to withstand it.
<br><br>
After some time, the downgrader paused in silent thought. Something was amiss, and he had finally figured out what it was.
<br><br>
Chapter 4306 The Attacking Method Zen raised his head to scan the downgrader from head to toe. His posture remained unchanged since he appeared, and there was no hint of fear or caution.
<br><br>
It was as though he was a lifeless statue. There was no movement or momentum, which was peculiar for someone that had infinite energy.
<br><br>
It was unnecessary for the downgrader to initiate the confrontation using his bare fists. Of course, doing that was just out of habit.
<br><br>
"Mastema, can you stop?" Zen asked as he directly addressed the downgrader.
<br><br>
This was the first time that someone had referred to the downgrader by his name.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Hearing Zen speak it so casually infuriated the downgrader. The six pairs of compound eyes lit up simultaneously and shot out a sharp crimson light. The light was restrained to a certain degree, and it was as thin as a thread. It extended towards the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace and caused faint water ripples upon contact with its surface.
<br><br>
The downgrader had no intention to attack Zen with this move, but his reaction was forced out of him through anger.
<br><br>
"Shut up! You're just a lowly human being. What gives you the right to tell me what to do! Let Clarence come out. Let him talk to me!" the downgrader shouted, his tone reflecting unparalleled rage.
<br><br>
The people in the fairy palace were all taken aback by the downgrader's extreme reaction.
<br><br>
Why was the downgrader so triggered by Zen calling him 'Mastema'? "Clarence has grown tired of everything. He has entrusted his entire strength to me," Zen said as he returned the downgrader's stern look.
<br><br>
"You can't be serious. Why would Clarence give all his strength to a lowly human like you? This is outrageous!"
<br><br>
Zen's words seemed to have fueled the rage lingering within the downgrader that he was trying hard to suppress.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a crack extended across his head, forming a large mouth intertwined with sharp teeth.
<br><br>
He flapped the wings on his back to flaunt his dominance over Zen. The wings were abnormally huge with scales etched all over them. His appearance was nothing short of a demon who arrived straight from the depths of hell to unleash divine punishment upon them.
<br><br>
Boom! In the blink of an eye, he advanced with untraceable speed and crashed into the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace.
<br><br>
The enchanted barrier once hailed to be invincible was forcefully twisted out of shape by the downgrader. Although it didn't shatter completely after the first blow, some parts of it took reasonable damage and were weakened.
<br><br>
The downgrader didn't top there, he continued to press on the enchanted barrier to test the limits of its resistance. He was only about a foot away from reaching Zen.
<br><br>
"Why? Just why was all of the strength passed down to such a lowly creature who doesn't deserve it?" the downgrader roared out of frustration at Zen. His voice was even more piercing than before.
<br><br>
However, Zen's demeanor remained steady and calm as he returned the downgrader's gaze.
<br><br>
He had seen faint hints of the Evil God's special characteristics from the downgrader.
<br><br>
The downgrader portrayed all elements of the Evil God's personality; strong, cunning, neurotic, and hysterical.
<br><br>
The downgrader continued to roar on top of his lungs as he appealed, "I'm this close to fulfilling your most cherished desire. I'm this close in making it happen. I'll be the one who will craft the most beautiful world you've ever seen with my own two hands. I implore you to take back your strength from this lowly creature!"
<br><br>
Of course, Clarence could see and hear the downgrader. However, he chose to remain silent as he stared blankly at him.
<br><br>
Why did Mastema suddenly get so worked up about Clarence passing his strength down to Zen temporarily? The downgrader continued his rant for a long time before he went silent.
<br><br>
His body was ultimately pushed into the air by the enchanted barrier of the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Zen gave out an exasperated sigh and shook his head before his body slowly ascended in the air. He made his way out of the enchanted barrier and moved in front of the downgrader to look him dead in the eye. "I'm in charge of the force of Clarence. Your biggest enemy right now is me."
<br><br>
"You don't deserve to wield it!"
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Countless downgraders overlapped with each other as they launched an individual palm strike aimed at Zen. It was as though Zen was being rained with an infinite amount of fists one after another.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
When the first strike struck Zen, a palm print was imprinted on his chest, and then it was later overlapped with another palm print. Then a third one, and a fourth, and a fifth...
<br><br>
Within the short span of three seconds, Zen's chest was covered in tens of billions of palm strikes. His body almost became unrecognizable, now cloaked with countless palm imprints etched all over it.
<br><br>
After being struck with those attacks, Zen's features and limbs were bent out of shape to the point that they were severely disfigured. His bones and flesh had been integrated into a single organism, and his appearance was reduced to that of a ball of meat that had been continuously kneaded for tens of billions of times.
<br><br>
Purr...
<br><br>
But after a short while, the ball of meat started to tremble voluntarily.
<br><br>
Luscious thick black hair, a pair of eyes, mouth, nose, and eyebrows began to reappear from it. When the mold completely unwrapped itself, Zen regained his usual self seemingly unscathed.
<br><br>
The onlookers from the fairy palace remained rooted to their spots as they watched the scene unravel before their eyes with their mouths agape.
<br><br>
Their eyes couldn't keep up with the rapid palm strikes the downgrader unleashed on Zen, but they did witness Zen's body shaped up into a mold due to the pressure. To them, it was like watching Zen continuously being pinched by an invisible hand, and the mass of his flesh and blood was like rolling water.
<br><br>
"Were you able to make out what just happened to Zen? How did he suddenly become that thing? I can't tell what has happened, as it all happened so fast..." Even the Snake Goddess, who was the smartest being present in that crowd, was rendered speechless at this sight.
<br><br>
"He must have been continuously attacked by the downgrader without pause," Hilario said as he stared up at Zen's floating figure. He was making this assumption because Zen had previously mentioned the attacking method of the Probability Extreme Form in front of him before.
<br><br>
His explanation already sounded too exaggerated. But what Hilario was unaware of was the fact that Zen was confronted with tens of billions of blows one after another, and if the downgrader wished, he could tamper with the frequency and increase the rate even further.
<br><br>
"You barely managed to tickle me. Was that the best you could do? It's my turn now," Zen said as he gave his knuckles a light crack.
<br><br>
Zen was now the bearer of infinite energy that knew no bounds. He was able to release any amount of energy as he saw fit, and the reserves of it were absolutely limitless.
<br><br>
"Mirror!"
<br><br>
Zen exclaimed on top of his lungs. In response to his call, a circular silver mirror made of light stationed itself above his head.
<br><br>
"Ten billion." Zen narrowed his eyes as he glared at the downgrader staring back at him.
<br><br>
Just as those words left his mouth, Zen felt the enormous reserves of ancestry-level bloodline gush out from him uncontrollably.
<br><br>
If the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline was equivalent to that of a flowing river before, it had now upgraded itself and became as endless as seawater overflowing from every fiber of his being.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
Soon, the sky was dominated by the presence of ten billion silver light mirrors.
<br><br>
The silver light mirrors distributed across the space soon became so overwhelming that it was hard to escape the sight of them. They lit up the entire sky in a flash.
<br><br>
The Troubled Creatures that were still engulfed in their battle were forced to delay it as they raised their heads to make sense of the situation.
<br><br>
Their vision was filled with many stars flickering and twinkling in the sky.
<br><br>
The formation of the silver light mirrors seemed unorganized, but in fact, each of their positions was preplanned according to a certain rule.
<br><br>
"Uniting!" Zen yelled out another command.
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
At his words, each of the silver light mirrors began to emit streams of energy. These streaks of energy collided with each other and constantly bounced off each other until all of them gathered together to form an ingenious structure.
<br><br>
"Annihilating!" A murderous look appeared in Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
The silver energy flow collected itself at one point before unleashing itself wholly at the downgrader.
<br><br>
This killing move was something Zen extracted from one of Clarence's memories. The technique did not have a unique name to itself. It only consisted of three steps; 'Mirror', 'Uniting', and 'Annihilating'. It was a carefully constructed attacking method that was created using three distinct Extreme Form energies.
<br><br>
The turbulent energy flow flew across the air and pierced its way through the Burial Land from the center. In a short span of thirty seconds, the energy flow had traveled across the chaos and reached the edge.
<br><br>
Boom...
<br><br>
The energy flow contained an ominous aura and forcefully opened a big hole in the chaos leading to the Abstruse Energy World! At this time, the Evil God's avatar was carrying the triangular rock to complete the enclosure. When his gaze fell on the stream of energy sweeping across the sky at an incredible speed, he couldn't help but feel startled at the overwhelming sight. His eyes slowly widened in surprise as he felt a deep fear sprout from within his heart.
<br><br>
"Where did that attack come from?"
<br><br>
Before he could speak more to voice his growing concerns, he felt a wave coming from behind him. As he turned around to know the source, his eyes met those of the real Evil God.
<br><br>
Wherever the avatar carried the triangular rock, the territory it covered was instantly marked as a part of the Source World. The real Evil God could then appear and disappear at will within the range.
<br><br>
The real Evil God also sensed an astounding amount of energy flow surging from the boundaries of the Burial Land. He moved out to check it out for himself.
<br><br>
When he witnessed the large hole in the chaos, his expression darkened as a shadow hovered over his eyes.
<br><br>
The strength of this energy flow was far beyond the conjecture of the real Evil God.
<br><br>
Chapter 4307 More Avatars The Evil God clearly knew the gap in strength between himself, Zen, and the downgrader.
<br><br>
Even with the energy of the Source World, he could only hold on for a few rounds in the battle against the two.
<br><br>
Right now, he could only sacrifice the materials from the Source World to sustain his energy. It had become a battle of limited resources against infinite energy. Sooner or later, the Evil God would exhaust everything that he had and would be overcome either by Zen or the downgrader.
<br><br>
Fortunately for the Evil God, the intensity of the energy he could release in a round was by no means inferior to that of his two opponents. Now, his only problem was where to find more resources to cope with them.
<br><br>
As he was trying to explore more sources of energy, he was also using the Field to expand the Source World indefinitely. If he made the entire chaos a part of the Source World, then everything in it would belong to him, and he would be able to use them however he wanted.
<br><br>
However, when he saw the energy flow that suddenly erupted from the Burial Land, the Evil God was stunned.
<br><br>
'What the hell? Where does that terrifying amount of energy come from?' The energy flow occurred within the scope of the Source World, and the Evil God estimated it using his omniscient power.
<br><br>
But unexpectedly, as he discerned the flowing energy, he felt like his chest was smashed by a heavy hammer.
<br><br>
Then, he found out that to release this energy flow, about sixty thousand Source Worlds would have to be sacrificed.
<br><br>
In other words, even if he decided to sacrifice the entire Source World, the power that he would acquire would almost be negligible against what his opponents possessed.
<br><br>
His throat felt dry and a bitter taste rose from it. In an instant, his arrogance vanished, knowing how pitiful his current state was.
<br><br>
"Shall we continue to enclose more lands?"
<br><br>
one of the avatars cautiously asked as he noticed the bad mood of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Yes," the Evil God answered briefly, then quickly disappeared.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, there was a huge square platform floating on the belt of the Source World. On it, tens of thousands of avatars of the Evil God were gathered.
<br><br>
Light energy bands floated around the platform that formed huge fences, sealing the entire platform into what looked like a huge prison.
<br><br>
With this, an avatar that wanted to escape from it would be instantly killed. Moreover, since the space was locked, they were unable to use the Grand Teleportation skill.
<br><br>
At this moment, there was a fierce argument going on inside the prison.
<br><br>
"Energy and materials are just two sides of the same coin. This is an ironclad law!"
<br><br>
"That's right! If there aren't enough materials, then there won't be enough energy to produce!"
<br><br>
"Bullshit! The transformation of materials and energy only looks like this in lower-grade worlds. How do you think Zen and the downgrader acquire so much energy?! There must be a shortcut to obtain infinite energy in higher-grade worlds!"
<br><br>
"Then, we have to restore the energy as soon as possible. It's the only way to find this shortcut."
<br><br>
The prison was very noisy as the avatars debated on how they could turn their situation against Zen and the downgrader.
<br><br>
Every avatar hysterically expressed their opinions. They only came from a single person but their ideas collided with each other. It was actually a good thing, so they could arrive at the best conclusion.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran were standing guard at the prison gate and were listening to the avatars' conversation.
<br><br>
The two of them were greatly shocked at the intelligence displayed by each of them.
<br><br>
With so many of them, their brainstorming became more efficient.
<br><br>
Judging by their progress, it might not be too long before the avatars could realize how to find the shortcut that they badly needed.
<br><br>
While they were listening intently, they didn't notice the grains of sand that were slowly floating out of the prison.
<br><br>
Apparently, these grains of sand were from an avatar, who did not wish to participate in the others' discussion. Instead, he quietly sat in a corner and gradually turned his body into fine sand.
<br><br>
The sand drifted little by little towards the prison gate, forming a thin layer, while the avatar's body was continuously shrinking.
<br><br>
"Hey, why is there so much sand on the ground?"
<br><br>
Finally, the Grandmaster of Heaven inadvertently noticed the thin layer of sand on the ground. He and Duran were always on high alert. If it was just ordinary sand that fell on the ground, they should have noticed it at once.
<br><br>
As they wondered and inspected the sand, it suddenly condensed into the avatar of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Since the avatars were almost the exact copies of the original, they had no way to determine whether he was the real Evil God or not. Just when they were about to ask him, the Evil God reached out his hand and gently waved at Duran. An invisible film instantly enveloped Duran, and at the same time, the avatar also stretched his other hand and grabbed the Grandmaster of Heaven by his neck.
<br><br>
"I've actually been coveting your body for a long time now. If I want to be free from the real Evil God, I need to possess your body shell," the avatar said with a sinister smile.
<br><br>
Since the avatar could also use the Extreme Form energies, Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven were no match for him.
<br><br>
"You bastard… The real Evil God is omniscient and omnipotent. Even if you take away my body shell, he will know instantly. Don't think that you can get away with this!" the Grandmaster of Heaven said in gritted teeth as he struggled to remove the hand of the avatar from his neck.
<br><br>
"Omniscient? Omnipotent? Ha! The power of the third-grade world is nothing! Do you think I can't deceive him?" As he finished speaking, he didn't waste any time and began stealing the body of the Grandmaster of Heaven. "Soul Extreme Form!"
<br><br>
However, as the Extreme Form energy started activating, the real Evil God suddenly appeared above the avatar and stomped him to the ground.
<br><br>
Crash! The avatar's body immediately collapsed into grains of sand and quickly flowed to escape.
<br><br>
"Humph! Where do you think you're going?"
<br><br>
The real Evil God snorted as he released several balls of flames that darted towards the sand.
<br><br>
The flames quickly caught up with the sand and engulfed it.
<br><br>
The painful roars of the avatar could be clearly heard from within the flames. As the sound dissipated after a while, the sand was burnt and was turned into a piece of smooth and transparent glass.
<br><br>
"Your avatars are really troublesome," the Grandmaster of Heaven said as he still gasped for air from being strangled by the avatar.
<br><br>
The real Evil God just shook his head and turned to look inside the prison.
<br><br>
"I have no choice. I can't risk placing unwarranted fear in their minds."
<br><br>
"Huh? Why not? Won't it be necessary so you could control them properly?" Duran asked.
<br><br>
The Evil God pointed at his head and said, "If they got too scared and paranoid, they would lose their imagination and creativity. Those are what we need from them. It'll be over if we lose that."
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, both the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran understood him.
<br><br>
"Hey!"
<br><br>
An avatar suddenly greeted the Evil God through the fence and gently pulled his hands together. At the same time, a pale red band of light slowly rotated around him. "I have found a new Field, and the creatures within it will fall into the chaos."
<br><br>
The number of Fields that he was talking about was eighty-six.
<br><br>
Indeed, the avatars were very efficient. They found several Fields in such a short time. After they figured out the rules, their speed became so much faster, and it could still improve.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God still wasn't satisfied.
<br><br>
Then, he slowly ascended to the top of the prison, looked down at the avatars below, and said, "You've done a good job, but it still isn't enough.
<br><br>
We're running out of time. I just saw a powerful energy flow from the Burial Land. We're in a very tight spot."
<br><br>
"How powerful is it?" one of the avatars asked.
<br><br>
"It's equivalent to the energy of the combined sixty thousand Source Worlds," the Evil God said straightforwardly.
<br><br>
"What?!"
<br><br>
An uproar suddenly rose from inside the prison.
<br><br>
The jaws of the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran dropped hard. They even asked each other if they heard the same thing.
<br><br>
"In short, they have an infinite source of energy. We have no chance of winning if we just rely on the Fields. I need you to find out the energy source and the shortcut to control it. I need more intelligence and more avatars."
<br><br>
After the Evil God finished addressing them, the belt of the Source World began to tremble. He was planning to sacrifice everything in order to get what he wanted.
<br><br>
Chapter 4308 Brains From the continental plates, which were tens of millions of miles wide, to the fist-sized stones, they all turned into fine powder and floated upward into the sky.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"What's going on?"
<br><br>
"Our bodies! They are collapsing!"
<br><br>
Still, a large number of the creatures remained on the belt of the Source World.
<br><br>
They all hoped to survive, but luck was not on their side this time.
<br><br>
Each of them looked around in a panic as they saw inches of their bodies flaking off bit by bit, turning into dust and eventually, drifting into the air.
<br><br>
A few wanted to escape while others wanted to resist, but their efforts proved to be useless at this point.
<br><br>
The Evil God was always firm with any decision he had ever made.
<br><br>
Before, he thought he stood a chance with the help of the Fields, but he soon realized that there was a gap too big to be filled. In this realization, he chose his last resort.
<br><br>
Within an hour, all the things in the Source World, along with tens of thousands of creatures, were sacrificed. At the same time, the belt completely disappeared and left only the prison on the platform while the black ship floated not too far away.
<br><br>
Shera, the former captain, and Edna stood on the deck as they witnessed the broken Source World disappear right before their eyes.
<br><br>
"Thanks to the Evil God, my black ship will survive," the former captain said with a bitter smile.
<br><br>
"This is crazy... I like it. Too crazy," Shera exclaimed giddily.
<br><br>
Edna looked over at Shera, her expression as calm as ever. No matter what the Evil God did, she would wholeheartedly support him.
<br><br>
"Grow!"
<br><br>
the Evil God roared.
<br><br>
Just then, the prison on the platform expanded rapidly and new avatars shot up one after the other.
<br><br>
The number of appearing avatars exceeded one hundred thousand, then five hundred thousand, and eventually, there were one million of them packing densely the platform.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at them and asked, "How many avatars can be made once all the materials in the Source World are consumed?"
<br><br>
The Evil God looked down then proceeded to answer, "Around four million."
<br><br>
Each avatar was far stronger than an ordinary warrior at the Eternal Realm, so the Source World was limited to produce only four million of them.
<br><br>
"With so many avatars on our side, it's a force that can be reckoned with,"
<br><br>
the Grandmaster of Heaven pointed out.
<br><br>
The real Evil God sneered, "Four million ants are still no match for an elephant. They are not strong in battle, but I only need their intelligence."
<br><br>
One of the avatars who stood behind the prison fence overheard their discussion. "If you only need our intelligence, then our bodies are useless.
<br><br>
I suggest you create only our heads."
<br><br>
The avatar's words struck a chord with the Evil God. A big smile plastered across his face. "That is reasonable. I will only keep your heads!"
<br><br>
This was an advantage because if he only created their heads, he would no longer need the prison anymore.
<br><br>
At first, the Grandmaster of Heaven thought the Evil God had joked about creating only heads. To his surprise, the Evil God immediately started to sacrifice for the second time.
<br><br>
Most of the avatars agreed to the plan and readied themselves as they were eager to find the source of energy. Others, however, resisted and cursed at the Evil God. Sadly for them, they had no choice. All the bodies of the avatars quickly disintegrated into pure energy.
<br><br>
A few minutes passed and only rows of heads were left across the huge platform. At the same time, more heads were generated and appeared alongside them.
<br><br>
Both the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran scratched their heads in confusion.
<br><br>
Though neither of them followed any of the rules, they were still shocked with what the Evil God had executed.
<br><br>
What exactly was he trying to do? As they watched, they saw the Evil God provide the energy for these heads. This was to ensure that they could think flexibly and extensively.
<br><br>
"The number of my avatars has soared. It is now one billion and six hundred million." The real Evil God nodded in acknowledgment of what he'd done. He was above and beyond proud of all the progress.
<br><br>
In fact, he still wanted to create more heads, but he needed to reserve some energy for them to think. So one billion and six hundred million was the limit.
<br><br>
The avatar that initially suggested creating heads spoke out once more, "Actually, our number can still increase. You'd only need our brains to contain our intelligence, and it's far more efficient to communicate with each other with spiritual senses."
<br><br>
As they heard this, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran gasped in shock.
<br><br>
Was he serious? If rows of heads weren't wild enough, what more rows of brains? "That's right!" the Evil God exclaimed in delight. "Your eyes, ears, mouths, noses, skulls and teeth can also be sacrificed!" After finishing his words, the real Evil God clapped his hands and executed yet another round of sacrifices.
<br><br>
Just like that, one billion and six hundred million heads were sacrificed once again.
<br><br>
When only brains were left with souls within them, the number went up to a whopping two billion.
<br><br>
These brains held souls that were stronger than any of the warriors at the Holy Soul Realm as they released spiritual senses to search around. It came to a point that so many spiritual senses were intertwined together in the air and formed a chaotic soul windstorm.
<br><br>
"Quiet down!"
<br><br>
Once the real Evil God released a terrifying soul pressure, the two billion brains instantly withdrew their spiritual senses and the windstorm settled down into nothing.
<br><br>
Afterwards, the real Evil God began to delegate the tasks amongst the two billion brains before him. Some were responsible for thinking, some collected information, and some selected useful, decisive information.
<br><br>
Because the brains contained much chaotic information, they had to work intrinsically together to pull everything off.
<br><br>
As he finished his arrangements, the Evil God turned around and gazed into the distance. All of a sudden, a silver light flashed.
<br><br>
His eyebrows suddenly raised. Stretching out his hand, he retracted the black ship and the platform dozens of miles away. Without warning, the fluctuating silver energy flow shot over them all.
<br><br>
The energy flow swept past them at unbelievable speed, then suddenly disappeared back into the void.
<br><br>
The Evil God was not the only one who caught a glimpse of it. The Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran couldn't help but pace around as they saw the energy flow.
<br><br>
"This... This is the energy flow you mentioned?"
<br><br>
"How can it hold such immense power?"
<br><br>
The real Evil God looked over at them with a cold, motionless expression.
<br><br>
"This is the reason why I had to sacrifice the Source World."
<br><br>
As they knew, the battle between Zen and the downgrader in the Burial Land was still ongoing.
<br><br>
Within such a short amount of time, Zen had already launched six sets of 'Mirror', 'Uniting' and 'Annihilating' in a row, which created gaping holes within the Burial Land.
<br><br>
But even though his attacks were powerful, it was still unable to kill the downgrader.
<br><br>
Just then, the downgrader released a light that resembled a dazzling golden sun. The sun surrounded him and expanded along the edge of the Burial Land. At the same time, the Pear Hill, the divine land, and the Ruin Graveyard were swallowed up by the golden sun while tens of billions of Troubled Creatures were killed in the process.
<br><br>
The entire Burial Land grew still and silent, all except for the fairy palace that Zen managed to protect.
<br><br>
Once the light of the golden sun eventually dimmed down, the silhouette of the downgrader appeared from a distance. "In the past, when a world ended, Clarence and I had a fierce battle. That was definitely my favorite.
<br><br>
This time, with you as my opponent, I have to say I am pretty damn bored."
<br><br>
For him, Zen merely used tactics that attacked him instead of killing him.
<br><br>
In the end, nothing Zen ever struck him with produced substantial damage to him.
<br><br>
"Ten billion..."
<br><br>
Zen stood up tall as he raised his hand into the air. Just then, ten billion silver rings of light scattered across the sky.
<br><br>
It seemed that he was still using the set of 'Mirror', 'Uniting' and 'Annihilating'.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The energy flow gathered and rushed straight at the downgrader.
<br><br>
Usually, all the downgrader had to do was dodge. However, he'd planned to forcefully block the energy flow altogether.
<br><br>
To his surprise, as he resisted the energy flow, Zen's figure quietly disappeared. The next thing he knew, Zen stood right by the black light.
<br><br>
Chapter 4309 The True Strength The downgrader made his debut from the black light.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen knew that this black light was essential to the downgrader.
<br><br>
His real body was most likely hidden within it.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had attempted to destroy the black light with the Destruction Extreme Form, but in the end, he only failed.
<br><br>
Now that he realized his attacks couldn't hurt the downgrader even the slightest bit, he once again fixed his attention on the black light.
<br><br>
It was impossible to destroy the black light just by relying on the Destruction Extreme Form; however, Zen discovered a theurgy in Clarence's memories.
<br><br>
"Light Clearing Skill!"
<br><br>
A circular ring of light floated towards the black light and enveloped it, now beginning to rotate.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! As the ring of light revolved, the black light also swayed non-stop.
<br><br>
"Is it taking effect?"
<br><br>
Zen observed as his eyelids twitched slightly.
<br><br>
He had tried several other methods before, but none of them could affect the black light even a little. The black light seemed to be in another world.
<br><br>
Now, the Light Clearing Skill could actually impact the black light, which brought Zen a glimmer of hope.
<br><br>
"Contract!"
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! The ring of light then contracted inward from its rotating motion.
<br><br>
The moment the edge of the ring of light touched the black light, the black light shrunk slightly and surprisingly freed itself from the ring of light's control.
<br><br>
"The black light escaped?"
<br><br>
Zen frowned and pointed at it with his finger. He deployed the Light Clearing Skill once more.
<br><br>
One hundred rings.
<br><br>
One thousand rings.
<br><br>
Ten thousand rings.
<br><br>
Over ten thousand rings of light continuously appeared, all rotating and contracting at the same time. The black light started to shake violently, but without any further effect from the rings.
<br><br>
"You're really stupid, aren't you? Instead of putting up a fight, you actually want to destroy my Source Light." The downgrader suddenly appeared above Zen's head. He had already dealt with the energy flow released by Zen.
<br><br>
Zen raised his hands and stared at the downgrader without saying anything. He then drew his hands closer to the black light. Fingernailsized crystals started to float out from his palms, gathering towards the black light.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! With a faint shattering sound, the small crystals merged into the black light.
<br><br>
One by one, the crystals emitted a small dull green light as they broke.
<br><br>
Soon, the black light was entirely colored green, and at the same time, turned into a solid object.
<br><br>
This was another way of changing the shape and form of light.
<br><br>
After the crystals had solidified the black light, Zen immediately yanked his fist and punched it forcefully.
<br><br>
Boom! The solidified black light was smashed into pieces.
<br><br>
However, the broken black light remained floating in its place.
<br><br>
The downgrader, standing with crossed arms, didn't have any intention of attacking Zen at all. Instead, his eyes flashed with a faint yellow light as he showed a mocking expression.
<br><br>
There were a great number of theurgies in Clarence's memories, all of which had been extracted from the Extreme Form energies. Many of them were indeed worth a try.
<br><br>
Every time that Zen did, he looked at the downgrader and observed his reaction. Not a single theurgy was able to make the downgrader flinch.
<br><br>
His face stayed plain and unbothered.
<br><br>
After Zen failed six or seven times in a row, the quiet Clarence finally broke his silence. "It's useless, Zen. The Source Light is the privilege I gave him. It can't be destroyed."
<br><br>
"Privilege?" Zen was stunned as he heard what Clarence just said.
<br><br>
"Yes. Before he grew up, he had made this request, which was the privilege of never being destroyed. I thought carefully for a long time before I came up with this method. After I gave the Source Light to him, even I could not strip him off his power," Clarence recollected.
<br><br>
Zen sighed as he was lost for words.
<br><br>
Clarence himself had actually created a powerful enemy who couldn't be killed. What was he thinking? "Since the Source Light can't be destroyed, how did you deal with him?"
<br><br>
Zen asked again, deeply thinking of a solution.
<br><br>
From the higher-grade worlds all the way to the lower-grade worlds, Clarence chased Mastema and later got defeated in the Deep Space.
<br><br>
"Suppress him to the point that he can't get out of the Source Light anymore," Clarence replied. "Every time I suppressed him in the Source Light, he could not bear it and would begin to downgrade the worlds, which I couldn't stop him from doing. In the fifth-grade world, we had both suffered great losses. He failed to complete the downgrading while I had to stay in the Heavenly Ring Staff."
<br><br>
"But we have the same energy and neither of us can do anything to each other. How can I even suppress him?" Zen asked with hesitation.
<br><br>
With a faint smile, Clarence responded, "In my opinion, not only would you fail to suppress him, but you will eventually lose to him."
<br><br>
"Why?"
<br><br>
"Up to now, he hasn't even used his real strength. He and I know much more about energy than you do. Although you have absolute infinite energy, you're like a reckless man flailing a powerful saber around. Your skill is undoubtedly great, yet it is useless," Clarence commented harshly.
<br><br>
If the downgrader heard those words that Clarence uttered, he would probably raise his thumbs in agreement.
<br><br>
However, it was not Zen's fault.
<br><br>
Even though he had obtained a portion of Clarence's memories, he had no other choice but to fall inferior to the downgrader.
<br><br>
"Then you..."
<br><br>
"No. I won't make a move," Clarence said, immediately predicting what Zen was thinking. "I've already told you the reason."
<br><br>
Clarence had never been able to stop Mastema from downgrading the worlds, so he quit and had simply given up trying.
<br><br>
"It's a pity to give up like this. After all..."
<br><br>
"Remember, human," Clarence directly interrupted Zen again. "I've already helped you understand my past to the greatest extent. As a human, you have your limits and you know it. It's meaningless to encourage me, persuade me, or even urge me. I have already given everything to you.
<br><br>
This time, you have to strive for success on your own."
<br><br>
After he finished speaking his truth frankly, Clarence fell silent again.
<br><br>
No matter how many times Zen called him, he didn't reply anymore. He had already made up his mind to just be an onlooker.
<br><br>
"Zen, we can only rely on no one but ourselves now,"
<br><br>
the ancestry-level bloodline suddenly told Zen.
<br><br>
Although Clarence had awakened, he hadn't erased the intelligence of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"Rely on ourselves..."
<br><br>
Zen narrowed his eyes slightly while gritting his teeth.
<br><br>
"You're right. Come on!"
<br><br>
This time, the ancestry-level bloodline released vigorous life energy which was the bloodline power of the life quadrant.
<br><br>
The bloodline powers of the fourth-grade world could not offer any substantial help to Zen, but they offered him great comfort that made him feel a little warm inside.
<br><br>
At this moment, the voice of the downgrader suddenly echoed again.
<br><br>
"I have given you so many chances, but you chose not to seize even one of them. Now let's end this boring battle!"
<br><br>
The downgrader then stretched out his long and slender arms.
<br><br>
Several Extreme Form energies started to circulate on the surface of his body, which later intertwined and merged together—this formed fat leeches that slowly crawled all around his body.
<br><br>
Swoosh! In a flash, the downgrader came flying straight to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen instantly avoided him by using his omnipotent power to move to the corner of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
However, the strange thing was that the downgrader also arrived at the spot at the same time. His slender arms had already grabbed Zen's neck, and the leeches that originally lay on his body transferred quickly to Zen's.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! One end of the leeches drilled into Zen's body, and the other remained stuck to the body of the downgrader, connecting the two to each other.
<br><br>
"It's such a waste to give you the ancestry-level bloodline, don't you think? Why don't you leave it to me instead?" the downgrader said with an evil smirk.
<br><br>
Chapter 4310 Absorption Long ago, Mastema had tried to swallow Clarence.
<br><br>
The attempt wasn't just undertaken once. He tried to swallow Clarence in the eleventh, ninth, and eighth grade worlds but failed every single time.
<br><br>
However, Clarence had just given his abilities to a human, which proved to be the greatest opportunity that had ever come for Mastema.
<br><br>
He was not afraid of Clarence but being chased by him irritated him.
<br><br>
Swallowing this troublesome guy's abilities would solve everything once and for all.
<br><br>
Before Zen could prepare for the next round of counterattack, he found his body pierced through by leeches.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop! Plop! The leeches were literally sucking away the ancestry-level bloodline in his body.
<br><br>
"Zen, leave him!"
<br><br>
the ancestry-level bloodline told him.
<br><br>
It had previously resisted splitting itself before it awakened so there was no way it was going to let the downgrader do the same thing.
<br><br>
"Okay!"
<br><br>
Zen replied, immediately moving away from where he once stood using his omnipotent power.
<br><br>
This teleportation method had a very high priority in the primitive land. It was so fast that it did not even cause any space fluctuations.
<br><br>
Swoosh! In just the blink of an eye, Zen found himself already on the other side of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
"Move away..."
<br><br>
Astonishment was evident on Zen's face.
<br><br>
He had just moved tens of millions of miles but the downgrader was able to keep up with him. No leech dislodged itself from his body while the downgrader remained at his heels, keeping a certain distance.
<br><br>
"Well..."
<br><br>
Zen gritted his teeth and once again used his omnipotent power but the results remained the same. Wherever he went, the downgrader followed.
<br><br>
"Resistance is futile,"
<br><br>
the downgrader told him with a maniacal laugh as the leeches continued to absorb Zen's ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
No matter where Zen went, he immediately followed so much so that it almost seemed as if the two of them had become one. The Extreme Form energy exerted by his constant movements practically covered the entirety of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Buzz! Zen was not convinced and moved eight more times.
<br><br>
The result was always the same and Zen soon realized that there was no way he was going to get rid of the downgrader.
<br><br>
"I'll cut you off!"
<br><br>
Zen shouted in irritation.
<br><br>
Soon enough, a new moon appeared in the sky.
<br><br>
"One Token Slash!"
<br><br>
This was a theurgy he had obtained from Clarence's memories. He released an infinite amount of energy to maximize its power.
<br><br>
As Zen summoned his strength, the new moon expanded from a few hundred miles to billions of miles long! This humongous moon was magnificent but only a few people could enjoy its majesty.
<br><br>
Those in the fairy palace had no idea of the ongoing fight between Zen and the downgrader.
<br><br>
Pear Hill, the Ruin Graveyard, and the divine land were all but destroyed along with the families, friends, and clans that once lived there. Only a few dozen people were left alive in the chaos and an unprecedented sense of loneliness rose from the survivors' hearts.
<br><br>
"Look at that moon!" Geoffrey burst in awe as he pointed up at the sky.
<br><br>
"Is Zen making a move?" Mike asked, his voice tinged with concern.
<br><br>
"It should be him. The battle's not over yet!" Yan exclaimed with hope.
<br><br>
The entirety of the sky was covered by the new moon, which painted an incomparably shocking and beautiful scene.
<br><br>
Whilst everyone looked at the moon, the Snake Goddess chose to ruminate in solitude.
<br><br>
She stared at the direction of what was once Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Despite being forcefully taken away from the Source World, in the end, the Pear Hill was still destroyed.
<br><br>
That was just how fate worked, it seemed.
<br><br>
At that moment, an idea suddenly came to the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
She felt like a struggling insect that, no matter how high she flew, could not escape the trap she had stumbled into.
<br><br>
Splash! The new moon slashed down, aimed at the leeches between the downgrader and Zen.
<br><br>
Despite its size, the new moon remained as thin as a blade.
<br><br>
As it fell, it began to shrink as all the Extreme Form energies gathered and condensed into one thin line of unimaginable power.
<br><br>
However, all the downgrader had to do was gently push forward at the direction of the new moon and an invisible enchanted barrier enveloped around them.
<br><br>
Sizzle! This barrier inevitably collided with the thin blade of the new moon.
<br><br>
At that moment, a sharp voice echoed within the void.
<br><br>
There was no way infinite energy could offset infinite energy.
<br><br>
The strongest spear could not break the strongest shield.
<br><br>
It was the case in the fairy palace before, and the same held true now.
<br><br>
"Again!"
<br><br>
Zen shouted as he waved his hand.
<br><br>
With that, several new moons once again floated in the air.
<br><br>
These new moons surrounded Zen, slashing at the downgrader one after the other, to no avail.
<br><br>
"Dispersing state!"
<br><br>
In this seemingly hopeless situation, Zen chose to turn to his last resort: the disintegration of his body. As the owner of the primitive land, his ability was to disperse his body if ever he was killed. It was equivalent to suicide but it was a choice he had to make for the sake of everyone.
<br><br>
However, at the moment of his body's collapse, an extremely strong binding force held him together. His body collapsed without dissipating! "Hahaha..."
<br><br>
the downgrader sneered.
<br><br>
He was always one step ahead of Zen in this fight.
<br><br>
They had the same abilities but the same could not be said when it came to strength.
<br><br>
As the ancestry-level bloodline was completely absorbed by the leeches, Zen's body floated, empty and devoid of everything.
<br><br>
Puff! With a single glance, the downgrader set Zen's body aflame and burned it until it was nothing but ashes.
<br><br>
"Infinity plus infinity is still infinity.
<br><br>
My strength has not increased but I saved so much trouble. It feels good."
<br><br>
The downgrader's six pairs of compound eyes flashed green, indicating his satisfaction.
<br><br>
Buzz! With a slight buzzing noise, the downgrader's body disappeared and then materialized in the fairy palace.
<br><br>
His presence quickly threw everyone in deep despair.
<br><br>
There was no way Zen would've allowed the downgrader to enter the fairy palace unless he was dead. Thus, there was only one reason why the downgrader was here.
<br><br>
"Where is my father?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey asked through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
"He's dead. Your father has been absorbed by me. He is now a part of my own body," the downgrader replied.
<br><br>
"You... You're lying!"
<br><br>
Geoffrey screamed as he ran to the downgrader at breakneck speed and threw a punch to his face.
<br><br>
The force from Geoffrey's punch had the ability to reach tens of millions of miles. However, despite his strength, the downgrader remained unmoved and unbothered.
<br><br>
But Geoffrey did not care.
<br><br>
He was angry and he had to vent his anger so he continued to throw dozens of punches towards the intruder.
<br><br>
Nobody dared stop him. Nobody, not even Rocher, Yan, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, or Lorena, made a move.
<br><br>
Their combined strength could not be compared to that of the downgrader.
<br><br>
There was no need to fight a lost battle.
<br><br>
In the middle of the fight, the downgrader finally made his move and caught Geoffrey's fist. With a slight twitch of his wrist, he was able to sever the young man's arm from his body. "I felt nothing. Your punches couldn't even tickle me. You're poorly weak."
<br><br>
As he ridiculed Geoffrey, fist-sized marks of the darkest black began to appear over the surface of the downgrader's body.
<br><br>
These ink marks expanded and created cracks upon the downgrader's skin, signaling his body's collapse! Chapter 4311 Infinite Seals "Wait... What?"
<br><br>
The downgrader's six pairs of eyes flashed sharply, as though something sparked inside them.
<br><br>
A strange feeling that could only be likened to confusion consumed him.
<br><br>
Geoffrey covered his broken arm with his other hand, and he too felt strange.
<br><br>
Although he had unleashed one hundred percent of his strength in each punch, he never expected he'd be able to defeat the downgrader.
<br><br>
He had been under the impression that even if he did go all out, he wouldn't be able to break down even the most basic defenses of the downgrader, let alone beat him like this! "You, you...! What have you done?"
<br><br>
the downgrader growled and took one staggering step towards Geoffrey.
<br><br>
The surface of his body was riddled with black ink marks as more and more cracks appeared. Gradually, his skin began to flake off his body.
<br><br>
"I didn't do anything," Geoffrey said confusedly, taking a cautious step back. "I just punched you."
<br><br>
Yan, Mike, Rocher and the others, who had been watching from behind Geoffrey, were all rendered speechless.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess eyed the downgrader warily. Raising her thin eyebrows gently, she suddenly had some sort of a premonition. Whipping her head around, as expected, she saw a faint figure quietly materializing.
<br><br>
It was none other than Zen.
<br><br>
The downgrader also sensed Zen. Now, he didn't feel that overwhelmed, but he still felt the need to ask, "How did you do it?"
<br><br>
"It seems you don't know everything about the Extreme Form energies.
<br><br>
You don't even know the power of crystal solution." A faint smile crept on Zen's face. "Since I couldn't defeat you, I had to turn myself into a poisonous pill for you to swallow."
<br><br>
Then, it dawned on the downgrader. "The power of the crystal solution?"
<br><br>
he echoed softly, as though in a daze. "I see..."
<br><br>
It was a kind of poisonous energy formed by combining several Extreme Form energies. While it was lethal as a weapon, it was difficult to use.
<br><br>
The downgrader had wanted to devour the ancestry-level bloodline, which gave Zen a chance to deliver the fatal blow.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
The downgrader chuckled helplessly as his body disintegrated little by little. Fragments were falling from his body in bite-sized chunks, yet he still continued to laugh like a madman. "Killing me has earned you great honor. But is it enough to defeat me?"
<br><br>
With the help of the Source Light, the downgrader would be able to revive infinitely. It didn't matter if he was killed.
<br><br>
"I wouldn't have known if I didn't try." With that, Zen abruptly moved to the side of the black light.
<br><br>
The downgrader had made it very clear that the Source Light could not be damaged, and even went so far as to put it out in the open.
<br><br>
Zen studied the black light and began to search the memories given to him by Clarence.
<br><br>
Clarence didn't tell Zen how to restrict the downgrader, but the memories revealed all sorts of information on how to use all the Extreme Form energies. Thus, Zen figured that the methods of restriction must be hidden within them.
<br><br>
Zen narrowed his eyes at the Source Light and immense amounts of Extreme Form energies started to gush out of his body.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The Extreme Form energies of three different colors overlapped, forming a massive circular altar.
<br><br>
The circular altar then shrank quickly and enveloped the black light tightly.
<br><br>
"The Holy Seal!"
<br><br>
Zen didn't know which the best seal was, so he decided to use the stupidest method first. Eventually, he planned to use all the methods that were designed to seal something within.
<br><br>
Splash! Splash! Countless green crystals flowed into the void. Once they surrounded the circular altar, they joined together to form one huge emerald crystal.
<br><br>
"The Life Seal!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A square space bigger than the first one wrapped around the emerald gem and then turned into a stable space.
<br><br>
"The Space Seal!"
<br><br>
"The Heaven Lock, seal!"
<br><br>
"The Phase Enchanted Barrier, seal!"
<br><br>
"The Evil Will, seal!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Although the types of Extreme Form energies were much fewer than those of the bloodline powers, their combinations were also very rich. The theurgies that evolved from them were strange, birthing more sorts of powerful sealing methods.
<br><br>
Zen didn't even stop to think. He relentlessly used all the theurgies that had restricting effects.
<br><br>
Ten layers.
<br><br>
Twenty layers.
<br><br>
Thirty layers.
<br><br>
From within the black light, the dead downgrader gradually came back to life.
<br><br>
His hand slowly stretched out from the black light, only to be met by the first seal.
<br><br>
"Humph! It's only the Holy Seal. What a childish method!"
<br><br>
With a careless flick of his wrist, Extreme Form energy appeared in his hand. Without hesitation, he smashed the Holy Seal.
<br><br>
The circular altar instantly shattered into pieces with a loud bang.
<br><br>
Just as the downgrader was about to emerge from the black light completely, he found that there was another layer that sealed him within.
<br><br>
"The Life Seal? Psh!"
<br><br>
Boom! The emerald green gem was smashed into pieces with a single punch.
<br><br>
"The Space Seal? Break!"
<br><br>
Boom! The square space then collapsed, inch by inch.
<br><br>
However, even after destroying three layers of seals, the downgrader was met by yet another seal.
<br><br>
"Damn it! Another seal!"
<br><br>
The downgrader couldn't help but curse. He really didn't expect that Zen would use so many seals. How bothersome! Of course, he had no clue that Zen had actually set up over a hundred layers of seals from the outside, and there were no signs of him stopping.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the chaos, a hush had fallen over the huge square platform.
<br><br>
But if one were to activate his spiritual sense, he would be met with countless other spiritual senses.
<br><br>
On the square platform, two billion brains were working seamlessly, like a well-oiled machine.
<br><br>
The real Evil God floated from above. After all the information had been filtered, he absorbed the most useful ones.
<br><br>
"There are eighty-six kinds of 'Field' energy in the sixth-grade world."
<br><br>
"There are forty-five kinds of 'Weight' energy in the seventh-grade world."
<br><br>
"There are twenty-two kinds of 'Coupling' energy in the eighth-grade world."
<br><br>
"In the ninth-grade world..."
<br><br>
The two billion brains were quickly speculating and summarizing. It was surprisingly efficient to communicate with each other with spiritual senses, and it was not as noisy and chaotic as before.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, eighty-six kinds of "Field" energy had been completely displayed in front of the Evil God. He absorbed this information easily. The forty-five kinds of "Weight" energy and twentytwo kinds of "Coupling" energy, which were the energy forms in the highgrade worlds were all understood by him.
<br><br>
The higher the level of the energy, the more difficult it would become for the Evil God to control it.
<br><br>
While he could use the "Field" energy, this method consumed a lot of energy.
<br><br>
However, the consumption of the "Weight" energy was even more astronomical. The Evil God was curious and tried to summon it, but when half of the energy was condensed, his remaining energy had been consumed by a tenth.
<br><br>
He still needed to maintain the operation of two billion brains. How could he be willing to waste all his energy on this? These two billion brains were like two billion cultivators at the Holy Soul Realm, which consumed a considerable amount of energy.
<br><br>
If he couldn't find the source of infinite energy before their current supply of energy was exhausted, the Evil God would lose without a fight.
<br><br>
As for the Coupling energy, although he had found the way, he didn't have the courage to try it. This was something that even he couldn't touch.
<br><br>
The speed at which the energy was restored was very fast, basically up to the expectations of the Evil God. After all, by now he had already mastered the rules of restoring.
<br><br>
However, he was still pessimistic about the matter.
<br><br>
He could hear nothing stirring within the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Because they were in different primitive lands, he was unable to find out the situation in the Burial Land through his omniscient power. However, this was definitely not a good omen. Once the winner was decided, he would be the next goal.
<br><br>
Chapter 4312 The Source Of Energy A sense of urgency arose in the Evil God.
<br><br>
He realized it was necessary to urge the two billion brains.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The Evil God instantly projected his will into the brains.
<br><br>
"You should realize the meaning of your existence, and that is to find out the best way to obtain infinite energy. Once you obtain it, you will all have freedom and everything your hearts desire!"
<br><br>
Hearing this, these brains began chattering with their spiritual senses.
<br><br>
"Of course!"
<br><br>
"We are about to achieve an unprecedented feat!"
<br><br>
"I want a world of my own!"
<br><br>
Two billion brains responded, one after another.
<br><br>
Once he obtained absolute infinite energy, the Evil God would be able to create countless worlds to accommodate them all.
<br><br>
The Evil God had always pursued freedom. These brains had the same goals as him, but since they existed in the form of brains, they could only help him achieve his ultimate goal.
<br><br>
"But I'm afraid the victory has already been decided in the Burial Land, and we have almost run out of time. No matter which side wins, we would lose the chance to resist," the Evil God said with a serious honesty. "So, please hurry up with your efforts!"
<br><br>
"The higher the level of energy, the less kinds there are, and the faster it will be!"
<br><br>
"We will try our best!"
<br><br>
"You will win the unprecedented glory for us all!"
<br><br>
Two billion brains responded in unison. Although the Evil God was omnipotent, he couldn't hear every brain's response, but he could choose to listen to the most popular ones.
<br><br>
The energy of the ninth-grade world was known as Cube, and there were only sixteen kinds.
<br><br>
Just as the brains had said, they became more and more skilled at restoring energy, and once the kinds of energy decreased, their speed of restoration became faster and faster.
<br><br>
Basically, every five minutes, one more kind of "Cube" energy formed.
<br><br>
After one and a half hours, the sixteen kinds of energy of the ninth-grade world had been restored.
<br><br>
Then they proceeded to restore the energy of the tenth-grade world, which was known as Phase. Its number was reduced by a half to eight.
<br><br>
Very soon, these eight kinds of energy were also restored.
<br><br>
The energy of the eleventh-grade world was known as Frequency, and its number had been reduced by another half to four.
<br><br>
The energy of the twelfth-grade world was known as Coke, and it possessed only two kinds.
<br><br>
The Evil God anticipated receiving the essence of the energy, so he became more and more excited.
<br><br>
In the blinking of an eye, he landed on the deck of the black ship and paced back and forth.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven, Duran, Shera, Edna, and the former captain stood on the other side of the deck, their eyes following the steps of the Evil God.
<br><br>
In fact, they wanted to know what the Evil God had achieved, but when they saw the serious look on his face, no one dared to question him.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Suddenly, countless spiritual senses gathered about the black ship.
<br><br>
There were too many invisible spiritual senses to fully discern. Their presence even caused a gentle wind to stir Shera's and Edna's long hair.
<br><br>
After receiving the information from the spiritual senses, the Evil God shut his eyes lightly.
<br><br>
After a short moment, he opened his eyes, and they lit up brightly.
<br><br>
"I see! I see! I see!"
<br><br>
the Evil God shouted into the void.
<br><br>
"Dear..."
<br><br>
Edna called out to him with concern.
<br><br>
As if he hadn't heard her, the Evil God asked, "What do you believe the energy to be?"
<br><br>
Hearing this question, Shera blinked her large eyes. She raised her right hand, and a mass of energy gathered like a blood mist around it. "For me, energy is a tool for killing."
<br><br>
"Energy? It's the root power to maintain my bloodline's might," said Duran.
<br><br>
"It's the way to rule everything," the former captain responded.
<br><br>
Edna pursed her lips, wanting to express her opinion. She considered it for a while but gave up.
<br><br>
After a while of contemplation, the Grandmaster of Heaven said, "Energy forms all materials. The two can mold each other."
<br><br>
The Evil God grinned, giving him a thumbs up before he continued to question, "Where do the energy and materials come from?"
<br><br>
"They come from higher-grade worlds," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied.
<br><br>
The Evil God nodded. "If, and I do mean if... What will happen if we transform all the materials into energies and consume them?"
<br><br>
Hearing this question, the Grandmaster of Heaven frowned. It was difficult for him to adequately answer it.
<br><br>
Energy was used to create a world, and the energy consumed in this process would be transformed into materials.
<br><br>
Energy also had the ability to destroy everything. What happened to the energy used in this process? "The consumed energy has completely disappeared, and so has everything else," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied.
<br><br>
"You think it has disappeared, and I also once believed it had disappeared.
<br><br>
Everyone believes it has disappeared, but in fact it does not disappear at all!" the Evil God countered.
<br><br>
"But then what has happened to it?" the Grandmaster of Heaven questioned in puzzlement.
<br><br>
"It has entered the void." The Evil God exaggeratedly opened his arms in a gesture of hugging the void. "The void is overflowing! All the space, so devoid of any material that we can see, is actually filled with energy! The space in a cup, the space in a room, and also the space in a world are all bursting with energy!"
<br><br>
Shock was painted all over everyone's face.
<br><br>
"How is that possible?"
<br><br>
"There is nothing within the void."
<br><br>
"If there really is energy in the void, how come we can't sense it at all, let alone use it?"
<br><br>
The Evil God looked at them as if he was looking at simpletons and unhurriedly explained, "According to my calculations, the energy that is transformed from the materials in the Deep Space, the main world, and all the secondary worlds only makes up twenty percent, while the invisible energy in the void accounts for the remaining eighty percent. More importantly, even when the energy in the void is consumed, it still returns to the void. In this sense, it is absolutely infinite!"
<br><br>
It was like drawing water from a lake for a bath. After the bath, the water was poured back into the lake. In this way, the water would neither decrease nor increase, and it could be used repeatedly.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven gasped for breath. The words of the Evil God seemed so unbelievable, but now it made perfect sense. He continued to ask, "If what you say is true, how can we prove it?"
<br><br>
"Prove it?"
<br><br>
The corners of the Evil God's mouth curved upwards, and he gently raised his hand towards the sky.
<br><br>
A light blue colored ribbon unrolled, and this was the Field of Static Electricity.
<br><br>
Following that, a dark red colored ribbon flowed out, representing the Life Field.
<br><br>
Then more fields in black, white, yellow, green, and other colors unfolded like the lines of a rainbow.
<br><br>
The energy consumption of these Fields was astonishing. Previously, it had been too difficult for the Evil God to activate the Restriction Field, but now, he could easily display all eighty-six different Fields, one by one.
<br><br>
"From the moment this world was created, the energy in the void remained unknown to us. We simply couldn't comprehend its existence, let alone use such energy," the Evil God proudly stated. "But now, I have discovered the truth."

<br><br>
However, when the energy of the twelfth-grade world was already restored, he suddenly learned something.
<br><br>
As for the two kinds of "Coke" energy in the twelfth-grade world, it turned out that one was to create and the other was to destruct. They had no special features but they were said to be interlinked with each other.
<br><br>
They were just the positive and negative sides of energy.
<br><br>
After the energy of the thirteenth-grade world was restored, the situation became simpler and clearer.
<br><br>
Surprisingly, there was no energy in the thirteenth-grade world.
<br><br>
The only secret that it contained was how to control everything.
<br><br>
When the Evil God finally got this authority, he could now discover the infinite energy that was hidden in the void.
<br><br>
"It's so beautiful…"
<br><br>
Shera was deeply mesmerized as she stared at the colorful bands of light that floated in the sky.
<br><br>
When the Evil God saw her fascination, he gently stretched out his finger.
<br><br>
Then, a small dark-red band of light appeared on Shera's index finger, looking like an exquisite ring.
<br><br>
"This is…"
<br><br>
Shera was surprised as she looked at the band of light on her finger.
<br><br>
"The energy of the Source World is sealed within it. You can use it anytime you want," the Evil God said with a faint smile. "However, I doubt that you will have the chance to use it."
<br><br>
Indeed, the Source World was vast, and it contained a lot of energy.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God needed to face Zen and the downgrader. In a battle involving them, even the energy of the entire Source World was far from enough.
<br><br>
Despite that, Shera's eyes still gleamed in excitement.
<br><br>
It was such a romantic gesture for her that the Evil God turned the Source World into a ring.
<br><br>
"If the 'Field' energy is in the shape of a light band, then what is the form of the 'Weight' energy?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked out of curiosity.
<br><br>
He was a man with a strong desire for knowledge, and thus he would take any opportunity to broaden the horizon of his wisdom.
<br><br>
"Weight… It's a kind of energy that is in the form of acute triangles.
<br><br>
That's it!"
<br><br>
Then, all of a sudden, irregular triangular energy blocks appeared in the sky.
<br><br>
"Hmm, Coupling is a kind of lumpy energy.
<br><br>
This kind of energy won't be seen from the outside. But since it appeared, it has already been integrated, and thus it's uncontrollable. I don't know how people fight in the eighth-grade world."
<br><br>
Upon saying this, the Evil God released the lumps of Coupling energy.
<br><br>
They had a complicated form and looked like delicate boxes. Since They were already in a complete form, there was almost no energy that was coming from them.
<br><br>
"Well, the 'Cube' energy of the ninth-grade world is more interesting. It doesn't have a fixed form, so it could be transmuted into various things.
<br><br>
Now, the energy of the tenth-grade world—"
<br><br>
Previously, although all of the two billion brains had already restored the energy bit by bit, it could only exist in his brain without the support of the infinite energy.
<br><br>
Even the Evil God was very curious about such energy, so he displayed them one by one.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the battle in the Burial Land was still raging on.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! A layer of bright red enchanted barrier was suddenly smashed into pieces.
<br><br>
After that, the downgrader fell into the illusion that was created by the Soul Extreme Form. In order to resist it, he needed to use another Extreme Form energy to counter it.
<br><br>
However, as soon as he broke out of the illusion, he found himself sealed in an extremely sturdy copper ball.
<br><br>
"Ha! Is this all you can do?"
<br><br>
Crash! The downgrader continuously shattered more than a hundred enchanted barriers and seals that were set up by Zen.
<br><br>
It was effortless for Zen to create these enchanted barriers and seals. With the support of the infinite energy, he could construct them without a stop.
<br><br>
At the same time, he was also monitoring the downgrader's movements in the black light. When the downgrader attacked the innermost enchanted barrier, Zen would infuse it with the infinite energy.
<br><br>
This way, it would take a lot of time and energy before the downgrader could break every enchanted barrier. Consequently, he wouldn't be able to destroy all the enchanted barriers in one go.
<br><br>
For quite a while, the downgrader had indulged himself in breaking the enchanted barriers randomly. However, he soon noticed that the sheer number of the barriers that Zen had set up was far beyond his imagination.
<br><br>
There would be no end to it if he just continued breaking them one by one. Thus, he temporarily stopped and thought of a way out.
<br><br>
At this moment, he was trapped inside an ice tomb. With the aid of the infinite Extreme Form energy, the ice tomb could actually freeze everything close to it.
<br><br>
However, the downgrader saw this as a chance to escape.
<br><br>
Although the ice tomb was pretty sturdy and powerful, its weakness was obvious. It would be completely restrained by the Flame Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Even if the ice tomb was endowed with absolute infinite energy, it would still be easy to break it using the Flame Extreme Form.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In an instant, the downgrader started brewing the Flame Extreme Form in his hands.
<br><br>
His slender arms suddenly stretched out of the black light and swept towards the surrounding ice tomb.
<br><br>
"Break!"
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! With an enormous impact, the huge ice tomb collapsed without difficulty.
<br><br>
The moment Zen felt that the ice tomb collapsed, he attempted to gather absolute infinite energy to infuse into the next seal. However, the downgrader was well prepared this time and was much faster to take action.
<br><br>
"Break all the enchanted barriers!"
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Vicious flames formed violent torrents that erupted on a large scale.
<br><br>
Without the support of the infinite energy, the enchanted barriers were unable to resist the flames that were released by the downgrader. All the seals and enchanted barriers seemed like thin sheets of paper that were instantly engulfed by a sea of flames.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As the downgrader shattered all the enchanted barriers, his voice once again echoed throughout the Burial Land.
<br><br>
"Do you think you could suppress me with such petty tricks? Think again! You're too confident because the Burial Land is protecting you? Then I'll destroy every inch of it! Let's see how you could face me afterward!"
<br><br>
While the black light could make the downgrader be reborn infinitely, the Burial Land acted the same for Zen.
<br><br>
Moreover, the primitive land gave Zen more abilities. Currently, this wasn't an equal battle anymore.
<br><br>
Even the downgrader had to admit that he wouldn't be able to defeat Zen if he didn't destroy the Burial Land completely.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! In the blink of an eye, the downgrader appeared at the edge of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
A golden sun rose from his body, devouring all the surrounding materials, and burning a huge hole into the Burial Land.
<br><br>
Then, the downgrader flew along the edge. As the golden sun continued to devour the ground, a huge gap soon appeared on the surface of the Burial Land.
<br><br>
As Zen saw this, he immediately rushed over and tried to stop the downgrader.
<br><br>
However, the downgrader's body movements were so fast. His body flickered here and there, and the next moment, he was already at the other end of the Burial Land, continuing to devour the land with violent flames.
<br><br>
If one stood far from the Burial Land, it would seem like a ferocious bug had infested and devoured the Burial Land and left it with several huge holes.
<br><br>
As the countless holes accumulated to a certain extent, the Burial Land finally collapsed with a loud bang.
<br><br>
Zen wasn't able to do anything to stop its destruction. In the end, he could just helplessly watch it being razed to the ground.
<br><br>
However, just as the Burial Land collapsed, a subtle sensation suddenly arose within Zen's soul. He felt as if he had merged into a larger primitive land.
<br><br>
'Wait. Outside the Burial Land should only be the chaos.
<br><br>
How could there be a primitive land?' Zen was utterly confused as he didn't understand what had just happened.
<br><br>
"What's that look on your face? Are you surprised?"
<br><br>
Suddenly, the voice of the Evil God resounded in his ears.
<br><br>
As Zen turned around, he saw that the figure of the Evil God was slowly condensing at a distance. His eyes were filled with a familiar mockery as he said, "You were not able to defeat the downgrader after all the time you wasted? What a good-for-nothing. Should you step aside and let me do it for you instead?"
<br><br>
Chapter 4314 The One Who Broke The Rules Zen stared at the Evil God's face as if he had met him for the first time.
<br><br>
After a few seconds, he asked him, "What place is this?"
<br><br>
Before, Zen wondered if he had fallen into the downgrader's illusion.
<br><br>
"This? This is the Source World," the Evil God said, spreading out his arms.
<br><br>
Zen looked around, but he found nothing but fragments of the Burial Land. Everything else was the pitch-black void.
<br><br>
"This is the chaos." Zen frowned.
<br><br>
"Your primitive land has been integrated into the Source World. You and I have the same authority. Why don't you sense the scope of the Source World?" the Evil God suggested in a taunting manner.
<br><br>
Although Zen could not believe what the Evil God was telling him, he closed his eyes. As he focused on his senses, he began to feel the huge primitive land.
<br><br>
His body flashed slightly and he reached the edge of the primitive land.
<br><br>
On a triangular rock, he saw one of the Evil God's avatars sitting there as if he owned the world.
<br><br>
When the Evil God's avatar saw Zen, he was neither taken aback nor threatened. He continued to rest on the triangular rock and played with a rock snake, which he had brought up from under the rock.
<br><br>
This avatar was undoubtedly lucky, especially compared to the Evil God's two million brains.
<br><br>
"Oh, look what we have here. It's a special guest," the Evil God's avatar said sarcastically.
<br><br>
Zen, however, was too busy to reply. He looked past the avatar and into the world behind him. It was the inner wall of the chaos.
<br><br>
"Is this the edge of the chaos?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Evil God's avatar reached out and slapped the inner wall of the chaos.
<br><br>
"What do you think? Can't you figure that out for yourself?" he replied with a smirk.
<br><br>
"But how did you make it?" Zen curiously asked.
<br><br>
The Evil God's avatar shrugged. "I don't know. Go ask the real Evil God,"
<br><br>
he replied plainly. "Do you want to sit down? Have a cup of tea?" the avatar added, trying to divert the subject.
<br><br>
Once again, Zen ignored him and returned to where the real Evil God was.
<br><br>
Zen's expression drastically changed. He already knew the general situation using his omniscient ability, but he was still a bit confused as to how it happened. The Source World was gone, which left behind the black ship, the two billion brains on the square platform, and the six stones scattered at the edge of the chaos.
<br><br>
"You relied on the six stones to turn the chaos into the primitive land, didn't you?" He tried to confirm with the Evil God.
<br><br>
"You can say that," the Evil God answered indifferently.
<br><br>
"But how is that even possible?"
<br><br>
Of course Zen knew it was possible. He had personally seen it, but he still couldn't believe what the Evil God had done.
<br><br>
The Evil God turned his attention towards Zen, who still looked very surprised.
<br><br>
"In the past, when I was a creature in your inner world, I was greatly limited. I couldn't understand everything outside. Now, I have more power than I need. You won't be able to understand how much power I have.
<br><br>
What you know is just a small drop in a large bucket. I can let you..."
<br><br>
Before the Evil God could finish his smug speech, a cloud of black mist suddenly hovered above him and Zen.
<br><br>
"Probability Extreme Form!" a voice from the cloud screamed.
<br><br>
"All of you are going to die!"
<br><br>
From the cloud came the downgrader. After the destruction of the Burial Land, the downgrader waited for an opportunity to give Zen a fatal blow.
<br><br>
When Zen lost the protection of the primitive land, it became easy to kill him, even if he had the absolute infinite energy.
<br><br>
Just as the downgrader was about to unleash an attack on Zen, he noticed the Evil God. He flashed them a malicious grin.
<br><br>
"I'll kill both of you!" the downgrader shouted.
<br><br>
When the downgrader destroyed the Source World, he didn't even bother to clean it up at all. He held absolutely no regard for the Evil God.
<br><br>
There were countless downgraders in the Probability Extreme Form. All of their energies saturated the area. It made it difficult for anyone to fight the energies.
<br><br>
Before Zen and the Evil God could even resist, their bodies and souls quickly evaporated, leaving no trace of debris.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The cloud of Probability Extreme Form disappeared in an instant.
<br><br>
"It's over."
<br><br>
Countless downgraders merged into one form. The six pairs of compound eyes on the form's face returned to light green. The downgrader muttered, "It still surprises me how difficult it is to deal with these low-grade creatures."
<br><br>
"Get ready for another surprise." The downgrader heard someone say these words.
<br><br>
From his left side, the Evil God's figure began to condense, and on his right was Zen's figure.
<br><br>
The downgrader's compound eyes began to flash rapidly again. "How could you be reborn?" he asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
"See..."
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God became shortly distracted in answering the downgrader's question, the downgrader launched an attack.
<br><br>
Everything from within a radius of one million feet was submerged by the energies. The newly-condensed figures of Zen and the Evil God turned into powder, disappearing completely.
<br><br>
However, just as the downgrader thought he had finally killed the two men, their figures started to condense again. As soon as their bodies were back, the Evil God looked at the downgrader with fake hurt. "Could you let me finish what I'm going to say this time?"
<br><br>
"Shut up!"
<br><br>
the downgrader growled.
<br><br>
Once again, he used his energies to cover the area to kill Zen and the Evil God once and for all.
<br><br>
Whoosh...
<br><br>
As soon as the energies emerged from the downgrader, the Evil God gently waved his hand.
<br><br>
When he did this, a black light band flashed up and bound the downgrader's body. At the same time, he quickly approached the downgrader.
<br><br>
"I really do hate being interrupted. How about you?"
<br><br>
the Evil God said before raising his fist and smashing it into the downgrader's head.
<br><br>
Bang! The downgrader's body shot up like an arrow in the sky.
<br><br>
The Evil God quickly moved up, kicking the downgrader downwards.
<br><br>
Just as the downgrader was falling, the Evil God moved to where the downgrader was, launching a palm strike at him.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang...
<br><br>
The downgrader was like a sandbag, flying up and then falling.
<br><br>
It was smart of the Evil God to bind the downgrader with black light band because it completely restricted all of the downgrader's powers. He had him at the palm of his hands.
<br><br>
The Evil God specifically chose to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the downgrader, knowing how much the latter considered this form of battle as an insult to his power.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the black light band with a thoughtful expression.
<br><br>
'That is an incredibly higher level of energy, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
Not only had the Evil God comprehended the blood powers and the Extreme Form energies, but he also comprehended a higher level of energy. He was a terrifying opponent.
<br><br>
While Zen was in disbelief with what he was seeing, the downgrader was even in more disbelief.
<br><br>
He was very sure this was the Field energy of the sixth-grade world. He was in the Silent State Field, which was supposedly the most powerful one.
<br><br>
However, the sixth-grade world had already been completely downgraded and no longer existed! The Field energies could no longer be used. Not even the downgrader or Clarence could violate this rule.
<br><br>
The only reason why the downgrader could still use the bloodline powers and the Extreme Form energies was that the Deep Space and the main world still existed.
<br><br>
But how could this mere human being use the Field energy? How could he have broken the rules? "I've had enough!"
<br><br>
the downgrader roared.
<br><br>
Surging energies gushed out of his body, but they all rushed inside the black light band. This frustrated the downgrader, but he knew what to do.
<br><br>
After all, he was born in the thirteenth-grade world. He was very familiar with each level of energy.
<br><br>
The Silent State Field was powerful, but the downgrader forcefully broke through it using several Extreme Form energies.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish...
<br><br>
As his body emitted the Extreme Form energies, the black light band, which was first absorbing the energy, began to dissolve little by little.
<br><br>
As the downgrader, who had just regained his freedom, was about to launch a counterattack, the Evil God told him, "You could use the Extreme Form energies to break free from the Silent State Field because of the infinite energy only. What about this? Let's see if you can break through this one!"
<br><br>
Buzz, buzz...
<br><br>
With two sharp chirps, two asymmetric triangles locked the downgrader.
<br><br>
"The Weight energy!"
<br><br>
the downgrader cried out loud. He began to scream so loudly that Zen and the Evil God thought it would cause the world to shake, but they let him do it. Anyway, it was the only thing the suppressed downgrader could do in this situation.
<br><br>
Chapter 4315 Downgrading Zen was absolutely dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Although he didn't know what the "Weight" energy was, the energy level of these two triangles was obviously astronomical.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the downgrader was hysterical. The "Weight" energy should've been one level higher than the "Field" energy.
<br><br>
"How far has the Evil God gone in comprehending the energy?" Zen asked, in a daze.
<br><br>
"This is the energy of the Boundless Divine World, known as Weight,"
<br><br>
Clarence suddenly spoke up.
<br><br>
Ever since he gave the absolute infinite energy to Zen, he had been determined to be nothing but an onlooker. There was nothing in the thirdgrade world that could arouse his interest. He had even predicted how it would develop in the future.
<br><br>
However, the method that the Evil God just used instantly piqued his interest, causing him to speak again.
<br><br>
"The energy of the seventh-grade world..." Zen clicked his tongue. "He was able to comprehend it on his own!"
<br><br>
"This is not a problem of comprehension," Clarence said slowly. "The seventh-grade world has already been downgraded by Mastema, and so, the 'Weight' energy can't be used. Therefore, both you and Mastema can only use the Extreme Form energies at most."
<br><br>
"But he..." Zen, at a loss for words, just pointed at the Evil God.
<br><br>
"I don't know why or how either." Clarence was also very confused. "It's really strange that he was able to violate the most basic rules."
<br><br>
Clarence had seen many geniuses in his time.
<br><br>
From the twelfth to the fifth-grade worlds, there were all sorts of strange creatures. They had various dreams, goals, great desires and wishes, and were capable of many unimaginable things.
<br><br>
At the beginning, Clarence felt it was novel to him, but after a while, he lost interest. Every world had an unbreakable limit, and no matter how powerful a creature was, there was nothing they could do to break it.
<br><br>
In a sense, Zen had reached past the limit. He not only obtained the bloodline powers, but also the Extreme Form energies, and even the absolute infinite energy of Clarence. However, this had been based on the premise that the Deep Space was not completely downgraded.
<br><br>
And yet, now, the Evil God suddenly appeared out of nowhere and began to use the "Field" and "Weight" energies. This was just so outrageous that even Clarence couldn't remain silent.
<br><br>
The Evil God, on the other hand, didn't feel as though he had done anything spectacular. He was too immersed in the joy that came from teasing the downgrader.
<br><br>
"Well? What's your solution?" The Evil God laughed tauntingly.
<br><br>
By now, however, the downgrader had calmed down.
<br><br>
The "Weight" energy was two levels higher than the Extreme Form energy, he realized.
<br><br>
But indeed, there was a solution.
<br><br>
The higher-level energy was like a sharper knife, but if it was attacked by endless energy, its blade could still be blunted, maybe even broken! What mattered most, however, was that the downgrader was also very familiar with the "Weight" energy.
<br><br>
Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! The densely packed lightning wrapped around the "Weight" energy tightly, flashing violently. The endless energy consumed the "Weight"
<br><br>
energy bit by bit, until the surface of the two triangles was completely corroded.
<br><br>
However, with the current ability of the Evil God, it was very easy to repair the "Weight" energy, because he also possessed infinite energy.
<br><br>
The reason why he chose not to repair it right away was that he wanted to see the desperate look in the downgrader's eyes.
<br><br>
Halfway through the battle, the Evil God suddenly felt that something was missing. He stretched out his hand and summoned the black ship over.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven, Duran, and the others were all stunned when they saw Zen. What surprised them even more was the sight of the downgrader. After a while, however, they calmed down upon seeing that the downgrader was trapped.
<br><br>
"This is the downgrader you mentioned? He doesn't look very powerful..."
<br><br>
the Evil God winked at Duran triumphantly.
<br><br>
"Well..." Duran was at a loss for words.
<br><br>
He just couldn't believe his eyes. The downgrader, known to be invincible and unimaginably powerful in the Jade Pure Realm, was losing to the Evil God! When the downgrader overheard what the Evil God said, his fury grew tenfold.
<br><br>
Once upon a time, he was the superior one. No one other than Clarence could defeat him.
<br><br>
He roared angrily, "You are the one who is weak!"
<br><br>
With that, a ripple of energy exploded outwards.
<br><br>
The fine lightning that had been zipping around the "Weight" energy started to coil into an azure ball. The sharp sizzling sound of electric current lasted for a while, until all of the "Weight" energy was finally corroded.
<br><br>
Just as the "Weight" energy was about to disappear completely, the Evil God raised his hand and snapped his fingers.
<br><br>
A vine of energy shot out and wrapped itself around the downgrader like a python. Then, sharp thorns popped out of the vine of energy, piercing into the body of the downgrader, carefully securing him.
<br><br>
"You were saying?" the Evil God said with a crazed smile, waving his hand lazily.
<br><br>
When Zen saw the energy vine, he asked, "Is this the energy of the eighthgrade world?"
<br><br>
"No, it's the 'Cube' energy of the ninth-grade world. The energy form of the eighth-grade world is very special, and it's difficult to use it in this world," Clarence answered.
<br><br>
"Has he grasped the energy at the top level?" Zen gasped.
<br><br>
"The energy at the top level is the absolute infinite energy," Clarence said slowly. "He can easily use the 'Weight' energy and the 'Cube' energy, so he must have mastered infinite energy, or there will be a problem with the supply of energy. Unbelievable!"
<br><br>
Clarence was in a good mood. He was absolutely fixated on the scene unfolding before him.
<br><br>
After all, he didn't want the worlds to be downgraded step by step.
<br><br>
According to how things were developed in the past, this was the only way.
<br><br>
With the appearance of the Evil God, however, the situation seemed to change rapidly. Clarence, who had grown cynical, began to feel a flicker of hope.
<br><br>
Once he realized he couldn't get out of the energy vine, the downgrader gave up struggling. His six pairs of compound eyes turned green as he silently stared at the Evil God, assuming a look of defeat. He calmed down when he finally realized he was no match for the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Do you think you have won?" the downgrader asked calmly.
<br><br>
"He asked that again," Clarence suddenly said. "He always asked me that question," he explained to Zen.
<br><br>
In Clarence and Mastema's game of cat and mouse, Clarence had always won. Then Mastema would ask him this question, and then begin to downgrade the worlds. This was almost always the case.
<br><br>
But this time, he was asking the Evil God the very same question.
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled nonchalantly. "You can use whatever means you have. I'll give you a chance."
<br><br>
"Wait and see!"
<br><br>
Once the downgrader finished speaking, his six pairs of compound eyes began to dim, one after another.
<br><br>
His body bound by the energy vine began to shrivel, until it disappeared.
<br><br>
"You're already dead meat, yet you still try to threaten me," the Evil God sneered.
<br><br>
Zen, however, knew better. With a grim expression, he said in a low voice, "This is not a threat."
<br><br>
The Evil God glanced at Zen curiously. "Then what is it?"
<br><br>
"He is going to downgrade the world," Zen replied bluntly. "The world will be downgraded into the Wall World."
<br><br>
The Evil God frowned slightly. Only then did it dawn on him that something was wrong.
<br><br>
Just then, the black light floating in the void suddenly began to violently tremble.
<br><br>
Boom! The vibrations made a big sound, buzzing in everyone's ears. Even the people in the fairy palace and the black ship could hear it clearly.
<br><br>
The Evil God's figure flashed as he teleported towards the black light, quickly followed by Zen.
<br><br>
The two of them eyed the black light warily and saw that the space around it was beginning to shatter. The crushed space, like a thin layer of ice, slowly expanded around the black light.
<br><br>
"The space around the black light has been downgraded to the Wall World," Zen said gloomily.
<br><br>
"At this rate, I'm afraid it will take a long time before the chaos is downgraded," the Evil God said with disdain.
<br><br>
Chapter 4316 No Solution Curled up in the black light was the downgrader, elated to see the thirdgrade world slowly downgrade into the Wall World.
<br><br>
It had been too depressing having lost to a human from the third-grade world.
<br><br>
Now, he was hell-bent on revenge.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! The downgrading will only get faster and faster! I've already mastered all the Extreme Form energies. Not only will this third-grade world be disintegrated soon, so will the other third-grade worlds, the four-grade world and the fifth-grade world! They will all disintegrate into the Wall World! You losers will all die! You tiny ants… insects… derivatives…"
<br><br>
As the downgrader muttered foul words, the Evil God stretched out his hand, shooting out a purple vine.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The purple vine pierced right through the black light, killing the downgrader.
<br><br>
"Go ahead and curse—that's all you can do. You have no power to fight back. You're the real loser," retorted the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
As the black light slightly trembled, the downgrader was reborn along with it.
<br><br>
He knew he was no match for the Evil God on his own, but with the black light infinitely reviving him, he still stood a chance.
<br><br>
"After the downgrade, you will turn into nothingness! All of you will rot in history. Only I can live forever! Insignificant humans..."
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
The Evil God almost couldn't bear his annoyance.
<br><br>
"You're too noisy for a downgrader! It's shameful! Shut the hell up!"
<br><br>
Phew! Thin threads of ice appeared from the Evil God's hands, shooting into the black light.
<br><br>
Once they entered, they curled up bit by bit, merging with the black light until they froze.
<br><br>
Frozen along with them was the downgrader.
<br><br>
The ice threads came from the "Phase" energy of the tenth-grade world.
<br><br>
Indeed, the downgrader could rely on his infinite energy to destroy the Phase energy, but it would undoubtedly take a very long time. For the time being, he couldn't curse.
<br><br>
Once the Evil God sealed him off, his gaze fixated on the transparent thin sheet. Turning to Zen, he asked, "Is it true that the downgrade can't be reversed?"
<br><br>
"As far as I know, there is no solution." Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
Believing Zen's words, the Evil God merely nodded. They had both fallen into the critical situation—Zen had nothing to gain by lying.
<br><br>
"What if I inject energy into the sheet?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
"You can give it a try."
<br><br>
In the past, Clarence had used all sorts of methods to prevent the downgrade, all to no avail. Zen didn't think the Evil God stood a chance at all.
<br><br>
After a while, the Evil God reached out to touch the transparent thin sheet.
<br><br>
The moment his fingers met the material, they were crushed by an overwhelming force The nails, skin, bones, blood of his hand… all turned to a thin piece.
<br><br>
He pulled his arm away immediately as though he felt no pain. Looking at his broken arm, he examined his flat nails, skin, and bones. "Are my fingers downgraded?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen affirmed.
<br><br>
The scene reminded Zen of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
There, Zen had also become a picture—but it wasn't a real downgrade, only an imitation.
<br><br>
The real downgrade was like the Evil God's fingers—as the very state of them changed, they had been completely downgraded from the third grade to the second grade.
<br><br>
During this process, everything was destroyed. It was impossible for people to survive as a picture on the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
From this perspective, the downgrader was right. Once the downgrade began, everyone would eventually turn into nothingness.
<br><br>
"The downgrade's power is very strong…but not necessarily stronger than mine!"
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God finished speaking, a terrifying amount of energy burst out from his arm.
<br><br>
Layers upon layers of black energy covered the back of his hand, forming a carapace as thick as dragon scales.
<br><br>
"That's the energy of the eleventh-grade world. There are four kinds of Frequency energy in the eleventh-grade world, all controlled by four respective races. This carapace is that of the Ghost Hand race—it has the strongest defensive power,"
<br><br>
Clarence explained in Zen's mind, getting active.
<br><br>
"Can the carapace resist the downgrade?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"No, it can't," Clarence affirmed.
<br><br>
Just then, the Evil God once again extended his hand to reach for the transparent sheet.
<br><br>
Woo! Woo! Woo! A sudden harsh sound was heard.
<br><br>
The carapace on the Evil God's arm overlapped with the thin, transparent sheet.
<br><br>
Its strength was quite astonishing. Even in the face of the overwhelming downgrading power, it still maintained its own shape, albeit lasting only two seconds.
<br><br>
Bit by bit, the carapace twisted until it was quickly pressed into the Wall World by the downgrading power, along with half of the Evil God's arm.
<br><br>
"Even the Frequency energy can't stop the downgrade…."
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes narrowed slightly, his face turning hard with caution.
<br><br>
A new hand rapidly grew from his broken arm.
<br><br>
While the new hand didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary at first, it was formed from the energy of the twelfth-grade world.
<br><br>
Only two kinds of energy remained in the twelfth-grade world—the "Creation Coke", and the 'Annihilation Coke".
<br><br>
There was no limit to the two kinds of energy. The Creation Coke, for instance, could recklessly form the toughest material, just like the Evil God's hand.
<br><br>
"Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle..."
<br><br>
For about fifteen seconds in the transparent sheet, the hand held on. But it couldn't avoid its fate of being downgraded. With a cracking sound, the arm's surface began to disintegrate until it was pressed into the Wall World.
<br><br>
The surprise was evident in the Evil God's eyes as his face went stiff.
<br><br>
Was Zen right? Was there really no way to stop the downgrade, he wondered? In such a short time, the transparent sheet had expanded about five to six times in diameter, reaching a hundred feet wide.
<br><br>
Compared to the scale of the entire chaos, the width of a hundred feet was rather insignificant. But according to the downgrader, the speed of expansion would increase exponentially. They didn't have much time left.
<br><br>
"Everything has a solution. There's nothing in the world I can't deal with!"
<br><br>
Then, the Evil God used the Grand Teleportation to disappear.
<br><br>
Still floating in the void, Zen eventually used Grand Teleportation as well to return to the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Neither the Snake Goddess nor the others in the fairy palace knew exactly how the battle was going. When Geoffrey saw his father, he went ahead and asked. "Father, what's happening now?"
<br><br>
"The downgrader has already been sealed," Zen replied. Everyone's faces lit up with joy upon hearing the answer, but Zen's next words made their expressions freeze. "It's not me who sealed the downgrader. It was the Evil God."
<br><br>
"The Evil God!"
<br><br>
"But why?"
<br><br>
"The entire Source World was smashed to bits! How in the world does the Evil God still have the ability to do that?"
<br><br>
The news left everyone confused.
<br><br>
"His strength far surpasses mine… it even surpasses the strength of the downgrader," Zen said with a bitter smile.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Everyone's jaws went slack with shock.
<br><br>
Both Zen's and the downgrader's powers were already something beyond their comprehension. To think that the Evil God could still far surpass them…just how powerful was he? And the Evil God had always been at odds with Zen—if he was so powerful, then how could he have just let go of Zen? "Didn't the Evil God attack you?" the Snake Goddess asked, finding it particularly odd.
<br><br>
"No." Zen shook his head.
<br><br>
"Why not?" she asked in return.
<br><br>
Given the nature of the Evil God, it was simply unimaginable that he didn't attack Zen at any opportune moment.
<br><br>
"Because it would be meaningless. The world has already begun to downgrade. We're all going to die," Zen replied, calm as ever.
<br><br>
Chapter 4317 Born By Accident Although everyone thought they had been mentally prepared for the coming of the downgrade, when they heard the words coming from Zen himself, their faces darkened.
<br><br>
"Will we live? And for how long?" Hilario asked as he trembled.
<br><br>
Zen turned around and pointed at the distance. "The downgrade starts from that direction and will rapidly spread out in all directions. I might have to take you far away from here as possible."
<br><br>
Whether they could live or not and how long they could live was not even answerable by Zen, yet everyone perfectly understood what he meant.
<br><br>
After having experienced countless disasters, these people in the fairy palace managed to stay calm.
<br><br>
As Lorena leaned on Mike's shoulder, her eyes swept over Zen, Geoffrey, and Yan and her lips curled into a faint smile.
<br><br>
Now that all her enemies had died, she had no regrets in life. She saw herself already very lucky to be able to spend her remaining time with her family.
<br><br>
Rocher, Bromley, and the others also displayed a seemingly odd composure.
<br><br>
"Alas, it's a pity that my long-cherished wish hasn't been fulfilled yet,"
<br><br>
Fuxi blurted out downheartedly.
<br><br>
"What long-cherished wish?" Zen asked, looking at him in curiosity.
<br><br>
"To break the needle!" revealed Fuxi.
<br><br>
A long time ago, Fuxi had made up his mind to prevent the end of the chaos and become the Finale Hero. However, things had drastically changed, and the needle that had appeared at the end of this round of chaos was so powerful to the extent that the Eternal Realm warriors could not resist it.
<br><br>
He knew that it was meaningless to break the needle now, but he still had this flaming desire deep in his heart.
<br><br>
"I'll help you fulfill your dream," said Zen.
<br><br>
Fuxi waved his hand and said, "Forget it. If I can't do it myself, it would only be pointless..."
<br><br>
"No. You will do it yourself."
<br><br>
After saying that, Zen gently pointed his finger at Fuxi and massive energy started to pour into his body that made him tremble slightly.
<br><br>
As an Eternal Realm warrior, Fuxi couldn't bear too much energy.
<br><br>
However, when Zen infused energy into Fuxi's body, he had also strengthened Fuxi's body in order to help him carry the weight of this energy.
<br><br>
When Zen had injected enough energy, a thought came to his mind which suddenly moved the entire fairy palace a long distance to the front of the needle.
<br><br>
"Go ahead. You can do it," said Zen in a motivating tone as he nodded to Fuxi.
<br><br>
Fuxi had never grasped such terrifying energy before, and the feeling of possessing a wonderful abundance of energy could not be put into words.
<br><br>
He felt as if he could easily tear anything and everything apart.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He jumped up, rising from the ground of the fairy palace. His figure flickered as the winds pressed against his face, and soon landed on the head of the needle.
<br><br>
Fuxi broke the tip of the needle and retreated a distance of ten feet. With a loud shout, he gathered the strength all over his body in his fist and released it.
<br><br>
Compared to the huge needle, Fuxi was just a single dust particle.
<br><br>
However, the power radiating from this dust particle had surprisingly caused the needle to shatter into pieces and collapse from its head...
<br><br>
Clatter, clatter, clatter...
<br><br>
In the end, the thunderous sound of the needle collapsing caught the attention of the Evil God. The Evil God used the power of omniscience to check what had happened and faintly snorted, "Why would he even waste time doing such boring and useless thing..."
<br><br>
"Hahaha. I feel great!"
<br><br>
When he returned to the fairy palace, Fuxi looked satisfied with a wide grin. For more than one thousand past chaotic eras, he was the only one who had achieved this. He had finally fulfilled his lifelong wish.
<br><br>
Certainly, there was nothing happier in the world.
<br><br>
Fuxi's upbeat mood influenced the others. The originally dull atmosphere suddenly became cheerful because of him. Fuxi even took out a bottle of wine, inviting everyone to drink with him.
<br><br>
Zen withdrew quietly and walked into a courtyard, sitting on a stone chair at the center instead.
<br><br>
With a thought, he activated the omniscient power. Instantly, he saw that on the other side of the chaos, the Evil God was standing on the black ship, giving out orders to what looked like two billion brains.
<br><br>
Because of his omniscient power, Zen also found out everything about the Evil God and what he had been doing.
<br><br>
The Evil God had transformed the Source World into two billion brains at the Holy Soul Realm. It was indeed a crazy move! Right now, the Evil God placed his hopes on these two billion brains, expecting them to come up with a plan to stop the downgrade.
<br><br>
"Is there really no way to stop the downgrade?" Zen asked sounding desperate.
<br><br>
He had verified this answer from Clarence. The answer was very clear as it had been confirmed all the way from the highest-grade world.
<br><br>
"According to past experiences, there is indeed no solution," Clarence's voice suddenly responded.
<br><br>
"You mean something else with your words," said Zen.
<br><br>
After a moment of silence, Clarence continued, "Experience is based on rules, but if something breaks the rules, experience will be unreliable."
<br><br>
"Are you talking about the Evil God?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Well, not only him but also you," replied Clarence.
<br><br>
When Clarence saw that the Evil God used the energies of the high-grade worlds, he realized that something strange had happened.
<br><br>
He then pried into Zen's memories, trying to dig for answers and figure out the cause and effect.
<br><br>
"The Evil God was born from your inner world. In fact, he is the personification of all the negative emotions in your primitive land. From this point of view, the Evil God is actually the complete opposite of you,"
<br><br>
Clarence continued.
<br><br>
Zen nodded as he listened closely.
<br><br>
"Mastema and I have the same origin. He is created by me, yet I can no longer restrain him... Don't you think that your relationship with the Evil God is much like my relationship with Mastema?" Clarence added, "Your birth and the Evil God's birth couldn't be merely a coincidence."
<br><br>
Zen shook his head as he didn't think so. "There are many cases like me and the Evil God in the world."
<br><br>
"But the Evil God can directly use the power of the high-grade worlds, which is against the basic rules," Clarence emphasized. "If I'm not mistaken, you can also use the power of the high-grade worlds."
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..." Zen chuckled with self-mockery as he said, "I can only use the Extreme Form energies with your help. I can't even understand the energies of the high-grade worlds, not to mention use them."
<br><br>
"You will be able to understand after I give the energies to you."
<br><br>
After saying that, Clarence injected a massive amount of memory into Zen's mind.
<br><br>
It was the information about how the energies of the sixth-grade world, seventh-grade world, eighth-grade world till the twelfth-grade world, Field, Weight, Coupling, Cube...
<br><br>
had all been created.
<br><br>
The downgrader and Clarence both controlled the energies of the highgrade worlds, but after the high-grade worlds were downgraded, they could no longer do so as the basic rules restricted them.
<br><br>
With his eyes closed, Zen digested all the memories in his mind.
<br><br>
After a short while, Zen slowly opened his eyes.
<br><br>
A trace of excitement then reflected in his darkened expression.
<br><br>
He still didn't know if he could find a way to stop the downgrade. If he really stopped it from happening, a battle would definitely emerge between him and the Evil God.
<br><br>
Relying on the Extreme Form energies alone, he would surely lose. He indeed needed to grasp the power at a higher level.
<br><br>
"Energy... Field."
<br><br>
Zen stretched out his hands and gently rubbed his two fingers as the energy started to flow slowly.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Streams of light blue energy then began to rotate, forming a perfect ring that floated in front of Zen.
<br><br>
It was a brand-new energy—Field.
<br><br>
"I... did this?" Zen stared at the ring in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Go on," Clarence urged.
<br><br>
Zen then unleashed the Weight, Coupling, Cube, and other energies one after another with an unbelievably smooth process.
<br><br>
"My judgment is right," said Clarence. "Both you and the Evil God were born by accident in this world, so you can go on and ignore the basic rules."
<br><br>
"By accident? What do you mean?" Zen asked, looking puzzled.
<br><br>
Chapter 4318 Plan "Maybe you don't belong here," said Clarence.
<br><br>
"I don't belong here? I was indeed born in this world, and so was the Evil God," Zen said in confusion. He did not understand why Clarence said such a thing.
<br><br>
Zen was a human being who was born in the third-grade world, the chaos, and the Evil God was a human being born in Zen's inner world. Both of them did not come from distinct backgrounds, and what they experienced was a coincidence at most. Elder Xue, who had gone to the Deep Space, had created this coincidence.
<br><br>
However, Clarence suddenly said those words, which surprised Zen. He had no idea how Clarence came to such a conclusion.
<br><br>
"I can't explain," Clarence said with a shake of his head.
<br><br>
All the way from the thirteenth-grade world to the third-grade one, Clarence had seen all sorts of strange civilizations.
<br><br>
There was a civilization of pure energy bodies, creatures of pure consciousness, and races in the shape of stone tablets like the Sacred Spirit race.
<br><br>
Yet, no matter how they changed, those creatures, races, and civilizations followed the most basic rules.
<br><br>
There were no exceptions! That was also why Clarence did not want to help Zen. He believed that the latter's struggle was meaningless.
<br><br>
But the method that the Evil God had used violated all those basic rules, which gave Clarence a new perspective.
<br><br>
Indeed, the Evil God broke the rules! Clarence had thought about this issue, which was why he had asked Zen to give it a try. The result was what Clarence had expected, and that was Zen had the same ability as the Evil God.
<br><br>
"From the high-grade worlds to the low-grade worlds, they are all under your control. Why is there anything that you can't explain?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
In general, he could only be omniscient in his primitive land, unlike Clarence, who owned the perfect land. Clarence controlled all the materials and energy, but now he had encountered something that he could not explain.
<br><br>
Clarence burst into laughter at Zen's question and said, "The truth is that there are many questions that I cannot answer. I don't know where I came from. I don't know who created the perfect land, nor do I know what exists outside the perfect land..."
<br><br>
All the creatures of every world considered Clarence as the supreme creator, who had all kinds of abilities and was the core of all the rules.
<br><br>
In turn, all the creatures he trusted could find any answers from him, and they took him as their guide.
<br><br>
But who could lead the way for Clarence? He clearly understood that downgrade felt like a devastating blow to him, but it was impossible to predict what would happen in the first-grade world. Even the downgrader was also confused, and he did not know what would happen if the world got downgraded to the first grade. However, since his mission seemed to be engraved to his bones, it drove him to do such a thing.
<br><br>
Clarence continued, "I spent countless years looking for an answer. I have tried many times, and even subdued Mastema in the eighth-grade world. I consumed ninety-nine percent of the energy in the eighth-grade world and launched a powerful energy attack."
<br><br>
"That force must be immensely powerful..." Zen said in a shaky voice.
<br><br>
"What's the point of being powerful? The world still moves within the rules, and I am just a prisoner in it," Clarence muttered.
<br><br>
"Then now..."
<br><br>
"Now I see that you have broken the rules, which gave me hope. There seems to be a gap in the cage of rules," Clarence said in a slightly joyful tone.
<br><br>
At first, he was quite indifferent to Zen. For him, Zen was just a new host, but now he had shown a great deal of patience.
<br><br>
"Can breaking the rules stop the downgrading?" Zen asked. A flame of hope flickered in his heart.
<br><br>
"Maybe, or maybe not," Clarence answered.
<br><br>
Before, he was quite sure that it was impossible to stop the process of downgrading, but now he felt optimistic.
<br><br>
"What should I do?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
"Devour the Evil God," suggested Clarence.
<br><br>
When Zen heard those words, his jaw dropped in shock.
<br><br>
"The Evil God has taken away something that should have belonged to you. If you can take it back, then I might be able to find a way to stop the downgrading," said Clarence.
<br><br>
Still, Zen looked a bit hesitant. "We have the same power now. I'm afraid it won't be easy to devour him," he said.
<br><br>
"He is inexperienced in using those energies at advanced levels, but I can give my experiences to you," Clarence said with a faint smile.
<br><br>
Zen previously had the same power as the downgrader, which was the Extreme Form energies. However, he was at a disadvantage because the downgrader was much more experienced.
<br><br>
If Clarence gave his experiences to Zen, then Zen would have a higher chance of winning against the Evil God.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen did not stay anything. Instead, he activated the power of omniscience.
<br><br>
As for the Evil God, he did not pay attention to the fairy palace at all.
<br><br>
After all, he exerted all his effort on stopping the downgrading.
<br><br>
He had ordered two billion brains to think of a solution. In turn, the brains thought that when the Evil God won, they would live and escape from being controlled. They hoped that the Evil God would give them new bodies and even freedom. Unfortunately, they heard that the world began to downgrade. It made them quite furious, and in order to survive, they had no choice but try their best to help the Evil God.
<br><br>
Although they actively helped out, this was an unsolvable problem. No matter how many of them were there, they couldn't change the situation.
<br><br>
Their original plan was to let the Evil God seal the Wall World.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Evil God went to the downgraded area and released a flood of the Cold Phase. Alas, it was useless. Only crystal clear snowflakes remained in the Wall World that had expanded multiple times.
<br><br>
Then, the brains asked the Evil God to fill the Wall World with materials.
<br><br>
The Evil God tried again. He created a thousand mountains and threw them in. Those mountains became crushed into thin, grayish-brown pieces and sank into the Wall World.
<br><br>
Without another word, the Evil God even created tens of millions of mountains.
<br><br>
It was not hard for him as he possessed an infinite amount of energy and materials.
<br><br>
Despite that, the downgrading power could also devour everything indefinitely. It meant that even filling the Wall World with materials was not an effective method.
<br><br>
One method...
<br><br>
Two methods...
<br><br>
Three methods...
<br><br>
Some time had passed, and the Evil God had tried more than twenty methods in a row.
<br><br>
The downgrading continued, while the Wall World's speed of expansion further increased. It was not long before it had grown to the size of a province in the Source World.
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God looked at the rapidly expanding Wall World, he suddenly heard a mocking laugh from the black light in the center of the Wall World. Then the black light said, "You can break some rules, but you can't stop the downgrading. Even Clarence can't stop it, not to mention a nobody like you."
<br><br>
"Clarence? Who is he?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
"He is my creator, but he is also against me. He is omniscient, but he still can't do anything about the downgrading," the downgrader answered.
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes lit up. "Where is he?" he asked eagerly.
<br><br>
"He is hiding within Zen's body, of course. Ha-ha..." the downgrader sneered, in a deliberate attempt to provoke the Evil God.
<br><br>
After a few moments of silence, the Evil God suddenly stretched out his hand, and a ring of energy appeared in his palm.
<br><br>
He then grasped the ring of energy, and his body quickly disappeared.
<br><br>
In the next second, he appeared in the fairy palace. The energy ring in his hand immediately flew towards Zen and was about to wrap around his head.
<br><br>
Even though the Evil God's attack was quite abrupt, Zen was not slow to react. He swiftly reached out and gently pinched the edge of the energy ring, which caused it to break.
<br><br>
Chapter 4319 The Final Battle Zen had always been observing the Evil God with the omniscient power.
<br><br>
He could hear the conversation between the Evil God and the downgrader as clear as day.
<br><br>
He tensed up and was on guard when he heard the downgrader mention Clarence. He knew very well the sort of temperament the Evil God had and how he could explode in a rage at any moment.
<br><br>
Now that the Evil God knew Clarence was in Zen's body, he would no doubt make a move. But Zen was ready for it, ready to react.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The Evil God's eyes flashed in surprise at the sight of the broken energy ring.
<br><br>
It was not only Zen's quick reaction that had shocked him, but also the fact that the energy ring was the Controlling Field, and Zen should not have been able to combat the energy of the sixth-grade world.
<br><br>
That Zen could crush the Controlling Field with a mere gentle pinch was inconceivable.
<br><br>
The Evil God soon calmed himself; he also possessed the omniscient power. With a quick search through his mind, the image of Zen trying the energies of the higher-grade worlds came to him.
<br><br>
"How about we take this elsewhere?" Zen suggested.
<br><br>
"No need!" the Evil God replied.
<br><br>
Lightning flashed from one of his hands. Two triangular plates flashed with lightning.
<br><br>
"Lightning Weight!"
<br><br>
Boom! The lightning that struck out from the strike of his palm was a million times brighter than the sun, and contained enough energy to destroy the Source World three hundred thousand times, let alone this courtyard in the fairy palace. It would have turned an Eternal Realm warrior such as Fuxi to powder by its immense power.
<br><br>
As the triangular plates made contact with Zen's body, a small Space Weight appeared in each of the four corners of the small courtyard. All the energy that had erupted from the Lightning Weight was sealed within the courtyard.
<br><br>
The fairy palace shook only slightly, and the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others didn't even feel it at all.
<br><br>
Zen noticed that the Evil God was about to make another move and stretched a hand towards the sky.
<br><br>
Splash! The black ship crashed into the side of the fairy palace.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven, Shera and Edna all looked on at the Snake Goddess and her companions in the fairy palace in a daze.
<br><br>
"Now why don't we go somewhere else?" asked Zen defiantly.
<br><br>
"Are you threatening me?" The Evil God's eyes burned with danger.
<br><br>
"What if I am?" Zen asked, grinning.
<br><br>
The Evil God had once not cared about anything, but things might have changed.
<br><br>
His figure silently and gradually vanished, instantly appearing at the other end of the chaos.
<br><br>
Zen knew his location by way of the omniscient power and appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
They were in an absolute void, where there was not even a speck of dust for trillions of miles.
<br><br>
"We won't need to hold back here," announced Zen.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God was in no hurry to make a move. He seemed to be lost in thought. After a long while, he said, "I will not kill you. All you need to do is ask Clarence to come out and let me devour him. I'm sure I'll find a way to end the downgrading from him."
<br><br>
Zen grinned, beaming with amusement, as if he'd been told a joke. Just as he was about to offer his retort, a light emerged from his eyebrows.
<br><br>
It was a gentle and soft ball of light, which made both Zen and the Evil God feel as though they were bathing in a spring breeze, calm and serene.
<br><br>
"You will not be able to find a way to end the downgrading from me. But you may still have a chance if you merge with Zen."
<br><br>
It was Clarence's voice that came from the ball of light. He did not seem angered by the Evil God's remarks, and instead attempted to patiently persuade him.
<br><br>
"It seems that you have this idea, too?" inquired the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Yes," answered Clarence.
<br><br>
"Then..." The Evil God's eyes sparked with an idea. "Let's fight with our own abilities then!"
<br><br>
Before he could get a response, he threw a hand towards Zen and a blood red vine shot out. This was the Cube energy of the ninth-grade world.
<br><br>
Buzz! Zen disappeared faster than the blink of an eye and retreated more than a thousand miles. But with the power of omniscience, locating him was easy work for the Evil God and he followed closely behind Zen's teleportation.
<br><br>
However, Zen was omniscient as well. Faced with the blood red vine, he retaliated by materializing a long black sword with the Cube energy. He raised his hand up and slashed down hard.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The black sword sliced the blood red vine, releasing a diamond shaped light that spanned hundreds of thousands of miles.
<br><br>
Whoosh! When the black sword slashed the vine once more, Zen and the Evil God had already moved a million miles away and another huge diamond shaped light spot exploded.
<br><br>
The Evil God kept up his attack, while Zen continued defending.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! They began clashing more and more, faster and faster and the number of diamond shaped light spots increased as well.
<br><br>
Within a few seconds, they had already clashed tens of thousands of times and crossed a trillion miles of space, and the diamond shaped lights had turned to tiny needles in the distance behind them.
<br><br>
"Was this strength given to you by Clarence?" asked the Evil God as he continued his fierce assault.
<br><br>
"Does it make a difference?" Zen asked back.
<br><br>
"Even if you possess the power of the higher-grade worlds, you are still weak!"
<br><br>
He gently drew back the blood red vine as he spoke. A chill then spread and threads of ice as thin as hair rushed at Zen's head. He had put the Cold Phase to use.
<br><br>
Zen felt as if his blood was about to freeze as he was overtaken by the overwhelming coldness.
<br><br>
However, when the Evil God had used the Cold Phase, Zen's eyes were already burning with flames of the Fire Phase of the tenth-grade world.
<br><br>
Splash! The Fire Phase produced very ordinary flames, no different from those from normal wood.
<br><br>
But with a roll of the flames, all the ice threads melted and were burnt to nothing.
<br><br>
This caused the Evil God's brow to furrow.
<br><br>
Zen had been defending passively.
<br><br>
But no matter what sort of energy he threw at him, Zen was able to effortlessly and rapidly deflate it. He suddenly felt as if all was not right and that he might be in danger, as if he had been seen through.
<br><br>
"Go on," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
The Evil God made up his mind and released even more terrifying energy.
<br><br>
Thick scales surfaced from his body and wrapped him tightly.
<br><br>
The scales, created by the Ghost Hand race with the Frequency energy, were harder than any other. With his new armor on, the Evil God pounced once again.
<br><br>
"Shatter!"
<br><br>
Zen clasped his hands together and a small square appeared between them.
<br><br>
Bang! The small square exploded along with the Evil God's armor.
<br><br>
The Evil God then burst into laughter. He had darted above Zen's head and already had a long spear pressed against his forehead.
<br><br>
The spear was made of the Annihilation Coke. As the strongest destructive force in the twelfth-grade world, nothing could block it.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
He thrust the spear down and the Restriction Field at the edge of the chaos disappeared.
<br><br>
As long as the Restriction Field was still there, this area was a part of the Source World, and the Evil God and Zen would be omniscient and revived infinitely.
<br><br>
To Kill Zen, the Evil God would have to remove the Restriction Field and destroy the primitive land.
<br><br>
His long spear pierced through Zen's forehead, just as the Restriction Field was withdrawn.
<br><br>
Chapter 4320 Smooth The Evil God's eyes lit up with excitement as the spear struck Zen.
<br><br>
Without any resistance, the spear formed from the Annihilation Coke pierced through Zen's head and slid cleanly into his body.
<br><br>
Even as he killed Zen, the Evil God released the Creation Coke. It formed a star-shaped cage around Zen's corpse.
<br><br>
Of course, he had no interest in Zen's corpse. He wanted to trap Clarence inside it.
<br><br>
A spot on Zen's body began to glow from within.
<br><br>
There was a slight crackling sound as a bright sphere emerged from Zen's corpse.
<br><br>
The glowing sphere flew up, colliding with the star-shaped cage. The sphere bounced back. It bumped into the cage again, as though trying to escape, but the cage created by the Creation Coke was virtually indestructible. No matter how hard he tried, Clarence couldn't break free.
<br><br>
The Evil God slowly descended to the side of the cage. There was a look of great satisfaction on his face as he gazed at the mysterious sphere.
<br><br>
"Although the energy of the twelfth-grade world consists only of the Creation Coke and the Annihilation Coke, they can change constantly.
<br><br>
This cage is the result of a theurgy designed by my two billion brothers, and it's more than strong enough to trap you," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
The sound of Clarence's voice came from the glowing sphere. "You have just mastered the energy of the Creation Coke, but you have already comprehended it and invented ways to maximize and improve it. This star-shaped cage fully displays the advantages of the Creation Coke. It's incredible!"
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled. With evident pride, he said, "My talent is beyond your imagination. You won't regret being devoured by me. Contribute everything you have!"
<br><br>
The tone of amazement vanished from Clarence's voice, replaced by indignation. "Never!"
<br><br>
Once more, the sphere began to try to escape, colliding over and over again with the star-shaped cage.
<br><br>
But Clarence's efforts were useless. The star-shaped cage did not budge even an inch.
<br><br>
"It's useless," said the Evil God calmly.
<br><br>
He lifted his hand, and the star-shaped cage began to shrink. The space left for Clarence became smaller and smaller. Finally, he was tightly enclosed by the cage, with no room to move.
<br><br>
"I heard that you are the one who created the downgrader, and also the ruler of the highest level. It's too stupid for you to go into such a situation with such a strong power. It's a waste for you to keep such power,"
<br><br>
the Evil God said, stretching out his hand.
<br><br>
His fingers elongated until they resembled slender threads. Although his fingers were no thicker than noodles, they were powerful. They slid into the cage and began drilling into the sphere.
<br><br>
"You will regret this! No one can devour me! You are digging your own grave!"
<br><br>
Clarence roared, sounding furious and aggrieved.
<br><br>
The Evil God laughed. "Both you and the downgrader are so arrogant.
<br><br>
Worse, you are weak!"
<br><br>
With that, the Evil God closed his eyes and began absorbing the sphere through his fingers.
<br><br>
The sphere dimmed and shrank at an astonishing speed.
<br><br>
Clarence's voice became weaker, and then there was silence as he stopped speaking completely.
<br><br>
After absorbing Clarence, the Evil God slowly opened his eyes. On his face was a look of wild, undisguised joy. He moved and arrived almost instantly at the center of the chaos, where he stood on a high spot, surveying the darkness of the black light beneath him.
<br><br>
Because the world was being downgraded, there was an extremely strong traction force above and below the Wall World. However, it had no pull upon the Evil God.
<br><br>
"You have failed twenty-six times. Do you want to fail the twenty-seventh time?" the downgrader asked sullenly.
<br><br>
He had already broken free from the Cold Phase imposed by the Evil God, but he knew that he was no match for him. So he simply hid within the black light and waited for the world to be completely downgraded.
<br><br>
"We won't know until I give it a try," the Evil God said casually.
<br><br>
"Once the world is downgraded, there is no possibility of reversal," the downgrader sneered. He emitted a bark of sharp laughter, enveloped in the black light.
<br><br>
The Evil God was in a good mood, so he ignored the mocking tone of the downgrader. He said, "I don't need to reverse the downgrading. All I need to do is stop it!"
<br><br>
There was a rush of air as the Evil God suddenly raised his hand.
<br><br>
Immediately, the whole world began turning into ice and snow.
<br><br>
A massive wave of huge ice crystals swarmed into the atmosphere.
<br><br>
At first, the Wall World devoured these ice crystals easily. However, the barrage of ice crystals kept coming, until the world could no longer resist.
<br><br>
Slowly, everything stopped, and the world froze over.
<br><br>
"How is this possible?"
<br><br>
the downgrader exclaimed, unable to hide his shock.
<br><br>
He shook his head in denial. "It's impossible!"
<br><br>
With that, deep within the black light, the downgrader burst out the Flame Extreme Form.
<br><br>
He tried to use the energy to melt the frozen Wall World. But even as he made his move, he felt a blast of cold air pouring into the black light. The Evil God was suppressing him again.
<br><br>
"It's over," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
He stared down at the black light and saw that the Wall World was no longer expanding. Instead of satisfaction, for some reason he felt a stirring of uneasiness.
<br><br>
Everything was going so smoothly that it seemed too good to be true.
<br><br>
He moved again, and arrived in a flash above the fairy palace. Most of the black ship was already destroyed, since Zen had earlier pulled it over and crashed it into the fairy palace.
<br><br>
But the black ship was not so easy to destroy. After the ship was repaired by the former captain, it floated in the air again.
<br><br>
Neither the fairy palace nor the black ship made a move. They only maintained a certain distance between them, each seeing the vigilance of the other.
<br><br>
Without warning, the Evil God appeared on the deck of the black ship.
<br><br>
Edna, Shera, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and Duran let out sighs of relief.
<br><br>
Those in the fairy palace had the opposite reaction. The faces of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and their companions darkened.
<br><br>
"What has happened to Zen?" the Snake Goddess shouted.
<br><br>
"You know the answer to that. Only one of us could live in the end," said the Evil God, laughing softly. He clasped his hands behind his back.
<br><br>
At those words, many of those in the fairy palace bowed their heads with grief. Some wanted to rush to the black ship and attack, but even the slightest glance from the Evil God was enough to incapacitate them.
<br><br>
When he stared at them, they collapsed to the ground, unable to move.
<br><br>
Right now, the Evil God was the absolute ruler of the fairy palace. Not even the downgrader could resist him, let alone the humans in the fairy palace.
<br><br>
The Evil God's smile disappeared, and he gazed grimly at those in the fairy palace. "Go to hell!" he cried, raising his hand, prepared to crush everyone.
<br><br>
But Edna stepped forward, stopping him. "Dear, this world has become far too desolate. Please don't kill anyone else."
<br><br>
There was nothing now in the whole chaos, only an endless void. Edna didn't like this kind of world very much.
<br><br>
The Evil God paused, then turned to give her a faint smile. "Since you intercede, I'll leave them alive. As you said, this world is indeed too desolate. Let me see what I can do..."
<br><br>
He stretched out his hands and moved them through the air, as though he was drawing something.
<br><br>
The sky above them lightened to a soothing azure.
<br><br>
The earth extended around them. Mountains, rivers, canyons and basins appeared one after another.
<br><br>
Tall walls, pavilions, and streets were created instantly, sprinkled across the landscape.
<br><br>
"Now, people!" declared the Evil God.
<br><br>
He waved his hands in the air again.
<br><br>
Instantly, the empty world changed. It was now entirely populated, filled with people who moved and looked around them with wide eyes.
<br><br>
"Come with me!"
<br><br>
said the Evil God, taking Edna by the hand. He pulled her into his embrace, and together, the two of them soared into the air above the city.
<br><br>
When the people below saw the two beings floating above them, they all dropped to the ground, prostrating themselves before these seeming gods.
<br><br>
The Evil God had seen this scene before, when he was very young. The people had worshipped Zen as their creator.
<br><br>
He felt a surge of pleasure as he realized that with Zen dead, he now held that position.
<br><br>
"Where is our home?" Edna asked, safely enclosed in the arms of the Evil God.
<br><br>
"There,"
<br><br>
the Evil God replied, looking ahead.
<br><br>
A broad, elegant courtyard was sprawled on top of a majestic snowy mountain.
<br><br>
The Evil God led Edna into the courtyard, and they landed gently on the ground. A peaceful mood had come over the Evil God now that his victory was complete. He felt utterly relaxed, content to stay here without moving.
<br><br>
"You deserve some rest. Go to sleep," said Edna gently, touching his face.
<br><br>
Her soft voice was hypnotic, and soon, the Evil God found himself lying on a bed. He settled down and let his eyes close.
<br><br>
However, almost as soon as he closed his eyes, they snapped back open.
<br><br>
His face was full of anger. A sudden chill ran down his head to the base of his back, leaving a trail of iciness all along his spine.
<br><br>
Chapter 4321 Fight Hand To Hand "Edna," the Evil God called his wife.
<br><br>
"What's wrong, honey?" his wife responded softly.
<br><br>
She smiled faintly and batted her long lashes. Her beauty could've made any man weak.
<br><br>
"Do you remember what I told you before?" the Evil God asked. "That when everything is settled, we would live in seclusion?"
<br><br>
Edna nodded. "Yes. I remember how you liked to live in seclusion back when we were in the inner world of the creator. We—"
<br><br>
Crack! Before she could even finish her sentence, the Evil God grabbed her by the neck, flames spurting out from his hands.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the flesh and muscle were incinerated, leaving only her ghastly white bones. The bones hissed under the heat of the flames and trembled violently.
<br><br>
"Humph! Break!"
<br><br>
the Evil God shouted, his voice filled with rage.
<br><br>
Flashes of lightning burst forth from his eyes.
<br><br>
Everything the lightning touched was sliced into pieces.
<br><br>
The unique courtyard...
<br><br>
The blue sky, the earth, the city...
<br><br>
Everything in this world started to collapse, revealing a translucent egg membrane. From within, the Evil God caught sight of Zen standing outside.
<br><br>
"You attempted to trap me in an illusion?" the Evil God spat coldly.
<br><br>
Zen raised his eyebrows curiously. "He's found out the truth. We've failed."
<br><br>
This had been Clarence's plan.
<br><br>
No matter how high the level of energy was, it was still easy for one to fall into an illusion. This was the same strategy the downgrader had used to trap Zen with the Soul Extreme Form previously.
<br><br>
In all their battles, Clarence had always created a huge illusion to suppress the downgrader.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, they had underestimated the Evil God. His instinct was extremely keen.
<br><br>
Having grown up in cruelty, he had absorbed all the negative emotions in Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
It was unsurprising he had become a cold-blooded killer.
<br><br>
This pleasant world didn't align with things he was familiar with, so he saw through the deception quite easily.
<br><br>
The illusion might've only lasted for a moment, but it was enough to place the Evil God in an extremely dangerous position. Every hair on his body stood up.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
the Evil God roared, suddenly stretching out his hand to grab at Zen.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Zen managed to retreat backwards more than ten thousand feet. However, to his surprise, the Evil God's arm closed that distance swiftly, grabbing him by the neck.
<br><br>
Splash! A powerful force of space was applied to the two of them, and the next moment, they arrived above the Wall World. The Evil God ruthlessly pressed Zen towards the Wall World.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The instant Zen's feet touched the Wall World, they were downgraded, shattering into thin slivers of blood.
<br><br>
Then his legs, abdomen, and chest suffered the same fate as these parts connected with the Wall World.
<br><br>
Seeing that his entire body was being pressed into the Wall World, Zen struggled to shift to the side, grabbing the Evil God by his shoulders.
<br><br>
Gritting his teeth, Zen twisted what was left of his body, dragging the Evil God into the Wall World.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Because the Evil God's body had been strengthened by the Frequency energy, the process of downgrading was even more intense. An earpiercing sound erupted and sparks shot out as his body was downgraded.
<br><br>
In a matter of mere seconds, only the Evil God's head remained of his body.
<br><br>
Buzz! The energy of the Creation Coke roared to life once again.
<br><br>
Just in the nick of time, the Evil God's body began to grow from the top of his head. A neck, then his body, arms, and legs sprouted from his scalp like strange plants.
<br><br>
As soon as his arm was developed, he threw a punch at Zen's chest. It was powerful enough to fling Zen backwards, away from the Evil God.
<br><br>
Having gotten rid of Zen's grasp, the Evil God was finally able to gather his bearings. Firmly clasping his head from both sides, he gently pulled his head off and straightened it before planting it firmly back on his neck.
<br><br>
Zen also took this opportunity to recover his missing lower body.
<br><br>
"Great! You truly are worthy of being my nemesis! Again!"
<br><br>
The eyes of the Evil God flashed viciously, like a hungry beast eyeing its prey.
<br><br>
After leaving Zen's inner world, the Evil God was faced with even more challenging worlds. In the Source World and the chaos, he had encountered all sorts of opponents, but no one had come close to being as difficult to deal with as Zen.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Evil God, only Zen was strong enough to be his opponent. Even the downgrader and Clarence weren't worthy.
<br><br>
Swoosh! As soon as he finished speaking, the Evil God pounced on Zen once more.
<br><br>
Zen gritted his teeth as the Evil God approached, making no attempt to dodge. He knew that this was a difficult battle he couldn't run away from.
<br><br>
If the Evil God was his other self, then he had no choice but to deal with him now.
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God was about to collide into him, Zen leapt upwards. His body drew an arc in the air, until he kicked the Evil God, sending him straight towards the Wall World.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! One of the Evil God's legs was downgraded upon impact, but he'd managed to grab onto Zen's foot, dragging Zen along with him.
<br><br>
The two of them seemed to be fighting hand to hand on a vast snow plain, and anything that touched the line of snow would disappear.
<br><br>
However, whenever they escaped from the line, their bodies would recover instantly.
<br><br>
It all happened so fast. Anyone watching from afar wouldn't have been able to tell that they were ever injured.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Zen and the Evil God rolled and crawled along the surface of the Wall World.
<br><br>
Sometimes, the right half of Zen's body completely disappeared, leaving only the other half. On the other hand, the upper half of the Evil God's body was downgraded, leaving only his legs and the lower half of his body. At some point, only half of Zen's skull was left, whereas what was left of the Evil God was just a finger.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the two of them had become too strong that even their physical bodies couldn't restrain them, and even their cinnabar fields no longer existed. Consequently, as long as a part of their bodies was still alive, they could recover in an instant.
<br><br>
As they continued to fight each other head on, the downgrader watched quietly from within the black light.
<br><br>
He never would've imagined that the battle would be so fierce; it never occurred to him either that they would use the Wall World as a weapon.
<br><br>
Initially, the downgrader had no intention of joining this battle. After all, the downgrading had just begun. He only needed to sit this out patiently.
<br><br>
However, as he watched the two of them roll back and forth on the Wall World, he began to feel as though they weren't taking the downgrading seriously.
<br><br>
"Since you two are so intent on killing each other, why don't you just die together?"
<br><br>
The downgrader decided to take this as an opportunity to strike, suddenly appearing above the two of them. The Extreme Form energy that had been stored for a long time suddenly exploded.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The downgrader initially thought that this would be enough to push both of them into the Wall World.
<br><br>
However, when he had released the Extreme Form energy, the two barely even flinched.
<br><br>
While it might've looked like they were fighting hand-to-hand, they were in fact using the Creation Coke and the Annihilation Coke alternatively.
<br><br>
Moreover, they had the strongest bodies and the most destructive power.
<br><br>
The Extreme Form energy simply paled in comparison.
<br><br>
"Fuck off!"
<br><br>
The Evil God threw a punch in his direction without even looking, and the once arrogant downgrader was blasted away instantly.
<br><br>
Zen somersaulted in the air, simultaneously activating the Cube energy.
<br><br>
As he pointed at what remained of the downgrader's body, the Cube energy enveloped the fragments and sent them to oblivion. Without batting an eyelash, the two managed to kill the downgrader before he even had the chance to strike.
<br><br>
Without pausing to take a breath, Zen and the Evil God continued to fight each other fiercely.
<br><br>
Chapter 4322 The Cutoff Of Energy Buzz...
<br><br>
The downgrader was born anew within the black light.
<br><br>
The symbolic six pairs of compound eyes were set ablaze by a striking purple light that flickered from time to time, which represented his confusion.
<br><br>
When he regained his senses, he realized that the world had become nothing like he imagined it would be.
<br><br>
From the highest-grade world all the way to this low-grade world, the only worthy adversary he had that matched his standard of strength was Clarence. Then where did these two come from? "I don't care how powerful you are. It doesn't change the fact that you're destined to get destroyed to the point of oblivion!" The downgrader scorned resentfully as his body remained camouflaged under the black light.
<br><br>
As the battle between the Evil God and Zen raged on, the Wall World continued to shake and expand rapidly.
<br><br>
Within the short span of an hour, the Wall World underwent an extreme expansion from the range of ten provinces to the size equivalent to that of the Source World. As time continued to pass by, the rate of expansion grew exponentially.
<br><br>
Buzz! The Evil God slowly grew weary with this form of hand to hand combat that ceased to reach a conclusive end.
<br><br>
He suddenly retreated to a fair distance and soared into the sky as he leaped to an incredible height of about one hundred million feet. As he continued to ascend, his mind was a cluster of countless thoughts rushing to be heard all at the same time.
<br><br>
Suddenly, huge runes appeared at the top of the chaos, and one hundred thousand thunder dragons manifested in the form of energy started to rain down on Zen from those runes.
<br><br>
Clatter, clatter, clatter...
<br><br>
Each thunder dragon harnessed a formidable strength that was ten thousand times stronger than that of the ending needle. The energy aura that was released by these thunder dragons alone held the capability to destroy everything in the chaos.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed as they fell on the approaching calamity. He prepared himself and gave his hand a slight wave in the direction of the fairy palace. Upon this gesture, a formidable shield was constructed around the fairy palace. Without this shield, the fairy palace would have been rendered vulnerable and eventually perished if it were enveloped by the dominating aura of energy.
<br><br>
After all the preparations were done, Zen extended his finger towards the top of the chaos.
<br><br>
"Annihilation Coke!"
<br><br>
Since the Evil God had utilized the Creation Coke to inject vitality into these thunder dragons, Zen had used the Annihilation Coke to lay waste to them.
<br><br>
Through the Annihilation Coke, he constructed countless gray needles that directed themselves towards the thunder dragons.
<br><br>
Each needle was the size of a thumb, and they were no different from the ones used for the purpose of sewing. However, the power contained within these needles was on par with that possessed by the thunder dragons. Once these needles pierced through the bodies of the thunder dragons, they would perish in an instant. With Zen's technique, even the threatening thunder dragons were vulnerable as though they were insignificant obstructions in his path.
<br><br>
"Weak attacks like these are no match for me. The only way we can counter the downgrade is for you to return to my body voluntarily.
<br><br>
Otherwise, we'll all die here, together with all the worlds, and there will be no chance to reverse the situation," Zen spoke in a hushed voice, trying to persuade the Evil God.
<br><br>
Although Zen said those words to the Evil God alone, his voice echoed throughout the chaos and was audible to everyone in it.
<br><br>
Naturally, the people present in the fairy palace and those on the black ship could hear him clearly as though he was speaking to them in person.
<br><br>
"What you have is an opportunity, and what you'll give up will turn into regret!"
<br><br>
With Evil God's hot-headed personality, how could he just give up and let go of this opportunity that lay there in front of him? He scoffed at Zen's words as more thunder dragons descended from the runes and marked Zen as their target.
<br><br>
Zen stood in his spot and constructed just as many needles to counter the incoming thunder dragons, eventually terminating them upon contact.
<br><br>
The repetitive battle of creation and destruction continued on for a steady period.
<br><br>
When Zen kept on releasing the embroidery needles time and again, he felt a strange sensation take over his existence. His eyes flashed as though something was revealed to him. After communicating briefly with Clarence, he changed his course of direction and moved to a different part of the chaos.
<br><br>
"Where do you think you're going? Don't tell me you're trying to escape!"
<br><br>
The Evil God stood stunned at Zen's sudden change of action.
<br><br>
Although he didn't quite understand what was going on in Zen's mind, he pursued him on instinct. As he chased after Zen, his body moved at an untraceable speed, trying to keep up with him. He didn't stop till he reached the edge of the chaos.
<br><br>
Just as Zen stopped in his tracks, he turned to face the Evil God and leaned his back against the inner wall of the chaos. The expression he wore on his face was strangely calm as he kept his gaze fixated on his opponent.
<br><br>
"It's pointless to try and run away from me. You can't escape this place,"
<br><br>
the Evil God sneered as a spiteful smirk stretched across his face.
<br><br>
"I only lead you here to finish you off once and for all," Zen replied, maintaining his calm composure.
<br><br>
As these words escaped Zen's mouth, the Evil God let out a mocking laugh before he glanced at Zen with intrigued eyes. "Finish me off? How interesting! I'm dying to know what kind of method you'll use this time to manage that..."
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had used the method of illusion to devour the Evil God, but it ended in failure. Since the Evil God was familiar with it, it could not be used a second time.
<br><br>
They were on the same level when it came to strength and methods, so no matter what they used, the other could easily neutralize it without a hitch.
<br><br>
"I'll show you right now!"
<br><br>
With a single wave of Zen's hand, all the energy lying dormant in the void was extracted in one fell swoop.
<br><br>
Masses of energy currents were now under the direct control of Zen.
<br><br>
These energy currents manifested themselves into vicious golden dragons that charged their way to surround the Evil God from all directions. These golden dragons were inexplicably large in size, with their number reaching up to a million! "So you plan to use the Creation Coke to kill me? How pathetic!"
<br><br>
With a scornful expression painted across his face, the Evil God prepared himself to use the Annihilation Coke to counter the forthcoming attack.
<br><br>
The confrontation between the two continued. However, during this round, their roles were reversed. Zen was the one on the offense while the Evil God was pitted against him in defense.
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God proceeded to use the Annihilation Coke, his demeanor underwent a drastic switch.
<br><br>
"What's going on?" the Evil God roared in confusion as he stared his hands down before glancing in Zen's direction.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen smirked as he tilted his head and watched the Evil God's frantic state with amusement.
<br><br>
Back then, when Zen was preoccupied with crafting embroidery needles of the Annihilation Coke to clash against the Evil God's thunder dragons, he noticed some tiny holes in the energy.
<br><br>
Apparently, the energy existed in two forms; invisible and visible.
<br><br>
The visible energy consisted of energy bodies like the thunder dragons and the embroidery needles, as well as all the solidified materials of energy. On the contrary, the invisible energy existed in the void, which could be referred to as dark energy. The dark energy flowed in abundance quietly along with the void like water.
<br><br>
When the Evil God used the Creation Coke without pause to create the thunder dragons, he had exhausted the dark energy in the area to a certain extent. As a result, an imbalance of energy distribution formed around this area. Therefore, the surrounding energy was pulled towards here to cover up for the insufficiency.
<br><br>
But the dark energy constantly flowed at a certain speed.
<br><br>
When the speed of the flow wasn't fast enough, a zone devoid of energy would form in the energy depression momentarily.
<br><br>
This place was the real void, where even the dark energy ceased to exist! Although such a "hole" only remained in existence for a short while and would later be evened out by the dark energy in the surroundings, it provided Zen with an opportunity to drive the Evil God into a corner.
<br><br>
Zen had consumed the maximum amount of energy present in the surroundings and created a million golden dragons. He didn't intend to kill the Evil God with these dragons, but he only wanted him to fall into an area without energy, which would then incapacitate him.
<br><br>
Within the boundaries of this void zone, there was no dark energy for the Evil God to use, and the source of the dark energy was completely cut off, rendering him powerless.
<br><br>
Even if the Evil God couldn't make use of the external energy, he still had high reserves of energy stored away in his body. As soon as he realized something was wrong, he immediately employed the spatial transference.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
As a result, the figure of the Evil God began to blur out. Just as he was about to escape from this area, a stable space appeared where he stood.
<br><br>
Bang! Caught off guard from its sudden appearance, he crashed into the square space causing his body to stagger back a few steps. The spatial transference failed as he was interrupted midway.
<br><br>
"Damn it! Once again!"
<br><br>
the Evil God roared as he felt his growing anxiety consume his body and cloud his judgments. Without wasting another moment, he gritted his teeth and employed all of his energy to use the spatial transference a second time.
<br><br>
Boom! The limited strength he had left in him was insufficient to shake the square space.
<br><br>
"Don't even try, as no amount of energy will break you out of there. You won't be able to move from here," Zen said as he slowly descended towards the Evil God with his arms crossed above his chest.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of the flowing energy to deal with the Evil God was a technique even Clarence couldn't think of, but it proved to be effective in the end.
<br><br>
The Evil God hung his head loosely from his neck as a shadow hovered over his face and hid his expressions. He remained silent for a while as he took his time to process the situation. Suddenly, he raised his head, and a mischievous smile stretched across his face as he laughed while staring Zen dead in the eye. "Hahaha! You got me. I'll admit that it is pretty unexpected of you to pull a method like that. You almost managed to defeat me. You've always been the only person I admire for as long as I can remember. However, unfortunately..."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen retorted immediately to ask what he meant.
<br><br>
"Unfortunately for you, I lost a finger..."
<br><br>
the Evil God said with his signature smile overflowing with malice. He raised his hand that was missing his index finger and waved it near Zen's face mockingly. Immediately after, his body collapsed on its own.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in another void of the chaos, an index finger rapidly regenerated and slowly formed human features. Within a few moments, it grew from a finger to a hand, an arm, a body, a head until it evolved into a complete human being with all limbs attached.
<br><br>
Another perfect Evil God was reborn.
<br><br>
Chapter 4323 Retreat He had been chasing after Zen all this time. But just now, he sensed that something was wrong.
<br><br>
Needless to say, his intuition had always been right on the mark. However, he was not entirely sure what kind of finishing move Zen would employ.
<br><br>
During the spatial transference, he secretly broke a finger and threw it into the void. This small action was the one that saved his life.
<br><br>
Soon after, there was a loud buzzing sound.
<br><br>
Just a short distance from him, the space began to ripple like water.
<br><br>
Little by little, Zen emerged from the ripples. He was frowning and his aura was a bit gloomy. He did not have that much time left.
<br><br>
Seeing how pressured Zen was, the Evil God grinned. "It will take a lot more than that for you to kill me."
<br><br>
"All I want is for you to return into my inner world," Zen replied in a slow and deep voice.
<br><br>
Hearing this, the Evil God responded, "Instead of using that powerful skill on me, why don't you just use that on the downgrader? If he loses energy, then the Wall World might stop expanding."
<br><br>
However, Zen shook his head. "It doesn't actually need energy to proceed with the downgrading," he said gravely.
<br><br>
Previously, he asked Clarence that very same question. The latter told him that downgrading could not be stopped no matter what. And the reason was that it was the embodiment of the rules. Therefore, it had nothing to do with energy.
<br><br>
"So, do you still want to continue our fight?" The Evil God looked him straight in the eyes.
<br><br>
With an impassive expression, Zen answered, "If that's your wish, then so be it."
<br><br>
Once again, the endless energy began to flow all around them.
<br><br>
Both of them had the ability to cut the energy flow. Each of them was trying to throw the other into the energy hole.
<br><br>
However, both of them were well-versed with the principle involved.
<br><br>
Hence, they could both avoid it.
<br><br>
Most importantly, they were aware of the threat the energy hole held. The only thing they needed to do was detach some parts of their bodies while the other person was distracted. And quietly, they would place them in every corner of the chaos.
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God removed the Restriction Field, both of them lost the ability to know everything. Therefore, it was very difficult for them to notice these insignificant broken body parts scattered everywhere. How could they be killed? However, this battle of wits did not last long.
<br><br>
The Wall World had already expanded to the size of a hundred Source Worlds in just another five minutes.
<br><br>
Fifteen minutes passed and it had grown to one tenth of the size of the entire chaos.
<br><br>
At the twenty-five minute mark, it was already occupying one-third of the chaos.
<br><br>
It was being downgraded at such an incredibly accelerated speed. It was way beyond the Evil God's and Zen's expectations.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi was severely intoxicated in the fairy palace. With his cultivation base, it was actually impossible for him to get drunk. He deliberately let himself fall into this state.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Rocher, Kincaid, and the others were paying close attention to the chaos. The movements caused by Zen and the Evil God's battle were far too great.
<br><br>
Even though they were on the other end of the chaos, they could still feel the shock waves. If it weren't for the shields of the fairy palace and the black ship, the people inside would have died thousands of times.
<br><br>
"Hey, everyone! Look! Can you see? What on earth is that over there?"
<br><br>
Someone suddenly pointed to the west.
<br><br>
Therefore, everyone looked towards the direction he was pointing. And there, they saw a blue arc. It was approaching at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
The Wall World was supposed to be completely transparent. It was almost like a chunk of ice without any color. In addition to that, it would only manifest a strange shape if something was pressed onto it. When the thirdgrade world was downgraded into the Wall World, it would tear the space apart and crush everything. That was why everyone could see this blue arc. It was the light being released as the space was broken.
<br><br>
"It's the Wall World. It's unbelievably fast!" The Snake Goddess couldn't keep the astonishment in her voice.
<br><br>
Zen had once reminded them that the world was undergoing an irreversible downgrading process. But during that time, the downgraded area was still very small. They always thought that it would take a long time before this happened. Obviously, they did not expect that its speed would be like this.
<br><br>
"So, the moment is finally here. We have nowhere else to escape to." Fuxi was leaning against the wall. He was still very much intoxicated.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess frowned as she stretched out her hand and touched Fuxi on the arm. His drunkenness dissipated right away. Even if they couldn't do anything else to change the situation, she didn't want to hear him say something so depressing.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the blue arc was getting even closer to them. From ten million miles away, it was down to five million miles. After that, it was only a million miles away...
<br><br>
With the current speed at which this arc moved, it would only take a blink of an eye for it to cross a million miles.
<br><br>
"Everyone! Retreat!"
<br><br>
At that moment, they all heard Zen's voice echoing throughout the space.
<br><br>
With that, the fairy palace began to move away.
<br><br>
It flew eastward and maintained a certain distance from the blue arc.
<br><br>
Not far from the fairy palace, the black ship did exactly the same.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven and the others also noticed the blue arc that was rapidly closing in on their location. The former captain immediately took control of the black ship and flew towards the east. However, it seemed like it was too late.
<br><br>
Just as the Wall World was about to hit the black ship, the Evil God suddenly appeared on its deck. After that, the black ship's speed increased significantly. It was able to get away from the Wall World.
<br><br>
"Based on the speed at which the Wall World is currently expanding, we only have about five minutes left," Zen informed everyone.
<br><br>
"To put it simply, we can only live for five more minutes?" Rocher couldn't help but give in to despair.
<br><br>
However, Zen shook his head. "No. I will take you out of the chaos to prevent you from being downgraded," he said calmly.
<br><br>
"How much longer can we hide, Zen?" Mike seemed eager to ask.
<br><br>
Zen calculated the amount of time they had. In all honesty, he said, "I'm afraid it won't be too long. I'm guessing we'll only have six to eight hours left."
<br><br>
The Abstruse Energy World was infinitely larger than the entire chaos.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Wall World was expanding at such a rapid pace. No matter how huge the world was, it would be devoured and downgraded within a short period of time.
<br><br>
When the others heard this answer, their hearts tightened for a bit. Then, it was followed by a sense of peace.
<br><br>
A while ago, they were extremely anxious about how much longer they could live. So now that they had gotten an estimate, the last bit of uneasiness had disappeared. As soon as they knew how much time they still had, they immediately accepted and made peace with it.
<br><br>
"Master Kincaid will die much earlier," Zen said as he looked sadly at Kincaid.
<br><br>
After the chaos was downgraded, the Other Shore would no longer exist.
<br><br>
Therefore, the coordinates of Kincaid on the Other Shore would also be downgraded. He would be gone forever as a Treacherous Being.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Hilario and Dorothy were much luckier. They were living people and didn't have coordinates. They only had to rely on the Descending Rings to descend from the Other Shore. Furthermore, Zen would supply the energy for the Descending Rings.
<br><br>
When Kincaid heard Zen's prediction, he still looked very calm. He turned to Dorothy and tucked her hair behind her ear. "I'm sorry, dear. I'll be going first."
<br><br>
Dorothy sobbed as she hugged Kincaid. "Father!" Her eyes were filled with tears. She couldn't believe this was the end for her father.
<br><br>
"Oh, my dearest! Don't worry, I'll follow you right away!" Itzel's face was full of fear. Nevertheless, she was determined to do so.
<br><br>
Kincaid merely nodded and smiled. There was no trace of sorrow on his face. He considered this as an acceptable ending for his existence.
<br><br>
"Everyone! Let's drink!"
<br><br>
Fuxi took out his wine pot and held it high. They were doomed one way or another. So all they could do now was to drink and celebrate the lives they led.
<br><br>
Rocher was a person who didn't drink alcohol. But when he heard that, he suddenly stood up and walked towards Fuxi. He took the wine pot and drank a big gulp of wine. After that, he silently retreated to one side and sat down cross-legged.
<br><br>
Hilario also walked over and drank from the wine pot.
<br><br>
Afterward, Bromley, Mike, and the others took turns drinking the wine.
<br><br>
Soon after, five minutes had already passed.
<br><br>
The Wall World had already expanded all the way to the edge of the chaos. The fairy palace was also at the edge. With that, Zen raised his hand and struck at the inner wall of the chaos.
<br><br>
They heard a loud booming sound as he did this.
<br><br>
Subsequently, a large hole appeared on the inner wall of the chaos. The fairy palace went straight into the hole and entered the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Most of the people in the fairy palace felt dazed. All they could see were countless light dots in front of them. They couldn't make out anything in their surroundings.
<br><br>
One by one, Zen patted them lightly to help them with the Soul Reincarnation. As a result, they were now able to perceive the Abstruse Energy World clearly in front of them.
<br><br>
Chapter 4324 An Old Friend While the group of people from the chaos had smoothly adapted to the environment of the Abstruse Energy World, the situation for the creatures from the fourth-grade world was completely different.
<br><br>
Kincaid stared at everything around him as tears started to swell in his eyes. The glorious scenes of the Four Spirits Sect in the past kept reappearing in his mind's eyes.
<br><br>
As he let out a deep sigh, his body began to solidify. It gradually crumbled and eventually turned into dust.
<br><br>
Just like what Zen said, after the chaos was downgraded, there was no way for the Other Shore to escape its fate.
<br><br>
Although the human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House had controlled the passageway in order to hide at the highest point, it was only good to delay the inevitable for a few more moments.
<br><br>
In the end, Itzel was able to grip the hands of the Human Spirit King tightly before he turned into a handful of dust.
<br><br>
A surge of emotion became very visible in her eyes. She gently raised her trembling hand and spread out her palm, allowing the ashes to float and be carried by the wind.
<br><br>
According to the rules, after Itzel and Hilario returned to the Abstruse Energy World, they would also be killed off by the power that was left behind by the downgrader.
<br><br>
While they couldn't resist this power, it was just a piece of cake for Zen in his current state.
<br><br>
Thus, when the destructive force rushed towards Itzel and Hilario, Zen released a light film that appeared above the fairy palace and easily resisted it. Then, Hilario asked with a bitter smile, "Zen, can we go to the four holy pillars? I really want to be there for the last time."
<br><br>
The four holy pillars had been the base of operations of the Four Spirits Sect. For countless times, Hilario had dreamed of returning to this place that he had considered as his home. Thus, before everything ended, he requested to see it one more time.
<br><br>
Zen understood how everyone in the fairy palace felt and also wanted to help them realize whatever dreams they had left. Thus, he immediately agreed and said, "Of course."
<br><br>
Whoosh! In an instant, the fairy palace sped up and flew towards the direction of the four pillars.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the black ship also rushed out of the chaos from the other side.
<br><br>
Initially, the Evil God didn't know about the Soul Reincarnation, thus he was a little confused the first time he entered the main world and was enveloped by the stars all over the sky. However, he was still able to react quickly as he controlled all of the energies. In an instant, he learned the Soul Reincarnation and immediately exerted it on himself, Edna, Shera, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and the former captain of the ship.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Duran's coordinates were left behind on the Other Shore. Although he had hidden them very well, it was still no use since the entire Other Shore was already downgraded. With that, he wasn't able to escape his doom.
<br><br>
By the time that the Grandmaster of Heaven and the others realized what was happening, Duran had already been reduced to ashes.
<br><br>
"Darling, where are we going now?" Edna asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>
"I don't know yet," the Evil God answered in an emotionless tone. He was so upset at what was happening. It seemed that nothing turned out according to his plan.
<br><br>
After the entire chaos was downgraded, the Wall World continued to spread at an incredible speed. The forests, mountains, rivers, and even the secondary worlds were all devoured and squeezed into the Wall World.
<br><br>
Everything was turned into a picture of a complete disarray.
<br><br>
Although the fourth-grade world was relatively vast, it was still finite.
<br><br>
There was no use hiding and running aimlessly. This made the Evil God so frustrated. The situation was very pressing, and he still couldn't think of any solution.
<br><br>
Right now, there was no point in fighting Zen, but he also didn't possess the power to kill the downgrader. As time passed, the expansion of the Wall World was just growing rapidly, and it was not reversible.
<br><br>
Everything seemed to point out that this was already a dead end.
<br><br>
"No! There must be a way...
<br><br>
I just need to think and find it!"
<br><br>
As someone who had a lot of pride, the Evil God refused to give up. He had already sacrificed and suffered a lot, so there was no way that he would just surrender without doing anything.
<br><br>
While the Evil God paced back and forth on the deck of the black ship, his hand suddenly felt a cold sensation. As the Evil God turned, he saw that it was Edna who held her by the hand, standing and smiling before him.
<br><br>
"Don't worry too much. I've never seen you like this before, not even when you faced the Creator."
<br><br>
"That's because Zen still has a flaw! He's a softhearted idiot and I know that I could always seize the opportunity to bring him down. But, what's happening right now is different. I can't find any solution to our situation!"
<br><br>
the Evil God said with a frown. He was like a trapped beast in a cage, looking restless and depressed. Shera, the former captain and the Grandmaster of Heaven beside didn't even dare to speak.
<br><br>
Edna remained calm as she said, "Not every problem could be solved.
<br><br>
Maybe it's time to accept that the downgrade is really unavoidable."
<br><br>
While Edna spoke, the Evil God's brain was still racing rapidly. He was calculating and strategizing all kinds of plans. However, when he heard the last part of what she said, his eyes suddenly widened, and his entire body froze.
<br><br>
"It's unavoidable?" The Evil God lowered his head, gritted his teeth, and clenched his fists.
<br><br>
"We can just accept the situation," Edna said with a faint smile. She just didn't want to see the Evil God distressed. In her mind, if they only had a few hours left to exist, she hoped that they could just spend their remaining time happily.
<br><br>
"But I can't!" The Evil God turned and stared at her with an indignant look in his eyes.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the Evil God like this, Edna couldn't help but bite her lips.
<br><br>
She didn't utter another word and just let out a sigh.
<br><br>
In her mind, they were already in a situation that wouldn't matter whether they accepted their death or not.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Wall World was still expanding rapidly throughout the main world. Due to its astonishing speed, the creatures living in the main world could only see an azure arc. Before they could make any scream or realize what was going to hit them, they were already pressed into the Wall World, becoming a mass of flesh and blood that seemed like a bloody piece of abstract art.
<br><br>
All of the villages, tribes, and even cities that were born just recently could not escape the fate of being devoured. In just two hours, the Wall World had already downgraded one-tenth of the main world.
<br><br>
At the same time, the four pillars were still standing on the ground. The four time chains connected each of them, and at the center was the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The huge fairy palace slowly went past the four pillars and approached the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
Then, Hilario quickly jumped out of the fairy palace and stood in the middle of the courtyard with extreme excitement.
<br><br>
"What a pity! I'm the only one who was able to come back. All of my comrades would have no chance to see it again…" As he remembered that all of the members of the Bold Conjecture House had already been annihilated within the Wall World, he felt very bitter.
<br><br>
"I think they'll be glad knowing that at least you were able to return," Zen said as he stood beside him.
<br><br>
"Maybe you're right. It's just a shame that I wouldn't be able to stay here for long."
<br><br>
Zen then turned his head and looked into the distance. He saw a thin blue line, which was like a forest fire that was steadily spreading.
<br><br>
"We can still stay for another hour," Zen said as he estimated the speed of the downgrade.
<br><br>
"I see. I'll be a little selfish and grab it then," Hilario replied with a bitter smile.
<br><br>
After an hour, the Wall World had already downgraded about nine-tenths of the entire area of the main world.
<br><br>
Then, the fairy palace began to rise vertically. Zen's ultimate goal right now was to retreat into the Deep Space.
<br><br>
Previously, Geoffrey had been through the transmission array at the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard to get to the Deep Space. However, there was no need for Zen to do this right now. With his current ability, he could just directly fly up while taking the entire fairy palace.
<br><br>
After entering the Deep Space, Zen had once again released the Soul Reincarnation to the people within the fairy palace, so that they could adapt to the environment of the fifth-grade world.
<br><br>
Then, Geoffrey guided them towards the southwest of the Sky Wheel City. Finally, the fairy palace stopped in front of a huge piece of land.
<br><br>
The arrival of the fairy palace immediately attracted the attention of the members of the Elemental race below. They bellowed and led a whitehaired old human spirit outside to greet them. It was none other than Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Seeing the sudden appearance of the fairy palace, he already had the hunch of who had arrived.
<br><br>
Soon, several figures rushed out of the fairy palace. Elder Xue recognized some of them, one of whom was Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Immediately after, he saw another familiar figure.
<br><br>
"M-master Hilario!"
<br><br>
Elder Xue exclaimed with a trembling voice.
<br><br>
Hilario then strode forward and supported Elder Xue with his hands. "I'm so ashamed!" These were his first words as he saw Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Back then, Hilario had strongly objected to the idea of going to the Deep Space because of the heated debate over the route. However, Elder Xue still stubbornly did what he wanted and proved that his choice was the right one.
<br><br>
Chapter 4325 No Way To Go After Elder Xue sent Geoffrey away, he had been very upset all this time.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, he couldn't return to the main world, which meant he had no chance to meet his friends again.
<br><br>
However, though Elder Xue hoped that Geoffrey would bring someone here, he did not expect that it would be so soon.
<br><br>
"We were both loyal to the Four Spirits Sect but we had a disagreement. Is that something to be ashamed of?" Elder Xue asked as he waved his hand.
<br><br>
A bitter smile spread across Hilario's face. "It was not a mere disagreement. Master Kincaid and I chose a path that was a dead end, and this led to the destruction of the Four Spirits Sect." He looked down at his feet. "How can I just forget this?"
<br><br>
"Let bygones be bygones..." As Elder Xue spoke, he put an arm around Hilario and looked at the people behind him. "Where is our king?"
<br><br>
Hilario's soft smile turned into a frown once again. "He passed away."
<br><br>
"How is that even possible?" Elder Xue asked as his body stiffened.
<br><br>
"You..."
<br><br>
Because Geoffrey successfully brought these people to the Deep Space, everything should have gone smoothly. As a Treacherous Being, Kincaid had no flaws except for his coordinates. Killing him would be no easy task.
<br><br>
Hilario sighed and did not speak a word.
<br><br>
"What happened?" Elder Xue stepped back as he sensed something had gone wrong.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen moved forward and cupped his hands before Elder Xue. "Elder Xue, I'm Zen Luo. Geoffrey is my son."
<br><br>
Though Elder Xue had never seen Zen, he had learned much about him through Geoffrey. It was Zen he'd chosen for the plan and for fusing with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"Sir, you've given me a great fortune but I still failed in the end," Zen said as he still looked down in defeat. He shook his head in shame, not wanting to make any eye contact with Elder Xue.
<br><br>
This was the first time they met each other. Standing before him was the man who changed his life.
<br><br>
Since the page had been burnt, Zen's fate had forever been linked to the entire world. The person responsible for this was Elder Xue, but unfortunately, Elder Xue's plan never followed through.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Elder Xue stretched out his hands and placed them on Zen's head. "As the saying goes, man proposes and fate disposes. You have gone through great trials to inherit the ancestry-level bloodline and save Master Kincaid. You have not failed, son."
<br><br>
"But the world is being destroyed!" Zen said with a bitter smile. He then told Elder Xue what happened after Geoffrey brought back the Heavenly Ring Staff, from the main world to the chaos, and from the end to the downgrading. Once he finished, he fixed his stance and with a calm expression said, "This is all my fault. I'm not here to visit you. In all honesty, I led everyone to escape here."
<br><br>
Elder Xue's eyes widened as he heard Zen's confession. However, he almost immediately relaxed and a smile followed after. "The downgrading cannot be stopped. This is the fate of all living beings. Why must you put it all on yourself?"
<br><br>
"Right," Hilario echoed from behind. "You were not defeated by the downgrading but by the rules. We have no choice but to accept it."
<br><br>
As they discussed, a few members of the Elemental race ran over. They pointed towards one direction and muttered all at the same time in a panic.
<br><br>
As Elder Xue tried to understand what was going on, he looked in the direction they pointed at. Just then, a magnificent blue arc slowly shot up into the sky from the bottom of the space, and massive chunks of rocks eroded as it passed.
<br><br>
"That... That is the expanding Wall World?" asked Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Zen looked at it then turned to him. "Yes. The Wall World is about to expand to this place. Elder Xue, I would like to ask you to enter the fairy palace and go with us."
<br><br>
To his surprise, Elder Xue shook his head and said, "You may leave. I'll stay here."
<br><br>
"Elder Xue, please go with us! You'll be downgraded if you stay here,"
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't help but chip in.
<br><br>
Elder Xue smiled and looked at Geoffrey with kind eyes. "Good boy. I have lived many, many years. It means nothing to me to have more hours or less."
<br><br>
Geoffrey scratched his head. "I guess you're right."
<br><br>
No one even attempted to persuade Elder Xue. They all knew that they'd come to a dead end.
<br><br>
In the fairy palace, all of the people had got rid of their lifespan shackles long ago, but they couldn't seem to shake the shackles of the world.
<br><br>
They returned to the fairy palace and set off on their journey once again.
<br><br>
After the fairy palace left, Elder Xue spoke to the members of the Elemental race.
<br><br>
He asked them to hold a sacrificial ceremony and invited them all to attend.
<br><br>
The members of the Elemental race looked to Elder Xue as a precious, symbolic figure. At the moment they heard his words, they rushed to prepare the ceremony. Not knowing what it was for, they blindly followed his orders merely because he was Elder Xue.
<br><br>
Once the ceremony was prepped and all the members were gathered together, Elder Xue chanted in their language, "The gate of the Heaven is coming soon. It will guide us to the pure land of joy, where there is no pain or dispute, and all living creatures are equal..."
<br><br>
As they heard his words, the creatures gasped and flailed in joy. "Where is the gate of the Heaven?" asked one of them.
<br><br>
"That's it," Elder Xue exclaimed, pointing to the distance.
<br><br>
As if on cue, the blue arc arrived at tremendous speed. The members of the Elemental race were so immersed in the mesmerizing scenery Elder Xue described that it took them a while to realize what came towards them. Before they knew it, they were all mutilated.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Once the Wall World expanded to the Deep Space, its speed increased even more.
<br><br>
A huge part of the ground was destroyed as the Sky Wheel City began to be downgraded. Within only a few minutes, the entire city was completely downgraded.
<br><br>
Afterwards, the broken relics and the ring-shaped sun that hung in the sky of the Deep Space were downgraded as well.
<br><br>
If one looked from afar, the Deep Space resembled a flat cone. Though the downgrader broke many of its parts when it was downgraded before, not much of its cone-like structure had changed.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the fairy palace continued to rise along the axis of the cone.
<br><br>
When it reached its peak, it abruptly stopped.
<br><br>
"We can't seem to go up any further," said Zen.
<br><br>
Everyone looked up to the sky as if on command. Each and every world had a boundary, and the boundary of the Deep Space was hovering about eighty feet above them. It floated there like a translucent layer of gray soil.
<br><br>
This was as far as they could go.
<br><br>
"Dad, what do you think is outside the Deep Space?" Geoffrey asked curiously.
<br><br>
"My son, even Clarence can't seem to answer that," replied Zen with a smile and a nudge to his son's head.
<br><br>
"Then why don't you try to break it?" Geoffrey asked again but this time, with his fists clenched. He also knew that this was almost impossible to do, but he was convinced that they should have a try.
<br><br>
"I guess we can have a go."
<br><br>
But just as Zen finished speaking, a black light rapidly rose from below and then slowed down its pace as it neared the fairy palace. It was the black ship controlled by the Evil God.
<br><br>
This was not a surprise to any of them, for the Evil God was unfamiliar with the main world and the Deep Space. He moved around aimlessly as he was chased by the Wall World, and finally, he found himself at the top of the Deep Space just like everybody else.
<br><br>
Chapter 4326 The Beginning Of The Wall World The black ship slowed down to a stop next to the fairy palace. The Evil God and Zen exchanged a quick glance, their eyes roaming vigilantly.
<br><br>
Despite being cornered, neither of them intended to give up.
<br><br>
"Humph!"
<br><br>
the Evil God snorted. Jumping up from the bow, he landed to the side of the gray soil.
<br><br>
His line of thinking was similar to Geoffrey's. If he couldn't stop the downgrading, the best thing he could do was break past the barrier of the world and escape.
<br><br>
Zen calmly watched the Evil God from the fairy palace.
<br><br>
He was keenly aware that the gray soil was indestructible. Since the Evil God wanted to make a move first, he figured there would be no harm in trying.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Raising his fist in the air, the Evil God threw a mighty punch at the surface of the gray soil.
<br><br>
Bang! A dull sound rang out upon the punch's impact. When the dust cleared, they found a fist-shaped mark was made on the soft gray soil. It seemed that all of the energy contained within the punch had been completely absorbed by the gray soil.
<br><br>
The Evil God couldn't hide his surprise. Confusedly, he eyed the small fist mark. How could such ordinary soil contain that much power? He took a step back.
<br><br>
The surface of his body began to glow as he channeled all the energy in the void to pour into his body. In a matter of seconds, he looked like a human-shaped body of energy.
<br><br>
Erring on the side of caution, Zen distanced the fairy palace away from the Evil God. He wanted to avoid falling into the line of fire.
<br><br>
At the moment, the Evil God had no intention of attacking Zen.
<br><br>
After absorbing a considerable amount of energy, he launched himself into the gray soil, colliding into it violently.
<br><br>
Bang! The sound of the collision was much louder than the previous one, echoing throughout the space.
<br><br>
Under the impact of such a powerful blow, the gray soil once again caved in, but when the Evil God recovered, he found that only a shallow indentation was made on the gray soil.
<br><br>
As Zen watched, his eyes narrowed slightly. "The gray soil... Did it absorb all that energy?"
<br><br>
The rule of infinite energy was that whenever energy in the void was used, it would simply return back to the void. However, this gray soil had actually absorbed all the energy, which meant that a portion of energy in the world was lost! The expression on the Evil God's face was the same as that on Zen's. He too was aware of the rule of infinite energy.
<br><br>
And yet, the gray soil was breaking that very rule.
<br><br>
"It's not what you think." Clarence's voice suddenly echoed in Zen's mind.
<br><br>
"The gray soil can indeed absorb energy, but after a while, it will spit it out again."
<br><br>
"Is there no limit to the energy that can be absorbed by the gray soil?" Zen asked incredulously.
<br><br>
"Remember I said that there was a time I used up ninety-nine percent of the energy to launch an attack in the eighth-grade world? I was attacking the gray soil," Clarence started to say.
<br><br>
"What happened then?" Zen asked eagerly.
<br><br>
Although he could also manipulate energy infinitely now, ninety nine percent of the energy in the whole world was still very terrifying.
<br><br>
"A huge pit with a depth of more than ten miles was created. However, I didn't see the upper limit of the gray soil. Later, as the gray soil slowly repaired itself, the energy was gradually returned," Clarence answered calmly.
<br><br>
Zen's eye twitched.
<br><br>
He couldn't believe what he'd just heard. The shockingly huge impact of ninety-nine percent of energy only caused a ten-mile-deep crater. What exactly was this gray soil in front of him? After the second attempt failed, the Evil God flared his nostrils, still unwilling to give up. Urging the black ship to move backwards, he also called out to Zen, "Retreat a little!"
<br><br>
He was planning to absorb more energy to launch yet another attack, but he didn't want Zen to misconstrue his actions.
<br><br>
This time, however, Zen finally cut in. "It's useless," he said.
<br><br>
"You mean the soil can't be broken?" The Evil God frowned.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "Clarence once used ninety nine percent of the world's energy and caused a pit that ran for around ten miles, but even he couldn't break it."
<br><br>
The Evil God didn't reply.
<br><br>
Instead, he clenched his fists in deep frustration, causing the surrounding space to fluctuate.
<br><br>
He had seen a lot of battles and hardships in his life, yet in the face of this seemingly unremarkable soil, he could do nothing! Bang! Distressed, the Evil God slammed his fist into the gray soil once again.
<br><br>
Falling onto his knees, the Evil God succumbed to despair. Then, Edna quietly approached him from behind and wrapped her arms around him.
<br><br>
"Stop trying," she said softly. "Go back to the ship and accompany me in our last moments."
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes widened. "We are about to die! Aren't you afraid of death?"
<br><br>
"No." Edna smiled at her husband calmly. "It's not a sad thing to die by your side."
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, the Evil God was moved. Instantly, all feelings of despair and regret vanished from his heart.
<br><br>
While he still didn't want to resign himself to his fate, he decided it was time to compromise. He took Edna's delicate hand in his, and they both headed back to the ship.
<br><br>
There, they found the Grandmaster of Heaven, Shera, and the former captain blankly staring at the soil, quietly resigned to their fates.
<br><br>
Even the people in the fairy palace began to bid each other goodbye. They all knew they were about to die, but in the face of death, they remained calm. However, despite being calm, they couldn't avoid the overwhelming feelings of sadness and regret sweeping over them.
<br><br>
Zen's avatars said goodbye to Letitia, Margaret, Lavender, Aura, and the other women. Zen had informed them of the possible consequences before, so even Margaret held her head high when their fears were confirmed.
<br><br>
For the next few moments, a hush fell over the fairy palace and the black ship as they quietly awaited their doom.
<br><br>
In the distance, the blue arc rapidly expanded. Everything along the way, whether it was a huge monster or a speck of dust, whether it was flowing energy or solidified material, was quickly absorbed by the Wall World.
<br><br>
Zen counted backwards silently, 'Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.' Splash! In the blink of an eye, the fairy palace and the black ship were crushed into countless pieces.
<br><br>
Because Zen and the Evil God were a lot more powerful, they lasted a little longer in the midst of the downgrading force. However, eventually, they too succumbed to it and were pressed into the Wall World.
<br><br>
"Hahaha...
<br><br>
The Stellar World, the Grand Lower World, and the Lower Extreme World have all been downgraded! Now, I hereby announce the beginning of the Wall World!"
<br><br>
Now, only the wisp of black light in the center and the downgrader within it maintained their original forms.
<br><br>
Then, the black light also began to be downgraded, slowly sinking into the center of the Wall World.
<br><br>
The materials in the third-grade world had been in a mess before this began, so when they were downgraded, they grew into an even bigger mess. But the black light was different.
<br><br>
After the black light merged into the Wall World, it transformed into a sphere, surrounded by ripples of energy of the same length and width. If one overlooked the Wall World, they would find an exquisite black sun symbol.
<br><br>
Of course, there was no one else in the world to overlook the Wall World.
<br><br>
After the black sun symbol shrank into oblivion, the downgrader emerged and slowly crawled onto the surface of the Wall World.
<br><br>
He looked very strange now, as if he were a monster made up of many fragments, just like the strange sculpture on the totem of an ancient race.
<br><br>
Chapter 4327 The World With Lines The downgrader crawled around for some distance, until he came across some white lines of varying lengths.
<br><br>
Even though he was a downgrader, it was difficult for him to adapt to the form of the second-grade world in such a short time. Even he was a little stunned to see these white lines.
<br><br>
But soon, he realized that these white lines were the ice crystals released by the Evil God before.
<br><br>
These ice crystals still had the attribute of coldness, but after being downgraded, more abilities were unlocked. Now, five or six different types of energy could be released from the ice attribute.
<br><br>
"After all the worlds were downgraded to the second grade, the total area of the entire world was expanded by thirty billion times..."
<br><br>
"Additionally, the number of the energy types has also increased."
<br><br>
"However, this world is too desolate."
<br><br>
"I don't think there will be any more creatures..."
<br><br>
The third-grade world was called the Lower Extreme World, wherein the word "extreme" represented the limit of life.
<br><br>
Supposedly, all living beings could survive if they were downgraded from the high-grade world. But that wasn't the case in the Wall World.
<br><br>
Although the area of the second-grade world had expanded to a terrifying extent, and the types of energy were also more abundant, this world no longer carried the conditions for living beings to survive. Thus, the creatures of the fourth-grade world wouldn't die when they entered the third-grade world, but the creatures of the third-grade world would be crushed to death when they entered the Wall World.
<br><br>
The downgrader sped up, crawling along the surface of the Wall World.
<br><br>
Turning his arm into the shape of a boat paddle, he tried to stand up properly to cover more distance as he crawled.
<br><br>
As he did this, the downgrader noticed some red, pale yellow, white lines ahead of him.
<br><br>
The red lines were blood, the pale yellow lines were flesh, and the white lines were bones. The three different lines were embedded together. These must've been traces from the battle between the Evil God and Zen. After all, parts of their body were constantly devoured by the Wall World during their hand to hand combat.
<br><br>
After the downgrader passed by these floating multicolored lines, he stumbled upon another void. The entire chaos expanded thirty billion-fold, so the distance between the center of the chaos and the end of it had also increased by thirty billion times.
<br><br>
However, the downgrader still managed to close this distance with ease.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Suddenly, a rogue piece of space circled the downgrader, sucking him into it. In a flash, the downgrader had left this void and entered the scope of the former main world. Here, the area was even wider.
<br><br>
As aforementioned, after a world was completely downgraded, the space would expand by thirty billion times. Therefore, a mountain within the main world could contain an entire chaos.
<br><br>
But when the main world was downgraded from a fourth-grade space to a second-grade space, all of the spaces within it turned into the size of the Wall World.
<br><br>
This meant that it had expanded by 0.9 billion trillion times.
<br><br>
After the downgrader entered the main world, he saw that the color of the lines became complicated.
<br><br>
All kinds of long, short, green, brown and gray lines were interconnected.
<br><br>
It was difficult to make out what the lines were previously, so the downgrader could only perceive their energy structures.
<br><br>
Cautiously, he shuttled back and forth, searching to see if there were any living beings.
<br><br>
After a new world unfurled, the creatures that appeared were only accessories in the process of downgrading. While his sole mission was to downgrade, killing these so-called "accessories" was a great pleasure for him.
<br><br>
This kind of pleasure increased day by day, especially in the third-grade world. He even met human beings who were strong enough to defeat him, but in the end, he was always the one who emerged victorious.
<br><br>
However, upon scouring the second-grade world, he was not used to these desolate-looking lines.
<br><br>
Just as he was beginning to grow desperate, he suddenly came across a green line moving in front of him.
<br><br>
"There are creatures!"
<br><br>
the downgrader exclaimed, his heart overjoyed.
<br><br>
He excitedly rushed over towards the seemingly thousands of feet long green line.
<br><br>
However, as he approached, he realized this green line was equivalent to a small worm less than an inch long in the third-grade world.
<br><br>
Even so, the downgrader still approached it cautiously, fearing that he would accidentally destroy this green line.
<br><br>
Since he couldn't use his spiritual sense, it was very difficult to communicate in the Wall World.
<br><br>
The only way to communicate was to manipulate the length of the lines and their colors. Theoretically, this kind of communication was possible, but it was unrealistic to expect a worm-like creature to learn this in so short a time.
<br><br>
After observing it for a while, the downgrader found that the green line was still slowly wriggling in one direction.
<br><br>
"It's so boring to watch a worm crawl," he said in disgust.
<br><br>
The downgrader was a little depressed, but suddenly, Clarence crossed his mind.
<br><br>
'He surely must still be alive!' he thought excitedly.
<br><br>
Then, he abruptly flew in a certain direction, shattering the green line in front of him. If he did that in the third-grade world, it would be equivalent to crushing a worm with a single kick.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, there was a slight movement in the void darkness.
<br><br>
It was as if the fireworks swept across the night sky.
<br><br>
"Wake up.
<br><br>
Zen, wake up!"
<br><br>
This voice rang out in the depths of Zen's soul, but Zen didn't respond at all.
<br><br>
He had fallen into a state of ignorance, so he no longer had any thoughts, no longer cared about external things, and had cut off all the ways of communication.
<br><br>
Nothing mattered anymore.
<br><br>
Zen didn't care about anything.
<br><br>
But suddenly, he felt a little warm.
<br><br>
Then, he saw the sun rising, bringing a dazzling light with it. The ray of light seemed to pierce right into his soul.
<br><br>
The world that Zen perceived now was distorted and constantly changing, like a painting that was splashed with fresh ink.
<br><br>
Then, Zen found himself within the paradise-like fairy palace, and joyful laughter rang out from the high wall. The young Salome was struggling to cross the threshold. When she did, she gave him a warm smile.
<br><br>
"Wake up, father! Stop sleeping...
<br><br>
I don't want to see you get lost!"
<br><br>
Salome exclaimed sweetly. She had a lovely smile, revealing two dimples on her cheeks, but it should be impossible for her to say these words.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" Zen asked confusedly.
<br><br>
Once Zen's attention was successfully caught, the smile on Salome's face disappeared, and she said seriously, "I'm Clarence. I've been calling you.
<br><br>
Why didn't you answer me?"
<br><br>
"I'm already dead," Zen said with some disgust, wrinkling his nose.
<br><br>
"No, you're not!" Clarence exclaimed in annoyance.
<br><br>
Zen still shook his head, trying to resist. "Is this the illusion you created?"
<br><br>
"Well, strictly speaking, this is my memory. I have all the memories that have extended from the perfect land to here. What you see is the reality I have built using my memories!" Clarence explained.
<br><br>
"A reality created by memories?" Zen echoed, in a daze. "Is this really not an illusion?"
<br><br>
"To your cognition, this is the real world," Clarence replied cryptically.
<br><br>
As Clarence was the master of the perfect land, his memories were very special.
<br><br>
Everything in this world was preserved in his memories, which served like trillions of building blocks.
<br><br>
He only needed to place the blocks according to the original positions in his memories, and then the reality would be constructed. Conversely, if he pushed the blocks down and disordered the memory positions, then the real world would be destroyed.
<br><br>
"Then, can you let me stay here for the rest of eternity?" Zen asked sleepily.
<br><br>
"Of course... not!"
<br><br>
Clarence denied Zen firmly.
<br><br>
Then, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and the winds began to howl.
<br><br>
The indestructible fairy palace was shattered into countless pieces.
<br><br>
Salome also dissolved into a small ball of light, which was the form that Clarence had always assumed when he revealed himself to others.
<br><br>
Chapter 4328 The Battle On The Plane The light ball slowly floated towards Zen and merged with his body once more.
<br><br>
Clarence's voice rang from the depths of Zen's soul again. "The reality I gave you is not enough. You have to create your own reality as well."
<br><br>
"Is there any difference?" Zen asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"Of course there is. This could be what I pursue, and also the reason you were born," answered Clarence.
<br><br>
For humans, drinking the first mouthful of milk to fill their empty stomachs after birth was the beginning of their journey to life. From there, they grew step by step in pursuing strength, wealth, love, power, and the desire for immortality.
<br><br>
However, Clarence was born in a perfect land and had everything he needed within his reach. There was nothing worth pursuing to him in neither the higher-grade worlds nor the lower-grade worlds, which drove him to seek the truth instead.
<br><br>
Why did the world exist? What was behind the world and all the things in it? No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find the answers to these seemingly simple questions himself, let alone anyone else.
<br><br>
Although Mastema was on par with him, Mastema had no interest in discussions such as these other than desperately downgrading the world.
<br><br>
Most of the time, Clarence felt quite envious of Mastema. He only focused on the downgrading, giving it his full attention and refusing to think about anything else.
<br><br>
While the world became downgraded little by little, Zen and the Evil God were born as special existences. How could Clarence let go of these two easily? When Zen heard Clarence's words, he couldn't help feeling hopeless. He wanted to bring his family to a stable environment and stay in the fairy palace, but Clarence insisted on forcing him out.
<br><br>
"Can I really create my own reality?" Zen asked hesitantly.
<br><br>
"Sure, I will help you," replied Clarence.
<br><br>
"Fine." Zen heaved out a sigh as he began to pull himself together.
<br><br>
The reality that Clarence mentioned became the greatest motivation for him. He looked forward to meeting his family again. He did not intend to give up even though he only had a glimmer of hope to cling to.
<br><br>
Two dots suddenly appeared in the Wall World. Zen's eyeballs were slowly formed, followed by his whole head, body, and limbs.
<br><br>
Because of the flat form, there was no need to follow the rules of humans in creation. A human body had no advantage in the Wall World, but was, in fact, a burden. Clarence had initially advised Zen to create himself in the form of a beetle or a worm.
<br><br>
With many sets of feet, wings, and eyes, he would certainly gain a great advantage in the Wall World. He could observe better and even move faster.
<br><br>
However, Zen just couldn't accept it. In the end, he still created a human figure but with a rough shape.
<br><br>
After his body had been completed, his eyes began to perceive the light.
<br><br>
What he saw were thin lines in varying colors.
<br><br>
"These thin lines are the only things I can see?" Zen asked as he felt a slight discontent.
<br><br>
"Yes. You can only see the length and brightness of the thin lines; however, you can release your spiritual sense into these thin lines. In this way, you can infer their appearance," Clarence suggested.
<br><br>
Zen tried to do what Clarence had just said.
<br><br>
The spiritual sense could only spread along the surface of the Wall World, but as it had been infused into the thin lines, Zen was able to see what was beyond them.
<br><br>
However, everything in the Deep Space had been downgraded into a mess of various fragments. Even with his spiritual sense, it would still be difficult for him to make out the real shapes of these fragments.
<br><br>
After he walked a short distance on the plane, he noticed a thin gray line.
<br><br>
As usual, Zen released his spiritual sense, but the moment his spiritual sense was infused into the thin gray line, it vanished into thin air. It had actually been absorbed! "This thin gray line!"
<br><br>
He was a little stunned but he immediately came to a conclusion. "This is the unbreakable gray soil. Has it also been downgraded?"
<br><br>
"The gray soil has not and will not be downgraded. What you see is only a section line of it," said Clarence.
<br><br>
The creatures in the lower-grade worlds would never be able to see the complete appearance of the creatures in the higher-grade worlds. If Zen had been born in the second-grade Wall World, he would always see only a thin gray line appearing to block the way. It would be impossible for him to even imagine what the gray soil was.
<br><br>
"Which world does the gray soil belong to anyway?" Zen suddenly asked with his eyebrows furrowed.
<br><br>
"I don't know," Clarence replied.
<br><br>
The gray soil had already gathered at the edge of the perfect land, and no matter how much the world downgraded, it would only stay the same and wouldn't be affected.
<br><br>
As the two of them discussed the second-grade world, two black lines suddenly appeared from the far ends, one from the left and the other from the right. They dashed very fast, closing in together and heading straight for Zen.
<br><br>
"That's a strong aura of energy!" Zen exclaimed as he was shocked.
<br><br>
Although he was not ready to fight in the Wall World, he instinctively retreated as he felt the danger approaching and instantly pushed his spiritual sense forward.
<br><br>
Through his spiritual sense, Zen quickly recognized the shape of the black lines. They formed a huge pair of black scissors, and as their blades chomped, they intended to cut down Zen.
<br><br>
Zen, who was retreating at high speed, had escaped death. However, he saw black lines on his left, right, and back. He had already been trapped by the black scissors.
<br><br>
"Evil God? Is that you?"
<br><br>
Zen used his spiritual sense to communicate in all directions.
<br><br>
Since he wasn't dead, neither was the Evil God. It must be the Evil God who had launched such a powerful attack.
<br><br>
The winner of the previous battle between the two of them could not be decided, so they had stopped fighting since then. Zen didn't have any idea why the Evil God was coming after him again.
<br><br>
Zen didn't get a response. The aura of the black lines was getting stronger and stronger. The scissors were also approaching at a higher speed.
<br><br>
A thought flashed through Zen's mind, and a golden thread began to appear on the surface of his body. It was a golden ring that surrounded him.
<br><br>
After the ring appeared, it quietly expanded outward, forming a much larger ring.
<br><br>
If the Evil God spied in the dark, he would have seen the golden thread instantly smash the scissors.
<br><br>
Although the black scissors were undeniably sharp, they immediately crashed as they touched the golden ring, dispersing their big and small fragments in the air.
<br><br>
Red lines appeared as soon as the scissors were destroyed.
<br><br>
These red lines then moved towards Zen in spiraling motions.
<br><br>
Zen released another golden thread. Wherever the golden thread passed, all the red lines were devoured without a trace.
<br><br>
"Evil God, your attacks are now useless.
<br><br>
The energy in the second-grade Wall World is more fragmented and therefore easier to crack.
<br><br>
Do you hear me?"
<br><br>
Zen released his spiritual sense again to communicate widely. This time, he finally saw the Evil God's figure.
<br><br>
The Evil God had four pairs of eyes on the Wall World, and he could observe up to four directions around him. His body took a circular shape, from which numerous spikes emerged. He resembled a bug with a strange shape.
<br><br>
"So what? Since there's nothing to lose here, why don't we have a good fight?" the Evil God challenged him with his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
"It's true that we really do have nothing to lose, but we can still obtain,"
<br><br>
Zen replied.
<br><br>
"Obtain? Obtain what? The right to live in this shitty world?" the Evil God asked in an arrogant tone.
<br><br>
He was also dissatisfied with the second-grade Wall World. Nothing could be more boring than a world where only lines could be seen! Chapter 4329 The Last Downgrading When the Evil God was in the third-grade world, his state of mind had transformed.
<br><br>
From being a troublemaker, he became a controller. After controlling the Black Ship, a province, and the whole Source World, he began to respect order and even maintain order.
<br><br>
However, when the chaos ended, his Source World was destroyed. He lost everything he owned, including the black ship and his beloved wife. He was left all alone.
<br><br>
Because of this, he began to hate the world again and wanted to destroy it even more.
<br><br>
Because Zen was the only other living creature in the area, the Evil God vented his anger on him.
<br><br>
Swoosh! In an instant, a huge, long, and colorful line appeared.
<br><br>
It was an energy plate, which looked about ten billion miles in length. The energy plate was so gigantic that it looked like an ocean, which could easily drown Zen with its multi-colored energy waves.
<br><br>
Buzz! An octagon-shaped blue energy shield surrounded Zen, blocking the gigantic, powerful energy trying to attack him. While he was dealing with this, he tried to appeal to the Evil God. He said, "What if we can bring back everything we had in the past?"
<br><br>
"That's impossible!" the Evil God replied with frustration.
<br><br>
The colorful energy began to change its hue. Several colors disappeared, leaving behind the red and blue colors. The red and blue energies melted into each other until they became one single color: purple.
<br><br>
Although the ocean of purple energy looked beautiful, it was more destructive. It was destroying Zen's energy shield much more effectively.
<br><br>
Thinking on his feet, Zen quickly changed his energy shield, blocking the purple energy. He was becoming more and more frustrated with the Evil God's attacks, but he still tried to communicate with him.
<br><br>
"No! I mean it.
<br><br>
Clarence is the controller, which means he has all the memories.
<br><br>
If the whole world is restarted, all realities will be realized. The energy and materials will be restored. Everything in the past will reappear!"
<br><br>
Zen screamed through the noise, doing his best to persuade the Evil God.
<br><br>
When he said this, the Evil God began to listen, putting his attacks on Zen on hold. The purple energy calmed down, gently gathering around Zen.
<br><br>
"Then who will make all of this reappear?" the Evil God asked.
<br><br>
"I will," Zen answered with no hesitation.
<br><br>
"By devouring me?"
<br><br>
"Yes."
<br><br>
"No way!"
<br><br>
the Evil God retorted. He never trusted Zen, and Zen never trusted him.
<br><br>
When they were in the third-grade world, they could not put their distrust aside and reconcile their differences. The same happened in the secondgrade world.
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God finished talking, he launched another round of attacks on Zen. The once gentle purple energy began to charge at Zen again.
<br><br>
While this was happening, the downgrader made his move quickly.
<br><br>
The scope of the second-grade world was different from those of the other worlds. The spiritual sense in the second-grade world reached about thirty billion times further than it would in the third-grade world. Even more, the range of movement in the second-grade world was thirty billion times larger than that of the third-grade world.
<br><br>
The downgrader wanted to find Clarence, so he quickly spread out his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
After spatial transference, he released his spiritual sense.
<br><br>
After another spatial transference, he released his spiritual sense for the second time.
<br><br>
In just a short period, the downgrader had already moved far from where he was. His spiritual sense had already swept through a large area.
<br><br>
"Lines, lines, lines...
<br><br>
There are lines everywhere! Eh? The flower blossoming in the fourth-grade world has actually been preserved very well. It's a shame that only I can see and appreciate it," he said to himself.
<br><br>
Even after crossing such a long distance, the downgrader still couldn't find Clarence. He became more and more frustrated.
<br><br>
Buzz! He used the spatial transference again, but only this time, he felt an energy wave back.
<br><br>
Although the energy wave was very weak, it was active. 'Those low-level worms couldn't have released this. That would be impossible, ' the downgrader thought to himself.
<br><br>
"That direction!" He said, going on.
<br><br>
After feeling the small clue, the downgrader used the spatial transference over and over again. Each time he used the spatial transference, he felt the energy wave becoming stronger and stronger.
<br><br>
"Could it be? Could this energy wave be coming from Clarence? If it is, what is he doing? No threat in the second-grade world would need such energy,"
<br><br>
the downgrader said in confusion.
<br><br>
After using the spatial transference hundreds of times, he reached the area where Zen and the Evil God were battling each other.
<br><br>
As he stepped foot within the area, Zen and the Evil God immediately sensed his presence.
<br><br>
Although the downgrader's form had changed a lot, they could still tell it was him by his aura.
<br><br>
Buzz! A thin, purple line appeared in front of the downgrader. He used his spiritual sense to check what it was.
<br><br>
He discovered it was a huge sea of energy. In its center was a humanshaped creature. This only made the downgrader even more confused.
<br><br>
Was this Clarence? Did he morph into a human form? From what the downgrader remembered about Clarence, Clarence didn't like the human form, but the sea of energy was made by him. What was it for? As the downgrader was thinking about this, the space behind him began to fluctuate. After a few seconds, from it appeared a powerful bug with sharp spikes.
<br><br>
"Stay where you are. Don't you even dare move," the bug said through its spiritual sense.
<br><br>
When the downgrader heard the bug's voice, he felt a shiver run up his spine.
<br><br>
The bug was none other than the Evil God! 'How is this even possible? How is he here? Only Clarence and I could survive the Wall World, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
"How... How did you even survive?" the downgrader asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God didn't say anything. Instead, he stabbed his sharp spikes into the downgrader. The spikes' turbulent flames pierced through the downgrader's body, causing an intense burning sensation to spread through it.
<br><br>
The downgrader's body was huge and broad, but in the blink of an eye, it burned into ashes.
<br><br>
When the Evil God was in the third-grade world, he didn't take the downgrader seriously. The same went for the second-grade world. Right after he killed the downgrader, he turned around and continued to attack Zen.
<br><br>
In the Wall World's black light emerged the downgrader, who was able to come out of the Evil God's attack reborn, although ashen.
<br><br>
"I..."
<br><br>
He was furious.
<br><br>
He couldn't accept that the Evil God had escaped his downgrading.
<br><br>
'This is a humiliation! A great humiliation! The Wall World couldn't kill them. What about the World of Nothingness?' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
The first-grade World of Nothingness was very special.
<br><br>
It had everything, but at the same time, it had nothing. Even the downgrader couldn't understand how this worked, but he was sure that the Evil God wouldn't have been able to survive it.
<br><br>
In a burning rage, the downgrader's mental state began to decline.
<br><br>
'Begin to downgrade! In the World of Nothingness, nothing can exist. You are not the exception! You can not survive!' the downgrader thought resentfully.
<br><br>
The Wall World shook gradually until it started to shrink from the edge to the center. The black light in the center of the world transformed into a vortex, pulling everything from the world down to its dark core.
<br><br>
Zen and the Evil God, who were still attacking each other, felt a great traction force, making them pause their fight.
<br><br>
Both Zen and the energy sea became distorted.
<br><br>
He and the Evil God were unable to resist the traction force happening in the Wall World.
<br><br>
"What's happening?" Zen asked worriedly.
<br><br>
"It's Mastema. He's begun a new round of downgrading," Clarence answered.
<br><br>
"A new round of downgrading?" Zen said, stunned by what was happening.
<br><br>
"Yes. Mastema must have been very furious with you two to have done this. This time, we will be entering the World of Nothingness," Clarence continued. "That will be his final destination."
<br><br>
Chapter 4330 The Point Of Origin Once the traction force appeared, the Evil God did not launch another attack on Zen.
<br><br>
He had just killed the downgrader yet again, and he faintly guessed that this traction force somehow originated from the downgrader.
<br><br>
He and Zen stood on the edge of the Wall World, and they passively gravitated towards the center.
<br><br>
What would they find in the interior of the World of Nothingness? Neither Clarence nor Mastema had a clear comprehension of it.
<br><br>
Since the perfect land had been downgraded, the two of them could accurately predict each lower-grade world. To downgrade, he only needed to extract some details from those worlds, and there were some rules to follow. It was by following these rules that the Evil God had successfully restored the energy step by step.
<br><br>
The more details that were extracted, the less would be left.
<br><br>
Very few details remained in the third-grade Lower Extreme World, but at least it could still sustain life.
<br><br>
However, in the Wall World, there were so few details remaining that nothing could live there at all.
<br><br>
According to the rules, the details of the first-grade world had been completely extracted, so it created an absolute void, and it couldn't even accommodate souls. This was why it was called the World of Nothingness.
<br><br>
After hearing Clarence's explanation in his mind, Zen asked, "Can you survive within the World of Nothingness?"
<br><br>
"I don't think so, but the world may not be exactly as I have theorized,"
<br><br>
answered Clarence.
<br><br>
"We'll see soon enough," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
After all, he had already experienced the downgrading once. Staying in the Wall World left him feeling uncomfortable. It might be better to travel to the World of Nothingness.
<br><br>
Compared to the grand way in which the third, fourth, and fifth-grade worlds were downgraded, the downgrading process of the Wall World had occurred in an extremely quiet and peaceful way. After all, there was no sound in this place.
<br><br>
The materials that were placed within the Wall World began to gather and compress, bit by bit.
<br><br>
They were pressed together proportionally.
<br><br>
The distance between Zen and the Evil God was thirty miles. When the distance became shortened by half, the Wall World had also proportionally shrunk by half. The speed at which the Wall World's downgrading happened far exceeded those of the third, fourth, and fifth-grade worlds.
<br><br>
Within five minutes, the distance between Zen and the Evil God shrank to only seven and a half miles. By then, only one fourth of the Wall World was left.
<br><br>
As the materials within the Wall World were pressed together, so were Zen and the Evil God.
<br><br>
Although these materials had been crushed and reduced in size, they still contained strength. To Zen and the Evil God, the strength of ordinary materials was nothing, and naturally it had no effect on the two of them.
<br><br>
However, the downgrading of the Wall World was accelerating, and the speed of its shrinking was also accelerating.
<br><br>
Another five minutes later, only a distance of one hundred and fifty feet was left between Zen and the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Wall World shrank to 1/300th. The materials compressed tightly, but Zen and the Evil God could still easily withstand the pressure.
<br><br>
Another five minutes slipped away.
<br><br>
It had shrunk to 1/30000th its normal size now.
<br><br>
Zen and the Evil God were now in a close proximity to each other.
<br><br>
The Evil God shifted a little, pushing away the tightly squeezed materials that surrounded him, and he moved in the direction of Zen's spikes.
<br><br>
The two of them no longer had any intention of continuing their fight, and they were only hoping that they could finish the last journey with a tacit understanding.
<br><br>
The Wall World had further shrunk to 1/300000th now.
<br><br>
The materials in this world were now densely compressed. The extreme pressure changed the nature of these materials, and the temperature rose rapidly.
<br><br>
"Can you withstand in such a form?" the Evil God suddenly questioned Zen.
<br><br>
Zen replied with an indifferent shrug, "You'd better keep your concern for yourself."
<br><br>
As the pressure increased exponentially, Zen drew on the surrounding energy to fortify himself.
<br><br>
Soon, the Wall World shrank to 1/30000000th, and the pressure increased yet another hundredfold.
<br><br>
Cracks began to form on the surface of Zen's body, from which tiny fragments sifted down, only to instantly melt. The temperature of the Wall World had increased explosively.
<br><br>
Like Zen, the Evil God's body was almost imperceptibly collapsing.
<br><br>
However, given that they had the aid of infinite energy, the two of them were not too concerned about their physical bodies.
<br><br>
Never mind the cracks on their bodies, even if they were reduced to ashes, they could instantly heal themselves.
<br><br>
When the Wall World shank to 1/300000000th, the pressure increased by another factor of ten.
<br><br>
The materials of the Wall World were undergoing a strange change.
<br><br>
Originally, while the properties of these materials had changed, they had still maintained their original colors. Now, all of them had turned a grayish brown, the same uniform color as the gray soil.
<br><br>
Now, Zen and the Evil God were finally entering the area covered by the spiritual sense of the downgrader.
<br><br>
He had been waiting at the center of the Wall World. When he sensed the two of them, he immediately and excitedly projected his spiritual sense, saying, "Finally, you are here. I'm wondering how you will feel when you are crushed into pieces."
<br><br>
"This amount of pressure is hardly enough," replied Zen.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..." The downgrader laughed merrily. "The process of downgrading is the procedure of pressure becoming infinite. I wonder if your infinite energy can resist the infinite pressure. I'll now watch you being crushed bit by bit..."
<br><br>
While he was speaking, a sharpened spike shot towards him.
<br><br>
Even in this world of high pressure and high temperature, the spike could still travel at an incredible velocity, and it instantly impaled the downgrader, who was in the black light.
<br><br>
Bang! The flames loaded within the spike exploded and quickly engulfed the downgrader.
<br><br>
"Ahhh!"
<br><br>
The downgrader let rip with a painful scream. He was killed yet again by the Evil God.
<br><br>
"It's really rare to meet such a loquacious good-for-nothing." As the Evil God responded, he turned around and pointed the next sharpened spike at the black light, ready to slay the reborn downgrader at any time.
<br><br>
Perhaps he feared being killed by the Evil God again, or perhaps he felt afraid of the pain that came before death.
<br><br>
For the first time, the downgrader was silent upon his rebirth. He watched the downgrading process with a muted expression.
<br><br>
The world shrank to 1/3000000000th now.
<br><br>
Under the extreme pressure, Zen's body collapsed from the outside to the inside.
<br><br>
His body couldn't maintain its shape, and it was quickly assimilated into the outside world.
<br><br>
Zen acted quickly, abandoning the outermost layer of his body and creating a slightly smaller body inside.
<br><br>
But as the slightly smaller body couldn't withstand the pressure, he quickly created a third body.
<br><br>
The methods the Evil God used were almost the same as Zen's. The newly created bodies resembled the layers of an onion.
<br><br>
Their bodies were shrinking smaller and smaller, and therefore, the pressure they could withstand was greater and greater.
<br><br>
But this was only a delay tactic.
<br><br>
When the world shrank to 1/30000000000th, the pressure increased another ten times.
<br><br>
The bodies of Zen and the Evil God had both shrunk to the size of a silk bean. Under such immense pressure, they couldn't even release their spiritual senses. The two of them were confined to a space the size of a silk bean, and they struggled to hold on.
<br><br>
The world shrank to 1/300000000000th.
<br><br>
Under this massive pressure, there was no material that could maintain a stable state. All the materials had been transformed into pure energy.
<br><br>
Zen and the Evil God were no exception to this. Their bodies turned into energy, and then they gravitated towards the center of the Wall World.
<br><br>
There existed an unknown point of origin, which was the root of the World of Nothingness.
<br><br>
The point of origin was available to all.
<br><br>
1/3000000000000th.
<br><br>
1/30000000000000th.
<br><br>
1/300000000000000th.
<br><br>
In the end, everything within the Wall World was completely devoured and consumed by the point of origin, including both the black light and the downgrader within it.
<br><br>
Chapter 4331 Split One's body was the carrier of the soul, while the soul was the carrier of the consciousness. If one's body was destroyed, his or her fragile soul would then be exposed to enemy attacks, leading to his or her immediate annihilation. As the soul vanished, so would the consciousness contained in it.
<br><br>
Even if one reached the Holy Soul Realm, the Eternal Realm, or even if they became creatures of the higher-grade worlds, this rule would still apply.
<br><br>
Throughout the entire world, Clarence and Mastema were the only ones who escaped this restriction. Even if their bodies and souls were damaged, their consciousness remained intact. However, right now, Zen and the Evil God had also reached their status and became their equals.
<br><br>
All of them were now at the point of origin, where the concept of space and time did not exist.
<br><br>
Everything had been compressed into an infinitely small point. The pressure was crushing, and no living beings could possibly survive under such harsh circumstances. However, the downgrader was surprised as he discovered that his consciousness still remained.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! I did it! I survived it all! Now, I am the ultimate winner and the only ruler of this world!"
<br><br>
For a while, the downgrader thought that he was the only one who survived.
<br><br>
He was ecstatic as he assumed that he had finally achieved his ultimate goal. He had downgraded the entire world to the World of Nothingness but his consciousness carried on.
<br><br>
With that, he thought that the world was now his belonging, including all substances and energy within it.
<br><br>
At this infinitesimal point, everything felt so crowded, including his own consciousness. He tried to sense his surrounding environment, although technically, the concept of "surroundings" did not exist at the point of origin because everything had been integrated into a single point.
<br><br>
But the moment he sensed his surroundings, he immediately realized that there was a familiar aura near him. In fact, it was attached to him.
<br><br>
"Clarence! Why are you still alive?"
<br><br>
The downgrader was extremely shocked as he recognized that he wasn't alone.
<br><br>
"Why are you so surprised?" Clarence asked calmly as if he already knew all along.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
The downgrader couldn't be more astonished at this turn of events. All this time, he thought that he was the only existence at this narrow point of origin, but it turned out that Clarence had also survived along with him.
<br><br>
Moreover, it was as if the two of them had become a part of a whole.
<br><br>
Furthermore, as the downgrader was still recovering from the shock of finding out that he was actually with Clarence, he suddenly discovered that there were two more auras around them. After carefully sensing where these auras belonged to, he was even more flabbergasted.
<br><br>
"What the hell?! How could this be? Why didn't you die?!"
<br><br>
Zen and the Evil God didn't respond as the downgrader addressed them.
<br><br>
At this point, all four of them had clearly sensed each other's aura.
<br><br>
They found out that the four of them co-existed in this cramped point — the downgrader, Clarence, the Evil God, and Zen.
<br><br>
This was actually a rather abnormal and extremely dangerous situation.
<br><br>
All of them, except the downgrader, had partially realized their coexistence much earlier, but they didn't utter a word. Then, soon after, the downgrader finally recognized the situation they were in.
<br><br>
Clarence had kept quiet for a reason. It was because he began to merge with the downgrader. To be exact, he began to devour the downgrader's consciousness without him realizing it.
<br><br>
The existence of the Source Light in the higher-grade worlds had made it impossible for Clarence to subdue Mastema. However, now that the Source Light had dissipated since everything was reduced to the point of origin, Mastema had just lost his life-saving straw.
<br><br>
The moment Clarence made his move earlier, Zen and the Evil God also followed suit.
<br><br>
They had been on full alert against each other since the beginning. At this infinitesimal point of origin, nobody had any room for retreat. They had no other option but to merge and devour each other in order to prevail. It was crucially important for each of them to dominate this process.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The moment Zen started merging with the Evil God's consciousness, a broad world of memories unfolded in his mind. All of the past memories of the Evil God were completely revealed to him.
<br><br>
From the Evil God's birth in his inner world, to his journey in the Source World, his acquaintance with Shera, his involvement with the Black Ship, and his cruel slaughter on the Other Shore. No detail was spared and nothing remained a secret.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the same thing happened as the Evil God attempted to merge with Zen's consciousness. All of Zen's past experiences were displayed before the Evil God's eyes. The entirety of his long journey from the Eastern Region to the Source World played out like a tremendously long film.
<br><br>
'Damn! There's too many. If I want to fuse with Zen's consciousness and absorb him, I have to take in all of his memories!' the Evil God thought as he began to panic.
<br><br>
'He's also taking in all of my memories.
<br><br>
If he finished more quickly, I would be replaced by him instead!' Deeming a strong sense of urgency within the Evil God's consciousness, he began to go through Zen's memories like crazy.
<br><br>
Obviously, Zen had also realized how he could overcome the Evil God.
<br><br>
He would have to take all of the Evil God's memories as his own, as fast as he could. But when he continued to do so, he was briefly stopped by a surprising fact.
<br><br>
He found out that he already possessed most of the memories from the earlier life of the Evil God.
<br><br>
He even shared some memories of the Evil God exploring the Source World after leaving his inner world. This was because he had once subdued the Evil God after he rebelled against him.
<br><br>
After all, the Evil God was a creature from his inner world, and he was omniscient in everything when it came to it.
<br><br>
In fact, he had once invaded the memories of the Evil God's earlier life so that he would be able to deal with him. Therefore, since he already saw the majority of the Evil God's memories, it didn't take him much time to completely assimilate all of them.
<br><br>
On the other hand, although the Evil God was trying hard to take in Zen's memories, he fell behind quickly because he had never pried into Zen's memories before. Besides, even when they shared the broken Source World as the primitive land, the omniscient power possessed by the Evil God didn't enable him to probe into Zen's mind.
<br><br>
Soon enough, their gap just grew larger with every passing second.
<br><br>
In fact, when the Evil God took in about half of Zen's memories, Zen had almost completely absorbed all of the Evil God's memories.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Evil God felt a sense of loss in his mind. It was as if he began losing his memories. Slowly but steadily, he could no longer recall his past, his loved ones, his formidable power, and finally, even his own self.
<br><br>
"No! This can't be! I won't be defeated! Never!"
<br><br>
As the Evil God began to completely lose his self, his consciousness shook intensely.
<br><br>
He never thought that after all that he had been through, he would lose to Zen this way.
<br><br>
However, he had lost the fight of acquiring memories right from the beginning. No matter how intelligent he was, this was something that he could not overcome by mere strategies.
<br><br>
Anger, resentment, and agony… These were his remaining emotions as his consciousness fleeted little by little.
<br><br>
Then, after a while, his consciousness just suddenly ended as if it never existed.
<br><br>
At the same time, what emerged in place of it was Zen's consciousness.
<br><br>
Right from this moment, he was Zen and also the Evil God. Under the influence of the Evil God's memories, Zen's aura had slightly changed. It was laced with a trace of evil. However, his personality remained the same, it was all Zen.
<br><br>
"Are you done too?" Zen asked Clarence, who was also supposed to be in a battle for memories against the downgrader.
<br><br>
He knew that Clarence and Mastema had also been aggressively devouring each other's consciousness. Earlier, he was still a little doubtful of the possible outcome of their battle. However, as he recalled the process of how he devoured the Evil God's consciousness, he grew confident that Clarence could clearly handle it with ease.
<br><br>
This was because he knew that Clarence had been living in isolation in the perfect land for countless years. Clarence's existence was several times longer compared to that of Mastema. Thus, it would be impossible for Mastema to complete the process before Clarence did.
<br><br>
After a while. Clarence replied in a soft voice, "Mastema, he… He has finally returned to me now. We've become one again."
<br><br>
"That's good to hear then," Zen said gladly.
<br><br>
"I see that you've also overcome him," Clarence remarked as he sensed a trace of the Evil God from Zen's aura.
<br><br>
"Yes. So, what now? Is it necessary for us to merge ourselves too?" Zen asked with a hint of hesitation.
<br><br>
He clearly knew that if they tried to devour each other's consciousness, then he would definitely lose. Compared to Clarence's seemingly infinite span of life, Zen's would look like just a second.
<br><br>
"If I wanted to merge with you, then why would I have to make the perfect land like this?" Clarence said with a positive tone.
<br><br>
He regarded Zen as a solver, thus it was meaningless for him to devour Zen.
<br><br>
"What happens after this?" Zen asked out of curiosity.
<br><br>
"Well, just wait for a while," Clarence replied.
<br><br>
However, at this point, there was no light, no space, nor distance at the point of origin. There was also no concept of time.
<br><br>
So, Zen just fell silent and waited just as Clarence told him.
<br><br>
Since time didn't exist, it was hard to grasp if a lot of time had already passed or if it was just a few seconds.
<br><br>
As they fell silent, it felt like a short moment had passed, but it also felt like it had already been several years.
<br><br>
Then, all of a sudden, Zen sensed a gap appearing before him.
<br><br>
He thought that it should be just an illusion since neither physical body nor soul existed here. Their consciousness was the only thing left. Thus, how could he be physically aware of this gap? For him, it was such an incredible sensation.
<br><br>
"Did you feel it?" This time, he heard that it was Clarence's physical voice that was asking.
<br><br>
"Yes! What is this?" Zen replied.
<br><br>
"It's the point of origin. It is beginning to split," Clarence answered in what seemed like a riddle to Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 4332 The Reality Zen Wanted Clarence had formulated several conjectures regarding the possible changes of the point of origin.
<br><br>
It might never change and continue on forever. In that scenario, the entire world had completely perished while Clarence and Zen remained trapped in an eternal prison.
<br><br>
Another possibility was that the point of origin would turn into the perfect land and restart the thirteenth-grade world. Since the first-grade and the thirteenth-grade worlds shared a common origin, it was highly possible for them to transform into each other.
<br><br>
The third and final possibility Clarence speculated of was that Zen's and the Evil God's existences would bring about new, unexpected changes to the very basic rules of this world.
<br><br>
In the end though, these all remained as speculations since this was the very first time Clarence experienced the downgrade.
<br><br>
However, seeing where things now stood, it seemed his third theory proved correct as the point of origin began to split slowly.
<br><br>
"What will happen next?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Maybe... We will both have a perfect land," Clarence replied.
<br><br>
"You mean the world will completely separate in two?"
<br><br>
"Yes, and you will become another me. Congratulations," Clarence told him with full sincerity.
<br><br>
Instead of elation, Zen felt disappointed, "But you promised to give me a real world!" he growled.
<br><br>
He did not want a perfect land nor did he wish to become the ruler of the world. The only thing he wanted was to restore everything that had been destroyed: his loved ones, his friends, and his family.
<br><br>
"It wouldn't be difficult. I can give you my memories and you will be able to repeat the past," Clarence assured him.
<br><br>
With that, his consciousness suddenly surged towards Zen's and took the initiative to fuse with it! In this fusion, Clarence voluntarily gave up dominance which meant that Zen now would effectively devour a part of his consciousness and have ownership of his memories.
<br><br>
"Why? Why did you do that?" Zen asked in shock.
<br><br>
"Once the point of origin is restored to the perfect land, I will embrace a brand new world. I have no need to restore the past so it would be best to leave my past memories to you," Clarence answered. In truth, he only wanted to remember the general information of the past.
<br><br>
With his reasoning, Zen found no need to say anything more and simply waited for their consciousness to merge completely. During the process, Zen found his knowledge increase exponentially.
<br><br>
Clarence's memories contained the highest level of omniscience: the distribution of any and all energy and substance in the thirteenth-grade world to the first-grade world. Needless to say, it was an infinite quantity of information.
<br><br>
With this, Zen would now be able to restore everything according to the past.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the divided part of Clarence's consciousness completely merged with Zen's.
<br><br>
Further on, the point of origin finally split into two with Zen and Clarence occupying their respective worlds.
<br><br>
Once he assumed control of the point of origin, Zen completely lost contact with Clarence.
<br><br>
The world Zen was in was infinitely small and his consciousness floated silently, alone with no source of sound, light, or feelings. It was at that moment that Zen truly felt lonely.
<br><br>
Bored out of his mind, he then decided to start sifting over Clarence's memories.
<br><br>
Within these memories, Zen was able to lay out every single detail of every single being that ever existed: kings, traitors, dreamers... Their life stories and inner thoughts were shown to him from birth until death, like overly-long movies of which Zen was the only audience.
<br><br>
After scrolling through the memories of tens of thousands of creatures, the point of origin suddenly began to change.
<br><br>
Zen felt it: the sudden disappearance of the infinitely large pressure that once engulfed him.
<br><br>
Soon enough, highly compressed substances and energy began to bounce back and the infinitely small point of origin popped.
<br><br>
It was a silent explosion.
<br><br>
In the midst of the violent surge of energy, there was no sound.
<br><br>
It was in this soundless burst that the space which allowed all substances to exist came into being.
<br><br>
The flow of time resumed.
<br><br>
Light spread out to every corner.
<br><br>
Finally, sound came after such a long period of silence. What was supposed to be a noisy explosion became music to Zen's ears.
<br><br>
Before him was a huge space.
<br><br>
There was nothing in front of him but he did not feel empty, instead, everything felt perfect.
<br><br>
It was indeed the perfect land.
<br><br>
He had already witnessed it once in Clarence's memories and it was exactly as it appeared there.
<br><br>
Everything in this land was constant and would last forever. There would be no more pain, separation, or betrayal. If he rebuilt the fairy palace here then everything would be perfect.
<br><br>
With that, he then began to extract the relevant information from his memories that would enable him to rebuild his perfect world.
<br><br>
Clatter...
<br><br>
Cyan rocks began to materialize into the void as they formed a high wall.
<br><br>
In an instant, the fairy palace had been restored along with the people who lived in it.
<br><br>
Salome's lively giggles, Geoffrey's mischievous yell, and even Letitia's scolding voice — Zen could hear it all.
<br><br>
The familiar warmth and vitality rushed through him before he even entered.
<br><br>
Everything was perfect, simply, truly perfect.
<br><br>
He shaped his body and walked straight into the fairy palace. However, just as he was about to enter its gates, he stopped. For some reason, he found it hard to go inside.
<br><br>
The fairy palace was the same fairy palace from his memories and the people within it were as he remembered them to be. Everything was perfect and eternal in the perfect land.
<br><br>
However, this perfection disgusted him.
<br><br>
This was not the reality he wanted.
<br><br>
"Go."
<br><br>
Zen ordered softly.
<br><br>
And thus, the fairy palace crumbled along with the people within it.
<br><br>
It wasn't just the fairy palace that he wanted to restore but the entire world.
<br><br>
His world wasn't perfect by any means. It was a world where disease, separation, death, and fear existed.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, that was reality and it could never compare to this fake world he was given.
<br><br>
To Zen, everything in the perfect land was just too false and strange.
<br><br>
"This place is too narrow. I have to downgrade it..."
<br><br>
While Zen grumbled, the thirteenth-grade world began to unfold. As it lost a portion of its details, it turned into the twelfth-grade world and the energy was divided into two.
<br><br>
Thus, Zen proceeded with his downgrade and soon the world changed into the eleventh-grade world and the energy quadrupled.
<br><br>
Soon, the world devolved into the tenth-grade world and the energy split into eight.
<br><br>
The ninth-grade world...
<br><br>
The eighth-grade world...
<br><br>
The seventh-grade world...
<br><br>
The sixth-grade world...
<br><br>
The fifth-grade world.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen finally stopped.
<br><br>
He could restore everything at any point. In a sense, he was the controller of time and he had to decide when to restart the past.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, Zen finally made his decision.
<br><br>
Above him was indestructible gray soil. It was here that his family and friends in the fairy palace were forced to bid farewell to each other and meet their ends.
<br><br>
"My memories...
<br><br>
Restore them all."
<br><br>
Under his command, the fairy palace was recreated in an instant.
<br><br>
At this moment, the people within the fairy palace were all geared up to embrace their deaths. All of them suppressed their sadness under a calm and composed facade.
<br><br>
Margaret covered Salome's eyes with her hands, not willing to let her see their doom. With no idea of what was happening, Salome innocently asked her mother what was wrong.
<br><br>
"Nothing. Everything will be fine, sweetheart..." she replied and tried her best to hold back her tears.
<br><br>
"Mother, the blue line is gone," Salome continued as she looked through her mother's fingers with innocent eyes.
<br><br>
Margaret's eyes, which had been shut close from despair, snapped open the moment she heard Salome's words.
<br><br>
True to what her daughter said, the blue line had indeed disappeared and everyone within the fairy palace was completely unharmed. Zen's avatar, however, had disappeared.
<br><br>
"Why? What happened? How did we survive that?" Margaret muttered in confusion.
<br><br>
It wasn't just her. Letitia, Aura, Lavender, and everyone else thought the same thing. They all survived yet Zen's avatars had all disappeared.
<br><br>
In the other side of the fairy palace, Fuxi, Geoffrey, Rocher, and the others had all closed their eyes and awaited death.
<br><br>
After a while though, they realized that the end they had been waiting for never came.
<br><br>
"Is this a miracle? Am I dreaming?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey had been praying with his eyes closed. He had no idea just how they would be able to escape their situation, so all he could do was pray to some higher being for a miracle. In a strange stroke of fate, his prayers were answered.
<br><br>
Chapter 4333 Restore Everything Fuxi, Rocher, Hilario, and the others looked at each other.
<br><br>
It was hard for them to believe that they were still alive.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess' eyes were full of doubt. She looked into the distance and said with a trembling voice, "Has the Wall World disappeared? No, have all the things in the world disappeared?"
<br><br>
The space outside the fairy palace was empty. There was nothing left.
<br><br>
This was not normal. They didn't even think this was possible.
<br><br>
When downgrading happened, it would destroy everything in the physical realm, but its energy and materials would remain. They would not even be lost in the slightest.
<br><br>
But now, even the Wall World had disappeared.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked around and asked, "Where is Zen? Is Zen missing?"
<br><br>
When the others heard her say this, they all quickly began to search for Zen. He, however, was nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
"Wait, is this Zen's theurgy?"
<br><br>
"Did he save the fairy palace?"
<br><br>
"But how could he have done it? That's almost impossible. How could he have stopped the downgrading?"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
They all made their guesses on how Zen disappeared or where Zen had gone, but at the end of the day, they were dumbfounded. They had no true clue where he was.
<br><br>
Buzz! While everyone continued to search for him or speculate on his disappearance, his figure began to condense in the fairy palace.
<br><br>
"Dad!"
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Did you stop the downgrading?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey, Rocher, the Snake Goddess, Mike, and the others ran to him immediately. They had never heard of or encountered a situation like this before. What was happening was truly incomprehensible to them.
<br><br>
Zen looked at them with a trace of warmth flowing from the bottom of his heart. "No, I didn't stop the downgrading. The downgrading has been completed."
<br><br>
"The downgrading has been completed?" Geoffrey looked puzzled. "But how could it have been completed? We're not dead..."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess raised her eyebrows and said, "Zen, have we died already? Have we just managed to come back to life again?"
<br><br>
Zen gave the Snake Goddess a thumbs up. "You're right," he said.
<br><br>
"Are we in the underworld?" Geoffrey asked, his eyes wide open in shock.
<br><br>
Zen reached his hand out and gently stroked Geoffrey's body. When he did this, Geoffrey's tall body shrank back to its normal size. He rubbed Geoffrey's head and smiled. "Son, there is no underworld in this world.
<br><br>
This is a brand new world. I recreated you all with the help of Clarence's memories."
<br><br>
Geoffrey blinked his eyes in disbelief. He quickly looked down at his body. "I was created with memories. Does that mean I'm fake? Am I not the real Geoffrey anymore, Dad?"
<br><br>
"Ha-ha..." Zen laughed, amused by his son's words. The others, however, didn't laugh with him. The truth was they also had the same worry in their hearts. To be fair, Zen also had this worry in him before. He was also afraid he was just in an illusory world.
<br><br>
"Everyone, don't worry," Zen sighed, trying to comfort them. He began to explain it in detail, "When the energy is arranged according to the original pattern, the substance it forms is the same as the past one. This is an absolute reality. If ice melted but condensed back again into ice, wouldn't it still be the ice it was before?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was the first to understand. "Do you mean to say that we did die, but since you have all the memories of the whole world, you were able to restore us using those memories?"
<br><br>
"Yes!" Zen nodded.
<br><br>
"But why is it that you could only restore the fairy palace?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
"Well, that's not true. I can restore everything to its original state with the help of the memories, and I'll do it soon,"
<br><br>
Zen assured them. With a gentle wave of his hand, the black ship, which was not far from the fairy palace, was restored.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven, Shera, the former captain, and Edna were also reborn with it.
<br><br>
"We... We're alive?"
<br><br>
"Why? How?"
<br><br>
"Where is the Evil God?"
<br><br>
The four people on the black ship were also confused. They were all safe, but they were still a bit worried. The Evil God was nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
They saw Zen, but no one dared to ask him.
<br><br>
Edna, however, summoned up all her courage and flew out. At the entrance of the fairy palace, she timidly asked Zen, "Creator, where is the Evil God?"
<br><br>
"The Evil God?" Zen replied, an undetectable expression on his face.
<br><br>
"He's dead."
<br><br>
"What? The Evil God's dead?" She tried to clarify. Zen nodded his head. Her mouth was hung open, and a trace of sadness appeared in her eyes. She spoke to Zen once again, "But why... Why aren't we dead?"
<br><br>
"I created you," answered Zen.
<br><br>
It was difficult for others to understand Zen's creation of realities, but since Edna was born in his inner world, she was well aware of his omnipotent ability. She thought it was normal for him to directly create her.
<br><br>
When she heard this, her eyes lit up with hope. "If you created me and the others, can you create the Evil God?"
<br><br>
"No," Zen said, shutting down Edna's hope immediately.
<br><br>
The Evil God had already comprehended infinite energy. If Zen were to create him, it would bring about endless trouble. Who knew what the Evil God would do? It would be too difficult to deal with him, especially considering he was just as strong as Zen.
<br><br>
As Zen refused her request, Edna's eyelids trembled slightly. She did her best not to cry. Pursing her lips, she nodded and said, "I see. Thank you, Creator."
<br><br>
She turned around, ready to return to the black ship.
<br><br>
Zen thought he would be definite with his decision, but when he looked at Edna, an inexplicable emotion rose in his heart. It felt like a mixture of depression and desperation. It was as if something from within him was begging him to change his mind.
<br><br>
However, even though the emotion came from him, he was not sure if it belonged to him. When the Evil God's consciousness fused with his, their emotions also mixed. The Evil God's emotions could affect Zen's.
<br><br>
The Evil God was begging him to bring him back to life.
<br><br>
Or was he begging himself? Zen shook his head in disagreement but then began to give in. He called out to Edna, smiling bitterly. "Wait," he said.
<br><br>
Edna turned around and stared at Zen in a daze.
<br><br>
"I will create the Evil God, but not for now," said Zen.
<br><br>
It wasn't difficult to erase part of the memories of the Evil God and completely restrict him, but Zen decided to deal with this in the future.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Edna flew into the air and kowtowed three times towards Zen to show her happiness and thankfulness. She then returned to the black ship.
<br><br>
Zen gently waved his hand, signaling to the black ship that he was allowing them to follow the fairy palace.
<br><br>
When the fairy palace and the black ship passed somewhere, the energy hidden in the void would begin to fluctuate.
<br><br>
Zen restored the Deep Space's golden ring-shaped sun. Broken tiles floating in the air, huge broken buildings, and the Sky Wheel City were also restored.
<br><br>
When the fairy palace went down, the huge strata floating in the void had also been restored. The different races living in the Deep Space had also been reborn.
<br><br>
These uncivilized races were not aware of when they died or when they had been reborn. They didn't even know about the downgrading that happened. Their peaceful lives had not been broken.
<br><br>
Among them, the only one who knew about what had happened was Elder Xue.
<br><br>
He calmly waited for his death in the Elemental race's territory and then he was reborn. He was very puzzled by what happened. When he saw the fairy palace coming, he became even more confused. Zen greeted him with a smile before inviting him to hop on board.
<br><br>
"Why? And what happened?" Elder Xue wanted an answer.
<br><br>
"Hilario will give you an answer," Zen replied shortly.
<br><br>
There were still many people and places Zen had to restore. He didn't have the time to explain the situation again and again.
<br><br>
After restoring the Deep Space, he took the fairy palace and the black ship back to the fourth-grade world.
<br><br>
In the empty world, the earth, mountains, rivers, the four pillars, the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and the broken secondary worlds were all restored.
<br><br>
Not long after, the fairy palace and the black ship arrived at the entrance of the chaos. The Human Spirit King Kincaid died there, so he would also be reborn here.
<br><br>
Kincaid's memory stopped the moment he rushed out of the chaos. When he revived, he had an unreadable expression on his face. He did not know how to react. Like before, Zen asked Hilario to explain to him what had happened. After that, he drove the fairy palace into the chaos.
<br><br>
Chapter 4334 The End The chaos remained empty, save for the fairy palace and the black ship.
<br><br>
Restoring a secondary world was a simple matter for Zen, but he needed to maintain order and decide what to revive and what no longer needed to be revived.
<br><br>
"The Pear Hill!"
<br><br>
Splash! Loose earth and rubble gathered back together into boulders and land forms.
<br><br>
Trees and plants sprouted from the soil and grew rapidly.
<br><br>
Buildings rose from the ground until entire cities were made whole again.
<br><br>
The human race, the Snake Goddess race, all manner of creatures, great and small, were resurrected in a flash.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had been destroyed not by the downgrading, but because of the erosion of the Extreme Form energies and the invasion of the Troubled Creatures from the Burial Land.
<br><br>
The newly revived creatures were thus still so gripped by fear of the already vanquished Troubled Creatures that they just milled around warily.
<br><br>
Zen nodded to the Snake Goddess. "It's your turn," he said.
<br><br>
"Okay."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess' eyes lit up. The Pear Hill meant everything to her.
<br><br>
She had been devastated to see it destroyed. But now it had been revived, so had her zest for life.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In a flash, the Snake Goddess stood on the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
"My dear people, the worst is over for the Pear Hill!"
<br><br>
The people in the Pear Hill were unaware of what had happened, but they began to realize that the Troubled Creatures had disappeared. The Snake Goddess' words were the final assurance to put them at ease.
<br><br>
What happened next still left them too dumbfounded to celebrate, however. "Source World, restore!"
<br><br>
Zen had revived the Source World. And the Pear Hill was returned to its original place in it! The inhabitants of the Pear Hill gasped as a blue cover reappeared in the clear sky above them.
<br><br>
"Are we back in the Source World?"
<br><br>
"Oh, my God! I can't believe it!"
<br><br>
"It must be a miracle!"
<br><br>
Zen had chosen to bring everything back to the way it was after the Evil God had killed the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer. The Source World and its countless creatures now continued on with existence as if nothing had changed.
<br><br>
"The divine land, restore!"
<br><br>
"The Ruin Graveyard, restore!"
<br><br>
"The Other Shore, restore!"
<br><br>
"The chaos, restore!"
<br><br>
"The chaotic energy, restore!"
<br><br>
"The six Chaos Ancient Gods, restore!" Zen brought everything back in quick succession.
<br><br>
He recognized that even the chaos and the chaotic energy played an important role in the ecosystem of the world. Zen, however, saw no need to bring back the Burial Land, the downgrader, or the Snake Spirit King.
<br><br>
They were better off in oblivion.
<br><br>
Zen waved his hand, recreating the bodies of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, Ziya, the real Snake Goddess, the real Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Zhurong, Gonggong, and the real Emperor Charm then infusing them with their energy souls. They materialized in the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Then Zen proceeded to bring back Chiyou and the Nine Li race. Even restoring people from different eras like that proved no difficulty for him.
<br><br>
People were shell-shocked upon resurrection. Ziya, for one, clearly remembered dying in the fourth-grade world. Now, he suddenly found himself in the fairy palace. Everyone was caught in a state of bewilderment. It took some time before it finally sank in, and for the joyful revelries to begin.
<br><br>
It was three days before Zen could hold a banquet in the fairy palace.
<br><br>
Nearly a thousand people showed up to join the celebrations.
<br><br>
Among them were Yasamin and Flamine, who busied themselves all throughout dinner playing matchmaker for Zen.
<br><br>
Hence, three months later, a grand wedding banquet was held in the Bloom Divine Province of the Source World.
<br><br>
Dignitaries from the various provinces traveled thousands of miles from across the Source World to attend. Nearly a hundred thousand people witnessed the momentous occasion.
<br><br>
Three years later, Zen had six new children, three boys and three girls.
<br><br>
Life was good and completely at peace for the next three decades.
<br><br>
One day, Zen was at the top of the Deep Space.
<br><br>
He stared thoughtfully at the gray soil before him, hands behind his back.
<br><br>
In the past thirty years, he had studied the gray soil closely. Based on his memories, Clarence had done the same before.
<br><br>
Zen, like any other human, had an infinite desire for knowledge.
<br><br>
He hadn't understood before why Clarence had created Mastema, but now he had.
<br><br>
For Clarence, there was no difference between the World of Nothingness and the perfect land.
<br><br>
If there was no choice or challenge to freedom, it just started to feel like a boundless imprisonment.
<br><br>
In the past thirty years, there had been no limits to what Zen and his loved ones could pursue. However, none of these pursuits made him feel fulfilled.
<br><br>
He spent more and more time on the gray soil, searching for something he could not quite understand.
<br><br>
The search had proved futile so far.
<br><br>
Zen sighed.
<br><br>
He sat cross-legged in the air, hovering in deep thought over the gray soil.
<br><br>
It was then that he noticed a thin black crack over the earth.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened. He floated hurriedly down to the crack.
<br><br>
The crack couldn't have just appeared naturally. The gray soil was rockhard and didn't easily break. As Zen came closer, he realized there was a dark green liquid seeping out of the crack.
<br><br>
Zen reached out his hand. The moment his fingers made contact with the liquid, Clarence's voice rang out in his mind.
<br><br>
"I have left the perfect land, Zen.
<br><br>
I knew you would be curious about the world outside the perfect land eventually, so I left this message for you through the liquid, the only thing that can penetrate the gray soil.
<br><br>
I couldn't find where the black soil ends, but I did find an underground cave of unknown depths.
<br><br>
By the time you receive the message, I would have already left through this secret passage.
<br><br>
If you also ever want to leave the perfect land, the only way out for you is to turn to the Evil God."
<br><br>
The message ended there. The dark green liquid quickly solidified and turned into ashes. The black crack quickly closed and disappeared, as if it had never been there.
<br><br>
Zen mulled over what Clarence had said. "The Evil God, huh?" Zen murmured to himself.
<br><br>
He disappeared from the spot, reappearing the next moment at the hillside of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
In a clearing in the forest stood a simple thatched hut. This had been Edna's residence for the last thirty years.
<br><br>
All this time, she had just been waiting for the Creator to fulfill his promise of reviving the Evil God.
<br><br>
She had never thought to pressure Zen, however. She chose to wait patiently. She could wait for endless years.
<br><br>
Edna was startled to see Zen, but the surprise on her face soon gave way to a faint smile. "Is it time to revive him?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded. "Yes."
<br><br>
"But he's very dangerous," Edna reminded.
<br><br>
"Danger gives meaning to life," Zen replied, with a small shrug.
<br><br>
Energy began to surge in the void.
<br><br>
Substances began to condense.
<br><br>
A body began to take form.
<br><br>
A heart began beating.
<br><br>
The man opened his eyes slowly, a knowing smirk pulling at the corners of  his lips.
