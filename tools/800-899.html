Chapter 3800 The Reborn Evil God Just now, the Three Eyes race was also shocked to see those blood-red balls rushing towards them.
<br><br>
Except for the races that had submitted to the Nihility race, almost none of the other races on the Other Shore were willing to have anything to do with the Nihility race.
<br><br>
The Three Eyes race had been thoroughly petrified, but they could do nothing aside from tensely watching the movements of the blood-red balls.
<br><br>
When the blood-red balls stopped in front of Zen, the members of the Three Eyes race instinctively sighed with relief.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the confusion Egan and the leader of the Three Eyes race had in their hearts grew even heavier.
<br><br>
Even though the opening of the Eternal Scroll Painting was a big day, the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race usually didn't show up.
<br><br>
Now, the Nihility race suddenly appeared, and they actually came for Zen? "Are you Zen?"
<br><br>
Samantha's cold voice came out of the blood-red ball before him. The silhouette of a graceful woman could be vaguely seen in the red ball.
<br><br>
Zen frowned. "Yes, I am. Is something the matter?"
<br><br>
The last time he was in the Creation Myth Temple, Zen suffered a lot in the hands of the Nihility race. The experience didn't leave any good impression of them on his mind, so he naturally wouldn't bother to be courteous with them.
<br><br>
Because they had come straight to him, he knew that their question was just to confirm his identity. They already knew who he was and was just trying to be certain, so Zen just admitted his identity outright.
<br><br>
"Someone wants to see you."
<br><br>
After Samantha finished speaking, her blood-red ball floated to the side.
<br><br>
The blood-red ball behind Samantha's slowly floated forward and stopped in front of Zen. There was vaguely a human silhouette inside the red ball.
<br><br>
Before long, a black-haired man came out of the blood-red ball.
<br><br>
The black-haired man stood with a wicked smile on his face but soon laughed out loud. "Have you ever thought of seeing me here?"
<br><br>
Upon getting a clear look, Zen found that the man was surprisingly the Evil God.
<br><br>
The moment the Evil God appeared, many of the Oneness Sky Palace's Holy Soul Realm warriors standing behind Zen looked like they got hacked by thunders.
<br><br>
Most of them, like Athemar for example, had seen the Evil God before, so they naturally recognized him.
<br><br>
This fellow had been swallowed by Zen, but why was he still alive? Furthermore, how could he become a member of the Nihility race? What baffled them the most was his form. The Evil God's form was different from Zen's when Zen entered the Other Shore with his physical body. His entire features and even the details of his physical body could be seen clearly - he was actually an Other Shore creature! Zen was also baffled. The Evil God's appearance here didn't surprise him.
<br><br>
The Evil God's form, on the other hand, came as a baffling shock for him.
<br><br>
"I've thought that you might become a member of the Nihility race, but I've never expected that you'd have a physical body on the Other Shore..."
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
The Evil God burst into laughter again.
<br><br>
He gently stroked his body with both hands, looking utterly satisfied. "It's more than having a physical body. I've completely become an Other Shore creature!"
<br><br>
"What?" Zen raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>
He thought that the Evil God, just like Elvinia, obtained a new body by chance. If that was indeed the case, his new body was just like an armor that couldn't leave the Other Shore and had nothing to do with his body in the chaos.
<br><br>
However, what the Evil God just said completely shocked him and broke his conjecture.
<br><br>
"If you've become an Other Shore creature, what about your physical body in the Source World?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Logically, after becoming a pure Other Shore creature, one couldn't have another body in the Source World.
<br><br>
If the two bodies existed at the same time, wouldn't there be two Evil Gods when the Evil God of the Other Shore descended to the Source World? "I burned it."
<br><br>
The Evil God calmly said, "I've burned down the Evil God you created. The Evil God standing before you now has gone through a rebirth!"
<br><br>
A few months ago...
<br><br>
Led by Sienna, the Evil God went to a place exclusive for the Nihility race —the Chilling Bone Land.
<br><br>
The Chilling Bone Land was a very strange area. Before the Evil God went in, Sienna warned him that once he entered the Chilling Bone Land, he would transform into another creature and that he wouldn't be able to return to the Source World.
<br><br>
This way, not only could the Evil God get rid of the restraints of the role of Inner-world Generating Avatar, but he would also have an extremely powerful body.
<br><br>
The disadvantage was obvious—he wouldn't be able to return to the Source World unless the Nihility race found a method for him to go there.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Evil God agreed without the slightest hesitation.
<br><br>
Whatever the price was, he was willing to pay as long as he could get free from Zen's control.
<br><br>
Before entering the Land of Bone Tribulation, the Evil God decided to return to the Source World for one last time.
<br><br>
In the Source World, he dug a small tomb for himself, sat upright inside it, and then buried himself with his own hands.
<br><br>
Not long after the Evil God returned to the Other Shore, a wave of violent energy surged in the North Unicorn Province.
<br><br>
If the North Unicorn Province was still in its heyday, many people would be alerted by this phenomenon.
<br><br>
However, after a round of Nine-Sun World Destruction activated in the North Unicorn Province, the entire province had been destroyed and left in ruin. That was why, despite such a terrifying force of truth being released, it completely didn't attract anyone's attention.
<br><br>
Whoosh! That wave of energy flashed past and went straight towards the tomb dug by the Evil God. When the energy reached the tomb, the Evil God's body inside it suddenly combusted. The green flames burned fiercely and quickly turned his body into ashes. However, the flames seemed to be restricted to his body, so the tomb was completely undamaged.
<br><br>
The way the Evil God became an Other Shore creature was completely different from what happened to Elvinia. In her case, she obtained a physical body, which would act as armor for her Soul of Light in special circumstances, so she didn't trigger the Punishment of Truth. What the Chilling Bone Land of the Nihility race did to Evil God, on the other hand, was against the truth. Since it was something forbidden, it would naturally invite punishment from the truth.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the Evil God for a long while before he suddenly shook his head. "You haven't become another person. You're the same Evil God as before."
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" The Evil God frowned.
<br><br>
"Nothing has changed in my inner world," Zen replied shortly.
<br><br>
The Evil God was the incarnation of negative emotions in Zen's inner world. If he had really broken away from Zen and his real body had perished, the negative emotions would definitely return to Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
"So what?" The Evil God shrugged. "At least, I'm free from your control!"
<br><br>
"Only for the time being," retorted Zen.
<br><br>
"You... You are talking nonsense!"
<br><br>
The blue veins on the Evil God's forehead bulged and looked like they were going to explode.
<br><br>
The memories of the past left too deep of an impact on the Evil God. Every time he fought against Zen, he always ended up defeated, something completely unacceptable for the extremely arrogant Evil God.
<br><br>
Realizing that he was losing his composure, he quickly focused himself. He said calmly, "No one knows what will happen in the future. Maybe there will be a way for us to coexist someday!"
<br><br>
Once again, surprise emerged in Zen's gaze.
<br><br>
During the time the Evil God spent with the Nihility race, his personality seemed to have undergone a great change. At least, he was no longer eager to kill Zen the moment he laid eyes on him like before.
<br><br>
"So? What do you want to say to me? You can't be coming all the way here just to tell me about your current situation, right?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"On behalf of the Nihility race, I want to invite you to join us," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God's request caused an uproar among the crowd.
<br><br>
On the one hand, these races of the Other Shore were afraid of the Nihility race. On the other hand, they envied the Other Shore creatures which were favored by the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Since the Nihility race could become another great force that had the power to contend against the Element Spirit Civilization, they naturally had their own unique advantages. For example, they possessed the Chilling Bone Land, which could transform the creatures of the Source World to the Other Shore creatures at any time—something that even the Element Spirit Civilization couldn't achieve.
<br><br>
Chapter 3801 Have Everything You Want The one who controlled the Chilling Bone Land had the privilege of choosing and recruiting talents in the chaos before anyone else.
<br><br>
This privilege was only enjoyed by the Nihility race, though they were always known for being extremely picky.
<br><br>
Those who were selected by the Nihility race were often outstanding warriors with terrifying and unique abilities, or their spokespersons in the chaos.
<br><br>
Expressions of curiosity were plastered over the faces of the Other Shore creatures present.
<br><br>
Who was this Evil God? He was a mere youth who hadn't even reached the Eternal Realm yet. How was he recruited by the Nihility race? To think that he was also asking this other human youth from the Oneness Sky Palace to join the Nihility race! Of course, these things had nothing to do with the Other Shore creatures but they strained their ears to listen out of sheer curiosity.
<br><br>
"From what you know of me, do you think I can be persuaded?" Zen asked as the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile.
<br><br>
The Evil God was born from Zen's inner world and he had been there for a long time so of course he knew him quite well.
<br><br>
In fact, it could be said that he spent most of his life trying to figure out how Zen's mind, as the God of Creation, worked.
<br><br>
Given his extensive knowledge of Zen's personality, the Evil God was quite sure that it was going to be impossible to convince him to join the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Any sort of sweet-talking would only result in disappointment.
<br><br>
The Evil God shook his head. "I know I may not be able to talk you into this, but I know someone who can."
<br><br>
Zen raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued by this sudden ace that his creation held. "Pray tell, who is this person?"
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled and took two steps back. As his toes lightly tapped on the bronze ground, he lay down on the blood-red ball and Zen watched as it slowly wrapped around his body and completely sucked him in.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
After the blood-red ball which carried the Evil God left, the last of the three, blood-red balls slowly floated over.
<br><br>
The first blood-red ball carried Samantha, the second carried the Evil God while the third...
<br><br>
A trace of curiosity glinted in Zen's eyes as he wondered who was within that third ball. Who exactly was this person the Evil God was so confident in? His questions would be answered soon enough. A black figure began to slowly emerge from the ball but when that person appeared, a strange aura permeated everyone's hearts. It felt as if their thoughts were being read and revealed to this newcomer! Every single Eternal Realm warrior from the Violet Cloud race, the Three Eyes race, and all other races revealed extremely shocked expressions.
<br><br>
"He actually returned to Stage Thirty-two in person..."
<br><br>
"It's him!"
<br><br>
"He actually came back for a mere human?"
<br><br>
Everyone was frozen in shock, still trying to find the logic in the situation.
<br><br>
The one that caused all this hubbub was a young man, dressed in a grey overcoat. He had curly hair, and a somewhat sunken, unhealthy face with eyes that revealed a deep melancholy.
<br><br>
He looked every bit an ordinary, if not famished, person.
<br><br>
However, Zen could sense that he was by no means a simple person. There was just something extraordinary about him, that much he was certain.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, Zen knew there was nothing to be afraid of and chose to speak first. "Who are you?"
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The mysterious youth's eyes wandered around before they turned to Zen. "I am the Grandmaster of Heaven and the leader of the Nihility race," he declared.
<br><br>
Zen's body trembled at this sudden announcement.
<br><br>
"Grandmaster of Heaven!"
<br><br>
He knew of this person's existence from the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Shortly after entering the Creation Myth Temple, Zen was privy to various information about him.
<br><br>
This so-called Grandmaster of Heaven had been the Primeval Lord of Heaven's junior fellow disciple and was also a member of the Nihility race...
<br><br>
Of course that was then. Now, he actually introduced himself as the leader of the Nihility race! Some of the Other Shore creatures were also a bit shocked by how the Grandmaster of Heaven introduced himself.
<br><br>
The leader of the Nihility race! That meant he was one of the strongest existences on the entire Other Shore.
<br><br>
What was more amazing was the fact that he personally went back to Stage Thirty-two just to convince this young man, who had yet to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, to join the Nihility race! A trace of embarrassment appeared on Egan's face. "Grandpa, maybe this guy doesn't need me to help him..." he mumbled shyly.
<br><br>
Back in Stage Thirteen's Dark Region, he had already known that Zen wasn't simple.
<br><br>
However, as an Other Shore creature of Stage Thirty-two, Egan still carried an air of arrogance around him and paid his suspicions no mind.
<br><br>
In short, he didn't really take Zen that seriously when he met Zen again.
<br><br>
But now, it was an entirely different matter. To think that the Grandmaster of Heaven himself would show up just because of him? Zen was definitely no ordinary person! "Yes. I didn't expect this," the leader of the Three Eyes race said with a cautious expression He also did not understand how things came to this but since the Grandmaster of Heaven was involved, then this was no simple matter.
<br><br>
After experiencing this short period of shock, Zen quickly collected himself and called for a bit of help inside his mind. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, your junior fellow disciple has appeared."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven rarely mentioned his fellow disciples so Zen did not really know what was between them.
<br><br>
Since the Grandmaster of Heaven had come in person to talk him into joining the Nihility race, he thought it necessary to remind the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
However, the previously talkative Primeval Lord of Heaven remained silent.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven..." Zen called out again. To his dismay, there was no answer.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven smiled at Zen and exuded a gentle and elegant aura. "It'll be useless to call him. He won't come out to see me."
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened in astonishment. "You can hear my thoughts?" he asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
He communicated with the Primeval Lord of Heaven through pure consciousness so there was no way other people would be able to hear their conversations.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven shrugged nonchalantly. "The Grand Plain Stage has suppressed most of my abilities so I can't really read your mind.
<br><br>
Let's just say it was a smart guess on my part."
<br><br>
Zen huffed in disbelief.
<br><br>
"You guessed?"
<br><br>
Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven refused to come out, Zen realized that he would have to deal with this matter on his own.
<br><br>
He had already met with a lot of powerful human warriors these past few months so he wasn't really that nervous in facing off against the Grandmaster of Heaven. Besides, contrary to his grand name, the Grandmaster of Heaven wasn't imposing at all and looked quite approachable.
<br><br>
"I wanted to invite you to our Nihility race. If you join us, you will have everything you could ever want," the Grandmaster of Heaven promised.
<br><br>
"Everything?" Zen repeated skeptically. "Do you know what it is that I want?"
<br><br>
Zen left the divine land for the sake of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
However, after his trip to the Pear Hill, he realized that there were some goals that were still far beyond his reach. The world wasn't as simple as he had first thought and there was the existence of an Other Shore.
<br><br>
It was just as the Snake Goddess said: the most urgent thing was not reviving the Nine Li race, but completing the Finale Way. Because if the chaos was destroyed, nothing could be done.
<br><br>
"Of course I know," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, his deep eyes penetrating deep within Zen's heart. "I can help you rebuild the Nine Li race and restore it to its glory. I can even make your grandfather Chiyou come back to life. I can make all that you want yours, so what do you think?"
<br><br>
If ever the Grandmaster of Heaven followed his promise and revived Chiyou, the one he would revive was the Chiyou of this round of chaos.
<br><br>
Such a feat was not easy, especially since the Nine Li race was a super force. It should also be taken into account that the Nihility race had to face pressure from the Element Spirit race. They truly wanted Zen to join them to have promised such things.
<br><br>
Chapter 3802 Another Invitation If Zen had been promised this when he had just entered the Source World, he would have agreed without hesitation.
<br><br>
Back then he had quite a shallow understanding of the entire chaos and reviving the Nine Li race was all there was on his mind.
<br><br>
But now, his horizons had been broadened and his knowledge expanded, so naturally his goals had changed as well.
<br><br>
"Revive our Nine Li race and bring my grandfather back to life?" Zen replied with a smile. "As far as I know, there isn't much time left in the current round of chaos. So what would be the purpose of me reviving the Nine Li race? It will be destroyed with the ending of the chaos anyway."
<br><br>
The ruling civilizations present all nodded in agreement. When a round of chaos was coming to an end, all within it became meaningless.
<br><br>
All substances would disappear and turn into the most primitive energy of the Great Unity, and all that had happened in the past would be reset.
<br><br>
"Don't get too greedy," the Grandmaster of Heaven continued, trying to persuade him. "Even if the Nine Li race hadn't been annihilated but had existed up to now, they'd eventually be wiped out as well. The arrival of the finale of the chaos is inevitable and irreversible. When it comes time for the finale of the current round of chaos, the countless creatures in this round of chaos will all be doomed."
<br><br>
He was right. Since the moment the chaos had come into being, this process had been repeated without exception.
<br><br>
"What if I can complete the Finale Way?" Zen asked calmly and confidently.
<br><br>
This amused the Grandmaster of Heaven greatly and sent him into a burst of laughter.
<br><br>
Even the members of the Violet Cloud race and other creatures on the Other Shore, burst into laughter from not far off.
<br><br>
"Complete the Finale Way?"
<br><br>
"He dares be so cocky? Even those of the Eternal Realm have all failed to complete the Finale Way."
<br><br>
"Young people like you are always lost in the clouds, dreaming..."
<br><br>
There were a considerable number of ruling civilizations within Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. They all had a great many talents and some of them existed as those who had obtained the luck and resources of the chaos.
<br><br>
They had put a great deal of effort in and had much more experience than Zen in completing the Finale Way.
<br><br>
And yet they had all failed without exception.
<br><br>
Their disdain for Zen was understandable when he began speaking so confidently in spite of all they had done. They all believed, without a shadow of a doubt, that he was overestimating himself.
<br><br>
However, when the members of the Three-eyed race heard Zen's resolute words, their hearts skipped a beat.
<br><br>
These ruling civilizations that had once stood by the Finale Way had all been suppressed for too long. The Three Eyes race had not turned to the Nihility race or the Element Spirit race. They just kept to themselves and this left them in the difficult position of having to defend relentlessly against the pincer attacks of the two major races.
<br><br>
In the beginning, all these civilizations held their faith in the Finale Way, forming alliances with one another as well as the humans in an attempt to thwart the process of the chaos, and help the civilizations in the chaos complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
But since the humans had thinned out, they had been unable to disrupt the forces within the chaos. A long time passed and they had completely given up. The Finale Way became nothing more than an unrealistic hope to them.
<br><br>
Now, Zen's mention of it in public awakened a flicker of their original intent and previous dedication.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was blunt. He had experienced more and knew more than Zen. He said, "You can't. That probability of pulling it off is infinitely close to zero. You'd do much better to seize the opportunity in front of you."
<br><br>
"What sort of opportunity is that?"
<br><br>
As the Grandmaster of Heaven finished speaking, a white ball floated over from afar.
<br><br>
As it came nearer, a female's voice rang through everyone's ears.
<br><br>
When the Other Shore creatures saw the white ball, their expressions abruptly changed. This new presence floating in was from none other than the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Those that had submitted to the Element Spirit race, such as the Violet Cloud race, appeared respectful, intending to welcome the member of the Element Spirit race graciously.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had established the Blood Assembly in Stage Thirty-two, which was jointly ruled by the famous "big ten". This made those races wonder which of the ten masters was on the way.
<br><br>
The white ball approached and when they saw the shape of the flame within it, the color from their faces suddenly drained. The Other Shore races dared not get closer to the white ball for a long while.
<br><br>
Swoosh! By the time the white ball came beside the Grandmaster of Heaven, the flames swirled around it calmly before out of the flames, morphed a perfect body.
<br><br>
It turned out to be none other than Claire, one of the few members of the Element Spirit race capable of coming into contact with the Eye Spirit. She held a status much higher than the so-called "big ten".
<br><br>
"Are you on holiday, Grandmaster of Heaven? I can't imagine how else you'd have the time to come to Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore," Claire asked with a cheeky smile.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven glared at her in silence, holding back his aggravation. He said, "It is none of your business and has nothing to do with you."
<br><br>
"Of course it does,"
<br><br>
Claire argued, turning her head to smile at Zen. She looked at him as if he was an exquisite piece of art.
<br><br>
She twisted her body slightly and came out of the white ball, her flawless face close to Zen's.
<br><br>
She was a fire spirit that would melt any substance that got this close to her.
<br><br>
But by the laws in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, Zen did not feel the tiniest hint of warmth.
<br><br>
"I chose this person before you did. I have sacrificed many lives at his hands in order to see him more clearly," Claire said, smiling devilishly. She looked back at the Grandmaster of Heaven and asked, "How could I now let you take him away from me?"
<br><br>
"You have sacrificed many lives at my hands?" Zen asked in confusion, frowning intensely. "You mean those..."
<br><br>
"Yes," Claire replied, nodding dutifully and looking at Zen with expectation and admiration. "Except for what happened in the Blooming Jade Stage, I arranged all the rest."
<br><br>
When Elizabeth had led Zen into the Blooming Jade Stage, they hadn't taken the usually used paths.
<br><br>
If he had broken into the lower ice field in the Blooming Jade Stage, he would have surely gone through great difficulties before he finally stepped into Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But instead, he passed by the upper ice field and released Pompeo, the bald giant. This caused the Element Spirit race to lose control of the Blooming Jade Stage.
<br><br>
"What was the purpose of all this?" Zen asked, horrified.
<br><br>
"My purpose is the same as the Grandmaster of Heaven's," She said, grinning. "I had to observe you to determine if you'd be a valuable addition to our Element Spirit race."
<br><br>
Claire of the Element Spirit race extended an invitation to Zen as well.
<br><br>
When the Other Shore creatures present heard the news, they burst into an uproar once again.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had control of almost the entire Other Shore. They hadn't even seen the actual Eternal Realm talents as something special, let alone a talent who had not even entered the Eternal Realm yet.
<br><br>
Then why did they try to recruit Zen so openly? Who was this human brat? How could two major races fight for him and dispatch their core figures to recruit him? All those present were utterly confused.
<br><br>
Pearce, Auden and the others stood motionlessly not far away.
<br><br>
They hadn't expected things to pan out this way either and were now a little more nervous; they weren't too sure if Zen would refuse both races.
<br><br>
Chapter 3803 Zen's Choice Zen's mouth corners curved up slightly into a wry smile. "You've engaged in so much trickery. What conclusion have you reached from all your observations?"
<br><br>
"The conclusion is plain as day." The smile on Claire's face slid off her lips, and she became serious in her countenance. "Joining our Element Spirit race is the only path forward for you. I will ensure that you rank above the big ten in standing. Only six members have ever held this level of authority in our Element Spirit race."
<br><br>
Claire's offer shocked the Other Shore creatures present into silence.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had always been an enigma, and their governing structures and divisions of power had always remained unknown to outsiders.
<br><br>
Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who had led the human race against the Element Spirit race for many years, only knew that the leader of the Element Spirit race was called the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
However, the creatures of Stage Thirty-two were well aware of the big ten of the Element Spirit race. After all, all their dealings in the Grand Plain Stage were usually handled by the big ten.
<br><br>
Would they really grant Zen a standing above the big ten if he were to join the Element Spirit race? This was an impossible thing to consider, and shock echoed in the hearts of many Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
Some of the weaker Other Shore races rarely had the opportunity to witness one of the big ten even if they joined the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
In local terms, only the Eternal Realm masters of the major forces were qualified to attend the Blood Assembly. It was not hard to envision the true power and status of the big ten then.
<br><br>
'Is she speaking nonsense?' 'What qualifies this human to be so valued?' 'She must be kidding...' Most of these Other Shore creatures were considering these and other thoughts in their minds.
<br><br>
Although they disbelieved Claire's offer, they only dared to think so and would not risk speaking it aloud.
<br><br>
"After the Purge Way is successfully concluded, I will give you three hundred places among the survivors. If you desire more, you are welcome to ask for more," added Claire.
<br><br>
It was the plan of the Element Spirit race to delay the end of this round of chaos indefinitely.
<br><br>
However, the only way to delay the end was to restrict the expansion of the chaos.
<br><br>
To put it plainly, the plan was to purge all but ten thousand living creatures from the chaos, while destroying the rest.
<br><br>
Therefore, each of the ten thousand places for the survivors would be precious and highly sought after.
<br><br>
If the Purge Way were really carried out, the value of three hundred places among the survivors was priceless.
<br><br>
With that knowledge, Claire still promised Zen three hundred places among the survivors without hesitation and might even give him more if he wanted. This was a sign of her sincerity.
<br><br>
"Three hundred places among the survivors..." Zen momentarily considered and gently shook his head. "That's not sufficient for me."
<br><br>
"How many do you demand then?" Claire asked as her eyes widened slightly in surprise.
<br><br>
"Nothing less than ten billion will suffice, I think," Zen replied, shrugging his shoulders. He wanted everyone in the divine land to survive. Ten billion was probably still not enough.
<br><br>
"Wait, ten billion is an impossible number because the degree of chaos will exceed our control," Claire answered earnestly as she pondered over Zen's demand. On second thoughts, she realized that Zen was pulling the wool over her eyes, and she immediately became enraged. "You!"
<br><br>
"I won't be joining any of you. I don't approve of the paths you have chosen," Zen said nonchalantly as he stared at Claire's angry face impassively. "During my early days in the Source World, Master Athemar had disclosed the three paths of the future to me!"
<br><br>
He suddenly raised his chin and announced in a thunderous voice, "The Purge Way is nothing more than a cowardly compromise. What is bound to come will inevitably come. You will murder everyone else in order to survive. What's the point of this? The Nihility Way smacks even more of a madman's balderdash. Those guys only want to drag everyone else to hell with them!" Zen continued, "I don't know why the needle would descend to end the chaos, but just because it exists, we have no reason to stop fighting against it! I know that there are many other ruling civilizations present who have fought for the Finale Way, and I believe that this is the true and just cause. As for the Purge Way and the Nihility Way, those are nothing but the paths of evil!"
<br><br>
"You are a shameless upstart to dare make such remarks! You haven't even reached the Eternal Realm. What gives you the right to run your mouth like that here?" Elder Howe of the Violet Cloud race snarled at Zen.
<br><br>
Howe was highly offended by the tempting offer that Claire had tried to seduce Zen with, and he was even more shocked that Zen had refused her without hesitation. It was simply inconceivable! He denounced Zen at this moment because he believed it was an opportunity to curry favor with Claire.
<br><br>
"Great speech, young human! If the Element Spirit race hadn't interfered with our efforts over the years, the Finale Way would have already succeeded. The Element Spirit race is to be blamed for the repeated failure of the Finale Way! They sabotaged our efforts!"
<br><br>
Following Howe, another Other Shore creature also stepped forward to speak his piece and take a stand.
<br><br>
This thin creature was from the Swallow Victory race. Like the Three Eyes race, the Swallow Victory race was not a mighty race, but they were well enough equipped to protect themselves at least.
<br><br>
There were actually several Other Shore races like them in Stage Thirtytwo. They had all failed dismally at any attempt to complete the Finale Way.
<br><br>
"Young man, you are bold and courageous. Perhaps you will be the one who achieves the Finale Way!" The leader of the Three Eyes race also spoke up for Zen.
<br><br>
"We won't yield as long as even the last shred of hope still remains..."
<br><br>
"I agree..."
<br><br>
The Other Shore races who had supported the Finale Way in the past all now elected to back Zen's play. Emboldened, they were even prepared to face down Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven, and they didn't hesitate to declare their support for Zen.
<br><br>
The faces of Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven both darkened as the scene unfolded.
<br><br>
With the fall of the human civilization, these Other Shore races had also disintegrated. By necessity, the independent races like the Three Eyes race and the Swallow Victory race had all been forced to maintain low profiles because they lacked the ability to oppose the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race! However, if they were to unite under one banner, they would become such a powerful force that it could not be underestimated! Pearce and Auden were astounded by this sudden turn of events. They had never expected that Zen's words would actually manage to illicit support from so many Other Shore races. This sort of thing was simply unfathomable to them.
<br><br>
"All of you, shut up!"
<br><br>
Claire abruptly roared in anger.
<br><br>
Her voice was so loud that it almost flashed like lightning through the air of the entire Grand Plain Stage. The power contained within the sound wave spread out in all directions like a living entity, flowing uninterrupted as if it was water. Her formidable strength was obvious.
<br><br>
"That's a terrifying energy flow!"
<br><br>
Zen's expression changed slightly when he witnessed the surging energy.
<br><br>
If not for the protection mechanism of the Grand Plain Stage, the roar alone would have crushed a vast majority of the creatures present into powder.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures were all shocked by this display of energy, and they immediately tumbled into silence. However, despite this the Grandmaster of Heaven still appeared calm.
<br><br>
Claire's anger was momentary, and a smile quickly appeared on her face again as she turned back to Zen.
<br><br>
She would stay on her determined course of action, and besides that, she had already reached consensus with the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
Zen's refusal had humiliated her, but she still wouldn't relent.
<br><br>
"That's fine," said Claire, taking two steps back with her hands behind her back. "I won't try to twist your arm in persuasion, but, in the end, I believe you will change your mind."
<br><br>
Chapter 3804 On The Eternal Scroll Painting With a loud sizzle, a terrifying flame suddenly rose from Claire's slender body, burning her to ashes. .
<br><br>
The scarlet flames floating in the white ball was her real body.
<br><br>
The moment she turned into a ball of flames, a cold voice rang out yet again. "Grandmaster of Heaven, I advise you to give up."
<br><br>
"Just a word from you and you expect me to give up?" The Grandmaster of Heaven remained stoic. "Even if the Eye Spirit came to me in person, he has no right to force me to give up."
<br><br>
"If the Eye Spirit were to come to you in person, he wouldn't stop until he killed you," Claire added.
<br><br>
Over the years, the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race had fought quite fiercely both openly and secretly. The Nihility race hadn't declined, but had instead become stronger with each passing day. But overall, the Element Spirit race still held an absolute advantage.
<br><br>
If the Element Spirit race really wanted to fight the Nihility race to death, they would most likely find themselves in a situation similar to what the human race had been in back then.
<br><br>
The human race had once grown so powerful that they had become a threat to the Element Spirit race. But although the Element Spirit race had suffered a heavy blow, they had finally won. They had eliminated most of the humans, and trapped the outstanding human heroes on Stage Thirtythree.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Nihility race hadn't existed at the time. If it had, the Element Spirit race wouldn't have dared attack the human race at such great cost. After all, the fight between any of the two races would work as an advantage of the third one. No one would have dared do such a stupid thing.
<br><br>
This situation was somewhat similar to that of the past. The sudden rise of the Nihility race had already threatened the status of the Element Spirit race. If the Element Spirit race fought despite the risk of suffering heavy blows, they might succeed in eliminating the Nihility race.
<br><br>
There was no third great force that would profit from their fight. The Other Shore races that still stuck to the Finale Way weren't a threat in any way.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had a psychological advantage over the Nihility race.
<br><br>
But the Grandmaster of Heaven was mighty.
<br><br>
He had led the Nihility race from strength to strength.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven remained stoic in the face of these threats. He replied calmly, "Then let's fight till death."
<br><br>
There was grit and determination in the simple reply.
<br><br>
Claire didn't say anything. The flames in the white ball trembled but she had already left.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven stared at Zen.
<br><br>
He was also a very smart man. Zen's words made it clear that he believed in the Finale Way, and there was no question of changing his mind.
<br><br>
It would be meaningless for the Grandmaster of Heaven to stay here and persuade Zen to join the Nihility race. He had to find another way.
<br><br>
"Some ideas will change with time," the Grandmaster of Heaven said slowly and then dived into the red ball.
<br><br>
The three blood-red balls flew towards another direction.
<br><br>
Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven had left, but the shock that they had caused still lingered.
<br><br>
The final exchange between the powerful warriors of the two races had shocked the Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
Were the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race preparing to fight to death in order to win Zen over? It was a well-known fact that the two biggest races on the Other Shore had been fighting openly and secretly for nearly four hundred chaotic eras. But both sides were scrupulous and had never come to a stage where they had to fight to death.
<br><br>
And now their confrontation had escalated just because of a human boy who hadn't even reached the Eternal Realm yet? What did it mean? It probably meant that there was a reason why they thought Zen was worthy enough that they needed to fight until death.
<br><br>
What was the reason though? The collective interest of the Other Shore creatures in Zen was piqued.
<br><br>
Even Pearce, Auden, and the others from the Oneness Sky Palace were confused.
<br><br>
They knew that Zen was important to the Oneness Sky Palace, but not to the point that two races were willing to fight for him! "Primeval Lord of Heaven, what's going on?" Zen asked, confused and helpless.
<br><br>
The attitude that these two great races held towards him was beyond Zen's comprehension. He wanted an answer from the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had been silent from the very beginning. He seemed to want to avoid the Grandmaster of Heaven for some reason.
<br><br>
And now that the Grandmaster of Heaven had left, the Primeval Lord of Heaven returned to normal. He said slowly, as if he was mulling over his words, "Perhaps it's because of the eighteen imprints you've obtained."
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures of Stage Thirty-two didn't know that Zen had obtained eighteen imprints, but the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire probably knew about it.
<br><br>
"Because of these imprints?" Zen said, even more confused. It wasn't a very convincing reason.
<br><br>
"As far as I know, the more imprints one has, the better they could handle everything in the Eternal Scroll Painting. But back then, it was unclear whether the eighteen imprints would cause other problems. Now that so many years have passed, many things might have happened that I do not know about."
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven knew a lot about the world but he had been trapped on Stage Thirty-three for a long time. He didn't know anything about what had transpired in the past many chaotic eras. According to him, the problem was still in the eighteen imprints.
<br><br>
Everyone was absorbed in guesswork when the edge of the scroll painting in the sky suddenly became coated in a layer of gold.
<br><br>
The scroll painting hanging in the sky of the Grand Plain Stage revealed many different colors which slowly took shape and turned into silhouettes of different Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A circle soon appeared in the Eternal Scroll Painting. It rotated slowly and before long, a long colorful ribbon had emerged from it. It twisted and turned into a huge vortex, filling the entire Eternal Scroll Painting. The scene presented was magnificently eye-catching.
<br><br>
"Vortex!"
<br><br>
Of late, whenever Zen saw a vortex, he could not help but think of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"Yes, it is connecting to some part of the Abstruse Energy World," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, confirming his thoughts.
<br><br>
As the vortex continued to fluctuate, the silhouettes that had shown up began to line up in an orderly fashion within the vortex.
<br><br>
The vortex was made up of hundreds of circles of different sizes. The silhouette of the Other Shore creature that was in the innermost circle looked like a single ball.
<br><br>
This ball was likely a member of the Nihility race or the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had once mentioned that the Eye Spirit of the Element Spirit race was ranked first in the Eternal Scroll Painting. This ball was probably the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
A spider like creature was ranked second. The Primeval Lord of Heaven explained to Zen that it was a spider spirit from the Star Spider Civilization in the 96th round of chaos. Its silhouette had been left on the Eternal Scroll Painting, but its real body had already perished on Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
"Can such a powerful existence that ranked second in the Eternal Scroll Painting die in Stage Thirty-three?" Zen was surprised.
<br><br>
"The closer one is to the top ranks in the Eternal Scroll Painting, the more outstanding blood power one will be able to obtain. But these rankings don't represent their full strength," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. "The Grandmaster of Heaven never managed to enter the first four circles, but he still became the leader of the Nihility race."
<br><br>
Chapter 3805 Pressed While there were many ways to determine the strength of an Eternal Realm master, the Eternal Scroll Painting was the most crucial aspect.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was so powerful not only because he had obtained a unique bloodline power, but also because of what he obtained in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
One could say that within the entire Other Shore, the thirty-two stages had many separate spaces, while Stage Thirty-three was a completely different world.
<br><br>
That was the dome of the entire chaos, and it could even lead to the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"The scroll painting has already been unfolded!"
<br><br>
"Everyone, get ready!"
<br><br>
"Put your Heavy Stones into the Three Purities Stones."
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures that had already put their souls and bodies into the Three Purities Stones all pulled out their Light Stones to create white vortexes on the ground. Through these, they entered their own worlds of Three Purities Stones.
<br><br>
Zen followed suit, putting the Heavy Stone into the round hole at the center of the Three Purities Stone.
<br><br>
After the Heavy Stone was positioned inside, magnificent, complex textures began appearing on the surface of the Three Purities Stone. The textures looked like the red-hot iron, converging toward the Heavy Stone in the middle.
<br><br>
As the textures gathered, the Heavy Stone was ignited, turning into a bright red ball.
<br><br>
With that, Zen sat at the last corner of the Three Purities Stone, waiting quietly for it to help him enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
While many other creatures were busy entering the Eternal Scroll Painting, the Swallow Victory race, the Three-eyed race, and the other small Other Shore races all sent people to gather around Pearce.
<br><br>
"Sir, would you happen to be Elder Pearce from the Oneness Sky Palace? And is this Elder Auden?"
<br><br>
"I'm Florian of the Swallow Victory race."
<br><br>
"Can you tell me where Eastern Emperor Taiyi of the Oneness Sky Palace is?"
<br><br>
In the past, the Other Shore races didn't think much of the Souls of Light of Pearce and his companions, but now they managed to pay a visit together and treat him with some reverence.
<br><br>
Both Pearce and Auden felt rather flattered.
<br><br>
The purpose of their visit was simple—they wanted to know Zen's identity.
<br><br>
To do so, they even revealed their utmost willingness to support him.
<br><br>
It was something that would have been almost unimaginable in the past.
<br><br>
Back then, when Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Snake Goddess, and the others tried uniting with the Other Shore races in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, all the races refused them.
<br><br>
The Other Shore races had once tried their best to complete the Finale Way but to no avail. After they failed in the end, they chose to stay in a small world within Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, satisfied with managing their small territories.
<br><br>
It wasn't that they weren't willing to fight back, nor that they were scared.
<br><br>
Both the bad end of the human race and some Other Shore races had served as a lesson for them.
<br><br>
But today, the attitudes of the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire offered them a glimmer of hope. Coupled with Zen's attitude, these Other Shore races felt they should gain a better understanding of the situation.
<br><br>
Of course, these Other Shore races didn't make such a big deal out of it.
<br><br>
Instead of showing up themselves, the leaders of the various races sent their members here.
<br><br>
The Other Shore races remained under the pressure of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Pearce, of course, was unwilling to let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. While explaining Zen's origins, he also made some remarks to praise the warrior.
<br><br>
Many Eternal Realm warriors remained within these Other Shore races. If they could gather, they'd form a great force as well.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...
<br><br>
At this moment, a ray of straight golden light suddenly shot out from the Three Purities Stone, shooting rapidly into the painting.
<br><br>
The first ray of golden light shot out, followed by the second ray, then the third ray...
<br><br>
The golden light was formed from the Heavy Stone embedded within the Three Purities Stone. The moment the light entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, it sent the Other Shore creature into the painting.
<br><br>
Zen was sitting in a corner of the Three Purities Stone. As the Heavy Stone grew brighter, the surrounding space began vibrating.
<br><br>
A great gravitational force pulled Zen's body upward.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The moment Zen entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, it was as though he crashed into a solid wall at high speed. Or rather, he was hit by some sort of irresistible force.
<br><br>
Regardless of how strong his physical body was, the power was unbearable.
<br><br>
His entire body was pressed into a thin piece which was then imprinted onto the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
And it was at this moment that Zen finally understood why the people on the Eternal Scroll Painting were all silhouettes.
<br><br>
As it turned out, they were also forcibly pressed onto the painting, becoming as thin as paper.
<br><br>
Normally, this meant anyone's death.
<br><br>
Even a soul that was squeezed to this extreme would dissipate.
<br><br>
But in this situation, Zen's own consciousness and his physical body's perception were complete. His movements, however, were rather strange.
<br><br>
Whenever he tried moving his hands, his feet moved at the same time, and vice versa.
<br><br>
His body was then crawling horizontally on the Eternal Scroll Painting like a crab.
<br><br>
While he could move, Zen was a little morose.
<br><br>
He felt as if he had changed into a creature of a completely different form.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, is this Eternal Scroll Painting turning us into a picture?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"You should have seen that before you entered the scroll painting." The Primeval Lord of Heaven had long anticipated Zen's reaction.
<br><br>
"What's the point of this?"
<br><br>
Both the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation were built to strengthen the warriors through trainings.
<br><br>
Was it necessary to turn the warriors into the painting for them to reach the Eternal Realm and become Eternal Warriors? "The point?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven took a moment of thought before continuing, "Perhaps this is another way to enter the Abstruse Energy World."
<br><br>
Apart from the Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore and the cave in the Deleting Space, there was no other way to enter the Abstruse Energy World, let alone the transmission method.
<br><br>
But if warriors obtained their own bloodline theurgy in the Eternal Scroll Painting, it indicated that they had already left the chaos. It might be a different means of transmission, but the warriors had to be pressed flat beforehand.
<br><br>
Of course, the Instant Civilization wasn't going to do anything meaningless —the Primeval Lord of Heaven's conjecture was valid.
<br><br>
After hearing the Primeval Lord of Heaven's words, Zen attempted to nod when he realized he couldn't complete the movement.
<br><br>
It took a while to get used to it, and then he managed to move his hands and feet at the same time. He wasn't moving too slowly, but as he crawled along the Eternal Scroll Painting, he saw something slender approaching him from the distance.
<br><br>
It was like an arrow, rapidly sweeping past Zen.
<br><br>
After it was out of sight, Zen realized it was a member of the Violet Cloud race.
<br><br>
"That's unfair!"
<br><br>
Zen shouted.
<br><br>
The Violet Cloud members' bodies were suited to moving in this form, so they naturally ended up far faster than Zen.
<br><br>
"You haven't seen the members of the Element Spirit race. You're going to find it even more unfair when you do," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven, shrugging his shoulders nonchalantly.
<br><br>
The bodies of the Element Spirits were ball-like. After being crushed, they remained in the same form, able to move freely within the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Chapter 3806 The Beasts In The Eternal Scroll Painting There was never such a thing as fair in the world.
<br><br>
Every creature had its unique form and its advantages in a specific environment. For example, a fish could swim freely in water, but it would die on land.
<br><br>
Now, it was clear that humans didn't have any advantages with their forms in the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
This was evident when Zen had no choice but to move awkwardly like a crab.
<br><br>
From the outside, the Eternal Scroll Painting looked like a single piece of paper, but in fact, it was three pages.
<br><br>
Furthermore, all the pages weren't as blank as they seemed. In reality, there were many beasts inside them.
<br><br>
There were many speculations about the origin of the beasts in the scroll painting. Some people said that the beasts in the scroll painting were creatures from the Abstruse Energy World, but the Eternal Scroll Painting turned out to be more habitable for them. Others said that the Instant Civilization created the beasts in the scroll painting.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, they were all simply assumptions.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before Zen encountered a beast after he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
The beast looked similar to the silhouette of an Other Shore creature. It wasn't that big, and it looked like a small wolf that was no taller than a human's leg.
<br><br>
The second he saw the beast, it quickly pounced on him.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures and Zen could only do limited things within the Eternal Scroll Painting. It truly felt like they were embedded in a painting, as their movements were restricted. On the other hand, the beasts in the scroll painting had more freedom.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen chose to counterattack directly.
<br><br>
However, the whole battle was simpler and more boring than he had imagined.
<br><br>
Zen immediately swung down the second the beast approached him.
<br><br>
Although the movement felt awkward, he was still able to grab its leg accurately. At the same time, he twisted his other hand and tore the leg in half.
<br><br>
The whole process went by quietly as if a peaceful scene silently played out before his eyes.
<br><br>
The mangled beast turned into wisps of black smoke and swiftly gathered towards his body, then completely fused with him.
<br><br>
When all of the smoke had merged with him, his whole body trembled violently.
<br><br>
At the same time, a wisp of black smoke flew out of the Eternal Scroll Painting and fell from the sky, then headed straight towards his Three Purities Stone.
<br><br>
After that, a black mark appeared on the intricate pattern on the stone's surface. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, how many beasts do I need to kill before I can go to the second page?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
There was an important condition that one had to fulfill before they could go to the second page, and that was to absorb enough beasts in the scroll painting.
<br><br>
"I can't say exactly," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. "The beasts on the first page aren't too powerful, and the black smoke you can absorb from them isn't much. If you only kill beasts of that size, then you need to kill about four thousand to five thousand of them," he explained.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, there were only a limited number of beasts every time the Eternal Scroll Painting opened.
<br><br>
Therefore, those Other Shore creatures were in a hurry because they wanted to kill enough beasts in the shortest time possible.
<br><br>
"Four to five thousand... That's a lot," he sighed.
<br><br>
He couldn't help but feel a little helpless.
<br><br>
It wasn't hard to kill the beasts in the scroll painting, but the problem was that there seemed to be very few of them.
<br><br>
Those who didn't kill enough beasts in the scroll painting couldn't advance to the second page. Furthermore, when the Eternal Scroll Painting closed, those who couldn't enter the second page would naturally be expelled, which meant they had failed.
<br><br>
Yet, the price of failure in the Eternal Scroll Painting wasn't too heavy. The "Heavy Stone" would simply be destroyed afterward.
<br><br>
Besides, if even the Oneness Sky Palace wouldn't have a hard time obtaining a few Heavy Stones, then the Other Shore races could get more.
<br><br>
That was why all the Other Shore creatures that had obtained the Holy Souls and the Myriad Tribulations Bodies successfully entered the Eternal Scroll Painting. As a result, the competition in the Eternal Scroll Painting became more intense.
<br><br>
Of course, the Eternal Scroll Painting was not a safe place. Many people died inside it every time it opened.
<br><br>
Some of them died because the beasts in the scroll painting had killed them, but most of them died in each other's hands.
<br><br>
After Zen had killed the beast, he traversed through the Eternal Scroll Painting like a crab once more.
<br><br>
But he couldn't even tell his position because of his limited vision. He just moved in one direction.
<br><br>
Moreover, he had been having bad luck. He only encountered a few beasts along the way, and most of them were quite thin and small.
<br><br>
Despite that, he didn't let go of any of them.
<br><br>
Overall, he only came across eight beasts in more than two hours. One of them was a snake-shaped beast, which had even escaped. He chased it for a long time but eventually had to give up in the end.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, many Other Shore creatures on the bronze ground observed the Three Purities Stones on the ground.
<br><br>
When the Eternal Scroll Painting had opened, it showed the silhouettes of the masters at the Eternal Realm. That was the scene on the third page.
<br><br>
Since Zen and the others were still on the first page, their movements naturally couldn't be observed.
<br><br>
Every time the creatures from the Other Shore killed a beast in the scroll painting, however, a black streak of ink dropped from the scroll painting and left a mark on the Three Purities Stone.
<br><br>
Every time the bronze ground was refreshed, one could see the progress of the warriors in the Eternal Scroll Painting through observing the Three Purities Stones.
<br><br>
Most of the Other Shore races only cared about their own warriors' Three Purities Stones. This time, however, a lot of the Other Shore creatures were focused on Zen's Three Purities Stone, whether intentionally or unintentionally. It didn't matter if it were the Other Shore races that surrendered to the Element Spirit race or races that were neutral like the Three Eyes race; all of them quietly observed Zen.
<br><br>
Usually, anyone who caught the attention of Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven supposedly performed well in the Eternal Scroll Painting, and it shouldn't be hard for them to reach the Eternal Realm on their first attempt.
<br><br>
However, more than two hours had passed, but there were only very few marks of ink on Zen's Three Purities Stone! "That human guy doesn't seem to have any extraordinary abilities."
<br><br>
"Over two hours have passed, but he has only killed a few beasts in the scroll painting?"
<br><br>
"If he continues like that, he'll soon be eliminated…"
<br><br>
Some creatures chattered among themselves in low voices, but Pearce, Auden, and the others from the Oneness Sky Palace still heard them.
<br><br>
"What is Zen doing?" Pearce asked. Auden shook his head.
<br><br>
"Maybe luck is not on his side today. I heard that the beasts in the scroll painting appear at random," he said.
<br><br>
All the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace who were present were at the Holy Soul Realm, so they couldn't enter the Eternal Scroll Painting and had no idea what might have happened inside.
<br><br>
"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."
<br><br>
Just then, wisps of black smoke emerged continuously from the Eternal Scroll Painting and quickly descended towards their direction.
<br><br>
Pearce and the others immediately perked up when they saw the streaks of ink. 'Have they finally come?' they asked in their hearts.
<br><br>
A smile graced Auden's face as well. He knew Zen would never let them down.
<br><br>
But as the streaks of ink continued to fall, they went towards a Three Purities Stone nearby, which belonged to Walden of the Violet Cloud race.
<br><br>
The members of the Violet Cloud race knew what the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace were thinking, and they felt disdain because of it. One of them even sneered, "I was wondering what kind of extraordinary being he was, but he's a loser after all. Now he wants to challenge our Violet Cloud race? Could he even enter the second page? Even if he did, he would only end up dead!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3807 A Smiling Face And A Crying Face The members of the Three Eyes race and the Swallow Victory race who stood nearby also saw Zen's Three Purities Stone.
<br><br>
Their facial expressions changed subtly as well.
<br><br>
They thought that Zen would amaze everyone with his outstanding performance in the Eternal Scroll Painting, and that was how things were supposed to go.
<br><br>
To their great surprise, his performance was by no means outstanding.
<br><br>
Instead, his journey in the Eternal Scroll Painting was fruitless until now.
<br><br>
For instance, the Three Eyes race had a total of three members who entered the Eternal Scroll Painting this time. One of them was the three-eyed boy, Egan, who performed the best, while even the one who did the worst among the three of them did much better than Zen.
<br><br>
Still, they didn't believe that the Grandmaster of Heaven would be wrong about his evaluation of Zen. They thought that the reason behind Zen's poor performance was probably because it was his first time to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
In any case, it wouldn't be a big deal if Zen couldn't get to enter the Eternal Realm this time anyway.
<br><br>
Most of these Other Shore creatures in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore had failed several times. Even the mighty warriors who were already at the Eternal Realm had also entered the Eternal Scroll Painting multiple times, and some of them a dozen or even a hundred times before.
<br><br>
But because of Claire's and the Grandmaster of Heaven's perception of Zen, everyone began to hold high expectations of him and believed that he would pass the Eternal Scroll Painting in one attempt. They had never imagined that he would've performed so clumsily.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen moved leisurely inside the painting.
<br><br>
Although he didn't know how the others fared, he knew that he had killed far too few beasts in more than two hours.
<br><br>
However, it wasn't his fault since only a few beasts had appeared around him.
<br><br>
"Eh, that is..."
<br><br>
Just then, he suddenly saw a dark thing rolling not far away. It wasn't until he got closer to it that he realized it was quite a big beast.
<br><br>
He felt slightly happy to see the beast. It seemed that he wasn't that unlucky after all.
<br><br>
The moment he quickly approached the beast, however, three Other Shore creatures from another direction rushed towards it.
<br><br>
The three Other Shore creatures moved aggressively. Two of them pinned the beast down on both sides, while the other stabbed it.
<br><br>
The dead beast turned into wisps of black smoke and quickly gathered around the Other Shore creature that killed it.
<br><br>
It wasn't after they killed the beast that they noticed Zen, who stood not far away.
<br><br>
"Is that the human brat?"
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! He seems to have killed only a few beasts..."
<br><br>
"I thought he was a big shot, but he isn't even qualified to enter the second page! He doesn't deserve any attention."
<br><br>
Even though everyone turned into a flat picture, their voices were still transmitted in their original forms. Furthermore, the space allowed them to hear everything clearly.
<br><br>
The more beasts they killed, the more black smoke wrapped around their bodies.
<br><br>
Dense black smoke surrounded these three Other Shore creatures' bodies.
<br><br>
On the contrary, only a small cloud of black smoke enveloped Zen.
<br><br>
It was hard for those Other Shore creatures not to envy him back then when both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race invited him at the same time, especially when he wasn't even an Other Shore creature. He came from the chaos, but he could freely enter and leave the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After they mocked him for a bit, they immediately left.
<br><br>
Everyone was currently in a hurry to hunt the beasts, and no one wanted to waste their time.
<br><br>
As soon as they left, Zen helplessly rolled his eyes. Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven could not help but sigh quietly at his supposedly bad luck.
<br><br>
It wasn't that hard to pass through the first page of the Eternal Scroll Painting, and the beasts appeared at random positions. Even if someone was really unlucky, they should still be able to catch more than a few.
<br><br>
Therefore, neither Zen nor the Primeval Lord of Heaven thought that it was not because of bad luck that he hadn't encountered many beasts.
<br><br>
Every time he moved towards an area with a beast, the beast would mysteriously disappear or move to another place.
<br><br>
The same thing happened repeatedly for more than two hours.
<br><br>
No matter how fast he traveled, most of the beasts had avoided him on time.
<br><br>
However, he couldn't see what happened from his point of view. He could only blame it on his bad luck.
<br><br>
At that moment, a huge smiling face floated above the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
The face was also a picture, but it left the Eternal Scroll Painting and floated in a special space.
<br><br>
"He seems to be a little impatient," the smiling face said softly.
<br><br>
When the voice came through, however, the smiling face quickly turned into a crying face and the voice became rough.
<br><br>
"Do we begin to guide him now?" the voice asked gruffly.
<br><br>
"Let's wait a little longer. There are too many ants that have flocked into the scroll painting this time.
<br><br>
I want to kill some of them," the soft voice came back as the face smiled.
<br><br>
"Will they find out?" the crying face asked.
<br><br>
"Do you think they don't know we exist? Those cunning men aren't capable enough, so they just want to make us help them. They're really dreaming,"
<br><br>
the smiling face snorted coldly.
<br><br>
"Then let's do something about it right now!"
<br><br>
At that point, the crying face stopped worrying anymore.
<br><br>
On the other hand, a big black hand that held a slender ink brush appeared in the special space.
<br><br>
The hand gently drew on the Eternal Scroll Painting. Then a vivid beast came to life.
<br><br>
This beast was much bigger than those that appeared before. Its face looked ferocious with its evil fangs, and sharp thorns covered its whole body. It wasn't like the beasts that couldn't defend themselves from the warriors.
<br><br>
This beast was called the Worm Tapir. It was quite rare to find, even on the second page. Furthermore, the creatures on the Other Shore always tried their best to avoid it.
<br><br>
There was once a time that an Other Shore race killed a Worm Tapir but at the price of nearly forty members' lives.
<br><br>
As the slender ink brush continued to draw, more Worm Tapirs appeared on the scroll painting one by one.
<br><br>
Not long after, more than a hundred Worm Tapirs filled the scroll painting.
<br><br>
"Go and eliminate at least more than half of them," the crying face ordered.
<br><br>
In turn, the newly created Worm Tapirs immediately scattered everywhere like spilled ink and looked for their prey.
<br><br>
The competition among the Other Shore creatures on the first page was extremely fierce. Every time the Eternal Scroll Painting opened, only onethird of the creatures were allowed to enter the second page, so that every beast mattered.
<br><br>
Four Other Shore creatures worked together and just killed a group of beasts in the upper left corner of the Eternal Scroll Painting. Just as they were about to hunt for more, a black shadow suddenly appeared nearby.
<br><br>
They got excited as soon as they saw the black shadow and decided to capture it. However, one of them felt that something was wrong. A chill ran down his spine when he saw how the beast looked like.
<br><br>
"That's a Worm Tapir! Run!"
<br><br>
The Other Shore creature who saw the beast had once been to the second page, where he saw a powerful Worm Tapir with his own eyes.
<br><br>
He was confused, though. Why did a Worm Tapir appear on the first page? Of course, he had no time to know the answer.
<br><br>
Once the Worm Tapir had targeted its prey, its body became erratic.
<br><br>
Then, it appeared and disappeared from time to time.
<br><br>
The Worm Tapir was also a picture, but unlike the Other Shore creatures who became pictures, it could leave the Eternal Scroll Painting for a short period.
<br><br>
The second it jumped out of the Eternal Scroll Painting, it looked like it had disappeared when viewed from the painting.
<br><br>
When the Worm Tapir fell back onto the Eternal Scroll Painting, it appeared again.
<br><br>
While the scene played out repeatedly, the Worm Tapir tore the four Other Shore creatures into pieces. Black ink, which turned out to be those four Other Shore creatures' blood, gushed out from their mutilated limbs and flowed across the white painting.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The moment those dots formed, the Other Shore creatures standing under the painting felt a sense of cautiousness creep under their skin.
<br><br>
They all knew that once a dot appeared, it could only mean that someone had died. However, they couldn't discern who it was or which race it came from.
<br><br>
With the forming of the dots came an uneasy sense of foreboding. It had been less than four hours since the warriors had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, and a death rarely ever occurred on the first page.
<br><br>
As everyone stared at the dots intently, a sudden ray of blood light erupted from each one.
<br><br>
Woosh! Woosh! Woosh! Woosh! They all watched as the four beams of light headed to the north, illuminating four Three Purities Stones.
<br><br>
Standing beside the stones were members of the Dull Blood race.
<br><br>
The Dull Blood race was well known within Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. Their expressions darkened when they realized what the rays of blood light meant.
<br><br>
Those warriors that had died were incredibly talented, all trained by the Dull Blood race. It was nearly incomprehensible that they had died in less than four hours after entering the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"What on earth could have happened in the Eternal Scroll Painting?"
<br><br>
"They should be on the first page. Why?"
<br><br>
Their questions went unanswered.
<br><br>
Those of the Dull Blood race were struggling with the feelings of sadness and puzzlement while the other races of the Other Shore felt a keen sense of relief. It didn't matter what happened in the Eternal Scroll Painting as long as the dead were not of their own race.
<br><br>
An overwhelming amount of Worm Tapirs had been released into the Eternal Scroll Painting though, so how could the other Other Shore creatures be spared the same fate? It was not long after the first four deaths that two more blood dots marred the surface of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
As they watched the circles form, their hearts rose to their throats, choking them.
<br><br>
"What is going on in there?"
<br><br>
"Since when was the first page of the Eternal Scroll Painting this dangerous?"
<br><br>
"I can't believe it! Another two people have died..."
<br><br>
They all watched with bated breath as the rays of light fell over another race on the Other Shore. Each face of the Other Shore race turned sullen.
<br><br>
"It had to be an accident!"
<br><br>
"Dying on the first page may be rare, but it has happened throughout history..."
<br><br>
"They're just unlucky. That's all!"
<br><br>
Throughout history, very few had died on the first page of the Eternal Scroll Painting. And if anyone happened to die then, it was maybe one or two.
<br><br>
However, this time was proving to be incredibly different.
<br><br>
As they watched the painting with rapt attention, dozens of blood dots began to rapidly appear. Most of the Other Shore creatures thought that this must be a mistake.
<br><br>
After realizing it was not a hoax, the entire bronze ground fell into a deafening silence.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures looked up to the sky with impossibly wide eyes, their mouths flapping open and closed as if trying to speak but no sound came out. This occurrence was so unexpected and crazy that no one knew what to think or say. Something terrible had happened on the first page.
<br><br>
The newly formed blood dots hummed softly.
<br><br>
Dozens of rays of blood light burst from the newly formed dots in haphazard patterns. When a beam of light touched a Three Purities Stone, they all knew it meant that the Other Shore creature represented by the stone had died.
<br><br>
There was an odd sound of disbelief that echoed through the silence. "How could this be?" Pearce asked, his voice wobbly with anxiety.
<br><br>
"Will Zen be all right?" Auden asked in a much calmer tone.
<br><br>
"Look! A ray of blood light is coming!" Libby suddenly pointed to the sky.
<br><br>
The beam of light from the Eternal Scroll Painting was barreling towards them. As they watched the light, the hearts of those of the Oneness Sky Palace skipped a beat.
<br><br>
They could hear the humming of the ray as if a swarm of insects were hovering around their heads.
<br><br>
At the last second, the light deviated slightly and landed on a Three Purities Stone not too far away from them. That particular stone represented a member of the Violet Cloud race.
<br><br>
When they realized the light was not for Zen, the Oneness Sky Palace breathed a collective sigh of relief.
<br><br>
The death had not been Zen.
<br><br>
Opposite of the Oneness Sky Palace's relief, the members of the Violet Cloud race felt heavy with their comrade's death.
<br><br>
There had been six from the Violet Cloud race to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting. Aside from Walden, the dead member was another who had been most likely to enter the Eternal Realm. Their sadness for the member was almost all consuming.
<br><br>
Once the rays of light had found their stones, the creatures of the Other Shore returned their gazes to the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
So many had perished in a single breath on the first page, so they could only assume the remaining creatures were having just as difficult of a time.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, their thoughts were proven correct.
<br><br>
After a brief reprieve, nearly a hundred blood dots began to litter the painting.
<br><br>
When the blood light began to fall from the dots, a brilliant flash of white light burst across the bronze ground in the distance.
<br><br>
When the relief sculptures on the bronze ground were renewed again, the Other Shore creatures shifted their gazes to the Three Purities Stones of the warriors who had had their lives taken.
<br><br>
The bodies that were anchored to these Three Purities Stones had been torn to shreds and scattered all over the ground.
<br><br>
Despite the Eternal Scroll Painting already being disfigured by a bloody storm, the Other Shore creatures still within it were calm.
<br><br>
The canvas of the painting was immense, and because the Other Shore creatures within it had turned into pictures on the Eternal Scroll Painting, their vision was quite limited. They could only see a bit far ahead of them, so they had no idea how many had actually met their end.
<br><br>
Zen found himself at a relatively remote position, so he was able to avoid the Worm Tapirs with relative ease.
<br><br>
As he glanced around for the beasts though, he paused and felt an odd sense of confusion fill him. The ground before him was covered in black.
<br><br>
He thought that it might be a beast curling up on the ground. With a pleased grin, he charged forward only to discover what he saw was not a beast, but a torn "picture" and the space was pooled with blood.
<br><br>
"This must have been an Other Shore creature. How could he have been torn apart like this?"
<br><br>
Zen was slightly surprised. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, didn't you say that there would be no danger on the first page?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked just as surprised as Zen was. He thought for a moment before speaking, "Perhaps it is an exceptional case.
<br><br>
Some of the Other Shore creatures are quite weak."
<br><br>
"Everyone here has achieved a Myriad Tribulations Body though. How could such an Other Shore creature lose to a beast in the scroll painting?"
<br><br>
Zen questioned, doubting what had been said.
<br><br>
Nodding his head, the Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't help but agree.
<br><br>
"Perhaps some beasts that shouldn't appear on the first page have appeared.
<br><br>
It's a very small chance that it happens, but still possible."
<br><br>
If that were true, then Zen would need to be careful.
<br><br>
While the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zen were analyzing the situation, three Other Shore creatures suddenly rushed over from afar. They had been able to kill a beast before Zen earlier.
<br><br>
Zen looked at them a little closer, and realized they were screaming for help as they ran from something.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven noticed what was chasing them before Zen did.
<br><br>
"It's a Worm Tapir! On the first page? Zen, run!" he called to Zen in warning.
<br><br>
"A Worm Tapir?"
<br><br>
Zen hesitated, but he could hear the urgency in the Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice.
<br><br>
He could see a black silhouette appear and disappear behind the Other Shore creatures, as if it were riding waves.
<br><br>
It was moving incredibly fast, taking no time at all to reach the three Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
When the black silhouette crashed over the top of them, they were ripped apart at the middle. Their blood spurted out in all directions creating a grotesque, abstract image.
<br><br>
Chapter 3809 Special Care "Hurry up!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven urged Zen. "What are you thinking about there?"
<br><br>
Zen merely stood on the spot and the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw it fit to get him moving.
<br><br>
There was no way to distinguish the corpses of the three Other Shore creatures from each other given that they were all covered with black ink.
<br><br>
Hearing what the Primeval Lord of Heaven had said, Zen quickly mobilized and began to wildly run towards the opposite direction.
<br><br>
Moving like a crab in the Eternal Scroll Painting made it extremely difficult for him to run but he was surprisingly fast since it was currently a life-anddeath crisis.
<br><br>
After killing the three Other Shore creatures, the Worm Tapir turned its attention to Zen who was trying to escape with his life. It straightened its body and only left four, black dots on the Eternal Scroll Painting. These dots were the projection of its four legs.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the black dots disappeared! This was when the Worm Tapir jumped into the air and lunged forward.
<br><br>
What it actually did was move to a higher space in order to get closer to its prey.
<br><br>
Zen witnessed it disappear every now and then but every time he caught sight of it, it seemed to get closer and closer.
<br><br>
A trace of helplessness appeared on his face. "It's so fast!" he whined and the Primeval Lord of Heaven harrumphed in reply.
<br><br>
"This is why I told you to leave in the beginning but no! You decided to stand there and watch it approach!"
<br><br>
Zen was no stranger to crisis. Ever since he carried the human race's Civilization Artifact, all he seemed to face was crisis, after crisis, after crisis. Through it all though, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was always his source of calm and clarity, however, this didn't seem to be the case for their current situation.
<br><br>
The reason he could be so calm back then was either because he had something up his sleeve or the trouble was so trivial that Zen would be able to deal with it by himself.
<br><br>
This time, however, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was at a loss. The moment Zen entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, he was already a part of it and subject to its irregularities.
<br><br>
It didn't help that his current form was very inconvenient. There was no way to escape from whatever crisis the Eternal Scroll Painting was going to throw at them.
<br><br>
The Eternal Scroll Painting could be entered but to leave it was a different story altogether.
<br><br>
If some people remained trapped on the first page because they failed to kill enough beasts, they wouldn't be able to leave until the Eternal Scroll Painting was closed.
<br><br>
There was definitely no form of escape to get away from this Worm Tapir! "What should I do now?" Zen asked in desperation. The distance between him and the Worm Tapir was only less than ten feet now.
<br><br>
If it went on like this, then there was no doubt that he would die within the next few seconds.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was currently trying to think of a way to help Zen escape his current predicament.
<br><br>
"What you can do is..."
<br><br>
It could not be denied that he was under so many limitations and there was only so much they could do to get out of this alive.
<br><br>
There was a large part in the Primeval Lord of Heaven's heart that he simply wanted to tell Zen to give up and resign to his fate. However, when he opened his mouth to tell him this, all that came out was one word: "Run!"
<br><br>
Heeding this advice, Zen rushed forward and tried to create more distance between him and his pursuer. At that point, the Worm Tapir was already less than a foot away.
<br><br>
Its next leap would no doubt reach him! From the corner of Zen's eye, the Worm Tapir disappeared once again.
<br><br>
Having noticed this, Zen stopped abruptly and ran in the opposite direction.
<br><br>
Sure, the Worm Tapir might be able to bridge distances using its method, but there was no way it would be able to predict Zen's movements.
<br><br>
This was only a temporary strategy to his problem but whatever bought him time was a welcome solution.
<br><br>
To his relief, this strategy actually worked! As the Worm Tapir reappeared, it suddenly pounced towards Zen's original spot only to find him already gone.
<br><br>
Just as it was about to turn its head, a huge, black hand suddenly appeared out of nowhere and snatched it in the air. A crying face also appeared above the Eternal Scroll Painting and announced a gloomy warning. "You can kill anyone else but him."
<br><br>
The hand seemed to have humbled the Worm Tapir who now curled up like a docile kitten.
<br><br>
The hand lightly tossed the Worm Tapir away who then fell into another place within the Eternal Scroll Painting where two Other Shore creatures were staying.
<br><br>
"Aoo..."
<br><br>
With a loud roar, the Worm Tapir revealed its ferocious tusks and began to rampage once again.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Zen continued to run.
<br><br>
His strategy might have worked but the fight wasn't over yet.
<br><br>
He still needed to make sure he was safely at a distance. Once the Worm Tapir landed, it would no doubt chase after him again, right? As he ran, Zen looked back just to see how far away the Worm Tapir was this time only to find it already gone! It had completely disappeared! "Primeval Lord of Heaven, where did it go?"
<br><br>
"I haven't the slightest idea," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied, also looking around for any sign of the Worm Tapir.
<br><br>
"Could it be..." Zen muttered. "Did it fall somewhere else when it pounced?"
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head and huffed. "Impossible! The Eternal Scroll Painting is a flat plane. Where could it have fallen into?"
<br><br>
Despite their misgivings, there was no way for them to know where the Worm Tapir went. At least Zen managed to stay alive.
<br><br>
Having survived this nightmare, Zen chose not to linger and continued ambling towards the direction he was headed to.
<br><br>
He, unfortunately, still did not encounter any beasts along the way though he did see quite a number of dead Other Shore creatures. They were either miserable pools of black ooze or scattered body parts all over the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"Were they all killed by that Worm Tapir?" Zen wondered out loud as he looked at all the strewn bodies. Was it even possible for the Worm Tapir to have caused all this carnage? Even if it could move really fast and had a large range of motion, there was no way it could've killed all these Other Shore creatures in such a short period of time.
<br><br>
There was only one explanation for all of this. There was more than one Worm Tapir here.
<br><br>
Just as Zen came to this conclusion, a long, thin silhouette emerged from a distance. It was a member of the Violet Cloud race! Among all Other Shore creatures, the Violet Cloud race was the fastest.
<br><br>
Despite their agility, however, they were still no match for the Worm Tapir.
<br><br>
Since it was fast, the warrior of the Violet Cloud race managed to outrun the Worm Tapir but it also caught the attention of five to six more. These Worm Tapirs followed behind the poor warrior so closely that Zen was completely ignored.
<br><br>
The massacre continued for about ten more minutes and the crying face above soon turned into the smiling one. "Ah, many of them have been cleared away..."
<br><br>
It originally wanted to eliminate more than half of Other Shore creatures but a lot more perished during the disaster. If the Worm Tapirs didn't stop killing, then it was only a matter of time before all of the creatures were annihilated.
<br><br>
With a wave of the huge hand, all the Worm Tapirs ceased their murderous rampage.
<br><br>
It was only then that the Other Shore creatures could breathe a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
"What should we do next?" the smiling face asked. "Should we start guiding him now? Or should we get him out directly?" The crying face appeared and shook its head.
<br><br>
"Don't make it so obvious. Let him enter the second page first," it said.
<br><br>
With that, the huge hand grabbed the brush and smeared it onto the Eternal Scroll Painting. Beasts began to materialize within the painting and gathered towards Zen.
<br><br>
This large pack of beasts headed straight towards him was greatly unnerving but Zen soon found that they were of normal strength levels. He would be able to beat them with his abilities.
<br><br>
Chapter 3810 The Second Page Although Zen didn't feel comfortable with his current form, he could now make do with it as he had been like this for so long.
<br><br>
The beasts that were rushing over him were much weaker than him.
<br><br>
It didn't matter if it was big or small. The moment he caught a creature, he tore it up like it was just a rotten piece of hemp rope.
<br><br>
The dead beasts were like ink on paper, soaring towards Zen's body and lingering around him.
<br><br>
The ink dripped from the Eternal Scroll Painting and turned into wisps of black smoke, shooting straight into Zen's Three Purities Stone.
<br><br>
"He finally gets some black smoke," Libby said, happy at this development.
<br><br>
Everyone from the Oneness Sky Palace knew that Zen was highly valued, and that his previous performance had been bad.
<br><br>
The only thing that made them happy was that Zen seemed to have saved himself even though so many Other Shore creatures had died within the Eternal Scroll Painting that had clearly turned into a bloody field.
<br><br>
They hadn't expected Zen to finally begin hunting beasts in the scroll painting.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! Wisps of black smoke continued to gather, gaining speed with each passing minute.
<br><br>
"Gosh, how many beasts did he kill in one go?" Pearce asked, panting, his eyes wide.
<br><br>
He had never entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, but he still knew a few things, thanks to the ancient books. It wasn't normal for Zen to collect the black smoke at such a fast speed.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures that had originally held a keen interest in Zen had all chosen to give up because many people belonging to almost every Other Shore race had died. But now, the descending black smoke attracted their attention once again.
<br><br>
"What's going on with Zen?"
<br><br>
"How is he so fast? Did he encounter a large group of beasts?"
<br><br>
"So many people have died in the Eternal Scroll Painting. Does it have anything to do with him?"
<br><br>
There was no doubt that there was something unusual about Zen's performance, and the Eternal Scroll Painting that had killed so many people. No wonder people were beginning to connect the two together.
<br><br>
But even Zen, who was in the painting, was dumbfounded.
<br><br>
There were too many beasts that were coming for him and surrounding him, like lambs to the slaughter. .
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, what do you think is the point of killing these beasts?"
<br><br>
Zen asked as he waved his hands to tear the beasts apart. "The Eternal Scroll Painting is also a trial. So what's the use of the black smoke?"
<br><br>
Both the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation were well understood.
<br><br>
The Soul City allowed one's soul to enter a new realm, while the Land of Bone Tribulation allowed one's physical body to enter a new realm, both multiplying one's strength.
<br><br>
One usually entered the Eternal Scroll Painting to obtain a bloodline, but what was the use of killing the beasts in it and obtaining the black smoke? "This black smoke is a kind of medium," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
"The place where people can obtain bloodlines isn't in the chaos but in the Abstruse Energy World. I believe you know how difficult it will be if you enter the Abstruse Energy World in your ordinary form."
<br><br>
Zen had been to the Abstruse Energy World. He had lost himself once he had entered it and had lost track of time and space. It was as if he had become completely blind and deaf.
<br><br>
The others were much worse than how Zen had been.
<br><br>
If the bloodlines were really placed on the ground like treasures, the Other Shore creatures would either not be able to pick them up, or they wouldn't be able to understand what it was on the ground.
<br><br>
But Geoffrey was obviously an exception.
<br><br>
Transforming into the special form in the painting was only the first step.
<br><br>
Fusing with the black smoke was the second. This kind of medium was a disguised test.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures were also busy killing beasts.
<br><br>
More than two-thirds of the Other Shore creatures had been eliminated by that group of Worm Tapirs. As a result, more than half the competitors in the Eternal Scroll Painting had been eliminated. The competition was really not that fierce. The remaining creatures didn't need to fight for the beasts.
<br><br>
No one could say if there would be another group of Worm Tapirs appearing on the first page. The best thing for them to do would be to quickly move to the second page before anything else happened.
<br><br>
Wisps of black smoke continued to descend from within the Eternal Scroll Painting and into the Three Purities Stones. Zen's Three Purities Stone was the most prominent of them all. The black smoke was like a pillar that stretched endlessly.
<br><br>
This lasted for about five minutes. Zen didn't know how many beasts he had killed. The moment he was done fusing with the black smoke, he suddenly felt his body sink.
<br><br>
It was as if someone had poured a massive amount of lead into his body.
<br><br>
The Eternal Scroll Painting's white ground began to sink, with Zen trapped within it.
<br><br>
It took only a moment to go from white to black and then from black to white again.
<br><br>
When Zen's vision was restored, he discovered that he was still lying on the Eternal Scroll Painting, in the flat form.
<br><br>
"The second page seems to be no different than the first page," Zen said.
<br><br>
"Not at all. Go and have a look," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
Zen moved some distance before two lines came into sight.
<br><br>
He found that these two lines outlined a road. Black thorns lined the road on both sides.
<br><br>
These thorns were in the painting but the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't hesitate to warn Zen that they would be fatal.
<br><br>
Even without his warning, Zen wouldn't be so bored that he'd be compelled to step on them.
<br><br>
According to what they had previously understood, since the first page of the scroll painting was a process of absorbing the medium, the second page must technically be a transition between the Abstruse Energy World and the chaos. Seen this way, the third page was already in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
The key to decide what one could get in the Abstruse Energy World was on the second page.
<br><br>
Zen walked along the road for quite a while. The two lines curved out in the distance and opened out into an open platform on which a few Other Shore creatures were already standing.
<br><br>
Zen was not the first one to enter the second page. When the Worm Tapirs had appeared, quite a number of creatures had already killed enough beasts.
<br><br>
These creatures had been lucky to avoid the slaughter.
<br><br>
The human-like figure standing on the left side of the platform was familiar to Zen. His forehead had an eye drawn on it. A three-eyed warrior! Zen was sure that this was none other than Egan from the Three Eyes race.
<br><br>
"You've also entered the second page!" Egan exclaimed, noticing Zen.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?"
<br><br>
Zen said, noticing that the moment he entered the platform, all the Other Shore creatures, including Egan, surrounded him.
<br><br>
"Where are the other members of my Violet Cloud race? Why haven't they entered the second page? Tell me if you don't want to die!" a member of the Violet Cloud race commanded. 'This must be Walden, ' Zen thought.
<br><br>
Chapter 3811 The Brush-wielder "The other members of the Violet Cloud race?"
<br><br>
Zen repeated with a hint of hesitation.
<br><br>
"Yes! Where are they now?"
<br><br>
Anxiety seeped into Walden's voice as he asked.
<br><br>
"They should all be dead by now," was Zen's indifferent response.
<br><br>
"Nonsense!" snapped Walden.
<br><br>
The Violet Cloud race's fighting capacity wasn't considered particularly outstanding among the many Other Shore races, but they held the advantage of moving freely within the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Even if something wrong were to happen on the first page, the people of the Violet Cloud race weren't likely to die so easily.
<br><br>
"Zen, how could anyone possibly die on the first page?" Egan asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
"That's too questionable. I've never even heard of anyone dying on the first page," another Other Shore creature echoed from the side.
<br><br>
Taking note of the suspicious gazes on him, Zen replied nonchalantly, "Since you don't believe me, why bother asking?"
<br><br>
"It seems you have yet to learn how to talk properly. Shall I teach you?"
<br><br>
threatened Walden impatiently.
<br><br>
On the bronze ground, the Violet Cloud race had confronted Zen. Neither Walden nor the other members had any intentions to befriend Zen.
<br><br>
But Claire's kindness toward him had dumbfounded the Eternal Realm masters of the Violet Cloud race.
<br><br>
If the Violet Cloud race wanted to kill Zen in the Eternal Scroll Painting, they'd undoubtedly be subjected to Claire's utmost wrath. So before Walden and the rest entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, Elder Howe had to remind them specifically not to attack Zen.
<br><br>
As Zen had been so highly esteemed by the Element Spirit race, Walden was extremely envious of him. In spite of Howe's warning, Walden decided to teach Zen a lesson.
<br><br>
As Walden approached threateningly, Zen raised his hands in a stance of attack.
<br><br>
While Zen had never intended to get along with the Violet Cloud race either, he hadn't yet fully understood the Eternal Scroll Painting's mechanism. He figured it would be wise to put aside any chance of conflict in the meantime.
<br><br>
But if Walden launched a challenge, he wasn't going to hesitate to fight back.
<br><br>
Just then, another Other Shore creature appeared — it was none other than a member of the Three Eyes race.
<br><br>
The guy was lucky enough to have survived the Worm Tapirs' slaughter.
<br><br>
"Egan, are you alright?"
<br><br>
While the warrior from the Three Eyes race did survive, he had witnessed a terrible amount of dead bodies torn apart by the Worm Tapirs on the first page — it was undeniably a horrifying sight.
<br><br>
"It's you, Kirk! Of course, I'm fine. Why do you ask me that? What happened on the first page?" While Egan was surprised to see one of his kindred, he was even more astounded by the frightened look on the other's face.
<br><br>
Egan knew Zen rather well — he didn't believe the latter was the sort of person who would ever lie to them.
<br><br>
Still, the fact that the other members from the Violet Cloud race all perished on the first page was far too astonishing. He couldn't help but be skeptical.
<br><br>
But the concern that filled his clansman pushed him to believe that something terrible had indeed unfolded on the first page of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Walden stopped to stare at Kirk and waited for an answer.
<br><br>
"A great number of Worm Tapirs appeared on the first page. Many people have been killed, including our brother..." Kirk delivered the grim news.
<br><br>
"What?!"
<br><br>
Walden and the Other Shore creatures were all shocked and slack-jawed at the news.
<br><br>
It was well-known just how powerful a single Worm Tapir was, as well as how terrifying an entire pack of the ferocious beasts could be.
<br><br>
It was then that they realized Zen told no lies.
<br><br>
"What about my people? Did you see any of them?" Walden asked anxiously.
<br><br>
For a second, Kirk hesitated before replying, "I couldn't quite verify that, but I did see three of their corpses along the way."
<br><br>
"Three of them…"
<br><br>
Walden's shoulders drooped at that.
<br><br>
This time, the Violet Cloud race had sent only a total of six warriors into the Eternal Scroll Painting, but three of them were now confirmed dead. The other two were also likely to have died.
<br><br>
Just as Walden did, the rest of the creatures began to understand the gravity of the situation.
<br><br>
Once Kirk arrived at the circular platform, more and more Other Shore creatures entered the area, bringing in more information about the first page, further verifying Zen's and Kirk's words.
<br><br>
On the first page, the Other Shore creatures had suffered heavy casualties.
<br><br>
In the end, only about forty of them survived and gathered on the circular platform — the number went far lower than any of the previous records.
<br><br>
Because of the abundant brutal killings, a heavy and somber atmosphere blanketed the platform.
<br><br>
Most of them kept silent if they could.
<br><br>
Such a great catastrophe unfolded on the first page so it was natural that they were dreading the second page. Now, they were wondering if they could even come out alive.
<br><br>
At that moment, they heard a strange rustling sound out of the blue.
<br><br>
A narrow line suddenly appeared out of nowhere in front of the circular platform. As it extended, it eventually formed a door.
<br><br>
"This door... did someone just paint this?" Zen muttered to himself in disbelief.
<br><br>
"It's possible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven agreed.
<br><br>
The Eternal Scroll Painting's form was already highly special — it was still uncertain whether it was in the chaos or the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, for the one who drew the actual lines on the painting, it was a far more complicated matter.
<br><br>
In the upper space outside of Zen and the rest's view, a huge brush drew on the second page of the painting.
<br><br>
Once the door was completed, the brush moved upward, forming a long and narrow path. Once the path extended up to a certain distance, it connected to another area that turned into a maze.
<br><br>
"There's no need for it to be so troublesome. Just draw a path that passes right through the maze," grumbled the crying face.
<br><br>
"Then why don't we just take him down from the painting and send him there directly?" the smiling face asked in return.
<br><br>
"Would that be too straightforward?" While the crying face was clearly hesitating, it indeed considered the possibility.
<br><br>
Snorting, the smiling face said, "As the brush-wielder, we've already done too much to help him. If we guide him right through the maze now, the consequences will be incalculable. Even if you're willing to do so, I will not allow it!"
<br><br>
The smiling face and the crying face were two separate souls of a single creature. All members of their race carried two souls in one body — their conversations were signs of the inner contradictions of a lonely brushwielder.
<br><br>
"If he dies halfway, all our previous efforts will be wasted," said the crying face with worry.
<br><br>
"He obtained all the eighteen imprints. If he still fails, it means we're destined to fail as well. No one else can be blamed for that," the smiling face said decisively.
<br><br>
And so the brush continued to extend upward until it reached the very top of the Eternal Scroll Painting where a black vortex lay. From their point of view, there were numerous white dots of light flashing in the depths of the vortex.
<br><br>
This black vortex was the so-called third page of the Eternal Scroll Painting — something people could see in the Grand Plain Stage. It was still white when they looked up at it from the stage, but the inside was actually black.
<br><br>
Once the brush-wielder connected the lines to the black vortex, they seemed to get pulled into it. Then, the circular platform at the bottom began rotating slowly until the door opened with a tug.
<br><br>
"The door is open..."
<br><br>
"I don't want to participate this time…"
<br><br>
"Now that we've reached the second page, we must advance!"
<br><br>
Naturally, the many casualties from the first page had some Other Shore creatures grow hesitant to proceed.
<br><br>
The trip in the painting was far different from the previous ones. Some decided to merely wait on the platform. Once the event ended, they'd be able to leave the painting safely.
<br><br>
Since the Other Shore creatures could pass through the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, they all possessed outstanding wills and talents — eventually, of course, most of them managed to conquer their fears and step into the door.
<br><br>
Chapter 3812 The No-break Maze Behind the door, two straight lines extended upward, forming another long and narrow path.
<br><br>
Walden of the Violet Cloud race no longer seemed to be in the mood to make trouble for Zen. He passed through the door and rushed to the forefront of the group.
<br><br>
The other Other Shore creatures all trailed behind Walden, following close behind him.
<br><br>
On this occasion, the Three Eyes race had sent three members into the Eternal Scroll Painting. One of the three had died, which they considered quite a good result.
<br><br>
The creatures from the Other Shore entered the door one after another. Once most of them had passed through, Zen moved forward in a strange sideways manner, waving his hands and feet.
<br><br>
Egan and Kirk were the last to enter the door. They had intentionally waited for Zen to advance before them. However, when the two members of the Three Eyes race saw the way Zen moved, they immediately burst into laughter.
<br><br>
Egan said, grinning, "Zen, we have a better way of moving in this current form."
<br><br>
He had found that Zen had been moving strangely since he entered the round platform.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The members of the Three Eyes race were very similar in form and build to human beings. Zen thought that if Egan and his clansman knew a better style of movement, he would be able to imitate it.
<br><br>
Egan stretched out his hands and raised his arms. In a single motion, he slashed his arms downwards, and the motion propelled his body into the air.
<br><br>
"It looks almost like you're swimming,"
<br><br>
Zen observed, his brows furrowed.
<br><br>
"Yes, this way is like swimming, and it should be the fastest way," said Egan. "Your way, on the other hand..."
<br><br>
Zen stood with his arms outstretched, imitating Egan's earlier pose. He slashed his hands downward, and his entire body was propelled a good distance forward. He smiled.
<br><br>
Egan was right. It was much faster and easier to move forward using these motions.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven," Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Zen was slightly put out that the Primeval Lord of Heaven hadn't told him about this way. He believed that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had to have known about it.
<br><br>
"Well, I thought you were enjoying walking like a crab, so I didn't mention it," replied the Primeval Lord of Heaven with a chuckle.
<br><br>
Zen rolled his eyes.
<br><br>
He continued to slash with his arms, moving his body forward along the path formed by the two thin lines.
<br><br>
After he had covered a lengthy distance along the path, Zen stopped to take a look around him. The round platform at the bottom was no longer visible.
<br><br>
He gazed at the top, but nothing could be seen.
<br><br>
A question suddenly arose in his mind. 'The path is enclosed by the two lines. I wonder what will happen if anyone steps outside the boundary of the lines?' he thought.
<br><br>
He decided to ask Egan. In fact, Egan had been waiting for Zen to ask such a question since they stepped through the door, for it was the first time Zen had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"The path is not as simple as it looks," Egan explained. "Without this path, this area would be a dark, bottomless abyss. If you want to see for yourself, there's a place in the middle of the path where you can observe the abyss."
<br><br>
"Observe the bottomless abyss?" Zen asked with interest. Of course, he was fascinated by what lay outside the lines of the path, and he wanted to see the abyss Egan had mentioned.
<br><br>
Egan nodded. "Wait, and I'll tell you when we reach the right spot."
<br><br>
They continued to move forward for some time. Finally, Egan came to a stop, and Zen could see why. The path had suddenly become wider.
<br><br>
But they had not yet reached the end. They were at the midpoint of the path.
<br><br>
Several small rings had been drawn in the middle of the path. Inside each ring was the outline of a hexagram array.
<br><br>
Zen opened his mouth to ask another question, but Egan was already telling him the answer. "If you stand on the hexagram array, you can see the environment that surrounds this path."
<br><br>
There were six hexagram arrays in the open space. Most of the Other Shore creatures passed by without slowing down, seemingly disinterested in the arrays. Perhaps it was because they had already seen the abyss many times.
<br><br>
However, as a newcomer, Zen was extremely curious about the characteristics of the Eternal Scroll Painting. As soon as Egan finished speaking, he hurriedly went to stand on a hexagram array.
<br><br>
Indeed, it was actually more accurate to say that Zen was crouching, not standing. After all, there was no concept of "height" in the limited dimension of the Eternal Scroll Painting. In actuality, Zen was crawling slowly across the ground.
<br><br>
When Zen had positioned himself at the proper spot on the hexagram array, he caught his breath, for everything around him had changed.
<br><br>
Previously, his perception of the environment had been constrained. He could only see one plane of his own and the scene around it. But at that moment, Zen seemed to have returned to his original form.
<br><br>
It was as though he stood on a long, narrow black bridge, surrounded by the darkness of an infinite, fathomless abyss.
<br><br>
"Now do you understand?" asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who sounded like he was smiling.
<br><br>
"If I leave the path drawn by the lines, I will fall off the bridge and into the abyss," Zen murmured, nodding to himself.
<br><br>
While he stood on the hexagram array, Zen had regained a temporary freedom of movement, so he seized the opportunity to move his limbs as he wished.
<br><br>
"To be more precise, you will find yourself lost in the passage between the chaos and the Abstruse Energy World," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven, to clarify Zen's answer.
<br><br>
There were several notorious instances of people who had crossed the lines of the bridge, unable to resist their curiosity.
<br><br>
None who left the path had ever returned. Once someone fell into the abyss, he would be lost forever.
<br><br>
As Zen reveled in the freedom to move his hands and feet, he glanced down at the bridge. The lines on the Eternal Scroll Painting looked exquisite.
<br><br>
Egan and Kirk stood patiently on the bridge, waiting for him.
<br><br>
From Zen's vantage point, these two members of the Three Eyes race were no longer comprised of lines. Instead, their own original appearances were imprinted on the bridge.
<br><br>
Zen observed them, intending to withdraw from the hexagram array after a few more moments.
<br><br>
But an unexpected chill suddenly lifted the hairs on the back of his neck. He quickly turned. To his shock, he caught a fleeting glimpse of a crying face floating in the darkness, staring at him across a great distance.
<br><br>
"What's that?" he asked quickly.
<br><br>
He was startled, and tried to catch sight of the face again, but there was nothing but blackness.
<br><br>
The crying face had vanished almost as soon as it appeared.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven tried to see what Zen was talking about, but the crying face was gone, leaving only empty darkness behind.
<br><br>
"What did you see?" asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
"A face!" Zen exclaimed. He had only seen it for an instant, but he was absolutely certain of what he saw.
<br><br>
There was no doubt in his mind that it had been a face. After all, he had seen it as clearly as he saw the bright lines of the path floating in the dark abyss.
<br><br>
"Perhaps you saw something else," the Primeval Lord of Heaven muttered.
<br><br>
He had an idea that there must be some creature in charge of the Eternal Scroll Painting. But if there was, then such a creature had not been seen in living memory. It had stayed hidden through countless chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Why would that creature choose to appear just when Zen entered the Eternal Scroll Painting? "I don't think so," Zen said.
<br><br>
But he was beginning to have second thoughts. He realized that he had been in the Eternal Scroll Painting for some time now, and it was not unlikely that some illusion had manifested in his vision when he first regained his original form.
<br><br>
He glanced around, peering into the depths of the abyss, but this time he saw nothing but darkness. He sighed. With a shrug, he stepped out of the hexagram array.
<br><br>
As soon as he left the array, he found himself prone on the ground again.
<br><br>
The transformation between the two forms was not a painful process, but it was slightly uncomfortable. He felt awkward in this form.
<br><br>
"So, did you see the abyss and the bridge?" Egan asked with a smile.
<br><br>
"Yes, and it definitely seems like a bad idea to stray from the path," Zen replied.
<br><br>
He decided not to mention the crying face to Egan and Kirk.
<br><br>
The three of them lifted their arms and slashed downwards, resuming their forward motion. The hexagram arrays had been the midpoint of the journey, and they had made it through half of the remainder of the path when they came to a halt. To Zen's astonishment, the two distinct lines of the road had branched out to form an enormous, complex pattern.
<br><br>
It was the famous No-Break Maze of the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
Zen said nothing as he stared at the maze. He absorbed its vastness and complexity.
<br><br>
In general, there was a real risk of getting lost in a maze, as anyone wandering through high-walled paths could easily lose their sense of direction and position.
<br><br>
But that was not the case in this situation. The vantage point of Zen and the others was such that they looked down at the maze from the top of the Eternal Scroll Painting, so although they could only see a portion of the maze, they could clearly see all the paths and passages within. From their point of view, the maze was only a series of lines. What was the purpose of setting up such a maze here? Chapter 3813 Poisonous Leeches The other creatures from the Other Shore entered the No-break Maze without hesitation and Zen, Egan and Kirk followed in behind them.
<br><br>
The maze itself was not complicated. Its purpose was not to trap and confuse creatures but to usher them through the tests the maze provided.
<br><br>
If one was strong enough, he or she would be able to pass through and make their way to the third page to choose his or her bloodline.
<br><br>
The weak, however, would be eliminated or die.
<br><br>
The process of becoming a powerful warrior had always been this cruel.
<br><br>
"Such a form does not allow us to exercise our true strength," Zen complained to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
He could not even move freely now that he was in the form of a picture, and so naturally his fighting ability was reduced.
<br><br>
Zen was not the first to complain.
<br><br>
Other methods could have been employed for the purpose of selecting Other Shore creatures to obtain the bloodline abilities. A competition in an area of the Grand Plain Stage could be held, or a trial could be set up in a place similar to the Soul City or the Land of Bone Tribulation.
<br><br>
This would have been better as in their form in the Eternal Scroll Painting, it was impossible to show their strength.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, you will not be in this form forever," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven with a smile. "Remember the hexagram arrays?"
<br><br>
"Sir, do you mean to say there are also hexagram arrays in the maze?" Zen asked, his eyes lighting up.
<br><br>
Just a moment ago he had returned to his original form and he felt like a drowning man that had just climbed ashore. It was obvious he wished to fight in his standard form.
<br><br>
"Yes, that is correct," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered, nodding his head.
<br><br>
The reason the Eternal Scroll Painting was designed this way was because of how difficult it was to build a passage from the chaos to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In the context of the vortex, even for that mysterious civilization, it was quite difficult to transport creatures one at a time. Perhaps it was the stubbornness of the Instant Civilization that had the trial still set in the passage to this day.
<br><br>
It was because of this that, even though they were unhappy with it, every Other Shore creature that entered the passage would be compressed into a picture.
<br><br>
It was true that when their forms were flat, their strength was suppressed.
<br><br>
But even for an incredibly powerful civilization like the Instant Civilization, it was impossible to allow Other Shore creatures to maintain their true form throughout the passage. And so the hexagram arrays were created as a compromise.
<br><br>
They had made their way through a fair distance of the maze when they came to their first fork in the road. Those Other Shore creatures made their choices quickly and moved on.
<br><br>
Zen had learned that one could choose either path and reach the destination as long as one was strong enough to handle it.
<br><br>
The difference between the paths were the beasts on them.
<br><br>
Some of the Other Shore races had already learned the arrangements of the beasts and had their choices ready.
<br><br>
As for Zen, his mind was totally blank.
<br><br>
"Zen, left or right?" Egan stopped and asked.
<br><br>
"Well... Is there any difference?"
<br><br>
Zen hoped the Primeval Lord of Heaven would offer some advice, but he revealed that the arrangements of the beasts in the No-break Maze changed over time and so after so long, they would have changed too much for him to be of any use here.
<br><br>
"Of course there are differences," replied Egan, "According to the last ten openings of the Eternal Scroll Painting, the right will prove more troublesome, while the left path is much safer!"
<br><br>
"Then why did they choose the right one?" Zen asked confusedly of some of the Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
Their choice didn't seem to surprise Kirk at all. "The information different races have collected varies. Perhaps, for them, taking the right path will be easier."
<br><br>
"Since this is your first time in the No-break Maze, you can follow us,"
<br><br>
Egan suggested.
<br><br>
He might not have seen Zen fight with his own eyes, but he believed Zen must have some merits to be invited by two great races.
<br><br>
"Okay,"
<br><br>
Zen replied, accepting the invitation. Although it was possible for the Primeval Lord of Heaven to lead him through, the Eternal Scroll Painting changed constantly, not to mention, his impression of the Three Eyes race was good.
<br><br>
They decided on the left passage and came across several forks in the road along the way.
<br><br>
Every fork further divided the Other Shore creatures into different paths.
<br><br>
Four forks later and it was only the three of them left on this one. Now, two thin lines that twisted like waves formed the curves of the channel before them.
<br><br>
There were many circular objects on the walls on either side and Zen didn't have the slightest clue as to what they were.
<br><br>
"Zen, I think it'd be best to walk faster on this road. The things you see on the walls are Poisonous Leeches. If we get caught by them, we'll be in big trouble," Egan warned.
<br><br>
This was the most treacherous section of the road ahead. Once they passed through here, the rest would be much easier.
<br><br>
"Got it," Zen nodded.
<br><br>
They made some preparations at the intersection and suddenly all three of them rushed along the curving passage.
<br><br>
Zen changed his method of charging forward and could now keep up with Egan and Kirk. They all seemed to be swimming through a river course and made great strides in their advance.
<br><br>
Just as they entered the curved passageway, the circular objects began breaking apart and worms as thick as arms poured out. They appeared to have wings and flew at them It turned out the circular objects were in fact eggs containing disgusting worms.
<br><br>
Zen followed closely behind Egan and Kirk, not forgetting to observe the beasts.
<br><br>
"Zen, stay close and don't fight these Poisonous Leeches. Even if you kill them all, more will just appear," Egan, who marched on the front line, reminded Zen.
<br><br>
The Poisonous Leeches weren't very strong but they were large in numbers and highly poisonous. Thus, most of the Other Shore creatures opted not to choose this path.
<br><br>
But then, Kirk suddenly yelled out in shock, "Egan, there's something wrong with the eggs ahead of us!"
<br><br>
Egan saw the eggs and his face lost all its color too.
<br><br>
The eggs on both sides of the path were slightly black on the surface.
<br><br>
The white eggs contained ordinary Poisonous Leeches, while the slightly black eggs contained Chill Poisonous Leeches. These were far stronger than the ordinary Poisonous Leeches.
<br><br>
There had always been Chill Poisonous Leeches on this path, but before, there had only been one or two at the end of it.
<br><br>
They were difficult to deal with but not that big a problem if one could run fast enough.
<br><br>
But now, they had only traveled a little part of the journey and had already encountered quite a few Chill Poisonous Leeches. This was beyond Egan's expectations.
<br><br>
"All we can do now is to continue pushing forward!" said Egan, gritting his teeth.
<br><br>
They were almost completely blocked off by the leeches behind them, making retreat impossible.
<br><br>
They were left no choice but to rush out with all the strength they could muster.
<br><br>
A rush of cold spread from the black eggs when they cracked open.
<br><br>
Zen, Egan and Kirk immediately felt the drop in temperature. Black Chill Poisonous Leeches burst from the eggs and surrounded them.
<br><br>
At the front, Egan and Kirk stretched their bodies out to avoid the group of Chill Poisonous Leeches.
<br><br>
But behind them, Zen had been stopped by the leeches.
<br><br>
He was unable to pass through and one concern grew within him: would his physical strength still be the same now that his form had changed? Chapter 3814 Eliminate Now that Zen was in a special form in the painting, it restrained many of his abilities. However, it was still his body.
<br><br>
He was formerly immune to all poisons, but did that change when he was in this special form? He wasn't sure about that, but he had no time to think about it now.
<br><br>
As the Chill Poisonous Leeches continued to come at him, he waved his arms in defense. "Egan, the Chill Poisonous Leeches have surrounded the human!" Kirk warned.
<br><br>
"But we can't get back to him!" Egan said in frustration. The two of them continued to rush forward while the black eggs on both sides broke one after another.
<br><br>
They couldn't stop since if they halted for even a second, the everincreasing swarm of Chill Poisonous Leeches would swallow them.
<br><br>
They already had enough problems with fighting off the Poisonous Leeches alone.
<br><br>
If they got infected with the venom, they were doomed. It was clear that the Chill Poisonous Leeches would be one of their worst nightmares if they fell under siege.
<br><br>
Normally, they were supposed to encounter only several Chill Poisonous Leeches in the place, but the current number of Chill Poisonous Leeches had reached half of the whole swarm already. They realized that it wasn't only the first page that changed, but the second page as well! In such a desperate situation, a moment of hesitation would naturally bring them to death. Besides, they weren't powerful enough to save Zen anyway.
<br><br>
They could only charge forward.
<br><br>
With a heavy heart, Egan turned his head during escape and saw Zen's figure had completely disappeared from his view. All he saw was a big ball of Poisonous Leeches, and Zen was inside. He supposed that Zen had died already.
<br><br>
After the two members of the Three Eyes race ran for a certain distance, the ball of Poisonous Leeches suddenly moved. The worms continued to wriggle around it, then the ball slowly nudged forward.
<br><br>
As the ball rolled along the path, it attracted more and more Poisonous Leeches to it.
<br><br>
As a result, Zen couldn't see his body, let alone Egan and Kirk.
<br><br>
When he looked down from the top, he only saw an increasing amount of Poisonous Leeches that continued to pile on top of each other and crawl around him. Then, he felt something sticky around his body.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he was still immune to poisons in the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Even though the Poisonous Leeches repeatedly spat venom at him, he wasn't injured at all.
<br><br>
However, the venom of the Chill Poisonous Leeches made his body feel numb and cold. It seemed that the venom contained immense freezing power. It wasn't a problem, though, since the numbness only lasted for an instant.
<br><br>
But as he continued to nudge forward, more and more Chill Poisonous Leeches attached to the ball.
<br><br>
Every time they spat out venom at him, he inevitably had to pause for a second.
<br><br>
Therefore, he forcibly had to stop from time to time and moved at a very slow pace.
<br><br>
Yet, the crooked passage was not long. Egan and Kirk in front of him managed to rush out before they got caught in the swarm of Poisonous Leeches.
<br><br>
Both of them stood at the end of the passage and looked back, but they couldn't see what was happening behind them from their spot.
<br><br>
"I don't think Zen will survive that..." Kirk said after a while.
<br><br>
"I know," Egan agreed and nodded.
<br><br>
At the back of Egan's mind, he started to regret ever taking Zen along this path. Not only did he fail to help Zen, but he also led him to death. Guilt quickly overwhelmed him.
<br><br>
"Let's go," suggested Kirk.
<br><br>
Many creatures had died in this journey in the Eternal Scroll Painting, and Zen was just another of them.
<br><br>
The Other Shore races that had lived in the Grand Plain Stage for a very long time understood that necessary sacrifices were inevitable. Egan and Kirk were fully aware that if they were not careful enough, they would die in the Eternal Scroll Painting as well.
<br><br>
However, no matter how dangerous the Eternal Scroll Painting was, it didn't rob them of their desire to reach the Eternal Realm. No one wanted to give up entering the Eternal Scroll Painting because of fear. On the contrary, all the Other Shore creatures cherished such a rare opportunity.
<br><br>
"Let's wait a bit more," said Egan with a frown.
<br><br>
Although Egan and Zen weren't very close, Zen's amazing performances during their two encounters impressed Egan. Thus, Egan still hoped that Zen wouldn't die that easily.
<br><br>
Kirk sighed in resignation and stood beside him.
<br><br>
They looked inside the depths of the passage until they saw a huge ball of Poisonous Leeches that rolled out of the corner. "The Poisonous Leeches..."
<br><br>
Kirk muttered, his eyes wide with shock.
<br><br>
"What happened?" Egan asked. The scene took him aback as well. Before the two of them escaped, they witnessed the ball of Poisonous Leeches swallow Zen.
<br><br>
However, the size of the ball of Poisonous Leeches now was far bigger than before.
<br><br>
The mass of worms was tangled closely together, and the whole ball almost blocked the passageway.
<br><br>
The huge ball nudged and stopped as it slowly moved towards the end of the passageway. "I-it's Zen. He's still alive..." Egan slowly uttered in realization.
<br><br>
"He survived so many Poisonous Leeches? And there are so many Chill Poisonous Leeches among them..." Kirk was also dumbfounded.
<br><br>
They only knew of one possibility that could explain this: Zen was immune to poisons.
<br><br>
"Retreat! He's getting closer to us!" They suddenly snapped back to reality and hurriedly ran back.
<br><br>
Zen was not afraid of the Poisonous Leeches, but they were! While they retreated, Egan growled, "Zen! Zen! Can you hear me?"
<br><br>
Everyone who entered the Eternal Scroll Painting still retained their senses.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen could still hear Egan even though layers of Poisonous Leeches enveloped him.
<br><br>
"Yes," he replied calmly. "Are you still alive?" Egan asked again.
<br><br>
For a moment, the stupid question rendered Zen speechless. But then, he asked back, "Is there any way to get rid of these Poisonous Leeches?"
<br><br>
Zen had tried to crush and kill the Poisonous Leeches.
<br><br>
However, they were so slippery that he only managed to kill a few of them after a long time.
<br><br>
There were probably thousands of Poisonous Leeches wrapped around his body, and God knew how long it would take to kill them one by one.
<br><br>
Egan slowly stepped back to distance himself from the cluster of Poisonous Leeches. Then he said, "Yes, there is. Keep moving forward and then turn left at the corner. You will enter a room with a hexagram array. Once you enter the array, you'll be able to deal with them!"
<br><br>
That was the purpose of the hexagram arrays scattered around the No-break Maze. Those who stepped onto the arrays would turn from a part of the painting back into living creatures, then they would be able to fight the monsters.
<br><br>
However, this was probably the first time that someone had attracted so many Poisonous Leeches.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen followed Egan's instructions and continued to move slowly.
<br><br>
After he turned around the corner, he indeed saw a separate room on the side. In the center of the room was a hexagram array.
<br><br>
He dragged the Poisonous Leeches hard and moved towards the array. The second he stepped on it, his whole form underwent a drastic change.
<br><br>
He regained his original appearance as a creature, and so did the Poisonous Leeches.
<br><br>
When the Poisonous Leeches were just a painting, they didn't look that disgusting. Now that they turned into real creatures, however, Zen instantly felt sick in the stomach at the sight of them.
<br><br>
"Oh fuck! Go to hell!"
<br><br>
He felt miserable at the thought of how long the disgusting creatures stuck to him. His body trembled in rage, and he released a tremendous amount of power.
<br><br>
The great force sent the thousands of Poisonous Leeches wrapped around him flying in all directions. Then, his power formed numerous spirals that spread everywhere, and the Poisonous Leeches were sliced into pieces before they fell on the ground.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Egan and Kirk, who stood outside the room, watched in utter surprise.
<br><br>
The path the Three Eyes race had chosen might seem easier than the others, but it was also full of dangers. A large number of the members of the Three Eyes race had died in the hands of the Poisonous Leeches. This time, though, it looked like the Poisonous Leeches had found their nemesis.
<br><br>
Chapter 3815 Huge Snake After Zen had cleaned his body, he checked his surroundings.
<br><br>
Except for the hexagram array in the center, there was nothing else in the room.
<br><br>
An idea popped out of his mind. "Now that I've returned to normal, what if I walk out of this room?" he muttered.
<br><br>
Driven by curiosity, he walked towards the door of the room.
<br><br>
When he reached the door, however, something strange happened. The moment he stepped out, countless thin black threads suddenly appeared in the passage.
<br><br>
The thin black threads formed a net that blocked his path.
<br><br>
"Don't try to challenge the rules they've set, lest you cause unnecessary trouble," the Primeval Lord of Heaven warned.
<br><br>
Judging from the number of the hexagram arrays the Instant Civilization had arranged, it wasn't easy to open a room of the hexagram array. Anyone who broke into the area outside the room by force would bring great pressure to the Eternal Scroll Painting. No one knew what would happen after that.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to exert even more strength, he retreated when he heard the Primeval Lord of Heaven's words.
<br><br>
After he stepped into the hexagram array, he turned into a picture again.
<br><br>
Egan and Kirk had been watching outside for a long time. When they saw Zen exit the room, both of them immediately went to him.
<br><br>
"Zen, your body is immune to the poison! What a truly great advantage,"
<br><br>
Egan said with admiration.
<br><br>
Members of various Other Shore races in the Grand Plain Stage had different body shapes, but only a few of them were truly unafraid of the poison.
<br><br>
Moreover, the venom of the Poisonous Leech was quite special, and even the few creatures with the poison resistant physique found it hard to resist the Poisonous Leeches' attack. "Aside from the Poisonous Leeches, are there any other creatures on this path?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
At that moment, Egan became cautious. "It was easy to pass through this path before. In the past, everything went smoothly as long as one went through the corridor with Poisonous Leeches, but now, it's hard to say in this special period," he said.
<br><br>
When the Eternal Scroll Painting opened this time, there was something wrong on the first and second pages. Thus, how could the remaining path be so easy to pass? The three of them advanced into the depths of the No-break Maze once again. Then, several more forks appeared in front of them.
<br><br>
Since Kirk was familiar with the forks, he chose the direction without hesitation.
<br><br>
Some beasts in the scroll painting came from both of their sides along the way. The beasts weren't that strong, but before Zen could attack them, both Kirk and Egan already killed them.
<br><br>
However, they did encounter one tricky thing: it was a spider the same size as Zen, and there was a hexagram array not far away from the spider.
<br><br>
This time, Egan entered the hexagram array and returned to his normal form. Then, he asked Kirk to provoke the spider and lure it into the room with the hexagram array.
<br><br>
The moment the spider entered the room, Egan's forehead suddenly released a ray of light.
<br><br>
Outside the room, Zen saw a ray of black light flash above Egan's head. He didn't know what kind of powerful theurgy the black light was. In just a second, the light sliced the spider in half.
<br><br>
When Zen first saw Egan in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, the stage suppressed the latter's true power. Therefore, he didn't think that Egan was strong.
<br><br>
Now that Egan had returned to the Grand Plain Stage, he was indeed extraordinarily powerful. After all, he was the best warrior among the young generations of the Three Eyes race. His strength was only second to those of the Eternal Realm masters of his race.
<br><br>
Once they had dealt with the spider, the three of them set off again.
<br><br>
There were no longer any forks on the path. The other paths in the No-break Maze began to converge, and they saw members from the other races of the Other Shore on their way.
<br><br>
Although the Three Eyes race was neutral in the Grand Plain Stage, they had a good relationship with the other races of the Other Shore. Egan was young, but he seemed to get along well with the others in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. Thus, he took the initiative to communicate with the Other Shore creatures and roughly understood the situation.
<br><br>
The other paths had also changed, but the overall change wasn't that big.
<br><br>
Only a few members of the Other Shore races encountered great danger, but most of them passed safely.
<br><br>
At that rate, it wouldn't be long before they passed through the maze and went to the third page.
<br><br>
Thoughts about the high possibility of becoming Eternal Realm masters filled the Other Shore creatures' minds, which boosted their morale and increased their speed.
<br><br>
"The end of the No-break Maze is right in front of us. It's also the most dangerous area," said Egan.
<br><br>
The entire No-break Maze looked like a huge spindle. There was only one entrance and one exit, so all the Other Shore creatures would eventually gather together.
<br><br>
No matter which path they chose in the maze, there was no easy way to pass through it, and the end of the maze was the most difficult and dangerous of them all.
<br><br>
Just as Egan, Zen, and the others arrived at the end of the maze, three Other Shore creatures stood in front of them.
<br><br>
The one on the left was none other than Walden of the Violet Cloud race.
<br><br>
"Why don't you move along?" Egan asked.
<br><br>
Walden observed Zen, Egan and Kirk for a while, especially since Zen looked very much like a member of the Three Eyes race. At that point, only through the lack of an eye on Zen's forehead, one could tell him from the other two.
<br><br>
When Walden realized that Zen had also passed smoothly, he looked slightly disappointed. The human brat made it through the maze alive? Then, he said, "The end of the No-break Maze is right in front of us. It used to be very dangerous. I wonder what kind of powerful creature is there this time, but we won't dare to go there. Will you try?"
<br><br>
Egan blinked his eyes and took a step back, while Zen stood still as if he hadn't heard what Walden said.
<br><br>
It would be fine if Walden didn't say anything, but now his words made Zen and the others more vigilant.
<br><br>
Five Other Shore creatures explored the maze together with Walden. The six of them cooperated well with each other, so they were the first to arrive at the end of the maze.
<br><br>
Based on the principle of teamwork, they planned to go directly out of the No-break Maze and enter the third page.
<br><br>
As soon as they rushed forward, however, a large black creature appeared.
<br><br>
It turned out to be a big black snake, and its enormous body occupied almost the maze's whole passageway! Walden and two of his companions reacted very quickly. The moment they saw the big black snake come out from one side, they used almost all of their strength to retreat to the passageway.
<br><br>
However, the three Other Shore creatures that were in front weren't so lucky. They didn't even have time to call for help before the black snake swallowed them.
<br><br>
The big black snake was so strong that resistance was futile. That was why Walden and his group waited in their spot.
<br><br>
When he saw Zen and the others arrive, he suddenly had a wishful thought.
<br><br>
He hoped that Zen would risk his life to deal with the huge snake. He didn't expect that Zen would turn a deaf ear to his words! Not long after, more and more Other Shore creatures came out from the different paths in the No-break Maze and gathered in the same area.
<br><br>
"Why don't you all move forward?"
<br><br>
"I'm afraid the beast guarding the exit of the No-break Maze is not easy to deal with this time!"
<br><br>
Of course, the Other Shore creatures had different personalities.
<br><br>
Some of them were quite patient and chose to plan before they took action, while others were very irritable and rash.
<br><br>
When no one wanted to go forward, a tall and burly member of the Earth Tremor race squeezed out of the crowd and stood in front of everyone. "It's not a good idea for you to only wait here. Let me step forward and have a look," he announced.
<br><br>
He quickly stepped forward after he spoke. As soon as he walked away, a large black shadow emerged from the other side of the passageway. It opened its big, black, bloody mouth and closed it right after. At the same time, the member of the Earth Tremor race disappeared from everyone's sight.
<br><br>
Chapter 3816 Another Snake The passageway erupted into an uproar after the warrior of the Earth Tremor race was swallowed by the black snake. The Other Shore creatures at the front even began backpedaling non-stop.
<br><br>
"It's the Evil Orochi!"
<br><br>
"Could it really be?"
<br><br>
"I know this time has not been ordinary, but why did an Evil Orochi have to appear?"
<br><br>
They all fell deep into despair when they saw the black snake known as the Evil Orochi.
<br><br>
Many Other Shore creatures had been studying the No-break Maze and the Eternal Scroll Painting diligently for many chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Most were very clear on what beasts would appear in which part of the maze, the beasts' strength and how to deal with them. It was well established that the road chosen by the Three Eyes race was abundant in Poisonous Leeches and the path the Violet Cloud race often took possessed a large number of Devil Shadow Butterflies.
<br><br>
There were usually powerful beasts guarding the end of the maze.
<br><br>
They were few in number, but they were seriously powerful.
<br><br>
Among them was the beast known as Worm Tapir. It had appeared on the first page before but often appeared at the end of the maze.
<br><br>
Although Worm Tapirs were powerful and their movements were erratic, there was usually only one of them guarding the end of the maze, so it likely would not cause any devastation like that on the first page.
<br><br>
There were also other beasts of different shapes and sizes that had appeared at the end of the maze.
<br><br>
All were extremely powerful but had their weaknesses.
<br><br>
For instance, Worm Tapir, due to its shape, couldn't enter the room with a hexagram array. The attack of another venomous beast was terrifying but it moved slowly...
<br><br>
In addition to these common beasts, there were also some rare ones such as the Wall Ghost and Earth Monkey. If they came across these, all that could be done was pray for luck.
<br><br>
The Wall Ghost and Earth Monkey were still not the most powerful beasts around though. Undoubtedly, the most powerful and the rarest, was this giant serpent before them, Evil Orochi! In recorded years, it had only appeared five times and when it did appear, none of the creatures had reached the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
When it appeared the first time, the Other Shore creatures that had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting did not know of its strength. As a result, almost all of them were killed.
<br><br>
Things ended much better on its second appearance. Those who had entered knew they stood no chance against it and simply surrendered and were eventually kicked out of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
From then on things continued in this way. If warriors were unlucky enough to meet the serpent, they chose to give up, which could at least allow them to escape with their lives.
<br><br>
This was why when the Other Shore creatures saw the Evil Orochi this time, they all heaved heavily. They stood no chance and would have to give up.
<br><br>
"It seems you are quite unlucky. You've encountered this beast on your first entry into the Eternal Scroll Painting," Egan said with a bitter smile.
<br><br>
The image of this giant snake flashing by replayed in Zen's mind. He frowned and asked, "Is it really as powerful as you say?"
<br><br>
"Yes," replied Egan firmly. "Not a single soul had managed to survive it."
<br><br>
"We can't go forward. We'll just wait till the next time the Eternal Scroll Painting opens," said Kirk standing beside him.
<br><br>
They weren't the only ones feeling this way; the other creatures were resigned to surrender as well.
<br><br>
They had time to wait for their next opportunity. After all, they had been faced with the Evil Orochi, and there was no shame in leaving empty handed.
<br><br>
But Zen would not back down so easily. Egan had said this giant snake was invincible but he still asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven for advice before he made any kind of move.
<br><br>
"Its first appearance that the boy from the Three Eyes race mentioned occurred in the 83rd chaos, the 5th chaotic era after our human race entered the Grand Plain Stage," explained the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "Nine of the human race entered the Eternal Scroll Painting and none returned. If I had entered with them, I fear I would not have come back either."
<br><br>
Back then, the human race's power in the Grand Plain Stage was not small and there were certainly a large number of human warriors strong enough to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting every time.
<br><br>
And yet even the Primeval Lord of Heaven would have had no chance of coming out victoriously against the Evil Orochi. Zen made his mind up fast and decided to give up on entering the third page and would instead wait for the end of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Just then, as many Other Shore creatures accepted their choice to give up, a black light flashed from below their gaze.
<br><br>
This left everyone stunned. 'Is this another gigantic snake?' they wondered.
<br><br>
Once they had transformed into pictures, they couldn't look in all directions.
<br><br>
From their vantage point, the end and exit of the maze were above the other parts. But the flash had come from below.
<br><br>
"Is that... Another huge snake?"
<br><br>
"T... Two snakes?"
<br><br>
"Will it come in?"
<br><br>
Some trembling voices spoke their fears.
<br><br>
Encountering an Evil Orochi was already incredibly unlucky.
<br><br>
The Eternal Scroll Painting had opened and closed countless times and the Evil Orochi only appeared five times. But there were no records in history of two appearing at once! Everyone discussed in shaky voices and then the Evil Orochi swept past them from below once more while another passed overhead. These two snakes now blocked off everyone in the passageway.
<br><br>
Fortunately, they just passed by and disappeared in seconds.
<br><br>
But even their shadows flashing past in the blink of an eye was terrifying for all the Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
"Do you think they can enter this passageway?" asked one of the creatures.
<br><br>
With this question hanging out there, everyone's nerves rattled much more.
<br><br>
They had not been told of any safe areas in the No-break Maze, but those who had been unwilling to rush forward would wait in this passageway, hoping it was safe enough.
<br><br>
But was it really safe? "It... It should be safe here..." another creature replied, quivering in fear.
<br><br>
"Well, generally, Other Shore creatures at the end of the maze won't come in," said Kirk confidently.
<br><br>
"But that Evil Orochi doesn't come from the end," said Egan, frowning.
<br><br>
Several abnormalities had occurred in the Eternal Scroll Painting this time and now the impossible seemed to be unfolding before them. Who was to say whether this passageway was safe or not? Egan's words shrouded everyone's hearts in an ominous dark cloud. "Shut up!" screamed Walden.
<br><br>
Egan had long been displeased with the Violet Cloud race and replied coldly, "I was talking to my friends!"
<br><br>
"You!"
<br><br>
Just as Walden was about to retort, the Evil Orochi swept across again from below. This time, halfway through, it suddenly drilled into the passageway.
<br><br>
Their greatest fear was being realized.
<br><br>
They had remained vigilant in the passageway; still and cautious. So the moment they saw the Evil Orochi rush into the passageway, they all rushed upwards.
<br><br>
If they stayed there, they would surely die. Rushing to the exit of the maze at least gave them a chance at survival, even if only a small one.
<br><br>
Chapter 3817 Keep Making Turns The first to rush upwards were the three Other Shore creatures of the Wind Wave race.
<br><br>
The Wind Wave race was one of the ancient races on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Although they had also submitted to the Element Spirit Civilization, their status was much higher than that of the Violet Cloud race. The Eternal Realm masters of the Wind Wave race even had a certain influence within the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
This time, the Wind Wave race was quite lucky. Among the four members they sent into the Eternal Scroll Painting, only one died on the first page.
<br><br>
The moment the second Evil Orochi appeared, the three members of the Wind Wave race guessed that it would likely rush up along the passage, so they quietly crept upward ahead of everyone.
<br><br>
They were already in the lead, and when the Evil Orochi below really did rush up, they immediately took to their heels.
<br><br>
"Rush out as fast as we can!"
<br><br>
"We'll be safe as long as we can come out of the maze!"
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
The three members of the Wind Wave race also had a strong desire to survive.
<br><br>
They didn't know whether or not they could successfully break out of the maze. However, they knew that if they continued to stay where they were, they would definitely die.
<br><br>
Although the chance of making it out alive was slim to none, they could only continue to fight for their survival! Nevertheless, what happened next just completely extinguished their hope.
<br><br>
The huge black snake hiding at the end of the passage suddenly came out of its hiding spot and slithered towards them at a lightning speed. Its jaws were wide open. The last thing the three of them saw before they were swallowed was an endless, slimy, black hole inside the snake's fanged mouth.
<br><br>
Everything happened in a matter of seconds. The three disappeared without even leaving a tiny bit of scream, much less traces of blood on the scene.
<br><br>
But it was actually such a quietly creeping death that planted an indescribable fear in the hearts of the others. Lives had disappeared before they even knew what was happening.
<br><br>
Almost right after those three Other Shore creatures were swallowed, three streaks of bloody light fell on three of the Three Purities Stones in the Grand Plain Stage. The area where they fell was precisely the territory of the Wind Wave race. Upon seeing the bloody lights, the members of the Wind Wave race waiting outside immediately roared in anger.
<br><br>
Each race had suffered heavy losses this time, except for the Wind Wave race, which only had one member dead. The Wind Wave race had been secretly rejoicing in their hearts because of this. How could they possibly think that they would lose the remaining three people at the same time? The surviving Other Shore creatures in the passage were practically beside themselves with dread. The path ahead was blocked, and the pursuer behind was hot on their trail—they really had their back against the wall now...
<br><br>
But in this situation, they had no time to ponder about other ways to go out.
<br><br>
The passage wasn't long, and the Evil Orochi below would soon come up.
<br><br>
Even though the three members of the Wind Wave race were swallowed by the other Evil Orochi, they still had to continue to rush up! The next four Other Shore creatures that rushed up were quite lucky. Maybe because it had just swallowed three people, the Evil Orochi couldn't change its direction fast enough to bite those four.
<br><br>
Seeing the success of the four creatures, Zen and the others immediately followed their lead and rushed up as fast as they could.
<br><br>
Thus, the usually tranquil world inside the scroll painting was now full of hustle and bustle as creatures that had transformed into paintings were all running for their lives.
<br><br>
At the end of the maze, there were many crisscrossing passages, dividing the area into many smaller squares. Upon arriving at the intersection, Zen and the Other Shore creatures immediately changed their direction and went into the passage paralleled to the one they came from.
<br><br>
Just right after they stepped into the passage, the Evil Orochi from below caught up with them.
<br><br>
Two Other Shore creatures didn't dodge fast enough and ended up in its belly.
<br><br>
"How miserable..."
<br><br>
Kirk's face paled in fear upon personally witnessing the two creatures being swallowed alive. As he was a picture now, he could also see his paper-white face.
<br><br>
In comparison, Zen and Egan looked much calmer.
<br><br>
Zen, needless to say, had experienced life-and-death crises none of these creatures had experienced before or would experience in the future. Almost nothing could shock him now. Besides, he had long learned that neither panic nor fear would be of much help in the face of mortal dangers.
<br><br>
As for Egan, he had been relying on his own ability to venture in Stage Thirteen for a long time. The crises he went through in his journey had honed both his abilities and guts.
<br><br>
"The way the Evil Orochi moves is very strange," whispered Zen, who had pasted himself to the wall in the passage.
<br><br>
"Yes, its speed seems to be fast only when it moves in a straight line," an Other Shore creature replied.
<br><br>
This creature also had herself pasted to the wall. She was small and had a pair of pointed ears on top of her head. Her body was half-human, half-fox.
<br><br>
Because she was in the form of a painting now, her detailed features were almost inconspicuous.
<br><br>
What this "fox" said made Zen subconsciously take a few more glances at her.
<br><br>
Most Other Shore creatures in their group were already in panic by now.
<br><br>
They only thought about how terrifying the Evil Orochis were and how to escape. This fox, however, remained calm and assessed the opponent. She also seemed to have come to the same conclusion as him.
<br><br>
"It should be so." Zen nodded at her.
<br><br>
Just now, when the Evil Orochi made a turn and entered the passage where they took shelter, the speed at which it changed its direction was extremely slow.
<br><br>
Had it been able to change direction quickly at that time, all of them would've been killed, including Zen.
<br><br>
"If the Evil Orochis can't change their direction quickly, doesn't it mean they are quite easy to deal with?"
<br><br>
The gears in Egan's mind turned at a lightning speed. A glimmer of hope for survival had completely rejuvenated him.
<br><br>
There were many huge square areas at the end of the No-break Maze, and each of those areas had countless rooms with hexagram arrays inside.
<br><br>
In such a layout, there would be many corners at which they could turn no matter where they went.
<br><br>
The speed of the Evil Orochis was unbelievably fast. Even the Violet Cloud race, which was well-known for their quick speed, couldn't outrun or dodge them. But if they could only change their directions slowly, the threat they posed on the remaining Other Shore creatures would be greatly reduced.
<br><br>
At this moment, the Evil Orochi that rushed past them had turned around and was now rushing back to the intersection. Its speed was still incredibly fast.
<br><br>
But when it rushed to Zen's side, its speed suddenly became extremely slow. It slowly turned its head and entered the horizontal passage where Zen and the others were! "It-it's turning around!" An Other Shore creature exclaimed with a trembling voice.
<br><br>
While the Evil Orochi slowly turned its body, its head was already a few feet away from where they were hiding.
<br><br>
"Let's make a turn and move to another passage," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
As the passage where they were now was a horizontal one, he, Egan, and the others turned at one of the corners and entered a vertical one.
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil Orochi entered the horizontal passage, it found that its prey had all fled to the vertical one. After a moment of surprise, it slowly turned its head and followed after them.
<br><br>
However, a slow Evil Orochi wasn't a threat to them.
<br><br>
They continued to move back and forth between the horizontal and the vertical passages. Slowly but surely, they crept upward bit by bit.
<br><br>
Their speed wasn't fast either, but by moving this way, they were moving closer and closer towards the exit of the maze. As they continued to slowly make their way towards the exit, the rekindled hope in their hearts continued to grow brighter.
<br><br>
"It seems… the Evil Orochis aren't as powerful as people said..." an Other Shore creature said with a trace of disdain.
<br><br>
"What's so terrifying about animals that can't even turn at a corner?"
<br><br>
another Other Shore creature replied with a laugh.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, if it was so easy to deal with those snakes, how could so many Other Shore creatures become their victims before? Zen didn't say anything. He always felt that something was wrong with this whole thing.
<br><br>
If the Evil Orochis were really that easy to deal with, people wouldn't have put the word "evil" in its name. After all, those who could enter the Eternal Scroll Painting were all supposed to reach the Eternal Realm. They were all smart and would never do something without a good cause.
<br><br>
Just as they moved to another horizontal passage from a vertical one, a black shadow suddenly flew towards them from a distance at a high speed.
<br><br>
It was the other Evil Orochi! Chapter 3818 A Dead End When the Other Shore creatures went through the horizontal and vertical passageways, they were so focused on the first Evil Orochi that they completely ignored the second one.
<br><br>
Forgotten by them, the second Evil Orochi changed its direction in a farther distance. Just as the Other Shore creatures turned around the corner of the passageway, they happened to come face to face with the Evil Orochi.
<br><br>
This sudden meeting stunned some of the creatures.
<br><br>
"Charge!" Zen roared with a raised fist.
<br><br>
He arched his back and used almost all of his strength to charge to the side.
<br><br>
There was no going back now. The only choice they had was to dash forward.
<br><br>
It wasn't just Zen who did that. All the Other Shore creatures were also adamant in fighting their way forward. In the face of death, desperation often gave way to explosive power.
<br><br>
As soon as they rushed forward, this Evil Orochi dashed towards them! It was a silent death attack from the black snake shadow.
<br><br>
As the two parties were about to collide, the Other Shore creatures couldn't help but look daggers at the Evil Orochi with the hopes that it would at least slow down.
<br><br>
Egan and Kirk were in the middle of the oncoming group with Zen following closely after the latter.
<br><br>
The next moment, Zen felt a terrifying force hit his body. He was not swallowed up by the Evil Orochi, but he was hit by it. The powerful wave of energy made him spin quickly like a spinning top. It took a long while for him to stop.
<br><br>
When he stopped, Zen looked down at his body and was extremely shocked by what he saw.
<br><br>
The surface of his own painting was covered with cracks, and pain emanated from every single part of his body. There was no denying just how extremely serious his injuries were.
<br><br>
Because of the wounds he sustained, the Chaotic Source Spirits naturally fell into fatigue. The force of the impact actually exceeded one hundred thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
However, Zen was still lucky. The same could not be said for the Other Shore creatures behind him.
<br><br>
Two Other Shore creatures had also been hit.
<br><br>
These two also cultivated the Myriad Tribulations Body, but they couldn't withstand the terrifying impact and their bodies shattered immediately. All that was left of them were broken limbs strewn all over the ground.
<br><br>
As paintings in the scroll painting, however, they were not that bloody.
<br><br>
Those who were even more unfortunate got swallowed up by the Evil Orochi and did not even have time to scream.
<br><br>
Egan, who stood not that far away from Zen, quickly checked on him.
<br><br>
"Zen! Are you okay?" he asked.
<br><br>
Zen felt the atmosphere grow a bit strange and stifling as everyone's gaze focused on him.
<br><br>
"I'm slightly injured but I'm fine," he assured Egan.
<br><br>
Slightly injured? He was slightly injured? The Other Shore creatures couldn't help but scoff in disbelief.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures that were able to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting must have cultivated the Myriad Tribulations Body.
<br><br>
Due to this fact, everyone shared the same threshold in terms of enduring a strike.
<br><br>
Even though Zen had obtained a few more Bone Tribulation Imprints than them, and they could only bear eighty thousand divine megatons of power while he could bear one hundred thousand divine megatons of power, the gap between them could not possibly be so big.
<br><br>
The two unfortunate Other Shore creatures behind Zen earlier were respectively from the Reverse Training race and the Iron Lineage race.
<br><br>
These two races were famous for their strong bodies. After they obtained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies, their bodies were expected to be much stronger than ordinary Myriad Tribulations Bodies.
<br><br>
However, they shattered just like that while Zen remained standing.
<br><br>
A few cracks littered his body but other than that, he was fine.
<br><br>
Egan couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief. "That's good then. Let's continue to move upwards."
<br><br>
The extent of Zen's strength was a mystery to them and it was Zen's secret, so Egan naturally did not ask.
<br><br>
How his physical body remained intact despite that wave of overwhelming force would remain a secret and the Other Shore creatures knew that there was no way Zen would answer if they asked. Still, that did not mean that it wouldn't be a hot topic amongst them.
<br><br>
"I heard that absorbing Chaotic Source Spirits is a unique method to strengthen one's physical body in the chaos."
<br><br>
"I've heard about that too, a long time ago, but it's not really worth mentioning. Those are just creatures from the Chaotic Source Sea in Stage Twenty-two of the Other Shore. Even if they use those creatures to the extreme, they would only be able to withstand ten to twenty thousand divine megatons of power."
<br><br>
"Then how was he able to block the Evil Orochi's attack?"
<br><br>
"I don't know. If you want, then why not ask him?"
<br><br>
Everyone constantly moved and shifted between the horizontal and vertical passageways, slowly moving towards the No-break Maze's exit.
<br><br>
The space at the exit wasn't very large and everyone grew even more excited as they got closer.
<br><br>
Nobody had ever passed through the area guarded by the Evil Orochi, so they felt a sense of pride for having accomplished such a feat.
<br><br>
However, Zen and several Other Shore creatures remained cautious. There was no way it was going to be so easy, right? "Everyone move to the left! The second Evil Orochi is on the other side!"
<br><br>
The shout came from the Other Shore creature who was half-human and half-fox, guiding everyone towards the next passageway.
<br><br>
They hadn't noticed the second Evil Orochi earlier and suffered a great loss.
<br><br>
Since the fox led the way, they naturally followed.
<br><br>
"Move to the upper right!"
<br><br>
"Upper left!"
<br><br>
"Upper right..."
<br><br>
With the fox's continuous command, everyone quickly traversed the squares as the two Evil Orochis could only slowly twist their heads, unable to speed up.
<br><br>
"Upper right!"
<br><br>
"Upper right!"
<br><br>
"Upper right again!"
<br><br>
As they listened to the fox's instructions, nobody noticed the corners of her mouth rise and reveal a mocking smile.
<br><br>
"Eh!" someone remarked when noticing something was wrong.
<br><br>
"If we keep moving to the upper right, won't we be led farther and farther away from the exit?"
<br><br>
The exit was located in the middle of the No-break Maze's end. If they kept heading towards the upper right, they would get farther and farther away.
<br><br>
"How did you lead the way?"
<br><br>
"Should we change directions?"
<br><br>
"We should, right?"
<br><br>
Just as everyone was blaming her, the fox stopped and laughed. "You only noticed now. You're all truly too dull."
<br><br>
Her words made Zen and the others frown.
<br><br>
At that moment, the two Evil Orochis suddenly appeared and blocked their path from both sides. Having bypassed several crisscrossed roads, these two were able to trap the warriors.
<br><br>
This fox deliberately led them to a dead end.
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes were heavy with anger as they stared at the fox. "Why did you do that?"
<br><br>
"Why do you want to harm us?"
<br><br>
"If you lead us to a dead end, you'll die too!"
<br><br>
Everyone's faces paled as they stared at the two Evil Orochis that surrounded them. Their fear was also coupled with great puzzlement.
<br><br>
Why did the fox bring everyone here when she was also an Other Shore creature? "In the Grand Plain Stage, is there an Other Shore race whose members are half-human and half-fox?" Zen asked out of the blue. Silence was the only reply he received.
<br><br>
Though there were all sorts of Other Shore races in the Grand Plain Stage, there wasn't really any sort of half-human and half-fox race. Could it be that this creature was not an Other Shore creature? Chapter 3819 Food The forms of the Other Shore creatures who entered the Eternal Scroll Painting had undergone a great change. Thus, as the "fox" traveled through the maze looking very similar to the others, they had taken her without doubt as one of their own.
<br><br>
However, Zen's words raised everyone's suspicions.
<br><br>
"Are you a beast of the scroll painting?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
The fox stood nearby, and spoke in a disdainful tone. "That's the name given by you stupid creatures."
<br><br>
As an intelligent being, she was very dissatisfied about being named a beast.
<br><br>
"Anyway, it doesn't matter," said the fox, giving a short laugh. "You are no different from the thousands of idiots who came before you. Like them, you will surely die."
<br><br>
As she spoke, she beckoned with her hand.
<br><br>
The two Evil Orochis, which had been blocking the way out, slowly crawled in the passageway.
<br><br>
Obviously, they were under her control.
<br><br>
"Thousands... You've killed thousands of creatures?" Egan asked, raising an eyebrow in surprise.
<br><br>
The fox smiled faintly. "Probably more, but I've forgotten the exact number."
<br><br>
"Did you kill them with the help of the Evil Orochis? That's impossible.
<br><br>
The Evil Orochi had only appeared a few times," said Kirk.
<br><br>
According to the records of the Grand Plain Stage, the Evil Orochi had only appeared five times in known history. At the first time, it had killed all the creatures; on the other four occasions, some Other Shore creatures had survived by directly choosing to quit.
<br><br>
The fox snorted. "You think I really need the Evil Orochi to kill you idiots?"
<br><br>
she said sarcastically. "Use your head and search your memories. You must remember that your people had been all killed several times in the Eternal Scroll Painting."
<br><br>
The test in the Eternal Scroll Painting was notoriously difficult. Many people gave up when they realized they could not survive, but many others chose to keep going and attempt to pass the test.
<br><br>
When the Eternal Scroll Painting opened, it was not unusual for around thirty to fifty percent of those who entered to perish in the test. There were also rare occasions when not a single creature survived—all were killed for some unknown reason.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures in the Grand Plain Stage were all afraid of the Evil Orochi and several other powerful beasts in the painting. But at least these beasts were known, because those who survived their encounters with them recorded their appearance and nature once they had left the Eternal Scroll Painting alive.
<br><br>
However, there seemed to be one beast of the Eternal Scroll Painting who was absent from the records... because all who saw her were killed.
<br><br>
Many of the Other Shore creatures were beginning to realize their peril.
<br><br>
"What should we do now?" they asked, their voices trembling.
<br><br>
"There is nothing you can do but await your death," said the fox calmly.
<br><br>
"We'll kill you first!" someone shouted.
<br><br>
One of the creatures leapt out and rushed towards the fox.
<br><br>
At the same instant that the creature approached, the fox's body dwindled then diminished altogether. Like a projection, she vanished then reappeared on top of her attacker.
<br><br>
Before the creature knew what had happened, he was covered by the fox, who instantly slashed him into two.
<br><br>
If Zen could observe this scene from a more advanced perspective, he would see that this fox had instantly jumped out of the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting. The fox flipped her hands in the air and crossed them on the second page, tearing that creature's painting apart.
<br><br>
The painting of the creature ripped into two pieces instantly.
<br><br>
"It's the ability of the Worm Tapir," Zen murmured, frowning.
<br><br>
Others, including Egan and Kirk, had noticed the same thing.
<br><br>
They had planned to rush forward to subdue the fox, but her strength and mode of attack were terrifying. Even if they all united and tried to attack a Worm Tapir at the same time, they would find it difficult, if not impossible, to win against it.
<br><br>
"Who else is ready to die here?" the fox asked. Her figure was quickly returning to normal, until it was completely restored on the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"You are very powerful, and you can control the Evil Orochis. Why don't you just kill us directly?" Zen asked in a low voice.
<br><br>
The two Evil Orochis had already had them cornered, under her control.
<br><br>
If she had simply wanted to kill all of them, it would have been unnecessary for her to lead them all the way to the upper right corner of the maze.
<br><br>
Those who heard Zen's question pricked up their ears, listening anxiously.
<br><br>
Judging from how harshly the fox had spoken to them so far, they wondered what answer she would give, and knew it would be unpleasant.
<br><br>
"It's too wasteful to let the Evil Orochis swallow you," the fox said casually.
<br><br>
"There are still many 'beasts of scroll painting' you mentioned waiting for food..."
<br><br>
With that, the fox turned and walked up the right corner of the passageway.
<br><br>
Two Evil Orochis appeared from both sides, approaching the group of Other Shore creatures, whose skin tingled with dread.
<br><br>
None wanted to follow the lead of the fox. However, the Evil Orochis limited their options. Maybe the fox would harm them, but the Evil Orochis would definitely kill them right now if they tried to retreat.
<br><br>
Escorted by the watchful eyes of the Evil Orochis, everyone slowly followed the fox.
<br><br>
They came to a stop when they saw that there were indeed some small beasts waiting at the end of the upper right corner. They looked like dogs.
<br><br>
Some of the Other Shore creatures immediately recognized them.
<br><br>
"Are those the Iron Dogs?"
<br><br>
"They are!"
<br><br>
"Are you going to feed us to them?"
<br><br>
The Iron Dog was very common in the first page. Many of Other Shore creatures in the group had seen and killed these beasts, so they naturally recognized them at a glance.
<br><br>
"Hmm?" the fox said distractedly. She glanced back at them. "You're right, they're Iron Dogs. Very clever of you to recognize them so quickly."
<br><br>
They didn't feel any pleasure at her praise.
<br><br>
All the Other Shore creatures had fallen silent. They had always been the great talents in the Grand Plain Stage, and even on the Other Shore. Now, for the first time, they were the prey—they were the ones facing defeat at the hands of a stronger opponent. They were entirely at the mercy of the fox.
<br><br>
Black despair began filling their thoughts, and their hearts felt heavy with dread.
<br><br>
Zen kept moving forward very slowly, quietly observing everything around him.
<br><br>
The end of the maze was comprised of squares, and many paths crisscrossed each other. At this point, however, every channel was blocked by the Evil Orochis, which prevented them from finding a way out.
<br><br>
As they crossed another horizontal passageway, following the fox, Zen suddenly paused briefly, his eyes fixed on something in the distance.
<br><br>
Two hexagram arrays were placed symmetrically on the right corner.
<br><br>
"Egan," Zen whispered.
<br><br>
Egan immediately followed Zen's gaze. Kirk and some other creatures also caught sight of the two arrays.
<br><br>
In fact, there were a lot of hexagram arrays at the end of the maze. Two such arrays would appear after they passed through every three passages.
<br><br>
Zen was thinking hard. The problem was that even if they managed to reach the arrays and regained their original forms, they still wouldn't be a match for the Evil Orochis who guarded them. No one had bothered to use that strategy against the Evil Orochis because it was no different from courting death.
<br><br>
But the situation was getting desperate.
<br><br>
No one was willing to be torn apart by the dogs and eaten as food.
<br><br>
If the result was death either way, then it was better to die fighting than to wait passively to be killed.
<br><br>
Many of the Other Shore creatures had reached the same conclusion.
<br><br>
When they moved past the next passageway, two groups of creatures rushed out on both sides.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, several Other Shore creatures had stepped into the hexagram arrays. They finally returned to their original forms. Yet they wore grim expressions, for they knew that they were still outmatched by the formidable opponent.
<br><br>
Still, they were also determined to put up a good fight. Regardless of the outcome, as long as they were in the arrays, they could at least fight with their real strength.
<br><br>
Chapter 3820 The Fox Girl The fox girl stood at the upper right corner of the No-break Maze, sneering at the scramble taking place below.
<br><br>
There were many rooms of hexagram arrays at the end of the maze; those unwilling to surrender would most likely attempt to escape into these rooms. She had expected them to follow this course of action.
<br><br>
"Do you seriously think resuming your original form will help you fight me? Unfortunately, none who came before you got away from me. Do you think you'll manage it? Hahaha..."
<br><br>
Her laughter was as crisp and sweet as wind chimes stirred by a gentle breeze, but it was lined with menace which shook all the Other Shore creatures to their bones and made them shiver when they heard it.
<br><br>
She then slowly turned away from the upper right corner.
<br><br>
"She's coming down!"
<br><br>
"Does she plan to enter the hexagram arrays?"
<br><br>
"She's not going to let the Evil Orochis attack instead? She's going to fight on her own?"
<br><br>
Everyone trembled in fear.
<br><br>
They might have returned to their original forms, but they were still not confident they could contend with the Evil Orochis.
<br><br>
If she drove the giant serpents right into the rooms, they'd all be destroyed with ease. Even if they possessed some truly special skills, dealing with the Evil Orochis would still prove mightily difficult.
<br><br>
But it seemed the fox intended to go in alone.
<br><br>
She stopped in the center where the passages intersected. Zen, Egan, Kirk and some other Other Shore creatures were in the room of hexagon array on the left, while Walden and another group were in the room on the right.
<br><br>
A short while later, she had made her choice and walked towards the room on the right.
<br><br>
When the creatures, including Walden, saw her coming, their eyes widened and their hearts began beating vigorously.
<br><br>
They had no way to effectively deal with the Evil Orochis but they believed they might stand a chance against the fox alone.
<br><br>
They had appeared to be stuck in a dead end but it now seemed a favorable opportunity that they would all seize desperately.
<br><br>
"Everyone, spread out!"
<br><br>
"She controls the Evil Orochis, so if we capture her, the snakes will be forced to retreat..."
<br><br>
"Don't hold anything back. Do whatever is necessary using whatever you have!"
<br><br>
They had all been cowering in the corner of the room, but now, in the face of battle, they summoned all the courage in their hearts and stood in a semicircle, surrounding the door. They gathered all the strength they had in their bodies.
<br><br>
The fox stepped into the room and onto the hexagram array, revealing her true form.
<br><br>
She looked like a little girl of thirteen or fourteen years old with two fluffy ears on her head, her body emitting a faint halo. She was as flawless as white jade, her light purple hair covering most of her baby fat face.
<br><br>
"This form is truly disgusting..." the fox remarked at her own body.
<br><br>
As a beast in the scroll painting, she believed her painting form to be at a higher level and that this one contained too many details and was lowgrade.
<br><br>
"Let's get her!"
<br><br>
Walden bellowed his war cry the second she turned into her normal form.
<br><br>
He shifted his body slightly and a purple jade token appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
He pinched the token and crushed it to powder.
<br><br>
As it shattered, a purple shadow burst forth, releasing a vast aura as it did.
<br><br>
The aura was confined to the room and the intense pressure it gave off forced everyone to take a few steps back.
<br><br>
Only the fox girl seemed unfazed and stood motionlessly.
<br><br>
"It's the Blessing Myriad Token! It seems to be of a high grade!"
<br><br>
"The Violet Cloud race is so generous that they have allowed this man to take this token!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
A flame of hope ignited in the Other Shore creatures' hearts when they saw the purple shadow.
<br><br>
The Blessing Myriad Token came from Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
There was a mountain known as the Blessing Mountain where there were life forms of pure energy. These life forms were similar to pure energy entities, gentle in nature and numerous in number.
<br><br>
Once they perished, they would fuse into a kind of purple jade found in the mountain and stay there.
<br><br>
The more lives fused into a piece of jade, the higher grade it would be.
<br><br>
Divided according to their colors, there were a total of six grades of the Blessing Myriad Token. The sixth grade was the highest and was considered a lethal weapon in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
This Blessing Myriad Token was a personal token of Walden's grandfather, who had kept it for many years but never used it. His grandfather had given it to him for protection before he entered Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
It had never occurred to Walden that he might use it in the Eternal Scroll Painting. Now that the fox girl had given them a shot at survival, he cared about little else. His life was obviously more important than the precious token.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The fox girl's head was shrouded in the purple shadow containing pure energy. She gingerly raised her hand, her two light pink nails intertwined and flicked gently.
<br><br>
She seemed to have triggered something that spread from her fingertips.
<br><br>
The wildly surging purple shadow was suppressed in an instant and it shrank and disappeared.
<br><br>
Walden was in a daze when his chest was suddenly hit by a heavy hammer that sent him into the wall with a thud.
<br><br>
He leaned against the wall, his muscles, bones and blood imploding. His entire body was almost completely crushed. His soul hadn't been seriously injured but he only had a single breath left.
<br><br>
"They don't like eating dead things," the fox girl said, looking at his body, disappointed.
<br><br>
She stretched her pink finger slowly and removed Walden from the wall, dragged him to the hexagram array and threw him from the room.
<br><br>
The instant he was thrown, his body split into pieces. The broken pieces turned into pictures and scattered on the white scroll in a gruesome scene.
<br><br>
The Iron Dogs in the upper right corner caught the smell of blood, crawled along the passage and began devouring Walden's broken body.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures still in the room trembled violently. They couldn't help but be overtaken by the fear of being fed to the Iron Dogs.
<br><br>
"What a strange and horrible skill!"
<br><br>
"We're going to die anyway, let's at least go down fighting!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
They mustered the courage that remained in them and charged forward together.
<br><br>
The fox girl's face remained unchanged. She tapped her fingers lightly and her pink nails flicked out once more.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Waves of immense power pummeled into their chests. None of the Other Shore creatures, no matter their sizes, had any power capable of counterattacking. They were already on their last gasp when their bodies hit the wall.
<br><br>
With another flick of her finger, they too turned into pictures and like Walden, were thrown into the passage to feed the dogs.
<br><br>
After disposing of the last of them, she slowly turned towards the room across the corridor.
<br><br>
It was time to clear the left room.
<br><br>
Chapter 3821 Smash The doors of these two rooms with hexagram arrays were opposite each other.
<br><br>
Zen and the others stayed in the room on the left and saw what happened in the other room. All of them blanched in fear at the scene.
<br><br>
The fox girl's lips curved into a smile as she knew the Other Shore creatures in the left room were watching her. "I'm coming," she said.
<br><br>
Her tempting voice sounded like the final judgment of death, which sent a chill down everyone's spine.
<br><br>
"Retreat!"
<br><br>
"We have no choice but to fight her!"
<br><br>
"Fight? Even the Blessing Myriad Token had no effect on her. Do you have any better ideas than that?"
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures in the right room were by no means weak. They bravely fought back, but they still ended up dead! One of the most terrible things that could happen to anyone was to be unable to do anything in a desperate situation.
<br><br>
They silently watched the fox girl step out of the hexagram array, turn into a beautiful painting, and slowly walk towards them while they couldn't think of any solutions at all! "What kind of method did she use just now? It looked like she directly dissolved the energy in the Blessing Myriad Token," Egan said thoughtfully.
<br><br>
He was one of the few people who could remain composed.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen also thought hard about the same question.
<br><br>
The Blessing Myriad Token Walden had summoned was indeed quite powerful. Even if they weren't in the same room, Zen could sense its strength.
<br><br>
However, the fox girl didn't fight the Blessing Myriad Token directly.
<br><br>
Instead, it seemed that she had used a special method to dissolve its energy.
<br><br>
But how could she erase such an immense amount of energy in the Blessing Myriad Token without a trace? What kind of method was that? "I've never seen such a powerful method before. I didn't even know that someone so strong was hiding within the Eternal Scroll Painting," the Primeval Lord of Heaven commented.
<br><br>
If even the knowledgeable Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't understand what method she had used, then it was over. Zen's heart sank in despair.
<br><br>
Just then, Egan suddenly said, "I have a Soul-trapping Rope. If I can capture her with it, everything she will do will be useless!"
<br><br>
"A Soul-trapping Rope?! Is that true?"
<br><br>
At that moment, the miserable Other Shore creatures in the room quickly lit up with hope.
<br><br>
These Other Shore creatures who had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting were outstanding elites and highly valued in their respective races. Sure enough, they all carried some precious treasures with them.
<br><br>
"The only problem is if the Soul-trapping Rope will have any effect on the fox girl," said Egan hesitantly.
<br><br>
"Whether it will work or not, we still have to try," Zen said determinedly as his fighting intent rose in his chest.
<br><br>
According to his rich experience in fighting in desperate situations, those who were indecisive and hesitant always lost and died. On the other hand, they could still have a chance of survival if they launched a counterattack against the odds.
<br><br>
"Okay then," Egan said with just as much resolution.
<br><br>
Then, he took two steps forward and shook his right hand. A golden rope appeared on his arm and coiled around it like a snake.
<br><br>
As for Zen, he retreated to a side and stood beside the hexagram array.
<br><br>
Since the fox girl was a creature who lived in the Eternal Scroll Painting, she must be somehow different from them. Whether ordinary methods were effective against her or not was an important question, but they practically had no other choice at the moment.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the remaining Other Shore creatures retreated to the back of the room.
<br><br>
"This is useless..."
<br><br>
"She's just too invincible!"
<br><br>
"We all will die. We will truly die here today!"
<br><br>
After they witnessed the horrible scene in the other room, they lost their will to fight. They believed that it was useless to counterattack like what Zen and Egan did.
<br><br>
"Zen, I have a treasure that will protect you well," offered Kirk, who managed to conquer his fear.
<br><br>
In his hand was a small purple gourd. He pointed the gourd towards Zen and Egan as he spoke, then its opening emitted shimmering light films.
<br><br>
The rays of light floated in the air and gathered around Zen and Egan.
<br><br>
"This is the Heavenly Gourd Robe. It can help you withstand fifty thousand divine megatons of force," explained Kirk.
<br><br>
Fifty thousand divine megatons of force was a substantial amount of energy.
<br><br>
If Kirk's treasure and a Holy Soul's Chaotic Source Spirits were combined, then it would be enough to block an ordinary Eternal Realm master's attacks. Evidently, the Heavenly Gourd Robe was an extraordinary Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Zen and Egan held their breaths in concentration. The fox girl on the ground slowly moved into the room and approached the hexagram array.
<br><br>
She turned from a painting into a living creature, and her attractive figure quickly materialized in front of them. "Do it!" Zen commanded in a low voice.
<br><br>
With a flick of Egan's hand, the Soul-trapping Rope slipped from his arm and wrapped around the fox girl's body.
<br><br>
As soon as the Soul-trapping Rope wrapped around the fox girl, Zen's body unleashed his strength. Driven by tremendous power, his fist collided against the fox girl's head like a hammer to a nail.
<br><br>
In turn, all the other creatures in the room were stunned into silence.
<br><br>
The Blessing Myriad Token that Walden had just summoned was quite powerful, but Zen's punch contained nearly half of the same force. Did it mean that his physical strength was on par to half the power of the Blessing Myriad Token? Weren't Eternal Realm masters the only ones who possessed such a level of strength? All of the creatures present came to the Eternal Scroll Painting with the desire to reach the Eternal Realm, but Zen was already as strong as an Eternal Realm master! However, their current situation was extremely critical. Although everyone was shocked at Zen's display of strength, they were still worried about the fox girl and not him. Would his punch be enough to kill her? The fox girl, who was bound by the Soul-trapping Rope, did not have time to react before she saw a massive fist smash down her head.
<br><br>
Boom! Zen's eyes widened to the size of saucers when his fist hit the fox girl's skull. It worked! It seemed that the fox girl truly lost her powers and theurgies after the Soultrapping Rope bound her. Zen's fist broke her skull open, then blood and brains gushed out of it.
<br><br>
Although half of her head was gone, she was still alive. She raised her right hand and crossed two fingers together. It turned out that she wanted to use her strange theurgy! Crack! Crack! In return, Zen quickly twisted her slender arms and ruthlessly broke her bones in the process. That way, he prevented her from unleashing the strange law power from her fingertips.
<br><br>
It was a critical moment, so Zen naturally didn't show any mercy. After he broke her arms, he threw another punch to her chest. The strong force hit her chest so hard that it sent her petite body flying backward.
<br><br>
Because the hexagram array was in her path, she turned back into a painting on the ground as she flew out of the room. Finally, she hit the wall opposite the room, and her mangled body was torn into pieces.
<br><br>
The painting she turned into was no longer in a human shape but scattered on the ground like a broken sack.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Egan still tightly held on to the other end of the Soultrapping Rope.
<br><br>
Half of the rope was in its normal form, while the other half was entangled with the broken pieces of the painting outside the room. "Is she dead?"
<br><br>
Egan asked cautiously.
<br><br>
Even if Zen's attacks had mutilated the fox girl's body, he didn't dare retrieve the Soul-trapping Rope until he confirmed she was dead.
<br><br>
"If she was a normal Other Shore creature, she should have died," Zen said with a frown.
<br><br>
He had crushed her head and pierced her chest. Even an Eternal Realm master would've died from such serious injuries.
<br><br>
Those Other Shore creatures who had given up also stared at her damaged body on the ground. Zen's counterattack completely turned the tables, and they started to see the hope in survival.
<br><br>
However, their optimism only lasted for several seconds. About ten seconds later, the broken limbs suddenly moved.
<br><br>
Chapter 3822 Glazed Body Everyone's hearts stopped when they saw the broken limbs on the ground suddenly move.
<br><br>
Was she still alive? Creatures that had reached the True God Realm possessed immensely strong and persistent life energy. To lose hands, legs, and even internal organs wasn't a big deal.
<br><br>
However, even when warriors reached the Other Shore Realm, their two most important body parts, namely the soul and the cinnabar field, couldn't sustain serious injuries. If their cinnabar field was destroyed, they would lose all their cultivation; if it was their soul, then they would die.
<br><br>
None of the creatures Zen had encountered could break such a rule. Even the Blood Spirit Tortoise, one of the top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos, was no exception. It would die like the others if its Soul of Light was damaged.
<br><br>
Just now, Zen showed no mercy at all to the fox girl, with the only desire to kill her.
<br><br>
His powerful attack had crushed her into pieces—but she was still alive? "She... is fine?"
<br><br>
"What kind of monster is she? Her soul was not hurt at all?"
<br><br>
"This is impossible..."
<br><br>
At first, everyone assumed that Zen and Egan had killed the fox girl. They felt ecstatic as they thought that they could finally escape death, but now, it didn't seem like it.
<br><br>
The maimed limbs on the ground moved slowly, and at the same time, the black clumps merged and reconstructed.
<br><br>
By the time the pool of black clumps and body parts reached the door of the room, it already took the shape of the fox girl.
<br><br>
"She's back," Egan said bitterly.
<br><br>
"Then let's do it again," Zen answered indifferently.
<br><br>
In any case, there was no other efficient way to deal with the fox girl now.
<br><br>
If they could still tear her to pieces, then they would do it all over again.
<br><br>
There was no way the fox could be reborn infinitely! Egan had already pulled back his Soul-trapping Rope. However, when the fox girl entered the hexagram array again, he quickly tossed the Soultrapping Rope to bind her once more.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen suddenly unleashed his power and blasted it towards the fox girl.
<br><br>
However, the fox girl's body now shone with a glassy luster. Her snowwhite skin became translucent, and her body became extraordinarily strong after her transformation.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The moment she saw Zen's fist coming at her, she had already raised her hand and smoothly grabbed it.
<br><br>
She had effortlessly blocked a punch that contained eighty thousand divine megatons of force! "Do you think the rope can trap me?"
<br><br>
The fox girl grabbed his fist with one hand and the Soul-trapping Rope with the other.
<br><br>
"It can't?" Egan narrowed his eyes.
<br><br>
He already had a bad feeling when he saw the fox girl's skin become a glazed color. If the Soul-trapping Rope had restrained her, she wouldn't be able to change into such a state. The only possible explanation was that the rope had lost its effect on her.
<br><br>
At that point, the fox girl grabbed the Soul-trapping Rope and slightly pulled it. The other end of the rope slipped from Egan's grip, and then she casually threw it on the ground. Her big eyes shifted to Zen, and a smile graced her translucent face. "You haven't given up yet? The rest gave up already."
<br><br>
Most of the Other Shore creatures in the room lost their will to fight. They either pinned their hopes on Zen who still fought, or waited for death. Only Egan and Kirk looked determined to battle.
<br><br>
However, the man in front of her was completely different. His eyes burned with fire, and although he was silent, his fighting spirit fiercely surged inside him. He had no intention of giving up.
<br><br>
"Why should I give up?" he shot back.
<br><br>
He opened his eyes and put his hand on the fox girl's shoulder.
<br><br>
After the fox girl's body became translucent, it became smooth and extremely tough. Zen tightly grasped her shoulder and swept her off the ground, then forcefully threw her behind him.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The energy waves from the impact spread out in all directions. Those Other Shore creatures who leaned against the wall felt that it was so strong that they could hardly breathe.
<br><br>
The Instant Civilization had built the room that contained the hexagram array using rules, and it was almost unbreakable. Since the ground was quite solid, it caused a loud collision.
<br><br>
However, the fox girl with the glazed body did not have any cracks on her body.
<br><br>
Her body still remained upside down and she looked at Zen with a mocking smile. "Ninety thousand divine megatons of force? Is this your limit?" she sneered.
<br><br>
In a close combat, Zen could release about two hundred thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
The only thing was, his Chaotic Source Spirits would be temporarily exhausted. Although the time was short, it was still quite dangerous.
<br><br>
Therefore, he made sure that he released no more than one hundred thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
As he looked at the fox girl's mocking expression, he kicked her high into the air. Then, he bent down and released a large amount of force.
<br><br>
Afterward, he threw another punch at her chest.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
In turn, the fox girl flew away and slammed into the wall.
<br><br>
She landed beside an Other Shore creature who trembled violently in fear. If she had hit him, then he would've died already.
<br><br>
"That's not enough," the fox girl said with a taunting smile. She was getting serious in killing him.
<br><br>
At that moment, her body's translucent glazed color gradually faded away.
<br><br>
Zen gently raised his left hand and winked at Egan. "Egan!"
<br><br>
Swish! A gust of wind blew as the Soul-trapping Rope wound around her body once again.
<br><br>
As soon as the Soul-trapping Rope tied the fox girl, her face froze for a moment. She hurriedly put her slender index finger and thumb together, but she couldn't trigger the power of the theurgy. The Soul-trapping Rope had taken effect.
<br><br>
Her eyebrows shot up as her somewhat childish face sneered. She felt humiliated now that they saw through her. "Very good. Since you want to die more miserably, I'll satisfy you!" she scowled.
<br><br>
It turned out that the Soul-trapping Rope worked after all. At the very least, it stopped her from putting her fingers together and using the strange theurgy. She could still turn into her glazed form but was unable to use the theurgy.
<br><br>
It was Zen's idea. Earlier, when the fox girl had snatched the Soul-trapping Rope and threw it on the ground, he secretly asked Egan to pick it up through his chaotic energy.
<br><br>
Even though he didn't know what tricks and theurgies the fox girl had up her sleeves, he couldn't withstand the strange power she released when she put her index finger and thumb together. With the help of the Soul-trapping Rope, he could at least prevent her from using that kind of theurgy.
<br><br>
Just then, her skin turned into the glazed color again. At the same time, she stretched out her hand then tried to snatch the Soul-trapping Rope.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Egan was very smart. He pulled back the Soul-trapping Rope in time and watched over the fox girl vigilantly.
<br><br>
He knew that it was a life-and-death battle, so he was not afraid of offending her.
<br><br>
"In that case, I'll just kill you!"
<br><br>
The fox girl didn't want to play the seesaw game with Egan. Her face became filled with rage, and she immediately stabbed the head of the Other Shore creature beside her with her glazed hand.
<br><br>
"Pop!"
<br><br>
The head of the Other Shore creature exploded like a watermelon.
<br><br>
In the next moment, her petite body, which didn't reach Zen's chest, crashed against him.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
As a result, Zen was thrown away and crashed against the wall on the other side.
<br><br>
The fox girl was very confident in her glazed body, and that was exactly what he wanted.
<br><br>
Chapter 3823 Breaking The Defense When Zen hit the wall, he turned over to give the fox girl a surprise attack.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
A loud rumble that came after almost deafened Zen.
<br><br>
After slamming into the wall, the fox girl turned around expressionlessly.
<br><br>
"Your reaction speed isn't bad, but… it's not nearly impressive!"
<br><br>
Zen's face darkened before his body turned over once again.
<br><br>
But the fox's speed was far superior to Zen's. Before he could move, a hand grabbed his arm.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The fox lifted him up like nothing and threw him right back down to the ground.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The two had extremely tough bodies, carrying terrifying strength. Every time Zen smashed into the ground, an invisible shock wave would spread.
<br><br>
Those Other Shore creatures also became smart. As long as the two of them had any tendency of getting near them, they would hide far away, afraid of being hurt from the impact.
<br><br>
With such a terrifying power, anyone who was hit by the slightest shock wave would die or at least get crippled.
<br><br>
Every time the fox girl threw Zen down, the Other Shore creatures trembled. While they feared the fox, they were all the more amazed by Zen.
<br><br>
No wonder both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race wanted him.
<br><br>
The guy's body was extremely strong indeed.
<br><br>
Egan, on the other hand, seemed worried.
<br><br>
While Zen's physical body was undoubtedly strong, he couldn't withstand the situation if it was prolonged. Regardless of what kind of theurgy Zen used to stabilize his body, the fox's brute force was going to break it sooner or later.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang..."
<br><br>
The Heavenly Gourd Robe Kirk released was highly unique. While it could withstand fifty thousand divine megatons of force, it carried an important feature—it could be reborn infinitely.
<br><br>
Each time the fox girl smashed Zen into the ground and the impact exceeded the fifty thousand divine megatons limit, the Heavenly Gourd Robe instantly shattered.
<br><br>
But just when she lifted Zen up, the Heavenly Gourd Robe instantly wrapped around Zen's entire body once again. In turn, the Heavenly Gourd Robe could actually be regarded as an enhanced version of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Naturally, the Heavenly Gourd Robe wasn't comparable to the Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's body. Its only shortcoming was that there was a time limit to its use.
<br><br>
When the Heavenly Gourd Robe and the Chaotic Source Spirits worked together to protect Zen's body, the latter could withstand one hundred and fifty thousand divine megatons of force directly.
<br><br>
The fox girl had used only a hundred thousand divine megatons of force in the first few strikes, bearing no damage to Zen.
<br><br>
But once she confirmed just how strong his body was, the fox girl didn't hesitate to increase the strength of her strikes.
<br><br>
One hundred and ten thousand divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
One hundred and twenty thousand divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
One hundred and thirty thousand divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
She figured Zen could only bear up to ninety thousand divine megatons of force because that was the most power he displayed in his previous attacks.
<br><br>
But it was becoming clear to her just how high Zen's tolerance was.
<br><br>
Still, she knew he was not completely invincible—if she continued increasing the power of her strikes one at a time, sooner or later, she knew she was going to shatter him to pieces.
<br><br>
"One hundred and forty thousand divine megatons of force!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
When Zen hit the ground, there was a sharp noise that resounded along with a loud rumble of impact.
<br><br>
The moment he hit the ground, Zen twisted his body suddenly like he was holding onto a wooden pole. He then grabbed the fox's glazed arm with both hands and feet.
<br><br>
A hundred and fifty thousand divine megatons of force was his limit.
<br><br>
Once the attack exceeded the limit of what his body could bear, the Chaotic Source Spirits would grow fatigued enough that his body could take damage—he absolutely had to fight back.
<br><br>
Just as he grabbed the fox girl's arm, ready to throw her back, the fox sneered, looking at him pitifully.
<br><br>
She was by no means inferior to Zen when it came to controlling strength.
<br><br>
When he leaned back, about to throw her out, the fox turned the situation around and rolled over agilely in the air, grabbing Zen.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Simultaneously, she landed and lifted Zen high in the air, ruthlessly throwing him to the wall. Her movements were highly skillful—she made no unnecessary movements.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The power that erupted from the impact had already reached a hundred and sixty thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Gourd Robe and Chaotic Source Spirits helped bear a hundred and fifty thousand divine megatons of force. The extra ten thousand had to be borne by Zen's physical body.
<br><br>
His Myriad Tribulations Body had nine Bone Tribulation Imprints—he was by no means weak. When he forcefully resisted the power of ten thousand divine megatons, he could only feel his blood roiling inside him and nothing else.
<br><br>
"Huh, you can withstand a hundred and sixty thousand divine megatons of force, I see. Let's continue, then." The fox walked toward him threateningly.
<br><br>
The smile she wore could easily be an innocent one, save for the terrifying threat hidden underneath.
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures knew Zen's body was strong, but they didn't know exactly what sort of great power he was enduring. Hearing just how powerful the force was made them gasp in disbelief.
<br><br>
Just how powerful was this man? Even after being smashed into the ground so many times, his body remained intact.
<br><br>
"One hundred and seventy thousand divine megatons of force…"
<br><br>
Before she even finished, she had already grabbed Zen's neck with her hand.
<br><br>
Initially, Zen wanted to dodge, but the fox already saw through him.
<br><br>
Shifting a foot in one direction, she caught him with accuracy.
<br><br>
At this moment, Zen grew anxious.
<br><br>
If the Chaotic Source Spirits were not exhausted, they could be continuously repaired.
<br><br>
But recovering from fatigue could take a while.
<br><br>
If he used his physical body to withstand the power of a hundred and seventy thousand divine megatons of force, even with the help of the Heavenly Gourd Robe, it would far exceed his limit.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Power burst out of Zen's arms, passing under the fox's arms and ready to lift her up.
<br><br>
When she was in the air, her feet swept past Zen's head and suddenly kicked into the wall.
<br><br>
Under the great counterforce, she once again grabbed Zen in the air, ready to smash him into the ground.
<br><br>
"Repair.."
<br><br>
Fear surfaced in Zen's eyes. The truth aura within his body was constantly surging—if the Chaotic Source Spirits weren't repaired, the attack could easily shatter him to pieces.
<br><br>
As he fell to the ground, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body lit up once again before recovering.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Zen's body had to withstand the extra twenty thousand divine megatons of force. His face turned red as his blood and energy surged radically.
<br><br>
"Your body protection theurgy can't withstand it anymore, I see?" The fox girl looked condescendingly down upon Zen.
<br><br>
The slight change in Zen's body could easily go unnoticed by anyone else, but not the fox girl. "It seems your limit should be a hundred and fifty thousand divine megatons of force. The further we go, the more difficult you'll find it to bear the power. I'd better send you to your death in one go!"
<br><br>
"Two hundred thousand divine megatons of force!"
<br><br>
In truth, Zen could actually bear exactly two hundred thousand divine megatons of force. But after the Chaotic Source Spirits grew completely tired, the limit was reduced by a hundred thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
When she increased her power to two hundred thousand divine megatons, she had every intention to kill him.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits in Zen's body were still fatigued when the fox's attack was falling—how could they dare to face it? And so Zen held his breath and shifted his body a foot away.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
The fox's glazed hand stabbed into Zen's chest, making blood spurt out like a sharp arrow.
<br><br>
A long lost feeling of pain rose in him. After obtaining the Chaotic Source Spirits, no one had ever really managed to hurt him.
<br><br>
The fox's hand that pierced Zen's body slashed down, heading for Zen's cinnabar field—she intended to completely destroy his inner world. If she succeeded, he'd lose all contact with his Other Shore Tokens, cutting off his very source of strength.
<br><br>
Fortunately, after Zen merged with a Chaos Ancient God's blood, the bones in his body had undergone a great change. The thick layers of sclerites abruptly blocked her hand.
<br><br>
Chapter 3824 One Opportunity Now that the sclerites were blocking her, the fox girl used her bloody hand to punch Zen in the stomach again.
<br><br>
Zen had expected this and twisted his body to avoid the blow.
<br><br>
A smile appeared at the corners of the fox girl's mouth. She had thought that Zen's struggle would be in vain. But this time, Zen also kicked at the ground, causing his whole body to be sent flying upwards.
<br><br>
The moment he bounced upwards, the tired Chaotic Source Spirits in his body were instantly repaired.
<br><br>
With a tell-tale swish, a cyan feather appeared above Zen's head. The feather was from the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
The moment this feather appeared, Zen's agility increased by leaps and bounds.
<br><br>
But this was far from enough.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven!"
<br><br>
The pages of the human race's blue book began to flip through and then it suddenly stopped, causing the green light somewhere in Zen's inner world to flash.
<br><br>
This was a pool built in the sky called the Phoenix Pool.
<br><br>
After the Primeval Lord of Heaven had occupied Zen's inner world, he had assigned many tasks to the humans. The Phoenix Pool was one of these tasks.
<br><br>
The energy souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess that remained were very weak. They had to make use of the Civilization Artifact of the human race.
<br><br>
The light of the book began to suddenly shimmer, green ripples appearing on the Phoenix Pool. Streaks of green light rushed out of Zen's inner world, blooming from the surface of Zen's body.
<br><br>
With the support of the two Civilization Artifacts, Zen's speed suddenly increased multi-fold.
<br><br>
The fox girl still wasn't taking Zen seriously. She wanted to grab him and dismember him, which, in her opinion, would take her less than fifteen seconds.
<br><br>
But the moment she made to grasp him, Zen, like a slippery eel, slipped out of her way.
<br><br>
Crack! He grabbed the fox girl from behind and threw her to the wall.
<br><br>
Boom! The fox girl's body was about to hit the wall when she bent her legs so that she ended up looking like she was striding across the wall. She stood there, horizontal and surprised, and said, "So your speed has increased! But it's still of no use. You can't hurt me with your strength. Your attack is just like a mere itch for me!"
<br><br>
She kicked off the wall and turned her body upside down, aiming at Zen's head.
<br><br>
If this kick were to hit him, it would become very difficult for Zen to escape or survive.
<br><br>
But thanks to his increased speed, Zen only had to tilt his shoulder slightly to dodge the powerful kick that contained over one hundred thousand divine megatons of power. The fox girl's attack spiraled out of control and landed on a different creature of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The room of the hexagram array was not large enough for the Other Shore creature to escape the attack. And by the time he had realized the danger he was in, it was too late.
<br><br>
Pop! The back of the fox girl's foot swept across the head of the Other Shore creature, causing it to explode into bubbles of blood. The Other Shore creature was now a headless corpse that shook violently for a while before falling to the ground. Blood flowed from the gaping hole in his neck.
<br><br>
The other creatures of the Other Shore trembled like rabbits coming face to face with a wolf. They didn't dare resist, only praying that Zen would kill this monster.
<br><br>
They couldn't react and move fast enough. Even if they remained curled up in the corner, they would be injured or killed during the battle if they didn't pay attention. This was worse than risking their lives and fighting the battle.
<br><br>
On the other hand, two Other Shore creatures had used their unique methods. One of them had turned his body into a grayish brown poisonous mist. He did not think his poisonous mist could defeat the fox girl, and had only used it to protect himself.
<br><br>
The other one curled up in a corner the size of a fist, which made him a much more difficult target to attack.
<br><br>
Zen finally got a chance to breathe after his speed increased.
<br><br>
Before the Chaotic Source Spirits recovered, he hadn't wanted to take on the fox girl. He had just relied on his nimble body to dodge her. But he had begun to do his own analyses during this time.
<br><br>
The fox girl's strength had increased almost every time she had attacked.
<br><br>
And now, her strength was close to two hundred thousand divine megatons! This meant that she could withstand a power of two hundred thousand divine megatons with her physical body.
<br><br>
The limit of the explosive strength from Zen's physical body was only two hundred thousand divine megatons. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to shatter the fox girl's glazed body.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Zen's body floated, narrowly avoiding the fox girl's attacks. Her strength had now increased to two hundred and twenty thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
Perhaps it was because of her incomparably strong body that the fox girl's attacks became more and more formidable with every strike.
<br><br>
"It's no use dodging this way." The fox girl sighed as she chased after him.
<br><br>
"Even if I gave you the chance to fight back, what could you do? The limit of power that my physical body can bear is far beyond your imagination."
<br><br>
She was of the opinion that even if she stood there and let Zen attack her at his full power, Zen probably wouldn't be able to injure her.
<br><br>
After the Chaotic Source Spirits had recovered, Zen had seized the opportunity and landed quite a few punches on the fox girl. His strength was controlled, at about ninety thousand divine megatons, and his attack could not cause any harm to her.
<br><br>
Bang! Zen moved behind her and kicked her back again. The kick contained nearly one hundred thousand divine megatons of power but she blocked it quite easily.
<br><br>
Egan and the others looked on in despair.
<br><br>
If Zen had displayed his full strength, they would be doomed this time.
<br><br>
After all, Zen could not hurt his opponent.
<br><br>
And in this narrow room, Zen would fail sooner or later, and one failure meant death.
<br><br>
"You should be able to control more than one hundred thousand divine megatons of power. Why don't you use it?"
<br><br>
The fox girl blocked Zen's attack and smiled as she turned around to grab him. But Zen had already floated away, avoiding the attack by inches.
<br><br>
Zen seemed abnormally calm in this battle.
<br><br>
There was still a chance as he could use the Celestial Spear.
<br><br>
When he had been in Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore, Zen had let Libby keep the Celestial Spear that he had obtained. Before entering the Eternal Scroll Painting, Zen returned in the form of the Soul of Light and took it back from Libby.
<br><br>
With the Three Purities Stone, he fused his soul with his body. He could thus also use the Sumeru Space owned by his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
"Or do you think you have a trump card that will help you fight back and defeat me?"
<br><br>
The fox girl was suddenly reluctant to kill Zen.
<br><br>
She had hunted many low-level creatures in the Eternal Scroll Painting that were weak and vulnerable in her eyes.
<br><br>
But the human being before her was the only one who had fought her for so long.
<br><br>
He had probably been able to hold on for so long because they were fighting in the room of hexagram array.
<br><br>
But he was still outstanding for holding his own while fighting her.
<br><br>
Whoosh! "If you have any powerful skills, use them quickly, or you won't stand a chance!"
<br><br>
The fox girl jumped a hundred feet as she spoke, and then, with a sudden kick of her legs, swooped down on Zen.
<br><br>
She used her own body as a weapon.
<br><br>
She had used this method a number of times before and every time, her attack had been formidable and threatening. Zen had had no choice but to escape.
<br><br>
But Zen stayed put this time. He merely took a step back before an azure square appeared in his hand. He had barely pulled the Celestial Spear from the square when a hysterical voice rang out from his throat and echoed across the room. "I'll do what you want!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3825 Walls By then, the Celestial Spear had returned to its peak, capable of increasing Zen's strength ninefold.
<br><br>
If Zen now went all out and unleashed two hundred thousand divine megatons of force, the blow would be as powerful as one million eight hundred thousand divine megatons of force; a truly terrifying figure.
<br><br>
But he only had one shot at it and so had to be very precise.
<br><br>
He exercised great patience when fighting the fox girl and now he waited for his final opening! "Buzz!"
<br><br>
The power of two hundred thousand divine megatons surged along his arms like a vigorous tide.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits could now only bear one hundred thousand divine megatons of force, while Zen's physical body would have to bear the remaining one hundred thousand divine megatons of force. Consequently, one hundred thousand divine megatons was actually his body's limit.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
Faint cracking noises came from within him as he brandished the Celestial Spear.
<br><br>
He was at his limit and his body was struggling to bear such great force and so thin cracks began appearing on his bones.
<br><br>
If he remained in this extreme state for much longer, his body could collapse.
<br><br>
But the Celestial Spear had already been drawn towards the fox girl.
<br><br>
With two hundred thousand divine megatons of force contained in the attack, the Celestial Stone embedded in the tip of the spear emitted intense light and an indescribably heavy pressure was exerted on it.
<br><br>
As Zen waved the spear around, its shaft was pressed into the shape of a full moon.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures felt a strong wind whip and cut at their faces.
<br><br>
They tried to dodge the intense pain but there was nowhere in the room to escape to.
<br><br>
From the very beginning, the fox girl had never viewed Zen as her opponent, as capable of challenging her, and she certainly had never thought he would pull out a weapon such as this.
<br><br>
The power she felt from the tip of the Celestial Spear changed everything and wiped a look of pure shock across her glazed face.
<br><br>
She could not accurately deduce the Celestial Spear's power, but she knew that if she was hit by a strike from it, she would most definitely die.
<br><br>
Her body was in an incredibly powerful state. Under normal circumstances it was impossible to break. But once the power climbed too high, breaking a single spot would shatter her entire body.
<br><br>
Egan and Kirk were awestruck at what they saw. They hadn't expected Zen to still have a trump card like this hidden up his sleeve.
<br><br>
The Celestial Spear was about to strike the fox girl when suddenly, a huge hand drew a line into the No-break Maze. The line just so happened to be drawn in the room Zen was in.
<br><br>
The line was nothing but a black mark on the Eternal Scroll Painting. But in the room, between Zen and the fox girl, a wall had been added, and the Celestial Spear carrying a power as high as one million eight hundred thousand divine megatons hit it.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
A deafening boom rang out and the entire No-break Maze trembled under the massive force. The two Evil Orochis blocking the way were rattled too.
<br><br>
They held great power themselves and so any power stronger than theirs frightened them.
<br><br>
The wall was unbreakable but still caved in from the extraordinary force.
<br><br>
Even from above the Eternal Scroll Painting, the new line was curved.
<br><br>
The crying face was not worried about it being smashed through though.
<br><br>
All walls in the No-break Maze were a whole; unless the entire maze was erased, none of the walls would be destroyed.
<br><br>
Zen was stunned and frustrated that his strike had been blocked by a wall appearing out of the blue.
<br><br>
Regardless of how it had appeared, he now had no other way to fight back against the fox girl.
<br><br>
She had planned to close her eyes and wait for death to take her. The sudden appearance of the wall stunned her too. She raised an eyebrow and fell into deep thought.
<br><br>
A few moments later, a murderous look appeared on her face. She moved around the wall in an attempt to get at Zen.
<br><br>
Zen stepped back, gritting his teeth.
<br><br>
The fox girl took two steps forward and another wall was placed in front of her.
<br><br>
She refused to give up. She stepped back and tried going around the other side.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
A third wall appeared, completely blocking her off.
<br><br>
The room was now divided into two. Once the fox girl accepted she was unable to enter the area Zen was in, she helplessly exited the hexagram array and turned into a flat picture.
<br><br>
She immediately looked up at the face in the sky, which was constantly changing between crying and smiling.
<br><br>
"Master Brush-wielder! Why did you stop me from killing him?" the fox girl asked furiously.
<br><br>
"Because you had already lost," said the smiling face calmly. "If I hadn't done something, he would have smashed you to bits."
<br><br>
"Why not just help me?" she asked, still upset.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..." the smiling face chuckled gloomily. "The reason I helped you in the first place was because I needed you to do something that was inconvenient for me to do myself, not because you needed help killing people in the passages. If all I want is death, I could do it myself."
<br><br>
This revelation left the fox girl speechless.
<br><br>
The face gave her and her companions everything they had. What it said made sense.
<br><br>
But the fox girl was smart and quickly picked up on something. "No, you would not have paid so much attention to me just because you're worried about me!"
<br><br>
There was no doubt about her strength. It was very unlikely she would encounter any danger she couldn't handle, so the brush-wielder would not need to pay so much attention to her. There was nothing he'd have to rescue her from.
<br><br>
The only possibility that remained was that he was watching someone else.
<br><br>
It was obvious: it was the human boy she had been fighting. The brushwielder was concerned for his safety.
<br><br>
Her guess was right. The brush-wielder's eyes never left Zen. He wanted to test Zen's limits and see how far he could go, but he had never imagined he would be able to kill the fox girl.
<br><br>
At the critical moment, he stepped in and stopped the fight from continuing.
<br><br>
"Why? Is he special?" inquired the fox girl curiously.
<br><br>
"Yes," the smiling face replied.
<br><br>
"Is it possible that he may enter the final room?" The fox girl's attitude had now shifted.
<br><br>
"At the least, he passed your test," said the smiling face, turning into a crying face but still with an unusually happy voice.
<br><br>
The fox girl fell silent for a moment, feeling that the brush-wielder seemed to be acting reasonably.
<br><br>
If she put aside his abnormal behavior of silently protecting Zen, she had to admit that the human had indeed defeated her and was even about to kill her.
<br><br>
"All I know is that he is one we have waited for, but whether he is able to reach the end, I'm unsure," said the crying face slowly. "When all is said and done, he is the most likely to reach the end. So, according to our agreement, you will have to talk with him."
<br><br>
"Got it, sir."
<br><br>
The fox girl lay in the Eternal Scroll Painting and returned to the room.
<br><br>
Zen and the others were unable to leave because of the several walls that had been put into place.
<br><br>
They had no idea what was going on and were all worried about what would happen to them.
<br><br>
They were lost in thought when the sound of something being erased scratched in all their ears and the walls quickly vanished before their eyes.
<br><br>
The disappearance of the walls displeased them as the fox girl stood in front of them once more.
<br><br>
Chapter 3826 The Origin-Level Bloodline The amount of twists and turns perplexed these Other Shore creatures to the point that they almost went numb from the nervousness.
<br><br>
Nobody tried to escape. All they could do was stare at the fox girl with glazed, frozen eyes.
<br><br>
It was as if they were no longer concerned with whether she would kill them or not. Their fate had been sealed the moment they entered this trap.
<br><br>
All they could do was accept their death with dignity.
<br><br>
The fox girl turned her gaze to Zen.
<br><br>
This was her home turf so she had the upper hand but she still ended up defeated by this man. Was it a matter of luck, perhaps? Nevertheless, whether or not Zen got lucky, she was still defeated which meant the brushwielder had chosen the right person.
<br><br>
She nodded at him pointedly. "You, come to me."
<br><br>
Zen had just recently restored the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body and was extremely on guard, however, her sudden command still caught him by surprise. "What do you mean?"
<br><br>
"You've defeated me, so I will tell you something," she replied.
<br><br>
Zen immediately shook his head. "I refuse!"
<br><br>
He didn't know what was up with this fox girl, however, he knew for a fact that once he left the room and changed into a painting then the strength gap between the two of them would grow significantly. He would completely be at her mercy.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen's vigilance, the fox girl was at a loss with how to persuade him.
<br><br>
After a while, she decided to turn her attention towards the Other Shore creatures behind him. "You can leave the room now."
<br><br>
Since Zen was not willing to come to her, then she would have to empty out the room to privately converse with him.
<br><br>
"We're not going anywhere..."
<br><br>
"Those snakes are still guarding outside. If we go out, we're as good as dead!"
<br><br>
"Exactly! What he said!"
<br><br>
It was only after looking at the determined expressions on their faces that the fox girl truly realized how much of a threat they viewed her as.
<br><br>
Truth be told, she initially only planned to spare Zen's life since he was the one who defeated her. However, she remembered the brush-wielder's words and knew it would be meaningless for her to kill these creatures.
<br><br>
"You will leave here safely. I shall remove the Evil Orochis and ensure a safe path for you all," she assured them.
<br><br>
"Really?"
<br><br>
"You're truly going to let us go?"
<br><br>
"You're not messing with us, right?"
<br><br>
Of course, despite her assurance, they still found her words a bit too hard to believe.
<br><br>
Having noticed that their suspicions remained unabated, the fox girl decided to send out a command to the Evil Orochis that told them to retreat from the upper-right corner of the No-break Maze.
<br><br>
However, even if the two snakes had retreated far away, the creatures still refused to believe in her. There was no way they were going to trust someone with such large amounts of power.
<br><br>
The fox girl gritted her teeth from irritation. "I'll give you ten seconds. If you don't leave then you leave me no choice but to kill you!"
<br><br>
Fortunately for her, this ultimatum was enough to send the Other Shore creatures running. They all stepped past the hexagram array and turned into paintings as they left.
<br><br>
Before Egan and Kirk left, they shot one last look at Zen, wishing him luck for whatever the fox girl had in store for him.
<br><br>
She didn't seem to have any more intentions of killing anyone but they weren't sure what she wanted from Zen.
<br><br>
Once everyone left and they were finally alone, the fox girl talked to Zen directly. "You've obtained a total of eighteen imprints in the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, right?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen replied with full honesty.
<br><br>
There was no need for him to hide anything or lie since she was already forthright with her question.
<br><br>
She smiled and asked another question. "What kind of bloodline do you want to obtain?"
<br><br>
The specificity of her question made Zen freeze.
<br><br>
According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the most difficult part of the Eternal Scroll Painting lay on the third page which was a huge vortex wherein Zen could fully test his own strength.
<br><br>
As far as Zen knew, the imprints he had collected could be used to help him explore the vortex. The fox girl's question just now sounded like she was offering Zen whatever bloodline he wanted. Was it really that easy? "Ever since I entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, I have strived to achieve a lot of things. The bloodline I will obtain will just depend on my fate, right?"
<br><br>
he replied after thinking about it for a while.
<br><br>
As the saying went, "Man proposes, God disposes," and Zen believed this wholeheartedly.
<br><br>
"I want you to go to the end," the fox girl said with a very serious look.
<br><br>
"The end?" Zen repeated with a scoff of disbelief. "There are so many elder masters who've entered the Eternal Scroll Painting before me. I'm not sure I'm worthy enough of surpassing them and making it to the end."
<br><br>
The Other Shore was almost entirely under the control of the Element Spirit race which was already composed of countless elites. To surpass them all would be an incredibly difficult task for Zen. It wasn't a feat he had that much confidence in achieving at the moment.
<br><br>
The fox girl's eyes glinted with a hint of annoyance. "I wasn't asking you to surpass those losers. I said I wanted you to go to the end. Do you understand me?" she huffed. "Those guys you mentioned just got the rootlevel bloodline. That's nowhere near enough!"
<br><br>
Zen raised an eyebrow at the term she just used. "Root-level bloodline?" he repeated.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven was quick to rush to his aid. "I've never really heard of this term before. Perhaps it's a definition set for grading bloodlines. We usually separate the large vortex of the Eternal Scroll Painting into the inner and outer circles. The innermost circle has all the best bloodlines. Anyway, let's just hear her out first."
<br><br>
It was a good thing that the fox girl no longer held any hostility toward Zen.
<br><br>
"Bloodlines in that world are divided into three levels with the weakest being the ordinary source-level bloodline. All bloodlines in the sixteen outer circles of the vortex are all on ordinary source level while those in the four inner circles are on root level," she explained.
<br><br>
"That's quite similar to our grading methods!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "There are sixteen outer circles and four inner circles. The inner ones naturally have better bloodlines than the outer ones."
<br><br>
Chiyou, Houyi, and a vast majority of Eternal Realm warriors obtained ordinary source-level bloodlines in outer circles. Only a small number of people managed to obtain bloodlines in inner circles.
<br><br>
This explanation clarified some things for Zen. However, there was still something that bothered him. "You mean to tell me that it isn't enough to obtain a root-level bloodline?" he asked.
<br><br>
A root-level bloodline was at the same level as those powerful masters in Stage Thirty-three. Shouldn't that already be enough? It didn't seem to be enough judging from what the fox girl just told him.
<br><br>
Zen's words immediately filled her eyes with disappointment. "If you came to the Eternal Scroll Painting only to obtain a root-level bloodline then I'll just end your life right now!"
<br><br>
The fox girl raised her hand. Her thumb and index fingers were clasped together and the moment she snapped, Zen would instantly die.
<br><br>
She employed the use of a unique Law Power within this channel, a theurgy bestowed upon her by the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but secretly roll his eyes at her dramatics. He truly hadn't met a more unreasonable person but since he knew that she was serious about killing him, he had to submit. He immediately held up his hands in surrender. "Wait! I'll try my best to meet your requirement. If you say that the root-level bloodline is not enough then what's stronger than that?"
<br><br>
"The origin-level bloodline," she told him, finally stretching out her hands.
<br><br>
"There are four kinds of origin-level bloodline inside the room at the very end. You have to get one of them. If you can't then I'll kill you."
<br><br>
The corners of Zen's mouth twitched when he looked at her solemn expression. How did things come to this? Now he wasn't even allowed to get an ordinary bloodline, no, he had to get one of those so-called originlevel bloodlines or risk death.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was lost in thought.
<br><br>
As far as he recalled, the bloodlines in the inner circles were the most powerful. So long as Zen obtained one of them then he would be qualified to establish a force in Stage Thirty-two or Thirty-three and guarantee the survival of their race.
<br><br>
However, according to the fox girl, there were actually far stronger bloodlines. It was something he had never heard of before.
<br><br>
Chapter 3827 The Void Sand Before stepping out of the room with hexagram array, the fox girl signaled Zen to stand still, and then she gently pressed her white fingers onto Zen's forehead.
<br><br>
Zen knew the power her hand possessed was very formidable. As he was about to retreat, two of the fox girl's fingers had already touched his forehead, and a wisp of black gas instantly penetrated his head.
<br><br>
Zen felt a chill seep into his forehead, but the chill immediately disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
"What did you do?" Zen asked with a frown.
<br><br>
The fox girl shrugged her slender shoulders and explained, "I just did you a favor, and now you can move more smoothly in the big vortex."
<br><br>
Zen suspiciously stared at the fox girl for a few seconds before he stepped into the hexagram array and turned into a flat picture.
<br><br>
The moment Zen became a painting, a strange feeling stirred in him.
<br><br>
Previously, after he had transformed into the painting, his angle of sight had been fixed, and he could only view the scenery within a limited range.
<br><br>
However, at this moment, his angle of sight had slightly changed.
<br><br>
What was happening now? Reflexively, Zen raised his head. He suddenly gazed straight ahead and discovered the end of the Eternal Scroll Painting. Only then did he realize that he was standing on the Eternal Scroll Painting! He was still a painting, but he had turned into a painting that had stood up.
<br><br>
"This is a skill of the Worm Tapir!"
<br><br>
Zen was momentarily stunned before he realized what had happened.
<br><br>
Both the fox girl and the Worm Tapir could temporarily disappear from the Eternal Scroll Painting, which meant they could jump out of the painting.
<br><br>
Right now, he had stepped on the No-break Maze. The wall that resembled a line didn't seem to exist to him, and he could cross it with just one leap.
<br><br>
If someone saw Zen in the No-break Maze, they wouldn't be able to see his whole body, but only the soles of his feet.
<br><br>
"No wonder the Worm Tapir is so powerful. Its ability is utterly remarkable." Zen immediately understood the creature's ability.
<br><br>
In his current form, it was a piece of cake for him to kill the other creatures of the Other Shore. Those Other Shore creatures were not in the same league as him at all. They would not even know who attacked them if he stepped on them.
<br><br>
Zen no longer moved along the maze's pathways. Instead, he moved to cross the walls and headed straight for the end of the No-break Maze.
<br><br>
When he reached the gate at the end of the No-break Maze, Zen lowered his body back into the painting and moved out through the gate.
<br><br>
After passing through the No-break Maze, he reached the third page of the Eternal Scroll Painting and drew within sight of the huge vortex, which appeared in the Grand Plain Stage.
<br><br>
At this point, the Other Shore creatures in the Grand Plain Stage all sighed.
<br><br>
"It's the Black Disaster. They must have faced it!"
<br><br>
"This time, the Black Disaster is too powerful. Almost all of them have been slain!"
<br><br>
"Only a handful of people survived..."
<br><br>
Sometimes, the Eternal Scroll Painting was known for being extremely dangerous, and this particular sort of danger was known as the Black Disaster.
<br><br>
Every time the Black Disaster materialized, it could cause havoc and completely destroy the Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
However, the chances of meeting the Black Disaster were very small, and it had never appeared on the first page before.
<br><br>
When most of the Other Shore creatures perished and only a scraggly few survived, they were convinced that they had met their ends due to the Black Disaster. This time, those who entered the Eternal Scroll Painting would probably be completely annihilated.
<br><br>
"At least there is one of our members left. Our race still has some hope," an elder of the Life race said.
<br><br>
"There's no one left of our Swallow Victory race..."
<br><br>
"It's a great fortune for our Three Eyes race to have two warriors still alive!"
<br><br>
Just as the Other Shore races were tallying the surviving warriors, someone pointed at the Eternal Scroll Painting and exclaimed, "They're coming out.
<br><br>
They're about to enter the vortex!"
<br><br>
After entering the third page, the shapes of the Other Shore creatures were clearly visible. Many Other Shore creatures had materialized at the bottom of the huge vortex.
<br><br>
Inside the Eternal Scroll Painting Egan, Kirk, and the other survivors stood to the side. Instead of entering the vortex immediately, they were quietly checking things out.
<br><br>
Something floated in the large vortex—a kind of black sand, which was called the Void Sand.
<br><br>
Occasionally, a grain of Void Sand floated towards them and hit the bodies of Egan, Kirk, and the others, after which the sand instantly vanished, leaving a sand sized hole on the surface of their bodies as an agonizing pain filled them.
<br><br>
Those who had all entered the Eternal Scroll Painting and reached the big vortex on the third page had an instinctual fear of the Void Sand. Even those who had already achieved the Eternal Realm were no exception. Every time they even mentioned the Void Sand, their expressions would be greatly charged with fear.
<br><br>
Some Other Shore creatures might have been able to cultivate to become Eternal Realm warriors, but after being tortured by the Void Sand for some time, they all chose to quit.
<br><br>
The Void Sand could pierce into the physical body of any creature and dissolve it one bit at a time. And the agonizing pain it caused was not something that could be easily borne by most.
<br><br>
While they were still quietly watching the big vortex, Zen stepped through the gate of the No-break Maze.
<br><br>
"Zen, are you okay?" When Egan saw Zen, a pleasantly surprised look appeared on his face.
<br><br>
When the other creatures of the Other Shore laid eyes on Zen, they let out a collective sigh of relief. They were glad that Zen had made it through alive.
<br><br>
Although these Other Shore creatures all had their own viewpoints, Zen had saved their lives in the end. At the very least, they could fight together on the same side here.
<br><br>
"I'm fine," Zen replied. "Why haven't you entered the big vortex yet?"
<br><br>
"We're waiting for you," Egan said with a bashful smile.
<br><br>
In fact, so many terrible things had transpired on the first and second pages, so these warriors were all a bit scared.
<br><br>
Although there were neither beasts, nor the Black Disaster on the third page, they were afraid that an accident would happen again. If someone as powerful as Zen could lead them and face the dangers first, it would fill them with a certain sense of security.
<br><br>
"In that case, we should go in now!" said Zen.
<br><br>
He finally reached the final step, so he became a little excited.
<br><br>
Before he had taken more than a few steps, a grain of Void Sand came hurtling at him from the distance and hit the back of his hand.
<br><br>
Ba! The moment the grain of sand impacted with Zen's body, it instantly vanished. A sharp and lancing pain instantly pierced him as if a needle had shot right into his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
Although the pain lasted for a short while, it had a burning intensity. It seemed that there was nothing Zen could do to eliminate or avoid it.
<br><br>
"Is that the Void Sand?"
<br><br>
Earlier, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had instructed Zen that this large vortex was constructed from a massive amount of Void Sand, with each grain being able to devour the material it impacted with.
<br><br>
If enough Void Sand were to hit someone, their physical body would be utterly dissolved by the sand.
<br><br>
But it didn't seem to faze Zen at all since he had the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Zen gently stroked the area where the Void Sand had hit. With the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits, his body remained intact and unscathed. "It doesn't seem to have had any lingering effect."
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source Spirits are really able to block the Void Sand..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven also seemed a bit surprised. He then cautioned, "That's indeed good news for you, but don't become careless. The Void Sand can dissolve more than just your body."
<br><br>
"Dissolve my soul." Zen frowned tightly.
<br><br>
Although the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body could physically fend off the sand, he didn't have an effective method to protect his soul. Without anything else to rely on, he would only have the protection of the nine Holy Soul Imprints.
<br><br>
Chapter 3828 Imprint Transmission Tower "Da, Da, Da..."
<br><br>
The Void Sand occasionally hit their bodies, and the pain felt like needles pricking their skin.
<br><br>
What was worse was that it was both physical and mental pain.
<br><br>
It was especially hard for the warrior of the Life race on the left since he was highly sensitive to pain. Every time a grain of sand hit him, he gritted his teeth and groaned in agony.
<br><br>
It also hurt both Egan and Kirk, but they endured it a lot better. They only frowned and simply put up with it.
<br><br>
In comparison, the sand wouldn't quickly erode Zen's body, but he couldn't just get rid of the pain in his soul.
<br><br>
After they moved forward for a certain distance, a square appeared on the scroll painting. There was a big hexagram array drawn at the entrance of the square.
<br><br>
Their group of nine entered the hexagram array and returned to their normal state. At that moment, a circular tower appeared in the center of the square.
<br><br>
The tower looked only like a simple circle on the scroll painting, but it looked magnificent and lofty in the square.
<br><br>
"This is the Imprint Transmission Tower," said Egan as he turned to Zen.
<br><br>
"This is the starting point that leads to the big vortex. If you got some imprints while you were in the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, you can get the corresponding protection from the Imprint Transmission Tower."
<br><br>
Zen thought that it was nice of Egan to explain everything to him in detail, as Egan knew that it was his first time to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Although the Primeval Lord of Heaven had already told him about it, he still listened carefully, as Egan explained.
<br><br>
In general, ordinary Other Shore creatures weren't resistant to the Void Sand's erosion. It was perfectly fine for them to be in the sixteen outer circles since there was not much Void Sand there. However, there was a massive amount of Void Sand in the deep part of the vortex, and those grains of sand could easily erode them. If they wanted to travel smoothly in the depths of the vortex, they had to rely on the Imprint Transmission Tower.
<br><br>
In front of the tower was a member of the Jade Crown race who took the lead to step forward.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
When the warrior approached the Imprint Transmission Tower, his chest, back, and head began to glow. In turn, seven imprints appeared on the tower.
<br><br>
"Three Bone Tribulation Imprints and four Holy Soul Imprints, that's not bad," said Egan.
<br><br>
The three Bone Tribulation Imprints were exposed, so everyone saw them.
<br><br>
The Holy Soul Imprints were on one's soul, and they were invisible to the naked eye but easy to figure out.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
The imprints on the Imprint Transmission Tower only remained for a short while before they disappeared. Then, a golden light came down from the tower and enveloped the warrior of the Jade Crown race.
<br><br>
"Now he should be able to reach the ninth circle from the center since seven layers of imprint light protected his body. But I can't say for sure if he could do better than that," Kirk commented.
<br><br>
"If he has stronger willpower and a faster speed, maybe he could break into the eighth circle," said Egan with a smile.
<br><br>
Egan had nine imprints, which made him an outstanding warrior. His goal was to rush into the fifth circle. He felt a sense of superiority when he saw the seven imprints of the warrior from the Jade Crown race.
<br><br>
After the warrior of the Jade Crown race obtained the protective light, he retreated to the side.
<br><br>
The next one who entered was the warrior of the Life race.
<br><br>
As soon as he neared the Imprint Transmission Tower, four imprints flashed across his body, and eight imprints on the tower lit up. It meant that he had four Holy Soul Imprints, and four Bone Tribulation Imprints, respectively.
<br><br>
The warrior felt very proud. He turned his head and announced, "My goal is to enter the seventh circle!"
<br><br>
It was difficult for a warrior who had eight imprints to enter the seventh circle, but it was clear that this warrior was determined.
<br><br>
Next, Egan and Kirk approached the Imprint Transmission Tower and obtained their protective light.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the more imprints one had, the stronger the protective light the Imprint Transmission Tower gave them.
<br><br>
For example, the protective light Egan acquired was much denser than that of the warrior from the Jade Crown race.
<br><br>
After nearly all of them received the protective light, only Zen and a member of the Grasshopper race were left. The warrior from the Grasshopper race wasn't tall and remained quiet throughout, and most people ignored him.
<br><br>
"It's your turn, Zen," Egan said with a smile.
<br><br>
He had nine imprints, so he was the one with the most imprints among the group. He wanted to see how many imprints Zen had, and the Other Shore creatures were curious about it as well.
<br><br>
Although Zen had shown great strength, it didn't necessarily mean that he had a lot of imprints.
<br><br>
However, the warrior from the Grasshopper race suddenly walked towards the Imprint Transmission Tower.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Just as he approached the Imprint Transmission Tower, the imprints on his body lit up. Thirteen imprints appeared on the Imprint Transmission Tower.
<br><br>
"My goal is to enter the inner circles," he declared.
<br><br>
The inner circles were the four circles near the center, and the bloodline they could get from there was much stronger than that in the outer circles.
<br><br>
That was also the root-level bloodline the fox girl had mentioned before! Thirteen imprints were extremely rare, so he was indeed qualified to break through to the inner circles.
<br><br>
"The Earth Grasshopper of the Grasshopper race actually has thirteen imprints!"
<br><br>
"A wise head truly makes a closed mouth. I didn't expect that he had so many imprints!"
<br><br>
"Break through to the inner circles... After we reach the Eternal Realm, he would still be more powerful than us."
<br><br>
Some of them were envious, but there was nothing they could do. After all, some things had already been decided when they passed the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation.
<br><br>
Although the number of imprints did not mean everything, some special abilities and willpower could fill the gap. But except for a small number of extremely powerful people who could narrow the gap, the others wouldn't be able to do much.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
A dazzling beam of protective light appeared around the warrior of the Grasshopper race. The light he released was much more intense than that of Egan, and it was the brightest of all.
<br><br>
Now, only Zen was left.
<br><br>
"The strongest one among us should be the Earth Grasshopper."
<br><br>
"Yes, thirteen imprints. No one had achieved such an extraordinary feat in a long time..."
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
The performance of the warrior from the Grasshopper race caught everyone's attention, so they expected a bit less from Zen's performance.
<br><br>
After all, it was hard for him to surpass thirteen imprints.
<br><br>
After the warrior of the Grasshopper race left the Imprint Transmission Power, Zen walked towards it.
<br><br>
The moment he neared it, his chest, legs, back, arms, head… All of his body parts glowed with the imprints' light, and so did the tower.
<br><br>
Nine Bone Tribulation Imprints of different shapes and nine Holy Soul Imprints appeared on the tower at the same time.
<br><br>
The ray of light was somewhat blinding, and the crowd in the square fell silent. It wasn't until quite a while later that they began to roar.
<br><br>
"How many imprints are there?"
<br><br>
"One, two, three... Eighteen, eighteen imprints... "
<br><br>
"Eighteen imprints? Has he achieved complete success in both the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation?"
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures present grew up on the Grand Plain Stage, so they had watched the Eternal Scroll Painting unfold over and over again.
<br><br>
They were familiar with all sorts of stories about talents, but they had never heard of anyone who had obtained eighteen imprints! "Zen, it this real?"
<br><br>
Kirk asked in shock.
<br><br>
He couldn't believe his eyes! In turn, Zen just shrugged slightly at Kirk's disbelief. "Zen, are you going to break through to the first circle?" Egan asked.
<br><br>
"I'll try my best," Zen answered.
<br><br>
The bloodline power in the innermost circle was only at the root level. It naturally didn't meet the requirements of the fox girl, so he could only try his best to explore the vortex and reach the end.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
After the eighteen imprints disappeared, the protective light appeared on his body. The layer of protective light was as thick as real armor, and it tightly wrapped around him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3829 Complete Erosion All the creatures present stood still in shock. They had never heard of anyone receiving eighteen imprints since the beginning of history, and the protective light that everyone else obtained wasn't as dense as Zen's.
<br><br>
Even Zen himself felt that the protective light was too dazzling, and it took him quite a while to get used to it.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the others stared blankly at him for a long time, their eyes filled with envy.
<br><br>
That level of protective light would enable him to easily enter the inner circles and even break through to the third or second circle.
<br><br>
They all entered the Soul City and passed through the Land of Bone Tribulation, but why was there such a big difference? No wonder both the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race fought tooth and nail for Zen. That was probably the secret reason.
<br><br>
On the other side of the square was another big hexagram array.
<br><br>
After everyone had acquired protective light, they gathered in front of the hexagram array.
<br><br>
From there, they could see the ethereal Void Sand that floated above the ground. "Are we going to rush out together? I can take the lead," Zen offered.
<br><br>
However, the people behind him had mixed emotions regarding his suggestion.
<br><br>
"Zen, you can't do this," Egan said and shook his head.
<br><br>
"Why not?" Naturally, Zen was puzzled.
<br><br>
"The more people are gathered together, the more intense and severe the Void Sand's attacks will be," Kirk answered.
<br><br>
When the Eternal Scroll Painting was first designed, its designer had considered that some warriors might enter the inner circles in groups. After all, if someone powerful took the lead, then everyone behind him would benefit from it. Furthermore, it would be too easy for the weak ones to enter the inner circles.
<br><br>
There were a few who had tried to do it before, but when multiple people attempted it, the Void Sand in the vortex gathered like mad and became harder to resist.
<br><br>
From then on, everyone learned their lesson and entered the big vortex one by one.
<br><br>
"But this protective light..."
<br><br>
Zen felt that the protective light was quite powerful, but to maintain such a powerful state consumed a lot of energy. Thus, he was afraid that the protective light could only last for a limited time.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, Zen. As long as you stay inside the square, the protective light won't weaken," Egan assured him.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Zen didn't say anything more. Besides, it wasn't the first time these people entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
They gained their experiences from the many generations before them, so what they said shouldn't be wrong.
<br><br>
"Then I'll go first!" the member of the Life race declared.
<br><br>
He went forward and stepped on the hexagram array, then transformed into a picture and rushed forth.
<br><br>
All the eyes of the Other Shore creatures in the Grand Plain Stage were on him. The members of the Life race, in particular, even shouted and cheered.
<br><br>
The last remaining member of the Life race had eight imprints, which included four Holy Soul Imprints and four Bone Tribulation Imprints. The more balanced his corporeal body and soul were, the more even his protective light would be.
<br><br>
"Lionel will certainly get a good result!"
<br><br>
"His goal is to enter the seventh circle. He'll surely be able to make it."
<br><br>
"I believe in Lionel's strength!"
<br><br>
At that point, the member of the Life race ran wildly in the big vortex.
<br><br>
As soon as he left the square, the Void Sand began to rush towards him.
<br><br>
More than a dozen pieces of the Void Sand hit his chest at the same time, but the protective light immediately dissolved them.
<br><br>
But of course, some of the protective light was dissolved as well.
<br><br>
Fortunately, it wasn't an issue for concern.
<br><br>
With the protection of the protective light, the outermost circle of the big vortex didn't obstruct him at all. He had already passed through it in only five minutes. Then, he went through the nineteenth circle, the eighteenth circle, the seventeenth circle...
<br><br>
The creatures in the Grand Plain Stage saw what was happening, but Zen and the others couldn't. They only saw a golden light dot quickly ran on the ground in the distance.
<br><br>
Not long after, the member of the Life race had reached the tenth circle.
<br><br>
Some hexagram arrays were sparsely scattered on the ground outside the tenth circle. Then, behind each hexagram array was a round room.
<br><br>
If this member of the Life race wanted to obtain a bloodline, he could choose a hexagram array and enter the room behind it.
<br><br>
However, this member of the Life race named Lionel had long aimed for the seventh circle and did not intend to compromise.
<br><br>
The moment he entered the ninth circle, a large amount of Void Sand hit him.
<br><br>
The Void Sand eroded his protective light up to the point that its golden glow was fading at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.
<br><br>
"It seems that Lionel's protective light is quite weak!"
<br><br>
"Perhaps it truly is difficult to maintain the protective light until he reaches the seventh circle."
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
The Life race was a race that had gone through all kinds of hardships.
<br><br>
Although they were under the Element Spirit race's protection, they were weak and undervalued. The other races always abused them, and until now, only their leader was at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
As Lionel grew up, he swore to himself that he would become a mighty warrior of the Eternal Realm, and explore Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore to revive their Life race.
<br><br>
Because of his great ambition, he had worked hard.
<br><br>
"The eighth circle!"
<br><br>
Once he entered the eighth ring, the protective light on his body became very weak.
<br><br>
Logically speaking, the eighth circle should be his destination at that point.
<br><br>
However, he refused to stop there. Since he decided that he would enter the seventh circle, then he wouldn't give up until he made it. The deeper he went, the stronger the bloodline he would get. Thus, he convinced himself that he had to do his best and reach his limit.
<br><br>
If he couldn't even do that, then how could he revive his race? When he was halfway through the eighth circle, however, his protective light completely disappeared.
<br><br>
Without the protective light, things would get very complicated and dangerous for him.
<br><br>
"Lionel, please choose a bloodline already!"
<br><br>
"Your protective light is gone!"
<br><br>
the other members of the Life race shouted repeatedly, but they couldn't transmit their voices from the Grand Plain Stage to the Eternal Scroll Painting. Besides, based on Lionel's mentality, he wouldn't stop even if he heard them.
<br><br>
The Void Sand hit his arms, chest, belly, and legs, and left countless sandsized pits. The intense pain was like thousands of needles that stabbed into his Soul of Light.
<br><br>
If he had a weaker will, then he would've passed out from the pain by now.
<br><br>
He continued to rush forward with gritted teeth as his arms covered his face.
<br><br>
By the time he reached the seventh circle, the Void Sand had eroded more than half of the arm that covered his face. The bones inside it broke, then his arm completely fell off his shoulder.
<br><br>
His legs were also damaged, so he could only limp forward.
<br><br>
The members of the Life race kept shouting in the Grand Plain Stage. They saw that his picture in the Eternal Scroll Painting became increasingly smaller until it almost stumbled forward on the ground.
<br><br>
Eventually, Lionel still managed to crawl into the seventh circle. As soon as he entered it, however, a swarm of Void Sand submerged him, and he disappeared into the depths of the great vortex. The Void Sand had devoured and eroded every tissue of his body.
<br><br>
Chapter 3830 Results The light at the far end gradually disappeared and Egan said in thought, "The man from the Life race has failed."
<br><br>
"Failed? What makes you say that?" asked Zen surprised.
<br><br>
He didn't know how Egan had come to this conclusion. When they were observing in the square, all they could see was a dot of light spinning in the distance before finally disappearing.
<br><br>
"If he had entered a room and fused with the bloodline, a blazing light would have flashed. But now, the protective light has disappeared but there is still no blazing light shining, which means he hasn't entered a room,"
<br><br>
Egan explained.
<br><br>
"He was trying too hard," commented Kirk while shaking his head.
<br><br>
In fact, the big vortex on the third page was relatively safe. As long as one's body was not totally eroded, they would be able to take their pick of a nearby room to obtain the bloodline and reach the Eternal Realm smoothly.
<br><br>
But some people got too greedy and chose to go further even without possessing the necessary strength.
<br><br>
"Let me have a go!"
<br><br>
The member of the Jade Crown race then came forward. He stepped into the hexagram array and quickly left the square, sprinting towards the depths of the big vortex.
<br><br>
About ten minutes later, his protective light was falling dimmer and dimmer. Then, a blazing light shot into the sky; the member of the Jade Crown race had already chosen a room to enter. After fusing with the bloodline, he reached the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
"That was quite a rational decision. From what I see, he is probably in the ninth circle, matching the strength of the imprints he had obtained," Egan said, nodding to Kirk. It was Kirk's turn to enter the vortex.
<br><br>
Kirk had obtained seven imprints, just like the man of the Jade Crown race and he didn't overextend himself either. After reaching the ninth circle, he simply chose and entered a room with a hexagram array.
<br><br>
Several Other Shore creatures then followed suit. Perhaps the tragedy of the member of the Life race sucked away their will to gamble. They no longer dared grit their teeth and fight head-on. Most of them had each chosen a room with a hexagram array while the protecting light still shone.
<br><br>
Egan was the third to last to enter the big vortex. The protective light released by the nine imprints guaranteed to take him further. In the end, he reached the expected sixth circle.
<br><br>
In the Grand Plain Stage, the members of the Three Eyes race were overjoyed. Despite the outbreak of the Black Disaster, they still had two members successfully enter the Eternal Realm. Even more special was that Egan himself had reached his goal and made it into the sixth circle. They naturally felt proud and honored.
<br><br>
"The sixth circle is probably the pinnacle of the Eternal Scroll Painting this time, right?" a member of the Three Eyes race asked, filled with pride.
<br><br>
The disciples of the larger races had died on either the first or second page and lost their chance to compete.
<br><br>
But just then, another began rushing along the big vortex. The person was very small. He was from the Grasshopper race.
<br><br>
This race was even more inconspicuous than the Life race in the Grand Plain Stage and was not held in high esteem by outsiders.
<br><br>
But when the other members of the Grasshopper race saw one of their own appear, they stood and watched expectantly.
<br><br>
It had been many years since their race had produced such a talent.
<br><br>
It would definitely increase the strength of the entire race by one level if he could enter an inner circle and reach the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Many Other Shore races looked on indifferently. The member of the Grasshopper race passed through circles, entered the fourth circle directly and obtained a bloodline there. He did more impressively than seemed possible for this race.
<br><br>
Bloodlines in the inner circles were on the root level.
<br><br>
Since ancient times, very few had obtained one. Perhaps only one had entered an inner circle in the thousands of times the Eternal Scroll Painting had opened! Many Other Shore races were then shocked to see what the member of the Grasshopper race had achieved.
<br><br>
A small, unknown race actually had a figure entering an inner circle... This would no doubt change the fate of their race.
<br><br>
However, some of the other races close to the Grasshopper race were not pleased. There was much competition and many disputes between them and the Grasshopper race and so they did not want to see such an impressive talent popping up.
<br><br>
"Why hasn't Zen gone yet?"
<br><br>
"His turn should be soon."
<br><br>
"He's the last to go!"
<br><br>
Pearce and the others were all in the Grand Plain Stage. Every time the Eternal Scroll Painting opened was like a grand banquet, but they always missed it as they were from the Source World.
<br><br>
Zen had come with eighteen imprints; he wondered what expressions this would inspire.
<br><br>
When Zen saw the blazing light soaring into the sky in the distance, he stepped into the hexagram array and turned into a flat painting, moving forward along the big vortex without hesitation.
<br><br>
Even after he had turned into a painting, his protective light was still intensely bright.
<br><br>
As the protective light blocked the Void Sand, he moved forward easily.
<br><br>
He encountered almost no resistance in the first sixteen circles.
<br><br>
A while later and he had successfully entered the fourth circle.
<br><br>
Zen had also garnered a lot of attention, but the Element Spirit race's and the Nihility race's interests in him had already proved he was extraordinary.
<br><br>
His entering an inner circle was almost expected and inevitable.
<br><br>
It would, after all, be ridiculous if the one selected by both Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven could not even enter an inner circle.
<br><br>
Zen had no time to relax when he entered the fourth circle. Once there, the size and density of the Void Sand increased greatly and rushed towards him wildly, consuming his protective light.
<br><br>
Although it was indeed very strong, it still would not be able to hold on much longer.
<br><br>
But the closer the circle to the center, the shorter the distance there was to travel through.
<br><br>
Without pausing, Zen advanced rapidly along the path through the big vortex.
<br><br>
The fourth circle...
<br><br>
The third circle...
<br><br>
The second circle...
<br><br>
All the Other Shore creatures in the Grand Plain Stage stared silently. They watched as he smoothly entered the inner circles, their expressions shifting with increasing amazement with his every advancement.
<br><br>
The gap between the Eternal Warriors was decided the moment they reached the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
The warriors in the outer circles were all at the ordinary Eternal Realm, while those who managed to make their way to the inner circles were capable of becoming the leaders of powerful races. Of course, they would most likely be recruited straight into the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race.
<br><br>
As for those who entered the third or even second circle, they would be powerful forces in exploring Stage Thirty-three. By then, they could even dominate a territory.
<br><br>
And the strongest would enter the innermost circle in the center of the vortex. These creatures had the potential to compete to be the strongest existence on the Other Shore! Now that Zen had effortlessly stepped into the second circle and still showed no signs of slowing down, it seemed that he would rush into the innermost circle.
<br><br>
"It's no wonder the two great races would fight for him..."
<br><br>
"They already knew what he was capable of!"
<br><br>
"He reaches the first circle. Up until now, there have only been eleven kinds of holy-level bloodlines. I wonder if he will obtain the twelfth."
<br><br>
Some Other Shore races referred to the bloodlines provided in the innermost circle as the holy-level bloodlines. These were also regarded as the best.
<br><br>
But this was a controversial view. After all, there were some incredibly powerful figures that did not rank high in the Eternal Scroll Painting. Thus it was believed that the difference in bloodlines from the four inner circles was not that great.
<br><br>
Chapter 3831 Surpassing Under the Other Shore creatures' gaze, Zen rushed right into the innermost circle.
<br><br>
There, the Void Sand was dark purple, having stronger corrosivity than that in outer circles. As though it had its own intelligence, the sand flew all over the sky, swarming toward Zen like a cloud of bloodthirsty mosquitoes.
<br><br>
Buzz! The once solid protective light then began swaying violently like candlelight flickering in strong gusts of wind. Now, it could be extinguished at any given moment.
<br><br>
If it weren't for the fox girl's special requirement, Zen might have already chosen to stop at this point. A bloodline in the innermost circle had met his initial expectations, after all.
<br><br>
To the left nearby Zen lay a hexagram array. Once he entered it, he'd be able to arrive safely at the room behind it, where a strange, flat pattern would be awaiting him — it likely had something to do with obtaining a bloodline.
<br><br>
But the fox girl's warning lingered in Zen's ears. He had no choice but to obey her — if he wanted to pass through the innermost circle smoothly, he had to speed up.
<br><br>
"I just have to charge without stopping!"
<br><br>
While he attempted to quicken his pace, the Void Sand reacted even more intensely, preventing him from advancing altogether.
<br><br>
Numerous clouds of Void Sand seemed to have materialized, forming a great monster that enveloped Zen, leaving no space for him to escape.
<br><br>
Countless grains of this unique sand counteracted Zen's protective light, corroding it in the field. Zen's protective light merely continued to shrink and dim.
<br><br>
"I can't hold on for much longer…" Zen muttered with a frown.
<br><br>
As he watched the sand dance along the surface of the painting, a thought suddenly sparked in his head — he then tried to lift his entire presence out of the Eternal Scroll Painting, leaving behind only his feet.
<br><br>
"Eh?"
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"Did he just leave his feet behind? Is it possible that..."
<br><br>
"Maybe the sand already eroded the rest of his body!"
<br><br>
The Other Shore creatures observing him speculated and bemoaned regretfully.
<br><br>
The members of the Three Eyes race glanced at the Oneness Sky Palace's people pitifully.
<br><br>
"What a shame. He should have chosen to integrate with a bloodline the moment he reached the innermost circle."
<br><br>
"Alas, maybe the boy was just far too greedy for a good rank. But the rankings in the inner circles don't matter all that much. He's still too young and doesn't know when to give up."
<br><br>
"This human's failure is far more regrettable than that of the warrior from Life race. He could have become an excellent master…"
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Pearce, Auden, Libby, and the rest of the Oneness Sky Palace stood as motionless as statues. They were all holding their hearts in their mouths the moment Zen made it into the innermost circle.
<br><br>
As always, Zen continued to surprise them with his excellent performance.
<br><br>
But they never expected Zen's advance to end so abruptly — he had only just taken a few steps into the circle.
<br><br>
It was an unacceptable fact, most especially for Pearce. He was stunned frozen in place, picturing the significant changes Zen's death could bring to the Oneness Sky Palace. They could easily be forced to migrate from the Bloom Divine Province. Not to mention that they had to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasmin without Zen's power? All of a sudden, the future seemed far too dangerous.
<br><br>
Whether or not he admitted to the fact, the young man had become an indispensable existence to the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The other races' remarks of regret pierced their ears like needles, overwhelming them with grief and distress. For a moment, none of them dared speak a word, only staring at Zen's footprints on the painting.
<br><br>
"Wait. But his protective light hasn't dissipated. He shouldn't be dead yet, right?" Suddenly, Libby chimed in.
<br><br>
While the Oneness Sky Palace's people had never entered the painting themselves, they did have a general understanding of it. Before eroding one's body, the Void Sand had to first break down one's protective light completely.
<br><br>
But Zen had disappeared so suddenly, leaving behind only his feet.
<br><br>
Naturally, everyone assumed his body had been quickly devoured by the grains of sand. But upon further consideration, they began to realize that there was something wrong. His protective light was indeed weak, but it was still intact.
<br><br>
Following Libby's lead, the rest of the crowd in the Grand Plain Stage also noticed the inconsistency.
<br><br>
"They moved! His footprints moved on the painting!" Someone suddenly shouted with utter shock.
<br><br>
"They're disappearing every now and then… this seems familiar…"
<br><br>
"I see now! It's the Worm Tapirs' mysterious ability! This boy must have the means to lift himself out of the painting!"
<br><br>
The Worm Tapirs' mysterious style of movement was widely known— they were believed to have the ability to separate themselves from the painting while keeping their painting form. They would disappear and appear repeatedly as they moved across the painting.
<br><br>
Such an ability was nothing short of incredible — it allowed the Worm Tapirs to move in a higher space that ordinary people couldn't see with their bare eyes.
<br><br>
No one had ever expected Zen to carry the same kind of ability. How on earth did he learn it, they thought? Many knowledgeable warriors of the Eternal Realm widened their eyes in astonishment as they observed Zen's footprints that appeared on the painting from time to time.
<br><br>
Once Zen separated himself from the painting, he heaved a deep sigh of relief. The Void Sand had finally lost its target, turning instead to corrode Zen's feet, the soles of his feet that kept him in contact with the painting, to be exact.
<br><br>
As Zen leaped high off the surface, his entire presence completely disappeared from it.
<br><br>
'I should've just tried this earlier. I could've saved so much effort!"
<br><br>
At this point, Zen was complacent enough to wonder such things. But the space above the painting suddenly began trembling. Much to his surprise, clouds of dark purple Void Sand had also left the painting to surge toward him.
<br><br>
"What? I didn't know it could also separate itself from the painting!"
<br><br>
After a moment of shock, Zen's alarm kicked in as the wave of sand was just about to swallow him whole. His body sank downward as he once again returned to the painting.
<br><br>
A deafening cheer erupted from the Grand Plain Stage the moment he returned. Pearce, Auden, and the rest could feel all their worries fade away at the sight of his arrival.
<br><br>
Just as Libby had surmised, Zen wasn't damaged at all. The Eternal Realm masters' reaction told them that Zen had obtained an extraordinary ability to separate from the painting at will.
<br><br>
The minute Zen returned to it, though, the Void Sand followed suit and continued swarming toward him.
<br><br>
But the interval it provided when the Void Sand shifted between forms gave Zen a break.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, Zen lifted himself out of the painting once again before the Void Sand followed him out.
<br><br>
And so Zen continued moving in and out of the painting continuously. The motion was somewhat like swimming — it was as though he was repeatedly diving into the water and bobbing up. The Void Sand was still on his tail. But with this strange means of movement, he managed to avoid getting eroded and getting his protective light broken down.
<br><br>
Soon enough, Zen had already passed by the many hexagram arrays along the way that his predecessors had entered.
<br><br>
Once Zen surpassed the record of the spider spirit from the Star Spider Civilization, the Element Spirit race's Eye Spirit was the only one left who held a higher rank. For countless years, the Eye Spirit was in first place — he was known as one of the most powerful beings on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chapter 3832 The Closure Of The Eternal Scroll Painting The room the Eye Spirit went in was a little far away from the one the spider spirit went in, as two rooms of hexagram arrays lay in between them.
<br><br>
This meant that the Eye Spirit was much stronger than the spider spirit.
<br><br>
However, such long distance of superiority was easily surpassed by Zen in less than half a minute.
<br><br>
"He really surpassed him!"
<br><br>
"I've never seen anyone who reached this level! He actually surpassed the Eye Spirit of the Element Spirit race!"
<br><br>
"But isn't the Eye Spirit already in the center of the innermost circle? If he surpassed the Eye Spirit, then will he have the chance to fuse with a bloodline?"
<br><br>
In everyone's mind, the Eye Spirit was the pinnacle of strength, the symbol of the final destination.
<br><br>
Since ancient times, the Eye Spirit's position remained unshakeable.
<br><br>
Everyone thought that there might be a select few who could also reach the same destination but never surpass it.
<br><br>
Yet now, Zen easily went past this pinnacle. That one step forward meant a lot to these Other Shore creatures.
<br><br>
"There's still a hexagram array ahead but I can't see if there's also a room. It might just be covered up by darkness..."
<br><br>
Zen continued to jump in and out of the scroll painting. He did not have the luxury to observe and could only step onto the hexagram array.
<br><br>
In the center of the huge vortex was a mass of black substance.
<br><br>
This eldritch mass had already been repeatedly analyzed by numerous Other Shore creatures. Some believed it to be a form of Void Sand while others thought it was a passage.
<br><br>
Nobody ever had the chance to verify these assumptions because none of them had ever been able to surpass the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
There were also a lot of arguments about the substance. Since the Eye Spirit stopped just before he reached it, people began to think that it was because he couldn't resist the Void Sand or that he did not dare approach it because he too did not know what it was.
<br><br>
Today, they finally had a chance to figure out just what this black mass was.
<br><br>
In a corner of the Grand Plain Stage, a half-human, half-bull creature sat on the bronze ground, his big eyes transfixed on the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
This creature had made a bold guess: that the position of the Eye Spirit was not the destination and that the center of the huge vortex was, in fact, somewhere else.
<br><br>
Most of the Other Shore creatures he knew viewed his conjecture as a joke.
<br><br>
This half-human, half-bull creature did not even have the strength to enter the vortex, so what right did he have to assume what lay within that black mass? As Zen stepped onto the hexagram array just at the edge of the black mass, his figure disappeared.
<br><br>
"A passage!" the half-human, half-bull creature exclaimed. "It's a passage! I was right!"
<br><br>
He could've very well jumped in joy but, unfortunately, there was nobody he could share his discovery with since the area he was in was deserted.
<br><br>
"Did he just...disappear?" the Other Shore creatures whispered amongst themselves.
<br><br>
"Was he absorbed by the black substance?"
<br><br>
"Maybe he was transmitted away?"
<br><br>
There was no blazing light on the Eternal Scroll Painting when Zen stepped onto the hexagram array. He just simply disappeared; one moment he was there and the next he wasn't.
<br><br>
It was quiet all throughout the Grand Plain Stage as everyone tried to come up with a reason for Zen's sudden disappearance.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Somewhere in the Grand Plain Stage, a ball floated somewhere. Inside this ball was none other than Claire of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
She was not in the form of a woman nor was there any expression on her face.
<br><br>
Claire took a good, long look at the Eternal Scroll Painting. "I wonder what the consequences will be..." she muttered under her breath.
<br><br>
Another woman appeared in a blood-red ball in a different area of the Grand Plain Stage. It was Samantha of the Nihility race. The Grandmaster of Heaven had already left with the Evil God and she was tasked to stay and record what Zen did.
<br><br>
"Things seem to be in accordance with the master's guesses," she said with a cautious look on her face. There was a blood-red gem in her hand which recorded all the scenes that had taken place within the Eternal Scroll Painting. Through this gem, the Grandmaster of Heaven would be informed of all the important happenings.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace once again grew nervous since they couldn't confirm Zen's condition. "Go and see how Zen's corporeal body looks like," Pearce ordered Athemar.
<br><br>
Zen's true body remained in the Oneness Sky Palace but the one on the Other Shore had disappeared. Even Pearce could not understand the consequences of this event.
<br><br>
Athemar did as he was ordered and withdrew from the Other Shore. Twenty seconds later, he returned and breathed a sigh of relief. "Zen's corporeal body is safe."
<br><br>
Pearce nodded in understanding. "I hope he can come out of the Eternal Scroll Painting safely."
<br><br>
Both Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi remained trapped on the Other Shore. He didn't want Zen to follow in their footsteps.
<br><br>
The other Souls of Light remained silent and the atmosphere around them grew frosty. Everyone's heart was naturally filled with worry.
<br><br>
"You're worrying too much, Elder Pearce. Zen's never let us down,"
<br><br>
Athemar said.
<br><br>
His words eased the atmosphere just a bit. Auden and the others let out a chuckle as they echoed Athemar's sentiments. "That's true! He's never let us down."
<br><br>
Five minutes passed.
<br><br>
Ten minutes passed.
<br><br>
Fifteen minutes...
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
A sudden ray of blazing light flashed from within the Eternal Scroll Painting. It shot down and smashed onto a Three Purities Stone on the bronze ground. Soon enough, the member of the Jade Crown race with a rather big build emerged.
<br><br>
He was the one who entered the huge vortex after the one from the Life race. He had seven imprints and managed to enter the ninth circle of the vortex. His other race members couldn't help but look at him in awe since the bloodline of the ninth circle was no doubt enough to make him a backbone of their race.
<br><br>
Following his return, rays of blazing light would continue to smash down onto the bronze ground, accompanied with a cheer from the respective Other Shore race that received them.
<br><br>
"Bang..."
<br><br>
Kirk, Egan, and a talent of the Grasshopper race were the last to arrive. The last one managed to enter an inner circle.
<br><br>
Save for the member of the Life race who died and Zen who mysteriously disappeared, everyone managed to return safely.
<br><br>
The Souls of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace craned their necks in an effort to see if Zen made it.
<br><br>
It wasn't just them. The Three Eyes race, the Swallow Victory race, and even the other neutral races were also concerned about the situation. Since Zen supported the Finale Way and had shown his potential by surpassing the Eye Spirit, they all hoped he would be able to come back alive.
<br><br>
However, there were quite a number of those who hoped for the opposite.
<br><br>
Those affiliated with the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race, such as the Violet Cloud race, hoped for Zen's death. There was no way they could stomach the rise of another force.
<br><br>
"There's no need to wait! That guy has no doubt been eroded to dust by the Void Sand."
<br><br>
"It's been so long. There's no way he's coming back!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
The ridicule from the Violet Cloud race was truly too much! Libby wanted to refute them and say something equally scathing, but Pearce stopped her. Arguing with them was useless in this situation.
<br><br>
They continued to wait for an hour more before the black mass within the Eternal Scroll Painting fully dissipated.
<br><br>
The huge vortex and the Other Shore creatures' pictures disappeared, which signaled the closing of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Chapter 3833 Migration The fox girl was on the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting. Her figure was still proportioned perfectly, even when outlined by the black ink.
<br><br>
She was surrounded by black savage beasts, but they weren't hostile, they scurried around her like her pets.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A gust of cold wind blew from afar, dissipating some of the ink on the scroll painting rather quickly.
<br><br>
"Master brush-wielder, is he there?" asked the fox girl somewhat desperately as she looked up.
<br><br>
From where she stood, she couldn't see Zen's exact route.
<br><br>
The brush-wielder appeared above. He was able to see everything from page one to three.
<br><br>
"He's in," answered the crying face.
<br><br>
The fox girl breathed a huge sigh of relief but there was still a hint of worry visible on her face, "I do hope he succeeds..."
<br><br>
Being so patient in waiting for this one chance was no mean feat. Zen could not fail. Fear overcame her as she waited hopefully. If he did manage to succeed, her race's curse would probably be broken.
<br><br>
But one chance was all there was. She had no choice but to pray vehemently in silence.
<br><br>
Somewhere in Stage Thirty-three, in a huge metal mountain, a white ball slowly rose up.
<br><br>
There was nothing in it, not even any of the five elements.
<br><br>
The white ball floated above the metal and began rattling chaotically on the inside. A thin crack surfaced in the center, when it suddenly opened, a black eye appeared out of it.
<br><br>
This was the strongest warrior of the Element Spirit race, Eye Spirit, who had been the number one warrior on the Eternal Scroll Painting for countless years.
<br><br>
"Sizzle..."
<br><br>
The big black eye opened and a red light glowed in front of it, a slender woman appearing from within it. "Chief, why have you summoned me?"
<br><br>
she asked sweetly.
<br><br>
"Claire, I've told you hundreds of times not to come before me in this human figure," reprimanded the Eye Spirit sternly.
<br><br>
She didn't seem to take it seriously and said, "I feel free in this form. I like it."
<br><br>
She didn't seem afraid of the Eye Spirit despite being a subordinate. She did, after all, hold the right to make many decisions.
<br><br>
"I have prepared a body for you as well. Would you like to try it?"
<br><br>
She pointed to the side and the flames flickering on her fingertips created a human with a well-proportioned and in-shape body. In fact, it looked very much like Zen.
<br><br>
"Don't make such horrible jokes." The eye flashed a white light which shattered the human body.
<br><br>
Claire wasn't offended or at all bothered. She simply recreated it and put her arm around the man's neck, smiling playfully. "I know what you're thinking.
<br><br>
Zen has indeed already surpassed you in the Eternal Scroll Painting!"
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit's annoyance was clear in the eye. "I'm sure it was designed by him."
<br><br>
"Exactly right," Claire replied with disdain all over face. "Chief, you are suspicious and cunning, but your character has held you back. I've known it since the beginning."
<br><br>
"Is this why you let him in?" His dissatisfaction could be felt clearly.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race had faced several big and dangerous challenges on the Other Shore. This threat came from a mere human but the Eye Spirit still regarded it as the greatest of them all.
<br><br>
Claire stretched a finger out and drew circles on the look-alike Zen's face.
<br><br>
"Since we can't stop him, all we can do is make the best of the situation. We still have a great chance of winning him over."
<br><br>
"How do you plan to accomplish that?" asked the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
She moved her palm up from fake Zen's face and opened his eyes. "Getting the origin-level bloodline is not easy, it cannot be obtained quickly. If he stays in that place for a while, his physical body may not be difficult to get.
<br><br>
If I get his body, he will submit to me, yes?" Claire turned her head to look at 'Zen'. It was her little puppet that she could make do exactly as she wanted. She made it nod stiffly and reply, "Yes."
<br><br>
Her strategy satisfied the Eye Spirit. "If that's the case, you have to make a move as soon as possible."
<br><br>
"Don't worry, Chief. I'm fully prepared. There will be an attack on the Oneness Sky Palace again and this time we will kill them all," she promised with a sweet smile, while the look-alike Zen beside her grinned as well.
<br><br>
The Eye Spirit's big eye blinked, and before he closed it he added, "By the way, you should show me more respect next time."
<br><br>
He finished speaking and completely disappeared into a white ball, slowly descending from the top of the metal mountain.
<br><br>
"I will be the one to be respected," Claire muttered menacingly.
<br><br>
She looked at 'Zen', very satisfied with this body. She kissed it gently and their two bodies turned into flames and disappeared within the sphere.
<br><br>
Pearce saw the Eternal Scroll Painting close and fell into a daze for moment. 'Something is wrong, ' he thought to himself.
<br><br>
"What's the matter, Pearce?" asked Auden.
<br><br>
"Let's get out of the Other Shore first!"
<br><br>
As soon as Pearce finished speaking, he left the Other Shore.
<br><br>
At the same time, all the Souls of Light around him, including Auden, Athemar and Libby, hastily chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune and returned to the Source World.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
A golden light rose from the Phoenix Palace and exploded above, forming a snow-white circle of light. This was Pearce's summoning order.
<br><br>
The masters of the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace saw the circle of light and began whispering words of worry in their hearts. The Oneness Sky Palace had just stabilized a few days ago and now something major was already happening? The color drained from all their faces as they made their way to the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
Soon all the masters were gathered in the hall, including the representatives of the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
"All the members of the Oneness Sky Palace are expected to migrate to the Pear Hill," announced Pearce.
<br><br>
The hall erupted into an uproar.
<br><br>
Pearce had wanted to move the Oneness Sky Palace to the Pear Hill when they had been invaded by the Sun Crow race. In this way, they could save their lives and energy before Eastern Emperor Taiyi awoke. However, Ziya and the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had later given the Oneness Sky Palace the strength to put up a fight.
<br><br>
Now that Zen was trapped in the Eternal Scroll Painting, whether he was safe or not, he could not protect the Oneness Sky Palace. This was why Pearce had announced the migration.
<br><br>
"You must give me reason!" A master from the Bright Mountain demanded.
<br><br>
He had been in charge of the Bright Mountain since the death of their leader.
<br><br>
"I will not give you a reason. It's simple. If you want to die, stay. You have one day to mobilize your people," Pearce replied briefly.
<br><br>
The implication was clear. The Oneness Sky Palace was about to suffer a catastrophe. If they didn't move, they would die.
<br><br>
The masters of the mountains understood. Pearce's attitude indicated that they indeed had no choice.
<br><br>
Chapter 3834 The Last Room It was not easy for all of the members of the Oneness Sky Palace to relocate to another place. To do so in only one day was virtually impossible.
<br><br>
Within this short period of time, only some of the core disciples and royal members could be removed.
<br><br>
These core disciples were the hope of the Oneness Sky Palace for the future. After all, as long as they survived, hope still remained.
<br><br>
Several huge flying ships had landed on the sword sects of the seven mountains, and the training rooms were opened by force one by one.
<br><br>
Those disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace who were still cultivating on the Other Shore were rudely awakened by force. Some disciples who were still in the temple or unable to leave the Other Shore were unceremoniously moved to the flying ships and stacked in rows, like goods to be transported.
<br><br>
In front of the Phoenix Palace, a huge flying ship had docked, and the disciples of the three sword sects quickly marched onto it, one after another.
<br><br>
It was not compulsory for the Other Shore Realm disciples to join the migration, but the dire consequences of staying on in the Bloom Divine Province could be imagined. Once the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race invaded the Bloom Divine Province, the chances of anyone surviving would be very small.
<br><br>
Some of the more stubborn disciples chose to return to the clans of the Clear Lake, and the Oneness Sky Palace did not try to stop them.
<br><br>
"Disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, step over here," Chaim called, guiding the disciples onto the flying ship.
<br><br>
Behind Chaim, many disciples, including Elvinia, were sitting cross-legged.
<br><br>
Elvinia was still receiving training in the Soul City, so he couldn't force her to wake up. He had carried her onto the ship and placed her here.
<br><br>
"I didn't expect to be forced to depart the Oneness Sky Palace so soon..." A disciple of the Land of Sword Grief gazed with reluctant eyes at the river and mountains in the distance.
<br><br>
The seven mountains were the bed-stone of the Oneness Sky Palace. The Oneness Sky Palace had stood here for countless centuries, but no one had expected they would have to leave it in such a hurried disarray.
<br><br>
"We will return," another disciple from the Land of Sword Grief muttered.
<br><br>
"We will return, rest assured."
<br><br>
They were a part of the high-level reserve forces of the Oneness Sky Palace, and they had faced some real and hair raising situations. The current situation indeed didn't bode well for the Oneness Sky Palace, but as long as they could survive this hard time, they would return sooner or later.
<br><br>
"Excuse me!"
<br><br>
Pearce shouted from his midair position, carrying a huge red crystal on his shoulder.
<br><br>
After the disciples cleared a space for him, Pearce landed on the deck of the flying ship and gently set down the red crystal. A physical body was imbedded in the red crystal, seemingly asleep. It was none other than Eastern Emperor Taiyi! This red crystal had an extraordinary history. It had been excavated from the depths of the central rift valley in the Source World. It was known to be one of the hardest materials in the Source World.
<br><br>
The red crystal could oppose the power of over one hundred thousand divine megatons, which was the equivalent of an all-out attack by an Eternal Realm master.
<br><br>
After lowering the body of Eastern Emperor Taiyi on the flying ship, Pearce retreated two steps backward and bowed respectfully to Eastern Emperor Taiyi. The red crystal was absorbed into the ship's interior.
<br><br>
Soon after, another figure appeared in the sky. This was Winchell. He also carried a red crystal and what locked inside the red crystal was the body of Yasamin.
<br><br>
Just like Pearce, he lowered the red crystal to the deck of the flying ship, and it sank inside the ship.
<br><br>
Seeing the two strongest warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace being transported here, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were muttering among themselves in low voices.
<br><br>
"Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasamin have been brought here.
<br><br>
But where is Zen?"
<br><br>
"It is said that Zen is occupied in the Eternal Scroll Painting and won't be able to return for the time being. Otherwise, we wouldn't have to leave the Bloom Divine Province."
<br><br>
"Alas, I have an ominous feeling that Zen will definitely not return."
<br><br>
Just as these people were discussing this, a woman robed in blue stepped over.
<br><br>
As she heard their words, her pair of neat eyebrows suddenly twisted, and a fierce light burned in her eyes. "What are you talking about?"
<br><br>
The woman in blue was none other than Libby, who had returned from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, who were discussing this in low voices, fell silent, and they dared not say anything else.
<br><br>
Libby had successfully completed her cultivation in the Land of Sword Grief. Due to Eastern Emperor Taiyi's imprisonment on the Other Shore, he couldn't make her the Oneness Governor, but given her strength, she was comparable to the Oneness Sky Palace's Oneness Governors.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, another figure appeared in the sky. It was Athemar who was carrying the last red crystal on his shoulder as he arrived on the flying ship. Zen was lying inside this red crystal.
<br><br>
As Libby stared at Zen inside the red crystal, her eyes darkened.
<br><br>
She believed without a shadow of doubt that Zen would definitely wake up.
<br><br>
However, could the Oneness Sky Palace survive until then? After the Oneness Sky Palace reached a decision, they quickly informed the Pear Hill through the Other Shore. The Pear Hill's members also rushed to the Oneness Sky Palace...
<br><br>
However, due to the attitude of the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race towards Zen, it was impossible for the two races not to step up and take action.
<br><br>
They were hard pressed for time. Every second and every minute were of vital importance.
<br><br>
After placing the three red crystals with their occupants into the flying ship, the seven mountains all sped up.
<br><br>
After most of the core members of the Oneness Sky Palace had boarded the flying ship, a white light ignited from the bottom of the ship. A long and sharp flute sound reverberated through the ship, and the giant flying ship slowly began to rise into the sky.
<br><br>
From the other six mountains, other identically huge flying ships also rose ponderously. Soon after, seven giant flying ships gathered into formation and flew towards the west at tremendous speed.
<br><br>
Inside the Eternal Scroll Painting The moment Zen had stepped into the hexagram array, his form had returned to normal.
<br><br>
Once he clearly saw everything in front of him, his face suddenly froze. "Is this... the last room?"
<br><br>
There was no room inside the black mass. The information the fox girl had provided was false! All that he could see was a huge and empty space. Zen was in a corner of this space, standing atop the stone platform of a hexagram array.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, are all of the rooms in the big vortex similar to this?" Zen queried.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven instantly shook his head. "The other rooms are much smaller, but they are similar to what you would expect. Once you enter through the hexagram array, you will find it possible to merge with the bloodline."
<br><br>
Zen had also come in through the hexagram array, but he seemed to have entered an unusual place.
<br><br>
After observing the room from the stone platform of the hexagram array for a while, Zen finally jumped down.
<br><br>
The ground was a kind of soft soil, and there was a faintly putrid smell to it.
<br><br>
Every step he took left a one-inch-deep footprint on it.
<br><br>
After Zen had taken a dozen steps forward, a figure only half his height suddenly appeared behind him. It appeared to be a human boy with bangs and a pale face, and he was covered with rotting wounds. He looked as lifeless as a corpse.
<br><br>
Once he appeared, he walked forward on the footprints Zen had left. His movements were mechanical and strange. He appeared clumsy when moving his hands and legs. He didn't seem to be human at all when walking and was like a kind of saprophagous animal.
<br><br>
When Zen took a step forward, so did he. The two of them moved almost in unison.
<br><br>
With Zen's high cultivation base, his spiritual sense was constantly alert, but he couldn't even sense the little boy's movements.
<br><br>
Zen walked over a thousand steps, but the small pale-faced boy walked the same amount without showing any strain.
<br><br>
The little boy's legs were short, but with every step he took, he would float into the air for a short distance, moving ever closer and closer to Zen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3835 Infinite Reproduction As soon as the boy was only a step away from him, Zen finally felt that something was wrong, and turned his head in confusion.
<br><br>
Yet, there was nothing behind him.
<br><br>
He frowned as his confusion grew.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
"It seems that something is following me," Zen answered. He sniffed and sensed a cold aura that floated around him.
<br><br>
"This place is a bit strange. You must be careful," the Primeval Lord of Heaven reminded him.
<br><br>
No one had ever entered this world until Zen. The Primeval Lord of Heaven was not sure what was ahead of them, so he could only remind Zen to be careful.
<br><br>
Zen nodded. Just as he was about to take another step forward, the cold aura suddenly intensified.
<br><br>
He quickly turned around and saw the little boy's crumbling face. The little boy opened his bloody mouth, and the cracks at the corners of his mouth extended to his ears. His teeth were as sharp as a beast's tusks. Black saliva, which smelled strongly of blood, dripped from them like threads.
<br><br>
"Fuck off!" Zen roared.
<br><br>
Such an ugly and disgusting face startled him so much that he subconsciously punched the little boy.
<br><br>
Boom! Zen's punch of about forty thousand divine megatons landed on the little boy and disfigured his face and mouth. The force also twisted his body so horribly that it looked like braided dough, then sent it flying several hundred feet away before it crashed on the ground.
<br><br>
'Why is there a monster in the form of little boy in this damned place?' Zen wondered as he moved towards where the boy fell.
<br><br>
The punch smashed the boy's body into a pulp. Zen was sure that he was dead.
<br><br>
Upon closer look at the pit, however, he was shocked.
<br><br>
There was only a twisted piece of human skin left in the pit. It was the boy's skin.
<br><br>
"What's going on?" Zen muttered with a frown.
<br><br>
At that exact moment, he felt a gust of coldness behind him again. When he turned around, he saw many little boys who stood not far away, dispersed around.
<br><br>
All of their mouths were cracked to their ears and revealed their sharp teeth.
<br><br>
At the same time, their eyes glistened with a strange light.
<br><br>
However, the light didn't seem to be malicious, but more of mocking.
<br><br>
"Is this place suitable for you? Can you stay here? Come with me..."
<br><br>
The little boys spoke simultaneously and repeated the same thing. "Are you real?" Zen asked with narrowed eyes.
<br><br>
No one answered him. As the little boys repeated their words, they opened their big mouths and rushed towards him.
<br><br>
Bang! In turn, Zen slightly shook his hand when one of the little boys had neared him.
<br><br>
Thirty thousand divine megatons of force instantly gathered on his fist.
<br><br>
Then he punched the little boy, and the boy's body twisted and flew far away.
<br><br>
He knew that it would be hard to get the origin-level bloodline, but so far, the difficulties he faced were nothing to him.
<br><br>
Although the little boys had horrible faces and strange auras, they were not that strong.
<br><br>
As they continued to get close, Zen threw punches at them.
<br><br>
Every single time, his punches sent the weak-bodied little boys flying with twisted bodies.
<br><br>
Every time Zen attacked, he went to the spot where the little boys' bodies fell, and looked into the pits. Just like before, only pieces of human skin remained.
<br><br>
After he got rid of all the little boys, he took a short break. Suddenly, he felt a strong wind of cold air behind him.
<br><br>
More boys with unusual facial expressions appeared. This time, there were about four thousand of them, and they all looked at Zen with a strange glint in their eyes.
<br><br>
At that point, Zen became serious. This world was certainly real and not an illusion. The current situation was a little alarming. Although these little boys weren't powerful, what if they just kept increasing? Then, the little boys rushed towards him.
<br><br>
A cyan feather appeared above his head. His body became light and nimble, as he flew forward. He had already slipped away before those boys could approach him.
<br><br>
Bang! When some of them caught up with him, Zen slapped their bodies to clear his way. However, more boys appeared every time he killed one of them.
<br><br>
Therefore, he stopped attacking and used his nimble bodily movement skill to travel instead.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the thousands of little boys behind him drooped their heads and repeated, "Is this place suitable for you? Can you stay here? Come with me..."
<br><br>
Then, the large crowd followed closely behind him.
<br><br>
While he ran, the Primeval Lord of Heaven turned around to look, his face twisted into a thoughtful expression.
<br><br>
Since the inheritance of the bloodline took place in the Eternal Scroll Painting, he figured that the four origin-level bloodlines that the fox girl had mentioned must also be in here; there must be a reason why these little boys had appeared.
<br><br>
"It seems to be the end of this world!" Zen suddenly said and disrupted the Primeval Lord of Heaven's thoughts.
<br><br>
The desolate world he was in was small. He only ran for a short distance, but he reached the end.
<br><br>
At the end of this world was a large bronze wall, and there was a crack filled with numerous white dots of light in the center of the wall. The dots were light dots from the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Theoretically speaking, Zen was now in the Abstruse Energy World after he had traveled through the Eternal Scroll Painting. However, someone had forcefully created a space in the Abstruse Energy World with the hexagram array.
<br><br>
In that space, creatures from the chaos could move around freely.
<br><br>
When Zen rushed to the bronze wall, he discovered that there were Sanskrit words on both sides of the crack. "Can you decipher them?" Zen asked the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
Even though the place was too weird, Zen tried out every possible way to get useful information.
<br><br>
"Yes," a voice came from the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
In Stage Thirty of the Other Shore, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization's core began to operate. Soon enough, it deciphered the Sanskrit words on the left. It said: "The origin-level bloodline will reproduce to the limit, then it can be acquired."
<br><br>
Zen was stunned when he heard those words. "Reproduce to the limit? What kind of bloodline is that?"
<br><br>
"I see," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said after a moment of contemplation.
<br><br>
When he thought about the little boys, he immediately realized what had happened. "The bloodline in this deserted world is this infinitely multiplied bloodline. It means that after a person with this bloodline dies, there will be even more of them. Those little boys' words mean something," he explained.
<br><br>
"Is this place suitable for you? Can you stay here? Come with me..."
<br><br>
"Is this place suitable for you? Stay here..."
<br><br>
Those little boys finally caught up and each of them spoke clearly. They were not the creatures of this world, but the bloodline itself.
<br><br>
"After its death, it will still reproduce fast. It is an extremely powerful bloodline!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen's eyes glinted. He didn't describe such a bloodline as strong, but rather a dishonest method.
<br><br>
He didn't believe he could really "infinitely reproduce" if he inherited this bloodline. However, thinking about copies of him fighting by his side, he couldn't doubt the power this bloodline would bring him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3836 The Ultimate Cycle "I can obtain this bloodline when they reproduce to the limit?" Zen muttered.
<br><br>
Then, he turned around and stared at the little boys who pounced on him.
<br><br>
He finally understood what they meant.
<br><br>
These little boys couldn't reproduce infinitely. They would reach their limit if he continuously killed them.
<br><br>
And when they did, then he would be able to obtain the bloodline.
<br><br>
"Well then, let me try!"
<br><br>
He violently kicked another boy who pounced on him to the ground. The moment the boy fell, dozens of more boys appeared.
<br><br>
"It's too slow..."
<br><br>
He lifted his leg and rushed towards the little boys.
<br><br>
He was like a shuttle as he flew and left only a long series of shadows behind. He killed nearly a hundred boys in an instant, who all immediately disappeared except for their skins.
<br><br>
After that, thousands of more boys appeared in the deserted space.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to speed up the slaughter to make the number of the little boys closer to the limit of their reproduction, the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization said, "Pass through the crack and move forward, then you can find the next origin-level bloodline, which is named the 'Ultimate Cycle'."
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Zen stiffened slightly and descended from the sky.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
He trampled dozens of little boys as he went down. "How did you know that?" he asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Because I have deciphered the other Sanskrit word," answered the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
There was a Sanskrit word on each side of the crack in the middle of the bronze wall.
<br><br>
What the Civilization Artifact said just now was the meaning of the other Sanskrit word. "Are you going there to have a look or stay here to merge with this bloodline?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.
<br><br>
After all, Zen himself should make the decision about the bloodline.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, he kicked back, and his body rotated dozens of times in the air before he landed steadily in front of the bronze wall. He looked at the light dots in the crack and said, "I want to go and have a look."
<br><br>
There were four origin-level bloodlines, which should all be different. Thus, he wanted to understand them first before he merged with any of them.
<br><br>
However, he still doubted if he could pass through the Abstruse Energy World or not.
<br><br>
That was because although he had entered the Abstruse Energy World before, his understanding of it was not as good as Geoffrey's. It would be terrible if he couldn't move a single step after entering the passage.
<br><br>
While he thought and hesitated, a large number of little boys swarmed towards him.
<br><br>
Since he didn't have much time to think about it carefully, he decided not to think about it anymore and directly went into the crack.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
As soon as he entered the crack, he turned into countless light dots and flew far away.
<br><br>
In that form, he couldn't control most of his own body, nor could he even tell what form he was in.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the whole process didn't last long. He suddenly felt heavy a few seconds later, then he fell.
<br><br>
Swoosh! It turned out that he fell from the sky of the second world.
<br><br>
Now, the top of the world he was in was also a bronze wall with a downward crack.
<br><br>
He fell dozens of feet more then he began to float steadily in the air. He looked down and saw the entire world.
<br><br>
It was a large cave, and a massive bronze mountain floated in the center. A long, strangely shaped snake was drawn on the mountain's surface. The snake circled, and it seemed that it was devouring its tail.
<br><br>
"What does this painting mean?"
<br><br>
When he was about to get closer to the mountain to see it better, he felt a powerful force that pressed down on him.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
He dropped several thousand feet. He felt the scene in front of him flash by, and he was in front of the mountain again.
<br><br>
"This..."
<br><br>
Before he could say anything else, the gravitational force pressed down once more. He plummeted fast and returned to the side of the mountain again, where he saw the snake that ate itself.
<br><br>
This time, he didn't say anything. He quietly waited for the power to descend.
<br><br>
A few seconds later, the gravitational force pressed down again, and he fell in front of the bronze mountain again.
<br><br>
At that point, he roughly understood what was going on: he had entered a special "cycle", while the snake that ate itself on the bronze mountain also represented a unique cycle.
<br><br>
"I guess that you have to obtain the bloodline of the 'Ultimate Cycle' through constant circulation," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
"That snake is called the Ouroboros. I've seen one in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore once. Its meaning was once compared to the chaos because the chaos is also a cycle that continuously repeats," he explained.
<br><br>
"What's the use of the Ultimate Cycle bloodline?" Zen asked. "Well, I don't know..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven shrugged.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven also found it hard to understand these worlds, but there was one thing he was sure—none of these four origin-level bloodlines was weak.
<br><br>
"At least we know how to obtain the bloodline of the Infinite Reproduction, but there is absolutely no clue about the Ultimate Cycle. I'd better see the next one..."
<br><br>
When he reached the bronze mountain again, Zen abruptly flew towards the side.
<br><br>
The gravitational force did not follow, but allowed Zen to escape from it.
<br><br>
Once he left the circle, he arrived at the far right side of the world. There was another crack there, and on both sides of the crack were two Sanskrit words. The Heavenly Obsession Civilization helped him decipher the messages as well.
<br><br>
The first Sanskrit word explained the meaning of the "Ultimate Cycle", and it was almost the same as he had guessed before. He had to understand the painting of the Ouroboros through repetitive circulations of meditation.
<br><br>
When he completely understood it, then he would naturally obtain this bloodline.
<br><br>
The second Sanskrit word was worthy of his attention. After he entered the crack, he could acquire a bloodline called "Myriad Birth and Destruction".
<br><br>
"The Ways-blending Energy in the chaos already has all essences, and the meaning of the 'Myriad Birth and Destruction' is not hard to imagine. Can it control the birth and destruction of all kinds of energy? If we analyze it literally, it shows that the bloodline is even more powerful," he said in a serious voice.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha, that's impossible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile.
<br><br>
"If the bloodlines could be understood literally, you will be able to reproduce millions of you once you obtain the Infinite Reproduction bloodline. Although these are origin-level bloodlines, they can't be that powerful."
<br><br>
"You're right." Zen nodded.
<br><br>
"But you have already mastered the Ways-blending Energy. Will the Myriad Birth and Destruction be helpful to the Godly Ways Great Unity?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven reminded.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes lit up at those words. He immediately entered the crack.
<br><br>
In less than a second, he passed through the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
He had first thought that the place of Myriad Birth and Destruction might have mixed with all sorts of complex energies.
<br><br>
To his great surprise, the world in front of him was just a flat plain with some dead trees in the center. Purplish-black flowers continuously grew on the branches of the dead trees, and the new blossoms floated and disappeared in the wind.
<br><br>
Zen floated over and stood in the center of the dead trees. Suddenly, a strange feeling filled his heart, and he said, "Things are constantly born and grow; things constantly die and disappear. Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Myriad Birth and Destruction bloodline doesn't refer to energy, but all kinds of things."
<br><br>
Chapter 3837 Something In Return Zen watched as the purplish-black flowers grew, then withered.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he went still, his senses alert. He could feel an invisible force beneath him, penetrating into the soles of his feet.
<br><br>
The force flowed into his body and his eyes widened as he felt a sharp pain in his feet.
<br><br>
He realized that something was spreading throughout his body, spreading from his feet and up his legs.
<br><br>
Startled, he tried to lift his feet and leap upwards, away from the source of the pain.
<br><br>
However, Zen found himself firmly fixed onto the ground. The unknown force was holding fast to his feet.
<br><br>
But he was unfazed. After all, he had not used his full strength yet. He was confident that if he did, he would be able to rise.
<br><br>
He bent his knees, gathered his strength, and forcefully pushed off from the ground. This time he succeeded in soaring upwards. He looked downwards at the spot where he had been standing, and saw a green seedling sprouting in the soil.
<br><br>
He wondered if this seedling had been the cause of the strange sensation of penetration in his feet.
<br><br>
Even as Zen studied the seedling, it continued to grow. It was rapidly rising, growing thicker and larger before his eyes.
<br><br>
'What is this?' Zen thought.
<br><br>
His eyes narrowed in astonishment when the shape of the seedling finally emerged.
<br><br>
The seedling seemed to have grown according to the structure of the meridians within Zen's body. The branches extended and intertwined until they formed a complete human shape that resembled Zen's own form.
<br><br>
"If I hadn't managed to escape, the seedling would have grown inside me, completely filling my meridians!" Zen muttered, frowning.
<br><br>
"It's possible," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven, sounding serious. "Look around you at the other trees in this place. They look remarkably familiar, don't they?"
<br><br>
Zen glanced around him. The Primeval Lord of Heaven was right.
<br><br>
Zen had not closely observed the shapes of the trees, but he realized that each one formed an unusual shape, more like a creature than a standard tree.
<br><br>
On his left, for instance, there was a tree whose branches sloped downwards in the shape of four crawling limbs. There was a cluster of leaves that could be recognized as a head. From a distance, it was shaped like a large beast.
<br><br>
On his right, meanwhile, there was a tree which seemed to have two legs. It stood several hundred feet tall, towering over the other trees. It was the same size as Pompeo. Perhaps this was a member of the Colossus race? "Are they the forms of the creatures who have successfully fused with the Myriad Birth and Destruction?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Perhaps," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven thoughtfully.
<br><br>
"It seems that there are many creatures in the Abstruse Energy World who obtained this origin-level bloodline," Zen commented, looking around him at the surrounding trees. By his count, there were about seventy to eighty different forms of creatures in this forest.
<br><br>
There was a strange sound.
<br><br>
Zen immediately turned in the direction of the noise. It was coming from the seedling. He stared as the rich green foliage faded away to yellow, then darkened into black. In a moment, the black tree had crumbled into ashes that blew away on the wind. There was no trace of it left behind.
<br><br>
"It seems that these plants have to grow inside creatures in order to survive," Zen mused.
<br><br>
To confirm his conjecture, Zen returned to the ground and stood still until he sensed two pinpricks touching the soles of his feet. Before they could penetrate, he leapt up once more.
<br><br>
The seedling, failing to stab into his body, didn't even grow. It just darkened and returned to the soil.
<br><br>
"What a powerful origin-level bloodline!" Zen said. "It's able to penetrate easily through my Chaotic Source Spirits. But I want to see the last bloodline before I make my decision."
<br><br>
Zen was determined to witness the power of all the origin-level bloodlines one by one. He would take his time weighing each bloodline and considering the advantages and disadvantages of each, before he made his final decision.
<br><br>
With that, he flew towards the edge of the forest, where the space ended.
<br><br>
Similar to the previous spaces, there was a crack in the bronze wall marked by two Sanskrit words. One of these words explained how to obtain the Myriad Birth and Destruction.
<br><br>
Zen's speculation was partly correct. In order to obtain the Myriad Birth and Destruction, he would have to let the seedling take root and sprout inside his body.
<br><br>
However, there was one aspect in which he was mistaken. The various forms of trees in that forest were not creatures that had successfully fused with the bloodline — in fact, they were the losers! Those who successfully fused with the bloodline had left this space with the seedlings growing in their bodies. This was what 'Birth' meant.
<br><br>
The losers, however, would have to stay here forever, turning into dead trees. This was the other side of the coin: 'Destruction.' Zen raised his eyebrows, thinking of the heavy price to be paid for failing to fuse successfully with this bloodline.
<br><br>
Of course, he thought, there might also be a price to pay for the failure of fusing with the first two bloodlines. It was just that Zen hadn't discovered what they were.
<br><br>
The second Sanskrit word recorded the information of the final bloodline, which was called the Infinite Time and Space.
<br><br>
Zen passed through the crack. He gazed around him at the space and saw a long line formed by numerous cubes. Each of these cubes was a separate space, arranged neatly in a row. They were of varying sizes. Each cube revolved along the line according to a certain rule.
<br><br>
Zen did not try to approach the cubes.
<br><br>
From the name and the structure of this area, Zen could tell that the Infinite Time and Space had a certain connection with the power of space, and perhaps it also had a certain connection with the power of time. He quickly grasped that if he got trapped in one of those strange spaces, it would be extremely difficult to get out.
<br><br>
Zen fell into deep thought. He now had an understanding of the four originlevel bloodlines, yet he couldn't decide which was better suited to his needs.
<br><br>
They were all origin-level bloodlines so none of them would be a bad choice, but which one was the best? "Primeval Lord of Heaven..." he pleaded.
<br><br>
"Zen, you must make this decision by yourself," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven calmly. "I can't give you any advice."
<br><br>
This step that Zen had taken was a new domain, one entirely unfamiliar to the Primeval Lord of Heaven. Because he had not encountered this before, he had no advice to give Zen.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the rows of cubes rotating in front of him, feeling deeply ambivalent.
<br><br>
As he hesitated, a movement caught his eye. A shadow had flashed within one of the cubes. It was a pale face with thin scales on it, and there were three sharp horns on the top of its head, but the front horn was broken.
<br><br>
The face was framed by a crown of disheveled hair. It screwed up its features, seeming to be exerting all its strength to send a series of sounds towards Zen. It sounded like a strange song.
<br><br>
'Is this the language of the Abstruse Energy World?' he thought. He kept his eyes on the face and commanded, "The Heavenly Obsession Civilization, please decipher that for me."
<br><br>
"It is being deciphered," said a woman's voice from the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
Just as the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization was activated to decipher the words, the cube containing the face mixed with the other cubes, gradually moving away. It was some distance from Zen when the Heavenly Obsession Civilization finally finished deciphering the song.
<br><br>
"You are here to obtain a bloodline, aren't you? Do you want a stronger bloodline?"
<br><br>
Zen was astonished.
<br><br>
Weren't the origin-level bloodlines the strongest? Was there a stronger bloodline out there? His interest piqued, Zen leapt up into the air, moving so quickly that he looked like a blur.
<br><br>
He went in the direction of the cube with the face, but no matter how he scanned the long row of cubes, he could no longer find it. The face had vanished.
<br><br>
Zen was agitated. But as he returned to his spot, he reminded himself that there was only a finite number of cubes within this space, and all the cubes were lined up in a certain order. As long as Zen waited on the same spot, it would appear before him sooner or later.
<br><br>
Patiently, he stood there, considering the idea of an even stronger bloodline.
<br><br>
After a long while, the cube with the pale face finally appeared again. It sang the same song to Zen.
<br><br>
"Do you want to get a stronger bloodline? One stronger than the four origin-level bloodlines?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I do,"
<br><br>
Zen called out in a determined tone. He moved forward to stay with the cube, not wanting to lose track of it again.
<br><br>
However, he remembered that the face could not understand his language.
<br><br>
"Primeval Lord of Heaven, I need your help..."
<br><br>
When he was in Stage Thirty, Zen had communicated with Pompeo by interpreting his words into the language of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Back then, the energy souls of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and other human heroes had helped him convey his words by chorusing to Pompeo.
<br><br>
Later, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had specially trained a group to deal with this sort of situation, but they had never come in handy. Until now. It was finally time for them to demonstrate their worth.
<br><br>
With the group's chorus, Zen conveyed his reply to the face. "I want the strongest of all bloodlines."
<br><br>
"I'll tell you what you want to know, but I will need something in return..."
<br><br>
The pale face spoke in a hoarse, weak voice.
<br><br>
"What is it?" Zen asked. He was prepared to do almost anything the face demanded.
<br><br>
"You must kill me, please!"
<br><br>
Zen was taken aback by this unexpected reply. His eyes narrowed as he gazed closely upon the face, noting the look of desperation etched on its features. He was stunned, understanding at last that he was speaking to a being that was imprisoned within the cube.
<br><br>
Chapter 3838 The Eternal Divine Courtyard After a brief exchange with Zen, the human face in the cube let out a cry brimming with agony.
<br><br>
The face switched colors between fiery red with frustration to pale white, and then again from pale white to red.
<br><br>
"Pro...promise me..." He continued to sing, his voice soft and filled with grief. It was as if he was desperately holding on to every ounce of sincerity left within his existence through the painful song.
<br><br>
Zen felt a strange empathy take over him as he felt his emotions scatter all over the place through the song. Only those who desperately awaited the sweet release of death would display such sentiments.
<br><br>
"Alright, I promise." Zen gave a slight nod then looked up in his direction.
<br><br>
"But you have to tell me the situation here first."
<br><br>
The people who resided in the chaos were left in the dark when it came to the Abstruse Energy World; they knew little to nothing about it.
<br><br>
However, it wasn't as if they had no interest in exploring the world beyond their boundaries. For instance, Ziya and the members of the Element Spirit Civilization harbored an undying passion when it came to exploring the outside world. They had spent most of their lives traveling to discover what lay beyond their world.
<br><br>
In fact, it was because they were bound by the constraints holding them down as creatures of the chaos that they were unable to go too far...
<br><br>
Their scenario of entering the Abstruse Energy World could be equated to that of a blind man walking into a colorful world. Witnessing the whole world in all its contrasts and colors was always considered to be an ambitious thing to accomplish.
<br><br>
"This is the Eternal Divine Courtyard, which has already been deserted. It was sealed by the Time Lock a long time ago. Logically speaking, no one can approach this place. I don't know how you came in, but since you have come in, I'm assuming your goal must be for the origin-level bloodline, right?" the face asked.
<br><br>
"Yes. That is correct." Zen nodded in response as he captured several words that the face had said.
<br><br>
Eternal Divine Courtyard, Time Lock, deserted... All these things the face had said left Zen in a daze, his thoughts running amok in his head.
<br><br>
Was it possible that the Eternal Scroll Painting was connected to a deserted land? "The Eternal Divine Courtyard is the land where they keep their bloodlines.
<br><br>
The root-level bloodlines are hidden in the lower layer, and the origin-level bloodlines are hidden in the second layer. While that place..." The face took a short pause between his explanation to look upwards, before saying, "That's where the ancestry-level bloodline is."
<br><br>
"Ancestry-level?" Zen blinked several times, taken aback.
<br><br>
"Yes, ancestry-level bloodline! That's what provided them with a foundation to gain a firm foothold and also the foundation for them to fight other worlds..." The more he explained the mechanisms of the world, the more his expressions overflowed with overwhelming excitement. He grew red as if he had used all his strength to talk. "You should be grateful for the existence of the Time Lock. They thought no one could enter this deserted Eternal Divine Courtyard. Otherwise, you would have been long doomed.
<br><br>
Hahaha..."
<br><br>
After he finished speaking, Zen took his time to examine this mad guy in utter bewilderment. He was lost for words for a moment.
<br><br>
As per the face's statements, he had stumbled upon a place that restricted outsiders from breaching its boundaries.
<br><br>
Or maybe, the small passage Zen came through of the Eternal Scroll Painting had been built a long time ago. It was possible for the so-called "they" the face spoke of to have overlooked it when they used the Time Lock to seal off the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Because of that, Zen was able to trespass on their land under fortunate circumstances Zen assumed that to be the case.
<br><br>
"Go ahead. The ancestry-level bloodline is right above there. You must get it. They might never have expected that one day an outsider would enter here..."
<br><br>
After the man went on talking for a fair amount of time, he suddenly went quiet abruptly. It was as if he remembered something he initially set out to do. He looked at Zen and spoke straightforwardly, "Now that I've told you all you need to know. You must kill me."
<br><br>
His eyes gleamed with vibrant color; they depicted vivid traces of slyness.
<br><br>
"You need to tell me how to get to the upper layer first," Zen said as he looked at the face and pointed upwards. Zen didn't notice any other crack in this space.
<br><br>
"No. You have to kill me first," the man demanded with a firm tone as he pressed Zen to give him what he wanted.
<br><br>
Zen glanced over at the face to read his expressions: he now looked impatient, his eyes more desperate than ever. Slowly switching his gaze from the man to the space ahead of him, Zen shrugged his shoulders indifferently and said in a solemn voice, "If that's how it is, then I apologize. I guess I'll have to look for it myself."
<br><br>
When he finished declaring his intentions, Zen slowly began to ascend upwards.
<br><br>
"No! Please, stop!"
<br><br>
Now in a panicked state, the man let out a desperate cry. In a moment of desperation he pounced towards Zen, completely forgetting the fact that Zen was outside the cube.
<br><br>
However, the cube was exceptionally rigid; it was crafted with no margin for errors. Thus, it was almost impossible to break through from the inside.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang, Bang..."
<br><br>
With a series of blows that landed directly on the shackle, the man attempted to escape the prison he was in. But it was all to no avail. No matter how high of energy he exerted on the cube, it refused to budge. To his dismay, it just rotated in place, mocking him in all his failed attempts.
<br><br>
When he tried to hit the cube with all his might, every detail of his physique lay bare to Zen.
<br><br>
The upper portion of his body, from his abdomen to his face, appeared to be human. However, the lower part had eight sharp legs, like that of a spider.
<br><br>
At the ends of each leg was an eye that shot sharp light columns to bombard the cube with continuous attacks.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
His constant blows immersed in his fury fluctuated in the form of terrifying energy that enveloped the cube. Even though the cube successfully absorbed all of his intense attacks, it still surprised Zen as he watched without blinking even once.
<br><br>
Zen heaved a sigh of relief in his thoughts as he made the right call of not releasing him.
<br><br>
With eyes full of despair, the man saw Zen ascend into the sky and grow smaller in size as he slowly went out of sight. Dropping everything, he stopped struggling to fight his fate and slumped back down.
<br><br>
Being locked up in the same place for countless years, he had fantasized about ending his life and escaping this sorry fate more than once.
<br><br>
Regardless of his situation, he still held a small glimmer of hope. What if someone were to reset this Eternal Divine Courtyard? He knew his wish had slim chances of coming true. Even so, he lived on harboring grave agony in his restricted space. But now, this opportunity finally came face to face with him.
<br><br>
People outside could freely enter the cube. As long as anything outside came in contact with him, he would be able to walk out of the cube successfully. At the same time, he would obtain the bloodline at the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. It was the bloodline of ancestries.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for him...
<br><br>
He finally came so close to achieving all his life-long ambitions, only to have them snatched away from him by Zen.
<br><br>
So close, yet so far...
<br><br>
What was worse was that he had revealed enough information to set Zen on his way. His initial intentions were merely to gain enough of Zen's trust to trick him into releasing him, but it backfired.
<br><br>
Zen floated above this space, he scanned his surroundings to look for a passageway that would lead him to the upper layer.
<br><br>
He could feel that what the spider man had told him was not a complete lie.
<br><br>
There was some truth hidden beneath those words. At least, he had a chance to see what the Abstruse Energy World was like.
<br><br>
There was also a layer of bronze wall above this space. There were no evident cracks on it, so Zen naturally couldn't pass through it.
<br><br>
After examining the bronze wall for a bit and studying its mechanisms, Zen decided on punching his way through it to pass.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Over ten thousand divine megatons of force exploded in abundance as it hit the bronze wall. It was as if Zen was pounding on a gigantic drum with his fists. The loud rumbling sound of his fists making contact with the wall echoed throughout the vast space.
<br><br>
"It's hollow on the inside. Maybe I can break it open by force?"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Thirty thousand divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
Fifty thousand divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
One hundred thousand divine megatons of force...
<br><br>
Even when Zen exerted the limit of the Chaotic Source Spirits and smashed with a force of one hundred thousand divine megatons, it bore no fruit. The bronze wall remained sturdy and stood tall without having moved an inch.
<br><br>
However, Zen did not plan on giving up after coming this far. If one hundred thousand divine megatons of force couldn't break it open, then he would have to wait until the Celestial Spear was fully restored. With the help of the Celestial Spear, he might be able to force it open.
<br><br>
"You can't open it. Without my guidance, you will never be able to get the ancestry-level bloodline..." The spider man in the cube below began to sing again after having witnessed Zen struggling to get past. "I can make a deal with you, as long as you..."
<br><br>
"Heavenly Obsession Civilization, there's no need to decipher his words,"
<br><br>
Zen said abruptly.
<br><br>
Even if he could release this spider man without himself getting hurt, the latter would probably still kill him the first chance he'd get and later obtain the ancestry-level bloodline. There was no point in communicating with him anymore.
<br><br>
After the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization stopped deciphering, the spider man's voice was reduced to a rhythmic wail like that of ghosts and wolves to him.
<br><br>
Crossing his arms, Zen stared hard at the bronze wall above his head and processed different ways he could use to get through it in his mind.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he stumbled across a clear pattern etched over the bronze wall.
<br><br>
The pattern had previously been covered by thick dust. As Zen launched constant blows without pause, the layer of dust was shaken off by the continuous tremors of the bronze wall. Naturally, the pattern that was once veiled by the dust was revealed out in the open.
<br><br>
Chapter 3839 Four Creatures The pattern on the bronze wall was incredibly large. Zen was only able to see it in its entirety after descending a fair distance.
<br><br>
"Bird, monkey, snake and human being?"
<br><br>
The four patterns had been lengthened deliberately and weren't totally accurate, but one could vaguely tell the types of creatures from the outlines.
<br><br>
The bird's feet arched back, the monkey's tail was like a long stick and the snake was covered in spikes. Only the human being appeared relatively normal, but no one even knew if it was actually a human being.
<br><br>
Among the four patterns was the pattern of a door.
<br><br>
The door caught Zen's attention and it filled his heart with joy. His body floated towards it, and although it was a painting, since it appeared here, there would be a way for him to pass through it.
<br><br>
But as he approached, the door's lines began emitting an ominous red light and at the same time a powerful repulsive force hit and pushed him down a distance.
<br><br>
The force was not all that strong to Zen. He was frustrated and refused to give in, so he accelerated and rushed up, hoping to force his way through the door.
<br><br>
But unexpectedly, as he sped up, the repulsive force increased by a thousand times and hit back! "Hoo!"
<br><br>
The incredible force knocked him from the air and sent him smashing down hard into the ground.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
On his way down, he was falling towards the cubes! The purpose of entering these cubes was to attempt to fuse with the bloodline known as the Infinite Time and Space. Zen was more interested in the ancestry-level bloodline the spider man had mentioned. On the other hand, he wasn't absolutely confident in merging with that bloodline.
<br><br>
If he failed and was trapped in the cube, he'd be in serious trouble...
<br><br>
As he fell towards a cube, in a moment of desperation, he released a burst of strength and twisted his body violently, his upper and lower body shifting to an unnatural angle.
<br><br>
He dodged, brushing one of the cubes as he passed by before finally smashing into the ground.
<br><br>
"Humph. Why am I so unlucky!"
<br><br>
The spider man crawled in the cube and looked at Zen with resentment and jealousy.
<br><br>
There was a connection between the cubes, so the spider man wished Zen would fall into one of them and accompany him. But in the end, it was not Zen's fate to fall into any of them.
<br><br>
Zen had already discovered the textures on the ceiling and as he was a human being, he'd be able to pass through it sooner or later.
<br><br>
This thought encouraged the spider man not to give up. He put on a kind face and asked, "May I discuss something with you? If you successfully obtain..."
<br><br>
After the sounds of singing rang out, Zen glanced at the spider man with confusion and then flew up to the ceiling.
<br><br>
"Damn it!" the spider man cursed, gritting his teeth again.
<br><br>
Zen had no time for his nonsense, and he was focused on trying to find a way through the door.
<br><br>
"Four patterns correspond to four orders, right?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven was unsure himself and warned, "Zen, when you approach these textures, be careful..."
<br><br>
Great peril would befall him if he accidentally triggered some mechanism or form of punishment.
<br><br>
He leaned towards the monkey on the left. When he was ten feet from the pattern, the textures shone with a deep red light.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
"Roar!"
<br><br>
A fierce roar came from the pattern as the light flashed, as if a truly powerful monkey was actually there roaring.
<br><br>
Zen made the sensible decision to stop in his path and retreat.
<br><br>
He then approached the bird's pattern and much like the monkey, it flashed red light and a loud squawk echoed out.
<br><br>
The squawk had a strong sense of threat within it. Zen was obviously not allowed to go near it.
<br><br>
His two attempts had been shut down, so he decided against approaching the snake.
<br><br>
"I don't think this is the mechanism to open the door, but some sort of qualification test. If so, there's only one option," Zen said, breathing deeply and looking at the pattern of the human being. If he didn't qualify, he would not be able to pass through.
<br><br>
"It's a human shaped pattern so any human qualifies here, right?" "Could it be that the human race also holds a high status in the Abstruse Energy Civilization?" wondered the Primeval Lord of Heaven, smiling.
<br><br>
Under the leadership of the human ancestor, the human race had once risen to prominence, and in that time felt that they were the most special of the races.
<br><br>
Later, their Finale Way failed and they were defeated during the war with the Element Spirit Civilization in the Three Purities Stage. The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the human elites later reflected on what had happened and realized that perhaps they were not all that special.
<br><br>
But now, the human pattern in the Eternal Divine Courtyard reminded the Primeval Lord of Heaven of the past, and he began thinking that humans might not be as simple as they had imagined.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Zen approached the human being pattern. It flashed with a green light which quickly spread in the direction of the door, turning the entire door green as well.
<br><br>
"It works!"
<br><br>
Zen's face lit up as he moved towards the door once more.
<br><br>
This time, no repulsive force fought back and he touched the door without resistance.
<br><br>
He tried to push it, but when he did, he discovered that the door was completely illusory and his hands went straight into the bronze wall...
<br><br>
The spider man watched hopelessly, burning with jealousy, as Zen drilled into the wall. Seeing Zen so easily enter the place he had been yearning for depressed him deeply.
<br><br>
Zen moved through the short passage in the bronze wall and came out the other side.
<br><br>
As he emerged, before him stood a wide bronze square with a huge dome above it, supported by four thick pillars with four statues mounted on them.
<br><br>
The statues were of the bird, monkey, snake and human being that he had seen before.
<br><br>
"It seems these four creatures are grouped together," Zen said.
<br><br>
It seemed likely that these four races were born together, forming an extremely powerful civilization.
<br><br>
"But what do these four races have to do with the Instant Civilization and the chaos?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, frowning.
<br><br>
"We'll know by the end of all this," Zen replied, walking towards the center of the square. There appeared to be a cup as tall as a person, with something in it and patterns carved on it.
<br><br>
As he stepped into the center of the square, the eyes of the four statues ignited in a red light at the same time.
<br><br>
They all came to life, their bronze carved bodies peeling off from the pillars and smashing into the bronze square with a thunderous bang. The bronze snake with spikes all across its body was the first to speak, "How has a human being made it here?"
<br><br>
"Anyone who enters the Eternal Divine Courtyard will be killed!"
<br><br>
The bronze monkey was bad-tempered and rushed towards Zen aggressively.
<br><br>
Chapter 3840 The Blood In The Cup When the bronze monkey was halfway to Zen, the bronze human on the other side caught hold of him and pulled him back.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom...
<br><br>
The footsteps thundered loudly on the bronze square.
<br><br>
Incensed, the bronze monkey asked, "Why did you stop me?"
<br><br>
"This era no longer belongs to us. This place has been abandoned since ages ago and there's no need for us to guard it anymore," the bronze human said.
<br><br>
The bronze bird and snake stopped short at these words. What was the point of them following the old rules? "I don't care. All I know is that outsiders are not allowed to step in here!"
<br><br>
The bronze monkey's flexible body allowed him to shake off the bronze human's grip and break free. He charged towards Zen but skidded to a halt at the bronze human's next words.
<br><br>
"What if he is not an outsider? This place is sealed by the Time Lock. It would be impossible for any outsider to enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
Do you think he has the ability to break the Time Lock and force his way in?"
<br><br>
"I'm not sure,"
<br><br>
the bronze monkey said hesitantly.
<br><br>
"We can first check if he is qualified. Even if he isn't, we can let him try,"
<br><br>
the bronze human said.
<br><br>
They knew that this place was abandoned but were still faithfully fulfilling their duties.
<br><br>
A vast majority of the people who entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard could only obtain the source-level bloodlines that were at the bottom, while a few could obtain the root-level bloodlines. Very few could take away one of the four origin-level bloodlines.
<br><br>
The warriors who could enter this bronze square were all top existences in their respective worlds.
<br><br>
But even they often failed. It was considered lucky even if two out of ten people could succeed.
<br><br>
There were hardly any people who could obtain the ancestry-level bloodline. People from these worlds were not qualified, which was why they took it for granted that this human who had suddenly appeared wasn't qualified either.
<br><br>
The bronze monkey hesitated for a moment and then gathered his wits before saying, "Are you out of your mind? Who else is qualified aside from them? Killing him is the right thing!"
<br><br>
Zen's attention snapped back into vigilance as the bronze monkey spoke.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Obsession Civilization hadn't translated the words of these statues at the beginning. But Zen heard them clearly, now that the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been activated.
<br><br>
They thought he was not qualified enough, which was why they were planning to kill him.
<br><br>
However, the bronze human smiled. "Let him in since he's already here. If he doesn't have the qualifications, he can't escape death. It will save you the energy of killing him. Don't you think you should give him a chance?"
<br><br>
There would be a price to pay if one failed to acquire the origin-level bloodline. For example, the trees in the Myriad Birth and Destruction, and the permanent imprisonment by the cubes of the Infinite Time and Space were the ends that some warriors had met when they had failed.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was stricter, and Zen would die if he failed.
<br><br>
The bronze monkey was still hesitant. He felt that giving Zen a chance was an act irreverent to the Eternal Divine Courtyard. But the snake and bird beside him agreed unanimously with the bronze human.
<br><br>
"Giving him a chance is not such a big deal."
<br><br>
"Let him choose his manner of death, since he is going to die anyway."
<br><br>
The bronze snake and the bronze bird were saying thus only because they had been in here for far too long, devoid of any entertainment. They just wanted to see something new.
<br><br>
They didn't care if Zen could obtain the ancestry-level bloodline or not, or whether or not he would die.
<br><br>
Since everyone else thought the same, the bronze monkey realized that it was meaningless to insist. He scoffed impatiently and retreated a couple of steps, still staring at Zen with hostility.
<br><br>
Clump! Clump...
<br><br>
The bronze human walked up to Zen and asked, "Can you understand me?"
<br><br>
Zen nodded, and at the same time, a chorus sounded from his inner world as if to reply, "Yes."
<br><br>
"It's a strange way of communication," the bronze human remarked, looking curiously at Zen. "It's good that we can communicate. And since you understand what we were just talking, there's only one way out for you."
<br><br>
Bang! The bronze human stomped his feet, and the bronze square began to shine.
<br><br>
The bronze wine cup at the center of the square began to emit a brilliant light that formed a bright road that stretched all the way up to Zen's feet.
<br><br>
"You can survive only if you can merge with the bloodline. You will die otherwise. I helped you get this chance only because I am of your kind. You have to depend on yourself from now on," the bronze human said as he walked towards his pillar.
<br><br>
"Sir?"
<br><br>
Zen had a number of doubts.
<br><br>
These bronze statues, however, were not "sirs". They were just a group of bronze puppets with memories and emotions.
<br><br>
They wouldn't heed Zen's other requests.
<br><br>
The four giant statues quickly returned to the pillars. The light in their eyes dimmed and they turned into real statues.
<br><br>
Zen's eyebrows shot up as he looked at the shiny road under his feet. "It looks like there's no way back."
<br><br>
Zen had clearly heard the conversation between the statues.
<br><br>
Inheriting the ancestry-level bloodline wasn't dependent on perseverance, talent, or strength. Instead, it needed some specific qualifications.
<br><br>
Judging from the monkey's attitude, it was obvious that he wasn't qualified.
<br><br>
Did this mean that he would most definitely die, since he was not qualified? "I'm afraid you won't get a chance to go back." The Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice sounded in Zen's mind, a bitter smile lacing through it.
<br><br>
Zen heaved a sigh. "It looks like the spider man trapped in the lower layer didn't know all this. All I can do is try my best."
<br><br>
Zen had been confident when he had been in the big vortex.
<br><br>
After all, the fox girl had given him a unique ability, enabling him to walk freely within the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
But he did not have anything special to rely on here, especially since obtaining the ancestry-level bloodline was more than the fox girl had expected of him. He was unsure about whether or not he could succeed.
<br><br>
Zen followed this path and came upon the huge cup.
<br><br>
Buzz! As Zen approached the cup, the lights rose inch by inch and formed a staircase that finally reached the rim of the cup.
<br><br>
Zen walked up the stairs and as he reached the peak, he saw everything that was in the cup.
<br><br>
The cup was filled with a thick, crimson liquid that seemed to be in a constant state of motion.
<br><br>
As the liquid flowed, deep cracks, irregular like the teeth of a monster, appeared from time to time.
<br><br>
The liquid in this cup began to react the moment Zen stepped on the stairs.
<br><br>
A chasm seemed to appear at the center of the liquid, expanding rapidly and turning into a monster with its large mouth wide open.
<br><br>
Zen hesitated as he stood on the steps before walking forward into the big bloody mouth.
<br><br>
The thick blood wrapped around Zen the moment it touched his body. From the outside, it looked like he was wearing a well-fitting blood robe. .
<br><br>
A few seconds later, countless tiny bubbles appeared on the surface of the blood robe, making it look like the blood was boiling.
<br><br>
The blood robe began to shrink rapidly, a large amount of thick blood beginning to merge with Zen in the process.
<br><br>
Chapter 3841 Window The bronze statues on the four pillars silently watched all of this.
<br><br>
Their eyes shifted, as if they were looking at a dead person.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was by no means something that ordinary people could touch. The bronze statues were sure that Zen was courting death.
<br><br>
The word 'ancestry' was very easy to understand. The mass of blood in the sacred cup was ancestral to all bloodlines.
<br><br>
Only the strongest were qualified enough to tame the ancestry-level bloodline and find their own path that suited them.
<br><br>
That was why the abilities that the ancestry-level bloodline could display weren't fixed. Everyone who successfully fused with the ancestry-level bloodline would obtain a unique power.
<br><br>
They stood together at the source of all bloodlines, and then chose a direction and opened up a path.
<br><br>
Four of the directions were widely known. These were the four origin-level bloodlines in the lower layer. These bloodlines had been born from the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Buzz! A huge circle appeared around the cup and short light columns emerged from within, creating a symmetrical map.
<br><br>
A grand ceremony was held when a warrior began fusing with the ancestrylevel bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
Here, the strongest warriors in all the worlds would prostrate themselves around the square and become devout believers.
<br><br>
This revelry was sometimes like a ceremony to be held before executions.
<br><br>
And since most creatures entering the sacred cup couldn't escape death, what followed the ceremony was usually death rather than success.
<br><br>
"The map has appeared."
<br><br>
The bronze human was looking at the circle of light outside the cup.
<br><br>
When the people in the cup began to merge with the bloodline, light columns would rise from the bottom of the cup. There were a total of three hundred and seventy-three light columns, and each of them represented a possible ability of the ancestry-level bloodline. This was the bloodline map.
<br><br>
The bloodline map formed by the three hundred and seventy-three light columns had a number of changes, extending to the infinite. This meant that the ancestry-level bloodline had an infinite number of abilities. Even the bronze statues hadn't completely understood the bloodline map. They had roughly classified the abilities of the bloodline into four categories.
<br><br>
If there were more light columns on the upper left, it meant that the ability of the fused ancestry-level bloodline would be more about creation. If there were more light columns on the upper right side, it would be about space and time. If there were more light columns on the lower left side, it would be more about life, and if there were more light pillars on the lower right side, it would be about destruction.
<br><br>
With so many different light columns extending from the bottom of the cup, there would be a combination that could not be classified into any of the four categories. This classification could only be used as a reference.
<br><br>
"All the light columns begin to extend, but they will soon stop," the bronze monkey said disdainfully.
<br><br>
Even if a pig were to be thrown into the cup, all the light columns at the bottom of the cup would rise a few feet once the ancestry-level bloodline got into the pig.
<br><br>
These light columns represented the potential of the creatures in the cup.
<br><br>
When their potential was exhausted, their lives would come to an end.
<br><br>
They could escape death only if there was at least one light column connected to the surrounding circle of light before the potential was exhausted. It would then mean that the person in the cup was qualified to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"They stopped?" The bronze snake said, his attention fixed on the movements of the light columns at all times.
<br><br>
The sacred cup was at their center when the surrounding light columns came to a stop.
<br><br>
The originally crimson human shape began to slowly melt in the sacred cup, turning back into thick blood and sinking into the cup.
<br><br>
"He is dead. He was devoured by the ancestry-level bloodline, unable to bear its pressure," the bronze monkey sneered.
<br><br>
The bronze human remained silent.
<br><br>
He was, in fact, hopeful. This person had been able to break into this place, seemingly without reason. Was it just a coincidence? Was he really failing? 'What am I thinking about? It is only normal that he fails to merge with the ancestry-level bloodline, isn't it?' the bronze human thought and shook his head.
<br><br>
If the monkey wasn't so hot-tempered, he would have talked more with this person. At least he would have known where he came from.
<br><br>
"The light columns haven't disappeared," the bronze snake said suddenly.
<br><br>
The four statues were puzzled. If he really died, the map would disappear, and everything would return to its original state.
<br><br>
Was there something wrong with the cup because it hadn't been used for a long time? They watched in confusion as two of the light columns began to rapidly expand.
<br><br>
These two light columns were located on the lower left side. Light columns in this area usually meant that the ancestry-level bloodline possessed the life attribute.
<br><br>
"He is dead. But why are the light columns still growing?" the bronze bird asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Something must be wrong," the bronze monkey sighed.
<br><br>
There was indeed something wrong with the bronze square, the sacred cup, and the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Would it be their turn next? This place was called the Eternal Divine Courtyard, but there was no real eternity or immortality in this world.
<br><br>
Plop! Plop...
<br><br>
The thick bloodline in the cup suddenly turned into something very strange.
<br><br>
A figure slowly emerged from the cup not long after.
<br><br>
"Blood Merge Reconstruction?" the bronze human exclaimed in surprise.
<br><br>
The other three bronze statues were equally shocked.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline had unlimited possibilities.
<br><br>
Once, someone had entered the ancestry-level bloodline and turned into a golden statue. Also, once someone had touched the ancestry-level bloodline and disappeared into a wisp of cyan smoke.
<br><br>
There were simply too many combinations among the three hundred and seventy-three special attributes. No one could predict what would finally happen.
<br><br>
The Blood Merge Reconstruction was extremely rare.
<br><br>
When the ancestry-level bloodline had invaded Zen from within, a sharp pain shot through every part of his body. He felt like his body was boiling.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was special. It could merge with almost anything, ranging from skin, to bones, internal organs, blood, and even souls.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't even move, let alone get rid of it. He could only watch as his entire body was devoured by the ancestry-level bloodline. It was not long before he sank into the darkness.
<br><br>
Zen originally had two kinds of bloodline power within his body. They now began to merge with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The first kind of bloodline power he had had was from Chiyou, which was a kind of source-level bloodline The second kind of blood power was from a Chaos Ancient God. The six great bloodlines of the Chaos Ancient Gods were not at the source level, but were directly derived from the truth in the chaos. However, they were on par with the bloodlines at the root level. This was why there was one long and one short light columns with the life attribute extending from the bottom of the sacred cup.
<br><br>
In this absolute darkness, Zen watched as specks of light appeared in the distance.
<br><br>
Zen had lost his vision, and his five senses were numb. He didn't know what form of existence he was now.
<br><br>
But when he noticed these dots of light, he had a faint feeling that they were related to each other and formed the image of a mountain.
<br><br>
He wanted to reach out, but couldn't. He wanted to sense what they were, but there was no way he could use his senses.
<br><br>
What were they showing him? The mystery of the Abstruse Energy World? Or was this some kind of a special test? In the Abstruse Energy World...
<br><br>
Some light dots floated, the result of the combination showing that a creature was moving.
<br><br>
This creature was none other than Geoffrey.
<br><br>
There was a rope around Geoffrey's waist, and behind him was Ziya, who held the other end of the rope.
<br><br>
It looked like Geoffrey was dragging a blind person forward.
<br><br>
Once they had entered the Abstruse Energy World, Geoffrey was unable to communicate with Ziya.
<br><br>
This was not Geoffrey's fault, because Ziya could neither hear the voice nor speak.
<br><br>
In his last exploration, Geoffrey had already crossed the grassland and seen a mountain which was beyond description. He climbed up the mountain out of curiosity and surprisingly found a window, similar to the one that Ziya had broken through from within the chaos.
<br><br>
Chapter 3842 The World Within The Window This window was much different from the one Ziya had opened. It was large enough in size to be considered as a door.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had a strong sense of awareness about the limits of his strength.
<br><br>
Even if he cultivated under the watchful guidance of Ziya, it was still too risky for him to explore the unknown Abstruse Energy World without the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits and the support of the Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Geoffrey voluntarily decided to retreat. The fear of the unknown of what might lie on the other side of the window prevented him from crossing it.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey returned to Ziya and debriefed him about what he discovered, it piqued his interest.
<br><br>
In the past, Ziya had explored a small portion of the vast Abstruse Energy World. Based on all his findings, he had made a conclusion about it. He suspected the existence of other secondary worlds within the boundaries of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
However, there was nowhere to prove Ziya's statement right as he had only scratched the surface when he explored it. The range he could travel in was quite limited back then. He was only able to explore the nearby areas due to the fear of losing the lifeline that was tied to him. If it were to be cut off, the chances of him ever returning would be lost with it.
<br><br>
But after he was joined by Geoffrey, the range of his activities expanded to a higher degree than before. The only remaining issue was encountering the tentacle monsters on the grassland.
<br><br>
The tentacle monsters weren't that strong, and they weren't dominant in numbers either. If Ziya could move freely in the Abstruse Energy World, he would obliterate them without breaking a sweat. The only thing holding him back was the fact that he had no fighting ability when he stepped into the boundaries of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
"I think we can capture those tentacle monsters in the cave if we fish them out," Geoffrey suggested after studying the situation.
<br><br>
"Fishing? That's a great idea!" Ziya exclaimed with excitement as he clasped his hands together.
<br><br>
The days that followed, Geoffrey worked closely with Ziya to put their plan into action. They pulled long ropes into the grassland and tied live cattle and pigs at the ends to act as bait. Ziya created this livestock using the Truth of Three Energy Construction for the specific purpose of using them to reel in the monsters. They didn't possess much intelligence and were rather docile since they didn't even resist while being sent into the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Soon after the traps were set, one after the other, the tentacle monsters were tempted by the livestock and ended up getting fished out and killed by Ziya.
<br><br>
He was quite a talented fisherman.
<br><br>
Even though they weren't mighty creatures, the tentacle monsters were smart enough to quickly catch on with what was going on. When they noticed their kind disappearing one after the other, they stopped taking the bait. However, Ziya had other tricks up his sleeve. He quickly replaced the old livestock lure with a more tempting and delicious one, which made it hard to resist not taking a bite. It quickly worked as the tentacle monsters began to munch on it and were later captured.
<br><br>
Watching the situation unfold, the last remaining tentacle monsters realized they were at a loss and began to retreat from the grassland.
<br><br>
Once they left, the obstacles in the way of Geoffrey's search were cleared up, and he was able to explore a wider area without having to worry about potential threats. It later amounted to him locating the window that led to another world.
<br><br>
Upon arriving at that window, Geoffrey pulled Ziya to his side to keep him protected and pushed him in before closely following after.
<br><br>
Buzz! Soon, the tiny specks of light with a dazzling gleam gathered in one place and transformed into the flesh bodies of Ziya and Geoffrey.
<br><br>
While viewing it from the outside, the window appeared to be averagesized. It wasn't too large, and not too small. However, upon entering, it soon became clear to them that it was much bigger than what they had initially thought. In fact, it was the entrance to a spacious cave.
<br><br>
Inside the cave, the atmosphere was a pale misty yellow. It seemed to be some toxic mist.
<br><br>
Ziya took caution to their surroundings and created a protective space around Geoffrey to keep him from the poisonous mist with a swift wave of his hand.
<br><br>
Buzz! After exercising the Space Godly Way successfully, Ziya was lost in his thoughts for a moment before he muttered to himself, "It seems the basic Godly Ways also work here…"
<br><br>
The three thousand Godly Ways were derived from the Ways-blending Energy, which was also the foundation of the chaos.
<br><br>
If there was no trace of Ways-blending Energy in this world, the three thousand Godly Ways would refuse to exist. As a result, Ziya would be rendered powerless as he would fail to display the power of any Godly Way.
<br><br>
"Alright then, let's head inside and take a closer look!"
<br><br>
The deeper they went into the cave, the more excited Ziya got to explore what lay inside of it. Giving in to his enthusiastic self, Ziya grabbed ahold of Geoffrey's arm and dragged him along to move faster. The next moment, the two of them morphed into individual beams of light that rushed their way into the depths of the cave.
<br><br>
Initially, Ziya had imagined the cave to be similar to any average cave he had come across. He thought if they rushed through, it wouldn't take long before they would reach the other side. But after hundreds of miles of travel, the space ahead would refuse to meet any end and would just appear to get wider and wider. Moreover, the yellow poisonous mist didn't seem to subside even after coming this far.
<br><br>
"This world appears to be quite peculiar. Geoffrey, stand firm and maintain a good grip!"
<br><br>
Just as he exclaimed his instructions, Ziya employed the Grand Teleportation technique and disappeared from the spot he once stood along with Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Buzz! Using this ability, Ziya was able to cover a great distance of more than ten million miles each time without a hitch.
<br><br>
Soon after, Ziya and Geoffrey found themselves in another space. This one was much wider than the last, and they weren't even able to locate the surrounding edges due to how spacious it was. In terms of appearance, it resembled the chaos with only one visible exception; the air wasn't decorated with chaotic clouds scattered about, but it had the yellow poisonous mist they had encountered earlier.
<br><br>
"This place holds a striking resemblance to the chaos, doesn't it?" Geoffrey asked as he looked around to soak in his surroundings.
<br><br>
He had never seen the chaos with his own eyes before. The only source of information he had was through various descriptions he had heard in the past regarding it.
<br><br>
"No, not really," Ziya shook his head to disregard Geoffrey's statement and continued, "It's just a larger cave than the one we were previously in. This world is quite strange. It seems to be made up of countless gigantic caves that cease to end. It could be said that this is a world of caves..."
<br><br>
As he spoke, Ziya gripped Geoffrey's hand firmly once more and used the Grand Teleportation technique over and over again.
<br><br>
Just like the previous times, they teleported to another vast cave, and just like the others, it was desolate with no signs of life anywhere. Except for the constant yellow poisonous mist that followed them everywhere, they never found anything else that appealed to their interests.
<br><br>
After more than a hundred successive implementations of the Grand Teleportation technique, they entered the vicinity of a new cave.
<br><br>
However, this time, they finally found something worth a second glance. At the bottom of this cave, there was a layer of huge pits like volcano craters closely packed against each other.
<br><br>
"Wow! There are so many volcanoes down there…" Geoffrey exclaimed in a high-pitched tone out of overflowing excitement. His eyes gleamed with joy.
<br><br>
"They aren't volcanoes," Ziya rubbed his chin as he squinted his eyes to look into the distance. "It seems they are lairs of some creatures that live down there."
<br><br>
Ziya had dragged Geoffrey along a great distance. Geoffrey was only able to comprehend the many caves flashing by his eyes when they teleported, but all this while Ziya had spread his spiritual sense in his surroundings to keep a lookout at all times.
<br><br>
With his observational skills, he had already found some clues and began to conceptualize a theory about this world.
<br><br>
In the depths of these huge caves, there were subtle traces of living beings, and even ruins of some simple buildings that had been buried deep underground for a very long time.
<br><br>
Even the sturdiest of buildings couldn't bear through the erosion of time and collapsed under pressure. After the passing of one or ten billion years, everything would eventually be reduced to nothing but soil.
<br><br>
However, this place was quite different. Ziya had sensed life force coming from those volcano craters. He instantly pinned them to be living creatures.
<br><br>
As soon as the two of them made their way to the ground, they noticed a fountain of yellow poisonous mist spurt out uncontrollably from a volcano crater within close proximity. As if on cue, brownish-yellow four-legged snakes slithered their way out of the mist and dashed towards them intending to kill.
<br><br>
These four-legged snakes appeared to be quite hostile with a malicious aura surrounding them. Their backs were covered in dense yellow poison sacs.
<br><br>
Their fearful appearance made Geoffrey feel intimidated by them as he subconsciously froze in place.
<br><br>
With a click of his tongue, Ziya expressed his disappointment as he shook his head and said, "Don't be scared. They're low-level creatures who lack intelligence."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he stretched out a hand and pressed it in the air. Long swords appeared out of nowhere and nailed these four-legged snakes down to the ground, killing them instantly.
<br><br>
"I can't believe there's no intelligent creatures in this world. We need to keep looking for them!"
<br><br>
Ziya fell in utter dismay as to what might have happened to this world.
<br><br>
However, if there existed any Other Shore Realm or Eternal Realm masters, they might have left some traces in this world to vouch for their existence.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Ziya used the Grand Teleportation technique over and over again.
<br><br>
After countless attempts, Geoffrey suddenly reminded him, "Master Ziya, if the Finale Way also existed in this world and it already failed, then no intelligent creatures would exist after that. Am I right?"
<br><br>
Hearing Geoffrey's words, Ziya stopped during the course of his action of using the Grand Teleportation technique and was stunned into silence.
<br><br>
When every round of chaos came to an end, everything in the world would be eliminated, leaving no traces of lives whatsoever.
<br><br>
Could it be that this world had been completely destroyed after the Finale Way failed? Chapter 3843 Investigation Geoffrey's words put into the light the current situation of this world to Ziya.
<br><br>
When a round of chaos ended, a destructive power would eliminate everything in the entire world.
<br><br>
After that, if no new intelligent lives managed to be birthed, then the world would exist as nothing more than a shell.
<br><br>
Ziya nodded. "You're right. Maybe the Purge Way and the Nihility Way also existed in this world and the ones who believed in the latter dominated everyone and destroyed everything. Or maybe the Purge Way won. They limited the number of creatures in a very small range and hid themselves somewhere in these caves."
<br><br>
This world was infinitely vast and trying to locate that small number of creatures was even more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack.
<br><br>
Either way, they knew the Finale Way in this world had failed.
<br><br>
"Is there also an Other Shore in this world?" Geoffrey asked. Ziya couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at Geoffrey's question.
<br><br>
"It's possible. Why not come with me to see if there is one!"
<br><br>
Since the three thousand Godly Ways worked in this world then the Truths of Godly Ways must be the same since they were derived from the Instant Civilization, a far more superior civilization from the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
They should be more universal than the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Geoffrey had completely mastered the Truth of Cultivation Nature under the Regal Jade Spirit's guidance, however, Zen never allowed him to leave his inner world. He still hadn't even gotten the chance to enter the Sea of Truth, yet here was Ziya inviting him to explore the Other Shore of this strange world.
<br><br>
Buzz! In a flash, Ziya sat cross-legged in the air and clapped four consecutive times in all directions. Four palm shadows appeared around him that held faint sword shadows. These sword shadows slowly rotated around him and Geoffrey protectively.
<br><br>
This world seemed devoid of all lives but it was never unwise to carry a bit of protection.
<br><br>
The two of them then began to recite the Truths of Godly Ways and tried to enter the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Slowly, the yellow, poisonous mist around the area headed towards them.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the two of them were surrounded by it.
<br><br>
A trace of curiosity appeared on Ziya's face. "Can the Truths of Godly Ways attract the poisonous mist?"
<br><br>
Back when they cultivated the Truths of Godly Ways in the chaos, they never attracted chaotic energy like this. Then again, this world was vastly different from the chaos.
<br><br>
As the two of them continued to recite, the whole world began to spin around them.
<br><br>
Newcomers to the Other Shore of the chaos would first arrive in the Sea of Truth but subsequent visits would lead them to the exact spot of their last exit.
<br><br>
Since this was the first time Ziya and Geoffrey entered the Other Shore of this world, they couldn't help but wonder if there was also a Sea of Truth here.
<br><br>
As the sky and earth spun, they felt as if their minds were bombarded by relentless thunder. Just as it was about to become unbearable, they found themselves in a yellow world with nothing but clouds and mist.
<br><br>
Geoffrey swept his gaze around their surroundings. "Have we entered the Other Shore of this world?"
<br><br>
As he looked around, he found a small armada of creatures about to approach.
<br><br>
Scorpions with six pairs of compound eyes, snakes whose bodies were covered with thorns, jumbo-sized mosquitoes of varied colors — all sorts of poisonous creatures were now crawling their way towards them.
<br><br>
Ziya frowned at the sudden appearance of these curious life-forms. "Are they Other Shore creatures?" he muttered to himself. Their arrival had been smooth and even if there were a lot of critters headed for them, they didn't seem to be that intelligent nor threatening.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, the poisonous creatures were quick to make their aggression known.
<br><br>
Having discovered these two newcomers, they hissed angrily and came upon them in a mad rush.
<br><br>
Ziya didn't even lift a finger but he somehow managed to eliminate all the oncoming creatures within a hundred feet radius through a series of lightning bolts that struck the ground.
<br><br>
Since there were too many creatures, their corpses soon piled up around them.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Ziya quickly grabbed Geoffrey's hand and flew onto the poisonous mist and left the pile of corpses behind.
<br><br>
"There doesn't seem to be a Sea of Truth here," Geoffrey muttered in observation.
<br><br>
"The layout of the Other Shore is arranged through the will of the Instant Civilization. Even if there is no Sea of Truth, there is still this endless poisonous fog," Ziya told him.
<br><br>
Fortunately, this poisonous fog was a piece of cake for Ziya and he could also protect Geoffrey from it. However, the natives of this world would've no doubt suffered from this deadly fog as they entered the Other Shore.
<br><br>
This yellowish fog of death seemed boundless and filled every inch of the air.
<br><br>
The two of them continued to travel through the mist for quite a long time.
<br><br>
Ziya, with his abilities, could afford to travel like that for months, even years, yet experience no sort of fatigue. Geoffrey, however, soon grew stiff and tired from the long and boring trip.
<br><br>
It was only twenty hours later that they finally reached the end.
<br><br>
What awaited them was a vast void of brownish-yellow energy currents.
<br><br>
When they looked down, they noticed that the edge of the earth was sharp and indented, like broken porcelain.
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't help but gasp in astonishment. "The earth is shattered, Master Ziya!"
<br><br>
Ziya nodded solemnly. "I'm afraid the whole Other Shore of this world has been destroyed. Shattered into pieces with nothing left but this void."
<br><br>
It was worse than what he had first expected. The Other Shore of this world should've survived the end of the world since it was supposed to be a permanent shelter for the inhabitants.
<br><br>
However, it didn't seem to be that way. The Other Shore of this world wasn't able to escape its doom.
<br><br>
"Master Ziya," Geoffrey called out to him as he pointed towards something in the distance. "Look over there."
<br><br>
Among the scattered energy currents was a floating remnant of the destroyed earth. It wasn't big but they could see a silhouette of low buildings on it.
<br><br>
Ziya immediately grabbed Geoffrey's hand.
<br><br>
"Come with me!" he exclaimed as they flew towards the remnant.
<br><br>
A look of hesitation crossed Geoffrey's features. "Aren't you afraid of the energy currents, Master Ziya?" he asked.
<br><br>
Geoffrey felt an instinctive fear for the formidable power contained within the currents that filled the void. So long as he brushed against the tiniest amount of energy, he would completely corrode into nothingness.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter. I can withstand them!" he assured the young man.
<br><br>
Ziya, after all, was an Eternal Realm master with the root-level bloodline.
<br><br>
He also stayed in the Deleting Space for a long time which led to the exponential growth of his power. He ranked at the very top when it came to strength. These currents would not harm him one bit.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As they flew into the void, they got closer and closer towards the floating remnant the size of a small island.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the two of them arrived.
<br><br>
The sight that awaited them caught Geoffrey by surprise. "There are so many houses here!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
The buildings were small and low, only around the height of Geoffrey's waist. These tiny buildings densely covered the island to the point that the two newcomers couldn't figure out where to set their feet on.
<br><br>
"Show yourselves!" Ziya suddenly shouted.
<br><br>
He was no fool.
<br><br>
The moment they landed, he was able to sense the existence of numerous Other Shore creatures that hid underneath these buildings.
<br><br>
Their arrival had scared these creatures which led them to hide in the caves that were underneath each structure.
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't help but sigh helplessly. "Master Ziya, you shouldn't scare them..."
<br><br>
They were strangers and Ziya's attitude wasn't helping them gain these creatures' trust.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, we don't mean you any harm. We just want to investigate something and hope to communicate with you," Geoffrey explained in a calm, sincere tone.
<br><br>
Perhaps his friendliness worked as a rustling sound came from one of the buildings. Soon enough, a short, furry creature emerged. He looked quite strange especially with that transparent poison sac filled with bright yellow venom on top of his head.
<br><br>
It seemed that all the creatures in this world, whether intelligent or not, were related to poison in some way.
<br><br>
Chapter 3844 The Four Spirits Sect The short creature walked towards Ziya in wobbly little steps. His fearful, vigilant gaze never strayed from the two of them.
<br><br>
They could also sense many similar gazes falling on them from those buildings. Apparently, many similar creatures were watching them from the dark. But there was nothing strange about this. After all, they were strangers here and aliens to them.
<br><br>
The short creatures could feel that Ziya was powerful. Their guts even told them that he could exterminate all the creatures on the island with just one finger if he desired it.
<br><br>
"Gulu... Master... Welcome...What...What can I do for you?"
<br><br>
This race had its own language, but when this short creature realized that neither Ziya nor Geoffrey could understand their language, he started to speak in human language.
<br><br>
A trace of surprise appeared on Ziya's eyes.
<br><br>
He'd long known that the human language commonly used on the Other Shore wasn't created by the 77th civilization. Nevertheless, this place was another world, and it was still unknown whether or not there were humans in this world.
<br><br>
"Master, it's been ages since I last spoke in the common language. Please forgive me if you can't understand what I say..." said the short creature. He saw that Ziya was in a daze, so he thought that Ziya couldn't understand what he said.
<br><br>
"Where did you learn to speak the common language?" Ziya asked.
<br><br>
"The common language... is a very old language. Once upon a time, all creatures in the Dream World spoke in this language," the short creature said. A longing expression emerged on his face as he recalled that prosperous era. "Now, I'm the only one in the tribe who knows it."
<br><br>
The short creature's hair was sparse, and his skin was crumpled. He had lived on the Other Shore for a rather long time.
<br><br>
"The Dream World he referred to should be about the same as our Other Shore, right?" Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
"I think so." Ziya nodded and then asked, "What happened to the Dream World? Why did it become like this?"
<br><br>
Ziya's question made the originally gentle and cowardly short creature show an aggrieved, indignant expression on his face.
<br><br>
This short-statured creature was of the Dark Fiend race, a race that had once occupied a dominant position in the Dream World.
<br><br>
The Dream World was a very huge annular world with fifteen rings from the outside to the inside. The stronger a race was, the more qualified they were to enter the inner ring. The former headquarter of the Dark Fiend race was located in the fifth ring.
<br><br>
At that time, this short creature had just been born. His young self often imagined that like the other talented individuals of their race, he would fight for their race and bring the Dark Fiend race to a higher level of glory after he grew up.
<br><br>
But before he became stronger, a disaster already descended upon the Dream World.
<br><br>
A strange force that had lurked in the Dream World for many years suddenly started rounds of purging in the Dream World. Even the world of poisonous mist wasn't spared.
<br><br>
Consequently, the Dream World was destroyed, and almost all intelligent creatures in the Dream World were either killed or injured.
<br><br>
When the Dream World was destroyed, one of its fragments, within which some creatures happened to be trapped, was bounced out and became the island where they were now.
<br><br>
Along with the passage of time, the creatures also grew in number. Now, many years after the incident, the island already became densely populated.
<br><br>
Every place, every corner on the island was occupied. This was how these crowded buildings could come about.
<br><br>
"Did that strange force have a name?" Ziya asked again.
<br><br>
"Yes, they called themselves the Nihility!"
<br><br>
Even after so many years, the short creature still gnashed his teeth with hate every time he said the word "Nihility". After all, this race had destroyed their homeland and everything they had once had.
<br><br>
Ziya was also stunned to hear the name "Nihility".
<br><br>
Although Geoffrey had never been to the Other Shore, he had stayed together with the Regal Jade Spirit and Ziya, so he was quite knowledgeable. He asked, "The Nihility race also exists in this world?"
<br><br>
What appeared in Ziya's mind was the appearance of the Grandmaster of Heaven, the junior fellow disciple of his master.
<br><br>
The last time he returned, Ziya had a long chat with his master, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, so he had, of course, learned about the current situation of the human race.
<br><br>
It was quite a shock for him to learn that the amiable Grandmaster of Heaven had become the leader of the Nihility race.
<br><br>
Compared to other major races on the Other Shore, the Nihility race appeared relatively late. It was only the 748th civilization. Despite its late birth, this civilization could advance by leaps and bounds. This was something that the Primeval Lord of Heaven and others had never understood.
<br><br>
Now, the answer finally dawned on Ziya's mind.
<br><br>
As it turned out, the Nihility race didn't come from the chaos.
<br><br>
So there might still be another existence behind the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The short creature told Ziya everything he knew. However, he was a native creature of the Dream World; he only knew about the situation in the Dream World but didn't know much about what happened with the world of poisonous mist.
<br><br>
Because of the short creature's limited knowledge, he couldn't answer many of Ziya's questions.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, when Ziya finished questioning the creature, he turned around and pointed to the distance. "Do you want to go to the world over there?"
<br><br>
The short creature's eyes suddenly lit up. "Master, can you send us there?"
<br><br>
Creatures of both the Dream World and the world of poisonous mist relied on absorbing poisonous mist as their primary means of survival. This island was densely populated, and there was little poisonous mist on this island.
<br><br>
The island opposite them, however, was practically covered in dense poisonous mist clouds. For the Dark Fiend race, those poisonous mist clouds were like out-of-reach delicacies they could only see with longing.
<br><br>
Many of the younger members of the Dark Fiend race drooled over the poisonous mist clouds all day long.
<br><br>
"Yes," said Ziya.
<br><br>
The short creature immediately turned around and spoke to his clansmen in their own language.
<br><br>
The quiet island suddenly became even quieter.
<br><br>
After a few moments of silence, deafening screams exploded from all over the place, causing the buildings on the island to shake from the noise.
<br><br>
"There are many poisonous animals and plants in that world. Aren't you guys afraid?" Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
The short creature turned around and faced them once more, saying proudly, "Those poisonous animals and plants are just creatures without any intelligence—the growth of their strength will always be limited. Besides, our Dark Fiend race isn't a weak race."
<br><br>
Thus, Ziya started to shuttle back and forth between the two islands. The pure energy flow between the islands wasn't at all a trifle, so Ziya had to be extremely careful when he was escorting the Dark Fiend race to the other island.
<br><br>
It took Ziya two whole days to send all the members of the Dark Fiend race over.
<br><br>
At this moment, all members of the Dark Fiend race were going all-out in sucking the poisonous mist. Geoffrey could only shake his head to see their intoxicated looks.
<br><br>
Now that he had fulfilled his promise, Ziya said to Geoffrey, "Let's go.
<br><br>
There's nothing else here."
<br><br>
A world of deathly stillness indeed wasn't of much value—at least, not according to Ziya.
<br><br>
"Wait," the short creature called out. "There's one more thing that I think you should know."
<br><br>
"What's the matter?" Ziya asked.
<br><br>
"Before the Dream World was destroyed, the elders of our race secretly mentioned some things to us. I heard that the Dream World was built by the Four Spirits Sect, and the human spirit in the sect looked exactly like you,"
<br><br>
the short creature said.
<br><br>
"The Four Spirits Sect..."
<br><br>
Ziya and Geoffrey looked at each other. Shock once again swept over them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3845 No Passing Most of the creatures from the chaos believed that the Instant Civilization created the chaos upon their existence.
<br><br>
However, as it was always a mystery of the Instant Civilization's existence, it left few clues behind.
<br><br>
Even there was some, they had been completely concealed by the Element Spirit Civilization when they first appeared in the chaos.
<br><br>
Upon hearing about the so-called Four Spirits Sect, Ziya was surprised, "What's the story of the human spirit? Tell me. I want all the details."
<br><br>
Ziya's sudden intrigue startled the little creature. "I... I don't know much, but I can say that the strongest Celestial Warriors in the Dream World would be favored by the Four Spirits Sect because they were quite outstanding and more than qualified to merge with stronger bloodlines..."
<br><br>
"Stronger bloodlines..." Ziya murmured to himself as he thought for a moment. "Had the Celestial Warriors you mentioned entered the Eternal Scroll Painting too?"
<br><br>
As he heard this, Geoffrey already understood that the Celestial Warrior should be corresponding to no other than the Eternal Warrior at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
"Eternal Scroll Painting?" the creature said as he shook his head. "I'm not sure what that is, but in order to become a Celestial Warrior, one has to enter the Celestial Painting. Only the most powerful Celestial Warrior can meet those from the Four Spirits Sect through the Celestial Painting. If I'm not mistaken, the four spirits of the Four Spirits Sect are human spirit, monkey spirit, snake spirit and bird spirit."
<br><br>
To become a Celestial Warrior had always been the creature's dream, so he was very knowledgeable about these things from continuous research and dedication.
<br><br>
"Master Ziya, the Four Spirits Sect is likely to be the Instant Civilization, right?" Geoffrey asked from where he stood.
<br><br>
Ziya nodded in response. "Yes, but it seems that this world is a little different from our chaos. Why did the Four Spirits Sect choose to meet the creatures of this world but continuously hid themselves from the creatures of the chaos?"
<br><br>
Geoffrey was very intelligent. Even if he had never been to the Other Shore, he could understand things through mere explanation. "There are two possibilities. It can be that the passage from the Abstruse Energy World to the chaos was broken, so the people of the Four Spirits Sect couldn't come.
<br><br>
It could also be that the world of poisonous mist existed much earlier than the chaos, and later the people of the Four Spirits Sect died, disappeared, or left, so the people in the chaos had never met them!"
<br><br>
Ziya looked at Geoffrey and gave him a light smile of satisfaction.
<br><br>
Although Geoffrey had some flaws, he was smart and Ziya admired this.
<br><br>
From the time they met up until this very moment, Ziya treated Geoffrey as his own son.
<br><br>
"Do you know how many years this world of poisonous mist has lasted?"
<br><br>
Ziya asked the little creature again.
<br><br>
The creature shook his head, "I don't remember. I only know it has lasted for a long time..."
<br><br>
Considering how long ago it was born, it was impossible at this point to determine exactly how many years. He didn't keep a record, so he couldn't give them a good answer. However, Ziya expected this and did not hesitate to ask some more, "Was the Celestial Painting also destroyed?"
<br><br>
The creature shook his head once more.
<br><br>
Before the Dream World was destroyed, he did not have enough abilities to go to the second ring, so he had not seen the so-called Celestial Painting either.
<br><br>
Ziya stopped asking. Before leaving, he assisted the Dark Fiend race to get rid of all the poisonous animals within the radius of a hundred miles. If there was any trouble that awaited them in the future, the Dark Fiend race would have to solve it by themselves.
<br><br>
Ziya was unsure whether the Dark Fiend race, the last offspring of the world of poisonous mist, would flourish despite these.
<br><br>
Afterwards, Ziya continuously travelled around the Dream World with Geoffrey by his side. He wanted to discover the traces of the Celestial Painting, but no matter where he looked, he couldn't seem to find it.
<br><br>
As he searched, a few islands caught his eye. He soared down to check them out, only to find out that they were empty and did nothing for his harvest.
<br><br>
"Master Ziya, that creature from the Dark Fiend race mentioned that one can only see the people of the Four Spirits Sect through the Celestial Painting. Doesn't that mean the Celestial Painting is a passage? And if so, what about the Eternal Scroll Painting?" Geoffrey asked.
<br><br>
Ziya looked at Geoffrey and replied, "This speculation existed a long time ago. The Eternal Scroll Painting itself may be a passage to the Abstruse Energy World."
<br><br>
"Have you been to the end of this passage? Or has anyone in the chaos ever successfully travelled there?" Geoffrey asked again.
<br><br>
"The end? No. Is it possible?"
<br><br>
Ziya's eyes narrowed slightly. What he had previously obtained was only a bloodline from an inner circle. He hadn't stepped into the innermost circle.
<br><br>
However, he recalled that the center of the big vortex was still covered by a black mist! "It seems that people from the chaos can't do that," Geoffrey pointed out as he shrugged his shoulders.
<br><br>
Ziya smiled helplessly. He knew exactly what Geoffrey meant.
<br><br>
In order to meet the people of the Four Spirits Sect, one must enter the center to obtain qualification first. Regretfully, Ziya, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Eye Spirit hadn't entered the center, so they were not qualified enough.
<br><br>
After they had exited the world of poisonous mist, Geoffrey sent Ziya back to the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Although Ziya didn't ask Geoffrey to do anything, Geoffrey still set a goal for himself: to discover a window to another world.
<br><br>
He had a gut feeling that there were more than two such worlds that existed within the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
There existed a small and remote province in the western part of the Source World: the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
This place was very primitive and it was filled with numerous savage creatures. Normally, few intelligent creatures would find their way into this province.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Just then, a violent wind pressure descended from the sky and blew the dense forest into a messy, disheveled area.
<br><br>
One by one, the black-faced monkeys in the dense forest began squealing in fright. They mistook the pressure for a Wind Snake that regularly hunted them down.
<br><br>
As they panicked, seven huge black shadows suddenly appeared in the sky.
<br><br>
They were seven giant flying ships! The seven giant flying ships hovered at a very low height to avoid any attention. However, no matter their efforts, they failed to go unnoticed due to their large size and fast speed. They produced a strong wind pressure, as if they had plowed the ground where they passed.
<br><br>
"Master Pearce, would it be too cautious for us to make a detour?" one of the masters from the Oneness Mountain asked.
<br><br>
They would reach the Pear Hill soon if they headed west directly. As long as they entered the Pear Hill, they would be safe there.
<br><br>
In the Source World, it was known that if any super force attempted to hurt the Pear Hill, they had to be one hundred percent sure of the consequences.
<br><br>
However, Pearce decided to change their route and make a detour, which prolonged their journey to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"We have to be cautious," Pearce replied.
<br><br>
During these days, Pearce had always been tense and restless.
<br><br>
In fact, he had reacted very quickly. The moment the Eternal Scroll Painting closed, he summoned the masters of seven mountains to start the migration.
<br><br>
He also remembered to inform the Pear Hill and make a detour on the way...
<br><br>
For some unknown reasons, he couldn't help but still be worried. His nerves had reached almost their limit.
<br><br>
Whoosh! "Master Pearce, we have successfully arrived at the boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province," a member reported.
<br><br>
There were always unshakeable boundary walls in between provinces. In order to enter them, one had to use the Sanskrit word that matched the one on the boundary wall to open the passageway.
<br><br>
"Just pass it. Why are you even reporting this?" Pearce asked with a frown.
<br><br>
"The Sanskrit words can't match, so the passageway cannot be opened. We cannot pass through," the man responded hastily.
<br><br>
Chapter 3846 The Boundary Wall The report had all the Oneness Sky Palace warriors confused.
<br><br>
"Did you use the wrong Sanskrit word?" Auden asked.
<br><br>
The man shook his head and affirmatively said, "It's impossible. I've checked it carefully and confirmed that the Sanskrit word on the flying ship is correct."
<br><br>
"Could it be that someone made a mistake when recording the Sanskrit word before?" Pearce guessed.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
As the space fluctuated, Winchell's figure appeared before everyone's eyes.
<br><br>
His face seemed serious as he said, "It's impossible. Even if there is something wrong with the flying ship of the Oneness Mountain, there couldn't be something wrong with the ship of the Origin Mountain at the same time. And even if something is wrong with both mountains, what about the flying ship of the Golden Mountain?"
<br><br>
Both the Origin Mountain and the Golden Mountain had just made an attempt, but the two flying ships were blocked outside the boundary wall.
<br><br>
"Why is this happening?" A strong warrior from the Oneness Sky Palace asked.
<br><br>
"There's only one possibility," Winchell said, raising his dashing eyebrows.
<br><br>
"Someone modified the Sanskrit word on the boundary wall."
<br><br>
"How is that possible?"
<br><br>
"But that's the boundary wall..."
<br><br>
"I've never heard of anyone who can actually modify it!"
<br><br>
The wall served as the dividing line between the two provinces—a unique product of the Source World.
<br><br>
The ordinary mortals and even many of the True Gods didn't have the ability to cross through several provinces. But such a task was a piece of cake for the powerful warriors of various large races. A long time ago, they had already gathered all the Sanskrit words within all the boundary walls of the Source World.
<br><br>
To visit a particular province, one only needed to show the corresponding Sanskrit word.
<br><br>
"I'll go and have a look!"
<br><br>
As soon as Pearce finished speaking, his figure disappeared from where he stood. The next moment, he appeared before the boundary wall.
<br><br>
Stretching out his hand, he gently punched it, releasing a Sanskrit word corresponding to the one that had already appeared on the boundary wall.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The two words failed to react to each other, and no passageway appeared on the boundary wall.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Auden, Athemar, Goran, and the rest also moved over. But Pearce's failed attempt made all their faces fall grim.
<br><br>
They believed that something must be wrong, especially at this critical moment.
<br><br>
"Well, since we can't use the normal method to pass through the wall, let's break it," Winchell suggested.
<br><br>
While the Separate Amber Province was a small province, it was no easy task to break its boundary wall.
<br><br>
If one wanted to do so, they had to first reach the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
But while these warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace present hadn't yet reached that realm, they were at the Holy Soul Realm and had already fused with the Chaotic Source Spirits. With joint effort, they figured they could break the wall down.
<br><br>
In the Source World, destroying the boundary wall was considered taboo.
<br><br>
While these crystal-like boundary walls would still recover after decades, no one dared to break them unless it was absolutely necessary.
<br><br>
"Let's do it, then," Auden said decisively.
<br><br>
At this moment, he had nothing to worry about. The moment he finished speaking, the Other Shore Tokens in the bodies of Pearce, Goran, Athemar, and the rest began moving as their power accumulated.
<br><br>
Just as they were about to shatter the wall, the crystal surface suddenly flashed with a circle of light.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The next moment, the entire boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province turned pitch black.
<br><br>
An enormous figure was projected on the wall in front of Pearce.
<br><br>
It was a human teenager.
<br><br>
With raven hair and eyes, he was rather handsome.
<br><br>
But that didn't make him seem good-natured, as there was a sinister look in his eyes.
<br><br>
"You won't be able to break this wall," he said with an almost evil smile.
<br><br>
His figure was somewhat illusory, as though it was coming from the wall or the sky.
<br><br>
"Take action!" Pearce shouted out.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, including Auden, Athemar, and Goran, all made their move.
<br><br>
While they knew it was no simple task they were trying to do, all of them were highly determined people, capable of remaining composed at critical moments like this.
<br><br>
Regardless, they intended to break the boundary wall first.
<br><br>
"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom..."
<br><br>
Streaks of sword radiance hit the wall, making the surrounding space start fluctuating violently.
<br><br>
The raven-haired boy merely pointed in front of him, making a stable pattern appear both in front of him and in the inner layer of the boundary wall.
<br><br>
The pattern seemed to be a great spider web, and it could evenly distribute the power within a certain range onto the entire boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
In essence, it was also a means of energy transfer, and just so happened to be the boy's ability.
<br><br>
The joint attack of about seven powerful warriors from the Oneness Sky Palace was equal to the full attack of an Eternal Realm master—it was probably enough to blow out a great hole in the boundary wall.
<br><br>
But because of the spider web's existence, the boundary wall didn't budge an inch.
<br><br>
"How weak," said the boy with disdain. "It's impossible to even test my strength."
<br><br>
Once he finished speaking, he disappeared from the wall.
<br><br>
Immediately after, a thin crack appeared above the boundary wall, opening like two doors. From there, three giant flying ships slowly emerged.
<br><br>
On the first was engraved the words, 'Bearing race'. Atop the ship was a man dressed in luxury clothes. He was none other than Yellow Thearch, the leader of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
With Yellow Thearch as the center, a grand aura was released.
<br><br>
It was an extremely penetrating aura. Even as the seven giant flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace were guarded by many arrays, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were still suppressed by the aura.
<br><br>
"Whose aura is so powerful?"
<br><br>
"Did we get into trouble?"
<br><br>
"I knew this trip would not be that simple..."
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace disciples' faces darkened.
<br><br>
In the center of the Oneness Mountain's giant ship, three great red crystals were placed side by side. Inside them were the physical bodies of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and Zen.
<br><br>
This area was heavily guarded. Under the enchanted barrier's protection, not even a mosquito could get in and out.
<br><br>
After leaving the Soul City, Elvinia found that her mother had taken her on the flying ship. Knowing that both Zen and the Oneness Sky Palace were in great danger, she wasn't in the mood to receive any training in the Soul City, even though she wasn't far from reaching the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
"If only Zen could wake up in advance..."
<br><br>
Across the red crystal, Elvinia could see Zen's peaceful face—it was like he was merely asleep.
<br><br>
"Why don't you say if only your father could wake up?" Flamine said with a smile.
<br><br>
After a moment of thought, Elvinia bluntly said, "Even if Father wakes up, he might not be able to protect the Oneness Sky Palace, but Zen can."
<br><br>
As Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter, she had gone too far by saying such words. After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was taking charge of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
But what she said was true—with how the situation was turning out, the Oneness Sky Palace couldn't get out of trouble merely by relying on Yasamin and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Flamine could see right through her daughter, but she just smiled helplessly in return. Before she could respond, she and Elvinia both felt a vast, strong aura from outside the flying ship.
<br><br>
Concerned, Flamine stretched out her hand and hit the air. The scene outside the flying ship appeared on the surface of the crystal wall nearby.
<br><br>
The moment they saw the Bearing race's flying ship, their faces turned grim.
<br><br>
Chapter 3847 Cut The Ship Atop the enormous flying ships stood all the mighty Holy Soul Realm warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
They all felt desperate and miserable when they realized that Yellow Thearch had personally come.
<br><br>
Pearce, Auden, and the others, in particular, were immensely shocked and upset.
<br><br>
This time, three flying ships came over. The words "Bearing race" were engraved on the ship in the middle, the words "Divine Farmer race" were engraved on the ship at the left, and the words "New Moon race" were engraved on the ship at the right. It was likely that both Divine Farmer and Mahoney had come.
<br><br>
At that moment, Yellow Thearch looked down at the flying ships below. He shook his long sleeve and said, "Go ahead. I know you can't wait."
<br><br>
A thin figure popped out from behind him. He was the black-haired teenager, Usman.
<br><br>
A hint of madness flashed in his eyes. As soon as he jumped off, he rushed towards a gigantic flying ship like an arrow.
<br><br>
"I'm going to tear this ship apart!"
<br><br>
For some reason, he looked oddly excited, and his heart hammered in his chest.
<br><br>
Although he could previously kill people at will, those he had fought before were people the Ji Clan had selected. Once they fought to a certain extent, they were forced to fall asleep, and Usman felt that it wasn't exciting at all.
<br><br>
Now, he finally had the chance to kill on his own accord.
<br><br>
He flew directly towards the giant flying ship and sensed a large number of people's breaths in it. To tear the flying ship apart was naturally the most efficient way to kill them.
<br><br>
"How dare you!" Pearce screamed.
<br><br>
His face darkened, and he froze as if the frost had enveloped him.
<br><br>
Then, his right hand shook violently, and a handful of blood mist gushed out of his right arm. The blood mist condensed quickly and turned into a long sword.
<br><br>
"God-detaining Sword! Go to hell!"
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The sword moved so swiftly in zigzag motions, and then it slashed at Usman's front.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
There seemed to be only the giant flying ship in Usman's eyes. As Pearce went all-out with his sword attack, he did not dodge. Instead, he withstood the strike with his physical body.
<br><br>
The powerful sword radiance left a mark on Usman's body, but the mark only lasted for a few seconds before it disappeared.
<br><br>
"This young man isn't at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
But he can withstand my full blow! How is that possible?" said Pearce.
<br><br>
He couldn't believe his eyes! If Usman was at the Chaotic Source Realm, then it was understandable that he could block his sword strike, but he was not! The sword radiance clearly left a trace just now, but it disappeared quickly.
<br><br>
How could someone who wasn't at the Chaotic Source Realm withstand his blow? He suddenly felt that the world had gotten even more mysterious. Some young men who appeared out of nowhere looked quite exceptional, and their strengths were simply beyond his imagination. Zen and Usman who was in front of him, were included.
<br><br>
"Stop him!"
<br><br>
Just then, three evil eyes floated out of Auden's body and released countless sharp swords.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
The sharp swords stabbed Usman's body, but their effect was just the same as Pearce's attack. They left multiple scars on Usman, but they were small, shallow, and healed immediately.
<br><br>
"You can never pass through!"
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
At that point, Winchell, Athemar, Goran, and the others also joined the fight. All of them had attacked Usman with all their might, but the results were the same. They couldn't stop him at all.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Soon enough, Usman crashed hard against the side of the giant flying ship.
<br><br>
The whole giant flying ship shook violently, and the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace inside also tumbled due to the sudden movement.
<br><br>
The golden light around the flying ship exploded, and the arrays on its surface were damaged. At the same time, a large crack began to spread on the ship. Then, the ship tore with a loud cracking sound.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Light shone inside the ship through the cracks. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace inside the cabin blanched with fear. They all thought that they would be safe inside the flying ship, but they never expected for such a disaster to happen.
<br><br>
Beads of sweat rolled down their temples. They saw through the crack that there was a boy in his teens outside the ship.
<br><br>
Even though the boy was just a teen, no one dared to come forward! Just as everyone was about to retreat, a quick figure already dashed towards the crack.
<br><br>
It was Libby whose long legs tapped lightly on the ground, and she left a shadow every time she touched the floor.
<br><br>
When she was near Usman, she lifted the long sword and shook her right hand at the same time.
<br><br>
"Chill Rope!"
<br><br>
In a split second, a rope wrapped around Usman.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
After the rope had bound his body, it turned into a mark and appeared on his neck.
<br><br>
"Get out!" Libby shouted and swung her sword at him.
<br><br>
Her sword strike had the power of eighteen thousand divine megatons! Usman's excitement only increased as he stared at Libby's angry face. Then, he stretched out his hand and casually tried to grab Libby's sword.
<br><br>
Eighteen thousand divine megatons of power was indeed not enough to defeat him.
<br><br>
After Pearce and the other mighty warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace had attacked him, he was still unharmed.
<br><br>
However, he was slightly shocked when he touched Libby's sword.
<br><br>
It turned out that the sword's power had suddenly increased by three times and reached a total of fifty-four thousand divine megatons! His abilities allowed him to resist the power that was ten times stronger than fifty-four thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Yet, he knew nothing about the Chill Rope. While the rope secured him tightly, the power of all Libby's attacks was multiplied by three times. Of course, the sudden increase caught him off-guard.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The sword radiance hit Usman directly and pushed him out of the crack! "Libby is so remarkable!"
<br><br>
"She threw out that young man with a single sword strike! No wonder she's a Holy Soul Realm warrior!"
<br><br>
"In the Land of Sword Grief, Libby has always been..."
<br><br>
Naturally, many disciples were ecstatic as they watched and showered Libby with various praises.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Libby only frowned as she gripped her sword. She wasn't complacent at all. She attacked Usman with almost all her might, but why was he unharmed? Of course, she didn't see that Pearce and the others had already attacked Usman together before.
<br><br>
While everyone continued to praise her, two more loud sounds came from the ship.
<br><br>
"Bang, bang!"
<br><br>
The first sound came from the outer shell, and the second sound came from the deck under everyone's feet. The next moment, Usman appeared in the cabin.
<br><br>
He stroked his chin and gazed at Libby with a playful smile. Then he mused, "I won't kill you yet. I'll tear down this ship first and then play with you..."
<br><br>
"How dare you!"
<br><br>
Even in the face of an invincible opponent, Libby wasn't afraid at all. She had always focused on cultivating the sword skill as a diligent disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace. She had done her best to improve, and little by little became so powerful.
<br><br>
After that, a long sword followed behind Usman like a shadow.
<br><br>
"Clatter, clatter, clatter..."
<br><br>
Libby's sword radiance continuously struck Usman like flowing water.
<br><br>
In turn, Usman withstood all her attacks with his physical body and kept retreating at the same time.
<br><br>
As he retreated, however, he repeatedly flipped his hands and made all sorts of strange patterns. Every time he launched a palm strike, it left a weird print in the air.
<br><br>
He retreated from the left side of the cabin to the right side, and Libby slashed him about forty times.
<br><br>
She still used her full strength for each sword strike, but she couldn't hurt Usman.
<br><br>
"Have you finished attacking me? If you're done doing that, get out of the way. This route is very dangerous!" Usman warned.
<br><br>
He made a gesture and pointed towards the route where he had retreated.
<br><br>
Once he finished speaking, he twisted his hands and formed a pattern. Then, the prints he left along the way lit up, and a large blade appeared.
<br><br>
The blade the space had formed immediately spread out.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Everything happened so quickly. It was as if an invisible blade moved past and cut the flying ship in two with a crisp sound.
<br><br>
Chapter 3848 High In The Sky The invisible space blade, after cutting open the huge flying ship, continued to expand in all directions.
<br><br>
High up in the sky, a group of tiger-headed wild geese were flying in a herringbone formation. The one in the middle suddenly let out an almighty screech before splitting into two.
<br><br>
The other wild geese were confused as they roared and scattered in all directions.
<br><br>
A straight, neat crack had appeared on the ground beneath the flying ship, extending all the way from north to south till it had reached the boundary walls on both sides of the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
This space blade had cut through a great number of plants and creatures along the way.
<br><br>
The bottom of the flying ship was made of one whole floating stone, which was why it didn't fall even when it was cut into two.
<br><br>
However, the three red crystals stored in the flying ship were now exposed.
<br><br>
Elvinia, and Flamine were still beside the red crystals. Their faces darkened as they looked up at the flying ship. They had only heard a muffled sound before everything had changed.
<br><br>
The dazzling light from the red crystals in the sun attracted Usman's attention. He stared at the corporeal bodies in the red crystals, a contemptuous smile on his face.
<br><br>
This had been too easy.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace didn't even have a member at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
All of their members were good for nothing. How could it be called a super force? With such thoughts in his mind, he turned and shot an arm out at the red crystals.
<br><br>
"Mom," Elvinia called worriedly.
<br><br>
"Step back. I won't let him pass," ordered Flamine.
<br><br>
Traces of the divine fire of the Sun Crow race spread along her skin. She was about to take a fighting stance.
<br><br>
"But can you stop him by yourself?" Elvinia didn't think Flamine could stop the black haired young man.
<br><br>
"She is not alone!"
<br><br>
Dozens of figures began to float towards them from the end of the cabin.
<br><br>
The voice belonged to Elizabeth, who was leading these members of the Sun Crow race. Their wings looked like flags rising up into the air.
<br><br>
The members of the Holy Soul Realm of the Sun Crow race went along when the Oneness Sky Palace had begun to migrate.
<br><br>
But the Sun Crow race preferred to stay out of the limelight. They seldom went out in public even when they had been in the Oneness Mountain. They were now at the bottom of the cabin ever since they had moved with the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
But now that the flying ship had cracked, the members of the Sun Crow race were out in the open. .
<br><br>
Micah and Bagot rushed forward to Usman.
<br><br>
They had once been assistants to Emperor Charm, the way Pearce and Auden were assistants to Eastern Emperor Taiyi in the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
They struck their palms out as they approached Usman and under the combined force, Usman was blasted backwards.
<br><br>
Half the flying ship that was floating in the air because of the loss of driving force, began to slowly rotate in the air because of the inverse impact of the two palms.
<br><br>
"Move the crystals away as soon as possible!" Micah shouted.
<br><br>
The members of the Sun Crow race weren't worried about Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, but they had to protect Zen.
<br><br>
Flamine didn't hesitate as she carried the red crystal that contained Eastern Emperor Taiyi on her shoulder.
<br><br>
Elizabeth flapped her wings and raised the crystal that contained Zen, while Bagot gently raised the red crystal that contained Yasamin.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Their carrying the crystals meant that they were about to open the space channels and escape.
<br><br>
But Usman's voice stopped them in their tracks. "You can't leave."
<br><br>
A long, transparent saber appeared in his hand and he twirled it around, as if showing off his moves.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, three shots sounded from beside Elizabeth, Flamine, and Bagot.
<br><br>
The space channels that the three of them had built, collapsed in an instant.
<br><br>
The dust had barely settled when Usman attacked them, violently slashing the saber in his hand at them.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Two more visible space fluctuations spread towards Elvinia and the group.
<br><br>
Just like the invisible space blade that had appeared earlier, these space fluctuations continued to expand forward, cutting through everything along the way.
<br><br>
"Dodge!"
<br><br>
Flamine, Elvinia, and all the members of the Sun Crow race dispersed.
<br><br>
Another resounding crack sounded, and the half of the flying ship further split into two pieces.
<br><br>
"It's no fun, letting you go so easily!"
<br><br>
Usman said, his growing excitement palpable. He flew up into the air and waved the transparent saber even more zealously.
<br><br>
An invisible blade spread out every time he waved his saber, and advanced all the way to the end of the province.
<br><br>
If one looked down from the sky, one could see long thin lines appearing on the ground. Anything that blocked the thin lines was ruthlessly sliced into pieces.
<br><br>
The power of the invisible blade was terrifying but it wasn't very fast.
<br><br>
Flamine and the members of the Sun Crow race were able to easily dodge them.
<br><br>
However, it was difficult for the giant flying ships of the other six mountains to avoid these messy blades. They couldn't escape the invisible blades. Many disciples in the ships had already encountered these blades and received a brutal cutting through.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm from the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race swarmed out of their flying ships to attack the Oneness Sky Palace warriors who had left the flying ships.
<br><br>
In under five minutes, the scene had turned chaotic, the smell of blood spreading in all directions.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch stood atop the Bearing race's flying ship, looking up at the sky. His body was like a statue made of molten iron. He wasn't looking at what was going on below him. It was like he thought it had nothing to do with him.
<br><br>
He didn't do anything, even though it was now extremely easy for him to capture Zen who was sealed within the red crystal.
<br><br>
In the sky, at a height of about three million feet, several small black dots floated in the air.
<br><br>
If one were to move closer, they would find that these black dots were actually black ships.
<br><br>
When the Yellow Thearch had received the order of the Element Spirit race, he had known that this trip wouldn't be easy.
<br><br>
The dilapidated Oneness Sky Palace was not within the scope of his plan, and there had been no need for the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race to dispatch all their powerful warriors to deal with it. But he knew that he had to face a more troublesome opponent.
<br><br>
Twelve people stood on the black ships in the sky.
<br><br>
There usually were exactly thirteen people in the Black Ship. But today, the last position was reserved for the Evil God. Now that he had been rebuilt and kept on the Other Shore, he wouldn't be able to get out before he descended. Therefore, the thirteenth position was vacant.
<br><br>
"I think the guy down there is Usman," Tomos, the Ear Mouse, remarked sharply.
<br><br>
"He has come back to life too soon! I really want to go down and crush him into pieces. Captain, when can we take action?" The brass man had never liked Usman.
<br><br>
The captain's voice sounded from deep within his black cloak, "No hurry.
<br><br>
Everyone hasn't arrived yet. It's too disadvantageous for us to fight now."
<br><br>
"How long do we have to wait?" the brass man asked again.
<br><br>
"Until Fuxi can't restrain himself any longer," the captain replied.
<br><br>
Chapter 3849 Fists Although the members of the Oneness Sky Palace were transported efficiently and swiftly, it was still a mammoth project.
<br><br>
In fact, when the seven huge flying ships flew west, there were informants constantly cascading the information to the Black Ship and the Bearing race.
<br><br>
The Bearing race and the Black Ship had received instructions from the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race respectively. Their goal was clear, and they intended to gain control over Zen at any cost.
<br><br>
At the same time, in the Grand Plain Stage, Pearce also appealed to the Pear Hill for help.
<br><br>
In fact, as the Oneness Sky Palace members arrived at the Prime North Province, the three forces, including the Pear Hill, the Bearing race, and the Black Ship, had all appeared, and they were intrigued by the discovery of each other's existence.
<br><br>
However, for the time being, the Pear Hill was not in a hurry, while Yellow Thearch and the captain of the Black Ship were both growing anxious.
<br><br>
Of course, they didn't intend for the flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace to enter the safety of the Pear Hill's territory. However, Yellow Thearch and the captain were both shrewd warriors, and neither of them were willing to make the initial move.
<br><br>
Everyone wanted to win out and reach the top, but they didn't want to take any action to do so.
<br><br>
The captain was a man of calm demeanor. He trailed behind the flying ships, slowly following through the skies with the fleet of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
However, the members of the Bearing race were the first to no longer be able to contain their anxiety.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch didn't want to make the first move, so he released Usman to intercept them in the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
As for Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and Mahoney, they were on standby in their flying ships.
<br><br>
If Usman kept launching successful attacks and killing many warriors like this, it would be the turn of the Pear Hill to get anxiety.
<br><br>
Therefore, the captain was fairly confident that Fuxi would take action before him.
<br><br>
"Shera, what is on your mind?" asked the captain.
<br><br>
Shera was sitting by the railing of the ship, and her pair of smooth, white and long legs were hanging in the air. The black hemline of her dress fluttered in the breeze, and there was a tired look in her eyes.
<br><br>
She kept a watchful eye on Usman, noting the blades moving from all directions and forming disorderly lines.
<br><br>
"Are you still infatuated with Usman?" the "bamboo pole" wrapped with bandage asked. Everyone was aware at that time that Shera had a crush on Usman.
<br><br>
Shera shrugged and said indifferently, "This Usman is merely an incarnation of resentment. He is someone else."
<br><br>
"I don't believe that," the captain said, shaking his head. "In fact, he is still the same Usman, but he just lacks all memories of his past."
<br><br>
Shera glanced at the captain.
<br><br>
Since the captain had raised this matter on purpose, he clearly wanted to make a point and say something more.
<br><br>
He added unhurriedly, "As the incarnation of resentment, Usman is bound to be out of control. In fact, what Yellow Thearch has done is merely a repetition of what we have done in the past."
<br><br>
"Sooner or later, they will face a counterattack from Usman," Shera said indifferently.
<br><br>
"Maybe they will not suffer a counterattack," the captain countered, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Why?" Shera asked in a confused tone.
<br><br>
"The Grandmaster of Heaven has instructed us that the goal for now is not only to capture Zen, but also to devour Usman," the captain replied.
<br><br>
"Devour Usman? Who will be responsible for that?"
<br><br>
Hearing this news, the members of the Black Ship were confused.
<br><br>
"That Evil God," the captain explained indifferently.
<br><br>
"The Evil God? Isn't that warrior still on the Other Shore?" the brass man asked in a hollow and metallic voice.
<br><br>
"We can help him descend," said the captain.
<br><br>
"Bring that brat back here? Isn't it too..."
<br><br>
To force something or someone to descend from the Other Shore would require the consumption of a golden red Chaotic Source Spirit. Every golden red Chaotic Source Spirit was priceless and far too precious to waste.
<br><br>
Since so many powerful members of the Nihility race needed to descend, the chance of the Evil God coming down was slim. After all, he hadn't even stepped into the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"If he can really merge with Usman, it is a sacrifice worth making," the captain said calmly.
<br><br>
"But by nature, he is no different from Usman. He is only useful while he is weak. Once he gains strength, I'm afraid we won't be able to control him at all," Shera said, her eyes gleaming with concern.
<br><br>
The captain shrugged his shoulders and said, "Who knows what the Grandmaster of Heaven is planning? We must do as he said..." At this point, the captain seemed to notice something and added with a smile, "Fuxi can't stand it anymore."
<br><br>
The destructive power of Usman was too potent.
<br><br>
The thin cracks had been formed by the invisible blade along the ground, and these were spreading out, almost slicing the entire Separate Amber Province into countless puzzle pieces.
<br><br>
The Holy Soul Realm warriors and even the Chaotic Source Realm warriors were strong enough to dodge.
<br><br>
But given the situation, the seven ships of the Oneness Sky Palace were loaded with many disciples. Scores of them were sliced into two pieces without even knowing what had happened.
<br><br>
Although most of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had scattered in all directions, the invisible blade pierced through the entire Separate Amber Province, and in the end, they could not avoid it. If they were not watchful and alert, they would lose their arms and legs, or even be severed in half.
<br><br>
As a member of the human race, Fuxi couldn't tolerate this continued slaughter.
<br><br>
While Usman was engaged in the wanton slaughter of the people, a huge mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on the boundary wall, and on the chest of Usman, another mark of Eight Diagrams materialized.
<br><br>
When Usman saw the mark of Eight Diagrams on his chest, he was briefly stunned.
<br><br>
Then he felt a terrifying wave rolling up from behind him, and a large hole instantly appeared in the solid boundary wall.
<br><br>
The terrifying wave did not stop after it pierced through the boundary wall.
<br><br>
Instead, it directly slammed into his chest.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
It was a power that Usman had previously not experienced.
<br><br>
He felt his chest explode from the impact, and the irresistible force slammed him to the ground with a tremendous force.
<br><br>
The wave of impact collapsed the ground, and the power that slammed him down even left a huge crater in the ground.
<br><br>
Even though the crater was already thousands of feet deep, the remaining power still continued to press him down. The black soil buried him past his head, and he didn't know how deep he had sunk.
<br><br>
However, before the power could dissipate, another massive force lifted him up.
<br><br>
When Usman was raised out of the thick soil, he saw a man with black hair standing in front of him. This man's unique temperament and aura left Usman feeling a little uneasy.
<br><br>
From the moment of his birth, Usman had never feared anyone. It could even be said that he had no knowledge of what fear was.
<br><br>
Even in the face of Yellow Thearch, he remained unafraid.
<br><br>
However, this black haired man before him filled him with trepidation.
<br><br>
"Did you think no one can defeat you?" Fuxi glared balefully at Usman.
<br><br>
"Just you..."
<br><br>
However, as Usman was about to speak, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on his face.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Even an Eternal Realm warrior would have faced death if this punch had landed on their face.
<br><br>
However, since Usman was formed by the resentment of the Source World, he had been integrated into the world.
<br><br>
Although he was still quite weak, he could easily control a province! The power of the blow had completely been transferred to the boundary wall by him...
<br><br>
"Boom!" "Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack..."
<br><br>
In the distance, another large hole appeared in the boundary wall, accompanied by a web of cracks. This was the damage inflicted by Fuxi's punch.
<br><br>
"Can you keep transferring the power infinitely?" Fuxi asked.
<br><br>
"Humph!" Usman snorted in derision.
<br><br>
"When I completely smash the boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province, I'll see if you can still grin and hold on then," Fuxi threatened, clenching his fists again.
<br><br>
At the same time, many Eight Diagrams patterns appeared all over Usman's body, covering his face, chest, legs, abdomen...
<br><br>
"What are you planning to do?" There was a hint of fear glimmering in Usman's eyes.
<br><br>
"Beat you!"
<br><br>
As soon as Fuxi had spoken, his fists began swinging towards Usman, instantly creating countless fist shadows, all of which landed on Usman's body.
<br><br>
Chapter 3850 Challenge Usman hadn't fully grown up yet, so he was still much weaker than his previous self in the past.
<br><br>
Moreover, no one could tell how powerful a fully grown Usman would be.
<br><br>
The leaders of the super forces concluded that he could control the entire Source World in the future. He had so much potential that once he had fully grown up, no one would be on a par with him.
<br><br>
However, Usman's betrayal of the Black Ship gave them a severe headache back then. On the contrary, the other super forces were pleased since the Black Ship was notorious all over the Source World.
<br><br>
Still, Usman's unrestrained growth worried them. Therefore, they finally helped the Black Ship kill Usman.
<br><br>
The only thing was, Usman was already very strong even though he hadn't fully grown up yet.
<br><br>
Of course, Fuxi was much more powerful. He marked his opponent with the Eight Diagrams and left no space for him to dodge his punches.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Thus, Usman got reduced to an immovable live target.
<br><br>
Now that he couldn't wield his invisible blade and kill, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace finally had a chance to breathe.
<br><br>
Some of the disciples floated in the air, while the others stayed on the ground as they all watched Fuxi beat Usman with the countless fist shadows he created. Adrenaline rushed through their veins at the thrilling sight.
<br><br>
They knew that Fuxi's ferocious attacks could crush even an Eternal Realm master into muddy flesh.
<br><br>
Yet, Usman remained unharmed. How was that possible? The young disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace didn't understand it, but the powerful masters figured out why.
<br><br>
As soon as Usman had arrived in the Separate Amber Province, his real presence fused with the whole land. Thus, all the damage he suffered went to the ground.
<br><br>
For instance, every punch Fuxi threw at him created a large hole on the once indestructible boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
That boundary wall surrounded the entire province. Although it was sturdy and extensive, it would collapse anytime soon because of the large holes that continually appeared on it.
<br><br>
Yet, Usman still couldn't transfer the damage he bore at his own will. After all, he was only an incarnation of resentment in the Source World. Once the boundary wall completely collapsed, he would undoubtedly die.
<br><br>
That was how the last Usman died in the past.
<br><br>
Back then, it was a large province twelve times bigger than the current province, but a powerful Other Shore Token had trapped the last Usman in the center of the province. With no way to escape, he had suffered from the attacks of several Eternal Realm masters. In the end, they smashed the last Usman to death after the boundary wall of the entire province was completely destroyed.
<br><br>
Now, Fuxi tried to kill him with the same method.
<br><br>
Since Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and Mahoney refused to show up, he would beat Usman to death first.
<br><br>
Unlike the other great masters who preferred to scheme and calculate a lot before they made their move, Fuxi chose to deal with things simply and directly — that was, to fight with his fists.
<br><br>
And because of his involvement in the war, all the others stopped their battles.
<br><br>
When Pearce, Auden, and the others saw Fuxi had come to their rescue, all of them lit up with hope.
<br><br>
Because Zen couldn't wake up and help them under the current circumstances, the Oneness Sky Palace's only back-up was probably Pear Hill. Although their seven flying ships were all destroyed and many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had died, Fuxi's appearance was timely for them.
<br><br>
The Holy Soul Realm warriors of the Bearing race looked up at the sky above the boundary wall. They knew that none of them was a match for Fuxi, but they wanted to know their leader's next plan.
<br><br>
However, Yellow Thearch only stood at the top of their flying ship and remained silent.
<br><br>
The sounds of the collapsing boundary wall lingered in his ears, like Usman's pathetic cries for mercy. They reminded him of the ruthless beating Usman endured.
<br><br>
"He will soon be killed," Divine Farmer's voice resounded in Yellow Thearch's ears. He knew he couldn't just stand by now.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch squinted his eyes and eventually opened his mouth to plead Fuxi, "Human Sovereign, this person is a member of my clan. Please show mercy on him."
<br><br>
Swoosh! Fuxi's punch stopped halfway, but its power still exploded and cast the Eight Diagrams' mark on Usman's body.
<br><br>
Bang! Usman still didn't suffer any damage from the attack, but another large hole appeared on the boundary wall.
<br><br>
Several holes connected, then a large part of the boundary wall collapsed to the ground.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked up at the sky and sneered, "Since the member of your clan dared to kill the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace at will, why should I show any mercy?"
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace has offended the Bearing race. As the leader of the race, it's reasonable for me to punish them. On the other hand, I don't think it's justifiable for you to intervene. Human Sovereign, don't you think so?" Yellow Thearch replied in a calm voice.
<br><br>
Although the situation in the Source World had been quite tense recently, the conflicts between the super forces still hadn't escalated into an all-out war.
<br><br>
At least the Bearing race still hadn't declared war against Pear Hill, so Fuxi's intervention somehow lacked a good reason.
<br><br>
With a disdainful look on his face, Fuxi still retorted, "Yellow Thearch, there's no need to waste your breath on bickering at this point! From now on, the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill are one. I will smash anyone who dare hurt a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace into pieces! Am I clear now?"
<br><br>
All the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were deeply moved upon hearing Fuxi's words.
<br><br>
The Human Sovereign had always been regarded as the strongest warrior of the human race, and now he was quite determined to protect them.
<br><br>
"Do you want to declare war on my Bearing race?" At that point, the veins on Yellow Thearch's forehead popped, and there was a fiery rage in his eyes.
<br><br>
As the emperor of the Bearing race, he could no longer stand Fuxi's defiance against him no matter how good-tempered he was.
<br><br>
Fuxi glanced at him, and chuckled, "You came all the way here not just to enjoy the scenery, did you?"
<br><br>
In reality, several super forces already knew that the Source World was already on the brink of a full-scale war, and it could probably happen today.
<br><br>
"You're right. It would be my pleasure to fight you..."
<br><br>
At that moment, Yellow Thearch gently slid his finger across his chest, then his golden silk robe floated away with the wind and revealed a close-fitting black armor inside.
<br><br>
Fuxi was well-known as the Human Sovereign, and the title was enough to demand the respect he enjoyed from all the humans.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Bearing race's influence hugely increased over the years because they had allied with other races. Still, Yellow Thearch's real strength was a secret to outsiders. There were even rumors that he was mightier than Fuxi.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch spread out his hand in the air, and a crack appeared in his palm. Blood gushed out from the crack and quickly formed a simple threefoot-long sword.
<br><br>
It was his lifeblood treasure, the Yellow Thearch Sword, which came from his root-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Even though Yellow Thearch and Fuxi belonged to different super forces, they had dealt with each other for countless years.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch knew what kind of person Fuxi was. He was the type that once he had chosen a path, he never showed mercy to anyone who dared hinder him.
<br><br>
That was why Yellow Thearch would certainly fight him with all his strength.
<br><br>
"I'll hold Fuxi back. Mahoney, you should go and block the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer, you're responsible for taking Zen away," Yellow Thearch said through his life vitality.
<br><br>
Before he set out, he had set other goals, including killing Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.
<br><br>
But since the three forces confronted each other now, the situation became too complicated.
<br><br>
As a result, Yellow Thearch began to feel uncertain due to pressure from the battle. "What about the Snake Goddess?" Mahoney asked.
<br><br>
Everyone was afraid of Fuxi's formidable fighting ability, but what they feared more was the wisdom of the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
When they realized that the Snake Goddess still hadn't shown herself, all the Eternal Realm warriors further increased their guard.
<br><br>
Chapter 3851 Tomos A hint of fear could be seen in Yellow Thearch's eyes.
<br><br>
Before the Snake Goddess made a move, they wouldn't know what the result would be.
<br><br>
"If the Black Ship wants to mess things up, then everything will change. We need to take action according to the situation," said Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
He had hoped for things to be under control, but that was not what it was at the moment.
<br><br>
"Go!"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch raised the sword in his hand, the golden light around it shining brightly.
<br><br>
This sword light seemed to follow a holy path. This sword strike seemed invincible and looked like it could destroy everything in the world.
<br><br>
"Will our choice be worth it?" Divine Farmer asked, worried. He was still uneasy about the developments and thought it wrong to go against the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"The gift of fate has already been marked with a price. Perhaps it's time for us to pay back," Yellow Thearch said, jumping up.
<br><br>
The golden light enveloped his sword. It looked like he was holding a torch and his own holy path.
<br><br>
The Eternal Realm masters like Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer and Mahoney were shocked at the death of Emperor Charm. They were now doubting the path they had chosen.
<br><br>
But there was no point doubting themselves now. They were destined to not be able to get rid of the Element Spirit race. What was more, they had placed all their bets on the Element Spirit race a long time ago.
<br><br>
The Element Spirit race didn't extend their help and support for free, and it was now time for them to pay the price.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The golden light soared into the sky and then began to pour down.
<br><br>
It was as if someone had pierced through the sun with a sword and caused the flames to flow down the sun's body.
<br><br>
But that wasn't a flame. It was the holy way, a comprehension exclusive to Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
"Good timing!"
<br><br>
Fuxi exclaimed, his face lighting up.
<br><br>
He trembled with excitement, not having met an opponent of this level in a long time.
<br><br>
The golden holy path poured down, an inexplicable aura surrounding it.
<br><br>
The weaker disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace bent down to kneel before the holy path.
<br><br>
It took a lot of energy even for powerful and strong-minded warriors like Libby to resist the aura.
<br><br>
Buzz! A mark of Eight Diagrams suddenly appeared on the golden holy path.
<br><br>
Fuxi then threw a punch at this mark, a boom resounding through the people present.
<br><br>
Fuxi's punch smashed the invincible and overbearing-looking holy way into pieces.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Fuxi had also disappeared along with the holy path.
<br><br>
But in the next moment, he appeared behind Yellow Thearch, with a mark of Eight Diagrams on Yellow Thearch's back.
<br><br>
"I have disliked you for a long time!" Fuxi said as he prepared to throw a punch.
<br><br>
As long as the mark of Eight Diagrams remained with him, this punch would definitely hit its target.
<br><br>
There were very few people in this world who could resist Fuxi's punch.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch, who had turned around at Fuxi's words, swung his sword towards Fuxi's fist.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch would suffer greatly against Fuxi's fist, but if his sword were to pierce into Fuxi's fist, it would disable one of his arms for the time being.
<br><br>
Fuxi frowned and lowered his hand, dodging Yellow Thearch's sword. He wanted to attack him again.
<br><br>
But Yellow Thearch's sword was still aimed at Fuxi's fist after it had drawn a circle.
<br><br>
After a while, it looked like they were sparring with each other. The way they were fighting looked strange and absurd, but they were in great danger.
<br><br>
Fuxi was an irritable man. He retreated a thousand feet in the air, gathering all his energies to throw another punch. But Yellow Thearch merely smiled as he said, "It's too late."
<br><br>
Bang! The mark on Yellow Thearch's back exploded with a loud bang.
<br><br>
The mark of Eight Diagrams lasted for a while and would automatically explode if Fuxi didn't trigger it.
<br><br>
The explosion was powerful enough to be impressive, but it was nothing to Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked at Yellow Thearch, his face devoid of expression, and said, "You haven't made any progress over all these years."
<br><br>
"I've made enough to defeat you!"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch had raised his sword up before him so that it was parallel to the ground. As the golden light boomed again, the two top masters of the Source World dove in to fight each other once again.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch had just made his move when Divine Farmer made his way across the space to Elizabeth's side, one hand on the red crystal.
<br><br>
Fuxi was very clear about the fact that someone else would be attacking Zen. But he had no choice but to go all out while facing Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
He'd face defeat if he so much as got distracted one tiny bit. That was why he couldn't protect Zen at the moment.
<br><br>
"Let go of him and I won't kill you," Divine Farmer said, staring at Elizabeth.
<br><br>
The old man was not unfamiliar to Elizabeth.
<br><br>
She had come into contact with Divine Farmer several times when she had followed Emperor Charm. This was how they were familiar with each other.
<br><br>
"I can't do that," Elizabeth said, shrugging.
<br><br>
"So be it. You should know that I'm not going to let you off even if Emperor Charm is still alive," Divine Farmer said, wiggling his hand and causing a jade ruler to pop out of his arm.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer Ruler was his life's treasure, which could both kill and save people.
<br><br>
He waved the ruler around before throwing a deadly-looking strike at Elizabeth.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the Divine Farmer Ruler was going to kill people. As Divine Farmer waved the ruler around, the smell of blood permeated the air around them. If the weaker ones were to take even one sip, their skin and flesh would rot and they would turn into dried bones.
<br><br>
Now that she was facing an Eternal Realm master who was even stronger than Emperor Charm, Elizabeth didn't know how to fight back.
<br><br>
She lowered her body in order to avoid the Divine Farmer Ruler and moved behind the crystal.
<br><br>
Since Divine Farmer and Elizabeth were previously acquainted, he showed her some mercy. But if he were to use all his strength, he would definitely kill her.
<br><br>
However, after Elizabeth had dodged him by hiding behind the red crystal, the surging divine flames of the Sun Crow race shot towards Divine Farmer along the red crystal, and in an instant, surrounded him.
<br><br>
Phew! The divine flames of the Sun Crow race still couldn't destroy Divine Farmer's Chaotic Source Spirits, but Divine Farmer was angry. "You're reckless, aren't you?" he spat out. "You're courting death!"
<br><br>
Thick green light flashed out from the center of the Divine Farmer Ruler and turned into a green, thumb-sized hummingbird.
<br><br>
The hummingbird devoured the divine flames of the Sun Crow race on the surface of Divine Farmer's body, and then charged towards Elizabeth.
<br><br>
"Venomous Candle Hummingbird!" Elizabeth said knowingly.
<br><br>
She was experienced and knowledgeable, and knew that this theurgy of Divine Farmer was formidable.
<br><br>
If she didn't retreat now, this little hummingbird would definitely kill her.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Elizabeth loosened her grip and entered the space channel, simultaneously appearing at a spot thousands of feet away.
<br><br>
Her eyebrows furrowed in indignation.
<br><br>
The gap between her strength and Divine Farmer's was too great.
<br><br>
It was obvious that she was no match for him.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer was about to move away with the red crystal when a cloud of black smoke suddenly appeared on the surface of the red crystal.
<br><br>
The black smoke had a special characteristic that allowed it to drill into the red crystal.
<br><br>
"Is that the Filthy Smoke?"
<br><br>
Elizabeth was surprised to see the black smoke.
<br><br>
Anything that was tainted with the Filthy Smoke couldn't be transferred through space channels.
<br><br>
Half of Divine Farmer's body had already drilled into the space channel. He didn't know what was happening outside. When he grabbed the red crystal and tried to stuff it into the channel, he discovered that he couldn't do it.
<br><br>
He had no choice but to drill out of the space channel. On inspection, he found that an Ear Mouse was holding a cigarette pipe and blowing out black smoke.
<br><br>
It was none other than Tomos, the betrayer of the Ear Mouse race and a member of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Chapter 3852 Cooperation According to the Divine Farmer's plan, he must leave with the red crystal as quickly as possible. He must do this without any delay.
<br><br>
He thought that if the captain of the Black Ship tried to stop him, he would immediately release a space snake.
<br><br>
It was known that the space snakes were almost extinct within the Three Purities Stage. They naturally lived in the void. However, there were only three of them left now, one of which was in the possession of the Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
The space snake was given to the Divine Farmer as a gift. He received it from the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
The space snake had a rare and useful ability. It could temporarily change the shape of the space channel. This was extremely helpful in times when the user wanted to make sure that no one else could enter the space channel.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer figured that he would be able to escape with Zen as long as the captain of the Black Ship didn't break his space channel.
<br><br>
However, a problem occurred before he could even drag Zen into the space channel. The red crystal had already been contaminated by the Filthy Smoke. The expression on the Divine Farmer's face was indescribable. It looked frightening.
<br><br>
His strength was comparable to that of the Yellow Thearch. However, he preferred not getting into fights. He rarely fought whenever he was in the Source World.
<br><br>
"How dare you stop me?" Anger began to show in the Divine Farmer's eyes. He grabbed the red crystal with his left hand. Meanwhile, he held the Divine Farmer Ruler on his right. With that, he charged fearlessly towards Tomos.
<br><br>
Even though it was now facing an Eternal Realm master, Tomos maintained its composure.
<br><br>
As it saw the Divine Farmer approaching it at breakneck speed, Tomos immediately smoked its pipe.
<br><br>
Bang! A loud noise echoed through the space.
<br><br>
Before Tomos could blow the smoke out of its pipe, the Divine Farmer had already hacked at its head with the ruler.
<br><br>
A direct attack from an Eternal Realm master was more than enough to kill a Holy Soul Realm warrior.
<br><br>
As soon as the Divine Farmer slashed, he easily cracked and split Tomos' skull wide open. Its body appeared as though it had been seared by the scorching sun. In addition to that, it had no shape. There was only some sort of gray smoke under its skin.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! As the gray smoke started to dissipate, it quickly formed a cage and effectively trapped the Divine Farmer inside it.
<br><br>
"You are truly extraordinary as an Eternal Realm master. I must admit that I have always admired you. However, I may have to offend you today."
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship were a little different from other forces. It was in the sense that all of them were desperadoes. The moment they decided to join the Black Ship, they had already abandoned everything else.
<br><br>
They didn't care whether they lived or died.
<br><br>
They didn't care about how powerful their opponents were. No matter what happened, they refused to give up without a fight.
<br><br>
Just then, three Ear Mice that looked exactly like Tomos appeared inside the cage. It was apparent that they were made out of the smoke.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid it would be very unwise of you to provoke me!"
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer slowly raised the green ruler in his hand. As he did this, he lightly stepped into the air.
<br><br>
A string of bright and colorful lights began to encircle him. A profound space law flitted upon his body as though it was dancing.
<br><br>
He brandished his ruler then slashed at the Ear Mice. With graceful ease, he had split the three smoke incarnations apart.
<br><br>
However, three more smoke incarnations instantly appeared not far away from him.
<br><br>
He took a slight step forward and seemed like he was about to charge towards them. But all of a sudden, he turned around and stabbed.
<br><br>
Puff! It sounded like something popped.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer Ruler had pierced into the void. Then, blood started to fill the space where the Divine Farmer had stabbed.
<br><br>
At once, Tomos materialized and its body began to rapidly dissipate. It immediately turned into traces of green that gathered around the Divine Farmer Ruler.
<br><br>
"Do you think this pathetic little trick can deceive me?" the Divine Farmer asked with a cold and hard expression on his face.
<br><br>
Tomos' face didn't quite express any pain. In fact, it even revealed a sly smile. "Perhaps..."
<br><br>
As soon as it said this, its body quickly rotted and turned into a horriblelooking corpse. It seemed like this was still not its real body.
<br><br>
While watching this scene unfold before him, the Divine Farmer noticed a white and weightless bandage had materialized on the red crystal in his hand. The moment the bandage touched the red crystal, it had spread out and covered the red crystal in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
The bandage had tightly wrapped itself around the red crystal. Suddenly, there was an awfully strong pulling force coming from the bandage.
<br><br>
Without any warning, it dragged the red crystal towards the sky.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer was caught off guard by this abrupt move and the red crystal slipped out of his grasp.
<br><br>
However, he reacted very quickly. When he saw the red crystal being pulled away by the bandage, he instantly went after it and swiftly grabbed it in his hand.
<br><br>
But then, the Divine Farmer felt a powerful force pulling at the other end of the bandage. It was so strong that it also dragged him away. This force was utterly formidable.
<br><br>
"Well then, we will see who is stronger!"
<br><br>
As he said this, the Divine Farmer's face darkened. The power within his body suddenly erupted.
<br><br>
It was well-known that there was a huge gap between the Eternal Realm and the Holy Soul Realm warriors. They had huge differences in terms of physical strength, real strength, speed, and soul.
<br><br>
The moment the Divine Farmer's power had erupted, the bandage could no longer be pulled away from him. It couldn't budge for even a millimeter.
<br><br>
"Break!"
<br><br>
With a wave of the long ruler in his hand, he instantly severed the bandage off.
<br><br>
However, he frowned as he grasped the red crystal with his other hand. It didn't feel as heavy as it used to be. He felt a bad sense of foreboding.
<br><br>
He tore off the bandage in a hurry, only to find a big black stone inside it! "This can't be..."
<br><br>
The red crystal that contained Zen inside had actually been replaced! "My apologies."
<br><br>
Once again, Tomos appeared a short distance from the Divine Farmer. It bowed to him then turned into gray smoke and instantly dissipated.
<br><br>
The warriors at the Eternal Realm considered those at the Holy Soul Realm as weak beings.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the number of warriors at the Holy Soul Realm in the Divine Farmer race was ten times bigger than that of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer thought that it didn't matter even if they had Other Shore Tokens from the Three Purities Stage. Their number was too small. It was not enough to fight against him because the gap in strength was just too huge.
<br><br>
But obviously, the members of the Black Ship were far stronger than the ordinary warriors at the Holy Soul Realm. With their cunning tricks and teamwork, they had actually managed to take away Zen from the Divine Farmer's hands! The Divine Farmer felt he was fooled. He had walked right into their trap.
<br><br>
This was extremely humiliating! He couldn't accept that he had fallen for their cheap tricks.
<br><br>
"How dare you play tricks on me? You will pay for this!"
<br><br>
The cultivated Divine Farmer finally showed a terrifyingly ferocious expression on his face.
<br><br>
A thin crack appeared on his forehead. It began to open slowly and revealed an eyeball. A triangular frame appeared on the surface of the eyeball.
<br><br>
Afterwards, there was a sudden flash of brilliant light.
<br><br>
After being punched by Fuxi, Usman had remained lying on the ground and gasping for breath. At this very moment, a triangular frame suddenly appeared in his eyes. At once, his body seemed like it was being controlled by his eyes. His eyeballs bulged and lifted his upper body with force. At the same time, his head spun in a strange angle.
<br><br>
Cracking sounds could be heard as his head spun around. Obviously, his neck was broken.
<br><br>
However, he didn't feel any pain. He closed his eyes and fell to the ground once more. He quickly had regained his consciousness.
<br><br>
When he woke up, he had no idea what had happened. But the severe pain from his neck made him wince and curse.
<br><br>
He looked around him and a strange and different sight was transmitted to the Divine Farmer's mind.
<br><br>
At that moment, he appeared as though he was looking down at the whole Separate Amber Province. He was able to see everything within the province very clearly. He continued to scan through the horizon. Soon enough, he noticed something a hundred miles away from him.
<br><br>
He saw a space ship floating alone in the void. The members of the Black Ship were either sitting or leaning inside it. The red crystal that contained Zen was dragged by a bandage into the space ship.
<br><br>
All these times, the Divine Farmer thought that his opponent must be the captain of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
He wouldn't be so angry if it was the captain of the Black Ship that was able to take Zen away. But now that he knew it was merely a group of warriors at the Holy Soul Realm who managed to easily abduct Zen, he was utterly infuriated.
<br><br>
"You will pay for this with your lives!"
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the Divine Farmer's figure became huge. With this, the Divine Farmer Ruler also grew in length and size.
<br><br>
He took a mere step forward and was able to cross a hundred miles. The Divine Farmer Ruler in his hand slashed towards the void.
<br><br>
With the slash, the void collapsed. The space ship couldn't remain intact.
<br><br>
Chapter 3853 Trapping Just then, several people joined hands to take away Zen's red crystal.
<br><br>
After Tomos stopped the crystal from being taken away with the smoke, he and Shera respectively used the illusion skill and the controlling technique to confuse Divine Farmer's judgment.
<br><br>
And indeed, Divine Farmer misjudged.
<br><br>
The 'bamboo pole' untied his bandage to wrap around the red crystal.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, another Black Ship member's skill was used to replace the red crystal with the stone.
<br><br>
It was the brass man who dragged the bandage, and he had a unique secret technique that allowed him to increase his strength threefold in a short period of time.
<br><br>
Once he activated the technique, the brass man was powerful enough to fight against even an Eternal Realm master.
<br><br>
In truth, if Divine Farmer was on full alert, even the Black Ship members could have a difficult time taking Zen away.
<br><br>
But Divine Farmer had always been on guard against the Black Ship's captain. Because he didn't quite take these people seriously, they found their chance to take action.
<br><br>
Now, in Divine Farmer's towering rage, he swung his ruler, slashing it down. The broken space spread all the way toward the space flying ship.
<br><br>
Inside, the members of the Black Ship had just brought in the red crystal, while Shera was leaning against the crystal to observe.
<br><br>
Just then, a crack in the sky rapidly spread over, shocking everyone with the sight.
<br><br>
"He found us out so soon." Tomo's eyes were full of astonishment.
<br><br>
"An Eternal Realm master naturally has the ability mysterious to anyone else. Edith, just transfer to another space." Shera turned around and gave the order.
<br><br>
In the corner of the space ship sat a blue-skinned woman with long locks.
<br><br>
Her Other Shore Token was passed to her by the Grandmaster of Heaven. It was the transparent flying ship docking in the void and happened to be the Invisible Ship in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Theoretically, even an Eternal Realm master would find it difficult to find this ship—it wasn't one that could be easily sniffed out.
<br><br>
But the Black Ship people never expected Divine Farmer to make use of Usman's ability. Since the latter took control of the entire Separate Amber Province, everything there was in his view.
<br><br>
"Okay, Shera." Edith nodded.
<br><br>
She had a rather pitiful background—her very race had been exterminated, leaving solely her behind.
<br><br>
While she had never been particularly famous in the Black Ship, the other members of the Black Ship, Shera most especially, had always treated her very well.
<br><br>
In turn, Edith also treated Shera as her very own big sister.
<br><br>
With a flash of light in her gray eyes, the Invisible Ship suddenly collapsed, and the ruler of Divine Farmer then failed to hit it.
<br><br>
The entire space was concentrated at a single point. In the next moment, Edith had controlled the Invisible Ship, making it appear in another location a hundred miles away.
<br><br>
But the distance of a hundred miles was nothing to an Eternal Realm master.
<br><br>
Still, Edith and the rest of the Black Ship were highly confident in the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer couldn't discover it too soon, regardless.
<br><br>
But once Divine Farmer saw the ship disappear, his face grew dark as the eye in his forehead flashed again.
<br><br>
Usman was getting up from the ground.
<br><br>
The force of twisting his neck came from his own body just now, so this force was not transferred to the boundary wall.
<br><br>
In his confusion, he felt that his eyes bulged, dragging his entire head to twist.
<br><br>
"Again!"
<br><br>
This time, Usman was smarter about it.
<br><br>
So he merely jumped up and rotated his body along with the direction his eyeballs were circling in.
<br><br>
He had to turn in a full circle before his eyes recovered.
<br><br>
But the situation still left him just as clueless.
<br><br>
After finding the ship through Usman's eyes, Divine Farmer advanced again, slashing his ruler in the ship's direction.
<br><br>
The motion completely shocked Edith.
<br><br>
She was certain to leave no clue whatsoever when she moved the ship.
<br><br>
Even the Eternal Realm warriors couldn't track her. It was unimaginable that Divine Farmer was still able to do so.
<br><br>
"Keep moving!"
<br><br>
Before she could even finish calling out, the Invisible Ship disappeared once again.
<br><br>
But just as it moved, Divine Farmer managed to catch up, closing the distance between him and the ship.
<br><br>
At this point, the Black Ship people couldn't remain composed.
<br><br>
"How did he find us?"
<br><br>
"Look, he's coming again!"
<br><br>
"Was there any clue left on the red crystal?"
<br><br>
They searched frantically for a clue, completely reluctant to fight against Divine Farmer directly.
<br><br>
"Would Usman have told him how to find the ship?" Shera asked.
<br><br>
"It's possible..." Edith nodded, considering the thought.
<br><br>
Many years ago, Usman easily found the ship with a unique ability.
<br><br>
"That guy..." Even the brass man was deep in confusion, displeased.
<br><br>
While Usman had troubled the Black Ship before, never did it occur to them that Usman would dare do it again after being reborn—he was a natural troublemaker.
<br><br>
"What should we do? Should we find a way to kill Usman?" asked the "bamboo pole".
<br><br>
"We can't kill him. Even Fuxi can't kill him, let alone any of us," Shera said regretfully, shaking her head.
<br><br>
Seeing Divine Farmer approach, Edith had no time to even speak. The moment she reached a place, she had to move away immediately. If she was even a second slower, the Invisible Ship would be destroyed.
<br><br>
Usman suffered greatly under such a case.
<br><br>
Each time Divine Farmer checked the ship's location, Usman's eyes bulged and pulled him to a complete turn.
<br><br>
Yet if he didn't cooperate, his neck would be completely twisted off.
<br><br>
And so while people could see Usman constantly spinning in circles and cursing into the air, they had no clue what was happening to him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the sky above the Separate Amber Province, the Black Ship's captain stood atop his ship's bow.
<br><br>
The edges of his black cloak were drenched in blood which seemed to be flowing somehow, heated up and emitting fine bubbles.
<br><br>
The ship's surface was also badly charred.
<br><br>
While there was no actual fire, the ship had been charred anyway, becoming suited to its name, Black Ship.
<br><br>
Before the captain was the huge shadow of Snake Goddess floating in the air. It had already stretched out its arms to envelop the entire ship, along with the captain.
<br><br>
And so the captain couldn't take action being directly confronted by the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, Divine Farmer has already attacked the Black Ship's members. With the strength of Divine Farmer, sooner or later, he'll be able to take Zen away. I don't think it's wise to fight me," the captain said.
<br><br>
It was Divine Farmer and the Black Ship members that fought over Zen, after all.
<br><br>
Regardless of who got the man, the result would be unacceptable to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"The Black Ship members may be only a group of Holy Soul Realm warriors, but they are not ordinary ones. Not long ago, it took only four of them to stop the Thunder Dimorphodon. No matter how powerful Divine Farmer is, the outcome will not be determined in such a short period of time." The Snake Goddess was shaking her head, highly confident in her own judgment.
<br><br>
"But what's the point of trapping me?" asked the captain again.
<br><br>
"It will be meaningful once Fuxi wins," responded the Snake Goddess calmly.
<br><br>
If Fuxi defeated Yellow Thearch, he'd have enough time and energy to fight for Zen. Whether or not there were other variables involved, she had to act accordingly.
<br><br>
In truth, at this point, the three forces were still testing each other—both the Snake Goddess and the captain were cautious, carefully trying to pick out each other's trump card.
<br><br>
Chapter 3854 Fuxi's Great Strength A small shadow soared through the air and crashed into the side of an enormous stone mountain, well over ten thousand feet in height. It had stood there, solid and immovable, for thousands of years. As soon as the shadow hit the stones, the mountain collapsed as though it had never existed.
<br><br>
Deep rumbling sounds echoed as the mountain crumbled from the force of the impact.
<br><br>
The huge mountain had been destroyed in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
The stone shards of the mountain flew out in all directions. Many were sharp and deadly, and pierced through the nearby creatures like airborne weapons.
<br><br>
Most of the stabbed creatures died immediately. For all who lived in the mountain area, this day was the end of their world.
<br><br>
As the rumbles of the collapsing mountain began to fade, there was a strange buzzing noise.
<br><br>
A mark of the Eight Diagrams had appeared on the ruins of the mountain. A closer inspection revealed that the outer layer of the mark was blurry, because it was actually formed by the overlapping of many marks.
<br><br>
"Take this!"
<br><br>
A boom sounded.
<br><br>
For a moment, time seemed to stop and stand still.
<br><br>
Fuxi's arms were barely visible as he landed thousands of punches in very, very rapid succession. The speed and force of the punches released a great energy that flowed down from the ruins of the mountain.
<br><br>
But the buzzing sound continued.
<br><br>
The various noises merged with each other, each loud enough to obscure the original sounds, until only a continuous high-pitched note could be heard.
<br><br>
The overlapping marks of the Eight Diagrams exploded simultaneously.
<br><br>
The ground began to sink beneath the rubble of the mountain.
<br><br>
One thousand feet, ten thousand feet, one hundred thousand feet, one million feet...
<br><br>
The Source World was hollow, and almost all of its living beings lived in the inner layer. The outer layer was not thick. The thickest part was only sixty million feet at most, and the thinnest part was only a few million feet.
<br><br>
The majority of the exit points from the Source World were located in the weak spots of the outer layer.
<br><br>
The Separate Amber Province was itself located in a weak spot. The distance from its surface to the chaos outside was only more than ten million feet. Now, through sheer force, Fuxi had smashed it through.
<br><br>
In the chaos, the Yellow Thearch Sword exuded a golden light, ensuring the protection of the Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
The golden light contained a holy way with the strongest defensive power.
<br><br>
However, even with such protection, the Yellow Thearch was still in a sorry state.
<br><br>
He had felt very confident since the defeat of the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
With the help of the Element Spirit race, his strength had improved by leaps and bounds. He became much more skillful in the use of his bloodline and the combination of Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi—who used to be honored as the strongest warrior at the Eternal Realm—was just an amateur. However, with his talent and fierce pursuit in the Three Purities Stage, he achieved what he had today.
<br><br>
Now, in the middle of the battle, the Yellow Thearch realized that he had underestimated Fuxi.
<br><br>
Fuxi didn't have many techniques. He didn't even rely on any Other Shore Token. He was simply strong.
<br><br>
Fuxi's relentless attack penetrated through the weak spot.
<br><br>
As he penetrated through the ground of Separate Amber Province, chaotic energy poured in through the hole, spreading throughout the province.
<br><br>
The energy burst into the Source World, emitting a buzzing noise.
<br><br>
The first wisp of chaotic energy swept past the rubble and came into contact with a blade of grass. In an instant, the green grass withered, blackened, and died.
<br><br>
For weaker creatures, chaotic energy was a deadly poison.
<br><br>
Many creatures in the vast Source World did not have the strength to resist the chaotic energy. Most of the aborigines in the Separate Amber Province would die.
<br><br>
"Your sword is very good. It saved your life," said Fuxi calmly, standing at the entrance of the hole.
<br><br>
Although he stood over one thousand feet away, his voice was clear and loud.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch floated in the chaos. He withdrew his sword and said grimly, "The sword is a part of me."
<br><br>
A lifeblood weapon was refined with one's own bloodline, so the Yellow Thearch's statement made sense.
<br><br>
"I knew the strength of your sword a long time ago," Fuxi replied. "If the Element Spirit race hadn't helped you to refine it, I would have broken it already." Fuxi spoke in a confident tone, as he stood in front of a hole he had punched through the very fabric of the Source World.
<br><br>
Especially now, he felt incomparably strong, as though there was nothing in the world that he couldn't break.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch slowly raised his sword above his head. "Everyone has their own lucky chances. I was lucky that I got the help of the Element Spirit race, and you were also lucky because you got the secret blood inheritance."
<br><br>
As he talked, the Yellow Thearch Sword emitted a golden light, and three holy ways appeared. They were one of his most powerful theurgies.
<br><br>
"But luck isn't the most important factor! In the end, strength and weakness matter the most," said the Yellow Thearch. With a gentle motion, he shook his long sword.
<br><br>
The three holy ways intertwined and headed straight for Fuxi in the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
"Today you will learn what real strength is!"
<br><br>
Fuxi said coldly. He did not try to evade the attack. He stood directly in its path and raised his fist as he saw the three holy ways rushing towards him.
<br><br>
He didn't care what kind of theurgy the Yellow Thearch used. He was certain that whatever attack came his way, he would be able to block it and smash it into pieces.
<br><br>
The holy ways swooped towards him.
<br><br>
Several marks of the Eight Diagrams appeared on the holy ways. Fuxi threw several punches, and the marks immediately exploded.
<br><br>
But the holy ways were not broken by the explosion. They seemed like illusions, impervious to the impact of Fuxi's blows.
<br><br>
The holy ways seemed to be both concrete and ethereal, and they behaved in an unpredictable manner.
<br><br>
"Fists are not enough for the holy ways," the Yellow Thearch said with a sneer. "Now let's see if you have any real strength."
<br><br>
The three illusory holy ways surrounded Fuxi, and cracks began to form in the golden light. Soon, the holy ways reformed into a thin net that enclosed Fuxi.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch left his spot.
<br><br>
In an instant, he appeared outside the net. He gazed at Fuxi, trapped within the crisscrossing lines.
<br><br>
The golden light emanated continuously from the surface of the Yellow Thearch Sword. He thrust the sword forward, and a terrifying energy was released from the thin strands of the net. Every line turned into sharp golden sword radiance, shrinking towards Fuxi in the center of the net.
<br><br>
"Shatter!" commanded the Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
Instantly, it was as though thousands of swords slashed at Fuxi.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch launched this attack with all his strength.
<br><br>
He was so focused that his very bloodline seemed to boil, and his eyes glowed with a golden light. He put all his energy into attacking Fuxi, wanting to tear him to pieces.
<br><br>
The golden sword radiance slashed into Fuxi's body.
<br><br>
The net had shrunk and now completely enveloped Fuxi until he was no longer visible.
<br><br>
In that moment, the sword radiance exploded, and it was so bright that even the sun looked dim in comparison.
<br><br>
In the far distance, the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race paused briefly amid their fighting to glance at the golden glow of sword radiance on the horizon.
<br><br>
However, the Yellow Thearch was not Emperor Charm. The swordsmanship he cultivated was completely different from Emperor Charm's Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy.
<br><br>
Several moments passed before the golden light dissipated completely.
<br><br>
Something unexpected had happened. When the Yellow Thearch saw the result of his attack, his eyes widened, and one eyelid began twitching with alarm.
<br><br>
Fuxi stood there, entirely unharmed. He wore a slight, sardonic smile as he said, "Well, you said my fists are weak, but your sword seems even weaker! You have no true strength! You are weak."
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes glinted as he repeated, "Weak!"
<br><br>
With that final word, Fuxi vanished.
<br><br>
The marks of the Eight Diagrams appeared and rushed towards the Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
Fuxi came into view, threw a punch, and disappeared again.
<br><br>
The Yellow Thearch couldn't follow Fuxi's motions because he was moving at an unimaginable speed. Every time he caught a glimpse of Fuxi, he was in a different position. This made it difficult, if not impossible, for the Yellow Thearch to launch a counterattack.
<br><br>
This put the Yellow Thearch at a severe disadvantage. He was forced to passively wait to see what Fuxi planned to do, without any chance to fight back.
<br><br>
Chapter 3855 The Land Of Ancient Flesh The huge shadow of Snake Goddess stayed still up in the sky as its arms held the black ship.
<br><br>
Snake Goddess and the captain of the Black Ship previously used their own methods to learn about the full situation, and they also watched the battle between Fuxi and the Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
Just now, the captain of the Black Ship thought that the Snake Goddess was too confident. After all, the Yellow Thearch was still quite powerful, and it wasn't easy for Fuxi to take him down.
<br><br>
When they fought, however, it was evident that they were far too different.
<br><br>
Fuxi was much more powerful than everyone had expected. The captain quickly grew serious, and he said, "It seems that there is a reason for your confidence in the Human Sovereign."
<br><br>
"Of course," the Snake Goddess said with a glint in her cat-like eyes.
<br><br>
"But, are you confident enough to trap me here?" At that moment, the captain looked at the shadow of Snake Goddess above his head.
<br><br>
If Fuxi had really killed the Yellow Thearch, then the members of the Black Ship and the Divine Farmer would fall into Fuxi's hands no matter who won.
<br><br>
The mere thought of it made the captain restless.
<br><br>
"If you want to try, you can do it with Mahoney," the Snake Goddess calmly said as she looked towards the void on the left.
<br><br>
The area exhibited a wave of space fluctuation, and Mahoney, who was hiding inside, appeared.
<br><br>
"You are quite keen, Snake Goddess," she said.
<br><br>
"Your whispers are too loud," the Snake Goddess replied.
<br><br>
At first, Mahoney planned to attack the captain, but the captain asked his crew to fight, so things changed.
<br><br>
She had been hiding in the dark and waiting for a good chance. She never thought that the Yellow Thearch would be disadvantaged, so she took the initiative to communicate with the captain.
<br><br>
While all of that happened, the Snake Goddess had cleverly captured the wave of their consciousness. "I wonder who is stronger, you or the Human Sovereign?" the captain asked.
<br><br>
In reality, Fuxi's power scared the captain. He hadn't seen the Snake Goddess fight for a long time. If she was as strong as Fuxi, then things would get tricky.
<br><br>
The captain was first quite confident in himself. He thought that he was as strong as the Yellow Thearch, so when he saw that the Yellow Thearch got defeated all the time, he became not that confident.
<br><br>
Confidence was the foundation of strength, but arrogance that grew out of confidence was a hindrance to survival.
<br><br>
The captain had what he had today because he never underestimated any of his opponents.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked down and shook her head. "If I were the Human Sovereign, and the Yellow Thearch didn't have another trump card, he would have died," she commented.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Mahoney and the captain frowned.
<br><br>
Did the Snake Goddess mean that she was stronger than Fuxi? "If so, then we can only try," the captain stated.
<br><br>
A cyan Other Shore Token appeared on the surface of Mahoney's body. It was the Spearhead Armor of Destruction that Emperor Charm had worn.
<br><br>
Then, a powerful force continuously gathered within her body.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess gently raised her head and put her hands on either side.
<br><br>
Her large shadow followed suit and waved its hands to slap both the captain's and Mahoney's heads.
<br><br>
Swish! The shadow of Snake Goddess was made out of pure energy and could erode almost anything.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it was much purer than those of the people of Pear Hill because she was their leader.
<br><br>
In turn, Mahoney flew backward to avoid the energy beams.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the captain of the Black Ship stood at the side and waited for the shadow of Snake Goddess to descend from the sky. As soon as her shadow landed on the black ship, his black cloak exploded.
<br><br>
A bald man emerged from the black cloak. He was covered in a thin layer of scales and had two sharp horns on his forehead.
<br><br>
The captain didn't resist but let the energy beam hit him.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Some of the long and thin energy beams at the end of the shadow of Snake Goddess landed on the black ship.
<br><br>
The black ship immediately shattered, while the energy eroded its wooden body and set it on fire.
<br><br>
Then, the energy beams in the middle lashed at the captain's skin and burned him. Bright red blood gushed out of his charred black scars.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess found it strange that the captain didn't dodge. However, she would never hesitate in such a battle.
<br><br>
Since he didn't avoid the attacks, she would kill him first.
<br><br>
The fabric of her golden dress fluttered when she slightly twisted her waist.
<br><br>
Her shadow followed her and turned around, then forced Mahoney back with ease.
<br><br>
Afterwards, she reached out her other hand towards the captain.
<br><br>
Her shadow also did the same thing with one hand and the tentacle-like energy beams wrapped around the captain.
<br><br>
The erosion caused by the pure energy beams was terrible, especially since they came from the shadow of Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
The energy beams went into the captain's body at a visible speed. Blood spurted out of his sunken body, then the energy beams quickly evaporated it.
<br><br>
Mahoney was stunned when she saw the scene.
<br><br>
Was the captain trying to get himself killed? Would the Snake Goddess kill him in that way? Or perhaps the Snake Goddess had used a method that made the captain unable to dodge? Multiple thoughts swam in Mahoney's head. She now wanted to escape as quickly as possible.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the energy beams quickly eroded the captain's body into two. His whole body melted like a candle. He would surely die.
<br><br>
Still, the Snake Goddess didn't feel relaxed at all. She didn't think that the captain was dead. Instead, she remained highly vigilant and stared straight at the other black ships not far away.
<br><br>
"The power of your shadow is truly extraordinary." The captain's voice floated over. This time, he appeared on another black ship.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Just then, Mahoney squinted to get a closer look.
<br><br>
Truth was, it wasn't difficult to get a physical avatar with their strength. It also wasn't hard to distinguish if the opponent was a real body or an avatar.
<br><br>
Mahoney just saw that the shadow of Snake Goddess had eroded the captain's real body. How did he reappear? Maybe he had used some rare Other Shore Token to bring himself back to life, but there was no reason for him to let the Snake Goddess kill him once.
<br><br>
"It seems that the rumor is true," said the Snake Goddess. She bit her lips, crossed her hands, and waved them.
<br><br>
"I heard that the captain of the Black Ship doesn't have a real body. These ships are your bodies!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The moment she finished speaking, countless energy beams lashed towards the black ships like whips.
<br><br>
Most people thought that the Black Ship was an intimidating force, but the real strong ones were its members. The ships were just ordinary flying ships.
<br><br>
Without the help of those at the Eternal Realm, the ordinary warriors at the Holy Soul Realm or even the Chaotic Source Realm could destroy them.
<br><br>
But when the Snake Goddess's energy beams struck the ships, there was only a muffled sound, and the beams just bounced off the ships' surfaces.
<br><br>
The powerful energy beams had lost their desired effect. "In addition to the fact that my real bodies are the ships, I wonder what else you have found out?" the captain said from the ship.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess thought for a while before she asked hesitantly, "Have you integrated with the Land of Ancient Flesh?" The Land of Ancient Flesh was an immensely dangerous place.
<br><br>
It was quite a small land in the far south of the Three Purities Stage, but it was frightening and forbidden.
<br><br>
After all, its exterior was a large piece of flesh.
<br><br>
It also had a distinct feature. Any power could only work there once. The second and succeeding times, they would be ineffective.
<br><br>
Chapter 3856 In The Black Ship The Land of Ancient Flesh was a whole large chunk of flesh located in the far south of the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
Though no one knew who explored the Land of Ancient Flesh first, it could be assumed that it was easy to break into the place in the beginning.
<br><br>
However, after someone dug into the land once, no pure physical force could work on it anymore. Because of this, the very first mark on the ground could still be seen to this very day.
<br><br>
After one used fire to melt the Land of Ancient Flesh, they found that it would only successfully melt off a small piece. Since then, the Land of Ancient Flesh grew immune to the fire, and no longer feared any flames.
<br><br>
All of these failed attempts led to the conclusion that methods and attempts only worked once when used on the Land of Ancient Flesh.
<br><br>
This large chunk of flesh seemed to have developed this rare evolutionary ability, which worked very well to its advantage.
<br><br>
At this point, the Land of Ancient Flesh had endured so many attacks that it was basically unstoppable. The flesh feared nothing now.
<br><br>
Many people had attempted to break it, including the Snake Goddess and Fuxi and others. However, they failed to cause even a dent in the Land of Ancient Flesh.
<br><br>
Just now, the Snake Goddess used her shadow and corroded the body of the Black Ship's captain. The captain didn't dodge because he wanted to adapt to the energy beams from the shadow of Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
After the captain experienced the power of the beams, the shadow of Snake Goddess became an ineffective attack to the black ships.
<br><br>
It was in this moment that the Snake Goddess realized that this resistance possibly had something to do with the Land of Ancient Flesh.
<br><br>
Because of the flesh's extraordinary characteristic, many people attempted to obtain the land to use its powers. However, it was due to this evolutionary characteristic alone that no one succeeded.
<br><br>
In theory, the Land of Ancient Flesh could not be sliced, separated, much less be merged with anyone. If this was so, how did the captain of the Black Ship merge himself with such an incredible Other Shore Token? "You are quite smart to have understood it so quickly," the captain smirked, "Please do aboard the ship and stay there for a while."
<br><br>
As soon as the captain finished speaking, the black ship closest in proximity to the Snake Goddess suddenly swooped down in her direction.
<br><br>
Just then, Snake Goddess tapped her toes in the air and flew backward rapidly, her long dress flowing gracefully in the air along with her.
<br><br>
Normally, the Snake Goddess's speed should have been enough for her to escape, but the black ship suddenly produced a space fluctuation. Within a second, the Snake Goddess noticed the light dimmed around her, and she was already within the black ship.
<br><br>
It was a gloomy, quiet cabin and no matter how much the ship sped up, jolted or swayed, the people inside it were stable and unbothered.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
In an attempt to leave, the Snake Goddess tried to use the Grand Teleportation and exit.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the space channel appeared and opened up, it vanished just as quickly.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the captain of the Black Ship already had used the power of space to contain her earlier. Because the ship had evolved, the power of space was unusable inside it.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
Just then, the swords that hung on the wooden wall behind the Snake Goddess shook and vibrated. Suddenly, they shot up and pointed straight at her.
<br><br>
"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."
<br><br>
It was as if a hidden person controlled the short swords and aimed towards the Snake Goddess. Though the swords were short, they had immense power within them.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's body dodged and avoided the short swords. However, the nearby mast against the wall spun three hundred and sixty degrees and fell towards her.
<br><br>
Caught off guard, all the Snake Goddess could do was raise her arms to block it.
<br><br>
With a loud bang, she was sent right into a wall. When her body collided with the wall, numerous spears hovered at the end of the passageway, ready to shoot her.
<br><br>
It seemed that everything in the black ship was a part of the captain - and they were all more or less fatal.
<br><br>
Initially, Mahoney stood by and watched the fight from a distance.
<br><br>
However, when she saw that the Snake Goddess was devoured by the black ship, a feeling of apprehension slowly consumed her.
<br><br>
She had originally discussed with the captain of the Black Ship that they were going to join forces to deal with the Snake Goddess. As of the moment, this didn't seem like the case.
<br><br>
It suddenly occurred to her that she and the captain were on opposing sides.
<br><br>
A strong sense of urgency rose within her, but just as she was about to use the Grand Teleportation, a black ship swooped down and engulfed her within a few seconds.
<br><br>
Once the two warriors of the Eternal Realm were trapped, a third black ship descended towards Divine Farmer this time.
<br><br>
Since Fuxi and Yellow Thearch were still at war against one another, the captain figured that if he trapped the Divine Farmer, he could easily take Zen away.
<br><br>
For the captain, his plan was fool proof. This was going to be too easy.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Divine Farmer chased after the Invisible Ship with the Divine Farmer Ruler gripped in his hand.
<br><br>
At the same time, Edith concentrated on controlling the Invisible Ship to dodge Divine Farmer, but to no avail. Anywhere she went, Divine Farmer appeared right after.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
A few moments later, both the Invisible Ship and Divine Farmer appeared in the north corner of the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
Edith didn't have enough time to control the ship to dodge this time.
<br><br>
"Ghoul Substitute!"
<br><br>
Shera stretched out her arms and gripped hard, as if she held onto thin, invisible threads. All of a sudden, a huge monster that was made up of corpses hovered right above the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
The ghoul had cost Shera years to piece together, so it possessed extremely strong defensive power.
<br><br>
However, no matter how powerful a ghoul was, it would never be able to resist a single blow from Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
Just like that, the huge ghoul was sliced in half by the ruler, and it spewed green blood left and right.
<br><br>
As Shera saw her ghoul get killed in one strike, her eyes filled up with sadness. However, this did not mean the efforts were useless. Because the ghoul blocked the ruler, it gave Edith the window to teleport away.
<br><br>
"We can't go on like this. How about I go out and stop him? Edith, you must take everyone away," the brass man spoke out.
<br><br>
The people of the Black Ship were not naturally a united group in normal times. After all, they had already been tainted as evil in the Source World, and each one of them had done repulsive things in the past.
<br><br>
However, when it came to sacrifice and saving their members, they didn't hesitate at all.
<br><br>
After they lived on the Black Ship for so long, they eventually became a part of it.
<br><br>
"You can't stop him all by yourself," Shera snapped back.
<br><br>
"No, but at least I can buy you some time." Just then, the surface of the brass man's body turned yellow and solid like an iron wall. Without asking for any help, he prepared to sacrifice himself.
<br><br>
"Let's attack together. Let Edith take the red crystal to leave first," another creature spoke from not too far away. He was Vance, half human and half deer and a longtime member of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
"I agree." Shera nodded. "Even if we fight head on, we won't necessarily lose."
<br><br>
If the members of the Black Ship teamed up, they would have enough strength to put up against a warrior at the Eternal Realm. After all, it was not long ago that the Black Ship trapped the Thunder Dimorphodon with only four of them.
<br><br>
However, the strength of warriors at the Eternal Realm also varied in amount and energy. A warrior like Divine Farmer was obviously among the more powerful ones at the Eternal Realm. No one on the Black Ship was willing to face such a powerful existence unless it was an utmost necessity.
<br><br>
Left with absolutely no choice, they decided to fight Divine Farmer head-on and as a team.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the Invisible Ship moved through spatial transference again.
<br><br>
As usual, Divine Farmer appeared behind it like a taunting shadow. Once he slashed down with the ruler, the brass man was already out of the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
A light emerged from the brass man's body, and just like that, the aura of an Other Shore Token surged out from him.
<br><br>
At the same time, a huge brass pillar appeared in his right hand as he charged towards the sky! "Crack!"
<br><br>
With one attempt, the strike of Divine Farmer's ruler hit the brass pillar precisely. The brass pillar cracked right at the middle, and as if it was made out of soft mud, the crack trickled down all the way to the bottom of the pillar.
<br><br>
The Combat Dragon Pillar, which was the brass man's prized weapon, was destroyed in an instant.
<br><br>
Chapter 3857 Combat Dragon Absorb After Divine Farmer had destroyed the Combat Dragon Pillar with the ruler, he slashed at the brass man once more.
<br><br>
Just as his second strike was about to land on the brass man, a bandage suddenly wrapped around his arm.
<br><br>
At the other end of the bandage was the "bamboo pole".
<br><br>
The "bamboo pole" glowed with colorful light after the bandage unwrapped. In the Black Ship, the "bamboo pole" was the most proficient in using poison. Back then, when the first Usman appeared, he also relied on his fast-spreading "Flash Insect Poison" to make thousands of the provinces in the Source World turn red.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The "bamboo pole" then pulled the bandage and passed by the brass man and rushed towards Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
His whole body shone brightly and had turned into a semi-liquid state.
<br><br>
Under his skin was not flesh, but water.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the ruler slashed down and sank into the body of the "bamboo pole." In turn, the "bamboo pole" immediately softened and turned into a mass of sticky venom that spread out on Divine Farmer's arms! "Sizzle..."
<br><br>
As soon as the venom came into contact with Divine Farmer, his arms became pitch black. The black spread at an alarming speed, and in no time, it reached his forearms.
<br><br>
"You used poison on me? How naive of you!"
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer Ruler he held emitted a green light that rolled towards him. The light mildly surrounded his arms and turned them back to normal.
<br><br>
Then, the remaining green light followed the spreading venom.
<br><br>
In reality, the venom was the real body of the "bamboo pole". It was his trump card. It liquefied his form and turned it into a toxic liquid that he used to attack.
<br><br>
Although the "bamboo pole" hadn't reached the Eternal Realm, he was a much-experienced warrior in the Black Ship. He was ranked third on the Black Ship in terms of age.
<br><br>
He had liquefied himself into poison three times in the past. It took him a long time to recover every time he was liquefied, and the recovery process was painful. However, he was always successful in killing opponents who were very difficult to deal with, including a warrior at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
This time, however, his opponent was Divine Farmer! Furthermore, the ball of green light Divine Farmer used was fatal to him.
<br><br>
He immediately felt chills when he saw the green light. He wanted to escape, but it was too late. The green light had already entangled with the venom, then the venom neutralized and disappeared.
<br><br>
"Bane!"
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
When the real body of the "bamboo pole" got destroyed, two more warriors charged towards Divine Farmer from both sides.
<br><br>
The person on the left carried a huge saber, and his name was Alonzo, and the person on the right was Shera.
<br><br>
The two of them had a good relationship with the "bamboo pole", whose name was Bane. There was no way they weren't going to do anything when the green light from the Divine Farmer Ruler melted him! "Buzz!"
<br><br>
At that moment, a strange dark mark appeared on the surface of the great saber on Alonzo's back. Then, he lifted the saber and swung it at Divine Farmer's head.
<br><br>
The black saber radiance cut towards Divine Farmer with an irresistible and overpowering force.
<br><br>
Aside from the captain, the strongest one among the thirteen members of the Black Ship was probably Alonzo.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Eternal Realm was far too stronger than the Holy Soul Realm, especially when the warrior of the Eternal Realm was Divine Farmer, who had a powerful lifeblood weapon.
<br><br>
Alonzo's strike, which seemed to be able to chop the heaven and earth, only made a muffled sound when it touched the Divine Farmer Ruler. The black saber radiance disappeared. The strange mark on the great saber disintegrated, and so did the whole saber itself.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
After Divine Farmer blocked the attack, he slapped Alonzo with his ruler.
<br><br>
Bang! The strike landed squarely on Alonzo's head. Although he had Chaotic Source Spirits to protect him, even a single strike from a warrior like Divine Farmer contained over one hundred thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Thus, Alonzo's Chaotic Source Spirits quickly became exhausted, and at the same time, his head turned into a mass of blood.
<br><br>
Then, he turned into a headless corpse and fell.
<br><br>
"Alonzo!"
<br><br>
Shera's eyes turned dark red as she stretched out her hand and tried to grab Divine Farmer's head.
<br><br>
On the other and, Divine Farmer didn't even look at her. Instead, he raised his ruler.
<br><br>
"Da!"
<br><br>
However, Shera had grabbed the Divine Farmer Ruler! Divine Farmer didn't expect that the woman who reeked of corpses could resist his strike. In turn, he immediately tried to pull the ruler out of her hand.
<br><br>
Even then, Shera's white jade-like hand still tightly held on to the ruler like a pincer.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer was utterly shocked. "How could your hand have such power?" he asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
Ordinary people didn't smell Shera's stench. Or, maybe she didn't stink like that at first, but because she was always around the dead, she eventually smelled like them.
<br><br>
She was a mere cultivator at the Holy Soul Realm who strengthened her body to the point that she could fight a warrior in the Eternal Realm. It was indeed something that surprised Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
Just as Shera had bought more time, three more members of the Black Ship came over.
<br><br>
Of course, they wouldn't let such a fleeting opportunity pass by.
<br><br>
Then again, they were far too different when it came to strength. Moreover, the remaining members became chaotic and couldn't cooperate well anymore due to the deaths of Bane and Alonzo.
<br><br>
While that happened, Divine Farmer tapped Shera's head with his other hand to force her to retreat.
<br><br>
As Shera retreated, Divine Farmer had already pulled out the ruler, and the ruler whirled around his back.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! One of the three members of the Black Ship was cut into two at the waist, and the other two lost their arms.
<br><br>
Although they wouldn't die, they couldn't fight in a short time.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
When Divine Farmer had taken down several members of the Black Ship in a row, he flew towards the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
Inside the Invisible Ship was Edith, who was visibly anxious. No matter where she went, the Divine Farmer followed closely behind. What made it worse was that the other members of the Black Ship couldn't defeat him.
<br><br>
When panic was about to overtake her, the brass man appeared in the Invisible Ship again.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" she asked. She didn't know why the brass man returned.
<br><br>
The brass man did not answer and only stared fiercely at Zen's red crystal.
<br><br>
Then, he stretched both of his hands and put it on his shoulder.
<br><br>
"Combat Dragon Absorb!"
<br><br>
He roared, then his hands released a faint mist and fused him with the red crystal.
<br><br>
It turned out that the Combat Dragon Pillar that Divine Farmer had just broken was not an Other Shore Token, but a weapon that the captain of the Black Ship had made for him.
<br><br>
The brass man's Other Shore Token could combine his weapon and his body into one. He had always used the Combat Dragon Pillar to fight, and now Divine Farmer had destroyed it. Of course, it was hard to find a suitable weapon in a short time. Suddenly, he thought of the red crystal. So he placed it on his shoulder and merged it with his body.
<br><br>
Right after that, he left the Invisible Ship and rushed towards Divine Farmer! Now, the reason Divine Farmer had chased the Invisible Ship for so long was because of Zen.
<br><br>
The second he saw the brass man rush towards him, his face became unreadable.
<br><br>
The red crystal was undoubtedly a good material to use, but wouldn't that be giving him what he wanted by using Zen as a weapon and coming to him? Therefore, he didn't dodge and instead charged forward as well.
<br><br>
Once again, he used the Divine Farmer Ruler to slash through the air and swung it at the red crystal! "Bang!"
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
The first strike failed to shatter the red crystal, but the second strike finally broke it.
<br><br>
"Combat Dragon Absorb!"
<br><br>
White mist burst out from the brass man's hands.
<br><br>
Since the red crystal was damaged, he could no longer use it as a weapon.
<br><br>
Thus, he made up his mind. He took Zen's body inside the red crystal and merged with it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3858 A Good Weapon There was no way the brass man could think of anything else during this critical moment.
<br><br>
He knew that Zen was the crux of all these matters and was the reason for Divine Farmer's chase.
<br><br>
They wanted Zen for a specific purpose and until this purpose was fulfilled, there was no way they would harm him.
<br><br>
It was fortunate that the brass man's conjecture turned out to be true. Divine Farmer's frown was very obvious when he decided to use Zen as a weapon.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer, Yellow Thearch, and Mahoney all received the same order from the Element Spirit race: take advantage of Zen's inability to leave the Other Shore and capture him! Seeing the brass man carry Zen on his shoulders as he rushed towards him, Divine Farmer had no choice but to tilt his Divine Farmer Ruler to hit the brass man's head and avoid harming Zen.
<br><br>
Given his rich experience in combat, the brass man easily saw through his opponent's move. He ducked and swung Zen's body forward to use him as a shield! Determined to protect himself, the brass man raised Zen's body and smashed it towards the Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
In fear of hurting Zen, Divine Farmer chose to withdraw his ruler. In his haste, he did not have enough time to dodge the swipe heading towards him and could only take the force of the attack head-on! Bang! Zen's head directly slammed onto Divine Farmer's chest with a loud thud.
<br><br>
The impact was so strong and penetrated deep into Divine Farmer's chest, through his heart, and onto his spine.
<br><br>
This strong, penetrating force was the result of the brass man's theurgy: the Combat Dragon Power.
<br><br>
It did not just stop with the Divine Farmer's body, in fact, the same power erupted on several thousand feet of ground behind him. The amount of destruction caused by this theurgy was terrifying and could very well play a decisive effect in normal combat.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer's body trembled and the sharp pain he felt in his chest confirmed his injuries.
<br><br>
A murderous glint flashed through his eyes, furious that this brass man managed to deal such heavy damage to him. Divine Farmer quickly made a dash and came upon his opponent's back.
<br><br>
He raised his Divine Farmer Ruler and brought it down! Clatter! The surface of his weapon glowed an ominous dark green as numerous black carvings flowed through it.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer was good at detoxification but he was also considered an expert at weaponizing poison.
<br><br>
This Willow Green Poison, for example, was a unique concoction Divine Farmer himself created.
<br><br>
It was so potent that not even an Eternal Realm master could hope to survive it.
<br><br>
He did not normally use this on Holy Soul Realm opponents but the rage he felt from being hoodwinked by the brass man was enough to make him pull out all his cards.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for him, the brass man was also set to go all out in this fight.
<br><br>
Although Divine Farmer's agility was on par with his, all the brass man really needed to do was be fast enough to wield Zen as his shield.
<br><br>
As the poisonous ruler headed towards him, the brass man quickly brandished Zen as his primary defense. He didn't even need to turn around.
<br><br>
This counterattack was so sudden that Divine Farmer couldn't react in time.
<br><br>
He watched in horror as his Divine Farmer Ruler chopped down towards Zen's body and he was unable to stop it.
<br><br>
Bang! There was a loud, clanging sound as the weapon hit Zen's leg. Instead of going through the flesh, it was as if another weapon collided with the ruler.
<br><br>
The sound and sight shocked not only Divine Farmer and the brass man but the rest of the Black Ship's members.
<br><br>
There was no way the brass man expected Divine Farmer to hit Zen so carelessly.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Divine Farmer was at his wits' end in fear of Zen dying from his poison.
<br><br>
However, what astonished everyone was that Zen remained unharmed through this entire ordeal.
<br><br>
The attack dealt by Divine Farmer had at least one hundred thousand divine megatons of force! How in the world was Zen able to resist such a blow? Could it be that his Chaotic Source Spirits managed to absorb the attack and saved his life? Were his Chaotic Source Spirits truly so strong that they were able to resist one hundred thousand divine megatons of force? The exchange of blows boosted the brass man's confidence. It was basically a confirmation that he could choose to wield Zen as an invincible weapon, so he carried the man towards Divine Farmer. "Brothers of the Black Ship! Lend me a hand!"
<br><br>
Ready to answer his call, a member of the Black Ship stretched out his hand and patted the top of his skull where an Other Shore Token emerged. It was a black and withered branch.
<br><br>
"Withering Power!"
<br><br>
This was similar to the Latent Theurgy Zen once used to resist Elizabeth in the past! Another member of the Black Ship patted his chest and a small circular lens appeared. He quickly chucked it towards the brass man.
<br><br>
"Power Transfer Lens!"
<br><br>
Buzz! These two Other Shore Tokens worked well together: the Withering Power released by the black withered branch, that could increase one's strength sixfold, was reflected by the lens. The brass man could easily feel its effects rush through him.
<br><br>
Since the brass man was a power type warrior, his full strength could very well reach over fifty thousand divine megatons! Such formidable strength truly stood out among all Holy Soul Realm warriors and could easily reach the threshold of the Eternal Realm! However, with the use of Withering Power, his strength soared to three hundred thousand divine megatons! So long as these two other members of the Black Ship continued to assist him then the brass man could continuously unleash such frightening amounts of power.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A white mist began to emanate from the brass man's hand that held Zen's body. He felt really good considering the significant increase in his strength.
<br><br>
Though cooperation wasn't a strange concept to the Black Ship, this was the first time they used such a strategy against such a powerful being like Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Even Divine Farmer faltered in the face of this ferocious attack.
<br><br>
He fully intended to avoid this all-powerful force headed his way but he was also worried and wondered if Zen would be able to withstand the brass man's super-strength.
<br><br>
Before Divine Farmer could come up with a decision, another Black Ship member decided to intervene. It was Edith, the controller of the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
"Invisible Ship!" she commanded.
<br><br>
The Invisible Ship itself was an Other Shore Token. Although it was virtually useless in combat, it had other functions that could be put to good use.
<br><br>
"Space Imprisonment!" In times of need, the Invisible Ship could be used as an escape method or a way to trap enemies.
<br><br>
With Edith's command, the Invisible Ship instantly disassembled into countless, transparent space fragments that recombined into a space cage intended to trap Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
Given Divine Farmer's strength, it wouldn't be that difficult for him to break out of this space cage if he had the time, around twelve seconds to be exact.
<br><br>
However, when Edith trapped him inside, she also let the brass man in! Divine Farmer was essentially cornered! There was nowhere left he could run to escape the brass man's attack! A wicked grin flashed through his opponent's face. "Divine Farmer! Let's see if you can withstand this!" he shouted.
<br><br>
The brass man could feel the blood within his body boil as his mist-covered hands raised Zen's body and smashed it against Divine Farmer's head.
<br><br>
Left with no other choice, Divine Farmer slid his fingers across the Divine Farmer Ruler.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Green light flashed from the ruler and spread all throughout his body, like a blossoming willow.
<br><br>
Just as the light began to shine, Zen's head made contact with Divine Farmer's body.
<br><br>
Pop! Despite the harsh blow, Divine Farmer was unharmed.
<br><br>
However, his once indestructible Divine Farmer Ruler twisted so suddenly.
<br><br>
Pop! Determined to not give Divine Farmer any chance to recover, the brass man quickly smashed Zen down on him.
<br><br>
This second attack twisted the Divine Farmer Ruler even more and completely distorted its shape.
<br><br>
Pop! Upon the third smash, Divine Farmer fell back and smashed the space cage Edith trapped him in.
<br><br>
His weapon was now greatly distorted but at least he managed to withstand three, incredibly fatal attacks! Of course, the state of his Divine Farmer Ruler made his heart ache. It would take a long time to nurture his lifeblood weapon back into shape.
<br><br>
Still, Zen's unharmed state concerned him more. How in the world was the young man completely intact after enduring intense bouts of power? A look of regret flashed through the brass man's face when he realized that he had failed to subdue Divine Farmer. Just a few more smashes and he was certain to have ended him. It would take the brass man a few seconds to realize that the astonishment on Divine Farmer's face wasn't directed at him, but to Zen whom he wielded as a weapon.
<br><br>
'Well, I got to admit this boy's physical body makes for a good weapon, ' the brass man thought to himself.
<br><br>
Then he remembered that Zen withstood nearly three hundred thousand divine megatons of force but was barely injured.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before the brass man's face was the exact mirror of astonishment on Divine Farmer's.
<br><br>
Chapter 3859 The Growing Light Column In the far northwest of the Source World, there was a unique copper tree.
<br><br>
The roots of the tree reached deep into the ground. After growing for a long time, it was now able to extract a very special type of copper ore from the deep underground and absorb the ore into its core.
<br><br>
This copper was very flexible, and its raw form, which was viscous liquid, gave it the name "water copper".
<br><br>
The water copper could be cut with a knife easily.
<br><br>
But once a huge force came into contact with it, it would automatically become solid and extremely hard in an instant. All in all, instead of a type of ore, it could also be described as a kind of liquid with magical properties.
<br><br>
Based on these properties, the captain of the Black Ship finally built the Combat Dragon Pillar for the brass man.
<br><br>
The brass man had wanted to test the effect of the Combat Dragon Pillar before, so he used the Power Transfer Lens and the Withering Power to exert a force of nearly three hundred thousand divine megatons on the pillar. The result was satisfying for him—the pillar could take on the force easily.
<br><br>
Therefore, the stronger the force the Combat Dragon Pillar received, the stronger it'd become.
<br><br>
Had the brass man possessed three hundred thousand divine megatons of force before, Divine Farmer wouldn't have been able to cut the Combat Dragon Pillar.
<br><br>
But at that time, the brass man had only relied on his own strength when he used the Combat Dragon Absorb, so the Combat Dragon Pillar was naturally destroyed by Divine Farmer with a casual strike of his ruler.
<br><br>
Now, however, the brass man's weapon wasn't the "Combat Dragon Pillar"—his weapon now was a human's body.
<br><br>
Although Zen was basically an Eternal Realm warrior, a force of three hundred thousand divine megatons wasn't a laughing matter. Even a warrior like Zen would still have his body crushed if his body was struck by such a force! Everything the brass man did just now was done on the spur of the moment and without any further consideration at all. Now that he calmed down, he realized that what happened didn't at all make any sense.
<br><br>
On Zen's Three Purities Stone in the Grand Plain Stage, Zen's anchor bodies changed.
<br><br>
The force exerted on Zen's real physical body had been transmitted to his anchor bodies.
<br><br>
One's anchor body was connected to the Eternal Scroll Painting, and the Eternal Scroll Painting was connected to the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
When the force was transmitted to Zen's anchor bodies, an imperceptible wave of energy was also transmitted to the sacred cup in the Eternal Divine Courtyard at an unimaginable speed.
<br><br>
Pa! Zen's body shook. Consequently, even the entire sacred cup shook.
<br><br>
After the tiny ripples on the surface of the thick blood in the cup died out, the map in the circle of light on the ground began to change.
<br><br>
There were originally two light columns rising in the map. Each of them respectively represented the bloodline of Chiyou and the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God. These two light columns both had a life attribute, so they were in the lower left area.
<br><br>
However, after Zen took on the three hundred thousand divine megatons of force, another light column grew several inches tall in the fan-shaped area on the lower right side, the area which represented destruction! Complicated expressions appeared on the faces of the four bronze statues on the square.
<br><br>
It was already hard to believe that this guy was able to perform the Blood Merge Reconstruction.
<br><br>
Now, he also wasn't playing by the rules? Generally, even if a qualified person succeeded in obtaining the recognition of the ancestry-level bloodline, the shape of the map would be set in the shortest amount of time and wouldn't change again.
<br><br>
Zen had been lying motionless in the sacred cup for a long time, so why did the light column in the map grow again? This looked like he was cheating.
<br><br>
However, as long as there was a light column connected to the edge of the circle of light, it meant that he was acknowledged by the ancestry-level bloodline and also obtained the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
There were 373 light columns in total. How great the potential of the ancestry-level bloodline one merged with was would depend on how much potential the warriors in the sacred cup had and how many light columns they connected.
<br><br>
"Something seems wrong with the ancestry-level bloodline, don't you think?"
<br><br>
"If this light column can also reach the circle of light, then this kid will have three light columns connected to the circle of light..."
<br><br>
"The best record in the Eternal Divine Courtyard is fourteen light columns.
<br><br>
It happened a very long time ago, and unlike what he's doing now. The warrior, who made that record, made the fourteen light columns grow in one go…"
<br><br>
The four bronze statues were all staring at Zen. A faint trace of excitement was apparent in their eyes.
<br><br>
Their sense of duty made them wish that everything would go as usual, so when Zen first appeared, they were quite hostile to him.
<br><br>
At this moment, however, their thoughts had somewhat changed.
<br><br>
The Eternal Divine Courtyard had been abandoned for a long time...
<br><br>
Sealed by the Time Lock, what was left of the nearly eternal time might remain this way forever, and that would mean endless boring years for them.
<br><br>
Although no one said it out loud, deep in their hearts, they all hoped that something would break this stagnant eternal state. And now, this strange thing appeared.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer stared pensively at Zen, who was carried on the brass man's shoulder.
<br><br>
Even though he couldn't figure out what was going on, he now fully understood why the Element Spirit race wanted to win Zen over.
<br><br>
But he'd gone this far, so he didn't intend to give up.
<br><br>
With a slight wave of his right hand, the already twisted Divine Farmer Ruler was hidden inside his body.
<br><br>
Swoosh! A terrifying bloodline power was released from Divine Farmer's body. A split second later, a green, horned, bull-headed shadow appeared behind him.
<br><br>
The shadow let out a strange cry and disappeared in an instant. The moment it disappeared, it started materializing within Divine Farmer's body.
<br><br>
In addition to using their own bloodline to condense a lifeblood weapon, Eternal Realm warriors also had their own bloodline theurgies.
<br><br>
For example, the golden sword of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the Nine-Sun World Destruction of Emperor Charm were both their bloodline therugies.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer named his bloodline "Weird Blood". As one of the root-level bloodlines, the Weird Blood was extremely powerful, not at all inferior to the bloodline belonged to Yellow Thearch, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Emperor Charm, or other Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
However, very few people in the Source World had seen the bloodline theurgy of Divine Farmer because he very rarely used it.
<br><br>
The Weird Blood could transform him into three different mutants, which were all indestructible. During the transformation process, however, Divine Farmer's consciousness would be hazy. Moreover, the more he used his blood theurgy, the longer he would stay in his mutant form.
<br><br>
He was worried that one day, he might lose the ability to transform back to his original form and become a strange monster without wisdom, so he was very careful in using this bloodline theurgy of his.
<br><br>
In fact, he didn't want to use his bloodline theurgy in handling the members of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, upon seeing the strange characteristics of Zen's body, he felt the urgency to activate his blood theurgy.
<br><br>
His body began to lengthen, and two horns grew on his head. His feet also turned into a pair of strong hooves...
<br><br>
It was a mutant in the form of a goat monster... Divine Farmer's consciousness was gradually fading.
<br><br>
The goat monster was the most ferocious of his three mutant forms, but it was also the form that Divine Farmer hated the least.
<br><br>
The only thing that Divine Farmer could do to control this goat monster was to plant a purpose in his mind—he must take Zen back.
<br><br>
A second later, the consciousness in the goat monster's eyes completely disappeared. After a moment of haziness, it let out a strange howl.
<br><br>
The brass man standing not far away had been observing for a long time.
<br><br>
Seeing that the goat monster was still a little confused, he immediately carried Zen and smashed at the monster with Zen's body.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The strike still contained a force of three hundred thousand divine megatons.
<br><br>
While the goat monster was still howling, it was directly thrown down from the air, creating a huge crater in the ground.
<br><br>
However, the almost indestructible goat monster suffered no injury at all. It turned over, ran a few steps on the ground with both hands and feet, and pounced on the brass man.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
With Zen on his shoulder, the brass man once again smashed Zen towards the ground. He didn't believe that the mutant transformed from Divine Farmer wouldn't really be killed.
<br><br>
However, what the brass man didn't know was that every time he carried Zen and smashed him, the third light column in the area symbolizing destruction under the sacred cup in the Eternal Divine Courtyard would grow taller.
<br><br>
Chapter 3860 The Creation Quadrant The light pillar in the destruction quadrant continued to rise.
<br><br>
Soon, it touched the ring of light at the very edge of the map.
<br><br>
The four bronze statues all looked upon the cup.
<br><br>
Now that there were three light pillars, Zen was supposedly ready to wake up.
<br><br>
He obtained the ancestry-level bloodline so easily! Yet he remained lying motionless in the sacred cup.
<br><br>
The bronze statues had no clue that Zen was also confused.
<br><br>
As he lay in the darkness, he was positive that he was awake and not in a dream.
<br><br>
But he couldn't feel himself at all. At the very least, his sense of touch and smell had already left. He couldn't even perceive if he had a corporeal body —it seemed as though he was floating in the darkness as a mere lonely soul.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the soul's eyes and ears remained intact—Zen could see dots of light in the distance, as well as hear some sounds from his surroundings.
<br><br>
Murmurs rang in his ears every now and then. Each time a sound came through, the dots of light would spread out like dancing flies.
<br><br>
It seemed like there was someone chanting incantations… and the light dots were following the commands of said incantations.
<br><br>
Why was such a thing in his mind, Zen wondered? How long would the state last? He received no answer.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Source World… something explosive resounded.
<br><br>
A pit that could hold a great lake suddenly appeared—the brass man smashed into the ground.
<br><br>
At the bottom of the pit, as soon as the goat monster's body was exposed, it was thrown into the air and smacked back down by the brass man.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Another great pit appeared as the goat monster was once again smashed into the ground. Behind them, there were already over twenty lake-sized huge pits.
<br><br>
While the brass man's series of attacks caused no substantial damage to the goat monster, the latter was at least sufficiently suppressed enough so it had no strength to fight back.
<br><br>
But with each strike, the brass man released three hundred thousand divine megatons of force, enough that the other two Black Ship members could hardly bear it any longer.
<br><br>
The Withering Power and the Power Transfer Lens were both Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, but they consumed divine crystals rapidly.
<br><br>
At such a consumption rate, it was impractical to crumb divine crystals one after another to replenish the Other Shore Tokens. A single replenishment of such a level cost millions of divine crystals.
<br><br>
Even if the powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm were extremely agile, they couldn't possibly crush all the crystals one by one.
<br><br>
Before entering a battle, they usually prepared a space ring where they collected the many crushed divine crystals—this way, they could replenish their Other Shore Token with divine crystal energy during the battle.
<br><br>
But the brass man had used the force far too extravagantly.
<br><br>
Once the Black Ship members replenished divine crystal energy three consecutive times, the spare space ring was already empty.
<br><br>
"Shera!"
<br><br>
"Edith!"
<br><br>
The Black Ship members shifted their eyes to the two, pointing to them at the same time.
<br><br>
Both Shera and Edith immediately understood what they meant and instantly moved to the front of the two, giving them their spare space rings.
<br><br>
And so there was a break during the transfer.
<br><br>
The brass man was pouring his force into the goat monster's body through Zen, but there was now a sudden break in the force's steady stream.
<br><br>
As a result, the brass man attacked with only a few thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The goat monster struck a pose, ready to be thrown out again.
<br><br>
Suddenly, it found the impact on it far too gentle and weak.
<br><br>
It glared at the brass man in surprise.
<br><br>
When the man looked back at it, his eyes were filled with the same expression.
<br><br>
Realizing that the brass man lost his strength, its two horns began flashing green light before immediately lowering its head to push the man up with just its horns.
<br><br>
Each time the Divine Farmer turned into a goat monster, it would kill many people. With its ferocious personality, it refused to stop until it killed the brass man.
<br><br>
Seeing the horns rushing toward him, the brass man was so anxious that he lifted Zen up, using him as a shield to cover him.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer ordered the goat monster to take Zen back before his consciousness disappeared.
<br><br>
But the goat monster didn't seem to care one bit about what the Divine Farmer was thinking whatsoever. Instead, it rushed right at Zen's head.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
The collision's great impact sent both Zen and the brass man into the air.
<br><br>
Because of the "Combat Dragon Absorb", the brass man was still firmly gripping Zen when the latter once again displayed something miraculous— he was left completely unharmed from the goat monster's attack.
<br><br>
"Woo..."
<br><br>
After having taken quite many beatings from the brass man, the goat monster didn't care to show any mercy toward him now that it finally had its chance for revenge.
<br><br>
As its pair of strong and powerful rear legs made a leap, its sharp horns with green light pierced toward the brass man once again.
<br><br>
In terms of real strength, even powerful existences such as Fuxi and Yellow Thearch couldn't defeat the goat monster too easily—let alone the brass man who was only at the Holy Soul Realm.
<br><br>
Knowing that he couldn't defeat the goat monster, the brass man had no choice but to place his hopes on Zen, tightly placing him in front to serve as a shield.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
The goat monster then turned into a white shadow before attacking the brass man over and over. The brass man was like a matador, defending himself carefully with Zen, sweat dripping down his face. He couldn't help but rejoice when he saw how the goat monster was not all that intelligent.
<br><br>
Because of the goat monster's repeated attacks, another light pillar extended from the quadrant that represented "creation" at the bottom of the sacred cup—it was exactly the same as the one in the destruction quadrant, rising upward.
<br><br>
The four bronze statues believed Zen would stop. But they were left dumbfounded again in the face of the new light pillar.
<br><br>
"There was one in the destruction quadrant just now…but another one is popping out of the creation quadrant?"
<br><br>
"This light pillar can also reach consummation?"
<br><br>
"This is the fourth one, and the four light pillars exist in three different quadrants…"
<br><br>
All of them were speechless as they gazed at the extending light pillar.
<br><br>
The root-level bloodline that the Divine Farmer inherited was initially born from the creation quadrant.
<br><br>
The very fact that he had turned himself into a goat monster was a form of creation.
<br><br>
From its appearance, strength could be displayed in thousands of billions of forms, but in the map of the ancestry-level bloodline, strength would be simply divided into four great quadrants: destruction, creation, life, and space-time. Only small differences existed among the three hundred seventy-three light pillars that focused on various areas.
<br><br>
The goat monster's attacks directly helped Zen consummate a light pillar.
<br><br>
Once it launched over ten attacks in a single shot, the two Black Ship members finally replenished enough divine crystal energy.
<br><br>
When the Power Transfer Lens once again faced the brass man, his force surged once again.
<br><br>
Just as the brass man was ready to go against the monster again, a great black shadow suddenly shrouded them from above their heads, swallowing the goat monster with a bang.
<br><br>
It was a black ship that formed the great black shadow that descended—the captain's real body.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! A series of roars emerged from within the ship, but it wasn't broken. It was clear that the goat monster struggled to escape.
<br><br>
"Captain!"
<br><br>
The brass man only felt he had endless power to release.
<br><br>
"You can't kill it. It's an immortal body. Since you've obtained Zen, don't waste any time. Let's leave as soon as possible," the captain said when he reappeared on the deck like a ghost.
<br><br>
Chapter 3861 Unable To Leave This was the captain's style of doing things. He always completed tasks at minimum cost.
<br><br>
The other members of the Black Ship never doubted him. Even if the Divine Farmer killed a few of them, no one even thought of killing the Divine Farmer in revenge.
<br><br>
The Black Ship always took revenge, but they needed better timing. They believed that their captain would take care of it.
<br><br>
"But what about Usman?" Shera asked, her hair fluttering in the wind.
<br><br>
The mission would be completed when they were able to take Zen away with them.
<br><br>
But she hadn't forgotten the captain's another goal. If possible, he would summon the Evil God to swallow Usman.
<br><br>
This way, the Evil God would become stronger and gain some authority in the Source World.
<br><br>
"This is not the right time. We'll find another chance," said the captain.
<br><br>
Shera nodded wordlessly and entered Edith's Invisible Ship along with the other members of the Black Ship. In a flash, the Invisible Ship had reached the sky.
<br><br>
The captain's three black ships had trapped Mahoney, the Divine Farmer, and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Each black ship was a part of the captain's body, but they were parts that he could abandon.
<br><br>
The remaining black ships flew into the distance alongside the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! The Snake Goddess flew among the houses in one of the black ships.
<br><br>
The door of the cabin before her suddenly slammed shut and bumped violently into her.
<br><br>
A red light flashed at her fingertips, turning into a sharp claw light before she unleashed it at the door.
<br><br>
Crack! The door instantly cracked into pieces.
<br><br>
Blood flowed from the cracks of the door.
<br><br>
The black ship was made of flesh! "I don't think you have completely inherited the ability of the Land of Ancient Flesh," said the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
The power she had used was still bloodline power. Her lethality had greatly increased after she had fused her shadow into her real body.
<br><br>
She used the power of her shadow to open the door of the black ship.
<br><br>
If the captain really had occupied the Land of Ancient Flesh, he would be invincible, and the shadow of Snake Goddess wouldn't be able to cause any damage to the black ship.
<br><br>
"You are intelligent and your judgment is accurate, but I've already got Zen.
<br><br>
So it's goodbye."
<br><br>
The captain's voice echoed around the cabin.
<br><br>
A capstan in the black ship suddenly boomed. A huge square of wood smashed through several rooms and towards the Snake Goddess. It seemed to be the captain's heavy punch.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stretched out a hand and blocked the wood. She pinched it with her slender fingers, instantly turning it into dust.
<br><br>
"Do you really think you can leave?" she said calmly, dusting her hands.
<br><br>
"Why can't we?" the captain asked, tendrils of frustration lacing through his voice.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Yellow Thearch were engaged in a fierce battle, the others barely posing any threat. The captain was relaxed because he thought that no one could stop him.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess merely waved her arms around, causing her shadow to form innumerable energy beams that extended to different rooms. The energy beams were like densely packed ropes, and bound up the pillars and walls of the black ship.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's body then began to spin. Under the force of the energy beams, the black ship began to creak.
<br><br>
It was beginning to crumble from within.
<br><br>
The power of the Snake Goddess grew to a point where the black ship shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
The fragments of the ship rained down, along with the blood its structure contained.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stretched out a hand, causing an energy beam to sweep towards the falling fragments of the black ship and grabbed one of the planks.
<br><br>
The plank was colored slightly differently from the others. Its surface was golden, and it filled people with warmth as they held it.
<br><br>
"Why can't you leave? You'll know soon," the Snake Goddess said to the golden plank.
<br><br>
She then pinched the plank gently, crushing it and causing blood to spurt out of it.
<br><br>
Once the plank broke, the falling fragments of the black ship burst into flames.
<br><br>
If the Snake Goddess hadn't crushed the golden plank, the broken black ship would have recovered its original form in minutes. The black ship's power and ability to maintain its own shape came from the golden plank, which was a part of the captain's body.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the other black ships and the Invisible Ship were rapidly shuttling through the space channel.
<br><br>
At the speed they were moving, they could cross several big provinces in a short time.
<br><br>
The Source World was quite large. They'd be safe as long as they avoided the first round of tracking. It would not be easy to find the Black Ship.
<br><br>
"We've passed through three provinces. Are we safe now?" Edith asked.
<br><br>
Edith was nervous and had become more so when the captain had suddenly asked her to take everyone with her.
<br><br>
"As we have left the Separate Amber Province, they will never be able to find us. Edith, you've done a good job this time," said Shera, smiling.
<br><br>
"Thank you."
<br><br>
Edith stared ahead, concentrating on controlling the Invisible Ship. They were about to pass through a large province. She had to prepare the appropriate Sanskrit word to pass through the boundary wall.
<br><br>
They had just passed through the boundary wall when Edith's face froze.
<br><br>
She looked at the scene before her in a daze and said, "Shera! Captain! You need to look at this!"
<br><br>
Every member of the Black Ship turned to look, their expressions changing as one.
<br><br>
They were now in the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
Why had they come back? "That's impossible!"
<br><br>
"We have been heading west. This is impossible! We can't return to the Separate Amber Province!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship didn't know what was happening.
<br><br>
The captain in his black cloak thought hard. It was a moment before he said, "Someone has tampered with space. Even the Invisible Ship has gotten lost. We are trapped in here."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had warned him, and now, they were encountering this.
<br><br>
He knew exactly what was going on.
<br><br>
"How can someone do this to the space across so many provinces? I mean, who can do that?" the brass man asked.
<br><br>
He was still carrying Zen on his shoulder, unwilling to put down such a handy weapon.
<br><br>
"Ordinary warriors at the Eternal Realm may find it difficult to do," the captain said, his eyes serious. "But what if it is Othniel who has mastered the truth-level theurgy?"
<br><br>
Othniel was the Chaos Ancient God standing behind the Bearing race. If the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race wanted to ensure that everything was all right, they might ask Othniel to help them.
<br><br>
The Finale Way and the Purge Way both had Chaos Ancient Gods to support them, because there would always be a place for them to live no matter which way was completed.
<br><br>
This was exactly the Black Ship's disadvantage.
<br><br>
Their ultimate goal was to completely destroy the chaos and cause the Chaos Ancient Gods who had mastered the truth-level theurgies to disappear. This was why no Chaos Ancient God was willing to be their ally.
<br><br>
Chapter 3862 Gap Of Strength It was because of the Chaos Ancient Gods that the Black Ship had spent their days sailing endlessly, never settling down in the Source World.
<br><br>
The Chaos Ancient Gods didn't like the Black Ship, so they couldn't establish a stronghold in the Source World.
<br><br>
The six Chaos Ancient Gods had secretly been working behind the scenes.
<br><br>
"How powerful will Othniel's control over the space be?" Edith asked, eyes wide with astonishment.
<br><br>
She had once been told by the captain of the Black Ship that she was probably the most talented person in the Source World in terms of manipulating space.
<br><br>
However, even she paled in comparison to the Chaos Ancient God, who had mastered the space truth.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid we're about to find out," the captain said gravely.
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances, the Black Ship never cowered away from battling other super forces.
<br><br>
However, when faced with the Chaos Ancient Gods themselves, even the Black Ship knew this would be quite the challenge.
<br><br>
They had been lucky enough to avoid the Chaos Ancient Gods in the past, but this time, it seemed there was no way out of this.
<br><br>
"Should we summon him?" Shera suddenly asked.
<br><br>
"Of course," said the captain, squinting. Apparently, he had been well prepared.
<br><br>
Boom! A huge hole ripped through the bottom of a black ship, from which Mahoney emerged.
<br><br>
Rage flashed in her eyes as she scanned her surroundings, searching for her prey. She had wanted to join hands with the captain of the Black Ship to fight against the Snake Goddess, yet he double-crossed her and imprisoned her on a black ship! While it had taken her a great deal of effort to get out, all she wanted to do now was seek revenge.
<br><br>
Mahoney activated her spiritual sense, and soon she found another black ship nearby.
<br><br>
Tearing through space once more, she teleported to the next black ship in a single breath. "Captain," she smiled. "Don't blame me for what happens next!"
<br><br>
Swoosh! A formidable energy wave emanated from Mahoney's body. Immense divine megatons of force formed a ring around her as she threw a punch towards the black ship.
<br><br>
Just as her fist connected with the hull of the ship, she heard a loud thud coming from within it.
<br><br>
Boom! Apparently, this black ship also contained a prisoner — the goat monster that the Divine Farmer had transformed into.
<br><br>
Even if it had more power than the Snake Goddess, it couldn't match her intelligence. It hadn't been able to escape the black ship till then.
<br><br>
Now, as Mahoney and the goat monster smashed the hull from both inside and outside at the same time, the black ship broke into pieces under their joint efforts.
<br><br>
Crash! As the black ship collapsed before her, Mahoney drew her fist back to throw another punch, thinking the person on the ship was its captain.
<br><br>
To her astonishment, it turned out to be a goat monster! The goat monster was in a state of rage when it emerged from its prison.
<br><br>
Seeing someone about to attack it, it didn't hesitate to strike back.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer's original consciousness was buried deep; the goat monster practically had a mind of its own. Unfortunately for Mahoney, it couldn't see that she was actually an ally.
<br><br>
Boom! Though exceptionally good at melee combat, Mahoney was at a distinct disadvantage when faced with this invincible goat monster.
<br><br>
Before she could even throw her punch, the goat monster rammed right into her. Countless cracks appeared on her armor.
<br><br>
"You...!"
<br><br>
Mahoney was stunned for a moment before she recognized her opponent. It was the goat monster that Divine Farmer transformed into using his bloodline power! "Wait!" she cried as the goat monster smashed its sturdy hoof on Mahoney's chest, knocking the breath out of her.
<br><br>
Crack! The armor on her chest shattered instantly, and the impact caused her to fall to the ground like a meteor.
<br><br>
"Divine Farmer, stop it..."
<br><br>
Mahoney pleaded weakly, but the goat monster wouldn't listen to reason.
<br><br>
Without giving her time to breathe, it thrust at her with its sharp horns.
<br><br>
Mahoney felt immense fear. How miserable it would be to be killed by an ally! As soon as she crashed into the ground, she jumped to her feet and tried to escape into the distance, like a streak of lightning.
<br><br>
Mahoney flew very fast, but the goat monster was even faster. Bleating angrily, the goat monster gave chase.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Yellow Thearch was also preoccupied, running as fast as he could along the boundary wall.
<br><br>
Behind him, numerous marks of Eight Diagrams kept appearing on the boundary wall.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! As the marks exploded, they formed huge holes on the boundary wall, as if an invisible giant beast had sunk its teeth into it.
<br><br>
If Yellow Thearch dared slow down, he risked having a mark of Eight Diagrams catch up to him.
<br><br>
Once that happened, the punches would follow.
<br><br>
The instant a mark of Eight Diagrams landed on Yellow Thearch's body, a fist radiance already exploded on him all at once.
<br><br>
In his peak state, Fuxi was a force to be reckoned with. Even a single strike from him could pose a huge threat to any Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Slowly but surely, he forced the Yellow Thearch to a dead end.
<br><br>
Bang! Before Yellow Thearch could figure out what to do next, the fist radiance and the mark of Eight Diagrams exploded on his body.
<br><br>
The power in those moves was so destructive that it rampaged within his body.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch slammed heavily into the boundary wall. Spitting out a mouthful of blood, his face paled as his body weakened rapidly.
<br><br>
He knew he couldn't defeat Fuxi, but he never thought it would end so miserably.
<br><br>
"How did you make such a rapid progress with your strength?" Yellow Thearch looked at Fuxi piteously, his tone full of mixed emotions.
<br><br>
Fuxi floated in the air, looking down at the Yellow Thearch. "I'm not really fast in my cultivation." A sly smile crept on his face. "Instead, you're too slow. After you joined the Element Spirit race, you unconsciously slacked off on cultivation. How much do you know about the Three Purities Stage?"
<br><br>
Some time ago, Fuxi, Yellow Thearch, and Divine Farmer were all roughly on the same level of strength. Back then, it never would've crossed Fuxi's mind that he would defeat Yellow Thearch with ease.
<br><br>
However, after reaching the Eternal Realm, Yellow Thearch and the others had grown lax under the protection of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
The resources granted to them by the Element Spirit race had indeed helped them improve by leaps and bounds over a certain period of time. However, this meant their activities were limited.
<br><br>
They couldn't explore the areas that the Element Spirit race forbade them from entering.
<br><br>
So, while they might have been protected, they also had little room for exploration and growth.
<br><br>
On the other hand, things were different for Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
They had to take huge risks every step of the way in Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Even if the Element Spirit Civilization controlled the 'exit' for Stage Thirtythree, even they hadn't completely explored every nook and cranny of the stage. There were still a large number of areas that remained a mystery to them.
<br><br>
Fuxi couldn't count how many times he'd risked his life to explore new areas. However, he had grown stronger each time.
<br><br>
It was because he had chosen to take the rougher path that he had grown stronger than the other masters at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch stared at Fuxi wordlessly, unable to come up with a response.
<br><br>
Admittedly, he was jealous of Fuxi's great power. If he had known things would turn out like this, he might have made different choices.
<br><br>
But it was too late for regrets. This was the path he had chosen.
<br><br>
After a moment of silence, Yellow Thearch suddenly smiled. With a crazed look in his eyes, he threw his head back and laughed. "Do you really think you've won this war?"
<br><br>
Fuxi clenched his fist. "At least... I've won against you."
<br><br>
A mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on Yellow Thearch's body, and Fuxi threw out another incredibly powerful punch.
<br><br>
Boom! The earth-splitting power of the punch exploded on Yellow Thearch's body.
<br><br>
However, as the dust cleared, Yellow Thearch still leaned quietly against the boundary wall, unscathed. There was an invisible space in front of him which had blocked the blow completely.
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes narrowed in realization. Angrily, he whipped his head upwards to look to the sky.
<br><br>
There was only one person in the entire chaos who would be able to control space this way — Othniel, one of the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
Something in Fuxi's eyes began to burn like crazy.
<br><br>
There was a huge gap of strength between an Eternal Realm master and the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
Still, even when he was imprisoned at the bottom of the chaos, Fuxi had always wondered if he was capable of killing a Chaos Ancient God...
<br><br>
Chapter 3863 A Huge Figure Back then, Fuxi had challenged Gerald, but he failed. In turn, Gerald had taught him a hard lesson.
<br><br>
What made it more impressive for Gerald was that even though he was in a bad situation at that time, he was still able to defeat Fuxi.
<br><br>
However, Fuxi had never accepted his fate. He went on to find ways to suppress the truth on the Other Shore since it was at a higher level than the chaos in some way.
<br><br>
That was why when he felt the space truth's suppressive power, an immensely strong fighting intent filled his heart.
<br><br>
"You want to take all my powers by just folding the space?" he sneered.
<br><br>
Then, his arm swelled up, and he released his strength once more.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! A mark of the Eight Diagrams and fist radiance exploded in front of Yellow Thearch, but it didn't have any impact on him at all. It was as if they were in two separate worlds.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch leaned against the boundary wall with an arrogant smile and mocked Fuxi's fruitless efforts.
<br><br>
He calmly stood up and casually reached out his hand. The Yellow Thearch Sword suddenly appeared on his palm.
<br><br>
Upon closer look, it appeared that the surrounding space was a little distorted as Yellow Thearch moved. It turned out that he was isolated in another space.
<br><br>
Swish! Yellow Thearch gently waved his sword and leisurely walked towards Fuxi step by step.
<br><br>
Buzz! With a slight buzzing sound, a holy way with intense killing intent slashed towards Fuxi's head.
<br><br>
In return, Fuxi punched the incoming attack.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Surprisingly, he missed, and his punch went past the holy way. They were in separate spaces that did not intersect.
<br><br>
Boom! On the contrary, Yellow Thearch's sword attack hit Fuxi accurately! Fuxi had restrained Yellow Thearch before, but that didn't mean that the latter was weak.
<br><br>
There was a muffled sound, and then Fuxi fell to the ground.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch raised his sword, and he looked calm again. Suddenly, he launched another sword attack! His spiritual sense flowed through as he swung his sword again.
<br><br>
Splash! A large cut immediately appeared on the ground, but Fuxi already dodged it using the Grand Teleportation technique.
<br><br>
"How can you escape under Othniel's gaze?" The voice of Yellow Thearch boomed from all directions.
<br><br>
At that moment, he seemed to have heard something and waved his sword towards that direction.
<br><br>
As the holy way advanced, a passage opened up in the space in front of him, and Fuxi emerged out of it! Boom! The holy way hit Fuxi again! After all, the Chaos Ancient God understood the space much better than Fuxi did. Fuxi had changed the space channel by using the Grand Teleportation technique, but Othniel pulled him back and the sword strike hit him again! Even though Fuxi's body was powerful, he could not withstand two sword strikes from Yellow Thearch in a row.
<br><br>
He spat a mouthful of blood and chose not to use the Grand Teleportation technique. Instead, he flew straight into the distance.
<br><br>
However, Yellow Thearch wasn't in a hurry to chase after him. He even playfully watched Fuxi as if the latter was a domesticated pet. There seemed to be an invisible transparent cover in front of Fuxi. Fuxi couldn't jump out of it, so he would have to return to the starting point.
<br><br>
"No matter how powerful you are, you are still at the Eternal Realm. You can't fight against the truth."
<br><br>
Once again, Yellow Thearch paced in the air as he slowly moved with his sword in one hand. Meanwhile, the accumulated power of the holy way in his sword became more and more intense.
<br><br>
If everything went well, Yellow Thearch hoped to kill Fuxi himself—he didn't want to bother Othniel to aid him.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the Chaos Ancient Gods were the foundation of the chaos. Once they participated in the mortal battles, the situation would become quite complicated.
<br><br>
According to Yellow Thearch's plan, they were supposed to abduct Zen while they helped Usman increase his strength. If they successfully executed both, then the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race would be forever invincible! However, things didn't go smoothly. Now that Othniel was directly involved in the battle, they might have to do everything in advance before they made full preparations.
<br><br>
But no matter what, he was already invincible because Othniel coated him with a layer of space membrane.
<br><br>
Swish! Yellow Thearch slashed Fuxi with his sword once more, and Fuxi dodged it using his fast speed instead of the spatial transference.
<br><br>
Although he successfully evaded one strike, he couldn't dodge all the follow-up strikes.
<br><br>
In only a short amount of time, Fuxi acquired several horrible wounds, and half of his face had gotten disfigured. He looked miserable.
<br><br>
"So much for that!"
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch's eyes glinted coldly, and then three more holy ways gathered on his sword.
<br><br>
For him, Fuxi was just like an immovable target. If he couldn't even deal with Fuxi in this situation, he would be worthless.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
As his sword, which contained three holy ways sounded, innumerable sword shadows flew towards Fuxi at full speed.
<br><br>
Just when he thought that Fuxi was powerless now, the latter's aura suddenly changed.
<br><br>
A bright green beam of light lit up his eyes, as if an immensely powerful life force was infused into his body. All of his severe wounds healed in a second.
<br><br>
The green light only lasted for a while, and then it turned red. His aura also became quite aggressive.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In the next moment, he swiftly pounced on Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
Even if Yellow Thearch had the protection of the space membrane, a chill ran down his spine.
<br><br>
Instead of swinging his sword to fight back, he instinctively dodged and retreated.
<br><br>
Crack! The space membrane that covered him exploded, and then his left arm was ripped off by Fuxi.
<br><br>
Still, his decision to retreat saved his life. Had he relied on the space membrane and counterattacked, Fuxi could've killed him.
<br><br>
He pulled a long face once he had landed far away. He also looked up at the sky like Fuxi did before. What he had been worried about really happenedanother Chaos Ancient God had a hand in their affair.
<br><br>
Just then, a giant scorpion shadow appeared in the Separate Amber Province and other hundreds of provinces, including the Bloom Divine Province and the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Many creatures raised their heads to look at the enormous scorpion, and all of them had mixed feelings: first was that they felt deeply attached to the scorpion, and second was they also feared it, as if it would destroy them right then and there.
<br><br>
Gerald was the Chaos Ancient God who controlled the truth of life. In the early days of the Source World, Gerald could interfere with the cycle of life and even create creatures. Therefore, it was safe to say that all living creatures in the current chaos originated from him.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he was the ruler of all living creatures. Not only could he create lives, but he could destroy them too.
<br><br>
As soon as Gerald's figure appeared, another enormous figure also emerged on the other side. It was a gigantic one-eyed monster with a strange stooping body.
<br><br>
It was none other than Othniel, who had coated Yellow Thearch with a layer of space membrane.
<br><br>
"Haven't you figured it out yet?" Othniel's voice echoed throughout the hundreds of provinces.
<br><br>
The Chaos Ancient Gods also had their stands.
<br><br>
From their perspective, the Purge Way was clearly in line with their interests. That was why Othniel was willing to help Yellow Thearch.
<br><br>
Despite that, Othniel didn't want to fight with Gerald. They both came from the last chaotic era, and although they belonged to different races, their races got along well with each other at that time.
<br><br>
Therefore, he still tried to persuade Gerald to stand with him even now.

Suddenly, Gerald's eyes lit up with a green light.
<br><br>
Buzz! In the Invisible Ship, a small dot of green light flew out of Zen's body. It was no other than No. 9527, a soul fragment of Gerald.
<br><br>
Back then, Gerald had been optimistic about Zen. Now, he wanted to know if he had made the right choice.
<br><br>
As the others of the Black Ship watched the green dot of light float out of the Invisible Ship, no one dared stop it.
<br><br>
Although No. 9527 was just a weak soul fragment, the aura it emanated was the same as that of Gerald.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The green light dot rose steadily, soaring through the sky until it shot into Gerald's forehead.
<br><br>
In Gerald's mind, he was surrounded in the middle by many brain masters, like a human emperor, awaiting No. 9527's arrival.
<br><br>
When the green dot of light entered Gerald's head, No. 9527 emerged and stood in front of its master. Suddenly, No. 9527 did a very human thing: it bowed towards its master.
<br><br>
"You are me," the master said confusedly. "Why do you use such etiquette with your own self?" No. 9527 remained silent. Gerald thought for a moment, then finally said, "You've been gone for a long time. Have you grown attached to your own consciousness?"
<br><br>
To some extent, the soul fragment was also an independent individual.
<br><br>
After being with Zen for so long, No. 9527 had gradually developed its own personality.
<br><br>
It even didn't want to go back to its master. In its own way, it wanted to be a special No. 9527, not just a soul fragment.
<br><br>
"Yes, Master," No. 9527 replied sincerely. "I... I want to leave you. For good."
<br><br>
As soon as No. 9527 spoke this, the brain masters surrounding Gerald broke into indignant chaos.
<br><br>
How dare a mere soul fragment ask to break away from its master's consciousness? In the brain world, this was an absolutely outrageous act. It was impossible for brain masters and soul fragments to be this individualistic! "You have made a great contribution and successfully assisted Zen to the Eternal Realm. Spread yourself out before me," Gerald ordered. "Once I understand what has happened to you during this period of time, I can allow you to leave."
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, No. 9527 spread out itself.
<br><br>
Countless fragments were instantly deciphered by Gerald. From Zen's journey to the Source World, to the scenes of his encounters on the Other Shore, all of them were laid out before him.
<br><br>
At the beginning, Gerald was grateful to see how No. 9527 was of great help to Zen.
<br><br>
Although Zen on his own was extraordinary, with the help of No. 9527, he was able to reach greater heights.
<br><br>
However, as Gerald kept absorbing, he noticed that as Zen advanced on the Other Shore, he no longer needed No. 9527 as much. So much so, that at some point, No. 9527 was practically negligible. Later, with the appearance of the Regal Jade Spirit and the Primeval Lord of Heaven, No. 9527 paled in comparison.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Gerald was astonished to see what Zen had been through.
<br><br>
When Zen replaced the Element Spirit race to control the Blooming Jade Stage, he felt even more shocked.
<br><br>
However, just as he felt like he couldn't be any more impressed, he reached the part where Zen entered the Eternal Scroll Painting. He became more stunned! Although No. 9527 had kept silent and did not disturb Zen when Zen was in the painting, it roughly understood the communication between Zen and the Primeval Lord of Heaven.
<br><br>
Through No. 9527, Gerald had seen the center of the scroll painting, and known about the Four Spirits Sect, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's guesses.
<br><br>
All this happened in the span of seconds. In the blink of an eye, Gerald had fully understood what No. 9527 and Zen had been through together. He gently shut his huge eyes, and then opened them again slowly, as he felt conflicting emotions rage within him.
<br><br>
Zen's performance was completely beyond his expectations, and even beyond his imagination...
<br><br>
Previously, Gerald had been a little hesitant, but at this moment, he no longer had any misgivings.
<br><br>
"I understand now," Gerald's voice rang out in the air, and it was easily transmitted to the ears of all the creatures from over a hundred provinces, sounding very peaceful. "Let go of Zen and retreat. Then we can forget what happened today."
<br><br>
Hearing the choice of Gerald, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess immediately heaved a sigh of relief, while Yellow Thearch and the others looked on coldly.
<br><br>
On the other side of the sky, Othniel said, "You still haven't figured out that in this world, we are..."
<br><br>
But Gerald interrupted his persuasion directly. "Not another word. I've seen more than you know. I won't believe their words anymore."
<br><br>
Buzz! A blue light flashed across Othniel's one huge eye.
<br><br>
Instantly, his aura became menacingly strong.
<br><br>
"You really want to fight with me?" Othniel asked once more.
<br><br>
"I have only one condition," Gerald replied decisively. "Let go of Zen."
<br><br>
Just from studying No. 9527's memories, he had fully realized Zen's importance to this world. His value was so great, and Gerald was willing to sacrifice his life if it meant keeping Zen alive.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
Othniel's single eye shook wildly.
<br><br>
The concentrated power of space shook crazily in his eye.
<br><br>
Othniel had the highest space authority in the chaos. Now that he couldn't reach a consensus with Gerald, he planned to exile him.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Gerald was well aware of how great Othniel's power was. However, there was no way he was going to allow Othniel to exile him easily.
<br><br>
Putting aside the Deleting Space, even if Gerald was only exiled into a corner of the chaos, it would still take him time to return to the Source World.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! As Gerald spurted toward Otheniel, invisible space walls appeared and blocked his way.
<br><br>
Each space wall was as strong as the boundary wall, but to Gerald, they were as fragile as glass. With ease, Gerald smashed each of them at a touch...
<br><br>
Even though the space walls did no real damage to Gerald, it did slow him down momentarily.
<br><br>
Before Gerald even had the chance to attack Othniel, Othniel's eye had already gathered enough space power. Without hesitating, he shot a thick blue light onto Gerald's body.
<br><br>
Once the blue light disappeared, so did Gerald.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha-ha..."
<br><br>
Othniel's laughter roared throughout the skies.
<br><br>
Then, he shrank his body, from a huge god-like scale to that of a human.
<br><br>
His appearance also transformed into that of Mount. This was the complete Mount.
<br><br>
Next, Othniel appeared beside Yellow Thearch, and pulled at the air in front of him.
<br><br>
Suddenly, space itself seemed to warp and distort all over the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
He had pulled the important figures to his side.
<br><br>
They included the Divine Farmer, who was currently a goat monster, Mahoney, the members of the Black Ship, and the Snake Goddess...
<br><br>
They didn't see this coming. As space itself seemed to fold before them, they hadn't reacted before Othniel pulled them towards him.
<br><br>
Then, Othniel stared at Zen as he saw through the Invisible Ship. He felt as though he had stumbled upon an invaluable treasure. Stretching out his hand, he wanted to pull Zen towards him, too.
<br><br>
However, even under his pull, Zen remained unmoved.
<br><br>
His invincible space truth had no effect at this moment! Chapter 3865 The Descending Man In Black The captain of the Black Ship, Shera, and the others also stared at the brass man, feeling quite confounded.
<br><br>
The brass man shrugged his shoulders while carrying Zen to show that he had no understanding of the situation...
<br><br>
The Chaos Ancient God was unable to retrieve someone from a Holy Soul Realm warrior. Even Othniel's expression became quite unnatural.
<br><br>
Othniel reached out his hand towards the brass man again, and the irregular power of space folded around Zen. However, when the power of space was applied to Zen, it vanished without a trace.
<br><br>
Zen had become like a black hole in the shape of his body. He could absorb all forms of power.
<br><br>
After failing twice in a row, Othniel finally relented and quit. His figure flashed, and he came to the Invisible Ship. He glanced at the captain and then reached out his hand to grab hold of Zen.
<br><br>
The brass man looked at the captain in a mute appeal for help. Given the situation, if the captain did not make a move, the brass man would not take action either.
<br><br>
As Othniel's hand grabbed out, the white fog created by the brass man's Combat Dragon Absorb began to thin and dissipate, and Zen was taken away by Othniel.
<br><br>
Before leaving, Othniel glanced back at Edith and flippantly commented, "This space ship is very exquisite. It will make a fine tomb for you..."
<br><br>
Once Othniel finished speaking, his figure disappeared, and he reappeared beside Yellow Thearch still holding onto Zen.
<br><br>
After they had left, Edith suddenly sensed trouble brewing and exclaimed in a state of panic, "Captain, I can't control the Invisible Ship..."
<br><br>
The Invisible Ship was Edith's Other Shore Token, but now it was no longer under her control.
<br><br>
"Your Other Shore Token is out of control?" Shera arched her eyebrows.
<br><br>
"Yes..."
<br><br>
Edith stared at the transparent Invisible Ship in horror. "The Invisible Ship is shrinking!"
<br><br>
The Invisible Ship, which was thousands of feet in size, had steadily begun shrinking. In less than nine seconds, it had already shrunk by half. The people of the Black Ship, who were in the cabin, would soon be squashed by the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship used their Grand Teleportation technique at the same time, trying to teleport from the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
However, the instant they used this technique to escape, they were surprised, and their expressions filled with fear. There was no fluctuation in the space. It must be Othniel's ploy to have trapped them here using some skill.
<br><br>
It would be a small feat for the Chaos Ancient God, who was in charge of the space truth, to trap them! "Captain!"
<br><br>
"What should we do?"
<br><br>
"We are trapped here!"
<br><br>
While the crowd panicked, the Invisible Ship had shrunk to the size of ten feet, and there was only one shoulder width on the left side and the right side. Tomos from the Ear Mouse race and Shera could still fit in the small ship, but the ship was not large enough to accommodate the tall and strong brass man.
<br><br>
The brass man stretched out his hands, trying to push the Invisible Ship outwards and stop it from shrinking more.
<br><br>
However, he had used almost all of his strength, yet he couldn't stop the Invisible Ship's shrinking even an inch.
<br><br>
The power which was shrinking the space was not something the brass man could oppose. The bones in his body creaked loudly, and his face turned cherry red.
<br><br>
Crack, crack, crack...
<br><br>
An explosive sound emanated from the brass man's chest, and the bones of his arms suddenly broke completely off! Meanwhile, other members of the Black Ship, such as Shera and Edith, had also joined hands to stop the ship from shrinking. However, even though all the members of the Black Ship took action, the Invisible Ship continued shrinking at the original speed.
<br><br>
After a short while, they could no longer even turn around. If the ship continued to shrink, they would all be squeezed to a pulp! Then Shera craned her neck to look at the captain. It would be too late if they didn't summon that man now.
<br><br>
Just as Shera was becoming desperate, a golden circle of light suddenly appeared behind the captain. Within the golden circle of light stood a man in a black robe. The man had a pair of deep eyes, and their depths seemed to be filled with stories and secrets. The faint stubble on his chin hinted at an unruly character.
<br><br>
"Do you need any help?"
<br><br>
Crack! He stretched out his feet and kicked up against the transparent wall of the Invisible Ship. It seemed unnervingly easy for him to do that. The ship shook violently and stopped shrinking.
<br><br>
As the man began exerting his strength on the Invisible Ship, the unbreakable space barrier around the ship shattered into thousands of pieces with a bang.
<br><br>
He gently hitched up his robe and flew upwards like a black goshawk. At the same time, a rumbling sound echoed from the sky. A terrifying energy quietly swept past and then disappeared without a trace. This was the punishment of truth that could not descend.
<br><br>
Othniel didn't think the members of the Black Ship would ever escape. In his mind, it was inconceivable they would be able to escape from the Invisible Ship.
<br><br>
After he had dealt with the Black Ship, there were only two targets of the Pear Hill remaining.
<br><br>
Since he made his move, he would not let any of his targets escape.
<br><br>
But moments after he left the ship, he felt a huge movement coming from behind him.
<br><br>
Othniel turned around and saw the man in black. His cold eyes flashed a trace of seriousness.
<br><br>
In the chaos, even the strongest Eternal Realm warrior couldn't oppose the Chaos Ancient Gods who controlled the truth. Therefore, even Fuxi and the Black Ship had not been taken seriously by Othniel. At least, Othniel felt that these Eternal Realm warriors posed no threat to him.
<br><br>
However, the man in black who had now appeared made Othniel feel an instinctive vigilance. This vigilance only happened when he was facing other Chaos Ancient Gods. He didn't expect that he would have such a feeling when facing a mere human, and this left him feeling a little confused.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, who had been pulled here by Othniel, quietly exchanged nervous looks.
<br><br>
Of course, they knew that the man in black had descended from the Other Shore and must be a member of the Nihility race. However, the members of the Nihility race always took mysterious and unpredictable actions, and they were unable to determine the man in black's identity.
<br><br>
In fact, not long ago, the man in black had appeared in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. If Pearce had been present, he would have been able to recognize him.
<br><br>
However, if the Nihility race could duel Othniel to the death, Fuxi and the others would celebrate seeing it.
<br><br>
"Who are you?" asked Othniel.
<br><br>
The man in black sniffed the air, revealing some enjoyment on his face.
<br><br>
"I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time. Even though more than a thousand chaotic eras have passed, the scent of this world still hasn't changed,"
<br><br>
the man in black said without answering Othniel's question. Othniel's face darkened, and he asked in a low voice, "Tell me who you are!"
<br><br>
As he spoke, he suddenly lashed out at the man in black, and a crescentshaped space crack hurtled straight towards the man in black. The space crack that the Chaos Ancient God had so casually created was extremely lethal.
<br><br>
Facing the space crack, the man in black smiled faintly and extended his palm to block the crack as if swatting a fly.
<br><br>
Sizzle...
<br><br>
When the man's palm met the space crack, a grating noise sounded, and the space crack disintegrated.
<br><br>
Then his lips formed a warm smile. "It doesn't matter who I am. The most important thing is that man. You have to hand him over to me,"
<br><br>
the man in black said, pointing at Zen, who was draped over Othniel's shoulder.
<br><br>
"Not in your wildest dreams," responded Othniel.
<br><br>
If it weren't for the fact that Zen was able to absorb all the energy and couldn't be transported away, Othniel would have hidden Zen in a corner of the chaos as he had done to Gerald.
<br><br>
If Othniel had done so, it wouldn't matter how strong the man in black was.
<br><br>
Finding a human in the vast chaos was like looking for a needle in a haystack.
<br><br>
Chapter 3866 Blind Spots The eyes of the man in black clothes were devoid of emotions.
<br><br>
When people looked at him, they got an impression of a tightened bow simmering with a surging power that could be released any time.
<br><br>
His emotions were like deep water in a tranquil lake. He looked outwardly composed, as if he was merely taking a walk in his courtyard. But everyone could sense that there was great power concealed below the surface.
<br><br>
No one could see through his real thoughts, not even Othniel.
<br><br>
"I asked nicely but since it didn't work, I'll have to use my fists," the man in black said in a flat tone.
<br><br>
It was as if declaring war on a Chaos Ancient God was quite common for him.
<br><br>
Although Othniel considered him a strong enemy, he had no intention of backing down. He threw Zen into the void and pointed at him so that a space cage instantly formed around Zen.
<br><br>
Even if Zen were to suddenly wake up and fight back, he would not be able to escape from the space cage. No one could help him break it from the outside either. It would be a difficult task even for the Eternal Realm masters present.
<br><br>
But much to the shock of everyone watching, the moment Zen touched the bottom of the space cage, he completely absorbed the energy shaping the floor and his body was quickly dropped from the cage.
<br><br>
Everyone was amused and was rendered speechless. Shera couldn't help but snigger.
<br><br>
Zen's physical body had been in such a strange state that even Othniel had made mistakes dealing with it more than once.
<br><br>
They had so far noticed that Zen would absorb all the power around him except for the brass man's Combat Dragon Absorb. Perhaps it was a mere coincidence, or perhaps it was because of the inferior power of the Combat Dragon Absorb.
<br><br>
For what it was worth, Shera's conjecture was very close to the truth.
<br><br>
Zen didn't really absorb all sorts of power. The process only occurred according to the map on the square. It was true that the power of the Combat Dragon Absorb was not superior enough for Zen to absorb it.
<br><br>
Othniel's power on the other hand, was an excellent option. Every time Othniel used the power of space against Zen, Zen's body immediately devoured it.
<br><br>
This occurred multiple times before a new light column appeared in the space-time quadrant of the map, rising rapidly.
<br><br>
Even when Zen fell from the sky, the black-clothed man looked to be in no hurry to snatch him.
<br><br>
Othniel was embarrassed, teleporting almost instantly to Zen's side. He caught Zen, flew up to the Yellow Thearch, and handed Zen over to him as he said, "Protect him well."
<br><br>
And then, Othniel rose back to the same height as the man in black.
<br><br>
Frowning in confusion, Yellow Thearch turned to look at Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, whom Othniel still had in his trap.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was a great force not only because it had the support of the Chaos Ancient God. Fuxi and the Snake Goddess themselves were very powerful warriors.
<br><br>
Whatever was happening was heavily disadvantageous to the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. Irrespective of who won, the result would be unacceptable for Pear Hill. The best result for them, perhaps, would be for Othniel and the man to fight like Kilkenny cats.
<br><br>
But Fuxi and the Snake Goddess remained quite calm and composed. Did they have a trump card up their sleeve? As Yellow Thearch wondered about this, a dazzling blue light, even brighter than the sun, shone out of the sky. Everyone squinted in the sudden glare of light.
<br><br>
When the blue flare finally disappeared, a long transparent blue saber appeared in Othniel's hand. It was obviously a weapon he had created with the power of space.
<br><br>
Othniel rarely chose to fight face to face. Most times, he only needed to exile his opponents, the way Mount had exiled Zen into the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Othniel had exiled Gerald as well, when he hadn't been careful enough.
<br><br>
But this man before him caused a deep need of annihilation within Othniel.
<br><br>
With a sudden wave of the long saber in his hand, he split the space in front of him in half, creating a huge space crack.
<br><br>
The space crack extended like the mouth of a huge fish as it loomed over the man in black.
<br><br>
The man in black raised an eyebrow and gently tilted his body. A wisp of cyan light thick as a finger surged into the sky, shooting up to millions of feet away.
<br><br>
A three-foot-long thin sword appeared in his hand, his usual weapon, the Cyan Misty Sword.
<br><br>
"Flash, my sword!"
<br><br>
The moment the man in black brandished his sword, he disappeared into thin air.
<br><br>
He and his sword had turned into a cyan glow that spread throughout the sky, shooting towards Othniel.
<br><br>
The space crack that Othniel had created disappeared the moment it met the cyan glow. The space power seemed unable to withstand even a single blow.
<br><br>
Othniel was not that shocked even though his first strike had so easily dissolved.
<br><br>
Instead, he looked up at the sky, trying to track the man in black's position.
<br><br>
If they were in the same space, no one could ever avoid Othniel's detection.
<br><br>
It was his talent that neither did he need to search for his opponent's aura nor did he have to use his spiritual sense to scan the space. He simply sensed everything that existed in the space around him. This ability of Othniel's was similar to the one that Usman had.
<br><br>
To his surprise, though, the man in black seemed to have completely disappeared in the cyan glow. How was this possible? Othniel was gobsmacked for a moment, finding it hard to accept this truth.
<br><br>
"The space truth is the highest rule in the chaos. You can't completely grasp it even as a Son of Truth. What you've comprehended is only a small part of it."
<br><br>
The voice of the man in black sounded from behind Othniel.
<br><br>
Othniel turned around abruptly, bringing the space saber in his hand slashing down in the direction of the voice.
<br><br>
Others might have misjudged the direction, but Othniel never made such mistakes.
<br><br>
He struck the sword three times in a row.
<br><br>
The azure blue space slashes were fast enough to split everything in their path, including the space itself.
<br><br>
A large number of space cracks emerged as the space slashes swept across the sky. The sky was like a book, and these space cracks were like pages that had been torn off from the book. The space itself looked miraculous under Othniel's formidable power.
<br><br>
The structure of the space itself was completely destroyed. If the man in black was hiding himself in the space, he would split into countless pieces as well.
<br><br>
But Othniel still couldn't see any signs of the man.
<br><br>
"Since what you've grasped is only a part of the space truth, you also have blind spots in space."
<br><br>
The man's voice echoed again. Othniel lifted the space saber but discovered that he couldn't determine the direction of the voice this time. The man's voice seemed to come from the depths of his mind. How was he doing that? Just as Othniel was looking around incredulously, a beam of cyan light suddenly shot out from behind him.
<br><br>
It pierced through Othniel's back and continued to shoot straight ahead, crossing several provinces, boundary walls, and thick earth along the way before it shot straight out of the Source World and into the chaos.
<br><br>
Since the cyan light was only as thick as a little finger, it didn't create a hole large enough for the chaotic energy from the outside to flow into the Source World. But it had killed innumerable innocent creatures on its way out.
<br><br>
The small wound wasn't much trouble for Othniel. He only felt a slight pain in his back, and he brought his saber down behind him a few more times.
<br><br>
Large areas of space were destroyed, but the man in black seemed not to exist. Othniel's strikes had nearly destroyed everything in the space behind him, but he still failed to touch the man in black.
<br><br>
Chapter 3867 Direct Exile Generally speaking, the self-healing ability of the space in the Source World was quite strong.
<br><br>
The space usually repaired itself quite quickly after it was damaged. To put it simply, the space cracks created by even the mighty warriors of the Other Shore Realm only lasted for a moment before they disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>
However, Othniel's impact on the space was too much. The dilapidated space was exposed and formed strange scenes.
<br><br>
"You're just a coward who is good at hiding!" He tried several times, but he failed to touch the man in black every time. Now he felt a little anxious.
<br><br>
A powerful being like Othniel knew almost everything. There were few secrets that they couldn't understand. Thus, he naturally felt uneasy when he faced an unsolvable problem.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
At that moment, another ray of cyan light bloomed on his forehead.
<br><br>
This time, he didn't dodge. His eyes glowed blue, and the space in his head had changed. As soon as the cyan light entered his head, it refracted ninety degrees and ran through towards the other side.
<br><br>
"Whoosh—"
<br><br>
The cyan light flew towards the direction where Fuxi and the Snake Goddess located. Although the Snake Goddess dodged very fast, blood flowed out from her strong, graceful leg.
<br><br>
Still, she remained nonchalant, and she didn't even frown. The injury was nothing to her.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Fuxi's eyebrows furrowed tightly.
<br><br>
In turn, the Snake Goddess personally reassured Fuxi and told him to not get agitated, but to be patient.
<br><br>
But it was not Fuxi's style to hold back his emotions.
<br><br>
"Now that this man in black is here, let's take this chance to kill Othniel together!" Fuxi told the Snake Goddess through telepathy. The Snake Goddess slightly shook her head.
<br><br>
"Even if we managed to kill Othniel by working together, how would we deal with the man in black from the Nihility race?" she asked.
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes only darkened at her question, which was rather rare for him.
<br><br>
He seldom felt discouraged, because except for the Three Purities Stage, there was no opponent he was afraid of on the Other Shore or in the Source World.
<br><br>
But the man in black was stronger than anyone he had met before. Fuxi didn't think he had any chance to win against him.
<br><br>
"There will be a chance," said the Snake Goddess in a gentle voice with a smile in her wise eyes. "Fuxi, be patient."
<br><br>
No matter how irritable Fuxi was, he would calm down when he heard the soft voice of the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Now, Othniel might have mastered the method to fight against the Cyan Misty Sword.
<br><br>
A small space stood out and blocked the cyan light whenever it lit up. The cyan light that could pierce through millions of feet deviated due to the reflection of the space.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
However, the cyan light was too powerful. It could extend up to several or even dozens of provinces, and all the creatures in its way would suffer.
<br><br>
On the other side of the Separate Amber Province, the great warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace stared at the mighty warriors of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the New Moon race.
<br><br>
Their previous fight had gotten suspended because of Othniel's and Gerald's appearances. Naturally, their battle became meaningless since beings with higher levels of power had arrived.
<br><br>
The battle would come to an end when the fight between the great warriors at the higher level ended.
<br><br>
Right after that, however, Gerald suddenly disappeared. A few moments later, rays of immensely strong cyan light began to shoot everywhere.
<br><br>
The warriors of the Holy Soul Realm and the Chaotic Source Realm didn't have a physical body as powerful as the Snake Goddess'. It was bearable if the cyan light hit their hands or feet since they would only lose their arms or legs at most. However, they would die if it hit their heads or chests.
<br><br>
The two sides who had been confronting each other in the air finally withdrew tacitly and dodged. However, it was useless, because after all, the cyan light bypassed almost any kind of obstructions.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
A ray of cyan light pierced through the sky and hit Zen's body, but it did not puncture him. That was the first time that the cyan sword radiance failed to penetrate something.
<br><br>
After Zen's body had blocked it, the cyan sword radiance turned into a pool of liquid that glimmered with cyan light. It did not last long, however as Zen's body quickly absorbed it.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch had put Zen above his head to use him as a shield, but he wasn't sure if Zen could block the cyan light or not.
<br><br>
When he saw that Zen was still safe and sound even after the cyan light had hit him, he was utterly shocked.
<br><br>
'This guy is really extraordinary...' "It's a waste of time if you only hide in the dark," Othniel said as he moved slowly. His eyes divided the entire world into blocks, and he shifted his attention to the energy reaction inside those blocks.
<br><br>
After all, he was the Son of Truth of space. As he continued to observe, he gradually understood how the man in black made it.
<br><br>
Countless figures flashed inside the space blocks. Those figures were the man in black.
<br><br>
The man in black did not disappear. Instead, he moved at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
According to the common space rules, one had to create a short distance or even a long distance space channel for the Grand Teleportation or instant teleportation. Only then could they cross from one end to the other end of the space channel.
<br><br>
However, the man in black didn't need to do that. He could appear at any point then disappear at another point on his accord.
<br><br>
Even Othniel couldn't do such a thing.
<br><br>
"You can't possibly refract all my sword radiance, nor can you stay cautious all the time. Just three sword strikes are enough. It's impressive to kill a Son of Truth with three sword strikes," the man in black said from the space.
<br><br>
As he spoke, his sword released more concentrated cyan sword radiance.
<br><br>
The long sword radiance, which was as thick as a finger, was like a thick thread. While Othniel was at the center, it refracted in all directions like mad.
<br><br>
In this way, the mighty warriors of the Eternal Realm, including the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and Mahoney, were in a more dangerous situation. The sword radiance came and pierced through them from time to time, and they almost couldn't dodge it.
<br><br>
Only Yellow Thearch remained unharmed because he placed Zen above his head as a natural shield.
<br><br>
Crack! Like the man in black had said, Othniel couldn't be careful all the time.
<br><br>
Although he could refract ninety-nine point nine percent of the cyan sword radiance away, there would always be a little cyan sword light left as time went by.
<br><br>
Finally, one ray of cyan sword radiance dodged Othniel's refraction and punctured his shoulder.
<br><br>
"The second sword strike." The voice of the man in black came again.
<br><br>
Othniel's face darkened.
<br><br>
The man in black had just said that he could kill him with three sword strikes.
<br><br>
Based on the cyan light's lethality, not even thirty or three hundred strikes could cause any substantial damage to him, let alone only three strikes.
<br><br>
Yet, according to the man in black, there might be some other consequences if the cyan light hit him thrice. Or was it just a threat? The Three Purities Stage was a magical place with all kinds of strange abilities.
<br><br>
At first, Othniel wanted to deal with the man in black slowly while he tried to come up with a solution—but after he felt that things had gotten much worse, he suddenly looked ferocious.
<br><br>
His eyes suddenly turned into two weird blue energy entities and abruptly exploded. At the same time, a large block appeared covering dozens of miles around the man in black.
<br><br>
Then the block disappeared, together with the man inside it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3868 Uncle A space which was thirty miles wide, thirty miles high, and thirty miles long had been deleted from the chaos and exiled into the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
On all sides, everything squeezed into the gap to fill in the disappeared space. The ground itself was pulled up. A majestic mountain, thirty miles high, appeared out of thin air.
<br><br>
The last time, Zen had quickly returned after Mount exiled him. This attracted Othniel's attention.
<br><br>
The outside world thought that the Land of Ashes—also known as the Deleting Space—was controlled by Othniel. In fact, he couldn't affect anything in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
The information left by the Sons of Truth on the Other Shore seemed to indicate that the Deleting Space was under the control of Othniel. But much had changed over the past few hundred chaotic eras. The Deleting Space had undergone a dramatic transformation, and Othniel had lost control of it.
<br><br>
He didn't know for certain what had happened inside.
<br><br>
All he knew was that he had the ability to exile people and things into the Deleting Space. However, he had no power to delete the creatures and things within that space.
<br><br>
Zen's safe return from the Deleting Space had shaken Othniel. He immediately tried to invade the Deleting Space to reclaim his authority over it.
<br><br>
None of Othniel's attempts to regain control was successful.
<br><br>
Othniel had always felt that something strange was in the Deleting Space, something that he could not track or detect. It was a sore spot in his heart.
<br><br>
In this case, Othniel would not have chosen to delete the man in black unless he had no other choice. After all, it might prove ineffective.
<br><br>
However, since the man in black had been deleted, Othniel seized this opportunity to take Zen away.
<br><br>
The man in black frowned as he floated in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
He raised a hand to pat his head, muttering, "I was too careless. I forgot this trick."
<br><br>
It was not a good thing for him to be exiled to this damned place.
<br><br>
He had come with the help of the Descending Ring, but now the Descending Ring had grown dim. He had lost contact with the Other Shore.
<br><br>
What if he was truly trapped in this cursed space, unable to find his way out? It would cause enormous problems for the Nihility race.
<br><br>
As he floated, the man in black suddenly realized the strangeness of his situation. "Shouldn't the things in the Deleting Space be completely destroyed? Why is this place..."
<br><br>
To his surprise, after some time, he noticed something visible in the distance. He squinted. It seemed to be a vast, endless, floating wasteland.
<br><br>
He stared at this unexpected sight, feeling more confused than ever. His eyes widened when he saw two figures flying in his direction. One was Ziya, and the other was Geoffrey.
<br><br>
At first the man in black doubted if it was truly Ziya. But when he confirmed the truth of Ziya's identity, twin flames began burning in his eyes.
<br><br>
When he was facing Othniel, a powerful Chaos Ancient God, he had managed to act cool and collected, as though nothing had happened.
<br><br>
But when he saw Ziya, the man in black could no longer restrain the anger that had burned in his heart for countless years. His gaze was filled with killing intent.
<br><br>
A low buzz sounded as he attacked.
<br><br>
He tapped the Cyan Misty Sword, and a thin ray of cyan light shot towards Ziya.
<br><br>
Not long after Ziya and Geoffrey returned, a loud noise could be heard coming from the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
This was a common occurrence, so Ziya didn't take it seriously. He brought Geoffrey directly there to see what was going on.
<br><br>
But before he had even noticed the man in black, he saw the extremely sharp and deadly ray of cyan light rushing towards him.
<br><br>
His eyes narrowed when he sensed the power of the cyan light. He instantly waved his hand, and a golden whip lashed out like a poisonous dragon at the ray of cyan light.
<br><br>
The golden and cyan lights converged in midair. Ziya waved his golden whip, forming many small spirals, and soon the cyan light was swallowed up.
<br><br>
Geoffrey hung back, watching the attack and counterattack with surprise.
<br><br>
He had always considered Ziya to be much stronger than his father.
<br><br>
Despite the fact that he was powerless in the Abstruse Energy World, Ziya had never met an opponent in the chaos. He had a grim look on his face that Geoffrey had not seen before.
<br><br>
Geoffrey caught sight of the man in black and wondered who he was. Why had he initiated a fight with Ziya as soon as he arrived, without even speaking to him first? But the fight was not over.
<br><br>
Rays of cyan light shot out from afar, and some of them headed straight for Geoffrey.
<br><br>
Ziya's face turned cold. His lips formed a sneer as he raised the golden whip in his hand and flicked it, causing a loud explosion in midair. The whip reformed into an arc of bright golden light which lashed towards the cyan rays.
<br><br>
The previously invincible cyan lights seemed fragile compared to the golden lights.
<br><br>
Every time a golden light bloomed, a cyan ray was drawn away, turning into a cyan lotus that slowly dissipated into space.
<br><br>
The cyan rays blasted towards Ziya one after another, and he lashed out at each one with his golden whip.
<br><br>
In the span of a few seconds, thirty-six rays of golden light bloomed, and thirty-six cyan lotuses appeared and dissipated.
<br><br>
The fierce clash of energy was a spectacular, dazzling scene. Geoffrey watched with great fascination. He knew that although the colorful bursts of energy were beautiful, they were also terrifying. A single ray of light could kill him instantly.
<br><br>
His estimation of Ziya rose, and he now believed more than ever that Ziya was immensely powerful.
<br><br>
Although all his attacks had been dispersed, the man in black seemed undaunted. He raised his Cyan Misty Sword once more. Six black flags appeared behind him.
<br><br>
Thin black energy lines flowed on the surface of each flag.
<br><br>
These were known as the Six Soul Flags.
<br><br>
Ziya raised an eyebrow. He called out, "Are you really planning to fight me to the death, uncle?"
<br><br>
The Cyan Misty Sword trembled in the man's hand. He drew a circle from top to bottom with himself at the center. Although there was no wind, the Six Soul Flags fluttered, and a mysterious and indescribable aura spread out from his body. He shouted back, "You have the cheek to call me uncle?"
<br><br>
Again, a buzz signaled his impending attack.
<br><br>
The black energy emanated by the Six Soul Flags suddenly flowed inward, gathering on the surface of the Cyan Misty Sword. The cyan glow of the sword intersected with the black energy, and the sword began to burn.
<br><br>
Raising his sword, the man in black rushed towards Ziya.
<br><br>
Ziya gently pushed Geoffrey, and an unseen force propelled Geoffrey away.
<br><br>
In the face of such a powerful attack, he had no time to protect Geoffrey.
<br><br>
"Let bygones be bygones. Why do you still keep the past in mind?" Ziya said, lifting his own golden whip once more.
<br><br>
Ziya's God Lashing Whip had been created by the Primeval Lord of Heaven with Ziya's root-level bloodline. It was his most powerful weapon.
<br><br>
"Your master has said the same thing many times," the man in black said coldly. "It is nonsense!"
<br><br>
He was the Grandmaster of Heaven whom Zen had met.
<br><br>
He and the Primeval Lord of Heaven had learned from the same master, so he was Ziya's uncle.
<br><br>
At first, Ziya had not known if he was still alive. After all, when the 77th chaos ended, Ziya had been exiled to the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Ziya didn't know anything about what happened later on the Other Shore until Zen took him out from the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Although Ziya had grown much since those days, he still found it deeply unsettling that the mere sight of him had spurred the Grandmaster of Heaven to an immediate fight to the death.
<br><br>
Chapter 3869 Passing The Ball Within the 77th chaos, there had been a great conflict between the Interception Sect, created by the Grandmaster of Heaven, and the Enlightenment Sect, created by the Primeval Lord of Heaven. The reason behind this conflict was also related to the Finale Way.
<br><br>
At the end of the battle, the Grandmaster of Heaven had been defeated by Ziya, and the foundation of the Interception Sect had been destroyed beyond repair.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven had led the remaining people of their sect to the Other Shore in an attempt to escape, and there they had quickly disappeared. In the past hundreds of chaotic eras, no one had ever seen the Grandmaster of Heaven himself, or the members of the Interception Sect.
<br><br>
It was not until the Nihility race appeared out of the blue that the Grandmaster of Heaven began to show his face once again.
<br><br>
There was no known knowledge of what the Grandmaster of Heaven had gone through, or how he had become the leader of the Nihility race during that time.
<br><br>
The moment Ziya had descended into the Bloom Divine Province, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had warned him of the Grandmaster of Heaven, and to be cautious if he were to ever come across him. The latter had not moved on from when the Interception Sect had been destroyed.
<br><br>
Ziya hadn't felt the need to take the words seriously at the time. He had thought that time would ease the pain, and erase the hatred in the Grandmaster of Heaven's heart. However, when they had come across one another in the Deleting Space, fury and hatred had burned in the Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes as he looked at Ziya, regarding him as if they were old enemies.
<br><br>
A metallic 'whoosh' had cut through the air.
<br><br>
With the Cyan Misty Sword in hand, the Grandmaster of Heaven had rushed towards Ziya.
<br><br>
The Six Soul Flags in the distance quivered, and the black fire licking along the blade burned with heavy violence.
<br><br>
Ziya understood just how powerful the Six Soul Flags were. He also knew that the Grandmaster of Heaven had led the Nihility race to great power, and that they could easily stand up to the Elemental Spirit race as near equals. His strength had grown exponentially.
<br><br>
"God Lashing Whip!"
<br><br>
Ziya struck out hard with his whip as he retreated.
<br><br>
The resounding cracks caused by the whip were ear-piercing.
<br><br>
As shadows danced and shimmied along the whip, the void began to tremble. What looked to be ripples appeared in the air, warping and distorting everything within their sight.
<br><br>
The movement of the God Lashing Whip was erratic, and had no pattern to follow as it sent golden shadows one after another into the void.
<br><br>
Those countless shadows then melded together to create a long, narrow dragon shadow that immediately rushed the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The shadows seemed alive, sizzling and cracking as they moved.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven thrust his sword in front of him and shifted forward. The black flames soared high, and ate away the golden shadows from the whip as they approached.
<br><br>
When he had advanced to only a few dozen feet away from Ziya, Ziya relinquished his hold on his God Lashing Whip and bowed to the Grandmaster of Heaven with cupped hands.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven paused, confused by the gesture. His eyes flashed with anger before turning cold. "Do you think this display will make me show mercy? Ziya, how naive you are!"
<br><br>
"No, I did not think you would show me mercy. Now is not the time for us to fight. I'm sorry that I have to do this to you," Ziya said quietly.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven found himself thoroughly confused, and the sudden sensation of the sky and earth moving made his head spin. In the next moment, he appeared in the Separate Amber Province. This was where Othniel had exiled him.
<br><br>
Ziya had total control over the Deleting Space. He had more authority than the Chaos Ancient God here. Not only could he freely dispose of things within the space, he could also find the same time node.
<br><br>
It wasn't that Ziya didn't have the strength to battle the Grandmaster of Heaven, but he shared the same thought as his master, the Primeval Lord of Heaven. When they had defeated the Interception Sect, they had felt some modicum of guilt and did not want to fight him because of that.
<br><br>
The moment the right space and time node had been found, Ziya sent the Grandmaster of Heaven out of the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Once Othniel had exiled the Grandmaster of Heaven into the Deleting Space, he floated down. He worried that the Grandmaster of Heaven would return quickly, so he planned to take Zen away as soon as possible.
<br><br>
But before he could descend, a space fluctuation occurred not far away, and the Grandmaster of Heaven emerged.
<br><br>
Othniel's face contorted slightly before smoothing back out. Without hesitation, he slashed his hand through the air in the direction of the Grandmaster of Heaven, and immediately wrapped him in another expanse of space.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven found himself still in a daze after being forced out of the Deleting Space. It made no sense. How did Ziya have such an ability? While he was stuck within his cloud of confusion, a space fluctuation enveloped him flawlessly and he found himself once more in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Ziya couldn't find the words to express his own confusion. Within a span of several seconds, the Grandmaster of Heaven had been cast out only to be returned moments later.
<br><br>
What the hell was going on? With his intelligence, it was not difficult for Ziya to grasp what was exactly going on.
<br><br>
The only possible explanation could be that when the Grandmaster of Heaven descended through the Descending Ring, he had fought with the Son of Truth who controlled that particular space.
<br><br>
Ziya could have never guessed that the reason the two fought was Zen.
<br><br>
"You'd best vent all that anger on the Son of Truth," Ziya grumbled.
<br><br>
With a wave of his hand, he sent the Grandmaster of Heaven back out.
<br><br>
Othniel though, who was in the Separate Amber Province, was on his guard. The moment he saw the Grandmaster of Heaven was cast out, he began to delete the space.
<br><br>
With no time to react, the Grandmaster of Heaven was sent right back to the Deleting Space. He felt as if he were going to be sick...
<br><br>
Ziya sighed, his shoulders slumping. The Grandmaster of Heaven might be difficult to deal with, and the Son of Truth probably had no choice but to continue to send him back, but it was not a good idea to keep throwing him back and forth like a ball.
<br><br>
"I suppose all I can do is close the Deleting Space."
<br><br>
Over countless chaotic eras, Ziya had managed the affairs and taken over the rights of the Deleting Space. He certainly had the ability to refuse the space that the Son of Truth had "deleted" to enter.
<br><br>
However, Ziya needed the substances that were sent in, one after the other, from the chaos. It allowed him to learn things from within the chaos.
<br><br>
A soft whooshing sound startled Ziya from his thoughts.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven had regained his senses enough to utilize Grand Teleportation and reach Ziya instantly.
<br><br>
He raised his hand and swung his sword! The black radiance along the edges of his sword was as bright as fire, and came barreling towards Ziya's face.
<br><br>
Ziya though was a little bit faster...
<br><br>
Before the attack could plow into him, the Grandmaster of Heaven disappeared.
<br><br>
Ziya turned quickly to look at the Deleting Pillars at the far end of the Deleting Space. He waved his hands before him, and a portion of the Deleting Pillars hummed to life with a bright light before quickly dimming.
<br><br>
With that action, the rules of the Deleting Space had changed. There was a unique space node at the entrance of the Deleting Space, and it so happened to be controlled by Othniel. However, Ziya had long ago changed it to be one way, so people could enter but not leave.
<br><br>
But now that particular rule had changed. People could neither enter nor leave.
<br><br>
When the Grandmaster of Heaven had been sent out once more, Othniel immediately enveloped him with space and began to delete it.
<br><br>
However, the space did not disappear, no matter how hard Othniel willed it to.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven remained where he had appeared, and stared at Othniel with a puzzled expression.
<br><br>
Could a Chaos Ancient God even make a mistake? "What have you done?! I can't sense the Deleting Space!" Othniel cried in shock.
<br><br>
Losing the ability to delete meant losing a trump card, but usually Chaos Ancient Gods had many of those up their sleeves.
<br><br>
The fact that the ability he had obtained from the space of truth was weakened or muted by another made him feel on edge, the horrible feeling creeping up his spine.
<br><br>
Chapter 3870 The Heart-piercing Lock The Grandmaster of Heaven had already readied himself to enter the Deleting Space once more when Othniel said something strange to him. A visible frown appeared on his face as he stared back at Othniel.
<br><br>
In the eyes of the Grandmaster of Heaven, his opponents on both sides needed to be personally dealt with.
<br><br>
As he was expelled in the Deleting Space that was controlled by Ziya, he was surprised when he observed that the time node could be directly changed.
<br><br>
When he was being transferred between the two places, all he thought about was how he could defeat Ziya.
<br><br>
In his mind, if he could replace Ziya who was controlling the Deleting Space, then he could earn a lot from it. Most importantly, he could also return to the chaos through the time node.
<br><br>
"I didn't do anything. If you want, you can try again," the Grandmaster of Heaven responded with a straight face.
<br><br>
While Othniel heard these words, a strange expression glimmered in his eyes. He took a few steps forward and sneered, "Are you mocking me?"
<br><br>
"No. Of course not," the Grandmaster of Heaven quickly replied. "I'm just hoping that you can try sending me back into that space again."
<br><br>
Seeing the sincere expression of the Grandmaster of Heaven, all of the Eternal Realm warriors that were currently present couldn't help but look at each other with confused faces.
<br><br>
Right now, the Grandmaster of Heaven had a rough estimate of Ziya's abilities.
<br><br>
It seemed that Othniel wasn't pretending. Ziya had most probably shut down the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Now, the Grandmaster of Heaven was more interested in this magical place and yearned for it even more.
<br><br>
However, Othniel couldn't understand what the Grandmaster of Heaven was really thinking. He tried several times, but the space around the Grandmaster of Heaven was just constantly shaking and there was no way to send him in.
<br><br>
With all that was happening, Othniel couldn't help but ask him, "Tell me.
<br><br>
What exactly happened in that space?"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven shrugged and said, "Ha, I can't tell you that."
<br><br>
Of course, he didn't have the slightest intention of telling Othniel the matter about Ziya.
<br><br>
"All right then. I'll know after I kill you." Othniel's voice suddenly became cold. He had a strong urge to figure out what had truly happened in the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the cubic space surrounding the Grandmaster of Heaven transformed into a solid cube.
<br><br>
Othniel controlled the space truth. With it, he could define and manipulate most of the spaces in the chaos. This time, he controlled the space containing the Grandmaster of Heaven and transformed it into a solid state.
<br><br>
Crash! With a wave of his hand, the whole cube instantly collapsed.
<br><br>
If it was an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior, they would be completely shattered along with the crushed space fragments.
<br><br>
However, the Grandmaster of Heaven was fully prepared, and he was powerful enough not to be easily defeated by such kind of move.
<br><br>
When the view became clear, all they saw were broken space fragments.
<br><br>
The body of the Grandmaster of Heaven couldn't be seen anywhere.
<br><br>
Othniel instantly felt a shiver creeping beneath his skin, as if some dangerous beast was glaring at him somewhere in the dark. Suddenly, the Grandmaster of Heaven appeared above his head.
<br><br>
He was holding a long sword that was pointed downwards, like a praying swordsman. The tip of the sword immediately dashed downwards in an attempt to directly stab Othniel's head.
<br><br>
At the same time, a blue light flashed in Othniel's eyes, and the space above his head suddenly became distorted. The long sword that was supposed to stab his head disappeared as it touched the distorted space. Immediately after that, the sword appeared from the side of the Grandmaster of Heaven, directly aimed at his head.
<br><br>
Othniel bent the space and threw the sword back to the Grandmaster of Heaven to stab himself instead.
<br><br>
However, just before the sword thrust through him, the eyes of the Grandmaster of Heaven also beamed with the same blue light. Suddenly, the space beside his head also became distorted. The Cyan Misty Sword that was fast approaching him instantly disappeared. In a split second, a distorted space appeared in front of Othniel's chest, and the sword rushed out with a violent force, thrusting directly towards his chest.
<br><br>
Splat! A ray of cyan light pierced through Othniel from front to back.
<br><br>
A hint of confusion appeared in Othniel's eyes as he slowly looked at the sword stabbing in his chest. Blood was dripping on his mouth as he stared back at the Grandmaster of Heaven. "Only I could distort the space. How did you..."
<br><br>
The truth was many people could actually connect two points in space and create a circular space channel. It was also the case with the space distortion that Othniel created.
<br><br>
However, most temporary channels that were created by ordinary people were unstable. Only Othniel could manipulate and create a distorted space that could deflect a sword strike that had the power of hundreds of thousands of divine megatons.
<br><br>
But it turned out that Othniel wasn't the only one who could do it now, as the Grandmaster of Heaven blatantly used the same powerful skill to attack him. Since Othniel began to fight with this man, there had been several mysterious things he witnessed that he couldn't comprehend.
<br><br>
"You're asking me why I can do that?" the Grandmaster of Heaven spoke as he slowly pulled out his Cyan Misty Sword from Othniel through the distorted spaces. "It's because the truth-level theurgy is not unique to you. I can also grasp it. And you know what? I can grasp more skills from you if I want."
<br><br>
Othniel's eyes narrowed. There was an extreme mixture of surprise and rage on his face.
<br><br>
If their previous battles seemed to be opportunities to test each other's strengths, then now would be the time for a showdown.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's words rang in his ears, and he understood them very well.
<br><br>
They meant that the Grandmaster of Heaven could deprive the abilities of the Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
Whether he could really do that or not was still unknown. However, the fact remained that he had just used the same space distortion theurgy as Othniel did.
<br><br>
"You're an arrogant piece of crap, aren't you? Let's see if you really have the ability to do that!"
<br><br>
Othniel roared in anger. His face began to deform, his pair of eyes started to merge into one, and his teeth became sharper. His head was beginning to expand rapidly as he attempted to return to his original form.
<br><br>
The spectating warriors also knew that the two powerful masters would likely transform into their strongest forms if they were determined to have an all-out battle. That meant that Othniel would turn into his original monstrous form, and the Grandmaster of Heaven would use his Wild God Body.
<br><br>
However, much to their surprise, that wasn't the intention of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
He stood in the air and stared at Othniel with a mocking smile.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Othniel's transformation stopped abruptly. It was as if a superior force suppressed the changes that were going on.
<br><br>
"Why would you need to transform? You look good in your human form.
<br><br>
You don't need to become that ugly one-eyed monster."
<br><br>
Then, the Grandmaster of Heaven gently raised his Cyan Misty Sword.
<br><br>
Soon after, three thin threads quietly appeared and turned out to tightly wrap around Othniel's body. Suddenly, the white thin threads grew larger and turned into white jade chains. The other ends of the chains were connected to a small yellow lock that was in the hand of the Grandmaster of Heaven. The lock was exceptionally exquisite, and there were undecipherable Sanskrit words on both sides. It was the Heart-piercing Lock, another powerful magic treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Previously, the Grandmaster of Heaven had given a hint that three strikes were all it would take him to kill Othniel. These three sword strikes were what activated the Heart-piercing Lock that completely suppressed Othniel's body. Now everything in Othniel's body was locked up, meaning that all his theurgies were sealed. That was why there was no need for him to use the Wild God Power.
<br><br>
On the outside, Othniel looked motionless. But the truth was he was currently in a fierce struggle within his body. He was trying to free himself, but the Heart-piercing Lock was absolutely powerful. He was extremely enraged with the fact that the dignified Chaos Ancient God like him would be defeated by the Grandmaster of Heaven in this way.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven knew about Othniel's on-going efforts and struggling, but he didn't pay much attention to it. He just slowly descended while dragging the white jade chains.
<br><br>
Now that he was able to successfully trap Othniel, it was time for him to deal with the other warriors present.
<br><br>
He knew these warriors' high positions and standpoints in the Source World, but it didn't matter to him. Since he couldn't kill the real masters in the Three Purities Stage, he decided to annihilate first these duplicates of them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3871 Backup Plan After the Grandmaster of Heaven descended, he couldn't help but gaze at those down below.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yellow Thearch, each one of them made his blood boil.
<br><br>
He knew that the people that stood before him had different standpoints and were mere avatars devoid of memory, but it didn't stop the inexplicable hatred that surged in his heart when his eyes swept over their faces.
<br><br>
His negative feelings did not go unnoticed. Everyone felt the waves of anger that emanated from the Grandmaster of Heaven, including Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer who had gradually recovered from the form of a goat monster.
<br><br>
Mahoney, however, felt a bit lucky.
<br><br>
This mysterious man in black had such a furious expression when he looked at the others but when it came to her, all he had was an expressionless gaze.
<br><br>
She hoped she wouldn't find trouble with her.
<br><br>
Just as Mahoney silently rejoiced, the Grandmaster of Heaven turned towards her. "I shall kill this irrelevant person first.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The Heart-piercing Lock in his hand trembled just as a long, thin chain emerged and headed straight towards Mahoney. Instead of white jade, the chain was stark black, obviously of lower grade than the one that had trapped Othniel. But it was more than enough to trap Mahoney.
<br><br>
After she heard the Grandmaster of Heaven's words, Mahoney's face quickly paled. She rolled backwards, just as the chain headed her way, and tried to get out of her now precarious situation.
<br><br>
The space in front of the black chain distorted as it appeared right in front of Mahoney.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
Mahoney's armor, a masterpiece that she was quite proud of, shattered underneath the piercing force of the black chain.
<br><br>
With no defensive chestplate, the black chain sunk into her chest, and the moment it entered her body, the Spearhead Armor of Destruction on her body collapsed instantly while her life force rapidly faded away.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Mahoney's life force dissipated entirely.
<br><br>
An Eternal Realm warrior truly was no match against the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
As the chain retracted, Mahoney's corpse snapped back and shot towards the black ship.
<br><br>
"Deal with the corpse," the Grandmaster of Heaven muttered darkly.
<br><br>
The sight of Mahoney's corpse made Shera salivate.
<br><br>
Her ghouls were weak and all she could really do was transform her own body.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven basically awarded her an Eternal Realm warrior, which meant she had a lot of room to work with when it came to her transformation. In her eyes, Mahoney's body was an extremely rare treasure.
<br><br>
Shera caught her body and gave Fuxi and the others a momentary side glance. "Thank you, Grandmaster of Heaven."
<br><br>
The meaning behind her eyes was clear: these Eternal Realm warriors were next.
<br><br>
If Shera cultivated these warriors into ghouls then she would be able to do anything she wanted in the Source World.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch's and Divine Farmer's faces darkened when they witnessed Mahoney's end. Meanwhile, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess began to gather their power.
<br><br>
Not long ago, these two groups of people were still fighting each other.
<br><br>
Now there was no other choice out of this situation but to join hands and fight against this powerful enemy! This mysterious man in black was truly strange.
<br><br>
Not only did he possess Othniel's truth-level theurgy which was impossible to guard against, he also had the Heart-piercing Lock that had the ability to entrap and lock everything within its hold.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess exchanged a knowing look with Fuxi as she summoned a Descending Ring in her hand.
<br><br>
After she obtained the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits from Zen, she carefully studied the use of the Descending Rings.
<br><br>
In the beginning, Fuxi was keen on reserving the Descending Rings to summon the Augury Dog.
<br><br>
The Augury Dog was powerful, and was his best friend in the Three Purities Stage. In terms of strength, he was only a little weaker than Fuxi, and much more powerful than the ordinary warriors at the Eternal Realm.
<br><br>
A Descending Ring was not easy to obtain so why would they use it just so that one more Eternal Realm master could guard the Pear Hill? The Snake Goddess did not want that.
<br><br>
So on the Three Purities Stage, she gave a Descending Ring to the Primal Crocodile race.
<br><br>
They were also an extremely powerful force in the Three Purities Stage but were extremely xenophobic and cared little for the affairs of the world.
<br><br>
Even the Element Spirit race did not dare provoke them, much less enter their territory.
<br><br>
A long time ago, the Snake Goddess saved the life of a little Primal Crocodile and earned her this elusive race's friendship.
<br><br>
With this friendship forged, the leader of the race agreed to the Snake Goddess's request and promised to help her out whenever she needed their support to return the favor.
<br><br>
There was no way she would summon such powerful warriors from the Other Shore if she had any other choice.
<br><br>
This situation was so unexpected. Just a moment ago, everyone was watching the two fighting and then suddenly Othniel was captured and all Eternal Realm warriors had to worry about their fates.
<br><br>
Beside her, Fuxi's eyes remained full of fighting spirit.
<br><br>
Save for the Heart-piercing Lock and a few small theurgies, this man in black wasn't that intimidating. Fuxi figured that if he truly went all out then he could defeat him.
<br><br>
Just as the two were about to make their move, Yellow Thearch's forehead split open and a burst of hearty laughter was heard.
<br><br>
"Grandmaster of Heaven! Why are you in such a hurry to descend from the Other Shore?" It was Claire from the Element Spirit race! There was no surprise on the Grandmaster of Heaven's face when he heard this voice. He'd fought with the Element Spirit race for hundreds of chaotic eras so it would be more surprising if they didn't show up.
<br><br>
A smile broke through his face. "As far as I know, you haven't found a way to descend yet."
<br><br>
Claire scoffed. "That's because they're too stupid."
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter if they are stupid or geniuses. If you don't have backup plans, just shut your mouth and admit that I've won."
<br><br>
After he spoke, the Grandmaster of Heaven lifted his Cyan Misty Sword and stabbed towards Yellow Thearch's forehead.
<br><br>
Yellow Thearch's expression changed and he revealed an incredibly charming smile. "Although we missed the Descending Rings, it doesn't mean we don't have other ways to descend!" he said in a girlish voice.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
Everyone was witness to how Yellow Thearch's hair suddenly burned and the eyeball in the center of his forehead glowed with a golden light that emitted an aura similar to that of Descending Rings.
<br><br>
They watched as his appearance, expression, and aura, all transformed into Claire's image.
<br><br>
Before the Grandmaster of Heaven could react, Claire had already stepped forward and swung Zen towards him, hard.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
A burst of blue light flashed in the Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes as he used the spatial distortion to dodge the blow.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
"Grandmaster..."
<br><br>
"That Zen can devour..."
<br><br>
The people from the Black Ship all tried to warn him but it was already too late.
<br><br>
The moment Zen touched the twisted space, he completely devoured the energy and returned the space to normal which meant he smashed onto the Grandmaster of Heaven with no hindrance whatsoever.
<br><br>
"Puff!"
<br><br>
Hit by such a formidable weapon, the Grandmaster of Heaven was sent flying into the air.
<br><br>
Claire smirked in satisfaction at this temporary weapon of hers.
<br><br>
"Fire!"
<br><br>
Sizzle! She wanted to ignite a flame but forgot the characteristics of Zen's body.
<br><br>
The fire barely flickered as it was immediately absorbed by him.
<br><br>
She made a face but did not really care. She took a step forward and reached the other side of the space. Again, she wielded Zen as a blunt weapon.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
As Zen's body smashed onto the Grandmaster of Heaven the second time, Othniel, who was bound by the Heart-piercing Lock, was also dragged down and hit the ground hard.
<br><br>
Chapter 3872 Swallow The Separate Amber Province looked like a rag. As the two fought, it began rolling, wrinkling, and tearing.
<br><br>
Creatures that resided on the rag died miserably—they didn't even have any clue what had happened. All they felt was how heaven and earth collapsed.
<br><br>
Even the few people who were aware of what happened weren't capable of resisting in a battle of this caliber.
<br><br>
The boundary wall that could only be broken down by the Eternal Realm warriors' full strength grew weak under the impact.
<br><br>
Splash! Once the south of the Separate Amber Province sank, the ground was split into two—a crack that extended millions of miles revealed the scene in the chaos.
<br><br>
The negative pressure produced as a result then attracted the chaotic clouds nearby which then swarmed toward the crack.
<br><br>
While the creatures of the Separate Amber Province could only sit still and wait for death, the Oneness Sky Palace's members still held a glimmer of hope for life.
<br><br>
The weakest disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace present were now at the Other Shore Realm, free from the threat of chaotic energy.
<br><br>
But during the battle between Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven, only a slight impact could cause them either death or injury.
<br><br>
"Everyone, run to the west!"
<br><br>
"If you get lost, head for the Pear Hill!"
<br><br>
"To the west! Go through the boundary wall!"
<br><br>
The initially indestructible boundary wall was now riddled with holes, no longer able to stop everyone from escaping.
<br><br>
Libby, Pearce, and the rest quickly organized the Oneness Sky Palace's disciples for smoother passage through it.
<br><br>
In the meanwhile, the disciples of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race all returned to their respective flying ships.
<br><br>
A battle of this level had already completely disrupted the initial plan, but so long as they made it to the Pear Hill, survival wasn't impossible.
<br><br>
All the while, Claire was occupying the Yellow Thearch's body. The Divine Farmer had just been freed from a goat monster's state, and Mahoney had died. They had no time to worry about the lives of the Holy Soul Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Splash! Another crack appeared on the ground as thousands of clods were thrown into the sky—each clod was as huge as over a hundred mountains.
<br><br>
In one of the clods, a two-winged earth dragon was curling up. Once it felt movement from outside, it quickly came out of the clod, only to find it was already high in the sky.
<br><br>
Although it had reached the True God Realm, it wasn't all that intelligent— while it was still thinking hard about what exactly was going on, a flame shot toward it.
<br><br>
When the flame was still dozens of miles away, the heat it emitted had instantly burned the earth dragon through and through.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven didn't want Othniel behind him to be any hindrance, so he simply stuffed him into another spatial treasure, the Fishing Drum. The two of them displayed incredible flexibility in a series of battles.
<br><br>
While Claire had occupied the Yellow Thearch's body through the eyeball, her strength wasn't affected in the least—she held no disadvantage in the face of the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
"Grandmaster of Heaven… This is the second time I've fought with you, isn't it? It doesn't seem like you've made any progress," Claire said with a mocking smile.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven remained composed, but he was rather surprised.
<br><br>
In terms of real strength, he was at the Eye Spirit's level—after fighting each other several times, this point was already proven.
<br><br>
But while in the Element Spirit race, Claire was ranked third in terms of strength, a great gap remained between her and the Eye Spirit. At least, the Grandmaster of Heaven wasn't taking her seriously back then.
<br><br>
In just a few chaotic eras, she had managed to grow so strong, exceeding his imagination.
<br><br>
Whoosh! While he was lost in thought, Claire used Zen to swing at him once again.
<br><br>
It had to be noted—in this state, Zen was an absolutely perfect weapon.
<br><br>
He had already managed to restrain several of the Grandmaster of Heaven's trump cards—he was a highly specialized weapon that could absorb all sorts of energy. Most importantly, it was impossible to damage him.
<br><br>
Thanks to Zen, the Grandmaster of Heaven was stuck in a passive situation.
<br><br>
After obtaining their freedom, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess flew to the southwest of the Separate Amber Province and stayed put.
<br><br>
"I thought I was the strongest in the chaos, but these two really are quite surprising…" Fuxi said resentfully, watching both Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven up in the sky.
<br><br>
"They've lived through over a thousand chaotic eras. Of course, you can't even think of comparing yourself with them," remarked the Snake Goddess calmly.
<br><br>
The Nihility race, the Element Spirit race, and even the Snake Goddess were determined to get their hands on Zen. Now that their strength proved to be unequal to the task, they had to rely on a good strategy.
<br><br>
And while the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire were distracted in battle, they had a chance.
<br><br>
As for the Black Ship, the captain wasn't watching the battle unfold.
<br><br>
If the Grandmaster of Heaven was defeated, the Black Ship would be doomed. Therefore, the captain merely had to wait for the result.
<br><br>
After all, he had something far more important to take care of.
<br><br>
Buzz! Another two Descending Rings were activated.
<br><br>
Then, two members of the Nihility race appeared before the captain.
<br><br>
One turned out to be Samantha, the Grandmaster of Heaven's disciple, and the other was the Evil God.
<br><br>
The latter glanced at the members of the Black Ship before snorting dismissively.
<br><br>
To that, the brass man's face immediately darkened. "Do you have something to say?"
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship were not to be underestimated, after all.
<br><br>
It was with the Black Ship's help that the Evil God could grow so fast, get rid of Zen, and enter the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But he'd become rather supercilious soon after getting strong.
<br><br>
"Just leave him alone. He was cocky enough when he was weak," Shera said, smiling at the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled right back at her as though they were good friends that hadn't seen each other for a time.
<br><br>
It was because of Shera that he could stay on the Black Ship—she had proven to be greatly patient.
<br><br>
"Where is the incarnation of the evil will?" Samantha chimed in and broke the tension.
<br><br>
"Come with me," said the captain, nodding at Edith.
<br><br>
Once Edith stretched out her hands, an invisible space ship enveloped everyone. The next moment, it appeared in the west of the Separate Amber Province, where the Pear Hill and the Bearing race had first fought.
<br><br>
As the Divine Farmer chased the Invisible Ship, he consumed far too much of Usman's power, leaving the latter very weak.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he was bound to the Separate Amber Province. So long as it wasn't completely destroyed, he wouldn't perish.
<br><br>
Buzz! The Invisible Ship descended.
<br><br>
All the members of the Black Ship, the Evil God, and Samantha appeared before Usman.
<br><br>
As the latter raised his hand, his gaze fell upon Shera and the Evil God.
<br><br>
From Shera, he could feel a specific kind of emotion that seemed to have something to do with him.
<br><br>
Looking at the arrogant Evil God, he saw a bit of himself.
<br><br>
"What do you want?"
<br><br>
With the group approaching aggressively, he knew something bad was about to happen.
<br><br>
But he didn't seem to feel a sense of belonging to the Bearing race. He was like a drop of oil floating in the water, impossible for him to join any kind of force.
<br><br>
If he was forced to join the Black Ship, though, he wasn't going to refuse.
<br><br>
"This is the incarnation of the Source World's evil will. You will swallow him," said Shera firmly, pointing at Usman.
<br><br>
At that, Usman was instantly shocked. He raised his head to look Shera square in the eye. He wasn't afraid of anything, not even the warriors at the Eternal Realm, but now, a cold shiver just ran down his spine.
<br><br>
Chapter 3873 Fusion Just when Usman was about to struggle, Samantha, who was standing next to him, waved her horsetail whisk gently on his body.
<br><br>
As the whisk touched Usman's face, he instantly felt his body become stiff all over.
<br><br>
He was desperately trying to utter a word, but even his mouth was paralyzed, unable to say a word.
<br><br>
"How to devour him? Do I just eat him up directly?" the Evil God said as he looked at Usman with a wicked grin.
<br><br>
Although the Evil God would not devour the human flesh, he was pretty satisfied with Usman.
<br><br>
The aura being emitted by Usman was almost exactly the same as his. That was why he thought that Usman was very suitable to be a part of him.
<br><br>
"Don't you have the ability to absorb one's soul?" Samantha asked in confusion.
<br><br>
"That's right. You just need to devour his soul," Shera added.
<br><br>
There was actually nothing wrong with devouring Usman's physical body, but the most important thing was to fuse with his soul by consuming it.
<br><br>
With that, Samantha reached out her hand towards Usman's forehead, and a ray of cyan light was released from her palm.
<br><br>
Unable to move an inch, Usman only felt a grueling gravitational force coming from Samantha's hand. His eyes rolled and his body trembled violently. Soon, his soul was gradually dragged out of his body.
<br><br>
Generally, one's soul would look the same as their physical body, and there were only a very few exceptions.
<br><br>
Usman's soul was one of them. His soul was very unique. It sort of looked like a cat with its fur standing on end and covered with soul thorns. As Samantha dragged it out, it started struggling insanely in her hand.
<br><br>
However, if his physical body wasn't able to escape from Samantha, then his soul would be much more helpless.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Samantha waved Usman's soul and quickly placed it on the Evil God's head, for it to be absorbed into his mind. In just a matter of seconds, Usman's soul was successfully integrated into the Evil God's mind.
<br><br>
Unexpectedly, as soon as Usman's soul fused with the Evil God, it struggled and even tried to take over.
<br><br>
However, Samantha didn't have any intention of helping the Evil God out.
<br><br>
Instead, she asked him to deal with it by himself.
<br><br>
"Will he be okay?" Shera asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Well, it depends on him. But he better sort it out quickly." Samantha shrugged her shoulders and didn't seem to care much about it.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the indifferent expression on Samantha's face, Shera also backed off.
<br><br>
In fact, even the entire Nihility race treated the Evil God and Usman with the same attitude. As the incarnations of the evil wills, they weren't destined to be faithful partners for their race.
<br><br>
Besides, the Nihility race just needed their identity, and it didn't matter to them whoever played the dominant role.
<br><br>
However, for Shera, it was a bit complicated. Previously, she was infatuated with the original Usman, and the two of them shared some memories. So, she had quite a mixed feeling as the current Usman's soul was given to the Evil God.
<br><br>
"We have already given so much to the Evil God. If he can't even deal with the recently reborn Usman, then we might as well support Usman instead,"
<br><br>
Samantha added.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a sharp look of pain suddenly appeared on the Evil God's face.
<br><br>
The muscles on his face twisted constantly and gave off strange expressions.
<br><br>
After a few seconds, his eyes closed and all his movements stopped. He seemed to have calmed down already.
<br><br>
Then, after a short while, he finally opened his eyes. Something definitely changed as his eyes were as deep as the ancient wells.
<br><br>
"So, you won?" Shera was the first to ask.
<br><br>
Shera felt that the Evil God didn't really change physically, but many incomprehensible expressions were contained in his eyes this time.
<br><br>
Then, the Evil God moved towards Shera. He looked at her with a peculiar expression in his eyes. "I found some strange memories."
<br><br>
"What do you mean by strange memories?" Shera asked.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the Evil God reached out his hand, touched Shera's face, and drew her straight black hair towards him. As he smelled it, there was a visible frown on his face and he said, "There's a strong stench of corpses.
<br><br>
Why does that guy find it fragrant?"
<br><br>
"W-why do you have his previous memories?" Shera stuttered as she quickly stepped back. Her pale face turned a little red.
<br><br>
The other members of the Black Ship who were present eventually realized what was going on, but were also confused as to why it happened.
<br><br>
Usman often did that to Shera in the past. He loved her scent even though it smelled like corpses. But it was obvious that the Evil God didn't like that smell.
<br><br>
"When I merged with his soul, I also found some of the memory fragments.
<br><br>
I guess the current Usman wasn't aware that these memory fragments existed within him," the Evil God explained.
<br><br>
With the appearance of the incarnation of the evil will, the memories of his previous life should have completely disappeared. Even in the Source World, that was how they viewed reincarnation because the Memory Flame had completely vanished.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that some memories from the previous life of Usman were somehow carried on. And now, even the current Evil God had them.
<br><br>
"Well, it doesn't matter. What's important is how much impact you will have on the Source World," Samantha butted in.
<br><br>
To be able to control the Source World was equivalent to controlling the core of the chaos. This was also how other Eternal Realm masters thought.
<br><br>
But of course, it was no easy task to control the largest primitive land in the chaos.
<br><br>
Moreover, there had never been an incarnation of the primitive land, so they thought that theoretically, it was impossible to gain control of it.
<br><br>
However, many primitive lands had the incarnations of evil will. Take the one in Zen's body as an example. It was so small, but the Evil God still appeared.
<br><br>
The Black Ship and the Bearing race intentionally cultivated the incarnations of the evil will for the same purpose. They wanted to control the Source World through them.
<br><br>
"My impact on the Source World, huh?"
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes narrowed as he looked at the boundary wall not far away.
<br><br>
After he devoured Usman's soul, he instantly felt that the broken boundary wall was somehow related to him.
<br><br>
Without wasting any time, the Evil God stretched out his hands towards the boundary wall.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the amber crystal clear boundary wall began to flow like melted honey.
<br><br>
Under his control, the boundary wall that stretched for hundreds of miles quickly collapsed and flowed steadily.
<br><br>
Seeing this, the other members of the Black Ship, including Shera and even Samantha, were greatly shocked.
<br><br>
After the previous Usman's appearance, he was carefully cultivated by the Black Ship.
<br><br>
At that time, Usman told them that he felt there were five stages that he could attain to improve himself.
<br><br>
When he reached the second stage, he was already able to merge with the boundary walls. It meant that he could open and close the boundary walls of the Source World.
<br><br>
He said that when he reached the third stage, he would be able to control the boundary walls at will. When that happened, even powerful Eternal Realm warriors would have a hard time dealing with him.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, as he was about to reach the third stage, he had become the rebel and was killed.
<br><br>
Eventually, the next Usman was cultivated by Yellow Thearch. But he was already devoured by the Evil God while he was still at the early level of the second stage.
<br><br>
Logically speaking, even if the Evil God had fused with Usman's soul, he would be able to reach the second stage at most. However, what they were seeing now defied logic and exceeded their expectations.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Crash! At the same moment, a huge whistling sound came from the skies above.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven suddenly appeared and was smashed down towards the boundary wall by Claire.
<br><br>
When the Evil God saw this, a pitch-black light flashed in his eyes and he stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds, the boundary wall which was flowing like a fluid suddenly began to condense into a long spear.
<br><br>
The boundary wall that was hundreds of miles wide was condensed into a nine-foot-nine-inch-long spear. He held it in his hand as it released a tremendous amount of power.
<br><br>
As Claire viciously threw the Grandmaster of Heaven down, her figure flashed and she kept chasing after him.
<br><br>
At her top speed, her body could flicker and her figure couldn't be perceived by the naked eye. Even Samantha would find it difficult to capture her.
<br><br>
However, now that the Evil God had devoured Usman, he also gained the connection to the Separate Amber Province. It meant that as long as any object was within the Separate Amber Province, he could easily tell its location in an instant. With that, he raised the long spear with his right hand, and forcefully threw it in a certain direction.
<br><br>
Chapter 3874 Taking Advantage Of The Moment It never occurred to Claire that someone would dare to attack her.
<br><br>
In her eyes, no one matched her in strength, other than the Grandmaster of Heaven and the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
She was moving to the left, as the Grandmaster of Heaven fell towards that direction.
<br><br>
However, as soon as she emerged from the space channel, a long spear shot towards her unexpectedly.
<br><br>
Boom! The spear itself was extremely sturdy, and the power contained within it was immensely great.
<br><br>
The impact from the spear sent Claire flying back into the space channel.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, she slammed into it so hard that the space channel was smashed into pieces. As she flew backwards, the space around her cracked and shattered.
<br><br>
As the Evil God waved his hand, the spear moved according to his control, dancing in the air a few times.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Finally, he had adjusted the spear enough for it to point directly towards Claire. Without any hesitation, the Evil God launched another spear attack on her.
<br><br>
Claire had been caught off guard. When she finally came to her senses and saw the spear shooting towards her, her eyes flashed with rage.
<br><br>
Whoosh! She violently swung Zen, using him to parry the incoming spear.
<br><br>
To her surprise, the spear didn't shatter, but she did manage to deflect it.
<br><br>
They stood no chance against her as long as she had her wits about her.
<br><br>
However, just as Claire had deflected the spear, the Grandmaster of Heaven appeared from behind.
<br><br>
Buzz! A ray of cyan light shot out like a delicate thread. Then, a thin chain was made out under the light. It was the Heart-piercing Lock.
<br><br>
If he managed to cast three chains, the battle would finally come to an end.
<br><br>
However, Claire's speed and strength far exceeded the expectations of the Grandmaster of Heaven. In their last battle, he was left at a complete disadvantage.
<br><br>
While the Grandmaster of Heaven tried to retreat quickly, the long spear suddenly flew to his aid.
<br><br>
He stabbed Claire through the ribs with his sword. Just as he was about to use the first chain, Claire's body suddenly transformed.
<br><br>
Fire spurted out from every orifice on her head. Her body erupted in flames, too. The flames soon enveloped Zen, rapidly moving him to the side.
<br><br>
This was Claire's true form.
<br><br>
The creatures of the Element Spirit race didn't have a clear concept of life.
<br><br>
From the moment they were born, they continued to grow in strength, devouring weaker members in the process.
<br><br>
No one knew just how many fire spirits of the Element Spirit race Claire had devoured in her lifetime. They only knew that she was a combination of all kinds of fire energy.
<br><br>
She had sensed the strength of the Grandmaster of Heaven's sword, so she quickly transformed into her real form to avoid the strike.
<br><br>
However, it slipped her mind that she was carrying Zen, a human who could somehow absorb all kinds of energy.
<br><br>
Splash! Any flame that touched Zen was quickly absorbed by him.
<br><br>
Claire was frustrated as she realized what was happening. However, she figured that Zen had a limit to how much he could absorb, so she decided to stay in her true form.
<br><br>
But the next moment, she felt the speed at which Zen was frantically absorbing her flames. She panicked. If she held on to Zen, it wouldn't be long before her whole body was absorbed by him.
<br><br>
'What the hell is with this guy?' she cried in her mind.
<br><br>
After occupying the Yellow Thearch's body, Claire had suppressed a portion of her energy.
<br><br>
Even an Eternal Realm warrior would not be able to withstand the eruption of her energy.
<br><br>
However, Zen was absorbing her flames as though they were harmless rays of sunshine. Unbelievable! At this point, Claire realized she had no other choice but to let go of Zen.
<br><br>
But by the time she loosened her grip on him, he had managed to absorb more than a third of her body! As Zen plummeted towards the ground, in the Eternal Divine Courtyard, more than thirty light pillars suddenly rose from the map surrounding the sacred cup.
<br><br>
The energy of most flames was destructive, and the rising light pillars were mostly in the area symbolizing destruction. Only a very small number of light pillars were in the areas symbolizing creation and life.
<br><br>
The four bronze statues were numb to the light pillars that came out from time to time. The man in the sacred cup was obviously different from any other creature in the past.
<br><br>
But now, more than thirty light pillars suddenly appeared, which shocked them.
<br><br>
"Is this man a monster?"
<br><br>
"Is he trying to perform some miracle?"
<br><br>
"No one has ever reached this level before!"
<br><br>
While they were shocked, their expectations of Zen grew exponentially.
<br><br>
Swoosh! After dodging the attack of the Grandmaster of Heaven, Claire took shape again. In a flash, she reached out to grab Zen once more.
<br><br>
Of course, the Grandmaster of Heaven wasn't going to let this happen. As he waved the Cyan Misty Sword, a ray of cyan light rushed towards her.
<br><br>
Just as Claire was about to close the gap between her and Zen, the cyan light spilled into the gap, effectively blocking her way.
<br><br>
Angry, Claire had no choice but to withdraw her hand. Quick witted, she used spatial transference and reappeared on the other side of Zen.
<br><br>
However, the Grandmaster of Heaven saw this coming. Just as quickly, he shook the Cyan Misty Sword again, launching a cyan light to block Claire's way.
<br><br>
As the two fought, Zen continued to fall to the ground at a dangerous speed.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was about to land, a figure poked his head out of a space fluctuation. A pair of hands suddenly emerged and plucked Zen out from the air, dragging him into the space channel.
<br><br>
Once they saw what had happened, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire were stunned for a moment.
<br><br>
"It's Fuxi!"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's expression darkened.
<br><br>
Because of Claire, he didn't have the time to finish off the two fakes.
<br><br>
Even so, he never expected they would take action while he was preoccupied with battling Claire.
<br><br>
How dare they! Just a moment earlier, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire had been fighting fiercely. Now, they wordlessly decided to join forces to go after Fuxi.
<br><br>
With Zen in his arms, Fuxi retreated back into the space channel and flew rapidly along it.
<br><br>
With his speed, it was impossible for any ordinary Eternal Realm warrior to chase him. Perhaps only the Chaos Ancient Gods could do that.
<br><br>
However, Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven were special. In a flash, the two of them also entered the space channel and caught up to Fuxi.
<br><br>
Splash! Tiny fire snakes burst out from Claire's hands one after another. These fire snakes had a mind of their own and rushed towards Fuxi in the space channel.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven also summoned cyan sword radiance directed at Fuxi.
<br><br>
Sensing their theurgies quickly closing in on him, Fuxi turned around, with Zen in front of him.
<br><br>
Click! Click! Click! The extremely sharp sword radiance and the extremely fierce fire snakes all disappeared the instant they connected with Zen's body. Fuxi smiled. He could now use Zen as a really handy protective treasure! The Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire didn't give up the chase. However, after a while, they realized they couldn't seem to catch up to Fuxi.
<br><br>
In fact, it seemed as though he was getting farther and farther away! "How is he so fast?"
<br><br>
"It seems that something is pulling him..."
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire were puzzled. They both knew that despite Fuxi's incredible strength, there was no way he could travel at that speed alone. They keenly sensed that something was yanking Fuxi forward.
<br><br>
This was true. In the space channel, a thin energy beam was wrapped around Fuxi's waist.
<br><br>
The red energy beam was actually the shadow of Snake Goddess! The shadow of Snake Goddess could extend indefinitely. Now, the Snake Goddess, who was over a hundred miles away, was dragging Fuxi forward at high speed.
<br><br>
In front of the Snake Goddess, there was a huge light sail. In order to reach this speed, the Snake Goddess was pouring most of her shadow into the light sail. The light sail then dragged her, Fuxi and Zen to quickly escape.
<br><br>
Chapter 3875 Being Stopped This Cloud Light Sail was an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token from Stage Thirty-three.
<br><br>
Theoretically, if enough energy was put into it, the Cloud Light Sail could become incredibly fast.
<br><br>
This Other Shore Token wasn't the most popular of Other Shore Tokens on Stage Thirty-three since it was helpful only during travel. But the Snake Goddess had still merged with it, and it was now coming in handy.
<br><br>
The Cloud Light Sail was fast, but the amount of energy it consumed was astonishing. It wouldn't last long even if the Snake Goddess had cast her shadow in it.
<br><br>
Fortunately, even the range of perception the strong masters like Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire had by way of their spiritual sense was limited. The Snake Goddess assumed that if they were far away from their pursuers, they would be able to escape.
<br><br>
They headed east, moving further and further away from the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire. Fuxi was relieved.
<br><br>
He had fought a good many head to head battles in the past few years, but the other Eternal Realm warriors in the Source World always gave in to him. And now, he was the one running away. It was hard for him to accept.
<br><br>
Deep in his heart, Fuxi didn't think he was incapable of fighting them. But the Snake Goddess had made a strategy and he had no choice but to follow her plan and escape.
<br><br>
Once Fuxi's spiritual sense could no longer perceive the existence of the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire, he said to the Snake Goddess, "Have we shaken them off?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was ahead of Fuxi, but her spiritual sense could perceive much more than Fuxi could.
<br><br>
"No, I'm afraid we can't get rid of them just by relying on our speed," the Snake Goddess answered calmly.
<br><br>
The distance between them was increasing but the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire had extraordinary tracking abilities that no ordinary Eternal Realm warrior could compare to. It would be difficult to get rid of them when they were in the same big province.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess stretched out two thin fingers, several small creatures appearing at her fingertips.
<br><br>
These creatures were like jellyfish, a mushroom crowning the top of their heads. The mushroom was cracked and two horns sat on top of it. Funnily enough, they looked like monsters that were making faces. Thin tentacles floated below the heads, emitting rays of light in perfect symmetry.
<br><br>
"Ghost Jellyfish Mask, transform!"
<br><br>
The Ghost Jellyfish Mask was a rare Other Shore Token on Stage Thirtythree. It could easily change into shapes of other creatures and was also an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was the incarnation of wisdom. She had cultivated several Truths of Godly Ways and had mastered several Other Shore Tokens of auxiliary type.
<br><br>
Other Shore Tokens of auxiliary type weren't strong by themselves, and ordinary people didn't want any of them to take up a Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
However, when more than one Other Shore Tokens of auxiliary type were combined, the effect they had would often be terrifying.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The Ghost Jellyfish Mask quickly turned into the reflections of the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.
<br><br>
The fake Snake Goddess was connected with the fake Fuxi using the shadow of Snake Goddess, and they were quickly sent backwards.
<br><br>
Before long, Fuxi found two identical figures of them floating in front of him too. They were also connected by a shadow of Snake Goddess as they moved forward.
<br><br>
"Let's head south!"
<br><br>
Saying thus, the Snake Goddess dragged Fuxi and headed south.
<br><br>
The fake Snake Goddesses and Fuxis were heading east and north, one pair in each direction.
<br><br>
Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven who were in hot pursuit after them felt the change at the same time. They looked at each other, stoic in their confusion.
<br><br>
Their spiritual sense could cover a long distance, easily sensing anything within a large province.
<br><br>
But once their targets moved beyond their range, they became blurry, making it difficult for them to find the true ones.
<br><br>
And the Snake Goddess had perfectly used the Ghost Jellyfish Mask to create their clones.
<br><br>
Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven had been quite confident at the beginning, but they began to panic when they suddenly found their targets head in three different directions.
<br><br>
If each of them chose a different direction, they would have only one third of the chance to capture and nail down the real targets. If one were to find the true bodies of the people they were chasing, the other would fail. This was something they were finding hard to digest.
<br><br>
'Do I have to split myself into several avatars to chase them?' Claire frowned.
<br><br>
If it weren't for Grandmaster of Heaven, she would have done that. But Zen had just absorbed one third of her body. If she did split into multiple avatars now, there was the possibility of the Grandmaster of Heaven killing her instantly.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven had the same concern. He had a secret technique with which he could create a powerful guard for himself that would have fifty percent of his strength. The downside of this technique was that his own strength would be reduced by half.
<br><br>
The two of them wordlessly flew alongside each other for some time before finally choosing to go their separate ways.
<br><br>
Claire went after the two avatars in the north, while the Grandmaster of Heaven chased the two avatars in the east. Neither made the effort to bother about the avatars in the south.
<br><br>
Luck was on Snake Goddess and Fuxi's side, who were actually heading south.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess heaved a sigh of relief on sensing the change in their pursuers' directions. "They will go farther and farther away from us," she said.
<br><br>
She infused a huge amount of energy into the two Cloud Light Sails that dragged the two fake pairs, enough for them to fly for some distance. By the time the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire found out that they were chasing in the wrong directions, it would be too late to turn back.
<br><br>
Once their targets split into three paths, Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven sped up. They had to confirm whether the targets they were chasing were real as soon as possible.
<br><br>
They gave chase for a distance before they realized that the speed of their targets was dropping.
<br><br>
"Are these fake?" Claire exclaimed, frowning.
<br><br>
She quickly shifted her attention to the targets that the Grandmaster of Heaven was chasing.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven also found that his targets had slowed down.
<br><br>
He began to shift his attention to the targets that Claire was chasing.
<br><br>
They were taken aback when they realized both of them had been chasing the wrong targets but they recovered quickly enough to turn around and head south. By this time, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had already approached the edge of the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
They would have a chance to escape once they flew out of the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were becoming more and more optimistic. If they could take Zen away like this, the risks they had taken to snatch Zen from Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven would all be worth it.
<br><br>
But they were just about to approach the boundary wall when a long spear suddenly shot out of the wall before them, taking them by surprise. .
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had been vigilant all along and had considered every possible obstruction ahead of them. But she had ignored the boundary wall.
<br><br>
She had ignored the Evil God who could control the boundary wall and detect everything that happened within the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
Boom! The spear shot through the space channel at a high speed and hit the Cloud Light Sail.
<br><br>
The Cloud Light Sail was an excellent auxiliary type of Other Shore Token, but was also very fragile. It was shattered by the long spear, causing the Snake Goddess to roll to the side and come to an abrupt stop.
<br><br>
Fuxi, who had been following behind, soon caught up with her. He stared at the boundary wall before asking, "What's wrong now?"
<br><br>
The existence that could stop the Snake Goddess had to be strong.
<br><br>
"Over there." The Snake Goddess pointed.
<br><br>
The amber liquid on the boundary wall flowed and turned into a reflection of the Evil God. The highly condensed long spear had returned to his hand.
<br><br>
"Devouring one is not enough for me. He has to stay." The Evil God pointed at Zen who was on Fuxi's shoulder.
<br><br>
"You want to court death?"
<br><br>
Fuxi said, his countenance turning cold. If it was only a young man controlling the boundary wall, the man would be no match for him.
<br><br>
Chapter 3876 Real Strength Right now, the Evil God's true body was with the members of the Black Ship hundreds of thousands of miles away.
<br><br>
After he successfully absorbed Usman's soul, he was constantly exploring his abilities.
<br><br>
At present, he could sense the existence of the Source World, but the Source World was not responding to him. With his current strength, he couldn't use the power of the Source World yet, so he could only control the province he was in.
<br><br>
Despite this, his combat effectiveness had increased to a higher level.
<br><br>
He could now accurately block the attacks of the Snake Goddess, and counterattack using his avatar on the boundary wall.
<br><br>
"Ha! Aren't you giving up? You can't kill me!" the Evil God sneered.
<br><br>
If it was any other human junior, even if they knew that they had quite an advantage, they wouldn't dare to be so arrogant in front of Fuxi.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God was different. He was afraid of no one.
<br><br>
"Let's see where your arrogance can take you!"
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Suddenly, the mark of the Eight Diagrams exploded on the surface of the Evil God's body and caused it to tremble violently.
<br><br>
At the same time, the remaining boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province also shook wildly. Fuxi immediately recognized that the impact of his attack was deflated.
<br><br>
His face darkened. He was attacking the Evil God with all his might but the power of his strike was being transferred.
<br><br>
Like Usman, the Evil God also gained the ability to use the boundary wall to block his attacks.
<br><br>
Furthermore, compared to Usman, the Evil God's technique and control were much better.
<br><br>
Usman could only transfer the power that he received to a certain part of the boundary wall. With Fuxi's massive punch, he could easily make a big hole in it.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Evil God was able to evenly distribute the power to every part of the boundary wall. That meant that it had a better chance of withstanding powerful attacks.
<br><br>
Although the boundary wall had already been riddled with countless holes, there was still a huge part that remained intact.
<br><br>
So far, the Evil God had been able to withstand even the strongest strikes that Fuxi threw at him.
<br><br>
In Fuxi's mind, he was indeed wondering how the Evil God suddenly appeared and acquired Usman's power. But the greater problem was that the Evil God was more adept in using this power than Usman.
<br><br>
"You know that it wouldn't be easy to kill me. But I could easily crush you!"
<br><br>
The Evil God suddenly reached out his hand and materialized the long amber spear.
<br><br>
Actually, the Black Ship didn't order him to intercept the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. He attacked them on his own volition because of the past grudges that he still held against them.
<br><br>
First, he still bore a huge grudge against Zen. Second, he also badly wanted to get his revenge for what Fuxi had done to him at the gate of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
He would never forget how Fuxi had humiliated him in public.
<br><br>
Now that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were right in front of him, he decided that it was the right time to retaliate.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Upon seeing the Evil God who was approaching rapidly with the amber spear, Fuxi stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
Crash! Boom! The mark of the Eight Diagrams appeared again on the surface of the Evil God's body. Fuxi's massive punch instantly exploded as soon as it touched the body of the Evil God.
<br><br>
However, this time, the Evil God didn't transfer the power of Fuxi's punch into the boundary wall. He migrated it into the end of his amber spear.
<br><br>
He used Fuxi's own power as a weapon against him.
<br><br>
The force of hundreds of thousands of divine megatons gathered at the end of the spear. The Evil God didn't need to throw the spear. With the power it contained, it left his hand and darted towards Fuxi at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
Fuxi didn't expect that the spear would rush towards him at such a fast speed in that short distance, so it was too late when he began to dodge. The spear instantly pierced through his right chest, leaving a huge bloody hole.
<br><br>
With a wave of the Evil God's hand, the spear flew back into his hand. He stared at the pitiful state of Fuxi with a devilish grin.
<br><br>
The Evil God's quick-wittedness was able to drive Fuxi to his limits.
<br><br>
At the same time, the Snake Goddess caught a glimpse of the situation. She immediately went to Fuxi and grabbed Zen's body from behind him.
<br><br>
Her body flickered again and appeared in front of the Evil God this time.
<br><br>
Without any warning, she quickly raised Zen's body and smashed it down on the head of the Evil God.
<br><br>
At such a close distance, the Evil God didn't think twice. He didn't dodge the attack, but immediately turned the tip of his spear towards her.
<br><br>
He thought that he could also use the power of the Snake Goddess, transfer it to his spear, and use it against her.
<br><br>
However, the Snake Goddess had something else in mind.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen's body touched the spear and the body of the Evil God, they quickly softened and gradually turned into amber-colored liquid. Then, Zen's body quickly absorbed the liquid.
<br><br>
The amber liquid was a kind of energy, and the boundary wall was made up of this energy and the Space Law. In essence, it was completely made up of energy.
<br><br>
Since Zen's body could absorb any kind of energy, it instantly devoured the amber liquid.
<br><br>
In no time, the avatar of the Evil God and the highly-condensed spear were both consumed.
<br><br>
"Fuxi, let's go!"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess turned around and looked at Fuxi with disappointed eyes.
<br><br>
Sometimes, Fuxi could be too reckless. If he had just kept his cool, he could have used Zen's body to block the spear just as what the Snake Goddess did.
<br><br>
Fuxi shrugged his shoulders and readied to set off with the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
However, just when both of them were about to leave the Separate Amber Province, fluctuations occurred in the space surrounding them. Then, Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven came out of the space channel.
<br><br>
"Whoa! These fakes are very like their real selves," the Grandmaster of Heaven said as soon as he saw Fuxi and the Snake Goddess. "Well, in the end, they're just fakes. Since they dared to steal something that belonged to me, they deserve to die!"
<br><br>
"Yeah. I hate deception the most!" Claire chimed in with a ferocious smile.
<br><br>
Seeing that the two wouldn't let them go without a fight, Fuxi smiled bitterly.
<br><br>
Since they wouldn't let them escape easily, they might as well have a good fight. Besides, he hated it when people referred to him as a fake.
<br><br>
"Fake, huh? Then let's see how you'll get crushed by the strength of a fake!"
<br><br>
While Fuxi's vicious eyes were fixed on the Grandmaster of Heaven, he stretched out his hand and grabbed the air. Immediately after, an Eight Diagrams disk appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
He then threw the Eight Diagrams disk in the sky. It constantly grew as it absorbed the wind, turning into a huge Eight Diagrams disk that floated in the air.
<br><br>
As the Eight Diagrams disk spun, Fuxi's aura also drastically changed.
<br><br>
Even when he was fighting with the Yellow Thearch, he didn't use all his strength.
<br><br>
But now, since they were facing two people who were much stronger than them, he had no choice but to go all out.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the shadow of Snake Goddess was also growing. Countless tentacle-like energy beams surged out and attacked the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire at the same time.
<br><br>
Although the energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess was extremely terrifying, its speed was subpar to that of the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire. That was why both of them easily avoided her attack.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire rushed towards the Snake Goddess after they successfully avoided her energy beams.
<br><br>
Just a bit earlier, these two powerful beings were fighting desperately against each other, but now they were temporarily working together.
<br><br>
However, before they could approach the Snake Goddess, a huge shadow suddenly appeared from the sky above them. A gigantic tail with a poisonous needle emerged and shot fiercely at them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3877 Element Destruction The huge tail appeared out of nowhere, and by the time Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven realized what was happening, it was too late to try to dodge it.
<br><br>
Boom! In a single blow, both of them were struck and smashed into the depths of the ground.
<br><br>
The gigantic creature floating in the sky was no other than Gerald! Earlier, Othniel had sent him to a desolate place in the chaos. However, he exhausted all his means to rush to the Separate Amber Province. Upon his return, he immediately rushed to help Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"You can go. I'll deal with them."
<br><br>
Gerald's voice boomed loudly.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid you can't deal with them alone," replied Fuxi.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?"
<br><br>
Gerald looked at Fuxi confusedly. He didn't know that Othniel had been caught by the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
The moment those words left his mouth, a violent pain shot up from his tail.
<br><br>
Splash! Suddenly, a wisp of dark red flame erupted from the surface of Gerald's tail.
<br><br>
Before Gerald had the time to react, his entire tail was burnt to a crisp by the flame.
<br><br>
At the same time, Claire's body began to transform rapidly, growing until she became a massive giant of flames. Her beautiful face was no longer visible; instead, raging flames took its place. "I didn't expect to meet such trouble when I descended the first time," she said in a muffled voice. "Well then, let's finish this once and for all!"
<br><br>
The arrival of the Grandmaster of Heaven had been part of the Black Ship's plan all along, but Claire's arrival was just an alternative plan for Yellow Thearch. Even the Yellow Thearch himself was strongly opposed to the way Claire occupied his body.
<br><br>
However, as the situation changed, the Yellow Thearch was unable to resist the enemy and finally chose to compromise. Therefore, Claire rushed in hastily, not knowing what to expect. She never thought she'd encounter so much trouble.
<br><br>
The series of unfortunate events finally exhausted her patience. In that moment, she decided she would get rid of all these problems, once and for all.
<br><br>
Splash! A line of flames appeared in the distance and spread towards them at an incredible speed. It was almost as though the flames weren't traveling through space! In the blink of an eye, the flames had shrouded half of the Separate Amber Province and even part of the province nearby.
<br><br>
"Element Destruction! Let everything here disappear!"
<br><br>
Claire rolled her shoulders backwards and lifted her arms to the sky, roaring at the top of her lungs.
<br><br>
Then, ice blue lightning flashed around her. Countless streaks of lightning lit up the sky, illuminating the world below.
<br><br>
Countless flames like red-hot clouds rained down, followed by ice spears of a few hundred thousand feet long.
<br><br>
Claire was, after all, a fire spirit comprised of countless more fire spirits.
<br><br>
The members of the Element Spirit race who had reached the same level as Claire could activate the Element Destruction with their clansmen's help.
<br><br>
All the element energies in the area would become chaotic. When the Element Destruction was displayed, it could destroy everything in the area.
<br><br>
This was one of the most powerful theurgies of the Element Spirit race.
<br><br>
Claire's plan was very simple. Zen's body could absorb almost all the energies, which meant he'd come out of this alive. The Element Destruction, however, would kill all the other irrelevant fellows in one go.
<br><br>
When the Grandmaster of Heaven saw what was happening, his face turned pale. What was Claire doing? Had she gone mad? Generally speaking, the Element Spirit race rarely ever used Element Destruction.
<br><br>
The members of the Element Spirit race didn't have physical bodies. They were all creatures formed from elements. Thus, the Element Destruction would consume their bodies. The risk was just too great.
<br><br>
Within the range of Element Destruction, Gerald was the largest and the first to feel its attacks.
<br><br>
Initially, Gerald didn't take it seriously. Although its destructive power was astonishing, it was easy to display such power if the Eternal Realm warriors used their bloodline to the extreme.
<br><br>
Gerald was under the impression that the Element Destruction was on the same level as the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy.
<br><br>
With his outstanding healing ability, it was useless even if ten strong warriors on the same level as Emperor Charm used the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy simultaneously.
<br><br>
However, when the flames licked at Gerald's body, he began to feel something was wrong.
<br><br>
While his black shell was extremely solid, the flames were causing cracks to form on it.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the flames only lasted a moment, but the lightning bolts were like countless little earthworms that drilled into his body ruthlessly.
<br><br>
Buzz! A bright green light was released from Gerald's body. The wounds inside and outside his body quickly healed. His tail, which had been cut off by Claire, also regenerated.
<br><br>
However, the Element Destruction kept on attacking. Claire was going to stop at nothing until everything in this area was destroyed.
<br><br>
A larger size would definitely attract more attacks. After Gerald realized this, his body began to shrink rapidly. He turned into a black scorpion the size of a person and rushed towards Claire.
<br><br>
As a Chaos Ancient God who controlled the truth of life, Gerald had the ability to create lives and conversely, destroy lives. The latter involved poisons.
<br><br>
However, these poisons were completely different from the usual ones. The poison surging through Gerald's yellow and green tail was called the Poison of Decomposition.
<br><br>
This type was so lethal that it could poison not only creatures, but also substances.
<br><br>
Once the substances, including those things without forms like souls and energies, were infected with the Poison of Decomposition, they would, as the name implied, start decomposing immediately.
<br><br>
Even if Claire was now in the form of a fire giant, Gerald still had the potential to defeat her.
<br><br>
However, before Gerald could even get close, the energy of Element Destruction swept towards him like a snowstorm, forcing him to take a few steps back.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven had already summoned the Six Soul Flags. At the same time, he placed the Cyan Misty Sword in front of him with a pair of golden scissors in his hand.
<br><br>
Flood dragons twined around the scissors, flashing a dazzlingly bright gold.
<br><br>
It was another magic treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven: the Golden Dragon Scissors.
<br><br>
It could cut through almost anything, even energy.
<br><br>
However, the power of the Element Destruction gradually increased. While the Grandmaster of Heaven was still able to resist it, he knew he had to do something drastic if he wanted to make it out of this alive.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were at a disadvantage. Although the two of them were working together, their strength was relatively weak compared to the others. Their only advantage was Zen.
<br><br>
Fuxi stood in front of the Snake Goddess and placed Zen in front of him. At the same time, the Snake Goddess used her shadow to form a circular enchanted barrier to protect them.
<br><br>
Fuxi kept turning around, trying his best to use Zen as a shield to block the energy.
<br><br>
However, the attacks came from all directions. There was no way he'd be able to block all of them.
<br><br>
The slightest mistake could cause the Snake Goddess's enchanted barrier to collapse, rendering them vulnerable to the attacks of the Element Destruction.
<br><br>
Chapter 3878 Kill With Poison Faced with such a crisis, the Snake Goddess was also focusing her entire concentration on the fight. It wouldn't have been possible to catch her off guard right now.
<br><br>
As soon as the enchanted barrier was broken, she instantly activated another one. This blood red enchanted barrier was seemingly as fragile as an eggshell for now, but it was once known as the toughest enchanted barrier in the Source World.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, things had changed! Just as the second enchanted barrier was activated, it was able to only slightly block the incoming flames before shattering to pieces again.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, the Snake Goddess activated several more enchanted barriers.
<br><br>
Six of them were out forward in a row to block the energy that was swarming over towards the team.
<br><br>
The truth was, only a small portion of the energy was being blocked, while most of it was being absorbed by Zen.
<br><br>
"Let's move. We'll try to get close to the edge of this area," the Snake Goddess suggested.
<br><br>
Fuxi instantly understood what she meant. He grabbed her, flew to the side, and was almost instantly at the edge of the area.
<br><br>
Once they got close to the edge, they placed Zen's body in front of them.
<br><br>
The power of Element Destruction could only surge from one direction, and with Zen's body in front, it would naturally be completely absorbed by him.
<br><br>
With his body, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had created a small safe haven for themselves.
<br><br>
Claire noticed this, but at the moment, her main opponents were not these two. Rather, she was facing the Grandmaster of Heaven and Gerald.
<br><br>
"Now that you have shown your own abilities, let's see how long you can hold out with those!" Claire roared.
<br><br>
The power of Element Destruction was divided into seven levels, and at the moment, Claire was using the third level. Even then, it was incredibly powerful.
<br><br>
So much so that apart from the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Zen, Gerald, and the Grandmaster of Heaven, no other living being could be seen in this area.
<br><br>
Every single part of space had been torn apart by the overwhelming elemental energy.
<br><br>
"The fourth level!"
<br><br>
Splash! With a burst of extraordinary power, a huge column of swirling wind began to spin in the center of the space, accompanied by intense lightning and flames. As the flames spun with the wind, it looked like they were creating a fiery localized cyclone that would devour everything in its path.
<br><br>
When the flames swept over Gerald, layers upon layers of embedded carapaces began to grow on his body.
<br><br>
They were a powerful defensive mechanism which could greatly lower the efficiency of the Element Destruction, protecting Gerald's body from much harm.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven kept a straight face. The Golden Dragon Scissors in his hand instantly shattered all the energy that was trying to approach him.
<br><br>
"The fifth level!"
<br><br>
Once the Element Destruction reached the fifth level, Claire's huge body began to shrink down at a visible speed.
<br><br>
She had come there with the Yellow Thearch's body. Now, she was consuming her own strength as well as the Yellow Thearch's to fight.
<br><br>
Since she had already activated the Element Destruction now, she had no intention of giving up. She wasn't going to stop until all of these pesky people in front of her had been turned to ash! The Snake Goddess and Fuxi curled up together behind Zen, who was still protecting them.
<br><br>
The power of the Element Destruction at the fifth level was already quite terrifying. If it weren't for Zen, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi wouldn't have been able to hold on even for just a few minutes under such extreme pressure.
<br><br>
Even the Grandmaster of Heaven and Gerald found it difficult to resist this power.
<br><br>
If Claire decided to activate the sixth or seventh level, then there was no telling how powerful she was going to be! They could die if that happened! And then misfortune struck further! While Gerald was lost in thought, he suddenly heard Claire say in a cold voice, "The sixth level!"
<br><br>
Then, the power of the Element Destruction was further enhanced.
<br><br>
Obviously, with the enhancement came its price as well. Claire couldn't hold on for too long now, and her huge body was now shrinking rapidly.
<br><br>
But her opponents were going to be able to hold on for an even shorter time.
<br><br>
Crack! A thin bolt of lightning drilled into Gerald's body. Under the effect of the Element Destruction, this seemingly ordinary bolt of lightning had become extremely powerful. It easily penetrated through his carapaces and went all the way through his body, coming out of his back like a slithering snake.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was also in a fix now. Although he was managing to hold on with a few extremely powerful magic treasures for the time being, once Claire activated the seventh level of her move, even he would be in great danger.
<br><br>
Near the edge of the area, the explosive power of the elements surged into Zen's body like a tidal wave.
<br><br>
These elements were the most basic ones, but with the efforts the Element Spirit race had made across countless years, they had evolved into numerous different types.
<br><br>
For example, Claire's real body itself was formed from dozens of kinds of flames. Therefore, after Zen had absorbed one third of her real body, more than thirty light pillars had risen in the map.
<br><br>
Claire was borrowing the power of the other members of the Element Spirit race to activate the Element Destruction. Each of the elements had about thirty to forty types.
<br><br>
In the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the map under the sacred cup suddenly began to respond to the immense energy surge. This time, there were more than 130 light pillars extending all at the same time.
<br><br>
The statues on the four pillars exchanged some curious glances with each other, but fell silent afterwards. Whatever was happening in front of them was beyond their comprehension.
<br><br>
The changes in the map had exceeded all they had ever expected or been trained for. They had nothing left to say or do.
<br><br>
"The seventh level!"
<br><br>
Claire finally decided to use the seventh level power of the Element Destruction, and now, she had no intentions of making any considerations for the Yellow Thearch. After she released the immense power, her own strength was going to suffer a heavy blow, and the Yellow Thearch's body suffered an even more tragic end. Chances were that his body would never be able to come back to its original form.
<br><br>
However, just as Claire was about to release the seventh level power, the Grandmaster of Heaven suddenly made a move, and a cube appeared in front of him with a flash. At the same time, another cube also appeared in Claire's body, and a third one surrounded Gerald.
<br><br>
The three spaces where these three characters were suddenly turned into one, which was also a kind of theurgy of the space truth.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven joined hands with Claire a moment ago, but now he had no choice but to use Gerald's power. The moment Gerald was enveloped in the cube, he had appeared in Claire's body. Without any hesitation, he pierced his tail through the cube and stabbed at Claire.
<br><br>
Energy with two different colors, yellow and green, quickly spread through Claire's body.
<br><br>
The Poison of Decomposition had an extremely rapid and powerful effect on soul and energy based bodies, and was far less effective on creatures with physical bodies.
<br><br>
As the Poison of Decomposition spread around quickly, Claire's huge body quickly collapsed, and pretty soon, disappeared into nothingness.
<br><br>
"You... You..."
<br><br>
Claire had never expected that the Grandmaster of Heaven would be bold enough to send Gerald directly into her body, nor had she expected that the latter's Poison of Decomposition would be so deadly.
<br><br>
Within a short period of time, the Poison of Decomposition had spread throughout her entire body, and coursed through all her veins. In a moment, her body was completely decomposed.
<br><br>
As the Poison of Decomposition spread over her head, Claire finally realized that she could do nothing to regain her winning position now. She raised her head, and a golden eyeball shot into the sky and disappeared.
<br><br>
Far away, the golden eyeball appeared in front of the Divine Farmer. Then a tattered body formed near the eyeball and slowly took a misshapen shape. It was none other than the body of the Yellow Thearch which had been occupied by Claire for a long time. Nothing but a twisted form was left now.
<br><br>
After the eyeball was gone, Claire's huge body instantly dissipated, and the power of the Element Destruction never managed to reach the seventh level. It began to weaken and dissipate, and finally everything was calm once again.
<br><br>
Chapter 3879 Half Of The Light Columns At that moment, Gerald quickly turned into an oval cocoon to protect himself from the Element Destruction.
<br><br>
The Element Destruction then hit the cocoon, which became charred and carbonized.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the Element Destruction stopped. The charred part of the cocoon cracked then a pinkish tender body came out of it. The body immediately stiffened and turned into a shiny black shell upon coming out.
<br><br>
It looked like Gerald had recovered to normal, but in reality, he had exhausted all of his strength. He was already quite weak.
<br><br>
On the contrary, the Grandmaster of Heaven, who was nearby, looked a lot better than Gerald. He was unharmed since he relied on a few magic treasures to protect himself, but he still had to maintain the Heart-piercing Lock to restrain Othniel.
<br><br>
The amount of energy used by the Heart-piercing Lock was not significant, but the Grandmaster of Heaven had consumed a large amount of energy to resist the Element Destruction. Thus, it wasn't easy to maintain the Heartpiercing Lock as it was before.
<br><br>
Therefore, the Grandmaster of Heaven's overall situation wasn't actually much better than Gerald's.
<br><br>
Far away from them, after the Snake Goddess withdrew the blood-red enchanted barrier, she and Fuxi slowly appeared behind Zen.
<br><br>
Fuxi took a deep breath, but his eyes still twitched.
<br><br>
The energy he released when he used the marks of Eight Diagrams was the strongest kind of power in the Source World. Furthermore, he thought that since he had gone to numerous battles in the Three Purities Stage, there was nothing to fear.
<br><br>
But he was utterly shocked when the Element Destruction happened.
<br><br>
The Element Destruction didn't affect a large area, and only half of the province got hit, but the force that struck the province was far beyond what he had imagined.
<br><br>
Was that how powerful that member from the Element Spirit race was? "Let's go!" the Snake Goddess shouted.
<br><br>
She looked at the distance and quickly pulled Fuxi while she activated the Grand Teleportation. After she opened a space channel, the two of them went inside.
<br><br>
A smile graced the Grandmaster of Heaven's face when he saw them escape hurriedly. Then, he followed them.
<br><br>
Claire, who was the most troublesome to deal with, was gone, and Gerald was already weak. The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were just like mice.
<br><br>
Everything would be under his control.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The moment the Grandmaster of Heaven moved, Gerald's tail suddenly stabbed him. The tail's poisonous needle glowed with a cyan light, which was another kind of deadly poison.
<br><br>
In turn, the Grandmaster of Heaven abruptly turned around and revealed a mocking smile. At the same time, a cyan ray of light flashed and hit Gerald's tail.
<br><br>
Crack! Once again, the cyan light sliced Gerald's tail.
<br><br>
As soon as his tail fell off, black flames engulfed his body.
<br><br>
It was difficult to kill a Chaos Ancient God, especially if it was someone like Gerald, who had unparalleled life energy.
<br><br>
Still, the black flames that enveloped him were enough to restrain him for a while.
<br><br>
Since Gerald couldn't escape, he had no choice but to produce more body tissues to isolate the uncontrollable black flames from his body. It was indeed impossible for him to chase after the Grandmaster of Heaven in this situation.
<br><br>
In the end, the Grandmaster of Heaven successfully went into the space channel and chased the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.
<br><br>
On the boundary wall not far away, the Evil God's body took shape once more.
<br><br>
The spear and body he had previously condensed with the boundary wall had long since disappeared in the Element Destruction. Moreover, he felt quite regretful when he saw Fuxi have taken Zen away and left the Separate Amber Province.
<br><br>
For him, it would be best if the warriors killed each other in the Element Destruction, then that was when he would finally show up and devour everyone else—including the Grandmaster of Heaven! Unfortunately, things didn't turn out the way he planned. Now, even Zen had run away.
<br><br>
He wasn't sure if the Grandmaster of Heaven would have any issues if he devoured Zen. If the Grandmaster of Heaven caught Zen, he probably wouldn't hand Zen over.
<br><br>
What was worse for him was that his power only worked within the Separate Amber Province. If he went beyond the boundary wall, the body formed by the boundary wall would collapse. Thus, he could not follow them.
<br><br>
In the darkness, Zen saw more and more mountain-like light dots, which continued to get closer to him.
<br><br>
At first, the light dots lined up in an almost random way. As they increased, however, he gradually discovered that the light dots seemed to convey some sort of information.
<br><br>
There was a kind of violent energy inside the light dot nearest to him. When his consciousness touched the light dot, he felt an intense burning sensation, as if there was fire trapped inside it.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the light dot on the far left felt extremely cold. He would be frozen if he approached it.
<br><br>
The energy inside the light dots was quite pure and primitive. It was so pure that it didn't seem to be energy at all, but rather a creature.
<br><br>
Since he got trapped in the darkness, the light dots continuously increased at random speeds. Sometimes it was fast, and sometimes it was slow. They also increased by varying numbers, as sometimes only a few new ones came up, sometimes it was a dozen. Most incredibly, nearly more than a hundred new light dots appeared not long ago.
<br><br>
He couldn't figure out the rules at first, but as the number of light dots increased, the rules got revealed.
<br><br>
Some of the light dots contained the power of space and time. The other light dots that were connected to them had the same attributes and were arranged in an orderly fashion.
<br><br>
There was a gap between the light dots that were together. He guessed it was because there were other light dots with a similar energy that hadn't lit up.
<br><br>
Would he only get to leave this dark space when all the light dots had lit up? He could only wonder.
<br><br>
But how did the light dots light up anyway? Did it all depend on luck, or was there a pattern he had yet to comprehend? He couldn't do anything after he entered this dark space, except to wait quietly.
<br><br>
In the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the four bronze statues began to discuss intensely after a moment of silence.
<br><br>
"There are already one hundred and eighty-six light columns that have lit up. Do you remember the legend that once spread in the Eternal Divine Courtyard?" the bronze bird asked the bronze monkey.
<br><br>
"When the number of light columns that have lit up is more than half of the total number, the ancestry-level bloodline would automatically become complete?" "Yes, I remember! There was indeed such a legend! I just thought that such a thing couldn't possibly happen at that time. I simply thought it was a story," the bronze human said excitedly. The other bronze statues also became ecstatic when the bronze bird asked the question.
<br><br>
At that time, only a few creatures were qualified to enter the sacred cup.
<br><br>
Furthermore, even fewer of them could light up a dozen light columns in the map.
<br><br>
If half of the light columns or one hundred and eighty-seven light columns to be exact have lit up, then the remaining light columns would automatically rise to complete the bloodline map.
<br><br>
Now with one more column to light up, the number would reach half.
<br><br>
What if the legend was true? How strong would the ancestry-level bloodline be in its complete state? The four bronze statues all had the same thought. If they could see it with their own eyes, then it would be worth even if they would end up dead.
<br><br>
At that point, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were still running like mad in the space channel while they carried Zen.
<br><br>
Although the Snake Goddess had condensed the Cloud Light Sail again, it took some time for the sail to speed up. During that period, the Grandmaster of Heaven had already caught up with them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3880 The Purple Lightening Hammer The Cyan Misty Sword cut through space silently and sent a straight cyan light from the void which hit the Cloud Light Sail.
<br><br>
Splash! With the Cloud Light Sail slashed, a large hole appeared in the center as it began to collapse from the inside out.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had just sped up but now came to sudden dead stop.
<br><br>
"Those two fakes are really quite powerful," remarked the Grandmaster of Heaven. "But that's it. I've had enough!"
<br><br>
He had once feared the real Fuxi.
<br><br>
But since joining the Nihility race, he had improved his strength immensely and could now kill ordinary warriors at the Eternal Realm effortlessly.
<br><br>
Now, even the real Fuxi was no match for him, let alone his avatar.
<br><br>
But the two avatars' tenacity exceeded the Grandmaster of Heaven's expectations.
<br><br>
He raised the Cyan Misty Sword and the sword radiance soared up into the sky. From his body burst an intense aura powerful enough to pierce through the heaven and earth.
<br><br>
A mark of Eight Diagrams then covered him, just as he brandished his sword.
<br><br>
Fuxi had quick fists and so the fist radiance would be released as soon as the mark of Eight Diagrams appeared.
<br><br>
Before the Grandmaster of Heaven even knew what was going on, he had already been struck by Fuxi's terrifying fist radiance.
<br><br>
Boom! Caught off guard, the Grandmaster of Heaven was flung in the distance.
<br><br>
"Seal! Limitless Power!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! The Eight Diagrams disk above Fuxi's head rotated and countless marks of Eight Diagrams, both small and large, condensed all over the Grandmaster of Heaven's body.
<br><br>
Fuxi was like a beast rushing at its prey; every muscle in his body swelled and his shoulder blades raised high like little wings.
<br><br>
The Limitless Power was one of the Eight Diagrams disk's unique techniques. He could use the Eight Diagrams disk to maximize his bloodline and summon triple his base power in a short period of time.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess interlocked her fingers and strands of crimson light flowed and flashed from her fingertips.
<br><br>
"Faceless Phantom!"
<br><br>
Sizzle! Suddenly, a dark faceless figure appeared on the other side of the Grandmaster of Heaven. Although it had no visible face, its appearance and aura were the same as Fuxi's.
<br><br>
This was the effect of the Faceless Phantom; it could create an identical phantom within a certain range which possessed all the power of its real counterpart. In this way, Fuxi could double his attack power.
<br><br>
The air froze for around three seconds and he paused. Then, his hands transformed into numerous shadows, charging at the Grandmaster of Heaven at blistering speed, the phantom mirroring both him and his speed.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! The fist radiance exploded when it came into contact with the marks of Eight Diagrams. The shock waves that resonated from the impact tore everything in the surrounding spaces apart and decimated them to pieces as small as a grain of sand. They were so small that they looked like smoke as they shot and spread out in all directions.
<br><br>
Fuxi kept this relentless pummeling up for five minutes straight.
<br><br>
Spurred on by the Limitless Power, a single punch could seriously injure an Eternal Realm master, and it would take five punches at most to kill him for sure.
<br><br>
In five minutes, he had struck out heaps of times.
<br><br>
When the Limitless Power was depleted, the Eight Diagrams disk floating above Fuxi's head dimmed. The swelling in his muscles went down and he shrunk to his normal height, breathing heavily and exhausted as he returned to his ordinary state.
<br><br>
The eruption of such incredible power caused his body to emit a ridiculous amount of heat. A piece of raw meat would be scorched instantly if put anywhere near him.
<br><br>
The sand sized fragments slowly dissipated, gradually revealing the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyes widened when he saw that he had come out of it unscathed.
<br><br>
He was well aware that he was powerful and so he had held nothing back.
<br><br>
He thought that even if he could not kill the Grandmaster of Heaven, he had certainly done enough to make him suffer.
<br><br>
But the truth was far from what he had imagined.
<br><br>
"Well," began the Grandmaster of Heaven, smiling ever so slightly, "in comparison to the rest, you may very well possess the most strength during the last several hundred chaotic eras. I think it's safe to say you're powerful enough to be the Son of Truth in the next round of chaos."
<br><br>
"Unfortunately, there won't be a next round of chaos," he continued, shrugging his shoulders.
<br><br>
Buzz! He lifted his Cyan Misty Sword and countless cyan lights rained down on the Snake Goddess and Fuxi like a storm.
<br><br>
They fell in straight lines and were so scattered that some of them were not aimed at them.
<br><br>
But then, a small cube formed in the Grandmaster of Heaven's eye and those cyan lights changed their path and headed straight for Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Keep your distance from the lights!"
<br><br>
With Zen in one hand and the other holding the Snake Goddess, Fuxi flew downward to avoid the cyan lights.
<br><br>
They then refracted once more, turning and shooting at Fuxi.
<br><br>
Unable to dodge, he lifted Zen and placed him on his head.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! The cyan sword lights came down Zen's body like a dense rainfall. His body absorbed the sword lights' energy like a black hole and was left barely damaged.
<br><br>
However, as he had already absorbed the cyan sword lights before, no new light column rose in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
Seeing this, the Grandmaster of Heaven frowned and shot more cyan sword lights, at the same time flashing the cube in his eye and refracting the cyan sword lights further to let them come at Fuxi from all directions.
<br><br>
Fuxi spun Zen in his hands, rotating him like a wheel. He couldn't quite come up with a way to deal with the Grandmaster of Heaven. But with Zen as an invincible shield, he could defend himself rather well.
<br><br>
Da! Da! Da! No matter how many times the cyan sword lights were refracted and no matter which angle they came from, Zen took them all.
<br><br>
"It seems that you've gotten ahead of yourself, Grandmaster of Heaven,"
<br><br>
Fuxi said, shrugging with a smile.
<br><br>
They hadn't confirmed the Grandmaster of Heaven's identity until they had heard how Claire addressed him. They then had a rough idea of who he was.
<br><br>
Even at an absolute disadvantage and on the defensive, Fuxi didn't panic.
<br><br>
Instead, there was a shrewd smile across his face.
<br><br>
Obviously, the Grandmaster of Heaven was as powerful as the Chaos Ancient Gods. He had possibly even slightly surpassed them. If Fuxi hoped to defeat such an opponent, he would have to remain on the defensive and wait patiently to exploit his few flaws once they were exposed.
<br><br>
When Fuxi had finished speaking, his smile slowly retreated and his intense seriousness returned.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven stretched out his hand and a big purple hammer materialized in it. It was another of his powerful magic treasures, the Purple Lightening Hammer.
<br><br>
Chapter 3881 Completely Absorbing This was the most formidable magic treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven. When he yielded the handle of the Purple Lightening Hammer securely in his grip, the lightning snake emitting extremely daunting aura coiled itself around it till it reached the surface of the hammer.
<br><br>
Sizzle...
<br><br>
The breathtakingly eminent aura radiating from the pure purple lightning made the onlookers gasp in awe.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess remained rooted to their spots, and their pupils shrank visibly at this sight. Apparently, they too felt intimidated by the daunting presence of the Purple Lightening Hammer.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven seemed unbothered and refused to hold back.
<br><br>
He had attempted to catch the two for quite a long time without tasting the sweet nectar of success. Because of that, his patience had run out, and there was no longer any room for error.
<br><br>
When the black fire was extinguished by Gerald, he would catch up again.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven feared if he didn't act quickly, everything he worked so hard for would slip away from his hands once more.
<br><br>
Boom! The Grandmaster of Heaven glared at the space ahead of him and raised his hammer before smashing it into thin air.
<br><br>
Visually, there was nothing in front of him.
<br><br>
But when he swung the hammer in the air, it seemed to have hit an obstruction that was indestructible. As a result, the collision sent down shockwaves as it experienced violent tremors. The repercussions were so severe that they pushed back the Grandmaster of Heaven a few steps.
<br><br>
Amidst the wild outburst of the explosion, countless bolts of thin purple lightning gathered and morphed themselves into the shape of a thick lightning snake that charged towards Fuxi.
<br><br>
Crack! Acting on his sharp reflexes, Fuxi took the initiative and lifted Zen up right in the nick of time.
<br><br>
Buzz! The moment the lightning snake came in contact with Zen's body, it switched its previous ferocious form and transformed into many purple lightning flowers. Within a flash, Zen had absorbed more than half of the energy of the purple lightning snake, causing its intensity to weaken.
<br><br>
However, after the lightning snake jumped on Zen's body once, the rest of it switched its course of direction to pounce at Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack...
<br><br>
It was one of the attributes of thunder and lightning. Once a bolt of lightning was released, it would jump several times before coming to a stop.
<br><br>
Even though it was weakened by Zen absorbing more than half of its energy, the remaining energy of the purple lightning snake still posed as a severe threat to Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
When the lightning snake bounced off of him a third time, its energy was reduced substantially. Even so, when it struck the Snake Goddess, it sent her lightweight body flying high before she fell to the ground with a heavy thump.
<br><br>
The moment Fuxi's body was thrown off like a ragdoll, Zen's physical body lost contact with him as he was forced to let go of his hand.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of the circumstances, the Grandmaster of Heaven reached out to grab Zen. However, the energy formed due to the space fluctuation was consumed by Zen's body before he could lay his hands on him. How could he catch him now? Frustrated by the constant delays, the Grandmaster of Heaven frowned before executing the Grand Teleportation technique to directly appear beside Zen. Only then did he manage to grab Zen and he carried him on his shoulder.
<br><br>
After securing Zen, the Grandmaster of Heaven had no business left with Fuxi or the Snake Goddess. He could just ignore them and move on.
<br><br>
But when he began to recall all the unnecessary trouble these two had caused him, a wild fit of rage began to consume every fiber of his being.
<br><br>
With a tight grip on his Purple Lightening Hammer, he charged in the direction of Fuxi's motionless body with a newly found desire for revenge.
<br><br>
Surrounded by darkness, Zen was still recovering from his daze.
<br><br>
Although he had no sense of direction on what he should do, he decided he could not just sit back and watch anymore.
<br><br>
The appearance of those light dots gave off the impression that they were connected to him in some way. However, they did not rely on his sheer will, and they didn't seem to be affected by the depth of his comprehension either.
<br><br>
He had thought long and hard about it, but he still failed to come up with a logical conclusion to interpret the situation.
<br><br>
Buzz! Another light dot flickered freely in the air as it lit up.
<br><br>
Zen's consciousness quickly swept across the light dot.
<br><br>
As per his analysis, it only contained the explosive power of both thunder and lightning...
<br><br>
Zen's consciousness did not linger on this light dot.
<br><br>
In fact, the energy entrapped in each light dot was free of all impurities and thus was formidable. As long as he could figure out a way to gain control of even one of them, he could bear the fruit of pure primitive power.
<br><br>
However, Zen was overwhelmed by the presence of so many light dots dominating the space. It so happened that this was only one of the over 180 light dots.
<br><br>
In his confusion, Zen didn't realize there were a total of 187 light dots after this one was lit up! Meanwhile, within the boundaries of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the bronze monkey couldn't contain his excitement as he watched this scene unfold. He kept jumping up and down enthusiastically.
<br><br>
In contrast to the bronze monkey, the bronze bird, the bronze snake, and the bronze human maintained their composure. However, the intensity of the sparkle igniting in their eyes testified their increasing expectations.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was pure. But at the very same time, it had lost all of its distinctive characteristics.
<br><br>
It was the creatures that had entered the sacred cup that had once again made the ancestry-level bloodline complete. Simultaneously, it became complicated and also managed to reclaim its once lost characteristics! "The 187th light column has risen!" the bronze human murmured, concealing his apparent excitement.
<br><br>
Each of them was at the edge of their seats, anticipating whether the legend could finally come true.
<br><br>
Although their growing excitement was undeniable, they still harbored concerns in a deep corner of their existence.
<br><br>
After all, legends were sometimes nothing more than myths altered through history...
<br><br>
The remaining light columns seemed to have no intention of rising.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the deep pits of darkness, Zen felt his consciousness slowly sink into an unusual state, which he had never experienced before.
<br><br>
In fact, after each light dot appeared before him, Zen sensed a more indepth understanding build up in his mind about the energy it carried inside.
<br><br>
But after that light dot rose up just now, something far stranger happened.
<br><br>
He could feel the light dots which connected to his left and right sides, and deduce those that did not exist! It all came naturally to him. It was as if right after someone counted from one to four, without a hitch, Zen began to count from five to eight.
<br><br>
Buzz! Completely engulfed in this strange state of deduction, those dots of light that didn't exist suddenly appeared and stationed themselves in their spots! One, two, three...
<br><br>
In the map, one after the other, many light pillars began to extend at a frightening yet even speed! Previously the light pillars in the map made a sudden appearance, but then they stopped growing just as abruptly as they came. Now that the other light pillars appeared with a constant speed, there was definitely something mysterious about this! "Is it finally starting?"
<br><br>
"Is this really happening?"
<br><br>
"The moment that was once witnessed by history repeats itself. That legend is true!"
<br><br>
The four statues couldn't help themselves, wanting to get a closer look at the incredible scene taking shape right in front of them. Each of them left the pillars again and walked to the edge of the square to feast their eyes on something they had waited for desperately to happen.
<br><br>
In a short while, the remaining 186 light pillars had gradually risen one after the other.
<br><br>
In the map, below the sacred cup, the light pillars were arranged in equal proportions, and they were evenly distributed on every portion, forming a pattern.
<br><br>
When the very last light column connected itself with the others, the map became flawless! Purr...
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline in the sacred cup began to boil and drill into Zen's body. The thick blood in the cup emptied itself at an alarming speed as if rushing to familiarize itself with his body.
<br><br>
Ever since the ancestry-level bloodline existed in the Eternal Divine Courtyard, it had never decreased.
<br><br>
Instead of saying that one fused with the ancestry-level bloodline within the sacred cup at will, it was more accurate to say that the ancestry-level bloodline gave the warrior who entered the sacred cup the powerful bloodline and unfathomable power...
<br><br>
But this time was different.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline actually drilled itself into Zen's body willingly.
<br><br>
The ancestry-level bloodline was as thick as glue. When it moved along Zen's meridians, his meridians bulged out in such a way that it looked as if a little rat was frantically moving along them.
<br><br>
Zen could endure the massive volume of blood pouring into him because of his astonishingly strong body. If his body fell short of the requirement and was weaker than it was, his meridians would probably burst open due to not being able to hold it all in.
<br><br>
After a short while, all the blood that originally filled up the sacred cup had been emptied into Zen's body.
<br><br>
At this sight, the four bronze statues' mouths fell to the ground with utter astonishment. Silence reigned the air before the bronze bird took the initiative and spoke, "Has the ancestry-level bloodline... been possessed by him?"
<br><br>
Judging by the bronze bird's growing grim expression, he seemed to be thirsting for the ancestry-level bloodline that was now possessed by Zen.
<br><br>
The increasing desperation in his eyes felt like he was eager to cut open Zen's belly to extract all of it for himself.
<br><br>
The bronze snake beside him had a similar intention. Although they were happy to see Zen create such a miracle, it was difficult for them to digest the fact that he took away all of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"Well, let him take it!"
<br><br>
The bronze monkey, who had been very radical from the start, seemed to have thought of something. His eyes flashed in response to his emotions and reflected a different color, as if he was expecting something big to happen.
<br><br>
Chapter 3882 Return In most cases, they say that eternity was nothing but a synonym for destruction.
<br><br>
"Running water is never stale, and a door hinge never gets worm-eaten."
<br><br>
Only something so dynamic could achieve genuine eternity.
<br><br>
This was inside the thoughts of the bronze monkey.
<br><br>
If there was not a single blood-receiver that could enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard, then the place would lose the purpose of its existence.
<br><br>
After the Eternal Divine Courtyard was sealed by the Time Lock, it was regarded to be worthless and was just something that awaited its impending destruction.
<br><br>
But in the end, this human unexpectedly broke in and soaked himself into the sacred cup without hesitation.
<br><br>
With this, this human actually extended the lifespan of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Now, changes that were never foreseen should be expected.
<br><br>
The bronze human also had the same thought, so he immediately stopped the bronze bird and the bronze snake.
<br><br>
After some time, the four bronze statues came to an agreement. In the meantime, they would quietly observe the sacred cup and see what would happen.
<br><br>
Still shrouded in darkness, all of the light dots that appeared in front of Zen had been completely lit up. They were arranged in such a way that they formed four neat triangles together.
<br><br>
At this time, the meanings contained within the light dots were all grasped by Zen.
<br><br>
'The meaning of power is completely beyond the limits of the chaos.' Zen was immersed in this thought.
<br><br>
The power of the three thousand Godly Ways was based on the most original power of the chaos, which was also the foundation of the entire chaos. On the other hand, the three hundred and seventy-three entities of power in the light dots were way more extensive and profound. They covered wider ranges and were formed based on rules of higher levels.
<br><br>
They could even be called the origin of everything.
<br><br>
Inside Zen's mind, this information flashed like bolts of lightning. All of a sudden, he seemed to have a fair understanding of everything.
<br><br>
Whoosh! All of the lights intensely brightened as Zen's eyes snapped open.
<br><br>
Eventually, he regained all of his six senses. He had a brief struggle to adapt as his consciousness gradually returned. It was like the sensation of being awakened from a very long dream.
<br><br>
He was still lying quietly inside the sacred cup, staring blankly at the huge dome of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. He felt sort of light-headed as his consciousness was still somewhat in a blur.
<br><br>
Then, he gently moved a finger, followed by his arms, legs, until he could already feel his whole body.
<br><br>
Swoosh! With a quick somersault, Zen leaped from the cup and landed steadily on the ground. As he looked down, he noticed that there was a perfect bloodline map sketched on the square.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The four bronze statues immediately jumped into the square again. This time, they all showed deep respect on their faces.
<br><br>
After all, as long as one could get the approval of the ancestry-level bloodline, it would be more than enough to make them bow down in respect. This was because all creatures that were approved by the ancestrylevel bloodline were regarded as the top talents in the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Moreover, Zen turned out as someone beyond their comprehension as he directly absorbed all of the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
As they looked at Zen, they were no longer able to define his abilities.
<br><br>
Never did they expect that such a thing could possibly happen.
<br><br>
"Human, what are your plans after inheriting the ancestry-level bloodline?"
<br><br>
the bronze human asked while bowing respectfully to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen immediately knew that the changes in their attitudes were only brought by him merging with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
He wondered if the bloodline was really worth that much respect from them.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, Zen had a precise feeling that the bloodline flowing within him was indeed something extraordinary.
<br><br>
"My plans? Of course, I would be returning to my world," Zen said flatly.
<br><br>
He knew that he rarely had anything to do with the Eternal Divine Courtyard, so he didn't see any reason to stay behind. Now that he had achieved his goal in this place, he decided that it was time to return.
<br><br>
He was actually been trapped here for so long, and he was worried that something bad might have happened to the Oneness Sky Palace during his long absence.
<br><br>
With his nonchalant reply, there was an obvious change in the expressions of the four bronze statues.
<br><br>
They had actually figured out that Zen was most probably from another world.
<br><br>
However, those worlds were insignificant in the eyes of bronze statues.
<br><br>
The only thing that was important for them was the Eternal Divine Courtyard, as well as the shackle attached to it — the Time Lock that had sealed the courtyard.
<br><br>
"You're going to return to your original world? What for? Does that even matter now?" The bronze monkey didn't understand Zen's logic so he was totally confused.
<br><br>
Zen was kind of annoyed by the response of the bronze monkey and said, "Then can you tell me what matters?"
<br><br>
"Human, you have acquired the ancestry-level bloodline. You can be considered as the new master of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Don't you want to start anew in this place?" the bronze human hinted at Zen with a pleasant smile.
<br><br>
Zen was kind of surprised. "The new master? Do you really think so? I could really assume that position?" he asked with a faint smile.
<br><br>
The four bronze statues exchanged glances then fell silent. This immediately made Zen see through their facade.
<br><br>
At the back of the minds of the bronze statues, the real master of the Eternal Divine Courtyard would always be the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
Moreover, the purpose of the existence of the statues was to protect the ancestry-level bloodline, and make sure that it was safeguarded in the Eternal Divine Courtyard throughout generations.
<br><br>
However, Zen's unexpected appearance gave the bronze statues a new idea.
<br><br>
Since Zen had absorbed the ancestry-level bloodline, he could really be considered as the new master of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. With his power, he could even restart and continue the legacy of the courtyard.
<br><br>
"First, I have no intention to be the master of this place. I just got what I needed according to the rules. Maybe I'll come back when the proper time calls for it, but right now, I have to return to my original world as soon as possible," Zen explained to the bronze statues.
<br><br>
Right after he spoke, Zen tapped his toe on the ground.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A square dimension spread out from beneath his feet, and a passageway opened on the ground that instantly swallowed him in.
<br><br>
Swoosh! In a matter of seconds, Zen fell into the space below the Eternal Divine Courtyard. It was the space where the bloodline known as the Infinite Time and Space existed.
<br><br>
Since it had been a long time since Zen had entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the spider man who was imprisoned in that cube believed that Zen should've already died. Thinking about this, his heart was filled with regret.
<br><br>
He had almost succeeded in saving himself.
<br><br>
If he had just lured Zen into the cube, he should've escaped already from this damned place.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he thought that he should have been the one who got the chance to acquire and merge with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Now, he thought that he might never have the chance to escape.
<br><br>
The spider man didn't have anything to do but recall the scene over and over again. With just a simple mistake, his situation had turned out for the worst.
<br><br>
However, while he was wallowing in his regrets, he had no clue that he was about to meet Zen again.
<br><br>
Then, without any warning, Zen abruptly appeared in this space once more.
<br><br>
The spider man's eyes widened as soon as he saw him. He started speaking to him in his unique language, ignoring his disheveled hair.
<br><br>
"Heavenly Obsession Civilization, translate it for me," Zen ordered.
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization quickly activated its core and translated what the spider man was saying.
<br><br>
"Young man, did you get the ancestry-level bloodline?" the spider man asked impatiently. However, he strongly believed that Zen wouldn't be able to obtain it. He thought that Zen must have left the Eternal Divine Courtyard without gaining anything.
<br><br>
"Well, what do you think?" Instead of answering directly, Zen just answered back with a faint smile.
<br><br>
"if you didn't get the ancestry-level bloodline, I can teach you the skill for merging the Infinite Time and Space. Even with just this, you will be strong enough!" The spider man offered eagerly. It was as if he had completely forgotten that he had attempted on attacking Zen the previous time they met.
<br><br>
However, Zen pretended to be interested in what he was saying. He descended to the cube where the spider man was and asked, "What is this skill that you're talking about?"
<br><br>
"Give me a finger then! Hurry! I'll demonstrate it for you!" The spider man's eyes seemed to be unusually desperate. He forced a smile and thought that Zen was a fool.
<br><br>
Zen went along and stretched out one of his fingers.
<br><br>
As soon as his finger was stuck into the cube, the spider man grabbed it desperately, as if it was his last lifeline.
<br><br>
He believed that if he could successfully pull Zen inside, everything would work out for him. He was thrilled and nervous at the same time.
<br><br>
However, while he touched Zen's finger, his movement suddenly stopped, and his expression changed drastically.
<br><br>
Chapter 3883 Exploration The finger in the spider man's hand seemed ordinary, but a strange flame lingered around it.
<br><br>
Even though he was exceptionally strong, he instantly felt an unbearable pain when he touched it.
<br><br>
He had been trapped in the cube for countless years and endured all kinds of torture.
<br><br>
However, he couldn't take the pain from the formless flame around Zen's hand. He quickly withdrew his hand.
<br><br>
But how could he give up such a great opportunity? As soon as he pulled out his hand, he spat out the green spider silk towards Zen's hand.
<br><br>
The spider silk was his race's unique ability. His race lived between space layers and inside space cracks, so the spider silk also had a special space quality.
<br><br>
No one else could break the spider silk they released.
<br><br>
The spider silk quickly wrapped around Zen's hand, and at the same time, the spider man's eight legs stepped back. Then, he unleashed a powerful force that pulled Zen into the square space.
<br><br>
If Zen didn't use the Celestial Spear, he wouldn't be as strong as the spider man in terms of strength alone.
<br><br>
The spider man became extremely excited when he saw that Zen was pulled into the space by him.
<br><br>
If he successfully pulled in a person, then he would be able to leave this damned place! Still, he wouldn't kill Zen.
<br><br>
He wanted to keep Zen alive, so Zen would also be tortured and suffer in living hell.
<br><br>
Whoosh! He tried to rush out of the square space, but a loud "bang" sound followed after he came into contact with the space's inner wall. He slammed into the wall, and the space still prevented him from leaving.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
Out of panic, he stretched out a long, thin leg and stabbed the inner wall.
<br><br>
Boom! The wall also blocked his leg. He was very desperate now.
<br><br>
"How could this be? This is impossible! It's simply impossible..."
<br><br>
He turned around and saw Zen, who calmly stood on the other side with a faint smile on his face. At that moment, he suddenly realized something.
<br><br>
It must be Zen who played those tricks! Previously, Zen had been very cautious and didn't even dare to approach the square space. Now that he suddenly dared to come in, he must have done something! "What did you do? Let me out! Or else, I will kill you!"
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The spider man's legs began to glow. It was clear that he only wanted to kill Zen now because he was upset.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen just looked around and said with a smile, "It seems that the inner space is still big. It should be smaller..."
<br><br>
The moment he finished speaking, his figure flashed and left the square space.
<br><br>
When he left, the space began to shrink.
<br><br>
This place could become large or small in the first place. After the spider man stayed inside it for so long, he had understood the Infinite Time and Space to a certain degree, and he could also adjust the internal space.
<br><br>
However, he encountered Zen this time.
<br><br>
As the origin-level bloodline, the Infinite Time and Space was originally derived from the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The moment Zen touched the square space, he had already analyzed the structure of the Infinite Time and Space, and also grasped the method to control such energy.
<br><br>
As the space continued to shrink, the spider man's fear also increased. "How did you do it? Did you fuse with the Infinite Time and Space? Why? Why?"
<br><br>
He was naturally afraid, and as a result, the energy in his legs erupted.
<br><br>
Numerous light pillars with destructive powers swept through the space's inner walls. Yet, the square space remained unmoved, and he couldn't do anything but watch it shrink further.
<br><br>
When the space shrank to about ten feet in length, the spider man felt his body get squeezed.
<br><br>
In turn, he tried his best to curl up and adapt to the increasingly small space.
<br><br>
But when the space shrank to five feet in length, he finally couldn't bear the pressure anymore. Cracking sounds filled the air as his eight legs broke, and his big body was squashed.
<br><br>
"Let's stop here," Zen said coldly.
<br><br>
"Let me out, please..." the spider man managed to croak out a plea for mercy.
<br><br>
His face was squeezed against the space's inner wall, while his eyes and nose pressed into a flat plane.
<br><br>
At that point, the pain he felt was a hundred times greater than before. It was an extremely terrifying torture that even made him wish for death.
<br><br>
However, Zen turned around and left as if he didn't know what happened or hear the spider man's begging. He didn't care about the spider man's situation at all.
<br><br>
After all, the spider man was determined to kill him. If he hadn't gotten lucky enough, he would've been trapped there for the rest of his life.
<br><br>
He had no mercy for such an opponent.
<br><br>
Buzz! He stepped forward and headed for another space, which was the location of the bloodline called Myriad Birth and Destruction.
<br><br>
Click! He stood on the ground again. Then a seedling drilled into his feet and spread along his legs.
<br><br>
He didn't struggle or move, and instead allowed the seedling to grow.
<br><br>
When it grew and took shape, he gently stepped back.
<br><br>
A tree that outlined the meridians all over his body took shape.
<br><br>
Technically speaking, the tree should dissipate on its own after he moved away from it.
<br><br>
This time, however, something unexpected happened.
<br><br>
He reached out his hand and gently stroked the tree. The tree then glowed with an emerald light and emitted the aura of vitality.
<br><br>
"It looks like after I fused with the ancestry-level bloodline, I can grasp the origin-level bloodlines quickly," he commented happily. Then, he took another step forward and returned to the second space.
<br><br>
There was an Ouroboros carved on the bronze mountain in the second space. It was the space of the bloodline called Ultimate Cycle.
<br><br>
Among the four origin-level bloodlines, the Infinite Reproduction, the Myriad Birth and Destruction, and the Infinite Time and Space had roughly visible outlines. However, the meaning of the Ultimate Cycle was unknown. Even its form was invisible.
<br><br>
Now that he had the ancestry-level bloodline as his support, Zen became curious and naturally wanted to comprehend it.
<br><br>
In a split second, he stood on the bronze mountain, just at the center of the Ouroboros.
<br><br>
Swoosh...
<br><br>
An invisible wave came from the Ouroboros. Then, the Ouroboros' statue began to move, and it swallowed its tail bit by bit.
<br><br>
Although the snake devoured itself, its tail also continued to grow. Such a process was an infinite cycle.
<br><br>
When the Ouroboros began to rotate, Zen also felt that the ancestry-level bloodline in his body had started to react.
<br><br>
A strange image surrounded him, and a world that developed in endless cycles appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
Everything in that world grew and then died. Soon enough, a new world was born.
<br><br>
"Is this the chaos? Or is it similar to the chaos?" he asked in confusion.
<br><br>
Just then, several similar worlds appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
Just like the previous world, those worlds were also destroyed and quickly revived, full of life.
<br><br>
Chapter 3884 Conjecture "There is more than one chaos," Zen uttered in realization.
<br><br>
This picture had just given him a piece of vital information.
<br><br>
Within it, worlds were constantly rebuilt and destroyed and Zen found it best to look at them carefully.
<br><br>
Soon, he was able to find something wrong.
<br><br>
Even with the constant cycle of rebirth, the internal energy of the worlds remained constant though Zen felt the addition of new energy every time they died.
<br><br>
For example, if a world was made up of ten units of energy, upon its death, it would create three more units of energy.
<br><br>
Of course, it did not sound many on paper but when one thought about it, if every world was destroyed with 1/3 more energy, then wasn't it actually terrifying? As the world died, this added energy would burst out and then also quietly disappear.
<br><br>
This observation made Zen frown.
<br><br>
"Where did this extra energy go?"
<br><br>
Upon further investigation, he was able to discover something.
<br><br>
At the moment of destruction, violent energy fluctuations would burst out and a spurt of strong energy would escape from the bottom as if sucked away by something.
<br><br>
Zen could only make a rough judgment since all he could base his assumptions on was this virtual picture.
<br><br>
However, he had a good source he could ask. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, what do you think is the significance of the chaos?"
<br><br>
Every existence in this world had a purpose.
<br><br>
The chaos was no exception. It was obviously built to serve some kind of purpose.
<br><br>
"Maybe the Instant Civilization built it to expand their influence?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven suggested. He had sensed that Zen already had a conclusion so all he could offer was a baseless suggestion.
<br><br>
"If they wanted to expand their influence, then they could've lived and multiplied within the chaos after they built it. The Element Spirit Civilization would've never risen in power and there wouldn't have been various kinds of ruling civilizations," Zen muttered.
<br><br>
This theory of Zen's had long since been put forwarded by other people but with differing opinions. Some claimed that the Instant Civilization sowed the seeds of civilizations and was so strong that they did not bother asking for anything to return.
<br><br>
A few would say that the chaos was an unexpected world, which was probably why it was constantly rebuilt and destroyed over the ages. All sorts of assumptions were made and floated around as time went on.
<br><br>
However, it was obvious that Zen had just learned something different from the Ultimate Cycle so the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw it fit to hear what he had to say.
<br><br>
"The Instant Civilization or the Four Spirits Sect probably built the chaos to absorb its energy. With this in mind, they had probably built more than one if they wanted to collect a huge amount," Zen continued as he gazed at the picture in the distance.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't help but frown. "But the energy within the chaos should be constant and non-renewable. The total amount of chaos should remain the same from its conception until this very moment."
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "I disagree. The energy actually increases by a third when a new chaos is built and loses the same amount when it is destroyed.
<br><br>
Only through this can balance be achieved."
<br><br>
Zen's statement made the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes tremble. He transmitted his words to the other heroes and one of them, the Snake Goddess to be exact, let out a laugh.
<br><br>
A puzzled expression appeared on Zen's face when he heard it. "Why are you laughing, Snake Goddess?"
<br><br>
"Ask the Primeval Lord of Heaven," she replied.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed. "She's the most intelligent person in our human race and also extremely sensitive to energy."
<br><br>
In the past, the Snake Goddess once invented a unique method of measuring the total energy in the chaos.
<br><br>
The primitive land, the various worlds, the chaotic clouds, everything within the chaos was made up of materials and composed of energy.
<br><br>
She used a unique method to calculate the total energy of the chaos and came upon the conclusion that it was constantly increasing.
<br><br>
Her conjecture, however, was dismissed as mere, utter nonsense and many Eternal Realm masters laughed behind her back because of it.
<br><br>
After each round of chaos was destroyed, the Sons of Truth survived in the new one and could directly observe the most original power of the chaos: the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
The Ways-blending Energy of each round was constant, which proved that the Snake Goddess was wrong.
<br><br>
Since the Sons of Truth had a different conclusion, the Snake Goddess herself was confused. According to her measurements at the time, the energy would increase by 1/3 after the end of a chaotic era.
<br><br>
Who would have thought that some of the energy would be siphoned away when a round of chaos ended? When the Primeval Lord of Heaven finished speaking, Zen was suddenly filled with admiration for her. "You're truly intelligent, Snake Goddess. You were able to come to the same conclusion through measurement. I really admire you!"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess snorted, "It was a pity that nobody believed me and chose to take the side of those stupid Sons of Truth!"
<br><br>
To her, the Sons of Truth were just lucky to have been chosen by the chaos as the protectors of the next one but in truth, they were weak and only controlled a bit of truth-level theurgies.
<br><br>
"It's all my fault. I'm sorry," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said helplessly.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess merely ignored him. "If this is the case, then the Instant Civilization wouldn't want to see the completion of the Finale Way."
<br><br>
Once the chaos defeated that needle and completed the Finale Way, its constant cycle of destruction and rebirth would be no more. Extra energy would no longer circulate as the chaos would use it to expand outwards.
<br><br>
"In other words, that needle was arranged by the Instant Civilization," she muttered in finality.
<br><br>
Upon this conclusion, Zen's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes flashed. The truth had given them clarity.
<br><br>
The destroyer was also the creator.
<br><br>
The chaos was constantly built, developed, and destroyed.
<br><br>
This Ultimate Cycle was probably not some kind of theurgy but a method of education engraved in the bloodline that told the descendants of the Instant Civilization how to survive.
<br><br>
"But this is only a conjecture," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess chose to remain silent. What he said was true. Though her words were reasonable, she had no concrete evidence to prove it.
<br><br>
"There is a way to prove it," Zen told them with a smile. "So long as we find a world like chaos in the Abstruse Energy World, then we will be able to prove it!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3885 Four Pillars In the Abstruse Energy World Some of the light dots froze in place, while some others continued to twirl and dance.
<br><br>
It was surprisingly easy to express and illustrate some complicated things with light dots.
<br><br>
For example, it only required less than forty light dots to construct the shape of a person.
<br><br>
On the other hand, there were some simple shapes that required innumerable light dots to create. For example, a rope was actually built by three to four hundred light dots.
<br><br>
In the beginning, Geoffrey had wanted to record a guide of rules to help Ziya and the other warriors learn faster and adapt to the Abstruse Energy World more easily.
<br><br>
After some lengthy efforts proved unsuccessful, Geoffrey chose to give up.
<br><br>
No matter how omniscient and capable Ziya was, once he entered the Abstruse Energy World, he became as a child, knowing nothing about the workings of that world.
<br><br>
Even though he had such astonishing wisdom, he was now like a threeyear-old child trying to figure out the complicated light dots.
<br><br>
Last time, after crossing the grassland, Geoffrey and Ziya had found another world similar in nature to chaos. Ziya had been very interested in it as if he had discovered a new continent. He became even more enthusiastic about the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
Since there was this second world, there must be a third and a fourth one...
<br><br>
There were endless living creatures and clues in these worlds.
<br><br>
After sealing off the Deleting Space, Ziya had urged Geoffrey to continue exploring the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
After bypassing the mountain in the world of poisonous mist, Geoffrey had continued to move forward. A narrow mountain path led upwards, and the terrain in front of him became rugged and difficult, which had caused Geoffrey to hesitate for a moment.
<br><br>
Although Ziya was powerful, it would be difficult to deal with some of the strange creatures in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
But since he had come so far, Geoffrey didn't want to retreat. He was also fascinated by this strangely familiar world.
<br><br>
After ascending the mountain path with gritted determination, Geoffrey prepared to go up to the mountainside when he suddenly noticed a pair of red eyes not far away, burning in a face like an ape's.
<br><br>
The creature saw Geoffrey in the same instant, and it jumped out of the crevice that ran up the mountainside.
<br><br>
This creature was tall and strong with slender but powerful arms. Gripping a big stick in its hands, it seemed to amble over with ill intentions. More importantly, there was more than one long-armed ape. Soon, more than ten long-armed apes jumped out from the crack in quick succession! The leading ape with long arms suddenly jumped and swung its big stick at Geoffrey.
<br><br>
In the Abstruse Energy World, even these unintelligent creatures possessed a powerful and brutish strength, at least stronger than Geoffrey! Noticing that trouble was looming, Geoffrey pulled Ziya behind him to the front and patted him on the shoulder.
<br><br>
In the Abstruse Energy World, Geoffrey hadn't found a good way to communicate with Ziya yet.
<br><br>
The two of them had agreed that if Geoffrey encountered a crisis that he couldn't solve, he would push Ziya ahead and pat him on the right shoulder to indicate he should act! When Ziya felt Geoffrey's pat, his heart sank. It meant that Geoffrey was in trouble! In this state, Ziya was as lost as a blind man.
<br><br>
He couldn't use any theurgy, though he still possessed a powerful physical body and formidable strength.
<br><br>
In front of him, a large mass of strange light dots that was quite indistinguishable swarmed over. Ziya simply stretched out his hands and hacked at the mass! He had practiced this movement countless times before! Now, finally, it came in handy this time! The tall and sturdy long-armed ape in the lead didn't take Ziya seriously.
<br><br>
As it swung the wooden stick towards Ziya, a dull thud sounded, but Ziya's body did not move at all, like an iron tower. The ape didn't know that its blow with full strength was as nothing in Ziya's eyes.
<br><br>
Crack! Ziya's palms lashed out at the ape's shoulders. As the terrifying power was exerted on its body, the ape watched in horror as its bones broke, and its entire body became compressed and ripped to pieces by a huge force...
<br><br>
Geoffrey was also overwhelmed by the sudden destruction of the longarmed ape.
<br><br>
In the Abstruse Energy World, Ziya couldn't tell the strength of his opponent, so he had hit the ape with close to his full power, immediately smashing it to pieces.
<br><br>
The bloody scene shocked the other long-armed apes in front of them.
<br><br>
Although they were not evolved life-forms, they were not complete idiots either. The two human beings in front of them were obviously not warriors to trifle with. They produced strange screams and disappeared into the crack in the mountainside.
<br><br>
Having scared off the long-armed apes, Geoffrey pulled Ziya along and followed after them into the crack through the mountainside.
<br><br>
Not long after they entered the dark crack, a large cave appeared in front of them.
<br><br>
Geoffrey's eyes gleamed with anticipation. 'Is this the third world?' With this in mind, Geoffrey would not retreat. Without hesitation, he entered the cave with Ziya in tow.
<br><br>
The cave was not only very deep, but also massively wide. A large part of it was filled with the long-armed apes. These apes were obviously now terrified of Ziya. When Geoffrey and Ziya passed by, the long-armed apes curled up into a mass of trembling shapes.
<br><br>
Of course, Geoffrey ignored them and went deeper into the cave.
<br><br>
When the long-armed apes watched Geoffrey continue forward, their eyes filled with expectation and pity.
<br><br>
Although their intelligence was only at a bestial level, they knew that they couldn't move deeper into the cave.
<br><br>
All of the long-armed apes that had entered deeper into the cave before had never returned. It was an endless abyss. These two human beings would probably die if they entered! After they had walked thousands of feet along the cave, the space ahead of them suddenly changed significantly.
<br><br>
The scattered dots of light quickly gathered in one direction, and the two of them quickly rematerialized as human shapes.
<br><br>
"What attacked you just now? Where are we?"
<br><br>
In front of Ziya was another huge space, but compared to the world of poisonous mist, this place was even more desolate, or phrased differently, it was completely void! Ziya and Geoffrey continued to use the Grand Teleportation technique. But regardless of how much distance they covered, they found no living beings.
<br><br>
Not even a soil particle, or a blade of grass existed here. This was a completely empty world! The two of them tried to enter the Other Shore by way of the Truth of Godly Way, but this didn't work either. The Other Shore didn't exist at all...
<br><br>
"It seems that this world is even worse off," said Ziya with a grim face.
<br><br>
The previous world of poisonous mist had basically been destroyed. The fate of only one world didn't signify anything, but the world they discovered now was in the same situation, and it was completely destroyed. All things had been destroyed here, which meant that there was massive trouble looming. The chaos would probably fall into the same situation in the end.
<br><br>
"Maybe the next world didn't suffer the same fate..." Geoffrey comforted.
<br><br>
"I hope so. Geoffrey, please continue to lead the way," Ziya said with a grim smile. After being in the Deleting Space for so many years, Ziya had perfected the art of indifference, and he was not upset by much.
<br><br>
After the two of them left the empty world, they continued to climb up the mountain path.
<br><br>
After Geoffrey gripped the rope and dragged Ziya to climb over the rugged and endless mountains, he finally saw a strange scene.
<br><br>
Standing in the distance, four huge black pillars had attracted Geoffrey's attention. Everything in the Abstruse Energy World became the size of miniscule insects compared to these four black pillars, hardly worth mentioning.
<br><br>
Everything was small in terms of size compared to these, and the black pillars' aura was also massive in comparison.
<br><br>
Geoffrey couldn't find words for this feeling, but at first sight of the black pillars, he paused in shock.
<br><br>
Chapter 3886 Return To The Scroll Painting As Geoffrey stood still, gazing into the distance, Ziya was confused. He couldn't tell why Geoffrey remained motionless.
<br><br>
The dots of light changing before him left him feeling suspicious.
<br><br>
In the past, his activities in the Abstruse Energy World were limited to a low-lying area, where he could observe only a few things. Thus, he was unable to distinguish between heaven and earth.
<br><br>
Now, the countless, densely-packed dots before him confused him greatly.
<br><br>
It was completely beyond his comprehension.
<br><br>
Whenever he tried to figure out what those dots of light were, he suddenly felt a splitting headache, as though someone had stabbed him in the head.
<br><br>
Desperate to relieve himself of the pain, he tried to distract himself from the dots of light. Anyway, he knew it was futile to try to understand what they were.
<br><br>
"In the center of the four giant pillars, there seem to be some buildings,"
<br><br>
Geoffrey pointed out.
<br><br>
Looking far into the distance, he could faintly make out the outline of a huge palace, but it was too far away and hazy.
<br><br>
After staring into the distance for a while, Geoffrey suddenly pulled Ziya, urging him to keep moving forward.
<br><br>
Now that he had discovered something new, Geoffrey had no plans of retreating.
<br><br>
On the way to the four giant pillars, Geoffrey kept Ziya's instructions in mind, cautiously searching the whole way.
<br><br>
Other than the chaos, they had already discovered two other worlds, including the one with poisonous mist. It was possible they'd stumble upon other worlds on their journey.
<br><br>
In fact, after having stayed in the Abstruse Energy World for so long, Geoffrey was under the illusion that these weren't real worlds. Rather, they were large caves or some sort of low-level spaces.
<br><br>
In contrast, everything in the Abstruse Energy World lived in harmony.
<br><br>
Everything contained energy. The energy in the low-level worlds, like the chaos and the world with poisonous mist, seemed to be hidden. For example, stones, water, and herbs all had energy hidden in their bodies, which needed to be activated by various methods.
<br><br>
As for the things in the Abstruse Energy World, they appeared as dots of light. These dots of light seemed to be made of energy, and they seemed to be more intuitive.
<br><br>
Of course, Geoffrey was only theorizing at this point.
<br><br>
After all, he was able to move with ease in the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
But to the creatures in those worlds, the Abstruse Energy World was like a nightmare.
<br><br>
After searching for some time, Geoffrey finally found the fourth world.
<br><br>
This world was soaked in some kind of strange mercury.
<br><br>
Spiritual sense was completely blocked by the mercury, so Ziya couldn't use his spiritual sense to scan the world. Moreover, the mercury also affected the Space Law.
<br><br>
The Grand Teleportation could only transport him over short distances.
<br><br>
After a few attempts, it finally dawned on him that the mercury was messing with him.
<br><br>
If he tried to explore this world further, he might've completely lost himself to the mercury. Thus, he decided to return with Geoffrey.
<br><br>
As they explored the mercury world, Geoffrey told Ziya about the four huge pillars and the massive palace he'd seen prior. Immediately, Ziya recalled the densely packed dots of lights he'd seen, and his face lit up in excitement.
<br><br>
To their disappointment, they didn't find anything noteworthy in the three worlds they'd just discovered. This couldn't possibly be a coincidence.
<br><br>
Those worlds must have been destroyed.
<br><br>
But this didn't answer the question as to how the chaos managed to escape this disaster. They figured they'd probably glean some more information from the four huge pillars.
<br><br>
Geoffrey made up his mind. Instead of wasting time exploring those other worlds, he headed straight for the four huge pillars.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Ouroboros in the Ultimate Cycle stopped spinning, and the picture in front of Zen also disappeared.
<br><br>
But Zen's mouth still hung open in shock.
<br><br>
It came as quite a surprise to him that the vast chaos turned out to be a mere tool that generated energy.
<br><br>
Once he retreated from the Ultimate Cycle, Zen returned to the first space, where the creatures could multiply infinitely.
<br><br>
As soon as he entered this space, he felt a chill run down his spine.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, a strange and cold voice cut through the cold atmosphere.
<br><br>
"Do you want to stay here..."
<br><br>
A frightened-looking boy stared at Zen, his mouth wide open.
<br><br>
The first time Zen entered this space, this creepy boy had chased after him the whole time.
<br><br>
Although Zen tried to counterattack, the boy continued multiplying, generating more avatars with each second that passed. Zen was left with no choice but to escape.
<br><br>
But now, as Zen stared down this boy, he felt the ancestry-level bloodline surging within his body, like ripples on a lake. The attributes of the ancestry-level bloodline started to change constantly, and several kinds of energy with life and destruction attributes merged together.
<br><br>
"I can stay here," Zen said. As he spoke, he raised his index finger.
<br><br>
Then, a small gray thing appeared on the tip of his finger, like a gray bug.
<br><br>
The boy had been smiling mischievously, his eyes dancing playfully.
<br><br>
However, the moment he saw the small gray bug on Zen's finger, his expression fell.
<br><br>
"Waah!"
<br><br>
With a shrill scream, the boy took a step back.
<br><br>
He was the incarnation of the origin-level bloodline named Infinite Reproduction, and the energy of the bug on Zen's finger was completely different from the Infinite Reproduction. It could restrain the boy, so the boy had an instinctive fear of the bug.
<br><br>
Eyes filled with fear, the boy tried to retreat. But Zen only needed to take a few strides to catch up to the boy. As he gently patted the boy on the shoulder, the bug landed on the boy's body with ease.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, the boy's body began to swell like a balloon. Fistsized bubbles dotted his skin, and he began to writhe violently.
<br><br>
Then, he exploded into a pool of blood.
<br><br>
Zen squatted down next to the pool and dipped his hand into it. "The originlevel bloodline named Infinite Reproduction has eleven types of power in the map. If this truly is the origin-level bloodline, then the bloodline I just created must also be regarded as the same."
<br><br>
The small grey bug suddenly emerged from the pool of blood and crawled onto his hand once more. Apparently, Zen created it instinctively.
<br><br>
Then, he turned around abruptly to return to the stone platform of the hexagram array.
<br><br>
He had done this before, so he assumed he just needed to retrace his steps.
<br><br>
However, when he stepped onto the stone platform, nothing happened.
<br><br>
Puzzled, he looked down at the stone surface beneath his feet. He sensed that the rules of space and time of the stone platform had changed somewhat.
<br><br>
Buzz! With a slight nod, he immediately figured out what to do. The ancestrylevel bloodline in his body surged again, transforming accordingly to one with space-time attribute.
<br><br>
Then, a stream of energy flowed down his arms, then legs, until it passed from his toes and onto the stone platform. Suddenly, the stone platform lit up, and Zen vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
Chapter 3887 Meeting The moment Zen disappeared from the stone platform, he felt the ancestrylevel bloodline in his body surging once more.
<br><br>
At the same time, he finally understood the composition of energy in the hexagram array.
<br><br>
The first time Zen was teleported in, he didn't feel the power of the space fluctuation.
<br><br>
However, that didn't mean the power didn't exist. It just meant that, at the time, Zen wasn't able to understand it.
<br><br>
Now that the ancestry-level bloodline surged within him, Zen instantly understood the power of space within the hexagram array. In fact, it was not one, but two kinds of power of space that were combined in such a way that they offset each other.
<br><br>
Upon returning to the Eternal Scroll Painting, Zen was once again pressed into a picture. Then, a huge vortex appeared before him.
<br><br>
"There are two more lines here,"
<br><br>
Zen observed as he took a few steps forward.
<br><br>
He had arrived at the very center of the huge vortex of the Eternal Scroll Painting. Since ancient times till the present, Zen was the sole being who had entered this place; who else could've left these two lines here? Zen walked forward cautiously, wrought with confusion. The instant he stepped between the two thin lines, they shot upwards until the two lines were floating above the huge vortex. Unwittingly, Zen had activated a path that stretched above the vortex, extending into the distance.
<br><br>
Zen broke free from the plane and climbed to the top of the Eternal Scroll Painting. From there, he saw that the path headed straight to the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting. "That is where the fox girl was," he muttered to himself.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, someone who had obtained a bloodline from the Eternal Scroll Painting would return to the Grand Plain Stage through the vortex.
<br><br>
Now that the Eternal Scroll Painting had been closed, it was impossible for Zen to return to the Other Shore through that normal way. He had no choice but to come up with another solution.
<br><br>
Previously, the fox girl had insisted that he take an origin-level bloodline. If he didn't, she would kill him.
<br><br>
Now that he had managed to obtain the ancestry-level bloodline, he figured the fox girl wouldn't make any attempt to kill him.
<br><br>
Bearing that in mind, Zen relaxed a bit. He continued along the path towards the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting with ease.
<br><br>
The second Zen stepped foot onto the Eternal Scroll Painting, the brushwielder sensed his presence and provided the path specifically for him.
<br><br>
"He's back," the smiling face of the brush-wielder said.
<br><br>
The fox girl frowned. "So soon? Did he fail?"
<br><br>
It was definitely not easy to obtain an origin-level bloodline. As a matter of fact, the fox girl had settled into thinking that it'd take Zen decades, or even a century, before he successfully obtained an origin-level bloodline.
<br><br>
She had even gone so far as to entertain the thought that Zen would die there and would never return.
<br><br>
Only a short time had passed since Zen left. Naturally, she was suspicious he had returned unsuccessful.
<br><br>
The brush-wielder continued, "Anyway, I've drawn a path to guide him here."
<br><br>
"Are you going to speak to him face to face?" asked the fox girl, raising an eyebrow.
<br><br>
The brush-wielder was the manager of the passages. He had never personally faced any creature on the Other Shore. Usually, the fox girl handled these sorts of things.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter anymore," the brush-wielder sighed emotionally. Then the crying face continued, "Many rules have been broken. If we continue to abide by the rules, we might as well draw a circle on the ground to serve as a prison for ourselves!"
<br><br>
With that, the fox girl fell silent.
<br><br>
Over the years, the brush-wielder seldom showed his face to anyone. It seemed he had placed his hopes on Zen.
<br><br>
With ease, Zen continued along the path that was set for him. The moment he stepped onto the second page of the Eternal Scroll Painting, the fox girl and the brush-wielder appeared before him.
<br><br>
Since this was the second time he encountered the fox girl, he greeted her politely. As for her crying companion, Zen didn't have a clue as to who he was. Naturally, he looked at him vigilantly; it seemed this character had something to do with the Eternal Scroll Painting, but Zen was at a loss as to how exactly.
<br><br>
"Zen?" the brush-wielder asked.
<br><br>
Zen nodded cautiously, cupping his hands politely. "May I know who you are?"
<br><br>
Suddenly, the brush-wielder's sullen face beamed happily. It was now a smiling face in front of him. "I am the brush-wielder."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he summoned a huge ink brush in the air.
<br><br>
When Zen's eyes landed on the ink brush, his eyes flashed with understanding. "Are the lines in the Eternal Scroll Painting drawn by you?"
<br><br>
"Yes," The brush-wielder replied. "It can also be said that everything here is created by me."
<br><br>
The Eternal Scroll Painting served as a special passage, thus the brushwielder served as the master of this special passage.
<br><br>
"I see..."
<br><br>
The light suddenly broke in upon not only Zen but also the human heroes such as the Primeval Lord of Heaven. They were also interested in the constantly emerging lines within the Eternal Scroll Painting. They knew that there should be an invisible existence over the Eternal Scroll Painting, but none of them had ever seen the true appearance of such an existence.
<br><br>
It could be said that they were slightly in awe to be in the presence of the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
"Have you gotten an origin-level bloodline?" the fox girl suddenly cut in.
<br><br>
She was not the type to waste time. Anxious to find out, she decidedly interrupted their conversation.
<br><br>
Zen smiled faintly. "I think I did."
<br><br>
"What do you mean by 'you think'?" the fox girl asked coldly.
<br><br>
"I can't pretend to have obtained one if I haven't, right?" Zen asked, raising a brow mischievously.
<br><br>
"Then show me!" the fox girl demanded impatiently.
<br><br>
The only way Zen could do so was to demonstrate the power of the bloodline he had obtained, which was something he couldn't do in the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Spreading out his hands, Zen said helplessly, "I'm afraid I can't use it in this form."
<br><br>
Although Zen was standing upright in the Eternal Scroll Painting, he was still two-dimensional. This hampered his abilities.
<br><br>
"Then turn into your normal form and let me see," the fox girl ordered.
<br><br>
Impatient, she wanted to expose his lie as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Thus, the two of them entered a room of hexagram array and returned to their normal forms.
<br><br>
The fox girl's flawless fair face exuded a cold aura. "You can prove it now."
<br><br>
Zen studied her expression. It seemed she was willing to kill him on the spot if he failed to prove her wrong.
<br><br>
"First of all, there is something you need to know," Zen said.
<br><br>
"I want to see your bloodline theurgy. Now!"
<br><br>
the fox girl said through gritted teeth, obviously running out of patience with every second that passed. She was under the impression he was stalling for time.
<br><br>
"Behind the four origin-level bloodlines, there is a stronger bloodline, which is called the ancestry-level bloodline," Zen continued with a mischievous smile. "The ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard is the origin of all bloodlines, and the four origin-level bloodlines also originate from the ancestry-level bloodline."
<br><br>
The fox girl remained expressionless. Instead, the killing intent in her eyes intensified tenfold. "One last chance, Zen. Show me your bloodline theurgy right this instant!"
<br><br>
Just as the fox girl was about to attack Zen, the astonished voice of the brush-wielder suddenly came from above, "How do you know the ancestrylevel bloodline? And the Eternal Divine Courtyard? Were you able to enter that square?"
<br><br>
Even the fox girl didn't know about the ancestry-level bloodline, nor was she aware of the existence of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. She had been told that there were four origin-level bloodlines at the end of the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
Zen's words stirred up a storm in the heart of the brush-wielder as he stared at him intently from above.
<br><br>
Chapter 3888 Display Of Abilities The fox girl looked at Zen with confusion when she heard the panic in the brush-wielder's voice.
<br><br>
She had learned everything she knew about the Eternal Scroll Painting from the brush-wielder. He had said there were only four origin-level bloodlines in the center of the Eternal Scroll Painting and she believed him.
<br><br>
That was why she now thought Zen spoke absolute nonsense.
<br><br>
But the brush-wielder's response perplexed her and filled her with doubt.
<br><br>
Perhaps Zen was not lying.
<br><br>
"Yes, I entered it," Zen replied honestly.
<br><br>
Of course, he could have kept this to himself as the fox girl's request only involved an origin-level bloodline and he was able to display an origin-level bloodline theurgy with ease.
<br><br>
But his trip to the Eternal Scroll Painting had raised too many questions for him.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the brush-wielder and the fox girl hoped he would grow stronger.
<br><br>
And he wished to get more information from the brush-wielder, so he was willing to share some of his secrets.
<br><br>
Zen's answer caused the brush-wielder's crying face to tremble suddenly and flip it to a smiling face instead. "Then you have given it a try?" inquired the smiling face.
<br><br>
Obtaining an origin-level bloodline was very difficult and the brush-wielder had high hopes that Zen would be able to do so.
<br><br>
As the ruler of the Eternal Scroll Painting, he not only guarded the passage in the chaos but also controlled the passages in other worlds.
<br><br>
Because of this, he knew better than anyone else how difficult it was to obtain an origin-level bloodline.
<br><br>
The creatures in these worlds were born with defects. If they obtained a root-level bloodline, they would be considered one of the top masters, but if they obtained an origin-level bloodline, they would be able to dominate a world.
<br><br>
As for the ancestry-level bloodline, it was not meant for the creatures of these worlds. It was the foundation of the existence of the Four Spirits Sect and even their talents had great difficulty in getting the opportunity to enter the sacred cup.
<br><br>
As far as the brush-wielder could remember, very few creatures were able to enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and even fewer had succeeded in merging with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"I tried," Zen answered.
<br><br>
"Did you succeed?" pressed the brush-wielder, his voice urgent. He didn't seem to be breathing, if he did he would probably do so quite heavily.
<br><br>
Zen stretched his hand towards the fox girl who stood opposite him and a gray aura surged out. It turned into a sharp claw with razor sharp fingertips and grabbed at her.
<br><br>
The fox girl had a keen sense that Zen would not kill her, but when she felt the terrifyingly destructive aura emanating from the sharp claw, her soft face lost all its color and turned pale.
<br><br>
"Da! Da! Da!"
<br><br>
Her snow-white bare feet skipped across the ground as she retreated to the edge of the wall. She was clearly rattled and frightened, with her arms crossed and her chest heaving as she gasped for breath.
<br><br>
Right from the start, she had been aggressive and overbearing. Zen's sudden attack would mean punishment.
<br><br>
He had casually used his bloodline to combine three kinds of energy with the destruction attribute and two kinds with the life attribute. This combination of energy was not all that powerful but it was incredibly intimidating and could cause an extremely powerful spiritual pressure.
<br><br>
"Well... What sort of ability is that?" The brush-wielder was now even more taken aback.
<br><br>
Zen had not displayed just one single ability, but a combination of several.
<br><br>
This meant he had not only merged with the ancestry-level bloodline, but also possessed its multitude of abilities.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the combination of multiple abilities would only result in four abilities—Infinite Reproduction, Myriad Birth and Destruction, Ultimate Cycle and Infinite Time and Space. These four abilities were separated from the ancestry-level bloodline, meaning they were made up of more than ten kinds of energy from the ancestry-level bloodline, combined in different ways.
<br><br>
However, the origin-level bloodline and the ancestry-level bloodline were not the same thing, so the talents of the Four Spirits Sect still scrambled for the ancestry-level bloodline. Even if they could only obtain one form of energy by merging with it, it would still be much stronger than an originlevel bloodline.
<br><br>
Those who were able to obtain two or more abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline were the most blessed in the Four Spirits Sect. Such people were few and far between, even for them.
<br><br>
Of course, the brush-wielder already understood this.
<br><br>
But when he had witnessed Zen's demonstration of such a strange ability, he had not considered all that. Instead, he wondered which form of energy among the three hundred and seventy-three forms was this powerful.
<br><br>
"It's the combination of the sixth, the seventh and the fifty-seventh kinds of energy from the destruction area and the first and thirty-third kinds of energy from the life area," Zen revealed. He then allowed himself a slight smile when he saw the pale face of the fox girl. "This ability has no name yet. Let's call it 'Energy Intimidation' for now."
<br><br>
The fox girl was still at a loss for words and the brush-wielder fell silent as well.
<br><br>
Zen had really and truly obtained the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
This alone was far beyond the brush-wielder's expectations. It should have been good news but his sudden, terrifying display of the combination of five abilities left the brush-wielder stunned and speechless.
<br><br>
Even when the Four Spirits Sect was at its peak, only a tiny fraction had obtained multiple abilities.
<br><br>
What was more, Zen seemed to imply that he had created the ability on the fly simply to intimidate the fox girl.
<br><br>
He had merged with more than five abilities, and was able to use them at will.
<br><br>
This was beyond what the brush-wielder understood. He would need some time to come to grips with it all.
<br><br>
Zen noticed the fox girl had been scared silly and now looked uncharacteristically pitiful. He withdrew the sharp gray claw and comforted her, "To be honest, this thing only looks scary. It's not actually all that terrifying."
<br><br>
As he spoke, a green light, made up of three abilities of life attribute, flashed on his fingertip. It surrounded the fox girl in a warm energy. The cold feeling of falling into an icy cave disappeared and was replaced with a bathing of her heart in a spring wind.
<br><br>
"You are able to use the abilities bestowed by the ancestry-level bloodline freely? How many? Twenty, thirty?" asked the brush-wielder, his voice trembling.
<br><br>
The fox girl blinked her big eyes in surprise. The brush-wielder was not himself today. He seemed so agitated.
<br><br>
Zen had just shown the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline. The smile on his face now vanished as he barked angrily, "You required me to obtain an origin-level bloodline and I went beyond what you had expected. If you wish to know how many abilities I have obtained, answer my questions first!"
<br><br>
Too much confusion had accumulated within him.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had once been able to answer most of his questions, and the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had answered the rest.
<br><br>
But it seemed this was always the way it went: the more he knew, the more ignorant he felt.
<br><br>
The way ahead seemed carved out by riddles and the further he walked, the more questions he had.
<br><br>
Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven was unable to explain much of what now took place.
<br><br>
Chapter 3889 Threshold The brush-wielder didn't experience what Zen had gone through, so he wondered why Zen had asked such a question.
<br><br>
In any case, he now thought even more highly of Zen since the latter had obtained the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
"Tell me, what do you want to know? I will tell you everything I know," he said.
<br><br>
Zen looked up and asked, "What is the Four Spirits Sect? Are they the founders of the Instant Civilization?"
<br><br>
It seemed that every secret was related to the Instant Civilization, which in turn was closely connected to the Four Spirits Sect. Thus, he wanted to know the connection between them.
<br><br>
"Since you've already been to the Eternal Divine Courtyard, you should've known that it was the four holy spirits who formed the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
They are invincible beings in the outer world. They can create everything, as well as destroy everything. They are the creators, and the annihilators as well," said the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
The four holy spirits were human spirit, monkey spirit, snake spirit, and bird spirit. In a broad sense, it was difficult to tell if the Four Spirits Sect was good or evil.
<br><br>
"The Instant Civilization you referred to should be the creator of the chaos.
<br><br>
They indeed belong to the Four Spirits Sect, but they are only a small branch," he continued.
<br><br>
As the Four Spirits Sect developed and expanded, they were divided into many factions, and each of them had a clear division of work.
<br><br>
For instance, some of them were pioneers, responsible for exploring new worlds; annihilators, responsible for killing other creatures; others were creators who built secondary worlds and many more.
<br><br>
"The Instant Civilization you've mentioned should be the world builders of the Four Spirits Sect. Among them, human spirits have the largest population," he explained.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen quietly lowered his head and thought deeply. The brushwielder's answer was quite close to his guess. Then, he asked, "The world builders have built more than one world of chaos, right?"
<br><br>
"Yes," the brush-wielder nodded.
<br><br>
"Did they build those worlds for the sole purpose of obtaining energy?" Zen recalled that it was what he had witnessed in the space of the Ultimate Cycle.
<br><br>
"Yes," the brush-wielder nodded again. "The creatures in secondary worlds are quite weak, but they are in large number. After a new world is created, and once its time is accelerated, lots of extra energy will overflow. The Four Spirits Sect needs such energy for its expansion," he added.
<br><br>
A secondary world could produce astronomical amounts of energy in one whole chaotic era.
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect had built dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of such worlds. "Then why should they end those worlds? Isn't it better to let the worlds continue to grow stronger?" Zen asked with a frown.
<br><br>
The pictures in the space of the Ultimate Cycle answered some of his questions, but they didn't quell his doubts.
<br><br>
"There are too many secondary worlds. If they continued to exist, they would eventually threaten the status of the Four Spirits Sect at some point.
<br><br>
Furthermore, extracting the energy of a world will only cause violent turmoil. After careful consideration, they concluded that destroying the secondary worlds and building them over again is the best solution," the brush-wielder answered.
<br><br>
Besides, the Four Spirits Sect didn't just enforce their rules on a whim.
<br><br>
Everyone regarded that as the best solution after countless years of exploration and experiments! Aside from the rules, the time span of a chaotic era, the size of the primitive land, and so on were also included. All of those were decided after a long period of attempts and experience.
<br><br>
"You mean they are afraid that the creatures of the secondary worlds will threaten the status of the Four Spirits Sect?" Zen asked. "The creatures of our world can't even understand the space and time in the Abstruse Energy World. How is it possible for us to pose any threat to the Four Spirits Sect?"
<br><br>
he said with a wry smile.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, the brush-wielder paused for a moment and asked, "Have you ever been to the Abstruse Energy World you mentioned?"
<br><br>
According to what he knew, the Three Purities Stage should be the only exit to the outside of the chaos.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen couldn't leave the chaos before he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen admitted honestly. "Is there any other way out of the chaos?" he asked in astonishment.
<br><br>
"Sorry, but I can't tell you about that," Zen said and shrugged.
<br><br>
Zen could tell the brush-wielder everything about the Eternal Divine Courtyard since the brush-wielder himself was the ruler of the Eternal Scroll Painting. However, he wouldn't reveal anything about the fact that he had entered the Abstruse Energy World through the Deleting Space.
<br><br>
The brush-wielder didn't pursue the matter anymore. He just said, "It's true that creatures of the secondary worlds can't survive outside the chaos.
<br><br>
However, that doesn't mean that they can't threaten the Four Spirits Sect."
<br><br>
The Four Spirits Sect never united as a whole, and they always had severe internal conflicts.
<br><br>
The world builders initially did not impose restrictions on the first secondary worlds. They allowed those worlds to develop freely, which resulted in the birth of many strange and powerful creatures.
<br><br>
Most of those new creatures joined the Four Spirits Sect, but the others refused to submit. Instead, they connived with the traitors in the Four Spirits Sect, which in turn caused chaos.
<br><br>
After that, the Four Spirits Sect restricted the development of the secondary worlds. In other words, they restarted the secondary worlds, and at the same time, extracted their energy once in a while.
<br><br>
Still, there were many talented creatures born in the secondary worlds. Of course, it would be a big waste even for the Four Spirits Sect if all those creatures got destroyed along with the secondary worlds.
<br><br>
Therefore, the world builders came up with a remedial plan to make up for their loss. They added an Other Shore on top of every secondary world. The Other Shore was like a fishing net that collected the biggest fish for them.
<br><br>
Then, the strongest warriors in the secondary worlds would eventually enter the Eternal Scroll Painting. A few of them might manage to reach the deepest part of the Eternal Scroll Painting then they would step into the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and finally join the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
If all the secondary worlds still operated like normal and the Eternal Divine Courtyard hadn't been abandoned yet, then Zen might have already joined the Four Spirits Sect by now.
<br><br>
However, the Four Spirits Sect had undergone drastic changes, which gave him the chance to obtain the complete ancestry-level bloodline and come back safe and sound.
<br><br>
All those happened by sheer luck.
<br><br>
"So that is the real use of the Other Shore," he muttered.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the real Snake Goddess, and the rest were all lost in thought. After a while, the Snake Goddess remarked ironically, "Looks like we're too weak to even meet the threshold of the Four Spirits Sect."
<br><br>
All of the Eternal Realm warriors on the Other Shore were powerful enough to dominate a chaotic era. Especially during the chaotic era of the human race, where countless warriors in the Eternal Realm emerged like mushrooms after the rain.
<br><br>
Yet, it still took them a lot of effort to obtain a root-level bloodline, not to mention the origin-level bloodline or even the ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Fuxi were all arrogant. After all, they represented the human race, and each of them had dominated a great starry region before.
<br><br>
They rarely encountered someone on par with them in the 77th chaos, or at any other time in over one thousand rounds of chaos.
<br><br>
Despite that, they all felt disheartened upon hearing what the brush-wielder had said. It turned out that although they had reached the Eternal Realm, they still didn't meet the threshold set by the Four Spirits Sect. Naturally, they felt dejected.
<br><br>
Chapter 3890 The Destination Of The Key Zen was reminded by the Snake Goddess's words.
<br><br>
Then, he asked the brush-wielder, "There is still one thing that I don't understand. According to what you said, the Four Spirits Sect will only recruit those who have entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard. But more than a thousand chaotic eras have passed, and it looks like I'm the only one who entered. Isn't that too high a threshold?"
<br><br>
In the current round of chaos, the only other person who had fused with the strongest bloodline was the Eye Spirit. Yet, even he had failed to reach the last room in the past.
<br><br>
If the Other Shore was surely a mechanism built to select talents for the Four Spirits Sect, it was a bit absurd for it to be so strict.
<br><br>
"The current Four Spirits Sect is no longer what it used to be. You should have known something about that in the Eternal Divine Courtyard," the brush-wielder said.
<br><br>
Zen nodded thoughtfully.
<br><br>
The Eternal Divine Courtyard was known as the main center of the Four Spirits Sect.
<br><br>
If they had abandoned even such an important center, then it wasn't hard to imagine what major crisis the Four Spirits Sect had undergone. He started to wonder if this force still existed.
<br><br>
"I've already answered your question. Now you should tell me how many light columns appeared when you integrated with the ancestry-level bloodline," the brush-wielder said.
<br><br>
After all, that was what the brush-wielder was most concerned about.
<br><br>
"All of them," replied Zen.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" The brush-wielder was confused at Zen's words for a moment.
<br><br>
"All three hundred and seventy-three kinds. The bloodline map on the square was completely activated. I've fused with the complete ancestrylevel bloodline," Zen explained nonchalantly.
<br><br>
The truth was that even he didn't get why he obtained the complete ancestry-level bloodline. He was no less curious and confused than the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
He had discussed the problem with the Primeval Lord of Heaven on his way back to the Eternal Scroll Painting from the Eternal Divine Courtyard. He tried to figure it out, but he didn't find any clues that could lead to the truth.
<br><br>
As for the brush-wielder, he fell silent again after hearing Zen's answer. The fox girl beside him blinked with confusion. She could sense the unusual emotions from the brush-wielder.
<br><br>
"The complete bloodline map... As far as I know, no one in the Four Spirits Sect has ever managed to activate it. They couldn't even activate a complete single quadrant," the brush-wielder murmured.
<br><br>
There were a total of four quadrants on the bloodline map, which included the destruction quadrant, the life quadrant, the creation quadrant and the space-time quadrant. If any of them was fully activated, the result would undoubtedly be an immensely strong bloodline.
<br><br>
However, to initiate even a single quadrant required more than ninety light columns to be activated. Someone in the Four Spirits Sect had used a unique method to achieve this, but not when they were merging with the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
Therefore, the brush-wielder concluded that it was a nearly impossible task.
<br><br>
Since he also didn't see it for himself, Zen's words sounded absurd to him.
<br><br>
"How will you prove that?" he asked further.
<br><br>
In reality, the truth of the matter made no difference to him — but it was something he had never heard of, so he couldn't help but feel curious.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen blinked and thought for a while.
<br><br>
First of all, he couldn't use the complete ancestry-level bloodline at his will.
<br><br>
Second, his control over it wasn't that good ever since he had merged with it. Most of the time, the ancestry-level bloodline only worked automatically to help him.
<br><br>
For example, it could help him identify the composition of all energies, or adjust the kinds of energies he used to restrain those of his opponents.
<br><br>
After thinking for a while, he stretched out his hand. With a surge of the ancestry-level bloodline inside his body, a specific type of energy suddenly appeared in his palm.
<br><br>
That was the first kind of energy in the life quadrant.
<br><br>
Afterward, that energy continually changed. It changed from the first kind to the second, the third, then the fourth.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the brush-wielder observed the ever-changing energy in Zen's palm for a long while. Finally, he let out a short, wry laugh and said, "No wonder... no wonder you can freely combine the abilities of the bloodline.
<br><br>
How did you obtain all the abilities on the map?"
<br><br>
He had once controlled all the passageways to the Eternal Divine Courtyard, so he had seen a lot of talents from different secondary worlds.
<br><br>
However, no matter how amazing and extraordinary they were, none of them achieved the same thing as Zen.
<br><br>
Furthermore, even the geniuses of the Four Spirits Sect couldn't do that as well.
<br><br>
It was a miracle that such a thing happened to Zen.
<br><br>
"I don't know," Zen answered earnestly.
<br><br>
Both the brush-wielder and the fox girl were rendered speechless.
<br><br>
They exchanged silent looks and wondered how they should react.
<br><br>
In any case, Zen had greatly exceeded the expectations of the brush-wielder no matter what.
<br><br>
Of course, that boosted his confidence in the future. "Sir, may I leave now?"
<br><br>
Zen asked.
<br><br>
He had stayed in the Eternal Scroll Painting for too long, and he didn't want to waste any more time in the place.
<br><br>
"Of course you can," the brush-wielder nodded, "but I have one more thing to tell you."
<br><br>
"Please go ahead," Zen said without much surprise.
<br><br>
During his journey from the Soul City to the Land of Bone Tribulation, then to the Eternal Scroll Painting, he had sensed that things had gone too smoothly for him. It felt like everything had played out in a well-planned way.
<br><br>
Thus, he didn't believe that all of these happened only by sheer luck.
<br><br>
Still, no matter where all of these led him, they helped him grow stronger in the process. Therefore, he decided not to go against it for the time being.
<br><br>
The brush-wielder was one part of the plot.
<br><br>
Since he had passed through the Eternal Scroll Painting, Zen decided to know everything he could from him. "You've got a key in the Soul City, haven't you?" the brush-wielder asked.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen nodded.
<br><br>
Many people knew that Zen had entered the room at the top of the Soul City, so he couldn't be bothered to hide it.
<br><br>
"After you enter the Three Purities Stage, take the key to the center of the Jade Pure Realm," the brush-wielder said.
<br><br>
"The center of the Jade Pure Realm?" Zen arched an eyebrow in surprise.
<br><br>
"Yes. That's the core area of the Three Purities Stage," the brush-wielder added.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others also seemed astonished at the information.
<br><br>
If the entire Other Shore were to be divided into two parts, the first thirtytwo stages would be the first half, and the Three Purities Stage alone would be the other half.
<br><br>
Perhaps the Three Purities Stage wasn't large, but every Other Shore Token that came from it was far more powerful than those in the first thirty-two stages. Naturally, it was more dangerous there as well.
<br><br>
Now, even the Grand Pure Realm was much dangerous, let alone the Supreme Pure Realm.
<br><br>
As for the Jade Pure Realm, very few people, including those from the ruling forces, entered that area throughout all chaotic eras.
<br><br>
Even the Element Spirit Civilization, who was said to have occupied the Three Purities Stage, didn't know much about the Jade Pure Realm.
<br><br>
As for the center of the Jade Pure Realm, it meant the innermost part of the Three Purities Stage.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't know what was inside there, or what kind of danger awaited them in that place.
<br><br>
"What will I find there? Is it a door that needs a key?" Zen asked with a smile. To his surprise, the brush-wielder nodded.
<br><br>
"You're right. It's a door buried in the ground. You have to open it!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
"What's inside it?" Zen asked curiously. "Someone will answer you after you open it," the brush-wielder replied.
<br><br>
"But I don't have to open it. Maybe it's not necessarily a good thing for me.
<br><br>
So, you have to tell me what's in there," Zen shot back with a smile.
<br><br>
Despite his threat, the brush-wielder did not seem to care at all. Then, he floated up in the air and said in an ethereal voice, "You will go there anyway. This world is the last pure land. You won't just stand by and watch this pure land collapse. Since he has blessed you, you cannot escape this fate..."
<br><br>
Soon enough, the brush-wielder disappeared from his view and left the fox girl behind, who still stared at him in disbelief.
<br><br>
Chapter 3891 Explosion The fox girl stared up at Zen with a faint smile. "Actually, there is something that you don't need to know so clearly."
<br><br>
Zen scoffed. "Are you willing to just be a chess piece?" he asked her.
<br><br>
The fox girl tutted but there was a trace of envy in her eyes as she looked at him.
<br><br>
"Even so, you're the most important chess piece," she told him.
<br><br>
In fact, not many people were qualified to become chess pieces in the game in the first place.
<br><br>
Zen, however, found no honor in this. "I don't want to be a chess piece," he said. "I want to be the player." "The player," the fox girl repeated with a smile. "Those who played chess and those who watched by the sidelines have all died. There is no player now. Nobody can control you. It's all up to you."
<br><br>
She was able to get the knowledge of the Four Spirits Sect from the brushwielder.
<br><br>
"The chaos was never the main battlefield but just a lucky survivor of the fiercer wars that occurred outside it. The war within the Four Spirit Sect, however, will ultimately affect the chaos so it must continue in another way.
<br><br>
You are the key figure on one side of this war," she explained.
<br><br>
Zen had an idea which side it was. "The side of the Finale Way?"
<br><br>
She nodded in confirmation. "Yes."
<br><br>
Of course, even if she didn't tell Zen, he and the Primeval Lord of Heaven would be able to reach the same conclusion through deduction.
<br><br>
However, there was one more thing Zen wanted to know. "Who is the leader of the opposite side?"
<br><br>
The fox girl merely shrugged. "I have no idea. The brush-wielder has hidden this information for his reasons. Don't think about it too much.
<br><br>
Anyway, I'll be sending you out..."
<br><br>
As they followed the path drawn by the brush-wielder, the fox girl and Zen eventually returned to the edge of the third page. Since the Eternal Scroll Painting had already closed, it meant that this passageway was now closed.
<br><br>
However, since everything here was controlled by the brush-wielder, it wasn't too difficult for him to open up a temporary exit.
<br><br>
Since the closing of the Eternal Scroll Painting, the entire Grand Plain Stage had returned to its former peace though the aura of killing intent was heavy in the air.
<br><br>
A piece of news floated about: the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race were finally able to grasp the method of descent and were now able to transfer the battlefield to the chaos.
<br><br>
Buzz! Whoosh! A light column fell from the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting that floated in the air, and smashed onto the bronze ground of the Grand Plain Stage, where the Three Purities Stones were situated.
<br><br>
It was only a flash of light but it attracted attention just the same. Many Other Shore creatures quickly gathered around the area to check what exactly was going on.
<br><br>
As he moved his body around, Zen felt a sort of connection. When he looked back at his statues on the Three Purities Stone, he felt that he was connected to them by blood.
<br><br>
Through the anchor bodies, Zen was able to connect to the power from the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
While Zen crawled out of the bronze ground, he found a few creatures scattered about, their eyes wide with shock as they looked at him.
<br><br>
"It's that human!"
<br><br>
"He's not dead! Does this mean that he also reached the Eternal Realm?"
<br><br>
"I have to go back and report this!"
<br><br>
Before the Eternal Scroll Painting opened, Zen managed to leave a deep impression onto the Other Shore races in the Grand Plain Stage. Even those who were on the neutral side began to attach great importance to him.
<br><br>
A few of the creatures intended to report this matter to their respective leaders right away while a couple of them decided to approach Zen first and ask him what happened.
<br><br>
However, Zen had no time to answer their inquiries. He was too worried about the Oneness Sky Palace, so without any pause, he began to recite the Illusion Breaking Rune.
<br><br>
From above, a lightning dragon appeared and nose-dived to the ground before it disappeared without a trace. Soon enough, the land within a ten thousand-mile radius from where it disappeared turned a charred black.
<br><br>
Boom! Terrifying lighting broke through the earth as huge rocks and mountains were thrown into the air along with the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.
<br><br>
The two of them looked very miserable. The Grandmaster of Heaven was one of the biggest crises they'd ever met.
<br><br>
Whoosh! A mountain soared past them under the force of lighting and blocked the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.
<br><br>
Fuxi circled his hands and the Eight Diagrams disk rotated above his head.
<br><br>
"Help me!" he shouted desperately. The Snake Goddess nodded.
<br><br>
"Okay!"
<br><br>
She sat cross-legged in midair and a shadow that mirrored the same gesture appeared behind her.
<br><br>
Energy beams emanated from her and turned into thin needles that stabbed towards Fuxi.
<br><br>
Puff! Puff! Puff! Once the needles pierced into Fuxi's body, the shadow of Snake Goddess quickly deflated.
<br><br>
Buzz! A flash of red light glinted in Fuxi's eyes and the Eight Diagrams disk above him rotated at an impossibly fast rate.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Fuxi's aura began to increase dramatically! The Snake Goddess's face also flashed with a fierce expression as the power of her bloodline also served and replenished her shadow's energy.
<br><br>
This secret technique served to enhance Fuxi's strength.
<br><br>
Drawing out the power of her bloodline would cause great damage to her but it was worth it if it meant that they would get out of this alive.
<br><br>
Her face paled and aged in a manner of seconds while her eyes, which used to be filled with wisdom, also dimmed.
<br><br>
Boom! As the purple lightning split the mountain, the Grandmaster of Heaven reappeared.
<br><br>
He gave them a sinister smile. "You should be proud for having resisted this long, however, this is your last..."
<br><br>
Before he could finish his words, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on his body.
<br><br>
This mark was surrounded by a circle of ominous, blood-red light.
<br><br>
Boom! Fuxi bid his time and now, the power of his palm had increased several times especially with the Snake Goddess's help.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven's body flew away upon contact with Fuxi's overpowered palm.
<br><br>
Of course, Fuxi knew one strike wasn't going to defeat him. "Again!"
<br><br>
He and the Snake Goddess quickly teleported and reappeared above the Grandmaster of Heaven's body.
<br><br>
Buzz! Another blood-red mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on his body. In such a passive position, the Grandmaster of Heaven reflexively raised Zen's body on his shoulder.
<br><br>
The mark of Eight Diagrams was then transferred to Zen's body.
<br><br>
Just as Fuxi was about to deal his attack, he stopped upon seeing the mark on Zen's body. The Snake Goddess behind him frowned at the sight of this.
<br><br>
Had Zen's body undergone a new change? How did this happen? Zen's body had previously been a black hole that sucked in any sort of energy laid on him. Since the mark of Eight Diagrams was also a type of energy, it should've been absorbed by him.
<br><br>
How did it end up imprinted on his body? Could he no longer absorb energy? A trace of confusion also appeared in the Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes.
<br><br>
He had personally come for Zen and he wouldn't want to see him die in Fuxi's hands.
<br><br>
As he thought about it for a while, the Grandmaster of Heaven decided to throw Zen into his Fishing Drum where he had also previously thrown the Chaos Ancient God named Othniel.
<br><br>
This Fishing Drum was a spatial treasure filled with the power of space and Zen should have been able to absorb the power within it due to his special body.
<br><br>
However, since he had lost this ability now, he would naturally be absorbed into the Fishing Drum.
<br><br>
Chapter 3892 Break Being tricked and trapped in the Fishing Drum by the Grandmaster of Heaven filled Othniel with hatred and anger.
<br><br>
In a rage, he activated his bloodline power in an attempt to break free from the Heart-piercing Lock.
<br><br>
He was the master of the truth after all! Was this guy so powerful that he could defy even the truth? Othniel was unconvinced; he didn't believe such a ridiculous freak existed in the chaos.
<br><br>
He had been trapped for some time when something flashed in the distance and another figure flew in. It was Zen.
<br><br>
He appeared to still be unconscious, floating aimlessly in the space.
<br><br>
Othniel sighed helplessly as he looked on at this new trophy of the Grandmaster of Heaven. Even with no Chaos Ancient God to support them, the Nihility race had still come out of this battle totally victorious.
<br><br>
As Othniel was growing more and more upset, Zen suddenly opened his eyes.
<br><br>
Zen's real body was still in the Oneness Sky Palace when he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting from the Grand Plain Stage. He had his concerns for the Oneness Sky Palace but assumed not too much could happen in a short period of time.
<br><br>
However, he opened his eyes to find that he was not in the Flow Sword Sect, but in some strange space.
<br><br>
If circumstances were normal, the people of the Oneness Sky Palace would not move him.
<br><br>
If they were left with no choice but to move him, they must have suffered something catastrophic.
<br><br>
These thoughts began racing through his mind when he felt there was someone behind him. He turned around and saw Othniel.
<br><br>
"Mount?" Zen queried, raising his eyebrows.
<br><br>
The Othniel in front of him was in human form and looked exactly the same as the Mount he had encountered before. Naturally, at a glance, Zen recognized him as Mount.
<br><br>
"No, you're not Mount. You're much stronger. You are the Chaos Ancient God Othniel!"
<br><br>
This person before him had an aura incomprehensibly stronger than Mount's. It was impossible for him to have improved his strength to such a level, no matter how fast he worked. Zen knew the relationship between Mount and Othniel very well and so quickly surmised that this was in fact Othniel in front of him.
<br><br>
"So what?" snorted Othniel.
<br><br>
He treated Zen as simply the loot of the Grandmaster of Heaven. They were trapped here with no possibility of getting out and so he reacted unpleasantly in his unhappiness.
<br><br>
"Where are we? Why am I here with you?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
Othniel glanced over at him with a hint of pity in his eyes. It seemed as though Zen still didn't understand the situation he was in.
<br><br>
"This is a space treasure," said Othniel flatly, "the space treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven to be exact. He's trapped you here!"
<br><br>
"The space treasure of the Grandmaster of Heaven?" Zen's face changed and his voice trembled slightly with nervousness. "The Grandmaster of Heaven! He's descended to the chaos?"
<br><br>
Zen knew Fuxi had handed the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits over to the Black Ship, but would the Grandmaster of Heaven really descend to the chaos so soon? "Did he land at the Bloom Divine Province?"
<br><br>
This change in Zen brought joy to Othniel's heart. He then couldn't help himself and blurted out, "Bloom Divine Province? The Oneness Sky Palace is gone. How could he possibly have landed on the Bloom Divine Province!"
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace is gone?" Zen's face darkened and his voice seemed distant, lost in his thoughts.
<br><br>
"My guess is that anyone left from the Oneness Sky Palace is dead. I wonder whether the two old fellows: Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, have died. You know what, they're probably dead too..." Othniel said mockingly.
<br><br>
Zen burned with anger at these words.
<br><br>
He hadn't expected such a horror to befall the Oneness Sky Palace once he entered the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
"Anger is useless. Even I can't break free from the Heart-piercing Lock and all you can do is stay here and do nothing," Othniel remarked as he stretched his hand out and pulled at the chain at his chest which sealed the space truth.
<br><br>
"Heart-piercing Lock?" Zen looked down at himself and said, "I don't have any chains on me."
<br><br>
"What?" Othniel exclaimed perplexed.
<br><br>
He then realized Zen had been unconscious and so the Grandmaster of Heaven probably didn't think about it too much when he threw him into the Fishing Drum. Zen was not trapped by the Heart-piercing Lock.
<br><br>
But...
<br><br>
As fast as this little glimmer of hope appeared, it disappeared just as quickly.
<br><br>
The Fishing Drum itself was also an extremely powerful space treasure.
<br><br>
Even if he was in his best condition, it would still require some great theurgies to break it. This was impossible for Zen with his current strength.
<br><br>
He might be able to break the Heart-piercing Lock for him, but the lock was under the Grandmaster of Heaven's control. The slightest movement would alert him so that wouldn't work either.
<br><br>
Both Othniel and Zen observed each other closely.
<br><br>
Zen saw the subtle changes in Othniel at this news; he could see how eager he was to escape this place! He thought it through and asked, "Does the Grandmaster of Heaven carry this Fishing Drum on him?"
<br><br>
"I think so," answered Othniel.
<br><br>
"If I help you get out, can you take care of the Grandmaster of Heaven?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, serious and hopeful.
<br><br>
Othniel and the Grandmaster of Heaven were enemies too. Since he had trapped Othniel, it must mean they were against each other.
<br><br>
"You? Get me out? I think you've underestimated this place," Othniel said with a cheeky smile. He believed it impossible for Zen to pull it off. But his eyes festered with hatred and he said, "But if I do get out, I'll tear that guy to pieces, no doubt!"
<br><br>
"Underestimated?"
<br><br>
Zen then unfurled a finger and waved it gently and a hint of space fluctuation spread from his fingertip.
<br><br>
Othniel rolled his eyes when he felt it.
<br><br>
As the Son of Truth in charge of the entire space in the chaos, anyone using the space theurgy in front of him was but a jester juggling before a king.
<br><br>
This human brat knew who he was and still dared attempt this. He was too full of himself.
<br><br>
"Don't waste your energy. You can't break the Fishing Drum," Othniel said disdainfully.
<br><br>
But then, a ripple appeared in this strange space inside the Fishing Drum.
<br><br>
The entire space sank in towards Zen's fingertip and then spread out in all directions.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
Othniel's eyes widened in disbelief.
<br><br>
Ordinary beings would not have been able to understand what he had done, but Othniel was so sensitive to space that he immediately understood that he had changed the state of the space within the Fishing Drum in an instant! He was actually capable of controlling a top space treasure quickly and effortlessly.
<br><br>
This was not something a human should be able to do! Even he could only break the Fishing Drum by force. Controlling the space treasure from the inner space would take ages! "Now do you believe that I can get you out?" Zen asked solemnly. "I can help you remove those chains as well, but you have to help me deal with the Grandmaster of Heaven once you're out."
<br><br>
"You can break the Heart-piercing Lock too?"
<br><br>
Othniel was still in shock, and truthfully, a little confused by all this.
<br><br>
Although he still did not believe it, this time he was not so highly skeptical as he was before.
<br><br>
"It'll be easy."
<br><br>
With a blank face, Zen approached Othniel. The ancestry-level bloodline in his body began to surge and the three chains disintegrated at his fingertip.
<br><br>
Chapter 3893 Trap Everyone Othniel stared at Zen in horror, as if he was looking straight at a monster.
<br><br>
He was practically speechless.
<br><br>
It was only then that he finally realized why Yellow Thearch was so eager to take Zen away and why the Element Spirit race was so determined to get him.
<br><br>
Othniel swallowed thickly as he muttered a question to this horrifying freak in front of him. "How did you make it?"
<br><br>
Zen shot him an indifferent glance. "Why should I tell you? You can go out now."
<br><br>
Although he had fused with the ancestry-level bloodline, Zen's use of the blood was still limited in the usage of the inter-restriction properties between energies.
<br><br>
If worse came to worst and he had to fight head-on with beings like Othniel and Grandmaster of Heaven then he might not be able to make it.
<br><br>
Since he did not know much about what was happening outside, he needed to use Othniel's power.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was too busy fighting with the Snake Goddess and Fuxi that he didn't notice Zen sneakily changing the state of space in the Fishing Drum.
<br><br>
This change of space cut off the connection between the Grandmaster of Heaven and the space treasure.
<br><br>
However, the Heart-piercing Lock was a real thing connected to the Grandmaster of Heaven and the moment Zen broke the chains, the former's expression changed.
<br><br>
Fuxi took his opponent's distraction to his advantage and placed another mark of Eight Diagrams on the Grandmaster of Heaven's body.
<br><br>
Boom! Being hit by Fuxi's strike, the Grandmaster of Heaven was sent flying away. Despite the slight elevation in terms of advantage, both Fuxi and Snake Goddess felt a bit strange.
<br><br>
This was a life and death battle that even a powerful warrior like the Grandmaster of Heaven had to go all out with his attacks. That momentary distraction was unlike him. Did he, perhaps, encounter some sort of trouble? No matter what sort of trouble it was, the fact remained that they were currently embroiled in a battle to the death so Fuxi and the Snake Goddess showed no mercy. Their bodies flashed as they chased after the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
With no time to deal with his oncoming opponents, the Grandmaster of Heaven quickly flew backward in retreat.
<br><br>
He had been able to trap Othniel into the Fishing Drum effortlessly because he caught Othniel off guard. If Othniel really managed to escape, that would be the biggest trouble.
<br><br>
Since Othniel was still in the Fishing Drum, the Grandmaster of Heaven figured that it would take him a long time to completely break out which meant that he still had a chance to stop him.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
However, when the Grandmaster of Heaven was sent flying backwards, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess remained relentless in their pursuit.
<br><br>
"Damn it!" the Grandmaster of Heaven cursed.
<br><br>
Soon enough, he flipped his hands and the Six Soul Flags flew in the air. .
<br><br>
At his command, the Six Soul Flags moved on their own and emanated a cold aura that caused the temperature within a hundred-mile radius to drop significantly.
<br><br>
Refined with six powerful ghosts, the Six Soul Flags were formidable, and these ghosts could be considered the weapon spirits of the Six Soul Flags.
<br><br>
From within the flags, six black ghosts sporting a single horn on their heads rushed out and let out chilling howls.
<br><br>
Usually, these ghosts were the Grandmaster of Heaven's trump card and there was no way he'd use them on a regular fight. However, he was faced with no other choice if he had to deal with Othniel.
<br><br>
These ghosts would be enough to stop Fuxi and the Snake Goddess for him.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the ghosts all collectively headed straight towards Fuxi! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! At the approach of these ghosts, Fuxi simply held out his hand and branded all of them with marks of Eight Diagrams.
<br><br>
There were six, successive explosive sounds as the ghosts were blown away. They were not destroyed entirely but the Six Soul Flags still suffered heavy damages from Fuxi's attack.
<br><br>
The horrifying pained cries of the ghosts made the Grandmaster of Heaven even more distressed. He had to move fast since his trump card might not be enough to deter his opponents. He quickly raised the Fishing Drum and intended to use the power of space to bind Othniel.
<br><br>
However, the moment he grabbed it, his whole body froze.
<br><br>
The space treasure that had accompanied him for countless years was disconnected from him! Even the lock that bound Othniel had come undone. Could he have broken his Fishing Drum in such a short period of time? That was impossible! There was no way he could believe it.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to forcefully take control of the Fishing Drum, he heard a light sound coming from the Fishing Drum.
<br><br>
An invisible space fluctuation softly spread out along with the light dongs.
<br><br>
"Dong, dong! Dong, dong, dong!"
<br><br>
Soon the Fishing Drum emitted a series of rhythmic sounds.
<br><br>
Each soft bang was accompanied by the space fluctuation and even attracted Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's attentions.
<br><br>
"Dong-dong-dong! Dong-dong!"
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven could only stare at the Fishing Drum with a frown. He was astounded inside.
<br><br>
There were nine rhythms that the Fishing Drum could produce.
<br><br>
The one he was hearing now belonged to the eighth rhythm, which meant that the Fishing Drum was about to release the creatures he had trapped inside! What the hell?! How was that possible? The only one who was able to do that was him and him alone! Was it possible that Othniel grasped the method due to his understanding of space truth? "Buzz..."
<br><br>
Faced with the inevitable, the Grandmaster of Heaven could only watch as Othniel effortlessly came out of the Fishing Drum.
<br><br>
There was a shared look of unusual shock on both their faces as they looked at each other.
<br><br>
Othniel was shocked at Zen's ability. The Grandmaster of Heaven was understandably shocked that Othniel was able to come out.
<br><br>
'What is the matter with Othniel's expression? Why is he confused? Didn't he come out by himself?' Just as the Grandmaster of Heaven began to think that there might actually be more to this situation, the Fishing Drum began to beat once again.
<br><br>
"Dong-dong-dong! Dong-dong!"
<br><br>
It was still the eighth rhythm that signaled the release of a creature trapped within.
<br><br>
Soon enough, another person emerged from the drum. It was none other than Zen! The sight of the young man instantly cleared things up for the Grandmaster of Heaven. Zen had woken up! So that meant the one who released Othniel was Zen? Of course, this conclusion only led to more confusion. How in the world was this young man able to unlock the Heart-piercing Lock and take control of the Fishing Drum? "Zen?"
<br><br>
"He woke up?"
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, who stood by the side, were just as equally shocked.
<br><br>
If Zen was awake then that meant he left the Eternal Scroll Painting and managed to obtain a bloodline. He was now a warrior at the Eternal Realm! However, it would be difficult for him to unleash his newly obtained bloodline since he just reached the Eternal Realm. There was still no way he'd be able to contend with the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Also, there was the matter of his and Othniel's emergence from the Fishing Drum. How in the world were they able to do that? "I've helped you out, and now you have to hold up your side of the bargain," Zen told Othniel meaningfully.
<br><br>
His words made Fuxi and the Snake Goddess look at each other in shock.
<br><br>
Othniel was released by Zen? How?! What had happened to Zen? Othniel simply gave Zen a smile. "Of course! I'll make my move but none of you can leave."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the fluctuation of space truth began to gush out from his body in waves.
<br><br>
The bloodline theurgies of Chaos Ancient Gods were terrifying when they burst out. The only reason Othniel was imprisoned was because he had been caught off guard. It did not have anything to do with skill or power but pure, dumb luck on the Grandmaster of Heaven's part. That was why Othniel was resentful at his capture.
<br><br>
Now that Othniel was free, there was no way he was going to repeat his mistake.
<br><br>
He was determined to kill the Grandmaster of Heaven and afterwards, capture Zen! "Buzz!"
<br><br>
A huge, triangular pyramid appeared, spanning ten thousand miles. It was so big and stable that it formed a world on its own.
<br><br>
Othniel had pushed the space truth to the limit. This theurgy had exceedingly surpassed the Grandmaster of Heaven's Fishing Drum and made one thing clear: Othniel was not going to let anyone go! Chapter 3894 Restrain Everything At that moment, a burst of blue light shone from a side of the large triangular pyramid.
<br><br>
Upon closer inspection, it appeared that some obscure words formed tiny dots of light.
<br><br>
When the blue light lit up, so did the orange light on the second side of the triangular pyramid, then the purple light on the third side, and the grey light under everyone's feet.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked up at the triangular pyramid and frowned.
<br><br>
The six Chaos Ancient Gods were undoubtedly strong, and they possessed extraordinary power of the truth-level theurgy, which relied on the chaos.
<br><br>
Othniel gently raised his hand, and the four light rays quickly disappeared.
<br><br>
Then, the blue light flashed again, and the space fluctuation immediately surrounded the triangular pyramid. In turn, the Grandmaster of Heaven, Zen, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess all fell.
<br><br>
It turned out that the space rule in the triangular pyramid had changed.
<br><br>
Since the rule that they adapted to wasn't applicable anymore, they could not stay in the air.
<br><br>
However, they were aware of the space rule. As soon as the blue light flashed, they sensed that something was wrong. Therefore, they quickly adapted to the new space rule.
<br><br>
Among them, the Snake Goddess was the fastest to adapt. After she fell for more than one hundred feet, she abruptly stopped mid-air.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Fuxi and the Grandmaster of Heaven managed to stop and float in the air almost simultaneously.
<br><br>
The slowest one was Zen.
<br><br>
The blood in his body flowed around when the space rule had changed.
<br><br>
Moreover, he understood the essence of the triangular pyramid through the ancestry-level bloodline.
<br><br>
He had obtained the method to break the triangular pyramid, but he still needed to adapt to the rule by himself.
<br><br>
That was why he fell for over a thousand feet before he barely adapted to it.
<br><br>
Othniel sneered when he saw that everyone had steadied themselves in just a short period. Then, the blue light dimmed, and the orange light flashed.
<br><br>
The rule changed again! Everyone fell again, and they began to adapt to the new rule once more.
<br><br>
But just as they had adapted to it, the orange light faded, and the purple light glowed.
<br><br>
Othniel had set up a total of four space rules. Those sets of rules weren't that different from each other, but they could switch quickly.
<br><br>
To put it simply, when the lights on the four sides of the triangular pyramid switched, the rules regularly changed.
<br><br>
Even the Snake Goddess now found it hard to adapt to them. She had just adapted to the first rule, but in the next moment, she had to change for the second rule. Before she could fully adjust to the second one, she had to face the third rule! Buzz! Buzz! The large triangular pyramid shone with four kinds of light. Zen, the Grandmaster of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi finally fell hard to the bottom of the space.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the rules in the space were gone.
<br><br>
At the same time, Othniel's body changed, and rapidly expanded, until he turned into a massive one-eyed monster.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven looked gravely at the one-eyed monster. After all, he had no choice but to fight a Chaos Ancient God who was in peak form, while his space theurgy was lacking.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
At that point, he also grew into a giant with a height of millions of feet.
<br><br>
Since Othniel revealed his real body, then the Grandmaster of Heaven also activated the Wild God Body! The two gigantic creatures unleashed bursts of energy, which filled every corner of the space as if it was real. "It is better if the two of them get injured!" Fuxi yelled as he looked up at them.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter if they are injured or not. The most important thing is that we should leave, Master Fuxi!" a loud voice exclaimed behind him.
<br><br>
Fuxi turned around and saw Zen. He shook his head and said, "Leave? It might not be that easy to open this space!"
<br><br>
He stood at the bottom of the triangular pyramid on his tiptoes. It wasn't easy to destroy such a tough space imprisonment.
<br><br>
Zen was still too young, and his idea was too simple. "Zen, do you have a way to take us out?" the Snake Goddess slowly said as she stared at Zen.
<br><br>
Based on Zen's tone, it seemed that he had controlled the Fishing Drum to release Othniel. Furthermore, Othniel could not resist at all because the Heart-piercing Lock had restrained him. It was likely that Zen had broken the Heart-piercing Lock.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess didn't know how Zen had such an incredible ability, but that was most likely related to the bloodline he had obtained. But what kind of bloodline could be so unbelievable? "What kind of way can he have?" Fuxi shrugged.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Fuxi, squatted down, and gently scratched the ground with his finger. A circular mark appeared on the transparent ground.
<br><br>
Clap! He pushed the mark hard, and then a round hole appeared.
<br><br>
"What the hell is this method?" Fuxi's eyes widened.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess covered her mouth in shock, and smiled. She walked towards the round hole.
<br><br>
No matter what kind of method it was, they should leave first.
<br><br>
The three of them entered the hole, turned into three beams of light, and rushed into the space channel.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Othniel and the Grandmaster of Heaven were still in battle inside the triangular pyramid. The triangular pyramid completely isolated both their auras and voices.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven attacked in a slightly passive way since he still couldn't use the Space Law. However, he was still stronger than Othniel.
<br><br>
The two of them fiercely kept fighting each other.
<br><br>
Othniel had sensed that Zen penetrated the triangular pyramid he had released, but he had no time to care about that because he currently focused on his battle against the Grandmaster of Heaven. Thus, he had no choice but to let Zen run away.
<br><br>
In the space channel, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Zen all flew at high speed.
<br><br>
Although they were still in danger, Fuxi couldn't wait to ask, "How did you do it? You shouldn't be able to suppress or control both the Fishing Drum and the Grandmaster of Heaven."
<br><br>
When Zen casually drew a circular mark just now, it looked simple, but Fuxi felt the unique energy from it. That energy was also a kind of space power, but it was very different from Othniel's.
<br><br>
Othniel's space power came from the truth. And what kind of power did Zen use? The opposite truth? He felt amused by his guess, but that was his intuition.
<br><br>
On the contrary, the Snake Goddess attentively listened as she didn't have any baseless speculations.
<br><br>
Since Zen had entered the deepest part of the Eternal Scroll Painting and successfully came back, he must've obtained a unique bloodline power, and at least it was stronger than that of the Eye Spirit.
<br><br>
"I can find a way to restrain the opponents in a short period of time," Zen said.
<br><br>
Fuxi narrowed his eyes and gently waved his hand at Zen. The mark of the Eight Diagrams appeared on his body. "Is there any way to restrain it?"
<br><br>
He had never heard of a theurgy that could restrain the Grandmaster of Heaven and Othniel in a short period, so of course, he wanted to verify it in person.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen got up and dusted his body. The mark of the Eight Diagrams just fell off him like dust.
<br><br>
When Fuxi saw what happened, the corners of his eyes twitched.
<br><br>
Chapter 3895 Encounter 'This guy is really...' Fuxi sighed silently with profound resignation.
<br><br>
Initially, while he was at the bottom of the chaos, he was honestly not convinced that Gerald had chosen Zen. However, now it seemed that Gerald had a foresight.
<br><br>
He then realized that Zen was indeed the person that they could rely on, and was also the most suitable person to complete the Finale Way in this round of chaos.
<br><br>
The news that Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven fought for Zen in the Grand Plain Stage had been spread to the Pear Hill. The two top masters on the Other Shore might have already expected this.
<br><br>
Even so, Zen's magical bloodline was still beyond everyone's expectations.
<br><br>
While Fuxi was lost in thought, the Snake Goddess's eyes flashed. "Eh?"
<br><br>
In that moment, she sensed a strong space fluctuation in the distance. She felt as though the fluctuation contained a familiar aura and full vitality.
<br><br>
She then gracefully stretched out two fingers. From there, two strands of crimson energy rubbed against each other and produced a violent reaction.
<br><br>
At the same time, the formed energy let out a sharp scream, which could be transmitted far away in the space channel.
<br><br>
The fluctuation in the distance suddenly stopped and swiftly approached the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
Soon, an unexpected visitor appeared in the space channel. It was the Chaos Ancient God, Gerald.
<br><br>
Previously, he was trapped by the strange black fire released by the Grandmaster of Heaven. The black fire could hardly be put out, so it took a lot of time for him to completely extinguish it.
<br><br>
After successfully putting out the black fire, he hurriedly dashed forward to catch up.
<br><br>
However, after the fierce battle between the Grandmaster of Heaven and Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, the group had already been far away from him.
<br><br>
Gerald continued to travel through several large provinces and unexpectedly met the Snake Goddess and the other two here.
<br><br>
"Are you all right?"
<br><br>
After taking a look at the Snake Goddess and Fuxi, he turned to look at Zen.
<br><br>
He was most concerned about Zen. The sincerity was reflected in his tone as he spoke.
<br><br>
"Yeah," the Snake Goddess replied. "While the Grandmaster of Heaven was fighting with Othniel, we took the opportunity to escape."
<br><br>
"What happened?" Gerald asked worriedly. What he just heard had him stunned.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess then told Gerald about the fact that Zen had released Othniel. The latter was so shocked upon hearing this revelation that he could not help but let out several cries in disbelief.
<br><br>
"However, we can't stay here for too long. If the two of them figure it out, I'm afraid they will stop fighting and start to head out for us," Gerald said quietly.
<br><br>
In fact, the Grandmaster of Heaven, Othniel, and Claire fought for the same reason. They all wanted to kill each other and get Zen.
<br><br>
All they wanted starting from the very beginning was Zen.
<br><br>
The fight between the Grandmaster of Heaven and Othniel was meaningless other than for the purpose of getting revenge.
<br><br>
"You're right. We can't stay here for too long," the Snake Goddess said with a nod.
<br><br>
"Come on."
<br><br>
Just as he spoke, Gerald grew to several times bigger than before, like a massive ship floating in front of the three people.
<br><br>
The three skillfully jumped onto Gerald's back, and Gerald sped along the space channel at high speed.
<br><br>
Although Gerald was not like Othniel who could control the space truth, he was better than the Snake Goddess and Fuxi in terms of speed.
<br><br>
Standing on Gerald's back, Fuxi sighed. Gerald had always been arrogant, but now surprisingly, he was willing to carry them on his back, all thanks to Zen.
<br><br>
Swoosh! The air let out a sound as they dashed swiftly.
<br><br>
They headed west for the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
After passing two provinces in a row, they were finally able to enter the Victory Province, through which they would arrive in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
As soon as they entered the Victory Province, they saw a golden light flash by the mountain range in the distance. Then, a bolt of golden lightning as thick as a bucket swept upward.
<br><br>
Suddenly, a powerful sound shook the whole area. Boom! The sound echoed and shook the ground slightly.
<br><br>
It was obvious that some people were fighting in the mountain, creating the booming sound.
<br><br>
They might be at the Holy Soul Realm at least.
<br><br>
Zen heard from the Snake Goddess that after the flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace were broken, the elites of the palace could not do anything but walk towards the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
It was very likely that the people who were fighting were from the palace.
<br><br>
"I'll go and have a look,"
<br><br>
Zen said before leaping towards the sound's direction. In a flash, Zen's figure was up in the air and reached the top of the mountain.
<br><br>
A huge crack, as deep as a hundred thousand feet, was formed in the middle of the mountain.
<br><br>
At the bottom of the crack, Flamine carried the red crystal which contained Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Her black hair was disheveled and her clothes were dirty and ripped. She was no longer as elegant and dignified as before.
<br><br>
Beside her stood Athemar, Goran and Pearce, each holding a sharp and glimmering sword.
<br><br>
Zen was gone. For now, their top priority was to send Eastern Emperor Taiyi to the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Finally, they had already arrived in the Victory Province. They were exhausted and catching their breath. They had never expected that they would be hunted down by the Bearing race on the way.
<br><br>
Above the crack stood the Five-element Emissaries of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
During the fierce battle just now, two of the Five-element Emissaries were injured by Pearce. Because of this, they didn't dare to attack by force for the time being. Instead, they continued to display their theurgies above the crack.
<br><br>
The golden lightning that appeared earlier was the Golden Toad Lightning released by the Metal Emissary.
<br><br>
After releasing the Golden Toad Lightning, the Metal Emissary spoke in a sharp voice, "No matter what, you're all dead. Why don't you hand over Eastern Emperor Taiyi? If you do so, we can still let you go."
<br><br>
This time, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race all came out, and they had suffered a great defeat.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer fled with the Yellow Thearch's broken body, and the remaining members scattered in different directions.
<br><br>
The Five-element Emissaries were the elites of the Bearing race, and their status was only second to that of the Yellow Thearch. It was difficult for them to accept such a crushing defeat, but as they were unable to join the battle for Zen, they then just aimed their attacks at Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.
<br><br>
They were divided into two groups. The Holy Soul Realm masters of the New Moon race and the Divine Farmer race were responsible for chasing after Yasamin, while the Five-element Emissaries were responsible for chasing after Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
They chased desperately all the way and finally caught up with Pearce and his group in the Victory Province.
<br><br>
As they joined hands with each other, their strength doubled and they were able to block the way of Pearce and the others below. If it weren't for the fact that they were afraid of the mysterious swordsmanship theurgies of Pearce and Goran, they would have already killed them.
<br><br>
Standing behind Flamine, Elvinia looked up at the five people in the sky.
<br><br>
She was frowning and was confused. She didn't expect the situation to change so fast.
<br><br>
The day Zen was trapped in the Eternal Scroll Painting, all the people of the Oneness Sky Palace began to flee, but they were still unable to escape this chaos.
<br><br>
If Eastern Emperor Taiyi died, the Oneness Sky Palace would completely disappear in the Source World.
<br><br>
Thinking of this, Elvinia couldn't fathom what was happening. It was as if she were dreaming.
<br><br>
"Let us go? Huh. Do you think I'm a fool?" Pearce's cold voice floated up along the crack. He scoffed as he finished his sentence.
<br><br>
He had decided to fight until his last breath. There was no uncertainty in his tone or his expression.
<br><br>
Besides, even if he retreated, he would surely die. It was then better to take this opportunity and fight head on.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha! If you keep wasting time like this, you won't be able to escape death in the end. Why don't you just do as I say?"
<br><br>
Realizing that they wouldn't surrender, the Metal Emissary laughed wildly.
<br><br>
Then, another Golden Toad Lightning as thick as a bucket smashed down powerfully.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Explosive sounds covered the whole area once again.
<br><br>
The surroundings were chaotic. Broken stones flew and dust filled the air, making it difficult to see.
<br><br>
Pearce, Athemar and the others tried their best to defend themselves, but in the end, they still failed. Just as what the Metal Emissary said, they would die at the bottom of the crack sooner or later.
<br><br>
"Let's fight them to death!"
<br><br>
"Lady Flamine, run away with Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Princess Elvinia.
<br><br>
I'll pin them down!"
<br><br>
"Even if I die, I will die fighting and they shall die with me!"
<br><br>
Determination was written all over the faces of Pearce, Athemar, and Goran. They still had a way to win, and that was to burn their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Chapter 3896 Rescue The power of the three masters at the Holy Soul Realm burning their Other Shore Tokens would be quite intimidating.
<br><br>
However, they had to pay the price of such power with their lives.
<br><br>
"But..." Flamine hesitated. If they stayed, the reinforcements would come to aid them.
<br><br>
She pitied the lives of these elders of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Don't hesitate!" Pearce said seriously. "As soon as we go out, follow us,"
<br><br>
Athemar declared with determination in his eyes.
<br><br>
When the three of them were about to go out and burn their Other Shore Tokens, they heard a voice from above.
<br><br>
"Since you can't escape death anyway, I can let you die a little faster," the voice said.
<br><br>
Upon hearing the voice, Pearce and the others were shocked.
<br><br>
Elvinia tilted her head and looked up at the sky. The owner of the familiar voice stood opposite the Five-Element Emissaries.
<br><br>
Coincidentally the owner of the voice also looked down. Although he was a hundred thousand feet away, Elvinia felt that he was close, and a strange warm feeling filled her heart.
<br><br>
Ordinary people would be overjoyed if they survived a disaster, but Elvinia wasn't. The warm feeling overwhelmed her senses, and she was calm and happy.
<br><br>
"Is that Zen?"
<br><br>
"Is he awake?"
<br><br>
"Has he made it to the Eternal Realm?"
<br><br>
Even at such a critical moment, what they cared about was still whether Zen had reached the Eternal Realm or not.
<br><br>
If he had reached the Eternal Realm, then it naturally meant that he was stronger and might be able to defeat the Five-Element Emissaries.
<br><br>
Speaking of the Five-Element Emissaries, they were all stunned when they saw Zen, who appeared like a ghost.
<br><br>
They weren't concerned about the battles of the masters at the Eternal Realm. After all, those had nothing to do with them.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the Pear Hill only had Fuxi and the Snake Goddess. They should be the weakest of the three parties, and they would surely be defeated.
<br><br>
However, did it mean that the Pear Hill had won since Zen appeared safe and sound? While the Five-Element Emissaries had yet to recover from their shock, the leader, the Metal Emissary, coldly said, "He is all alone, and he has just reached the Eternal Realm. He's no match for the five of us!"
<br><br>
The Five-Element Emissaries were extremely powerful if they worked together. They could even fight Eternal Realm warriors.
<br><br>
Since Zen had just reached the Eternal Realm, there was a big difference between his strength and the senior Eternal Realm warriors'. Moreover, he was alone, so the Five-Element Emissaries didn't take him seriously.
<br><br>
When the Metal Emissary finished speaking, he pointed towards Zen.
<br><br>
Boom! The Golden Toad Lightning, as thick as a bucket, hit Zen's body.
<br><br>
The moment it touched him, the ancestry-level bloodline inside his body fluctuated, and he learned about the Golden Toad Lightning's structure.
<br><br>
"The branch of the third lightning energy from the destruction area. It is not pure, and very weak."
<br><br>
He reached out and grabbed the golden lightning in his hand.
<br><br>
Because the lightning itself didn't have a real body, it could only flash by.
<br><br>
However, it froze when he grabbed it. It was like a golden stone pillar, which extended from his hand to the front of the Metal Emissary.
<br><br>
Crack! He squeezed hard. The golden stone pillar began to crack, and it shattered into countless pieces on the ground.
<br><br>
The Primeval Lord of Heaven had once used the Imprisoning Lightning on the Other Shore to transform the lightning, which the Magical Thunder Slave had released, into Solid Lightning Powder. That Imprisoning Lightning was from Stage Thirty-three, and it was not easy to obtain it.
<br><br>
But with merely a thought, Zen had transformed the Golden Toad Lightning by using a method that was very different from the Primeval Lord of Heaven's.
<br><br>
"What kind of theurgy is that?"
<br><br>
Naturally, the Five-Element Emissaries were all confused. They couldn't figure out how Zen had solidified the lightning in an instant.
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter! Let's fight together!"
<br><br>
"Tribulation Array of Five Elements!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Each of the Five-Element Emissaries stood in their positions. Five different colored lights connected them, which formed a five-pointed star.
<br><br>
They activated their array, which released a powerful aura of energy. Then, a large lock flew from the array and shot towards Zen.
<br><br>
At that point, Pearce, Athemar, and Goran just came out of the crack. When they felt the power of the array, all of them looked alarmed.
<br><br>
"Zen, retreat! Even the real Eternal Realm masters can't resist the Tribulation Array of Five Elements!" Pearce shouted.
<br><br>
Zen was speechless when he heard Pearce's warning. Did Pearce mean that he was not a real Eternal Realm warrior? Splash! However, he didn't dodge.
<br><br>
He allowed the lock to land on his body. "Oh? Why didn't you dodge?" the Water Emissary said with raised brows. "How arrogant of you! You will die!" The Earth Emissary laughed manically.
<br><br>
On the contrary, the Fire Emissary looked vigilant.
<br><br>
Among the Five-Element Emissaries, the Fire Emissary was the first one who had encountered Zen.
<br><br>
Not long after Zen stepped onto the Other Shore, he had turned their temple in Stage Four upside down. At that time, they still didn't know who the mysterious man was.
<br><br>
He was not a proud and arrogant man. He must be confident in himself, so he dared to do the things he did.
<br><br>
As soon as the lock secured Zen, the ancestry-level bloodline inside his body fluctuated again.
<br><br>
The fluctuation of the ancestry-level bloodline caused by the Metal Emissary's attack and the Five-Element Emissaries' joint attack wasn't as intense as when it was against the Eternal Realm powerhouses.
<br><br>
"Part of the theurgies used by the Five-Element Emissaries are from the Element Spirit race, right?" Zen said. He grabbed the lock and pulled it slightly. "It's just so-so," he sighed.
<br><br>
Just as he was about to break the lock, he suddenly looked up at the sky.
<br><br>
The others didn't understand why he did that, but they also did the same.
<br><br>
"It seems that I don't need to do anything," Zen said and pursed his lips.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The space above suddenly shattered, and then a huge scorpion tail struck the Tribulation Array of Five Elements.
<br><br>
Gerald didn't need to use his poison needles on the Five-Element Emissaries because they were too weak.
<br><br>
His scorpion tail contained a potent amount of power, which was enough to break the Tribulation Array of Five Elements and crush the Five-Element Emissaries into meat paste.
<br><br>
The lock that bound Zen quickly disappeared when the Tribulation Array of Five Elements got destroyed.
<br><br>
"We don't have much time. We need to finish the battle as soon as possible,"
<br><br>
Gerald said.
<br><br>
Even though only his tail was exposed, Pearce, Goran, and the others were still shocked at his aura as a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
After all, they didn't expect that Zen came with Gerald! Yet, it wasn't the first time that the people from the Oneness Sky Palace had seen the world. When they realized that it was the Chaos Ancient God Gerald, they all cupped their hands towards him.
<br><br>
Soon enough, Flamine arrived with Elvinia and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.
<br><br>
Then everyone else jumped onto Gerald's back and headed for the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
While they traveled, Zen asked about Yasamin's whereabouts. Winchell, Auden, and the other elders of the Oneness Sky Palace escorted her. If they were lucky enough, they would be able to enter the Pear Hill's territory safely.
<br><br>
However, when he asked about Dorothy, no one responded to him.
<br><br>
According to Elvinia, Dorothy had been missing when Yasamin got trapped. When the people of the Oneness Sky Palace moved together, they still didn't see her.
<br><br>
Chapter 3897 Defending A frightening energy burst and flowed wildly throughout the huge triangular pyramid.
<br><br>
The black flames occupied almost the entire space, as if they burned up from the most ferocious hell.
<br><br>
And among it all, two gigantic creatures brawled like beasts in captive! The two powerful masters had used many theurgies and were now left with only their physical bodies to end this battle.
<br><br>
Othniel might have had an absolute advantage in terms of spatial transference, but he still could not get the upper hand on the Grandmaster of Heaven, who was giving it all he had. In fact, he was in grave danger.
<br><br>
"Can this space you've created really bear my hellfire all the time?" said the Grandmaster of Heaven, sneering.
<br><br>
The relentless, unending black fire released from the Six Soul Flags continued burning the space, causing numerous cracks to form.
<br><br>
If they continued to grow, eventually the entire space would collapse with an enormous bang.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven would then be free and Othniel would be no match for him.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Dozens of ten million-foot-long space blades sliced at the Grandmaster of Heaven. He responded by raising his Cyan Misty Sword and waving it gently, collapsing the space blades as soon as they were touched by the cyan light that came off the sword.
<br><br>
Othniel glanced at the cracks and a trace of worry crept into him, but he still allowed himself to say, "The space can withstand your flames for hundreds, even thousands of years!"
<br><br>
His body shuddered as he spoke and the cracks in the triangular pyramid quickly closed and the space recovered! He was unable to defeat the Grandmaster of Heaven here. He had basically already lost. The man before him had surpassed the Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
However, Othniel could delay this battle.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at the rapidly healing triangular pyramid and inquired, "You wish to take Zen away, right?"
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Othniel asked, staring down his opponent.
<br><br>
"This sort of battle is meaningless," said the Grandmaster of Heaven calmly. "They have already fled to the Pear Hill. At the very least, we should catch Zen and then we can resume this battle and find a winner!"
<br><br>
"You wish to call for peace?" Othniel asked astounded.
<br><br>
"I just think that it would allow us both to get what we need," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied smiling.
<br><br>
Othniel shook his head. "How do I know you won't just attack me once I let you out?"
<br><br>
This round of their bout revealed the gap between them to Othniel quite clearly; there was no way he would let the Grandmaster of Heaven go without caution.
<br><br>
"I will not attack you until I have destroyed the Pear Hill," the Grandmaster of Heaven answered earnestly.
<br><br>
"Why should I believe you?" Othniel asked, still not trusting him.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven pondered for a moment before saying, "I can swear with the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake."
<br><br>
The Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake was the captain of the Black Ship's Other Shore Token. Once an oath was made, the snake would form a huge restraint, and if one broke the oath, they would pay a heavy price.
<br><br>
Naturally, Othniel had heard of the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake.
<br><br>
His large single eye blinked as he considered this, but he still seemed unconvinced. "If you have the snake, I will trust you for now," he said finally.
<br><br>
"I don't, but someone else has it," said the Grandmaster of Heaven.
<br><br>
Soon after he spoke, several black ships came from the distance and stopped beside the triangular pyramid.
<br><br>
The captain in a black cloak stepped out of one of the ships and gently knocked on the wall of the space.
<br><br>
Othniel hesitated for a moment and then let the captain in.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven then made an oath using the Contractrestricting Twin-headed Snake, after which their battle finally subsided and the massive triangular pyramid was removed.
<br><br>
"Grandmaster of Heaven, are you off to the Pear Hill now?" asked the captain.
<br><br>
"Of course," he answered. He was a man of action and would not give the Pear Hill any chance of escape. He turned to Othniel and said, "Will you be joining me?"
<br><br>
Othniel snorted and was enveloped by a square space. In an instant, his huge body vanished right before the Grandmaster of Heaven and the members of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Their agreement was that the Grandmaster of Heaven would not make a move on Othniel before the Pear Hill was destroyed. Once that was done, no restriction existed and they would most likely battle for Zen once more.
<br><br>
The Grandmaster of Heaven was in such a hurry that Othniel could easily pretend it was none of his business.
<br><br>
The captain looked at the place where Othniel had disappeared and reminded, "Grandmaster of Heaven, I'm afraid Othniel will not leave so easily."
<br><br>
"Of course he will not leave," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, shrugging his shoulders with a stone faced expression. "And he can't leave either."
<br><br>
The captain did not understand what he had meant; he simply nodded, led him onto the ship and began heading west.
<br><br>
On the ship, the Evil God sat cross-legged, falling into a deep and strange trance.
<br><br>
When he closed his eyes, he still saw many large provinces in the distance, connected together.
<br><br>
Every time he entered a large province, an invisible tentacle extended towards him, trying to establish a connection.
<br><br>
Once it was completed, the Evil God was connected to this province.
<br><br>
Every detail of the entire province would be laid bare before his eyes, and the harm he suffered would be transferred to the boundary wall of the province.
<br><br>
This ability was very useful, but the Evil God was not satisfied with it.
<br><br>
Above his head was a space wider still; it was the entire Source World.
<br><br>
He could feel the tentacle representing the entire Source World, but it was only faintly visible, seeming to evade him.
<br><br>
His goal was to make contact with this tentacle.
<br><br>
Two hours after the Snake Goddess and the others returned to the Pear Hill, milky white clouds rose up above the whole province.
<br><br>
If one stood at the highest point in the Source World and looked down, they'd see that it seemed the largest mountain in the Source World had been covered in snow rather quickly.
<br><br>
The layers of clouds spread like a waterfall, creating a wondrous and beautiful scene.
<br><br>
The people in the Pear Hill, however, were not pleased but worried.
<br><br>
This was the Cloud Cover Array, the most powerful array of the Pear Hill, which had not been opened for a great many years. Its activation meant the Pear Hill now faced an incredibly formidable enemy.
<br><br>
Not long ago, When the Pear Hill was under constant provocation from the Bearing race, news arrived that the temporary peace in the Source World would probably not last much longer.
<br><br>
The reality often came faster than rumors...
<br><br>
After the Cloud Cover Array was set up, the whole Pear Hill was like a giant beast crawling across the ground.
<br><br>
Under the jadeite platform atop the Pear Hill, the nine mountain leaders and more than two hundred grand sect leaders had already gathered and awaited orders.
<br><br>
From the center of the platform, the Snake Goddess glanced at the mountain leaders and the grand sect leaders and said, "All the sects and mountains have to restrain their own disciples from going out. For the next several months, no one is allowed to leave."
<br><br>
The mountain leaders and grand sect leaders raised their heads and looked at the Snake Goddess in astonishment, their faces filled with confusion.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was in danger. They had to pledge to fight to the death to defend it. Why had the Snake Goddess suddenly issued this ban? Chapter 3898 The Restriction Of The Energy Shaft The leader of a mountain stepped forward and bowed before the Snake Goddess. "Snake Goddess, why are we banned from leaving our places?"
<br><br>
"If an enemy were to attack, all the elites of our Hot Mountain will go all out to fight. We will even be ready to give up our lives to protect our place!" Another mountain leader stepped forward, her lips set in a firm line.
<br><br>
These leaders of the various mountains and sects were loyal to the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
The crisis of the Pear Hill was also their crisis.
<br><br>
It would be a great insult to them if they couldn't stand up for it in times of danger.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked at them in silence and then at the cloudy sky.
<br><br>
She then said, "The battle we are going to face is not something you can participate in."
<br><br>
"Why can't we participate?"
<br><br>
"We aren't powerful enough, but we'd be pleased if we could do our bit!"
<br><br>
"Not even an outstanding warrior at the Holy Soul Realm like the leader of the Hot Mountain can participate?"
<br><br>
These mountain and sect leaders were also top-level masters at the Holy Soul Realm. If they couldn't even participate in the battle, what kind of enemy would the Pear Hill have to meet this time? The Snake Goddess shook her head and said, "Even Fuxi and I can't protect ourselves in the battle that is to come."
<br><br>
The leaders froze at these words.
<br><br>
The people of the Pear Hill had immense confidence in the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. The reason why the Pear Hill had stood there for so many years was because of these two people.
<br><br>
The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were powerful, but if the Pear Hill could come together, these two races might not be able to defeat them.
<br><br>
But the Snake Goddess was telling them that even she and Fuxi couldn't be sure of the fate they were about to meet in the coming battle. This was truly inconceivable.
<br><br>
"What kind of powerful existence in the Source World can make it difficult for you to protect yourself?" the leader of the Hot Mountain asked. .
<br><br>
"Are they the Chaos Ancient Gods?" the leader of the Witching Mountain pitched in. .
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded. "Yes, but also creatures that are stronger than them."
<br><br>
"Stronger than the Chaos Ancient Gods!"
<br><br>
"How could such creatures exist in the chaos?"
<br><br>
"..."
<br><br>
The many leaders of the mountains and the sects were stunned as the Snake Goddess told them that Other Shore creatures could descend to the Source World.
<br><br>
This was not a secret, and there was no need for her to hide it from her subordinates.
<br><br>
The mountain leaders remained silent for a moment, shocked to hear that the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire had descended to the Source World.
<br><br>
The leader of the Witching Mountain said, "Even if we are really mosquitoes in the grand scheme of things, we still have to contribute what little power we have."
<br><br>
"Yes!"
<br><br>
"Even if we die, we want to die a worthy death!"
<br><br>
"..."
<br><br>
The clamor began to rise but the Snake Goddess raised her hand to silence them all, exercising her absolute authority over them. .
<br><br>
"There is a way you can contribute your power while you are in the Pear Hill. The Cloud Cover Array can absorb your power," the Snake Goddess said.
<br><br>
"What if it absorbs all of our power?"
<br><br>
"There are so many of us and so many different kinds of power. Can the array make full use of our power?"
<br><br>
"The Cloud Cover Array couldn't really achieve that, could it?"
<br><br>
If so many different kinds of power were gathered together, it would be in what felt like a violent flame. Not being careful would result in one being hurt by their own power.
<br><br>
"The Cloud Cover Array can't do it, but someone else can," the Snake Goddess said. "She needs your power."
<br><br>
The leaders frowned at this. But their eyes soon lit up as they realized what it meant.
<br><br>
These powerful cultivators at the Holy Soul Realm knew many secrets of the Pear Hill. After all, the Snake Goddess hadn't really secretly trained Yan somewhere. What was more, Yan also needed a group of warriors at the Other Shore Realm and the Chaotic Source Realm to protect her when she roamed the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The secret of nurturing the Energy Shaft in Yan's body had already spread among the senior leaders.
<br><br>
That was how they guessed almost immediately that there might be a big breakthrough in the Energy Shaft being nurtured in Yan's body.
<br><br>
The moment the Chaos Ancient God, Gerald, entered the Pear Hill, he began to communicate with another two Chaos Ancient Gods, Kendrick and Judson.
<br><br>
The six Chaos Ancient Gods each took charge of one kind of truth. They also had different understanding of the chaos, and a communication method at a different level, which ignored the distance.
<br><br>
Because of the conflict between the Finale Way and the Purge Way, the Chaos Ancient Gods had been divided into two factions a long time ago.
<br><br>
They had argued with each other in the beginning, but had ended up fighting fiercely together.
<br><br>
At the time however, the end of the chaos had still been distant to them, so the fierce battle had not reached a point where people fought to death.
<br><br>
Herbert dragged Gerald to the bottom of the chaos. Herbert believed that everyone was equal and everyone should let things take their own course but Judson had turned up and forced him away. The fierce battle among the Chaos Ancient Gods had thus finally stopped.
<br><br>
It was now time they fought again.
<br><br>
Once Zen arrived in the Pear Hill along with the others, he settled his companions from the Oneness Sky Palace. Then, with Fuxi leading the way, he went to see his sister, Yan, whom he hadn't seen for a long time.
<br><br>
After they had parted last time, Zen had never seen his sister again, but had always protected her in some way or another.
<br><br>
When Yan was on the Other Shore, all the humans she had met had taken good care of her. Since Zen had gotten rid of all the enemies along the way on the Other Shore, there were almost no force that could act against them.
<br><br>
As a result, Yan was able to rapidly ascend to the upper stages on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Even before Elvinia had passed the test in the Soul City, Yan had already stepped into the Soul City.
<br><br>
In addition to the improvement in her cultivation, the biggest change in Yan was the way she used the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
Yan had been able to draw a portion of that energy in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
She had still been weak at the time. Being able to draw and transform the energy of the Evil God was already testing her limits.
<br><br>
But the Snake Goddess's personal training, coupled with her own unique talent, pushed her into becoming more and more proficient in the use of the Energy Shaft until she could transform more and more energy.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had always been prepared. Before Yan's Energy Shaft had completely matured, she could integrate different kinds of energy into one and transform it for her own use. The Snake Goddess thus changed the Cloud Cover Array and set up positions on each mountain and sect, so that Yan could absorb the energy through these positions.
<br><br>
Happy as she was to see her brother again, Yan told him about what she had gained during this period.
<br><br>
"This Energy Shaft is interesting. If it can freely transform space, time and energy, and have infinite power as we're expecting, then it will be really powerful," Fuxi said, shrugging.
<br><br>
It had been the Snake Goddess's idea to cultivate the Energy Shaft, and Fuxi hadn't thought highly of it. But what Yan had done had exceeded Fuxi's imagination.
<br><br>
"I don't think I can do it yet. The maximum amount of energy I can transform is seven hundred thousand divine megatons. I can't control the energy once it exceeds that amount," Yan said, shaking her head.
<br><br>
"Is it because your body can't bear a more powerful force?" Zen asked. .
<br><br>
"No." Yan frowned. "The power doesn't fall on me. It is the Energy Shaft that can't bear too much power. And I don't have a way of strengthening it!"
<br><br>
No one could tell what kind of substance the Energy Shaft in Yan's body was made of, making it impossible to strengthen it like the way she had done to the magic treasures.
<br><br>
If the strength of the Energy Shaft couldn't be increased, Yan's limit would probably be stuck where it now was.
<br><br>
A warrior who could control seven hundred thousand divine megatons of force could also be considered a powerful figure in the chaos. The ability had surpassed that of ordinary warriors at the Eternal Realm. The potential of the Energy Shaft was probably more than that.
<br><br>
Yan looked at her brother who had a faint smile on his face, and said, frowning, "Zen, why are you smiling?"
<br><br>
"It looks like there is a way to solve the Energy Shaft problem," Zen said, his smile broadening.
<br><br>
Yan blinked, as Fuxi stared at Zen, gobsmacked.
<br><br>
The information about the Energy Shaft had spread on the Other Shore for a while now. Now that Zen suddenly looked as if he was absolutely confident of solving the problem, they were naturally confused.
<br><br>
It was at this moment that a green figure appeared above Zen's head, and asked Yan, "Can you show me your Energy Shaft?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3899 Salome Yan's senses snapped alert at the appearance of the green figure transformed from the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had repeatedly advised her not to show the Energy Shaft to anyone.
<br><br>
Yan wouldn't agree even if Fuxi wanted to take a look.
<br><br>
This green figure had emerged from her brother's body, but she wouldn't show it the Energy Shaft without the Snake Goddess's consent.
<br><br>
"Are you confident enough to strengthen the Energy Shaft?"
<br><br>
the Snake Goddess asked as she walked into the hall.
<br><br>
The Energy Shaft was special, and she had tried every means to strengthen it.
<br><br>
She had tried to use the ice crystals from extremely cold places in the depths of the chaos, the precious meteorite from the Source World, and all kinds of other special materials. But none of them had any effect on the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
The Energy Shaft was an independent object, barely reacting to the outside world.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess didn't know who this green figure was. Why was it able to give Zen so much confidence about strengthening the Energy Shaft? Zen's theurgies were undoubtedly powerful, but even he couldn't strengthen the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
Even if he had absorbed the Civilization Artifacts, it would be impossible for him to do anything to the Energy Shaft, even with the help of the thirtynine human heroes in his mind.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess posed this question to the green figure in disbelief.
<br><br>
"Yes," the green figure replied. "If I'm not mistaken, you used the Quantity and Energy Method to refine the Energy Shaft. According to the energy reaction in her body, the Energy Shaft has now reached the fourth level.
<br><br>
And you want to improve it to the fifth or even the sixth level. Am I right?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyebrows shot up. "The Quantity and Energy Method is a method left behind by the Calculation Civilization. I'm not surprised that you know it. I know that there have been many civilizations interested in the Energy Shaft throughout the chaotic eras. But very few people are able enough to improve it to the fourth level, let alone the fifth and the sixth ones. I obviously want to, but I can't do it now."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess meant that since she couldn't do it, the green figure couldn't either.
<br><br>
"We only made a level three Energy Shaft at the time," the green figure said.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded. A level three Energy Shaft sounded good, but was, in fact, ordinary. Several civilizations in history had made it, but had only been able to control tens of thousands of divine megatons of force. It would be better to train an Eternal Realm master than to spend so much effort on it.
<br><br>
"But over the years on the Other Shore, we have made thorough calculations and have a new idea to strengthen the Energy Shaft," the green figure continued calmly.
<br><br>
"Just an idea?" The Snake Goddess glanced almost condescendingly at the green figure.
<br><br>
If Zen hadn't released this green figure, it would already have been driven away. Time was pressing and the Snake Goddess didn't want to listen to its nonsense.
<br><br>
"Yes, just an idea," the green figure said. "The defect of the Energy Shaft has existed since the Quantity and Energy Method was designed. We neglected one important thing when we designed the method: the position of the Energy Shaft."
<br><br>
"You designed the Quantity and Energy Method?" The Snake Goddess's eyebrows rose in shock. "Who are you?"
<br><br>
"It's a member of the Calculation Civilization," Zen said as way of introduction.
<br><br>
Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Yan were taken aback by this piece of information. It was obviously way beyond their expectations. They had never expected Zen to bring the creator of the Energy Shaft to them.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked embarrassed. She rolled her eyes at Zen's smiling face. "You brat! Why didn't you tell me this earlier?"
<br><br>
Zen chuckled but said nothing.
<br><br>
When she turned to face the green figure this time, her attitude had undergone a great change. She had become modest as she began to ask some key questions.
<br><br>
The Energy Shaft involved many complicated things. The green figure began to explain the relationship between space, time, and energy. Zen found it difficult to understand, but Yan's and the Snake Goddess's eyes lit up, because the green figure had just solved a lot of their problems.
<br><br>
Not knowing how long this talk would last, Zen retreated from the main hall and sat on one side, his legs crossed.
<br><br>
His eyes closed as an avatar materialized in the sky in his inner world, remaining there for a moment before entering the fairy palace.
<br><br>
The last time Zen came to the fairy palace, Margaret had been pregnant for five months.
<br><br>
Zen had been travelling on the Other Shore during this time, which was why he had no time to take care of her. He finally got the chance to visit her after he had left the Eternal Scroll Painting.
<br><br>
When he saw Margaret again, her slightly bulging belly had disappeared.
<br><br>
She was holding a lovely baby girl in her arms. The baby girl was sleeping, curling up like a kitten.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but blame himself. When Geoffrey was born, he had not been by Letitia's side. And he had been away again this time when his daughter was born.
<br><br>
Margaret didn't blame Zen, though. She knew that Zen must have met a tricky problem since he was unable to accompany her. With Letitia and Aura taking care of her after the childbirth, she felt at ease.
<br><br>
She told Zen that their daughter's name was Salome.
<br><br>
"We came up with this name together. You can change it if you don't like it," Margaret said softly.
<br><br>
Zen's face broke into a joyful grin as he held his daughter in his arms. He said, "It's a lovely name. There's no need to change it."
<br><br>
Zen's strange aura caused Salome to suddenly burst into tears. She began to struggle in Zen's arms.
<br><br>
Margaret picked up the scroll beside her and unfolded it in front of Salome.
<br><br>
At the sight of the scroll, Salome calmed down almost immediately and began to smile through her tears.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the scroll, confused. On it was just one Sanskrit word. He was stunned.
<br><br>
Knowing that Zen would be curious, Margaret explained, "Salome seems to be innately interested in Sanskrit words. Just like Geoffrey."
<br><br>
When Salome had started to cry and kept at it one day back in the past, Margaret hurried to visit Letitia with the baby in her arms. At the time, Letitia had been cultivating in seclusion to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way. When Salome saw the Sanskrit words, she immediately stopped crying and became quiet and curious.
<br><br>
From then on, Margaret had used Sanskrit words to coax and mollify her daughter and had been doing it for a few months.
<br><br>
When Geoffrey deciphered the Sanskrit words, he didn't try to form conjectures about them. He understood their meanings by instinct.
<br><br>
At her young age, Salome couldn't understand the meanings of the Sanskrit words, but the Sanskrit words she saw were different from those that ordinary people saw.
<br><br>
The Sanskrit words meant more in her eyes.
<br><br>
Zen was rendered speechless as he watched his daughter stare at the Sanskrit word with a smile on her face. It looked like she could also see the light dots of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
It couldn't be a coincidence that both Geoffrey and Salome were interested in the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
His children could easily travel through the Abstruse Energy World, but he couldn't. The more he thought about it, the more confused he became.
