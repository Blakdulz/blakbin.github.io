Chapter 3400 Rock Giants The intersecting stalagmites pressed heavily from all directions. The five Ear Mice squeaked as the passageway closed.
<br><br>
One of the Ear Mice took out its Other Shore Token, an iron house.
<br><br>
"Everyone, get in the house! Hurry up! Take cover!"
<br><br>
Such tokens of descending type were rare and unpopular on the Other Shore. This token could be used to imprison opponents. It could also be used as a defensive shield due to its durability.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, the other four Ear Mice sought refuge.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! The stalagmites extended rapidly until they were pushing at the surface of the iron house.
<br><br>
Clank! Clank! Clank! Under the great pressure, the iron house made a grating sound.
<br><br>
"The iron house can resist three thousand divine megatons of force. The stalagmites are heavy, but they are not enough to break it! Don't worry!" the first Ear Mouse said.
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"
<br><br>
The other four Ear Mice echoed.
<br><br>
In terms of cultivation methods and theurgies, the Ear Mice were weaker than the other super forces, but their Other Shore Tokens had always been the strongest.
<br><br>
But the relief didn't last long. After a few seconds, the foundations of the iron house couldn't bear the load any longer. It was crushed by the great force.
<br><br>
Bang! The five Ear Mice in the iron house were crushed into minced meat in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
The stalagmites in the cave continued to grow rapidly. Even though the group had passed through the narrow place, they still couldn't afford to stop running.
<br><br>
"Speed up! You can't resist these stalagmites," Zen reminded.
<br><br>
Zen had tried to prevent the growth of those stalagmites, but even he couldn't restrain the power contained within them.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! They all silently rushed onward.
<br><br>
The stalagmites grew faster and faster. From time to time, some even shot out from the flanks. Any carelessness would cause death.
<br><br>
Through this, the advantage of the Ear Mice was revealed.
<br><br>
They were small and flexible. Even if a stalagmite suddenly shot down from above, they could easily dodge it.
<br><br>
Sally had never experienced such danger. Her round eyes wide open, she kept flying up and down. Suddenly, a stalagmite shot down from above. It was as sharp as a sword, and it was indestructible.
<br><br>
Anyone hit by it would feel like they were being stabbed with thousands of divine megatons of force, except excruciatingly slower.
<br><br>
The stalagmite shot out toward Sally's head.
<br><br>
"Look out!"
<br><br>
Chaim, who was flying on the right, knocked Sally aside, pushing her a few feet away.
<br><br>
Just like Zen, Chaim paid attention to everyone while flying, but he cared about Sally the most.
<br><br>
Crack! The stalagmite missed Sally, but it pierced Chaim's right shoulder. He had tried to avoid it but failed. His muscles cut by the stalagmite, he bled profusely.
<br><br>
"Chaim, you..." Sally was shocked to see Chaim's large wound.
<br><br>
"Don't space out! Keep running!" Chaim shouted in a loud voice.
<br><br>
The stalagmites in the cave grew more and more quickly. There was no time to waste.
<br><br>
After tens of thousands of feet, the stalagmites finally stopped shooting out.
<br><br>
Everyone had passed through in peace.
<br><br>
Hutton and the others gasped for air.
<br><br>
Sally cleaned the wound on Chaim's shoulder.
<br><br>
Darth and the other Ear Mice looked back with lingering fear. The passageway they had come through was now crammed with stalagmites.
<br><br>
Zen looked back at the stalagmites and walked toward them.
<br><br>
"Zen, what are you doing?" Dorothy asked.
<br><br>
"I want to check them out. They are too strange," Zen replied.
<br><br>
No less than a million stalagmites had grown along the way. If each of them needed a Chaotic Source Spirit to support it, then there must be over a million Chaotic Source Spirits. But this was obviously impossible.
<br><br>
Zen approached the stalagmites. He lightly touched one of them, poking a hole right through it.
<br><br>
"Sure enough," Zen muttered.
<br><br>
"The stalagmites have become fragile," said Darth, agape.
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen nodded as he raised his head to look at the cave ceiling. "The Chaotic Source Spirits came all the way with us. They stayed in the stalagmites and used them to attack us."
<br><br>
"They must have kept moving ahead of us to merge with new stalagmites, abandoning the ones we've already passed," Darth remarked. "The Chaotic Source Spirits moved fast through these rocks!"
<br><br>
Zen didn't care about this. He narrowed his eyes. "So why have they given up now?"
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" Darth was puzzled by Zen's words.
<br><br>
Zen turned to look at the deep passage ahead. "If there is an end to the cave, the Chaotic Source Spirits just need to wait there to make sure we can't break through quickly. Then the other Chaotic Source Spirits can use the stalagmites to assassinate us. Since we can't use the Grand Teleportation, we would surely die."
<br><br>
After Zen finished his words, a chill went through his companions.
<br><br>
No one would be able to escape such a maneuver, if true.
<br><br>
"Master Zen, don't give them ideas! The Chaotic Source Spirits are intelligent and they can understand human language!" said Darth anxiously.
<br><br>
Zen smiled calmly. "Precisely because they are intelligent, they must have already thought of this. The only reason why they didn't push through it is they have other ways to deal with us, and they are confident that they can capture us."
<br><br>
With these words, Zen pointed forward.
<br><br>
Rocks in the distance started to move. They separated from the walls and turned into rock giants.
<br><br>
An ordinary rock giant wouldn't have been a threat. But those possessed by the Chaotic Source Spirits were indestructible.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! Dong! Huge rock giants emerged from all directions and charged toward the group.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Dorothy, Elvinia, Chaim, and the Ear Mice scrambled to take out their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
A flower spun above Dorothy and took her shape. This was the unique Twin Blossoms. The two Dorothies, hearts connected, both carried a sword. The power of Dorothy's Origin Swordsmanship would thus be twice as strong.
<br><br>
The Warrior of the Stone Hill floated in the air beside Elvinia, with a sword in one hand and a thousand swords in the other.
<br><br>
Chaim also deployed his Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Strong warriors like them were not afraid of fighting head-on. What they feared most were ambush attacks in the dark. But now that the Chaotic Source Spirits had decided to confront them face-to-face, they would definitely fight to the end.
<br><br>
Chapter 3401 Huge Eye Even though the ground shook as a rock giant rushed quickly towards Zen, he still remained composed and nonchalant.
<br><br>
The rock giant balled its huge fists and then smashed them towards Zen, but he disappeared in a flash from the spot! The next moment, he reappeared behind the rock giant.
<br><br>
With a crisp sound, he slashed his sword across the giant's body, but it failed to damage even the surface of the rock.
<br><br>
Still, Zen wasn't disappointed.
<br><br>
In fact, he was surprised — it just proved that there really was a Chaotic Source Spirit that hid inside the rock giant and strengthened its body.
<br><br>
Of course, he did not forget that their trip's main objective was to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits! "Clang!"
<br><br>
There was a deafening crash when the rock giant stretched its arms and fell on its back.
<br><br>
The way it moved wasn't particularly slow, but it still couldn't touch Zen at all.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen moved as swiftly as a light feather that glided in the wind, that even a small force could blow him away, but not damage him.
<br><br>
He ducked to avoid the rock giant's attack, then squinted his right eye which flashed a white beam of light.
<br><br>
"Authentic Visual World!"
<br><br>
As he employed the skill, the whole world became unusually clear in his vision. It didn't take him much effort to find several cracks on the surface of the rock giant.
<br><br>
"Sword Texture Technique! Break it!"
<br><br>
Next, he raised his sword and pointed it at the junction of two cracks found on the giant's waist.
<br><br>
The queen ant he had fought before had absorbed many Chaotic Source Spirits over a long period of time, so its body had only one flaw.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the rock giant had many flaws since it was only a temporary product.
<br><br>
The next events all went by in a blur.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen's sword touched the rock giant's weak spot, its body exploded into smithereens.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen didn't lower his guard even when the rock giant was now crushed into pieces.
<br><br>
That was because he suspected that the Chaotic Source Spirits must have been plotting something because they gathered in the main peak. Since they hadn't assassinated him with the stalagmites, he expected them to use more powerful means against him. The rock giants, however, were much weaker than he had imagined.
<br><br>
The thought quickly flashed in his mind — but no matter what the truth was, he believed that they must be able to obtain some Chaotic Source Spirits from the rock giants.
<br><br>
Just as the stone fragments collapsed on the ground, a small red creature emerged out of them. Compared to the ordinary Chaotic Source Spirits that Zen had seen before, this one was in a strange red color, and its big eyes were filled with ferocity instead of the loveliness the other Chaotic Source Spirits possessed.
<br><br>
"There's only one Chaotic Source Spirit?" he muttered. His eyes suddenly lit up in realization. Still, he stretched out his hand and an invisible force enveloped the little creature.
<br><br>
To his surprise, the little creature moved unimaginably fast. It directly plunged into the ground in an attempt to escape.
<br><br>
But, Zen wouldn't allow his prey to escape before him.
<br><br>
At that moment, the force he had just released turned into an invisible giant claw and grasped at the ground.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit was extremely exhausted. Even if it merged with the rocks again, it wouldn't be able to make them solid to resist Zen.
<br><br>
The rocks were as fragile as bean curd under the pressure of the invisible giant claw. With just a slight effort, the giant claw lifted them off the ground together with the Chaotic Source Spirit that hid inside them.
<br><br>
At that moment, the rocks suddenly exploded in the air.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit immediately escaped and went straight towards Zen! It came to an abrupt halt as its little red body swelled rapidly and shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't believe it. Trapped in a desperate situation, it decided to blow itself up! Fortunately, the blast wasn't enough to cause any damage to him. He just covered his face with his hand and easily blocked the suicide attack.
<br><br>
After the slight explosion, he heard a small clank by his feet.
<br><br>
It turned out to be an amber crystal that fell on the ground.
<br><br>
Zen picked it up as he glanced across the surrounding battlefield.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the rock giants weren't considered as formidable enemies. Elvinia, Dorothy, Hutton, Sally, Chaim, and the Ear Mice had each fought against a rock giant. Although their own battles didn't end as fast as Zen's, the Chaotic Source Spirits inside the rock giants they faced were quickly worn out. Eventually, the rock giants became very weak.
<br><br>
A loud thud resounded throughout the area as the Iridescent Stone had pierced one of the rock giants.
<br><br>
The red Chaotic Source Spirit inside the rocks was forced out of them. As Sally gently flicked her fingers, the Iridescent Stone went back and hit the Chaotic Source Spirit, thus reducing it into pieces. Only an amber crystal remained, which dropped to the ground.
<br><br>
"Perfect!" Sally exclaimed with a satisfied smile.
<br><br>
She kicked the debris and dirt off her feet and happily picked up the amber crystal from the ground.
<br><br>
Although it was only one Chaotic Source Spirit, it was a reward she had reaped with her own strength.
<br><br>
Following her victory, several more loud bangs echoed in the field.
<br><br>
The other rock giants were defeated one by one, and each of them had obtained a Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
Once they had cleared the battlefield and gathered together, Chaim looked as if something bothered him. "I don't see the point of those strange Chaotic Source Spirits," he said.
<br><br>
It was known that the Chaotic Source Spirits needed to merge with each other to become powerful.
<br><br>
For instance, one hundred Chaotic Source Spirits that had fused together was as powerful as one Chaotic Source Realm warrior.
<br><br>
Thus, a thousand or even ten thousand of them merged together would have an incomparable amount of strength.
<br><br>
Today, however, they oddly chose to fight alone — which was like a free gift for Zen and his group of warriors.
<br><br>
"There must be something wrong with them," Zen remarked. "I have a strange feeling that something has been staring at me in the darkness in this weird place," he added with a frown.
<br><br>
Darth unexpectedly nodded and said, "Yes. In fact, we noticed it as soon as we got here, but we had no way to confirm our assumption."
<br><br>
"Exactly!" the other Ear Mice chimed in as well. One aspect of the Ear Mice's abilities was far stronger than that of humans, and that was their keen perception.
<br><br>
If Zen had noticed the strangeness, then the Ear Mice had surely managed to do so as well.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, Zen and his companions weren't the only ones who had encountered such weird matters.
<br><br>
A cool, gentle breeze swept through another passageway. Yan's dress rustled elegantly against the floor as she pressed her fingers on her forehead.
<br><br>
She gazed at several rock giants in front of her and said in a low voice, "Break!"
<br><br>
The ground trembled and an audible crash was heard when the rock giants fell apart before her.
<br><br>
"Freeze!"
<br><br>
Yan opened her mouth once again, and an invisible power instantly restrained the Chaotic Source Spirits inside the rock giants.
<br><br>
When the little creatures were exposed, they just stared at her with hatred before they detonated themselves.
<br><br>
Several explosions later, all of them had turned into shreds.
<br><br>
There was a trace of pity and sadness in Yan's eyes as she looked at them, even though she didn't directly kill them.
<br><br>
She had already had a thorough understanding of these miserable creatures.
<br><br>
All warriors in the Other Shore Realm needed to capture the Chaotic Source Spirits in order to obtain greater power.
<br><br>
Although she could choose not to kill these creatures straight, they would still die at some point after the crystals had been taken out of their bodies. A moment of mercy wouldn't change the inevitable.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits had a life that entailed the constant tragedy of being nurtured and slaughtered. Perhaps no other creatures could have a more miserable fate than them.
<br><br>
That was why the sight of hostility in their eyes made Yan uncomfortable and guilty.
<br><br>
In any case, that same form of slaughter had been taking place in the other passages as well.
<br><br>
The warriors had all reaped their first harvest in the main peak, but a dozen Chaotic Source Spirits were far from enough for them.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a huge eye that resided in the main peak had been observing everything that had happened below it through the thick layers of rocks.
<br><br>
This huge eye was ten feet wide. Half of it flashed with a white light, and the other half with a red light. It obviously didn't belong to the Chaotic Source World, because it was an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Chapter 3402 The Eligible Targets It had been a while since the huge eye was silently observing the events below it, to embed every living creature in the main peak to its vision.
<br><br>
A huge ball rested under this eye, which was actually a big and powerful Chaotic Source Spirit. It measured more than a hundred feet in size, different from an ordinary one of its kind. This large ball was clearly the mother of all the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The voice of the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits broke the silence in the air. "Have you found the eligible targets?"
<br><br>
The huge eye flashed and sent out a part of its consciousness in response.
<br><br>
The eye had no organs to speak, so it could only send messages through its consciousness.
<br><br>
"I have many qualified targets in mind now," said the huge eye.
<br><br>
"Let me see!" the mother demanded. Red and white lights inside the huge eye descended in front of the mother and drew a graceful figure.
<br><br>
It was Yan, who wore a long dress.
<br><br>
The light figure showed that she was climbing up the cave, leading the members of the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
"This is a human girl who cultivates the Truth of Holy Words. She has the blood of the Snake Goddess," the huge eye explained.
<br><br>
The mother nodded, then started to count, "One."
<br><br>
Buzz… The red and white lights flashed again and revealed another figure.
<br><br>
This time, it was a white-haired young man. It was none other than Khalid from the Bearing race.
<br><br>
"A man of the Bearing race, who cultivates the Truth of Five Orientations, owns the Five-Orientation Body, and is one of the inheritors of the Yellow Thearch."
<br><br>
"Two," the mother said with a blank expression.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The lights flashed some more and showed the top masters of the minor races, and the huge eye had been targeting all of them.
<br><br>
"There are eleven in total. What about the targets for yourself?" asked the mother.
<br><br>
The eye smiled. "Me? Well... I am interested in this guy."
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The huge eye flashed and Zen's figure appeared, which was outlined by red and white lights.
<br><br>
"Is he also one of the human race? Why did you choose him?" the mother asked and looked at Zen in curiosity.
<br><br>
"This man is very interesting. He has merged with something of my kind,"
<br><br>
said the giant eye with its consciousness.
<br><br>
The mother was visibly shocked at this news, "You mean he has merged with an Eye of Will?"
<br><br>
"Yes. If I'm not mistaken, he must have assimilated an Eye of Will when he was in the Sacred Mallow Temple!" the huge eye answered affirmatively.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, however, was not interested in the giant eye's chosen target. Instead she asked, "Are you sure that we can escape safely after we possess their bodies? There are supreme masters who stay outside the Chaotic Source World. I can sense them," the mother said anxiously.
<br><br>
"Hmph, it's just Human Sovereign who's on guard outside. I'm afraid he can't keep us here if he is alone!" It seemed that there was a hint of contempt in the huge eye's words.
<br><br>
"That's good," the mother hissed. She turned to look at the phantoms of the eligible targets, and the hatred in her only grew even more. "We Chaotic Source Spirits have been kept in this place, while they slaughter and trample us at will. Now, it's time for them to pay the price and have a taste of this kind of life! You bastards want to absorb us? Let's see if you are qualified first!"
<br><br>
Normally, creatures of the Other Shore could not enter the Source World.
<br><br>
Yet, the Chaotic Source Spirit itself was quite special. After the Snake Goddess had discovered it, their pack had been nurtured carefully and grew to a great number.
<br><br>
Over the years, the Chaotic Source Spirits had helped nurture countless masters in the Source World.
<br><br>
Despite such a deed, life in the Source World was cruel for them.
<br><br>
Their true bodies were locked in the powerful Chaotic Source Sea on Stage Twenty-two. They couldn't even move in the slightest--but as a kind of Other Shore Token, they descended in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
If it hadn't been for the accident a few years ago, then Chaotic Source Spirits would have been enslaved and kept in captivity for more generations.
<br><br>
During that time, one powerful master had killed the guardian of the Chaotic Source Sea and freed all the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The mother was the core of the Chaotic Source Spirits. She wanted to bring all the Chaotic Source Spirits back to the Other Shore and stop them from being the Other Shore Tokens for good. She wanted to end their miserable lives.
<br><br>
However, the master who had saved them refused the mother's request and asked the Chaotic Source Spirits to maintain what they had been doing.
<br><br>
The mother was confused, until a huge eye--the Dreaded Eye Demon, appeared.
<br><br>
To descend in the Source World, creatures of the Other Shore required some warriors to support them, or in other words, they needed a complete inner world for support. Thus, the mother was very curious as to how the Dreaded Eye Demon had broken through the Other Shore's restrictions and arrived at where they were now.
<br><br>
In addition, the Dreaded Eye Demon brought a task for them when it came- -to devour the top talents in the Source World.
<br><br>
Needless to say, the Chaotic Source Spirits were very excited when they heard the news.
<br><br>
Those damned creatures had devoured them for so long, and finally there was a day that they could devour them back. It was what the Chaotic Source Spirits had been dreaming of doing, but they couldn't do so, until the huge eye had arrived.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits didn't have the ability to bite back, but the giant eye could. It turned out that the master who had freed them had already found the escape route in advance.
<br><br>
It was usually the mother's strategy to spread the plenty of Chaotic Source Spirits across the four peaks in the north, east, west, and south, in order to protect as many of them as possible.
<br><br>
As for those warriors who entered the main peak without permission, the mother would lead all the other Chaotic Source Spirits to fight back! This time, however, was different. Now, the mother took all the Chaotic Source Spirits back to the main peak so they could attract those talents to their location. The tests in the caves and passageways were nothing more than observation methods to select the best talents. At this point, the giant eye had already chosen the targets suitable for their consumption.
<br><br>
Below the huge eye's hideaway, creatures of various races had entered the main peak one after another. All of them encountered the same situations as Zen and the others had.
<br><br>
It was relatively late when the Evil God had entered the main peak.
<br><br>
It was known that the members of the Separate Abyss race were incomparable to those of the ordinary forces. Four members of their race had very special Other Shore Tokens. Those four relied on each other and formed a perfect circle. They were so strong that the strength they showed through the circle was enough to kill the masters at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
The Evil God fought against them and although he tried his best, he had only seriously injured one of them. In the end, he had to retreat.
<br><br>
It was the first time that the Evil God couldn't defeat warriors who were at the same level as him! Still, the Evil God didn't care about it at all. After all, he had already killed a large number of people in the Chaotic Source World and obtained so much. What he only had to do now was to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, there were rock giants that blocked Zen and his group's path along their journey.
<br><br>
The rock giants didn't hinder Zen and his companions, but the warriors didn't get many Chaotic Source Spirits from them, either.
<br><br>
They had soon climbed a distance of twenty thousand feet up the cave, but only got a little more than ninety Chaotic Source Spirits. It was not enough for any of them when the gain was to be shared.
<br><br>
Yet, Zen wasn't discouraged at all.
<br><br>
The remaining hundreds of thousands of Chaotic Source Spirits must be hiding somewhere on the main peak, waiting for them to harvest.
<br><br>
After they climbed more than thirty thousand feet, they were almost in the middle of the main peak.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits seemed to have hollowed out the center of the main peak, as there was a huge hole formed in the middle. As soon as they stepped into the huge cave, they all stopped walking.
<br><br>
There were all kinds of patterns that were engraved on the cave's walls, which made Zen and his companions feel as if they were in a huge palace.
<br><br>
"Look at them... What do the patterns stand for?" Sally looked around, her eyes blinking in curiosity. "I've seen these patterns before," said Chaim.
<br><br>
He continued, "When I was in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm..."
<br><br>
"They are the sculptures in the Sacred Mallow Temple." Dorothy glanced at Zen and nodded, "Me and Zen explored that temple together. I'm sure of it!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3403 Sculptures As Zen paced around the cave, he walked towards a corner and observed the sculptures on the walls.
<br><br>
The sculptures varied in forms, figures, and creatures. From cattle, to snakes, to birds. The sculptures were unique in their own ways.
<br><br>
Sadly, none of the sculptures was the Dreaded Eye Demon. Zen knew what he was looking for, especially since the Dreaded Eye Demon was hard to miss as it was only an eyeball. Zen had prior knowledge to them when he integrated with the Eye of Will.
<br><br>
"These sculptures are exactly the same as those in the Sacred Mallow Temple," Zen pointed out, nodding his head in approval.
<br><br>
The members and disciples of powerful forces never settled at the Stage One for long. As for Zen, he only entered the temple because some humans had invited him.
<br><br>
Chaim was also an exception to this. He had just entered the Other Shore, and grew curious about the place. Once, he entered the Sacred Mallow Temple, too.
<br><br>
"But why are all these sculptures here?" Dorothy asked, curious to know more.
<br><br>
She had been through a lot in the past. The first time she entered the Sacred Mallow Temple, she had struggled and was nearly killed inside.
<br><br>
"The risky thing in the Sacred Mallow Temple was the Soul Purifying Light, which could kill all the Souls of Light," Zen comforted her. "Good thing we don't have that here." He paused and looked back at Dorothy.
<br><br>
"What I don't understand is how the Chaotic Source Spirits have something to do with the Dreaded Eye Demons..."
<br><br>
This bothered Zen, especially because these were two completely different races.
<br><br>
Because he didn't have enough information, he couldn't understand. More so for the others, who had no clue about anything.
<br><br>
The group had made it to the end of the cave. Though there were eight other pathways around the cave, they only motioned downwards. It meant that these passages were probably connected to the other eight entrances at the bottom of the main peak.
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source Spirits must be hiding up here." Elvinia nudged above.
<br><br>
"I'm sure that we'll find our way out if we break the cave ceiling."
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits had the ability to cut the rocks and moved in and out as they pleased. If it wasn't difficult for spirits, it should be possible for the group to do the same.
<br><br>
As Zen, Chaim and the others thought of more plans, another group of people came through another passage.
<br><br>
They were from the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
When they met eyes with Zen and his companions, their eyes widened in surprise. The silver haired young man in the lead, Khalid, was carrying a long spear on his shoulder. He squinted in arrogance.
<br><br>
"Interesting," muttered Khalid. "It saddened me that I didn't come cross you guys earlier. I didn't expect to see you here at all." Khalid smiled, but his kindness remained questionable. Just then, he lightly tapped on the spear, and it suddenly shook while a wisp of white light wrapped itself around the weapon.
<br><br>
Just as Khalid was about to make a move, another group of people appeared from another passage. They were from the New Moon race and the Divine Farmer race, and they didn't seem to be pleased either.
<br><br>
The man called "Mount" from the Divine Farmer race, stood at the forefront of the group. On his shoulder was a little girl named Mya, who had long, curly hair and a snarky expression.
<br><br>
When the two saw Zen and Elvinia, they smiled at each other in eagerness.
<br><br>
"Uncle Mount, are you going to fight with them right now? What a coincidence! The two people on the first row, right here, at the same time..."
<br><br>
Mya said this in hushed tones, keeping her expression hidden behind her curly locks of hair.
<br><br>
Mount narrowed his eyes and gave Zen and Elvinia a good look.
<br><br>
Aside from fusing with Chaotic Source Spirits, he planned to get rid of these two as well.
<br><br>
If they had obtained enough Chaotic Source Spirits, they would have already attacked Zen.
<br><br>
However, they were on the lookout for the Chaotic Source Spirits that had disappeared. They couldn't afford a delay. Also, hosting a battle in a cave was not the best course of action right now.
<br><br>
Mount was a steady and prudent person. He wouldn't challenge someone without full preparation.
<br><br>
"Let's wait a while," Mount decided. "Our main goal is still to retrieve the Chaotic Source Spirits. We can't go back empty-handed. They can live a little longer," he chuckled, drawing away from Zen and the rest.. He looked around, scanning the cave, when the strange sculptures caught his sight.
<br><br>
Khalid suddenly spoke up. "The Chaotic Source Spirits are surely important, but killing the good-for-nothings from the Oneness Sky Palace is proper business. If you don't want to take action against them, I'll take matters into my own hands." He was not as scrupulous nor as patient as Mount. Eagerness flashed in his eyes as his spear vibrated on his shoulder.
<br><br>
Hearing this, Elvinia, Dorothy, Chaim, and the rest of their group were distraught.
<br><br>
They knew they were outnumbered and their opponents were strong, so they were at a disadvantage.
<br><br>
Zen, being the leader of the group, took a step forward and calmly said, "In my opinion, generally speaking, most people who describe others as goodfor-nothings are just cowards. If you want to prove yourself so bad, you can do better than just spitting nonsense!" He let out a laugh.
<br><br>
Khalid, on the other hand, was not impressed with Zen at all. To Khalid, Mount, Mya, the only person they should be cautious with was the young man in black. Zen and Elvinia were nothing but prey to them.
<br><br>
In any case, they already ruled out the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace because they seemed too weak. They thought they would just endure all kinds of sarcasms without talking back! However, they were surprised to see Zen speak up so confidently. Khalid chuckled and said, "I'm really surprised. After so many years, the Oneness Sky Palace finally has a member with balls." He gestured towards Zen.
<br><br>
"Since it seems like you're eager to die, don't mind me being rude."
<br><br>
After he said that, he gently pulled out the white, magnificent spear from his shoulder. As the tip of the weapon swept the ground, the rocks beneath it were sliced right at the middle. This spear's sharpness was no laughing matter.
<br><br>
"You? Rude?" Zen raised his eyebrows, questioning this arrogant man before him. As he said so, the tip of the Snow Sword slowly stretched out from his space ring. He took hold of it and pointed it towards the members of the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race. Pleased with their reactions, he said, "This has nothing to do with manners." He looked at everyone in the eye, and then gave a wink at Khalid. "It's just, well, none of you can leave here alive."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, the diamond-shaped Civilization Artifact in his inner world began to move.
<br><br>
Once it was completely unraveled, it resembled a spiky ball.
<br><br>
To add, the unique aura of Regal Jade Civilization gave out in full bloom, which added to the artifact's extraordinary impression.
<br><br>
"You arrogant bastard!"
<br><br>
"You just want to die!"
<br><br>
"We won't hesitate to kill you!"
<br><br>
The members of all four races, the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race included, roared in anger.
<br><br>
In an instant, Khalid, Mount, Mya were smiling no longer.
<br><br>
They realized that they had just underestimated Zen.
<br><br>
After all, the young man in black who they had feared the most, was a creation of Zen's inner world.
<br><br>
But these people weren't going to back down now. They had been through hell and back, so they had no reason to retreat now.
<br><br>
Besides, they still outnumbered Zen and his companions by a large number, so they still stood with great leverage.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
The tension in the atmosphere thickened as a battle was just around the corner.
<br><br>
But just as everyone took their battle stances, footsteps echoed throughout the cave.
<br><br>
One more group came through another passage.
<br><br>
"Brother!"
<br><br>
The group that emerged was the Snake Goddess race, led by Yan.
<br><br>
They would have been the first to enter, but Yan spent too much time catching Chaotic Source Spirits, making them the last to arrive.
<br><br>
Seeing that Zen was safe and unharmed, Yan was more than delighted. She was relieved as she strode forward to give him a hug.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had the most members, so they had the advantage of calling the shots. Though they were hit by the hurricane, they could easily gather quickly and continue moving.
<br><br>
Members of the Snake Goddess race and the Oneness Sky Palace gathered together, impressively outnumbering the Bearing race and the other three races altogether.
<br><br>
Chapter 3404 Unexpected Attack Acting on instinct, six women of the Snake Goddess race stationed themselves before Yan. They had their eyes fixated on the people of the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
The scales on the bodies of these women flickered with a pinch of dark gold light. Their radiant faces reflected hints of vigilance as if they were on guard against them.
<br><br>
Their formation was not just a coincidence, but was intentional. Their positions formed the Six Snake Shadows Array of the Pear Hill. They were exactly the Six Snake Shadows.
<br><br>
The Six Snake Shadows had made a name for themselves in the Source World. The Pear Hill would handpick only the most exceptional talents from each generation of the Snake Goddess race and recruit them. They would then offer them rigorous training to become a part of the Six Snake Shadows.
<br><br>
Accompanying Yan, the Six Snake Shadows were given two missions to carry out in the Chaotic Source World: they were to reach the Chaotic Source Realm, and they had to protect Yan at all costs. Even though Yan's strength was on par with the geniuses from other super forces, they still didn't want to take any chances. For Pear Hill, Yan was an invaluable treasure.
<br><br>
Yan turned back. Her face was robbed of all emotions, as she glared at those of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race with piercing eyes.
<br><br>
"How dare you!" She asked Khalid.
<br><br>
"Who are you to stop us? If it bothers you so much, why don't you join him too?" Khalid retorted while furrowing his brows.
<br><br>
The sudden appearance of the warriors from Pear Hill forced the people of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race to stay on guard. Even with their empowering presence, it wasn't enough to make them retreat.
<br><br>
However, the situation would now become extremely troublesome.
<br><br>
Mount watched all this unravel from a distance and frowned.
<br><br>
Normally he would not back away from a fight against the people from Pear Hill or the Oneness Sky Palace, but the situation demanded otherwise.
<br><br>
Mount didn't agree with the timing and place of this issue. Moreover, he had a hunch that something was wrong with this place.
<br><br>
The sculptures inside the cave gave off an eerie vibe. Furthermore, the location of the Chaotic Source Spirits was still unknown. Even if they somehow defeated the enemy in time, there would always be a chance of someone taking advantage of their preoccupation and stealing the Chaotic Source Spirits for themselves.
<br><br>
Yan kept her unfaltering gaze at Khalid. Her lusciously long black hair fluttered in the air as a trace of red light enveloped her, responding to her rage. "This place isn't ideal for a fight. But, if you're asking for it, we won't hold back."
<br><br>
As if to solidify her statement, the bodies of the Six Snake Shadows began to glow with cyan color. The Other Shore Power inside other people from the Snake Goddess race began to surge as they activated it.
<br><br>
Khalid never expected such a little girl to hold that much authority over the others. Of course, he didn't want to act on impulse and run into a battle blindly without considering the aftereffects.
<br><br>
During the intense exchange of provoking statements, Mount walked over to Khalid and placed his hands on his shoulder.
<br><br>
"Our primary goal right now is to find those Chaotic Source Spirits. This isn't the time to wage unnecessary battles."
<br><br>
Khalid was a powerful warrior thus pride came as second nature to him. He wouldn't just sit around and gulp down the bitter juice of defeat, especially not at the hands of these women of Pear Hill. If Yan continued with her threats, he would probably be provoked into fighting them head-on.
<br><br>
Mount was familiar with Khalid's temperament. Fearing Khalid would act impulsively, he walked over to him to calm his nerves down.
<br><br>
Khalid clenched his fists as he glared at Zen and Yan before he turned to leave.
<br><br>
But, just as he turned back, his long spear suddenly moved. At the same time, a skull emerged out of nowhere in his hand. He clasped the white spear in his hand and charged in Zen and Yan's direction with determined eyes.
<br><br>
"Devil Soul-sucking Spear!"
<br><br>
As he chanted the words, a light with a mixture of black and gray shot out from the tip of the spear.
<br><br>
Khalid's surprise attack shocked both the people of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill. The energy surging from his move was unbelievably strong.
<br><br>
The light seemed to hold a mysterious kind of power. Even the people of the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race were taken aback by it. Mount had mixed expressions on his face. He was annoyed that Khalid had shunned his advice, but he was also surprised at how fast he moved.
<br><br>
Khalid's attack seemed simple, but he had been planning for this moment for a long time.
<br><br>
Yan and Zen were the two most important figures of the Pear Hill and the Oneness Sky Palace, respectively. If they were killed, the others wouldn't pose as much of a challenge.
<br><br>
His Devil Soul-sucking Spear was formidable. It could one-shot any opponent.
<br><br>
The light passed by like a flash. It bypassed many people, including the Six Snake Shadows and went towards its two targets, Yan and Zen.
<br><br>
Before the Six Snake Shadows even had the time to react, it had already reached Yan.
<br><br>
Yan was strong, but she didn't expect this to happen at all. She had pinned Khalid to be a coward who could only throw empty threats and do nothing more.
<br><br>
Just as he sensed the unique energy emanating from the light, Zen became serious.
<br><br>
Fortunately, his Civilization Artifact was activated. As soon as he focused hard, an emerald-like feather emerged and floated in the space above him.
<br><br>
Remaining quick on his feet, he grabbed Yan, turned around and ran with her to avoid the light.
<br><br>
With a whoosh, the light brushed past Zen, making slight contact with his clothes.
<br><br>
As a result, the fiber of the clothes on his back began to rot. The skin directly beneath the fabric turned a charred-black color.
<br><br>
Even though the light shot from the spear was free of poison, the spear itself was a manifestation of pure evil. The light contained a strong power capable of corrosion.
<br><br>
Luckily, Zen's body was resilient against such energy. If he were an ordinary human being, he would not have survived! "Go to hell! I'll make you regret this when I'm through with you!"
<br><br>
Zen was fuming with rage. They had stepped over his last nerve that kept him sane.
<br><br>
He had been wanting to teach the people from the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the New Moon race and the Sun Crow race a lesson.
<br><br>
But he shared the same thoughts as Mount. This was not the right place for a fight. However, he had planned to pay them back for the past with interest once they were outside.
<br><br>
But now, the circumstances had changed. Khalid had declared war when he first aimed at Yan. Yan's safety was Zen's biggest concern. If anyone threatened it, Zen would make sure they didn't live to make the same mistake twice.
<br><br>
"Swoosh!"
<br><br>
All of a sudden, Zen dashed towards Khalid with agility. It was hard to keep track of his movements. It was as if he was a ghost.
<br><br>
Seeing his assault had failed, Khalid realized he misjudged the limits of Zen's capabilities.
<br><br>
The skill Zen had used to dodge his strike was beyond his comprehension.
<br><br>
From his perspective, there was no one in the same level of the Other Shore Realm in the Source World who could have survived that attack.
<br><br>
He had been so sure that he wouldn't miss his target.
<br><br>
However, with a single twist of his body, Zen had made a mockery out of it.
<br><br>
Before he could retrieve his spear to defend himself, Zen had already approached him.
<br><br>
Judging by the situation Khalid was in, it wouldn't be wise to retreat. He decided to take the risk and remain where he stood. The skull in his right hand began to rattle in response to his ordeal. At the same time, a solid beam of brown light swirled around the tip of the spear.
<br><br>
He was planning to retaliate with a more powerful strike than before! Watching Zen close the distance between himself and them, Mount and Mya took caution to the situation and became serious.
<br><br>
They blamed Khalid in their hearts for provoking an avoidable scenario because of his impulse. Even so, they had to do something to stop Zen.
<br><br>
If Khalid were to die, the Bearing race would suffer an incalculable loss.
<br><br>
They couldn't just stand by and let this happen.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
Mount's body underwent violent tremors, and then a layer of gold light surged out of his tanned skin. The outburst of energy from his body resembled that of a sturdy mountain.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Mya ascended to the sky and stationed herself behind Mount. A loud cracking sound of bones resounded in the air around her as her right hand broke itself.
<br><br>
From the joint of her elbow, a small puppet emerged as it floated above it. It was her Other Shore Token. The puppet appeared to have been connected to her body with her forearm. Its appearance was nothing short of creepy.
<br><br>
Zen showed no signs of hesitation even though he knew he would have to take on all three of them at once. He was determined to tear Khalid into pieces no matter the circumstances.
<br><br>
Before the both sides could confront each other, the eyes of the sculptures in the cave suddenly opened.
<br><br>
Chapter 3405 The Purpose The moment those huge eyes opened, everyone in the cave felt as if their hearts were clenched in an icy grip. They quavered in fear.
<br><br>
Some of them could feel a sharp sword pointed at their foreheads. If the sword were to be thrust one inch closer, it would pierce their skulls and they would die.
<br><br>
Some of the people in the cave could see they were surrounded by skeletons. This was frightening. Had they arrived in the death world, where no living being existed? Were they doomed to become like the skeletons? Most of them covered their heads with their hands, horrified. Naturally, they thought they were going to die.
<br><br>
Although most of them had been through many dangers, now, they were terror-stricken. Each of them felt like they were at death's door, knocking loudly.
<br><br>
Even Zen and Khalid, possessing the powerful Souls of Light, were not immune to this fear. Zen had to retreat after he landed, and at the same time fight against the fear of the Dreaded Eye Demon with his strong will.
<br><br>
Zen had gone through something like this before in the Sacred Mallow Temple. At that time, after No. 9527 prompted him, he was able to shut it out using the Emotion Closing Godly Way.
<br><br>
However, the fear which descended on him now was many times stronger than what he encountered in the Sacred Mallow Temple. The Emotion Closing Godly Way was unable to banish the fright.
<br><br>
"Flow Strike!"
<br><br>
Desperate for a solution, Zen pulled out another one of his skills—the Flow Swordsmanship.
<br><br>
The Flow Strike was regarded as an extension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way, with a meditation component. It was a more effective way of cultivating the heart.
<br><br>
While staying in the Flow Sword Sect, Zen had come a long way as far as his training went.
<br><br>
But the mind method of the Flow Swordsmanship had little effect on that fear. He was unable to completely erase it.
<br><br>
The others were even worse.
<br><br>
Most of them prostrated themselves on the ground. Some of them were looking ashen, some were trembling and the rest were crying bitterly.
<br><br>
Yan stood still with a confused look, as if she were also using some kind of mental method to filter out the fear.
<br><br>
At the top of the main peak, the dark and red lights continued to flicker on the surface of the giant eye.
<br><br>
The giant eye was the source of the fear, naturally emanating it and affecting everyone.
<br><br>
Both Zen and Khalid were targets chosen by the eye and the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. It did not want anything to go wrong in the fight between those two.
<br><br>
However, Khalid reacted recklessly. When the battle began, the giant eye had to interfere.
<br><br>
"What if they find out about your meddling?" asked the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
She was afraid they would escape, and leave the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
After all, no one was willing to let their prey run away like that.
<br><br>
"There shouldn't be a problem," the giant eye replied. "They haven't acquired enough Chaotic Source Spirits, so they won't put a halt to the competition and take off."
<br><br>
The giant eye wasn't willing to reveal its ability now, but it had no choice.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The light in its pupil lasted for 30 seconds before it disappeared and the eye went back to its former condition.
<br><br>
The red and white lights slowly revolved around its pupil.
<br><br>
In the middle of the main peak, many members and disciples from different races, who thought they were on the verge of death, found that the fear had suddenly dissipated, and they stood up with strange expressions.
<br><br>
"What was that?"
<br><br>
"It scared me!"
<br><br>
"I thought I was going to die!"
<br><br>
The fear made people feel like they were taking a walking tour of hell, and they glistened with sweat.
<br><br>
"Uncle Mount, that power of fear is from the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.
<br><br>
But what kind of thing is it? Why could it affect so many people?" Mya asked in confusion.
<br><br>
Mya knew the Truth of Goodwill and Malice very well, as she cultivated it.
<br><br>
After reaching the consummate level of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, she could also frighten a large number of creatures. If one had a weak soul, they would be frightened to death.
<br><br>
However, for the Souls of Light that had reached the Other Shore, that effect was simply negligible. Ordinary warriors were immune, unless she was able to fuse with a related Other Shore Token, or to cultivate the theurgy of this aspect.
<br><br>
Mount was powerful and smart. As far as Mya was concerned, there was nothing that Mount didn't know.
<br><br>
"That's the Dreaded Eye Demon. It was a mighty ruling force in the past, but the force didn't fare well on the Other Shore and the Dreaded Eye Demons are almost extinct," Mount replied flatly.
<br><br>
"So why is it here?" Mya asked.
<br><br>
In Mya's eyes, both the items and living creatures on the Other Shore should use a medium to descend in the Source World.
<br><br>
The medium was the inner world of a powerful Other Shore Realm warrior.
<br><br>
"I don't know," Mount answered with a frown.
<br><br>
In fact, the Chaotic Source Spirits had already broken with routine and lived in the Chaotic Source World in a special form.
<br><br>
Essentially, the Chaotic Source Spirits were also the creatures of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Why were the Chaotic Source Spirits different from other creatures on the Other Shore? Every super force had looked into that, but the reason had not been found.
<br><br>
It could be said that it was completely against the truth when the Chaotic Source Spirits lived in a special form like that.
<br><br>
Once they found out why, the strong existences hiding on the Other Shore and the powerful masters of the ruling civilizations would probably be able to return to the Source World, and even the chaos.
<br><br>
After Zen regained consciousness, he just stared at Khalid coldly.
<br><br>
He thought of killing Khalid, but then the fear rose in him. This was not a coincidence.
<br><br>
Knowing this, Zen ventured a guess.
<br><br>
What had just happened was obvious to him now. A Dreaded Eye Demon must be hovering on top of the main peak. That monster was much stronger than the Eye of Will Zen had fused with! "Why did it stop me from killing Khalid? Or did it just stop me from fighting him?"
<br><br>
Zen thought it must be the latter. But why? It was the first time that Khalid had entered the Chaotic Source World. He didn't seem to know anything about that either.
<br><br>
Why would the Dreaded Eye Demon do that? Zen was consumed with figuring this out, and hesitated to act before he did.
<br><br>
He and Yan led the members of the Pear Hill and the Oneness Sky Palace to retreat to the other side, distancing themselves from the members of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
At this time, in another passageway, dozens of tall figures entered. They were from the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
The members of this race gathered and formed three teams in the Chaotic Source World. One of the teams encountered the Evil God, while the other two teams banded together and climbed up the main peak.
<br><br>
This time, the trip to the Chaotic Source World was not easy for them, and they were much more cautious as a result. Many Separate Abyss warriors, over a hundred feet tall, looked at the sculptures on the walls and gathered off to one side.
<br><br>
More and more members of different races came into the cave through the passageways around it.
<br><br>
Most were in groups, but there were some warriors who came there alone.
<br><br>
For example, Milo from the Oneness Sky Palace explored the main peak all by himself. He remained in the Chaotic Source World for a long time, and now he finally threw in his lot with Zen and his companions.
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source Spirits must be hiding in the upper part of the cave!"
<br><br>
"Let's just make our way up and dig them out!"
<br><br>
"Yes, there is no place to hide except the upper part of the main peak!"
<br><br>
When there were more warriors in the cave, it became quite noisy inside.
<br><br>
They talked about the best way to climb the mountain.
<br><br>
As for the members of the Separate Abyss race, they were impetuous. Two of them flew up and shot toward the upper part of the cave with their huge bodies as large as the hills.
<br><br>
However, when the two Separate Abyss warriors just approached the top, they suddenly let out a scream, and fell down, holding their heads in their hands. They formed a huge crater when they smashed into the ground.
<br><br>
Chapter 3406 One Last Chance Everyone directed their gazes to the upper part of the cave. Two eyes-- the Dreaded Eye Demons flickered with red light.
<br><br>
They lingered for a long while before disappearing.
<br><br>
"What's going on?"
<br><br>
"Is that the Malicious Stare?"
<br><br>
"How could it be so powerful?"
<br><br>
The other races that entered the cave later hadn't experienced the soulcrushing fear. When they saw what happened to the two members of the Separate Abyss race, they were all shocked.
<br><br>
"Those are sculptures of the Dreaded Eye Demons!"
<br><br>
"The Malicious Stare is way too powerful. Is there a strong Dreaded Eye Demon in the main peak?"
<br><br>
"Then how can we climb the mountain?"
<br><br>
These people were experienced and knowledgeable. They not only recognized the sculptures on the walls, but also guessed that the main peak was guarded by a Dreaded Eye Demon.
<br><br>
At a loss for what to do, everyone turned to the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
Although the Icy Snow Province was open to the public, it was still under the control of the Pear Hill. The other super forces might not know what had happened in the Chaotic Source World, but the people of the Pear Hill must know something.
<br><br>
"What happened in the Chaotic Source World?"
<br><br>
"You should have let us know!"
<br><br>
"Please tell us!"
<br><br>
"If you keep silent, don't blame us for being rude!"
<br><br>
They had been in the Chaotic Source World for such a long time and explored the periphery and the four peaks, but couldn't find many Chaotic Source Spirits. Naturally, they were angry.
<br><br>
Questioned by so many members of the myriad races, the people of the Pear Hill were under a lot of pressure.
<br><br>
No matter how strong they were, they couldn't afford to anger that many people.
<br><br>
At this time, Yan walked out at a casual pace and swept her gaze across the faces of those assembling there. "The Chaotic Source Sea and the Chaotic Source Spirits are already out of control," she said.
<br><br>
Hearing Yan's words, many of the other races had surprise written all over their faces.
<br><br>
Some didn't understand what Yan was talking about, while some let thoughts flash across their minds.
<br><br>
"What do you mean?" someone asked.
<br><br>
"This is the last time the Chaotic Source World opens and the only chance for us to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. If we miss it, we won't get a second chance," Yan replied faintly.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"How could that happen?"
<br><br>
"Impossible! The Chaotic Source World has existed for eons. How could this be our last chance?"
<br><br>
The members of the other races were all shocked.
<br><br>
To them, it didn't matter if they couldn't merge with the Chaotic Source Spirits this time. The tickets to the Chaotic Source World were precious to ordinary people, but to these elites of the major races, they were nothing.
<br><br>
If they failed this time, they'd try again. Where there was life, there was hope. In any case, life came first.
<br><br>
Zen's face was also filled with surprise. He asked Yan, "The Chaotic Source Spirits constantly reproduce, don't they?"
<br><br>
Yan blinked her eyes and nodded. "Yes, but since they're from the Other Shore, their bodies are left there."
<br><br>
In the past, the Chaotic Source Spirits were strictly controlled on the Other Shore, and the place where they were controlled was the Chaotic Source Sea.
<br><br>
Even if all the two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits were killed, the Chaotic Source World would be prosperous again, as long as the strong warriors went to the Chaotic Source Sea and chose several other Chaotic Source Spirits as parents.
<br><br>
But now, after the Chaotic Source Sea on the Other Shore had been occupied, there were no more parents.
<br><br>
Once a Chaotic Source Spirit was merged, there was one less existing in the Source World.
<br><br>
After hearing Yan's words, many of the races were excited. They had one last chance to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
"What happened in the main peak? Why are there sculptures of the Dreaded Eye Demons here?" asked a member of the Celestial Wolf race.
<br><br>
Yan shook her head and said, "I don't know either. Put simply, if you want to reach the Chaotic Source Realm, you have to go all-out."
<br><br>
Mount, Mya and the talented disciples of the various races wouldn't miss this chance. If they did miss that chance, it would be worse than death. That meant they'd never reach the Chaotic Source Realm, no matter how long they lived.
<br><br>
Yan's words sobered them up, and spurred a veritable brainstorm. They came up with many ideas.
<br><br>
Originally, everyone was on edge, each race not trusting the others. But now, they were in a better mood. They were focused on a common goal.
<br><br>
At this time, another figure appeared at an entrance of the cave.
<br><br>
As soon as it appeared, an invisible malicious aura spread out like a giant beast baring its teeth and claws.
<br><br>
Everyone looked over and found the young man in black standing at the cave entrance. Their faces sank.
<br><br>
"Evil God! How dare you show up here?"
<br><br>
A man in golden armor from the Separate Abyss race took two steps forward, one golden hammer in each hand, and his face was full of anger.
<br><br>
His clansmen also stepped forward and formed a half moon shape, presenting a united front against the Evil God.
<br><br>
They had never suffered such an egregious loss before.
<br><br>
Nearly a third of their clansmen were slain by a young man. This was an affront that demanded blood for blood.
<br><br>
When the other races saw the Evil God, they also looked at him with hatred in their eyes.
<br><br>
After the Evil God entered the Chaotic Source World, he had already provoked many races by killing their clansmen for no reason.
<br><br>
He did the same on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Even the super forces like the Bearing race and the Separate Abyss race could not escape his hatred.
<br><br>
Someone had said that he would tear the Evil God limb from limb if he found him in the Source World, but the Evil God's power was undiminished in the Source World.
<br><br>
Now that the Evil God was outnumbered, the people assembling in the cave were not afraid of him.
<br><br>
They were all elites of the major races. They didn't believe that the Evil God could resist all of them alone.
<br><br>
There was an indifferent smile on the Evil God's face. The Ways-blending Energy gathered slowly in his right hand and coalesced into a diamondshaped gem, which glinted evilly. Even facing so many strong warriors, he remained calm.
<br><br>
Some of the creatures looking at him were very nervous. What was he playing at? Seeing the restless members of the Separate Abyss race about to rush forward, Khalid of the Bearing race reminded them, "Hamzah! If we fight here, we will risk activating the Malicious Stare!"
<br><br>
Hamzah was one of the strongest of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
Although he didn't want to fight the Evil God, the Separate Abyss race had been humiliated. So he had to fight.
<br><br>
"Really?" Hearing Khalid's words, Hamzah frowned.
<br><br>
"We've already been through this." Khalid cupped his hands and told Hamzah what happened just now.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race were arrogant. They didn't hang out with the Bearing race.
<br><br>
However, Khalid still hoped they could form an alliance with the Separate Abyss race. He warned them kindly because he wanted them on his side.
<br><br>
After thinking it over, Hamzah stared ferociously at the Evil God and led his clansmen to the side.
<br><br>
Everyone could see a fight between the Separate Abyss race and the Evil God was brewing.
<br><br>
Chapter 3407 Shut Up The Evil God emerged from the passageway, greeting Zen with a smug smile.
<br><br>
Zen faced this creation of his with a look of indifference.
<br><br>
The Evil God was a creature born from his inner world so it was only a given that Zen knew everything about him.
<br><br>
From his birth to his growth, Zen knew every single detail.
<br><br>
All the information would gather together in his mind with only a single thought.
<br><br>
"You've made a big mistake," Zen hissed.
<br><br>
His creation merely continued smiling at him. "What is it?"
<br><br>
"You should've never used Dorothy to provoke me!" Zen snarled with white-hot rage.
<br><br>
Dorothy couldn't help but purse her lips.
<br><br>
She had fought with this creation of Zen's before and knew very well how terrifying he was.
<br><br>
The Evil God had chosen to spare her life at the last moment and Dorothy caught on pretty quickly as to why: he wanted to use her to provoke Zen.
<br><br>
She trusted Zen's strength wholeheartedly, but she didn't want him to get into this potentially dangerous fight just because of her. Moreover, the current situation was skewed to the Evil God's favor.
<br><br>
If Zen was defeated by the Evil God, he would only end in death.
<br><br>
It was nice to be saved by Zen but she wasn't as relieved as she should be.
<br><br>
In fact, she was very worried.
<br><br>
Zen was wholly determined to fight for her and would not back down from this fight with the Evil God.
<br><br>
It warmed her heart but it was quickly overtaken with worry for Zen's life.
<br><br>
"Tsk, tsk, tsk..." The Evil God shook his head with a smile. "You seem really eager to destroy me."
<br><br>
"You never should've existed in the first place," Zen countered.
<br><br>
This creation of his was a freak and Zen was still at a loss as to how such a vile creature appeared in his inner world. Other people didn't seem to have this problem. Why him? Did it have anything to do with the primitive land? The Evil God let out a maniacal laugh. "My existence wasn't decided by you. Not even this round of chaos can decide my birth. I am destined to transcend everything while you..."
<br><br>
He paused to glare at Zen with his two evil eyes. "You are merely destined to be my stepping stone."
<br><br>
His daring insults caused the various races to frown.
<br><br>
There was truly no limit to the Evil God's arrogance.
<br><br>
Destined to transcend everything? Even if he came from the Black Ship, he was not qualified to say something like that.
<br><br>
What in the world made him so confident to say those words? "Shut up!"
<br><br>
Yan shouted in frustration.
<br><br>
Her yell seemed to hold some power as light suddenly shot out from her and towards the Evil God at shockingly fast speed.
<br><br>
It was the Words Spirit nurtured by Yan! The Truth of Holy Words was a very special type of Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
Only a few people were suited to cultivating it, even in the Source World.
<br><br>
Yan was one of these few people and was even regarded as one of the best in cultivating the Truth of Holy Words.
<br><br>
Upon reaching the consummate level of the Truth of Holy Words, a warrior would then gain the ability to form their own Words Spirits.
<br><br>
These Words Spirits were then nurtured, cared for so that they grew strong.
<br><br>
Yan had been greatly favored by the Snake Goddess on Pear Hill. When Fuxi arrived, she managed to gain the guidance of two able masters and strengthened her Words Spirit to an unimaginable level.
<br><br>
Despite this, however, Yan did not use it that often.
<br><br>
Powerful Words Spirits could kill people with a single word from their masters.
<br><br>
The more powerful ones were even said to make words come true, words that had the ability to change the course of destiny.
<br><br>
This sudden move from Yan caught the Evil God by surprise. As soon as she said "shut up," the Words Spirit came at him and sewed his lips shut.
<br><br>
"You are a mere secondary creature from my brother's inner world and that's all you will ever be. Do you really think those people from the Black Ship can make you invincible? The world isn't anything that a secondary creature like you could ever imagine..."
<br><br>
Yan lashed out this bitter, cruel truth in the Evil God's silence.
<br><br>
She could see him thrash, trying to refute all that she said, but he couldn't, not when her Words Spirit attacked him like that.
<br><br>
He was too proud, too arrogant, and not just to his enemies. He treated even those from the Black Ship like Shera as nothing more than dirt underneath his shoe.
<br><br>
Anyone who dared speak against him was dealt with ruthlessly.
<br><br>
Yan, however, could care less. She mocked him nonstop and the Evil God's face progressively got redder in rage. A killing intent surged from his body as he poised himself for an attack.
<br><br>
However, as soon as the killing intent burst out of him, a demon red light flashed above his head.
<br><br>
There was no way he would be allowed to kill in here. Yan was the chosen one by the giant eye. It measured the Evil God's strength and prevented him from attacking her.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Evil God's body was engulfed with ice-cold fear.
<br><br>
Despite feigning invincibility, the Evil God had weaknesses in his soul, much like everyone else.
<br><br>
As this overwhelming power of fear escalated, his body began to weigh him down and his face contorted in pain.
<br><br>
That said though, he still had a far stronger pain threshold than any normal warrior. Despite being in great pain, he continued to resist this power that had taken over him.
<br><br>
"Step back, Yan," Zen warned, standing in front of his sister protectively.
<br><br>
"I'm not afraid of him," she protested.
<br><br>
Yan wanted to prove to him that she was strong enough to take care of herself.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Evil God continued to fight off the power of fear, his face muscles twitching as he did so.
<br><br>
He looked ferociously grotesque as he used the soul force to resist.
<br><br>
This horrifying scene shocked the members of the Separate Abyss race, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
They too had suffered a lot after encountering the power of fear released by the Dreaded Eye Demon and knew just how horrible it was.
<br><br>
It didn't physically hurt but the pressure on one's mind was overwhelming.
<br><br>
Even Zen was surprised at how hard the Evil God resisted.
<br><br>
Back when Zen was engulfed with the maximum power of fear emanating from a hundred or so sculptures, he shared the overwhelming pressure with the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Pear Hill, and others. Even so, it proved to be extremely difficult even with the use of the Flow Swordsmanship.
<br><br>
Only a dozen sculptures were activated this time but it should be noted that the Evil God was taking it all by himself. This proved the incredible strength of his soul force.
<br><br>
Zen was definitely not going to let him do whatever he wanted outside the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
In fact, he was even more determined to put him right back into his inner world where he belonged.
<br><br>
They weren't the only ones astonished by this display of resilience. Even the giant eye on top of the cave was shocked. "Interesting! Interesting... Here comes another incredible talent, someone who can resist my power of fear!"
<br><br>
"Resist your power of fear?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits asked. "If you can't subdue him then wouldn't that mean trouble for us?"
<br><br>
For the past ten years, the Chaotic Source Spirits had been growing in power by devouring each other, as intended by the mother.
<br><br>
However, they all relied on the giant eye.
<br><br>
If it turned out that not even the giant eye could suppress the Evil God, then that was definitely going to be bad for them, which made the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits quite concerned.
<br><br>
"Humph!" the giant eye snorted in disdain through consciousness as the red light shone brighter.
<br><br>
More and more sculptures were activated, releasing waves upon waves of power of fear. All of it was directed at the Evil God, and even the people who were very close to the Evil God were not affected at all.
<br><br>
Chapter 3408 Break The Main Peak Boom! The force of fear swept like tidal waves over the Evil God.
<br><br>
As the Evil God struggled, bombarded by the full force of fear, his face twisted with pain and terror.
<br><br>
The force of fear was a special form of soul attack. Even the strongest souls had flawed hearts, and the force inevitably found the flaw and used it to release all the fear in their hearts.
<br><br>
Despite the rapid increase in the force of fear that attacked him, the Evil God managed to hold on for several seconds before he collapsed onto the ground.
<br><br>
The relationship between the races in the cave was a little complicated, but they all had one thing in common. Everyone hated the Evil God to the core.
<br><br>
Thus, the sight of the Evil God falling to the ground should have made them clap their hands and cheer. On the contrary, however, everyone was silent.
<br><br>
Some looked solemn, while others wore expressions of deep wariness.
<br><br>
The Evil God had a powerful soul, but he couldn't resist the force of fear.
<br><br>
How could they reach the upper part of the main peak? After a while, the red light vanished.
<br><br>
Being punished by the force of fear, the Evil God finally calmed down after managing to stand up.
<br><br>
He said nothing, but his face was etched with grimness. He looked around him with eyes filled with suspicion and doubt.
<br><br>
The Evil God had seldom been beaten since he entered the Source World.
<br><br>
He did not know who had employed the force of fear, but he vowed that he would find out and take his revenge.
<br><br>
"The force of fear is so strong. We are no match for whoever employed it.
<br><br>
How can we continue to climb up?" someone asked in a worried tone.
<br><br>
Mount replied, "Even if we manage to climb up, we will find it difficult to defeat those Chaotic Source Spirits if we are suppressed by the force of fear."
<br><br>
The main peak was very dangerous to climb, even without taking any other factors into considerations. They also had the Chaotic Source Spirits to contend with. After these spirits swallowed each other, their strength increased significantly, and they posed a huge risk for anyone who dared to climb the main peak.
<br><br>
"We can't return empty-handed," someone said gloomily.
<br><br>
Everyone fell silent, wondering what would be the best course of action.
<br><br>
Yan had said that if they missed this opportunity, it would be impossible for any of them to reach the Chaotic Source Realm in the future.
<br><br>
No one was willing to turn back at this point without anything to show for it.
<br><br>
As they discussed the matter, they were interrupted by a sharp, cracking sound.
<br><br>
They looked up. The sound was coming from the top of the cave.
<br><br>
The sculptures on the roof of the cave seemed to have gotten loose, and cracks had appeared on the surface. Three staircases extended down from where the cracks had appeared.
<br><br>
The base of one of the staircases was right next to the huddled disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. Zen quickly went to the staircase and took a few steps up. He peered towards the top of the staircase, trying to see what lay ahead.
<br><br>
But it was dark and shadowed. No one could see what was there.
<br><br>
Like Zen, everyone else was craning their necks, trying to get a look at the top of the stairs. However, no one but Zen had dared to place a foot on the steps. They weren't willing to risk facing whatever was up there.
<br><br>
While they could only see darkness, they correctly sensed that some great danger lay in wait.
<br><br>
Everyone present was well-versed in the nature and tactics of fighting.
<br><br>
While they didn't know what exactly the Chaotic Source Spirits were thinking, they could just imagine what they would suffer if they rashly marched up unprepared for what they were about to face.
<br><br>
The Evil God immediately knew what everyone was thinking. He stood still, looking around with a mocking smile. He said to everyone through his life vitality, "Like the rest of you, I don't know what's up there, but since they have invited us, it won't be difficult to find out."
<br><br>
Zen, Mya, Khalid, Hamzah and the others frowned. Mya stepped towards the Evil God and said in a low voice, "How can you say that after you were tortured by the force of fear?"
<br><br>
Mya and the rest of them knew how to fight visible enemies. They could defeat them effortlessly.
<br><br>
After all, they all had powerful Other Shore Tokens. Even if they encountered stronger masters at the Other Shore Realm, they still had a fair chance to win any battle.
<br><br>
For example, the Evil God was powerful, but when the four members of the Separate Abyss race fought him together, he succumbed under their combined strength. This was the magic of the Other Shore Tokens. If their abilities were combined perfectly, the power released would be increased tenfold or even a hundredfold.
<br><br>
But the top of the main peak held an enemy whose power was completely unfamiliar to them. The one attack they were sure to face, the force of fear, was something they couldn't resist. They were certain that if they went up right now, they would just end up getting killed.
<br><br>
"If you think it's too dangerous to go up from here, maybe we can go up on the outside," the Evil God suggested.
<br><br>
Most of the warriors here were more used to following orders than thinking outside the box. They wanted to break through inside the main peak.
<br><br>
In fact, there was another way up. They could fly to the top of the main peak outside.
<br><br>
At the Evil God's suggestion, many began nodding in agreement.
<br><br>
"The hurricane outside is very strong," Mya objected.
<br><br>
The Evil God glanced at Mya and asked, "Haven't you ever dug holes in the ground?"
<br><br>
Many creatures present had dug holes all the way from the edge of the Chaotic Source World, so they naturally understood what the Evil God was trying to say.
<br><br>
"Let's get out of here," Khalid proposed.
<br><br>
This time, even more people nodded vigorously. The Evil God's plan was better than the alternative. They were prepared to do as they were told.
<br><br>
In order to get the Chaotic Source Spirits, all of them had formed a temporary, tenuous alliance with each other, forming one large and unified group.
<br><br>
The Evil God laughed. "But there is another way! It is more simple, and it is the one I prefer."
<br><br>
Everyone, including Zen, stared at the Evil God in puzzlement and exasperation. They wondered what trick he was playing now.
<br><br>
"The main peak is very long and narrow in diameter. It's high, but not very bulky, so if we work together, we might be able to break it. What do you think?" the Evil God asked slyly.
<br><br>
Everyone began speaking at once, looking surprised at the Evil God's solution. "Break the main peak?"
<br><br>
"What a bold idea! Do the people of the Pear Hill agree?"
<br><br>
"As they said, this is the last time the Chaotic Source World opens, and there will be no Chaotic Source Spirits in the future. Who cares if we break the main peak?"
<br><br>
They quickly grasped that getting to the top from the outside was only a slightly better choice than just going up the stairs. In either case, they would still be passively entering an unknown situation.
<br><br>
It was definitely a much better choice to break the main peak directly.
<br><br>
Everyone turned to look questioningly at the people of the Pear Hill. Before Yan could speak, Natalie said with a shrug, "Our masters didn't tell us specifically what to do. They let us play it by ear."
<br><br>
Hamzah said, "In that case, we can do as he said. But... I wonder if there is a hurricane outside now?"
<br><br>
He thought breaking the main peak was an excellent plan, but he worried that everyone would just be swept away by the hurricane if they did that.
<br><br>
"Some of my clansmen keep watch outside," said a nonhuman creature covered in something green. "The hurricane will stop at any moment."
<br><br>
Seeing that everyone was eager for action, the Evil God smirked. "Then let's get started. Remember, we only have one chance to do this right."
<br><br>
The Evil God and the others had all been conversing through their life vitality, so the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits and the giant eye at the top couldn't hear them.
<br><br>
The giant eye was narrowed in doubt. Through its consciousness, it said, "What are they waiting for? Why don't they go up the stairs?"
<br><br>
"They are cowards," said the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits contemptuously. Firmly she added, "But they won't give up this opportunity."
<br><br>
At that moment, the pupil of the giant eye suddenly shrank.
<br><br>
"Oh no!"
<br><br>
The scarlet force of fear spiraled in the pupil. However, before it could be released, a violent roar came from below.
<br><br>
The crowd eager to get to the top was comprised of a powerful and diverse group of warriors. Their combined power could not be underestimated.
<br><br>
Most of them could control a level of strength up to one thousand divine megatons. Some could easily control an even greater level of strength, especially those from the Separate Abyss race. By virtue of their perfect bodies, even if they did not reach the Chaotic Source Realm, the strength they exerted was comparable to that of the said realm.
<br><br>
A rumbling sound echoed as the main peak trembled.
<br><br>
A second later, the middle part of the main peak suddenly shook violently, as though it was being torn by an earthquake.
<br><br>
Chapter 3409 Joining Hands For The Moment In the middle of the ring-shaped mountain range, some creatures had gathered in the arrays surrounding the main peak.
<br><br>
Not wanting to risk their lives, they didn't dare step outside of the arrays.
<br><br>
At least within the arrays, they could seek some shelter from the terrible hurricane.
<br><br>
Rumble! Suddenly, the center of the main peak exploded in a cloud of smoke and dust.
<br><br>
The creatures huddled in the arrays widened their eyes in shock.
<br><br>
"What happened in the main peak?"
<br><br>
"Such strength!"
<br><br>
"It cracks! It cracks! The main peak is about to collapse!"
<br><br>
When the dust cleared, they saw a huge crack in the middle of the main peak, and it was growing rapidly.
<br><br>
The entire ring-shaped mountain range quaked as the cracks crawled towards its edges.
<br><br>
The main peak, which was up to a million feet high, slowly began to tilt to one side. The tip of the peak suddenly broke off, crashing into the east side of the ring-shaped mountain range, destroying that as well.
<br><br>
The creatures who were gathered in the arrays stood motionless before the scene that was unfolding, dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Only the other half of the main peak was left, rendering the once towering mountain now an almost flattened plain! Naturally, the bystanders were stunned.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits lurking in the upper part of the main peak began to stir as they sensed this change.
<br><br>
While they didn't know what was going on exactly, they couldn't calm down until the mother comforted them.
<br><br>
"Is this your plan?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits asked pointedly.
<br><br>
The giant eye floating inside the main peak began to emanate a depressed aura. It had just wanted the foolish young talents to take the bait. It had never expected that the creatures would not climb up the stairs-- instead, they had sliced off the main peak! "Don't panic! They have to come inside if they want to take the Chaotic Source Spirits!" The giant eye reassured the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits through its consciousness.
<br><br>
After the collapse of the main peak, the force of fear that restrained people also disappeared.
<br><br>
All the races grew even more cautious. Besides, they couldn't lower their guard against the Evil God.
<br><br>
Zen stood in front of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the members of the Snake Goddess race. In his inner world, the Eye of Will, the Strength God Totem and that Civilization Artifact quietly floated.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Khalid, Mount and Mya didn't plan to take any action.
<br><br>
Killing the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace was important to them, but getting enough Chaotic Source Spirits for the Chaotic Source Reinforcement was more important at the moment.
<br><br>
Nobody knew what was lurking in the main peak. But they knew that they needed to join forces with everyone in order to defeat it first.
<br><br>
Everyone seemed to be lost in their own thoughts, trying to figure out what to do next.
<br><br>
On the contrary, the Evil God was the calmest. With a mischievous smile creeping around his lips, he broke the ice. "The main peak has collapsed now. What are you so worried about?"
<br><br>
Hearing this, the others looked at him, speechless.
<br><br>
Hamzah from the Separate Abyss race mocked bitterly in his heart. 'He's talking nonsense. He's the biggest threat to us now.' All the others silently shared the sentiments. They were afraid this lunatic would stab them in the back.
<br><br>
"Let's go, Zen," Yan suddenly said, as she shot the Evil God a cold glance.
<br><br>
She had always hated that guy.
<br><br>
Compared to the others, Yan was not that afraid of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and gestured to the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace, telling them to fly down from the top of the broken mountain.
<br><br>
As the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill took the lead, members of other small forces also followed closely behind. Then the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race and the Separate Abyss race followed on their heels.
<br><br>
The last few races picked up the pace. No one was willing to stay with the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God kept sitting there, unmoving.
<br><br>
However, the Chaotic Source Reinforcement also mattered to him. He might've been insane, but he was no idiot.
<br><br>
It wouldn't be late for him to deal with them after he obtained enough Chaotic Source Spirits...
<br><br>
As soon as the main peak fell, the races who had taken shelter in the arrays slowly started coming out, one after the other. Since the Chaotic Source Spirits were hidden in the main peak, now was their chance to find some.
<br><br>
Arriving at the foot of the main peak, Zen announced, "We won't go in. We can attack it from the outside."
<br><br>
As he spoke, his eyes narrowed slightly. Activating the Authentic Visual World of the Eye of Will, he saw all the flaws on the main peak, as clear as day.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Waving the Snow Sword lightly, he shot out a sword radiance to chop at the main peak's flaws.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
Suddenly, a large crack ripped through a corner of the main peak, shattering boulders as it went.
<br><br>
However, the main peak was extremely huge. Although there were many flaws, they were not concentrated to one area; even if Zen could see and cut the flaws, it'd take him an eternity before he destroyed them all.
<br><br>
Yan pressed her hands together, seemingly in prayer. Then, the blood-red shadow of the Snake Goddess appeared behind her.
<br><br>
The hands of the shadow of Snake Goddess stretched out, sending out countless streaks of pure red energy. Every time a streak of energy whipped downwards, it'd destroy multitudes of rocks in the peak.
<br><br>
'Yan isn't relying on any Other Shore Token, ' Zen pondered in awe.
<br><br>
'Instead, she summoned the shadow of the Snake Goddess, which could burst out over a thousand divine megatons of force!' He nodded in approval.
<br><br>
Yan had grown stronger than he expected in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Zen suspected that she might have fused with a good Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
That was why she had no intention of giving in when facing the Evil God.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the members of the Snake Goddess race launched themselves into the air and activated their Other Shore Tokens, casting terrifying energy on the main peak one after another.
<br><br>
Behind them, many races like the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, the Separate Abyss race and the Celestial Wolf race also joined in the attack.
<br><br>
In order to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits, they had all unanimously decided to cast aside their differences.
<br><br>
That giant eye in the main peak was distressed by this scene.
<br><br>
"Didn't you say they would come in anyway?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits complained.
<br><br>
"Let the Chaotic Source Spirits fight against them for a bit," the giant eye advised.
<br><br>
"I've already sent them there. Although we can hold them off for a while, we will eventually be exhausted..." the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirit said dejectedly.
<br><br>
The half peak that had fallen to the ground was like a dead giant, suffering the attacks of the crowd.
<br><br>
Each stream of energy ruthlessly ripped open a piece of flesh of the giant.
<br><br>
However, as the Chaotic Source Spirits cruised inside the body of the peak, suddenly the entire main peak solidified into a smooth, shiny surface with no imperfections-- not even a hairline crack.
<br><br>
"It's the Chaotic Source Spirits!"
<br><br>
"They are in the rocks!"
<br><br>
"Dig them out!"
<br><br>
People cried out excitedly. They had all dug out several Chaotic Source Spirits before, so this was like a beacon of hope to them. Together, they attacked the rocks more fiercely.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Splash! With so many people joining hands, an extremely terrifying amount of force was unleashed onto the peak.
<br><br>
Having been attacked mercilessly, the Chaotic Source Spirits lurking in the mountain quickly fell into a state of exhaustion. The originally solid mountain body began to buckle and crack again.
<br><br>
Yan was the quickest of them to notice. The moment she discovered a crack, she channeled the red threads of energy from the arms of the shadow of Snake Goddess to get into the crack. With a flick of her wrist, she pulled out more than a hundred Chaotic Source Spirits! Chapter 3410 The Mother Emerged At that moment, the various races broke into gasps when they saw the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
After all, they had roamed across the Chaotic Source World for a really long time, but harvested very little. There were some lucky ones who were able to get dozens of Chaotic Source Spirits, but the others got nothing.
<br><br>
To their surprise, Yan actually drew out a hundred Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Of course, it made everyone excited! "Everyone, come on!"
<br><br>
"As long as the mountain wall is broken, we can dig out Chaotic Source Spirits!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the Chaotic Source Spirits reinforced anything they had been integrated with to a great extent.
<br><br>
If they were continuously battered, however, they quickly became exhausted.
<br><br>
It was known that there was a large amount of the Chaotic Source Spirits in the mountain.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
Just then, a new crack appeared on the mountain wall.
<br><br>
This time, Mya, the genius of the Divine Farmer race was quick to act. In a blink of an eye, her long curly hair extended up into the crack and with a slight twist, her hair had killed the Chaotic Source Spirits hiding inside the crack. After they were stripped of their blood and flesh, her hair had pulled out dozens of amber crystals.
<br><br>
"Sure enough!"
<br><br>
"All the Chaotic Source Spirits are in there!"
<br><br>
"Everybody, charge up!"
<br><br>
Even the warriors who hesitated to move couldn't sit still anymore.
<br><br>
They all descended and stood on the mountain wall of the main peak, then smashed and punched the wall like mad.
<br><br>
All they needed was for the Chaotic Source Spirits inside the mountain to get tired, then the warriors simply had to reach through the cracks and pull the Chaotic Source Spirits out. After the warriors killed them, they stripped the amber colored crystals from their bodies and put the crystals into their space rings.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits were a kind of living beings, and they also referred to the crystals in their bodies.
<br><br>
"How savage are these warriors…" Zen said and shook his head. Then again, Yan's method, which consisted of inserting her energy threads in the crack then instantly evaporating the blood, flesh, and bones of the Chaotic Source Spirits was no different.
<br><br>
Her method of killing them was also bloody.
<br><br>
There was nothing the Chaotic Source Spirits could do to ease their tragic fate.
<br><br>
The warriors outside the mountain continued to dig happily, while the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits and the huge eye who were hiding inside were in deep agony.
<br><br>
"These damn creatures! They have gone too far this year..." Resentment filled the black eyes of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Trapped in the Chaotic Source World, the Chaotic Source Spirits were like meat on the chopping block.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, such a way of cultivation was like a game and also a trial for the geniuses of the super forces.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, however, had been trying her best to save the creatures of her own race since she had gained wisdom. She summoned a considerable number of the Chaotic Source Spirits and gathered them all together at the main peak. If anyone dared to enter the main peak, they absolutely fought back.
<br><br>
Her efforts did work. Now, almost no one dared to enter the main peak. In addition, she only needed to sacrifice more than half of the Chaotic Source Spirits every ten years to keep the rest safe.
<br><br>
The giant eye came up with such a trick this time, but it was not helpful at all. What was worse was that the whole main peak was destroyed, which was the last thing she wanted to see.
<br><br>
The huge eye stared at what happened outside in silence.
<br><br>
"If this goes on, we will lose more of our Chaotic Source Spirits, and we will only be weaker and weaker! What should we do?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits cried out and urged for a solution.
<br><br>
"We have no choice but to fight our way out..." said the huge eye through its consciousness. As it spoke, a sharp light flashed deep inside of its eyeball.
<br><br>
The descent of the huge eye was such a well-kept secret that even the people of the Pear Hill hadn't noticed it.
<br><br>
Although the Pear Hill was in charge of the operation of the Chaotic Source World, they rarely entered the core area. If the two of them rushed out, their plan would probably be ruined.
<br><br>
At the same time, they would be beaten passively if they stayed hidden inside.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had long harbored a grudge against the creatures outside. When she heard what the huge eye had said, she immediately gave an order.
<br><br>
Outside the main peak, the members of different races and disciples of various forces continued to plunder the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Later on, some of the warriors who were wandering in the periphery of the Chaotic Source World also joined them when they arrived.
<br><br>
At that point, the dark smog in the sky surged again. It meant that the hurricane was about to come.
<br><br>
"Hurricane is coming!"
<br><br>
someone shouted.
<br><br>
The creatures who were gathered at the top of the main peak heard the warning, and quickly retreated.
<br><br>
Some hid in arrays, and some had dug holes in the ground and hid inside, waiting for the hurricane to pass.
<br><br>
Outside the Chaotic Source World, the leaders didn't know whether to cry or laugh when they saw the scene.
<br><br>
They actually didn't know what happened at first. They thought it was strange that no one went to the arrays to receive Chaotic Source Reinforcement. When they finally saw them retreat from the four mountain peaks, they immediately understood what was going on.
<br><br>
They never expected that all the warriors would break the main peak with joint forces.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the various races didn't lose many of their key figures. The current situation was just fine as they looked at it.
<br><br>
As soon as the hurricane stopped, the warriors hiding in the holes flew up again and continued to attack the mountain wall.
<br><br>
A member of the Separate Abyss race stepped directly on the mountain wall. There was a layer of extremely sharp cyan light floating in his hands.
<br><br>
He pounded the wall with his fists several times, until the part of the wall he was hitting exploded.
<br><br>
This one warrior cheered in delight, then enthusiastically buried his hands in the hole to take the Chaotic Source Spirits inside.
<br><br>
When he put his hands in, however, he saw two red eyes glow in the crack.
<br><br>
The eagerness in his face was gone.
<br><br>
He immediately kicked hard against the wall with his strong legs to try to distance himself from the mountain wall, but it was too late.
<br><br>
"Aoo!"
<br><br>
A bright red thing emerged from the mountain wall. It was biting hard at the warrior of the Separate Abyss race, until it chomped on his head. The warrior twisted his strong body a few times in an attempt to escape, but he suddenly went limp. He eventually stopped moving.
<br><br>
The warrior had a large build, so the Chaotic Source Spirit couldn't swallow him at once completely.
<br><br>
Things were even worse on the other side of the mountain wall. Two warriors from the Divine Farmer race were also digging for Chaotic Source Spirits until they saw the glowing red eyes inside. Before they could react, a large bloody mouth swallowed their whole bodies.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, every race had lost several members who were devoured by the large bloody mouths.
<br><br>
"Retreat!"
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source Spirits are coming out!"
<br><br>
"I told you not to approach the mountain wall!"
<br><br>
Most people were still very cautious. Zen, Yan, Dorothy, and some others kept a distance from the mountain wall while they smashed it. When the Chaotic Source Spirits emerged from the mountain wall, they lightly lifted their bodies and instantly distanced themselves from them.
<br><br>
"They finally came out," Zen said.
<br><br>
He had warned the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, the Pear Hill, and the Ear Mice not to get too close through chaotic energy.
<br><br>
If too many Chaotic Source Spirits were lost, the rest of them would definitely rush out and fight for their lives.
<br><br>
Now, his prediction was right. Therefore, none of the members of the Oneness Sky Palace, the Pear Hill, or even the Ear Mice got injured.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
On the mountain wall, the large-sized Chaotic Source Spirits finally got out of the cracks. In addition to their size, they also exuded a malicious aura.
<br><br>
Yet, they didn't attack immediately. They remained attached to the mountain wall and just leered at the creatures above them with hatred.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, a bigger crack ruptured and split the top of the main peak in half.
<br><br>
It immediately caught the attention of all the creatures around.
<br><br>
The moment the broken mountain top fell, a huge eyeball emerged, and beside it was an enormous Chaotic Source Spirit that measured ten thousand feet high.
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes were transfixed on the huge Chaotic Source Spirit. At the same time, they all thought of the same thing: It must be the mother of all the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Chapter 3411 A Bloody Eye Everyone was on their guard; they were wary not only of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, but also of the huge eye.
<br><br>
As they had felt the force of fear in the cave that contained many sculptures before, they assumed that it would be waiting for them in the main peak.
<br><br>
They had been well-prepared and already known what to expect, but they were still dumbfounded when the huge eye came into their view.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Every creature from all of the races retreated at the sight that greeted them.
<br><br>
The warriors that had hidden in the arrays before had been disheartened at their own weakness. The moment they saw the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits, they immediately fled for their lives.
<br><br>
They turned back to the direction they came from and flew directly towards the nearest magic arrays.
<br><br>
"Now that you have forced us out, you can't turn your backs on us!"
<br><br>
A flash of red light came from the huge eye, and suddenly, a circle of blood lines radiated out from it at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
When everyone felt the blood lines sweep over their skin, their hearts skipped a beat.
<br><br>
The blood lines had already spread out over an area with a radius of a hundred thousand feet in the time it took them to blink.
<br><br>
The magic array closest to them was right outside the perimeter of the blood lines. A few individuals braced themselves and rushed towards the magic array.
<br><br>
This particular array was set up by several powerful masters. They believed that as long as they hid within it, it would protect them.
<br><br>
But even a slight contact of their fingers with the blood lines sent a sensation similar to an electric shock through their bodies.
<br><br>
They felt the force of fear spike within their hearts, triggering their psychological flaws. Those with weak constitutions lost their minds; some cried out helplessly in an attempt to vent their emotions. In the end, they had no choice but to leave the blood lines.
<br><br>
When Zen's group saw the blood lines, their eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
They realized that the huge eye had limited everyone's movement, and essentially trapped all of them.
<br><br>
It was obvious that the Chaotic Source Spirits and the giant eye were very complacent regarding their own strength, and they had no doubt that they would be able to kill everyone.
<br><br>
After the main peak had collapsed, the Evil God had been wandering around as if he didn't have a care in the world.
<br><br>
When the huge eye and the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits showed up, his interest was piqued greatly.
<br><br>
The problem was, he was far away from them. The blood lines had not been able to reach his location, so he approached the very edge of the blood lines' territory.
<br><br>
"The giant eye's force of fear is extremely terrifying, but it won't last long."
<br><br>
The Evil God fixed his gaze on the blood lines below him; he strode towards them with something like excitement and curiosity mixed together.
<br><br>
The moment he came in contact with the blood lines, the force of fear shot straight into his heart.
<br><br>
His face scrunched into a frown and his eyes flashed with an unusual color.
<br><br>
He braced himself against the force of fear and endured its attacks. He walked over them with a sense of realization.
<br><br>
"It's just as I expected." The Evil God raised the corners of his mouth slightly, with a look as if he had everything in full control. "The stronger the Other Shore Tokens are, the weaker their own strength is. You are too confident in your power."
<br><br>
The Evil God was not one to be easily fazed. He had wanted to make his move back in the cave of the main peak, but he was hindered by the force of fear.
<br><br>
It was from that moment that he became determined to find out whatever being was controlling the force of fear.
<br><br>
After the main peak was cut off and the huge eye forcibly materialized, the Evil God was determined to not let it go.
<br><br>
He knew his analysis and evaluation were correct.
<br><br>
Some Other Shore Tokens provided people with abilities they didn't previously have, and some of them were extraordinary. As an example, the mysterious type of Other Shore Tokens provided abilities that their opponents couldn't guard against. Some, like the Eye of Will and the Heart of Accomplice, had extraordinary abilities, but their Other Shore Power was actually extremely weak.
<br><br>
The huge eye had the ability of the Malicious Stare. It was terrifying, but it clearly was not powerful.
<br><br>
When the warriors outside of the Chaotic Source World saw that their clansmen were trapped, they were in an uproar.
<br><br>
"Why did an Eye of Will appear in the Chaotic Source World?"
<br><br>
"Pear Hill, please give us an explanation!"
<br><br>
"Open the Chaotic Source World and let us go inside!"
<br><br>
The younger generation were more reckless than the leaders of the super forces, their lack of experience lending them a false bravado.
<br><br>
It was extremely rare for the Dreaded Eye Demons to be seen on the Other Shore, but it wasn't a mystery where they came from. After all, they used to be one of the ruling civilizations.
<br><br>
At that moment, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had rushed out of the mountain, together with the Eye of Will. The younger generation couldn't resist them, no matter how powerful they were.
<br><br>
Athemar's and Winchell's expressions had become grim.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was the one in charge of monitoring the Chaotic Source World. Was the Pear Hill aware of what was happening? If they were, why did they permit them to go inside? More importantly, Other Shore Tokens only existed in the Source World when they were carried by creatures in their inner worlds. The only exception had been the Chaotic Source Spirits with a special form.
<br><br>
So, how did the huge eye appear in the Source World like the Chaotic Source Spirits? This had defied all notions of common sense.
<br><br>
Elizabeth spread her wings majestically and launched towards the gate leading to the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
A tongue of flame curled upwards and released a scorching aura. Coldly, Elizabeth said, "Let me through."
<br><br>
The Divine Lair had a huge loss in the recent events, so Elizabeth wanted to make sure that her other clansmen had a chance to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The women of the Pear Hill who had been guarding the gate leered at Elizabeth coldly. One of them told her, "Aside from the young warriors who have been given tickets, we cannot allow anyone else to enter the Chaotic Source World."
<br><br>
Elizabeth frowned unhappily and answered back, "Something unexpected has happened inside. If we do not intervene, all of them will die!"
<br><br>
"This is not the first time that a large number of young people die in there; it often happens through the ages," the woman replied. "Our Pear Hill did not establish these rules alone. Emperor Charm of your race also contributed to it. If you try to get past us by force, don't blame us if we use force to restrain you!"
<br><br>
"You..." Elizabeth gave the woman her fiercest glare, but she wasn't able to retort.
<br><br>
Although she thought that the guards weren't seriously threatening, it would really be troublesome for her if she attacked the people from Pear Hill in the Icy Snow Province. She had no choice but to give up.
<br><br>
The other leaders of the super forces weren't able to do anything either.
<br><br>
They could only place their best hopes on their clansmen, praying that they could survive their encounter with the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits and complete the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.
<br><br>
On the top of the snowy mountain, Fuxi was settled on the snow, giving no mind to the interior of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
He gazed far into the distance, skimming over the Chaotic Source World, and stopped at the boundary of the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
A thin space crack was slowly enlarging there.
<br><br>
Several sharp claws insidiously extended from inside the space crack. A small bloody eye was on top of them.
<br><br>
The creature inside the space crack was very good at hiding itself. Even if the space had been torn apart, its aura was undetectable, as if it could perfectly merge with the space.
<br><br>
"Such a hiding theurgy is truly extraordinary. If I hadn't used the Eight Diagrams disk for calculation, I wouldn't have detected this," Fuxi muttered silently. "Let me see what your intentions are."
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had not been able to see the changes within the Chaotic Source World in the beginning.
<br><br>
It was not until what had happened in the Chaotic Source Sea that Fuxi had used the Eight Diagrams disk for his calculations and found out the truth.
<br><br>
He had also incidentally discovered the Eye of Will in the main peak of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
The Eye of Will was an Other Shore Token, and as such, people of the Pear Hill knew that it should not have existed in the Source World without a carrier.
<br><br>
If it was true that the Other Shore Tokens could exist in the chaos without carriers, it would mean trouble for the entire Source World. It seemed that the situation in the chaos was about to change phenomenally.
<br><br>
Chapter 3412 Cyan Silk Cloth After the giant eye released blood lines that enveloped everyone who was present, it released a message through its consciousness.
<br><br>
"Why don't you take action?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits roared angrily after receiving the message.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the other huge Chaotic Source Spirits that had been staying on the main peak leapt up and flew towards all the warriors.
<br><br>
Although many races had temporarily allied themselves with other races, no one wanted to sacrifice themselves. That was why they all retreated to the edge of the blood lines.
<br><br>
The only thing was that the area that the blood lines covered had the radius of only a hundred thousand feet. With the Chaotic Source Spirits moving at such a high speed, they could surely arrive in just a blink of an eye! At that point, Hamzah shouted, "The members of the Separate Abyss race! Listen to me!"
<br><br>
He knew that things wouldn't end well for them if they retreated constantly.
<br><br>
Right now, what they could do was to fight those powerful Chaotic Source Spirits to the end.
<br><br>
Under Hamzah's command, all the members of the Separate Abyss race took out their Other Shore Tokens and pulled out their weapons. The Chaotic Source Spirits were flying fast, and they would come any minute now.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Two Separate Abyss men pulled out their huge hammers. One of them jumped up while the other lay prone on the ground.
<br><br>
Two strange cones floated above their heads. The cones were a pair that were used together. Once the two Separate Abyss men carried the cones simultaneously and cooperated with each other, the cones increased the Other Shore Power they released by multiple times.
<br><br>
"Swoosh! Swoosh!"
<br><br>
Both sides were formidable opponents. The blood red Chaotic Source Spirit in front of them had a very large size, while the two members of the Separate Abyss race were also tall and strong.
<br><br>
The two big hammers launched an attack together and unleashed an unimaginable amount of power! Just as the two men from the Separate Abyss race were about to hit the Chaotic Source Spirit, a red light from somewhere not too far away shot towards them and hit their heads.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
At that moment, the two men began feel afraid. Their faces paled and their hearts pounded erratically in their chests.
<br><br>
"Quack!"
<br><br>
As the two of them were trapped by the power of fear, the Chaotic Source Spirit opened its bloody mouth wide.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
It all happened so fast that there was only a mere snapping sound, and the heads of the two men were gone.
<br><br>
"No!" Hamzah screamed.
<br><br>
He quickly ran towards them to help his companions, but it was obviously too late for him to do that now.
<br><br>
In a fit of rage, he activated his power. His skin turned red, as if numerous parasites had bitten him. Then, he poured his majestic power into the body of the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit took Hamzah's heavy blow. It was immediately smashed into the ground and left a crater with a diameter of over three hundred feet in its wake.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had cultivated all those Chaotic Source Spirits. Generally speaking, they were formed after the Chaotic Source Spirits devoured each other. Naturally, the Chaotic Source Spirits that were eaten supported the bodies of their hosts. It was the reason that the Chaotic Source Spirit was unharmed despite Hamzah's fatal attack! Such a thing didn't just happen to Hamzah.
<br><br>
The members of the Sun Crow race, the Bearing race, and the Celestial Wolf race also encountered the same situation.
<br><br>
Since numerous members from many races were gathered together, they could possibly resist one or two Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Yet every time they fought, there would always be a few rays of red light that would flash at them.
<br><br>
It was safe to say that to be affected by such a strong power of fear in times of crisis proved to be fatal.
<br><br>
Many members from various bigger races had lost their lives in an instant.
<br><br>
Even though it was hard to guard oneself against the power of fear, there was still a way to deal with it.
<br><br>
"Ding, ding, ding..."
<br><br>
Milo, who was wrapped in a coir raincoat and carried an invisible long sword in his hand, flew around a Chaotic Source Spirit. He looked like a graceful butterfly.
<br><br>
His long sword turned into the dense sword rain and poured onto the Chaotic Source Spirit's body.
<br><br>
In order to kill the Chaotic Source Spirit, one had to let it bear excessive power and exhaust it until it was extremely fatigued.
<br><br>
So, Milo did that just to consume the Chaotic Source Spirit's strength.
<br><br>
"Watch out, Milo!" one of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace shouted.
<br><br>
At that exact same moment, a ray of red light was shot towards Milo.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit that Milo had been attacking bared its fangs when it saw the red light. It intended to swallow Milo as soon as his mind wasn't functioning well.
<br><br>
As the red light was about to hit Milo, his eyes got glassy and dull, and he lost his consciousness completely.
<br><br>
In this state, the power of fear clearly couldn't affect him at all.
<br><br>
Losing one's consciousness was equivalent to surrendering their life to their opponent.
<br><br>
When Milo's consciousness disappeared, however, he became more agile.
<br><br>
He easily avoided all of the Chaotic Source Spirit's attacks and at the same time, he launched an even fiercer assault against the Chaotic Source Spirit again.
<br><br>
Like Milo, Chaim was able to avoid the power of fear as well.
<br><br>
It had been a long time since he had last used the Living Puppet Chains.
<br><br>
Now, it was time to let the Living Puppet Chains pierce his body once more.
<br><br>
Naturally, Chaim became just like a puppet. It meant that even though he was hit by the power of fear, it wouldn't cause that much damage to him.
<br><br>
The power of fear that the huge eye released was limited. Without the arrangements that were made in the main peak, its ability would be far weaker.
<br><br>
Some members of other races had come up with the effective methods after they suffered losses.
<br><br>
More than ten warriors had died in the beginning, but after they employed such methods, no one was killed since then. All the races did their best to fight with the blood red Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
"Cluck..."
<br><br>
Eventually, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits began to get restless.
<br><br>
She had painstakingly cultivated the Chaotic Source Spirits for a long time.
<br><br>
They might be able to hold on for a bit more for now, but they would be defeated sooner or later.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Suddenly, the mother stepped on the main peak, and then her tall and looming figure jumped upwards.
<br><br>
Her huge body flew in the air like a large mountain, and then shot towards the members of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"Chaim, Milo! Dodge!" Dorothy warned, her face drained of color at the surprise attack.
<br><br>
The members from different races were trapped in a radius of a hundred thousand feet, and the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits was about ten thousand feet tall.
<br><br>
Due to her massive size, she only leapt for a short distance to cover a large area.
<br><br>
Despite Milo and Chaim not being under control, they still fought and maintained their presence of mind. Thus, they were able to dodge on instinct and escaped along the wind when danger came.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
As a result, the mother fell down and left a crater that was one thousand feet wide.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the huge, ten thousand-foot-tall mother kept moving and attacking within the limited area. Everyone began to feel anxious and stressed.
<br><br>
The warriors who were in fierce battles with the other Chaotic Source Spirits ran away when the attacks were near.
<br><br>
Still, the power of fear descended from time to time and trapped two or three men. Those unlucky warriors were either eaten or crushed by the mother.
<br><br>
Some members of the Oneness Sky Palace, the Snake Goddess race, the Ear Mouse race, the Bearing race, and even the Sun Crow race got attacked as well. Within less than thirty seconds, about thirty warriors had died.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the giant eye was still floating in the sky. It kept on accumulating the red light and releasing it from its pupil.
<br><br>
If the huge eye continued its strikes at such a speed, then it and the mother would be able to kill everyone without much effort.
<br><br>
Of course, they would not kill those most important people.
<br><br>
Just then, the giant eye suddenly sensed two puffs of aura that came from behind it.
<br><br>
With a slight roll, its pupil had moved to the back and was greeted with the sight of Zen and Yan.
<br><br>
"How dare you attack me?!" the giant eye shrieked. It began to release its power of fear, but then a cyan silk cloth appeared in Yan's hand.
<br><br>
The silk cloth looked very exquisite, and had strange patterns on its surface.
<br><br>
As soon as the huge eye released the red light, Yan lightly shook the silk cloth.
<br><br>
The cloth deftly wiped away the power of fear that was shot towards them.
<br><br>
The members of the Pear Hill were already aware of the Dreaded Eye Demon's existence before, so they naturally gave the countermeasure to Yan. It was just that it was not appropriate for her to show this item before, so she only brought it out now.
<br><br>
Chapter 3413 The Braveness Rain The giant eye's pupil shrank in horror upon seeing the cyan light from the silk cloth.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The blood red force of fear formed a helix, shooting toward Zen and Yan.
<br><br>
Such force of fear was enough to push ordinary Souls of Light into endless fear until they died in the throes of madness.
<br><br>
Yan, however, showed no fear. She gently waved the cyan silk cloth, which promptly extended up to ten feet in the wind.
<br><br>
As the silk cloth unfurled, it began to spin in front of Yan, forming circles of cyan light.
<br><br>
Splash! The force of fear came into contact with the cyan light. But it evaporated instantly, like snowflakes in the blazing sun.
<br><br>
"The force of fear is indeed strong in some aspects. No matter how strong a man's will is, after all, there would always be something that they are afraid of. However, attacks like that are easy enough to shatter," Yan said calmly.
<br><br>
Some evil and sinister methods were very horrible. But these methods were difficult to use, not because they were not of the right origin.
<br><br>
In such a big world, there were always so many people who wanted to be stronger.
<br><br>
However, those who resorted to vicious means, though powerful, had their limits. To become truly strong warriors, people must find the right way forward.
<br><br>
"Braveness Rain!"
<br><br>
Yan shouted. The cyan light emanating from the silk cloth transformed into cyan raindrops which poured down from the sky, heading straight for the giant eye.
<br><br>
At the sight of the cyan raindrops, the giant eye released panic consciousness again.
<br><br>
Its two abilities, however, wouldn't work this time.
<br><br>
One of them was the Authentic Visual World, which was an auxiliary ability to help it distinguish the enemy's weakness more clearly and see through the illusions of magic arrays. But this ability couldn't help it block the enemy's attacks directly.
<br><br>
The other was the force of fear, which was easily parried by the silk cloth.
<br><br>
This seemingly unremarkable silk cloth was, in fact, a treasure of the Other Shore obtained by the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
True to its name, the silk cloth could summon rain.
<br><br>
There was a rain forest in Stage Twenty-one of the Other Shore, shrouded by cyan rain over the years.
<br><br>
Once the Souls of Light entered the rain forest and the cyan rain touched them, the fear in their hearts would be dispelled.
<br><br>
They would feel a surge of blind confidence and braveness.
<br><br>
Some people would fuse with the cyan rain as an auxiliary Other Shore Token. During critical moments, they would use it to fight against the fear in their hearts so that they would become more valiant.
<br><br>
Yan's silk cloth was made of melted cyan rain.
<br><br>
Zen stood behind the silk cloth, feeling the light of the cyan rain. An irresistible impulse arose in his heart, imbuing him with renewed confidence.
<br><br>
'But this confidence is too unrealistic, ' Zen thought. He circulated the mind method of the Flow Swordsmanship to suppress the effects of the cyan rain.
<br><br>
"Click! Click! Click! Click! Click!"
<br><br>
Although the giant eye flew fast, it couldn't dodge all the tiny water drops.
<br><br>
The cyan rain poured over a large area.
<br><br>
Some of the raindrops made contact with the giant eye. Immediately, a sizzling sound could be heard.
<br><br>
The rain could melt the Dreaded Eye Demon! The giant eye quickly fled in pain.
<br><br>
"Zen, let's go after it!"
<br><br>
Yan touched the center of the silk cloth with her finger and rushed forward swiftly.
<br><br>
Zen also flew up, following suit.
<br><br>
When the main peak was broken, Zen had been at a loss.
<br><br>
He had one Eye of Will, so he knew how powerful the thing was.
<br><br>
But the giant eye at the top of the main peak was more powerful than the Eye of Will he had. If they found no way to expel the force of fear, the giant eye would be an invincible existence for them.
<br><br>
But Yan quietly passed on a message to him, telling him that the Pear Hill had a plan.
<br><br>
Zen felt a warm sense of pride seeing her like this. She was now completely independent.
<br><br>
But because the Chaotic Source Spirits were on the attack, Zen was still worried about her safety and chose to protect her.
<br><br>
Click! Click! Click! As the silk cloth rolled in the wind, cyan raindrops sprinkled everywhere.
<br><br>
Some fell accidentally on several Ear Mice. In an instant, their cowardly nature dissipated and they began charging at the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Continually eroded by the cyan raindrops, the giant eye, originally as clear as a mirror, was now dim and riddled with pits and holes.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The giant eye fled to the other side of the main peak in a bid to avoid the raindrops.
<br><br>
Yan stepped lightly on the surface of the main peak. Then she flew down the side like a storm, countless raindrops at her flanks.
<br><br>
But just as she flipped over, a voice suddenly called out.
<br><br>
"What an interesting thing. I'll take it!"
<br><br>
Swish! A black figure lunged at Yan at a very fast speed.
<br><br>
Yan didn't expect there was a man hiding at the side of the main peak. Her face darkened as she drew the silk cloth closer to her. "Shield!" she spat out.
<br><br>
An invisible light curtain covered her in a flash.
<br><br>
With her current theurgy, Yan could now launch an attack by merely speaking.
<br><br>
One word was enough to protect herself.
<br><br>
It wouldn't be easy for talents at the same level to break the light curtain.
<br><br>
But the black figure was much stronger than Yan's expectations. He reached out a hand emitting countless colors. Then a white light burst out. The light curtain broke, as if it was as fragile as glass.
<br><br>
"You!"
<br><br>
Yan then recognized the man. It was none other than the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked at her with a wicked smile.
<br><br>
The force of fear was the biggest obstacle in his way. If the giant eye restrained him, he would find no way to resist.
<br><br>
But he could fix that problem with this silk cloth.
<br><br>
He was determined to rob it from Yan on the spot.
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God tried to grab the silk cloth, a sword shot out from behind Yan's body. A sharp sword radiance extended and stabbed into the Evil God's palm.
<br><br>
The smirk was wiped off the Evil God's face as the sword light went through his hand. His face darkened.
<br><br>
A ray of colorful light gathered on his palm. It was the Ways-blending Energy! The diamond-shaped Ways-blending Energy had been piled up to more than one hundred and twenty layers by the Evil God. It was extremely powerful and could overpower the Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
The Ways-blending Energy, condensed to the extreme, burst instantly when it made contact with the sword radiance. The overwhelming power spread in all directions like a scorching sun, attracting the eyes of many people and even the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Other people would probably be immediately swallowed up by such power.
<br><br>
But Zen was also very familiar with the Ways-blending Energy! The sword attack he had launched was to force the Evil God to retreat.
<br><br>
The instant the Ways-blending Energy burst out, Zen had grabbed one of Yan's hands. Yan, still clutching the silk cloth, was pulled backward to a safer distance.
<br><br>
This would be the first time Zen fought with the Evil God since he released the latter out of his inner world.
<br><br>
Chapter 3414 The Second Flaw The bright scorching sun shone high up in the sky. All of a sudden, it disappeared.
<br><br>
The light that was shining upon Zen a moment ago vanished in an instant.
<br><br>
With that, a strange expression flickered in his eyes.
<br><br>
The Evil God raised his hand gently. The diamond-shaped pieces created from the Ways-blending Energy assembled together and danced upon his palm.
<br><br>
The light of the pieces shimmered. It was a beautiful and splendid thing to behold. However, it was also extremely dangerous.
<br><br>
"I have to thank you for your help. You have given me an opportunity to practice the Ways-blending Energy to this extent," said the Evil God with a wry smile. "As far as I know, there are not a lot of Godly Ways found within common people's inner worlds."
<br><br>
Zen remained silent for a while.
<br><br>
He did not care about the Evil God's words. He was most interested in the Ways-blending Energy instead.
<br><br>
Three thousand was not always the exact number. Different masters had different methods of summarizing Godly Ways.
<br><br>
The three thousand Godly Ways Zen and the Evil God had practiced was summarized by Chiyou.
<br><br>
Both Zen and the Evil God were quite accustomed to using these three thousand Godly Ways.
<br><br>
However, Zen found something unique in the Ways-blending Energy now.
<br><br>
There was a gleam of faint white arc light among the pieces.
<br><br>
But because the white arc light only occupied one three-thousandth of the Ways-blending Energy, Zen could not clearly make sense what it was.
<br><br>
What did the Evil God put into the Ways-blending Energy? The Evil God noticed that Zen was gazing at the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Seeing this, he broke into an even bigger smile. "Are you wondering why my Ways-blending Energy is so powerful?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen replied with all honesty. He was really intrigued by what he saw.
<br><br>
"It's because the three thousand Godly Ways you pride yourself in are flawed. Hahaha..." The Evil God laughed wildly and continued, "Today I will show you something completely extraordinary, so that you may know what the perfect Ways-blending Energy truly is!"
<br><br>
He spread out both of his hands and the diamond-shaped Ways-blending Energy spread like the wings. This display of power was remarkable.
<br><br>
The structure of the Ways-blending Energy was extremely complicated. Its current state was very unpredictable and unstable but it seemed rather mutable. Moreover, the power contained within it was awfully terrifying.
<br><br>
"Yan, retreat!" Zen ordered at once. There was no time to waste.
<br><br>
Yan held the silk cloth with one hand while she made a gesture with the other.
<br><br>
The power of the Ways-blending Energy was indeed terrifying but Yan believed she had the power to withstand it.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Zen's tone was very serious. Yan pursed her lips but chose to follow her brother's order. Obviously, Zen was concerned for her safety.
<br><br>
Yan was able to sense her brother's emotions very clearly. She knew all too well that Zen wanted to deal with the rebel who came out of his inner world personally. She fully respected Zen's decision to do this on his own.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Yan leapt away from them. She had already put quite some distance between her and the Evil God. Meanwhile, she continued to stare warily at the Evil God and the giant eye that was hiding on the other side of the main peak. She knew she shouldn't let her guard down for even a second.
<br><br>
The giant eye was afraid of the silk cloth. It wouldn't dare to fight back just yet. It remained hidden and unmoving.
<br><br>
As the Evil God gently pushed his hands forward, the diamond-shaped Ways-blending Energy pelted towards Zen like feathers.
<br><br>
Zen remained standing still and didn't bother to dodge the attack.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Several scorching suns exploded around Zen.
<br><br>
As they exploded, they emitted dazzling lights which disappeared in the blink of an eye. Zen merely looked at them and returned his gaze to the Evil God.
<br><br>
There wasn't even a single scratch on Zen after the attack. He was completely unharmed.
<br><br>
"Were you able to see it clearly? Hahaha!" The Evil God laughed once again and said, "Never in your lifetime would you be able to uncover the secret hidden inside it. Don't even bother trying to solve this mystery. I am the only one who can achieve it in this world!"
<br><br>
The members and disciples of the other races heard this while they were fighting against the Chaotic Source Spirits. The Evil God's statement thoroughly baffled them.
<br><br>
They were fully aware that the power of the Ways-blending Energy was strong. But what was the Evil God so proud of? They couldn't quite understand it.
<br><br>
There were a lot of powerful masters in the Source World. Many of them had put a lot of effort in studying the Ways-blending Energy. However, all of them only reached a dead-end. Ultimately, they had no choice but to give up.
<br><br>
They had to admit that the Evil God was powerful. It was just that they didn't have much interest in the Ways-blending Energy. All they wanted to do was merge with the Other Shore Tokens and obtain greater Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
They were not the only ones who thought of it like this.
<br><br>
Through the magic array, the leaders of many large races waiting at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World were able to see clearly what just happened.
<br><br>
Elizabeth frowned at the Evil God's statement. She didn't understand it as well.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Athemar and Winchell looked grave. The members of the Separate Abyss race and the Bearing race, and the Ear Mice also shared the same sentiment with the two.
<br><br>
"Winchell," Athemar said, "it seems like there is a special energy contained in the Ways-blending Energy of that young man in black." Athemar noticed something while watching Zen through the magic array.
<br><br>
Even though they did not cultivate so many Godly Ways, they had a general understanding of the energies that existed in the whole world. He was quite perplexed at the kind of energy he just observed.
<br><br>
Winchell nodded his head grimly. "Never in my life have I seen such an energy before," he responded.
<br><br>
"Is it the power of some Other Shore Token?" an Ear Mouse speculated as it tried to comprehend it as well.
<br><br>
"The Other Shore Power couldn't be fused so perfectly," Athemar said as he shook his head. "It is truly strange and quite inexplicable."
<br><br>
It seemed like they didn't have a total understanding of the energies after all. The vast majority of people did not know that the original energy of this world was actually incomplete.
<br><br>
Fuxi sat on top of the snowy mountain. As he moved his gaze back from the edge of the Icy Snow Province to the core area of the Chaotic Source World, he also witnessed the scorching suns.
<br><br>
His eyes narrowed slightly when he noticed the white arc light within the energy. Like most of them, he was puzzled too.
<br><br>
"How is that even possible?"
<br><br>
Fuxi had successfully merged three thousand Godly Ways. He also had a better understanding of the Ways-blending Energy than all the leaders gathered at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
"Why is there an extra energy? Where does it come from? If I am not mistaken, this didn't exist between heaven and earth in the past," Fuxi wondered out loud. After a while, something dawned upon him. "I see... No wonder the Ways-blending Energy cannot be perfected. Without this energy, they could not be fully merged. Any efforts will be in vain! Now the only question is, where did this guy get this energy?"
<br><br>
Fuxi was absolutely stumped.
<br><br>
Many years ago, people thought that the Ways-blending Energy was the original energy. Once the energy of three thousand Godly Ways was fully merged, even the truth-level theurgies wouldn't be able to match it.
<br><br>
Lots of supreme masters took severe painstaking efforts for countless years to perfect this. Yet, they still failed to merge the energy of three thousand Godly Ways. Finally, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others concluded that the Ways-blending Energy was impossible to complete.
<br><br>
The Evil God's gaze was fixed on Zen. He kept watching him as he launched his attack.
<br><br>
He wanted to see the look of astonishment and disbelief on Zen's face.
<br><br>
However, he was completely disappointed. Zen's expression remained impassive. After a while, Zen finally opened his mouth to speak. "If I were you, I would not make this energy public," he said in a calm manner.
<br><br>
"Do you think I'm as cowardly as you are? Don't make me laugh," the Evil God mocked Zen.
<br><br>
"After all, you are not able to complete the Ways-blending Energy either,"
<br><br>
Zen continued as he shook his head. "But because you have exposed this energy now, people will only covet it."
<br><br>
"Haha! I can't complete the Ways-blending Energy?" The Evil God's face broke into a proud smile. "I have already merged two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine Godly Ways, including this one. I only need the Thunderstorm Godly Way now. I am one step away from completion!"
<br><br>
As the Evil God spoke, he stared arrogantly at Zen. However, there wasn't any sign of admiration or surprise on Zen's face.
<br><br>
Zen retained his calm demeanor. He replied, "Clearly, you have done a great job. Nevertheless, you will never be able to take that final step because the Ways-blending Energy has more than one flaw."
<br><br>
Chapter 3415 The Flaws Of The Chaos It was true that the Evil God had merged more Godly Ways than Zen ever had.
<br><br>
He only needed one more Godly Way to completely finish the cause. It was unbelievable for him to achieve this with his current cultivation base.
<br><br>
If this happened before, Zen probably would have waited before doing anything, just to see what the Godly Ways Great Unity could produce.
<br><br>
However, with the help of the Regal Jade Spirit, Zen had already grasped that the chaos was imperfect.
<br><br>
Among the three flaws, Zen obtained one through the Regal Jade Civilization. He was able to claim the Blood Essence Godly Way, but the remaining two were still a mystery to him.
<br><br>
After his son, Geoffrey, deciphered and interpreted the Sanskrit word formed by blood vitality, he gathered some clues for his search. The Regal Jade Spirit had guessed that one of the flaws stood close to the Element Spirit race, otherwise known as the second civilization. But the exact existence was still unknown.
<br><br>
Little did he know that the Evil God had already gotten a flaw! He also didn't know if the power within the arc light was a gift from the Black Ship to the Evil God or he obtained it from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Evil God was a proud, arrogant being, who was very keen on showing the unique energy he had obtained.
<br><br>
For him, Godly Ways Great Unity was just round the corner.
<br><br>
The only thing that bothered him was that his energy had a way of clashing with the Thunderstorm Godly Way.
<br><br>
He attempted over a million times, with no success whatsoever.
<br><br>
He removed the Thunderstorm Godly Way and placed the arc light together with the other Godly Ways. In this way, the three thousand Godly Ways stabilized to his advantage.
<br><br>
The reverse of this also worked wonders. However, the moment the two forces were added to the Godly Ways at the same time, the Ways-blending Energy would collapse.
<br><br>
The arc light proved to be a form of thunder, one that was violent and difficult to control. That was what made it so incompatible with the Thunderstorm Godly Way.
<br><br>
All things considered, the Evil God had tried all methods only to meet failure.
<br><br>
He even attempted to use the Other Shore Power in order to suppress and force the two thunder energies to merge. However, like all of his trials, this failed as well.
<br><br>
What Zen said stunned the Evil God.
<br><br>
"What did you say? There is more than one flaw?" The Evil God gave Zen a look of disbelief.
<br><br>
Those who remained in the Chaotic Source World didn't dare to say a word after Zen spoke. It was met with silence.
<br><br>
After all, they had no business with the Ways-blending Energy. They thought it was not that extraordinary, except Mount, who was not like the others.
<br><br>
In the same moment, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was causing a disruption in the area. Anyone who didn't pay attention would be crushed by her.
<br><br>
As everyone ran for their lives, Mount and Mya decided to take action.
<br><br>
Mya's curly hair began to extend to tens of thousands of feet as her face was finally revealed. Her piercing, blue eyes were focused, and she manipulated her hair to wrap itself around the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Even though the mother was much stronger, she couldn't help but be bothered by the messiness of the hair being wrapped around her.
<br><br>
After Mya was able to successfully restrict her movement, Mount began to suppress her.
<br><br>
As he did so, he heard Zen's words despite the noise. He was deep in thought, and his body trembled in surprise. He looked at Zen in pure astonishment.
<br><br>
At the same time, Fuxi, who remained outside the Chaotic Source World, raised his eyebrows. "There is more than one flaw in the Ways-blending Energy? How could this be? If it's true, how many flaws are there?"
<br><br>
If it weren't for the creature that appeared at the edge of the Icy Snow Province, he would have just asked Zen himself.
<br><br>
What puzzled Fuxi even more wasn't the fact that there were more flaws, but that Zen had known it all along.
<br><br>
It was known that three thousand Godly Ways were formed directly through the chaotic energy. The chaos was composed of Dark and Light energies, and these two energies transformed into the five mighty elements. These were the elements that created all things that existed.
<br><br>
In effect, the energy that was constantly divided was considered the internal momentum of the three thousand Godly Ways, otherwise known as the basis to form all chaotic energy.
<br><br>
This meant that if any flaws existed, then the chaotic energy and the chaos would have flaws.
<br><br>
Zen glared at the Evil God, his body pulsing with adrenaline. "Yes," he said.
<br><br>
"There is more than one."
<br><br>
"How did you know that?" the Evil God questioned, doubting the existence of more flaws.
<br><br>
But as much as he wanted to prove Zen was wrong, he knew Zen was not one to lie.
<br><br>
The Evil God discovered the flaw by chance. Having almost died on the Other Shore, he risked his life just to obtain the arc light.
<br><br>
Could it be that Zen had discovered something, too? Perhaps that was where he found other flaws? "But why should I tell you?" Zen taunted.
<br><br>
This was a bust to the Evil God's ego. He narrowed his eyes, and a hint of vengeance flashed in his eyes.
<br><br>
Although he was known to be extremely arrogant in front of Zen, he still had deep reverence for him.
<br><br>
Shera helped him block any contact with the Rebirth Land, keeping him away from Zen's control. However, no matter how hard he tried, he was still a product of Zen's inner world. The fact that Zen was his creator couldn't be ignored.
<br><br>
With that being said, Evil God was determined to know all of Zen's secrets.
<br><br>
"You don't need to tell me anything," the Evil God smirked, "I just have to devour you."
<br><br>
In an instant, the Evil God's aura soared towards Zen.
<br><br>
The turbulent Ways-blending Energy began to spread out, ready to attack. It radiated magnificent colors as it morphed into a diamond-shaped sword.
<br><br>
With the sword in hand, the Evil God charged towards Zen in a swift movement.
<br><br>
"Brother! Watch out!" Yan called out from above.
<br><br>
"It is useless, you fools!" As the Evil God chuckled, he swung his huge sword across the air, leaving a trail of colors before waving it towards Zen's head.
<br><br>
Just then, a red circle of light spread out, and the force of fear from it began to attack the Evil God.
<br><br>
The highly condensed Ways-blending Energy was extremely unstable.
<br><br>
Affected by the force of fear, the Evil God couldn't control the Waysblending Energy. Just like that, it exploded, resembling a huge, blazing sun.
<br><br>
With the amount of energy that had been released, even the Evil God himself would have to suffer if attacked by it. At the expense of his energy, he tried to suppress the fear and flew backward, giving him a chance to dodge.
<br><br>
Yan, with the silk cloth in one hand, gently sprinkled the Braveness Rain across Zen's body to remove the force of fear. "I didn't ask my brother to watch out for you," she mumbled.
<br><br>
The Evil God calmed himself down as much as he could before turning his head.
<br><br>
The eye was restrained by the silk cloth in Yan's hand. He couldn't defeat the eye alone.
<br><br>
He stood no chance against Zen and the force of fear of the eye.
<br><br>
Clenching his teeth, he turned around and dashed to the side of the main peak without another word.
<br><br>
"Brother, must we chase after him?" asked Yan, staring at the black figure that grew smaller the farther it went.
<br><br>
"Do you honestly think that eye will help us?" Zen shot a question back at her, smiling.
<br><br>
"No." Yan shook her head.
<br><br>
"Then we take that eye down first," Zen said.
<br><br>

<br><br>
He was able to slaughter his way across the Chaotic Source World after all, and not just because he depended on the Ways-blending Energy According to the man from the Separate Abyss race, the Evil God had the ability to descend a world but hadn't used such a powerful trump card yet.
<br><br>
The giant eye released its overwhelming power of fear, which was a threat to everyone. Eliminating this threat was the most urgent at the moment.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen was determined to get the arc light in the Evil God's hand.
<br><br>
The giant eye felt extremely depressed.
<br><br>
It let out the force of fear in order to help the Chaotic Source Spirits. On the other hand, this, coupled with the giant sword created from the Evil God's Ways-blending Energy, would no doubt help in getting rid of Zen.
<br><br>
Since there was no way it could take their physical bodies, the giant eye focused on self-preservation instead.
<br><br>
Yan's alertness and willingness to protect Zen came as a complete shock along with the explosion of Evil God's sword strike. Just what in the world was going on? Without any idea what to do and with its hope running out fast, the giant eye turned around and entered the main peak.
<br><br>
Seeing this, Zen promptly changed his direction and threw a punch towards the outer wall of the main peak, creating a big hole from which he and Yan entered.
<br><br>
The place where the giant eye and Zen entered was in the upper part of the main peak.
<br><br>
Multiple traps had been set here previously by the giant eye, along with the engraved sculptures that littered the walls.
<br><br>
As soon as Zen and Yan entered, all of the sculptures' eyes flashed dark red and the giant eye's force of fear surged, enveloping them almost instantly.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
All around them were glinting, dark red eyes that threatened to subdue them.
<br><br>
"Go mad!"
<br><br>
Zen understood the giant eye's actions. It was no doubt getting desperate.
<br><br>
When the force of fear was amped up to maximum, it had the ability to drown its opponent's mind and disorder their Memory Flame. It could wash away all memories and leave behind a singular emotion: fear. A man who only knew fear was doomed to live in constant, paralyzing paranoia.
<br><br>
The amount of fear that was headed towards their way made Zen pale.
<br><br>
Yan scoffed at this scene. She gently pulled Zen closer as a burst of cyan light from the silk cloth enveloped them, turning into a huge cloak that protected the two.
<br><br>
This silk cloth would protect them no matter what.
<br><br>
"Let me help you," she whispered to her brother's ear.
<br><br>
Staying underneath the silk protection would be inconvenient.
<br><br>
They had to move fast, owing largely to the fact that the Evil God remained a threat over their heads. It would be best to finish this fight with the giant eye as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in understanding. "Okay."
<br><br>
Rays of cyan light appeared on the silk surface as soft Braveness Rain started to pour. Yan pulled the silk cloth off them and let the drops of Braveness Rain wash over them.
<br><br>
With this blessed protection, Zen was able to move fast. He flew in midair and rushed towards the giant eye in breakneck speed! "Stay away from me!"
<br><br>
the giant eye warned through a streak of consciousness. As Zen got closer, it let out a beam of red light that hit him directly.
<br><br>
Despite its attack, Zen remained unharmed due to the protection of Yan's Braveness Rain.
<br><br>
Wasting no time at all, he drew his sword and slammed down.
<br><br>
"Bang!" There was a reverberating sound as his sword hit the giant eye smack at the pupil.
<br><br>
Eyes were the most vulnerable part of any creature, and the Dreaded Eye Demons were no exception.
<br><br>
The only reason they could rule the chaos for a period of time in the past was that no creature dared to look at these Dreaded Eye Demons, or they would risk spending their lives in endless fear.
<br><br>
Zen managed to pierce his sword right into the creature's pupil.
<br><br>
As his sword split its pupil, it scattered, tainting the white of the eye and painting a rather horrible picture to look at.
<br><br>
"Ouch!"
<br><br>
The pain was great and the giant eye simply wanted to roll away to seek refuge into the depths of the main peak.
<br><br>
However, Zen wasn't going to give it that chance! He raised his sword a second time and white sword radiance flickered on the surface of the blade.
<br><br>
Thinking fast, the eye shot a ray of white light towards Zen.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for the giant eye, it did nothing to immobilize the man.
<br><br>
"Nine-Flash Light-splitting!"
<br><br>
Zen's sword radiance flashed as he began to strike hard and fast, cutting the eye multiple times in a span of a short time.
<br><br>
Cuts littered every square inch of the eye's surface.
<br><br>
These cuts healed rapidly but a new one always replaced the ones that closed.
<br><br>
For a while, only the sound of Zen's fury could be heard as he continued this tirade of attacks.
<br><br>
Faced with the reality that it could no longer fight back, the giant eye ceased struggling and stood still, allowing Zen to litter it with cuts.
<br><br>
When he realized that the giant eye no longer fought back, Zen stopped.
<br><br>
He had no idea what kind of existence this giant eye was. If the Eye of Will was a creature from the Other Shore, then the only way it could appear in the Chaotic Source World was if it was an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
However, if it was an Other Shore Token, who was its bearer? Zen approached the giant eye cautiously and a flash of blood-red light burst out from it all over again. Despite the protection of the Braveness Rain, Zen felt the frightening power of this red beam.
<br><br>
"Is it burning itself?"
<br><br>
An Other Shore Token had the ability to produce a terrifyingly powerful flame.
<br><br>
This powerful flame had its consequences though. It could cause the bearer to die and there was no way an Other Shore Token would do it willingly unless it found no more hope to its situation.
<br><br>
Just as the eye began to burn, the cyan silk cloth from Yan flew and wrapped itself tightly around it.
<br><br>
Zen didn't notice Yan arrive beside him. She picked up the cyan silk cloth and flicked her fingers. "Seal!" With her command, the cyan silk cloth completely sealed the troublesome giant eye.
<br><br>
"I'll give this to the Pear Hill," she told Zen who nodded in understanding.
<br><br>
Yan stretched out a dainty finger and tapped her space ring, sucking the sealed giant eye into it.
<br><br>
One of her established tasks had been to deal with the Dreaded Eye Demon and she had now accomplished it.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill was greatly interested in the eye and Yan will be delivering it to Fuxi.
<br><br>
Had it been anyone else, Zen would never allow them to take this giant eye, but Yan was different. He couldn't refuse her.
<br><br>
With the eye dealt with, they turned their attention back to the deafening roars from outside. The two of them exchanged a nod. "Let's go!"
<br><br>
The bloody lines the giant eye had drawn were now completely gone and everyone could move freely.
<br><br>
Some Chaotic Source Spirits relentlessly hunted down the Ear Mice who, when they could no longer defend themselves, sought refuge in the arrays.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits could do nothing as the Ear Mice hid from them.
<br><br>
Several large Chaotic Source Spirits had also broken down, bursting in piles of amber-colored crystals that were immediately grabbed by multiple hands from various races.
<br><br>
Chapter 3417 Snatch In the chaotic situation, another Chaotic Source Spirit fell. As the Chaotic Source Spirits swallowed each other, the one that devoured the others strengthened itself each time.
<br><br>
But they weren't moving all that quickly despite their amazing defensive power. So they could only be moving targets in the face of the outstanding warriors and talents of various races.
<br><br>
A member of the Moon Spirit race was covered with a faint curtain of light.
<br><br>
The light curtain twisted the light, allowing the warrior to hide herself completely.
<br><br>
With that, it was difficult to detect her existence without using spiritual sense.
<br><br>
When she saw the Chaotic Source Spirit fall, she flew across the air sharply and quickly. Then, she reached out and stuffed a bunch of amber-colored crystals into her space ring.
<br><br>
Over 300 crystals were in her possession now, according to her count. With so many crystals, it was enough for her to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Her brother was still inside an array. It was too dangerous outside, after all.
<br><br>
This time, she could give him over a hundred Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Overjoyed, the member of the Moon Spirit race rushed toward the nearby array.
<br><br>
Entering it meant absolute safety. Moreover, no one had sensed her existence in the chaos.
<br><br>
When the array was only about a hundred feet away, a great black shadow enveloped her.
<br><br>
Sensing that something was wrong, she raised her head on instinct.
<br><br>
A huge member of the Separate Abyss race descended from the sky. The large brown hammer in his hand then released the formidable Other Shore Power as he struck.
<br><br>
Bang! The Moon Spirit warrior's body was smashed into pieces. The Separate Abyss man reached out and grabbed her space ring. Then he threw all its contents on the floor, and collected all the crystals before stepping into the array.
<br><br>
Hiding in the array, the Moon Spirit warrior's brother was wide-eyed in shock at the scene.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss man glared at the boy with disdain as he scolded, "We're the ones who killed the Chaotic Source Spirit! How dare you snatch them from us!"
<br><br>
If it weren't for the array's protection, the Separate Abyss man would have killed the boy without hesitation.
<br><br>
In the presence of the super forces, the small races were weaker and did not quite have the right to speak.
<br><br>
On the opposite side...
<br><br>
Hutton made use of a purple vine.
<br><br>
It grew seemingly endlessly around a Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
The vine was highly tough, enough that neither sword nor saber could damage it. Even if the Chaotic Source Spirit tore the vine apart, it could easily grow back rapidly.
<br><br>
While the Chaotic Source Spirit continued roaring, it had nowhere to release its power and could only struggle in vain.
<br><br>
Behind the Chaotic Source Spirit, Dorothy and her avatar held their swords, releasing sword light all over the sky.
<br><br>
Buzz! The sword light was like a silver cloud as it floated in the air.
<br><br>
It continued emerging. 10, 000 rays of sword light merged into 5, 000, then 5, 000 into 2, 000, 2, 000 into 1, 000, 1000 into 500, and so on.
<br><br>
In the end, all the rays of sword light turned into a single, highly condensed sword light.
<br><br>
"Origin Spirit Sword Attack!"
<br><br>
Clatter...
<br><br>
The sword light shot straight at the Chaotic Source Spirit and hit its back.
<br><br>
Boom! The invincible sword attack failed yet again to break the Chaotic Source Spirit's defense. Dorothy showed no sign of surprise.
<br><br>
Before the Chaotic Source Spirit grew too exhausted, its defense was impregnable.
<br><br>
But its energy could be consumed quickly. If Dorothy struck it a few more times to max out its remaining energy, she could kill it.
<br><br>
Bang! The Iridescent Stone arrived after Dorothy attacked. It hit the back of the Chaotic Source Spirit once again.
<br><br>
Sally's attack was nowhere near as sharp as Dorothy's and Elvinia's, but its frequency was truly intense. The Iridescent Stone naturally disappeared the moment it hit the target and then reappeared in Sally's hand. Once she tossed the stone, it went straight for the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
From where she stayed, Elvinia used the Warrior of the Stone Hill to produce countless streaks of blazing sword radiance.
<br><br>
At that moment, Chaim grew rather embarrassed. He had used the Living Puppet Chains again, so now he could only watch from the sidelines and keep the others alert.
<br><br>
Under the warriors' unrelenting attacks, the Chaotic Source Spirit grew tired. Its huge body was dismembered, and the crystals within its body began flowing out onto the ground.
<br><br>
Spotting the amber-colored crystals, everyone was overjoyed.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit contained around 2, 000 crystals—it was no wonder it was so powerful.
<br><br>
The crystals in this Chaotic Source Spirit were enough for about ten people to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.
<br><br>
When they managed to kill the Chaotic Source Spirit, three figures suddenly swept past them.
<br><br>
They were from the Divine Farmer race. From the way their looks and clothes matched, they seemed to be brothers.
<br><br>
For a long time, they were observing the entire scene. The moment the Chaotic Source Spirit fell, they took their chance and rushed toward the crystals.
<br><br>
"Brother! Pick them up!"
<br><br>
one of them with a mustache called out.
<br><br>
With a wave of his hand, another strong man, with the naked upper body, collected all the crystals on the ground and put them into his space ring.
<br><br>
"You're just… courting death!"
<br><br>
Elvinia's eyes filled with rage upon witnessing the scene.
<br><br>
To shatter this Chaotic Source Spirit, they did their best to fight against it as fiercely as they could. How could they allow anyone to snatch away what they had just obtained? When a streak of light flashed across her eyes, the Warrior of the Stone Hill waved swords with a thousand left hands simultaneously.
<br><br>
"One thousand swords!"
<br><br>
The weapons intertwined, forming a kind of dense sword-net.
<br><br>
"Mingle and become one!"
<br><br>
With that, the Warrior of the Stone Hill launched a powerful sword attack.
<br><br>
The three-dimensional sword-net served as something like a cage with an astonishing ray of sword radiance. It mixed with the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. With its glowing aura, it attacked the three brothers headon.
<br><br>
Elvinia wasn't alone—Dorothy, employing the Origin swordsmanship, Hutton, Sally, the other Nine Li warriors, and even some disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace also attacked the trio.
<br><br>
The three were known to be powerful in the Divine Farmer race. While they might not have been as strong as Mount and Mya, they were still second to them.
<br><br>
With the confidence they had in their skills, they were daring enough to snatch the Chaotic Source Spirits right in front of the Oneness Sky Palace's people.
<br><br>
"Shadow Realm!"
<br><br>
The leader of the three brothers patted his head lightly, making a dark gem pop and rotate out of it.
<br><br>
As the gem spun, their bodies turned somewhat vague.
<br><br>
"The Dark Realm Stone?" Chaim raised his brows at the reveal.
<br><br>
The stone was a mysterious type of Other Shore Token. Once it was activated, it could allow itself and the people around it to enter a unique state where all attacks were rendered useless.
<br><br>
"Clatter..."
<br><br>
Countless rays of sword radiance pierced through their bodies and shot out.
<br><br>
After a slight wobble, the three brothers were completely unharmed.
<br><br>
The sight had the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace wide-eyed in shock.
<br><br>
All of the three men from the Divine Farmer race had smug smiles on their faces. "Let's go!" said their leader. "We'll be safe once we enter the array!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3418 The Energy Levels If the three brothers from the Divine Farmer race entered the magic array, it would be all the Oneness Sky Palace disciples could do to watch them helplessly.
<br><br>
There, they could safely refine the Chaotic Source Spirits and even give the extras to other people of their race.
<br><br>
In the state of the Shadow Realm, the brothers moved very slowly.
<br><br>
But no matter how much the Oneness Sky Palace people attacked them, they remained unaffected. It was only a matter of time before they entered the array.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Elvinia, and the others used a number of methods to attack them, but to no avail. Everyone's faces fell.
<br><br>
"It's no use!" The tallest of the brothers burst into laughter as he boasted.
<br><br>
"Your energy levels are not nearly high enough to deflate the Shadow Realm," murmured Chaim, who remained relatively calm.
<br><br>
"What energy levels?" Elvinia asked with a long face.
<br><br>
For a moment, Chaim examined the brothers before continuing, "All the forces in the chaos can be regarded as the flow of energy. But the energy itself can vary from high to low."
<br><br>
Although Chaim wasn't an expert, he knew the different energy levels.
<br><br>
Life vitality was the lowest level of energy. All warriors in the Source World and creatures in the inner worlds could easily use it.
<br><br>
When condensed to its extreme, life vitality became the Godly Way. Its internal momentum then turned into the second level of energy, flowing much faster than the first.
<br><br>
The power of the Other Shore Tokens belonged to the third level of energy —the most popular one among masters in the Source World.
<br><br>
But the Other Shore Tokens had all sorts of strange abilities. Those of mysterious type, most especially, could reach higher energy levels. The Shadow Realm wasn't particularly difficult to deflate so long as one could touch or even just affect it. If anyone managed to do so, the realm would perish instantly.
<br><br>
Some Other Shore Tokens could boast about unique abilities, including deflating the Shadow Realm.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Oneness Sky Palace disciples present carried no such power. All they could do was watch as the three brothers slowly drifted away.
<br><br>
Now, not only the disciples but also the team leaders at the gate of the Chaotic Source World, including Athemar and Winchell, were angry.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits they had just obtained were snatched away by the Divine Farmer race, after all. Of course, they were enraged.
<br><br>
The leader of the Divine Farmer race gave Athemar a mocking smile. This time, ten members of the Divine Farmer race could undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. How could they resist being so smug? Just as the three brothers moved twenty feet away, Zen and Yan came from the other side.
<br><br>
They had just sealed the Eye of Will together. Seeing that the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace seemed both murderous and helpless, Zen frowned in surprise. "What happened?"
<br><br>
"They took away our Chaotic Source Spirits!" Elvinia responded angrily.
<br><br>
"Really?" Zen's eyes flashed.
<br><br>
He gently flicked the long Snow Sword, making a beam of cold light shoot toward the three brothers.
<br><br>
Whoosh! The sword radiance instantly pierced through the three men's bodies, leaving no damage at all.
<br><br>
"This brat really thought he could hurt us!"
<br><br>
"How stupid!"
<br><br>
"The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace are mostly ignorant. Forgive them!"
<br><br>
The trio seemed even prouder than they were before. They didn't seem to be in a rush from the very beginning. Once they saw Zen, they turned around and moved toward him. It was clear that they were trying to provoke him.
<br><br>
"Zen, you can't deflate the Shadow Realm with normal methods," Chaim prompted. "But it is said that the Shadow Realm itself is quite fragile. It can be disturbed fairly easily because the Dark Realm Stone from the temple in Stage Thirteen is of the lowest level."
<br><br>
"So what? You can't destroy the Dark Realm Stone no matter what level it's at," one of the brothers snorted.
<br><br>
Zen's brow raised as a red light flashed in his right eye. He forced fear to rush toward the trio.
<br><br>
"The force of fear?"
<br><br>
"Unbelievable!"
<br><br>
For a moment, Zen's power startled them.
<br><br>
But it still didn't manage to disturb the Shadow Realm. It went right through the trio's bodies.
<br><br>
Yan, standing next to Zen, frowned slightly. The crimson shadow of Snake Goddess began emitting from her body. Thin red antennas shot toward the three brothers, but to no avail.
<br><br>
"There's a huge gap in energy levels. It's too difficult to deflate the Shadow Realm like this," Chaim sighed in defeat.
<br><br>
"The energy levels…"
<br><br>
Zen's gaze froze.
<br><br>
It wasn't the first time he had heard of energy levels. In order to break Nicholas' Furnace of Dark and Light back in the divine land, he had used the Truth Crystal.
<br><br>
It could break the furnace because its energy level was higher than that of the latter.
<br><br>
"Just give it up, Zen. Let's look for other Chaotic Source Spirits instead,"
<br><br>
Dorothy suggested.
<br><br>
The members of several races like the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race were still fighting against the largest Chaotic Source Spirit. It was troublesome killing off any Chaotic Source Spirit, but it was better to go after another one than to waste time there.
<br><br>
Even Elvinia had looked to the other side to look for a new target.
<br><br>
The three brothers of the Divine Farmer race were smug at this point. When they walked over before Zen's eyes, the latter gently reached out his hand and conjured a small green cubic crystal onto his palm.
<br><br>
It drew the attention of the trio.
<br><br>
When Zen was at the True God Realm, the crystal was used as a powerful tool to resist enemy attacks.
<br><br>
But Zen didn't have enough blood of the Chaos Ancient God, so he couldn't produce any more Truth Crystals. As a result, the pure power of the Falling Star Palm wasn't quite enough.
<br><br>
The trio had no idea about this Truth Crystal, but they didn't perceive any special kind of power from it. It didn't faze them in the least.
<br><br>
As Zen lowered his hand, a green vortex appeared above their heads.
<br><br>
It continued swirling until a ray of green starlight fell over them.
<br><br>
Seeing the power of the Falling Star Palm, Zen smiled bitterly within.
<br><br>
Indeed, it was too weak with the use of only one Truth Crystal.
<br><br>
When the others saw the starlight, they didn't take it seriously either. It was far weaker than their own strength.
<br><br>
But when the warriors at the gate of the Chaotic Source World saw the green energy, their expressions hardened.
<br><br>
"This is…"
<br><br>
"The energy of truth level?"
<br><br>
"It's weak, but it's genuine."
<br><br>
Most of the leaders had figured out the energy level of the Falling Star Palm.
<br><br>
When Athemar saw it, his jaw slacked a bit in shock. Subconsciously, he looked over at Winchell.
<br><br>
They definitely hadn't expected Zen to be carrying such a trick under his sleeve.
<br><br>
What did Zen have to do with the Chaos Ancient God? Standing atop the snowy mountain, Fuxi kept his expression calm when he saw the green light from the Falling Star Palm. He had already known about it since he was at the bottom of the chaos.
<br><br>
It wasn't a surprise to see Zen use such a move to get rid of the Shadow Realm.
<br><br>
Chapter 3419 Return The figures of the three brothers from the Divine Farmer race were blurred, which made them look like ghosts floating in the air.
<br><br>
The techniques the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had used before just passed through their bodies without affecting them.
<br><br>
The Shadow Realm, however, had a big flaw. They needed to maintain a subtle balance with the help of the Dark Realm Stone. The balance could get broken if they weren't careful, which was why they moved carefully and at an incredibly slow pace.
<br><br>
Like a mere pebble thrown into a lake, the green starlight was so weak that it could not cause any real harm to the warriors at the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
However, it did not pass through their bodies like other people's attacks.
<br><br>
Instead, it hit the three brothers.
<br><br>
"Boom!"
<br><br>
The second the starlight bloomed, the three figures were shattered like broken glass. The surface of their bodies broke into numerous cracks and fragments.
<br><br>
After the fragments fell from the surface of their bodies, they stumbled out of the Shadow Realm.
<br><br>
The three of them obviously didn't expect that a bit of ordinary looking starlight could cause such an effect.
<br><br>
Even Elvinia, Dorothy, and the others were speechless in shock. After all, the Falling Star Palm's power was so weak that nobody really paid attention to it. It was unbelievable that it could deflate the Shadow Realm so easily.
<br><br>
"It is about the energy level," whispered Chaim. Truthfully, he was more confused than anyone else.
<br><br>
He didn't feel any Other Shore Power when Zen had released the starlight, but he saw Zen summon a green cubic crystal.
<br><br>
That crystal was not the internal momentum of the Godly Way, nor was it visualized with life vitality. The only possible answer was that it was Zen's blood power.
<br><br>
Yet, the blood power could only reach level three. Some weak blood power was at the same energy level as the internal momentum of the Godly Way.
<br><br>
Zen's was different, so what kind of blood did he have? That was only Chaim's guess by instinct, but it was very close to the truth.
<br><br>
But if his memory served him right, it was impossible for many super forces to have such a high level of blood power.
<br><br>
The three brothers were also dumbfounded.
<br><br>
They weren't weak at all, but how could the three of them defend against so many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace? The moment the Shadow Realm was destroyed, one of them flipped his hands and two ghostly machetes materialized. He then used the two machetes to attack Zen.
<br><br>
He was not afraid of anyone at this distance.
<br><br>
Once the machetes reached Zen, Zen's hands suddenly turned black. He raised them up, and two loud bangs followed. He immediately grasped the machetes' blades and effectively stopped the two weapons.
<br><br>
"His hands..." Across Zen, his opponent was so surprised that his eyes almost popped out.
<br><br>
Zen glared at him. When his Other Shore Power surged out, he suddenly twisted his hands, and the two machetes were distorted into pieces. If the man hadn't loosened his hands in time, his arms would've also been mangled.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
Since the attack failed, the three of them gave up on their plan and moved to the other side.
<br><br>
Currently, the people of the Divine Farmer race, along with the other large races, were dealing with the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Still, they kept in mind that as long as they were with their clansmen, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace wouldn't dare to offend them.
<br><br>
However, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace didn't allow them to escape.
<br><br>
Elvinia, Dorothy, and Milo launched an attack almost at the same time. The messy sword radiance formed a wall and covered the three brothers.
<br><br>
The three brothers' faces paled in fear when they saw the sharp and powerful sword radiance. "I, I will return the Chaotic Source Spirits to you.
<br><br>
Don't, don't kill me!" one of them shouted.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace present were not born yesterday, so they all knew clearly how important the Chaotic Source Spirits were.
<br><br>
They had risked their lives to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits, but these pesky men had snatched them. Now, they asked for forgiveness after Zen had forced them to return the Chaotic Source Spirits like it was nothing.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for them, there was no such thing as easy in the world.
<br><br>
"Anyone who dares to steal our Chaotic Source Spirits will lose their lives,"
<br><br>
Zen said indifferently as he stood still. There was no need for him to fight personally now.
<br><br>
Just as the net of sword radiance surrounded the three brothers, a figure fell from the sky and landed beside them.
<br><br>
"Protection!" he shouted.
<br><br>
Then, he stretched out his hands and a brownish yellow mountain shadow spread out from his body. The shadow immediately enveloped him and the three brothers.
<br><br>
"Clank! Clank! Clank!"
<br><br>
There was a series of crisp, metallic clanks as the sword radiance hit the mountain shadow. It sounded like someone repeatedly knocked a big bell.
<br><br>
The man was known as Mount, and he was from the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
"We are faced with a strong enemy right now. Why do we have to kill each other?" Mount said calmly.
<br><br>
It was known that he came from a very mysterious background, but he was now the strongest warrior in the Divine Farmer race, only second to Mya.
<br><br>
While he fought against the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, he saw his clansmen were being surrounded by the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. Thus, he immediately rushed over to stop their attack.
<br><br>
"Kill each other? Do you really have the nerve to say this?" Elvinia retorted angrily. "These three men took away our Chaotic Source Spirits. They have a death wish. You can't blame us!"
<br><br>
Mount frowned as Elvinia rebuked his words. He didn't expect that the three brothers would do such a thing. He calmly said, "Ismail, give the Chaotic Source Spirits back to them."
<br><br>
Since Mount appeared when the three brothers were in danger, they became arrogant once again.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer race wasn't afraid of the Oneness Sky Palace. Moreover, they had the full support of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race and more.
<br><br>
If these disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace dared to coerce them, they would only bring about their own destruction.
<br><br>
Yet when Ismail, the eldest of the three brothers, was about to taunt Elvinia, Mount asked them to return the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
"Why? We are not afraid of them!" Ismail refused, defiance written all over his face. Zen, Yan, Elvinia, Dorothy, and the others looked at them grimly.
<br><br>
A murderous look flashed across their eyes. It seemed that it was useless to talk to these men.
<br><br>
"Just do what I say! Stop talking nonsense!" an enraged Mount suddenly yelled.
<br><br>
The younger generation of the Divine Farmer race was very afraid of Mount, but he was very gentle in manner. No one had ever seen him lose his temper before.
<br><br>
The three brothers felt their hearts sink when they felt Mount's anger. They quickly poured out the Chaotic Source Spirits from their space rings.
<br><br>
Ismail was reluctant to return the Chaotic Source Spirits, but he dared not disobey Mount.
<br><br>
Just as Mount was about to leave with the three brothers, Zen coldly said, "That's all? Do you think this thing is settled after you've returned the Chaotic Source Spirits?"
<br><br>
In turn, Mount stared at Zen blankly while the three brothers angrily said, "We have given back the Chaotic Source Spirits. What else do you want?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3420 Ganging Up Ever since the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had entered the Chaotic Source World, several large races like the Bearing race, Divine Farmer race, and the Sun Crow race had been constantly hostile towards them.
<br><br>
These races had offended Zen many times, but now they just wanted to end the matter so easily.
<br><br>
"What do you want?" Mount stared at him and calmly asked. "Leave the lives of these three to us.
<br><br>
Or, take out an equivalent amount of Chaotic Source Spirits," Zen answered.
<br><br>
After the huge Chaotic Source Spirit had been killed, they gained a total of more than two thousand Chaotic Source Spirits--which was enough for ten people to receive Chaotic Source Reinforcement.
<br><br>
What Zen had meant was to ask the Divine Farmer race to take out another more than two thousand Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The three warriors were baffled upon hearing Zen's request. Paying an extra amount of more than two thousand Chaotic Source Spirits was even more painful than killing them! "This is way too much!"
<br><br>
"You want us to pay so many Chaotic Source Spirits as a compensation? Isn't this robbery?"
<br><br>
"No way!" the three warriors said indignantly.
<br><br>
Even Mount, who was calm before, now scowled at Zen.
<br><br>
The warriors of the Divine Farmer race had previously worked together to kill a Chaotic Source Spirit, and it was true that they obtained more than two thousand crystals from it. All of the crystals were in Mount's hands. He indeed had the ability to pay the compensation Zen asked.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer race, however, also had many members. If he gave their Chaotic Source Spirits to Zen, then there would be ten people in their race who would lose the chance to receive Chaotic Source Reinforcement. It was a big loss for them.
<br><br>
Still, Zen's expression did not change at all.
<br><br>
Everyone was currently seizing the chance to kill the Chaotic Source Spirits, and no one would want to waste time.
<br><br>
Then again, what had been said was like water that had been spilled. If the Divine Farmer race didn't want to pay, then Zen would show no mercy.
<br><br>
Although Yan didn't say anything, she stood beside Zen.
<br><br>
Her brother's enemy would also be her enemy, and she represented the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
If Mount fought here, then the Pear Hill would also be automatically involved.
<br><br>
Mount was not an indecisive person. Within about ten seconds, he had already weighed the pros and cons and knew what to do.
<br><br>
Since it wasn't the right time to think about the matter too much, he made a decision on the spot. With a flip of his hand, the light of his space ring flashed, and the Chaotic Source Spirits in the space ring spilled out and piled up on the ground.
<br><br>
Zen didn't have time to check the number carefully, but he found that the size of the pile was about the same as the pile of crystals the three warriors had returned.
<br><br>
"Let's go," said Mount.
<br><br>
The three warriors were devastated when they saw the pile of Chaotic Source Spirits on the ground, but they could do nothing about it. They could only send death glares across Zen before they finally left.
<br><br>
"This man is a decisive person…" Chaim said in a low voice as he watched Mount's receding figure.
<br><br>
Although Chaim was a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, he clearly knew that they were at a disadvantage when faced against the members of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Sun Crow race. He had a hunch that if Mount didn't pay the compensation, he would be in great trouble.
<br><br>
Zen stepped forward and gently stretched out his hand. An invisible force stuck to all the Chaotic Source Spirits. With a light flick of his finger, all the crystals went into his space ring.
<br><br>
"I will distribute these Chaotic Source Spirits later," he said.
<br><br>
He had intended to let Sally, Hutton and the other Nine Li members enter the arrays first. After all, they were the only outstanding descendants of the Nine Li race left. However, when he thought of the other disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace who might have complaints, he decided to distribute the Chaotic Source Spirits later.
<br><br>
Suddenly, they heard an ear-piercing scream that came from not far away.
<br><br>
Apparently, a Chaotic Source Spirit jumped up and caged two members of the Celestial Wolf race under its feet. Eventually, it pushed itself down and crushed the two warriors into a meaty paste.
<br><br>
In the past, the Chaotic Source World had always been friendly to some small races.
<br><br>
Even if they only wandered around the periphery of the Chaotic Source World, they could dig up a few Chaotic Source Spirits and receive the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.
<br><br>
But this time, all the Chaotic Source Spirits gathered at the main peak, and the cruel side of the game was revealed to everyone.
<br><br>
A Chaotic Source Spirit of that size was prey to a super force like the Oneness Sky Palace. Small races, however, weren't strong enough to kill it.
<br><br>
If they were not careful enough, they would quickly die.
<br><br>
"Let's go and kill it!" Elvinia exclaimed. She took the initiative and immediately flew over to the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were thrilled when they saw the Chaotic Source Spirit. The way they saw it, it was like about three thousand Chaotic Source Spirits were waving at them.
<br><br>
Zen's and Yan's figures flashed swiftly across the field as they too, charged towards the Chaotic Source Spirit.
<br><br>
Chaotic Source Spirits were tough and had powerful strength, but their speed was their biggest setback--and so, they couldn't resist attacks that came from various kinds of abilities.
<br><br>
If only they were inside the main peak, with the huge eye's help, then no one could probably defeat them. But now that the joint forces of all the warriors had destroyed the main peak and sealed off the giant eye, the Chaotic Source Spirits were far less frightening than they were before.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit roared and struggled continuously, but it couldn't hurt any Oneness Sky Palace disciple. It was like a powerful beast that was trapped and cornered to an invisible space by everyone, and the power of many crystals in its body was weakened little by little.
<br><br>
In a span of a minute, the Chaotic Source Spirit let out an ear-splitting roar, then its four limbs flailed in the air before it fell to the ground with a loud thud. Elvinia and Dorothy went forward first. They released two rays of sword radiance that sliced the Chaotic Source Spirit's abdomen, then all the crystals in its body flowed out.
<br><br>
Many of the large races had ganged up on those Chaotic Source Spirits that were about thirty feet tall. Therefore, each race had harvested and accumulated a great amount of crystals.
<br><br>
Despite that, the amount of the Chaotic Source Spirits was still limited after all. Once they couldn't find another one to kill, they all turned to look at the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was over ten thousand feet tall.
<br><br>
She was just like a mountain! It was not hard to imagine the number of crystals that were hidden inside her body.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before hundreds of warriors from the Separate Abyss race, Sun Crow race, Divine Farmer race, Snake Goddess race, and so on were all fighting with this mother.
<br><br>
The Sun Crows turned into golden flames and circled around the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. From time to time, golden sparks flashed on the mother's body.
<br><br>
Yet even though so many warriors surrounded and attacked the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, she didn't show any signs of fatigue. In fact, she was still ferocious as ever! After all, she had rested for many years and thus, her strength had grown into a terrifying level.
<br><br>
"All of you! Go to hell!"
<br><br>
Her eyes were full of hatred. How she wished she could swallow all these damn creatures! Although these creatures were weak and very small in size, they were cunning as mosquitoes as they flew around. The mother chased after them relentlessly, but the warriors flexibly dodged all of her attacks.
<br><br>
After Zen had led the Oneness Sky Palace disciples to kill two Chaotic Source Spirits in a row, he shifted his attention to the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Of course, they were determined to get a share of the crystals inside the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Just then, the dark smog in the sky loomed over them once more. "The hurricane is coming again?" Zen muttered, and his gaze froze.
<br><br>
Everyone else were also filled with dread when they saw the surging black smog.
<br><br>
No one knew where they would be blown to when the hurricane came.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was not afraid of the hurricane.
<br><br>
As for the warriors, they would definitely die if they hid underground.
<br><br>
Someone still kept a level head and shouted, "Hide in the arrays!"
<br><br>
Like a trail of disturbed ants, everyone scattered and scurried towards the arrays.
<br><br>
Chapter 3421 No Way Out The moment they stepped into the arrays, as if triggering a sensor, the runes carved in the ground glowed with golden light. As a result, a protective oval-shaped light barrier enveloped everyone to safeguard them.
<br><br>
The disciples from the various races had the right to walk in and out of the light barrier. However, everything in the Chaotic Source World that remained outside would be blocked from entering it. That included hurricanes and the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
When most people made their way safely inside the arrays, the hurricane in the Chaotic Source World rose once more with destructive intentions.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, some people had failed to seek refuge in the arrays in time to avoid the approaching calamity. As a result, they were carried away by the hurricane for tens of thousands of miles without pause.
<br><br>
Still, in an infuriated state, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits broke her way through the hurricane and advanced forward.
<br><br>
The plan of the giant eye was so ridiculous that it had cost the lives of almost all of her kind. It failed so horribly that she was the sole survivor among the members of her race.
<br><br>
The only thing on her mind now was to exact revenge by killing as many people as she saw fit.
<br><br>
But those people were like troublesome mice. As soon as the hurricane raged their way, they fled into the arrays to protect them against it.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits had little to no knowledge about the arrays.
<br><br>
Over the years, they had made numerous attempts to destroy them, but they were all for naught as the arrays were carved in the void.
<br><br>
Once the arrays were triggered to activate, the following light barrier that formed was able to withstand heavy amounts of force.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had also tried to tear down the light barrier, but it was unsuccessful every time.
<br><br>
However, the scenario had changed later. Over the past ten years, the mother had fused with many other Chaotic Source Spirits, and her strength had far surpassed her previous limitations.
<br><br>
With wide strides and the intentions to kill, she made her way towards the nearest array.
<br><br>
"The mother of Chaotic Source Spirits is coming!"
<br><br>
"She's headed our way!"
<br><br>
"Don't panic! These arrays are the work of powerful masters in the Source World. They are practically indestructible!"
<br><br>
The people stationed inside the array under threat were the members of the River Spirit race. They inhabited the area by the riverside. Similar to the Snake Goddess race, their body was a hybrid of a human and a snake.
<br><br>
However, they had scales for feet and tentacles on their faces; their bodies overflowed with energy.
<br><br>
The River Spirit race had high hopes attached to the array. They believed in it to be able to withstand heavy amounts of damage without a hitch.
<br><br>
When the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits reached the array that was closest to her, she stationed herself directly behind it. With anger fuming from every breath she took, she raised her strong foot and stomped hard on the array with malicious intents.
<br><br>
Watching this unfold, the members of the River Spirit race couldn't help but feel threatened by the massive strength fluctuating from it. They all gathered in one place, feeling frightened.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Even the rustling sound produced by the hurricane was insufficient to deafen out the loud noise of her foot trampling down on the array.
<br><br>
The light barrier visibly trembled and recovered in an instant.
<br><br>
"Nothing happened…"
<br><br>
"What a relief! She can't break the array after all!"
<br><br>
"I told you so!"
<br><br>
The once tensed members of the River Spirit race rejoiced as they regained their lost vitality.
<br><br>
Watching them ease up, the members of other races in other arrays relaxed their shoulders as if an overpowered burden was lifted off them. Their hearts that had leaped to their throats at the first sign of trouble sunk back down to their chests as they heaved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
If the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits were to be successful in her attempts to break the array, things would get complicated.
<br><br>
"It's alright now…"
<br><br>
"Let's use this opportunity to distribute the Chaotic Source Spirits among ourselves!"
<br><br>
After they had taken the lives of many Chaotic Source Spirits, every race had obtained a lot of crystals.
<br><br>
These crystals were sufficient for many people to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. Now with the hurricane raging outside, they had nothing to do while they waited inside the arrays. This was the perfect time to distribute the crystals.
<br><br>
Watching the others, the members of the Oneness Sky Palace turned towards Zen, Elvinia, and Dorothy with questioning eyes. All the Chaotic Source Spirits gathered by them were given to the three for safekeeping.
<br><br>
"We should also distribute the Chaotic Source Spirits right now," Elvinia said, withdrawing her gaze from afar.
<br><br>
"Okay," Zen said as he gave a slight nod. Just as he was about to take the Chaotic Source Spirits out of his space ring, he saw the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits raise her huge foot and stomp hard on the light barrier of the array again.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Another loud noise reverberated in everyone's ears, reaching distances far and wide.
<br><br>
The overwhelming sound diverted everyone's attention towards it once more.
<br><br>
Just like before, the light barrier shook involuntarily and later recovered.
<br><br>
However, this time, the rate at which it trembled was much more violent. It soon became apparent that the barrier would not be able to hold for long against attacks with the same viscosity.
<br><br>
When the sudden realization hit everyone, their inner emotions reflected on their faces as they lost their previous color and turned a pale white.
<br><br>
They all understood that the arrays which had remained indestructible over the years were perishable under brute force.
<br><br>
After the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits trampled on the array for a second time, she paused to recollect herself as she straightened up.
<br><br>
Suddenly, she jumped high into the sky, bearing the weight of her ten thousand feet high body, and came knocking down once more.
<br><br>
The members of the River Spirit race in the array had already fallen victim to hopelessness. Before the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits could touch the array, some of the members of the River Spirit race gave in to their fears and rushed out of the light barrier.
<br><br>
The hurricane outside still raged with pressure. Soon as the members came out of the barrier, they were swept off their feet into midair and were thrown away.
<br><br>
The members that remained inside the array felt hesitation in exiting the barrier. Although the River Spirit race was not a super force, it was respected around its territory. Therefore, high hopes were attached to it, and they were expected to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
However, they had managed to collect only a handful of Chaotic Source Spirits. Their last remaining resort was in the form of the mighty mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. After all, she must have absorbed tens of thousands of Chaotic Source Spirits to have progressed so far in strength.
<br><br>
Them being blown away by the hurricane would indicate their surrender in the fight for obtaining more Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Therefore, they could do nothing but pin their hopes on the array to live up to its potential and protect them.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits crash-landed on the array. The impact of the fall caused the extraordinary light barrier to collapse into insignificant pieces.
<br><br>
As if keeping track of her targets, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits landed directly on the bodies of the members of the River Spirit race.
<br><br>
Everything inside the array was soon squashed like a bug and reduced to nothing.
<br><br>
"I can't believe it… The array…is broken!"
<br><br>
"Damn it. We're all doomed!"
<br><br>
"What should we do now?"
<br><br>
Shocked after witnessing the tragic end of the River Spirit race members, the other people began to lose their sane minds and panicked.
<br><br>
The arrays were their shelter. But now, after one was brutally crushed before their eyes, they could not depend on the remaining arrays to save them anymore.
<br><br>
"Hahaha…"
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits broke out into malicious laughter.
<br><br>
"You all are so naive! Do you honestly believe those arrays could protect you from me!? I will show you what despair feels like!"
<br><br>
"Bang Bang Bang..."
<br><br>
With large steps, she paced towards the next array.
<br><br>
This array was occupied by members from small races.
<br><br>
As they witnessed the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits approach them, their faces turned as white as a sheet as they held their breaths.
<br><br>
They were smart enough to not repeat the same mistake the River Spirit race made. Before the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits could destroy the barrier, they had planned to move out of it.
<br><br>
Soon, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits ran for a few steps before she leaped in the air and landed directly on the array.
<br><br>
At the same time, the people inside the array rushed out before they were crushed.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
This light barrier also perished under the strength of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Fortunately, their quick thinking helped the members of the small races to avoid being stepped on by her.
<br><br>
However, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was sharp-witted. She had foreseen their intentions to escape the array. Once they stepped out, they would be carried away by the hurricane.
<br><br>
Adjusting to the circumstances, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits slapped her hand in the direction of the hurricane. The pressure of the hurricane had made it hard for the warriors to resist and move freely. With pitiful eyes and helpless bodies, they watched the huge palm cover them up and slam them hard on the ground.
<br><br>
"Bang Bang Bang..."
<br><br>
With a series of dull thuds, more than a dozen bloodied bodies fell lifelessly on the ground. The desolate ground was painted a wild red with their blood spraying over from all directions.
<br><br>
The traumatizing sight of these people made the survivors in the remaining arrays hyperventilate. They began to huddle up and discuss strategies to escape unscathed.
<br><br>
However, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was not prepared to allow them the luxury of time. She turned around frantically and rushed towards the third array.
<br><br>
Chapter 3422 Lure Away The moment they saw the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits rush over, all creatures in the third array began to scramble and scatter.
<br><br>
At that moment, all that mattered was leaving as fast as they could, or they would risk dying in that place.
<br><br>
All of them crowded the exit, trying to rush out of the array. They used their bodily movement skills to fly with the wind, all in a desperate attempt to run away from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
When the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits reached the magic array, she crushed the array with her body, making sure to destroy it completely.
<br><br>
Several large races were forced to calculate their current positions, trying to guess what the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits would do next.
<br><br>
The core area's arrays were arranged densely. When the hurricane rose, everyone found a random array where they stayed to protect themselves.
<br><br>
The Ear Mice, the Bearing race, and the Sun Crow race were among the lucky ones as they were in arrays that were quite far from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Nine Li people weren't as lucky.
<br><br>
However, within five minutes, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits could destroy all the arrays.
<br><br>
Everyone was on the edge. Even the leaders outside of the Chaotic Source World were growing restless.
<br><br>
"Why isn't the Pear Hill doing anything?"
<br><br>
"The arrays used to refine the Chaotic Source Spirits are ruined! This is too much!"
<br><br>
"If they stay there, they will all die!"
<br><br>
The leaders argued amongst themselves, despairing at the current state of their disciples while the Pear Hill kept silent. Making a move on the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was never in their plan.
<br><br>
In no time at all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth arrays were destroyed.
<br><br>
Having witnessed the unfortunate fate of the River Spirit race, the others were desperate to leave and find another safe hiding spot.
<br><br>
At the same time, the super forces in the rear became more anxious about their situation.
<br><br>
The arrays themselves weren't such a huge loss. The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits could destroy all of them.
<br><br>
What made them so nervous was the fact that they used the arrays as shelter.
<br><br>
It was extremely nerve-wracking, waiting for one's possible doom.
<br><br>
The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the people of the Nine Li race were desolate as they watched the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits approach their array.
<br><br>
"We'll have to withdraw!" Elvinia exclaimed, heart beating faster from the need to take action.
<br><br>
"Don't panic. She may not come for us," Chaim said with a hint of hope.
<br><br>
Earlier, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits flew into a rage and missed an array. Maybe they could also get lucky? Unfortunately, Chaim was wrong.
<br><br>
As the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits broke the thirteenth array, she began to rush straight towards the one they were in.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess race from Pear Hill was in a nearby array. Yan, who was inside the array, could only look at Zen with worry.
<br><br>
She knew there was nothing she could do to help.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! Dong! Violent vibrations shook the ground as the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits stamped in fury.
<br><br>
Not everyone felt as melancholic. The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were particularly feeling pleased as they watched the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits march towards the array.
<br><br>
"Look! The Oneness Sky Palace is doomed!"
<br><br>
"I hope the hurricane blows them away! When they're gone, the crystals in the mother's belly will be ours!"
<br><br>
"If the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace run away, so will the people of Pear Hill! There's a way to turn this situation to our advantage!"
<br><br>
The disciples of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and the Divine Farmer race discussed amongst themselves the benefits of this current situation.
<br><br>
Ismail, the eldest among the three brothers from the Divine Farmer race raised a very good question, "Is there any way to prevent them from leaving the array?" His voice was full of resentment as he made his declaration. "I hope they're trampled to death by the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits!"
<br><br>
Mount, taking a glance at Ismail, shook his head. "No. I don't think so."
<br><br>
There was no way to trap the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace in the array.
<br><br>
Dorothy watched as the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits approached.
<br><br>
"We have to go!" she announced solemnly.
<br><br>
"Hurry up then!" Hutton whined anxiously.
<br><br>
There was no other way! Just as everyone was preparing to rush out, Zen remained rooted in his spot.
<br><br>
"Wait a minute."
<br><br>
Chaim took a look at Zen and immediately guessed his plan. "Are you planning on luring her away?"
<br><br>
Amongst everyone gathered here in the core area, there was only one person who could dodge this abnormally horrible hurricane: Zen.
<br><br>
Perhaps it would also be possible for him to lure the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits away? "Yes," Zen replied.
<br><br>
"How?" Milo asked. Even Dorothy was confused, only gazing at Zen with questioning eyes.
<br><br>
She, and the vast majority of the Oneness Sky Palace disciples, had no idea that he could dodge the hurricane.
<br><br>
Zen was a source of order and leadership for everyone in that array. He had led them to victory during the earlier battle and they trusted in him fully.
<br><br>
They saw him as someone who could come up with solutions in the most critical moments.
<br><br>
However, what he was planning right now seemed like suicide! Could he really deal with this current dilemma they all faced? The other races watched with bated breath, anticipating what the Oneness Sky Palace was going to do. With their current situation, the most logical course of action was to rush out of the array as quickly as they could.
<br><br>
To everyone's disappointment, no disciples rushed out of the array.
<br><br>
The only person who did was Zen.
<br><br>
This scene shocked everybody.
<br><br>
"What are they doing?!"
<br><br>
"Are they trying to get themselves killed?"
<br><br>
"Maybe they aren't willing to give up? But what option do they have other than giving up? They're going to die. There's no other way out of this one.
<br><br>
Those fools will die in that array!"
<br><br>
While everyone mildly panicked about this turn of events, Zen had already passed the light curtain.
<br><br>
As soon as he crossed the threshold, a feather seemingly carved out of jade appeared above his head.
<br><br>
Phew! Everyone watched in amazement as Zen flew upward, unaffected by the hurricane at all, and rushed headfirst towards the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Meanwhile, the blade of his Snow Sword flashed sharply in his hand.
<br><br>
Crack! This sword radiance from his blade hit the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
It did not hurt the creature but it was very successful in diverting her attention.
<br><br>
Dong! Dong! There was a large quake as the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits turned from the array and towards Zen.
<br><br>
She was very, very confused.
<br><br>
To the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, all of them were pesky annoying ants unable to even withstand the force of the hurricane. How in the world was this ant able to travel freely? Not only that, he even dared to come at her with a sword? "Human ant!" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits boomed. "Go to hell!"
<br><br>
She turned around, swinging her two huge palms in order to slap Zen's head.
<br><br>
Zen, despite being regarded as a mere ant, was very nimble and could easily dodge the strike.
<br><br>
He was like a mosquito, flitting here and there in order to avoid this larger creature's slap. Wasting no time at all, Zen drew his sword and slashed at her head! Those watching below could only gasp in shock as they witnessed this scene.
<br><br>
Who would've ever guessed that Zen would employ this method in order to lure the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits away? Mount, Khalid, and Mya sported unprecedentedly solemn looks on their faces.
<br><br>
"Uncle Mount, how the hell did he make it?" Mya asked in disbelief and confusion.
<br><br>
Chapter 3423 Driving Them Away Under everyone's gaze, Zen seemed to glide as though his body was a piece of light paper.
<br><br>
While the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had great strength, she was too clumsy to capture even the creatures of small races, let alone Zen who moved that fast.
<br><br>
Dorothy's eyes flashed with satisfaction.
<br><br>
It was crucial for Zen to make such a move. The Oneness Sky Palace would probably lose their chance completely otherwise.
<br><br>
Even the leaders outside the Chaotic Source World were attracted by Zen's figure.
<br><br>
They never had been through such a strong hurricane and had no clue how terrifying it actually was.
<br><br>
But even the Divine Lair's demon women and the races that could fly well kept away from it—clearly, the hurricane was something no one wanted to get caught up in.
<br><br>
But Zen seemed so free in the winds. It should be because he relied on the jade-like feather. However, no one there knew where the feather had come from.
<br><br>
Whoosh! As Zen fought the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, a voice message with life vitality resounded in his ear—it was from Chaim.
<br><br>
"Zen, lead her to the Bearing race," he suggested.
<br><br>
The Bearing race, along with the three other major races, had exerted their strength in attacking the Oneness Sky Palace's disciples, including Milo.
<br><br>
Almost all the disciples that remained had been attacked by these four races. In spite of the great number of disciples they eliminated, they left no evidence behind.
<br><br>
It was the perfect opportunity to get their revenge—how could they just let it pass? "That's exactly what I was thinking!"
<br><br>
In the hurricane, Zen turned around and flew straight toward the members of the Bearing race.
<br><br>
They, along with the New Moon race, shared the same array, while the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race occupied one array each.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen heading toward them, Khalid and the rest understood his intent immediately.
<br><br>
He wanted to take advantage of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits to drive them away! "You brat! How dare you!"
<br><br>
"If you dare come any closer, I will kill you!"
<br><br>
"Do you want to die?"
<br><br>
The members of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race cursed at the sight of Zen's move.
<br><br>
Nearby, the Separate Abyss people were mocking them—they were pleased to see the others' distress.
<br><br>
In the face of the threats of the super forces, Zen's expression remained totally steady. He fell right into the array where the Bearing race stayed.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! As the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits ran at full speed, the ground trembled under her heavy steps. She followed closely behind Zen.
<br><br>
"You brat, get out of here!" Khalid's face was dark and cold like he was entirely ready to swallow Zen up at that moment.
<br><br>
The others of the Bearing race were also pointing fingers accusingly at Zen, cursing him.
<br><br>
But Zen merely stood there with his hands behind his back, looking totally indifferent. Wearing a faint smile on his face, he looked at them firmly.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for them, they had no way to fight in the array—they couldn't touch Zen.
<br><br>
Seeing how close the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was getting, Khalid called to the rest, "Guys, let's get out of here!"
<br><br>
Zen was deliberately leading the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits there.
<br><br>
The array would definitely be trampled to pieces by her heavy steps. To keep them safe, Khalid had to dismiss his clansmen.
<br><br>
Although the members of the Bearing race were reluctant, they had no other choice. All they could do was throw daggers at Zen with their hateful glares. After going through the light shield, all of them were blown away by the hurricane.
<br><br>
With a spear in hand, Khalid jumped into the air and moved out of the light shield.
<br><br>
The moment he was exposed, the long spear light flashed in his hand and pierced the ground.
<br><br>
Crack! A sharp beam of light shot out from the tip of his spear and penetrated the ground.
<br><br>
Among the disciples of the Bearing race under the Chaotic Source Realm, Khalid was the most powerful. While he was indeed proud and arrogant, he wasn't to be underestimated.
<br><br>
The beam of light was like an extension of his very arm. The moment it rushed to the ground, it split into two, then four, then eight—it seemed like a split tree root that extended infinitely into the ground.
<br><br>
In mere seconds, it had turned into thousands of beams of light fixed into the ground.
<br><br>
These were all connected to the tip of his spear, stabilizing his foundation.
<br><br>
"Impressive!"
<br><br>
"He can resist the hurricane?"
<br><br>
"Still… he's not as good as Zen…"
<br><br>
Although the hurricane was truly powerful, it wasn't impossible to avoid it.
<br><br>
Some people had special means to do so.
<br><br>
Khalid was extraordinary enough to have attracted everyone's attention.
<br><br>
But Zen's unwavering presence had stolen the limelight.
<br><br>
Completely unaffected by the hurricane, Zen proved to be more powerful than Khalid.
<br><br>
Boom! The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits took a step toward the array's light shield. But at that moment, only Zen remained in the array.
<br><br>
Before she stomped down, Zen moved out of the area. Simultaneously, his eyes met Khalid's before he revealed a sly smile.
<br><br>
Khalid's heart sank upon seeing Zen's smile.
<br><br>
He couldn't move as he could only fix himself with his spear. What was Zen planning to do? Halfway through that thought, Zen floated and headed toward him.
<br><br>
"Damn it!"
<br><br>
Khalid was a decisive character. The moment he withdrew his long spear, he turned over to shoot a spear light at Zen.
<br><br>
This move was mere revenge. He was well aware that it would miss Zen and that he'd be swept away by the hurricane anyway.
<br><br>
But once he was blown away about 20, 000 feet, he once again stabbed his spear into the ground. The spear light extended infinitely into the ground and fixed himself once again.
<br><br>
Zen didn't have any more time to mess with the guy. Once Khalid was far away, Zen continued guiding mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits to the next array.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen rush over, the faces of the demon women of the Sun Crow race darkened. They spread their wings and flew away along with the hurricane.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen's figure stopped midair as he looked to the left. Now, only the Divine Farmer race remained in the array.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and the Divine Farmer race all twisted their faces in anger.
<br><br>
They had curated an entire plan, even sending out the hit list in the hopes of killing Zen and Elvinia. But it was to no avail—they even suffered many losses because of Zen.
<br><br>
Elizabeth, in particular, was staring intently at Zen as though she was ready to swallow him alive.
<br><br>
In the array, Mount stood still. When he saw Zen fly over, he shut his eyes and steadily said, "All of you, get out."
<br><br>
The rest of the Divine Farmer race nodded before heading out of the array.
<br><br>
"Uncle Mount, what about me?" Mya took a seat to the side and asked.
<br><br>
"Just help me," Mount replied.
<br><br>
Mya's eyes glittered at that.
<br><br>
She knew that sooner or later, Mount would be fighting Zen and the man called Evil God.
<br><br>
Mount was a sedate man who often looked at the bigger picture. Before gaining the confidence to win, he first chose to dodge.
<br><br>
But now, he couldn't bear it.
<br><br>
"Okay!" With a mischievous smile, Mya caressed her curly locks and raised them up.
<br><br>
When Zen stepped out of the array with the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits following him, Mya's curly hair extended outside the array and transformed into thin, steel needles. They shot right at the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Chapter 3424 The Folded Space The curly strands of hair were like steel needles wrapping instantaneously around the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Previously, Mya had used such a method to entangle her.
<br><br>
The hair was extremely tough and unbreakable by force.
<br><br>
The mother didn't pay any bit of attention to Mya or Mount—her sole desire was to crush Zen.
<br><br>
"I'm done!"
<br><br>
As Mya's hair tied up the mother's body, some hair also wrapped around Mount's figure.
<br><br>
"Let's head out."
<br><br>
Carrying Mya on his shoulder, Mount then walked out of the light.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In an instant, the hurricane blew the two into the air.
<br><br>
Her hair straightened up under the force of the wind.
<br><br>
Strong inertia pushed them to circle the mother once before rushing directly to Zen.
<br><br>
As they approached him, a golden light flashed in Mount's eyes as a strong aura burst from his figure.
<br><br>
"Uha!"
<br><br>
A black spiral emerged above his head as he shouted.
<br><br>
"Dark Space World!"
<br><br>
As it spun, a strange gravitational force was formed from the motion.
<br><br>
While it wasn't a particularly powerful force, the rules within it began folding the surrounding space.
<br><br>
Any means related to space was prohibited within the Chaotic Source World. No one could make use of Grand Teleportation or any other spacerelated methods.
<br><br>
But Mount had violated this very rule.
<br><br>
Bang! All the space within a ten-foot radius of the black spiral collapsed into it.
<br><br>
The surrounding space was also quickly influenced as it got sucked in.
<br><br>
About a hundred feet away from the spiral, the space squeezed inward for ten feet, along with the entire core area. The whole Chaotic Source World seemed to shift ten feet with the black spiral in its center.
<br><br>
The entire Source World and chaos shifted along with it.
<br><br>
But ten feet was such a short distance that it could easily go unnoticed by both the Chaotic Source World and the Source World.
<br><br>
Within the entire Icy Snow Province, only Fuxi, sitting atop the snow mountain, noticed the newly folded space.
<br><br>
He stared at Mount with great contempt.
<br><br>
"He got serious too soon, didn't he? To use a truth-level trick to deal with a young warrior who hasn't even reached the Chaotic Source Realm… how shameful…" Fuxi muttered to himself.
<br><br>
Still, he had no intention of lending a hand.
<br><br>
In his eyes, it was fate.
<br><br>
If Zen died in the hands of Mount or the Evil God, that only proved how blind Gerald was.
<br><br>
He was unwilling to accept the fact that the mission he had begged for all his life fell upon such a man.
<br><br>
The sight of the black spiral put a dark cloud over the atmosphere at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World where the many leaders of different forces gathered.
<br><br>
"What is that trick?!" Elizabeth exclaimed, bewildered.
<br><br>
The Sun Crow race's talent lay in their divine flames, while the demon women of the Divine Lair were especially good at any trick that had to do with space. Elizabeth, for instance, had cultivated the Truth of Void Destruction to reach the Other Shore—something common among the demon women. It was why the Sun Crow race's strength had nearly no advantage in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Elizabeth could cast the Illusory Projection in far-away spaces to kill her enemies. She had an understanding and attainment in space that no ordinary warrior could dream of matching.
<br><br>
But upon seeing the black spiral, her heart skipped a beat.
<br><br>
Uncharacteristically, she couldn't understand the space mystery in the trick at all.
<br><br>
When the leader of the Divine Farmer race saw Mount's trick, his expression remained steady.
<br><br>
Mount was well known as a unique existence in the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
While he was a member of the younger generation, he held a special high status. Even the Divine Farmer was polite when facing him—it wasn't hard to guess just how powerful he was.
<br><br>
"Zen, watch out!"
<br><br>
Athemar, Winchell, and the other leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace had their eyes wide in shock.
<br><br>
Whenever they caught Zen in a tough situation, he had always been able to deal with all sorts of tricks easily.
<br><br>
But even Athemar couldn't comprehend Mount's move—the power hidden within it was difficult to gauge.
<br><br>
He couldn't wrap his head around how such a young man had mastered such a trick.
<br><br>
And so there Zen was, trapped within a ten-foot radius of the black spiral.
<br><br>
The mother's hand entered the folded space along with Zen.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Once the space folded, the part of the hand was torn into pieces.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mice, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, and the members of the various races all exclaimed upon witnessing the scene.
<br><br>
"Oh my God! How can this be?"
<br><br>
"The crystals inside the mother's body haven't been exhausted. How did her hand get torn apart like that? It's impossible!"
<br><br>
"This isn't natural…"
<br><br>
The crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits were supposed to be indestructible materials.
<br><br>
If one wanted to destroy a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm, they'd have to completely exhaust the Chaotic Source Spirits inside the warrior's body.
<br><br>
Before that, no attack would be the least bit effective on the warrior.
<br><br>
But the mother still seemed energetic—not tired in the least.
<br><br>
Before the crystals were used up, the mother's body should have been indestructible. Not even a drop of blood could be drawn.
<br><br>
But when the black spiral pulled in slightly, half of her hand was broken off —it was an intimidating sight to every being present.
<br><br>
In one of the arrays, a dark shadow stood behind a nonhuman creature.
<br><br>
Because the shadow was so close to the creature, it went unnoticed by anyone else in the array.
<br><br>
It was none other than the Evil God.
<br><br>
His eyes narrowed as he examined the black spiral.
<br><br>
Before that very moment, apart from Zen, no one in the Chaotic Source World was worth a second of his attention—not even Yan, Zen's sister.
<br><br>
Now, his expression hardened at the sight of Mount's move.
<br><br>
But that lasted only a moment before his serious eyes were replaced by a look of interest like he had just locked onto his next prey.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
It took a mere moment for the black spiral to fold the space.
<br><br>
It only spun for a few seconds until it disappeared. The black spiral, half of the mother's hand, and Zen had all disappeared without a trace, as though they had never existed.
<br><br>
"Aoo... Woo!"
<br><br>
The mother of Chaotic Source Spirits roared, covering the half of her hand that remained on her body. Never did she think anyone could ever hurt her.
<br><br>
In her pain, she shifted her anger toward Mount and Mya.
<br><br>
"Retreat,"
<br><br>
Mount spat out harshly.
<br><br>
The hair on Mya's head faintly glowed. Still tied to the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, it began extending rapidly.
<br><br>
From afar, it looked as though the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was flying a kite, with Mya's hair serving as the kite's thread. The two people on the other end of it flew higher and higher in the wind.
<br><br>
Chapter 3425 Deletion The strong hurricane beat against Mount and Maya harshly, but they continued to fly high.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits attempted to pull the two down, but every time she pulled Mya's hair, her hair grew even longer.
<br><br>
Therefore, it was impossible for the mother to exert any more strength, and naturally she couldn't pull the two down.
<br><br>
"Hoo, hoo, Hoo..."
<br><br>
"Uncle Mount, is that guy dead?" Mya asked curiously in the hurricane.
<br><br>
"Theoretically, he is dead," Mount answered flatly.
<br><br>
Mya was a bit confused. "Theoretically? What do you mean?"
<br><br>
"When that part of the space was folded, I exiled him," Mount replied.
<br><br>
Mya pursed her lips and asked again, "It's not difficult to exile someone in the space, and such a method is not fatal, right? Can you kill him?"
<br><br>
Overall, the space in the Source World was stable--the True Gods who cultivated the Space Godly Way could not tear the space apart, and it was also hard for them to exile their opponents. On the other hand, it was easy for the Other Shore Realm warriors who cultivated the Truth of Void Destruction to do the same thing.
<br><br>
Such powerful warriors were also not afraid of being banished from the space. As long as they released enough strength, they could easily destroy the space that imprisoned them and get out of it.
<br><br>
"That's not what I meant," Mount explained patiently. "After I folded the space, it completely disappeared. In fact, that area with the radius of ten feet has been removed entirely from the chaos. Do you understand?"
<br><br>
After a normal space theurgy had torn a part of a space apart, there was still a void left in the space, and the space itself did not disappear.
<br><br>
Besides, the space had a high ductility. It would not take long for the surrounding space to squeeze into the void, and then the space would be repaired gradually.
<br><br>
Sometimes the space was just like water, as it flowed without a stop.
<br><br>
This time, however, Mount directly deleted a piece of space which involved very complicated rules. It was truly difficult for Mya to understand such a matter.
<br><br>
"I don't understand," said Mya with a shrug. As she was still confused, she asked, "He won't come back, right?"
<br><br>
"It's hard to say," Mount responded.
<br><br>
Once again, Mya was speechless in confusion. Of course, she knew how powerful Mount was.
<br><br>
He could kill any opponent in one attack.
<br><br>
The moment Mount chose to launch an attack in the array, Mya knew that Zen was doomed.
<br><br>
Although it looked like that was the case, Mount still said that he wasn't so sure of it. Thus, his words made Mya feel a little puzzled.
<br><br>
"He is not an ordinary person," said Mount.
<br><br>
'Of course I know that, ' Mya thought to herself. Generally, Mount didn't need to attack those ordinary people in person because it was easy to deal with them, who were like Khalid.
<br><br>
"He used the Falling Star Palm," Mount continued to explain. "It's a theurgy of the truth level. Although it's very weak, it's genuine. Zen is the inheritor recognized by Gerald."
<br><br>
"Who is Gerald?" Mya blinked. "A Chaos Ancient God," Mount replied.
<br><br>
Mya's eyebrows shot up in surprise upon hearing those words.
<br><br>
"It's not easy to kill such a person," Mount stated.
<br><br>
He was positively confident in his abilities.
<br><br>
In theory, Zen had already disappeared, but he still refused to tell the others that he had died.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace looked very anxious.
<br><br>
"What happened to Zen? I can't even sense his soul mark!" Elvinia said with a frown. "Perhaps they exiled Zen through the space theurgy," Dorothy guessed.
<br><br>
Dorothy didn't expect that Mount possessed such a unique and remarkable ability.
<br><br>
Even though she was also worried, she was much calmer than Elvinia.
<br><br>
"No, that's not a common way to exile someone!" Chaim said and firmly shook his head. It was forbidden to use any space theurgy in the Chaotic Source World. Thus, anyone who was able to break this restriction must be truly powerful.
<br><br>
Since Chaim was not very experienced, he naturally didn't know anything about the space folding. Still, he could make his own guess.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Sally had an ominous premonition that she couldn't stop thinking about. "Then, does that mean that Zen is..." she trailed off with tears in her eyes.
<br><br>
"Sally, don't worry. Let's wait and see. Zen is very extraordinary. He will clearly have a way to return," Hutton consoled her.
<br><br>
The members of the Nine Li race looked up to Zen as their only hope.
<br><br>
Obviously, they didn't want him to be in danger or worse, die.
<br><br>
It was true that Hutton was not as well-informed as the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace, but he was certain that Zen would definitely come back! In the other array, Yan stood under the light barrier, her dark brown eyes filled with complex emotions. Worry, sadness, and anger mixed together, filling her mind and heart.
<br><br>
"Yan... Your brother will be fine," Natalie comforted her.
<br><br>
Yan had always been a very optimistic girl in the Pear Hill. It was the first time Natalie had seen her look this miserable.
<br><br>
"I hope..." Yan whispered. The exploration of the Chaotic Source World had been carried out in accordance with the plan.
<br><br>
In Yan's eyes, the only possible accident that could happen was involved with the Evil God.
<br><br>
Therefore, she had been on her guard against him.
<br><br>
It was difficult for others to notice the Evil God's presence, but Yan could always vaguely feel his position.
<br><br>
Despite her precautions, the unexpected thing had happened. The strapping young man of the Divine Farmer race had always been low-key, but after he took action, Zen had disappeared. It was hard for Yan to accept the fact for the time being...
<br><br>
What made Yan even more worried was the terrible destructive power of the folded space.
<br><br>
During the process of folding space, that young man even cut off half the hand of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits! Was that an ordinary space theurgy? "Phew!"
<br><br>
Five minutes had passed.
<br><br>
Soon enough, the hurricane of the Chaotic Source World slowly stopped.
<br><br>
Thick hair that measured hundreds of thousands of feet long, emitted a faint glow and curled around the mother.
<br><br>
Mya and Mount slowly descended from the dim sky.
<br><br>
At that moment, all of warriors in the core area rushed out of the arrays at once.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was the last treasure for them to fight for.
<br><br>
If they were in single combat, no one in the core area could defeat the mother, and it would be harder to consume the amber-colored crystals in her body.
<br><br>
Yet, that could change if they attacked her together.
<br><br>
Some of them could grab a hold of the mother and restrict her flexibility, some could hinder her speed, and some could weaken her strength. Those numerous methods when combined together made the mother not so terrifying anymore.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Khalid took out his long spear as well and charged straight towards the mother.
<br><br>
Although Mount had made Zen disappear, there were still many competitors for him. The Ear Mouse race, the Separate Abyss race, and the other super forces were formidable opponents as well.
<br><br>
The worst thing was the fact that the hurricane had swept away all the members of the Bearing race. It would take them a long time to come back from tens of thousands of miles away.
<br><br>
Just as Khalid was rushing towards the mother, a petite figure blocked his way.
<br><br>
It was Yan. Her long hair fluttered in the wind and a layer of crimson energy floated around her black locks. Her small face was devoid of any emotion.
<br><br>
"Hey, little girl..." Khalid mocked. He did not take Yan seriously at all.
<br><br>
The moment he finished speaking, however, Yan shouted angrily, "Scram!"
<br><br>
The word was like a hammer that pounded hard on Khalid's chest.
<br><br>
The impact sent Khalid flying tens of thousands of feet away, until he fell heavily on the ground and coughed up blood.
<br><br>
Chapter 3426 Be Prepared To Die The Pear Hill was a formidable group, and no one ever underestimated them. Yet it still shocked many when Yan was able to blow Khalid away in a single move.
<br><br>
After all, Khalid was the best talent of the Bearing race. Perhaps he had been careless because he underestimated Yan. But it was still difficult to comprehend how easily she had overpowered him.
<br><br>
Yan didn't miss a beat. Immediately after repelling Khalid, she flipped and shot up into the air, heading in the direction where Mya and Mount had landed.
<br><br>
"What a woman..."
<br><br>
A wicked smile formed on Mya's face. Her curly hair seemed to expand, framing her face like a dark cloud as it enveloped Yan.
<br><br>
Her beautiful curls looked soft and glossy, but they contained a terrible killing intent.
<br><br>
Once Yan got entangled in her curls, she would have at least a hundred ways to tear Yan into pieces.
<br><br>
Yan, however, had no fear in her expression as she confronted Mya's black cloud of hair. She counterattacked boldly and directly.
<br><br>
"The Truth of Holy Words!"
<br><br>
"Break!"
<br><br>
"Split!"
<br><br>
"Slash!"
<br><br>
As soon as Yan uttered the word "break," Mya's hair was cut into pieces flying haphazardly in all directions.
<br><br>
Would it be this easy to break Mya's hair? With a flash in mind, Mya seemed to infuse her broken hairs with a kind of spirit. They began flying back towards each other, forming another cloudlike mass. They were about to return to Mya when Yan said, "Split!" Her command shattered the spirit animating the hairs, and the broken strands fell apart, no longer connected.
<br><br>
When Yan spoke the word "slash", Mya began to tremble with fear. She could feel a sharp slashing force coming from the void. If it hit her, she would be killed undoubtedly.
<br><br>
Before the blow landed, she felt someone grab her and jerk her backwards.
<br><br>
It was Mount. "You're no match for her. Let me help you," he said.
<br><br>
Mount quickly stood in front of Mya as the invisible slashing force slashed at him.
<br><br>
Mount stayed calm. He stood still, his body glowing with a ray of khaki light, as he punched the air at a strange angle.
<br><br>
Boom! When Yan heard the booming sound, she realized that her "slash" command had failed. Mount had easily fended off the slashing attack.
<br><br>
"You're no match for me. Don't waste your time," Mount said, looking down at Yan.
<br><br>
In the Chaotic Source World, the struggles were fierce between various races, but almost everyone made an effort to avoid facing Mount.
<br><br>
But after all, the Chaotic Source World was created by the Snake Goddess race. If they went too far in bullying those from the Pear Hill, they might not get a good result after leaving the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Mount was insightful, and he had a way of perceiving things that other people couldn't. He saw at a glance that Yan was unusual.
<br><br>
If he killed Yan here, he would probably cause some unnecessary trouble.
<br><br>
Mya, who was still being shielded by Mount, stepped forward again, her face filled with hatred.
<br><br>
It was hard for most women to accept defeat at the hands of a more beautiful woman. And Mya was no exception. "Uncle Mount, she attacked me. Kill her!"
<br><br>
Mya was expecting Mount to agree, so she was surprised when he shook his head. "I can't kill her. If I try, members of the Pear Hill will definitely break into the Chaotic Source World to stop me."
<br><br>
"Will the Pear Hill break the rules for her?" Mya said coldly, still looking for a way to get revenge on Yan.
<br><br>
"They wouldn't break the rules for just anyone in the past. But for her, and at this moment in time, I feel that they will," Mount said firmly.
<br><br>
Since the Chaotic Source World had been established, the Pear Hill and other races in the Source World had always followed the rules that had been agreed upon. This established consensus was the foundation for the stability of the Chaotic Source World, and the reason it had lasted for so many years.
<br><br>
However, it was the last time that the Chaotic Source World would ever open. It no longer mattered if the Pear Hill broke the rules.
<br><br>
Mount thought his logic was unassailable.
<br><br>
He sought to obtain the maximum benefit that he could from his time in the Chaotic Source World. He wouldn't be as emotional as Khalid and Mya.
<br><br>
Mount's words made Yan even more determined, and she stood her ground.
<br><br>
"Let my brother go or I won't give up!" she said in a low growl.
<br><br>
Suddenly, there were sounds of people flying swiftly through the air.
<br><br>
Dozens of figures rushed towards them.
<br><br>
Natalie and Six Snake Shadows circled vigilantly around Yan. The other members of the Snake Goddess race hovered near Mount, carefully watching him. He was very powerful, but he wouldn't be able to withstand their united attack by himself.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! The sight of the members of the Snake Goddess race spurred the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace into action. They rushed to confront Mount too.
<br><br>
Although Elvinia and Dorothy knew that it would be difficult to force Mount to release Zen, they had to give it a try. Moreover, people from the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race and the Divine Farmer race had all been swept away by the hurricane. Only Mount, Mya, and Khalid who had been injured were here. They might have a chance to beat these three people, as they were greater in number.
<br><br>
"The Oneness Sky Palace won't shrink back," said Elvinia grimly, a determined look in her eyes.
<br><br>
As they squared off against each other, the atmosphere grew thick with tension.
<br><br>
Below, the Separate Abyss race and the Ear Mouse race were leading the other races in an attack against the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race was the happiest with this situation. The Oneness Sky Palace, the Pear Hill, the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and the Divine Farmer race were all competing for the Chaotic Source Spirits. But because of Zen, before they could even try to get to the crystals, they had to fight each other first.
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race were quick to take the opportunity to kill the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. If they succeeded, they would be the greatest beneficiaries of the ongoing conflict.
<br><br>
In fact, the Ear Mice were also very concerned about Zen. However, they and Zen were merely taking advantage of each other, so they did not feel that this was a battle they needed to be involved in.
<br><br>
The Evil God stood in the shadow of a huge crater on the ground.
<br><br>
"Are they going to fight? Interesting...!" The Evil God couldn't contain his excitement, and his desire to join the fray was evident on his gleeful face.
<br><br>
His own instincts told him that Mount was overwhelmingly powerful. He thought not even the combined forces of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill could defeat this man.
<br><br>
The Evil God was not sure how he himself would fare against Mount.
<br><br>
But he had been hiding in the dark for a long period of time. If he seized this opportunity, he might have a chance...
<br><br>
Mount looked around at the assembled warriors. He shook his head and said to Yan, "It's not that I don't want to let him go. It's just that—well, he has completely disappeared."
<br><br>
Yan heard only his refusal. "So you won't release Zen?" she asked, squinting. A ray of dangerous light shone from her eyes.
<br><br>
Mount pressed his lips together. "As I said, I can't release him because he's gone."
<br><br>
"Since you can't release him, you'd better be prepared to die," said Elvinia icily, her cold nature on full display. If Mount was telling the truth, and Zen was gone, it would be something she was not prepared to accept.
<br><br>
Auras burst out all around Mount as the others released their energy. Many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace as well as members of the Snake Goddess race activated their Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
The negotiation had failed, and it was time to go into battle.
<br><br>
Mount had an impenetrable poker face, and his expression did not change as everyone around him prepared to attack. He looked around coolly at the people surrounding him. "If you attack me, then you will die. It's really very simple. I will kill everyone except her," he said, pointing a finger at Yan.
<br><br>
His words sounded like a warning, but there was a hidden message embedded in them The message was not intended for the warriors surrounding him in the Chaotic Source World, nor was it for the leaders waiting outside. Instead, it was for Fuxi.
<br><br>
Chapter 3427 Formidable Opponent Fuxi, standing atop a snow mountain, only snorted when he heard Mount's words.
<br><br>
He had no plans to take action.
<br><br>
He didn't even make a move when Zen, who Fuxi held in great importance, had been sealed by Mount. It would have been too late, anyway.
<br><br>
But if Mount were to attack Yan, Fuxi would surely charge into the Chaotic Source World to rescue her without hesitation.
<br><br>
Even Mount, who had spent all this time in the Chaotic Source World, could tell as much.
<br><br>
"Oh, cut the crap!"
<br><br>
As a successor of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and one of the best warriors of the Phoenix Palace, Elvinia remained unfazed.
<br><br>
A dangerous golden light flashed in her eyes.
<br><br>
Divine flames of the Sun Crow race burst out from her hair, while the Warrior of the Stone Hill emerged above her. Tens of thousands of rays of sword radiance shot toward Mount, leaving no place for him to dodge.
<br><br>
At the same time, Yan stretched out her hands and a crimson energy began to spread around her. The shadow of Snake Goddess appeared behind her, growing quickly in size.
<br><br>
Chaim, Milo, Dorothy and Sally all launched their attacks at the same moment! "Stay back, Mya!" Mount shouted.
<br><br>
Mya, however, was finding it fun tagging along with her Uncle Mount.
<br><br>
She didn't want to miss out on anything at all.
<br><br>
She could tell he was being serious, however. It was obvious he was unsure whether he could defeat these enemies from the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill. He had asked her to leave to spare her from danger before he went all out in this fight.
<br><br>
"I won't..."
<br><br>
Before Mya could finish protesting, she suddenly felt dizzy. Before she knew it, she was already on a mountain top.
<br><br>
She looked around and soon realized that she was on the northern peak of the core area.
<br><br>
She hadn't even sensed the aura of the space theurgy her uncle used to send her away! She stomped angrily before flying toward the main peak.
<br><br>
Once Mya was safely out of the way, Mount wasted no time. He pushed his hands forward and with one hop, disappeared from everyone's sight.
<br><br>
The next moment, he was behind Yan. He made a quick motion with his hands.
<br><br>
A huge cube, measuring thirty feet on each side, quickly materialized out of thin air. Mount had apparently estimated Yan's shadow of Snake Goddess accurately, because the cube perfectly matched its current size.
<br><br>
The cube was an isolated space cage. And right now, it had Yan and her shadow of Snake Goddess trapped.
<br><br>
"Break!"
<br><br>
Yan shouted, her eyes twinkling with a strange color.
<br><br>
Ordinary enchanted barriers and space cages couldn't restrict her freedom.
<br><br>
But the cube remained motionless and was completely unaffected by the power she released.
<br><br>
Yan refused to give up.
<br><br>
Under her command, the shadow of Snake Goddess, which had now stopped growing, smashed at the cube again and again. These efforts were futile, however. None of the attacks managed to damage the space cage.
<br><br>
After trapping Yan successfully, Mount turned to his other enemies with a smug smile. "You insisted on fighting me, so I decided not to disappoint you."
<br><br>
His clothes suddenly began to quiver. Then they ripped apart, revealing his bronzed torso.
<br><br>
"Six Origin Phantoms!"
<br><br>
With a loud shout, two figures suddenly charged toward Mount. This turned out to be Dorothy and her clone.
<br><br>
Dorothy had analyzed the situation more rationally than Elvinia had.
<br><br>
She knew there was no deep feud between Zen and Mount. Mount might return Zen to them if they could just negotiate.
<br><br>
Of course, Mount already said he wouldn't do that.
<br><br>
But Dorothy didn't fully believe him. She decided to get him under control first.
<br><br>
As Dorothy and her clone brushed past each other on the path, they both split up further, creating two more clones. Then this new duo created another pair of clones.
<br><br>
Now six figures, including Dorothy herself, circled Mount at an incredible speed, forming a mysterious pattern in their path.
<br><br>
With Dorothy's current strength, it was rather difficult for her to use this skill.
<br><br>
It would cause her harm to forcibly perform this skill. If her grandmother were there, she would have stopped her from doing this.
<br><br>
Mount stood motionless as he was surrounded by the phantoms. Then he suddenly stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
With a snap, he deftly caught one of the clones.
<br><br>
The others quickly moved into action, raising their swords and slashing at Mount.
<br><br>
But none hit the target.
<br><br>
In a flash, Mount was outside the circle. He pinched the neck of the clone he caught, easily breaking it.
<br><br>
Buzz! The clone dissipated like melting ice and quickly turned into a flower. It was Dorothy's Other Shore Token, the Twin Blossoms.
<br><br>
The other five phantoms promptly merged together until only the real Dorothy was left.
<br><br>
Dorothy's face turned pale. The destruction of the clone caused considerable damage to her as well.
<br><br>
If Mount had caught her real body, she would have been killed! As she stood there paralyzed by fear, Mount threatened her in a steady voice, "I will crush your real neck next time!"
<br><br>
Whoosh! Swoosh! Now it was Chaim and Milo attacking Mount, coming in from his left and right, respectively.
<br><br>
Milo owed Zen a great favor, dating back from their days in the Flow Sword Sect. He could not just stand by and watch when Zen needed help.
<br><br>
Chaim raised his sword and drew a strange trail in the air, then bore down on Mount's face.
<br><br>
His posture was quite strange. It was almost impossible for him to hit Mount with the move he was making. However, halfway through the slash, he suddenly turned around and jutted his sword backward.
<br><br>
At the same time, Milo, who was beside him, suddenly leapt up in the air and slashed his sword down! "Heart Stab!"
<br><br>
Both of their attacks seemed off. It looked less like they were fighting an enemy and more like they were casually training.
<br><br>
But Mount reacted in perfect coordination with their movements. He changed his position and reappeared beneath Milo's sword.
<br><br>
Milo's sword attack was a unique skill of the Flow Strike. Although it was not very powerful, it could cause the opponent to feel like he was in real trouble.
<br><br>
Mount's moving theurgy was great, but his soul was at the same level as those at the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. In the face of the Heart Stab, he was alarmed and was forced to use spatial transference once again.
<br><br>
This time, he appeared behind Chaim, who abruptly stabbed his sword backward and hit Mount precisely! Click! Unexpectedly, the stab was so weak it could not even pierce Mount's skin.
<br><br>
But after landing the hit, Chaim retreated quickly but calmly, distancing himself from Mount. Milo followed suit and fell back.
<br><br>
It was known that all space theurgies were rendered useless in the Chaotic Source World, but Mount was able to violate this rule.
<br><br>
Knowing this, Chaim and Milo estimated that even if all of them took Mount on at the same time, there was a chance they still wouldn't be able to defeat him.
<br><br>
This was why they had not been in a hurry to attack.
<br><br>
As it turned out, while Dorothy and Elvinia had been fighting Mount, Chaim and Milo were trying to come up with a solution.
<br><br>
Chapter 3428 The Gold Abacus Chaim had told Milo that there was only one way to defeat Mount, and that was to stab the latter with his sword.
<br><br>
However, it was extremely difficult to do so since Mount constantly performed the Grand Teleportation technique.
<br><br>
Despite that, Milo immediately decided that he would handle this matter.
<br><br>
After all, no one else had a better understanding of the Flow Strike than Milo did.
<br><br>
The very second he launched the attack against Mount, he quickly entered the flow state and was always on guard for Mount's possible attacks.
<br><br>
Yet, such a prediction was not completely accurate. After all, Milo was not Mount himself, so he could not know what his opponent was thinking.
<br><br>
Still, it could bring guidance to him and pressure to the opponent's thoughts.
<br><br>
Chaim launched an attack before Milo did; then Chaim attacked Mount again. Milo's prediction changed three times before he directed Chaim to stab Mount in the chest.
<br><br>
But Milo was disappointed at the power of his attack.
<br><br>
If it was Milo who had stabbed Mount, Mount's skin would have been cut, even if the sword had not pierced his body.
<br><br>
On the contrary, Chaim's strike was just like a tickle! In addition, his proud expression confused Milo. "What are you happy about? Is your sword poisoned? He didn't even bleed...so even if there is poison in your sword, it is useless, isn't it?" Milo berated.
<br><br>
In turn, Chaim simply pointed to Mount in the distance and said, "Look!"
<br><br>
A speck of golden light appeared beside Mount, which soon turned into a gold abacus.
<br><br>
"What the hell is that?" Milo asked in bewilderment. There were millions of mortals, but the immortal-like disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace weren't one of them.
<br><br>
It was normal that Milo had not seen abacuses before.
<br><br>
"It's just an abacus," answered Chaim with a quick glance at Milo, and thought that the latter was a little ignorant.
<br><br>
"An abacus... What does it do?" Milo asked. He was still confused.
<br><br>
It wasn't only him, however. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, and the members of the Snake Goddess race who surrounded Mount, all stared at the shiny object with perplexed looks.
<br><br>
Even Mount was observing the small thing.
<br><br>
Then, he stretched out one of his fingers and flicked the gold abacus.
<br><br>
"Clap!"
<br><br>
That small, random flick's power was extremely terrifying! The gold abacus immediately turned into gold powder, and dissipated in front of him.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the powder turned into a new abacus in the blink of an eye! "It's indestructible?" Mount's eyebrows shot up in surprise. He pointed at it and asked, "What's this?"
<br><br>
He knew nearly everything, but even he could not see through where the abacus had originated, which indicated how precious it was.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Chaim remained vigilant but silent while Milo, who stood not far from him, seemed rather nervous.
<br><br>
"Answer me," Mount commanded.
<br><br>
As Chaim stayed quiet, Mount's body quivered slightly, and then disappeared.
<br><br>
"Chaim! Watch your back!" Milo shouted.
<br><br>
Chaim heard the warning and he immediately rushed forward. Then, Mount strangely popped out from his back. A thick yellow light flashed across his body while he punched his way out.
<br><br>
It was clear that Mount had restrained the power of his punch by a lot, but everyone was sure that it was far greater than 1, 000 divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
But because Milo had warned Chaim in time, he was able to avoid the punch.
<br><br>
Mount silently glanced at Milo. Chaim had caught where he was in two rounds, and he thought that it was because of Milo.
<br><br>
Milo could capture a person's subconscious reaction and strategy by relying on his flow state. However, when Mount began to be alert and didn't follow the subconscious reaction, the flow state naturally didn't work.
<br><br>
Just as Mount's body was about to disappear in a flash again, Milo warned Chaim once more and yelled, "Chaim! Mind your top!"
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Chaim pressed his body down vertically, but Mount, who had slowly disappeared, did not use the Grand Teleportation technique.
<br><br>
Instead, he turned into a sharp arrow that shot towards Chaim.
<br><br>
There was a dull force that was hidden in Mount. It had no momentum, but it killed or injured anyone that it hit.
<br><br>
Chaim's pupils suddenly dilated. At the same time, he struck the sword with almost all his strength, and then twisted his body to retreat.
<br><br>
Even with his maneuver, Milo's wrong judgment had already lost him the opportunity to escape.
<br><br>
Mount stretched out his finger and gently snapped on Chaim's long sword.
<br><br>
There was a metallic clang and the sword broke into countless pieces, before he literally punched Chaim.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
When the deadly punch came at Chaim, the Latent Theurgy above his head suddenly shattered, and a snow-white mirror appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
The mirror showed a clear reflection of Mount, and that mirrored image charged at the real Mount outside the mirror.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The two fists crashed into each other and shattered the mirror's surface.
<br><br>
Chaim was not hurt in the slightest, while Mount was thrown backward after he hit the Mount reflection in the mirror.
<br><br>
"Emerald Light Mirror!"
<br><br>
Chaim's Latent Theurgy was bestowed upon him by the head of Bright Mountain. At that critical moment, it saved his life.
<br><br>
As Mount failed to hit his target, he quickly turned around and prepared to strike Chaim again. Just then, the gold abacus that had followed him sent out a series of noises.
<br><br>
The beads of the abacus moved up and down, as if an invisible hand had fiddled with them. Eventually the beads stopped, and revealed a number.
<br><br>
"2, 400 divine megatons of force..."
<br><br>
Chaim's face instantly paled after he read the number on the abacus.
<br><br>
The power that Mount had randomly released surpassed 1, 000 divine megatons of force. He was truly much stronger than an ordinary warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
'His body is tough as a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm. If the Emerald Light Mirror had not blocked his attack, I might have died already!' Chaim thought with lingering fear.
<br><br>
Now, Mount also looked at the gold abacus beside him and quickly read the number on it. "2, 400 divine megatons of force…the function of this abacus is more than just counting, isn't it?"
<br><br>
"Of course not. Your first attack has reached your limit, and your next attack will have only half the power of the previous one," Chaim calmly explained. He had relied on the Latent Theurgy to avoid his opponent's deadliest blow. Now that his gold abacus had already started to work, he was no longer that afraid of Mount.
<br><br>
While Mount stared at the numbers on the abacus, he asked, "So, you mean that I can only exert 1, 200 divine megatons of force for my next attack?"
<br><br>
"Yes," said Chaim with a nod.
<br><br>
The moment he nodded his head, Mount appeared in front of him and was about to throw a punch to his face.
<br><br>
This time, Mount was so fast that Milo had no time to alert Chaim. Without any warning, Chaim reflexively raised his hands to resist the punch.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
How could Chaim's body resist Mount's attack? The bones in his arms and his chest broke into pieces at once. Blood gushed out from his mouth, and then he fell from the sky.
<br><br>
"It really was only half as powerful as the last punch." Mount looked at his fist and muttered.
<br><br>
"Crack, crack, crack..."
<br><br>
At that moment, the beads of the abacus beside him began to move again.
<br><br>
Chapter 3429 A Black Figure The abacus's beads moved up and down for a while until they settled down and showed the number, one thousand and two hundred.
<br><br>
When Mount saw it, he knew it meant he could only exert six hundred divine megatons of force in the next attack.
<br><br>
Such an amount of force was no longer powerful enough to defeat the talents of the young generation.
<br><br>
Most of these people who stayed in the core area could easily exert a thousand divine megatons of force. Some Other Shore Tokens of the descending type could even exert more than that amount of power.
<br><br>
As Mount mulled this development over, Chaim, seriously injured, collapsed to the ground, blood gurgling out of his mouth.
<br><br>
When the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace saw this, they all descended from the sky and surrounded him protectively.
<br><br>
"Chaim, are you okay?" Sally walked to Chaim's side and helped him to stand up.
<br><br>
Elvinia took out a golden pill, pushed it into Chaim's mouth and pronounced with certainty, "He won't die."
<br><br>
After swallowing the pill with great difficulty, Chaim glanced up at Mount in the sky. "You can attack him now. His strength has been greatly reduced.
<br><br>
His next attack will have only six hundred divine megatons of force, and his fourth attack will be further reduced by half," he told his companions.
<br><br>
Chaim had merged with two Other Shore Tokens. Previously, he had used the Living Puppet Chains several times to transform himself into the puppet of the first Other Shore Token. It allowed his strength to increase exponentially in a short period of time, but the side effect was quite serious.
<br><br>
The second Other Shore Token was the golden abacus.
<br><br>
The origin of the abacus was very bizarre. Chaim once had an adventure in a temple on Stage Nine. Inside the temple, he even found a human! This human was not in the form of the Soul of Light, but existed as a creature of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chaim had never heard of human beings living on the Other Shore, so he found it strange.
<br><br>
At the time, the human had been captured by a golden line and would have died from it, had Chaim not undone the hexes in the temple, releasing him.
<br><br>
Chaim simply did so because he was saving someone of his kind.
<br><br>
The human being had been deeply grateful to Chaim. Before he left, he gave Chaim the Other Shore Token, a golden abacus.
<br><br>
At first, he paid the Other Shore Token no mind. His goal was to step into the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm, and his focus was on exploring the temples just to find the soul crystal.
<br><br>
But he soon found the Other Shore Token could be integrated and released at will. Only after he had fused and merged the golden abacus into his body did Chaim discover its use.
<br><br>
The abacus didn't give Chaim strength, but it affected his enemy.
<br><br>
It was not difficult to trigger it. Chaim just needed to land a blow on his opponent.
<br><br>
That was why right from the start, Chaim had asked Milo to help him make sure that he could hit Mount.
<br><br>
Once contact was made, the abacus would land beside the target. Once it showed up, it couldn't be destroyed. It had a completely opposite effect compared to an ordinary Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
Most of the tokens could amplify their owners' Other Shore Power. The golden abacus, however, determined the enemy's strength.
<br><br>
The power of the blow from Mount reached more than two thousand divine megatons and would have been fatal were it not blocked by Chaim's Latent Theurgy.
<br><br>
The abacus used this hit to confirm Mount's strength.
<br><br>
Once it did that, the golden abacus countered the enemy's Other Shore Power, such that no matter how much power Mount released henceforth, the abacus would nullify it, allowing only half the strength of his previous blow.
<br><br>
The power of every blow Mount launched from here on out would be halved every time until it zeroed out.
<br><br>
"But be careful. His real skill is not just his power..." Chaim warned, finding it difficult to speak with his injuries.
<br><br>
Dorothy nodded, comprehending instantly.
<br><br>
The power of Mount was secondary. The key point was that he could use the space theurgy at will, which was a great advantage.
<br><br>
"I... I will take you to the array..." Sally said as she picked up Chaim.
<br><br>
Although the array couldn't block the attack of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, the mother was entangled by the people from the Separate Abyss race, so the threat shouldn't be too great.
<br><br>
Mount still hovered in the air. He was lost in thought as he looked at the gold abacus by his side.
<br><br>
This unique Other Shore Token was unexpectedly effective. He could feel an odd whirlpool in his inner world. Every time he began to extract the Other Shore Power, the whirlpool would absorb most of the power, leaving only a little left.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The people from the Oneness Sky Palace were now gathering to face off with him again, followed closely by the Pear Hill group.
<br><br>
Chaim risked his life to pave the way for them. They would not waste this chance.
<br><br>
"I will give you another chance! If you release Zen, we will let bygones be bygones," Elvinia called out, glaring daggers at Mount.
<br><br>
Mount just continued to quietly ponder how to extricate himself from his current predicament.
<br><br>
Elvinia grew impatient. When Mount didn't respond, she raised her Warrior of the Stone Hill above her head and slashed at him.
<br><br>
As soon as Elvinia began to attack, so did Dorothy and the other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
The Six Snake Shadows from the Snake Goddess race and Natalie also burst out their Other Shore Power! As the sword radiance from all the said people was about to hit Mount, his body turned blurry as he once again teleported away.
<br><br>
But when he emerged in another spot, Milo was already waiting there and lunged at Mount.
<br><br>
Mount only gave Milo a sheepish smile. He didn't like it when others were able to read his mind. He was getting tired of Milo's tricks. He teleported again, appearing behind Milo and bearing down a blow on the back of his neck.
<br><br>
Six hundred divine megatons of force could still be fatal if it hit vital parts.
<br><br>
But Milo was a peerless genius in the Flow Sword Sect. He reflexively jabbed his sword backward to block Mount's attack.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Milo did not have Zen's extraordinary build, so the effect of countering six hundred divine megatons of force was expected. Milo fell to the ground like lead with a loud thud.
<br><br>
Fortunately, he was still able to block the strike with his long sword at the last minute. Otherwise, it really would have been fatal.
<br><br>
After that first strike, the gold abacus beside Mount started rattling again.
<br><br>
This time, the number it showed was down to six hundred.
<br><br>
"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!"
<br><br>
The Six Snake Shadows formed a huge and mysterious array as they launched themselves at Mount.
<br><br>
Mount flickered out of his original spot again before his fist landed on a member of the Snake Goddess race, knocking her away. The golden abacus jostled again and reduced the number it showed to three hundred.
<br><br>
As Mount continued on his attacks, the Other Shore Power he could release was getting weaker and weaker.
<br><br>
One hundred and fifty...Seventy five...
<br><br>
Thirty two...
<br><br>
Sixteen...
<br><br>
Eight...
<br><br>
When his force was reduced to eight divine megatons, his attack no longer posed any threat.
<br><br>
Even the weakest disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace were now much stronger than him.
<br><br>
Even so, there was no sign of panic on the face of Mount. Just as Chaim had said, the most important thing Mount relied on was his space theurgy, which was a bloodline theurgy. The golden abacus couldn't deal with his bloodline theurgy at all.
<br><br>
But Mount was still trying to find out the limits of the abacus. He knew the abacus couldn't possibly be without any limitations.
<br><br>
As Mount made his way through the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the members of the Snake Goddess race, a black figure suddenly appeared behind him. The figure burst out in strange laughter.
<br><br>
Chapter 3430 The Change Of The World Not only did Mount have a remarkable space theurgy, but also had enough strength to make the Evil God fear him.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God did not hesitate. In fact, the more threatening something was, the more he wanted to go for it.
<br><br>
Originally, he wanted to give Zen the fatal blow while waiting in the shadows.
<br><br>
But at this point, he had no idea where Zen was sent away. Luckily, Mount had the special space ability, which made him a fine target.
<br><br>
If the Evil God could somehow obtain a similar mystical space theurgy, he would be powerful beyond imagination.
<br><br>
As Mount's power was restrained by Chaim's abacus, the Evil God saw this as the perfect opportunity.
<br><br>
Cautiously, he snuck around behind a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, which allowed him to appear right behind Mount after he used teleportation.
<br><br>
Accompanied by a heinous laugh, a ray of black light shone in the Evil God's eyes.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
Just like that, the black light in his eyes began to extend, forming slender four-legged snakes. The creatures began to twist and intertwine themselves around Mount, keeping him captive.
<br><br>
Mount showed no panic, but his face did express a sense of irritation.
<br><br>
He tried to wave his arms around, flailing them just to get rid of the snakes.
<br><br>
But they were strong and securely wrapped around him, so there was nothing he could do.
<br><br>
It came to a point where his Other Shore Power had come close to none.
<br><br>
His physical strength only reached dozens of divine megatons, making it nearly impossible to break free from the snakes.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
After thinking hard, he realized he could not use power in this situation. He had to come up with another means of escape.
<br><br>
Within seconds, Mount's figure began to slowly disappear, as he used the Grand Teleportation technique to escape.
<br><br>
But he failed as the snakes had a unique energy attribute. They had the ability to attach themselves so firmly onto his body that he couldn't even move into the space! "You can't escape..." The Evil God chuckled, enjoying as he watched Mount struggle.
<br><br>
Though the Evil God taunted, Mount paid no attention to him. Suddenly, a cube began to emerge from the pupil of his eye, growing until it enveloped him, the snakes and the Evil God into a dimension.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Mount was able to move away now, but he took the Evil God with him! The next moment, both of them were up in the air at ten thousand feet, descending rapidly.
<br><br>
The Evil God did not have time to process what was happening. Just now, he successfully captured Mount, but at this moment, he was being dragged down by Mount! Even after he had escaped, Mount still couldn't make use of the Other Shore Power. His weight and physical strength were no match for the Evil God's power. The Evil God tugged the snakes, and he stopped midair.
<br><br>
As the Evil God was able to hover, Mount saw this as an opportunity and he created enough space and moved them again.
<br><br>
Just after that, Evil God saw a foot making its way towards him. It was the foot of no other than the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits! Meanwhile, members of the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mouse race and the other races were battling with the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, so they were all very surprised when they saw Mount and the Evil God suddenly appear.
<br><br>
The Evil God was disappointed that he didn't see this coming. It never occurred to him that Mount would use the mother to his own advantage.
<br><br>
So naturally, the sight of the huge foot took the Evil God by surprise.
<br><br>
And even though the mother moved slowly, her strength was notably destructive. Even the light shields of the arrays got crushed just with her stomp. As terrifying as the mother could be, even the Evil God couldn't resist her.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
The Evil God wasted no time and dragged Mount away.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
In an instant, the mother landed on the ground, creating a gaping crater on the surface.
<br><br>
But as soon as the Evil God was able to drag Mount away from the foot, the space before him shook and changed. He and Mount ended up appearing under the other foot of the mother! At first, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had grown irritable. But upon seeing the Evil God and Mount moving around her feet, she did not hesitate to crush them.
<br><br>
She trod down with her giant foot, aiming for the two warriors beneath her.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
The Evil God moved away quickly, dragging Mount with him. "Do you want to die with me?" he asked.
<br><br>
Mount looked at him unafraid, and answered calmly, "If I wanted that, I would have used the Grand Teleportation technique right when the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits trampled down."
<br><br>
If Mount teleported them when the foot of the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits was only a few feet above the ground, the two of them would be crushed into pieces. No matter how fast the Evil God moved, there was no escaping the mother! "This Is just a warning," Mount said. "Let go of me now, or I swear we will die together!"
<br><br>
Mount would not die and did not give too much value on his own life, but the Evil God would die.
<br><br>
In the face of death, he remained unperturbed and did his best to get himself out of this predicament.
<br><br>
And even though the Evil God was extremely arrogant, he feared death just like everyone else.
<br><br>
The last thing he wanted to do was getting dragged by Mount to their tragic deaths. The next moment he would definitely let go of Mount to avoid being dragged to death. This was the judgment of Mount.
<br><br>
But Mount was wrong.
<br><br>
"You really think so?"
<br><br>
Suddenly, the black light flashed in Evil God's eyes and began to spread out again.
<br><br>
"Thump, thump, thump..."
<br><br>
And just then, the place was swept with a deafening silence.
<br><br>
Everyone heard their own heartbeat.
<br><br>
As the color of the surroundings began to change, the black smog became white and yellow rocks became dark blue.
<br><br>
The skin that was snow-white began to darken, while the dim sky began to shine the blazing white light.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"What's going on?"
<br><br>
"Run away right now! Don't be distracted!"
<br><br>
People were panicking, wondering what in the world was going on. One of the members of the Separate Abyss race grew so distracted that he was crushed by the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
As Mount noticed the altering atmosphere, his pupils shrunk and his expression changed. "A world has descended... Which civilization gave it to you?"
<br><br>
He turned towards the Evil God, who narrowed his eyes at the question.
<br><br>
"You really have a sharp eye, don't you?" The Evil God smirked. "You can even see that a civilization is behind me!"
<br><br>
In fact, there were still many civilizations remaining on the Other Shore. At this point, every ruling civilization had come to an agreement: only the chosen spokesperson of the civilization had the ability to descend a world.
<br><br>
And the rules in this kind of world would be redefined.
<br><br>
However, some civilizations were stronger than others. This meant that some worlds that descended were also stronger than others.
<br><br>
For example, the blood-red world brought by the Bright Mountain's leader was not powerful, because the civilization behind him could not be considered a ruling one.
<br><br>
"Even if you let a new world descend, you would not be able to do anything to me!" As soon as the words left his mouth, Mount enclosed himself and the Evil God in a cube once again.
<br><br>
This time, he made sure to use the space theurgy accurately, moving towards the edge of the foot of the mother. He hovered the Evil God right under the foot, threatening him with a sudden death. Should the foot step on the cube, the Evil God would not be able to dodge it.
<br><br>
However, when the Evil God was thrown in, he flashed his body, employing the Grand Teleportation technique to move away from the cube and into the air. He looked down at Mount and grinned. "It is indeed a wonderful thing, your space theurgy." He chuckled. "Quite convenient. I can't wait to have it..."
<br><br>
After the Evil God finished speaking, his arms trembled and crimson energy radiated form his body. It formed an outline, a huge figure of energy, which was the shadow of Snake Goddess! Chapter 3431 Copying All The Bloodline Theurgies The shadow of Snake Goddess was a unique bloodline theurgy of the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
Most of the members had the capability of exerting this theurgy, but the power levels varied depending on the purity of their blood. The purer the blood, the more powerful the skill.
<br><br>
Yan's shadow of Snake Goddess, for example, was at the highest level owing to her purer blood while Natalie's was lower in level.
<br><br>
So when the Evil God used the shadow of Snake Goddess, it immediately attracted everybody's attention.
<br><br>
"That can't be! Is that the shadow of Snake Goddess?"
<br><br>
"That's our unique bloodline theurgy? How is he able to use it? He's not one of our kind!"
<br><br>
"What kind of ability is this?"
<br><br>
Yan could only stare at the Evil God, not quite comprehending what was currently happening.
<br><br>
While everyone was still in a state of shock, the Evil God's body began to change again.
<br><br>
Everyone watched as his body trembled and his bones morphed into something else. Two heads sprouted out of his shoulders while four arms grew on his back.
<br><br>
"Three heads and six arms?"
<br><br>
"Is that the bloodline theurgy of the Nine Li race?"
<br><br>
"What's going on here?"
<br><br>
Sally's face paled when she witnessed the three heads and the six arms of the Evil God. "How did he do that? He's not a member of the Nine Li race,"
<br><br>
she murmured in disbelief.
<br><br>
"He seems to have the ability to acquire other people's bloodline theurgy,"
<br><br>
Chaim told her, having figured it out a little bit. "I think he got this ability after making this strange world descend. Since the Evil God copied Mount's skill and also used the Grand Teleportation, that means Mount could freely ignore the spatial restrictions of the Chaotic Source World because of his bloodline theurgy."
<br><br>
Chaim's explanations made sense and Sally couldn't help but be impressed with how observant he had been.
<br><br>
However, he was also clever enough to figure out another secret.
<br><br>
"If he was able to have three heads and six arms, then that means there are members of the Nine Li race with us in this space," Chaim continued.
<br><br>
Sally couldn't help but frown at Chaim's words.
<br><br>
Since he was able to see it, those outside the Chaotic Source World might also come up with this conclusion.
<br><br>
There was no way to hide their identity as members of the Nine Li race anymore.
<br><br>
As the Evil God finished his transformation, the six fists he had clenched tightly and let out a burst of golden light. This blinding light enveloped him and began to change his body once more.
<br><br>
Those from the Separate Abyss race were busy avoiding the attacks from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. However, the golden light that suddenly bathed the Evil God's body made them all stop. Surprise and bewilderment showed on their faces.
<br><br>
"Golden Metal Transformation?"
<br><br>
"That's the supreme bloodline theurgy of our Separate Abyss race!"
<br><br>
"Hamzah was the only one in the team who was able to apply this theurgy.
<br><br>
How in the world did this guy get it?"
<br><br>
The Separate Abyss race's bloodline theurgy was special. It was divided into three stages, each with totally different powers.
<br><br>
Activating this power transformed the body and made one's flesh and bone much stronger.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race managed to bring out a thousand divine megatons of power by simply relying on this bloodline theurgy alone.
<br><br>
The first stage of this bloodline theurgy was the Purple Metal Transformation, followed by the Melting Metal Transformation, and ended with the peak Golden Metal Transformation. Only a handful of people reached the third stage since the flesh and blood suitable for utilizing this skill belonged to the noblest lineage in the Separate Abyss race. Hamzah was the only one in the team that was qualified to use it.
<br><br>
So how in the world did the Evil God, a warrior obviously not from their race, use it? As the Evil God continued to activate more bloodline theurgies, Mount's face became grimmer and grimmer.
<br><br>
Never in his life did he ever expect that he would face such a powerful warrior. The Evil God truly represented a strong ruling civilization on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The golden abacus floated beside him and the number it displayed was very small: one three-thousandth of a divine megaton. There was no way to fight with such little Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
"This is going to be troublesome..."
<br><br>
Mount murmured to himself.
<br><br>
He had previously found out that Zen was incredibly hard to deal with.
<br><br>
Having found himself faced against a strong opponent, Mount could only delete Zen and the space he was in.
<br><br>
In the entire Chaotic Source World, Zen had been the most threatening creature of all.
<br><br>
To his surprise and abject horror, the moment Zen was sent away, an even more troublesome guy appeared.
<br><br>
Mount could only look on as the bloodline theurgies continued to express themselves onto the Evil God's body, making his aura grow stronger and stronger.
<br><br>
Some of the bloodline theurgies he exhibited enhanced the body while others gave him strength, speed, and even more powerful abilities.
<br><br>
As the bloodline theurgies merged within him, the Evil God got one step closer to full invincibility.
<br><br>
"Hahaha..."
<br><br>
An emperor's aura began to emanate from the Evil God. Even the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had to stop and maintain a distance from him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the atmosphere outside the Chaotic Source World remained tense.
<br><br>
Leaders of various races sported identical grim expressions on their faces.
<br><br>
While they were competing for the Chaotic Source Spirits, the Evil God suddenly appeared and began exhibiting such horrifying abilities. They were envious of him, but also felt deeply concerned about the members of their races.
<br><br>
"I hope he can restrain himself," a leader of the Bearing race muttered.
<br><br>
"Wait," Elizabeth spoke, suddenly having thought of something.
<br><br>
The leader of the Divine Farmer race gave her a look.
<br><br>
"This guy is able to borrow everyone's bloodline theurgy, so does that mean there are members of the Nine Li race in the world he created? Those three heads and six arms are definitely from the Nine Li race's bloodline theurgy!" Elizabeth commented seriously.
<br><br>
Several other leaders nodded in agreement, finding her observation valid.
<br><br>
The complexities of this current situation made them almost miss such an important detail.
<br><br>
"It is my honor to obtain so many bloodline theurgies! It's unfortunate that they're only temporary. So disappointing..." The Evil God shook his head regretfully. "Therefore, I will let you all sleep forever in this world so that I can have these bloodline theurgies forever!"
<br><br>
He let out a roaring laugh before disappearing from where he stood.
<br><br>
When he disappeared, Mount also vanished in his spot, making the Evil God miss his target.
<br><br>
The two continued to dodge each other's attacks, disappearing and reappearing here and there as their fight continued.
<br><br>
Truth be told, Mount did most of the dodging. The Evil God was so good at throwing his offensive attacks that Mount had no time to throw one of his own.
<br><br>
"Such power! I don't think he'll ever be suppressed by anyone at this point, not even Zen..." Chaim murmured.
<br><br>
The Evil God had made himself clear.
<br><br>
Whatever unique bloodline theurgy it was, the Evil God could copy it so long as anyone with that theurgy was in this world.
<br><br>
However, if the owner of the theurgy was killed, then it would become his permanently.
<br><br>
Having obtained the acute sensibility of the Ear Mouse race, the Evil God even foresaw Mount's planned moves and attacks.
<br><br>
As he dodged the continuous attacks from his formidable opponent, Mount suddenly thought of a solution that could turn the tides.
<br><br>
His eyes fell on Yan.
<br><br>
He knew he could only rely on that person's strength now.
<br><br>
Yan was a very important person for the Pear Hill, so Mount trapped her in the cage so that she would be safe.
<br><br>
If he released her from that cage and put her in the line of danger, then that person would surely take action.
<br><br>
Chapter 3432 An Angered Mount Mount used his spatial transference again and appeared behind Yan.
<br><br>
The space cage was thirty feet high, and as his fingers made contact with its surface, it began to crack in a million different directions before splitting into pieces.
<br><br>
Yan didn't understand why Mount would release her now. Just as she had begun questioning all this, another figure appeared on the other side. It was the Evil God! Yan had regarded Mount as the enemy after he banished Zen, but her hatred for the Evil God was far stronger! Swish! Without hesitation, countless energy beams materialized from the shadow of Snake Goddess behind her and slashed at the Evil God.
<br><br>
The energy beams were so incredibly powerful that they would surely have killed the ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
The Evil God sneered at the beams charging at him. "Don't be a fool."
<br><br>
As he spoke, the shadow of Snake Goddess behind him flew towards Yan.
<br><br>
Countless blood red energy beams converged together, like octopuses entangled in battle.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, a winner was decided.
<br><br>
The Evil God's energy beams had split Yan's! "What?"
<br><br>
Yan's face was awash with confusion.
<br><br>
Her shadow of Snake Goddess was the most powerful. No one in the same realm could surpass her in terms of blood, yet she was defeated. It didn't make sense! "That's impossible!"
<br><br>
Natalie exclaimed, her eyes widened. This shocked other members of the Snake Goddess race as well.
<br><br>
Even if the Evil God could replicate anyone's blood, his bloodline theurgy still shouldn't be as powerful as Yan's. But now, it seemed he could quite easily surpass Yan.
<br><br>
Mount stood behind Yan, calmly watching on.
<br><br>
The fight between the shadows of Snake Goddess did not concern him.
<br><br>
Fuxi would most certainly get involved, if the Evil God showed any intention to kill Yan.
<br><br>
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The Evil God manipulated his shadow of Snake Goddess to overwhelm Yan's, crushing it before sweeping forward.
<br><br>
Yan had resigned to retreat when suddenly, the energy beams disappeared.
<br><br>
They had gone through the space Yan was in and rushed out behind her towards Mount.
<br><br>
"He's so cunning!"
<br><br>
Mount thought the arrogant Evil God would try to kill Yan. He hadn't expected him to let her go and hone in on him instead.
<br><br>
The Evil God might have looked wild and unruly, but he was actually quite calculated and focused.
<br><br>
Fuxi had punished him before he entered the Chaotic Source World and he knew he was no match for him now. So, he made a wise decision.
<br><br>
At least this woman called Yan couldn't be killed, or his chances of escaping the Icy Snow Province would probably be non-existent.
<br><br>
Of course, the Evil God was not as wise as Mount. Mount understood the relationship between Yan and the Pear Hill and used this knowledge to lure Fuxi into the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
But the Evil God's instincts told him to not take the risk.
<br><br>
Mount was now left with no choice but to use the Grand Teleportation again.
<br><br>
After teleporting three or four times, they had ended up at the edge of this world created by Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God had predicted with great accuracy where Mount would teleport to and had gotten there before even he had. Scarlet energy beams turned into sharp spears and rushed towards Mount.
<br><br>
If Mount could use the Other Shore Token to activate the Other Shore Power, this attack would not scare him in the slightest.
<br><br>
But he couldn't.
<br><br>
As the Evil God had all his attention fixed on Mount, wisps of soft hair suddenly wrapped around his leg, pulled him and threw him away.
<br><br>
"Uncle Mount, I'm back!" Mya said with a smile stretched across her face.
<br><br>
She was unwillingly teleported outside of the core area and had now hurried back.
<br><br>
She used her long hair to throw the Evil God away on seeing him attack Mount.
<br><br>
She felt proud to have saved him.
<br><br>
"Watch out!" Mount yelled at her desperately.
<br><br>
He sped towards her in an attempt to teleport her away but it was no use.
<br><br>
Mya was not aware of the danger in front of her. The Evil God gently hooked his finger and connected the two spaces. The blood red energy beams had passed through the space and pierced through Mya's body.
<br><br>
Phew! Phew! Phew! Mya's face went pale and petrified when she saw the energy beams burst out through her chest. She looked at Mount in despair, not daring to move a muscle.
<br><br>
Crack! Just a moment later, her body was torn apart and fell rapidly.
<br><br>
Everyone outside the Chaotic Source World exclaimed in shock and terror.
<br><br>
All the leaders of the Divine Farmer race went ghastly pale.
<br><br>
Mya was their most powerful member.
<br><br>
Mount was powerful too, but he had a special background and this made him different from the ordinary members of the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
Mya's death was the last thing in the world on their minds. This would be difficult to explain on their return.
<br><br>
"Look at this! Whoever dares get in the way while I fight will meet a horrific demise, just like this!" the Evil God mocked as he glared at the broken corpse lying on the ground.
<br><br>
Mount quietly rose up in the air, bubbling with rage like a volcano on the brink of eruption.
<br><br>
Thin lines glittering with an orange glow appeared on his body. The space around him began trembling.
<br><br>
Crack! The space around him collapsed into pieces.
<br><br>
They did not disappear, but hovered around him like sharp glazed tiles.
<br><br>
"Using the broken space as a weapon?" The Evil God's eyes lit up with excitement.
<br><br>
The more powerful Mount's bloodline theurgy was, the more excited the Evil God was.
<br><br>
He could give full play to other people's bloodline theurgies. Some bloodlines even enhanced the power of other bloodlines.
<br><br>
This was why his shadow of Snake Goddess was stronger than Yan's; he had mixed it with the bloodlines of the Moon Spirit race and another large race. It was possible, at that time, he was the only one to have mixed several bloodlines.
<br><br>
Among all the bloodlines, Mount's was the most mysterious.
<br><br>
Till now, the Evil God could only call forth thirty percent of its power, but he was curious about what would happen if he pushed it to its limit.
<br><br>
Everyone in the core area, including the disciples of the Pear Hill and the Oneness Sky Palace, all hoped that Mount was able to triumph over the Evil God.
<br><br>
In another void, half a giant hand floated silently.
<br><br>
Zen darted to the side of it.
<br><br>
He reached out and gently removed some amber crystals from the smooth and neat crack on the giant hand.
<br><br>
"Wow, it's no wonder the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits is so tough. There are more than one thousand crystals in this hand," Zen murmured to himself.
<br><br>
After putting all the amber crystals into the space ring, he began surveying his surroundings.
<br><br>
It was a dark place with a dreadfully silent environment.
<br><br>
Vague shapes of objects could be seen in the distance, and even further than that, lines with a faint luster were visible.
<br><br>
"Where am I?"
<br><br>
Zen asked utterly perplexed.
<br><br>
Chapter 3433 Outside The Chaos Zen was well-accustomed to the Space Law. He had a general understanding of its operation.
<br><br>
Based on his first impression, Zen thought that he must be trapped in some kind of space or within the depths of the space crack.
<br><br>
However, he doubted this as he watched the scene unfolding right in front of his eyes.
<br><br>
Inside his mind, No. 9527 seemed to go blank for a while. Finally, it said, "It's an unknown place."
<br><br>
"Unknown? What do you mean?" There was a note of incredulity in Zen's voice. This information had absolutely stunned Zen.
<br><br>
"The power displayed by Mount was the unique theurgy of a Chaos Ancient God," responded No. 9527. There was no other way of explaining it.
<br><br>
When Zen heard this, a sudden realization dawned upon him. "You mean to say that Mount has the blood of a Chaos Ancient God just like me? That explains so much."
<br><br>
Any high-level energy could easily get rid of the restraint of a low-level energy.
<br><br>
All the strong warriors who created the Chaotic Source World had highly exceptional abilities. Therefore, it was quite impossible for these young warriors to break the restrictions of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
However, Mount was able to do it effortlessly. This only meant that the level of his energy was extremely high.
<br><br>
After careful judgment of his current situation, Zen finally settled on an answer. Mount could also use a truth-level theurgy much like him.
<br><br>
"He is different from you, though," No. 9527 suddenly spoke and dismissed Zen's conclusion.
<br><br>
"Really? What's the difference between the two of us?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"He is a part of the Chaos Ancient God. He had been raised from infancy to adulthood with the blood of the Chaos Ancient God in him," replied No.
<br><br>
9527 in a low voice. It seemed that it was depressed.
<br><br>
"You mean he is a Chaos Ancient God?!" Zen was absolutely taken aback.
<br><br>
A look of pure astonishment registered upon his face. After taking a long time to digest this news, he asked, "Earlier, you said that this is an unknown place. What exactly does that mean?"
<br><br>
No. 9527 thought for a moment and replied, "Mount's theurgy is the space itself. He masters the bottom-layer space concept of the chaos. If we compare the chaos to a house, then what he did just now was to cut a corner and throw you and the half hand within this corner out of the house. In other words, he has deleted this space from the chaos."
<br><br>
Zen blinked as he tried to absorb what No. 9527 just said.
<br><br>
No. 9527 had given an easily comprehensible explanation. However, it sounded quite unbelievable.
<br><br>
"Are you implying that this place is outside of the chaos?" Zen inquired. He was starting to get a little worried now.
<br><br>
"I have no idea," No. 9527 answered honestly.
<br><br>
"Unbelievable. Even you don't know," Zen muttered dejectedly.
<br><br>
At first, he thought it wouldn't be too difficult for him to go back. But now, he started feeling a faint surge of panic. He finally realized the gravity of this situation.
<br><br>
"I don't know what's outside the chaos. Actually, even if my master came personally, he might not be able to answer that question as well," No. 9527 replied morosely.
<br><br>
Every creature had their own understanding of space.
<br><br>
To a tiny bug, the space it felt was probably just a few rooms, and the world outside the rooms was unimaginable for it.
<br><br>
As for the humans and other mortal races, they were well-aware that mountains, seas, and continents existed within the space they inhabited.
<br><br>
However, that was all they knew about.
<br><br>
The warriors in the Source World knew that their world had an end. Huge crystal walls existed at the end of the world. These crystal walls were steadfast and immovable. Only the True Gods were able to pass through them.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the True Gods in the Source World had a deeper understanding that the crystal walls divided the Source World into large provinces. Outside those provinces, it was the boundless and immeasurable chaos.
<br><br>
However, the chaos had borders as well. Only the supreme masters in the Source World and the Chaos Ancient Gods knew about the existence of these borders.
<br><br>
For example, the bottom of the chaos was a border at the lowest level.
<br><br>
Up until now, no one had any idea what it was like outside the borders. The world outside the chaos was totally incomprehensible.
<br><br>
Zen pursed his lips. He perfectly understood that it wasn't that No. 9527 didn't want to tell him. It genuinely had no idea either.
<br><br>
His gaze swept across the entire void. Eventually, he focused his eyes at some of the things he could see in the distance. He couldn't quite make out what they were so he decided to take a closer look.
<br><br>
They were not that far away from where he was. He managed to reach them in less than thirty seconds.
<br><br>
The things he saw turned out to be the remains of a house.
<br><br>
There were several beautifully sculpted white jade pillars and crushed stones serenely drifting in the void. However, the pillars were severely damaged and seemed as though they had been floating there for years.
<br><br>
"This must be the house of a certain race in the Source World," Zen mumbled as he analyzed the ruins.
<br><br>
"Most probably, they shared the same fate as you. After they were deleted, they were thrown out of chaos and ended up here," added No. 9527 quite frankly.
<br><br>
No matter how harsh that might seem, Zen wasn't thoroughly discouraged by it.
<br><br>
He traveled through the ruins for a while. Finally, he found two long swords and a crooked hook. They were actually in pretty good condition, and their grade was at least the same as that of the Profound Blood Treasure.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, these treasures were of no use to Zen. He casually threw them into the space ring and continued to move around the ruins while carefully looking for some valuable clues.
<br><br>
The remains of the house stretched for about ten miles. Sadly, Zen hadn't discovered anything worthwhile. Eventually, he reached the end of the house.
<br><br>
Standing on the edge of the ruins, Zen scanned the horizon and spotted another wreckage not far away. He swiftly headed towards that direction to search for clues.
<br><br>
There he saw all kinds of metals floating in the void. The metals were distorted into various shapes and figures. Upon closer inspection, one could see the runes carved on the metals. Obviously, these runes were much different from those found in the Source World.
<br><br>
Zen passed by a huge object that looked like a giant metal cup. After checking the inside of it, his expression froze. He couldn't believe his eyes.
<br><br>
"So many corpses..." Zen whispered to himself while examining them carefully.
<br><br>
There were dozens of corpses curled up inside the cup. Strangely enough, those corpses emitted a brass glow. Even after several years after their death, they still looked like they had just died.
<br><br>
Zen pulled out a long sword and lightly tapped one of the corpses. A crisp sound rang as he did this.
<br><br>
"Hmm. Just as I suspected, these corpses are made of metal," Zen murmured.
<br><br>
Ever since he entered the Other Shore and merged with the Civilization Artifact, Zen had a deeper understanding that not every life had flesh and blood.
<br><br>
For instance, the bodies of the members of the Regal Jade Civilization were made of jade. Their entire civilization was built from a flying jade.
<br><br>
Essentially, they were different from the other creatures in the Source World.
<br><br>
Therefore, it didn't seem strange to Zen that the Metal Civilization existed in the chaos. It was perfectly plausible.
<br><br>
"These are not the creatures of the current civilization," No. 9527 added.
<br><br>
In the previous chaos, there were other Chaos Ancient Gods that existed.
<br><br>
They controlled the bottom-layer space theurgy. Naturally, they would delete some unnecessary spaces and throw them out like Mount did.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement. In any case, he was not interested in these metal bodies. He stood at the edge of the metal cup and sighed, "Is there no other living being in this place?" He felt exasperated.
<br><br>
At the very least, there seemed to be no danger within this void. For some creatures with an infinite lifespan, they should be able to survive for a long time.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but get a little disappointed. The deafening silence of this vast space was too depressing.
<br><br>
Chapter 3434 Little Monsters And Their Trap Zen wasn't able to find any valuable clues from the metal debris.
<br><br>
The Metal Civilization had its own words that differed from the Sanskrit words. Because of this, it was impossible for Zen to understand them given the time constraint.
<br><br>
After collecting a few special-looking metals, Zen crossed the area where the piles of debris were.
<br><br>
The piles of debris were closely connected and floated through the air.
<br><br>
Some of them had remarkable features, though Zen could just vaguely recognize the civilizations to which they belonged. Most of them were stones and fragments of buildings from ancient civilizations. Zen even found an entire mountain in the pile of debris.
<br><br>
"This is a whole mountain."
<br><br>
As he stood upon the top of the mountain, Zen unleashed his spiritual sense into it and examined its interior.
<br><br>
Inside the mountain, some caves contained corpses of small animals.
<br><br>
Judging from their appearances, it was hard to tell how long they had been dead in there.
<br><br>
"It's kind of strange," Zen noted as he furrowed his brows.
<br><br>
"What's the matter?" No. 9527 inquired.
<br><br>
"How could the corpses of these small animals be well preserved?" Zen responded.
<br><br>
It would be quite normal for the dead bodies made up of metal to not decay for countless years.
<br><br>
However, the corpses were of common animals. Naturally, they would have decayed already after being dead for so long.
<br><br>
This unnatural phenomenon raised Zen's curiosity.
<br><br>
"That's not surprising at all," No. 9527 answered indifferently. "Time does not exist here. Even if they have been dead for millions or billions of years, their bodies will remain the same."
<br><br>
There was no concept of time in the space they were in.
<br><br>
Zen got a bit of a hard time believing that this phenomenon could exist.
<br><br>
Just when he withdrew his spiritual sense, he suddenly perceived something moving on the other side of the mountain.
<br><br>
He detected a silhouette but couldn't catch a clear view of it. One thing was for sure—it was a living being.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Wasting no time, Zen sprinted towards the back of the mountain. When he looked around carefully, his eyes lit up. "Found you," he whispered.
<br><br>
Eventually, a monster with two feet and a big eye came out of a small cave.
<br><br>
It held a corpse of a tiny animal in its mouth and dragged it out.
<br><br>
The little monster had keen senses that it immediately discovered Zen floating in the air as soon Zen saw it came out of the cave. It stared at him with its big eye for a few seconds and suddenly stamped its black, shiny feet on the mountain wall.
<br><br>
Its pair of feet were powerful enough to jump from one mountain to another with ease.
<br><br>
As he saw it with his own eyes, Zen became more interested in the creature and began chasing it.
<br><br>
He dashed as fast as he could and stayed closely behind the little monster.
<br><br>
Its body was only the size of a palm, but its speed was fascinating as it easily leaped and shuttled among the debris.
<br><br>
As Zen chased it for five minutes, they had already traversed for thousands of miles. More and more debris floated and scattered as they dashed throughout the area.
<br><br>
Zen became aware that the piles of debris were constantly floating around forming messily into what looked like a three-dimensional city of scraps.
<br><br>
If it weren't for the fact that Zen's spiritual sense was firmly focused on the little monster, it might have fled from his sight.
<br><br>
After another five minutes, the distance between Zen and the creature became a lot closer. Realizing that it couldn't escape from Zen, it suddenly entered through a broken house.
<br><br>
Just as Zen set foot inside, a blue light flashed towards him.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Zen had no idea what kind of light it was, but he knew that it contained strong energy.
<br><br>
With his quick reflexes, he was able to flip his body. The light swept past Zen's face, penetrated through the debris behind, and entered the boundless void.
<br><br>
Soon after, Zen found a bloody wound as thick as a finger on his face.
<br><br>
"How terrifying its power is!"
<br><br>
Zen was shocked at what happened. He looked in the direction from which the light came and noticed another little monster that looked exactly the same as the one he was chasing before. As he stared into its big eye, he observed a blue afterglow in it.
<br><br>
He concluded that the terrifying blue light was released by that little monster.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
A blue dot started to appear in the little monster's eye again. At the same time, rays of blue light were seen on the surrounding debris as several little monsters began crawling out from it.
<br><br>
"Woo, woo..." Zen noticed the little monster he was chasing earlier among the nearby debris. It was making a strange laugh as it still held the cadaver of a small animal in its mouth.
<br><br>
"Tch. So you think you've outsmarted me because you lured me into this trap?" Zen's eyes narrowed as he talked to the creature.
<br><br>
Actually, Zen didn't have any ill-intent towards the little monster. He only wanted to learn more about this world so that he could find a way to leave.
<br><br>
After all, the Chaotic Source World was in dire need of him as the Evil God was still hiding somewhere in the dark and observing covetously.
<br><br>
He was a bit surprised that the little monster had the intention of killing him without even communicating with him.
<br><br>
"Swish, swish, swish..."
<br><br>
The blue lights in the eyes of the little monsters exploded, shot out in different angles, and formed into what seemed like a fine fishing net.
<br><br>
"You're being too naive if you think you can defeat me with such petty tricks."
<br><br>
A cyan-colored feather suddenly emerged above Zen's head, and he hastily shuttled through the huge net formed by the blue lights.
<br><br>
Though the blue lights were extremely powerful, Zen was able to move freely like a light leaf without being grazed.
<br><br>
While continuously dodging, Zen finally got to erase the gap between him and the original little monster. As it was caught off guard, Zen quickly stretched out his arm and grabbed it.
<br><br>
"Woo, woo, woo, woo..."
<br><br>
Blue light shot out from the little monster's eye as it struggled from being captured by Zen. The lights were powerful but the little monster itself was relatively weak as it couldn't do anything to break free from Zen's hands.
<br><br>
Seeing that their companion had been caught, the other little monsters grew restless. The blue light that shot out from their eyes became denser, more energy being released, and the huge net was almost airtight.
<br><br>
Everything was crushed as the piercing rays ran through the surrounding debris.
<br><br>
Zen carried the little monster and moved up to a higher area. Just as his foot touched a piece of debris while escaping, the debris was suddenly pierced by the blue light and immediately turned to dust.
<br><br>
At the same time, Zen noticed that a ray of blue light was reflected by a piece of metal plate about ten feet wide.
<br><br>
'That metal plate can block the light! I might be able to make use of it.' With this in mind, Zen quickly dashed towards the metal plate.
<br><br>
However, the moment he got really close to the metal plate, an unexpected trap was actually waiting for him.
<br><br>
Rays of blue light suddenly shot out from the metal plate, bounced back, and turned into fences. Soon, Zen found out that he was entrapped inside.
<br><br>
Chapter 3435 Treated As A Treasure Zen sat on the metal plate, feeling uncharacteristically helpless. He tried to keep a poker face but he knew his expression showed his anxiety.
<br><br>
The little monster in his hand was now making strange wheezing sounds, almost like laughter. To Zen, it was as though the monster was laughing at him for falling into their trap.
<br><br>
It turned out that this metal plate had originally been a cage.
<br><br>
There was nothing in the debris that could be used to block the blue light.
<br><br>
But no matter who was attacked by these little monsters, they would try to find an object to use as a shield.
<br><br>
Those little monsters had released a blue light which struck the metal plate, reminding Zen that it could deflect the blue light.
<br><br>
So he jumped to the metal plate, and found himself locked in a cage.
<br><br>
Zen stretched out a finger and tapped lightly on the metal plate. That small tap released eight hundred divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
A deep sound burst out, like the striking of an enormous gong.
<br><br>
The metal plate remained motionless. It had not even been dented.
<br><br>
Zen realized that the metal plate was more solid than he had imagined. It would be impossible for him to break it.
<br><br>
His eyes darted around him, searching for a way out. Then his gaze landed on the blue lights around the metal plate.
<br><br>
He took out a khaki shield from his space ring. Someone from an alien race had accidentally dropped the shield in the Chaotic Source World, and Zen had grabbed it up. It was a valuable treasure. Taking a firm grip on the shield, he brushed it lightly against the fences of blue lights.
<br><br>
To his disappointment, instead of deflecting the blue lights, the edge of the shield was cleanly sliced off.
<br><br>
Zen was confident in his own toughness, but he didn't dare try to breach the blue light barrier with his own body. He had a feeling he wouldn't be able to withstand it.
<br><br>
"Maybe spatial transference..." he murmured to himself, thinking rapidly.
<br><br>
He closed his eyes and focused, trying to launch the Grand Teleportation technique so he could leave the metal plate.
<br><br>
However, he failed to construct a space channel through which he could travel. His Space Law didn't work here.
<br><br>
Spatial transference was prohibited in the Chaotic Source World. The space had been confined by some mighty warriors, leading to ordinary space channel unable to break through the space imprisonment.
<br><br>
However, it seemed that there was no Space Law in this place. It was impossible for him to carry out spatial transference.
<br><br>
Zen racked his brain, but he couldn't think of anything else he could try.
<br><br>
Having exhausted all his options, he sighed and sat quietly on the metal plate, waiting to see what would happen next.
<br><br>
The little monster in his grip was still making that strange laughing sound.
<br><br>
Zen scowled and raised his arm, as though to throw it towards the blue light fences.
<br><br>
The little monster seemed to understand what he was planning, and it gave a frightened squeak.
<br><br>
Zen paused. So the little monsters were also afraid of the blue lights? The light was released from their own eyes, yet they feared it.
<br><br>
The little monster struggled and twisted madly in Zen's hand.
<br><br>
The truth was that Zen hadn't really planned on killing his only companion inside this trap. He just wanted to frighten it. He lowered his hand back to his side, and the little monster stopped struggling. He released his grip and the little monster lay down next to Zen. It had finally stopped laughing.
<br><br>
'Since these little monsters were able to set this trap, they must be an intelligent race. The key is to find a way to communicate with them. Let's see what they want from me..."
<br><br>
While Zen was pondering his predicament, the little monsters—who had been running and jumping around on the surrounding debris—began gathering under the metal plate.
<br><br>
They pressed against the metal plate, lifting Zen from the debris. To Zen's surprise, these little monsters lifted him slowly but steadily upwards.
<br><br>
They moved upward for about five minutes, passing through thick clusters of debris. Zen didn't move, fearful of sliding off the plate and into the blue lights. After they made a turn, the sight before Zen surprised him.
<br><br>
As they moved forward, the debris thinned and then disappeared completely. Ahead of him lay a vast city of ruins.
<br><br>
The sprawling city was an eyesore. Arrays of dilapidated houses lined the haphazard streets, and everything seemed to be made of different materials and colors. Even the sizes of the structures varied greatly. A lot of the buildings seemed to be on the verge of falling apart altogether.
<br><br>
Hordes of little monsters seemed to be tucked into every nook and cranny of the strange city. From the roofs, windows, and undersides of every structure, little monsters poked out their heads and stared at the arriving alien prisoner.
<br><br>
As soon as they reached the center of the city of ruins, the little monsters laid down the metal plate carrying Zen. They started to leave.
<br><br>
The little monster who was locked with Zen in the cage screamed, as if calling its companions back. They ignored it. They obviously had no intention of letting it out of the cage.
<br><br>
Zen stood and looked around him, taking in the unusual sights of this strange new world.
<br><br>
This space was deleted from the chaos. It was not erased during the process.
<br><br>
Just like Zen, it would probably feel lonely after being expelled here.
<br><br>
In Zen's inner world, there were still living creatures, including the human race and a variety of other kinds of creatures. He had the ability to pull out these creatures to accompany him in the real world. He could even grow them into a city or a country.
<br><br>
He realized that his relationship with the creatures in his inner world was probably like the relationship of this space to these little monsters. He wondered what they planned to do with him.
<br><br>
As Zen sat in his cage, several little monsters cautiously came up to him, studying him with intense interest. Their large eyes were alight with curiosity and wonder, as though they were looking at a great and mysterious treasure.
<br><br>
In the beginning, lost in his own thoughts, Zen wasn't even aware that he was being observed. Eventually, however, he began to notice the fixed stares of the little monsters around him, and he felt uneasy.
<br><br>
"What do they mean by staring at me like that, No. 9527?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
No. 9527 was also quietly observing the strange world. It knew that there were some special spaces outside the chaos. For example, the Other Shore was a special space at the top of the chaos. After being destroyed, the past civilizations would enter the Other Shore, which was the last place to protect them, and to hide their secrets.
<br><br>
What about this space? This space was a huge trash bin. Apparently, there were some special cases which drove the Chaos Ancient God who controlled the space to just delete them. These cases were thrown into the trash bin, which was where Zen had now ended up.
<br><br>
No. 9527's master was not that Chaos Ancient God, so it was unfamiliar with this world. But it was as curious about the little monsters as they were about Zen.
<br><br>
"Maybe they want to eat you," No. 9527 joked.
<br><br>
Zen scowled, "In case you haven't noticed, I have no escape plan. That's not funny at all."
<br><br>
He was worried because in fact, No. 9527's "joke" was an actual possibility.
<br><br>
He remembered that the little monster he first found in the cave had been looking for the bodies of small animals. It seemed fair to assume that the little monsters lived by eating meat.
<br><br>
No. 9527 sensed his anxiety and turned serious. "Look at their expressions.
<br><br>
You're very important to them. It's not likely that they'll just slaughter and eat you, but they definitely have plans for you."
<br><br>
Zen nodded absently, narrowing his eyes at the little monsters.
<br><br>
He was just a human that had been deleted from the Source World. What possible value could he have for these little monsters that grew up in this abandoned space? Zen wondered what had happened after he was removed. He suspected he was the first person ever to be removed by deletion.
<br><br>
He was tense and imprisoned, anticipating the different things that the little monsters could do to him. But for hours, nothing happened. Half a day passed in this manner. Then, all of a sudden, Zen was alerted to a commotion in the distance. The door to one of the city's bigger structures was opening, and dozens of little monsters crawled out.
<br><br>
These little monsters were actually not as little as the ones that had brought him to this city. The one in the center of the group wore a large and exquisite golden ring. It had an air of authority. It seemed to be the most powerful of the little monsters.
<br><br>
The little monsters approached Zen's cage.
<br><br>
In a moment, they had leaped forward and surrounded Zen entirely, staring at him. He stared back.
<br><br>
They began leaping up and down, especially the little monster with a golden ring. It looked at Zen intensely, but spoke in a gentle voice, as though it was trying not to make him frightened.
<br><br>
Zen paid close attention to every sound and gesture, but it was useless. He couldn't make out even a single word of what any of the little monsters were saying. He was unable to communicate with them at all.
<br><br>
Chapter 3436 A Small Star Zen moved close to the blue lights. "Couldn't you release me first?"
<br><br>
As he said it, he motioned to the blue lights and then to the area outside.
<br><br>
Since he couldn't speak the monsters' tongue, he could only rely on the sign language.
<br><br>
He wasn't sure if the little monster with a golden ring actually understood him, but after a while, it did take the other little monsters away. Zen was left in the cage, helpless. The little monster that had been accompanying him felt the same way.
<br><br>
After about eight hours, some little monsters brought him food. They didn't know he didn't need to eat anything, so they thought that he had to eat just like they did.
<br><br>
The raw meat appeared cut from carcasses. It didn't appeal to Zen at all.
<br><br>
He glanced at the meat, completely uninterested in eating it. Seeing the little monster beside him looking on eagerly, he threw the meat toward it.
<br><br>
The little monster's eye was filled with excitement and gratitude as it wolfed down the meat.
<br><br>
'The blue light these little monsters shoot out from their eyes is powerful enough to hurt me directly. This means the light has a very high level of energy. Why, then, do they need to eat all this meat?' Zen thought, looking at the little monster.
<br><br>
It was impossible for Zen to be hurt by the energy at the same level as the internal momentum of the Godly Ways unless it was the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
The creatures that acquired the internal momentum of the Godly Ways had already reached the True God Realm. To use that kind of theurgy, what they consumed was the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.
<br><br>
Those at the Other Shore Realm, meanwhile, had to absorb divine crystals to replenish their Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
The energy that meat could replenish was simply negligible and wasn't worth much. It was the crudest and least effective way of acquiring energy.
<br><br>
The little monsters couldn't release the terrifying blue light just from eating meat alone. It made no sense.
<br><br>
Moreover, this space had existed for who knew how many years. All carcasses should have already been dug out by these little monsters long ago. But they obviously were still able to obtain the fresh remains of small animals. This was also very strange.
<br><br>
It was only after two days that the little monsters finally made their move.
<br><br>
All the little monsters from the city ruins gathered in this area in neat formations.
<br><br>
The little monster with a golden ring stood above the others, shrieking in a high pitched voice. The little monsters below responded in unison with the same sound from time to time.
<br><br>
Zen couldn't understand what was being said, but he guessed that this was some kind of show of force.
<br><br>
It seemed like a rally before a battle or a major mass action.
<br><br>
What did the little monsters want to do? After a while, the strongest little monsters came over to Zen and lifted the metal cage. It seemed they were going to transport Zen to another place.
<br><br>
However, just as they were about to set off, some red dots appeared in the horizon.
<br><br>
The red dots approached so fast that they flew across the ruins in the blink of an eye. As they came closer, Zen was finally able to make out what they were: double-headed flying snakes.
<br><br>
The moment the red snakes appeared, all the little monsters' auras changed.
<br><br>
Their eyes flashed with hatred. Blue lights shone in their eyes.
<br><br>
Swish! Swish! Swish! Dense blue lights shot upward.
<br><br>
Zen was deeply shocked at the sight.
<br><br>
Since Grand Teleportation was prohibited, even the powerful men of the Chaotic Source Realm and the warriors like Athemar, let alone Zen, wouldn't be able to escape an attack like that.
<br><br>
But the double-headed flying snakes seemed unfazed by it. They opened their mouths wide and spat out blood-red bubbles.
<br><br>
The bubbles moved at a very high speed. When they made contact with the blue lights, the two would counteract and disappear together in a flash. But more blood red bubbles evaded the lights, raining down over the ruins below.
<br><br>
A red bubble exploded near Zen. Traces of blood-red energy spread like lightning, forming a sphere of force ten feet wide.
<br><br>
Everything enclosed in the ball melted completely.
<br><br>
"These double-headed snakes have terrifying energy as well," Zen muttered to himself. He looked at the ensuing crater as his eyelid twitched.
<br><br>
More red bubbles fell to the ground, riddling the city ruins with more craters. The blue lights were able to take down some double-headed flying snakes, however. There was no surviving such a hit.
<br><br>
The hatred between these two races was extremely strong. Each and every one of their encounters led to a fight to the death.
<br><br>
"Geo...geo... geo..."
<br><br>
The little monster with a golden ring screamed something in Zen's direction. At this, the little monsters below the metal plate carried the cage and fled from the battlefield, apparently scrambling to secure Zen.
<br><br>
They hadn't gone far, however, when the double-headed flying snakes in the sky changed direction and started going after them.
<br><br>
Now Zen understood what was going on.
<br><br>
It seemed that not only the little monsters but also the double-headed flying snakes were interested in him. They came here for him.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The little monsters carried Zen through the ruins, while the double-headed flying snakes chased after them relentlessly, intent on taking their captive away.
<br><br>
There were always numerous casualties in this kind of battle.
<br><br>
But it seemed both parties were careful not to harm Zen in the crossfire.
<br><br>
The bubbles from the double-headed flying snakes and the blue lights from the little monsters all avoided the cage in which Zen was imprisoned.
<br><br>
The intense battle continued for a while. The little monsters carried Zen all throughout their retreat, fleeing into another ruin.
<br><br>
As they arrived at one of the ruined structures, Zen's eyes lit up at what he saw ahead.
<br><br>
There was a small yellowish brown star floating at the edge.
<br><br>
The star, measuring over ten thousand feet across, was valuable. Zen was surprised to see a huge statue of a human standing on top of it.
<br><br>
Zen had thought he was the first human that had been exiled to this place. It seemed that he was wrong.
<br><br>
It would appear that the human race had come here many years ago.
<br><br>
However, judging from what remained in this place, many civilizations had gone by. When had this statue been built? While Zen puzzled over it, the little monsters carrying him jumped onto the small star.
<br><br>
Chapter 3437 The Altar The little monsters continued to carry Zen like they were a parade, as they walked along the surface of the small star.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before they finally reached the huge statue.
<br><br>
Zen raised his head and carefully peered at it. The human statue had a beard, a ragged face, and its eyes had a unique aura. The surface of the statue was covered with exquisite runes.
<br><br>
The runes extended all the way from its body to the bottom, then they parted and formed two branches, which then continued to extend until they reached an altar.
<br><br>
When Zen gazed at the altar, he felt his heart pound erratically in his chest.
<br><br>
"Damn it! Are these monsters going to sacrifice me?"
<br><br>
He was completely unfamiliar with the space they were currently in.
<br><br>
Everything was bizarre and there were no rules to follow.
<br><br>
From the way how these little monsters protected him, it was indeed like they were carefully safeguarding a sacrificial offering! As soon as Zen finished speaking, the little monsters carried him and stepped on the altar.
<br><br>
There was a loud, metallic clang when they threw the metal plate on the altar. "Hey!" Zen shouted by the side of the fence that was made up of blue light.
<br><br>
"Geo...geo... geo..." one of the little monsters spoke.
<br><br>
It seemed like it tried to explain something to him, but what was the use of such an explanation when he couldn't understand anything it said? After the little monster had finished, two unique triangle runes suddenly appeared on the human statue's eyes. As the triangle runes flipped, the statue's eyeballs began to roll. It looked Zen up and down in quite a strange way.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen also stared back at the statue's eyeballs with an unreadable expression.
<br><br>
It didn't take long until a bright, white light spread out from both of the eyeballs. The two light beams spread down from the eyes in a way that made them look like tears flowing down the statue's face. The two rays of light continued to flow, until they quickly converged on the altar.
<br><br>
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
<br><br>
The entire altar flashed with strong light, then wrapped Zen together with the metal plate.
<br><br>
When the light illuminated the altar, all the little monsters stepped back and they actually knelt down on the ground in unison. Their eyes were filled with utmost respect.
<br><br>
The light that enveloped the altar lasted about five minutes, then it gradually dimmed.
<br><br>
Once the light was gone, Zen let out a sigh of relief. It looked like they didn't really have any intention of sacrificing him.
<br><br>
Just then, a shadow suddenly appeared in front of the altar. It repeatedly transformed into different things then finally, it turned into an ancient door.
<br><br>
"A space door... But why is there no space fluctuation?"
<br><br>
The space door worked in a similar way as the transmission array. If Zen was given enough time, he could easily create one.
<br><br>
Yet, he found out that there was no Space Law in this space! There was no space fluctuation when the door had been condensed, either.
<br><br>
Naturally, he felt extremely weirded out.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack…"
<br><br>
At that moment, the door opened from the middle.
<br><br>
Two figures emerged out of it. It was a man and a woman, who both floated in the air.
<br><br>
When the little monsters saw the man and woman, they kept on bowing to them, as if the man and woman were divine beings that descended down to the place. The little monsters showed great reverence towards them.
<br><br>
The man and the woman, however, did not pay attention to them. Their gazes were on Zen, and Zen was also watching them.
<br><br>
The man was quite handsome and gentle, and the woman was beautiful and seductively charming.
<br><br>
They stared at each other for a few seconds. After the man had stared at Zen for a long time, he walked over to Zen and reached out his hand towards the blue light.
<br><br>
"Be careful! The blue light…" Zen warned.
<br><br>
Even he could not resist the blue light. If the man ever touched it, then the consequences would be unimaginable.
<br><br>
When the man heard Zen's kind warning, he smiled lightly and said, "It's okay."
<br><br>
With a gentle stroke of his fingers, he let the blue light penetrate through his skin--but he was unscathed.
<br><br>
In fact, his palm absorbed all the blue light, then the fences that were formed by the blue light disappeared completely! "Geo...geo... geo..."
<br><br>
The little monster who had been trapped with Zen screamed a few times and jumped off the altar. It knelt down with the other little monsters, as if the altar wasn't a place it should stay--and if it stayed for one more second, it would have desecrated the divine beings.
<br><br>
"Thank you very much," said Zen and he stood up from the metal plate.
<br><br>
To be honest, he felt a little excited when he finally heard someone speak the human language.
<br><br>
At least this man and woman could communicate with him normally.
<br><br>
The man, however, didn't respond.
<br><br>
The enchanting woman beside him asked, "Did you become an exile here recently?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen nodded. "Are there many humans in the chaos you were in?" the woman asked again.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, Zen quickly deduced that they did not belong to the same round of chaos as him.
<br><br>
"Yes, there are many humans, no less than one quintillion," he replied.
<br><br>
The handsome man and the charming woman looked at each other, their faces lit up with delight. Zen's answer seemed to make them very satisfied.
<br><br>
Happy as they were, Zen's mind was filled with doubts. "You're both human beings like me, but it seems like you are not from the same round of chaos as I am?" he asked.
<br><br>
The charming woman and the handsome man both shook their heads, then said, "We don't come from chaos."
<br><br>
"Not from chaos?" Zen was in shock. "Are you from the outside of the chaos?"
<br><br>
A world outside the chaos was an obscure concept. Not even No. 9527 knew what it was. Perhaps, Zen could find the answer from the two humans.
<br><br>
To his surprise, the two of them shook their heads at the same time "We are the aboriginals of this space, but our master is from the chaos. Our master said that according to the calculation in the chaos, he was born in the 77th chaotic era," the woman responded.
<br><br>
While Zen still thought about the meaning of her answer, No. 9527 mentally reminded him, "The chaotic era should refer to the process from a round of the chaos' birth, till its destruction. Their master might be from the 77th civilization."
<br><br>
There were too many civilizations that had once appeared in the chaos, that it was impossible for even No. 9527 to cover all of them in the statistics.
<br><br>
Some of them had either completely declined and disappeared on the Other Shore, or had hidden themselves.
<br><br>
"Master?"
<br><br>
Zen subconsciously looked at the huge statue and asked, "Is your master still in this space?"
<br><br>
Once again, the man and woman both shook their heads at the same time.
<br><br>
The woman went over and gently pulled Zen as she said, "Come with me!"
<br><br>
The moment they pulled Zen into the gate, the little monsters below the altar made a loud noise. The man patted his head and said with a smile, "Oh, I almost forgot it."
<br><br>
Next, he took out a small bag, from which thousands of brown beads rolled out.
<br><br>
Those brown beads were highly important to the little monsters. Indeed, only after when he threw the beads did the little monsters stop making noises.
<br><br>
Chapter 3438 Delete And Retrieve As soon as the little monsters calmed down, Zen couldn't help but be amazed.
<br><br>
After all, the little monsters imprisoned him, fought with those doubleheaded flying snakes, and then finally sent him to this place.
<br><br>
Did that mean they wanted those brown beads all along? "These little monsters… Are they the aboriginals of this space?" he asked.
<br><br>
The handsome man casually nodded and said, "You can say that. They were originally a race in our master's inner world.
<br><br>
After our master took up this space, he released them."
<br><br>
The little monsters were from the inner world of the man's master?! Once again, Zen was utterly surprised. How powerful was their master, really? How could the creatures in his inner world be so strong? "How about those double-headed flying snakes then?" he asked again.
<br><br>
"They also came from our master's inner world," the handsome man answered with a nod.
<br><br>
The man's response, however, confused Zen. "But I saw them fight so fiercely with each other…" he muttered.
<br><br>
"Our master made them fight on purpose," the handsome man explained.
<br><br>
"He has kept three races in this space. At first, he only kept those doubleheaded flying snakes, but eventually, they were all over the space. So, he had no choice but to introduce the other two races. When the three races are under checks and balances, their numbers can be limited."
<br><br>
In turn, Zen nodded and asked No. 9527 in his mind, "Didn't you say that some Chaos Ancient God controlled this space?"
<br><br>
He just realized that the man's answer completely contradicted what No.
<br><br>
9527 had said before.
<br><br>
No. 9527 was also confused. In the end, it could only say, "You can ask the Regal Jade Spirit. Maybe he knows about it."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit represented the Regal Jade Civilization, and the Regal Jade Civilization had occupied almost the whole entirety of the chaos. He himself had once been a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
Furthermore, No. 9527 just said that the handsome man'master was from the 77th civilization, while the Regal Jade Civilization was the 749th civilization. Thus, it was more likely that the Regal Jade Civilization should have known some things about this space.
<br><br>
Zen followed the handsome man into the door and they walked along a lengthy, narrowly spaced channel. He decided to take advantage of this opportunity to send his incarnation into his inner world.
<br><br>
Back then, Zen had specially created a space in order to make the Regal Jade Spirit teach Geoffrey genuinely and wholeheartedly.
<br><br>
That space was very quiet, as only Geoffrey and the Regal Jade Spirit could come and go freely within it.
<br><br>
In an open yard, the Regal Jade Spirit sat upright while Geoffrey crossed his legs and meditated with his eyes closed.
<br><br>
Some cyan lights spiraled up behind Geoffrey and turned into an exquisite jade lotus. The lotus quietly moved in a spiral motion as the surface of Geoffrey's body became emerald green.
<br><br>
The moment Zen's incarnation entered the space, the Regal Jade Spirit had sensed it.
<br><br>
"Master Regal Jade," Zen greeted as he cupped his hands.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit nodded in response and said, "Geoffrey's talent is really extraordinary. He has already reached the third level of the body refining cultivation method I chose for him, in just a short period of time."
<br><br>
As a ruling force, the Regal Jade Civilization had created countless theurgies.
<br><br>
At the very beginning, the Regal Jade Spirit was worried that it would be difficult for Geoffrey to cultivate the theurgies of the Regal Jade Civilization. After all, there were gaps between different races, and the bodies of the Regal Jade creatures were greatly different from those of other races.
<br><br>
Yet, Geoffrey unexpectedly practiced so smoothly.
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen's gaze swept over Geoffrey, who was focused on cultivation. The emerald green light that emerged from his body was extremely stable. Although his body was not as strong as Zen's own, it was already quite impressive for him to have reached such a level.
<br><br>
Geoffrey was too concentrated on his cultivation, so he didn't notice Zen's arrival.
<br><br>
"With your teachings, of course Geoffrey can make great progress.
<br><br>
But I came here for something else," Zen said. "What's it?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked.
<br><br>
"I think I have found the second flaw of the Ways-blending Energy," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
"What? You have found it? What is the flaw? Are you sure you are not wrong?" Needless to say, the Regal Jade Spirit was stunned.
<br><br>
"I don't think I'm wrong. It's an arc light similar to the Thunderstorm Godly Way.
<br><br>
He also mainly cultivates the Ways-blending Energy and has integrated the arc light into the energy," Zen continued and shook his head. "Have you got the arc light then?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked eagerly.
<br><br>
It was known to all that the Wing King of the Regal Jade Civilization had put a great deal of effort into practicing the Blood Essence Godly Way. He had spent so much time and had gone through countless challenges.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before Zen discovered the second flaw. It was indeed too shocking, so the Regal Jade Spirit couldn't help but be excited.
<br><br>
"Not yet," Zen said with a complicated look in his eyes. "I was exiled to a space when I was in the Chaotic Source World."
<br><br>
"Exiled? It's nothing," said the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "It is a space that has been deleted," he elaborated.
<br><br>
After the Regal Jade Spirit heard Zen's words, his complacency was gone.
<br><br>
"You mean to say that you have been deleted by a Son of Truth and exiled to the outside of the chaos?"
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen replied with a nod.
<br><br>
A helpless smile graced the Regal Jade Spirit's face. "What a coincidence! When I was still a Son of Truth, I had grasped the space truth," he commented.
<br><br>
"What?" Zen exclaimed as his eyebrows shot up to his forehead. "Is there any way to go back?"
<br><br>
Now, he was not interested in the secret of the space at all.
<br><br>
He only wanted to return to the Chaotic Source World as soon as possible! "If I was still the Son of Truth, I could help you go back. Alas, there is no chance for you to go back unless the Chaos Ancient God who exiled you is willing to let you go," the Regal Jade Spirit answered.
<br><br>
Mount was the avatar of a Chaos Ancient God. With his current abilities, he could exile Zen, but he might not be able to bring him back. Moreover, Zen couldn't possibly pin his hopes on his opponent.
<br><br>
When the Regal Jade Spirit saw the faint disappointment on Zen's face, he continued, "Although this space looks empty, I'd exiled countless creatures to this place before--including a few races that resisted the Regal Jade Civilization, some unpredictable threats, and the energy crystals that might explode at any time."
<br><br>
"Empty?" Zen looked at the Regal Jade Spirit with an indecipherable look.
<br><br>
The void was not empty. All kinds of dead bodies were interwoven in it together, like a huge garbage station.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit also noticed the way Zen looked and asked, "Did I say anything wrong?"
<br><br>
"Numerous dead bodies of creatures, rocks and soil, and other things are floating in the space," Zen replied. "No way!" the Regal Jade Spirit refuted him.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit was very familiar with the empty space.
<br><br>
"If things are exiled to this space, they will be deleted once and for all after some time. If they, both the living things and corpses, are not retrieved, they will completely disappear. How can it be like what you said? Take me there!" he declared.
<br><br>
Upon seeing the Regal Jade Spirit's reaction, Zen realized that the Regal Jade Spirit, who used to be the Son of Truth, probably did not know about the change in the space.
<br><br>
Chapter 3439 Waiting The Chaos Ancient God that controlled the bottom-layer space rules held the right to delete spaces.
<br><br>
But those deleted spaces could still be recovered.
<br><br>
Within a certain grace period, they could recover a space they regretted deleting. After this time, though, absolutely nothing could be done.
<br><br>
Having once been a Son of Truth in charge of space, the Regal Jade Spirit was well aware of this fact.
<br><br>
So what Zen said about the strange scene was more surprising than the news that he had found the arc light energy.
<br><br>
Once Zen dispersed the avatar, he took the Regal Jade Spirit out of his inner world and had him hide within his body.
<br><br>
No. 9527 was a part of the Chaos Ancient Gods named Gerald. As the two Chaos Ancient Gods stayed together, they weren't particularly uncomfortable. Now, they were both quietly observing their surroundings.
<br><br>
The space passageway wasn't that long, and it didn't take too long for the three people to reach the end of it. Emerging from it, Zen saw an ancient door, identical to what he had seen before.
<br><br>
When the handsome man pushed the door open, they were met with huge narrow bronze pillars—they were like snakes, strangely entangled with each other.
<br><br>
Zen had noticed the bronze pillars when he was first exiled into the space.
<br><br>
But from where he had been, he could only see dark-golden lines.
<br><br>
Behind the pillars lay the end of the space.
<br><br>
It was nothing like a wall, but something resembled black fur.
<br><br>
"Eh? What happened to the Deleting Pillars? Why did they end up like this?! This…" Fear and doubt seeped into the Regal Jade Spirit's voice.
<br><br>
"Are you talking about these pillars?" Zen asked, confused.
<br><br>
"Yes! The Deleting Pillars serve as the foundation of this space. It's impossible to destroy them—not even the Sons of Truth can do so. In every period of time, these pillars would delete all the things in the space before turning it into a void. But everything seems to have changed, now!" the Regal Jade Spirit explained as he surveyed the void in the distance.
<br><br>
Although the ancient door had sent Zen a great distance away, he could still see the creatures' remains that formed piles of debris.
<br><br>
After seeing the debris Zen was talking about, the Regal Jade Spirit finally came to understand what was fundamentally wrong with the space.
<br><br>
"Since you mastered the space truth of the chaos back then, haven't you discovered anything strange?" "Their master was born in the 77th civilization, and you were born in the 749th," No. 9527 added.
<br><br>
There were over six hundred civilizations that filled the gap between the two civilizations. During this process, over six hundred creatures had become the Chaos Ancient Gods, controlling the bottom-layer truth of space.
<br><br>
But the humans of the 77th civilization were either hiding on the Other Shore and unable to descend to the Source World, or hiding in this void space.
<br><br>
In hiding, not only did they need to avoid being deleted by the Deleting Pillars, they also had to avoid being discovered by the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
By no means was it an easy feat.
<br><br>
"I've never found anything wrong with it…" the Regal Jade Spirit muttered as he shook his head.
<br><br>
As the Regal Jade Spirit talked to No. 9527, the handsome man said, "We've arrived. Please follow me."
<br><br>
"Where are you going to take me?" Zen couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>
"Over there," the woman pointed as she smiled sweetly.
<br><br>
Following the woman's gaze, Zen looked into the distance. On a node where the Deleting Pillars met stood a palace.
<br><br>
Its shape and craft were completely different from what Zen had ever seen in a structure before.
<br><br>
Once they entered the palace, Zen asked, "It's only you two living in this palace?"
<br><br>
The man nodded and said, "The master and his other disciples have already left."
<br><br>
"Left? Have they returned to the chaos?" Zen inquired further.
<br><br>
Shaking her head, the woman replied, "They've already gone to the outside of the chaos."
<br><br>
That drew a gasp from Zen. "Outside the chaos…"
<br><br>
Even the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 were shocked to hear such a thing.
<br><br>
The development of the chaos was a continuous one. Many clues of its development lay on the Other Shore—if one could reach the Other Shore's higher stages, they'd uncover secrets of the chaos along the way.
<br><br>
But what lay outside the chaos had always been a great mystery.
<br><br>
Catching Zen's reaction, the two smiled.
<br><br>
While it was true that they hadn't even been to the Source World, they had heard much of it from their master. Since the moment the chaos was born, no one had left it.
<br><br>
In the Source World, it was an absolute truth that no one could leave the Chaos.
<br><br>
But their master having done so gave the two a sense of pride.
<br><br>
"Ask them how to leave and what's outside the chaos!" both the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9572 urged Zen simultaneously.
<br><br>
The two were powerful and wise beings—very few secrets could even arouse their curiosity. But they were eager to know what exactly was outside the chaos.
<br><br>
"I wonder how your master managed to leave the chaos…and what is even out there?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
The woman merely shook her head. "The space outside the chaos is indescribable. Master also said it was beyond any descriptions we could make with our language. It's something that can only be experienced—no one will understand it through words."
<br><br>
"Why haven't you left the place and experienced it with your master?" Zen returned.
<br><br>
Helplessness flashed across the man's face. "We didn't dare disobey our master's orders. He asked us to wait for you."
<br><br>
"Me? You were expecting me to come?" Zen pursed his lips as he frowned at the thought.
<br><br>
While he was born in this round of chaos, he had never seen their master at all. Zen deeply doubted the couple's words.
<br><br>
With a hint of a sigh, the man continued, "Our master said that the chaos would come to its last round sooner or later. The human race dominating the chaos again will signal a critical time. You're the first human we've ever found since then, and the news you've brought with you is in line with our master's prediction."
<br><br>
Creatures born in each round of chaos were completely different. There were great differences between the different civilizations themselves as well.
<br><br>
Human beings appeared once in the 77th civilization—never again after that. To see a human appear in this round of chaos was truly a phenomenon.
<br><br>
The human race in the Source World couldn't exactly be considered a ruling force. But after the development over the past years, the various human forces had also developed into super forces—such a development didn't happen accidentally.
<br><br>
"So why did your master ask you to wait for me?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
The man smiled and said, "Master has hidden in this space for countless years. He hopes the human race will thrive again, so he's been diligently waiting for the right opportunity."
<br><br>
Turning his head, he looked upon the statue—it was exactly the same as the one on the small star. Engraved beneath it was the name 'King Manard.' Chapter 3440 A Passage Leading To The Outside Zen followed the handsome man's gaze and read the name engraved below the statue.
<br><br>
"Is King Manard your master?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"Yes!"
<br><br>
Both the handsome and the charming nodded, their faces displaying awe and respect at the mention of their master.
<br><br>
Just from the man's words, Zen had obtained some valuable information.
<br><br>
There was a time when the human race had prospered in the chaos. But like the other past civilizations, they had failed to complete the Finale Way. In the end, they had no choice but to hide on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The ancient humans of the Other Shore remained off the grid for countless years — Zen surmised that they had gone into hiding like the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
From that, Zen suspected that the birth of the human race in this round of chaos was no coincidence. Perhaps, the human race on the Other Shore had used some kind of special method to revive the human civilization in the chaos through the flourishing of the Nine Li race, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Zen was well aware that the man and woman had just been waiting for a human, not specifically him.
<br><br>
His appearance signaled the beginning of the ancient human civilization's plan.
<br><br>
"Do you agree with my conjecture?" Through his consciousness, Zen asked No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
Both of them were figures of wisdom and insight, and they found Zen's speculations to be convincing. But No. 9527 then added, "But humans are not united as they should be. If your speculations are right, all humans born in this round of chaos should be created by the ancient human civilization.
<br><br>
The problem is, the Bearing race, the Oneness Sky Palace, and Fuxi from the Pear Hill are on bad terms."
<br><br>
The thought bewildered Zen. If the ancient humans wanted to achieve a certain goal, the new human race they had created must unite toward a single mission. Why then did they split into several branches, holding different positions and following different paths? "Something unnatural must have happened," remarked the Regal Jade Spirit. "The creatures on the Other Shore can't visit the chaos freely due to the Other Shore's special nature. They have to choose spokespersons to fight for them. But the races on the Other Shore don't exactly have much control over the creatures in the chaos."
<br><br>
"Did you have spokespersons before?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
"Of course! Ever since the 751st civilization, we've chosen a spokesperson at the beginning of every civilization. That is, until we were defeated and had to go into hiding at Stage Thirteen. Several of our spokespersons had betrayed us, though. It's rather common on the Other Shore."
<br><br>
The creatures in the chaos entered the Other Shore in pursuit of greater power.
<br><br>
All those chosen as a civilization's spokesperson usually had a good amount of luck and willpower — someone who was reluctant to lower themselves to anyone else's level. After converting to another path, it wasn't surprising for them to betray the civilization they represent.
<br><br>
Having experienced many more rounds of chaos than No. 9527, the Regal Jade Spirit had a greater say on the matter.
<br><br>
After the short discussion in his consciousness, Zen turned to the handsome man and said, "King Manard is indeed a great figure — he managed to control this entire place. I just wonder what he plans to do here."
<br><br>
To Zen's surprise, the pair shook their heads and replied, "We don't know what Master's plan is. He just tasked us to stay here until the first human is exiled to this place."
<br><br>
"And what if other creatures are exiled here?" Zen wondered.
<br><br>
He figured that the Chaos Ancient Gods would get rid of a lot of spaces in a round of chaos. There must have been many creatures of various races who ended up in this place.
<br><br>
"We killed them," replied the man indifferently.
<br><br>
The charming woman then smiled, "Long ago, a huge space was sent here, along with a great number of powerful creatures. He slaughtered them all — I didn't even have time to finish off a single one!"
<br><br>
For a moment, their carefree replies had Zen standing still in a daze.
<br><br>
Only the most powerful creatures in the chaos could be regarded as opponents of the Chaos Ancient Gods. Was it really possible for such powerful things to be killed so easily? It was obvious that the pair had been there for countless years. Zen felt no air of deception from them, nor could he think of any reason why they would lie to him.
<br><br>
"Did King Manard tell you what to do if a human arrived?" Zen asked, thinking it was alright to be straightforward with them.
<br><br>
The woman smiled as she replied, "Of course! You must wait for Master to return."
<br><br>
"How long do we have to wait?" The thought made Zen frown.
<br><br>
If he stayed there for too long, he might fail to return before the Chaotic Source World closed — he'd be in deep trouble.
<br><br>
The man before him merely shook his head. "We don't know. The time of Master's return is never fixed. His last departure lasted for 800 units of time.
<br><br>
But I believe he will return sooner this time."
<br><br>
"Eight hundred… how long is that?" Zen was unfamiliar with the measurement.
<br><br>
"According to the chaos' time flow rate, a unit of time equals ten thousand years," he explained calmly.
<br><br>
"What?!"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes widened at the man's nonchalant answer.
<br><br>
That meant King Manard could return after eight million years — Zen couldn't stay there anywhere near that long.
<br><br>
"You seem to be in a hurry, am I right?" Noticing Zen's worried expression, the woman asked with a smile.
<br><br>
"I am! I have something urgent to deal with in the chaos. Is there any way to leave?" Zen's anxiety was pouring into his voice at this point.
<br><br>
The woman only shook her head. "No. But perhaps Master can help you."
<br><br>
"Is there any way to inform your master that I've arrived?" he asked further.
<br><br>
For a moment, the man and woman exchanged a curious glance before the man said, "Of course. Master told us that if a human was exiled to this place, we could report it to him."
<br><br>
At that, Zen's eyes lit up. "Can you inform him right now?"
<br><br>
After a moment of thought, the man nodded. "Alright. Follow me."
<br><br>
An ancient gate lay behind the palace. Once they entered the gate with Zen, they arrived at the edge of this world — a wall covered with black fluff.
<br><br>
The wall seemed to go on endlessly. They couldn't see its end from either direction.
<br><br>
All creatures, regardless of size, would feel powerless and insignificant in the face of this enormous wall.
<br><br>
Nearby was a small round cave.
<br><br>
"No words can be sent out in this place. We have to leave the place to inform Master. This is the passageway that leads outside," the man explained.
<br><br>
Looking curiously at the cave, Zen asked, "Did your master dig this cave out?"
<br><br>
"Yes. Master started to dig this even before we were born. He spent about eight million units of time before reaching the other end and outside the chaos. Master is a persistent man!"
<br><br>
Eight million units of time… that meant eighty billion years. 'That's a terribly long time, ' Zen thought.
<br><br>
"I can't believe someone actually managed to dig through the chaos…" the Regal Jade Spirit muttered in astonishment in Zen's mind.
<br><br>
"I can't believe it either…" remarked No. 9527.
<br><br>
The two had a far greater understanding of the chaos than Zen did and yet even they agreed that digging all the way out of the chaos was something unheard of.
<br><br>
Chapter 3441 The Abstruse Energy State No matter how prosperous the chaos was, it was impossible to avoid the needle.
<br><br>
All the creatures would be annihilated.
<br><br>
This wasn't a disaster, something nobody had seen. It had, in fact, been predestined since the chaos was born.
<br><br>
Only one thing could prevent this from happening: turning into creatures on the Other Shore and hiding there.
<br><br>
In the long history of the chaos, each creature had the same fate.
<br><br>
They either entered the Other Shore or they died. They could try to become the Sons of Truth but their chances were remote. Besides, they would still die after two rounds of chaos.
<br><br>
A number of creatures and talents had tried all kinds of methods.
<br><br>
Escaping from the chaos was the easiest and the most direct way.
<br><br>
Countless civilizations had come into existence and declined, but no one had ever succeeded.
<br><br>
And now, King Manard was hiding in this space to avoid death when the end arrived. He had even broken through the chaos. The shock that No.
<br><br>
9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit felt couldn't be described in mere words.
<br><br>
It didn't matter if they believed it or not. It was an undeniable fact. They hoped Zen could explore the cave and find more.
<br><br>
The handsome man and the enchanting woman entered the cave first, Zen following close behind.
<br><br>
The wall of the cave was covered with a kind of dense brown material that was neither rock nor soil. Zen reached out, pressing gently on the wall and releasing the Other Shore Power within him.
<br><br>
But there was no reaction. The material was so solid that it was almost impossible to separate it from the cave wall.
<br><br>
The man noticed Zen's move and smiled before saying, "It's impossible to break this wall. Our master has said that no one can leave a single trace on it even if they are to use a million divine megatons of force."
<br><br>
Zen's jaw dropped.
<br><br>
He remained speechless for a while before he found his voice. "How solid is this wall?" he asked.
<br><br>
"It's not a matter of solidity. Our master has said that this wall can never be damaged," the woman said.
<br><br>
"Then how did your master dig through this?" Zen asked, exasperated.
<br><br>
"He has his own ways," the man said with pride.
<br><br>
The man and the woman never stopped talking about their master.
<br><br>
Zen gave up testing the strength of the cave wall and went ahead with them.
<br><br>
The length of this cave was beyond Zen's imagination. It stretched for dozens of miles into the distance even though it wasn't that high. It didn't take him much effort to climb, but it took him four hours to reach the end of the cave.
<br><br>
When they reached the end of the cave, Zen, No. 9527, and the Regal Jade Spirit looked around.
<br><br>
"Is this the world outside the chaos?"
<br><br>
A starry sky had appeared before Zen.
<br><br>
The light spots, close or far, were bright blue.
<br><br>
According to the man and the woman, this world was mysterious. But all Zen could see was an empty space filled with stars.
<br><br>
The man laughed and said, "No. It's not like what you see. Try putting your hand out of this cave."
<br><br>
Zen looked at him strangely before putting his hand out of the cave.
<br><br>
A strange scene appeared.
<br><br>
The moment his fingers left the cave, they turned into countless star lights and spread out in all directions.
<br><br>
The further Zen extended his hand, the farther away the star lights became from each other. And when he slowly withdrew his hand, all the star lights gathered at the entrance of the cave.
<br><br>
The scattered star lights returned to him once he withdrew his hand.
<br><br>
"Wow! It's so amazing!" Zen exclaimed, awed.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't felt anything odd throughout. His hand had turned into star lights but he hadn't felt pain. Instead, he had felt the touch, bright and sharp.
<br><br>
The man and woman weren't surprised at Zen's reaction.
<br><br>
The woman also stretched out her hand and waved it around. At her movement, the star lights that had spread out began to dance in the air.
<br><br>
"I'll go out and have a look," said Zen, standing up.
<br><br>
He had just turned to leave when a voice called out to him.
<br><br>
"Stop!"
<br><br>
The man and the woman were taken aback at Zen's actions and they made to block his path.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
The man said, "My master has told me that this is the Abstruse Energy State. It's okay for some parts of your body to enter the Abstruse Energy State. But if your whole body does, you will never find a way to return. You will have to live in this state forever."
<br><br>
Zen gasped at this information. The world outside the chaos was really something else.
<br><br>
What was before him was not the void, but a special state. Substances within it were presented in a different way, and space and time had undergone unimaginable changes.
<br><br>
"Then how can your master and the others get in?" Zen asked again.
<br><br>
"He has his own ways. If you really want to see what's outside, you can poke your head out and we will pull you back after five minutes," the woman suggested.
<br><br>
The man and the woman didn't dare to enter the space outside the chaos.
<br><br>
But they had been curious and they had used this method to observe the space.
<br><br>
"Good idea!"
<br><br>
Zen said, nodding. He leaned out while the man held his legs behind him.
<br><br>
The moment Zen's head emerged from the cave, it also turned into countless bright blue star lights. As more and more parts of his head emerged, the star lights began to spread quickly.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't felt anything strange until this moment.
<br><br>
As he craned his head, he felt everything go black. He couldn't see anything anymore.
<br><br>
Instead, he felt a different kind of feeling course through him.
<br><br>
Zen had never experienced this feeling before. In this void, everything around him had merged into nothingness. He was the only star in it.
<br><br>
The distance became infinitely long yet remained infinitely short. No matter how vast the space was, he could touch any end of it. And no matter how short the distance was, he could not reach it.
<br><br>
Time instantly sped up with his thoughts. Billions of years passed with one thought, but the next moment, it seemed like only an instant had passed.
<br><br>
Zen could not describe this feeling.
<br><br>
Just as the man and the woman had said, he couldn't see the chaos or find the cave in such a state. Even his physical sense had disappeared completely.
<br><br>
If he was reckless and rushed in, he would probably be permanently lost in this state.
<br><br>
Zen had lost all sense of time and felt like countless years had passed in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
As the star lights rotated, Zen was pulled back into the cave, familiar sights appearing back in front of his eyes.
<br><br>
Chapter 3442 Rejecting The Other Races Zen returned to the cave in a daze.
<br><br>
He was still adjusting after returning from the Abstruse Energy State.
<br><br>
"How do you feel?" the handsome man asked with a smile.
<br><br>
The enchanting woman was not surprised at Zen's reaction. She had expected it.
<br><br>
The first time they ventured into the outside of the chaos, they had the same reaction.
<br><br>
It was a long time before Zen could respond.
<br><br>
He looked at the void outside the chaos, his face inscrutable. "So, those light dots are actually the other things in the space?"
<br><br>
The man nodded. "My master once said that all things scattered there.
<br><br>
Maybe one of the light spots is a part of my master's body."
<br><br>
The light dots were spread outside the chaos, indistinct from each other.
<br><br>
Zen only needed to experience it once to understand that it would be futile to judge the size and distance of the void.
<br><br>
"Zen, let me see!"
<br><br>
"I want to try it, too!"
<br><br>
No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit pleaded.
<br><br>
When Zen had poked his head out, the two had been hiding in his body.
<br><br>
They weren't able to follow him out.
<br><br>
So now they were also very curious about the void outside the chaos.
<br><br>
Zen thought for a moment. He answered with his consciousness, "Hide yourselves in my right arm."
<br><br>
After the consciousness of the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 burrowed into Zen's arm, he extended his right hand outside the cave.
<br><br>
Just like before, his right hand turned into light dots and quickly spread out.
<br><br>
This time, the consciousnesses of No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit spread along with them.
<br><br>
While letting the two observe the Abstruse Energy State, Zen turned to the man. "Since your master is out there, how can you pass the news to him and ask him to return?"
<br><br>
The woman pointed to the edge of the cave where long and thin ropes were nailed. Complicated runes were painted on the surface of each rope.
<br><br>
There were a total of thirteen ropes. Most parts of the ropes extended outside the chaos, leaving only finger-long sections in the cave. Zen hadn't noticed them before.
<br><br>
"My master and his other disciples have tied themselves to the ropes. We can reach them using these," the woman said.
<br><br>
'There are thirteen ropes, so thirteen people are out. By using the ropes, they don't get lost in the void. King Manard is really smart, ' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
The woman raised her hand gently. Three energy beams, red, yellow and blue, spiraled up from her palm.
<br><br>
Zen had seen two of the energy beams before. One was the blue light from the big-eyed little monsters. The other was the red bubble from the doubleheaded flying snakes. It was his first time to see the yellow energy.
<br><br>
Zen was told that King Manard kept three races in the space. He presumed it was the third race that used the yellow energy.
<br><br>
Buzz! The three energy beams merged into a ball. The woman thrust it onto the runes of one of the ropes. The runes then lit up one after another, spreading all the way to the void outside the chaos. They turned into light spots and flew quickly away.
<br><br>
It seemed that this mysterious void wasn't so unfathomable after all. King Manard had found ways to work with it.
<br><br>
Zen withdrew his hand from outside of the cave, bringing No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit back inside.
<br><br>
"…" No. 9527 was rendered speechless.
<br><br>
"…" The Regal Jade Spirit was left dumbfounded, too.
<br><br>
One used to be a Son of Truth, while the other was a splinter of the soul of the Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
Suffice to say, both of them had been through a lot. They knew many secrets unknown to most.
<br><br>
However, the Abstruse Energy State still left them shocked and shaken to the core.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit, in particular, had never imagined that this space, which was previously under his control, could lead outside of the chaos and to something so incredible.
<br><br>
Zen didn't need to ask them for their reaction. "How long will we have to wait after we send word to your master?" he asked the man.
<br><br>
The man thought for a moment. "It's hard to say. Sometimes he takes his time to return, having been in space for too long. Sometimes he comes back quickly. It depends on his mood."
<br><br>
The woman nodded. "Once, a golden-faced ghost was exiled here. It owned a very unique Other Shore Token, so both of us could not defeat it. In the end, we could only flee into this cave and ask our master to come back. At that time, our master returned in only a few seconds to subdue the goldenfaced ghost."
<br><br>
"It all depends on how willing he is to return. If he takes you seriously, he returns instantly." As the man said this, stars appeared in the distance outside, approaching the entrance of the cave.
<br><br>
The woman pouted. "It seems you have our master's attention."
<br><br>
King Manard usually only appeared when his disciples were in great danger.
<br><br>
But not long after she relayed Zen's news, here was King Manard, already coming back. She felt a little jealous.
<br><br>
Buzz! More and more light dots gathered at the entrance of the cave. The dots started to converge into a vague human form. As soon as it entered the cave, it materialized into a man with a curly beard. He looked exactly the same as the statue that Zen saw on the small star.
<br><br>
"Master!"
<br><br>
"Master!"
<br><br>
The woman and the man respectfully bowed to King Manard.
<br><br>
King Manard nodded and let his eyes settle upon Zen. He scrutinized Zen from head to toe, raising a brow.
<br><br>
"Nice to meet you, sir!" Zen said, likewise bowing to King Manard.
<br><br>
King Manard didn't greet him in return. Instead, his eyes fell on Zen's right hand. "There are two souls of other races in your body. Show yourselves! If you're here to spy on me, don't blame me for wiping out your consciousness!"
<br><br>
The woman and the man grew nervous at their master's words.
<br><br>
They knew King Manard only acknowledged the human race, rejecting other races with extreme prejudice.
<br><br>
Some of the creatures from other races that had been exiled to this space had been innocent. Many of them had fallen to their knees and begged to be spared.
<br><br>
But King Manard showed no mercy to the alien creatures in this space. He left none of them alive. He had ordered his disciples to be as ruthless.
<br><br>
And so it came to pass that the woman and the man killed countless creatures of different races, developing an instinctive repulsion for them.
<br><br>
After all these years, Zen was the only one they had kept alive.
<br><br>
Chapter 3443 Another Other Shore Zen's expression changed. There was a troubled look on his face when he heard King Manard's unfriendly tone.
<br><br>
"Sir, they are both my friends..."
<br><br>
He began trying to explain, but was interrupted when King Manard said, "Whoever they are, they need to show up. No one spies on me in secret! Show yourselves or you will force my hands!"
<br><br>
If Zen hadn't been concerned in this matter, King Manard would have slain No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit without a moment's hesitation.
<br><br>
The only reason he was restraining himself was that Zen was a human.
<br><br>
Even so, the fact that No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit were spying on him in secret was an unbearably infuriating thought for him.
<br><br>
Fortunately, No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit immediately turned into two human shaped soul forms, one glowing with a cyan aura and the other one in brown. They put their hands together and bowed to King Manard.
<br><br>
"We have been staying inside Zen's body for a long time, and never showed ourselves to anyone till date. We didn't mean to spy on you. Please forgive us," the Regal Jade Spirit humbly apologized.
<br><br>
King Manard glanced at him and then suddenly smiled. "I'm familiar with your aura. You used to be in charge of this space. You were a Son of Truth of the Regal Jade Civilization. Have I got that right?"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit nodded with a helpless smile. "You have supernatural power. I didn't sense you hiding here!"
<br><br>
"If you could detect my presence that easily, I wouldn't be alive today,"
<br><br>
King Manard smiled with a satisfied expression.
<br><br>
This space worked in a mysterious way. Every once in a while, everything in here was destroyed for good. This place was often regarded as the garden of the Son of Truth. And no human would ever be allowed to live here! The Regal Jade Spirit replied, "The theurgies you utilized to break through the walls of the chaos and explore the outside void are impressive. If you could reveal the secrets of this void, we, the Regal Jade Civilization, would be happy to get along with you. That being the case, why would we consider you our enemy?"
<br><br>
However, King Manard's expressions didn't change. "You might see it that way, but your civilization would still take me as their enemy. They might not share your thoughts. Things on the Other Shore are extremely complicated. You, as a lone Son of Truth, couldn't make that decision by yourself!"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit didn't know what to say. And to be honest, if he really had sensed King Manard's existence in the past, he would have killed him! "Never mind that," King Manard took a long breath and continued, "What's important is that I have managed to survive. And now, even if some Sons of Truth have mastered the space truth, they are not the rulers in this space!"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit was surprised to hear this. "Do you mean that even the Sons of Truth cannot control this space?"
<br><br>
"Of course that's what I am saying," King Manard arrogantly confirmed.
<br><br>
"The spaces they delete can be found here, but it's impossible to retrieve these spaces back. They can't even look at what's going on inside this space.
<br><br>
I've deprived them of that right in here."
<br><br>
His offhand way of saying that he had deprived the Sons of Truth their right was as if he were merely discussing the weather.
<br><br>
But Zen, the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 were extremely shocked when they heard that.
<br><br>
This was a rule based on the truth. Who could break the truth of the chaos so easily? Zen's eyes lit up. Although he was shocked, he also had an idea. "If you have deprived the Sons of Truth of their right, can you also send me out?"
<br><br>
King Manard glanced at Zen and asked, "Are you in a hurry to go back?"
<br><br>
"Yes." Zen nodded, pursing his lips.
<br><br>
King Manard knew very well that most of the creatures that had been sent into this space had somehow managed to offend the Sons of Truth.
<br><br>
However, most of the opponents of the Sons of Truth were extremely strong creatures, and King Manard didn't believe Zen was strong enough to qualify for that.
<br><br>
"Take your time," King Manard said. "Yes. I can help you find the time node. No matter how much time has passed since you got here, I will be able to send you back at that time node."
<br><br>
"Locate a specific time node?!"
<br><br>
Hearing that, the two inhabitants of Zen's body were shocked again.
<br><br>
A small world was easy to control.
<br><br>
If the world in question was someone's inner world, then as its omnipotent creator, it wouldn't be difficult for them to control the time flow rate and even use the Time Backing in that world.
<br><br>
However, an inner world with messy timelines was not easy to control.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, nobody was ever willing to mess up the timelines of their inner worlds unless absolutely necessary. Time was a powerful entity and changing or editing it could cause chaos! In the countless universes, most of the Holy Beings, and even some of the world lords had the power to change time, or even adjust its flow rate.
<br><br>
However, in the divine land, such abilities had become extremely rare and precious.
<br><br>
In the Source World and the chaos, it was almost completely impossible to change and control time by directly practicing the theurgies.
<br><br>
Almost no one could surpass the time truth unless they had the help of some very powerful Other Shore Tokens, which were extremely limited in number.
<br><br>
As for the time truth, it was impossible for even the Chaos Ancient Gods to master it! Therefore, when King Manard said that he could locate a time node and send Zen back, they were all shocked.
<br><br>
"That would be amazing!" Zen's face was filled with intense joy at the chance of possible return.
<br><br>
King Manard glanced outside the cave. He returned alone this time. The twelve disciples kept on floating outside the chaos. He then said, "Let's go back to the palace first."
<br><br>
Together, the group soon made their way to the palace that had been built on the Deleting Pillars.
<br><br>
On their way, King Manard asked Zen a bit about the situation of the chaos, and the latter told him about the several human forces as well as some of the super forces in the Source World.
<br><br>
When he heard that the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had joined forces to exterminate the Nine Li race, King Manard frowned. He sighed, "I didn't expect the human forces to kill each other!"
<br><br>
In the time of the King Manard, the human civilization was a united group.
<br><br>
As a ruling force, it occupied the entire chaos, and no internal conflict was even heard of.
<br><br>
They had always been united, to the very last possible moment.
<br><br>
And from the way King Manard detested the other races, it was crystal clear how much he cared about the human race. He had never expected that the newborn human race in the chaos would fall into such a complicated situation. It was heartbreaking for him to hear such news.
<br><br>
"With your great theurgies, you will be able to end the dispute if you return to the chaos," Zen suddenly said.
<br><br>
"Return to the chaos?" King Manard shook his head in a disappointed manner.
<br><br>
"Didn't you tell us that you have taken complete control over this space and can retrieve everything from within it?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
A trace of helplessness appeared on the face of King Manard. He pointed to No. 9527's soul and said, "This one can return to the chaos, and so can you."
<br><br>
Then he pointed to the Regal Jade Spirit and continued, "But can he return as well?"
<br><br>
Although No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit had turned into human souls, they were still quite different from each other.
<br><br>
No. 9527 was a real strand of a soul, while the Regal Jade Spirit had appeared in the chaos after Zen had merged with the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
In fact, his body was still on the Other Shore. He was in a descending state.
<br><br>
"You mean..." Zen's eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
King Manard pointed at the ruins in the distance and said, "The chaos that belongs to us has already gone. We can't return to the chaos. Even if we do return, we can only return in the form of an Other Shore Token. Or, to put it shortly, you can treat this space as another Other Shore."
<br><br>
Chapter 3444 The Former Glory Once a round of chaos was destroyed, the rules of the new chaos would suppress everything from the last chaos.
<br><br>
Creatures, objects, and even consciousness would be rejected.
<br><br>
All creatures, except the Chaos Ancient Gods who had comprehended the truth, had to enter the Other Shore to save their lives. That was the only way.
<br><br>
The space where King Manard lived was separated from the chaos. It was true that he could avoid the Deleting Pillars and control this space. But he could only hide in there, just like the creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
"Another Other Shore..." Zen muttered, his eyebrows rising.
<br><br>
No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit were taken aback. They had always only seen this space as a recycle bin. But this space could avoid being involved in the extinction of the chaos. It was indeed another Other Shore.
<br><br>
A smile appeared on King Manard's face as he said, "I actually plan to turn this place into another Other Shore that belongs only to the human race.
<br><br>
Other races won't be allowed to enter it!"
<br><br>
The Other Shore was complicated. There were not only a number of Souls of Light, but also different kinds of creatures.
<br><br>
How terrifying would it be if a race were able to occupy the Other Shore? What an ambitious man King Manard was! This news was good for the human race, of course. Zen thought for a moment before asking, "But how do the creatures in the chaos enter this space?"
<br><br>
Mount and the Chaos Ancient God behind him controlled the entrance to this space. King Manard couldn't make sure that the Chaos Ancient God was on his side.
<br><br>
King Manard asked calmly, "How do the creatures in the chaos enter the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
"By cultivating the Truth of Godly Way, of course," replied Zen without hesitation.
<br><br>
No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit exchanged a nervous glance. They had a premonition.
<br><br>
A sudden thought occurred to Zen. "Is there a Truth of Godly Way that can bring the creatures here?"
<br><br>
King Manard smiled meaningfully. He reached out a hand, and the red, yellow, and blue energies spiraled upwards. "I have devoted my life to this Truth of Godly Way. I name it the Truth of Three-energy Construction."
<br><br>
"You created a Truth of Godly Way?" No. 9527's eyebrows were arched in supercilious surprise.
<br><br>
"How is that possible?" The Regal Jade Spirit also looked confused.
<br><br>
Everything they had seen and heard today was against what they had learned over the years.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit knew more than No. 9527. He had been the one to spread all the Sanskrit words from the Other Shore. The thirteen Truths of Godly Ways should have been created by the first civilization.
<br><br>
Special Other Shore Tokens were often discovered, but no one had ever created any Truth of Godly Way! King Manard mixed the three kinds of energy and turned them into a single ball of black energy.
<br><br>
As the black energy rolled forward, it came to a stop after turning into a stone statue shaped like a horse's head.
<br><br>
"Void construction!" Zen's eyes twitched in excitement.
<br><br>
Void construction was supposed to be accomplished in one's inner world.
<br><br>
But King Manard had made a stone statue by taking advantage of the Truth of Three-energy Construction.
<br><br>
His actions had shocked Zen, No. 9527, and the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
A resounding crack sounded.
<br><br>
King Manard had pinched the statue of the horse head gently and crushed it into pieces. He said, "The thirteen Truths of Godly Ways were created by the Instant Civilization, but the Element Spirit Civilization had emasculated all of them. They have lost their corresponding theurgies. When we fought a bloody battle with the Element Spirit Civilization in Stage Thirty Two, the Element Spirit race had suffered a great loss. Since then, all the Truths of Godly Ways have lost their corresponding power."
<br><br>
"The human race used to be so powerful? They fought against the Element Spirit Civilization?" The Regal Jade Spirit was even more surprised.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization had been strong, but not strong enough to fight the Element Spirit Civilization. The Regal Jade Spirit had never expected the human race to be this glorious on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
But the 77th civilization was countless years away from the 749th civilization. After the human race had been defeated and went into their hiding, their legends had disappeared. It wasn't surprising that the Regal Jade Spirit had never heard of them.
<br><br>
The corner of King Manard's mouth curled upwards. He didn't respond to the Regal Jade Spirit. The previous human race had certainly not been a small and weak race.
<br><br>
Zen thought for a moment before asking, "The Truths of Godly Ways were emasculated?"
<br><br>
King Manard smiled and looked at Zen. "What's wrong?" he said. "Did you notice it?"
<br><br>
Zen shook his head and said, "No. When I practiced the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, I accidentally got two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment, which were able to complete the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. I wonder if these two Sanskrit words belong to the emasculated part."
<br><br>
King Manard stared at Zen. "Show me what you've got," he said.
<br><br>
Zen nodded, closed his eyes, and meditated, reciting in silence.
<br><br>
Soon, a white cyclone emerged in Zen's brain. He hadn't learned many words of the Truth Enlightenment but he was able to easily create this cyclone.
<br><br>
The moment King Manard saw the cyclone, he nodded and said, "You can stop."
<br><br>
"Is this the emasculated part?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
King Manard nodded. "You could say that. Someone has deliberately released the Truth Enlightenment that you are talking about."
<br><br>
Once Eastern Emperor Taiyi got the yellow paper, he deciphered and learned the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent from it. He then built the base of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Only Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew how he got the yellow paper, whether he had come upon it by accident or someone had given it to him.
<br><br>
"Have the emasculated parts of any other Truths of Godly Ways apart from the Truth Enlightenment been passed down?" King Manard asked.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "I've never heard of it."
<br><br>
King Manard looked at No. 9527. No. 9527 replied, "No."
<br><br>
"The thirteen Truths of Godly Ways of the 749th civilization must have been incomplete as well," the Regal Jade Spirit replied.
<br><br>
A thought crossed Zen's mind and he said, "It's not just that. We can't practice the Truth of Powerful Holy Body now. It's impossible to use the physical body to enter the Other Shore."
<br><br>
"The Truth of Powerful Holy Body is prohibited?" At this news, King Manard was plunged deep in thought. It was a while before he smiled and said, "Those hiding on the Other Shore began to be afraid."
<br><br>
The human race had never been weak. It was precisely to see this day that they had been hiding themselves for so many years.
<br><br>
"But if you want to build this place into an Other Shore, where can we find the Other Shore Tokens? How can we obtain the Other Shore Power?" Zen asked again, confused.
<br><br>
King Manard pointed to the void in the distance and said, "The Other Shore Tokens are over there."
<br><br>
There were many remains floating in the air.
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Zen, No. 9527, and the Regal Jade Spirit were rendered speechless.
<br><br>
It was a strange sight, the remains floating in the air. It was stranger that King Manard believed that these remains were Other Shore Tokens. But they had to take him at his word.
<br><br>
Chapter 3445 The Strongest Finale Way It wouldn't have been difficult for King Manard to remove these remains with this place under his full control.
<br><br>
But he left them here for the purpose of using them as Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
"But these remains don't have energy or Other Shore Power. They would have no complicated power," Zen pointed out.
<br><br>
There were two factors to determine an Other Shore Token's value.
<br><br>
They were whether or not it had strong Other Shore Power, and whether or not it had a unique ability.
<br><br>
The stronger the Other Shore Power was, the stronger its bearer would be.
<br><br>
The power of Other Shore Tokens of the mysterious type tended to not be as strong, but they often had unusual abilities. For example, the Heart of Accomplice was able to forcibly end the lives of both the user and another powerful warrior. No other token could do this.
<br><br>
King Manard ambled forward, his hands behind his back. He gazed out into the void. "It's almost impossible for them to use the Other Shore Tokens to realize the Finale Way. The human race was trapped in this in the past."
<br><br>
Neither Zen nor No. 9527 could understand, but the eyes of the Regal Jade Spirit flashed.
<br><br>
After all, the Regal Jade Civilization had once been a ruling force and had also confronted the needle in hopes to realize the Finale Way.
<br><br>
"You mean it's impossible to realize the Finale Way by relying on the strength of the Other Shore?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked.
<br><br>
King Manard shot the Regal Jade Spirit an unexpected admiring look.
<br><br>
"Among so many civilizations, the human race came the closest. We very nearly achieved it."
<br><br>
"You almost made it?" The Regal Jade Spirit's eyes flashed strangely. "Our Wing King had merged with the Invisible Spirit Herb from Stage Thirty Three. He used the Trial Lamp to reflect about a thousand more Invisible Spirit Herbs and extracted the Other Shore Power within them. After that, he increased the Other Shore Power by thirty times with the help of the Withering Power and combined it with the Spectral Thunder Shield, but he still failed. He almost made it, too."
<br><br>
As the strongest warrior in the Regal Jade Civilization, the Wing King was chosen as the Finale Hero.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization had gathered all the Other Shore Tokens they had and released the most powerful forces they could muster to fight off the needle.
<br><br>
The Invisible Spirit Herb was a kind of herb without a root that grew in the depths of Stage Thirty Three. It looked ordinary, but in fact, the Other Shore Power contained in it was stronger than that of any others! The Trial Lamp was also a rare Other Shore Token. It was a sixth-grade Other Shore Token in Stage Thirty Two. The shadow of the Invisible Spirit Herb that the Trial Lamp reflected was able to inherit half of the Other Shore Power of the Invisible Spirit Herb. If a thousand Invisible Spirit Herbs were reflected, their power would have increased to five hundred times! Zen had used the Withering Power before. It was a Latent Theurgy passed down from the Nine Li race. But the power of the Latent Theurgy was naturally weaker than the Withering Power used by the Wing King and other strong cultivators.
<br><br>
Five hundred was then multiplied by thirty. The exponentially increased Other Shore Power must have been overwhelming.
<br><br>
This was the Finale Way of the Wing King.
<br><br>
Zen was astounded by the Regal Jade Spirit's story. He tried to imagine just how strong the Finale Way released by the Wing King was.
<br><br>
However strong it was, that power was still unable to subdue the needle! The Wing King was the leader of the Regal Jade Civilization. Although the civilization had been destroyed, the Regal Jade Spirit was still very proud of him.
<br><br>
The Finale Way of the Regal Jade Civilization must have been extremely powerful for the Wing King to get that far.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization had not been weak on the Other Shore. It was one of the top ten civilizations in the past.
<br><br>
King Manard shook his head at the Regal Jade Spirit's words. "You must have been very good at collecting Other Shore Tokens, for you to have obtained the Trial Lamp and the Spectral Thunder Shield."
<br><br>
"Thank you." The Regal Jade Spirit felt appeased that his civilization was recognized for its efforts, even if their king failed in the end.
<br><br>
"It's not a compliment. You were still quite far from realizing the Finale Way. Merging with the Invisible Spirit Herb and increasing its strength by the Trial Lamp and the Withering Power was only one of our alternatives.
<br><br>
The last Other Shore Token we used was not the Spectral Thunder Shield, but the Magic Shield with a stronger defensive capability.
<br><br>
Back then, we chose ten persons to be the Finale Heroes. The one who adopted this plan similar to yours was only in eighth place among those who came close to success," added King Manard, shaking his head.
<br><br>
"Only eighth place?!" The Regal Jade Spirit's eyes widened in disbelief.
<br><br>
"How is that possible? That was the best solution chosen by the Wing King! Nothing else came close!"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit was greatly shocked.
<br><br>
He had thought that the Finale Way of the Regal Jade Civilization had been close to success, but it turned out to be such a lowly solution.
<br><br>
Unconvinced, he pressed, "What did the person in first place use, then?"
<br><br>
"The first..." A trace of sadness appeared in King Manard's eyes. "He was our leader. He merged with the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone. The Trial Lamp couldn't reflect the Overdraft Stone, but he gave everything up, including his life. Just the combined power of the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone was much stronger than the power you obtained. The combined power was further increased by the Withering Power, and then...
<br><br>
Alas, it was a pity we failed in the end. We were so close," King Manard said, regret written on his face.
<br><br>
Perhaps feeling he had discouraged the Regal Jade Spirit too much, he added, "Actually, it was not your fault. After the human race almost completed the Finale Way, those hiding on the Other Shore grew scared.
<br><br>
After that, they set the rules, and the Other Shore was designed by them in such a way that no civilization would ever complete the Finale Way. It became a pipe dream. I guess that after the 77th civilization was destroyed, the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone were both hidden away. They might have even destroyed them."
<br><br>
No. 9527 nodded in agreement. "We haven't heard of these two tokens on the Other Shore."
<br><br>
"By their rules, the Finale Way is destined to fail, and there is no possibility of success," King Manard said firmly. "So we can't rely on that Other Shore.
<br><br>
We must create our own force!"
<br><br>
He glanced at Zen and continued, "The Other Shore Power is from outside of the chaos. We can also obtain it."
<br><br>
As he spoke, he pointed at the debris on the ground. The broken statue of horse head returned to its original condition. But the new statue seemed a little different.
<br><br>
"What do you see?" asked King Manard.
<br><br>
Zen stared at the statue and observed it carefully. After a short while, he actually felt a slight energy on the statue. It was the Other Shore Power! Chapter 3446 The Wall Of Truth Of Godly Way The Other Shore Power hidden in the statue of the horse head wasn't strong.
<br><br>
It had less than one divine megaton of force, but it was still enough to be regarded as an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
"You can endow the statue with Other Shore Power?" Zen inquired.
<br><br>
King Manard nodded and held the statue in his hand. "The Other Shore Power is not directly from me. It's from the outside of the chaos and my hand is just acting as a medium," he explained.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power was an extremely special existence. However, no one had expected that the power did not come from the chaos itself, but outside of it.
<br><br>
As King Manard gently waved his hand, the Other Shore Power that was hidden in the statue grew stronger and stronger, gradually surpassing one divine megaton.
<br><br>
"If the Other Shore Power comes from somewhere outside of the chaos, then is it possible that there's a way to exit the chaos from the Other Shore?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked as he stared closely at the statue.
<br><br>
King Manard shook his head and said, "I'm not actually sure, but you're probably right. It's just that some of the secrets are hidden deep in Stage Thirty Three. Unfortunately, we weren't able to uncover them even when we were at the height of power."
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power in the statue finally stopped increasing after reaching thirty divine megatons. "I only acquired thirty divine megatons of force from the Abstruse Energy World. Luckily, I've found some secrets in that world. My disciples and I should be making a breakthrough but it will take some time."
<br><br>
"It's difficult to search outside the chaos, isn't it?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
King Manard nodded and said, "Yes, it is indeed difficult. We are creatures born in the chaos, so we are not allowed to enter the Abstruse Energy World. Now that I think of it, the only one who might be truly suitable for that world would be the first civilization, the Instant Civilization."
<br><br>
In the Abstruse Energy World, time and space did not exist.
<br><br>
It was said that the Instant Civilization only existed promptly. Time and space were meaningless to them.
<br><br>
Then Zen remembered that the Regal Jade Spirit had once told him about the characteristics of the Instant Civilization. Upon contemplating, he realized that there might be a relationship between the two. "Is it possible that the Instant Civilization was from the Abstruse Energy World?" he blurted out.
<br><br>
"You're sharp. Yes, they were from the Abstruse Energy World."
<br><br>
The complexity of the entire chaos was far beyond Zen's imagination.
<br><br>
It was almost impossible to reveal all the secrets it contained.
<br><br>
Despite this, King Manard had told Zen many things he needed to know.
<br><br>
"What do you want me to do?" Zen asked straightforwardly.
<br><br>
Since he had been exiled into this space, his priority was to quickly find a way to get out. He didn't expect that he would be able to encounter such an opportunity during his stay.
<br><br>
Since he was already here, King Manard would need him to do something in return.
<br><br>
"If you want to return so badly, you have to meet one condition," King Manard asserted as he stared at him intently.
<br><br>
"What is it?" Zen responded without any hint of hesitation.
<br><br>
"Cultivate the Truth of Three-energy Construction. When you return to the chaos, I need you to find the human race on the Other Shore," King Manard answered.
<br><br>
He had actually waited for so long before an opportunity like Zen came along. There was no way that he would just let him go that easily.
<br><br>
King Manard was the absolute ruler of this space. Even the Chaos Ancient God, who had mastered the space truth, couldn't disobey or spy on him. In return, he was not able to leave the space.
<br><br>
He wanted Zen to cultivate the Truth of Three-energy Construction, and then Zen could freely get in and out of this space.
<br><br>
"Find the human race on the Other Shore?" A trace of confusion appeared in Zen's eyes as he asked further, "Where am I supposed to look for them?"
<br><br>
"You have to figure out this on your own. The human race in this round of chaos was not born by chance. Your very existence means that the human race on the Other Shore have already begun to take action," King Manard answered as he gave a meaningful look.
<br><br>
After saying that, he turned around and gently stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
Several golden bricks started to fall.
<br><br>
The golden bricks quickly piled up and turned into a tall wall, surrounding Zen.
<br><br>
There was an inscribed word on every golden brick, and the wall they created told the cultivation method for the Truth of Three-energy Construction.
<br><br>
"I will only send you back after you have fully comprehended the Truth of Three-energy Construction. That will be our deal." King Manard's voice resounded from the other side of the wall.
<br><br>
The golden wall also kept No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit on the other side.
<br><br>
Zen could actually teach both of them the Truth of Three-energy Construction after he had mastered it. However, King Manard detested the other races so much that he didn't allow them to observe the cultivation process of the Truth of Three-energy Construction. In fact, if he wasn't being nice to them, he might have killed them already.
<br><br>
"I don't know if I would be compatible with it," Zen muttered from inside the wall.
<br><br>
"If you can't make it in a year, do it in ten years. If you still can't do it in ten years, you have a hundred years. I can give you all the time you need to comprehend it. Even if you're not compatible with it, you'll still be able to cultivate it eventually," King Manard replied firmly.
<br><br>
Upon hearing that, Zen pursed his lips and stared at the words on the brick wall.
<br><br>
He already realized that King Manard would not let him out if he didn't master the Truth of Three-energy Construction.
<br><br>
Fortunately, King Manard was in full control of the time of this space. Zen had nothing to worry about the time he would consume before he mastered it.
<br><br>
As No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit were waiting outside, they were quietly communicating with each other through their consciousness.
<br><br>
"If Zen masters the Truth of Three-energy Construction, then he will be able to merge with the Other Shore Tokens in this space, right? If King Manard gives himself the Other Shore Power and turns himself into an Other Shore Token, he will be able to enter the chaos with Zen's help, won't he?" No. 9527 told its idea with its consciousness.
<br><br>
"That's right. But do you seriously think that a proud human like him would agree to become someone else's Other Shore Token?" the Regal Jade Spirit answered while shaking his head.
<br><br>
Even the creatures on the Other Shore thought that it was shameful to become Other Shore Tokens. A powerful being like King Manard would naturally be unwilling to become one. Perhaps, he had another idea on how he could return to the chaos.
<br><br>
"That makes more sense." No. 9527 nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
These two Sons of Truth had seldom communicated before. Although No.
<br><br>
9527 was just a strand of soul, it represented a Chaos Ancient God. The Regal Jade Spirit was also a Chaos Ancient God in the past, but he represented a civilization on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Though they shared the same goal of realizing the Finale Way, they were still always on high alert.
<br><br>
After they shared this communication, they became closer.
<br><br>
At the same time, King Manard took his two disciples back to the other side of the palace.
<br><br>
"Master, with my exceptional talent, I've still spent a year and a half to be completely well-versed in the Truth of Three-energy Construction. It will take dozens of years for Zen to achieve it, right?" the handsome man said arrogantly.
<br><br>
The Truth of Three-energy Construction was much more difficult to grasp than the incomplete Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. It was said to be a complete Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
The handsome man was a one-in-a-million talent that King Manard had personally selected. It was such a fascinating display of skill for him to master the Truth of Three-energy Construction in less than two years.
<br><br>
Chapter 3447 The Speed Of Comprehension After she heard his words, the gorgeous woman retorted with a smile. "You always boast about being the best in terms of talent. Back then, it only took me a year and a half to comprehend it!"
<br><br>
The handsome man seemed unbothered by her claims. Even though time didn't hold any value in this space, he didn't want to seem inferior to the pretty woman. "It's only because your compatibility level is higher than that of mine. If we are on par with each other in terms of compatibility level, you would never be as good as me..."
<br><br>
While the two were engrossed in a heated conversation, King Manard raised his hand and said, "I'll take my leave now. I have to cultivate in seclusion during this period. Inform me after he finishes comprehending the Truth of Three-Energy Construction."
<br><br>
"But Master, when will you take us to the Abstruse Energy World?" the handsome man suddenly asked.
<br><br>
Since the handsome man and the pretty woman were tossed into this space, they were unable to join the other disciples. Naturally, they felt frustrated since they were the only ones left out.
<br><br>
However, King Manard casually posed the question to him. "Have you deciphered the Sanskrit words I gave you?"
<br><br>
Both of their faces reflected a hint of disappointment as they turned their gaze away without a response.
<br><br>
The Abstruse Energy World had certain rules, and the rules were related to the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Every light spot contained innumerable groups of words, and the form of expression was similar to the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
The Instant Civilization originated from the Abstruse Energy World. Since they were well acquainted with it, the Sanskrit words created by them were the replica of the words of the Abstruse Energy World.
<br><br>
King Manard was highly skilled in deciphering the Sanskrit words, and his other twelve disciples could be said to be on the same level as him. They had studied the rules of the Abstruse Energy World through deciphering the Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
If the handsome man and the pretty woman desired to enter the Abstruse Energy World, they had to have a sound understanding of the Sanskrit words, at least to a certain extent.
<br><br>
However, in the present, they still had a ways to go before they could be able to do that.
<br><br>
After the question, King Manard turned around and entered the inner hall alone.
<br><br>
King Manard's words of wisdom to Zen stated that everything could be dealt with easily. However, his words had contradicted with his reality. He, too, had to encounter many difficulties in his path before he could reach his goal.
<br><br>
Back then, in the Abstruse Energy World, he had stumbled upon something that had the form of a mountain with his disciples. It was obvious the mountain was gathered by innumerable spots of light.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power was obtained from the mountain.
<br><br>
Had it been a normal world, they would have easily split the entire mountain open to see what was inside.
<br><br>
However, the rules of the Abstruse Energy World were differed from that of the other worlds, and even the cognitions were different. Eventually, King Manard and his disciples were forced to lower their curiosities. They could only wander on the surface of it and were denied entry to the inside. Alas, they only obtained a small amount of Other Shore Power from a corner of the mountain...
<br><br>
Breaking through the mountain was a more difficult task than he had imagined it to be. This time, King Manard cultivated in seclusion to have a more clear understanding of the rules attached to the mountain.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the handsome man and the pretty woman both walked out of the palace while sulking under their breaths.
<br><br>
"The Sanskrit words that Master passed down to us are too hard to decipher.
<br><br>
He hasn't even given us any hint on how to do it. It's simply impossible for us to decipher them on our own," the handsome man complained, his arms crossed tightly near his chest.
<br><br>
"He said it only took three years for his first disciple to decipher those Sanskrit words. I couldn't believe it!" the pretty woman exclaimed with her fists clenched.
<br><br>
The Sanskrit words were placed somewhere in the palace. Before Zen's arrival, the handsome man and the pretty woman were occupied with managing the creatures of this space and comprehending the Sanskrit words. When their gaze fell upon Zen, they immediately left everything to focus on him instead, since they had fallen victim to their boredom due to the tedious routine.
<br><br>
Instead of biding their time and deciphering the Sanskrit words, they turned all their attention towards Zen while he cultivated the Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
Upon returning to the center of the palace, they overheard Zen reciting inside the wall.
<br><br>
"Getting punished for creating things; heaven and earth should be destroyed…"
<br><br>
The handsome man blinked slightly as if mesmerized, and his face turned a serious color. "He seems to have recited more than eight hundred words."
<br><br>
"What? That's impossible! You must have heard it wrong." As if shocked, the pretty woman paced to his side and pricked up her ears to eavesdrop.
<br><br>
While she listened intently, her expression quickly switched.
<br><br>
They had left for only a short while, and Zen had already progressed to almost one thousand words.
<br><br>
Even though the handsome man excelled in talents, his compatibility level was low. He recalled when he read the Truth of Godly Way for the first time, he had only managed to recite a thousand words. Knowing Zen read out one thousand in one go without any difficulty made him shocked to his core.
<br><br>
They remained rooted to their positions and kept listening from the other side. Zen recited in a low voice, almost like a whisper.
<br><br>
Thirty seconds had passed, and Zen had already broken through to a thousand words.
<br><br>
"It seems the boy's comprehension far surpasses yours." The pretty woman giggled as she nudged him teasingly. "I think he can cultivate the Truth of Three-energy Construction within two years."
<br><br>
The handsome man scoffed and rolled his eyes after he heard her claims.
<br><br>
"Nonsense. I don't think so!"
<br><br>
As Zen continued to recite, he had reached two thousand words.
<br><br>
Soon as she kept listening to Zen, the pretty woman's radiant face lost its usual color. She always had the satisfaction of being superior to the handsome man in terms of cultivating the Truth of Godly Way. However, it now seemed that Zen was likely to beat her record of reciting two thousand words in her first try! Five minutes after, Zen had recited two thousand words without pause.
<br><br>
But he didn't stop there, and he reached three thousand words, four thousand words, and then five thousand words...
<br><br>
It was Zen's first attempt to cultivate the Truth of Three-energy Construction. He didn't stop until he reached eight thousand words in one go.
<br><br>
Zen, who sat inside the wall, heaved a long sigh of relief as he regained his breath.
<br><br>
His compatibility level of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was perfect, and he had comprehended the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent through Instant Enlightenment.
<br><br>
Now, it seemed his compatibility level of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was also high. After all, he had managed to recite eight thousand words in one breath. It was much less complex than cultivating the Truth of Goodwill and Malice and the Truth of Cultivation Nature.
<br><br>
But Zen was not satisfied with this progress. He didn't feel complacent.
<br><br>
After all, the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was a complete Truth of Godly Way. The first ten thousand words would pose as no challenge for him, but the last part that was similar to the Truth Enlightenment would be much severe in the level of difficulty it inculcated.
<br><br>
Even for someone like Zen, comprehending the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was a task that required a lot of effort.
<br><br>
However, the fruits it bore were worth it. The power of the Truth of ThreeEnergy Construction was boundless.
<br><br>
The soul level of the three kinds of energy in it was exceedingly high.
<br><br>
When those little monsters and double-headed snakes used it, their power had increased to a frightening level. If those three energies were to be combined, their strength would go beyond comprehension...
<br><br>
According to King Manard's words, the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was a product of his creation. However, Zen harbored doubts in his heart against that statement. He strongly felt that the Truth of Godly Way must have been obtained in the Abstruse Energy World. It was apparent his thoughts contradicted with the fact that King Manard had created it.
<br><br>
Zen continued, oblivious to the fact that the pretty woman and the handsome man had their anticipating eyes glued to the wall. They wore expressions of bewilderment.
<br><br>
He had recited eight thousand words on his first day, which was equivalent to sixty percent of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. Did this guy really come from the chaos? According to what King Manard had told them, anyone who existed in the chaos lacked strength. They were practically worthless.
<br><br>
Of course, King Manard knew full well not to underestimate the talents that resided in the chaos. Even though he handpicked the most outstanding talents from his inner world to be his disciples, the chaos was much bigger than his inner world and contained more talents. But to practice high morale and confidence in his disciples, he had to belittle the creatures in the chaos to make them feel superior.
<br><br>
However, the appearance of Zen and the small spectacle of his talents had exposed King Manard's white lie out in the open. Naturally, the handsome man and the pretty woman hung their heads in crippling depression as they had believed the lie to be true the entire time.
<br><br>
If King Manard was not their master, they would have apprehended and interrogated him by now.
<br><br>
The very next day, Zen had managed to comprehend over nine thousand and nine hundred words of the Truth of Three-energy Construction.
<br><br>
On the third day, he broke through to ten thousand words.
<br><br>
Just as Zen had concluded, after he reached ten thousand words, the difficulty of comprehension increased significantly.
<br><br>
Chapter 3448 The Principle Of Construction During those times when Zen was staying in the Oneness Sky Palace, he didn't spend much time understanding the Truth Enlightenment. In any case, his comprehension speed was not that fast.
<br><br>
But right now, it was impossible for him to leave this place without thoroughly comprehending the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
Knowing that this was a crucial process, Zen calmed himself down and decided to complete this task as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Days turned into a week while Zen was concentrating hard on his task.
<br><br>
Before long, twenty one days had already passed.
<br><br>
Zen poured his whole heart and soul into mastering the Truth of ThreeEnergy Construction. He tirelessly worked on it all day and all night.
<br><br>
After six weeks, Zen was already able to recite more than 12, 000 words smoothly and effortlessly.
<br><br>
The handsome man and the enchanting woman visited Zen every once in a while. They were surprised by his comprehension speed.
<br><br>
Even though they were both talented, it took them much longer to comprehend the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. Properly speaking, the time they spent mastering it was one and a half years and two years, respectively.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen was already able to master ninety percent of it in just a month and a half. It was an incredible thing to witness.
<br><br>
The Truth of Three-Energy Construction was composed of 14, 000 words.
<br><br>
Based on Zen's current speed, it wouldn't take him three months to comprehend all of it.
<br><br>
Ultimately, Zen's comprehension speed was even faster than the two of them had ever imagined. This man was truly remarkable.
<br><br>
On the morning of the eighty-third day, Zen had recited the last word.
<br><br>
Finally, it was done! He clasped his hands together and a red light appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
Then, he lightly tapped the air with his finger and a blue light materialized.
<br><br>
He flipped his palm upwards and a yellow light emerged.
<br><br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! The three lights began to converge and formed a mass of black energy.
<br><br>
He proceeded to release the energy. With a loud crash, the golden wall that surrounded him collapsed.
<br><br>
With a clinking sound, the golden words carved into the wall had broken one after another.
<br><br>
"The principle of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction is similar to that of the chaotic energy. It allows the user to construct things directly out of the void.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, however, no one is able to use the chaotic energy for construction. At most, void construction can only be completed within their inner worlds.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Truth of Three-Energy Construction has shattered this limit! Materialize!" Zen exclaimed as he watched the mass of energy in front of him.
<br><br>
The surface of the black energy was constantly changing until it transformed into a rod. A wave-like energy twirled on the surface of the black rod. The energy began to solidify until it turned into a dragon circling around the rod.
<br><br>
Splash! Finally, both the dragon and the rod had changed into a magnificent golden color. Zen actually managed to make a dragon rod out of the void! He grabbed the rod and waved it around to assess its functionality. As of now, it felt a little flimsy. However, it would be much more solid with the energy Zen instilled in it.
<br><br>
No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit had been waiting outside for a long time. When they saw the collapse of the golden wall, they immediately understood that Zen had already mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. A big smile appeared upon their faces as they approached Zen.
<br><br>
"Congratulations! You have already mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction in less than three months," No. 9527 exclaimed delightedly.
<br><br>
The pure power of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was strong when used in the way of energy. Naturally, it would be extremely useful for Zen. Most importantly, he could easily return to this space by using this Truth of Godly Way! The handsome man and the enchanting woman also went towards Zen.
<br><br>
They came at the right time as Zen had just recited the final word.
<br><br>
They had already anticipated that Zen would be able to succeed soon.
<br><br>
However, they were dumbfounded when they saw the dragon rod he made out of the three lights. Once again, he had exceeded their expectations.
<br><br>
Zen noticed the looks of astonishment upon their faces. "What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?" he asked them curiously.
<br><br>
"Y-you," stammered the handsome man, "you are capable of void construction?" The handsome man pointed at the dragon rod in Zen's hand.
<br><br>
He was clearly taken aback.
<br><br>
Zen swung the rod lightly and the three energies moved along the rod. They converged at the end of the rod and turned into a diamond-shaped spear tip which glinted and revealed a sharp edge. "Well, I've already mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. Needless to say, I am capable of void construction. What's the problem?"
<br><br>
"But, but..." The enchanting woman couldn't believe her eyes either. "We mastered it long ago but we are still unable to create anything!"
<br><br>
The handsome man stared at Zen as though he was a monster. "I can do it, but..." His voice trailed off as he contemplated upon this.
<br><br>
His talent was slightly greater than that of the enchanting woman. He was capable of void construction. However, the things he made were too horrible to look at. They were nowhere near the dragon rod Zed created.
<br><br>
This was the reason why they could not believe that Zen was capable of void construction already. To them, it was unbelievable that he accomplished this soon after he just finished comprehending the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
The two of them left in a hurry as soon as they realized there was something seriously strange about Zen. Even though King Manard had only been in seclusion for a short time, he had already ordered them to wake him up after Zen comprehended the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
Zen was not bothered by their reaction. He continued assessing his new power.
<br><br>
With a gentle pinch of his hand, the dragon rod split in the middle.
<br><br>
"The Truth of Three-Energy Construction appears very powerful. However, it doesn't seem strong enough yet. It won't be of much use in actual combat," the Regal Jade Spirit commented truthfully.
<br><br>
No. 9527 nodded in agreement. "It does look impressive but it lacks real worth."
<br><br>
Zen seemed lost in thought for just a moment. Finally, he said, "Hmm. It doesn't seem right. As the name suggests, the three kinds of energy represent the original sources of things. With enough energy, one will be able to create the same things. However, it takes a long time and requires too much energy."
<br><br>
Ages ago, King Manard had already mastered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. This meant that he should have had a corresponding theurgy as well. However, it seemed like he didn't have the intention of teaching Zen the theurgy, so he didn't ask him for it. In any case, he thought he could just study it on his own if he had spare time.
<br><br>
King Manard had only been in seclusion for less than three months.
<br><br>
Therefore, he was both confused and angry when his two disciples awakened him. He wasn't expecting to be woken up this early.
<br><br>
Only after his two disciples reported to him did he finally understand what was happening. Zen had successfully comprehended the Truth of ThreeEnergy Construction.
<br><br>
"It only took him two months and twenty-three days, to be exact," the handsome man informed King Manard with his life vitality. "Moreover, he is capable of void construction as soon as he has comprehended it!"
<br><br>
King Manard's eyes widened in surprise. This was completely unexpected to him as well.
<br><br>
Zen was the first person that had broken into this space for a long, long time. In the eyes of King Manard, Zen was only a representative. He had hoped that Zen would find the humans on the Other Shore and tell them the news of this place.
<br><br>
He did not take Zen's talent seriously. Now, it was clear that Zen was actually much more powerful than he imagined.
<br><br>
Concern was written all over his face. Together with his two disciples, he hurried over to where Zen was.
<br><br>
Zen was still discussing the functions of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction with No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit when King Manard arrived. He seemed a bit flustered.
<br><br>
"Greetings, King Manard," said Zen as he bowed his head slightly.
<br><br>
King Manard immediately noticed the broken dragon rod and stared at it.
<br><br>
"Kindly show me your ability of void construction." He gestured to Zen imploringly.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and held out his hand. The energies of three colors gathered once more and converged before changing into a dark color. Soon after, a long shimmering silver sword appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
As King Manard examined the long sword, he could barely keep his astonishment from reflecting in his eyes. "There are three stages of void construction. The first stage is Looking Alike in Appearance. The things created in this stage look impressive; however, they lack real worth," he said carefully.
<br><br>
"Yes, you're right." Zen nodded. "This sword absolutely looks splendid but it is actually useless."
<br><br>
Chapter 3449 Returning "The second stage is called 'Integrating Inner and Outer.' Let me show you,"
<br><br>
said King Manard. He made a pinching motion above Zen's head and took away the long sword in his hand.
<br><br>
King Manard gripped the sword and emitted a steady flow of energy in three colors, which was transferred through the hilt into the blade. As the energy flowed, the sword glowed, becoming more and more dazzling. In this manner, he gave the sword the inner power in a short period of time.
<br><br>
When he was done, he held up the sword, examining it.
<br><br>
Then he threw it back to Zen. "Here, take a look."
<br><br>
Zen caught the sword easily, his eyes gleaming as he studied it. "This sword is now as powerful as a primary Profound Blood Treasure!"
<br><br>
King Manard was unfamiliar with the classification of weapons in this round of chaos. But he had confidence in the weapons he had forged.
<br><br>
He nodded. "After I comprehended the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, it took me a long time to reach the stage of 'Looking Alike in Appearance.' But you've reached it within a short period of time. You are a great genius. Do you have a master?"
<br><br>
His words piqued the attention of the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527. It seemed that King Manard was interested in taking Zen on as his disciple.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and replied, "Yes, I do."
<br><br>
Zen had a master in the great world. One of his missions was to go to the Source World from the divine land to inquire into the whereabouts of his master Bromley.
<br><br>
But up to now, Zen hadn't been able to find him.
<br><br>
From the day he became Bromley's disciple, he had yet to see him, which was truly incredible.
<br><br>
As soon as King Manard heard that Zen had a master, he dropped the subject, although he was slightly disappointed. He said, "All right, then. At least we are both human beings, and I need you to find the humans of the Other Shore. I used to be an extremely powerful king. However, my disciples and children had been gone with the passing of that round of chaos. The fourteen disciples I selected from the inner world are not able to inherit my cause..."
<br><br>
The handsome man and the charming woman looked at each other. They both seemed a little embarrassed.
<br><br>
"The third stage of the void construction is 'Constructing with One Thought.' Even though you don't know the structure of some things, you will be able to form them as soon as you think about them. What's more, they'll be real like those existing in reality," King Manard continued. "You can even create someone who is exactly the same to you."
<br><br>
"Constructing with One Thought..." Zen murmured, trailing off.
<br><br>
It was hard for him to imagine what kind of realm that would be.
<br><br>
Even those powerful civilizations on the Other Shore couldn't reach this stage, let alone the Chaos Ancient Gods who had just mastered the truths.
<br><br>
It was not a truth-level theurgy. It was just an unreasonable theurgy.
<br><br>
Unless the entire chaos turned into one's own inner world, it was impossible for them to reach this stage.
<br><br>
Zen was certain that even King Manard couldn't do it.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen had thought that the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was at the same level as the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. But if one reached the third stage, the value of their Truth of Three-Energy Construction would probably be much higher than that of other Truths of Godly Ways! "If you can't reach this stage of the void construction, it can't be regarded as a powerful method. I've only reached the second stage after years of cultivation," King Manard admitted.
<br><br>
Zen nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
It seemed that the void construction wouldn't be greatly useful in a real battle.
<br><br>
But King Manard added, "However, we can use such a theurgy in an inverse way!"
<br><br>
He stretched out his hand and pinched the air, then he took back the sword that he had given to Zen. With a gentle stroke, the sword became riddled with holes that turned into clouds of black energy, and finally turned into three kinds of energy in red, yellow, and blue.
<br><br>
"Wow!" Zen was very interested.
<br><br>
Since the Truth of Three-Energy Construction could be used to construct articles in the void, it could also split articles in the void, returning them to their original nature.
<br><br>
"To clarify, this kind of theurgy can only be used to restore the things built through the Truth of Three-Energy Construction?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
King Manard smiled. "Of course not," he replied.
<br><br>
He stomped lightly on the ground, and a brick spiraled up. "Take a look.
<br><br>
This brick was deleted into this space by a Son of Truth."
<br><br>
King Manard waved his hand, and the brick was smashed into pieces, then crumbled into sand. But it didn't stop there. The sand continued to be split apart, its materials returning to their most basic state. The sand separated into two kinds of auras in black and white, then dissipated further, until they had turned into a mass of murky brown gas.
<br><br>
Zen recognized the gas at once. This was chaotic energy.
<br><br>
King Manard smiled at the expression on Zen's face. "Do you want to learn this theurgy?" he asked.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen had no intention of passing up this opportunity. He cupped his hands and bowed to King Manard. "I do. I would appreciate it if you kindly decided to teach me!"
<br><br>
While King Manard thought highly of Zen, he certainly still had some reservations about him. It was in the king's nature to be skeptical, and he was incapable of completely trusting someone he had only recently met.
<br><br>
Zen was still in many ways a stranger to him.
<br><br>
But Zen was from the same race. This made King Manard more inclined to look favorably on Zen's appeal. He was also interested in teaching Zen because he thought highly of his talents, and indeed still felt a twinge of regret that he couldn't have Zen as his disciple.
<br><br>
At this point, Zen was in no hurry to return to the Source World. He had all the time in the world to learn this unusual theurgy.
<br><br>
The theurgy that King Manard taught him was called the Endless Restoring Method. It allowed a person to restore something to its most basic forms after touching it.
<br><br>
The harder the material of the object, the easier it would be to restore.
<br><br>
When his cultivation began, Zen took out things like water, wood, and paper from his inner world, and attempted to restore them. It was a lot more difficult than it seemed. The Endless Restoring Method seemed simple and effortless, but the task of restoration was quite complex.
<br><br>
It took at least three months before Zen achieved his first small success.
<br><br>
A year passed before Zen succeeded in entirely restoring a solid rock.
<br><br>
After one and a half years, he managed to restore gold and iron.
<br><br>
And so the days and months slipped by, with Zen focused entirely on mastering the Endless Restoring Method.
<br><br>
Without even realizing it, Zen had stayed in this space for over three years.
<br><br>
At the end of that period, he comprehended around eighty percent of the Endless Restoring Method. King Manard was surprised and pleased. It usually took much longer to reach that level.
<br><br>
Even in the 77th civilization, Zen still stood out among his peers because of his extraordinary talent.
<br><br>
King Manard reflected that given the speed with which Zen had previously cultivated the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, he really should have expected Zen to excel in the Endless Restoring Method too. He had seen various extraordinary talents over the course of his life, and he was one of the powerful warriors who followed the great human ancestor.
<br><br>
In the void, four people stood without moving.
<br><br>
King Manard, the handsome man, the charming woman, and Zen had gathered together.
<br><br>
Many little monsters surrounded them in the ruins.
<br><br>
These little monsters obeyed the handsome man and the charming woman, but they worshiped King Manard. After all, it was King Manard who had created them.
<br><br>
"You were deleted into this area. And I will send you back via this area now. Please remember my words," said King Manard solemnly.
<br><br>
Zen nodded respectfully. "I will keep them in mind."
<br><br>
Although King Manard was not Zen's master, he had taught Zen a lot, and Zen would not forget his generosity.
<br><br>
The handsome man and the enchanting woman had spent almost every day and night of the past three years with Zen, and there was a trace of reluctance on their faces as they prepared to send him off.
<br><br>
"Good. I will find that time node for you," King Manard said. With that, he stretched out his hand and stirred the air. A colorful vortex appeared within his moving hand. In an instant, it sucked Zen in.
<br><br>
Chapter 3450 Hypercube Imprisonment Zen had stayed in that void for three and a half years.
<br><br>
However, since King Manard had absolute control over the void, he was able to find the right time node and send Zen away.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the Chaotic Source World, the glimmering space fragments kept circling around Mount.
<br><br>
The fragments were palm-sized at most but they were quite sharp and indestructible, extremely hard to resist.
<br><br>
However, like Mount, the Evil God could also use Grand Teleportation to move around freely within the world.
<br><br>
Mount had launched a series of supposedly deadly attacks but the Evil God had dodged every single one easily.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Evil God had even counterattacked! These space fragments were Mount's temporary protective shield as he tried to catch his breath.
<br><br>
"Give up! Once I take your abilities, even your will shall follow me," the Evil God declared. He was flashing in midair and his voice boomed and echoed all around the space, seemingly coming from everywhere.
<br><br>
Mount gritted his teeth in anger. "You're not qualified!"
<br><br>
"I'll be qualified after I kill you."
<br><br>
The Evil God's words were whispered in Mount's ear. He had appeared right beside Mount regardless of those space fragments! Clap! Clap! Clap! Mount quickly wielded the space fragments and directed them towards the Evil God.
<br><br>
Any ordinary warrior at the Other Shore Realm would've been killed after getting hit by these space fragments.
<br><br>
However, the Evil God was no ordinary warrior. His entire body had been reinforced by the Mighty Golden Body and all the space fragments could do was scratch him in multiple places.
<br><br>
"Sizz..."
<br><br>
The Evil God's wounds healed in the blink of an eye, courtesy of a small race's bloodline theurgy. So long as his elixir field and soul remained intact, his body would recover and he would never die! He was, in one word: invincible. The multiple bloodline theurgies he had absorbed ensured his protection. With a slight wave of his hand, the Evil God threw a fist towards Mount in spite of the bombardment of space fragments.
<br><br>
Swish! It was at this point that Mount felt the energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess wrap around him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, most super forces chose to watch as this battle continued to unfold before them.
<br><br>
The Evil God belonged to the infamous Black Ship while Mount was from the Divine Farmer race. Everyone hated the Black Ship but nobody would come to Mount's aid since the Divine Farmer race, the Sun Crow race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race had been blown away by the hurricane.
<br><br>
Yan watched the fight with concern, all the while instructing the other disciples of the Pear Hill to stand aside and stay out of danger.
<br><br>
"Yan, which one should we help?" Natalie asked.
<br><br>
Yan was caught in quite a sticky situation. Mount had exiled her brother and it would make sense to delight in his misery.
<br><br>
However, his opponent was the Evil God! She truly couldn't understand how a being with such strong destructive instincts was birthed in her brother's inner world.
<br><br>
Mount served as a temporary deterrent to the Evil God's rampage. Once he inevitably died by his invincible opponent's hands, everyone else was next.
<br><br>
Natalie had foreseen this and found it best to ask Yan for her opinion. The only favorable option right now was to help Mount.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Oneness Sky Palace was also in a dilemma.
<br><br>
At the very beginning, they, along with the Pear Hill, planned on forcing Mount to hand Zen over.
<br><br>
To their surprise, Mount declared Zen as someone who had been deleted, with no possibility of ever getting back.
<br><br>
How would they let Mount go in this case? After they finally restricted Mount's power, the Evil God interfered suddenly and now seemed to be ready to come for everyone else. The situation became inexplicably complicated.
<br><br>
"Maybe I should remove my abacus..." Chaim murmured in consideration.
<br><br>
"What? Why?" Elvinia protested. "Zen is still under his control!"
<br><br>
"If he's dead, then we will lose our last sliver of hope," Dorothy spoke.
<br><br>
She wholeheartedly believed that Mount had lied to all of them. She knew for a fact that warriors who were good enough at the space theurgy always had a way to take back what they had exiled.
<br><br>
However, Mount hadn't been lying.
<br><br>
Not even the Chaos Ancient God, having lost control of the space, could take Zen back.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Among everyone in the Chaotic Source World, Mount's physical strength came only second to Zen's after Zen activated the Shade Stone.
<br><br>
His corporeal body was extremely solid, however, it was no match to the shadow of Snake Goddess's extremely erosive power.
<br><br>
A tentacle skimmed the surface of Mount's body, leaving behind a deep blood groove on his tan, bronze skin.
<br><br>
Pretty soon, his entire body was covered with horrible wounds from the shadow of Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Are you going to be killed by me like this?" the Evil God asked with a smile.
<br><br>
He was so clever that he could almost guess what Mount wanted to do.
<br><br>
Mount could freely move within the space.
<br><br>
So long as he wanted, he could easily leave the area covered by the Evil God's world. If the Evil God followed and left this world, all the bloodline theurgies he gained would fail to work.
<br><br>
The Evil God was clear that Mount could make such judgments with his keen observation.
<br><br>
He definitely had some plans up his sleeve. Why else would he dare fight against him? This was the reason why the Evil God remained on high alert during their entire battle.
<br><br>
Mount who just suffered immensely from his shadow of Snake Goddess could use Grand Teleportation to escape obviously. But why did he choose to stay? "You can't kill me, but I can kill you," Mount murmured despite all his wounds. Light flashed in his eyes as a cube formed in his pupil.
<br><br>
The space fragments were still flying around them like a dangerous storm.
<br><br>
In a flash, they seemed to be enlightened and began to array neatly around, wrapping the two warriors.
<br><br>
"In your world, you can copy other people's bloodlines but there are limits to this ability," Mount said in a calm, collected manner. "You can copy only around 30 to 40 percent of my bloodline power, hence you can make spatial transference but not activate the other theurgies hidden within."
<br><br>
Before Mount could finish his words, the Evil God quickly paled and intended to leave via Grand Teleportation.
<br><br>
However, just as he was about to use it, he realized that it didn't seem to be working! Mount simply stared at him blankly. "This is the Hypercube Imprisonment.
<br><br>
Its space restriction is even stronger than that of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
There is no way for you to get rid of it."
<br><br>
Many powerful warriors had previously banded together to set up the Chaotic Source World's space restrictions. To do that, they used the Truth of Void Destruction and the abilities of the Other Shore Tokens. Mount's bloodline, however, was related to a truth, which meant that his imprisonment methods were far greater! Chapter 3451 Devil Soul-sucking Spear In his shock, the Evil God was about to move away.
<br><br>
Just as Mount said, the surrounding space remained stationary as though the Space Law had no effect on it.
<br><br>
"Go to hell!"
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes flashed with the killing intent—he did not waste any time attacking Mount with all his strength.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess' countless shadows formed energy beams that rushed straight toward Mount.
<br><br>
But before they touched him, he managed to turn himself into a shadow and disappear before the Evil God's eyes.
<br><br>
With Mount's current strength, it was a little difficult to make use of the Hypercube Imprisonment—it was stronger than the cube in which Yan was imprisoned earlier, but it took some time to employ it.
<br><br>
To pave the way for the prison, he peeled off the space fragments. It was unrealistic to use those fragments to kill the Evil God.
<br><br>
After taking the Evil God's first round of attack, Mount finally had a chance to fight back.
<br><br>
Buzz… After Mount used the spatial transference, he appeared on the other side.
<br><br>
Only a hundred feet away from the Evil God, Mount stared him down indifferently.
<br><br>
Now that he was imprisoned, the Evil God's face was twisted. He tried throwing a punch at his captor.
<br><br>
Bang! The power from the punch was extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
But his fist met a transparent wall.
<br><br>
The energy beams stored within the shadows of Snake Goddess were scattered, forming an intense whirlpool of energy. It bounced back against the wall and surged everywhere. No energy could spread out from the cube.
<br><br>
As it circulated, it outlined the entire cube.
<br><br>
A red ferocity filled the Evil God's eyes as he continued punching the barrier to no avail. The rampant energy scraped against his body but the cube remained motionless.
<br><br>
Mount's expression was steady-calm as he looked at the Evil God. His eyes were on the latter like he was merely watching a performance from a distance.
<br><br>
The scene made the other races sigh in relief.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits remained their goal—no one wanted to face the sudden appearance of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Locking up the monster was beneficial.
<br><br>
The Ear Mouse race and the Separate Abyss race, in particular, could then pay more attention to the mother.
<br><br>
"Do you really think you can do anything you want, now that you've trapped me?" the Evil God asked with his menacing tone after he calmed down.
<br><br>
A hint of black light shone in his eyes and the black energy of the world began to flow, forming numerous four-legged black snakes.
<br><br>
When the powerful warriors of the Separate Abyss race witnessed the fourlegged black snakes, the corners of their eyes twitched unconsciously.
<br><br>
These few had escaped the Evil God once and lived to tell the tale, but the four-legged black snakes frightened them, covering them in a great shadow.
<br><br>
Mount looked up to examine the snakes before shaking his head. "Of course not. Only when you die will everything go back to normal."
<br><br>
"Do you think you can kill me?" The Evil God's eyes narrowed as he asked maliciously.
<br><br>
"I can't kill you now," Mount said, flicking the golden abacus with his hand.
<br><br>
It flew away easily before quickly returning to its spot. Before the golden abacus disappeared, Mount couldn't use any Other Shore Power. After another pause, Mount continued, "But he can."
<br><br>
As Mount subtly hooked his finger, the outline of another space appeared beside him. It contained a young man holding a long spear in his hand.
<br><br>
Though he seemed somewhat dispirited, his eyes were still sharp.
<br><br>
It was none other than Khalid, who had just taken a beating from Yan.
<br><br>
The man was the top warrior from the Bearing race's younger generation.
<br><br>
His strength wasn't to be underestimated.
<br><br>
In a head-on fight, he was no weaker than Yan.
<br><br>
But he was known to be impetuous and self-gratified. In the most crucial moments, it was often difficult to bring his full strength into play.
<br><br>
Failing to be cautious enough, he suffered a great loss.
<br><br>
Trapped in the Hypercube Imprisonment, the Evil God couldn't dodge effectively. With Mount's help, Khalid could use his strength to its fullest.
<br><br>
"Refine!"
<br><br>
Spitting out a mouthful of blood, Khalid lifted the spear carefully.
<br><br>
The bear's shadow gradually emerged from behind him.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
As he shook the spear, the power at its tip began flowing like a flame.
<br><br>
At first glance, Khalid and the weapon looked as though they were integrated into a whole—Khalid's body as the secondary part, and the spear as the core.
<br><br>
But after Khalid's motion, he spoke, "Gee... I feel bad that Mount sent Zen away. I heard you were born in his inner world. It's hard to believe that he's dead and you're still alive. Let me help you end your life! I'm just..."
<br><br>
"Cut the crap," Mount interjected coldly. "Let's get this over with!"
<br><br>
After dealing with the Evil God, Mount had to face the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill. While Khalid was indeed very strong, he wasn't particularly wise. His words were nonsensical and meaningless, apart from provoking the members of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
After Mount's chastising, Khalid finally calmed down enough to get serious.
<br><br>
Tiny skulls popped out around the spear. After the skulls laughed strangely, Khalid's thin, frail body began swelling. Before long, he turned into a plump and chubby boy.
<br><br>
In the cube, the Evil God stood still. All previous signs of arrogance were replaced by a serious expression.
<br><br>
The black energy in the world continuously formed four-legged black snakes that gathered rapidly from all directions.
<br><br>
"Devil Soul-sucking Spear!"
<br><br>
Gripping the long spear in one hand, Khalid took a step in the air, using the weapon to stab at the Evil God.
<br><br>
Those who could take the spear as a weapon were no less powerful than dragons. They held great intention to kill their enemies in a single strike.
<br><br>
Khalid's Other Shore Token was a skull called the 'Heavenly Fiend Skull'.
<br><br>
At all times, it was stored in the Heavenly Fiend Temple situated within Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
The Heavenly Fiend Temple was an extremely powerful one, and no one even knew how many creatures had died there.
<br><br>
Every creature to perish there was absorbed by the Heavenly Fiend Skull.
<br><br>
The Bearing race had paid a hefty price to get their hands on the token. In the end, it fell into Khalid's hands.
<br><br>
Khalid's blow nearly exhausted all its power, and his physical body had also reached its limit.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
The moment the tip of the spear cut through air, countless shadows of skulls in the surging spear radiance began whining.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the black snakes continued flying over. They turned into figures of the Evil God, standing in a row as defense against the spear radiance.
<br><br>
"Plop! Plop! Plop..."
<br><br>
How could they resist Khalid's attack? The very moment the spear radiance pierced these figures, they exploded.
<br><br>
But the black energy didn't disappear. Like a bunch of maggots, it continued gnawing at the spear radiance.
<br><br>
As the spear radiance penetrated the Evil God's figures, the bright white spear radiance grew dark, and even the spear's sharp tip was contaminated.
<br><br>
Chapter 3452 Remove The Abacus When the spear radiance reached the Evil God's real body, the power was practically negligible—he remained unharmed.
<br><br>
At the scene, Mount frowned. "Can you launch a second strike with your spear?"
<br><br>
Khalid's swollen body returned to its original shape, his face looking grim.
<br><br>
His injuries were bad and he had exerted all his strength into launching the strike. How could he launch another in his current state? "It's my turn now."
<br><br>
From the cage formed by the Hypercube Imprisonment, the Evil God smirked. Once again, the black energy turned into four-legged snakes and rushed to him.
<br><br>
Unable to penetrate the imprisonment, they clung to the surface and wrapped around it tightly, simultaneously gnawing at the barrier.
<br><br>
Khalid's eyes twitched as he watched the scene. "Can these snakes bite open the cage?"
<br><br>
"Maybe," Mount replied.
<br><br>
"Then I'd better run away…"
<br><br>
Khalid didn't want to die in the hands of the Evil God.
<br><br>
In his hand, he already held over two hundred Chaotic Source Spirits— enough for him to reach the Chaotic Source Realm once he fused with them. Then, he'd be sent out naturally.
<br><br>
A small section of warriors had already merged with the crystals, and they were released from the Chaotic Source World afterwards.
<br><br>
But there were still a large number of people who hadn't gathered enough crystals—they could only expect to get a good share from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Whoosh! In a flash, Khalid's figure rushed toward the array.
<br><br>
Watching Khalid run, Mount shook his head helplessly. What a good-fornothing guy, he thought.
<br><br>
But the Divine Farmer race and Bearing race were only allies—Mount had no right to stop him.
<br><br>
He and Khalid were not on the same page.
<br><br>
Mount was merely a passer-by in the Chaotic Source World, after all. He wanted to avoid making any enemies out of the people there.
<br><br>
The Evil God's cruel and violent deeds shouldn't have had anything to do with Mount. But the former had killed Mya—that made it Mount's business.
<br><br>
Seeing that the Evil God was temporarily sealed, everyone turned to the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
It was their only chance to kill the mother—they had to take the opportunity. So long as they obtained enough crystals, they didn't care what else the Evil God did.
<br><br>
As Mount's figure flashed, he came to the side of the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill warriors.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?" Looking highly vigilant, Elvinia stepped forward.
<br><br>
As Yan stared at the tall, strong man, her eyes were as calm as water. She believed Zen still had a chance to return to this world, so long as Mount agreed to it.
<br><br>
Not giving any mind to Elvinia, Mount turned to Chaim, "Help me remove this."
<br><br>
Initially, Chaim was conflicted—he didn't know whether or not he should help Mount out. It seemed that the latter was the only one present who could contend against the Evil God.
<br><br>
"I can remove it if you agree to my conditions," Chaim said unhurriedly.
<br><br>
Without hesitation, Mount replied, "Once the abacus is removed, I won't do anything to hurt the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace or the warriors of the Pear Hill. I will keep my word."
<br><br>
From what Chaim observed, Mount was someone who followed through on his promises.
<br><br>
He believed Mount would do as he said.
<br><br>
Still, he needed more than a simple guarantee.
<br><br>
Before Chaim could say anything, from behind him, Sally chimed in, "If you let Zen back, consider the grudge between us written off!"
<br><br>
"Yes, bring Zen back," Dorothy echoed.
<br><br>
Mount had expected their request, of course. With a frown, he said, "If you had asked for anything else, I'd gladly do it for you. But Zen has disappeared from this world completely. I can't do anything to bring him back."
<br><br>
His sincere answer made everyone's heart sink.
<br><br>
"There's no hope for Zen's return?" Yan asked, her voice now low.
<br><br>
After a moment of thought, Mount said, "Maybe there is. There's a more powerful being that might be able to bring him back. I can pass on your request, but not right now."
<br><br>
After all, Mount only served as an avatar of the Chaos Ancient God—he wasn't the Chaos Ancient God himself.
<br><br>
He couldn't reclaim deleted spaces, but he figured that the true Chaos Ancient God might have the ability to do so. But he didn't know that in fact even the true Chaos Ancient God was incapable of doing that.
<br><br>
Everyone seemed rather upset—as it seemed that Mount wasn't lying.
<br><br>
Although they couldn't completely comprehend Mount's space theurgy, they knew that Zen's exile was not as simple as it seemed to be.
<br><br>
Crack! Crack! Crack! Explosive sounds came from above as the four-legged black snakes consistently bit on the square prison.
<br><br>
"If you don't undo this abacus, I'm afraid you'll all be in trouble—you won't even get to think about fighting against the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. I hope you understand the stakes of your situation," Mount continued sincerely.
<br><br>
While everyone was fighting, there were people who constantly rushed in from the periphery of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Neither the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace nor those of the Pear Hill had obtained enough crystals. The warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, in particular, were lacking, because many of the crystals were still in Zen's hands.
<br><br>
It was crucial to get a share of crystals from the mother.
<br><br>
Just as Chaim was still hesitant, the Hypercube Imprisonment that held the Evil God in was finally bitten through.
<br><br>
Indeed, the Hypercube Imprisonment was ingenious, but the four-legged black snakes were valiant. With pure force transformed from energy, they had broken through the imprisonment.
<br><br>
Although he remained quiet, Mount's earnest eyes were still on Chaim.
<br><br>
Inwardly, Chaim sighed before walking up to the golden abacus beside Mount and said, "I hope you can keep your promise about asking the powerful being to release Zen."
<br><br>
"I will." Mount nodded.
<br><br>
"And..." Pointing a finger to the air, Chaim continued, "Beat him up!"
<br><br>
"I will," said the other with an easy smile.
<br><br>
Enemies and standpoints were ever-changing.
<br><br>
The situation was shifting, along with the friends and foes.
<br><br>
The moment Chaim took off the golden abacus, Mount flew backward, turning into an enormous roc. Once again, he was filled with vigorous energy as he emitted a strong, steady aura.
<br><br>
When the Evil God broke out of the Hypercube Imprisonment, he saw how greatly Mount's momentum increased. A strange look crossed his eyes, which was then replaced by a strong fighting spirit. Once the blood power was activated all over his body, the two started fighting fiercely again.
<br><br>
The two fought in the air for a while, disappearing and fighting head-on at times.
<br><br>
Leading the warriors and disciples, Chaim and Yan joined the group fighting the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
By this time, the mother's speed had been greatly reduced.
<br><br>
She didn't look hurt, but her energy coming from tens of thousands of crystals was nearly depleted.
<br><br>
At the very least, two-thirds had been exhausted.
<br><br>
She had no way to escape—she could only counterattack in vain and allow the powerful warriors to shower their attacks onto her huge body.
<br><br>
Chapter 3453 A Tremendous Change With the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill joining the attack, naturally, the Separate Abyss race and the other large races grew vigilant. However, they knew that this would also accelerate the process of exhausting the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Just as everyone was concentrated on fierce attacks, they suddenly heard the sound of something falling from the sky at a great velocity.
<br><br>
As they turned to look at where the sound was coming from, a figure landed onto the ground, with an impact so great that a crater formed around him.
<br><br>
To their horror, the figure lying motionless at the center of the crater was Mount.
<br><br>
"Mount lost so quickly?!"
<br><br>
"Is the Evil God really that powerful?"
<br><br>
Everyone turned to look at the sky. The Evil God still floated there arrogantly, with the shadow of Snake Goddess behind him.
<br><br>
Huge wounds covered his body. It seemed Mount had injured him seriously.
<br><br>
Alas, that didn't matter. Under the protection of several kinds of special bloodlines, the wounds started to heal instantly.
<br><br>
Mount, on the other hand, was in a much worse condition. He was nearly split in half. On his face was a stunned expression, as he stared at the Evil God in the sky.
<br><br>
He hadn't expected that the Evil God had a strategy to defeat him.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked down at Mount, gloating. Slowly, he descended from the air. "I'm satisfied with your bloodline, so just stay here in my world..."
<br><br>
To the Evil God, Mount had been the biggest obstacle.
<br><br>
If Mount died in his world, he could acquire Mount's bloodline theurgy permanently.
<br><br>
With it, killing the rest of the people would be a breeze.
<br><br>
"This is bad..."
<br><br>
Chaim watched uneasily.
<br><br>
Although the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was on the verge of death, the Evil God might not give them time to finish her now.
<br><br>
Chaim wasn't alone in his worry. The members of the other super forces and races were stunned and anxious as well. They were hoping to defeat the mother once and for all. However, it seemed the Evil God wouldn't give them the chance.
<br><br>
Just as the Evil God was slowly descending, a space in the atmosphere not far from him suddenly distorted and fluctuated. Suddenly, a figure stumbled out of the space wave.
<br><br>
The moment Zen emerged from the space wave, he surveyed the area. The scene that greeted him made him frown.
<br><br>
He had been in that space for several years.
<br><br>
However, after King Manard found the time node and sent him back, only a short while had passed in the real world.
<br><br>
Now that he looked around, it seemed the whole world had actually changed.
<br><br>
The once rust-colored earth was now a dark green, and the black smog that had once shrouded the sky was now white. The colors of the entire world had changed! Mount's eyes flitted to look at the figure that had emerged from the space. A flicker of excitement flashed in his eyes when he realized who the figure was.
<br><br>
'Zen is back? How is this possible?' It was impossible even for Mount to return from the deleted space! Only the Chaos Ancient God behind him had the qualifications to do it! "Zen..." Yan cried out joyfully.
<br><br>
"Zen!" Sally also shouted, unable to contain her excitement.
<br><br>
Even Elvinia smiled faintly, despite her usual cool disposition.
<br><br>
Dorothy bit her lip. Even though she kept quiet, it was obvious she was overjoyed as well.
<br><br>
"He..." Chaim shook his head in disbelief. "He..." He was at a loss for words. It seemed nothing could stop Zen. He always seemed to survive despite constantly facing grave danger.
<br><br>
Standing outside the Chaotic Source World, Fuxi trembled in shock when he saw Zen's return.
<br><br>
Like Mount, he also knew the meaning of deleting a piece of space.
<br><br>
If one was exiled to that place, they would be completely lost in the destroyed space. It was impossible to return.
<br><br>
Fuxi knitted his brows. He had complicated feelings towards Zen.
<br><br>
On the one hand, he was jealous that Zen had won the Chaos Ancient God's favor. On the other, he was happy to witness Zen grow in strength.
<br><br>
Deep in his heart, he sincerely thought that Gerald had chosen the wrong person. Why should he place his hope on Zen? If Zen had really been lost to the destroyed space, it meant Gerald had indeed made the wrong choice.
<br><br>
Fuxi had been considering sneaking to the bottom of the chaos to tell Gerald about it.
<br><br>
But now, Zen was back! He had returned unscathed from the deleted space! As Fuxi was deep in thought, snow began to fall heavily. A thick layer of snow surrounded him, so tall that it reached his knees. However, Fuxi didn't notice. He murmured quietly to the giant skeleton in the distance, "You have a good eye..."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Evil God was also taken aback at Zen's sudden return.
<br><br>
He paused in the air, and quickly put on a playful expression. "Well, I thought you'd never come back!"
<br><br>
Zen noticed the shadow of Snake Goddess behind the Evil God and his three heads and six arms. "Why do you possess the bloodline theurgies of the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race?"
<br><br>
"You don't need to know that." The Evil God laughed. "You just need to obediently submit to me!" With a wink, the Evil God suddenly vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
"Spatial transference?"
<br><br>
Zen was shocked.
<br><br>
It was also because of Mount's theurgy that he was banished into the void.
<br><br>
After that, Zen had realized that Mount was the avatar of a Chaos Ancient God. The space theurgy he exerted could naturally break the restriction of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
But how could the Evil God do it? Zen's reaction, however, was quick. The instant the Evil God disappeared, he rushed forward, a cyan feather floating above his head.
<br><br>
"Swish!"
<br><br>
Just as Zen had rushed forward, an energy beam of the shadow of Snake Goddess shot towards him, almost pressing against his back.
<br><br>
"Zen! Be careful!" Dorothy cautioned. "He can make use of everyone's bloodline theurgy!" Her eyes showed a trace of worry.
<br><br>
"The bloodline theurgies of all the people... This..." Zen felt incredulous.
<br><br>
He knew very well that it was a very terrible thing if the bloodline theurgies of these people were employed at the same time, and that the bloodline theurgy of Mount was especially formidable.
<br><br>
He gritted his teeth.
<br><br>
Zen never would've expected that he would encounter such difficulty the moment he returned from the deleted space.
<br><br>
Having failed to strike Zen, the Evil God vanished once more.
<br><br>
Just then, Mount, who was lying motionless on the ground, suddenly came back to his senses. Gathering his wits, he teleported out of this strange world.
<br><br>
As Mount moved outside of the world, the Evil God suddenly rushed out of the void. As they locked eyes, Mount smiled slyly at him.
<br><br>
The Evil God furrowed his brows in fury. He could only acquire Mount's power if he killed him in this world! The Evil God had killed Mya in order to enrage Mount to a point of recklessly attacking him without escaping even when he knew it was in vain.
<br><br>
Everything was going according to plan, so he only needed to land one last blow and Mount would've died on the spot.
<br><br>
He never expected Zen would return out of nowhere, and was momentarily distracted.
<br><br>
With the help of the spatial transference, he thought it would be easy for him to launch a sneak attack on Zen.
<br><br>
However, he didn't think that Mount would escape as he shifted his focus on Zen.
<br><br>
The bloodline theurgy of Mount also disappeared from the body of the Evil God, along with the ability to use the spatial transference. Consequently, the Evil God was restricted by the Chaotic Source World and was kicked out of the space channel.
<br><br>
Chapter 3454 Absorb Zen was slightly taken aback when seeing the Evil God fall out from the space channel. Then, Chaim sent him a message using the life vitality.
<br><br>
"Zen," he said, "he can use the blood theurgy of anyone in this world, but once a warrior leaves, he can no longer use the blood theurgy of that warrior!"
<br><br>
Since Mount had moved outside of the world using spatial transference, Zen immediately understood everything.
<br><br>
"It's a pity that you lost a bloodline theurgy as soon as I appeared.
<br><br>
Moreover, it is the truth-level theurgy of a Chaos Ancient God," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
So, it turned out Mount carried the blood of a Chaos Ancient God. No wonder his blood theurgy was so powerful! Shera had once introduced the many powerful masters of this world to him.
<br><br>
Those Chaos Ancient Gods she told him were the founders of the entire chaos and they were the most powerful beings! No wonder Mount's blood theurgy could easily break the restriction of the Chaotic Source World. Now that he lost such a priceless bloodline theurgy, he clenched his fists tightly with regret.
<br><br>
"Indeed, it's a pity," the Evil God sighed, then straightened up. "I'll just redeem it with your life!"
<br><br>
In the Evil God's eyes, Zen kept countless secrets.
<br><br>
After all, he was a creature born in Zen's inner world. If he managed to control his own master, it'd be an incredible feat.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The shadow of Snake Goddess flashed behind the Evil God and he flew towards Zen at lightning speed.
<br><br>
Zen promptly flew backward, in what looked like an attempt to evade the approaching Evil God.
<br><br>
Even though the Evil God couldn't use the spatial transference now, the bloodline theurgies he had now were still difficult to deal with! In the blink of an eye, the Evil God closed in on Zen.
<br><br>
The blood red shadow of the Snake Goddess swept over Zen, poised to strike. However, to the Evil God's surprise, Zen didn't retreat this time. He passed through the energy streams and reached behind the Evil God with unimaginable agility. Then, Zen drew his long sword.
<br><br>
Although Zen moved extremely fast, the Evil God reacted just as quickly.
<br><br>
With three heads and six arms, he didn't even need to turn around. The Evil God's hands clenched into fists and swung at Zen.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
Suddenly, Zen's eyes flashed a menacing red. At the sight of this, a trace of fear welled up within the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God's soul force was extremely powerful; even the power of fear from the giant eye had difficulty fazing him.
<br><br>
But in the eyes of the Evil God, Zen was the creator that had made him after all. He still maintained a trace of innate reverence for Zen deep in his heart.
<br><br>
As the Evil God looked into the eyes of his creator now, he couldn't help but tremble.
<br><br>
This gave Zen a split second to act. In a flash, he swung his long sword, slicing deep into the Evil God's shoulder.
<br><br>
Phew...
<br><br>
While Zen had put a lot of effort into that blow, to his disappointment, the blade of his sword had sunk only three inches into the shoulder of the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God had several bloodline theurgies to protect himself. The Mighty Golden Body of the Separate Abyss race alone was enough to make his body indestructible, not to mention that there were other bloodlines to strengthen his physical body. So how could Zen possibly pierce further? With so many bloodline theurgies working together, the Evil God's body was even stronger than Zen's.
<br><br>
"Click, click, click!"
<br><br>
The Evil God's three right arms stretched out simultaneously and each seized the blade of Zen's long sword.
<br><br>
With the power of the Mighty Golden Body, his three right arms gleamed with metallic luster. When they gripped the long sword, it sounded like metals clanging.
<br><br>
"Clang clang clang..."
<br><br>
To Zen's surprise, the three arms actually broke the sword into pieces! As the Evil God's three right arms destroyed the long sword, the three arms on his left side reached out to grab Zen. Since he finally had the opportunity to get close to Zen, he wouldn't let go of Zen so easily.
<br><br>
But Zen acted quick. Even before the long sword broke, he had let go of the sword and darted backwards.
<br><br>
With the help of that cyan feather, his escape was made skillfully and elegantly.
<br><br>
As Zen was about to put distance between him and the Evil God, the Evil God suddenly stretched out the palms of his three left hands.
<br><br>
In each palm, a colorful whirlpool had formed. Gritting his teeth, Zen felt the strong gravitational pull of each whirlpool.
<br><br>
"It's the bloodline theurgy of the White Myth race!" Chaim cried in astonishment.
<br><br>
"Damn it! I hope Zen won't be sucked in! Since the Evil God came from Zen's inner world, there won't be any barrier for Zen to be absorbed!"
<br><br>
Dorothy said anxiously.
<br><br>
Seeing Dorothy's and Chaim's horrified expressions, Sally cocked her head in confusion. "Dorothy, this White Myth race isn't a big race...their bloodline theurgy shouldn't be a big deal, right?"
<br><br>
It was true. The White Myth race was so small in number that they were practically ignored. At the time the Chaotic Source World opened, they were granted only one ticket.
<br><br>
However, the member of the White Myth race who had gotten into the Chaotic Source World was a bit lucky, as he made it to the core area without any hitches. But since he made it there alone, he didn't get any Chaotic Source Spirit and had no choice but to seek shelter in an array.
<br><br>
He had patiently waited for an opportunity. Alone, there was no way he could take down the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. No, he needed to wait till other warriors arrived and chaos ensued. Maybe, in the midst of the chaos, he'd be able to snag some crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits...
<br><br>
The blood theurgy of the White Myth race was very special. The entrance to their inner worlds was not in the cinnabar field, but was a whirlpool on the palm of their hands.
<br><br>
It could absorb mountains, rivers, trees and houses, and sometimes, even some unintelligent creatures.
<br><br>
Sometimes, the blood theurgy of the White Myth race could have a miraculous effect. For example, when the powerful warriors of the Source World had broken into the Heavenly Riverway, they would like to recruit some warriors from the White Myth race. This was because there was a kind of poisonous mosquitoes that dwelled in the Heavenly Riverway.
<br><br>
These mosquitoes were extremely difficult to kill; neither fire nor water could do any harm to them.
<br><br>
However, these mosquitoes were quite unintelligent, and acted only on instinct. The White Myth race needed only to extend their hands to activate the whirlpools, then the mosquitoes would be sucked into their inner worlds.
<br><br>
As they were the creators of their own inner worlds, they could do anything they wanted. In their inner world, it was a piece of cake for them to kill off the mosquitoes.
<br><br>
However, there was a catch to the bloodline theurgy of the White Myth race, which had something to do with the weakness of their inner worlds. If they tried to suck in an intelligent creature, the creature needed to willingly accept in order for them to enter their inner world.
<br><br>
For example, when Zen tried to suck No. 9527 into his inner world, it would only be successful if No. 9527 didn't resist.
<br><br>
If one showed the littlest bit of resistance, they would not be pulled into the inner world of the other party.
<br><br>
As a result, this trick was only useful with unintelligent or even dead creatures; in actual combat, it was rendered useless.
<br><br>
However, in the case of the Evil God and Zen, the situation was different.
<br><br>
Since Zen and the Evil God came from the same origin, the two of them didn't have the slightest rejection to each other.
<br><br>
At the entrance to the Chaotic Source World, Dorothy had reminded Zen that the Evil God could be used as an Inner-world Generating Avatar for him, because there was no rejection between them.
<br><br>
Consequently, this worked vice versa. If the Evil God was strong enough, he could easily refine Zen into an Inner-world Generating Avatar! Chapter 3455 The Endless Restoring Method Something infinitely more complicated was taking place.
<br><br>
Using the bloodline theurgy of the White Myth race, the Evil God was now trying to pull Zen into his own inner world. Since he had previously belonged in Zen's inner world, there would be no rejection between them.
<br><br>
The Evil God would be able to pull Zen in with no problems.
<br><br>
Theoretically speaking, the Evil God's inner world also belonged to Zen but, since he avoided the restraint of the Rebirth Land, Zen could no longer sense nor control him.
<br><br>
Once pulled into the Evil God's inner world, Zen would then be at his mercy and might even get refined into an Inner-world Generating Avatar.
<br><br>
Dorothy quickly sent him a message through life vitality. "Don't let yourself get pulled into the vortex!" she pleaded. "That leads to his inner world! If you get sucked in... You'll get trapped and end up in big trouble!"
<br><br>
Her warning greatly alarmed Zen who now realized the true gravity of his situation. He immediately tried to distance himself from his opponent in order to avoid getting sucked into the vortex.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for him, just as he was about to move, a transparent film of light appeared out of nowhere and enveloped him like a net.
<br><br>
"It's the Moon Spirit race's bloodline theurgy!"
<br><br>
The sight was quite a shock for members of the Moon Spirit race in the core area.
<br><br>
As a small race, most viewed their bloodline theurgy as useless and without value. However, it worked extremely well when the Evil God used it in combination with his other skills.
<br><br>
There was no escaping the light film, it was airtight and could not be destroyed through physical means. There was also no way for Zen to use the Wing King's feather that he had been relying on to improve his bodily movement skill. Zen had no choice but to weakly struggle against the Evil God's three arms that were quickly pulling him towards the vortex.
<br><br>
"I need to help him!"
<br><br>
Yan exclaimed, unable to stand by the sidelines any longer. She stamped her foot and flew towards her brother.
<br><br>
It wasn't just her. Dorothy and Elvinia, without the slightest hesitation, also jumped into the air and followed after Yan.
<br><br>
They had chosen to not get involved during the battle between the Evil God and Mount. One, they knew how powerful the Evil God was and going against him recklessly would be unwise, and two, it didn't really have anything to do with them. It was a different story now that Zen was the one in grave danger.
<br><br>
However, just as they were about to join the battle, numerous four-legged, black snakes began to rain from the sky, turning into the Evil God's clones.
<br><br>
These clones weren't as powerful as the real deal but they were still equally tough enemies. If not destroyed completely, they could respawn.
<br><br>
The three women had to deal with these clones first before they could help Zen.
<br><br>
"Stop struggling!" the Evil God growled as he continued to pull Zen in. "We essentially have the same origin. If we can be completely integrated as one then it's only a matter of time before we conquer the entire world!"
<br><br>
Zen scoffed, his eyes glinting with coldness as he glared at the Evil God who was now only a few inches away from him. "Do you really think that your little tricks will make me surrender?"
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled. "Then why not show me those tricks you still have up your sleeve?"
<br><br>
Zen's eyes narrowed and an indescribably strong aura began to emanate from his body. He reached out and touched the light film that had been wrapped around him.
<br><br>
"Endless Restoring Method!"
<br><br>
His recitation was immediately followed by a popping sound.
<br><br>
In an instant, the light film that had previously enveloped him burst and dissipated like a soap bubble.
<br><br>
When it burst, it turned into a handful of cyan liquid that splashed to the ground.
<br><br>
"That's the Moon Spirit race's blood!"
<br><br>
The members of the Moon Spirit race couldn't help but show their astonishment.
<br><br>
They were a race whose members bled cyan. Though their bloodline theurgy wasn't powerful, the light film derived from their own blood was very difficult to destroy.
<br><br>
Back in the cave outside the core area, not even the golden sharp sword released by the Divine Lair's demon woman could destroy it, yet Zen managed to break it with one gentle flick of his hand.
<br><br>
It wasn't just that, he was also able to reduce it to its base form: the Moon Spirit race's blood. Just what sort of formidable method did he use? Even the Evil God was taken aback by this sudden turn of events, nonetheless, he wasn't going to give up so easily. When Zen broke the light film, the shadow of Snake Goddess behind the Evil God quickly mobilized, turning into multiple beams of energy.
<br><br>
Zen was almost in the Evil God's grasp and there was no way he was letting him go. If he succeeded in taking Zen into his inner world then he would no longer have to worry about him anymore.
<br><br>
Despite the beams of energy heading towards him, Zen chose to remain in his spot. Instead of running, he simply swept his hand across the air and waved the energy beams away.
<br><br>
Buzz! The energy beam that touched Zen's hand quickly broke down and turned into a handful of red blood that also splashed to the ground.
<br><br>
All the bloodline theurgies that the Evil God used on Zen broke down into the energy that formed them.
<br><br>
Outside the black and white world, Mount finally healed that dreadful wound on his abdomen. It had been a nasty blow from the Evil God, one that nearly destroyed his inner world.
<br><br>
As he continued to heal, he also paid attention to the battle currently taking place between Zen and the Evil God.
<br><br>
Mount's eyes widened when he noticed the formidable technique Zen was using. "Is that... the Time Backing technique?" He squinted his eyes and tried to keep track of Zen's moves. "It doesn't look like it at all though."
<br><br>
Mount could only shake his head in confusion.
<br><br>
The light film of the Moon Spirit race and the shadow of the Snake Goddess were activated through those races' bloodlines. For those thuergies to have reverted to their original forms meant Zen used some type of formidable skill similar to the Time Backing technique.
<br><br>
It wasn't possible though. The Time Law was restricted by the unshakeable truth.
<br><br>
More importantly, the aura Zen emanated had nothing to do with the power of time. It felt more like a Truth of Godly Way, one that Mount had never seen before.
<br><br>
He wasn't the only one confused.
<br><br>
Fuxi, who was outside the Chaotic Source World, also sported an equally bewildered look on his face.
<br><br>
He felt that it was increasingly becoming difficult to see through Zen.
<br><br>
"The Truths of Godly Ways are known to be the paths that lead to the Other Shore. After the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was banned, only twelve remained. Zen's aura resembles a truth aura so much. Where exactly did he cultivate this new Truth of Godly Way? Or am I wrong?"
<br><br>
He'd never witnessed such a strange phenomenon and thus didn't know what to make of it.
<br><br>
There was no way for Fuxi to know how Zen learned such a method. The young man was gone for less than five minutes after being exiled by Mount so how did he learn so much in just a short period of time? Fuxi was the Human Sovereign, second only to the Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
However, not even he knew all the secrets of the chaos.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the battle between Zen and the Evil God continued on. Zen turned around and shot out a blue beam of light towards his opponent.
<br><br>
Caught off-guard, the blue light pierced through the Evil God's body, leaving a hole in his chest.
<br><br>
Fortunately for him, the flesh around his injury wriggled and quickly closed the hole.
<br><br>
Zen's attack had been powerful but nowhere near enough to kill him.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen never expected to eliminate his opponent with one hit.
<br><br>
Having delivered his attack, Zen took advantage of the Evil God's momentary shock and distanced himself from him.
<br><br>
The golden opportunity for the Evil God to defeat his creator quickly slipped away. Zen had shown his trick and managed to turn the tables at the critical moment.
<br><br>
Chapter 3456 Reinforcement The Evil God's face became serious as the black energy surrounding him turned into a pair of large wings. With a flap of his wings, he rushed towards Zen at lightning speed.
<br><br>
However, his wings were not a match compared to the Wing King's feather.
<br><br>
As a result, the Evil God was evident to be lower in level in terms of speed and bodily movement skills.
<br><br>
Zen's fingertips were surrounded by three different colored energies. As soon as the Evil God approached him, he would just calmly and smoothly dodge the attacks while shooting back the three energies from different angles.
<br><br>
The Truth of Three-Energy Construction was a kind of theurgy used to create various things. Considering its pure energy, it was much stronger than the other Truths of Godly Ways. Its power could be proved through the fact that Zen was restrained by a group of little monsters as soon as he entered King Manard's space.
<br><br>
The Evil God continued chasing Zen in the air for a while. However, instead of catching Zen, the Evil God was just pierced through by the three energies from time to time.
<br><br>
If not for his current special constitution that allowed his body to recover in an instant, he would have been crushed to pieces already.
<br><br>
After realizing that chasing Zen would do him no good, the Evil God finally stopped. He landed on the ground and stared at Zen with disdain.
<br><br>
'It can't go on like this. I will just exhaust myself and will accomplish nothing, ' he thought.
<br><br>
"My creator, won't you dare to fight me fair and square?" the Evil God asked as he gave a slight shudder.
<br><br>
Then, the shadow of Snake Goddess vanished from his back, together with the heads and arms. Soon after, the Mighty Golden Body covering his entire body also disappeared.
<br><br>
With this, he abandoned all his bloodline theurgies.
<br><br>
Zen stayed in the air and took the cyan feather over his head with his hand.
<br><br>
He lightly brushed it and replied, "What do you mean by fighting you fair and square? This is the ability that the Other Shore Token gave me. Is it my fault that I possess a mighty token?"
<br><br>
The Evil God smiled coldly, and his voice suddenly changed. "In that case, let me show you the true horror of this world."
<br><br>
Immediately, the energy flow of the world began to accelerate.
<br><br>
The black energy turned into thick clouds and gathered above the Evil God's head. It was as if a huge abyss was being created.
<br><br>
Then the gathering energy turned into flashes of black lightning that lashed directly towards the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Clap, clap, clap!"
<br><br>
Every time a bolt of black lightning hit the Evil God, his face would twitch.
<br><br>
The pain must be so agonizing that no ordinary person would endure it.
<br><br>
Zen still clearly remembered the piercing screams of the man from the Separate Abyss race when he was bitten by the four-legged black snakes.
<br><br>
The black lightning that emerged from the stormy clouds became fiercer and fiercer. The Evil God receiving all the bolts of lightning was writhing in pain as his body grew bigger and his aura became stronger.
<br><br>
Previously, the Evil God, Zen, and Mount all possessed the most powerful auras among the warriors of the same level.
<br><br>
However, as the Evil God's aura continuously grew stronger, it was now hard for any ordinary warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm to compete with him.
<br><br>
Under the pressure of his aura, many men present in the world were greatly distressed. They all felt that something was going to go wrong any minute.
<br><br>
The Evil God's avatars, who had been fighting with the three women until now, dissipated into black energy and merged into the whirlpool of gathered energy.
<br><br>
Yan, Dorothy, and Elvinia quickly flew over and stood by Zen's side.
<br><br>
"Brother!"
<br><br>
"Zen!"
<br><br>
As they sensed that the Evil God's aura had greatly soared, they started to feel a little frightened but firmly decided to fight alongside Zen.
<br><br>
"Get out of here," Zen ordered in a stiff voice.
<br><br>
"But..."
<br><br>
Yan wanted to argue with him, but when she saw how serious the look was on her brother's face, she couldn't utter another word. Her eyes turned red and tears instantly formed.
<br><br>
Zen's heart softened at the sight of Yan's expression. Then he said, "I created him, so I should be the one to subdue him. This is our battle."
<br><br>
Some battles should be fought one-on-one. Not only would they be unable to help Zen, but they could also become a hindrance.
<br><br>
"What are you saying? We can always help you," Elvinia answered stubbornly.
<br><br>
The journey to the Chaotic Source World enlightened Elvinia about the talents of this world.
<br><br>
Elvinia, Chaim, and Dorothy were already considered to be the strongest warriors compared to their peers in the Oneness Sky Palace. However, when compared to Mount, the Evil God, and Zen, the gap was extremely wide as the strength of those three could even give the warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm a hard time.
<br><br>
She actually was aware of it, yet she still chose to stand by Zen's side.
<br><br>
Just then, from a distance, Mount suddenly stretched out his hand and waved in the air towards Zen. Then, a space instantly covered the three women.
<br><br>
As Mount outlined the space, the three women immediately disappeared and were sent to Chaim's side.
<br><br>
Zen and Mount gave a glance to each other. "I want to see you fight him with all you've got," Mount told Zen with a faint smile on his face.
<br><br>
Being an avatar of the Chaos Ancient God, it was not surprising that Mount was quite proficient in dealing with people.
<br><br>
He was arrogant and had never taken any opponent at his level seriously no matter if it was Zen or the Evil God.
<br><br>
There should be not much of a comparison in terms of knowledge, birth, and talent.
<br><br>
That was why Mount didn't expect that he would be defeated by the Evil God.
<br><br>
Despite that, he was reasonable enough and openly accepted his failure.
<br><br>
Now, he wanted to see if Zen was really a match for the Evil God.
<br><br>
It wasn't only Mount who was looking forward to the battle, but also the team leaders outside the Chaotic Source World. They were patiently waiting and had taken a great interest in the fight.
<br><br>
"The man in black has even defeated Mount. What domineering skills he has!"
<br><br>
"Just now, he must have let go of all the bloodline theurgies. Does that mean that there are still other theurgies that he could use in that world?"
<br><br>
"Probably. We're about to see…"
<br><br>
"I can't believe there are such talented warriors in the world! I think you would agree that when these young people enter the Chaotic Source Realm, the gap between them and us would be really narrow!"
<br><br>
These leaders didn't have any sectarian bias and they just wanted to see for themselves who was stronger between Zen and the Evil God.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the leaders from the Oneness Sky Palace, including Athemar and Winchell, were more nervous.
<br><br>
They had known that Zen and the Evil God would engage in a fierce battle, but they never thought that it would escalate to this degree.
<br><br>
The three women didn't return after Mount sent them away from the center of the battlefield.
<br><br>
Facing the Evil God reinforced by the black lightning, the Civilization Artifact within Zen's inner world gradually emerged. As he held it in the air, a cyan-colored chessboard appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Zen reached out his hand and gently swept the board. A chess piece surfaced and a jade sculpture materialized beside him.
<br><br>
"What is that strange sculpture? Is it an Other Shore Token of the descending type?"
<br><br>
"I don't think that sculpture contains that much power."
<br><br>
"I agree with you. I'll bet that it wouldn't even withstand a single blow from me!"
<br><br>
Everyone couldn't help but shake their heads as they saw Zen released the jade sculpture.
<br><br>
They wondered if Zen had no other powerful skill to summon.
<br><br>
"His Strength God Totem is even stronger than this one. Why did he let this one descend?" Dorothy mumbled with a puzzled expression on her face.
<br><br>
"What is he trying to do?" Yan asked curiously as she lightly scratched her head.
<br><br>
When Elvinia saw the Regal Jade chessboard, her eyes widened. Among all the people that were currently present, only she knew about the true power of the chessboard.
<br><br>
Every time a sculpture landed, its strength would increase little by little.
<br><br>
Chapter 3457 The Inheritance Of World Back in the Phoenix Palace when Zen fought Chance who was at the Chaotic Source Realm, Zen had only used these sculptures to defeat him.
<br><br>
Theoretically, these sculptures could also defeat the Evil God if they grew to become extremely powerful.
<br><br>
But most people who were present didn't know about this. They were puzzled.
<br><br>
With one gentle stroke of Zen's hand over the Regal Jade chessboard, the second Regal Jade sculpture also descended, followed by the third, the fourth, and the fifth.
<br><br>
The force of every Regal Jade sculpture had increased by a hundred or so divine megatons compared to the previous one, its size and toughness also multiplying astronomically.
<br><br>
In just a few seconds, Zen had more than a dozen Regal Jade sculptures around him.
<br><br>
The increase in the power of the Regal Jade sculptures followed a regular pattern. The fourteenth jade statue already had a force of a thousand divine megatons, which was equivalent to the strength of the weakest Chaotic Source Realm warriors. But this statue wouldn't suffice to fight against a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, and it was even no match for warriors like Dorothy or Elvinia.
<br><br>
The whirlpool in the sky finally disappeared only after Zen had summoned twenty Regal Jade sculptures.
<br><br>
The Evil God's body was pitch black from head to toe, as if made of black steel.
<br><br>
His body emanated a strong aura, and his height had more than doubled. A row of black spikes extended from his shoulders, like the fangs of a monster.
<br><br>
"This is the first time I've used the Inheritance of World. You should feel honored," the Evil God said as he looked down at Zen.
<br><br>
"What is the Inheritance of World?"
<br><br>
"I don't know. All I know is that the Other Shore Tokens that can summon a world to descend are all terrifying!"
<br><br>
"With the Evil God's current strength, he could kill many powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm in an instant."
<br><br>
Many warriors from various races gulped in terror as they watched the Evil God transform.
<br><br>
They had had great hope of reaching the Chaotic Source Realm. But the Evil God had enough strength to defeat all the Chaotic Source Realm warriors at once. They had never felt so discouraged.
<br><br>
Zen held up the Regal Jade chessboard in one hand, his other hand hovering over the chess pieces.
<br><br>
He gave a gentle push and all the Regal Jade sculptures came to life.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, they made for the Evil God.
<br><br>
The twenty Regal Jade sculptures pounced on the Evil God in unison.
<br><br>
The Evil God sneered disdainfully at the Regal Jade sculptures. He walked through the air, reaching out a hand and gently touched the sculptures that came at him.
<br><br>
Crack...
<br><br>
At the contact, the Regal Jade sculptures shattered into countless pieces.
<br><br>
The emerald green fragments fell to the ground like rain.
<br><br>
"Disappointing! They are too weak," the Evil God muttered, shaking his head.
<br><br>
He continued to make his way through the air. It was as if he was walking down an invisible staircase.
<br><br>
He was in no hurry and was actually enjoying the moment.
<br><br>
He could feel the fear, panic, and unease of the people below.
<br><br>
He wasn't strong enough now, but sooner or later, he would push all creatures in the chaos into a sense of unease.
<br><br>
They would then have no choice but to kneel down before him and surrender to him.
<br><br>
Zen remained stoic. He once again placed his hand on the chess pieces and pushed gently at them. A second batch of Regal Jade sculptures rushed towards the Evil God.
<br><br>
The second batch had ten Regal Jade sculptures.
<br><br>
When Zen had fought Chance, it had taken Zen eighteen Regal Jade sculptures to defeat him.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...
<br><br>
The second batch of Regal Jade sculptures were already over ten feet tall, their bodies extremely strong. Even Chance, who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm, had been unable to destroy them.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked on, his face a mask of calm, as he faced the second batch of Regal Jade sculptures.
<br><br>
He leapt into the air and began to circle around the sculptures, causing them to shatter as well. No one had seen how he had done it.
<br><br>
"Too weak, too weak!"
<br><br>
the Evil God said impatiently. He then landed on the invisible staircase and strolled towards Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's face hardened.
<br><br>
After the Evil God had used the Inheritance of World, he became extremely powerful, as if he had achieved a complete transformation.
<br><br>
Zen remained calm and placed his fingers on the Regal Jade chessboard again. The third batch of sculptures came to life and charged at the Evil God.
<br><br>
This batch of sculptures each had a force ranging from two to three thousand divine megatons, surpassing that of many warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm. The strength of these bodies was not as strong as that of the warriors who had merged with Chaotic Source Spirits, but one couldn't call them weak.
<br><br>
The third batch of Regal Jade sculptures were still vulnerable before the Evil God. They had barely reached the Evil God before he crushed them like dry weeds.
<br><br>
As they witnessed this, the warriors from the various races below trembled in fear.
<br><br>
The descending type of Other Shore Tokens, which had a force of thousands of divine megatons, couldn't withstand even a single blow from this guy! Even though these members from various races were outstanding warriors of their races, it was not easy for them to deal with any of the Regal Jade sculptures. These sculptures didn't have any special ability, but the toughness of their bodies alone was extremely terrifying.
<br><br>
"Zen..."
<br><br>
The worry on Yan's face intensified.
<br><br>
Zen's expression became grimmer by the minute. But he kept stroking the chessboard and sent out the fourth batch of Regal Jade sculptures.
<br><br>
He knew that these sculptures probably couldn't defeat the Evil God.
<br><br>
The chessboard could only hold eighty-one pieces. If each sculpture held another one hundred divine megatons of force than the previous one, the strongest sculpture would have a force of eight thousand and one hundred divine megatons.
<br><br>
Such power was already terrifying. It would probably be difficult for a number of powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm to reach this level.
<br><br>
But in a battle of this level, relying on pure strength wouldn't work.
<br><br>
Zen naturally had his own plans. At the very least, he could use the Regal Jade chessboard to test part of the Evil God's strength, and could even predict the limits of his power.
<br><br>
The only concern was that using this way cost too many divine crystals.
<br><br>
Summoning all these Regal Jade sculptures would cost an astronomical number of the divine crystals.
<br><br>
The Evil God could see Zen's intentions, but he didn't care. Instead, he just satisfied him and showed him what he could do.
<br><br>
He wanted Zen to understand that no matter how much he struggled, it was all pointless. He was destined to be absorbed by the Evil God and integrated with him. The Evil God meant to destroy Zen's confidence first.
<br><br>
The Evil God once again destroyed the Regal Jade sculptures that Zen had sent at him.
<br><br>
But this time, it took the Evil God considerable effort to do it. He had to punch every sculpture to smash them into pieces. He sneered maliciously at Zen as he said, "It's impressive but still not enough to hurt me!"
<br><br>
Then came the fifth batch...
<br><br>
The sixth batch...
<br><br>
Each time, the sculptures came with increased strength. It would become more and more difficult for the Evil God to deal with them.
<br><br>
When the seventh batch of sculptures came to attack him, the Evil God began to take caution.
<br><br>
Bang! This time, the Evil God was unable to break the sculpture with his punch.
<br><br>
Not even a crack appeared on its surface.
<br><br>
"These sculptures could be my worthy opponents, if only in terms of force.
<br><br>
But unfortunately..."
<br><br>
He suddenly stretched out his hands, black bone blades extending from his arms. In a flash of movement, he rushed towards the first sculpture. Nobody knew what the bone blades were made of, but they cut through the tough Regal Jade sculpture as if cutting through a piece of tender flesh.
<br><br>
Chapter 3458 The Difference In Strength "Crack! Crack! Crack"
<br><br>
There were a few faint cracking sounds, before the statues were decapitated in just a few seconds.
<br><br>
In turn, Mount had gotten even more perplexed at the sight of it.
<br><br>
He couldn't resist those Regal Jade statues even in his best condition. He would choose to exile them, if it were him fighting with Zen.
<br><br>
Mount's failure could be attributed to his Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
Since his bloodline was strong, he didn't have to rely on the Other Shore Tokens very much.
<br><br>
The several Other Shore Tokens he possessed were of strengthening type, and he used them just for their Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
However, the Other Shore had experienced countless rounds of chaos. As a result, the Other Shore had obtained too many resources, various kinds of methods, and incredible skills as time passed.
<br><br>
So no matter how powerful Mount was, there was nothing he could do when he was bound by Chaim's abacus.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Other Shore Token that the Evil God had merged with should represent a civilization. Otherwise, it was impossible for such a world to descend.
<br><br>
"The Evil God was able to find a civilization to back him up, which was a great opportunity. Zen, just throw in the towel..." Mount murmured.
<br><br>
After the Evil God had destroyed the seventh group of Regal Jade statues, there was only one statue left beside Zen. It was the eighty-first statue.
<br><br>
The eightieth statue possessed 8, 000 divine megatons of power, and the eighty-first statue possessed 8, 100 divine megatons of power. There was just a very small difference between the two.
<br><br>
A moment ago, the Evil God had destroyed ten statues at a time, and to deal with the last one would just be a piece of cake for him.
<br><br>
The Evil God hovered in the air at a slow, leisurely pace. He was only over a hundred feet away from Zen. "Do you really just have such small, pathetic amount of power and such little tricks to fight me? I never take pity on the weak. If your remaining trump card is only this chessboard, I will not even be interested in merging with you..."
<br><br>
he said and mentally sighed.
<br><br>
Zen had once been the Creator to him, who was omnipotent. The Evil God used to kneel down before him and even look up to him.
<br><br>
Unconsciously, he had completely surpassed him. As the Evil God looked down on Zen, he felt that Zen was incomparably weak and could not withstand a single blow.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen didn't say anything as he was deep in thought.
<br><br>
'The extreme force should be up to about 8, 000 divine megatons...
<br><br>
But the black bone blades in his arms are even stronger.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade statues could not withstand a single blow from him.' As his thoughts swam in his head, he pushed out the last piece on the Regal Jade chessboard.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The last Regal Jade statue turned into a giant beast and pounced on the Evil God at a surprisingly high speed.
<br><br>
The moment the Regal Jade Beast rushed in front of the Evil God, the Evil God suddenly twisted his body and punched it in the face.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
When the Evil God had hit the Regal Jade Beast, it stretched out its huge claws and tried to grab its opponent.
<br><br>
With its strength, the last Regal Jade Beast was powerful enough to fight against the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God saw the two large claws rush towards him, he moved his arms, and the black bone blades in his arms turned into two rays of black radiance.
<br><br>
"Crack! Crack!"
<br><br>
The black radiance sliced off the Regal Jade Beast's sharp claws! "Crack!"
<br><br>
He suddenly raised his right arm, and then another black radiance shot out and cut the Regal Jade Beast's stomach into half! "Phew!"
<br><br>
Finally, the last Regal Jade Beast fell down.
<br><br>
"It's over. It's your turn."
<br><br>
The Evil God no longer hesitated. He rushed towards Zen like a raptor and swiftly covered the short distance between them.
<br><br>
He dragged the two black bone blades in his right arm across the air and spread a trace of energy. If the powerful warriors hadn't reinforced the space of the Chaotic Source World, then he would have been able to cause a series of cracks in the space.
<br><br>
"Whoosh, whoosh..."
<br><br>
Prepared to face the impact of the Evil God's attack, the cyan feather above Zen's head flashed faintly. He was like a leaf that swayed gently in the wind, as the feather followed the energy wave to constantly dodge and retreat.
<br><br>
There was only a serious expression on the Evil God's face.
<br><br>
Of course, he knew that Zen had a very artful bodily movement skill, but it was useless for him to dodge. In his eyes, everything that Zen was doing was all in vain.
<br><br>
He could evade one attack, but could he avoid 100 attacks, 1, 000 attacks, or even 10, 000 attacks? If he was hit even once, he would be crushed.
<br><br>
Between the two of them, one was invincible, and the other was adept. It was truly a fierce chase in the eyes of the crowd.
<br><br>
Although most people of the Pear Hill were still besieging the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, Yan was not in the mood to check on them. Her fists were balled so tightly that her nails dug into her flesh.
<br><br>
Her brother was in great danger now. Every attack from the Evil God made her so worried and scared! Sally, Hutton, Elvinia and the others seemed to be very nervous as well.
<br><br>
Among the crowd, however, only Dorothy looked different. Her eyes were filled with hesitation, and it looked like she did not dare to make a decision.
<br><br>
If a decision was made, then there would be a high price to pay. If that happened, then she would disappoint her grandmother who had painstakingly cultivated her for so many years.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Zen ran away and was able to avoid the attack from the black bone blades.
<br><br>
A ray of white light quickly appeared in his right eye.
<br><br>
"Authentic Visual World!"
<br><br>
The instant Zen had activated the Authentic Visual World, his eyebrows shot up to his forehead. There was still no flaw! He had long confirmed that the Authentic Visual World could not be used to check the Chaotic Source Realm warriors. Back when he had observed the queen ant, he also couldn't find a flaw on it.
<br><br>
But it didn't mean there was no flaw at all. It was just that the flaws had been covered up because of the Chaotic Source Spirits' special function.
<br><br>
By the time the Chaotic Source Spirits were exhausted, the weakness would show up naturally.
<br><br>
Now, the Evil God was not a powerful warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm; but there still wasn't a flaw that could be found on him, which made no sense.
<br><br>
'Is he indestructible in this strangely-colored world?' "Swish! Swish! Swish!"
<br><br>
The Evil God didn't care what Zen thought, and attacked him again.
<br><br>
When the black bone blades brushed past Zen once more, a layer of dark color suddenly emerged on his hand. It turned out that he protected his right hand with the Shade Stone liquid, and gently stroked the Evil God's bone blades right after.
<br><br>
"Endless Restoring Method!"
<br><br>
What Zen did was that he tried to disintegrate the bone blades.
<br><br>
When he made use of the theurgy of Truth of Three-Energy Construction, however, the black bone blades unexpectedly stayed unmoved! The Endless Restoring Method was not able to disintegrate all materials.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Zen's current ability only allowed him to break ordinary solid objects, and these black bone blades were clearly strong to a horrible extent.
<br><br>
Zen could not shatter them.
<br><br>
In return, the strong force eroded Zen's right hand the moment he touched the bone blades. His right arm grew numb even under the protection of the Shade Stone liquid.
<br><br>
While Zen was a little distracted, the Evil God quickly waved his hands and the bone blades rushed towards Zen's head. The black light under the highspeed spinning movement almost turned into a black flower.
<br><br>
The flower caged Zen. After he floated up and down inside it for a while, he was finally forced into a hopeless situation, and there was no room for him to dodge.
<br><br>
Chapter 3459 So Do I "Bang!"
<br><br>
The Evil God stomped right onto Zen's chest.
<br><br>
It was such a big blow that Zen fell down from the sky like a shooting star.
<br><br>
Boom! He came crashing to the ground, marking the earth with a crater of around ten thousand feet in diameter.
<br><br>
'Zen is helpless too.' Mount took a look at Zen who was defeated on the ground. He had expected this to happen.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Mount was shocked that Zen had returned after being exiled.
<br><br>
However, the power that Zen had displayed proved to be insufficient to go against the Evil God.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the statues that descended from the Regal Jade chessboard were powerful, but they would just trouble Mount a bit and he could still deal with them, let alone the Evil God who was more powerful.
<br><br>
Even most of the powerful warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm were no match for the Evil God now.
<br><br>
At the sight of this, Yan couldn't stand it anymore.
<br><br>
As she was about to take a step forward and help Zen, a hand stretched from behind her and dragged her away.
<br><br>
To her surprise, it was Dorothy.
<br><br>
"You are no match for the Evil God," Dorothy said.
<br><br>
Yan was displeased hearing this, "And you think you're a match?!"
<br><br>
"Neither am I," Dorothy responded, "but I can kill him."
<br><br>
As she spoke, she released Yan and made her way towards Zen.
<br><br>
Everyone who heard their words was in shock. How could Dorothy claim to be able to kill the Evil God, when Zen couldn't? However, from the look on Dorothy's face, they could tell that she was pretty convinced with herself.
<br><br>
"Boring fight."
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Evil God stretched out his black hand, and the bloodline power of the White Myth race returned to his body. Just then, the whirlpool in his hand opened for the second time.
<br><br>
Although the Evil God mentioned that he had no interest in Zen, he wanted to know Zen's secrets. Lucky for him, as they came from the same origin, he could just absorb Zen easily.
<br><br>
As the Evil God descended gracefully down to the crater, Dorothy flew over from afar, shouting, "Stay away from Zen!"
<br><br>
The Evil God heard it, but was not threatened one bit. The female talents were worthless in his eyes - they were too weak. With a flick of a finger, he could even kill them. The last thing he could do was be bothered by her.
<br><br>
But just as he brushed off Dorothy, a trembling force developed in his chest.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! Every time Dorothy took a step forward, the Evil God felt his heart beat ring in his ears. It got louder and louder the closer Dorothy came.
<br><br>
After the Evil God activated the Inheritance of World, he wasn't in the form of a human body anymore. How could he have a heartbeat? Still, the heartbeat persisted and still rang in his ears. It was not just some illusion.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! "Leave Zen alone," Dorothy threatened. "Or you'll die."
<br><br>
Aside from Dorothy and the Evil God, no one could hear the heartbeat at all.
<br><br>
It was the Heart of Accomplice.
<br><br>
In the past, Zen was able to obtain two Hearts of Accomplice from the Grand Sky Temple.
<br><br>
One of the hearts had been taken away by Athemar after he had learned it, while the second one was with Dorothy. Zen had asked her to hand the other over to the Origin Mountain.
<br><br>
Little did Zen know that Dorothy had kept it to herself.
<br><br>
With the help of the Ear Mice, Dorothy knew clearly the function of the Heart of Accomplice.
<br><br>
If one was deemed to be her accomplice, they would die if she did.
<br><br>
In the past, a Celestial Wolf member at the early stage of the Chaotic Source Realm had killed a powerful master, Lord Shaw with the help of the Heart of Accomplice.
<br><br>
She knew it was more than enough to deal with the Evil God.
<br><br>
"What is this heartbeat?"
<br><br>
The Evil God turned around and faced Dorothy who stood at the edge of the crater, finally acknowledging her presence.
<br><br>
Both the weird heartbeat and her decisive tone implied that she was not joking.
<br><br>
"You get scared too, don't you?" she asked, pleased to see him change his face. "If so, then leave. You can still live if you do. Otherwise, you'll die,"
<br><br>
Dorothy spoke, making the Evil God fall into a difficult decision.
<br><br>
He knew, just from her voice, that she wasn't lying. But how could he, the Evil God, be frightened away by a woman from the Oneness Sky Palace? This irritated more than it angered him.
<br><br>
The others, including Mount, who were watching from far away were stunned.
<br><br>
What was going on? Was Dorothy actually going to get the Evil God to retreat? "Gosh!" Seeing everything unfold, Athemar frowned. "Zen had obtained two Hearts of Accomplice from the Other Shore before. It seems that Dorothy has kept one rather than given it to the Origin Mountain."
<br><br>
"There are two Hearts of Accomplice? She is insane!"
<br><br>
Winchell gasped, stunned to hear what Dorothy had done. He then finally understood what was going on.
<br><br>
Dorothy did keep it, and she made sure to use it well.
<br><br>
But as powerful as it was, she would end up having to sacrifice her own life! Yasmin would be angry! The last thing she'd want to see was Dorothy's death.
<br><br>
But all they could do was watch Dorothy worriedly.
<br><br>
Thump! Thump! Thump! The heartbeat grew louder in Dorothy's and the Evil God's ears.
<br><br>
"You have ten seconds to leave," Dorothy said, her face was stone cold. She had hesitated for a long time previously, but now she just began to countdown, "Ten!"
<br><br>
"Nine!"
<br><br>
"Eight!"
<br><br>
"Seven!"
<br><br>
As she counted, streaks of black light began to surround the Evil God, and his eyes began to twitch involuntarily.
<br><br>
He was at a disadvantage - all because of a young woman who was weaker than him. He cursed angrily in his heart.
<br><br>
"Four."
<br><br>
"Three."
<br><br>
"Two."
<br><br>
As Dorothy counted, her voice roared louder and louder.
<br><br>
Just as she was about to scream the last digit, a voice suddenly echoed from the bottom of the crater. "Stop, Dorothy."
<br><br>
Dorothy's eyes flashed. It was Zen. Seeing Zen crawl up from the bottom of the crater, she fell into ecstasy, her gloomy eyes flashing with excitement and pleasure. "Zen! Are you okay?"
<br><br>
"You didn't give the Heart of Accomplice to the Origin Mountain, did you?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, his face was serious and unmoving.
<br><br>
Dorothy lowered her sight looking down on the ground. "Yeah." She had lied to Zen about this, and she couldn't help but feel guilty for it.
<br><br>
"This is not the Other Shore Token that you should bear," Zen scolded.
<br><br>
"Withdraw the Heart of Accomplice and go back this instant!"
<br><br>
"But you..." Dorothy spoke back very anxiously, refusing to give up on what she had just done.
<br><br>
The Evil God only had a life. If he wanted to keep it, he would make sure to listen. She thought this was the best plan.
<br><br>
"Don't you want to sacrifice her to save everyone here?" the Evil God teased, not missing any opportunity to provoke Zen.
<br><br>
Zen turned around and looked at him coldly. "It seems that the Heart of Accomplice frightens you, and though I would love to see you squirm, this isn't worth it." Zen stared right at him. "We don't need to sacrifice anyone to defeat you."
<br><br>
As soon as he finished speaking, a bright ray of cyan light burst from the top of his head.
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact appeared above Zen's head, spinning continuously.
<br><br>
Zen's voice spread out like wildfire. "You have the Inheritance of World, so do I!"
<br><br>
Chapter 3460 The Inheritance Of The Regal Jade World The cyan light spread out from Zen and mixed in with the strangely-colored world summoned by the Evil God. Soon enough, the area started to change.
<br><br>
The rough, brownish-yellow ground became extremely smooth, and it seemed that a layer of emerald green glaze covered its surface. The Regal Jade Crystals were like precious ores as they grew and formed jade flowers.
<br><br>
The strangely-colored world was shone brightly by the cyan light, which made the space more strange and unique, and possess a peculiar clean feel to it.
<br><br>
A second world had descended! The two different worlds merged together! Everyone present were stunned as they looked around with awe in their faces.
<br><br>
"Another world?"
<br><br>
"This is too crazy! Did Zen make this?"
<br><br>
"Is Zen also the spokesperson of a civilization?"
<br><br>
Even the leaders at the gate of the Chaotic Source World were also speechless and dumbfounded.
<br><br>
After all, the current situation in the Chaotic Source World was completely beyond their imagination.
<br><br>
Everyone should be able to exert their own abilities to dig out the Chaotic Source Spirits, and then reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Yet at that moment, everyone's attention was not on the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, but on Zen and the Evil God.
<br><br>
When Winchell saw the cyan light shine brightly and the world descend, he felt slightly relieved.
<br><br>
If Dorothy had really died in the Chaotic Source World, then a storm would arise on the Origin Mountain. Given Yasamin's strong-headed attitude, it was very likely that she would hunt the Black Ship on her own.
<br><br>
"What a surprise!" As soon as Fuxi saw the cyan light world as well, his lips stretched into a helpless smile. "It seems that in addition to Gerald, there is another civilization that has chosen you. I wonder where this civilization ranks," he murmured to himself.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, there were a lot of civilizations that hid on the Other Shore. Some of them were strong, and some were weak. All of them were vastly different from each other.
<br><br>
The civilizations ranked outside the top 100 were weaker, and those ranked far behind were quite frail. However, undoubtedly, the top 100 civilizations were quite powerful.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization hadn't left many footprints on the Other Shore, and even their Regal Jade Temple had once been destroyed. Since the civilization had been hiding in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, no one present had recognized the origin of such a world.
<br><br>
That was why Fuxi had no idea that the Regal Jade Civilization was as powerful as the top ten civilizations! Meanwhile, Mount gazed at the beams of cyan light that charged towards him. His blank, emotionless face finally changed and he didn't know if he should laugh or cry. He had thought that Zen would definitely lose, but things went on differently. It was out of his expectation.
<br><br>
More to his surprise, Zen was able to summon a world! "For some special reasons, I didn't want to summon this world, nor did I want to use the Inheritance of World," Zen spoke.
<br><br>
His voice suddenly sounded quite ethereal, like it had come from a distant cave sometimes far away, then sometimes very close.
<br><br>
Ever since he had fused with the Civilization Artifact, he had realized that he was able to summon a Regal Jade World and even greatly strengthen himself by using the Inheritance of World. That was the support from a civilization, not just a Regal Jade chessboard.
<br><br>
Yet, once he had used that ability, it would cause a huge sensation. Thus, Zen had never tried using it previously.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Regal Jade Spirit had reminded him that there was still the hostility between them and the Nihility race. Had it not been for the fact that he had no other choice, he would've tried his best not to reveal the Civilization Artifact. Therefore, Zen had kept it up to the last moment.
<br><br>
It was only when Dorothy was about to sacrifice herself, that he summoned this Regal Jade World.
<br><br>
Rumble! A Regal Jade Crystal grew from a thorn on the ground. It gently lifted Dorothy up as it grew, then stretched up to a distance of several thousand feet, before it sent her to the other side.
<br><br>
Then, another Regal Jade Crystal grew from the crater and slowly lifted Zen up.
<br><br>
"I gave you freedom, because I wanted you to watch the world carefully.
<br><br>
You are a great talent, and you are entitled to ask for what you want from the world. Unfortunately, you're greedy and bloodthirsty, which greatly disappointed me..."
<br><br>
As Zen spoke, he gently did a tapping motion towards the Evil God. A Regal Jade Crystal suddenly grew out of the ground and hit the Evil God hard.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
As the Evil God's body was thrown into the air, another Regal Jade Crystal stretched out of the ground and hit him again.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Crystals grew out of the ground and extended up to thousands of feet, and repeatedly hit the Evil God.
<br><br>
The Evil God could have avoided such attacks, but he didn't have the slightest intention of dodging. He just allowed the Regal Jade Crystals to hit him.
<br><br>
Upon closer observation, it could be seen that the Evil God's face was full of excitement and ecstasy.
<br><br>
Ever since Zen had entered the Chaotic Source World, his weakness had been the Evil God's greatest disappointment. But after another world had descended, Zen had finally shown the strength that made him worthy to be his opponent! After the Evil God had been hit dozens of time, bones spurred out of his arms and intertwined around him at a confusing speed. All the Regal Jade Crystals that hit him broke into pieces and fell on the ground.
<br><br>
"Save your tricks," said the Evil God.
<br><br>
In turn, Zen glanced coldly at him. The Regal Jade Crystals under his feet started to grow again. This time, they didn't lift him up, but wrapped him inside them.
<br><br>
Buzz! Just then, a halo appeared around the entire Regal Jade World.
<br><br>
The light circle shrank continuously until it converged in the center, and finally merged in Zen's body.
<br><br>
Buzz! Next, another light circle flashed on the surfaces of all the Regal Jade Crystals and quickly gathered in the center as well.
<br><br>
With the support of the Regal Jade World, Zen was indeed able to contend with the Evil God.
<br><br>
To defeat the Evil God, however, he had to use the Inheritance of World.
<br><br>
Now, Zen was unwilling to waste his time either.
<br><br>
As the light circles converged, his body had undergone considerable changes.
<br><br>
First, his eyebrows glittered with dark cyan crystals, then so did his hair, skin, and flesh.
<br><br>
The Inheritance of World entailed changing oneself completely by the use of the power of the descended world.
<br><br>
While Zen endured the baptism of cyan light circles, his entire body became thoroughly crystalized! Cyan feathers grew from his back one after another. He slightly opened his eyes, and diamond-shaped crystals also appeared in his pupils.
<br><br>
At that moment, his aura had also undergone a tremendous change. Apart from his appearance that was still fifty percent similar to his original look, everything else was different. His voice, breath, and the characteristics that defined him all disappeared! Splash! He shook his body slightly, then the crystals wrapped around him shattered.
<br><br>
His dark cyan feathers rose slightly, which made him glide freely in midair as if he had integrated himself with the space.
<br><br>
The members of the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mice, and disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill could only look up at him in silence.
<br><br>
"Is he Yan's brother?! The way Yan described his strength is an understatement!" exclaimed Natalie, whose jaw dropped in shock.
<br><br>
Chapter 3461 Sealing Energy Natalie remembered Yan often talking about how powerful her brother was.
<br><br>
But she figured that Yan was exaggerating as she bragged—it was natural for young girls to admire their older brothers, after all. But once she met Zen herself, she realized how wrong she was. Among the Pear Hill warriors of the younger generation, Natalie couldn't think of a single one who could dream of contending against Zen.
<br><br>
Now, it seemed as though Yan was even being too modest when she described her brother.
<br><br>
Forgetting about the younger generation… Even the seniors who had already reached the Chaotic Source Realm and the Desire World couldn't fight against him.
<br><br>
The Evil God gazed at the crystal Zen as he would gaze at a lover. "Very good… I like it…"
<br><br>
In the next moment, he had his hands crossed. Black spikes began spreading out of his figure until his entire body spiraled up into a black cyclone.
<br><br>
Phew! The cyclone shook gently.
<br><br>
It was as though an enormous hand had drawn a black line in the sky, sweeping right past Zen's body.
<br><br>
It was such a rapid movement that no one even caught the motion with their bare eyes.
<br><br>
Zen didn't move an inch, but his crystallized arm was broken in a second.
<br><br>
A thousand feet behind Zen, the Evil God halted. He grabbed Zen's severed hand and gnawed at it. The cyan crystal was hard and crisp, making crackling noises as the Evil God bored his teeth into it. Soon, he had swallowed it completely.
<br><br>
"Tastes good," the Evil God clasped his hands in satisfaction, and the crystal fragments fell to the ground.
<br><br>
For a second, Zen's eyes widened in surprise. The Evil God's speed suddenly erupted, indicating that he hadn't been using his full strength earlier.
<br><br>
"What an amazing speed…" As Zen muttered, he could feel his body tremble while a cyan arm grew out of his broken limb.
<br><br>
"Thank you for your praise! Let me show you once again! This time, it'll be your head."
<br><br>
The Evil God mocked Zen menacingly before he turned into another black cyclone.
<br><br>
Once again, a thin, black line swept across the sky and through Zen's body.
<br><br>
No one could see either of the opponents' movements clearly. All they caught was Zen shaking slightly in the air. When the Evil God stopped and hovered in the sky, his hands were empty—instead of taking Zen's head, he ended up losing his own leg.
<br><br>
The leg formed from black energy appeared in Zen's hand. With a smug smile, he shook the leg and threw it to the ground like a piece of trash.
<br><br>
The Inheritance of World was an extremely powerful method—it could turn the cultivator into forms of energy in a short period of time.
<br><br>
Everything in the Regal Jade World was made out of Regal Jade Crystals— even the creatures of the Regal Jade World lived in these crystals. The newly descended Inheritance of World had Zen entirely crystallized.
<br><br>
The same went for the strangely-colored world summoned by the Evil God.
<br><br>
It turned him into a being of black energy—it didn't matter what happened to his body. Any limb Zen tore off regenerated in a blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Phew! Whoosh! Both of them launched an attack once again.
<br><br>
The Evil God's burst of strength had increased. He activated his speed to a shocking extreme.
<br><br>
Zen's movement technique, of course, was ingenious. He avoided the Evil God's attacks with ease, and never did he lack an incredible and immediate counterattack.
<br><br>
The crowd below watched the fight with their jaws slack.
<br><br>
"Are they playing some sort of dismembering game?"
<br><br>
"They're ripping each other's limbs off…they're complete freaks!"
<br><br>
"I've never seen such a fight before…"
<br><br>
A fight of this level should have only been possible between spokespersons of large civilizations.
<br><br>
These spokespersons were all super powerful warriors of the Source World But Zen and the Evil God were exceptions at the moment—they had each found a Civilization Artifact in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World, triggering such a high-level battle.
<br><br>
The power of each of their Civilization Artifacts had still been suppressed in the Lust World.
<br><br>
If these two civilizations could return to the Desire World, or to the higher stages, the pair of Civilization Artifacts would display even more terrifying power.
<br><br>
Not only the talents in the Chaotic Source World hadn't ever seen a fight of this calibre—even Fuxi, such a powerful being, was flabbergasted.
<br><br>
For someone as powerful as Fuxi, to summon a world of a civilization and merge with the Inheritance of World wasn't something particularly new. But how could two people who hadn't even stepped into the Chaotic Source Realm, throw fists as they both summoned a world and merged with the Inheritance of World? It was too inconceivable.
<br><br>
If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed such a thing could even happen.
<br><br>
No matter how much their bodies were dismembered, Zen and the Evil God had no trouble restoring their bodies.
<br><br>
As the cyan and black lines collided further, Zen gradually gained the upper hand.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization supporting him was way more powerful.
<br><br>
With the pair of wings that originally belonged to the Regal Jade World's Wing King, the bodily movement skill he displayed clearly indicated the Regal Jade Civilization's superiority.
<br><br>
Once Zen adapted to the Evil God's speed, he leisurely waited for the latter to attack him.
<br><br>
Every time the Evil God turned into a black line as he rushed toward Zen, his cyan wings trembled. Zen had no trouble avoiding the Evil God's attacks with mere slight movements.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
As the two fought, Zen tore off one of the Evil God's arms again.
<br><br>
Initially, he didn't deal with the Evil God's broken limbs—he casually threw them away.
<br><br>
The severed limbs fell and dissolved into black energy, disappearing from the strangely-colored world.
<br><br>
"Zen, the overall energy of the world one summons always remains the same. The Evil God can easily recycle the energy and use it again. But you can seal that energy," the Regal Jade Spirit explained.
<br><br>
Zen's eyes flashed with excitement—he now got to the crux of the matter.
<br><br>
If he didn't deal with the broken limbs of the Evil God, the latter could easily gain his energy back. That would have made the fight endless.
<br><br>
When the Evil God tried attacking again, Zen merely ripped off one of his legs.
<br><br>
This time, he threw the limb to the ground, where a Regal Jade Crystal suddenly sprouted. The crystal's surface was like chalcedony, wrapping up the Evil God's severed leg.
<br><br>
The limb couldn't dissipate—it was now like an insect wrapped in amber, sealed forever.
<br><br>
Seeing that, the Evil God frowned. Without giving it another thought, he charged at Zen once again.
<br><br>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh… As their fight went on, Zen won more than he lost.
<br><br>
Crystals were growing everywhere from the ground. Within them, there were the arms, legs and all other parts of the Evil God's body.
<br><br>
After a moment, over a hundred broken body parts were sealed in crystals.
<br><br>
It was an extremely strange sight to behold.
<br><br>
Energy from the severed body parts of the Evil God couldn't be recycled.
<br><br>
Initially, he was over ten feet high. But after using his energy to regenerate his body parts over and over again, his enormous body began shrinking foot by foot.
<br><br>
There was no doubt that the Evil God was still extremely ferocious, but he had shrunk down to the size of an ordinary child.
<br><br>
Chapter 3462 Eternal Annihilation "The Evil God's body is getting smaller!"
<br><br>
"Zen has sealed his limbs! He's unable to take them back!"
<br><br>
"Keep this up and the Evil God is bound to lose!"
<br><br>
There was a faint smile even on Mount's face. He was finally witnessing the defeat of the Evil God.
<br><br>
Zen's method was not ingenious, but was direct and effective.
<br><br>
But the Evil God figured it out, too.
<br><br>
The Evil God's eyes flashed with a somber black light. As he once again charged toward Zen, his direction suddenly changed. He now bore down in a vertical downward arc, aiming straight for his severed limbs! By smashing those damn Regal Jade Crystals, he would be able to turn his limbs into energy that would evaporate into the surroundings and integrate into his own body.
<br><br>
But Zen had already expected this move when he had sealed the limbs. He wasn't about to let the Evil God have his way.
<br><br>
Scratch! Scratch! Scratch! The Regal Jade Crystals rapidly rose from the ground like long and narrow tubes. The Evil God's severed limbs and other body parts floated within them. In the blink of an eye, all the crystals and their contents were sent to the edge of the Regal Jade World, scattered equidistantly in all directions.
<br><br>
The Evil God's face darkened as he lunged for the arm closest to him.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Crystal that contained it flew rapidly, but the Evil God was faster.
<br><br>
Clang! The Regal Jade Crystal shattered in the Evil God's clutches. As his severed arm broke out, it turned into wisps of black energy and evaporated in the air. The Evil God's body increased a little in size after.
<br><br>
But as this happened, Zen appeared near him at an odd angle. Zen waved his hands covered with crystals, and tore off the Evil God's legs again! As the legs were severed, two Regal Jade Crystals lunged like serpents, grabbing the limbs, and speeding away.
<br><br>
"You!" Rage crossed the Evil God's face, but it showed a faint hint of fear.
<br><br>
"Let's see how small you can get," Zen said with a smile.
<br><br>
The Evil God glared at Zen and went straight after another severed limb.
<br><br>
In terms of bodily movement skill, the Evil God was no match to Zen.
<br><br>
Moreover, Zen had full control of where the limbs went. He would never let the Evil God get them back.
<br><br>
Whenever the Evil God approached a limb with his powerful explosive force, Zen would always be there first, or just at his heels.
<br><br>
The Evil God got nothing back. Instead, more parts of his body were just cut off by Zen. At some point, even if he fought back, it would have been easier for Zen to deal with him.
<br><br>
The power the Evil God was endowed with by the Inheritance of World was slowly reduced by Zen.
<br><br>
In no time, the Evil God's body shrank from four feet to three feet, then two feet. In the end, the Evil God was only as small as a baby.
<br><br>
"The Inheritance of World should be your last resort," Zen said as he flapped his wings, flying toward the Evil God not far away. "Destroying your soul would show your real body, wouldn't it?"
<br><br>
Once a warrior unleashed the Inheritance of World, their whole bodies would be turned into energy, scattered everywhere.
<br><br>
The Evil God was like that, and so was Zen.
<br><br>
There were two ways to kill the masters who unleashed the Inheritance of World: exhausting their energy to force their real bodies to appear, or directly destroying the whole world they summoned.
<br><br>
It was difficult for Zen to destroy the Evil God's strangely-colored world, but he had a way to exhaust the energy of this world. No matter how powerful the world was, it was still an Other Shore Token. The energy contained in it was limited! This was why Zen had sealed some of the Evil God's energy in the Regal Jade Crystals when he cut off the Evil God's body parts.
<br><br>
Dismantled little by little, the Evil God floated in the air, glaring up at Zen, his eyes twitching.
<br><br>
At this moment, he truly felt Zen was mighty again.
<br><br>
He remembered the first time he challenged Zen.
<br><br>
Zen had laughed at his careful plans, his calculating schemes, his ambitions, even his wife's expectations for him.
<br><br>
That experience of helplessness still stung him.
<br><br>
After he encountered the Black Ship, he gradually understood the truth of this world and understood Zen's real strength. He devoured Souls of Light, explored, and cultivated on the Other Shore like mad, until Shera told him that no one under the Chaotic Source Realm could defeat him.
<br><br>
The Evil God knew himself better. He had merged with a civilization. Even the masters at the Chaotic Source Realm couldn't defeat him, let alone those of weaker strength! When he came into contact with the so-called talents of various races on the Other Shore, he had felt they were nothing compared to him! Except for Mount, nobody had ever posed a threat to him. But in the end, he still couldn't defeat Zen.
<br><br>
Was this the strength of Zen, his creator? Spotting Zen flap his wings intending to pull apart more pieces of him, the Evil God gave a relieved smile. His diminished body finally broke down completely, and the remaining black energy dissipated in all directions.
<br><br>
At the same time, the voice of the Evil God echoed in the strangely-colored world.
<br><br>
"Zen, you really impressed me. But do you think you can defeat me like this? You are too naive! Since you have forced my hand, I have no choice but to show you eternal annihilation!"
<br><br>
Rumble! The strangely-colored world began to shake, shattering a great number of the Regal Jade Crystals overlapping it. The destructive aura spread around the whole world, like doomsday had come.
<br><br>
All this time, the various races had been focused on fighting the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, ignoring the fight between Zen and the Evil God.
<br><br>
However, the violent shaking finally caught everyone's attention. Their expressions changed in an instant.
<br><br>
Buzz! Countless black snakes crawled out from the rippled dark clouds in the sky.
<br><br>
They coiled and lunged down, turning into huge meteorites falling down! Feeling the power of the meteorites, Zen slit his eyes. "How is that possible? I have consumed most of his energy. But the power of the meteorites is... So incredible!"
<br><br>
It was impossible to estimate the meteorites' strength. Zen felt fear shoot instinctively through him.
<br><br>
What was more horrifying was that there were more than one huge fourlegged black snake! More snakes appeared, turning into black meteorites.
<br><br>
Once these meteorites struck, they were bound to destroy everything in the strangely-colored world.
<br><br>
"Hahaha!" The Evil God's laughter rang out across the strangely-colored world. "I like seeing you fear, Zen."
<br><br>
Chapter 3463 The Burning World Just as Zen wondered about the origin of the Evil God's energy, the Regal Jade Spirit's voice resounded once again. "Burning an Other Shore Token will produce unimaginable power, and he's burning the entire world…truly powerful."
<br><br>
"He's burning the world? He's crazy!" Zen's eyes were wide in shock.
<br><br>
"You didn't know? He's a maniac. There's nothing he can't do," said the Regal Jade Spirit.
<br><br>
Zen was well aware of how difficult it was to be the spokesperson of a civilization.
<br><br>
Among the countless creatures in the Lust World, maybe only he and the Evil God were lucky enough to be such spokespersons.
<br><br>
A civilization pinned everything on the Evil God but he chose to burn it all to win a fight? It was an insane idea! "Dorothy, Yan, Elvinia, Chaim… You'd better run away from this world now! Everything will be destroyed!" Zen urgently reminded his companions.
<br><br>
But he didn't need to tell them for them to know something was terribly wrong.
<br><br>
The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had even started running toward the edge of the strangely-colored world.
<br><br>
At this point, the Separate Abyss race and the Ear Mouse race finally gave up their attack on the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits—their lives held priority at this critical moment.
<br><br>
As they approached the world's edge, a mass of black energy burst like flames. The Regal Jade Crystals were instantly engulfed in the black fire, and a black thread appeared before them.
<br><br>
"The world is divided?"
<br><br>
Mount raised his hands to try to move the people from the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill out of the strangely-colored world.
<br><br>
It wasn't out of kindness—he never planned on changing his position. But Zen had defeated the Evil God, so he was merely returning the favor.
<br><br>
But as soon as the space channel that was involved with the truth of space was established, it was blocked by a strict black divisive thread.
<br><br>
Just as Mount gave it another try, another figure appeared nearby—it was none other than Fuxi.
<br><br>
"My respects, Human Sovereign." Mount bowed to Fuxi.
<br><br>
The latter snorted in contempt. Mount was merely the avatar of a Chaos Ancient God.
<br><br>
Fuxi came to save people, more specifically, to save Yan.
<br><br>
Never did he expect the Evil God to go crazy.
<br><br>
In Fuxi's eyes, spokespersons of civilizations were common. He had even already killed a master who had activated the Inheritance of World before.
<br><br>
But no spokesperson dared burn the civilization behind him—he'd sooner die than do so.
<br><br>
It wasn't only a matter of truth punishment, but also a matter of trust.
<br><br>
The civilization entrusted the Civilization Artifact to the Evil God—they wholeheartedly put their faith in him. And yet, he chose to burn the entire civilization as if it was a mere Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
While Fuxi couldn't recognize the civilization's origin, he knew that it was definitely not on a low level. Even if it had hidden in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World and suppressed its own strength greatly, the consequences of its burning were bound to be horrible.
<br><br>
Phew! And so Fuxi took a deep breath.
<br><br>
He stepped forward, accumulating terrifying power.
<br><br>
Puff! Then, he pushed his palm toward the world.
<br><br>
A black and white mark of Eight Diagrams was created from nowhere, printed on the world's surface.
<br><br>
There were two ways to defeat the Inheritance of World—first was to find and kill the owner's real body, and second, was to destroy the entire world.
<br><br>
Fuxi had chosen the second way—it was a simple and rough method, but it was effective.
<br><br>
Fuxi's attack was strong enough to crush the entire Chaotic Source World, even as he kept his strength in check. At the very least, he could open the world.
<br><br>
But the huge palm of Eight Diagrams passed right through the 'world' and shot out the other side. It hit the southern peak within the ring-shaped mountain range and smashed the peak to pieces before it collapsed.
<br><br>
The great power surprisingly caused no harm whatsoever to the burning world.
<br><br>
'The space is isolated?' Mount raised his brows at the thought.
<br><br>
Examining his own palm, Fuxi depressed, his face grim. He turned to Mount and asked, "What happened?"
<br><br>
When it came to understanding the space, he was nowhere nearly as good as Mount.
<br><br>
But the latter shook his head, confused. "The whole world seems to have been isolated while being burnt…it doesn't look like it belongs to this space. I've never seen this before."
<br><br>
"Will the burning world… really have such an effect?"
<br><br>
It was the first time they had ever witnessed someone burning an entire world. Never did Fuxi ever think it could happen—it dawned on him just how much everything was out of his control at that moment.
<br><br>
As it was all he could do, he threw a few more palm strikes at the world.
<br><br>
The ring-shaped mountain range were all crushed by the palm prints of Eight Diagrams. But they still couldn't directly touch the world—it seemed like a mirage at this point.
<br><br>
Outside the Chaotic Source World, everyone was in an uproar while the leaders looked grim.
<br><br>
"So even the Human Sovereign can't stop him?"
<br><br>
"They're just going to die in there?"
<br><br>
"God… he's really a madman! He's already burned the world to this degree.
<br><br>
Even we would be trapped there to die… let alone all those juniors!"
<br><br>
Leaders from the Oneness Sky Palace, the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mouse race and some other races were in despair.
<br><br>
Any sense of hope seemed to have been lost from these leaders. They had traveled thousands of miles to send their juniors to the Chaotic Source World. How could they accept such an end? In contrast, the leaders of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the New Moon race and the Sun Crow race seemed more than pleased about the situation.
<br><br>
Most of their clansmen had been swept away by the hurricane. Even though they all hurried back, a good portion of them were still outside the core area. So the loss of their races wouldn't be as great as others'.
<br><br>
Khalid of the Bearing race, in particular, had already been sent out of the Chaotic Source World—he had the luxury of watching everything unfold from a distance, away from the chaos. But he also had a lingering fear at the sight of the world burning.
<br><br>
"Haha!"
<br><br>
"No one can leave!"
<br><br>
"Come and taste the great fear of annihilation!"
<br><br>
The Evil God's voice echoed throughout the space.
<br><br>
"Is there no way out?"
<br><br>
At this point, Zen had grown anxious.
<br><br>
The first black meteorite fell from the sky, headed for the disciples from Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
For a moment, the disciples watched the object fall, their faces having gone pale.
<br><br>
They were all done for if the meteorite hit them.
<br><br>
"Up!"
<br><br>
Clenching his hand, Zen conjured up countless Regal Jade Crystals to shield the disciples from the meteorite.
<br><br>
Although the crystals were extremely solid, they were easily smashed by the black energy of the meteorite, as though they were mere dry weeds on open land.
<br><br>
With another wave of his hand, Zen made several more crystals grow from the ground, wrapping around the Oneness Sky Palace disciples and pulling them to the side.
<br><br>
The moment the disciples slid out of range, the meteorite landed on the ground.
<br><br>
Chapter 3464 Burning The Eye Of Will Boom! The black meteorite pummeled into the ground with a loud crashing sound.
<br><br>
The collision caused the solid ground to spread out like water.
<br><br>
In the area where the black meteorite fell, there was an array, in which there were some nonhuman creatures.
<br><br>
They had long given up on fighting for the Chaotic Source Spirits. They just wanted to stay in the array and wait for the end of the activity in the Chaotic Source World. Then they would be sent out of here.
<br><br>
They thought they were safe since they weren't involved in the fights anymore. Yet, an undeserved catastrophe had unexpectedly hit them! The black meteorite's fall shocked and smashed the light shield of the array into pieces. In the blink of an eye, the energy had vanished all of the creatures inside.
<br><br>
Boom! It wasn't long before the second meteorite fell down closely.
<br><br>
This meteorite brushed past the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, who had already reached her limit and exhausted ninety percent of the Chaotic Source Spirits in her body. But now all her remaining Chaotic Source Spirits were depleted, even though the meteorite just grazed the back side of her huge body.
<br><br>
Since she had also lost the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits, she became extremely fragile. Her feet burst instantly under the impact of the falling meteorite, and then thousands of Chaotic Source Spirits broke out from her wounds.
<br><br>
If it had been another time, all the talents would probably scramble to grab the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
But now, the world was going to be destroyed. Everyone had to run for their lives. Even the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was desperately trying to escape from it. Who would care about the Chaotic Source Spirits then? Unfortunately, they couldn't escape from the world's destruction.
<br><br>
"What should I do?" Zen whispered.
<br><br>
"There is only one way," the Regal Jade Spirit replied.
<br><br>
"Tell me!" Zen urged.
<br><br>
"Before the whole world is totally burnt, find where the Evil God is and kill him," the Regal Jade Spirit answered.
<br><br>
"I don't know where he is!" Naturally, Zen was as anxious as ants on a hot pan.
<br><br>
"The world he summoned is almost perfect without any flaws. But, the Evil God himself has his own flaws," No. 9527 suddenly spoke. "Use your Sword Texture Technique and the Authentic Visual World, and give it a try."
<br><br>
Hearing this, Zen flew up without hesitation. A ray of strong, white light shone from his right eye.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
At that moment, the two overlapping worlds materialized in his eye.
<br><br>
Everything was crystal clear.
<br><br>
Zen circled around in the air as he repeatedly observed his surroundings.
<br><br>
But this chaotic world didn't have any flaws.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Driven by the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, he activated the Eye of Will to the maximum extent.
<br><br>
In turn, the whole world became even clearer to him.
<br><br>
Zen's right eye could see those tiny holes and the fur of the non-human creatures on the ground as clear as day.
<br><br>
Even then, the strangely-colored world remained flawless… 'This is not the way.' While Zen felt anxious, he suddenly thought of something and said, "I can burn the Eye of Will!"
<br><br>
Generally speaking, the power that the Other Shore Token released could be much greater than usual if it was burned.
<br><br>
"No way!" No. 9527 stopped him.
<br><br>
Everyone knew that the Other Shore Tokens could not be burned.
<br><br>
Even the Crimson Golden Sand in Stage One of the Other Shore was also able to unleash a large amount of energy when burned, but doing so would violate the truth rules of chaos. If the truth attacked the person who burned the Other Shore Token, his or her entire inner world would turn into a sea of fire.
<br><br>
Lastly, he or she would also be affected and killed.
<br><br>
Such was the way of the unbearable law and truth! There was once a time in the divine land, when one Yellow Emperor Guard burned an Other Shore Token. As a result, he had died a miserable death.
<br><br>
"I can't find other ways except for this!" Zen exclaimed.
<br><br>
His gaze continued to wander around, but he still couldn't find any flaws in this world, and of course, he couldn't find the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Burn it," the Regal Jade Spirit said out of the blue.
<br><br>
"Do you want to kill Zen?" No. 9527 shot back. "The counterattack of the truth rules is indeed very powerful, but we might be able to withstand it,"
<br><br>
the Regal Jade Spirit explained calmly.
<br><br>
"The Civilization Artifact is enough to help you resist the consequences. I can help you, Zen."
<br><br>
Ever since Zen had carried the Regal Jade Civilization, their fates had been already bound together. With the Regal Jade Spirit willing to help him take such a consequence, he no longer hesitated.
<br><br>
Buzz! At that point, the Eye of Will and the Civilization Artifact in Zen's inner world flashed at the same time.
<br><br>
All the creatures in his inner world felt an unusual energy fluctuation in the sky, which made them gasp in horror.
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact was swiftly unfolded. The thorns on it extended and bent continuously, making the artifact look like a spider that hung upside down in the sky. The Eye of Will was in its center.
<br><br>
Once the Regal Jade Spirit was ready, Zen began to burn the Eye of Will. A flame suddenly lit up on the surface of the Eye of Will.
<br><br>
Crack...
<br><br>
As Eye of Will burst into flames, his right eye also started to burn. His eye wouldn't be able to resist the flames, even though it was crystallized. The fires soon licked at the crystals around his eye, cracking them fast. The crisp sounds of cracking continued to spread, and crystals on half his face were cracked! Buzz...
<br><br>
Through the burning Eye of Will, he could see the whole world more clearly.
<br><br>
He could also clearly see the structure of each material at just a glance. He could tell how heavy a stone was and which direction it would roll down to, as well as whether it would crack or not in the process of rolling down.
<br><br>
At the same time, all the information flowed to his head like seawater.
<br><br>
If his soul wasn't strong enough, the torrent of information would have already stuffed and destroyed his Memory Flame! "I see him!"
<br><br>
He saw a few thin white lines on the ground. Each thin line was a few hundred feet long and was connected to the others, outlining a human shape. At the intersections of the thin lines were five indistinct spots.
<br><br>
"These spots are the flaws?"
<br><br>
Still, Zen couldn't think of anything else under such a difficult situation.
<br><br>
Even if the Regal Jade Spirit could help him bear the price of burning the Eye of Will, Zen couldn't burn it at will as it still had its limits. Moreover, there was a time limit.
<br><br>
Just then, Zen turned into a beam of cyan light and ruthlessly bombarded the first white spot! "Bang!"
<br><br>
White cracks ruptured from the white spot from the impact of his punch, then the two white lines that were connected to it also dimmed.
<br><br>
"It worked!" his eyes lit up as he cried out.
<br><br>
Quickly, he rushed towards another white spot again.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Evil God who hid inside the world cackled wildly. His laughter continued to echo in the world that was being destroyed. Yet, he was also surprised that Zen had actually found the world's flaws.
<br><br>
When the Evil God came back to his senses, three black four-legged snakes appeared on the surface of the next white spot. The black snakes quickly turned into three overlapping black crystal shields, and completely covered the spot.
<br><br>
"Smash!"
<br><br>
Without a second thought, Zen directly bombarded those black crystal shields.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
He smashed the pile of three black crystal shields and destroyed the white spot. Then, he quickly dashed towards the next one! Zen didn't even stop for a moment. In turn, the Evil God hastily gathered energy to protect the next spot. He ended up making six black crystal shields to cover the third white spot.
<br><br>
Chapter 3465 The Calculation Civilization "Shatter!"
<br><br>
Zen didn't care how thick the black crystal shields were. He was only aware that time was running tight.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! Boom! After several punches, the black crystal shields and the white spot below shattered into pieces.
<br><br>
"The last one!"
<br><br>
Zen gritted his teeth. Looking down, he saw that the countless four-legged black snakes had coiled around one another to form an incredibly massive black crystal shield. The interior of this translucent crystal shield presented a complex pattern.
<br><br>
Narrowing his eyes, he willed the wings on his back to launch himself towards the black crystal shield, arcing gracefully in the air.
<br><br>
Bang! With a violent collision, cracks appeared on the Regal Jade Crystals on the surface of Zen's body. However, the black crystal shield remained unscathed.
<br><br>
"Again!"
<br><br>
Zen jumped high and dashed down toward the black crystal shield once more.
<br><br>
Bang! An ear-piercing crash sounded, but to Zen's frustration, the black crystal shield still stood firm.
<br><br>
By burning the world, the Evil God had gathered more energy than Zen did.
<br><br>
The black crystal shield he had conjured was made from an unimaginable amount of energy, rendering it practically unbreakable.
<br><br>
Zen took a deep breath. He knew that if he wanted to destroy this shield, he'd have to burn the Regal Jade World.
<br><br>
But there was no way the Regal Jade Spirit would allow it, and even Zen wasn't willing to do it. He was nowhere near as crazy as the Evil God, who burned an entire civilization that had supported him.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Zen jumped high again and kept striking the black crystal shield, over and over again.
<br><br>
As he crashed into the shield, huge black meteorites fell down, one after another.
<br><br>
Fortunately, these black meteorites fell relatively slowly-- which gave enough time for those below to dodge. However, upon impact with the ground, they'd release a tidal wave of energy.
<br><br>
If anyone was hit by the wave of energy, they would definitely be smashed into pieces.
<br><br>
Screams pierced the air as unfortunate creatures were unable to avoid the waves of energy.
<br><br>
As another meteorite crash landed, several members from the Separate Abyss race were caught in the wave of energy. Among them was Hamzah, a core member of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
Even though Hamzah had activated the Mighty Golden Body, he still didn't stand a chance against the black energy. Instantly, he was ripped to shreds; there was nothing left of him after being sucked into the black energy.
<br><br>
"This way!"
<br><br>
Yan led the disciples from the Pear Hill and the Oneness Sky Palace as they tried to evade the falling black meteorites.
<br><br>
Swish! Just then, three massive meteorites crashed in front of them, effectively blocking their way. Everyone felt hopeless.
<br><br>
"We're trapped!" Chaim frowned.
<br><br>
"Left!"
<br><br>
"We can't get out!"
<br><br>
Panic welled within them. This was a matter of life and death, and there was no time to stop and think! Suddenly, Yan's eyes flashed with determination. Raising her hands towards the sky, she spat out one word, "Slow!"
<br><br>
She had tried to employ the Truth of Holy Words. However, in this situation, it was like a mantis trying to stop a chariot.
<br><br>
The massive black meteorites continued to fall from the sky, unbothered by Yan's feeble attempt to slow them down. Meanwhile, the tides of energy from behind the group were like black, ominous waves. With each second that passed, the black energy was growing stronger and stronger, overwhelming the crowd in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Yan's lips bled from her biting them, and her eyes shed bloody tears. Cyan scales appeared on her raised arms.
<br><br>
"The bloodline transformation?"
<br><br>
Natalie cried, stunned.
<br><br>
All the human women who had stayed in the Pear Hill had the bloodline of the Snake Goddess race, but they didn't have the physique of the race.
<br><br>
Similarly, although Elvinia had the bloodline of the Sun Crow race, she couldn't materialize two wings like the demon women of the Divine Liar.
<br><br>
Yan's slender legs were surrounded by a glimmer of light and completely disappeared, turning into a cyan green snake tail. She had completely transformed into a Snake Goddess girl! Then, a hairline crack appeared on Yan's forehead, and a tiny shaft emerged from the crack.
<br><br>
The shaft looked ordinary, but it seemed to contain a strange force.
<br><br>
Fuxi stood outside the world, expressionless as he watched Yan transform.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Mount's jaw dropped in shock. Even when the Evil God and Zen had summoned their worlds, he had remained calm. However, at the sight of the small shaft that emerged from Yan's forehead, he was stunned, eyes filled with disbelief.
<br><br>
"Is that... the Energy Shaft?" Mount asked with uncertainty.
<br><br>
Fuxi cast a cold glance at him. "It's just a prototype. It's the only one that has been cultivated successfully, but... Should I just kill you?"
<br><br>
Fuxi didn't even try to hide his antagonism towards Mount and the Chaos Ancient God behind him. Naturally, he refused to disclose any useful information to him.
<br><br>
"It's useless to kill me, because I'm not the only one who sees it." Mount smiled. "Unless you kill all those leaders outside..."
<br><br>
Fuxi didn't reply. Instead, he fixed his gaze on Yan.
<br><br>
She was a talented and powerful girl, considered the best of her generation from the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
But no matter how talented she was, she wasn't worth so much attention from Fuxi.
<br><br>
The only reason he was mildly interested in her was the Energy Shaft within her body.
<br><br>
Previously, some had guessed that the entire chaos was not what it seemed.
<br><br>
Time, space, and energy-- these were all concepts perceived by people.
<br><br>
The more perceptive a person was, the better they gripped these.
<br><br>
Space could be folded, space channels could be constructed, and people could move instantaneously via Grand Teleportation in the space.
<br><br>
Time could be compressed, and even be traced back.
<br><br>
As for energy, it could be transformed.
<br><br>
There were always creatures who would painstakingly devote their entire lives to studying these things.
<br><br>
Once, someone had even discovered a unique civilization on the Other Shore. It was known as the Calculation Civilization.
<br><br>
This civilization could hardly be ranked in the top 1, 000 among all civilizations. It was only considered as a secondary ruling force. In that round of chaos where the Calculation Civilization emerged, there was also another powerful ruling force.
<br><br>
The Calculation Civilization was actually considered extremely weak in terms of strength. Hence, not long after they had entered the Other Shore, they had grown extinct.
<br><br>
However, it was this very civilization that had managed to almost complete the Finale Way! The methods they had used were quite different from other civilizations'.
<br><br>
They didn't focus all their energy on the Other Shore, and concluded that they wouldn't be able to complete the Finale Way by merely relying on the Other Shore's strength.
<br><br>
In order to complete the Finale Way, one had to understand the nature of the whole chaos. Consequently, one needed to grasp the three essential natures of the chaos: space, time, and energy.
<br><br>
This civilization had inferred that time and space were transformation forms of the energy in the flowing process, hence, the essence was energy. As long as the energy flow was affected on a higher level, it could rebuild or even destroy everything.
<br><br>
And the key to achieve this was exactly the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
Chapter 3466 Construction And Soaring Snake The Calculation Civilization had left some documents alluding to the Energy Shaft. According to them, they had obtained a way to control the Energy Shaft.
<br><br>
However, just as they were closing in on completing the Finale Way, another ruling force in the chaos attacked them. At last, they failed, ending with regrets.
<br><br>
But their failure didn't go unnoticed. The supreme masters from all super forces in the Source World caught wind of this civilization.
<br><br>
Most of them didn't take it seriously, thinking the Calculation Civilization was merely talking nonsense. They believed that there was no such thing as a magical Energy Shaft! Even so, some super forces took an interest in it, and even designated some manpower and resources to study about it further.
<br><br>
However, even with countless efforts made, the research was fruitless.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Chaos Ancient God behind Mount had been quite interested in the Energy Shaft. As he wielded the truth of space, he had a natural advantage in understanding space. In fact, at some point, he had even figured out what its prototype would be like.
<br><br>
It was almost the same as the one that hovered in front of Yan's forehead, which was why Mount could recognize it instantly. Yet, he was still uncertain. After all, no one had ever confirmed its existence before! Suddenly, Yan activated the Energy Shaft. It flashed a bright light, unleashing shreds of peculiar traction force.
<br><br>
As the Energy Shaft released an intense gravitational pull, the energy of the black meteorites was easily sucked into it.
<br><br>
While the Energy Shaft might have been weak in form, it could still release a powerful, special energy. With Yan controlling it, it could suck any energy in her surroundings.
<br><br>
"Slow!"
<br><br>
Yan spat out the word once more.
<br><br>
The forces that the Energy Shaft had absorbed blasted out the instant she spoke.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
The surrounding space seemed to stir, as though time and space were distorting.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, the energy tides that were charging towards disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill became thick and viscous, slowing down.
<br><br>
Witnessing this, the crowd's eyes lit up with hope.
<br><br>
"Let's go!"
<br><br>
As the three meteorites fell slowly, the disciples from the Pear Hill and the Oneness Sky Palace weaved their way through.
<br><br>
However, even though they were putting some distance between them and the falling meteorites, they were still in danger. As the whole world was on fire, it was only a matter of time before the energy being released would become more and more chaotic and violent.
<br><br>
Yan was a novice to the control of the Energy Shaft. In addition, the Energy Shaft itself was not that strong enough to help them escape.
<br><br>
Bang! Bang! Bang! Meanwhile, Zen was bombarding the surface of the black crystal shield over and over again, but the shield didn't budge. It was much solider than his expectation.
<br><br>
With every strike, his inner world shook upon impact.
<br><br>
The Sanskrit words bearing the Eye of Will trembled as the burning of the eye had triggered the counterattack power of the truth rules. After the Civilization Artifact had unfurled, all the counterattack power had been controlled. However, even so, a tiny bit of energy that was occasionally released from the counterattacks would cause a lot of harm to Zen's inner world! "Zen, the Eye of Will can only be burned for nine more seconds," the Regal Jade Spirit reminded.
<br><br>
Even if Zen managed to smash open the black crystal shield in time, he still wouldn't be able to find the white spot.
<br><br>
As his mind whirled, he suddenly raised his hand and summoned a long sword from his space ring.
<br><br>
Crack! "Soaring Snake Sword!"
<br><br>
This was Zen's secret weapon. He would never have revealed it unless he absolutely needed to.
<br><br>
But at this point, Zen had no choice.
<br><br>
"Imperial Sword Seal! The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent!"
<br><br>
The moment the Imperial Sword Seal was activated, the Truth of Godly Way had madly swarmed into it, simultaneously activating the power of the Soaring Snake Sword.
<br><br>
Although Zen hadn't cultivated the Truth Enlightenment for a long time, the Soaring Snake Sword burst into a bright white light which enveloped him as the white cyclones swarmed into the seal.
<br><br>
"That sword...!"
<br><br>
A leader outside the Chaotic Source World exclaimed as he watched the scene unfold before him.
<br><br>
From the very beginning, Zen had focused his attacks at a certain area of the world for seemingly no reason. The leaders probably had figured out that this place was the flaw of that world.
<br><br>
However, no matter how many times Zen struck it, it remained virtually undamaged. The leaders who watched from outside had almost lost hope.
<br><br>
But at that point, Zen revealed his secret weapon, quite a shock to them.
<br><br>
"It's the Soaring Snake World!"
<br><br>
"That sword is in his hand..."
<br><br>
"Who on earth is this guy?!" "After the extermination of the Nine Li race, we have been hunting for this sword, but we couldn't find it... Could this guy be a member of the Nine Li race?"
<br><br>
When the Evil God absorbed the bloodline theurgies, he had revealed three heads and six arms. From this, they could tell that someone from the Nine Li race was present.
<br><br>
Now, Zen's weapon indicated that, he was likely to come from the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
Athemar stared in silence at the Imperial Sword Seal on Zen's chest.
<br><br>
It was true that the Imperial Sword Seal could maximize the power of a sword to the extreme. Moreover, Zen had deciphered a part of the Truth Enlightenment. The force released by his sword might be only greater! As Zen filled the Soaring Snake Sword with the power of the Truth of Godly Way, he felt a wave of self-consciousness coming from it.
<br><br>
It was very hungry...
<br><br>
It needed to merge with more Truths of Godly Ways! However, Zen had infused all the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent into it already. Unlike the Other Shore Power, the Truth of Godly Way couldn't be replenished with divine crystals.
<br><br>
'How about the Truth of Goodwill and Malice? Or the Truth of Cultivation Nature?' Zen quickly activated these two Truths of Godly Ways.
<br><br>
However, Athemar's Imperial Sword Seal was complementary to the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but rejected the other two Truths of Godly Ways.
<br><br>
Zen tried to inject them into it, but failed.
<br><br>
'Should I infuse the Truth of Three-Energy Construction in it?' Zen's heart skipped a beat.
<br><br>
With little time to think, he could only try all his options. As this thought flashed through his mind, he infused the Truth of Three-Energy Construction into the Imperial Sword Seal. To his relief, the seal accepted it! "Chop!"
<br><br>
From a distance, Zen wielded his sword and slashed at the black crystal shield below.
<br><br>
Countless snake shadows emerged, dashing down to the shield. These snakes weren't entities of energy, but actual flesh and blood.
<br><br>
"Are these snakes... real?!" Zen's jaw dropped in shock.
<br><br>
Because of the sensitive position of the Nine Li race, he didn't know much about the Soaring Snake Sword, even in the Source World.
<br><br>
Zen had never expected that the snake within the Soaring Snake Sword would come to life, with a real, physical body, after he infused it with the Truth of Three-Energy Construction! The countless snakes flew onto the surface of the black crystal shield and actually melted into the shield! After thousands of snakes melted into the black crystal shield, nothing happened for a while. The surface of the shield remained unscathed, and its interior pattern was flickering.
<br><br>
"It didn't work? Even the Soaring Snake Sword can't smash open this black crystal shield?"
<br><br>
The burning light in Zen's right eye gradually extinguished, and he felt greatly disheartened. If this blow could not break the black crystal shield, he would have a slim chance to kill the Evil God and stop this catastrophe.
<br><br>
Crack! Zen heard a slight sound coming from the black crystal shield. He whipped his head towards the sound.
<br><br>
A crack appeared on the surface of the black crystal shield, and from it flowed black energy. He had finally penetrated the shield! Chapter 3467 The Ending Of The World "Has this black crystal shield been restored?"
<br><br>
Shock was written all over Zen's face, but it was soon replaced with ecstasy.
<br><br>
The Truth of Three-Energy Construction was different from the other thirteen Truths of Godly Ways. Not only could it create things, but also restore things to their original forms. Now, it was totally a coincidence for Zen to have poured the Truth of Three-Energy Construction into the Imperial Sword Seal. He never expected for it to work to this extent.
<br><br>
There were a few continuous sputters as more and more cracks appeared on the surface of the black crystal shield.
<br><br>
Eventually, it was completely restored to black energy.
<br><br>
Then, a white spot appeared in front of him.
<br><br>
Without any hesitation, he slashed at the white spot with his sword.
<br><br>
Zen felt the whole world tremble as the sword touched the white spot. The ground near him shook for a while before a big crack appeared, from which the Evil God's real body was ejected out. He feebly lay on the ground as he could not move.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen observed the Evil God, then walked towards him with the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand. "Everything is really over now," he stated.
<br><br>
The Evil God looked aghast upon hearing Zen's words. The truth was punishing him in his inner world since he began to burn the world. There was no reason for him to feel good.
<br><br>
Even then, he still had the audacity to smile. "You think that killing me is enough to stop the destruction of the world, but in fact nobody can stop it now. I can't, and you can't either. Hahaha..." he said lazily.
<br><br>
"What?!" Zen's face twisted in fury at what the Evil God said. He quickly decided to consult the Regal Jade Spirit in his mind and asked, "Is it true that the world cannot stop from burning?"
<br><br>
"I don't know," said the Regal Jade Spirit. "To be honest, a Civilization Artifact is different from all the other kinds of Other Shore Tokens. If I don't allow you to burn it, you can't burn the Civilization Artifact. As for me, I can stop the Regal Jade World from burning."
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact in the Evil God's body also represented a civilization, and there must be a leader of such a civilization, like the Regal Jade Spirit. The Regal Jade Spirit, however, just couldn't understand how the Evil God had successfully persuaded that leader to burn their Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"So it seems like there is no solution..." Zen's face darkened for a moment.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit fell silent as well. It was indeed a difficult problem to solve.
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God saw Zen's grim face, he slightly perked up. "Take me back. I still have a lot of secrets, many valuable secrets. Unfortunately, you won't be able to use them, because you will die here with me," he sneered.
<br><br>
Just then, the strangely-colored world suddenly trembled once more.
<br><br>
The huge black snakes that had been forming black meteorites suddenly disappeared, together with the meteorites and the energy tide that was surging everywhere on the ground.
<br><br>
In turn, the Evil God couldn't help but be dumbfounded when he felt the changes around him. "No, no, you can't stop! Never stop! I'm your master! You can't betray me!" the Evil God roared with all his strength.
<br><br>
Yet, no matter how loudly he howled, he couldn't do anything to prevent the energy from disappearing.
<br><br>
After a little while, even the strangely-colored world that the Evil God had summoned had vanished as well.
<br><br>
The members from various races, who were desperately running for their lives just now, also stopped in their tracks due to utter surprise. The world had been on the brink of destruction a while ago, but now it was suddenly calm and serene. Only the gentle but sharp cyan light that emitted from the Regal Jade World had remained.
<br><br>
"Has the whole world been burnt out?"
<br><br>
"It seems not... If the whole world was burned, then we wouldn't have survived!"
<br><br>
"Surely, the burning must've stopped!"
<br><br>
As for Zen, he did not know what happened, but according to the Evil God's reaction, he could guess why.
<br><br>
Just like him, the Evil God also had a Civilization Artifact. The difference was that the Evil God seemed to have had complete control over his Civilization Artifact. So, maybe there was no civilization leader like the Regal Jade Spirit, or such a leader was still asleep.
<br><br>
When the Evil God began to burn the whole world, the leader had finally awoken and took action to stop the fiery catastrophe.
<br><br>
The specific details might be more or less different from Zen's theory, but the overall process should be the same as he guessed.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Evil God still cried out in desperation, and he clearly looked like he was unwilling to admit defeat.
<br><br>
For him, the current situation was worse than death.
<br><br>
As the Evil God lamented miserably, Zen went towards him and lifted him up, then tried to absorb him into his own inner world.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, Zen still had to ask one's consent in advance if he were to absorb them in his inner world. The Evil God, however, was originally a creature that came out from his inner world. Thus, he didn't need to consider the Evil God's feelings or permission when he wanted to absorb him back.
<br><br>
In the blink of an eye, Zen's inner world had completely absorbed the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
The Evil God fell from the high sky in Zen's inner world. Before he could reach the ground, numerous golden ropes appeared strangely out of nowhere and bound him tightly.
<br><br>
In Zen's inner world, there was no room for the Evil God to revolt.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he was unable to do such a thing when he was in such a bad state.
<br><br>
The Evil God simply stared blankly into the horizon. His expression didn't change even when he saw the unfolded Civilization Artifact. He knew clearly that his day had gone, and all his plans and ambitions had vanished into thin air.
<br><br>
After Zen had finally defeated the Evil God, his gaze swept over his surroundings. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that Yan, Dorothy, Elvinia, Sally and their other companions were all safe and sound.
<br><br>
Some of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the members of the Snake Goddess race from the Pear Hill had been injured or even killed, but such casualties were inevitable in a battle. This was already the best result.
<br><br>
The other super forces and races suffered even worse losses.
<br><br>
Still standing on the edge of the Regal Jade World, Fuxi finally breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>
Even Mount couldn't help but smile slightly. He was glad to see the Evil God die. At the same time, however, he realized that Zen would probably be his greatest opponent in the future.
<br><br>
More than half of the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits split open, and she motionlessly lay on the ground.
<br><br>
Densely packed Chaotic Source Spirits could be found at the side.
<br><br>
Once the crisis was over, everyone's eyes were focused on the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Some nonhuman creatures began to eye her with greedy looks again.
<br><br>
Still, no one dared to take action.
<br><br>
The Evil God's strangely-colored world had disappeared, but the Regal Jade World still existed. Lastly, Zen still had a crystallized body.
<br><br>
Even the immensely powerful Evil God was defeated because of Zen, so none of the people present dared to provoke him. Anyone who attempted to grab the Chaotic Source Spirits recklessly would be courting death.
<br><br>
"Phew!"
<br><br>
The wings behind Zen's back flapped gently, then he flew towards the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
"Brother ..." His sister Yan flew up as well to meet him. She caressed her brother's crystallized face and asked, "What happened to your eye..."
<br><br>
One of Zen's eyes was lost, and half of his face was broken. He did look terrible, indeed.
<br><br>
"My eye? Nothing!" Zen said with a small smile. There were bits of crystal that had congealed on his face. The Regal Jade Crystals immediately replaced the cracks on his skin, so his face was quickly restored to its original state. The crystals didn't belong to his body in the first place, so he was fine.
<br><br>
But since the Eye of Will had been burned, he had lost a very useful Other Shore Token. Without the Eye of Will, his Sword Texture Technique would be less powerful as well. Naturally, he needed something to replace it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3468 The One-eyed Bat Having comforted Yan, Zen looked down and was shocked at the sight that awaited him. Instead of two legs, his sister's lower half had been replaced by a snake tail.
<br><br>
"Yan, what happened to your legs?"
<br><br>
His sister blushed in embarrassment, not really keen with her brother seeing this half-human, half-snake form of hers.
<br><br>
She had taken back the Energy Shaft and there was no need for her to maintain this form.
<br><br>
With a twist of her cyan tail, a burst of light enveloped her and the next thing Zen knew, was that her fair, flawless legs reappeared. "This is the bloodline theurgy of the Pear Hill," Yan explained.
<br><br>
"Bloodline theurgy?" Zen repeated with curiosity. "It helps you transform?"
<br><br>
He couldn't help but think of Elvinia. She possessed the bloodline theurgy of the Sun Crow race but she didn't have the power to transform herself into a real Sun Crow. How did Yan do it then? It seemed things were more complicated than she let on.
<br><br>
Her explanation was vague at most as if she didn't want him to ask too many questions.
<br><br>
Despite his constant prodding, Yan remained mum about the topic. Left with no answer, Zen chose to give up and let his sister keep her secret. With that, he unfurled his wings and flew away. "The crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits will be distributed to the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill first."
<br><br>
His voice was deep and incredibly loud, resounding all throughout the entire Regal Jade World.
<br><br>
Nobody objected, which Zen took as everyone's silent agreement to his terms.
<br><br>
Each person had a limit of accommodating only two hundred crystals.
<br><br>
Moreover, each race suffered heavy losses in their numbers, so even if the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill got first dibs, there would still be enough left over.
<br><br>
Zen glided towards the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, while Chaim and Natalie led the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill respectively. With everyone present, the distribution of the crystals began.
<br><br>
The moment Zen took the crystals out, he found a thick aura emanating from inside the body.
<br><br>
Puzzled, he waved his hand, splitting the body open to reveal a ton of golden red crystals! "Are these also the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits?" he murmured in shock.
<br><br>
The sight of these golden red crystals was met with calm indifference by the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill, however, the same couldn't be said for the other races.
<br><br>
Fanaticism and excitement glimmered in their eyes. They had long since suspected that the mother's body harbored some special things. She had been hiding in the main peak for so long; thus, there was no way she only had ordinary crystals.
<br><br>
This suspicion ate through their insides since the only way to confirm it would be to kill the mother and open her insides. Now that it was taken care of, they could only relish in the fact that they had been right! Unfortunately, Zen still had the final say in the distribution of the crystals.
<br><br>
Only around several hundred golden red crystals were in the body. He quickly dashed everyone's hopes by slicing the air and putting those special, golden red crystals into his own space ring.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
He sliced the air a second time, making a bigger cut on the body.
<br><br>
Once again, a strange force emanated from the newly made cut.
<br><br>
"Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop..."
<br><br>
Over ten circles of light suddenly shot out of the depths and suspended themselves in the air.
<br><br>
Everyone's attention was immediately onto these circles of light.
<br><br>
Fuxi and Mount were both transfixed by these orbs as if they recognized them or something.
<br><br>
"What are these circles of light?"
<br><br>
Zen asked, flying up and touching one.
<br><br>
At that exact moment, a figure suddenly began its approach from the edge of the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
It was huge, standing hundreds of thousands of feet tall. It forcefully expanded the space crack to accommodate its size, the earth shaking as it forced its way in.
<br><br>
"Splash!"
<br><br>
When it finally got its body through the space crack, the creature flashed and began to rush towards the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
It didn't care about the restrictions of the Chaotic Source World and ran towards it head-on.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the colossal figure appeared above everyone's head. As a shocking presence, it emitted an unparalleled malicious aura.
<br><br>
Members of various great forces stiffened in fear when they saw it, their souls trembling violently at the sight of a colossus that came out of nowhere.
<br><br>
This creature unfurled a pair of dark wings wherein blood-colored lightning flowed. Its head was huge, inlaid with a solitary eye that was also surrounded by electricity. It was a colossal, single-eyed bat bathed by the energy of thunder and lightning! What kind of monster was this thing?! The crowd was rendered speechless from terror, unable to think, let alone cry for help.
<br><br>
Even Mount, ever so calm and steady, was reduced to a pale, sputtering man in the face of such a terrifying monster.
<br><br>
The leaders at the gate of the Chaotic Source World could only look on with horror.
<br><br>
"Damn it! I completely forgot about this monster!"
<br><br>
Fuxi cursed under his breath as he looked at this colossus.
<br><br>
He had stood on top of the snowy mountain all this time because of two things: one, he needed to prevent the Black Ship from making trouble, and two, he needed to watch over this monster.
<br><br>
However, he was way too preoccupied with saving Yan when he entered the Chaotic Source World that it completely slipped his mind.
<br><br>
"Splash!"
<br><br>
The one-eyed bat monster swung at Zen with unbelievably fast reflexes.
<br><br>
Given its size, one would think it would be slow and sluggish but that wasn't the case at all.
<br><br>
Unable to dodge, Zen took on the full force of the bat's paw and his entire crystal body shattered.
<br><br>
It grabbed at the circles of light and flapped its wings, thunder and lightning flashing as it prepared to fly away.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Before it could leave, a black and white pattern of Eight Diagrams appeared above the bat. Fuxi had thrown his punch and was not going to let this monster go.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Huge fragments exploded from the space and the bat took the blow hard. Its colossal body rolled over dozens of circles before landing directly outside the ring-shaped mountain range.
<br><br>
The sudden attack flustered the monster and caught it off guard; nonetheless, the bat was fine.
<br><br>
"Hand the things over!"
<br><br>
Fuxi roared, his voice cutting through the air like thunder.
<br><br>
Mount, who had been standing nearby Fuxi, covered his ears in pain. It wasn't just him. Those who heard Fuxi's shout let out a painful cry as blood shot out of their ears, deafened by his roar.
<br><br>
Fuxi jumped, his body expanding and also becoming incomparably huge! Although his Truth of Powerful Holy Body remained confined, Fuxi was still one of the giants who emerged at the beginning of the chaos. He naturally cultivated the Wild God Power.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Another pattern of Eight Diagrams appeared over the bat. This time, when Fuxi slapped its body, the bat let out a shrill cry of pain. Its wings flapped helplessly as it summoned the power of thunder and lightning to confront its opponent's palm attack.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
As these two huge and indescribable forces collided, the space around them began to break down, revealing the black void.
<br><br>
Chapter 3469 Thunder Dimorphodon The force blasted Fuxi tens of thousands of miles away. He crashed into the western peak in the core area, and it crumbled at the impact. Fuxi tumbled down into the rubble. Meanwhile, the one-eyed bat landed at the periphery of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
To those of the younger generations, such a battle was simply unimaginable. Even the slightest shock wave of it could kill them.
<br><br>
However, except for Mount who was capable of traveling through spatial transference, the others had no choice but to stand still. There was no point in trying to hide themselves.
<br><br>
The one-eyed bat rose up again, surrounded by a halo of bright white lightning. The flash of light swept across the landscape, revealing a huge space channel.
<br><br>
It hadn't come here to fight with Fuxi.
<br><br>
Since it had gotten what it wanted, it clearly planned to leave.
<br><br>
In an instant, the huge bat entered the spatial channel.
<br><br>
It disappeared into the depths of the channel, moving at an incredible speed.
<br><br>
But at that moment, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared high in the sky above the channel again.
<br><br>
Fuxi, who stood on the ground, lifted his fist and made a punching motion against the sky.
<br><br>
There was a deafening boom.
<br><br>
The mark of Eight Diagrams suddenly exploded in the sky.
<br><br>
To everyone's shock, the body of the giant one-eyed bat faltered, then fell out of the space channel.
<br><br>
"It won't be that easy for you to run away," shouted Fuxi at the bat, his face full of anger.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirits could be fused by all the races to strengthen themselves in the Source World. And yet, there was a huge mystery attached to the Chaotic Source Spirits that still hadn't been solved, even now.
<br><br>
What was the exact nature of the Chaotic Source Spirits kept in both the Chaotic Source Sea and the Chaotic Source World? Were they the creatures of the Other Shore, or in reality? If the Chaotic Source Spirits could appear in the chaos by virtue of their own unique characteristics, then would it be possible for other powerful creatures on the Other Shore to return to the chaos by some means? These questions had piqued speculation among various races when the special characteristics of the Chaotic Source Spirits were discovered, but they had remained unsolved.
<br><br>
But this time was different.
<br><br>
A Dreaded Eye Demon suddenly appeared in the main peak of the Chaotic Source World, catching the attention of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The appearance of the Dreaded Eye Demon was completely unexpected. It was known that the Chaotic Source Spirits were able to live in chaos after they had been born. But this Dreaded Eye Demon had neither been born nor descended—it had just directly appeared in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
It surely shocked the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Originally, the Pear Hill had planned to launch explorations of the Chaotic Source World after it was closed. However, the events occurring in the Chaotic Source Sea on the Other Shore had made the situation a lot more complicated.
<br><br>
Before Yan entered the Chaotic Source World, the Pear Hill had given her the silk cloth fused with the Braveness Rain to restrain that giant eye.
<br><br>
After subduing the giant eye with the help of Zen, Yan had taken the initiative to collect it. She planned to turn it over to the Pear Hill for further study.
<br><br>
The giant eye was strange indeed. But Fuxi was keenly aware that it was not the key to the problem. He supposed that the giant eye could appear in the Chaotic Source World because of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
So, when Zen had been digging for crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, Fuxi didn't interfere.
<br><br>
When Zen dug out the rings of light, Fuxi wondered if they were the key to making the giant eye appear. He hadn't expected that the one-eyed bat would show up suddenly and take the rings away.
<br><br>
He absolutely couldn't let that happen.
<br><br>
So Fuxi threw the one-eyed bat out of the space channel. Immediately after, he moved to the side of the one-eyed bat using Grand Teleportation.
<br><br>
Without giving the bat a chance to recover, he hit it as hard as he could. The bat screeched and retaliated. They launched a series of ferocious attacks against each other. In the heat of the battle, they directly rushed out of the Chaotic Source World and rose high into the sky of the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
The others in the core area watched as Fuxi and the one-eyed bat disappeared into the distance. As the two combatants moved further away, everyone heaved deep sighs of relief.
<br><br>
"Unless my eyes deceived me, it was the Thunder Dimorphodon! One of the top ten ferocious beasts of the ancient times!" squeaked an Ear Mouse.
<br><br>
It looked extremely excited.
<br><br>
"Was it really the Thunder Dimorphodon? I've only ever seen it in illustrations..."
<br><br>
"Of course it was! How could an ordinary beast withstand the palm of the Human Sovereign? Only a beast such as the Thunder Dimorphodon could bear it!"
<br><br>
At that statement, traces of fear reappeared on the faces of the members of the various races. If it had truly been the Thunder Dimorphodon, then they had just encountered one of the top ten ferocious beasts in history, not long after they had just barely escaped the previous devastating disaster. What a unique experience this trip had been! "Where is Zen?" Elvinia asked, looking quickly around.
<br><br>
Previously, Zen and the Evil God had both demonstrated their ability to use the Inheritance of World. After the pure energy entity had been exterminated, it seemed that the wielder wouldn't die.
<br><br>
At least the Evil God was still alive, though his body had shrunk into the size of a baby under the attacks of Zen. However, Elvinia was still slightly worried. Yan, Dorothy, Sally and the others were also looking around for any sign of Zen.
<br><br>
At that point, there was a flash from the Regal Jade World. Out of nowhere, a crack appeared and widened in the ground.
<br><br>
A bang sounded.
<br><br>
To their shock, Zen bounced out of the crack. His body curved through the air and he landed on his feet.
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes were wide at his sudden reappearance. There were also many exhalations of relief, for they were glad that Zen was safe and sound.
<br><br>
Zen didn't pay any attention to anyone else for the moment. Instead, he looked up. Beyond the sky of the Chaotic Source World, the faint figures of Fuxi and the one-eyed bat were still visible as they battled with each other.
<br><br>
The sound of their fight reverberated across the distance like the rumblings of far-off thunder.
<br><br>
Zen could only stand and watch the ferocity of the confrontation. He knew that the most important thing now for him was to distribute the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Zen had collected all those golden red crystals, but he was a little upset that he couldn't get any of the rings.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, just outside the Icy Snow Province, the lone Black Ship floated in the air.
<br><br>
Shera sat on the deck, wearing a long, flowing black dress. A small bottle had been placed in front of her. The bottle was shrouded in a cloud of black mist, with a blurry figure visible inside.
<br><br>
She stared fixedly at the figure in the bottle. Her eyes were red and hooded in her snow white face. Frowning, she murmured to herself, "How could he fail? The captain had foretold that he would encounter a disaster, but he shouldn't have died."
<br><br>
A cold voice spoke up behind Shera. "The Evil God is indeed alive."
<br><br>
The person who had spoken was exuding a brass light. He had a strange appearance, like he had been dipped and coated with molten brass. Even his voice had a metallic aura.
<br><br>
"He lost and was collected by his former master. How is that any different from death?" Shera snapped furiously.
<br><br>
If not for her fear of Fuxi, she would have entered the Icy Snow Province herself, to force Zen to hand the Evil God over.
<br><br>
That brass man shook his head. "The captain said that Zen and the Evil God might be the same person..."
<br><br>
Shera rolled her eyes. "Yes, of course, the creatures born in the inner world surely belong to the owner of that world. But after they leave the inner world, they will separate. Is there any need to remind me of this?"
<br><br>
The inner world was formed by consciousness. Thus, the owner of the inner world was the ruler controlling everything within it.
<br><br>
"No, you misunderstood it," said the man, shaking his head. "Do you still remember Usman?"
<br><br>
As soon as the name Usman was mentioned, Shera's face went blank, but her eyes darkened. It had all happened a very long time ago. Why was the brass man bringing him up now? Chapter 3470 The Incarnation Of The Evil Will The Black Ship advanced, without making any stops.
<br><br>
It didn't matter how many ships there were. Only thirteen people were qualified to join the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Usman used to be a member of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
His strength was ranked thirteenth when he joined the Black Ship.
<br><br>
But he rose through the ranks in just a short period of time. Before long, he was ranked so high that the only person above him was the captain. He had become second best.
<br><br>
The Black Ship had, at the time, seen its best days, until Usman betrayed them and killed six other members.
<br><br>
The captain had chased Usman for a long time, even making a concession to let some super forces work together to kill him.
<br><br>
But that was all history. And since it was related to the Black Ship, news about it hadn't spread out.
<br><br>
Shera had always felt regretful. If not for Usman's madness that had infuriated the captain and led to his doom, he probably could have taken over the position of captain, and even become the strongest man in the Source World.
<br><br>
Once Usman had been executed, Shera and the others realized that his birth wasn't a coincidence.
<br><br>
He was the embodiment of the resentment and hatred of the entire Source World. And because of this aura that he exuded, he was suitable to join the Black Ship. In addition to his astonishing talent and luck, he was also destructive. Chances were high that he would do something harmful to the Black Ship.
<br><br>
"You mean the Evil God is also the embodiment of the resentment in a world?" Shera asked, surprised.
<br><br>
In retrospect, there were many similarities between the Evil God and Usman. Their expressions, aura, style, and even madness were the same.
<br><br>
But the Evil God was at a level lower than Usman.
<br><br>
On second thought, Shera added, "But he's from the inner world of a man called Zen, not the Source World!"
<br><br>
This alone was enough to deny the captain's conjecture.
<br><br>
The brass man smiled and said, "What if Zen's inner world is a primitive land?"
<br><br>
Shera trembled, her red eyes wide. "Is that even possible?"
<br><br>
The brass man didn't want to waste time arguing with her. He just said, "It's a pity that the Evil God has been collected by his creator. But to be honest, it's difficult for us to control a guy like him. If he becomes powerful one day, there's a chance that he will turn against us and hurt us as Usman did."
<br><br>
The people of the Black Ship were crazy, but not as crazy as the Evil God.
<br><br>
He had found the Civilization Artifact that he merged with by himself, but he had burned it without hesitation. He was even more ruthless than Usman had been.
<br><br>
Shera was torn.
<br><br>
Back then, she had been infatuated with Usman. And since the Evil God was eerily similar to Usman, she felt drawn to supporting him.
<br><br>
She had been disappointed when Zen had taken the Evil God back. She hesitated before saying, "Shall we investigate Zen?"
<br><br>
The Black Ship didn't hate Zen. But now that the Evil God was taken back, it seemed to be a good choice to target him.
<br><br>
"He is a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, and it's not wise to offend Eastern Emperor Taiyi. End of story. Maybe the captain has his own plan.
<br><br>
By the way, the rings that were taken away by the Thunder Dimorphodon are connected to the Other Shore. Should we take action now?" the brass man asked, pulling Shera out of her reverie.
<br><br>
"We'd better not do anything now. We can intercept the Thunder Dimorphodon once it escapes smoothly," she said, shaking herself out of her thoughts.
<br><br>
"What if Fuxi doesn't let it go?" the brass man asked.
<br><br>
"Then give up," Shera said resolutely, her red eyes flashing.
<br><br>
Offending the Thunder Dimorphodon was better than offending the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Zen and the Evil God, along with Fuxi and the Thunder Dimorphodon, had destroyed the core area, leaving only one third of the magic arrays intact.
<br><br>
Once the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, members of the Pear Hill, and the Nine Li people had gotten enough crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, they had entered the arrays with satisfaction and began to merge with the crystals.
<br><br>
"Brother, let me do it first!" said Sally with a smile.
<br><br>
A magic array could accommodate a lot of people, but only one person was allowed to merge with the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits at a time.
<br><br>
The Nine Li people like Sally and Hutton were satisfied.
<br><br>
Even though their journey to the Chaotic Source World had been extremely dangerous and they had almost died several times, they had still obtained what they had dreamed of in a very simple manner. This was the best that the remaining members of the Nine Li race could have hoped for.
<br><br>
Hutton was thinking much more than Sally was.
<br><br>
Everything that Zen had previously shown them was beyond their imagination. Hutton, on seeing the battle between Zen and the Evil God, could no longer tell just how strong Zen actually was.
<br><br>
What would his grandpa think if he knew this? Sally, on the other hand, wasn't thinking about that. She sat down crosslegged and put all the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits into her inner world.
<br><br>
There were many ways to absorb the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
After swallowing them, one could force them into their limbs and internal organs. Or they could absorb them into the inner world, and then let them slip down the meridians.
<br><br>
The bloodiest way was to press the crystals into the body, one by one.
<br><br>
Pressing two hundred crystals into one's body would obviously create a bloody mess.
<br><br>
Even though Sally had chosen the easiest way, the crystals that were the size of a little finger would still cause huge damage when they moved through her meridians while causing her immense pain. Her face scrunched in pain as she endured the process.
<br><br>
It was not until all the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits were equally spaced that Sally activated the magic array.
<br><br>
She was almost immediately surrounded by light.
<br><br>
The arrays in the Chaotic Source World could catalyze the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits and completely merge them with the body.
<br><br>
The fusion was permanent. The catalyzed crystals had become a part of the body, different from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits and the queen ant that Zen had met.
<br><br>
Therefore, even if a cultivator at the Chaotic Source Realm was killed, no one could take the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits out from their body.
<br><br>
Sally's frown began to relax under the effect of the magical array. The crystals that had been planted in her body softened gradually and turned into soybean-sized light spots in her limbs and bones, becoming a part of her body.
<br><br>
Sally had previously been able to only draw her Other Shore Power to the Iridescent Stone. The power of the Iridescent Stone could reach over a thousand divine megatons when it fully erupted, but she had been unable to draw such a large amount of power to her body.
<br><br>
Similarly, even if Zen were to fully activate the power of the Strength God Totem before entering the Chaotic Source World, his physical body would not be able to bear it.
<br><br>
But after fusing with the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, they could control the Other Shore Power more easily.
<br><br>
Many cultivation methods that needed to borrow the Other Shore Power could also be freely displayed, instead of just relying on the Other Shore Tokens of descending type.
<br><br>
Chapter 3471 I Am The Reason After Sally successfully completed the fusion with the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, the array shook drastically and space began to fluctuate.
<br><br>
The array had sensed that Sally had reached the Chaotic Source Realm and then it opened the space channel.
<br><br>
Carefully, Sally got up and took a step into the space channel. Suddenly, from the array, a ray of light shot into the sky and she was teleported out of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Afterwards, it was her brother's turn to do so.
<br><br>
In another array, Zen sat cross legged with his eyes closed. He had entered a meditative state.
<br><br>
He didn't immediately merge with the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits even if he had the chance to. He knew that the battle between him and the Evil God was far from over.
<br><br>
Phew! Gradually, an avatar formed in his inner world.
<br><br>
After the avatar was formed, the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 also transformed into humans, appearing on his two sides.
<br><br>
"Let's go."
<br><br>
Just as Zen finished speaking, they leaped up and disappeared into the sky.
<br><br>
Somewhere in his inner world, inside a mountain, sweet chimes echoed from the stream of clear water that went through a large cave.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Evil God lay in the center of the cave with golden ropes restraining him from any form of movement.
<br><br>
He kept his eyes and mouth shut, seemingly indifferent to the situation.
<br><br>
When he heard Zen and the other two enter the cave, the Evil God opened his eyes, the corners of his mouth curved upward into a small smile. It was an arrogant move, as if he was mocking Zen, but it was actually more like a self-mocking smile.
<br><br>
Zen took a good look at the Evil God and lifted his arm to point a finger at him.
<br><br>
Crack! Just like that, the golden ropes on the Evil God broke, freeing him.
<br><br>
As soon as the Evil God was released, he turned to Zen with a look of vengeance in his eyes. His body, which was once stiff, rushed towards Zen in a hurry. He flipped his hand and a black dragon-patterned broken blade appeared in his hand! Phew! Zen was shocked to see the black dragon-patterned broken blade in his hand, especially because it was a rare treasure. He ran and aimed directly towards Zen's chest.
<br><br>
Zen's avatar was stabbed, and his body twitched upon the impact.
<br><br>
Afterwards, his whole body became charred to a crisp, falling to the ground without any resistance.
<br><br>
However, the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 watching the avatar remained calm and collected. Their expressions did not change, despite seeing the avatar was destroyed.
<br><br>
After all, it was merely an avatar. There was no way Evil God could kill Zen in his own inner world.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
Not far away, a spark of brown aura condensed, and Zen's body took shape once again.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen's avatar reform, the Evil God did not hesitate to rush and kill Zen again.
<br><br>
This went on for a few times, with Zen's avatar reconstructing and the Evil God attempting to kill it for good.
<br><br>
After over a dozen times of this cycle, the Evil God was eventually out of breath. He stared at Zen with his dark eyes, thirsty for his death.
<br><br>
"Devour me now!" the Evil God said in arrogance. "I'm from this world, and I'm supposed to be a part of this world after all."
<br><br>
In his life, he'd never known the meaning of surrendering. That was never going to be the case.
<br><br>
Zen stared at him without any pity. "You belong to this world. And even though it makes sense for me to devour you and I did have such plan to do so before, I have changed my mind."
<br><br>
Hearing Zen's words, the Evil God was surprised with Zen's change of decision. "What do you mean?"
<br><br>
Zen waved his hand lightly. Without any space fluctuation, a beautiful, dignified woman appeared in the center of the cave.
<br><br>
She wore a long, light white dress, looking as pure as a dove.
<br><br>
She looked around, confused about why she was in a cave. Just then, her eyes met with the Evil God in the cave, and she was overjoyed. "Darling! You're back? You're really back!"
<br><br>
She threw her arms around the Evil God, bouncing in celebration.
<br><br>
"Edna..." The Evil God's eyes widened as he wrapped his arms around her petite frame.
<br><br>
Before the Evil God left Zen's inner world, he knew that he'd break ties with Zen.
<br><br>
In Zen's inner world, the only person he was concerned about was Edna.
<br><br>
Before parting with her in the past, he never got to say goodbye. In that moment, he thought that he would never see her again.
<br><br>
However, circumstances changed with the passage of time and he never expected that he would come back here again. Apparently Edna had been waiting for him to come back all the time.
<br><br>
Just as Edna was enjoying this moment of celebration, she suddenly felt a chill in her chest. She parted with him and saw the source of pain - it was the black dragon-patterned broken blade piercing into her chest.
<br><br>
Her expression changed instantly and she looked at her husband with disbelief. "Darling, why... Why would you kill me?"
<br><br>
The Evil God took Edna's face in his hands, and caressed her across her temples with a tenderness in his eyes.
<br><br>
"I will go with you soon, my love." He then turned to Zen after he finished speaking. "If you want to kill me, please do it quickly," he signed. "You're just wasting time."
<br><br>
The Evil God had thought that death would square all the accounts and there was nothing to fear. But seeing Edna after so long had confused him, almost convincing him to live longer than he had planned.
<br><br>
For this reason, the Evil God hated himself for being so easily swayed, so he nipped his feeling at the bud and ended the life of Edna himself. He acted rashly, and his voice became cold and indifferent.
<br><br>
"Darling, why would the Creator ever kill you? Did you do anything wrong?" Edna asked, whilst still enduring the pain going through her chest.
<br><br>
Even if she was at the edge of her life, she still worried for him the most.
<br><br>
She had no clue what the outside world was like, and what had happened there.
<br><br>
All she knew was that her husband returned after exploring the outside world, and she wanted to hear all of his stories from his adventures.
<br><br>
The last thing she expected was to get stabbed in the chest.
<br><br>
As the Evil God heard her words so painfully exit her lips, his heart quivered slightly.
<br><br>
'Those who are on the losing end, are always in the wrong, ' he thought If he had won, Zen's inner world would be in his possession. He'd be able to stand freely at the peak, with Edna in his arms, looking down at all the living beings. But that was not the case now. He was only a loser, who could only curl up in the cold cave and die with the woman he had loved.
<br><br>
"I didn't do anything wrong," the Evil God said slowly. "I just lost.
<br><br>
I lost to the Creator..."
<br><br>
Edna looked at him and instantly knew what had happened.
<br><br>
She knew very well about her husband's ambition and goals. He did mention a few times that if there was someone he wanted to defeat the most, it would be the Creator.
<br><br>
When she heard the Evil God mention it for the first time, she covered his mouth and warned him never to mention it again.
<br><br>
The Creator was omnipotent and he knew everything that occurred in his inner world. How could the Evil God possibly defeat him? But despite knowing all of this, the Evil God was stubborn to achieve his ambition. Edna could only obey him and help him carry out the plans to kill the Creator. In the end, he had failed and lost to the Creator.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the Creator was so magnanimous that he forgave the Evil God without any hesitation.
<br><br>
Edna tried hard to put the pieces together. Did that mean her husband attacked the Creator again after he left the inner world? If that was true, then by no means would the Creator forgive him this time, she thought.
<br><br>
If it were any other woman, she probably would have begged Zen to spare her husband's life. Edna didn't do any of that. All she could think was her love for him. If her husband was punished to death, she would die with him, too.
<br><br>
"I've said that I've changed my mind, remember?" Zen repeated. "I won't kill you. After all, your leaving was also good for my inner world. I am the reason for all of this, after all."

He wanted to know what Zen was up to.
<br><br>
"To a certain extent, you are me," Zen continued. "Or rather, you are all the evil thoughts and resentment I have projected onto this world."
<br><br>
Zen was well aware that the world had its own will.
<br><br>
Before the Evil God's appearance, Zen's inner world was a mess. Conflicts between various races erupted so often, and even the humans were constantly competing against each other. So long as Zen wasn't interfering, many ambitious creatures caused much disturbance.
<br><br>
All the disputes ended, however, with the appearance of the Evil God.
<br><br>
For a time, Zen was grateful to him. His inner world had somehow returned to order after the Evil God came to be. No war was breaking out among the empires, and neither resentment nor loathing brewed between the races.
<br><br>
At the time, Zen thought it was the Evil God's contribution until the Regal Jade Spirit told him otherwise.
<br><br>
In the end, he got the truth.
<br><br>
The Evil God was a fusion of all evil thoughts and resentment—his appearance was a tribulation of the world, not a coincidence.
<br><br>
Such a tribulation was rarely seen—it could only appear in the primitive land. Coincidentally, Zen's inner world was a small primitive land. After all the resentment and evil thoughts were gathered to form the Evil God, the living beings within the inner world existed in harmony.
<br><br>
With her jaw slack, Edna looked at the Creator in disbelief. Never did she expect her husband to have such a background.
<br><br>
But the Evil God didn't seem to care. "So what?"
<br><br>
"If I kill you, the inner world will fall back into turmoil. It won't do me any good. But if I let you go, you'll definitely get me into trouble," Zen said, smiling and touching Edna gently. The black dragon-pattern blade was then pulled out from Edna's body. As soon as the blood on her white dress returned to the wound, it began healing rapidly.
<br><br>
In truth, Zen probably couldn't kill the Evil God.
<br><br>
So long as there were creatures in the inner world, disputes, resentment, hatred, and conflicts would continue to exist.
<br><br>
The Evil God was born along with his inner world. Even if Zen destroyed him, when the next world tribulation arrived, negativity would gather once again, and the Evil God would be reborn.
<br><br>
Perhaps, he wouldn't have the memories of his current life. He might even take on a completely different form, but he would still be the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Are you telling me you can spare my husband's life?" With a glimmer of hope, Edna's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
Zen nodded before he said, "Remove the barrier of your Rebirth Land and merge it into my world. I can let him off."
<br><br>
The Evil God threw Zen a silent glance before laughing. "Even if I don't remove the barrier of Rebirth Land, you still have a way, don't you?"
<br><br>
"It's not difficult to find a way from you," Zen replied.
<br><br>
The Evil God merely sighed. "Let's go..."
<br><br>
The Evil God's Rebirth Land had always existed within Zen's inner world, but Zen had never entered it.
<br><br>
Later on, the people of the Black Ship had separated the Rebirth Land from Zen's inner world. Zen couldn't interfere even if he wanted to.
<br><br>
As a sudden image flashed in Zen's mind, he, the Regal Jade Spirit, No.
<br><br>
9527, the Evil God, and Edna had appeared in the sky. Nearby there was a space surrounded by cloud and mist, which was the Evil God's Rebirth Land.
<br><br>
When everyone came to the edge of the mist, the Evil God gently flipped his space ring, pulling out a black token.
<br><br>
"Crack!"
<br><br>
Stretching out his hand, he squeezed the token until it was crushed into pieces.
<br><br>
After the token broke, the cloud and mist began to dissipate.
<br><br>
Zen could feel something change—his inner world was once again connected to the Rebirth Land.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
With a wave of his hand, Zen, the Evil God, and the others disappeared with him once again before appearing in the Rebirth Land in the next moment.
<br><br>
Over the past few years, the Evil God had managed the Rebirth Land well in Zen's absence.
<br><br>
While the space in the Rebirth Land was smaller than Zen's inner world, the Evil God had made full use of it. The land was vast with nearly no sea at all.
<br><br>
Many dark mountains were scattered everywhere and at the foot of each was a small country.
<br><br>
When Zen looked down, a strange look came over his face.
<br><br>
Many of the countries below were engaged in fierce wars—corpses decorated the ground. Even from a hundred thousand feet up in the air, one could smell the strong scent of blood.
<br><br>
"How can the creatures in your Rebirth Land kill so fiercely?" Zen asked, frowning.
<br><br>
The Evil God merely snorted and said, "Only by constantly fighting can the strong be born."
<br><br>
All Zen could do was to shake his head helplessly. After a while, his gaze then fell on a high mountain in the corner of the world. Rays of white arc light flashed constantly in the area. The white arc light was the internal momentum of the Godly Way previously used by the Evil God.
<br><br>
When the Regal Jade Spirit noticed the arc light, his eyes flashed. Then, everyone flew toward the mountain.
<br><br>
"Crack..."
<br><br>
Atop the mountain stood a great tree that had been burnt black. A white gem was embedded on the ground at its foot, being the source of the rays of arc light.
<br><br>
"Zen, this is the second flaw!" the Regal Jade Spirit pointed out excitedly.
<br><br>
Since Zen had merged with the Blood Essence Godly Way, there were only two flaws left in the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
But the Regal Jade Civilization had spent too much time finding the last two flaws to no avail. Fortunately, the Regal Jade Spirit, at least, managed to find a clue about one of the flaws through the Sanskrit word of the Blood Essence Godly Way.
<br><br>
He had always believed that Zen was destined to encounter the Regal Jade Civilization, but even he was surprised to find out that the creature Zen released from his inner world had found the second flaw.
<br><br>
Perhaps Zen truly was the one who could complete the Ways-blending Energy.
<br><br>
Even if he couldn't do it right away, he still had the greatest chance.
<br><br>
"How did you even find this gem?" Zen asked curiously.
<br><br>
After completely unlocking the Rebirth Land, Zen could spy on the Evil God's memory, but he chose not to do that.
<br><br>
"On Stage Two of the Other Shore," answered the latter.
<br><br>
"Stage Two..." That was rather surprising.
<br><br>
Generally, the members and disciples of the super forces didn't stay long on the first three stages.
<br><br>
When Zen and Dorothy had just set foot on the Other Shore, Dorothy was willing to explore the Sacred Mallow Temple with Zen because he held the secret key. In fact, she had even intended to take him directly to Stage Four at the time.
<br><br>
If they reached Stage Four, they'd be able to gain the support of their own race, after all. It was much more rewarding than exploring the Other Shore on their own.
<br><br>
Normally the first three stages were desolate. Only someone who didn't belong to any sect, like the Evil God, ever wandered aimlessly in these parts.
<br><br>
Chapter 3473 Heavenly Obsession Civilization "I found a buried temple at the edge of Stage Two of the Other Shore—the Heavenly Obsession Temple. Perhaps it was because it had been buried that nobody had found it. It was already broken, so people could enter and exit at will. This gem with internal momentum of Godly Way was right in the center of the temple," the Evil God said honestly.
<br><br>
"Heavenly Obsession Temple?" Zen paused for a thought.
<br><br>
"I've never heard of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," said the Regal Jade Spirit, shaking his head.
<br><br>
A single round of chaos already took an extremely long time, and the Other Shore had experienced over a thousand chaotic eras.
<br><br>
During these eras, apart from the ruling forces, various super forces, ordinary forces, and even many major races thrived. Too many secrets were hidden among these forces—it wasn't surprising that the Regal Jade Spirit hadn't heard of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
"After I obtained this gem, I found another clue," the Evil God continued.
<br><br>
"It led to a secret land at Stage Ten of the Other Shore. There, I found an underground cave that stretched for thousands of miles across Stage Ten."
<br><br>
The Evil God was already extremely powerful when he was headed for Stage Ten. At the time, his infamous nickname, the "Soul Devouring Demon", was already very well-known on the Other Shore. By then, he could enter Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore easily.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, at the time, Zen had already reached the Grand Sky Temple to explore the temple.
<br><br>
As the Evil God explored the underground cave, he found the second Heavenly Obsession Temple—it was there where he had obtained the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"What a strange civilization…" Growing more and more confused, the Regal Jade Spirit sighed upon hearing the Evil God's story. "A strong civilization can enter a higher stage of the Other Shore. If the Heavenly Obsession Civilization is hiding in the Lust World, they must be doing it to avoid getting hunted down by enemies, as we are."
<br><br>
The spirit paused for a moment before continuing. "Even if they wanted to hide in the Lust World, they were supposed to go to the Dark Region. It would have been safer there, right? Why did they go to Stage Ten of the Other Shore?"
<br><br>
Each time a creature on the Other Shore went down by a stage, their strength would be suppressed more.
<br><br>
Under the pressure of Stage Ten of the Other Shore, the Civilization Artifact was still giving out strong power—it went to show just how powerful the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was.
<br><br>
"I don't know," the Evil God answered.
<br><br>
"Has the Heavenly Obsession Civilization ever communicated with you?"
<br><br>
Zen asked him.
<br><br>
"Communicate?" After a moment of thought, the Evil God smiled helplessly. "Follow me. You can find the answer when you see the Civilization Artifact with your own eyes."
<br><br>
And so they followed the Evil God to the center of the world. Once he closed his eyes, a faint shadow emerged in the very center of the world. It was a silvery cube, spinning slowly in the air.
<br><br>
"This is the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization,"
<br><br>
said the Evil God.
<br><br>
Zen's gaze fell on the cube—its left side was as smooth as a mirror, but its right had bumps and hollows, like it had been severely damaged.
<br><br>
Even without the Evil God's explanation, Zen knew how it was destroyed.
<br><br>
While the Civilization Artifact wasn't completely burnt, it had been harmed enough when the world was almost destroyed.
<br><br>
When the Evil God drew close, a cold, emotionless voice came from the cube.
<br><br>
"You've failed the task of annihilating the Separate Abyss race. The reward is withdrawn."
<br><br>
"You've failed the task of annihilating the Ear Mice. The reward is withdrawn."
<br><br>
"You've failed the task of obtaining the Chaotic Source Spirits. The reward is withdrawn."
<br><br>
"Ding! You killed 4, 633 people in the Chaotic Source World, which reached a tenth of the total number. You will receive a third-class reward—a body reinforcing source."
<br><br>
Clearly, the voice was narrating the Evil God's tasks.
<br><br>
But it was a completely emotionless voice. Even when it laid out the Evil God's failures, it didn't seem to be criticizing him at all, like it was merely a programmed voice.
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
Zen, the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 looked at each other in shock.
<br><br>
The Evil God said, "Since I bore the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, only this emotionless voice has communicated with me. It continuously gave me tasks based on the current circumstances. If I fulfilled a task, I was rewarded."
<br><br>
"Why does such a strange civilization exist?" No. 9527 smiled helplessly.
<br><br>
Staring at the cube, Zen said, "The chaos has existed for such a long time.
<br><br>
It's normal that all sorts of strange civilizations have come into being."
<br><br>
After a moment of thought, the Regal Jade Spirit chimed in, "I guess all the strong masters of this civilization fell asleep, but they had programmed the Civilization Artifact before that. After the Civilization Artifact chose a spokesperson, everything went as programmed."
<br><br>
All the creatures of the Regal Jade Civilization, save for the Regal Jade Spirit, had fallen asleep as well. The spirit wasn't even awakened until Zen and Elvinia barged into the black pool. If the Regal Jade Spirit was willing to fall asleep, the Regal Jade Civilization could have taken a similar path, providing tasks one after another, gradually increasing Zen's strength.
<br><br>
From this perspective, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization's method was rather reasonable.
<br><br>
"But still…why is it so savage? All the tasks it gave involve somehow annihilating another race," Zen wondered out loud.
<br><br>
"I believe it arranges tasks according to the personality of the recipient,"
<br><br>
said the Evil God. "It gave ordinary tasks in the beginning, but perhaps because it realized that I enjoy killing, it gave me tasks about killing."
<br><br>
Such was the embodiment of the saying, "He that lies with the dogs must rise with the fleas". The Civilization Artifact carried its own logic so as to guide its spokesperson in the most suitable way.
<br><br>
"What an interesting civilization," the Regal Jade Spirit remarked with a smile. "Now that the Rebirth Land has been unblocked, Zen, you can guide it into your own inner world and bear it yourself. But I wonder what Truth of Godly Way is to be used to bear this Civilization Artifact."
<br><br>
Since the Evil God had been retrieved, so had the Rebirth Land.
<br><br>
Earlier, the Evil God had begun burning the Civilization Artifact, but the Civilization Artifact simply stopped burning without punishing him. The Regal Jade Spirit came to the conclusion that the Civilization Artifact wouldn't reject Zen.
<br><br>
Zen turned to the Evil God questioningly.
<br><br>
"The Truth of Goodwill and Malice," answered the latter.
<br><br>
At that answer, No. 9527, the Regal Jade Spirit, and Zen showed a smile.
<br><br>
Excluding the Truth of Godly Way that was vague on Zen's physical body, Zen had already cultivated four Truths of Godly Ways in total. Among them, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was used to bear the Strength God Totem; the Truth of Cultivation Nature was used to bear the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization; and the Truth of Goodwill and Malice was used to bear the Eye of Will.
<br><br>
Lastly, the Truth of Three-Energy Construction had been obtained from the space where King Manard was. According to him, it was used to bear the Other Shore Token in that world. It wasn't known if it could bear any Other Shore Token on the first Other Shore.
<br><br>
Chapter 3474 Fantasy After Zen had burned the Eye of Will, the Truth of Godly Way that carried it was now vacant, which was the Truth of Goodwill and Malice. It was just what Zen had wanted, and he felt fortunate that fate was even helping him.
<br><br>
In addition, he also wanted to take away the Civilization Artifact of the Evil God. The Evil God didn't seem to be upset about it, and at this point he just let Zen do whatever he wanted.
<br><br>
In any case, Zen didn't intend to ask for the Evil God's consent anyway. He simply moved the Civilization Artifact on his own.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The cube vibrated for a short while when it was moved, then it flew straight out of the Rebirth Land. Aside from this object, he also took away the gem with the arc light from the top of the mountain.
<br><br>
There should be a lot of good things in the Evil God's hands. For instance, the black dragon-patterned broken blade was a treasure with an extraordinary origin.
<br><br>
These things, however, were useless to Zen, so he didn't bother to plunder the treasures from the Evil God.
<br><br>
Once he had gotten the two most important items, the last thing that remained was how to deal with the Evil God.
<br><br>
A shiver ran down Edna's spine when she saw that Zen's gaze fell on her husband. Although Zen had said that he would not kill him, who could stop him if he suddenly changed his mind? "Phew!"
<br><br>
At that moment, Zen pointed towards a mountain below.
<br><br>
The mountain rose from the ground like a fast growing tree and grew up to three hundred thousand feet high. It didn't stop until the top of the mountain touched Zen's feet.
<br><br>
With a wave of his hand, the top of the mountain became flattened. Golden red pillars were formed out of thin air. They lined up in formation until they turned into a spacious prison.
<br><br>
To refine the Evil God into an Inner-world Generating Avatar was a good choice, but in fact, the Evil God's talent was his own and was innate to him.
<br><br>
So, it would be a waste if he was refined into an avatar without any consciousness.
<br><br>
In light of this, Zen would try to find a way to make the Evil God become an Inner-world Generating Avatar and at the same time, he would be able to keep his own consciousness.
<br><br>
The Evil God, who was under his control, would be a great help to him. Zen wouldn't take the risk to release him as he might kill anyone recklessly.
<br><br>
The Evil God knew what he had to do. He went inside the prison, followed by Edna.
<br><br>
Since her husband had made a mistake, she was willing to bear the consequence with him.
<br><br>
The door of the prison closed shut with a loud thud, then Zen and the other two flew away.
<br><br>
The Evil God stood behind the bars. His eyes looked down at the world in the distance.
<br><br>
As the human kingdoms were still in battle with each other, he saw the horses gallop, long spears that penetrated the bodies of the warriors, and blood that flowed like a river… Yesterday he was still the master of the world, and today he became its prisoner. When Edna noticed that the Evil God was quiet, she moved closer to him.
<br><br>
"Darling..."
<br><br>
The Evil God held her in his arms while his eyes were still fixed on the war in the distance, still immersed in his past glory and unwilling to look away.
<br><br>
"It's a beautiful sight when animals kill each another, isn't it?" said he.
<br><br>
"Yes, it's very beautiful," Edna agreed with a nod. She knew that her husband would not admit defeat.
<br><br>
Even death could not make him admit defeat, let alone while he was still alive.
<br><br>
That was one of the reasons Edna was obsessed with this man.
<br><br>
However… It was unwise to oppose their Creator.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Zen had moved the Civilization Artifact all the way from the Rebirth Land to the center of his inner world.
<br><br>
Although Zen took back the Rebirth Land, the Civilization Artifact was actually merged with the Evil God. Thus, he was unable to control it and needed to merge with it himself.
<br><br>
If this piece of Civilization Artifact had its own consciousness and didn't acknowledge Zen, it should cut the connection between them and return to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Only those who had used a Civilization Artifact knew how powerful they were.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Civilization was still suppressed in Stage Thirteen. If the entire civilization rose from the Lust World to the Desire World, its power would increase again. Furthermore, the world he could summon would endow him more incredible power.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization just got to Stage Ten but the power it released was impressive. The potential it would have in the future would help Zen immensely.
<br><br>
Without much words, Zen began to recite the Truth of Goodwill and Malice in his heart.
<br><br>
Buzz...
<br><br>
When the truth aura began to spread, his inner world trembled slightly and the Sanskrit words along its boundaries lit up in succession.
<br><br>
"Three hundred and seventy two Sanskrit words lit up..."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit looked rather unconvinced as he observed the shining Sanskrit words.
<br><br>
Back when Zen had previously merged with the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization, three hundred and sixty six Sanskrit words lit up.
<br><br>
The unknown Heavenly Obsession Civilization actually used three hundred and seventy two Sanskrit words to merge with it, which meant that the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was indeed superior to that of the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
The golden light on the surface of the Sanskrit words continuously flashed and turned into thick chains once again. All the chains struck at the Civilization Artifact like huge snakes, and firmly locked it inside.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The Civilization Artifact had no intent of resisting. In fact, the entire process of merging with it was rather easy.
<br><br>
As the chains gradually disappeared, Zen felt that he had established some sort of connection with the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
At that point, a cold and emotionless voice was heard from the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"The tasks-guiding process has been started..."
<br><br>
"The tasks are ready. Do you want to receive tasks?"
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit, No. 9527, and Zen looked at each other, before Zen answered, "Yes."
<br><br>
After he agreed, the cold voice continued, "Heaven-level first-class task, kill Fuxi. After completing the mission, you can have the Innate Seal, which could be used to merge with Fuxi's Dark and Light..."
<br><br>
"Heaven-level first-class task, defeat the Thunder Dimorphodon. After you have completed it, you will have the Eternal Chain, which could help you completely subdue the Thunder Dimorphodon."
<br><br>
"Heaven-level second-class task, hijack the Black Ship. After you have completed the task, you will have..."
<br><br>
"Heaven-level..."
<br><br>
The three of them were dumbfounded when they heard it announce a series of tasks.
<br><br>
If Zen took these tasks, it would be exactly like courting death.
<br><br>
Yet, after the tasks were issued, he could choose not to accept them.
<br><br>
Therefore, he just listened quietly.
<br><br>
From the way these tasks were issued, the Civilization Artifact should have been spying on the surrounding environment at all times. Then, it issued tasks according to the things that existed in the environment and offered the corresponding rewards.
<br><br>
"I can also issue these tasks," the Regal Jade Spirit said in disbelief. "But where did it get those rewards? Can this thing really give the rewards it has promised?"
<br><br>
Forget about whether Zen was able to kill Fuxi or not. It was absolutely impossible for him to defeat the Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
Fuxi was the Human Sovereign. His control of the Dark and Light energies was far beyond an ordinary person's imagination. It could be said that even among the strongest warriors, Fuxi was the most powerful in terms of the cultivation on the Dark and Light energies! If Zen was able to defeat Fuxi, this Civilization Artifact would give him the so-called "Innate Seal", which could be used to merge with Fuxi's Dark and Light energies...
<br><br>
It sounded truly unbelievable.
<br><br>
And, it was the same with the Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
Each of the top ten beasts of the chaos had their own missions and abilities.
<br><br>
These beasts were not as powerful as the Chaos Ancient Gods, but they weren't weaker than the strongest warriors either. As it happened, they were even stronger than some of those strongest warriors.
<br><br>
It was hard to imagine that after such a powerful being was defeated, one just had to rely on an Eternal Chain to subdue it? What a crazy fantasy! Chapter 3475 Refinement "Is it possible," No. 9527 mused jokingly, "that the Civilization Artifact starts talking nonsense after being burnt by the Evil God?"
<br><br>
"Just verify it," Zen responded bluntly. "It can issue a lot of tasks in one go."
<br><br>
The heaven-level third-class task...
<br><br>
The heaven-level fourth-class task...
<br><br>
The earth-level first-class task...
<br><br>
The earth-level second-class task...
<br><br>
Gradually, Zen began to understand the rules.
<br><br>
Once the cube issued tasks, it would start from the heaven-level ones, which were categorized into four classes. Next came the earth-level ones, which were also categorized into four classes. Among all, the human-level tasks were the simplest.
<br><br>
Zen focused on the tasks being listed. At the end, he picked one task he felt suited for: a task at the fourth class of the human level.
<br><br>
"The human-level fourth-class task," the voice boomed, "merge with the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. After you complete the task, your physical body will be strengthened."
<br><br>
Zen nodded in a satisfied manner. Other tasks might have various restrictions or were not suitable for him to complete, but he was confident he'd be able to accomplish this task.
<br><br>
"It's not easy to reach the Chaotic Source Realm," he pondered. "Why is it a task at the fourth class of the human level?"
<br><br>
The tasks were divided into twelve kinds. He didn't expect that reaching the Chaotic Source Realm would be the easiest.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit thought for a moment before replying. "The tasks should be ranked according to the current environment. You have already collected enough crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, so reaching the Chaotic Source Realm is too easy."
<br><br>
"It's reasonable," Zen said, nodding. "I'll accept this task."
<br><br>
Strengthening his physical body was always a plus. Moreover, he wanted to confirm whether this Civilization Artifact was really magical or not.
<br><br>
Splash! Zen's body transformed into wisps of brown chaotic energy.
<br><br>
The moment he removed the avatar in his body, he was fully awakened.
<br><br>
In a magic array not far from him, a ray of light suddenly flashed. A nonhuman stranger who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm was sent outside the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
While Zen was busy with the matters within his inner world, there were already many people who had refined the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Zen activated his space ring, pulling out the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits with one hand. With his other hand, he summoned the golden red crystals.
<br><br>
Earlier, Zen had also been quite surprised when he discovered the two different kinds of crystals in the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Moreover, the auras of the golden red crystals were obviously thicker and more solid than those of normal crystals.
<br><br>
Zen hadn't kept all the crystals to himself. Yan received thirty of them, while Dorothy and Elvinia got twelve. As for Chaim, Sally and the others, they each got three.
<br><br>
But Zen had also warned them not to refine the golden red crystals in the magic arrays, lest they contain poison or lead to any other dangerous situation.
<br><br>
Although the magic arrays in the Chaotic Source World were complicated, the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill were able to arrange the same arrays. They could try refining the golden red crystals after the elders of their races inspected them.
<br><br>
Zen's corporeal body differed from an ordinary person's, so he was able to take on more.
<br><br>
After hesitating for a bit, Zen finally decided to refine the ordinary crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits first.
<br><br>
Following in Sally's footsteps, he first put the crystals into his inner world, and then pushed them into his meridians.
<br><br>
As the sharp crystals wandered in his body, he winced in pain.
<br><br>
Zen's corporeal body was comparable to a magic weapon, and there was much greater resistance to the crystals than in any ordinary body.
<br><br>
The crystals slowly moved, and gradually scattered in every part of his body. Then, when he activated the magic array, his whole being was enveloped in a wave of light.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
In the span of a few seconds, the once solid crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits began to melt, little by little. Beads of light melted off the crystals, merging with Zen's corporeal body.
<br><br>
Zen closed his eyes. He could tangibly feel the dots of light being absorbed, completely under his control.
<br><br>
After Zen had effortlessly refined the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, the voice from before suddenly spoke up in his head once more.
<br><br>
"You have completed the task at the fourth class of the human level," the Civilization Artifact of Heavenly Obsession Civilization said. "You will be rewarded with a stronger body."
<br><br>
Zen felt something stirring within him. Looking into his inner world, he saw a small, black dot of light rising from one side of the cube.
<br><br>
No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit had been standing beside the cube. Once the black dot popped up, they stared at it curiously.
<br><br>
"Is this the reward of the Civilization Artifact?" the Regal Jade Spirit wondered, narrowing his eyes.
<br><br>
"It seems to be some kind of energy. Can it strengthen the corporeal body?"
<br><br>
No. 9527 asked, puzzled as well.
<br><br>
"I will try it," Zen said.
<br><br>
Without further hesitation, he willed the small black dot of light to rise up and out of his inner world.
<br><br>
Then it turned into a warm current, quietly integrating into Zen's corporeal body. It flowed through his meridians for a lap, till the energy inside it had been used up.
<br><br>
"How are you feeling now?" The Regal Jade Spirit asked cautiously.
<br><br>
"Well, it's better than nothing!" Zen shook his head and chuckled.
<br><br>
He could feel that his corporeal body was strengthened, but only by a little.
<br><br>
After all, it was but a simple task.
<br><br>
After Zen reached the Chaotic Source Realm, he felt a sudden fluctuation of the space in front of him, and the space channel was already shown.
<br><br>
Zen didn't plan to leave immediately. This time, he placed the golden red crystals into his inner world.
<br><br>
After the distribution of the golden red crystals, Zen had reserved two hundred for himself.
<br><br>
Just as he'd done before, he willed the golden red crystals to scatter in his limbs and bones. Then, he activated them.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The light of the magic array enveloped Zen once more. However, something was wrong.
<br><br>
"What the...?"
<br><br>
Zen frowned slightly. These golden red crystals didn't melt easily, like the ordinary crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits had. They remained unharmed within his corporeal body, unresponsive to the energy from the magic array.
<br><br>
The others around him exchanged confused glances as they noticed Zen had once again activated the magic array. Some, however, figured out what he was up to.
<br><br>
"Why did he activate the magic array again?"
<br><br>
"Have you forgotten what he gained from the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits?"
<br><br>
"He has obtained some unique crystals. He's probably trying to refine them, too."
<br><br>
Then, those people nodded, as they began to envy Zen.
<br><br>
To reach the Chaotic Source Realm was a great success. Moreover, Zen had obtained extra crystals. How could they not be envious, if not in awe? After a while, the light from the magic array went out.
<br><br>
Chapter 3476 The Black Ship's Interception "Refinement failed..."
<br><br>
Zen pursed his lips, unable to hide his disappointment. He shook his head and willed all the crystals to gather into his inner world once again.
<br><br>
It seemed this magic array only worked for ordinary crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, not the golden red ones.
<br><br>
Zen had to look for another way to refine them.
<br><br>
He got to his feet. Without saying a word, he stepped into the space channel, immediately transformed into a stream of light and headed straight out of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
In the sky above the Icy Snow Province, thick, ominous clouds spat out thunderbolts angrily. The lightning twisted in the atmosphere like menacing dragons. Each bolt of lightning was extremely powerful, enough to destroy the heavens and the earth. Gathering all the thunderbolts would garner enough power to destroy the entire Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
There were a few human tribes in the Icy Snow Province. Seeing the menacing bolts of lightning in the sky above them, they trembled in fear.
<br><br>
Some even knelt in the snow, praying that God would not punish them.
<br><br>
After all the thunderbolts had gathered together, they suddenly shot out towards Fuxi at lightning speed.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Fuxi calmly stretched out his hand.
<br><br>
Black and white auras swirled in front of him, shrouding him in a bright light. Once the light died down, he remained standing, unscathed. The Eight Diagrams disk had protected him! Boom! Boom! Boom! The thunderbolts kept striking the Eight Diagrams disk hundreds of times.
<br><br>
Each time it was struck, the disk would rotate, effectively diffusing the thunderbolt.
<br><br>
"It's no use, Thunder Dimorphodon. You're no match for me," said Fuxi gravely.
<br><br>
His voice was like the waves of the sea, which could spread far away even amidst the rumbling thunder.
<br><br>
In the entirety of the chaos, any strong warrior would tremble before Fuxi.
<br><br>
He could even fight Chaos Ancient Gods.
<br><br>
"I am indeed not your match, but there is nothing you can do about me,"
<br><br>
said the Thunder Dimorphodon in a low voice. This was the first sentence it had uttered since coming to the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
The top ten fierce beasts were by no means ordinary. Every beast had a certain kind of omnipotent innate theurgy, although slightly weaker than truth-level theurgies.
<br><br>
"If I ran away, you wouldn't be able to catch up with me," the Thunder Dimorphodon taunted.
<br><br>
"Oh, really?" Fuxi sneered. Circles of white fog spread out from beneath his feet, until he had formed a giant cloud. From Fuxi's cloud, the power of wind and thunder could faintly be felt. "I wonder what makes you so confident."
<br><br>
At the sight of the cloud beneath Fuxi's feet, the Thunder Dimorphodon's expression quickly changed. "The Heavenly Auspicious Cloud! How did you find this Other Shore Token?"
<br><br>
The Heavenly Auspicious Cloud was known to greatly increase the speed of its user. It was extremely rare; even powerful warriors like Fuxi were unlikely to stumble upon it.
<br><br>
The Thunder Dimorphodon was known for its incredible speed. However, if Fuxi used the Heavenly Auspicious Cloud, there was a chance it wouldn't be able to escape.
<br><br>
"Leave those rings behind, and I'll let you go. We'll just act as though nothing happened." Fuxi's eyes narrowed ruthlessly.
<br><br>
The Thunder Dimorphodon could clearly tell that Fuxi would be a force to be reckoned with when mad.
<br><br>
Fuxi, also known as the Human Sovereign, had been supporting the Snake Goddess race of the Pear Hill, but in the Source World, there weren't any strong warriors that had the confidence to face him.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry. Someone asked me to do this. I can't promise you anything..."
<br><br>
Buzz! Suddenly, a small dragon made out of lightning appeared above the Thunder Dimorphodon's head. It was also an Other Shore Token! Crack! Crack! Crack! The moment the lightning dragon burst forth, the Thunder Dimorphodon's body began to vibrate violently.
<br><br>
Splash! The tiny flashes of lightning vibrated with the Thunder Dimorphodon in the air. Soon an identical Thunder Dimorphodon materialized. It was the Thunder Dimorphodon's avatar, made of lightning! Splash! More and more avatars appeared, one after another. In no time, six avatars had been born.
<br><br>
Fuxi looked coldly at the seven figures before him. "You chose to fight me face to face because of those idiots. You are more stupid than them. Go to hell!"
<br><br>
The seven identical Thunder Dimorphodons said at the same time, "Who said I was going to fight you? Haha!"
<br><br>
Seven huge space channels appeared beside the Thunder Dimorphodons.
<br><br>
Each avatar headed for their designated space channel.
<br><br>
"You!"
<br><br>
Fuxi's expression darkened. Before the figures had entered their space channels, he punched at them.
<br><br>
Two marks of Eight Diagrams appeared on the bodies of two Thunder Dimorphodons.
<br><br>
Boom! Boom! As the two marks of Eight Diagrams exploded, the two Thunder Dimorphodons exploded in a blast of light and then disappeared. The other five, on the other hand, managed to make it to their space channels.
<br><br>
Fuxi took a step forward, the Heavenly Auspicious Cloud fluttering beneath his feet. He rushed into a space channel, his eyes fixed on the true Thunder Dimorphodon all the time.
<br><br>
The moment he entered the space channel, his body transformed into a beam of light that sprinted towards the Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
Crack! The true Thunder Dimorphodon flew rapidly along the space channel.
<br><br>
Seeing Fuxi on its tail, it flapped its wings. Huge thunderbolts filled the entire space channel, heading straight for Fuxi.
<br><br>
Instead of dodging, Fuxi flew forward, undaunted.
<br><br>
Activating the Heavenly Auspicious Cloud to its highest speed, he steadily closed the distance between him and the beast.
<br><br>
When the Thunder Dimorphodon was only about a thousand feet away from Fuxi, he planted a mark of the Eight Diagrams on its body. Then, he threw a fist to it.
<br><br>
Boom! The mark of Eight Diagrams suddenly exploded.
<br><br>
The huge Thunder Dimorphodon was blasted into an electric light, disappearing into the space channel.
<br><br>
"Is this also an avatar?"
<br><br>
Fuxi's eyebrows twitched in annoyance.
<br><br>
The avatars of the Thunder Dimorphodon were very unique. When the avatars appeared, each of them could be the true Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
The Thunder Dimorphodon could choose any avatar to be its true body at any given time.
<br><br>
Even though Fuxi had fixed his spiritual sense on the first Thunder Dimorphodon, the latter could've easily shifted to one of its avatars.
<br><br>
Seeing that the Thunder Dimorphodon had gotten away, Fuxi became more sullen.
<br><br>
Reaching out his hand, he tore the void. After ripping a hole in the space channel, he flew out.
<br><br>
Phew! In another long space channel, the Thunder Dimorphodon flapped its wings agitatedly.
<br><br>
Most of the time, the Thunder Dimorphodon looked like an annoying bat.
<br><br>
But when lightning danced all over its body, it looked strangely beautiful.
<br><br>
It wasn't interested in the rings that were snatched from Zen. Someone had offered an irresistible price, so it decided to take a risk and went to the Icy Snow Province to give it a try.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Fuxi had underestimated it. If it was trapped by Fuxi, it might have died in the Icy Snow Province! Phew! Phew! With its wings flapping in the air, it quickly advanced forward in the space channel, leaving the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
As the Thunder Dimorphodon flew at high speed, it suddenly sensed something behind it. Turning its head to look, it was shocked to find a huge black ship ripping open the space channel, floating towards it like a ghost.
<br><br>
Chapter 3477 A Deep Sense Of Crisis "The Black Ship?"
<br><br>
The Thunder Dimorphodon was dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Back when it was lurking in the Icy Snow Province, it had spotted the ship.
<br><br>
However, before the Chaotic Source World opened, Fuxi had driven the ship out of the Icy Snow Province.
<br><br>
While the Thunder Dimorphodon had nothing to do with anyone from the Black Ship, it didn't expect the ship would come after it as soon as it lost Fuxi.
<br><br>
Crack! It flapped its huge wings and sped up.
<br><br>
Before long, however, it suddenly slowed down once more. To its surprise, another ship appeared from the other end of the space channel.
<br><br>
The two ghost-like ships floated over quietly, blocking the Thunder Dimorphodon's way from both sides.
<br><br>
Whoosh! Whoosh! On the ship behind the Thunder Dimorphodon, Shera gathered her dress and jumped off the rail of the ship, quickly flying towards the Thunder Dimorphodon. The brass man followed closely behind her.
<br><br>
On the ship ahead, a person covered in bandages, resembling a bamboo pole, also flew towards the Thunder Dimorphodon. Next to the "bamboo pole" was a large Ear Mouse. A deep, red scar covered its right eye, which gleamed with a sharp light. It was as though it had been slashed at with a blade in its past.
<br><br>
This Ear Mouse was called Tomos. It used to be a capable assistant of Ieuan, the king of Ear Mice. Later, it rebelled against the Ear Mice and joined the Black Ship. To this day, the Ear Mice were still chasing it.
<br><br>
Crack! A flash of lightning circled the Thunder Dimorphodon. Angrily, the Thunder Dimorphodon roared, "Members of the Black Ship, what do you want from me?"
<br><br>
Shera floated quietly in the air. Holding up a small, bony finger, she smiled charmingly. "Give us half of what you've got."
<br><br>
Squeak! "Only half! We are not greedy!" echoed Tomos.
<br><br>
Of course, the Thunder Dimorphodon was keenly aware of how important the rings were. In order for the creatures on the Other Shore to return to the chaos, the rings were integral. It was said that they might affect the entire situation of the chaos.
<br><br>
"Half? Truly, you are greedy," said the Thunder Dimorphodon coldly, narrowing its eyes.
<br><br>
"You don't have to hand them in," the brass man said with a shrug. "We will take everything anyway. And the rankings of the so-called top ten fierce beasts may change..."
<br><br>
The top ten fierce beasts were universally acknowledged.
<br><br>
However, if one of them died, another would take its place.
<br><br>
Obviously, the brass man was threatening the Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
"You? What makes you think you're strong enough to defeat me?" said the Thunder Dimorphodon in a low voice.
<br><br>
Shera still wore a sweet smile. "The Human Sovereign took you lightly and you managed to escape, but we won't repeat the same mistake. We're well prepared to block you here. You don't have any chance to run away!"
<br><br>
As soon as she finished speaking, Tomos had pulled out its Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
It was a pipe.
<br><br>
Thin wisps of white smoke rose from the pipe, which suddenly solidified to form a strong net that prevented the Thunder Dimorphodon from tearing open the space channel to escape.
<br><br>
The bandages on the body of the "bamboo pole" began to unravel, layer by layer. Without the bandages, his skin was bright and colorful. At a glance, anyone could tell it was poisonous.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the brass man didn't move a muscle. Instead, he watched from where he stood.
<br><br>
If in a fight of pure strength, he wouldn't fear even Fuxi.
<br><br>
"You have five minutes to consider it. We are very generous," Shera said with hands clasped behind her back.
<br><br>
The lightning on the body of the Thunder Dimorphodon was cracking gently, and the trace of hesitation flashed through its only eye.
<br><br>
The members of the Black Ship were definitely not weak. More importantly, every member's methods were strange and difficult to deal with. The Thunder Dimorphodon thought it could fight one head-on, but it was up against four. The chances of winning were slim.
<br><br>
Phew! The Thunder Dimorphodon flapped its wings hard. Six rings rushed toward Shera with terrifying forces, like hidden weapons.
<br><br>
Without flinching, Shera reached out and waved her delicate hand. The rings slowed down, and floated gently towards her.
<br><br>
She inspected them carefully in her hand. After a while, she nodded at Tomos.
<br><br>
Tomos understood immediately. It put away its Other Shore Token, deactivating the net.
<br><br>
The Thunder Dimorphodon shot Shera a vicious glance. "Tell your captain that the glory days of the Black Ship are coming to an end."
<br><br>
Then, without waiting for a response, it flapped its wings and flew away.
<br><br>
Shera titled her head slightly and cracked a lovely smile. "Good days or bad days don't mean anything to the Black Ship," she said sweetly.
<br><br>
The thirteen members of the Black Ship were all powerful creatures at the top of their game.
<br><br>
No matter where they were in the Source World, they were able to live luxuriously. They could start up a great force with ease, and it was very likely that they could develop themselves into a super force if they worked hard.
<br><br>
They chose to join the Black Ship not because they wanted to live a good life, but because they wanted to sail forward for their goals.
<br><br>
The leaders outside the Chaotic Source World had been anxious since the conflict between Fuxi and the Thunder Dimorphodon had started.
<br><br>
If strong masters, such as Athemar and Elizabeth, were involved in a fight like that, they would have been seriously injured, if not killed. If anyone younger got involved, they would have been killed for sure.
<br><br>
To their relief, Fuxi was chasing the Thunder Dimorphodon away.
<br><br>
In the beginning, everyone could hear the roar of thunder. However, now, the sounds had faded; the two had probably gone into a space channel.
<br><br>
Whoever had reached the Chaotic Source Realm was sent out one by one.
<br><br>
After the members of the smaller races came out, they quickly located their leaders and headed out in their flying ships.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the super forces had sent many members to the Chaotic Source World, so they were still waiting for their members to return.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Separate Abyss race looked sullen.
<br><br>
This time, they had been really unlucky. They had been attacked by the Evil God at the very beginning. And, at last, even Hamzah was killed in the world created by the Evil God.
<br><br>
How could the leaders explain what had happened to their clansmen after they went back? Buzz! There was a fluctuation of space in the magic array at the door. Then, Zen emerged.
<br><br>
His appearance immediately attracted everyone's attention.
<br><br>
His battle with the Evil God in the core area went beyond everyone's expectations.
<br><br>
They hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm, and their Souls of Light were still in the Lust World. Yet, their battle was much fiercer than that between any ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warriors.
<br><br>
What was even more terrifying was that the Evil God had actually come out of Zen's inner world! Among the many leaders, the expression in Elizabeth's eyes was the most unreadable.
<br><br>
She recalled the time when Zen escaped her clutches. He had used the Withering Power and the Wind Cloud Escape. These two methods were the theurgies possessed by the chieftains of the Nine Li race. However, she did not think much about it at the time.
<br><br>
Now she knew that Zen had the Soaring Snake Sword, and the Evil God could copy three heads and six arms. She was certain that Zen was from the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
He was also the spokesperson of a civilization, and he wielded the Soaring Snake Sword.
<br><br>
Was Zen also the one who could enter the Other Shore with his physical body? 'How could the remaining members of the Nine Li race cultivate such a genius?' she wondered angrily.
<br><br>
Back then, when Zen was still young, Elizabeth hadn't been able to kill him.
<br><br>
Now, she didn't even have a chance. Zen's performance unsettled her to her very core.
<br><br>
Chapter 3478 Ask For Death Despite the burning gazes that Zen felt on him the moment he came out, he walked towards the Oneness Sky Palace with a smile.
<br><br>
Yet, before he could take a few steps forward, a leader of the Separate Abyss race suddenly stood up and shouted in a rough voice, "Zen!"
<br><br>
Zen turned his head and looked at the leader.
<br><br>
He had never made a move against the Separate Abyss race in the Chaotic Source World. What did their leader want from him? "Hand over that man called the Evil God! Since he killed many of our members, we'll execute him for revenge," the leader said.
<br><br>
The leader had to give a reasonable explanation for the death of Hamzah, and the best way to do it was to bring the Evil God back.
<br><br>
He clearly saw that Zen had absorbed the Evil God into his inner world and did not kill him.
<br><br>
When Zen heard the leader's request, he looked slightly amused as he spoke, "The Evil God killed many people, including those from the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mouse race, the Divine Farmer race, the Sun Crow race, the Moon Spirit race, the Celestial Wolf race… He killed more than four thousand people in total. If all these races want to take revenge, how many pieces will the Evil God be chopped into?"
<br><br>
The leader of the Separate Abyss race snorted, "I don't care about the other races. Since the Evil God killed Hamzah, we want him dead!"
<br><br>
He walked towards Zen, his huge body blocking the warrior's path like a giant pillar.
<br><br>
"The Evil God also killed many of our members. It seems that we should also take him back for punishment," Elizabeth said with a shallow smile.
<br><br>
"The Evil God slaughtered the members of our race. He should be punished!" a leader of the Bearing race shouted. The Chaotic Source World was known for its cruelty. Ever since ancient times, there had been countless talents who died in its territory.
<br><br>
It was true that the Evil God was bloodthirsty and liked to kill, but he didn't violate the rules. Therefore, he shouldn't be blamed.
<br><br>
Of course, the super forces that suffered great losses in the Chaotic Source World naturally had plans in their minds.
<br><br>
The truth was, they were all after the Civilization Artifact that the Evil God had merged with.
<br><br>
Now that the Separate Abyss race had stood out first, the other super forces echoed the same request.
<br><br>
The leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace hadn't thought that these super forces would be so shameless as to make trouble after Zen had returned from the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Athemar stepped out, stood in front of Zen and announced, "Everyone, have you forgotten the rules of the Chaotic Source World? Anyone who wants to reach the Chaotic Source Realm must be prepared for death!"
<br><br>
"Of course I know the rules, but this is not the Chaotic Source World. This is the Icy Snow Province!" the leader of the Separate Abyss race sneered.
<br><br>
It was clear that these super forces had allied with each other in order to force Zen to hand over the Evil God.
<br><br>
"Do you mean to say that you are the big boss of the Icy Snow Province?"
<br><br>
Yan asked coldly. It was known that the Pear Hill had unwillingly made the Icy Snow Province a public place.
<br><br>
Still, it wasn't far away from the Pear Hill, so it was still under the Pear Hill's domain.
<br><br>
These races would have to think twice if they really wanted to fight within their grounds.
<br><br>
Since the leaders noticed that Fuxi had been away to chase after the Thunder Dimorphodon, they took the opportunity to make the request. The Separate Abyss race started first, and then the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, and the other races followed suit.
<br><br>
The leader of the Separate Abyss race chuckled, "I don't know who has the final say in the Icy Snow Province. I only know that I have to bring that man named the Evil God back. Otherwise..."
<br><br>
His eyes narrowed slightly and revealed a hint of dangerous intent. Then, the auras in the bodies of the other leaders of the Separate Abyss race began to intensify, and the mountain-like pressure directly rushed towards Zen and Athemar.
<br><br>
The color of Athemar's face was drained. There was a crisp sound when he pulled out his long cyan sword, and then he declared, "If you want to fight here, I will fight to the end!"
<br><br>
In turn, Winchell and the other mountain leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace pulled out their swords one after another as well.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace suffered the least casualties, and everyone alive had gotten enough crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits and reached the Chaotic Source Realm because of Zen.
<br><br>
Therefore, they would do their best to protect Zen and fight against the enemy.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the current situation made Elizabeth overjoyed. If the Separate Abyss race really made a move, it would be a great opportunity for her.
<br><br>
Her lips moved as she said something to the leaders of the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race using her life vitality.
<br><br>
After the leaders heard her words, their lips stretched into a smile.
<br><br>
Dorothy, Elvinia, Chaim, and the other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace shared dreadful looks. They didn't expect that the other races would cause such a ruckus after Zen left the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
As for Yan, she wore a deep frown.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had sent Fuxi here to take charge of the Chaotic Source World, but he had chased after the Thunder Dimorphodon and left without a trace.
<br><br>
She thought for a while, and then she lightly turned her hand and took out a small scroll from her space ring.
<br><br>
Although it was not convenient for the Snake Goddess to come personally, she was not the only mighty warrior in Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Just as Yan was about to activate the scroll, a mark of Eight Diagrams suddenly appeared on the body of the leader of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
When everyone present saw the mark, they immediately felt very distressed, and looked greatly troubled.
<br><br>
Athemar held Zen's hand and flew backwards. At the same time, Elizabeth and the other leaders also distanced themselves from the leader of the Separate Abyss race.
<br><br>
Even the other leaders of the Separate Abyss race themselves retreated rapidly in utter shock! The leader of the Separate Abyss race feared for his life when he saw the mark of Eight Diagrams on his body. If Fuxi gave him a palm strike, he would probably die without a complete corpse! "Well... Master Fuxi, you must have misunderstood! I just didn't know how to explain to our emperor… Please forgive me..."
<br><br>
The emperor that the leader referred to was the current head of the Separate Abyss race, who was also one of the top masters in the Source World. The leader wanted to scare Fuxi by mentioning the emperor.
<br><br>
While he pitifully explained himself, an invisible force suddenly enveloped him.
<br><br>
Bang! With a muffled sound, a huge palm imprint appeared where the leader stood. His body had turned into minced meat and was embedded into the palm imprint in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>
Then, the space was torn, and Fuxi walked out from it with a dark face.
<br><br>
He was in a bad mood after the Thunder Dimorphodon had run away. When he flew back along the space channel and saw what was happening, he couldn't restrain his anger anymore.
<br><br>
"Do you think I will be afraid of your emperor?" he hissed with gritted teeth.
<br><br>
"Before you entered the Chaotic Source World, I have reminded you that I won't interfere in anything within it, but if you make a move outside, don't blame me for being ruthless!"
<br><br>
Silence hung like a thick curtain at the gate of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
The dead leader of the Separate Abyss race was ranked in the top five among the many leaders. Even then, he could not even survive Fuxi's palm strike. He died miserably.
<br><br>
Naturally, Elizabeth trembled with fear.
<br><br>
It wasn't only her, but the leaders of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were all afraid as well.
<br><br>
Chapter 3479 Grown Bearing Capacity (Part One) If Fuxi had come late for even a moment, they would have already attacked the members of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
If that were the case, they would have met with the same tragic fate as that of the Separate Abyss race's leader.
<br><br>
Fuxi nonchalantly scanned the remaining creatures, his eyes barren of all emotions.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source World came to existence because of the compromise made by Pear Hill with the other powerful forces years ago. Fuxi had always looked down upon this agreement and never agreed with it.
<br><br>
With a solemn expression on his face, he took in a deep breath to gather all his strength and announced in a roaring voice, capable of reaching vast distances.
<br><br>
"Effective today, the Chaotic Source World will remain closed forever. This won't happen in the future. I hereby declare that Pear Hill will resume its control over the Icy Snow Province. Now, all of you, make yourselves scarce, and don't make me repeat myself!"
<br><br>
In the past, the Icy Snow Province was forced to separate from the Pear Hill in order to build the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
As of present, some issues had surfaced in the Chaotic Source Sea. The Chaotic Source Spirits in the Source World had all been slaughtered, leaving nothing to vouch for their existence.
<br><br>
The only thing that remained of the Chaotic Source World was a hollowedout shell. With no concrete reason left to support the argument of the Chaotic Source World's continued existence, the Icy Snow Province was returned to Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Sensing the growing irritation in Fuxi's voice, the leaders of the powerful forces didn't waste their breaths to protest against it. Instead, they signaled their subordinates before they quietly turned around and left for their respective flying ships without looking back.
<br><br>
Similarly, Mount followed the people of the Divine Farmer race and set out to head back. Before he left, he stole a quick glance at Zen as he walked away.
<br><br>
Mount's mind was clouded with the many questions that remained unanswered, it tugged at his emotions and made him restless. He was curious about what Zen had experienced in the exiled world.
<br><br>
And how did Zen manage to make out of there alive without a scratch? Giving in to his curiosity, he had planned to find all his answers by confronting Zen. However, he soon changed his mind after he witnessed the sullen expression displayed on Fuxi's face. Moreover, there was also a high chance of Zen not telling him the full truth.
<br><br>
Whoosh! One by one, the giant flying ships made their exit as they flew into the sky and entered different space channels.
<br><br>
However, the people of the Oneness Sky Palace remained in their place and didn't leave with the others.
<br><br>
They were well aware of the fact that they were now a target of many races.
<br><br>
And now, after Zen had displayed the Soaring Snake Sword, their hostility would elevate till it knew no bounds.
<br><br>
The sword alone was enough to lure the greedy gazes of many people aspiring to possess it as their own. If they had left with the rest of the ships, they would most likely walk right into an ambush.
<br><br>
Even if Winchell and Athemar boasted immense power, they would still fall short of protecting Zen under the joint siege of many powerful warriors altogether.
<br><br>
In less than an hour, the once bustling scene of countless flying ships docked at a distance faltered as they all left one after the other.
<br><br>
The only ones that remained at the gate of the Chaotic Source World were the people of the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of the situation, Athemar turned to Fuxi and bowed with the utmost respect. "Human Sovereign, would you be kind enough to allow us to stay in the Icy Snow Province for several more days?"
<br><br>
Fuxi was aware of their ordeal, he understood the concerns expressed by Athemar. He waved his hands as if to brush off all his worries and said, "That won't be necessary. You do not have to suffer the harsh cold weather of the Icy Snow Province. Instead, why don't you stay at Pear Hill for a few days before you leave? Besides, Yan has been missing her brother for a long time."
<br><br>
After hearing Fuxi's generous offer, the faces of Athemar, Winchell, and the others lit up with joy. They cupped their hands to him to express their overflowing gratitude. Feeling satisfied after their successful exchange, the leaders from each mountain gathered their disciples and made their way back to their flying ships.
<br><br>
Soon, they all set sail in the southwest direction as a group.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill lay in the Pear Province, which was nearly as large as the Icy Snow Province. The vast Pear Hill started from the edge of the Pear Province and stretched all the way to the center of the province. Its height was so high that its peak was shrouded with clouds and mist.
<br><br>
Once they entered the vicinity of the Pear Province, they were already climbing up the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
As soon as they crossed the border of the Pear Province, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace lifted their gazes and looked ahead. The sight in front of them made their mouth gape open subconsciously. They stared in the distance, with their faces revealing conflicting expressions of both shock and awe.
<br><br>
Each of the mountains that stood dominantly in the Bloom Divine Province was frighteningly high. Their overwhelming size was the source of pride of the members of the Oneness Sky Palace. However, the scenery before their eyes made the ones from the Oneness Sky Palace pale in comparison.
<br><br>
After all, Pear Hill was almost the same size as the province itself. Though it claimed itself a hill only, it actually had the largest mountain found in the Source World within its boundaries.
<br><br>
Slowly yet gradually, seven flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace dominated the skies as they entered the perimeters of the province.
<br><br>
Following the arrangement of the Pear Hill, they berthed near the Sunset Ravine.
<br><br>
The Sunset Ravine was decorated with various flower-strewn meadows and verdant trees, whose existence complimented the ravine's beauty and made it appear like a fairyland. Beautiful palaces carved with intricate designs and careful crafting were placed in organized rows. Pear Hill had designed a place exquisitely to entertain the guests. And now, this was handed over to the people of the Oneness Sky Palace, to provide them with accommodations for a few days.
<br><br>
Chapter 3480 Grown Bearing Capacity (Part Two) Many disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had experienced fearsome battles of their own in the Chaotic Source World. Each of these fights came at a cost of their Other Shore Power being drained out. After they gained a moment of rest from all that turmoil, they settled down, and each chose an exclusive spot for them to cultivate in seclusion.
<br><br>
After obtaining the Chaotic Source Spirits, they had to get accustomed to their newly acquired power of the Chaotic Source Realm. On the other hand, they also had to replenish their exhausted Other Shore Power to stabilize themselves.
<br><br>
Compared to all the disciples, Zen had used up the largest amount of Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
It cost him a great deal of Other Shore Power to summon the Regal Jade statues through the Regal Jade chessboard. Moreover, Zen had summoned the entire Regal Jade World shortly after, employing the Inheritance of World.
<br><br>
Although the storage volume of the Civilization Artifact was by no means small, the Other Shore Power in it still wouldn't be enough to support too many powerful skills.
<br><br>
According to the Regal Jade Spirit, even if there were sufficient amounts of Other Shore Power, Zen could perform the Regal Jade World two times in one go without a hitch. After that, the entire Other Shore Power stored in the Civilization Artifact would be emptied completely.
<br><br>
With a series of light thuds on the ground, one after the other, the divine crystals fell from Zen's space ring and gathered in a pile.
<br><br>
The number of crystals was so vast that they formed a small mountain of their own and occupied the entire room.
<br><br>
With a flick of his fingers, streaks of invisible light as sharp as a sword slashed at the divine crystals swiftly. Like cracked open walnuts, the divine crystals split in half effortlessly and unleashed the energy hidden within them relentlessly.
<br><br>
As if preparing himself, Zen closed his eyes shut and took in a deep breath to draw his focus in one place.
<br><br>
As a result, the raging flow of energy running wild around him reacted to his guide and began to converge above him. As if taking the shape of a river, it poured itself wholly into the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
The large pile consisted of three million divine crystals.
<br><br>
Zen had to absorb seven such piles of divine crystals to replenish the whole Other Shore Power in the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
"It seems it would cost me twenty million divine crystals to use the Civilization Artifact only once…" Zen muttered under his breath as he estimated the amount in his head and shook his head. A wry smile took shape on his face.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Chiyou had bestowed upon him a great legacy of divine crystals. Originally, he had planned to revive the Nine Li race with them, but soon his self-made bubble of that dream popped right in front of him when he had to face the harsh reality. He soon realized his plans were nothing short of wishful thinking if he relied only on the legacy left behind by Chiyou.
<br><br>
As the amount of Other Shore Power he could bear continued to grow, replenishing it would require a larger amount of divine crystals. Eventually, the ones he now possessed would be insufficient for his use in the future.
<br><br>
Upon restoring the power in the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization to maximum capacity, Zen summoned the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, part of the Other Shore Power of this Civilization Artifact was consumed by the Evil God. What was worse, it was partly burned and damaged. Zen concluded it would take an outrageous amount of Other Shore Power to repair the weapon back to its perfect condition.
<br><br>
As soon as he summoned this cubic-shaped object, a familiar nonchalant voice echoed in the room and announced sharply, "Heaven-level first-class task, burn down the entire Pear Hill, and kill over fifty thousand members of the Snake Goddess race. After completing the mission, your reward is…"
<br><br>
"Heaven-level first-class task, challenge the Snake Goddess. After completing the mission, your reward is..."
<br><br>
"……"
<br><br>
Perhaps when this artifact was in the Evil God's grip, his violent nature rubbed off on the cube. Most of the tasks assigned by it included various types of slaughtering-like challenges.
<br><br>
Even if he tried to remove the influence left by the Evil God, it would take up most of his time. Zen was left with no other choice but to ignore it.
<br><br>
Just as Zen had predicted, this Civilization Artifact consumed much more divine crystals than that of the Regal Jade Civilization.
<br><br>
The entirety of Zen's night was spent replenishing the cube to its maximum potential. The whole ordeal had cost him a large sum of forty million divine crystals.
<br><br>
Moving onto the next step, Zen brought out the Strength God Totem.
<br><br>
After recharging its power with the aid of divine crystals, Zen quickly activated the totem. Soon, violent streaks of Other Shore Power gushed out from the depths of his stomach. It navigated its way through the meridians of his body, flowing gracefully until it reached his right hand and gathered in one place.
<br><br>
"1, 000 divine megatons!"
<br><br>
"1, 100 divine megatons!"
<br><br>
"1, 200 divine megatons!"
<br><br>
Previously, Zen's body was able to bear 1, 000 divine megatons of force at once. If he wanted to make his body resilient against more, he had to rely on the Regal Jade chessboard to summon forth the Regal Jade statues. An alternative way was to activate the Inheritance of World.
<br><br>
But now, after absorbing the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, his bearing capacity of Other Shore Power and his strength had grown by leaps and bounds.
<br><br>
Chapter 3481 Become Fatigued After Nine Seconds Since the Strength God Totem was a strengthening type of Other Shore Token, it could only release 1, 200 divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
Zen gathered this force in his right hand. To his satisfaction, he could feel that the light dots scattered within his body danced happily.
<br><br>
Although the power was concentrated in his right hand, the light dots all over his body bore the power together. It was a wonderful feeling.
<br><br>
'These light dots have an innate affinity for power. They can completely absorb both the Other Shore Power from my body and the power created by the outside world, ' Zen thought with a smile.
<br><br>
Only after absorbing the Chaotic Source Spirits did Zen truly understand the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
The Wild God Power could make one's own body grow infinitely, and the strength of the physical body could also constantly increase. On the other hand, the innate disadvantage of the Grand World Cultivation Method was that one couldn't refine their physical body. Thus they had to choose to make use of the Chaotic Source Spirits for cultivation in the end.
<br><br>
Even the 1, 200 megatons of power wasn't Zen's limit; simultaneously, he tried drawing more power from the Civilization Artifact.
<br><br>
Gradually, as its power flowed into Zen's body, he felt the pressure in his right hand continue to increase.
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
The light dots within his body practically buzzed with excitement. Zen felt a stream of burning power being released from them.
<br><br>
1, 300 divine megatons...
<br><br>
1, 500 divine megatons...
<br><br>
1, 800 divine megatons...
<br><br>
2, 000 divine megatons...
<br><br>
When the power reached 2, 000 divine megatons, it seemed the dots of light had reached their limit.
<br><br>
However, Zen didn't stop there. When he continued to exert the Other Shore Power, the light dots dimmed rapidly.
<br><br>
Three seconds passed...
<br><br>
Six seconds...
<br><br>
Nine seconds...
<br><br>
After nine seconds, the radiance in the light dots were all gone, and the 2, 00 dots of light in his body were quickly exhausted.
<br><br>
"Zen, spread out the Other Shore Power quickly. Otherwise, your body won't be able to bear it, and will consequently collapse," No. 9527 cautioned.
<br><br>
Zen's body could be likened to a balloon filled with air. The dots of light helped the balloon's material stay intact, but once the Chaotic Source Spirits were exhausted, the power would be out of control. The force of 2, 000 divine megatons would be enough to cause his body to explode! At No. 9527's reminder, Zen suddenly threw a punch forward. The 2, 000 divine megatons of power was unleashed, destroying the entire wall before him.
<br><br>
"Rumble..."
<br><br>
The punch was so powerful that a deep furrow was plowed out in the palace courtyard. Even a part of the aisle in front of the palace was damaged.
<br><br>
Some guards of the Pear Hill who had been nearby rushed towards the sound to find out what all the ruckus was about. To their surprise, the palace wall had crumbled, exposing a guilty-looking Zen from within.
<br><br>
"This is the thirteenth time tonight!" a guard complained. "How can the Oneness Sky Palace disciples who live here be so reckless?!"
<br><br>
Today, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had all wanted to test the strength of their physical bodies since reaching the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Many disciples unscrupulously used their Other Shore Tokens to the maximum. The Other Shore Power flowed within their bodies. Their newfound strength made them feel empowered.
<br><br>
However, the Chaotic Source Spirits only bore the power for roughly a day, and their dots of light were rather weak. Fusing with the Other Shore Power quickly exhausted the Chaotic Source Spirits. To prevent their physical bodies from collapsing, they had no choice but to release all the energy.
<br><br>
In this particular row of palaces, havoc was wreaked. Some roofs were overturned, some courtyards were flattened, and ditches dotted the road from randomly unleashed punches.
<br><br>
The head of the guards made a 'hiss' expression. He was clear that among the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace living in these palaces, one warrior was the most honorable guest.
<br><br>
It was said that he was Yan's brother.
<br><br>
Yan was well known in the Pear Hill, since she held a high position. In the whole Pear Hill, even the leaders of sects and mountains seldom had the chance to meet the Snake Goddess in the flesh. On the other hand, Yan had been treated like the Snake Goddess's own daughter.
<br><br>
After shooting a glare at the noisy complainant, the leader of the guards entered Zen's courtyard. Zen, upon seeing his approach, smiled sheepishly and said, "I'm sorry. I couldn't control my own strength."
<br><br>
"It's all our fault," the leader of the guards responded amicably. "You all have just passed the test of the Chaotic Source World; we should've expected that you would need to focus on cultivation. Please, follow me to the training room." He gestured.
<br><br>
Under the arrangement of the leader of the guards, Zen moved from this damaged palace to another.
<br><br>
After the Chaotic Source Spirits got fatigued, they couldn't recover fast.
<br><br>
About two hours later, the light dots, which dimmed just now, gradually became lustrous again.
<br><br>
"After you merge with the Chaotic Source Spirits, the Oneness Sky Palace will give you the body refining method to train them. By then, you need to be able to constantly extract the Other Shore Power to stimulate the Chaotic Source Spirits. This way, the Chaotic Source Spirits in your body will gradually become stronger," No. 9527 explained.
<br><br>
"So this method of body refining is to use the Chaotic Source Spirits repeatedly?" Zen clarified.
<br><br>
"Yes, the methods of body refining of various races are similar. It will take some time to master," No. 9527 replied.
<br><br>
Fusing with the Chaotic Source Spirits meant merging them with their own body; they could only strengthen them gradually, by feeding them with the Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
The Oneness Sky Palace disciples from the Land of Sword Grief had reached the Chaotic Source Realm many years ago; it was no wonder the Chaotic Source Spirits in their bodies were much stronger than those of Zen.
<br><br>
Zen could only imagine how strong the Chaotic Source Spirits of people like Athemar were.
<br><br>
"It seems that such growth speed is too low..." Zen frowned slightly.
<br><br>
Having reached the Chaotic Source Realm meant that everyone was starting from the same level. However, many powerful warriors in the Source World had reached the Chaotic Source Realm thousands, or even millions, of years earlier than Zen.
<br><br>
These thoughts raced through Zen's mind as he attempted to extract the Other Shore Power again.
<br><br>
This time, Zen had only infused the Other Shore Power of about 800 divine megatons. Most of the power was borne directly by his own physical body.
<br><br>
When Zen's physical body endured excessive Other Shore Power, it would glow a faint golden light. The aura that emanated from him was very similar to the Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
No. 9527 and Regal Jade Spirit had not been able to figure out what kind of Truth of Godly Way it was. At the very least, they knew it was completely different from the real Truth of Powerful Holy Body.
<br><br>
800 divine megatons...
<br><br>
900 divine megatons...
<br><br>
1, 000 divine megatons...
<br><br>
Zen came to a halt upon reaching 1, 000 divine megatons of power.
<br><br>
When Zen's physical body was being refined, he could exert only a small amount of power.
<br><br>
At the very beginning, when Zen's physical body was refined, there would be warm currents appearing in his body. These warm currents could have effect on his body in the beginning, but now they were almost ineffective.
<br><br>
However, the more Zen fought in battle, the stronger the aura of the Truth of Godly Way became.
<br><br>
Although the aura was special, Zen still couldn't figure out a way to make use of it.
<br><br>
Chapter 3482 The Master Of Rose Sect When he was in the divine land, the golden light Zen radiated was strong enough to hurt his opponents.
<br><br>
However, that kind of power was no longer enough when he reached the Source World. Zen was far more powerful than before. A casual blow from him now was a thousand times as powerful as what he used to be capable of when he fought with all his might.
<br><br>
Just as Zen stopped, he let out a sharp curse under his breath. The aura of Truth of Godly Way was still as strong as it ever was, rather than disappeared. It was actually flowing along his meridians and converging into the spots of light all over his body.
<br><br>
"Buzz!"
<br><br>
The spots of light within Zen's body glowed even more fiercely after absorbing the aura of Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
"What's wrong?" No. 9527 asked.
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source Spirits are absorbing my truth aura!" Zen replied in astonishment.
<br><br>
"How could that happen?" No. 9527 replied doubtfully.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Spirit was not like any Other Shore Token. In fact, it was an exception, just like the giant eye in the Chaotic Source World, though no one had yet figured out exactly how that worked.
<br><br>
But one thing was certain. The Chaotic Source Spirit could not be borne as an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
That meant that there was no way to communicate with it through the Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
Zen's sudden findings confused No. 9527. It had never encountered a situation like this before.
<br><br>
It had just said that the power of the Chaotic Source Spirits couldn't grow rapidly. This frustrated Zen. How long would it take to reach the level of Athemar, or even Fuxi? He just didn't know.
<br><br>
But after the spots of light absorbed the truth aura, the Chaotic Source Spirits seemed to become somehow stronger. Zen felt like he had seen a shortcut appear out of nowhere. He was so excited that he activated the Regal Jade chessboard.
<br><br>
Using the Other Shore Power to summon the truth aura from the corporeal body was quite inefficient.
<br><br>
But using some object to do that was another matter entirely.
<br><br>
As Zen's fingers gently stroked the chessboard, Regal Jade sculptures appeared around him one by one.
<br><br>
"Ten should be enough!"
<br><br>
As Zen gently moved the chess pieces along the chessboard with a single finger, the sculptures sprang into action. The largest one held him aloft, while the other nine sculptures began to hammer on him with their fists.
<br><br>
"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!"
<br><br>
Thanks to the violent blows he received from the Regal Jade sculptures, a golden light surrounded his body. The light increased in size and intensity, and eventually engulfed the Regal Jade sculptures.
<br><br>
But because the sculptures were quite tough, the golden light couldn't hurt them too much.
<br><br>
The attacks caused muffled sounds to circle in the air over the palace.
<br><br>
The sounds shook the Pear Hill guards out of their reverie.
<br><br>
"Aren't we going to find out what that is?" a guard asked his chief in confusion.
<br><br>
The chief guard was speechless. He had no idea what Zen was doing in the palace alone, but he finally managed to hold it back. "No. He's an honored guest, a distinguished guest."
<br><br>
The Regal Jade sculptures were still attacking Zen. Their blows became more powerful, and the golden light responded in kind. It simply got brighter.
<br><br>
Before he had fused with the Chaotic Source Spirits, the golden light would dissipate, but now it converged at the spots of light. The two hundred such spots in his body kept devouring the golden light like hungry beasts.
<br><br>
This lasted for an entire night.
<br><br>
Zen didn't use the Shade Stone, nor did he activate the Chaotic Source Spirits. He just let the Regal Jade sculptures rain blows on him all night.
<br><br>
At dawn, the sounds of hammering in the palace finally stopped. Although the first ten sculptures didn't have much power, it was still not easy to withstand thousands of punches without any means of defense.
<br><br>
Zen looked exhausted, but his eyes had that telltale glint of excitement.
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source Spirits have become far more powerful after absorbing this Truth of Godly Way!"
<br><br>
"It's... It's so incredible..." No. 9527 was confused too.
<br><br>
Since it couldn't figure it out, it even stole into Zen's inner world to ask the Regal Jade Spirit for guidance.
<br><br>
The Regal Jade Spirit understood the Other Shore better than No. 9527, but he didn't know any more about the thirteen Truths of Godly Ways than the one who asked him. So when the Regal Jade Spirit saw the fourteenth Truth of Godly Way—the Truth of Three-Energy Construction for the first time, he was as astonished as No. 9527.
<br><br>
He could not understand what had happened to Zen's corporeal body and how the truth aura had been siphoned from his body.
<br><br>
But right now, the reasons were immaterial. They had to deal with things as they were now. The answers could wait.
<br><br>
The truth aura that was drawn by the hammering could not only nourish the Chaotic Source Spirits and make them stronger, but also could quickly dispel their fatigue.
<br><br>
It meant that Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits could last longer than anyone else's. It would take much more time to exhaust them. Zen could even use his opponent's power in a battle to create the truth aura, in order to make his Chaotic Source Spirits even stronger.
<br><br>
Just as Zen was taking it all in, a guard suddenly called from the palace door. "The master of Rose Sect wants to see you!"
<br><br>
"The master of Rose Sect?"
<br><br>
Zen was a little confused to hear the title, not realizing who that was.
<br><br>
"It's Emily. You know, from the bottom of the chaos," No. 9527 reminded him.
<br><br>
"Emily!"
<br><br>
It was not until then that Zen remembered who the master of Rose Sect was.
<br><br>
Emily had guided him and his sister on their journey to the Source World.
<br><br>
He hadn't seen her since they last parted.
<br><br>
Zen pushed the door open and walked out. His gaze fell upon Emily, all in green, standing at the door with a smile on her face.
<br><br>
Because of Yan's bloodline, Yan could only be brought back to the Pear Hill by her. But Emily had always believed that Zen could become more powerful than his sister.
<br><br>
To Emily's surprise, however, Yan had been treated like a VIP after she entered the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Yan didn't have to be rigorously tested before she was promoted, unlike every other talent. The Snake Goddess even agreed to see her right away.
<br><br>
She had a meteoric rise to stardom.
<br><br>
Emily had known that Yan might be very important to the Pear Hill because of her bloodline, but she had never expected Yan to be that influential.
<br><br>
Emily was given an unexpected reward only because she had escorted Yan there. Moreover, she was allowed to return to Rose Sect. What was more, she was given the soul crystal, so that her Soul of Light cultivation improved rapidly. In just a few years, she reached the twelfth stage of the Other Shore Realm.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, however, the Chaotic Source World had opened before she could reach the thirteenth stage. So she had to give up on the opportunity.
<br><br>
She had thought that Zen, who had entered the Oneness Sky Palace, would make slower progress. After all, he came from the Nine Li race. If someone from any other race joined the Oneness Sky Palace, it would be hard for him to achieve something unless he trained for a thousand years.
<br><br>
That was why Emily was gobsmacked when Leopold told her Zen was going to enter the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
After all, Emily had reached the Other Shore Realm many years ago, and Zen was still wandering the Sea of Truth when he entered the Source World. However, before Emily could reach the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm, Zen was already qualified to enter the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Chapter 3483 Gift It had only been a few years, but Zen had become one of the top disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace. He wasn't on Yan's level, but he was still pretty amazing.
<br><br>
However, after the Chaotic Source World was closed, the stories that had happened inside this world spread like wildfire in the Source World, and the Pear Hill was the first to know.
<br><br>
After Emily learned what Zen did in the Chaotic Source World, she was also flabbergasted.
<br><br>
She could not completely understand what Zen had gone through to reach this level in a handful of years.
<br><br>
Today, when Emily saw Zen again, he was already a Chaotic Source Realm warrior. However, she knew that Zen was more powerful than anybody that had returned from the Chaotic Source World claimed. He was far stronger than those Chaotic Source Realm warriors.
<br><br>
"You have greatly improved your cultivation. Truly impressive. You can probably cow Sanjay of the Sky Guard Pavilion now. He surely wouldn't dare to fight you," Emily said, hands behind her back.
<br><br>
Sanjay of the Sky Guard Pavilion had once chased them at the gate of the Source World, forcing Zen and Yan to split up to avoid him. Although Sanjay was a Chaotic Source Realm warrior in the Sky Guard Pavilion of the Bearing race, he wasn't even among the top 3, 000.
<br><br>
Zen could make the Regal Jade World descend, and Sanjay was indeed no match for him at the moment.
<br><br>
"If I meet him one day, I guess I'll have to thank him personally," Zen said with a smile. He had accidentally joined the Sword Light Palace before, and ended up becoming a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
"I'd buy tickets to see that..." Emily uttered.
<br><br>
With the Inheritance of World activated, Zen was still not as powerful as Elizabeth or Athemar, but he would be able to instantly kill many Chaotic Source Realm warriors. His strength was considerable.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Emily, and said, "The Chaotic Source World has been permanently shut down. There's no way to reach the Chaotic Source Realm now. What are you going to do?"
<br><br>
This was a very serious problem, not only for Emily, but also for many warriors of the Other Shore Realm all across the Source World.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source World would never be opened again. They would never have a chance to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. If they missed it last time, they would never get another chance, unless the Chaotic Source Spirits appeared in the Source World once more and multiplied there.
<br><br>
Emily's eyes darkened when he asked the question.
<br><br>
Not everyone on the Other Shore could master the various skills as rapidly as Zen.
<br><br>
Many people had tried hard on the Other Shore. Only by training their Souls of Light little by little could they cross from stage to stage.
<br><br>
Emily had been able to reach Stage Twelve only because she had brought Yan back and obtained several finger-size chunks of soul crystal. And even then, she was still not qualified to enter the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
"I have the soul crystal," Zen continued. "At least it's enough for you to enter the Desire World."
<br><br>
If one didn't reach the Chaotic Source Realm, even if they made it to the Desire World, it would be difficult for them to fully employ the Other Shore Tokens' power. Just like in the middle ages, they could only choose the descending type of Other Shore Tokens.
<br><br>
When he made the offer, Emily immediately paid him rapt attention, her eyes wide.
<br><br>
Those who had devoured the soul crystal knew what it could do. It could increase the level of the Soul of Light. But it was so rare and powerful that few ordinary warriors could own it.
<br><br>
"I also have Chaotic Source Spirits," Zen said as he gently turned his hand.
<br><br>
A handful of amber colored crystals were revealed to Emily, flickering slightly. There were 200 crystals in total.
<br><br>
When Emily saw the crystals, her eyes were as big as saucers. A lot of talents had sacrificed their lives in the fight for the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
"No one is allowed to bring the Chaotic Source Spirits out. How could you..." Emily whispered.
<br><br>
She had a vague feeling that Zen would give these things to her, but she knew the soul crystal and the Chaotic Source Spirits were very precious. It was too much to comfortably accept.
<br><br>
But the temptation was too strong. She had to have them.
<br><br>
"Anyway, no one will care. I brought some with me," Zen said with a shrug.
<br><br>
There were tens of thousands of crystals in the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. After Zen passed them out to the Oneness Sky Palace disciples and the members of the Pear Hill, he kept 2, 000 crystals for himself. These crystals were enough for ten people to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Emily had proven herself a loyal companion when they traveled through the chaos. She deserved such a reward, and Zen thought this fitting.
<br><br>
"Are you really... going to give these to me?" Emily's eyes shone with hope.
<br><br>
She had heard that Zen had come to Pear Hill, so she came to see him, but she had never expected that he would show her the crystals.
<br><br>
"I'll place the soul crystal in the care of the Ear Mouse race on Stage Thirteen. You can ask them for it after you reach that stage," Zen said as he handed the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits to Emily.
<br><br>
"This..." Emily didn't know what to say at all.
<br><br>
Emily was once an invincible master in Zen's eyes, and she had a regal bearing.
<br><br>
Perhaps it was because Zen had improved his cultivation base and had surpassed Emily that seeing Emily's uneasy expression, he found her kind of cute.
<br><br>
In the end, Emily accepted the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, a wonderful gift that she would not refuse.
<br><br>
Refining the Chaotic Source Spirits required the array in the Chaotic Source World. Now that the Icy Snow Province had been retaken by the Pear Hill, it shouldn't be difficult for Emily, the sect leader, to enter.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill held a banquet to entertain the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the mountain leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace weren't there, so the Pear Hill only sent some sect leaders to accompany the members of the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
After exploring the Chaotic Source World, all the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace were laid back, especially Chaim and Sally. Such exercise was relaxing to them, and kept them active and happy.
<br><br>
After the banquet, a woman showed up. Her body was half-human and halfsnake. She looked at Zen and announced, "Zen of the Oneness Sky Palace, the Snake Goddess demands to see you."
<br><br>
Everyone looked at Zen. Some were in surprise, while some had more complex expressions.
<br><br>
To the people of the Pear Hill, the Snake Goddess was not only a leader but also a spiritual symbol. She was the base of the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
There weren't many who had ever seen the Snake Goddess in person, even in the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
Athemar nodded to Zen, and Zen stood and left the table. He followed the woman out of the room.
<br><br>
After Zen had departed, the grand sect leader held a glass of wine and toasted Athemar. "Yan's arrival has brought honor to our Pear Hill, but I didn't expect her brother, the disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace, to be just as amazing."
<br><br>
Athemar smiled and returned the toast. His grin was still there as he sipped from his glass.
<br><br>
Initially, Athemar had brought Zen back to the Oneness Sky Palace because Zen was a talent capable of Instant Enlightenment. But now, Zen was already the spokesperson of a civilization, which was truly beyond what Athemar thought he could do. It had only been a handful of years, so such an achievement was rather spectacular.
<br><br>
Maybe the Oneness Sky Palace should be grateful Zen joined them.
<br><br>
Chapter 3484 The Snake Goddess The Pear Hill was intimidatingly high, as though it was touching the sky.
<br><br>
However, the moment someone entered it, they would not be able to tell they were inside a hill.
<br><br>
The hill itself was huge—so huge that it sloped ever so gently.
<br><br>
The people living on the Pear Hill sometimes felt as though they lived on a plain rather than on a hill.
<br><br>
The woman of the Snake Goddess race was leading the way, with Zen at her heel.
<br><br>
After passing through two transmission arrays on the way, he was suddenly shrouded in a thick mist.
<br><br>
The mist blocked the flow of his spiritual sense, so he couldn't see anything in front of him. Cautiously, he followed the woman on the climb all the way up into the clouds.
<br><br>
There, he saw a huge jadeite platform floating in the air. Upon stepping onto the platform, the woman saluted to Zen curtly. "Please wait here."
<br><br>
Standing on the jadeite platform, Zen could see the whole Pear Province before him.
<br><br>
Although, it was a bit hazy, with the thick clouds blocking the view.
<br><br>
Similar to the Oneness Sky Palace, the Pear Hill had a few mountain leaders who managed several grand sect leaders. There were more than one hundred sect leaders under the command of the grand sect leaders. Emily was the leader of the Rose Sect.
<br><br>
After around five minutes of waiting, Zen sensed a space wave coming from behind him. As he turned to look, Yan popped out from a space channel.
<br><br>
"Brother!"
<br><br>
she cried gleefully, hopping forward to hug Zen.
<br><br>
Just then, a beautiful woman emerged from the same space channel.
<br><br>
Wearing a purple gown, she looked like royalty. Her eyes revealed a sense of wisdom and experience.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had created many miracles in the Source World. Her two notably important contributions were the Grand World Cultivation Method and the Chaotic Source Spirits. It could be said that she singlehandedly nudged the whole world towards progress.
<br><br>
Staring at the elegant woman before him, Zen was slightly taken aback.
<br><br>
Other than the powerful aura surrounding her, she looked like an ordinary human. She didn't even have the snake tail, a characteristic of the Snake Goddess race.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at his sister dubiously, wondering if this woman in purple was truly the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Brother, this is the Snake Goddess," Yan introduced pointedly.
<br><br>
Thankful that his sister took his hint, Zen clasped his hands and bowed towards the woman. "Snake Goddess, greetings!"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded slightly, watching Zen carefully. "I never expected the two Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds would be this successful," she said, her voice sounding as smooth as butter. "I am very pleased with your achievements. I believe that the Lord of Weapons shares the same sentiments."
<br><br>
Zen's and Yan's bloodlines didn't come from Lorena. Instead, through the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds, the pure bloodlines had been integrated into their bodies. As a result, Yan had the bloodline of the Snake Goddess and Zen had Chiyou's.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, thank you. I am flattered," Zen replied calmly.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess continued. "Back then, the Lord of Weapons didn't listen to my advice and insisted on guarding the Pearl Islet with his clansmen. In the end, things didn't turn out well for him. It only proved he made the wrong decision." Her eyes narrowed. "If he had been willing to bring his subordinates to Pear Province, he and the other members of Nine Li race would have survived."
<br><br>
The Pear Hill had a close relationship with the human race, especially with the Nine Li race Back when the Bearing race had started the war, if the Nine Li race had chosen to retreat, they never would've ended up like that.
<br><br>
Yet, Chiyou and his nine brothers were extremely unyielding.
<br><br>
Since the Bearing race had dared cross the Nine Li race, they were determined to punish them, and they had the ability to do so. However, after the Divine Farmer race joined the Bearing race, the Nine Li race couldn't stand a chance of winning anymore.
<br><br>
Zen had heard about these past events before through several channels. By now, he had already known the whole story. Maintaining his calm expression, he nodded slightly. He wasn't here to chitchat; Zen wanted to know why the Snake Goddess summoned him.
<br><br>
As the Snake Goddess spoke, her eyes looked Zen up and down. Suddenly, her beautiful eyes showed a trace of confusion. Reaching out her hand, she said, "Come over here."
<br><br>
Zen didn't understand what was going on, but reluctantly obeyed.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess gently touched Zen's arm. With a light tap of her fingers, a vast amount of force had been injected into Zen's arm.
<br><br>
The force reached 1500 divine megatons. If it weren't for the support of the Chaotic Source Spirits, Zen's arm would have been damaged from the sudden power.
<br><br>
However, as the Other Shore Power spread from his arm, all the spots of light within Zen's body suddenly pulsated excitedly, as though they were preparing to fight this new "infection". Simultaneously, wisps of golden light shot forth from Zen's body, aiming directly at the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
"Hum?" The Snake Goddess was puzzled. The power of the golden light was very weak. With a flick of her hand, some wisps of golden light dissipated instantly and more of them dived into Zen's body.
<br><br>
"You just integrated the Chaotic Source Spirits into your body yesterday.
<br><br>
How are they stronger than Yan's?" Her brows knitted. "And what is the golden light just now? Its aura is similar to the Truth of Powerful Holy Body, but not exactly the same..."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was very perceptive. If it were anyone else, they probably would not have been able to tell the difference between them.
<br><br>
As for that strange truth aura that shot out from his body, this wasn't the first time it had appeared. Zen had only chosen to ignore it because it was so weak in combat.
<br><br>
"Well..." Zen hesitated. It wasn't because he was distrustful of the Snake Goddess, but rather he didn't want to discuss things he didn't fully understand yet. "I don't know where the golden light comes from. As long as power is injected into my body, or I'm hit in battle, it will pop out..."
<br><br>
Frowning slightly, the Snake Goddess seemed to be lost in thought.
<br><br>
Just like Fuxi's strength, the Snake Goddess's wisdom was universally known.
<br><br>
However, despite her intelligence, it was difficult for her to figure out the Truth of Godly Way on Zen's body.
<br><br>
"There are countless strange and confusing things about the chaos, but most of them are related to the Other Shore. The Truth of Godly Way is used for one to enter the Other Shore," she said carefully. "Yet, this kind of Truth of Godly Way you showed has nothing to do with the Other Shore. This is not the Truth of Godly Way from the chaos!" Her eyes shone bright with wisdom. "I heard from Fuxi that you have used another kind of Truth of Godly Way in the Chaotic Source World. It seemed that it was not included in the thirteen Truths of Godly Ways. It confused me." She paused, as though deep in thought.
<br><br>
"Zen, could you show me that Truth of Godly Way?"
<br><br>
Zen's Truth of Three-Energy Construction had been used in public before.
<br><br>
The others might not notice, but Fuxi noticed it immediately.
<br><br>
Thus, the Snake Goddess wanted Zen to help her understand the situation.
<br><br>
Zen stood motionless for a moment. After a while, he said, "Snake Goddess, since you asked, I will accept your request. However, I want to ask you a question before I do so."
<br><br>
"Go ahead." The Snake Goddess nodded.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, have you met any humans on the Other Shore?" Zen asked abruptly.
<br><br>
Chapter 3485 The Designated Celestial Wolf Race Previously, King Manard had asked Zen to help him find the human race on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
However, ever since Zen entered the Other Shore, he had never heard of the existence of any human. Even the Regal Jade Spirit, who had been in the upper stages of the Other Shore before, had not known the existence of any human there.
<br><br>
According to King Manard, humans were not born in this round of chaos by chance. Instead, it was an inevitable phenomenon. It was the reason why he was very affirmative that Zen should be able to find them somewhere on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The human civilization was many, many years older than the Regal Jade Civilization, and anything could have happened in such a long period.
<br><br>
If Zen really wanted to find an answer, he could only seek it from the supreme human warriors.
<br><br>
He originally wanted to return to the Oneness Sky Palace to see Eastern Emperor Taiyi. But now that he had seen the Snake Goddess, he thought that he could bring up this matter to her.
<br><br>
The moment Zen raised the question, the face of the Snake Goddess suddenly looked serious.
<br><br>
Her smiling face turned quite pale and it was evident that she felt somewhat uncomfortable.
<br><br>
"Why are you asking this question?" the Snake Goddess asked as she stared directly into Zen's eyes.
<br><br>
Yan couldn't help but blink repeatedly in wonder.
<br><br>
She had stayed with the Snake Goddess for quite a long time, and this was the first instance that she had seen her exhibit a mood swing.
<br><br>
'Is Zen's question strange?' she wondered inwardly.
<br><br>
Since there were all sorts of races on the Other Shore, it might not be that uncommon if humans also dwelt there.
<br><br>
"I just want to know," Zen said calmly.
<br><br>
Before getting a certain answer from the Snake Goddess, Zen didn't want to tell her his connection to King Manard.
<br><br>
"It's just out of curiosity? Or is there something else?" the Snake Goddess asked as she tried to fish for some secrets to be spilled.
<br><br>
"Well, yes, there are other reasons. Some are related to the Truth of Godly Way that I'll be showing." As Zen answered, he stretched out his hand and the red, yellow and blue energy beams began spiraling up above his palm.
<br><br>
The energy beams were interwoven with each other and gradually formed a small sculpture of Yan.
<br><br>
"That's amazing! You created it out of nothing!"
<br><br>
Yan had been in the Pear Hill for quite some time and had seen a lot of skills performed by the people there. As she witnessed Zen's skill, she knew that this one was extraordinary at first glance.
<br><br>
Zen had used the Truth of Three-Energy Construction when he fought against the Evil God, but the void construction was showy and not substantial. Thus it was not tactical to be used in defending against the enemy.
<br><br>
A glimmer of surprise flashed across the Snake Goddess's eyes as she intently stared at the statue in Zen's hand.
<br><br>
Void construction could be accomplished with the help of some special Other Shore Tokens, and the things that were created this way were quite powerful. However, there was a huge limitation in this kind of void construction, which was far from what Zen had demonstrated.
<br><br>
"If you're going to give me any information regarding the human race on the Other Shore, I will tell you the origin of this Truth of Godly Way. That's not bad for a deal," Zen asserted.
<br><br>
Zen had given his word to King Manard and wouldn't go back on it.
<br><br>
After Zen finished speaking, he handed the statue to Yan.
<br><br>
Yan held the statue in her hand and played with it for a while. The statue was very lifelike and she loved it so much.
<br><br>
Seeing Zen was pretty determined, the Snake Goddess couldn't help pursing her lips.
<br><br>
It had been many years since she last met a young man who could be so firm in what he wanted. For that, Zen really deserved the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. He had such a firm character likened to the Lord of Weapons.
<br><br>
As the wind blew, the sea of clouds in the distance billowed like waves. The Snake Goddess stood on the jadeite platform and looked at the panoramic view of the magnificent scenery.
<br><br>
She looked into the distance and said, "The birth of humans in this round of chaos was planned."
<br><br>
Zen's heart skipped a beat. It was the exact same thing that King Manard said.
<br><br>
"Actually, not only humans but also super forces like the Ear Mice and the Separate Abyss race were planned to be born. If the Other Shore hadn't intervened in the development of the chaos, there should have already been a ruling civilization in this round of chaos."
<br><br>
"A ruling civilization?"
<br><br>
After going through so much, Zen had come to understand how powerful ruling civilizations could be.
<br><br>
The Dreaded Eye Demons and the Regal Jade Civilization, for example, used to be rulers in chaos.
<br><br>
However, in the current chaos, there existed so many large races that not a single super force could rule the entire chaos. Thus, a ruling civilization didn't exist.
<br><br>
"What kind of interference did you mean?" Zen asked as he became more curious.
<br><br>
"It means that they forcibly introduced other civilizations that don't belong to this round of chaos. If it weren't for the existence of the Ear Mice, the Sun Crow race, the Separate Abyss race, and the Snake Goddess race, the Celestial Wolf race would be the one ruling the chaos," the Snake Goddess finally revealed.
<br><br>
"The Celestial Wolf race?" Zen's eyes narrowed in surprise. "How is that possible?"
<br><br>
A while back, he had met the Celestial Wolf race in the Chaotic Source World. Although they truly were a large race, they were never considered as a super force.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess let out a faint smile. "Well, it's simple. It's because they were the designated ruling civilization in this chaos. Unfortunately, because of our existence, we completely suppressed them. Now, it's impossible for them to grow stronger," she replied.
<br><br>
"They were the designated ruling civilization?" As he couldn't believe what he just heard, Zen asked No. 9527 in his mind, "How come you didn't know about this?"
<br><br>
No. 9527 was a part of the Chaos Ancient God, a creature that had existed in the last round of chaos. That was why Zen became a little confused that it didn't know this piece of information.
<br><br>
"You can't blame it. After all, it's just a soul avatar. It can't bear all of Gerald's memories," the Snake Goddess explained.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the Snake Goddess who was wearing a charming smile on her face. It was as gentle and innocent as that of a child and as shy and vivacious as that of a teenage girl. Moreover, she had the wisdom and the bearing of a goddess. Zen could just imagine a female's entire lifespan by just looking at her.
<br><br>
"You… You are snooping on my soul," Zen uttered the words with an embarrassed expression.
<br><br>
Both the Snake Goddess and King Manard didn't like it when there were people stealthily eavesdropping on them. King Manard even forced No.
<br><br>
9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit out back then.
<br><br>
"No, I am not. I just felt your consciousness fluctuation and read it," said the Snake Goddess softly.
<br><br>
"The Snake Goddess can read one's spiritual sense and messages conveyed through life vitality," Yan reminded her brother.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess could even read one's memories if she wanted to, but she wouldn't do that to Zen.
<br><br>
"In the ancient times of this chaos, there was only one human force.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the birth of this very human force was indeed related to me and my brother."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess's eyes began to glow, as if she had returned to the memories of those savage days. Back then, the chaos was newly created and people didn't know much about the primitive land.
<br><br>
And the "brother" that she was referring to was Fuxi.
<br><br>
Chapter 3486 The Past The thick clouds swirled and trembled even more violently when the Snake Goddess pointed her finger towards the void. Then, she spoke in an oddly mysterious voice, "I can show you the first scene of this round of chaos."
<br><br>
As soon as she was finished, drops of sweet rain fell down.
<br><br>
"Ticking! Ticking! Ticking..."
<br><br>
In turn, Yan reached out to catch the raindrops, only to find that they were just illusions.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the clouds in the distance disappeared and were replaced by a brown ocean.
<br><br>
The current Source World had expanded to an extremely large size.
<br><br>
However, during the beginning of the chaos, the Source World was born as a primitive land, much like an inner world.
<br><br>
The entire Source World was drowned in the sea and over the endless years, the seeds of life gradually sprouted. The most primitive creatures were born.
<br><br>
That particular scene was quite similar to what happened with Zen's inner world when it was first created.
<br><br>
Just then, six light cocoons floated in the vast sky. The light cocoons were translucent, and the shapes of the creatures inside them could be seen easily through their diaphanous structure.
<br><br>
"Are they Chaos Ancient Gods?" Zen asked as he raised his head. The Snake Goddess nodded. Indeed, they were the only living creatures in the last round of chaos.
<br><br>
They had passed through the chaos' empty and lonely stage and observed the Ways-blending Energy. Each of them had learned their own truths.
<br><br>
"I see my master! He is the second on the left!" No. 9527 exclaimed.
<br><br>
Zen looked at the light cocoon it mentioned. Inside the second light cocoon on the left was a shadow shaped like a scorpion.
<br><br>
Zen had never seen Gerald's appearance before.
<br><br>
Gerald's body was buried below the ground, and Zen couldn't see that.
<br><br>
He only knew that Gerald was very large in size, and a piece of his rib was as big as a towering mountain. He didn't expect that Gerald was a scorpion with a large body.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the figures who were in the other light cocoons were different. Their features couldn't be recognized simply from their shapes.
<br><br>
"Splash..."
<br><br>
The rain in the illusion became heavier and heavier, accompanied by the loud thunder.
<br><br>
Tens of millions of years, and even billions of years passed...
<br><br>
It was said that time could easily bring a great change to the world, but how could the sea in the primitive land change greatly so effortlessly? After countless years, some creatures finally appeared in the sea.
<br><br>
Then, the smallest plankton slowly developed and the fish appeared.
<br><br>
"Whoosh!"
<br><br>
Zen looked curious and bewildered when he saw the fish that swam in the sea. He said, "How did these fish grow like this?"
<br><br>
Although there were many sorts of strange fish, those specific fish in this sea looked especially odd.
<br><br>
The fish's brain was surprisingly large and was out of proportion to their body. "You'll know when you keep on seeing the development," the Snake Goddess responded.
<br><br>
The fish passed by, and time sped up by a million times in this illusion.
<br><br>
The sea level quickly went down, and the first patch of land appeared.
<br><br>
Eventually, some fish got washed ashore.
<br><br>
Only then did Zen understand why those fish looked so strange. Their huge heads continuously shrank and their bodies began to elongate. They retained the fangs in their mouths, and they became the wolves.
<br><br>
He was suddenly enlightened as he thought of what the Snake Goddess had said earlier. He asked, "Do they belong to the Celestial Wolf race?"
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess nodded and explained, "The Celestial Wolf race was the designated one, and they were the first creatures to be born. According to the past rules, all the other creatures in this primitive land were nothing more than food for the Celestial Wolf race..."
<br><br>
It was true that the designated race had been at the top of the food chain from the very beginning! As long as they were given enough time, they would become a ruling force sooner or later.
<br><br>
On the contrary, the creatures that were born in this round of chaos could only serve as the vassals of the Celestial Wolf race.
<br><br>
This fate was determined from the reopening of the chaos. "Since the Celestial Wolf race had such a great advantage, how did they end up like today?" asked Zen.
<br><br>
In present times, the Celestial Wolf race was considered as an insignificant race.
<br><br>
Even the Oneness Sky Palace could destroy them easily, let alone the Separate Abyss race, the Bearing race, or the other super forces.
<br><br>
"Because they were in conflict with each other," the Snake Goddess calmly answered.
<br><br>
"They? Who are they?" Zen asked curiously. The Snake Goddess shook her head.
<br><br>
"We don't know. Maybe 'they" refers to the Instant Civilization, or maybe not. I've been suspicious about things that haven't been proven to exist," she said and sighed.
<br><br>
The Instant Civilization was widely recognized as the first civilization, which was the beginning of the chaos. It was difficult to understand and imagine.
<br><br>
Yet, nobody had ever seen or known about this civilization...
<br><br>
For such a kind of civilization, the Snake Goddess usually thought that it didn't exist.
<br><br>
"I only know that they designated the Celestial Wolf race, but there have been conflicts within them, and they must be very disappointed in the Finale Way. After many rounds of civilizations and Finale Ways, we are now in the 1, 447th civilization and the 1, 447th chaos.
<br><br>
Since they have wasted too much time, some of them got impatient and opened another passageway..." said the Snake Goddess as she looked at the continent.
<br><br>
The continent was lush and filled with all kinds of creatures, but most of them belonged to the Celestial Wolf race which grew prosperous according to the original plan.
<br><br>
Suddenly, different colored light dots, such as black, white, red, and so on, filled the sky.
<br><br>
"They are the seeds of life. It's the races hiding on the Other Shore that scattered them everywhere through that passageway," said the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
The races on the Other Shore had always been interfering in the development of chaos, but their interference was limited. The intervention that could've happened at the greatest extent might be the Civilization Artifacts.
<br><br>
It was different this time, however.
<br><br>
At that point, they threw the members of their races into the real world.
<br><br>
Then, seeds of life fell onto the ground, took root, and sprouted.
<br><br>
There were Separate Abyss race, Moon Spirit race, Ear Mouse race, Sun Crow race, Cracked Earth race who were covered with poison and so on.
<br><br>
"There has never been a chaos which contains so many races..." the Snake Goddess commented. Zen simply nodded in response.
<br><br>
These races had had a brilliant history and had been a ruling civilization in the past.
<br><br>
Overall, they almost had the same potentials as each other.
<br><br>
But, it wasn't until trillions of years of development that many of the super forces stood up to each other as equals.
<br><br>
A small mountain slowly appeared in the illusion, and some white light dots fell upon it. One of the light dots gradually grew bigger and turned into a light cocoon of a few feet high. Afterwards, a naked woman with a snake tail walked out of the light cocoon.
<br><br>
The woman with a snake tail looked exactly the same as the Snake Goddess, but she had no cultivation base at all. She was just an ordinary being. Her memories were blurry, which made her look puzzled.
<br><br>
Naturally, both Zen and Yan felt a little embarrassed at the sight of this woman.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess told them in a calm voice, "I am the first member of the Snake Goddess race to be born in this round of chaos, and Fuxi is the first human being."
<br><br>
Chapter 3487 The Enemy As soon as the Snake Goddess walked out of the cocoon, another cocoon broke open as well. Fuxi emerged and nimbly walked out of it.
<br><br>
Now, he looked exactly like an ordinary human man.
<br><br>
In Zen's eyes, the Snake Goddess race was not a human race, and they were simply related to the humans.
<br><br>
So, why did the Snake Goddess descend with those white spots? Zen thought that it might be too impolite of him if he asked her about it directly, so he swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue.
<br><br>
"Fuxi and I had many memories after we came to this world. We knew how to make pottery ware, weave webs, catch fishes..." the Snake Goddess continued.
<br><br>
In time, the humans began to flourish rapidly around that small mountain.
<br><br>
The memories in their minds had made a crucial contribution to the fact that they could master these skills in a short time.
<br><br>
"Have you thought of something? For example, the Lord of Weapons..." the Snake Goddess reminded. At that moment, Zen's eyes flashed.
<br><br>
Chiyou was known as the Lord of Weapons, because he invented the sword, spear, halberd, armor, crossbow… "These inventions..." said Zen hesitantly.
<br><br>
"They are the memories given by the humans on the Other Shore," the Snake Goddess explained. What King Manard had said was verified with the evolution of illusions.
<br><br>
Generally speaking, it was very difficult for the races that had entered the Other Shore to return to the chaos.
<br><br>
If the humans had appeared in the chaos, it meant that the humans on the Other Shore had already begun to take action.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and Chiyou were the seeds sowed by the humans on the Other Shore "So, you, the Human Sovereign, and even my grandfather represent the humans on the Other Shore. Are you their spokespersons?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"No. It's not that simple," replied the Snake Goddess as she shook her head.
<br><br>
The humans on the Other Shore were well prepared, as they had given all the memories that the humans in the chaos should know. The only thing was, the humans in the chaos didn't know where they came from, what was their goal, or anything about the humans on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In any case, thanks to those memories, several human forces had advanced rapidly.
<br><br>
For instance, the small Pear Hill which had descended in the very beginning had developed alongside the growth of the primitive land. When the primitive land became as large as it was today, the Pear Hill had expanded to the size of a big province.
<br><br>
"The most mystical thing is," said the Snake Goddess with an ironic expression, "I know about the existence of the humans on the Other Shore, and I also know that they created us, but we still can't find them."
<br><br>
Of course, not all races were the same.
<br><br>
For example, after the Separate Abyss race had gotten increasingly stronger, they quickly found their home on the Other Shore, the Abyss Spirit race.
<br><br>
The latter had even helped them take over the entire Stage Eleven.
<br><br>
The human forces, including the Nine Li race, the Pear Hill, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race, however, hadn't found their own home on the Other Shore yet.
<br><br>
"Now you can tell me how you mastered the void construction and the Truth of Godly Way," the Snake Goddess requested while she waved her hand. The illusions in front of Zen and Yan immediately collapsed and turned into a thick white mist.
<br><br>
Zen nodded and said, "Can I ask another question?"
<br><br>
"Please go ahead."
<br><br>
"Since the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race also came from the human race on the Other Shore, why did they choose a different path?" he asked. The humans on the Other Shore had created the Pear Hill, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Nine Li race, and the Oneness Sky Palace.
<br><br>
Why were there conflicts between them in the end? The answer to his question was rather easy. The Snake Goddess thought for a while and then explained, "Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer have doubts about the existence of the humans on the Other Shore. Furthermore, the supreme masters of these two races have each become the spokespersons for other civilizations, and the civilizations that they represent have joined the Blood Assembly on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
You know, the Blood Assembly is a strong force, and they are also our enemy." "The Blood Assembly?" Zen asked as his eyebrows shot up in curiosity.
<br><br>
Back when he had tried to help Elvinia erase the memories of that pig-faced monster called Teague, Teague had mentioned the Blood Assembly before he was finally driven out from Elvinia's body.
<br><br>
It seemed that the Blood Assembly on the Other Shore had pushed those pig-faced monsters to Stage Thirteen.
<br><br>
"It is a force formed by many races on the Other Shore," the Snake Goddess answered.
<br><br>
Zen just nodded once more. He now had a rough idea.
<br><br>
The intricate and complex forces on the Other Shore were born in more than a thousand chaotic eras of the chaos.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Zen still couldn't get any news about the human race on the Other Shore. They were so mysterious that even the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were unable to find them.
<br><br>
After he had digested the information the Snake Goddess had given him, he said, "This is the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. It's connected with another Other Shore."
<br><br>
"Another Other Shore? There is another Other Shore?"
<br><br>
Even though the Snake Goddess had almost omnipotent wisdom, she was still shocked upon hearing what Zen had said.
<br><br>
As far as she knew, such a thing was impossible.
<br><br>
Then again, she could sense the fluctuation in Zen's consciousness.
<br><br>
Although she didn't read it, she could easily tell that he wasn't lying.
<br><br>
"Yes," Zen replied with a nod.
<br><br>
"Are the humans on the Other Shore hiding in that Other Shore?" At that point, the Snake Goddess had thought of the humans on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Zen shook his head. "There are only ten-odd people on that Other Shore.
<br><br>
Strictly speaking, they are not creatures of the Other Shore.
<br><br>
In addition, they asked me to help look for the humans from the 77th civilization on our Other Shore," he explained. "But how did you go to that Other Shore?" the Snake Goddess asked in confusion.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Yan stood by the side and quietly listened to her brother's words, her eyes wide with surprise. Not even the Human Sovereign could make the Snake Goddess look like that! "Back when I was in the Chaotic Source World, I had fought against Mount.
<br><br>
He exiled me to that space," said Zen.
<br><br>
"That is Othniel's truth-level theurgy. That space should belong to Othniel.
<br><br>
How could it be another Other Shore?" the Snake Goddess asked again. The information Zen was giving still perplexed her.
<br><br>
She had already heard that Mount had exiled Zen. She was originally a little curious as to how Zen had returned, because all things considered, it was impossible for him to return after he was exiled.
<br><br>
"There is a human in that space who said his name was King Manard. He came from the 77th civilization, and he has been hiding there until now. He has completely controlled that space and transformed it into another Other Shore.
<br><br>
He taught me the Truth of Three-Energy Construction," Zen stated.
<br><br>
Upon hearing those words, the Snake Goddess couldn't keep calm anymore.
<br><br>
The 77th civilization had left a lot of traces in the Three Purities Stage on the Other Shore, but no one had ever met any of them.
<br><br>
She never thought that Zen would've found a human from the 77th civilization in that way! "Even if King Manard can live in that space, how did he find the Truth of Three-Energy Construction?" the Snake Goddess asked.
<br><br>
The answer Zen gave shocked her greatly once again. "He found it from outside of the chaos," he said.
<br><br>
Chapter 3488 The Wrong Goal Zen's voice was not loud, but what he said came as a shock to the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
It was too much for her.
<br><br>
While Zen could probably fabricate a story about the second Other Shore, she believed the part about the void construction of the Truth of ThreeEnergy Construction.
<br><br>
"Outside the chaos? What is outside the chaos?" The Snake Goddess stared at Zen intently, like a child hungry for knowledge.
<br><br>
"Well..." Zen hesitated slightly.
<br><br>
"Can't you tell me?" Noticing Zen's hesitation, the Snake Goddess couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.
<br><br>
"I can." Zen smiled. King Manard didn't give Zen too many restrictions. His only request was to help him find the humans on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Moreover, Zen thought it wouldn't hurt to inform the Snake Goddess. "The world outside the chaos is very unique. There, the shapes of all materials are different... It's hard to describe..."
<br><br>
Zen did his best to describe the scene engraved in his memory.
<br><br>
Although the description was not, in his opinion, exactly accurate, the Snake Goddess still lapped up everything he said. Even Yan, who was standing next to her, listened attentively to her brother's story.
<br><br>
By the time Zen finished speaking, the Snake Goddess seemed to want to say something.
<br><br>
However, a voice interrupted her. "Since you said that space is another Other Shore, can one go there with the Truth of Three-Energy Construction?"
<br><br>
A burly figure appeared on the jadeite platform. It was Fuxi.
<br><br>
"Ah, you were eavesdropping!" Yan said accusingly.
<br><br>
"Eavesdropping? What do you mean by that?" Fuxi chuckled. "I've been here this whole time."
<br><br>
It was clear that Fuxi had heard every word that had come out of Zen's mouth just now. He too was curious about that space and the world outside the chaos, so he couldn't help but reveal himself.
<br><br>
Zen, contrary to his sister's reaction, smiled calmly at Fuxi. "Yes. With the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, we can go there."
<br><br>
"With the soul or body?" Fuxi asked, eyebrow raised.
<br><br>
"I don't know that either." Zen was baffled by this question.
<br><br>
Since returning from that space, he had never tried going back to it.
<br><br>
It was impossible to enter the Other Shore with the Truth of Powerful Holy Body or the corporeal body. That space, on the other hand, was an Other Shore built by King Manard, so there should be no such restriction.
<br><br>
"So, what price do I have to pay for getting the Truth of Three-Energy Construction?" Fuxi asked, taking a step forward.
<br><br>
He and the Snake Goddess had been searching for the humans on the Other Shore for countless years. King Manard was the first one they had ever heard of. Of course, he wanted to see him.
<br><br>
But the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was in Zen's hands. They naturally wouldn't force him to give it.
<br><br>
"Price?" Zen's eyes narrowed.
<br><br>
He didn't intend to get anything by giving the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. But he had never forgotten his mission, also Chiyou's last will, to rebuild the Nine Li race.
<br><br>
He had asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi to give him a promise by offering him the Truth Enlightenment, but now, the Oneness Sky Palace was still being suppressed by the Bearing race. Especially after his identity was exposed, it was still uncertain what lengths the Bearing race would go to.
<br><br>
With only the Oneness Sky Palace, he might find it difficult to fight against super forces such as the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race.
<br><br>
Since the Human Sovereign said so...
<br><br>
"I have one request," Zen said slowly. "I want you to help me rebuild the Nine Li race."
<br><br>
Yan stared at her brother, dumbfounded.
<br><br>
She had been living blissfully in the Pear Hill this whole time, but she knew her brother bore a heavy burden.
<br><br>
Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's expressions remained unchanged. They knew Zen's background, and had predicted he would make such a request.
<br><br>
Expectantly eyeing the two supreme masters before him, Zen maintained his calm disposition. He had a feeling they would accept his request.
<br><br>
"I can't make any promises," the Snake Goddess said bluntly.
<br><br>
"Why not?" Zen was surprised.
<br><br>
"Because we can't help you do what you want," answered the Snake Goddess, casting a glance downward. Unsure how to console Zen, she couldn't look him in the eye at this time.
<br><br>
"But..." Zen was puzzled. "If you join forces with the Oneness Sky Palace, it's possible!"
<br><br>
Seeing Zen's anxious expression, the Snake Goddess smiled gently. "Have you ever thought about the process of rebuilding the Nine Li race? Gather all the remaining members of the Nine Li race and multiply. Then, a strong warrior from it would lead the Nine Li race to become one of the super forces in the Source World. Is that what you want?"
<br><br>
Zen stared at her blankly. He was speechless.
<br><br>
"The Chaotic Source World is gone," said the Snake Goddess, her eyes shining brightly. "From here on out, it will be impossible to cultivate a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm. You secretly took crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits from the Chaotic Source World. After giving one portion of them to the head of the Rose Sect, you have only nine left. Do you intend to cultivate the Nine Li people with these crystals?"
<br><br>
It was impossible to bring the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits out of the Chaotic Source World. The Pear Hill was very clear that Zen had taken out two thousand.
<br><br>
Zen fell silent, his mind whirling.
<br><br>
He had always envisioned rebuilding the Nine Li race, but only now did he realize he never really thought about the steps to get there.
<br><br>
Taking the threshold of the Chaotic Source Realm into consideration, there was really no way he could achieve his goal.
<br><br>
"Snake Goddess, is there really no hope of rebuilding the Nine Li race?"
<br><br>
Yan asked, blinking. Disappointment was written all over her face.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess walked over to Yan and threw her arms around her in a warm hug. Seeing Yan as her own daughter, she was fond of the girl. "There is hope, but your brother has mistaken the order."
<br><br>
"What order?" Yan asked confusedly.
<br><br>
"It's meaningless to rebuild the Nine Li race if the Finale Way is not completed," the Snake Goddess answered. "The chaos will be destroyed.
<br><br>
And all the humans, including those from the Pear Hill, the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race, will perish." Turning to face Zen, she continued explaining to Yan, "But if your brother completes the Finale Way, it will be much easier to rebuild the Nine Li race, right?"
<br><br>
Upon returning to Pear Hill, Fuxi had filled the Snake Goddess in on all the details about what happened at the bottom of the chaos. She was keenly aware that Zen was selected by Gerald.
<br><br>
Contrary to the aggrieved Fuxi at the time, the Snake Goddess's reaction was quite calm.
<br><br>
She did not know why Zen was chosen by Gerald, but as one of the six Chaos Ancient Gods, Gerald undoubtedly should have unique insight.
<br><br>
Perhaps Zen could really complete the Finale Way and become the supreme Finale Hero in the chaos.
<br><br>
"Do you know your goal now?" Fuxi asked viciously.
<br><br>
When he left that prison, Fuxi had felt so indignant. He thought Gerald was blind to have chosen Zen.
<br><br>
However, when he met Zen again in the Chaotic Source World, Zen had completely changed. He had rapidly improved.
<br><br>
At least, Zen's performance had convinced Fuxi and made him certain of what he believed in.
<br><br>
Chapter 3489 Peculiar Seeds The first time that Zen had heard of the Finale Hero, it was from Fuxi's mouth.
<br><br>
Fuxi had been in his lunatic phase at the time and Zen had had no idea what it had meant. No. 9527 hadn't explained it to him either.
<br><br>
It was not until Athemar had told him about the Finale Way while in the Mountain Viewing Province, that he had finally understood what it was about.
<br><br>
But there were things in the world that he'd find difficult to take on as goals even if he understood what they were.
<br><br>
There had been a number of civilizations that had pursued the Finale Way in the past. But it was a goal that even a whole civilization had failed to achieve despite summoning all their powers. Zen had never dreamed that his strength could be on par with that of a whole civilization.
<br><br>
At this moment, a soul fluctuation emanated from the sclerite in Zen's chest.
<br><br>
No. 9527 had suddenly turned into a human figure and was now standing beside Zen.
<br><br>
Fuxi and the Snake Goddess didn't flinch when the human-shaped soul appeared so suddenly.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had already sensed its existence, and Fuxi had communicated with No. 9527 at the bottom of the chaos.
<br><br>
No. 9527 folded its hands in respect towards Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
No. 9527 was usually pretty casual when communicating with Zen. But it regarded the top masters in the Source World as its peers. It hadn't cared about its manners even when it had met Chiyou in the divine land.
<br><br>
"We meet again," said Fuxi as he returned No. 9527's salute. "I didn't expect you to still be in this man's body."
<br><br>
"I will accompany and assist him as he grows in his strength. I won't leave until he becomes strong enough," No. 9527 answered.
<br><br>
When a soul fragment was separated from the main soul for too long, the connection between it and its master grew more distant with time.
<br><br>
In the beginning, No. 9527 had only assisted Zen when it thought it was necessary.
<br><br>
But as they began to communicate more deeply with each other, No. 9527 gradually formed its own self-consciousness and began to have its own characters. It began to care more about Zen.
<br><br>
"It looks like you've done a good job of assisting him," Fuxi said, voice dripping with jealousy. He had attributed Zen's rapid progress in cultivation to No. 9527's assistance.
<br><br>
"My help didn't really matter. Zen was able to achieve all of this with his own efforts," No. 9527 said, shaking its head. "I actually wanted to ask for something from you. For Zen."
<br><br>
"Ask for something?" Zen was stunned.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess looked askance at No. 9527. "What do you want from us?"
<br><br>
"A Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed," No. 9527 replied.
<br><br>
Yan's and Zen's eyes narrowed at this.
<br><br>
The two of them had been born from the blood sealed within this kind of seeds, but they didn't exactly know what it was. What was No. 9527 doing by asking for it? The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed mischievously. She said, "The Bloodstoring Tree hasn't bloomed for a long time. Even the last Six-Pattern Blood-storing Fruit has hung on the tree for a long time. The entire Pear Hill has only one Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. Why do you think you can ask for it?"
<br><br>
There was only one Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree in the entire Source World.
<br><br>
"Because Zen needs it. And he can exchange the Truth of Three-Energy Construction for it," No. 9527 said calmly.
<br><br>
Zen was confused "Of what use is the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed to me?"
<br><br>
No. 9527 looked at Zen, a faint smile playing on its face. "You had previously thought of using the Blood Upgrading Pill of the Origin Mountain to upgrade my master's blood in your body. Rumors in the Oneness Sky Palace have it that the Blood Upgrading Pill has magical power, but it is impossible to upgrade my master's blood using the pill."
<br><br>
"Can the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed upgrade your master's blood?" Zen asked.
<br><br>
"In the whole chaos, only the seeds from this tree can perfectly copy bloodlines. Am I right?" No. 9527 said, smiling as it faced Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
When the Pear Hill had risen, this tree had started to break free from ground and grown on the Pear Hill.
<br><br>
The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds that grew on the tree were rare treasures in the Source World.
<br><br>
A Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed could pass down a bloodline perfectly.
<br><br>
Many powerful masters in the Source World had their own bloodlines, but their descendants were often unable to completely inherit their bloodlines.
<br><br>
There were a few special elixirs like the Blood Upgrading Pill of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Heavenly Blood Pill of the Divine Farmer race that could upgrade their bloodlines. But the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed remained the most magical of them all.
<br><br>
Such seeds could completely pass down the bloodline one carried.
<br><br>
Since ancient times, there had been many powerful masters who had come to the Pear Hill to ask for the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds.
<br><br>
Even King Ieuan of the Ear Mice had brought a huge amount of resources here in exchange for a Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. No superpower could reject the wealth that the Ear Mice offered for their resources.
<br><br>
But the Pear Hill had refused them.
<br><br>
They had never given their treasures to anyone else.
<br><br>
The two Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds that had been used on Yan and Zen were exceptions. It was the only time that the seeds had been used on outsiders.
<br><br>
A glimmer of hesitation appeared on the Snake Goddess's face. "Excuse me. Let me discuss this with Fuxi," she said.
<br><br>
With a slight wave of her hand, the two of them disappeared from before Zen and Yan.
<br><br>
No. 9527 was stunned. It hadn't expected the Snake Goddess to be so cautious about its request. It was just a seed that could pass down the bloodline! Once the Snake Goddess had pulled Fuxi to a space where Zen couldn't hear them, she said, "What do you think, Fuxi?"
<br><br>
Fuxi acted like he didn't really care. "He had used one before. What's the big deal if we give him another one?"
<br><br>
"But it will be the last Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. Do you think there's something important hidden in it?" The Snake Goddess looked hesitant.
<br><br>
The Pear Hill cherished the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds so much because there were secrets hidden in them.
<br><br>
This Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree had been born at almost the same time as Fuxi and the Snake Goddess. It was a tree that the human race had originally planted on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree would bloom once every thirty million years. Another thirty million years later, the tree would bear a fruit. And another thirty million years later, the fruit would mature. This fruit would have a Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed within it.
<br><br>
To perfectly pass down bloodlines was just one of the functions of the SixPattern Blood-storing Seeds.
<br><br>
What made the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds really important were the things that were hidden inside them.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess had discovered the Grand World Cultivation Method from one of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds.
<br><br>
The crystals produced by the Chaotic Source Spirits after they came to the Source World could help the warriors at the Other Shore Realm step into the Chaotic Source Realm. This secret had also been carried by a SixPattern Blood-storing Seed.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess believed that this Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree was a method the human race on the Other Shore used to communicate with her.
<br><br>
They sealed what they needed her to know into the tree and in this way, passed it to her.
<br><br>
This was why the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds were never given to outsiders.
<br><br>
At the time, a Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed that had been placed in Yan's body had copied the bloodline of the Snake Goddess. And then an Energy Shaft formed in her body.
<br><br>
"Don't you know how many Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds we have devoured over the years?" Fuxi shook his head and said, "The information that some of the seeds contained is ridiculous. Apart from the one that Yan inherited, all others are basically useless. And you're still expecting the last one to produce a miracle?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3490 Deliver The Snake Goddess frowned. She had always placed her hopes on the SixPattern Blood-storing Tree.
<br><br>
She was under the impression that the humans on the Other Shore would hide the information about them in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds. So she was hoping to find information from the seeds.
<br><br>
But it just turned out to be a disappointment.
<br><br>
Fuxi continued, "Perhaps we have to resign ourselves to fate. Zen found King Manard. Since he asked for it, we can give him the last seed."
<br><br>
After a moment's silence, the Snake Goddess nodded and waved her hand.
<br><br>
The two of them returned to the jadeite platform again.
<br><br>
Shooting a glance at Zen, she gestured towards him. "Follow me."
<br><br>
It seemed that she had agreed.
<br><br>
With a wave, No. 9527 returned to Zen's body.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess waved her hand once more, and she and Zen had disappeared from the jadeite platform.
<br><br>
The next thing he knew, Zen was in a cave.
<br><br>
It was practically pitch black. He could, however, hear the sounds of dripping water off the walls.
<br><br>
"This is the internal space of the Pear Hill?" Zen guessed.
<br><br>
"It's the innermost part of the Pear Hill," the Snake Goddess answered. She started walking.
<br><br>
As she walked forward, dim lights would appear around the cave. It was some complex magic arrays that emitted the glow.
<br><br>
Although these magic arrays had not been activated, they embodied terrifying abilities. Obviously, this was the most important place of the Pear Hill, since it was so heavily guarded.
<br><br>
After walking more than two hundred feet, they reached the end of the cave.
<br><br>
Zen glanced around. He noticed the soil here was white, and towards the end of the cave stood a tree as tall as a person.
<br><br>
"Is this the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree?"
<br><br>
Zen stared at the tree in surprise.
<br><br>
The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree was invaluable to the Pear Hill. It was not necessarily as tall and intimidating as the divine trees in the divine land, but it should be full of vitality.
<br><br>
However, to Zen's surprise, it had signs of decaying from its roots, and its naked branches were almost completely devoid of leaves. The few leaves it did have had already turned yellow. If it weren't for a single light green fruit on it, Zen would've thought it was already dead.
<br><br>
"Its life is coming to an end," said the Snake Goddess, staring at the SixPattern Blood-storing Tree sadly.
<br><br>
This tree was a channel that she had used to communicate with the humans on the Other Shore. With the withering of this tree, it wouldn't be able to do so anymore. Now, there was only one fruit left.
<br><br>
She walked forward and gingerly plucked the single fruit. Gently, she peeled off the outer shell, revealing a seed that glowed a bright blue. She took a moment to look at it longingly, but then ultimately turned to Zen and said, "Pour your blood power into it and it can work."
<br><br>
As she spoke, she handed the seed to Zen.
<br><br>
Zen took the seed gratefully and inspected it. After he tucked it into his space ring, the Snake Goddess waved her hand, and they both appeared on the jadeite platform again.
<br><br>
Since he had received the seed, Zen fulfilled his end of the deal and wrote down the Truth of Three-Energy Construction word by word.
<br><br>
As he handed over the complete Truth of Three-Energy Construction to the Snake Goddess, Zen suddenly recalled something important. "Snake Goddess, after you master the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, please pay attention to one thing."
<br><br>
"What's it?" asked the Snake Goddess curiously.
<br><br>
"King Manard extremely hates any race that isn't human. If a human enters that space, it'd be fine. But if any other race enters, they'd probably be attacked," Zen explained.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was born together with the Human Sovereign. She must have a lot of connections with the humans on the Other Shore, but King Manard might not know about this.
<br><br>
Although the little monsters probably wouldn't be able to lay a finger on the Snake Goddess, King Manard's strength was immeasurable. If the two fought in that space, who knew what might happen? However, Zen had spent about three months in that space before he was able to master the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.
<br><br>
Although the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were highly talented, it would probably take them some time, too.
<br><br>
If Zen returned to that space to inform King Manard before the Snake Goddess and Fuxi entered, there would be less room for misunderstandings.
<br><br>
Just then, a thought crossed Fuxi's mind. As he stretched out his palm, a golden red crystal appeared in his hand.
<br><br>
This golden red crystal had come from the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits. Zen had given thirty of them to Yan when he left the Chaotic Source World. Yan didn't know what they were used for, so she had given one to Fuxi.
<br><br>
It was also the first time for Fuxi to see such a crystal. According to his judgment, the crystal was very similar to the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits. He was certain people could absorb it.
<br><br>
But he still hadn't figured out how to refine it.
<br><br>
"Zen, it would be best if you stay in the Pear Hill," the Snake Goddess said authoritatively. "Once Fuxi figures it out, you can immediately cultivate."
<br><br>
Yan glanced at her brother eagerly, her eyes twinkling. Of course, she hoped to spend time with him.
<br><br>
But to her disappointment, Zen politely shook his head.
<br><br>
Lavender, Letitia and the others had already settled down in the Oneness Sky Palace. Even Zen felt like he had already taken root there as well.
<br><br>
Moreover, the Oneness Sky Palace was a decent sect of swordsmanship, which was a more suitable place for Zen to cultivate.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, outside the Source World, a massive chaos cloud was constantly rolling.
<br><br>
In the midst of flashing lightning, a huge figure flew in the sky. It was none other than the Thunder Dimorphodon! Whoosh! Its gigantic body moved blithely, quickly drawing closer to the chaos cloud in the distance.
<br><br>
After it entered the chaos cloud, it saw a small light spot. The light had a strong penetrating power, and even the chaotic energy was unable to stop it.
<br><br>
Two hours later, the Thunder Dimorphodon finally reached the light spot.
<br><br>
Above the light spot stood a man in an embroidered robe, with an ordinary bamboo basket on his back. With the sleeves rolled up, he looked like a farmer who had been hidden in the mountains.
<br><br>
This man was Divine Farmer, the leader of the Divine Farmer race.
<br><br>
"You got them?" Divine Farmer asked with a smile.
<br><br>
"Yes," said the Thunder Dimorphodon. "But there is a slight problem."
<br><br>
Divine Farmer's smile froze. He knew clearly that the Thunder Dimorphodon seldom encountered problems in its life. "What's the problem?"
<br><br>
"The Black Ship stopped me on the way and took away half of the rings,"
<br><br>
said the Thunder Dimorphodon. With its huge paw gently lifted, small rings of light floated in front of Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer's expression fell. "The Black Ship? Why would they target you? As far as I know, they should not be interested in the Chaotic Source World."
<br><br>
The Black Ship was also known as a super force, despite having only thirteen members. It seldom cultivated disciples and rarely went to the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
"I don't know why they went to the Chaotic Source World either. They had been there since the beginning. I didn't expect to be intercepted by them after I got rid of Fuxi," said the Thunder Dimorphodon through gritted teeth. It was angry at the mention of the Black Ship.
<br><br>
Chapter 3491 The Moon Fire Slave The Thunder Dimorphodon had very few encounters with the Black Ship, each mostly well out of the other's way. This was why the Black Ship's sudden attack had caught the Thunder Dimorphodon off guard.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer heaved a deep sigh. "I see. You are free to go now."
<br><br>
"What about my payment?" the Thunder Dimorphodon asked.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer fixed a blank look at the Thunder Dimorphodon. "Of course I shall pay you. But since you only finished half the job, you also only get half the amount we agreed on."
<br><br>
"You..." The Thunder Dimorphodon growled, its body crackling with lightning.
<br><br>
"I'll just use the other half to buy the rest of the rings from the Black Ship,"
<br><br>
the Divine Farmer added.
<br><br>
There were twelve rings in total, each one an extremely precious treasure.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer just hoped the Black Ship wouldn't know the use of these rings. He was willing to pay any price they asked to get all the remaining rings back.
<br><br>
Shooting the Divine Farmer a dirty look, the Thunder Dimorphodon snorted and then took a step back, curling up its wings.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer took a ring in his hand and studied it carefully.
<br><br>
The ring, in addition to its mysterious aura, didn't look special at all. Could it really help a creature on the Other Shore to descend to the chaos? After examining it for a while, the Divine Farmer recited a quiet chant, a trace of Truth of Godly Way emanating from him.
<br><br>
He closed his eyes and entered the Other Shore with his soul.
<br><br>
Buzz! Arriving at the Other Shore, his soul emerged in a huge red hall.
<br><br>
The hall was magnificent and extravagant. A colossal arch stretching tens of thousands of feet stood in the distance. Beneath the arch lay a huge disc with nine thrones lined along the edge, facing the center.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer walked straight to the center of the disc and stomped his foot lightly.
<br><br>
Numerous red patterns surfaced on the huge disc. A small orb appeared on each of the surrounding thrones.
<br><br>
"I've got the Descending Rings." The Divine Farmer raised his hand, displaying the ring he was holding.
<br><br>
He managed to bring the ring into the Other Shore! At his pronouncement, the orbs on the thrones started to flash with light, thrilled at what they were seeing.
<br><br>
"You brought it to the Other Shore successfully! This is a great development!"
<br><br>
"It is indeed as miraculous as the Chaotic Source Spirits!"
<br><br>
"Our speculations were right!"
<br><br>
The orbs all fixed their gazes on the ring, their voices trembling with excitement as they chattered among themselves.
<br><br>
Once creatures born in the chaos entered the Other Shore with their entire presence, they would be trapped there permanently.
<br><br>
There was no way for them to descend to the chaos unless they became Other Shore Tokens for other creatures.
<br><br>
But what powerful being would be willing to lower themselves by becoming just someone else's tool? The descendants of the Chaotic Source Spirits, however, had managed to find a way around this restriction. These conditions didn't affect them at all! This unusual matter had attracted the attention of the most powerful creatures on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
They realized that perhaps this was the only way for them to return to the chaos! "If this ring can really get us back to the chaos, then all the other problems will be solved. Who would be able to fight against our Blood Assembly? Haha!" The orb in the middle throne burst into laughter. "Moon Fire Slave! Try it!"
<br><br>
At the command, a towering figure appeared behind the huge arch.
<br><br>
It was a giant made of flames. Dark green flames surrounded his enormous body. A sense of brutal strength emanated from him.
<br><br>
With loud strides that shook the entire hall, he walked up to the Divine Farmer and squatted down in front of him.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer tossed the ring at the giant, which dropped gently onto his body. As a smile flashed on the giant's fiery face, he growled and abruptly disappeared from the spot.
<br><br>
"Did he make it?"
<br><br>
"So he left the Other Shore, just like that?"
<br><br>
"You! Go and have a look!"
<br><br>
the orbs on the thrones demanded.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer nodded. He transported himself out of the Other Shore and back into the chaos. He saw the Moon Fire Slave floating not far away from him.
<br><br>
"So this is the chaos. Amazing!" The Moon Fire Slave was the descendant of the ancient Element Spirit Civilization, born on the Other Shore.
<br><br>
Although he had long known that there was a huge world of chaos outside the Other Shore, this was the first time for him to set foot in it.
<br><br>
His ancestors had once ruled over this vast space. Back then, elements had dominion over all. Other creatures of flesh and steel were way too weak compared to the powerful Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
Powerful as they were, however, they had failed to complete the Finale Way, too. Thus, they had no choice but to escape into the Other Shore.
<br><br>
After over one thousand chaotic eras, a descendant of the Element Spirit Civilization had finally returned to this world again! The sudden appearance of the Moon Fire Slave startled the Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
Lightning swirled around its body, forming a net to protect itself. It crouched silently with a terrified look in its one eye.
<br><br>
The Divine Farmer observed the Moon Fire Slave silently.
<br><br>
He exuded nothing but calm.
<br><br>
He knew the truth was the highest law in the chaos. It was not an easy thing to go against the truth and go back to the chaos.
<br><br>
"Old fellow! Show me the way! Take me to the Source World to see the lowly races dwelling in our old land!" the Moon Fire Slave ordered.
<br><br>
There was nothing but the brown chaotic energy in this chaos cloud.
<br><br>
Obviously, this bleak sight wouldn't satisfy the Moon Fire Slave.
<br><br>
Although the Divine Farmer was the leader of a great race, the giant had no respect for him, regarding him as a nobody compared to the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
"There's no need to hurry," replied the Divine Farmer in a calm voice, ignoring the Moon Fire Slave's rude tone.
<br><br>
"No need to hurry?"
<br><br>
Flames of rage gushed out of the giant's huge body. "I'm not asking for your opinion. I am ordering you!" he roared impatiently.
<br><br>
"Ordering me?"
<br><br>
the Divine Farmer asked, his lips curling into a faint smile.
<br><br>
He had indulged the Blood Assembly for many years. It had apparently made these Other Shore creatures more and more arrogant.
<br><br>
"Maybe you should worry about surviving, first," the Divine Farmer pointed out.
<br><br>
"Surviving? What do you mean?"
<br><br>
the Moon Fire Slave asked, truly confused.
<br><br>
He was a fire spirit, the most powerful form of fire creature.
<br><br>
He was simply indestructible unless he was killed in a special way.
<br><br>
Who could threaten his survival in the chaos? Just then, something unusual happened.
<br><br>
The ring on his head flashed with a mysterious light. An invisible force suddenly came crashing down on him.
<br><br>
The force was so strong that he could not put up any resistance at all. The Moon Fire Slave was caught and pushed against the air.
<br><br>
It was as if an invisible wall existed in the space, and the mysterious force was now grabbing the giant and smashing him against it.
<br><br>
Bang! With a horrible sound, the black rock covering the Moon Fire Slave's body melted and was reduced to powder! The green flames spurting out from his body left many long green trails on the invisible wall.
<br><br>
The force was relentless. The Moon Fire Slave was smashed against the wall again and again, until his body was completely destroyed, crushed into shreds.
<br><br>
The Thunder Dimorphodon watched the incredible sight from the sidelines, its eye widening in shock.
<br><br>
The unknown force was terrifying. If it were the Thunder Dimorphodon who had been tortured like that, it would have ended up in a worse state than the Moon Fire Slave! Chapter 3492 Miss Something Divine Farmer's face was expressionless. He stretched out his hand. The ring that was floating in the air, some distance away, flew towards him. He closed his fingers around the ring as it came to rest on his palm. He shook his head and recited the Truth of Godly Way in order to return to the Other Shore.
<br><br>
As soon as he arrived, he was greeted with a series of urgent questions.
<br><br>
"What happened?"
<br><br>
"How is the Moon Fire Slave?"
<br><br>
"Did he make it?"
<br><br>
asked the nine light orbs on the thrones. They were eager to get some answers from Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
The Moon Fire Slave's survival was the most important thing to them.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer sighed. "No. He failed. He was killed by the truth," he said.
<br><br>
The light orbs were aghast. "How could this be?"
<br><br>
"But he succeeded in getting there in the first place!"
<br><br>
"He wasn't supposed to fail!"
<br><br>
Divine Farmer could sense the fury in the light orbs.
<br><br>
They had already succeeded before. How could they have failed at the most critical moment? "It's not that easy to escape the truth," Divine Farmer explained. "It's true that the Moon Fire Slave managed to enter the chaos, but he was quickly detected and killed by the truth rule."
<br><br>
"But how about that huge eye? Why did it survive?" asked the light orb on the second chair from the left.
<br><br>
This question baffled Divine Farmer.
<br><br>
He thought for a while. Slowly he replied, "Maybe it's because that Dreaded Eye Demon was not powerful enough..."
<br><br>
Although the Moon Fire Slave was only a slave of the Element Spirit Civilization, his strength was at a very high level. Most warriors found his strength to be absolutely terrifying.
<br><br>
In contrast, the Dreaded Eye Demon was much weaker.
<br><br>
The light orbs considered Divine Farmer's explanation. "All right, then...
<br><br>
let's try using a weak water spirit," said the light orb in the middle.
<br><br>
A splash sounded as soon as the light orb had spoken.
<br><br>
A wave of water rolled towards them. It halted abruptly in front of Divine Farmer, gathered itself into a human-shaped blue mass and stood up.
<br><br>
It was a creature made of water. Its human shape changed further as it added armor over its body.
<br><br>
Water spirits were at the lowest level of the Element Spirit Civilization.
<br><br>
This creature's strength would definitely be far inferior to that of the Dreaded Eye Demon.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer was still holding the ring in one hand. He stepped closer to the water spirit and gently placed the ring on top of its head. Immediately, Divine Farmer and the water spirit disappeared from the Other Shore.
<br><br>
The light orbs waited, saying nothing. In just a few seconds, Divine Farmer reappeared. He wore a disappointed look on his face. "Another failure. We must be missing something. It wasn't just the ring that allowed the Dreaded Eye Demon to successfully enter the Chaotic Source World."
<br><br>
"What have we missed?" demanded the light orb in the middle. Its tone was harsh.
<br><br>
"We must find out as soon as possible!"
<br><br>
"We will tolerate no further mistakes!" another light orb chimed in.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer stared around at the light orbs and sighed.
<br><br>
He returned once more to the chaos. The Thunder Dimorphodon was waiting not far from where he appeared. Divine Farmer went to the creature and said, "I must ask you something. After the death of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, were there any other things in her body besides the rings?"
<br><br>
"The crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits," replied the Thunder Dimorphodon promptly.
<br><br>
"Anything else besides the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits?" Divine Farmer inquired urgently.
<br><br>
If the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits were the only things in the body, then they had no more clues to work with. It would be impossible to figure out how the creatures on the Other Shore could return to the chaos.
<br><br>
The Thunder Dimorphodon considered Divine Farmer's question, thinking deeply. Suddenly it looked up with a gleam in its eye. "Yes!" it exclaimed.
<br><br>
"What? What else?" Divine Farmer asked quickly.
<br><br>
"There was another kind of crystals in her body. These crystals had similar auras to the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, but they were slightly different. A little thicker. They were golden red crystals," said the Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
It was the Thunder Dimorphodon's mission to bring back the Descending Rings. It was completely focused on this task, and did not bother to take any other things into consideration.
<br><br>
At that time, it had kept its eye on Zen. It hadn't attacked him until he took away all the golden red crystals.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer thought about what Thunder Dimorphodon said, and then his eyes widened as he realized something. Perhaps those golden red crystals were the key.
<br><br>
"Who has those golden red crystals now? Does Mount have them?" he asked.
<br><br>
Divine Farmer had been hiding in the chaos cloud, waiting for the Thunder Dimorphodon. What had happened in the Chaotic Source World was none of his business.
<br><br>
Moreover, it was impossible for any peers and disciples to be worthy opponents for Mount among the many races.
<br><br>
"No," said the Thunder Dimorphodon. "It was a disciple named Zen Luo from the Oneness Sky Palace."
<br><br>
It had been paying close attention to the Chaotic Source World, and kept track of important warriors and taken note of everything happening inside.
<br><br>
"A disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?" Divine Farmer repeated, feeling stunned. "A mere disciple? How is that possible? Where was Mount?"
<br><br>
With a helpless smile on its face, the Thunder Dimorphodon replied, "You mean the avatar of Othniel? He was defeated. This time, two people had both made a world descend in the Chaotic Source World."
<br><br>
Divine Farmer still looked incredulous, so the Thunder Dimorphodon explained everything it had seen. Finally, it ended by saying, "The young man named Zen also has the Soaring Snake Sword."
<br><br>
A fierce light flashed across Divine Farmer's eyes. He was shocked at the events described by the Thunder Dimorphodon, but there was no way it could be mistaken. He said, "This young man might be Chiyou's descendant. He has all the golden red crystals?"
<br><br>
"Yes," said the Thunder Dimorphodon.
<br><br>
"Understood," Divine Farmer said.
<br><br>
The Nine Li race had already been destroyed.
<br><br>
Even if there were still some remaining members hiding somewhere within the Source World, there was nothing to be feared from them.
<br><br>
However, Divine Farmer never expected that someone from the Nine Li race would appear out of nowhere and obtain the most precious treasure of all.
<br><br>
"So, the Oneness Sky Palace has a powerful disciple... It looks like something is up in that place," Divine Farmer said to himself. There was a gleam of coldness in his eyes.
<br><br>
Fuxi had been staying on the jadeite platform for the past few days.
<br><br>
He stood silently, and flipped his hand. Instantly, complex runes spread out across the surface of the jadeite platform. These runes bore a strong resemblance to the magic arrays of the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
A buzzing sound filled the air.
<br><br>
The golden red crystal rose into the air and floated in a circle around him.
<br><br>
"Refine!" he said.
<br><br>
The power of the magic array under his feet was over ten times stronger than that of the magic arrays in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
All the lights dancing along the lines of the magic array gathered on the surface of the golden red crystal.
<br><br>
As the minutes passed, the lights dimmed, and then vanished.
<br><br>
Fuxi examined the golden red crystal. It was exactly the same as it had been before refining.
<br><br>
He was taken aback. "What the hell is this crystal?" he murmured to himself.
<br><br>
The power of this magic array was immense. Even something a hundred times stronger than a crystal could be melted by this array. However, this golden red crystal had somehow remained intact.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Snake Goddess appeared on the jadeite platform again.
<br><br>
She saw him holding the golden red crystal and asked, "Have you refined it yet?"
<br><br>
Fuxi studied the golden red crystal intently. "This crystal is very strange. It doesn't seem very dense or solid. Yet it can withstand the power of this array in the process of refining. It simply refuses to melt."
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess was intrigued. "Let me try," she requested, holding out her hand. Fuxi gave her the golden red crystal.
<br><br>
Instead of using the magic array arranged by Fuxi, she directly activated the energy beams of her shadow. Crimson energy beams flowed out, twining around the golden red crystal and burrowing into its surface.
<br><br>
Fuxi watched closely.
<br><br>
The shadow of Snake Goddess had an astonishing energy. There was probably nothing in the Source World that could resist the direct impact of her energy beams.
<br><br>
As before, the golden red crystal was entirely enveloped for several minutes in the glowing red light. But as the light dimmed, the golden red crystal was revealed to be intact and unchanged in the palm of the Snake Goddess.
<br><br>
She raised an eyebrow, looking astonished. "This crystal seems to be immune to being melted by energy, no matter how powerful. What's going on?"
<br><br>
Chapter 3493 Rules Of The Land of Sword Grief The Snake Goddess gasped. She had never seen something like this happen before.
<br><br>
If she used this golden red crystal to forge a body protection weapon, would this make her practically invincible? Her tender fingers gently caressed the crystal. Then, from her fingertips burst out five thousand divine megatons of force.
<br><br>
"Click!"
<br><br>
With a crisp sound, the crystal had broken into two halves.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess and Fuxi frowned. Both were evidently perplexed.
<br><br>
"That's weird. This crystal couldn't take the power exerted on it, yet it can avoid the attack of energy... How is that helpful?" The Snake Goddess furrowed her brows, puzzled.
<br><br>
Staring at the two pieces of the golden red crystal, Fuxi shook his head.
<br><br>
"Maybe this is not for body refining."
<br><br>
"You mean it has something to do with descending?" The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed with understanding. "Yes, this is possible..."
<br><br>
"Zen has a lot of these crystals. Do you want to take them back first?" Fuxi asked.
<br><br>
The Snake Goddess shook her head. "Let him keep them first. Our most pressing issue is the loss of the Descending Rings to the Thunder Dimorphodon."
<br><br>
At the mention of the Thunder Dimorphodon, Fuxi's eyes flashed with a hint of killing intent.
<br><br>
While the top ten ancient beasts were quite famous for their strength and prowess, Fuxi was confident he could kill the Thunder Dimorphodon, given the chance.
<br><br>
Because the Thunder Dimorphodon had dared to steal the rings right under his nose, Fuxi vowed to never let it go unpunished.
<br><br>
After staying at the Pear Hill for seven days, the flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace finally left.
<br><br>
In case of any emergency, the Pear Hill sent two masters to escort the flying ships back to the Bloom Divine Province.
<br><br>
After the seven flying ships arrived at the Bloom Divine Province, Zen took the time to rest well at the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
Sally, Hutton and other members of the Nine Li race were also arranged to stay at the Flow Sword Sect as they waited for Ambrose.
<br><br>
Happy her husband finally returned, Letitia pounced into his arms. She stayed by his side to hear him talk about what he'd just been through at the Chaotic Source World. When Zen got to the part about the fight with the Evil God, she felt her heart pump faster.
<br><br>
She never expected that the man that had been kneeling before Zen in his inner world would have caused so much trouble.
<br><br>
Margaret wrinkled her nose at Zen's story. "He is such an ungrateful fellow! Why don't you just kill him?"
<br><br>
Zen smiled, but said nothing.
<br><br>
The Evil God had gotten involved with too many things. Zen needed more time to figure out how to deal with him.
<br><br>
Upon the return of Zen, Milo and others, the other disciples of the Flow Sword Sect looked at them with a new light.
<br><br>
According to the rules of the Oneness Sky Palace, any member who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm was no longer an ordinary disciple, but was considered a member of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
They differed from the ordinary disciples, from cultivation base to identity.
<br><br>
In the past few days, Zen hadn't gone to the Other Shore. Instead, he kept throwing divine crystals into the Civilization Artifact and called out several Regal Jade statues to temper himself.
<br><br>
The Truth of Godly Way, glowing with golden light, integrated with his body in continuous refinement. The spots of light from the Chaotic Source Spirits were constantly nourished thanks to this. Consequently, these spots of light grew at an astonishing speed.
<br><br>
Just like Zen, other warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm also tried to strengthen the light spots within their bodies. However, the only effective method to strengthen the Chaotic Source Spirits was continuous import of the Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
This was a slow and time-consuming process. It usually took a warrior years of efforts to gain some progress. No one's speed could compare to Zen's.
<br><br>
A few days later, this group of disciples who just reached the Chaotic Source Realm gathered at the junction of the Origin Mountain and Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
In front of the junction was a huge, bronze palace, consisting of three floors.
<br><br>
The terrace on the first floor of the palace was filled with disciples from the Land of Sword Grief, who were at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
The Chaotic Source Realm was an extremely crucial threshold, and only after passing through it would one be able to go any further.
<br><br>
The backbone of any great sect, great force, or any clan was made up of strong warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm. Super forces like the Oneness Sky Palace focused on training such warriors.
<br><br>
For example, the Bearing race would send all its members at the Chaotic Source Realm to the Sky Guard Pavilion. As for the Oneness Sky Palace, it was the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
The disciples standing in the bronze palace turned to glance at the group who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
"The Land of Sword Grief will receive its new members today," said a long haired man, who was standing on the first floor of the bronze palace.
<br><br>
"We'll need to share some resources from the Land of Sword Grief with them, alas!" A fat man beside the long-haired man sighed loudly.
<br><br>
"They are just new comers. How many resources can they take?" a short middle-aged man whined.
<br><br>
Most of the cultivators in the bronze palace had reached the Chaotic Source Realm years ago.
<br><br>
They were not strong enough like Athemar, so most of them were still cultivating in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
Upon the group's return from the Chaotic Source World, Athemar had ordered these disciples to keep their mouths shut about what had taken place in the Chaotic Source World -- especially the fact that Zen had the Soaring Snake Sword.
<br><br>
Although many leaders from those great races had clearly seen Zen wield the Soaring Snake Sword, Athemar wanted to at least keep it from the rest of the Oneness Sky Palace. This was for Zen's own safety.
<br><br>
This would explain why the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief had no idea what had happened in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
After all the disciples who just reached the Chaotic Source Realm made it to the bronze palace, three people emerged from its massive bronze gates.
<br><br>
The leader of the group was the long-haired man, with a long sword strapped to his back. His eyes flashed fiercely.
<br><br>
The long-haired man looked like a serious fellow. With a curt bow, he said, "Congratulations! All of you have made it to the Chaotic Source Realm, and are thus members of our Land of Sword Grief."
<br><br>
The crowd all bowed respectfully to the man.
<br><br>
"My name is Abdul Fang, from the Bright Mountain."
<br><br>
"Nice to meet you, Abdul."
<br><br>
"I have heard a lot about you..."
<br><br>
… The ones who whispered amongst themselves were actually from the Bright Mountain. Though Abdul Fang ranked at the bottom among the members from the Land of Sword Grief, he was quite famous back in the Bright Mountain.
<br><br>
Abdul Fang just nodded slightly at them, remaining serious-faced.
<br><br>
"However, you should know that before joining the Land of Sword Grief, each of you need to confirm your rankings."
<br><br>
While most of the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace were aware of the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, Zen blinked confusedly.
<br><br>
"Sorry. What do you mean by that?" Zen asked innocently.
<br><br>
Abdul Fang cast a cold glare at Zen, a trace of contempt born in his heart.
<br><br>
Judging from Zen's white clothes, he figured he must be from the Flow Sword Sect. 'How can this kid know nothing about the rules of our Land of Sword Grief?' Chapter 3494 You Are Not Qualified Although Abdul had a contempt for Zen, his expression did not show it. "It can be said that the Land of Sword Grief has gathered most of the resources of the Oneness Sky Palace," he explained patiently. "But these resources are not given to good-for-nothing warriors."
<br><br>
He said 'good-for-nothing warriors' emphatically as if his remarks were aimed at the hundred people in front of him.
<br><br>
Many of them, including Elvinia, frowned after hearing him say this.
<br><br>
Elvinia and Dorothy held high positions in the Oneness Sky Palace, and no one ever dared to speak to them with disrespect up until this moment. They were not pleased.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Abdul didn't care about what anyone thought and how they reacted. He turned around and pointed at the bronze palace. "There are more than 1, 100 people in the Land of Sword Grief." he said bluntly.
<br><br>
"About 30 people on the third floor, 200 on the second floor, and then 900 on the first floor. Each of them possesses their own unique rankings."
<br><br>
"Excuse us, Abdul," a Bright Mountain disciple spoke. "But when you last returned to the Bright Mountain, you were ranked 630th. I wonder how much you've managed to improve since then?" This man was furious, wanting so badly to embarrass him after everything he had said.
<br><br>
Upon hearing this, Abdul smirked and responded proudly, "I worked up the ranking in last month's challenge, and I am now ranked 570th."
<br><br>
After Abdul bragged, warriors in the crowd began to chatter and whisper among themselves.
<br><br>
"Ha-ha. I thought he is good especially because he speaks so arrogantly.
<br><br>
He's ranked only 570th, and he still stays on the first floor."
<br><br>
"In any case, that means this guy must have stayed on the first floor for around 20 years, right?"
<br><br>
"Yes! He stays on the first floor, yet he shows off like he's from the third.
<br><br>
What a guy."
<br><br>
Among the new disciples, many of them were direct descendants of various mountains. Although they were new to the Land of Sword Grief, they knew the rules here all too well.
<br><br>
Warriors were treated differently based on the floors they stood on. The disciples on different floors of the Land of Sword Grief also showed the gap in their strengths. Chance, who was also a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, ranked at the bottom on the first floor. He had been so harshly defeated by Zen before.
<br><br>
Because Abdul was a resident of the first floor, the direct descendants naturally looked down upon him.
<br><br>
Abdul couldn't take the taunting and disrespect, a look of sudden anger flashing across his face.
<br><br>
However, he managed to control his emotions and spoke in a calm voice, "In the Land of Sword Grief, there is a challenge every month. First timers, like yourselves, all rank at 1, 117th. However, you can fight one another to get a new ranking. You can also choose an opponent on the first floor to challenge and promote your ranking." As he said this, he paused and looked at them with intent. "Please know that the last one hundred in the new rankings will not have access to any resources."
<br><br>
Abdul looked at the several direct descendants who once laughed at him but now filled with deep anxiousness. "Guys, I don't mind if you choose me to be your opponent," he sneered.
<br><br>
Although Abdul was on the first floor, he and the others had spent many years wandering in the Desire World of the Other Shore after their cultivation base at the Chaotic Source Realm had stabilized.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Tokens they carried were from Stage Fourteen and above.
<br><br>
At this point, their strength was something that newcomers could not go against.
<br><br>
If that was the case, how could these newcomers be so reckless and cocky to challenge them? They knew too well that most of them wouldn't be able to defeat even the longtime residents of the first floor.
<br><br>
While Abdul noticed the newcomers grow silent, his attitude shifted from cocky to demanding. "Didn't some of you look down on the warriors of the first floor? What did you just say?"
<br><br>
He pointed at a disciple from the crowd, a direct descendant of the Azure Mountain.
<br><br>
The disciple lowered his head under the pressure that was just put on him by Abdul.
<br><br>
"How about you?" Abdul turned towards another direct descendant. "Are you willing to challenge me?"
<br><br>
Shakily, the direct descendant took a few steps back, trying his best to disappear into the crowd.
<br><br>
Other disciples in the bronze palace watched and smiled, seeing the newcomers shrivel up to Abdul's presence.
<br><br>
"Abdul is bullying the newcomers," one pointed out.
<br><br>
"But there is no better way to deal with them. These disciples just got here, and they're already so damn conceited."
<br><br>
"They have no idea that the Chaotic Source Realm is merely a threshold for the other things they will encounter in the future."
<br><br>
The disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were all well experienced, so seeing the newcomers come in so proudly disappointed them. They had seen countless arrogant warriors who had suffered much in their first battles.
<br><br>
Eventually, Abdul's eyes finally fell on Elvinia.
<br><br>
Elvinia was always the apple of everyone's eyes in the Phoenix Palace. She was the most honorable direct descendant.
<br><br>
Abdul's goal was to suppress the newcomers, so seeing Elvinia gave him an idea. If he could suppress Elvinia, the other direct descendants would learn to keep their mouths shut.
<br><br>
After all, the Land of Sword Grief was not a place for the arrogant warriors to enter just by means of high positions or special identities.
<br><br>
Abdul walked up to Elvinia and smiled. "So I've heard that you are one of the outstanding warriors of the Phoenix Palace. Why don't you challenge me?"
<br><br>
Hearing this, Elvinia and Dorothy didn't know how to react.
<br><br>
After all, they didn't even care about the resources of the Land of Sword Grief or even the rankings.
<br><br>
But hearing this, Elvinia had to think hard. With her current strength, she might not be able to defeat Abdul at the moment.
<br><br>
Elvinia frowned at the thought of this and glanced at Zen. Meanwhile, the other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace also ended up looking at Zen.
<br><br>
They had explored the Chaotic Source World together with Zen, and they were very knowledgeable of Zen's strength and capabilities.
<br><br>
If he made the Inheritance of World descend, he'd be able to kill a great number of warriors in the Land of Sword Grief. However, Athemar and the leaders of various mountains had given a crucial order that the disciples couldn't bring up what had happened in the Chaotic Source World.
<br><br>
Moreover, almost all of them obtained Chaotic Source Spirits and reached the Chaotic Source Realm with Zen's help. They owed him a lot for his kindness.
<br><br>
That was why no one wanted to volunteer Zen for Abdul's challenge.
<br><br>
However, everyone still had a little hope that Zen could stand up for them.
<br><br>
Seeing everyone look at Zen, Abdul turned around to face him. "It seems that everyone wants you to challenge me."
<br><br>
Zen looked at Abdul with a calm, composed expression in his eyes. "I challenge you?" he said, pointing at himself and raising his eyebrows.
<br><br>
"Dare you?" Abdul asked.
<br><br>
"It's not a matter of whether I dare or not." Zen smirked and put his hands behind his back. "You're too weak. You're not even qualified to fight me."
<br><br>
Zen didn't intend to join the Land of Sword Grief at all, but he was loyal to the Oneness Sky Palace and their rules.
<br><br>
If Abdul hadn't provoked Elvinia, Zen would have just kept silent.
<br><br>
But because he was so insistent on challenging Elvinia, how could Zen possibly let this slide? After Abdul heard Zen's response, his face went from arrogant to furious.
<br><br>
Just then, a sharp light burst from his eyes like the sword radiance, and shot straight at Zen.
<br><br>
The two men behind Abdul looked angry as well. How dare this newcomer speak with such disrespect! Likewise, the disciples in the bronze palace were surprised with Zen's confidence.
<br><br>
"Check this out! A troublemaker appears!"
<br><br>
"I think I've seen that guy... He won first place in the Seven Mountains Meeting!"
<br><br>
"So what? If one can't even figure out their real strength, they are bound to suffer!"
<br><br>
The disciples on the first floor were discussing and debating Zen and his arrogance towards Abdul.
<br><br>
By contrast, the disciples on the second floor were much calmer.
<br><br>
The first floor and the second floor were completely different. Those who were on the second floor usually had no business in the disputes in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
Therefore, only 20 to 30 warriors on the second floor came out to welcome the new members today. However, at this moment, Zen's words attracted their attention.
<br><br>
Chapter 3495 Libby Li A white-faced man gazed at Zen with interest. He was on the second floor and was observing the young man. "It is said that the disciples of the Flow Sword Sect act at their sweet will. I find that to be true, Yusuf. That guy is just like the younger you."
<br><br>
Next to him was a strong man named Yusuf Gu, also a member of the Flow Sword Sect.
<br><br>
Yusuf glared at Zen coldly. "Don't take me for a fool. He's just joined the Land of Sword Grief but already has the audacity to challenge Abdul. He's simply an idiot asking for trouble."
<br><br>
It was a well-known fact that Abdul was a backbone of the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
He'd gotten lucky recently, finding an unparalleled Other Shore Token in Stage Sixteen. As his strength surged, his ranking also steadily improved.
<br><br>
If he played it safe, then he was set to reach the top 200 in the next couple of years and go up to the second floor.
<br><br>
The white-faced man laughed at Yusuf's words. "I don't think he's that much of an idiot. He didn't say he would challenge Abdul. That young man is actually quite shrewd in my opinion."
<br><br>
In his eyes, Zen was a mere cunning newcomer who had no courage to issue a direct challenge to Abdul.
<br><br>
"Still, it's not wise to piss off someone like Abdul," Yusuf reasoned.
<br><br>
Zen came from the Flow Sword Sect too and Yusuf had decided to stand up for him if he was bullied. Unfortunately, Zen's words earlier had offended most of the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief. Yusuf didn't think he'd be able to protect him because of that.
<br><br>
Abdul was ranked around 500th. The things Zen just said insinuated that nearly half of the disciples were not qualified to challenge him.
<br><br>
In all honesty, Abdul never expected Zen to answer him in such a way.
<br><br>
His Soul of Light emitted a sharp aura and charged straight towards Zen.
<br><br>
Despite the overwhelming pressure from Abdul's soul power, Zen remained calm and collected, never showing any sort of fear.
<br><br>
This placid reaction made Abdul feel strange. Was Zen truly not affected at all? 'Although he's just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, his soul is no weaker than mine, ' he thought to himself as he charged. 'Does he have some sort of magic treasure that lets him withstand soul attacks?' Despite his misgivings, Abdul soldiered on. He had to teach Zen a lesson about being disrespectful.
<br><br>
"Do you want to die?! This is the Land of Sword Grief, not the Flow Sword Sect!" Abdul reminded him.
<br><br>
"So what?!" Zen answered with obvious nonchalance.
<br><br>
His uncaring reaction made the two disciples behind Abdul livid.
<br><br>
These two disciples were from the Ivory Mountain and ranked lower than Abdul. Seeing someone like Zen be rude to their superior irritated them greatly.
<br><br>
"You brat! You've got a sharp tongue but little to no brains! If you're really capable, why don't you challenge me then?" one of them shouted.
<br><br>
"Yeah! Come and challenge me too while you're at it! You have the right to challenge me once!" Not one to be outdone, the other disciple also jeered at Zen.
<br><br>
It seemed the two were set offering themselves up for a challenge.
<br><br>
However, Zen simply gave them an indifferent look. "He's not qualified to challenge me. What more the two of you?"
<br><br>
His words drove the two red with rage.
<br><br>
"You!"
<br><br>
According to the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, veterans were forbidden from fighting with newcomers. Only newcomers were allowed to choose their opponents.
<br><br>
"Who do you think is qualified?" Abdul asked through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
Zen simply pointed at the bronze building. "Someone inside this bronze building."
<br><br>
"Please!"
<br><br>
Abdul held back his anger and went towards the bronze building with the newcomers following behind.
<br><br>
He needed to let Zen know the consequences of offending them.
<br><br>
As soon as the new disciples entered the first floor, those who were waiting there immediately gathered around and blocked Zen.
<br><br>
"You'll pay the price for your arrogance, brat!"
<br><br>
"Am I qualified to challenge you? Choose me!"
<br><br>
"Choose me!" "Choose me!"
<br><br>
"…"
<br><br>
It was plainly obvious that Zen's provocation had angered the Land of Sword Grief's veterans. Almost everyone wanted to challenge him.
<br><br>
"If you defeat me, I'll pay you ten thousand divine crystals!"
<br><br>
The prize was a small amount for these disciples.
<br><br>
It served as a starting bid as everyone followed suit.
<br><br>
"If you defeat me, I'll give you fifty thousand!"
<br><br>
"One hundred thousand!"
<br><br>
"One hundred and fifty thousand!"
<br><br>
"I don't care who wins! If you challenge me, I'll give you two hundred thousand!"
<br><br>
Zen was completely surrounded by the disciples and he didn't know whether he should laugh or cry.
<br><br>
Elvinia and Dorothy could only exchange confused looks with each other.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Chaim was laughing. He hadn't expected Zen to be this popular. Even the veterans were offering him divine crystals.
<br><br>
Once the bid reached four hundred thousand divine crystals, Zen finally felt the need to address them. "I'm not lacking divine crystals," he said.
<br><br>
His battle with the Evil God had him consume tens of millions of divine crystals and he recently used a huge amount to refine his body. Four hundred thousand was too meager of an amount to interest him.
<br><br>
"Since you aren't lacking divine crystals, how about treasures and weapons?"
<br><br>
"I have an intermediate Profound Blood Treasure! If you..."
<br><br>
"I have a premium Profound Blood Treasure!"
<br><br>
"I've got a sword that is a primary..."
<br><br>
The disciples were now bringing out all sorts of magic weapons, mainly swords since they were the known weapons for the Oneness Sky Palace disciples.
<br><br>
It was a complete mess. It seemed that as long as Zen chose to challenge them, they would meet all of his requirements.
<br><br>
Like Chaim, the newcomers couldn't help but tear up from having to hold back their laughter. Just what kind of reaction would the veterans have once they found out Zen's real strength? "Enough!" Zen announced, hiding his frustration behind a bitter smile.
<br><br>
Realizing that Zen was unwilling to challenge them, the veterans immediately turned hostile.
<br><br>
A young man, short in stature, stepped forward. "It seems you don't want to choose an opponent. Are you lacking guts? By a month, we'll have the right to challenge you and you won't be able to turn us down!"
<br><br>
Abdul sneered. "This guy's obviously playing with us. He doesn't dare to challenge us at all! Let's go. We'll see how miserable he'll be after a month."
<br><br>
Zen couldn't help but roll his eyes. "I can challenge you but first, I want to see the rankings of the Land of Sword Grief."
<br><br>
Everyone's eyes lit up. His request made sense. Maybe he wanted to play it smart and choose the people at the bottom of the rankings in hopes that it would increase his chances of victory.
<br><br>
It didn't matter though.
<br><br>
To them, even the 1115th warrior could take care of Zen effortlessly.
<br><br>
"This is the Ranking Stone!" someone in the crowd shouted. The disciples parted and allowed Zen a path towards the said stone.
<br><br>
At the end of the hall was a black stone pillar.
<br><br>
Someone rubbed his body against the magic array and names suddenly appeared like glowing carvings. There were 1, 116 names on it since Zen and the other newcomers hadn't been added yet. Right now, they were ranked 1117th.
<br><br>
These names were divided into three sections.
<br><br>
There were a little over 30 names in the first section: those on the third floor with the top spot taken by someone called Libby Li.
<br><br>
Chapter 3496 Cleon 'This Libby should be the strongest warrior in the Land of Sword Grief…' Zen thought to himself.
<br><br>
His gaze swept across the names on the Ranking Stone. "I have a question."
<br><br>
"What is it?"
<br><br>
"I can answer your question!"
<br><br>
"Go ahead!"
<br><br>
The veterans were entirely hospitable, each with their own axe to grind.
<br><br>
"Can I challenge the warriors on the second floor?" Zen asked flatly.
<br><br>
The several hundred people on the first floor were shocked silent upon hearing the question.
<br><br>
'What's wrong with him?' many of them wondered.
<br><br>
How dare he challenge the warriors on the second floor? Over 1, 100 people resided the entire Land of Sword Grief, and there were only about 200 people on the second floor. The strength of those who had reached the second floor was leaps and bounds beyond that of the first-floor cultivators.
<br><br>
"According to the rules, you're not permitted to challenge anyone on the second floor," Abdul explained as he walked up to the Ranking Stone, pointing to a name on the list. "He is the only one qualified to do so."
<br><br>
The name read Cleon. He was number one on the first floor.
<br><br>
Excitement flashed across Elvinia's eyes upon seeing Cleon's name. He was Jean's eldest son and Chance's brother—the guy who had been utterly defeated by Zen as a cultivator at the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
"I see." Zen nodded slowly, pointing to the first name on the second floor.
<br><br>
"That is to say, if I want to challenge someone on the third floor, I'd have to defeat the number one warrior on the second floor, right?"
<br><br>
Apart from the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace who had just arrived along with Zen, everyone else fell silent.
<br><br>
Most of them stared at Zen like he was an idiot.
<br><br>
"Is he insane?"
<br><br>
"How dare he even mention challenging someone on the third floor? Who does he think he is?"
<br><br>
"I've been in the Land of Sword Grief for a long time. This is the first time I've seen a newcomer be this cocky."
<br><br>
Completing the cultivation in the Chaotic Source Realm involved an extremely long process. The gap between the early, middle, and late stages of cultivation was undeniably wide—the three floors of the Land of Sword Grief represented such stages.
<br><br>
People on the third floor rarely appeared—they were truly mysterious. Even those disciples who had been in the land for many years had never met them.
<br><br>
Once those cultivators made a breakthrough, they had the potential to be chosen as the Oneness Governors at any given time—it was a chance to rise up the ranks and rule an entire place, like Athemar and Winchell.
<br><br>
Rocco Zheng, who ranked first on the second floor had remained on top for many years. But after being defeated seven years prior, he never challenged anyone on the third floor again.
<br><br>
Over 200 people occupied the second floor. Almost every month, they attempted to challenge Rocco and pull him down from the first place, but to no avail.
<br><br>
But while Rocco had to suppress all the people on the second floor, no one from the third floor was interested in dueling with him.
<br><br>
The difference in strength was just too great.
<br><br>
And so everyone was ready to write Zen off as a mere idiot.
<br><br>
But suddenly, Zen said, "I want to challenge this person."
<br><br>
His finger was pointing to the topmost name on the first floor, Cleon.
<br><br>
"What? You want to challenge Cleon?" Abdul practically convulsed.
<br><br>
The others stared at Zen in the same light, as they would look upon a monster.
<br><br>
If Zen won a fight against Cleon, he could challenge anyone on the second floor.
<br><br>
The latter was the target of many duels, after all.
<br><br>
But only by those within the top 30 on the first floor. Zen had only entered the Land of Sword Grief. It was all too bold of him to declare a challenge against the first-ranker.
<br><br>
People thought they might have heard wrong.
<br><br>
But Zen finally chose an opponent. Since he was courting death, the veterans didn't mind helping him.
<br><br>
"Where is Cleon?"
<br><br>
"He seems to be absent these days."
<br><br>
"I'll tell him someone wants to challenge him. He'll come back, for sure!"
<br><br>
At the beginning of every month, all disciples in the Land of Sword Grief stayed inside the building, waiting for challenges.
<br><br>
But it was already midway through the month when some disciples weren't qualified to challenge others. Some direct descendants then chose to leave.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Cleon and his brother, Chance, had just left the Oneness Mountain.
<br><br>
The moment they entered the Dragon City, the jade sword around Cleon's waist trembled, emitting a faint glow.
<br><br>
As Cleon gently flicked the jade sword, a strange look came over his face.
<br><br>
"What's wrong, Cleon?" Chance asked worriedly.
<br><br>
"Someone wants to challenge me." Cleon's tone was curious.
<br><br>
"You've been on top for the longest time. You must be used to being targeted," Chance returned with a smile.
<br><br>
Only when the disciples defeated Cleon could they challenge those on the second floor. On the first floor, he was the most popular, to the point where he had to accept at least one challenge every month.
<br><br>
"Do you think it's normal for anyone to challenge me now?" he asked thoughtfully.
<br><br>
After a moment, Chance clasped his hands together. "No. The month hasn't just started. They're not qualified to challenge you!"
<br><br>
For a moment, the other nodded before continuing, "Elvinia seems to have returned to the Phoenix Palace. The group of people heading to the Chaotic Source Realm should have returned by now."
<br><br>
Chance's eyes widened in disbelief. "You mean… It's a newcomer who wants to challenge you?"
<br><br>
Any new arrivals had the chance to challenge anyone upon entering the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
But generally, they fought against each other to earn their rankings. Rarely did anyone challenge veterans, even those of the lower ranks.
<br><br>
"I believe so."
<br><br>
Chance's expression looked unreadable. "How stupid can a newcomer be to challenge you right off the bat?"
<br><br>
Throwing a nonchalant glance at Chance, Cleon answered, "I don't know if there is any such newcomer. I only know that a disciple from the Land of Sword Grief was defeated by a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace who hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm."
<br><br>
What his brother said made Chance look grim. "That was an accident. That guy's Other Shore Token…"
<br><br>
"Don't look down upon any enemy," Cleon interrupted him. "If I were you, I'd have been pulled down from the first place ages ago."
<br><br>
Chance's defeat by Zen's hands still brought him great shame. Because Jean had covered up the fact, only a few people were aware of it.
<br><br>
"Come on, let's go back to the Land of Sword Grief," Cleon said, his eyes looking sharp and his mouth curling. "I'm rather curious about how talented this new guy is and why he dares to challenge me."
<br><br>
Once they left the Dragon City, they headed straight for the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
For an hour, Zen had waited on the first floor. News of the newcomer challenging Cleon spread quickly. More and more onlookers gathered around.
<br><br>
Some disciples who were already out rushed back, and even those practicing in seclusion wanted to see who the arrogant new arrival was.
<br><br>
Chapter 3497 Three Thousand Divine Megatons The newcomers behind Zen were all nervous and fidgety.
<br><br>
Although Zen's strength was unquestionable, it was another matter for him to challenge the strongest warrior on the first floor.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were merely waiting for a good show.
<br><br>
Abdul observed Zen quietly from the sidelines.
<br><br>
For some reason, he had a hunch that something was going to go wrong.
<br><br>
A person who was able to survive the Chaotic Source World and reach the Chaotic Source Realm must be extremely outstanding. But that person shouldn't have done such a stupid thing.
<br><br>
Zen looked all too calm as though he was brimming with confidence.
<br><br>
It didn't seem like a mask.
<br><br>
Even if he was pretending, the fight would expose his true strength.
<br><br>
Did he do it for the sake of the new disciples? About an hour later, two figures appeared before the door of the bronze palace. Then, Cleon's booming voice came through, "Who on earth wants to challenge me?"
<br><br>
"Cleon is back!"
<br><br>
The senior disciples' eyes flickered in excitement.
<br><br>
Abdul stepped forward and cupped one hand in the other, making obeisance to Cleon. Then, he pointed to Zen. "It's him."
<br><br>
Taking a casual glance at Zen, looking him up and down, Cleon didn't find anything particularly special. But he heard Chance gasp loudly in surprise from beside him.
<br><br>
"Chance, for heaven's sake!" Cleon chastised.
<br><br>
But how could Chance not react at all? Never did he expect to see Zen there, let alone find out he was the one who challenged his elder brother.
<br><br>
Not long ago, he was defeated by this very man. Because of his failure, he was thoroughly reprimanded by his elder brother, and even mocked by his younger one—Ahmad.
<br><br>
Now, Zen had just entered the Chaotic Source Realm. Chance had never thought he would be so bold as to challenge Cleon.
<br><br>
"Brother…that's Zen Luo," Chance muttered.
<br><br>
The revelation had Cleon's eyes slightly widen in surprise.
<br><br>
In truth, he never understood how Chance could have been defeated by Zen.
<br><br>
Zen's Regal Jade chessboard, as described by Chance, sounded way too powerful to be real.
<br><br>
Never had Cleon heard of such an Other Shore Token.
<br><br>
But Cleon hadn't expected Zen to be bold enough to challenge him as soon as he reached the Chaotic Source Realm and joined the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
After a moment of thought, Cleon smiled gently as he said, "So, you're Zen?"
<br><br>
"Yes, that's my name," Zen replied plainly.
<br><br>
"You defeated my younger brother, Chance, before you even reached the Chaotic Source Realm. You must be very good." Cleon's tone was flat.
<br><br>
His words instantly caused an uproar among the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"Did I hear that wrong?"
<br><br>
"This guy defeated Chance before reaching the Chaotic Source Realm?"
<br><br>
On the Ranking Stone, Chance stood at the 1022nd. It was a rather lagging position, but there were still nearly a hundred people below him on the list.
<br><br>
That meant that Zen could have defeated the senior disciples at the bottom of the list before reaching the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
The thought had the seniors' faces turn grim.
<br><br>
"Brother!"
<br><br>
Cleon's casual mention of Chance's defeat had him rather embarrassed.
<br><br>
To keep his defeat a secret, Jean, his mother, had ordered to dismiss all the guards of the Phoenix Palace.
<br><br>
This kept the knowledge of his failure limited.
<br><br>
But Cleon made it public so easily. Chance wasn't the only one disgraced.
<br><br>
But Cleon didn't seem to care about his brother's protest. "You did lose—it's a matter of fact. There's no need to hide it. Someone was lucky enough to get some special Other Shore Token. It was luck on his side that let him defeat someone stronger than him."
<br><br>
Then, he turned to Zen and bored his gaze into him firmly. "I'm afraid you won't be so lucky in front of me. Since you've chosen to challenge me, I won't refuse the fight. But you must be prepared to pay the price!"
<br><br>
With that, Cleon went straight to the back of the bronze palace. When he passed by Abdul, he gave him a pat on the shoulder. "Bring him here," he said.
<br><br>
The other senior disciples followed Cleon and left the room. Zen and the new disciples were the last to walk out.
<br><br>
While the disciples on the second floor looked down upon the first-floor disciples, they were rather intrigued to hear of a newcomer challenging Cleon.
<br><br>
They wanted to see for themselves if Zen was merely arrogant or if he actually had any formidable strength.
<br><br>
Behind the bronze palace stood an arena.
<br><br>
It was where the disciples of the Land in Sword Grief trained for martial arts.
<br><br>
Once Cleon's foot met the ground, he stood in the very center of the arena.
<br><br>
Tilting his palm, he gestured for Zen to enter the area.
<br><br>
Excitement was building up among the disciples on the first floor.
<br><br>
"Cleon! Make him suffer!"
<br><br>
"He probably can't even take a single punch from Cleon! He's just entered the Chaotic Source Realm!"
<br><br>
"A single punch will be enough to exhaust all the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body. A second punch will smash him into pieces!"
<br><br>
In the midst of the hubbub, Zen jumped up and confidently took his place on the arena.
<br><br>
From there, he saw snake-shaped arrays arranged around them.
<br><br>
Noticing how Zen examined the arrays curiously, Cleon said, "This is the first time you've stepped onto the arena. There are some rules I must explain. The Other Shore Tokens of the descending type cannot be used in the Land of Sword Grief."
<br><br>
That made Zen frown questioningly. "I can't use any Other Shore Token of the descending type?"
<br><br>
Seeing Zen's face, Cleon's eyes showed a hint of complacence.
<br><br>
Chance had told him what Zen had relied on was the Regal Jade chessboard. If the statues that descended could grow infinitely, it would be truly terrifying. But if the Other Shore Token was forbidden, Zen would pose no threat to Cleon.
<br><br>
"Not only the Other Shore Tokens of the descending type, but also those of the mysterious type and the auxiliary type are prohibited. If you attempt to use any of them, you will be rejected by the arrays and in turn, lose the battle," Cleon continued.
<br><br>
"Got it." Zen nodded once.
<br><br>
The standard for joining the Land of Sword Grief rested on reaching the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
Disciples of this realm had to go to the extreme to increase the bearing capacity of their Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
All sorts of incredible abilities were within the Other Shore Tokens. Once they were used, unforeseen consequences were likely to unfold. Naturally, they had been prohibited in the arena.
<br><br>
"If you got it, then… You will lose!" Cleon declared as a tremendous aura spread from his body.
<br><br>
The Other Shore Power constantly surged out of his inner world, fueling his body. With all the Chaotic Source Spirits activated simultaneously, his aura grew wildly.
<br><br>
"But it won't really be a shame for you to lose to me. I am number one on the first floor, after all. But unfortunately, you have once humiliated my younger brother, Chance. I won't be showing you any mercy. You're going to suffer what you must."
<br><br>
Then, as Cleon stretched out his hand to condense his power, his strike was already on its way to Zen's head.
<br><br>
"Wow!"
<br><br>
The palm strike held over three thousand divine megatons of Other Shore Power.
<br><br>
Chapter 3498 Taking The Palm Strike Head-on The moment the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief saw the large palm print, a small smile graced their lips.
<br><br>
It appeared that Cleon was a nice man as he had patiently explained the rules to Zen, but when the fight began, he showed no mercy.
<br><br>
Most disciples from the first floor couldn't withstand the large palm print at all! Given that Zen had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, this time, the palm print's force could not only drain the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body, but also slap him half to death.
<br><br>
Despite that, Elvinia, Dorothy, and Chaim weren't so worried at that moment.
<br><br>
They knew that what Zen had experienced in the Chaotic Source World was far worse than Cleon's palm print.
<br><br>
Even if he didn't summon a world and activate the Inheritance of World, he would still be able to cope with it.
<br><br>
Just as the large palm print was about to strike his head, he looked like he wouldn't dodge it.
<br><br>
These days, he had constantly summoned the Regal Jade sculptures to refine his body.
<br><br>
He'd summoned from the first sculpture to the tenth to refine his body from the beginning, and the Truth of Godly Way in his physical body was enough to meet the needs of the Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
But as their strength increased, so did their need for the Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
Therefore, Zen could only summon stronger Regal Jade sculptures. Later, the Regal Jade sculptures that he used to refine his body were basically the sculptures from the tenth to the twentieth.
<br><br>
Recently, he had activated the twentieth to the thirtieth sculptures! His Chaotic Source Spirits were so strong that even when under the siege of those ten sculptures, they could still hold on for a while. Indeed, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body had improved by leaps and bounds.
<br><br>
Therefore, how could a palm print with merely the force of three thousand divine megatons possibly hurt him? "Whoosh!"
<br><br>
The huge palm print finally struck down on Zen's head.
<br><br>
When Cleon saw Zen simply raise his hands to cover his face, he smiled lazily and muttered, "How naive..."
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
There was a loud thud when the huge palm print hit Zen's skull hard.
<br><br>
At that moment, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body became extremely active. The light dots repeatedly jumped around and at the same time, a golden light circulated around the surface of Zen's body once. Then it entered into his body.
<br><br>
It was a fascinating sight, and everyone's eyes were focused on him.
<br><br>
Cleon also looked at him in curiosity.
<br><br>
After Zen had received such a heavy blow, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body should be quickly exhausted. While the strong Other Shore Power simultaneously repressed his body, all his internal organs, even the bones and flesh would explode.
<br><br>
Most people could foresee such a thing to happen as well.
<br><br>
Yet, it didn't happen… Zen still stood there unharmed with a small smile on his lips. It seemed as if he had not been hurt at all.
<br><br>
Silence befell around the arena.
<br><br>
Those who knew Zen well like Elvinia, Dorothy, Chaim, and some others were also utterly surprised.
<br><br>
They were sure that Zen had a way to deal with the huge palm print, but they never expected that he would be able to use his physical body to resist it head-on.
<br><br>
They had refined the Chaotic Source Spirits and reached the Chaotic Source Realm on the same day as Zen! It had only been a month! Could it be really true that Zen had already strengthened the Chaotic Source Spirits to such a level in just one month? When it came to magic pills and treasures, Elvinia and Dorothy were in no way inferior to Zen.
<br><br>
Besides, the Origin Mountain and the Phoenix Palace had taught them some exclusive body refining methods which specialized in the cultivation on the Chaotic Source Spirits. Such body refining methods, however, were barely different from each other, so the speed of their improvement was almost about the same.
<br><br>
Even then, Zen's progress was way beyond the others' imaginations.
<br><br>
If Dorothy, Elvinia, and the rest of them were all shocked, then more so the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief, whose eyes were wide as saucers.
<br><br>
Most especially Chance and Abdul, who almost dropped their jaws.
<br><br>
Chance had been so eager to see the time when Cleon could slap Zen to death with that huge palm print, as it would relieve the hate he felt.
<br><br>
He was pleased when Zen didn't dodge Cleon's attack, as it was exactly what he wanted to see.
<br><br>
But, the result was totally different from what he had imagined.
<br><br>
As for Abdul, he couldn't speak nor move. His eyes just stared in shock.
<br><br>
He had been in the Land of Sword Grief for such a long time, but he could only achieve a strike with two thousand and five hundred divine megatons of force at most.
<br><br>
The force of the palm strike that had hit Zen was much greater than the strike Abdul could launch.
<br><br>
In other words...
<br><br>
Abdul realized that he could never defeat Zen, even if the latter just stood still and let him beat his body as he liked.
<br><br>
Although Abdul did not come to the arena to fight himself, what he saw was like a hammer that pounded his heart. He was absolutely crushed.
<br><br>
On the second floor, the warrior with the white face and his burly companion, Yusuf, were also taken aback. Aside from being astounded, Yusuf also felt a little excited.
<br><br>
"Do you still think he is stupid now?" asked the warrior with a white face.
<br><br>
A deep sigh came out from Yusuf's lips.
<br><br>
"It seems that there is another remarkable figure in the Flow Sword Sect after me!" he said with a laugh.
<br><br>
"Don't blow your own trumpet," the white faced man said and glared at him. "You had stayed on the first floor for a long time back then. This man just came to the Land of Sword Grief, yet he is able to challenge Cleon. Can you even compare to such a freak?"
<br><br>
Forget about Yusuf...
<br><br>
Perhaps in the whole history of the Land of Sword Grief, there had never appeared such a figure.
<br><br>
In turn, Yusuf immediately kept quiet upon hearing what the warrior with a white face said.
<br><br>
After a moment of silence, the crowd began to discuss among themselves.
<br><br>
"What happened? Did Cleon hold back his strength?" "It's impossible! The Other Shore Power the giant palm print has released is at least three thousand divine megatons, and Cleon used eighty percent of his strength!"
<br><br>
"But that guy didn't move a bit! Logically, three thousand divine megatons of force is enough to crush him into pieces, right?"
<br><br>
"How should I know?"
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Cleon stood in the arena with his right hand still in the position of launching the palm strike.
<br><br>
His eyes were full of disbelief, as if he was in front of a monster and not a warrior.
<br><br>
"Please, go on," said Zen, who stretched his hand and made the same gesture as Cleon's.
<br><br>
At that point, Cleon even suspected that Zen had used some special Other Shore Token which blocked the attack for him.
<br><br>
However, there was no way to use the magical powers of any Other Shore Token in that arena. If Zen attempted to do so, it would activate the arrays around the arena and he would have been kicked out already.
<br><br>
The arrays were not activated, which meant that Zen had relied on himself to take the attack.
<br><br>
"Go on?" Cleon hissed. His eyes flashed coldly at his opponent.
<br><br>
Cleon had held back a little of his strength. After all, it would be troublesome if he had accidentally killed Zen.
<br><br>
Now, he decided to strike with his full power. He flipped his hands, and numerous large palm prints began to take shape and circle around Zen.
<br><br>
The palm prints intertwined to form a dangerous killing trap! Experienced Other Shore Realm warriors knew that one should get out of those large palm prints immediately, but Zen did not intend to escape at all.
<br><br>
Instead, he just let himself be trapped.
<br><br>
"Smash him!"
<br><br>
A killing intent flashed in Cleon's eyes. He flipped his palm, and the many palm prints swept over Zen.
<br><br>
Even if Zen had a special way that helped him to resist his palm strike just now, the Chaotic Source Spirits inside his body would eventually be exhausted. Now that he launched a continuous attack of his palm prints, Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits would be worn out at a faster rate.
<br><br>
He didn't believe that Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits were different, unlike anything he had ever seen! Chapter 3499 Ranking First On The First Floor The truth was that Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits were indeed no different from the others'.
<br><br>
What actually set him apart from the rest was the Truth of Godly Way contained in his physical body.
<br><br>
It was known that the Chaotic Source Spirits of all the powerful Chaotic Source Realm warriors could not bear an infinite amount of power forever.
<br><br>
Of course, Zen's couldn't as well.
<br><br>
However, the Truth of Godly Way formed from his body could quickly nourish the Chaotic Source Spirits. Not only could it strengthen them, but it could also immediately stop them from being fatigued.
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
"Bang!"
<br><br>
Every time a large palm print exploded on Zen, the golden light around his body flashed, and the Chaotic Source Spirits absorbed the aura of the Truth of Godly Way.
<br><br>
In the past month, Zen had endured such attacks day and night.
<br><br>
The difference lay in the fact that using the Regal Jade statues' attacks required a lot of divine crystals, while Cleon's attacks were free.
<br><br>
The palm strikes continued, and his body was tossed higher and higher.
<br><br>
The palm prints formed one after another, attacked his body, and then dispersed.
<br><br>
The audience's eyes were fixed on Zen, who was flying up in the air.
<br><br>
They hoped to see his body be torn into pieces and thoroughly disintegrated, but it never happened! "Haven't his Chaotic Source Spirits been exhausted yet?" a man with a dark and sallow face uttered in astonishment. This sallow-faced man was ranked 19th on the first floor and could be considered as a top warrior in the Land of Sword Grief.
<br><br>
According to his assessment, he estimated that four palm strikes from Cleon was enough to exhaust the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body.
<br><br>
In other words, he could take the four palm attacks from Cleon head-on, but after that he would definitely be defeated.
<br><br>
As of now, Cleon's series of large palm prints had slapped Zen more than ten times, but the latter was still unharmed.
<br><br>
'Has this guy really just reached the Chaotic Source Realm?' Cleon thought in confusion.
<br><br>
"Bang! Bang! Bang..."
<br><br>
Cleon's eyes gleamed with amazement, even as he continued to rain a barrage of attacks on Zen.
<br><br>
He had almost activated his strength to the limit! The Other Shore Token that Cleon fused with was from Stage Eighteen. It could unleash as much as 5, 000 divine megatons of force, but the bearing capacity of Cleon's physical body was limited. If he activated 5, 000 divine megatons of power in one go, it would be difficult for his Chaotic Source Spirits to bear it.
<br><br>
Whenever Cleon launched a palm attack, he released 3, 500 divine megatons of power. It was clearly less than the token's full force, but the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body got slightly weak and exhausted! If things went on like that, he might not be able to withstand his own actions anymore, let alone destroy Zen's Chaotic Source Spirits.
<br><br>
Naturally, he would be ashamed if he lost to a warrior who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm.
<br><br>
As Cleon thought of it, he gritted his teeth and went all out! He proceeded to unleash more power from the Other Shore Token! "Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"
<br><br>
He condensed three colossal palm prints again, and shot them towards Zen who was in the air.
<br><br>
While he launched the three large palm prints, he took a deep breath, and the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body died out one by one.
<br><br>
Those Chaotic Source Spirits had been completely exhausted.
<br><br>
After he lost the Chaotic Source Spirits' support, he didn't dare activate the Other Shore Token anymore. Otherwise, his body would collapse before he could even release the power.
<br><br>
"Three palm strikes are already Cleon's limit..."
<br><br>
"If those three moves can't defeat Zen, then Cleon would lose!"
<br><br>
"I'm afraid that that guy will create a record..."
<br><br>
The warriors who had stayed in the Land of Sword Grief for a long time could see that Cleon had already reached his limit. He was now like a spent arrow.
<br><br>
As soon as the three palm prints charged straight towards Zen, he changed his posture in the air, which made the Shade Stone liquid inside his body disperse to his bones.
<br><br>
It was prohibited to use special abilities of Other Shore Tokens in the battle arena, but since the Shade Stone liquid was a part of Zen's body, then it shouldn't be a problem.
<br><br>
The moment he had adjusted his position, the three palm prints came at him.
<br><br>
"Bang!" "Bang!" "Bang!"
<br><br>
The horrifyingly violent Other Shore Power hit his body and spread out.
<br><br>
The space around him shook constantly, like an empty house in a hurricane's eye.
<br><br>
The force of those palm strikes would've torn a normal space apart.
<br><br>
Needless to say, it was obvious that there was something used to stabilize the space in the battle arena. So, the space around the arena shook violently and then eventually became steady.
<br><br>
Despite having endured three palm attacks, Zen's physical body was as stable as before! Just then, he lightly tapped in mid-air like a nimble bird, and landed gently on the arena afterwards. He looked at Cleon with calm eyes.
<br><br>
He did not do anything.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Cleon's Chaotic Source Spirits had gotten exhausted, and now he could not withstand a single blow.
<br><br>
There was nothing else he could do, and he just glared at Zen with great displeasure.
<br><br>
Finally, he pulled a long face and stood in front of his opponent, unwilling to admit defeat. "You don't want to admit defeat? Do you want to wait for the Chaotic Source Spirits to recover?" asked Zen.
<br><br>
"I... I... I lost," Cleon stammered.
<br><br>
When he admitted that he lost, the newcomers burst into cheers.
<br><br>
Zen's triumph over Cleon, however, had nothing to do with those newcomers. They still had to compete with each other and determine the rankings.
<br><br>
The newcomers were certainly displeased by the attitudes of the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief, and it was Zen who had helped them to vent out their resentment.
<br><br>
Zen glanced at Abdul who stayed under the platform, and asked, "Do you think you are qualified to challenge me?"
<br><br>
Zen had effortlessly beaten the warrior who ranked first on the first floor.
<br><br>
Indeed, a disciple who was ranked over 500th wasn't qualified to challenge him.
<br><br>
Abdul stood there stiffly and shook his head when Zen's cold gaze stared straight at him.
<br><br>
As for Chance, he was even more dejected.
<br><br>
After all, the fact that he had lost to Zen always made him miserable.
<br><br>
The fact that Zen had defeated his brother after a few months just added salt to the wound. Did fate send this guy to torture them? On the other hand, the warriors who belonged to the first floor of the Land of Sword Grief still stood there in amazement.
<br><br>
The way they looked at Zen had completely changed.
<br><br>
The strength he had just shown didn't seem like it was at its limit.
<br><br>
Furthermore, he had endured Cleon's attacks without making a move.
<br><br>
How terrifying could he be if he fought back? With such a level of strength, he could break through to the second floor completely...
<br><br>
"Buzz..."
<br><br>
At that moment, the Ranking Stone's light flashed, and the rankings had changed.
<br><br>
Cleon's name was forcefully pushed behind Zen's, while Zen now ranked first on the first floor! "A new record was formed. On the first day of entering the Land of Sword Grief, that warrior has managed to make his ranking go up by 1, 116 places, and directly rank first on the first floor. His promotion is even faster than that of Libby..." a disciple muttered. He was absolutely floored when he saw the prompt beside Zen's name.
<br><br>
"I've heard that this guy has performed very well and made a splash at the Seven Mountains Meeting. I really didn't expect..." another disciple muttered and looked at the Ranking Stone, completely dumbfounded.
<br><br>
Everyone in the Land of Sword Grief paid close attention to the change in the Ranking Stone which was the evidence of their strength.
<br><br>
When the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief saw the change in Zen's ranking, many of them suddenly thought of Libby, who was the number one warrior in the entire Land of Sword Grief.
